# Triumphal Chariot of Antimony by Basil Valentine

------------------------------------------------------------------------

BASIL VALENTINE

HIS

TRIUMPHANT CHARIOT

OF

ANTIMONY

with Annotations of

Theodore Kirkringus (1678)

Since, *Basil Valentine*, by Religious Vows am bound according to the
Order of St. Benedict, and that requires another manner of Spirit of
Holiness, then the common State of Mortals exercised in the prophane
business of this World; I thought it my duty before all things, in the
beginning of this little Book, to declare what is necessary to be known
to the pious *Spagyrist*, inflamed with an ardent desire of this *Art*;
as, what he ought to do, and whereunto to direct his aim, that he may
lay such Foundations of the whole matter, as may be stable; lest his
Building shaken with Winds, happen to fail, and the whole Edifice to be
involved in shameful Ruine, which otherwise, being founded on more firm
and solid Principles, might have continued for a long series of time.
Which Admonition I judged was, is, and always will be a necessary part
of my Religious Office; especially, since we must all die, and no one of
us, which now are, whether high or low, shall long be seen among the
number of Men. For it concerns me to commend these Meditations of
Mortality and Posterity, leaving them behind me, not only that honour
may be given to the Divine Majesty, but also that Men may obey him
sincerely in all things.

In this Meditation I found that there were five principal Heads, chiefly
to be considered by the wise and prudent Spectators of our Wisdom and
Art. This first of which is, *Invocation* of GOD. the second,
*Contemplation of Nature*. The third, *True Preparation*. The fourth,
The Way of *Using*. The fifth, *Utility* and *Fruit.* For he, who
regards not these, shall never obtain place among true *Chymists*, or
fill up the number of perfect *Spagyrists.* Therefore touching these
five Heads we shall here following treat, and so far declare them, as
that the general Work may be brought to light and perfected by an intent
and studious Operation.

1\. \[GOD TO BE FIRST INVOKED\]

Invocation of GOD must be made with a certain Heavenly Intention, drawn
from the bottom of a pure and sincere Heart, and Conscience, free from
all Ambition, Hypocrisy, and all other Vices, which have any affinity
with these, as Arrogance, Boldness, Pride, Luxury, Mundane Petulancy,
Oppression of the Poor, and other dependent evils, all which are to be
eradicated out of the Heart; that when a Man desires to prostrate
himself before the Throne of Grace, for obtaining bodily health, he may
do that with a Conscience free from all unprofitable Weeds, that his
Body may be transmuted into an Holy Temple of GOD, and be purged from
every uncleaness. For GOD will not be mocked (which I earnestly
admonish) as Worldly Men, pleasing and flattering themselves with their
own Wisdom, think: GOD, I say, will not be mocked, but the Creator of
all things will be invoked with reverential fear, and acknowledged with
due Obedience. And for this there is great Reason. For what hath Man,
that he must not own to be recieved from this his Omnipotent Creator,
whether you have respect to the Body, or to the Soul, which operates the
Body? Hath no he, for sustention of this, out of his meer Mercy
communicated to us his Eternal WORD, and also promised Eternal
*Salvation*? Hath not he also provided food and cloathing for the Body,
and all those things without which the Body cannot subsist? All these,
by humble Prayer a Man obtains of that most excellent Father, who
created Heaven and Earth, together with things Visible and Invisible, as
the Firmament, Elements, Vegetables, and Animals. Which is so very true,
that I am certainly assured, no Impious Man shall ever be partaker of
true Medicine, much less of the Eternal Heavenly Bread. Therefore place
your whole Intention and Trust in GOD, call upon him and pray, that he
may impart his blessing to you: let this be the beginning of your work,
that by the same you may obtain your desired end, and at length effect
what you intended.

For the Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wisdom.

Whosoever purposeth in himself to seek after that, which is the greatest
of Terrene things, especially the knowledge of every good thing, that is
in the Creatures, and *GOD* hath liberally imparted to Men, and
implanted (as to their effective power) in *Stones, Herbs, Roots, Seeds,
Animals, Plants, Minerals, Metals,* yea and indeed in all things; let
him cast away all Earthly thoughts, reject all that depends on them, and
hope for freeness of Heart, and pray unto GOD with great lowlyness of
mind: So doing, his hope of freeness may at length be turned into
freedom. Which no Man will doubt, who knows, that he alone is GOD, who
delivered *Israel* from all his Enemies; which deliverance he did in
very deed effect, not only for *Israel*, but also for all Men making
humble supplications to him, and praying with brokenness of Heart.
Therefore let Prayer by the first point of our Admonition, which also
is, and by us is called *Invokation of GOD*, which if made, not with
Hypocrisy and a feigned Heart, but with such Faith and Trust, as that,
with which the *Centurion* in *Capernaum* prayed; with such lowlines of
mind, and confession of Sins, as the *Woman* of *Canaan* was endued
with; with such Charity as the *Samaritan* shewed to the Man wounded in
the way to *Jericho*, pouring Wine and Oyl into his wounds, paying his
Charges in the Inn, and giving order he should be very carefully looked
to; Lastly, if a Man’s Christian Charity extends itself so far, as if he
obtain what he prays for, he would willingly communicate of the same to
his Neighbour, then he shall unobtainably obtain Riches and Health, the
of his *Prayer*.\*

\*What the Author hath premised here at large, and elsewhere often
inserted touching Piety, the worship of GOD, and Invocation of his Name,
I purpose neither to praise nor dispraise; Let them by judged by signs
of his own earnest Piety, Arguments of his sincerity and signate
Impresses of his fervent zeal (by so many Tautologies and Reiterations)
often boiling up. Every Man, according to the Opinion of his mind, and
the presuasion, in which he was educated from his Childhood, will more
or less esteem of this. It was my business to translate the Authors
writings into Latin, in such a Method and Order, as I thought would in
no wise give any distaste to the delicate Palat of the Reader; also to
indicate that, which seems pertinent to the business of every Chymist
and true Spagyrist, and not to neglect the other. For since Piety is
available for all things, as divine Oracles teach, and the principal
exercise of Piety is Prayer; by which Celestial Gifts are obtained of
GOD the giver of all good things; our Author wills, that unto him the
mind by lifted up, even in the midstof the Operations of Chymistry full
of labour and toil. If prayer effected no other thing, it certainly
collects the mind (called away from all other things) into it self and
renders it apt for that which is in hand; whence it comes to pass, that
it reflects upon many things, and considers them, which otherwise would
not enter the mind, if it set about its Work perfunctorily, and
distracted with vaious Conceptions: And so by the help of Prayer we
receive many things, which we (if not ungrateful) must needs acknowledge
we have obtained from GOD.How often this is found to be of use in
Spagyric Works every Man knows, that hath any time entirely devoted
himself to this business; viz. how often those things which he long
sought and could not find, have been imparted to him in a moment, and as
it were infused from above, or dictated by soem good Genius. That also
is of use in dissolving all Riddles, or Enigmatical Writings: For if you
burn with a great desire of knowing them, that is Prayer; and when you
incline your mind to this or that, variously discussing and meditating
many things, this is Cooperation; that your Prayer may not be idle, or
tempting GOD: yet this your endeavour is in vain, until you find the
Solution. Nevertheless if you despair not, but instantly persist in
desir, and cease not from labour, at length in a moment the Solution
will fall in; this is Revelation, which you cannot receive unless you
pray with great desire and labour, using your utmost endeavour; and yet
you cannot perceive, how from all those things (of which you thought)
which were not the Solution of the Enigma, the Solution it self arose.
This unfolding of the Riddle opens to you the mystery of all great
things, and shews how available Prayer is for the obtainment of things
Spiritual and Eternal, as well as Corporal and perishing goods: and when
Prayer is made with a Heart not feigned, but sincere; you will see that
there is nothing more fit for the acquiring of what you desire. Let
these suffice to be spoken of Prayer, which Basilius and all
Philosophers with him do not vainly require, as an Introduction to
Chymistry. For Piety is profitable for all Works, especially for Great
Undertakings.

2\. Next in order after *Prayer* is *Contemplation*, by which I
understand an accurate attention to the business it self, under which
fall these considerations first to be noted. As, what are the
*Circumstances* of any thing, what the *Matter*, what the *Form*, whence
its operations proceed, whence it is infused and implanted, how
generated by the *Stars*, conformed by the *Elements*, produced and
perfected by the three *Principles*. Also how the body of every thing
may be dissolved, that is, resolved into the first *Matter*, or first
*Essence* (of which I have already made mention in other of my writings)
*viz.* how the last Matter may be changed into the first, and the first
into the last.\*

\*What are here set down, touching the true Theory of Philosophy, are
compendiums of those things, which Philosophers have in os many Books
(writ about the same business) revealed, shall I say, or concealed.
Attend to the words of the Author, and you will see, that he perfectly
knew that Spirit penetrating all things, which presides or bears rule in
all things, yet is involved and absconded matter and defilements on
every side; from which if once freed, it returns to the purity of its
own substance, in which it produceth all things, and is all in all. To
comment upon this, would be a work no less than the producing of all
Books of Philosophers, compiled with such accurate study, and contending
with so great contention about the Theory.

This *Contemplation*, which absolves the second part of our Admonition,
is Celestial, and to be understood with Spiritual Reason; for the
circumstances and depth of every thing cannot be perceived any other
way, then by the Spiritual Cogitation of Man: and this *Contemplation*
is twofold. One is called possible, the other impossible. The later
consists of copious cogitations, which never proceed to effects, nor
exhibit any form of a matter, which falls under the Touch. As if any one
should endeavour to comprehend the Eternity of the Most High, which is
vain and impossible, yea a Sin against the Holy Spirit, so arrogantly to
pry itno the *Divinity* itself, which is Immense, Infinite, and Eternal;
and to subject the incomprehensive Counsel of the Secrets of GOD, to
humane Inquisition. The other part of *Contemplation*, which is
possible, is called the *Theory*. This contemplates that, which is
perceived by Touch and Sight, and hath a formed *Nature* in time: this
considers, how that nature may be helped and perfected by Resolution of
it self; how every body may give forth from it self, the good or evil,
Venome or Medicine latent in it; how Destruction and Confraction are to
be handled, whereby under a just Title, without Sophistical deceits, the
pure may be severed and seperated from the impure. This *Seperation* is
instituted and made by divers manual operations, and various ways; Some
of which are vulgarly known by experience, others remote from vulgar
experience. These are, *Calcination, Sublimation, Reverberation,
Circulation, Putrefaction, Digestion, Distillation, Cohobation,
Fixation,* and the like of these; all degrees of which are found in
operating, learned, perceived and manifest by the same. Whence clearly
appears what is moveable, what is fixed, what is white, red, black,
blew, or green, *viz.* when the operation is rightly Instituted by the
Artificer, for possibly the Operator may err, and turn aside from the
right way; but that *Nature* should err, when rightly handled, is not
possible. Therefore if you shall err, so that *Nature* cannot be
altogether free, and released from the Body, in which it is help
Captive, return again into your way, learn the *Theory* more perfectly,
and enquire more accurately in the method of operating, that you may
find the foundation and certainty in Seperation of all things. Which is
a matter of great concern. And this is the second foundation of
Philosophy, which follows the *Prayer*: for in that the sum of the
matter lies, and is contained in these words. Seek first the *Kingdom of
GOD*, and his *Justice* by *Prayer*, and all other things, which Man
seeks in these Temporals, and he hath need of, either for the
sustentation or health of his body, shall be added to you.

3\. Next to the *Theory*, which researcheth out the inmost properties of
things, follows *Preparation*, which is performed by Operations of the
hands, that some real work may be produced. From *Preparation* ariseth
Knowledge, *viz.* Such, as opens all the fundamentals of Medicine.
Operation of the Hands requires a diligent application of it self, but
the praise of Science consists in experience, but the difference of
these *Anatomy* distinquisheth, \*Operation shews how all things may be
brought to light, and exposed to sight visibly: but knowledge shews the
practice; and that, whence the true Practitioner is, and is no other
then confirmation: because the operation of the hands manifests
something that is good, and draws the latent and hidden nature outwards,
and brings it to light for good. For, as in Spirituals, the way of the
Lord is to be prepared; so also in these things, the way is to be opened
and prepared; so also in these things, the way is to be opened and
prepared, that no errour be from the right path, and the Process may be
made, without devious errours, in the direct way to health.

\*

Manual Operation is chiefly required in this third Part, without which,
every Operation, like a Ship wanting Ballast, floats and is uncertain.
It is difficult to express this with a Pen; for more is learned by once
seeing the work done, then can be taught by the writing of many Pages;
yet if it be no offence to you, to peruse these Commentaries together
with Basilius (in this so necessary part) will not a little help.

4\. After *Preparation*, and especially after separation of the good
from the evil, we are to proceed to the \**Use* of the weight or dose,
that neither more, nor less then is fit, may be given. For above all
things, the Physician ought well to know, whether his Medicament will be
weak or strong, also whether it will do good, or hurt, unless he resolve
to fatten the church yard, and with the loss of his fame, and hazard of
his own soul.

\*

By Use, the Authour understands what others call Dose; for what will a
good Medicine profit you, if you know not in what quantity to administer
it; that the same may rather heal, then hurt or kill. By experience only
to learn this, is a work full of perilous casuality, yet the Discipline
or knowledge of Doses was found out this way first, and afterward easily
taught by Words. Where a living Voice is wanting, it is safer to be too
timerous, then in any wise bold or adventurous, although of Antimony I
can affirm, that being duly prepared it is as harmless a medicine as
Cassia or Manna. The whole caution is chiefly about its use, after the
first preparations; because it may still retain much of its own crude
Venom.

5\. After the Medicament is taken into the body, and hath diffused it
self through all the Members, that it may search out those defects
against which it was administered, the *Utility* comes to be considered;
for it is possible that a Medicament diligently prepared, and exhibited
in due weight, may do more hurt then good in some Diseases, and eem to
be Venom rather then Medicine. Hence an accurate reflexion is to be made
to those things, which profit or help; and they are diligently to be
noted, that we may be mindful to observe the same in other cases.

Yet both in the \**Use* and *Utility*, this one thing is necessary to be
considered, *viz.* whether the Disease be an external and open wound, or
only an internal and latent evil: for as the difference of these is
great, so the way of curation is not the same. Therefore the bottom of
every Disease is to be knwon, that it may be understood, whether the
same may be cured by external remedies only, or must from within be
driven outwards.

\*

That Indication is to be taken from things helping and hurting, is known
even to Tyro’s. But what the Author subjoyns touching internal and
external curation, are not so rude, as not to deserve good Attention:
And also those things which he permixeth with his own Satyrical
Reprehension, if the Reader be so wise as to believe that Basilius
intermixed them to deter the unworthy deriders of Chymistry from
approaching to his sacred Arcanums, he will be wise for himself. For
whilst others rail and swell with indignation, he gathers the fruit of
the Authors Axioms, which as another Agent he scattered among these
Thorns. Whilst you, O lover of Chymistry, peruse these, so long will I
keep silence.

For if the Center of the Disease by within, such a Medicine must be
given, as can search out, apprehend and restore that Center; otherwise
the Physicians labour will be fruitless and in vain.

Moreover, if there be an internal Disease, which ariseth, and is fed
from an internal Original, it must never be driven inward by external
remedies; for great discommodity will thence ensue, and at length Death
itself. Which may be understood by the similitude of a Tree; for if any
one, whilst it germinates or flowers, repels the Humours to the
Interiours, whence they proceeded to the nutriment of the earth; that
Tree will be so far from bringing forth the desired Fruit by the flower,
that a suffocation of the same ariseth from the violent conjunction of
humours not finding any out-let. Therefore there is great difference
between fresh wounds inflicted by Prick, Cut, or any other way, and the
old which derive their Original from within. For the fresh wounds may be
perfectly cured by external remedies only; but in those, which are
nourished from within, an external application of Oyls, Balsoms,
Unguents, and Plaisters profits little, unless the Internal Fountain be
stopped, whence the humours flow to the external parts. When the
Fountain shall be stopped, the Flux will cease, and the evil may easily
be cured with Diet only. It is no great point of Art to heal any fresh
wound; for this every Country-man can easily effect with crude Lard: but
to remove all Symptomes which happen in wounds, and to dry up the
Fountain of the evil, this is the work, and this the labour of the
Artist.

\[DOCTORS REPREHENDED\]

Now come hither, you physicians, how many so ever there be of you, that
arrogate to your selves the Title of Doctor of either Medicine, *viz*.
of internal and external Diseases; understand ye the Title of your
honour, and consult your own Conscience, and see, whether you recieved
that from *GOD*, that is, possess it in verity, or whether you usurp it
as a form, for honour sake. For, as much as Heaven is distant from the
Earth, so vastly different is the Art of healing internal Diseases, from
the Sanation of external wounds. If the Title be given to you by *GOD*,
the same *GOD* will give a Blessing, Felicity, Health and happy events;
but if your Title be vain, and only devised and assumed for ambition,
all things will evilly succeed to you: your honour will fail, and you
will prepare for your self Hell-fire, which can no more be extinguished,
then it can be expressed by words. For Christ said to his Disciples;
*You call me Lord and Master, and ye do well,* Therefore whosoever
assumes a Title of Honour, let him see, whether he do well, and whether
he ascribes not more to himself, than he knows and hath learned, which
is the real abuse of this Title. For he, who will write himself Doctor
of either Medicine, ought to understand, know, and be well skilled in
both, *viz*. the Internal and External Medicine. Nor should he be
ignorant of Anatomy, that he may be able to shew the Constitution of the
Body, and discover from what Member every Disease proceeds, together
with its Fountain and cause. Also remedies, with which he may cure the
Disease, and circumstances of external Wounds, are to be understood by
him. Good *GOD*! where will the Title be found, what will become of the
Master, when an exact Trial shall be made, for discovering the ignorance
of these *Doctors* of either

Medicine?

In times past, long before my days, the Doctors of Medicine did
themselves cure External wounds, and judged that a part of their Office;
but in these times, they take Servants, whom they employ in these
things, and this way the noblest of Arts is become a Mechanick
Operation; and some of those who exercise it, are indeed so very rude,
as they know not Letters, and scarcely know how (according to the
Proverb) to drive an Ass out of the Corn. These, I say, profess,
themselves Masters in curing wounds, and Doctors of Doctors; and to
speak the truth as it is, they may by a better right glory in this
Title, they thou magnificent Doctor, umbratical Chyrugion, and most
ignorant Boaster of Titles, why do you style yourself Doctor of either
medicine? What more now Master Doctor, what say you, most expert
Chyrurgion? I pray be not offended at this, or take it amiss; for you
your self will quickly confess, if you do but seriously consider wounds
made by Prick or Cut, that you have as much knowledge in the cure of
them, as is in the Brain of a dunghill Cock, which Children learning
their A.B.C. are wont to set in the Frontispiece of their Primer.

\[TRUE DOCTRINE, WHEREIN IT CONSISTS\]

Therefore I persuade all Men, of what state or condition soever, who are
desirous of Learning, from your Masters to search out the true Doctrine,
which consists in *Preparation*, and afterward in the *Use*;

\[OPERATIONS AND UTILITY GIVE EXPERIENCE\] so they, or you, shall
possess the Title assumed with honour, and Men will undoubtedly have
confidence in you, and you will in very deed do them good, then will you
to the Eternal Creator give thanks cordially without feigning. But let
every Man seriously think with himself, what it is he ought to do, and
what he is to omit, and whether he doth justly or unjustly use the Title
assumed. For he, who assumes any Title, ought especially to understand
the condition of that Title, and why he assumed it, or what the true
foundation is. It is not sufficient, if anyone iwth the vulgar say
(saving your reverence, let the more delicate Men pardon us, if we
intending to speak to the purpose, make mention of putrefaction) this is
egregious dung, it hath a strong and grievous ill savour, and know not
how it comes to pass, that a Man, who perhaps eats food of a most
grateful taste and odour, and well accommodated to his natural Appetite,
thence makes excrement endued with qualities so contrary, and yielding
an odour so very ungrateful, and repugnant to Nature: of which there is
no other reason, then natural putrefaction and corruption. The same
happens in all Aromatical well smelling things. It is the Philosophers
part to enquire, what odour is, and whence it receives its virtues, and
in what the virtue of it may be made manifest to true profit. For the
Earth is nourished and fattened by stinking dung, and noble Fruit is
produced of it. Of this matter there is not one cause only, but our Book
would swell to an huge Volume, if we should but briefly hint at all
natural Generations and mutations; yet *Digestion* and *Putrefaction*
are the principal keys of them. For the *Fire* and *Air* make a certain
*Maturation*, by which a Transmutation of the *Earth* and *Water* may
follow; and this is also a certain mutation, by which of evil smelling
Dung a most fragrant Balsam may be produced; and on the contrary, of
most grateful Balsam ill favoured Dung. But perhaps you will say, why do
I produce examples of so very rude and absurd? I do confess the example
is taken from a Cottage, rather then a Royal Court; yet a prudent
considerer of things, more accurately diving into the matter, will
easily understand, what such examples intimate to him, *viz.* that of
the highest things the lowest are made, and the lowest the highest, so
that, of a Medicament is produced of Venome, and of Venome Medicine; of
the sweet, bitter, acid, and corrosive; and on the contrary of the
corrosive, another thing more profitable.

\[NATURE ABSCONDED FROM MEN\]

O good *GOD*, how much is Nature absconded from Men, so that she seems
to disdain to be wholly seen by us? But since thou hast ordained so very
short a time of our Life, and thou the Judge of all, reservest many
things to thy self in the Creatures, which thou hast left to be admired,
not known, by us, and of which thou alone wilt be the beholder and
Judge, grant unto me, that unto my Life’s end I may keep thee and my
Saviour in my Heart, that besides health and necessaries of the body,
which though hast liberally bestowed, I may also acquire the health of
my Soul and Spiritual Riches; of which inestimable good I am freed from
all doubt by that thy mercy, in which, for my soul, for me a miserable
sinner, thou didst (on the Tree of the Cross) shed Sulphur and Balsom;
which is indeed a mortiferous Venom to the Devil, but to us Sinners, a
most present remedy. I do certainly heal my Brethren, as far as concerns
the Soul, by Prayer, and in relation to the body, with apt Remedies;
therefore I hope they will on their parts use their endeavour, that they
with me, and I with them, may at length inhabit the Tabernacle of the
Most High, and in him our *GOD* enjoy Eternity.

\[SPIRIT VIVIFICATIVE, AND OPERATIVE\] But to return to my Philosophy of
*Antimony*, I would have the Reader, before all other things, to
understand, that all things contain in themselves operative and
vivificative Spirits; which inhabiting in the Body feed and nourish
themselves, and are sustained by the Body. Elements themselves want not
these Spirits, which (the living *GOD* permitting that) whether they be
good or evil, have their Habitation in tehm. Men and Animals have in
them a living operating Spirit, which receding from them, nothing but a
Carkass remains. In Herbs, and all things bearing Fruit, a Spirit of
Sanity exists; otherwise they could not, by any Preparation, be reduced
to Medicinal use. Metals and all Minerals, are endued and possessed with
their own incomprehensible Spirit, in which, the power and virtue of all
their possible effects, consists. For whatsoever is without Spirit,
wants Life, and contains in itself no vivifying Virtue. Therefore, you
are to know, that in *Antimony* also there is a Spirit, which effects
whatsoever in it, or can proceed from it, in an invisible way and
manner, no otherwise, than as in the *Magnet* is absconded a certain
invisible power, as we shall more largely treat in its own place, where
we speak of the *Magnet*.

\[SPIRITS OF VARIOUS KINDS\]

But there are various kinds of Spirits;\* visible to the Intellect, and
endued with Spiritual knowledge, which notwithstanding cannot (when they
will) be touched or apprehended, as Natural Men are touched; \[SPIRITS
OF THE ELEMENTS\] especially they, who have their fixed Residence in
Elements, as are the Spirits of Fire, Lights and other Objects formally
darting out Light from themselves: such are *Airy* Spirits, who inhabit
the Air; *Aqueous* Spirits living in Waters; and *Terrene* Spirits
living in the Earth, which we Men call *Earthly* Men, which are chiefly
found in wealthy mines of the Earth, where they shew and discover
themselves to us.

\*What follow, seem somewhat confused, according to the Sentiments of
certain Theologicians, who have held various opinions of Spirits
residing in the Fire, Air, and other Elements; adjudging them to the
Eternal Fire of Hell. All which with Basilius, we leave as unknown, to
the Judgement of the Divine Knowledge. But what he himself subjoyns,
touching the wonderful virtue and power of Antimonial and all other
Chymical Spirits, which we our selves with so great admiration have
often seen, we understand only of material Spirits; which certainly are
endued with as great virtues, and effect things no less wonderful then
those Spirits, which Phantastick persons (oppressed with Melancholy)
affirm they see and talk with; yea I cannot remember that I ever found
written or declared (by such, as taking a liberty of lying, endeavour to
please or terrify others) any greater or more wonderful virtues then
these Spirits have.

\[SPIRITS WANTING SPEECH\]

These Spirits are endued with Senses and Understanding, know Arts, and
can change themselves into divers Forms, until the time of their
Judgement; but whether a definitory sentence ought to be pronounced
against them as yet, or no, that I leave to the Providence of the Divine
Majesty, from whom nothing is hid. There are other Spirits, wanting
speech, which cannot shew themselves visibly in the very act; and they
are those which live in Animals, as in Men and the like, in Plants also
and in Minerals; nevertheless they have in themselves an occult and
operative Life, and manifest and discover themselves by their
efficacious power of operating, which they contain in and bear about
themselves, and most apparently give testimony of their virtue of
healing, whensoever that (by help of the Art) is extracted from them,
being accurately seperated from their body. After the same manner, the
efficacious Spirit, and operative power of *Antimony*, manifests its
gifts, and distributes them among Men, being first loosed from its own
body, and freed from all its bonds, so, that it is able to penetrate,
and render fit to be applyed to those Uses, which the Artificer proposed
to himself in Preparation.

\[ARTIST AND VULCAN OUGHT TO AGREE\]

But the Artist and *Vulcan* ought to agree: \[FIRE MAKES SEPERATION\]
the Fire gives seperation for an operative power, and the Artificer
forms the matter. \[EXAMPLE, OF A BLACKSMITH\] As a Black-smith useth
one sort of Fire, also Iron only is his matter, which he intends for
forming divers Instruments. For some times of it he makes a Spit, at
another time Horse-shoes, another time a Saw, and at length innumerable
other things, every of which serves for that Use, unto which the Smith
intended it, although the matter is but one, which he prepares for so
many divers uses. So of *Antimony* various works may be made for
different uses: in which the Artist is the Smith that forms; \[VULCAN,
THE KEY\] *Vulcan* is as it were the key which opens; and Operations and
Utility give experience, and knowledge of the Use. O! if foolish and
vain Men had but Ears to hear, and true eyes with understanding, not
only for hearing what I write, but for understanding the *Arcanum* and
knowledge of the use; assuredly they would not suck in those
insalubrious and turbid Potions, but hasten to these limped Fountains,
and drink of the Well of Life.

\[DOCTORS REPREHENDED\]

Therefore let the World know, that I shallprove those pretended Doctors,
who seem to be wise, to be mrere Fools and Idiots,and cause many
unlearned Men (but such as are studious Disciples of my Doctrine) to
become true Doctors in very deed. Wherefore I here solemnly cite and
invite all Men, who earnestly aspire to knowledge, with a chearful mind,
good Conscience, and certain hope, to embrace and become Spectators of
our Doctrine, and accurately to peruse my Writings and Informations; for
so, at length, they (being possesors of what they sought) will extol and
commend me after death, rendering my mortal name immortal, with their
perpetual remembrance of my praises, as long as the World endures. But
if when I am dead, any one be pleased to institute a disputation in the
Schools against me, my writings will fully answer all his Objections,
and I am assured my Disciples will never forget the benefit received
from me, by which they will obtain the Empire of Truth, which ever was
to me, and always will be to them, sufficient to suppress a Lie to the
Worlds end.

\[ANTIMONY OF 2 KINDS\]

Also let the well meaning and sincere observer of Art know, that there
are two kinds of Antimony very different from each other: one is fair,
pure, and of a golden property, and that contains very much *Mercury*,
but the other which hath much *Sulphur* is not so friendly to gold as
the first, and is distinguished by fair long and white shining streaks.
Therefore one is more fit for Medicine and *Alchemy*, then the other: as
when the Flesh of Fishes iscompared with the Flesh of other Animals,
although both these are, and are called Flesh, yet each of these very
much differs from the Flesh of the other; even so of *Antimony* the
difference is the same. Many do indeed write of the Interior virtue of
*Antimony*, but few of tehm ever taught the true Foundation of the
virtues with which it is endued, or found out which way, or in what
manner it recieves them; So that their Doctrine is founded upon words
only, exists without any true foundation, and they themselves lose the
fruit they hopes to receive by such Writings. For to write truly of
*Antimony* is a work that requires profound Meditations, a mind largely
unfolding itself, and knowledge of its manifold *Preparation*, and of
the true *Soul* of it, in which all the Utility is cited, and which
being known you may be able to give an indubitate Judgement, of what
evil or good, Venom or Medicine is latent therein. It is not a matter of
small moment by a true *Examen* to search into *Antimony*, and thereby
to penetrate fundamentally into its Essence, and through earnest study
to attain the final knowledge thereof, that the Venenosity of the same
(against which unskilful Men ignorantly exclaim) may be taken away, and
it be changed and prepared into a better State, becoming a Medicine fit
for use and void of Venom.

\[ARTISTS VEX, WREST AND TORMENT ANTIMONY\]

Many Artists intending to Anatomize *Antimony*, have divers ways vexed,
wrested and tormented the same, in such wise as it cannot be well
described in Words, much less believed; yet, the matter being truely
examined, they effected nothing. For they sought not its true Soul, and
therefore could not find the feigned Soul of it, which themselves
sought. By the black Colours a mist was cast before their Eyes, so that
they could neither observe the true Soul itself, nor know it. \[ANTIMONY
COMPARED TO A CIRCLE\] For *Antimony* like unto *Mercury*, may fitly be
compared to a round Circle, of which there is no end; in which the more
diligently any Man seeks, the more he finds, if Process be made by him
in a right way and due order. Yet the Life of no one Man is sufficient
for him to learn all the mysteries thereof. It is Venom and a most swift
poison, also it is void of Venom and a most excellent Medicine; whether
it be used outwardly or inwardly. Which is a thing hid form most Men by
reason of their own blindness; and they judge it an incredible, foolish
and vain work, because (through their ignorance) it is unknown to them,
who can no otherwise be excused, then that they deserve the name of
Stupidity: yet that is not to be suffered in them, because they desire
not to learn or be better informed, either here, or elsewhere.

\[ANTIMONY ENDUED WITH THE 4 FIRST QUALITIES\]

Antimony is endued with all the four first qualities; it is cold and
humid, and against it is hot and dry, and accommodates it self to the
four Seasons of the year, also it is volatile and fixed. The volatile
part of it is not void of Venom, but the fixed is free from all
venenosity; which is so very strange, as it may be reputed one of the
seven Wonders of the World, of which so many Writers have discoursed,
not knowing themselves what they writ. \[ANTIMONYS VIRTUES
INEXHAUSTIBLE\] There hath been no \*Man before me, and at this day
there is none found, who hath so thoroughly learned the power, virtue,
strength, operations, and efficacy of *Antimony*, or so profoundly
penetrated into all the *Energy* thereof, as nothing more is latent in
it unfound out, or which cannot be brought to light by experience. If
such a Man could be found he would be worthy to be carried about in a
*Triumphal Chariot*, as in times past was granted to Monarchs and potent
Heroes, after they had happily fought Battles, and were returned with
Victory. But I fear, that many of our Doctors will be constrained to
provide a Chariot for themselves.

\*

Here the Author speaks largely in commendation of Antimony. Read, read
(I say) O Lover of Chymistry, and you will find nothing Hyperbolical,
nor anything Thrasnick. Basilius in speaking as he doth, hath not
exhausted the Praises of Antimony; because no Man unto this day could
ever experience all its Virtues. We have seen many of its Effects, and
many new Effects are daily found by curious Searchers, yet many more
remain unknown. So that, as in Fire is an inexhaustible Fountain; (for
the more you take from it, the more it gives) so in Antimony is an
inestimable Treasure of new Virtues. For if from it you extract its
Acetum a thousand times, it will a thousand times, yield new Acetum.
Nature seems to have made choice of this Mineral, therein to hide all
her Treasures. Therefore not without reason hath Basilius made for it a
Triumphant Chariot, which is daily enriched with Spoyls taken from the
Camps of Ignorance.

For the Masters of this terrene World are so intangled with their own
Thoughts, that they seek nothing from Antimony but Riches, and forget to
search its utility for medicine, and the Health of the Body, which
notwithstanding ought above all things to be sought, that (being brought
to Light) the wonderful Works of our *GOD* may be made manifest, and the
Glory given to him, with great thankfulness. It is not to be denyed, but
that more of Riches and Health may be found in it than either you all,
or I myself, can believe: for I profess my self no other than a Disciple
in the Knowledge of Antimony, although in it I have seen, experienced
and learned more than you, and all such as you are (who arrogate to
yourselves great skill therein) either have learned, or ever can learn.
Yet no Man should therefore be troubled, or despair of Benefits; but
because the World, indulging their own Ingratitude, have neither
esteemed, nor with due Reverence acknowledged the Munificence of the
Most High, but have preferred Riches before Health, *GOD* hath spread as
it were a Spider’s Webb before their Eyes, that being blind they might
not know the Secrets of Nature absconded in the Form of this Mineral.

\[RICHES REQUIRED BY ALL\]

All men cry out Rich, Rich we would be. I confess you all aspire to
Riches, and with the Epicure say, *The Body must first be provided for,
the Soul may at length also find somewhat*; and with *Midas* (as in the
Fable) you desire that all things whatsoever you touch may be turned
into Gold. Hence it is, that so many seek their desired Riches in
*Anatomy*: But because they accept not that Gift of the Creator with a
grateful Heart, which before all Things should be procured, and cast the
Love of their Neighbour behind their back, therefore they in vain look
the Horse in the Mouth; for they know his Age and Strength no more than
the Guests at the Marriage-Feast in *Cana* of *Galilee* knew the
wonderful Work, which *Christ* there wrought, when he turned Water into
Wine. They knew, that Wine was Water, and that the Water was turned into
Wine, they perceived by the Taste; but how that Transmutation happened
was hid from them. For the Lord JESUS, our Saviour, reserved the
Supernatural Work to himself, as a Testimony of his Omnipotency.
Wherefore I say, it is every Man’s duty, to search out the Mysteries and
*Arcanums*, which the Creator hath insited in all Creatures; for
although (as we said) it is not Credible, that we Men can thoroughly
learn and penetrate all Things; yet we are not forbid to inquire into
them, since by Study and Diligence so much may be effected, as although
through some defect a Man may be hindred in such wise, as he cannot
attain to the desired Riches and perfect Sanity, yet he may acquire
enough to occasion him not to repent of his Labour, but rather to
minister unto him matter of Joy and Rejoycing, that he sees himself so
far an *Adeptist*, as he stands always obliged to render thanks to his

Creator.

\[SOLUTION WHEN NECESSARY\]

Therefore, whosoever desires to become a perfect Anatomist of
*Antimony*, the first thing to be considered by him is Solution of the
Body; and in order to this, he must take it in a convenient place, and
propose to himself the right way, that he be not seduced into devious
Paths. Secondly he must observe the Governance of the Frie, taking Care
that it be neither too much, nor too little, or too hot, or too cold.
For the summ of all is sited in an exact Governance of the Fire; by
which the vivifying *Spirits* of *Antimony* are extracted, and loosed
from their bonds, and so rendered capable to manifest their Effects
operatively. Also he must take great Care, that this Operative Virtue be
not mortifyed and persih Adustion. \[DOSE, OBSERVABLE\] Thirdly the Use
or Dose is to be observed by him, that he may administer it in due
manner, knowing the Measure, as I above mentioned, when I spake of the
five principal Heads requisite in the Exercise and Practise of
Chymistry; but here I only hint at it cursorily by way of a parable.

By *Resolution* the sum of the Matter is proposed, but by Fire it is
prepared to profit. For a Butcher cuts out an Ox, and divides it into
parts, but no Man can profitably enjoy this Flesh, unless he first boyl
it by Fire, by which Operation the Red substance of the Flesh is changed
and prepared into white Aliment. If a Man constrained by hunger, should
eat that Raw and Red flesh, it would be Venom to him rather than
Medicine; because the natural Heat of the Stomach is too weak to concoct
and digest that crude Body. Hence, my dear Friend, you may conclude,
that since *Antimony* hath greater Venom, and a more gross Mineral Body
than Animal Flesh (as by the above recited common Example I have already
shewed) it will also prove more perillous, if used Crude, without remain
Venom, which will suddenly kill the Sick. \[VINEGAR, NOT TRANSMUTABLE
INTO WINE\] Therefore the Venenosity of *Antimony* is so to be taken
away, as it may never against be converted into Venom, after the same
manner, as Wine, which being once, by putrefaction and corruption turned
into Vinegar, never afterward yields any Spirit of Wine, but always is
and remains Vinegar. but on the Contrary, if the Spirit only of the Wine
be seperated, and the Aquosity left by itself, and the same Spirit
afterward exalted, it will never in any wise be changed into Vinegar,
although it should be kept an hundred Years; but will always remain
Spirit of Wine, no otherwise, then as Vinegar remains Vinegar.

\[WINE, TRANSMUTABLE INTO VINEGAR, HOW\]

This Transmutation of Wine into Vinegar is a wonderful Thing; because
somewhat is produced from Wine, which was not before in its vegetable
Essence. In which it is also to be noted, that in distillation of Wine
the Spirit first comes forth; but (on the contrary) in distilling
Vinegar the Phlegm first comes, afterward the Spirit, as I have shewed
above in its own place, where I also made mention of this Example.
\[SPIRIT OF WINE, VOLATILZE\] Therefore Spirit of Wine makes Bodies
volatile, because itself is volatile; \[SPIRIT OF VINEGAR, FIX\] but
Spirit of Vinegar fixeth all Medicaments, as well of Minerals as
Vegetables, and renders them solid, so that they apprehend things fixed,
and expel fixed Diseases.

\[ANTIMONY CONTAINS ITS OWN VINEGAR\]

\*Consider and observe these things diligently; for this principal Key
is of great concern. Therefore *Antimony*, which contains in itself its
own Vinegar, ought to be so prepared, as all its Venenosity may be taken
away, and he, who useth it, conceives no Venom thereby, but rather
drives away and casts out all Poison from himself, by the use thereof.

\*

Beleive not only Basilius, but me also, with the same Faith and
sincerity affirming to you; this is the first Key, this is the principla
part of the whole Art, this opens to you the first Gate, this will also
unlock the last, which leads to the Palace of the King. But as I said,
not only beleive, but also consider and observe. Here you stand in the
Entrance, if you miss the Door, all your Course will be Error, all your
Hast Ruine, and all your Wisdom Foolishness. He who obtains this Key,
and knows the Method (which is called Manual Operation) by which to use
it, and has strength to turn the same, will acquire Riches, and an open
Passage unto the Mysteries of Chymistry.

Therefore Preparation of Antimony consists in the Key of Alchimy, by
which it is dissolved, opened, divided and seperated; as in
*Calcination, Reverberation, Sublimation, etc.* as we declared above it.
Also in extracting its Essence, and in vivifying its Mercury; which
Mercury must afterward be precipited into a fixed powder. Likewise by
Arts and due Method, of it may be made an Oyl, which is effectual wholly
to consume that new and unknown Disease, which the *French*, in their
Warlike Expeditions, brought into our Regions. The same is visible in
other Preparations, derived from the *Spagyrick* Arts and Alchimy; as
for Example: \[EXAMPLE, OF BEER\] If anyone would make Beer of Barley,
Wheat, or other Corn, all these degress must be most perfectly known to
him, before he can from those Grains extract their most subtil Essence
and virtue, and reduce the same into a most efficacious Drink. First,
the Grains must be so long steeped in Water, as until they be able
sufficiently, to open and resolve themselves (as I, when I was a Young
Man, travelling into *England* and *Holland*, diligently observed to be
done in those places) this is called *Putrefaction* and *Corruption*.
This Key being used, the Water is drawn off from the Grain, and the
macerated Corn is laid on Heaps close together, and left so for a due
time, until it spontaneously conceive heat, and by the same heat,
germinating, the Grains adhere each to other: this is *Digestion.* This
being finished, the Grains which adhered in their Germination, are
separated, and dryed, either in the Air, or by Heat of Fire, and so
hardened. This is *Reverberation*, and *Coagulation.* \[CALCINATION,
VEGETABLE, WHAT\] When the Corn is thus prepared, it is carried to the
Mill, that it may be broak and ground small; this is *Vegetable*
*Calcination*. Afterward, by heat of Fire cocting these Grains, the more
noble Spirit of them is extracted, and the Water is imbibed with the
same; which without the aforesaid Preparation could not have been. This
way the crude Water is converted into Beer, and this Operation (though I
speak but rudely) is and is called *Distillation*. \[HOPS, THE VEGETABLE
SALT OF BEER\] The *Hops*, when added to the Beer, is the *Vegetable*
Salt thereof, which conserves and preserves from all Contraries,
endeavouring to corrupt the same. This way of boyling Water into Drink,
by extraction of the Spirits from the Grains, the *Spaniards* and
*Italians* know not, and in my native soil of *Germany* about the
*Rhine*, few are found skilled in this Art.

After all these works are performed, a new *Seperation* is made by
*Clarification*, viz. of the Drink, in this manner: a little *Yeast* or
*Ferment* is added, which excites an internal motion and Heat in the
Beer, so that it is elevated in it self, and (by the help of time)
*Separation* of the dense from the rare, and of the pure from the impure
is made; and by this means the Beer acquires a constant virtue in
Operating, so that it penetrates and effects all those *Ends*, for which
it was made and brought into use: which before could not have been;
because the Spirit, the Operator was hindered, by its own Impurity, from
effecting its proper Work.

In Wine also doth not Experience teach the same? That cannot, before the
time come, in which the Impuritys may be separated from it, so very
perfectly and efficaciously perform its own Work, as after Separation of
the pure from the impure: which by Drunkeness is manifest; for Beer or
Wine unsettled, and not purifyed, give not forth from themselves so much
Spirit for inebriating, as after Clarification. But of this no more.
After all the aforesaid, a new Operation may be instituted, by Vegetable
sublimation, for separation of the spirit of the Wine or Beer, and for
preparing it by Distillation into another Drink of *Burning Wine*, which
may also be made of the Lees or Dregs of Wine and Beer. When this is
done, the Operative Virtue is separated from its own Body, and the
Spirit being extracted by Fire, forsakes its own unprofitable dead
Habitation, in which it was commodiously hospited before. Now, if this
*Burning Wine*, or Spirit of Wine, be rectifyed, an Exaltation is made
by often distilling it, and by a certain method of Operating, the pure
part (free from all Phlegm and Aquosity) may be so concentred, and as it
were condensed, as one Measure of it may effect more, then twenty or
more could have done before. For it sooner inebriates, and is swift,
volatile and subtil for penetrating and operating.

\*Here I admonish you, whosoever you are, who desire to be taught by my
Writings, and hope to obtain Riches and a true Medicine from *Antimony*,
that you would not carelessly peruse my Intention, in which is no letter
writ in vain, and which hath not a certain singular signification for
your Instruction.

\*

Come hither you Traveller, stay your Journey here. Contemn not or
flighty pass over this tautological, but not impertinent, Admonition;
often in your mind have recourse to this Description of Beer, search,
contemplate, and weigh all Things, perhaps in this turbid and famous
Gulf, you will find the Fish you look not for. If in this Light you yet
be blind, I know not any Collyrium will profit you: if with so certain a
manuduction you cannot pass on to the work itself, I know not who will
lend you a Staff, or what Demonstration can direct the Journey of a
Stupid Man. Believe, read, meditate, labour, and spare the use of so
many Chymical Books, which distract you with the Error of various ways,
this one tells you all things.

Yea, I here solemnly affirm, that there are many words dispersed here
and there in my Writings, to which if the Reader give heed as he ought,
and know in what Fundamentals the principal Heads of the matter are
sited, and as it were buried, he will have no Cause to repent his often
turning over the same Leaves, but will esteem every word as much, as a
piece of Gold coin. For you know, that althought the Examples by me
proposed, sound harsh, as delivered in a rude manner, yet they contain
in them somewhat that is excellent and of great Moment. Yet I am not
here ambitious to procure Authority or praise to my Writings, which is
not my Business, nor would it become me: for when the Operation of them
shall be brought to Light, they will acquire praise enough to
themselves. \[EXAMPLES OF BEER, WHY PRODUCED\] I purposely and willingly
produce Examples so rude and common, because the power of *Antimony* and
the true Virtue thereof, deeply and profoundly abscoded in its inmost
parts, is to be searched out. I was willing, by these gross Examples to
lead you by the hand, and shew you the way, that by them you might
attain to the Thing itself, and not at the very first err from the Gate;
for so doing you would long wander, and never bring your Operation to
the desired End. \[ANTIMONY COMPARED TO A BIRD IN THE AIR\] For
*Antimony* is like a Bird, which is carryed through the *Air* and as the
Wind drives it, so it turns itself which way that wills: here, in this
Case, Man acts the Part of the *Air* or Wind and can drive and move
*Antimony*, at his pleasure, and repose it in such a place, as himself
chooseth: he can imbibe it, with a yellow, red, white or black Colour,
according as he desires it should be, and as he rules and governs the
Fire; because in *Antimony* (as in *Mercury)* all Colours are found,
which no Man should wonder at, considering how many Things *Nature*
bears absconded in her Bosom, which neither you nor I are able to
comprehend in many days.

\[ANTIMONY COMPARED TO A BOOK\] If a book happen to be given to a Man,
that is unlearned, he knows not what is signified by that Writing, or
what that Scripture intends; for it is hid from his Eyes, and he stands
amazed, as a Cow at the sight of a new Door. But if unto that unlearned
Man, anyone suggest the Explication of the Book, and teach him not only
the matter contained therein, but also the use of the same, the Man no
more admires it, as an Art; but by this means it becomes to him a Common
Thing, the Reason and Operation of which he understands, and by his own
Study can learn, conceive, and comprehend the Utility so perfectly, as
now none of those Things, which were contained in the Book , are hid
from him; because he hath learned both to read and understand what is
written therein. Such a Book is *Antimony* to those, who know not of the
Art of Reading; therefore I faithfully admonish all, who desire to be
partakers of its Utilities, to bend their mind to know and pronounce the
letters thereof, that so they may acquire the Art of Reading that Book;
and in such a manner, that (as in a School) they may be removed from
Form to Form, when he who hath rightly gained Experience, shall preside
as *Rector*, and judge of that, which in Trial is most worthy: for One
is worthy to be preferred before another, in the Possession of that.

\[DOCTORS REPREHENDED\] But here, what comes into my mind, and ought in
no wise to be passed over in Silence, I think good to mention; *viz*:
that at this Day many are found who exclaim, and rashly pronounce
*Crucifige, Crucifige,* against all those, who prepare Venoms into
Medicaments, by which (as they say) many Mortals perish, or, if they
escape with Life, live miserably; such are *Mercury, Arsenick, Antimony,
etc*. and this Clamour is chiefly made by those, who (if it please the
GODS) are called *Doctors\** of Medicine, yet indeed understand not what
the difference is, between Venom, and Medicine, but are wholly ignorant
how Venom may be prepared, so as to pass into a salutary Medicament; and
instead of its malignity, put on a better Nature.

\*Basilius somewhat indulgeth his own Genius, inveighing against
False-Phyisicians, whose ignorance (in his time) was so very greate, as
they contemned every sublime Preparation of Medicine, which he himself,
and Chymists with him did profess; proscribing the same as unprofitable,
perillous, and hurtful: against whome, it is not strange, if the
Chymists (on the other hand) rose up with some small vehemency, and
endeavour courageously, by assistance of their Knowledge, and
Conscience, to break through that rout of unskilful Men; but the best
Things are not allways the most prosperous. Chymists overcame by the
Justice of their Cause, but were overcome by Number: yet, having verity
and goodness on their side, thy fought with so great Confidence, as they
were certainly assured they should bear away the Victory; which our
Author here shews, and Paracelsus (prophesying of the Coming of Elias
the Artist) did presage would be. And certainly unto me (seriously
considering how greatly chymists have in these times improved their
Knowledge) the Dawning of that Day hath opened itself, since I behold so
many Rays of the approaching Sun.

\[VENOM PREPARED RESISTS POISON\] Against these I do in a special manner
exclaim and protest, against these, I say, who (ignorance of
*Preparation*) exhibit *Poison* to Men: for *Mercury, Auripigment,
Antimony*, and such like, are venoms in their Substance, and unless
rightly prepared remain Venoms. Yet after a Legitimate Preparation, all
their Venenosity is broke, extinguished and expelled, so that no part of
them remains, but what is *Medicine*, which resists all internal Venoms,
although most deeply rooted, and radically destroys the same. For
*Venom*, being in such a manner prepared, as it can no longer hurt,
resists all *Poison*, which is not as yet prepared, and so very well
prepares and subjugates it, as it is compelled with the same to put off
its own venomous Nature.

\[DOCTORS REPREHENDED\]

Here I shall raise a great Contention among the Learned; for I know they
will doubt what these my Words should signify, as whether what I affirm
and write be possible to be done or no; and they will be divided into
several Opinions there-about. Some will judge it is in no wise possible,
that from those Things, of which we treat, the venenosity should be
wholly taken away; nor do I wonder, that they persist in that Opinion,
since the Doctrine of like Preparations is absolutely unknown to them,
who have not the least thought of that, which leads to the Knowledge of
thse more profound Mysteries. Yet a small part of these Men will with me
be constrained to acknowledge, it is possible a vile Thing may be
changed into a Better. For you (you *Doctors* I mean) must confess to
me, that your purpose is to reduce that Evil, from which the Disease had
its Original, into a better State. Go to then; will you not also grant,
that if any Evil be in those Things, of which *Medicine* is to be made,
the same Evil must be converted into a better State, that it may so much
the better perform its operation, and more powerfully and profitably
act, without any notable peril? But since unto very few as yet is known,
or by Experience found, the Way, by which a Man ought to proceed in
these Preparations, a very small part of these will assume and contend
for the Opinion I here affirm, and publicly profess: for very many will
be carryed away with the greater Rout, crying, *Venom, Venom!* which
Voices, whilst I hear them, put me in mind of those wild Clamours, by
which the *Jews* required the *Saviour* and *Redeemer* of the World,
that he might suffer the Punishment of the *Cross*, often crying out
*Crucify him, Crucify him,* whom they proclaimed to be the highest, most
present, most pernitious, and cursed *Venom*, when as indeed he was the
noblest, supreme, most glorious and most profitable *Medicine* of our
*Souls*, which was to deliver us from the Death of *Sinners*, from the
*Devil,* *Hell¸* and all *Misfortunes*. Although those proud *Pharisees*
and Lawyers neither could nor would understand this, nevertheless he
both then was, and will be to the end of the *World*, and after it to
all *Eternity*, the same superexcellent *Medicine*: and neither the
*Devil,* nor Death, nor the very Gates of *Hell*, nor any *Creature*,
how powerful, or perverse soever, can effect anything at all, whereby to
overthrow this Truth.

\[KINGS, AND PRINCES, MISINFORMED BY DOCTORS\]

So I hope, yea doubt not (although all vagabond and circumforaneous
*Medicasters*, all *Physicians* resident in *Cities*, and how many
soever there be, that profess themselves *Masters* of any part of
*Medicine*, do all together contrive what they can, and exclaim against
*Antimony*) but that the same *Antimony* will triumph over the
ingratitudes of all those unskilful Men (for true *Physicians* and such
as are always ready to learn, I touch not here) and by its own power and
virtue acquired after due preparation, will overcome and tread under
foot all its Enemies. But, on the contrary, those ignorant false Judges,
and pertinacious contemners of *Antimony*, because they know not the
Truth, together with the proud and blood-thirsty *Jews*, shall perish,
and be cast into the Abyss of Hell. How ridiculous those magnificent,
and to themselves only wise *Doctors,* seem to me, who deterr *Emperors,
Kings, Princes* and all other *Great Men*, and seriously admonish them
not so much as to touch such *Medicines* with their Lips, because they
are noxious, venomous, and every way perillous, I will not here declare,
since I see them only to judge according to their own Opinion, without
entertaining any Observations of other things, the Knowledge of which
they have not before acquired by their own Contemplation, and therefore
cannot judge of any thing else, or otherwise than they have learned.
Therefore to these I say, if there be any Man, that hath taken so strong
a *Poison*, as present Death is necessarily expected to follow, I will
(provided the Man be left wholly to my Care) give him an *Antidote* by
me prepared which shall continually resist that *Venom*, and quickly
expel it out of the Body. But I little care, whether you Mr. *Doctor*,
who do neither know this Thing, nor ever would apply your mind to know
it, do slight the same, and repute it as a ridiculous, and altogether
false tale; it is sufficient for me, that I am able (but if praise
worthy, let praise be given to *GOD*) to prove and defend the Truth
thereof. For I myself have experienced it, I have made, I have prepared,
I have prescribed this Medicine, and there wants not a sufficient number
of Witnesses to confirm it under Hand and Seal.

\[DOCTORS REPREHENDED\]

And whensoever I shall have occasion to contend in the School with such
a Doctor, who knows not how himself to prepare his own Medicines, but
commits that Business to another, I am sure I shall obtain the Palm from
him: for indeed that good Man knows not what Medicines he prescribes to
the Sick; whether the Colour of them be white, black, grey or blue, he
cannot tell; nor doth this wretched man know, he only knows, that he
found it so written in his Books, and thence pretends Possession (or as
it were Possession) by Prescription of a very long time: yet he desires
no further Information. Here again let it be lawful to exclaim, good
*GOD*, to what a state is the matter brought! what goodness of mind is
in these men! what care do they take of the Sick! Wo, wo to them! in the
day of Judgement they will find the fruit of their ignorance and
rashness; they they will see him whom they pierced, when they neglected
their Neighbour, sough after Money and nothing else; whereas were tehy
cordial in their Profession, they would spend Nights and Days in Labour,
that they might become more learned in their Art, whence more certain
health would accrew to the Sick Labour is tedious to them, they commit
the matter to Chance, and being secure of their Honour and content with
their Fame, they (like Brawlers) defend themselves with a certain
Garrulity, without any respect had to Conscience or Truth; Coals seem
wonderful strange, and as out-landish Wares to them, therefore they
spare the Money, that should be bestowed in them, as if they intended to
lay it out to a better use. *Vulcan* himself, *viz*. the Prepairer of
Medicaments, is not found among them; for their Fornaces stand in the
Apothecaries Shop, to which tehy seldom or never come. A Paper Scrol in
which their usual *Recipe* is written, serves their purpose to the full,
which Bill being by some Apothecaries Boy or Servant recieved, he with
great noise thumps out of his Mortar every Medicine, and all the Health
of the Sick.

\[AUTHORS PRAYER\]

My *GOD*, change, change these times, and put an end to this arrogant
Pride, overturn those Trees, lest they swell up to Heaven, throw down
those Giants lest tehy accumulate all Mountains; and defend those, who
seriously managing their Business, faithfully serve thee, that they may
be able to stand against these their Persecutors. I seriously admonish
all those in our Monastery, bound by the same Vows with me, that they
would with my self Night and Day pray unto *GOD*, that he would so
illuminate these Enemies of true Medicine, as tehy may execrate their
own Error, and acknowledge the Glory of *GOD*, and his Power insited in
the Creatures, and perceive the Clearness latent in them, by Preparation
and Anatomy (as it were speaking in their Ears) which otherwise
surrounded and covered over with external Impurities, would deeply be
concealed, and never brought to Light. But I trust the *Creator* of all
Things, (both of those which fall under our Sense, and of those that are
remote from our Senses) will benignly hear our Prayers; that, if not
whilst I and my Brethren live, yet after our Death, such a Conversion of
Things and Men (*GOD* answer these desires) may follow, as that thick
and obscure Veil may be taken away from the Eyes of our Enemies, and
they by true and infallible Illumination, obtain a clear sight, that
tehy may find their lost Groat: which *GOD*, the eternal Governour of
Time and Things of his Grace and Mercy grant.

But it is fit, that I, who intended to publish a certain Discourse of
Antimony, in all its Numbers Absolute, should begin with the \*Name
itself.

\**Poets do often posit in the midst of their Poems, Histories or Fables
of Princes, that by a continued Series of Things, they may the more
easily attain their End, which is to delight their Readers: Chymists for
another end use the same Medium. For since their purpose is to teach the
Readers so, as they may only be understood by those, who wholly devote
themselves with a fervent desire to the Study of that Science, they keep
not that Order, which proceeds from the beginning to the End by Mediums.
Therefore our Author, at length coming to treat of the name of Antimony,
whence it took beginning, acts as anohter Man addicted to some
Scholastic Order: but by and by turning from this Discourse, he answers
an Objection, before it is made by Interrogation; viz. whether from
Antimony all its Venom may be taken away, the possibility of which he
proves by very profitable and significant Examples.*

The *Arabians,* to whom in times past this Mineral was known, did in
their Language call it *Astinat*; but the *Chaldeans* called it
*Stibium;* among the *Latines* at this day the name of *Antimony* is
used, by which name they first of all signified it. We *Germans* in our
Language have given it a Name, which seems to express a certain property
of its Nature, for since it is seen to consist of a certain streiked
Matter, and of it may easily be made Glass endued with various Colours,
which proceed therefrom, we have called it *Spies-glass*, as if we
should say streiked Glass. From which Variety of the Name, by a prudent
Judgment a singular Collection may be made, *viz*. that *Antimony* was
knwon, and greatly esteemed, and its virtue and Utility observed and
brought into use by the *Arabians, Chaldeans, Latins,* and our
*Germans*: but afterward, the Heresies of various Opinions arising, the
use was vitiated, and its Virtue and Glory first obscured, and afterward
wholly extinguished. Of which there is no Reason to Doubt; for nothing
is more probable, than that Truth should suffer Dammage and Shipwrack by
the Oppression of Enemies. For who knows not the Malice of the Devil,
which by Reason of our Sins and Blindness is very often permitted by
*GOD*. The Devil is the perpetual Enemy of Mankind, who imploys all his
Strength, and all his Deceits, and omits nothing, which in himself is,
to prevent the Knowledge of the profit of true Medicine, and to
exterminate its use; knowing well enough, that by that means the power
and glory of *GOD* is obscured, and those Sacrifices of the praises of
men are impeded, by which they gave thanks to *GOD*, because he hath
insited as it were the Rays of his Goodness in the Creatures, whence
they may obtain Health by a natural auxiliary.

But since to discourse of the name of *Antimony*, is not to our purpose,
we will desist from this Matter. For all the Praise of *Antimony*
consists in the Preparation thereof, which is made for perfecting the
Virtues infused in it from Nature by the *Author* of *Nature*. Therefore
my discourse shall be of this, handling it and its known Virtue, and I
will endeavour to make my Name immortal. Yet before I come to declare
the Virtue of *Antimony*, since I above confessed, that it is meer
Venom, I would have you know and diligently note, that Venom is able to
draw Venom to itself, because like itself, much sooner and much more
than any other Thing of another Nature.

\[VIRTUE OF UNICORNS-HORN PROVED\]

Now let any Reader consider, and observe it as a Thing worthy of Note,
that the true *Unicorns-horn,* sophisticated by no fallacy, repels all
Venom from itself, nor can it assume or draw to itself anything of
Venom, as is manifest by Experience. Let a living Spider be put in a
Circle made of *Unicorns-horn*, and out of this Circle it cannot go, or
pass over the *Unicorns-horn*, for it shuns whatsoever is adverse to
Venom. But if the Circle be made of venemous Matter, it is not to be
doubted, but that the Spider will go out of it, and pass over that Venom
like it self. Note this Experiment, make a piece of Silver hollow, and
put it in Water, that it may float like a Boat, and put Venom into it,
then hold a piece of true Unicorns-Horn, as nigh to it as you can, but
so as you may not touch it, that Unicorns-Horn by its spiritual Virtue
will drive the Silver from it, so that it will flie away like a Duck,
which swimming on the Water flies, when it perceives the Snares of the
Fowler ready to entangle it. But on the contrary, Nature in a wonderful
manner loves and follows its own like, as appears by this Example. Put a
piece of pure and fine Bread in a dish full of Water, so as the Bread
may swim upon the Water, hold a piece of true Unicorns-Horn close to it,
yet so as it touch it not; and if you leisurely move the Unicorns-Horn
the little piece of Bread will follow it. Nature so much loves its own
like, and so much hates what is unlike itself, as this flies and that
follows. Therefore let our *Doctors* consider, that Venom by a certain
Magnetick Power Attracts Venom, and those things which are void of
Venom, do in like manner draw to themselves things pure, and wanting a
Venomous quality.

\[VENOM TAKEN AWAY TWO WAYS\]

Therefore Venom may be taken away two ways; first, by its Contrary,
which resists Venom, as already is related of the Unicorns-Horn.
Secondly,by Like, when Venom by a certain Magnetick power draws Venom to
itself. But the Venom which must heal Venom like itself, ought first to
be so prepared, as its Venom may pass into Medicine, and by its own
attractive virtue, assume the other to and expel it with itself.
\[EXAMPLE OF SOAP\] Of which thing you have a most clear Example of
*Soap*: That is compounded of Oil and other fat ingredient Matters,
which seem to be, and in very deed are, more apt to foul, than cleanse
Linen; but because in the Boiling of Soap, especially by the help of
Salt, a certain Separation and Preparation is made, the Soap is rendered
most apt to draw to itself and wash out all foulness and filths from
Linen and other things: so indeed may Venom in a certain manner, by
Antecedent Preparation be accommodated so, as to be no more Venom, but a
Medicament, it draws to itself all other Poison, casts it out, and
restores the man to his pristine Purity and Health.

Now since our Discourse hath led us so far, and we have begun to open
Nature so much; that the truly Studious of Medicine (though hitherto
ignorant of this) may clearly know, what Good or Evil is latent in
Nature, what is Venom and what is harmless; which is a thing hath not as
yet been found out by Doctors, by reason of their own supine negligence;
and that the Truth thereof may be demonstrated and also confirmed, it
will not be amiss to produce certain Experimental Examples, which may
discover the Truth, and refute the false Opinions of others. \[EXAMPLE
OF AN EGG\] Put an Egg, which in the Winter is congealed with Cold, into
very cold Water, there let it lie for a due space of time, and the Ice
will externally adhere to the Egg-shell, but the Cold be extracted from
the Egg itself, and restored to its pristine vigour and intireness.
\[EXAMPLE OF A MEMBER BENUMMED\] Again, if any Member be benummed with
Cold, let not the Patient neglect himself, but apply cold Snowwater
round about, so one Cold attracts the other, and the Member is restored.
\[EXAMPLE OF A MEMBER INFLAMED\] On the contrary, if any one have a
Member inflamed, let him apply to that Inflammation an hot Matter; as
for example, Spirit of Wine, which is mere Fire, or the Quintessence of
Sulphur, and he will in very deed find, that Heat is attracted by Heat,
in a certain Magnetick manner, and like to rejoice in like, and not only
to asswage the pain and heat of the inflamed Member, but absolutely to
restore the same to its pristine strength.

\[EXAMPLE OF FROGSPAWN\] Yet lest this our purpose should not be fully
enough confirmed by Examples, I will also add another, by way of
Supplement. Take Frog-Spawn in the Month of March, and laying it on a
Board dry it in the Sun, when dry reduce it to Powder, and strew of this
Powder, upon wounds made by Venomous Vipers or Serpents; by this means
such Wounds will be so prepared, as they may be perfectly healed by
other Medicaments applied thereunto. Or otherwise, if Linen cloths be
often moistened in Frog-Spawn, and as often dried, and that Linen cut
into small pieces and applied to Wounds, they effect the same, as the
aforesaid Powder would have done. \[EXAMPLE OF A TOAD\] But that the
very foundation of this Truth may more clearly be declared; take a
venemous Toad, dry him in the Sun, shut him up in an Earth closed Pot,
and by burning reduce him to Ashes; then having taken out the Ashes, and
reduced the same to Powder apply of that Powder to a Wound made by
Venom, and this Poison attracts the other Poison, and joins it with
itself. Why so, I pray? Because by this Burning, which is the
Calcination of the Toad, its interior Virtue is made manifest, and
efficacious for operating; so, that Like can attract like, and
especially Venom, to itself. Therefore firmly perswade yourself, that
this Truth is infallible and immuatable, which I have here proposed to
you and others by Example. If anyone afflicted with the Pest, do
diligently observe this, he will find the Truth of those things I have
here above mentioned: the *Astrum* of *Sol*, from which (as from an
operative and all vivifying Sun) all things in their kinds universally
arise; therefore I determine that in the potency of Gold, more than in
all other Things, is an Operating Nature; that is, in its own *Astrum*,
whence both itself, and all Metals and Minerals, in the Beginning,
received their first Nativity and Propagation of Generation. Touching
which more may be said, when I shall manifest to you the *Astrum* of
*Sol*, and commend the same most religiously to your Conscience.

\[ANTIMONY, ITS ASTRUM\]

After the same manner process is to be made with *Antimony*, which hath
the same Operations with corporal Gold; yet of the *Astrum* thereof I
now speak not. \[ANTIMONY SPEAKS OF ITSELF\] For I know (saith
*Antimony*) it behoves me, before that, to fear and tremble; although in
many principal *Arcanums* of Medicine, I far excel it; yet universally I
am able to effect none of those Things, which the *Astrum* of *Sol*
(confirmed by the Testimony of Celestial Verity) is able to produce. The
*Astrum* of *Mercury* I omit, because I my self have my descent from the
same Original with it: but as to a Celestial penetrating power of
Operating, I give the first place of Dominion to the *Astrum* of *Sol*.

\[VULCAN, A MASTER IN HIS OWN ELEMENTS\]

My Writings and Books, composed by Experience, properly follow and
answer each to other; as one metal (as to its virtue) is observed and
esteemed by another, and must by Fire be proved of what value it is. So
these my Sayings, or Writings, or Medicaments, ought to be brought into
the Schools, as tending to one Scope and End. Into the Schools, I say,
where Riches obtain to themselves (as it were) an Hereditary place, and
instead of that take away all the Honour, which is due to *Vulcan* only,
who can boast himself to be a Master in his own Element of Fire. Which
may be shewed by Example, and a true and manifest *Proof*. \[EXAMPLE OF
STEEL AND A FLINT\] When most hard Steel is struck with an hard and
solid Flint, Fire excites Fire by vehement Commotion, and accension,
drawing forth the occult Sulphur, or the occult Fire is manifested by
that vehement Commotion, and enkindled by the Air so, as it truly and
efficaciously burns; but the *Salt* remains in the Ashes, and the
*Mercury* thence takes its flight together with the burning Sulphur.\*

\*

You, who read this most simple Comparison of Steel and a Flint, slack
the Reins of your Admiration, and seriously ask yourself, whether there
can be found out anyway or Method, by which from this Stone and Cold
Iron may be extracted, a Substance, of which one only Grain (but why do
I speak of a Grain?) of which the hundred part of a Grain can in a very
short time Convert a great Mass of some rude Matter, into the most
splendid and most pretious of all Things; yea, into fire most profitable
for Mankind? This is possible, and is dayly done, when the fixed is made
Volatile, and the Volatile again fixed. He that hath understanding, let
him understand, and cease to defame the admirable virtues of Chymical
Works.

\[MEDICINE, INEFFECTUAL IF NOT SEPARATED FROM ITS IMPURITY\]

So here also understand, that *Antimony* ought in a certain Method so to
be handled, as its *Mercury* may be separated from the Sulphur thereof,
in a Natural Manner. Now as Fire, which lies absconded in Matter, unless
it be made manifest, and can be demonstrated, is profitable for nothing,
is not (as I may say) tangible by the Hands, nor can it effect any thing
to purpose; so Medicine can effect nothing that is excellent, unless it
be first separated from its Grossness, rectified and so discharged of
Impurities, clarified and brought to Light by due Preparation, as is
manifest in all Things: for when Separation of the pure from the impure
is made, and all that is mountanour or terrestrial is segregated from
the pure Metal, then the desired Harvest is to be expected. Hence it is
manifest, that Fire can effect nothing, before it is in a certain manner
opened and set at Liberty, that before it is in a certain manner opened
and set at Liberty, that it may operate. Therefore, to comprehend much
in few Words, I say, this is the Condition of *Antimony*. Whatsoever is
occult and absconded from the Knowledge of the Vulgar, that injoys the
Name and Honour of Art, *viz.* as long as it lies hid; but so soon as it
is discovered and made manifest, Art hath end, and it becomes a
Mechanick Work; as I have than once declared in other of my Books.

\[EXAMPLE OF BEES\]

A Bee sucks Honey from Flowers, with such Art as the Almighty hath
insited in it, in which Honey is latent a Virtue, Juice, and
Corroborative Power, of which a Medicine is made, as is obvious to the
Eyes of all Men. \[EXAMPLE OF A CORROSIVE VENOM OF HONEY\] Now, from
that *Honey*, of a sweet and most pleasant Taste, a violent Corrosive
and present Venom may be prepared; which perhaps no man, unless he who
hath learned it, will believe; no man certainly considers this, unless
he be a diligent Observer. Yet for this Cause Honey is not to be
condemned, nor is it to be said, that although it hath a most grateful
Sweetness, yet it is a Corrupt Medicine; because a Corrosive may be made
of it: but it should rather be said, that Corruption proceeds from the
Physicians ignorance, who knew not how duely to prepare it. Here I am
willing to teach the ignorant Physician, to free him from the last
Judgement. \[HONEY, HOW PREPARED\] For Honey is prepared of the
Superfluities of Brute Animals, by which the Grounds and Fields are
fattened; in those Grounds arise Flowers, Herbs, Fruit-trees of various
kinds, from which the Bees suck a most noble Quintessence: by this is
made the Alteration and Generation of one Thing into another, *viz*.
into Aliment of another Form and Taste, which in no wise agrees with the
former, and that is called Honey. Of such Honey is prepared a Food most
grateful, pleasant and fit for man, and for many Things most profitable.
Of the same may be prepared a Poison most hurtful to Man and Beast.

\[NATURE TO BE FOLLOWED\]

Therefore, do you Searcher of Nature, of what Age, Sex, Fortune, or
Condition soever, follow me and Nature. I will shew you the Truth,
without any Mixture of falsity, drawn from the very Foundation. I will
make you understand, who proceeds rightly, and who unadvisedly. I will
teach you to separate the Good from the Evil, the Highest from the
Lowest. For of *Antimony*, if its Venom be first changed into Remedy, is
made a Medicine, which eradicates, and like Fire penetrates, prepares
and by cocting consumes all Diseases. \[QUINTESSENCE OF ANTIMONY, WHAT\]
Wherefore *Antimony* is first to be prepared into a true *Stone*, which
is the Quintessence thereof; and because, in its Operation it is
altogether like unto Fire, (when reduced to its Coagulation) it shallby
me be named the *Stone of Fire*. when this *Stone* of *Fire* is rightly
prepared, as in the End of this Treatise I will further show, its
Medicinal Virtue consumes all noxious Humours, purifies the blood in the
highest Degree, and performs all that may be effected by *Aurum
Potabile*.

\[DOCTORS REPREHENDED\]

Therefore, I pray you, my unexperienced Doctor, who have neither learned
my Preparation, nor conceived the Use, not to judge from a false
suspicion, and your own ignorant Thoughts; but set about the Work
itself, and learn how the Preparation of *Antimony* ought to be made,
how you should further proceed with it, how its Venom is expelled and
separated, and Salutary Medicine posited in the place of it, and
exalted. When I say\* you shall have performed This, then at length will
you be able to judge of the difference, and understand those things,
which before were very far remote from your Knowledge.

\*

Here again the Author waxeth hot against false Physicians; but do you
read on, and after this Heat he will give you a profitable Doctrine,
which you may soon find in Aqua Fortis and Spirit of Wine.

\[DOCTORS REPREHENDED\]

O you wretched and to be pitied *Medicasters*, who painted with a
*Fucus*, breath out I know not what *Thrasonick* Brags, and pass over
Mountains wanting Foundation, walking through Clouds in your own
Thoughts, and know not where at length you shall rest your Foot: you, I
say, I admonish to consider what you will answer, in the Extreme
Judgement of the Son of *GOD*. *Seek*, and when you have found, convert
what you find to use, and so performing your Office commit the Rest to
*GOD*, who will give success, and never leave you destitute of help. But
you infamous men, more mad than *Bacchanalian* Fools, who will neither
learn, nor foul your Hands with Coals, judge not lest you procure
Judgement to be pronounced against you, which your Childrens Children
may write down to your shame in an undeleble Character.

Every Physician ought above all Things to take Care, that he do neither
less nor more, than procure the Restitution of Health lost, not
instituting his Curation contrary to Nature, or deviating from her
direct Intention. \[EXAMPLE OF SPIRIT OF WINE AND AQUA FORTIS\] When
Spirit of Wine is poured upon *Aqua Fortis* a vehement Ebullition is
made, and these two Natures will not easily permit themselves to be
together; but he, that knows how by Distillation to conjoin them and
unite them, according to the true Intention of the Philosophers, he may
use them in many things for good. \[EXAMPLE OF OIL OF TARTAR AND
VINEGAR\] After the same maner, Oil or Liquor of Tartar, and Vinegar
made of Rich Wine, act each upon other, for they hate and fly from each
other, as Fire and Water, although they proceeded from one and the same
Matter. Therefore the Physician ought in a special manner to be mindful,
to understand all Circumstances from the Sick very exactly, and consider
the same being understood that in Curing he may use such Means, as are
fit to remove the Disease, lest the Patient be injured by the Medicine.
As for Example, when Iron is dissolved in *Aqua Fortis*, if you suddenly
pour Oil of Tartar upon that Solution, you shall difficultly preserve
Glass from breaking; for the contrary Natures, like unto Gun-powder,
take Fire, and break the Glass. Of all these Things, our Gown Doctors
know nothing at all; therefore they have no other Defence for their
Ignorance, than Silence only.

\[DOCTORS AND APOTHECARIES REPREHENDED\]

You titular Doctors, you I speak to, who write long Scroles of Receipts:
you Apothecaries, who with your Decoctions fill Pots, no less than Those
(in Prince Courst) in which Meat is boiled for the sustentation of some
hundreds of men: you, I say, who hitherto have been blind, suffer a
*Collyrium* to be poured into your Eyes, and permit them to be anointed
with Balsom, that the most thick skin of Blindness may fall from your
Sight, and you behold the Truth, as in a most clear Glass. \[AUTHORS
PRAYER\] *GOD* grant you Grace, that you may know his wonderful Works,
and the Love of your Neighbour be rooted in you, that you may search out
true Medicine, which the Ruler of the Heavens hath, by his own
omnipotent hand, and his ineffable and eternal Wisdom, from above
infused in, impressed on, and communicated to his Noble Creatures, for
the Good of Mankind; whence man may find help in his greatest Necessity,
and Counsel for Health in his Diseases. Why do you, miserable Worm of
the Earth, and food of Worms, look so intently on the Rind or Shell, and
neglect the Kernel, being unmindful of your *Creator*, who formed you
according to his Image; when as you ought to give thanks to him, and
with diligent Study to search out his Works, exceeding Nature herself?
Return and look into your self, there behold the Image of your own
ingratitude, that you may be ashamed of yourself, especially because you
have not search out those things, which the most wise *GOD*, for the
good of Mortals; hath infused in his Creatures; by knowing which, you
might have offered unto him the most acceptable Sacrifice of Praise and
Gratitude.

But I will put an end to this Discourse, lest my Tears (which I can
scarcely keep in, from continually falling from mine Eyes) should blot
this my Writing, and whilst I deplore the Blindness of the World, I
blemish this Lamentation, which I would have known to all men. I am a
man Religious, incorporated in a most holy Order, in which I will
persevere, as long as it shall please the Omnipotent *GOD*, to animate
this miserable Body with Vital Spirit: therefore I must not write other
things, or otherwise, than is agreeable to this State. But had I the
Office of a Secular Judge, I would lift up my Voice, and sound a Trumpet
in their Ears, that those deaf men may hear, who hitherto would not
acknowledge the Truth, but out of Ignorance, without Cause, falsely and
slanderously persecute, calumniate, condemn, disparage, and meditate how
they may totally suppress the same.

But thou, O Lord *GOD*, who dwellest in the Highest, who art called and
truly art the *GOD* of Rest, who sitting in the Supreme Throne of
Majesty, governest Heaven and Earth, which thou hast created, who
conservest the Stars, and ordainest the Course of the Firmament in its
Motion according to thy Command, before whom all Creatures tremble,
which are found in the Earth, or in Heaven, and the Infernal Spirits are
astonished with unexpressable dread, be pleased, I pray to look down
upon the Transactions of this most ungrateful World, and teach them
inwardly to know those Things, which thou hast outwardly and visibly
proposed to the Sons of Men, that thou mayest be praised in thy Throne,
known in thy Verity, and adored in thy immense Majesty. As for myself, I
am unworthy and miserable man, give thanks unto thee, for thy great and
infinite Gifts and Benefits of Riches and health bestowed on me, and
laud thy Majesty for ever for the same. More, O my Father and Lord, I
neither can, nor am able to desire in this perishing World.

\[ANTIMONY, ITS ORIGINAL AND ROOT\]

Now, that we may write of *Antimony*, and begin our Discourse from the
very Foundation, whence *Antimony* acquires its Empire, Triumph and
Glory, by which it is exalted to perfect Operation, we must before all
Things discover the certain Original of its Root: how it is generated in
the Earth, to the Dominion of what Stars it is subjected, and what
Elements have throughly digested it, and which tehy be, that have
brought it to Maturity. *Antimony* is no other than a Fume, or (as I may
otherwise call it) a Mineral Vapour, which is genited from above by the
Stars, and afterward by the Elements deduced and digested to formal
Coagulation and Maturity. Here it is to be noted, that *Antimony* hath
acquired its Essence, Virtue, Power, Operation and Quality, from the
same Principle, Root and Essence, whence Vulgar Mercury is produced; yet
with more firm Coagulation, so that it is brought to an harder Essence,
than the living or running Mercury of the Vulgar hath. The Reason of
this is, because it hath assumed from the three Principles, a little
more of the Substance of Salt, than Common Mercury. For although of all
the three Principles, it hath the least part of Salt, yet it hath
assumed more of the Essence of Salt, than common Mercury, whence unto it
hath happened such a Coagulation. Hardness in everything is from Salt,
which vulgar Mercury hath not. For it hath a very small part of Salt,
but in it, in a spiritual manner, is insited a certain more hot *Spirit*
of *Sulphur*; therefore it always flows, and cannot be brought to
Coagulation, unless by the help of other Metallick Spirits, which endued
with a very great Virtues, are chiefly found in the *Matrix* of
*Saturn*, without which it cannot be fixed, unless by him, who
possesseth the *Stone* of *Philosophers,* by which its three Principles
may be brought to a concordant Equality, and then it acquires such a
Body, as will melt, flow, and abide the Hammer, like all other Metals:
other wise Mercuy is and will be fluid Mercury, until its volatility be
this way taken away. \[MERCURY, NOT FIXED BY ANIMALS AND VEGETABLES\]
Hence it is known, that all Animals and all Vegetables are too weak to
fix Mercury into a malleable Substance (as many have in vain
endeavoured) because all these have not a Metallick Nature. \[MERCURY,
WITHIN AND WITHOUT MERE FIRE\] *Mercury*, within and without, is no
other than meer Fire; therefore it is not combustible by any Fire, no
Fire can apprehend it so, as to alter its Essence, but it suddenly flies
and resolves itself into a incombustible Oil Spiritually; \[MERCURY
UNVARIABLE AFTER FIXATION\] or after its fixation it remains so
invariable, as no strength or power of men is sufficient again to alter
it. And whatsoever can now be made of Gold may then also be made of it
by Art; because after Coagulation it is altogether like Gold: for it
with Gold hath one and the same Root, Stock, or Production originally.

But since I purpose not in this place to discourse more largely of
*Mercury*, and intend only simply (yet truly) to describe the very
Foundation of *Antimony*, from true and certain Principles, I will cease
to speak of *Mercury*, and proceed to a further Declaration of
*Antimony*. Yet, whatsoever I have proposed by way of Similitude
touching *Mercury\**, for an Introduction and further Consideration, is
not written in vain, or to no purpose; but to the end, that the very
Beginning of *Antimony* may be more clearly understood, which (as I
before shewed) received its original, as it were Mercurially, with it.

\*Which so miserably perplexeth all the Students of this Art: what our
Mercury is, which is the Matter of the Stone, which is found every where
and in all Things, is here briefly and clearly manifested. Therefore our
Author Basilius doth not in Vain invite your Attention. All the Light I
am able to add to this Clearness, would rather obscure, than illustrate
the same: therefore, with him, I admonish you to attend.

\[MATTER, OF ALL METALS AND MINERALS, ONE\]

Wherefore most diligently think on this; often bear in mind, observe and
understand, that all Minerals and Metals together, in the same Time, and
after the same manner, and of one and the same principal Matter, are
produced and genited. That Matter is no other, than a meer Vapour, which
is extracted from the Elementary Earth by the Superior *Stars*, as by a
Sidereal Distillation of the Macrocosm: which Sidereal hot infusion,
with any Airy-Sulphureous Property descending upon Inferiors, so acts
and operates, as in those Metals and Minerals is implanted spiritually
and invisibly a certain Power and Virtue, which Fume afterward resolves
itself in the Earth, into a certain Water, from which Mineral Water all
Metals are thenceforth generated and ripened to their Perfection; and
thence proceeds this or that Metal or Mineral, according as one of the
three Principles acquires Dominion, and tehy have much or little of
Sulphur and Salt, or an unequal Mixture of the weight of them, whence
some Metals are fixed; that is, some constant and stable, some volatile
and easily mutable, as is seen in *Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Tin* and
*Lead*. Besides these Metals, other Minerals also are generated of the
three Principles, according to the Communication and Participation of
the unequal weight of them: as are *Vitriol*, *Antimony*, and many other
Marchasites, or other Electrums, and Minerals, which for brevity sake we
here omit.

But Gold, in its *Astrum* and Beginning was imbibed with a much more
perfect *Sulphur*, and a much more perfect *Mercury*, than all other
Metals and Minerals, and therefore its operative Virtue is much more
potent and more efficacious, that the *Astrums* of other Metals: Yea,
all Virtues whatsoever are dispersed in other Metals, and many more than
them, are found in the *Astrum* of Gold only. Moreover I say, when that
one thing is brought to further Maturity by Fire, it contains more
Perfection, than all Metals and Minerals together. There is one only
Mineral, of which I have often made mention already, in which is found a
Sulphur of *Sol*, equally as strong and powerful, yea more potent and
more strong, than in Gold itself: so also, there are two kinds of Metals
found, in which this Predominancy powerfully Triumphs, of which at this
time I have neither will nor disposition to write; but I am willing to
keep within the Bounds I have set myself in treating of the Essence of
*Antimony*, touching which I purpose now to speak.

\[ANTIMONY, ITS 3 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES\]

Therefore *Antimony* is a Mineral made of the Vapour of the Earth
changed into Water, which Spiritual Sidereal Transmutation is the true
*Astrum* of *Antimony*; which Water, by the Stars first, afterward by
the Element of Fire, which resides in the Element of Air, is extracted
from the Elementary Earth, and by Coagulation formally changed into a
tangible Essence, in which tangible Essence, (*viz*. whence *Antimony*
is formally made) is found very much of *Sulphur* predominant, of
*Mercury* not so much, and of *Salt* the least of all three; yet it
assumes so much *Salt*, as it thence acquires an hard and immalleable
Mass. \[ANTIMONY, ITS PRINCIPLE QUALITIES\] The principal Quality of it
is dry and hot, or rather burning, of Cold and Humidity it hath very
little in it, as there is in Common Mercury; in Corporal Gold also is
more Heat than Cold. These may suffice to be spoken of the Matter, and
three Fundamental Principles of *Antimony*, how by the *Archeus* in the
Element of Earth it is brought to perfection.

Yet the Lovers of *Chymistry* should not think this Philosophick Reason
by me alleged of absolute necessity to them, nor need they be solicitous
to know, in what center the *Astrum* of *Antimony* rests, or from what
root it flows; but should rather desire to learn the Utility and use
thereof; *viz*. which way it ought to be prepared and reduced to its
State, that tehy may know its Virtue, Power, and Operation, touching
which in times past so many Things have been written, and to this Day
are mentioned, and spoken of by all men of all States and Conditions.
For the Learned, as well as the Unlearned hope to have their ardent and
insatiable Desire satisfied by This; therefore I will not detain the
Reader with ambiguous Discourses, or tedious Delays, but simply teach
every Thing, which I by great Study and Diligence (which I have often
imployed about *Antimony*) could find out touching the Essence of
*Antimony*. For no man, by reason of the shortness of Life, can know or
search out all its *Arcanum’s*: because in Preparation of *Antimony*,
one new Wonder follows another perpetually; one Degree succeeds a former
Degree, Colour follows Colour, and one Virtue, Power or Operation always
manifests it self greater than another.

And, to begin here I say, *Antimony* is meer Venom, not of the kind of
the least Venoms, but such, as by which you may destroy Men and Beasts,
so venomous a power is diffused through the whole Substance of this
Mineral. Hence ariseth the common Exclamation of all men. \[KINGS, AND
PRINCES, MISINFORMED BY DOCTORS\] For the People, unskilful Doctors, and
all Those, to whom the ground of true Medicine is unknown, do with one
mouth proclaim it *Venom*, *Venom!* Poison, say they (as I myself above
confessed) lies in *Antimony*. For this Cause let us dissuade all men
from its use; for it endangers the Health and Life. Therefore *Doctors*
resident in Princes Courts, admonish Monarchs, Princes, and other
Potentates not to use *Antimony*. Other Scholasticks cry out, Beware,
you in no wise admit *Antimony* into Medicinal Use; for it’s meer
Poison: these the Inhabitants of Cities and Villages follow. And this
far spread Clamour so moves the greatest part of Mortals, as *Antimony*
in these our Days is very ill spoken of, and no man dares put confidence
in the Medicine thereof, which in it is found so various and
unexpressible. \[MEDICINE, NONE GREATER THAN IN ANTIMONY\] For truly and
holily I affirm (as truly as *GOD* is the Creator of all things visible,
which are contained in Heaven or Earth, which either have come, or in
time to come shall come unto our knowledge) that under Heaven, or by the
Rays of the Sun, with the Guidance of Experience, can be found or
demonstrated no greater Medicine, than is in this Mineral; yea, there is
no Subject, in which so fluently and abundantly can be found such most
certain Remedies for Health, as shall be declared (by sure and
undeniable Experiments) to be in

Antimony.

Son, attend to this my Discourse, and do thou Reader give heed to my
Writings, and do you wise men of the World diligently observe my
Declaration of *Antimony* founded on Experience. For my *Theory* ariseth
from Nature, and my *Practice* proceeds from certain Experience, which
shews its manifold Utility, and infinite Ways produceth the same, not
without the incredible Admiration of all men. But I assent to you, and
confess (as I have before acknowledged in my Writings) that *Antimony*
at first is meer Venom, and before Preparation hath nothing in or with
itself, but Poison; and that I affirm to be true. \[DOCTORS
REPREHENDED\] But you, whosoever you are, insignized or not insignized
with the Degree of *Doctor, Master,* or *Bachelor*, whether skilful in
Art, or by some other privelage promoted; you, I say, who so
inconsiderately and so arrogantly without Truth exclaim, and prate
against me, pause a while, and forget not your own Argument, hear what I
have to say. *Antimony* is Venom, therefore every One must beware he use
it not. No, that doth not follow Mr. *Doctor, Bachelor,* or, *Master;*
it doth not follow, I say, Mr *Doctor,* although you be proud of your
Red Hat. *Treacle* is made of the most perillous Venom of a *Viper*,
which is called ‘animal’, whence also it had its Name; therefore no man
must use it, for there is poison in it. Doth this Consequence please
you? How doth this my Doctrine like you? \[NO GOOD IN ANTIMONY FOR THE
HUMAN BODY, WITHOUT PREPARATION\] You hear, that after Preparation, no
Venenosity is found in *Antimony*; for by the Spagyric Art *Antimony* is
converted from Venom into Medicine, no otherwise than as of the Venom of
a Viper is said, which is converted into *Treacle*; but without
Preparation you shall find no Good in it, nor anything of Medicinal
Help, but much loss and detriment.

\[VULCAN, MASTER AND REVEALER OF ALL SECRETS\]

Now, whosoever desires to become a Disciple of *Antimony*, he must,
after Prayer, and an earnest Invocation of *GOD*, betake himself to the
School of *Vulcan*; for he is the Master and Revealer of all Secrets.
\[VULCAN, CONDEMNED BY WHOM\] This Master is condemned by the Wise Men
of the World, set very light by and derided; because they, by reason of
their own Negligence and Malignity, have learned nothing of him; and all
Revelation, through their own Sloath, is impeded: \[MEDICINE, NOT
PREPARED WITHOUT VULCAN\] for no Medicine was ever prepared without
*Vulcan*, whatsoever those senseless mad men shall babble and affirm to
the Contrary.

\[ANTIMONY, ITS WONDERFUL VIRTUES\]

But I will proceed to the Proceed and Preparation of *Antimony*; for I
little value the Clamours of arrogant and self applauding men: let them
make and bring to light any Work that can excel *Antimony*. It is well
known to me, that of *Antimony* may be made Medicines equal to Those,
which are in gold and vulgar Mercury (I except the *Astrum* of *Sol*)
for of this may be prepared *Aurum Potabile* against the Leprosie, of
this may be made Spirit of Mercury, the highest Remedy against the
French *POX*, of this other infinite Remedies may be prepared. If those
Condemners cannot perceive and understand this, what wonder is it? None,
because they have not learned it. No man can give a sound Judgement of
that, which he never learned. \[DESPISERS OF ANTIMONY COMPARED TO AN
ASS\] Let the Ass, an *Animal* like them in stupidity be their Example,
who cannot teach a Shepherd how to handle his Pipe, so as to play an
Harmonious Tune; because he hath not learned. So, right Judgement, with
a solid Foundation cannot be given by a man, who before hath not bent
his Studies that way, that from Writings he may be able to discern what,
in such a Business, is just or unjust. \[DOCTORS REPREHENDED\] After the
same manner in this Faculty, what can be attributed to any of the
*Doctors,* before he hath from Writings, and by his own proper labour
acquired Knowledge?

\[VENOM, WHENCE IT ARISETH\] Yet before I pass to the Process itself,
some One may perhaps interrupt and ask me, which way both Minerals and
other Things receive their Venenosity? What Venom is? Whence the Poison
of every Thing hath its Original? How it may be taken away, also how
such a Mineral may without peril securely be used for Health after
evacuation of that Venom? To these Questions I will briefly and clearly
answer. The Infusion of Venom falls under a twofold Consideration,
*viz.* Natural and Supernatural.

\[GODS END IN PROPOSING VENOMS\]

The First Reason, why *GOD* the Supreme Lord of the Stars, and the maker
of Heaven and Earth, hath proposed to us open Venom, especially in
Minerals, is, that by this his Ordination he might show to us his
Wonders and powerful Works, for distinction of Good and Evil, as in the
Law he prescribed to us the Knowledge of That, which lies as a Duty on
us to do, *viz*. to Choose the Good and Eschew the Evil. So also the
Tree of Life in Paradise was proposed; its right use tended to Good, but
its abuse brought the Fall to Evil; for by that *GOD’s* Command was
broke, whence proceeded Destruction and all Evil. This is the first
Reason.

A Second Reason is, that by this we might comprehend and understand the
Distinction between Evil and Good, and at length learn to exterminate
Malice and reposit Goodness in its place. For *GOD* wills not, that man
should perish and be destroyed, but that he should depart from Evil, and
come to amendment of Life, that Destruction may be driven far away from
his Soul. So, to Us his Creatures, with wonderful Conveniency hath he
proposed Good and Evil, which is found both in the Precept of the Word,
and in the Work of the Creature, that we may choose what is profitable
and good for Health, and shun what is evil and pernitious.

Thirdly, Venom is also made by the Stars, when contrary Oppositions and
Conjunctions of them happen, by which the Elements are Infected so, as
they become the Cause of Pestilences, and other Venomous Diseases in
this World: which also is to be understood of *Comets*.

Fourly, Venom is made from Things repugnant each to other, as when any
One inkindles a deadly Poison in himself, by Anger or Sadness; also when
a man drinks being above measure hot.

Fifthly, among Venoms may be numbered Weapons, with which any One is
slain; then the Abuse of Arms is Venom to that man. But when any One
useth Arms, for the just and unblamable defence of his Body, to which
end they were invented, then they may be accounted a certain kind of
Medicine.

Lastly, the Cause of Venom may be demonstrated by Nature, in this
manner: whatsoever Nature resists is Venom, and that because it fights
against Nature. As when any one eats such Food, as his *Stomach* cannot
bear, then that Food is Venom to him; for it is repugnant to Nature; on
the contrary, if any One eat such Food, as is Friendly to his Stomach,
to him that Food is Medicine.

But Venom is principally attracted to Bodies in the Earth, whilst they
are a certain Mercurial Essence (now I speak of the Venom of Minerals)
which yet is in an immature, crude, and not well digested Form, which is
repugnant to Nature, and difficultly digeested; because such a Mercurial
Essence is not yet perfect, well digested to Maturity, therefore it
passeth through the whole Body, as a crude, immature, undigestible
Mineral. As if crude corn should be eaten by men, that would be so
difficult to be digested by the Stomach, as a notable debility of the
Body would follow. For the natural Heat is too weak to deduce that to a
due Concoction and Perfection. Corn, which receives its Maturity from
the Fire of the Great World, must afterward be throughly cocted by the
Minor Fire, that it may be digested by the Microcosm. \[CATHARTICKS, ALL
VENOMOUS\] As before we said, touching the boiling of Flesh to Maturity;
so here the same is to be understood of *Antimony*, which being yet
crude, and not throughly cocted in the Earth to fixedness, the stomach
of Man (as I may so speak) is too weak to bear it, or retain the same,
as by certain Experience is manifested, *viz.* that all *Catharticks*,
whether Minerals, Animals or Vegetables, are venomous, because of a
certain Mercurial volatile Matter still predominant in them; which
volatile Spirit is the Cause why other things, which are in man, are
expelled: \[REMEDIES FIXED PURGE NOT\] not that by this Means the Root
itself of Diseases is laid hold on, which only is effected by the
fixedness of every medicine. \[ROOT OF DISEASES, HOW EXPELLED\] For
every Medicine throughly fixed, searcheth out fixed Diseases, and
eradicates them; which Purgers not fixed cannot do, but they do only as
it were carry away some Spoil of Diseases; or they may be compared to
Water, which driven by force through a Street Penetrates not the Earth
itself. \[PURGING BY THE INFERIOR PARTS, NOT THE WAY TO EXPEL FIXED
DISEASES\] Fixed Remedies purge not by the Inferior Parts, because that
is not the familiar way of Expelling fixed Venoms, and that way they
would not touch the Kernel (as I may call it) or Center of the Disease;
but by expelling Sweat, and otherways they strike at the very inmost
Root of the Diseases, not contented with a certain superficial Expulsion
of Filths. Therefore we often admonish all and every One, that all
venomous Impurity is totally to be taken away from *Antimony*, before it
can either be, or be called such a Medicine, as may safely be given. For
this Cause, the Good must be separated from the Evil, the Fixed from the
not fixed, and the Medicine from the Venom with accurate diligence, if
we hope by the Use of *Antimony* to obtain true Honour, and true
Utility; but Fire only can effect that. For *Vulcan* is the sole and
only Master of all These. Whatsoever the *Vulcan* in the Greater Orbe
leaves crude and perfects not, that in the Lesser World must be amended
by a certain other *Vulcan*, ripening the Immature, and cocting the
Crude by Heat, and separating the Pure from the Impure. That this is
possible no man doubts; for dayly Experience teacheth the same, and it
is very apparent in the Corporal Aspect of Colours, which proceed from
the Fire. \[FIRE, THE SEPARATOR OF VENOMS\] For by Separation and Fire,
which perfect Fixation, Venenosity is taken away, and a Change is made
of the Evil into Good, as we have already said. Therefore Fire is the
Separator of Venom from Medicine, and of Good from Evil; which is a
thing, that None of the *Physicians* either dares or can truly and
fundamentally own, or demonstrate to me, unless he who hath firmly
contracted Friendship with *Vulcan*, and instituted the fiery Bath full
of Love, by which the Spouse, being throughly purged from all
Defilement, may legitimately lie down iwth her Bridegroom in the
Marriage Bed.

Fie upon the Acuteness of the Worldly Wit of those, who neither
understand, nor are willing to endeavour to understand these my
Writings. if you did know, what is called fixed, and what not fixed, and
what it signifies to separate the Pure from the Impure, assuredly you
would purposely forget many Things, and omitting other vain Works, would
follow me only. \[ANTIMONY, SPEAKS OF ITSELF\] For in me (*Antimony*
speaks of himself) you will find *Mercury*, *Sulphur* and *Salt*, then
which Nothing is more Conducible for the Health of men. \[MERCURY,
SULPHUR, AND SALT IN ANTIMONY\] *Mercury* is in the *Regulus*, *Sulphur*
in the Red Colour, and *Salt* in the remaining black Earth. He that can
separate these, and again unite them in a due manner, according to Art,
so as Fixation may bear Rule, without Venom, he may rejoice with Honour
and Truth; because he hath obtained the *Stone* of *Fire*, which may be
prepared of *Antimony* for the Health of Mortals, and for Temporal
Sustentation with particular profit. \[ANTIMONY, CONTAINS ALL COLOURS\]
For in *Antimony* you may find all Colours, Black, White, Red, Green,
Blue, Yellow, and more other mixt Colours, than can be believed, all
which may be separated apart, and known particularly, and singularly
applied to use; according as the Artist intends, such an Ordination is
to be instituted.

\[ANTIMONY, ITS WONDERFUL VIRTUES\] Therefore now will I distinctly
declare, how Medicine is to be prepared, Venom to be expelled, Fixation
to be set about, and a true Separation to be made, by which the Evil may
be subdued and depressed, and the Good triumph and be taken into use. In
the meanwhile, let the Lover of Art consider, that every of the other
Metals may be compared to every of the Precious Stones; but this only
contains universally the Virtue of all Stones; which those Colours,
which it gives forth and exhibits to the Sight from itself in the Fire,
do sufficiently demonstrate. Its Transparent Redness is assigned to the
Carbuncle, Ruby and Coral; its Whiteness, to the Diamond and Crystal;
its Blue Colour, to the Saphire; Green, to the Emerald; Yellow, to the
Jacinth; its Black, to the Granate, which Stone contains in itself a a
certain Blackness occultly absconded. But as to Metals, the Black is
assigned to Saturn, the Red to Iron, the Yellow to Gold, the Green to
Copper, the Blue to Silver, the White to Mercury, and its mixture of
various Colours is attributed to Jupiter. \[ANTIMONY, CONTAINS ALL
COLOURS\] But as all the colours of all Metals and Precious Stones are
clearly found in *Antimony*; so also all the powers and Virtues of
Medicine are no less showed in it, than the Colours aforesaid: but to
educe from it all these Colours is not the Labour of one man. For our
Life is circumscribed with Limits more straight, than will permit one
man by his Labour throughly to learn whatsoever Nature keeps concealed
and absconded in her bosom, in one certain way of Preparation, from
*Antimony* by distillations is drawn forth an Humour acid and sharp,
like true perfect Vinegar. Another way is prepared a shining Red Colour,
sweet and savoury, as purified Honey or Sugar. Another way, a Wormwood
like Bitterness proceeds therefrom; otherwise, a certain Acrimony, like
some Salt-Oil: thus always one Nature follows another. Against, but
Sublimation it is driven to the Olympic Mountains, like a flying Eagle,
red, yellow and white. Also forced down by Descent, it yields diverse
Colours and Preparations: also by Reverberation, of it is made a Metal,
like common Lead. Likewise a transparent Glass, red, yellow, white,
black, and endewed with other Colours: all which notwithstanding, are
not safe to be used in Medicine, unless they be first proved by another
*Examen*. Also it is reslved into rare and wonderful Oils, which are
various and manifold, some of which are made perfect with Addition,
others without mixtion of any other things; some likewise are taken
inwardly, others only outwardly applied to common Ulcers, and Wounds. It
supplies us with so many several Extractions, varied with so many
Colours, as it would tire a *Delphian Apollo* to describe them all; but
indeed, all the Mutations of its Nature, which are discovered through
the Gate of Fire, it by its own Oracles will best unfold. \[MERCURY,
MADE OF ANTIMONY\] Of it is made living Mercury, and Sulphur which burns
like common Sulphur, so that of that Gunpowder might be made. Of it is
made a true and natural *Salt*; and many other things are prepared of
the same.

Therefore we begin to speak of the Preparations thereof, as of its
*Essence, Magistery, Arcanum, Elixir*, and particular *Tincture*, in
which you must imploy all diligence and Care; especially when I shall in
my Writings declare to you the Stone of Fire, and its Preparation,
together with other various Secrets and Arcanums, which indeed are
scarcely at all known to the World; and which have been little regarded,
since the *Egyptians*, *Arabians* and *Chaldeans* died, who professed
these Arts: of which notwithstanding the use is very great, for
searching out the very Fountain of true Medicine, and all other Works
pertinent thereunto.

Now diligently mind, and with profound Meditation consider all the
following Preparations, one succeeding another, as I shall reveal them.
For there is no One inserted, which hath not its singular Utility, but
every of them is useful, according as ordained as its State. A fixed
Medicine of *Antimony*, expels fixed Diseases and eradicates tehm; but
*Antimony* is not fixed, as when it is crude and not prepared, opens and
purgeth the Stomach only, but toucheth not the Root of the Disease.
Therefore I will set about the Preparation of all, that appertains to
*Antimony*, and discover all the Keys of its Preparation, which now (as
by a New Nativity) are brought to Light, and revealed by Fire, in the
same state to which tehy were ordained by *GOD* their *Creator*. This
unlocking and preparing of Mineral *Antimony* is performed by diverse
Methods and Ways, by the disposure and governance of the Fire, with
manifold labour of the Hands, whence proceeds the Operation, Virtue,
Power and Colour of the Medicine itself. And since *Antimony* to the
Aspect presents a crude black Colour, mixed with a little whiteness, I
will first speak of its destructive alteration, which consists in
*Calcination* and *Incineration*, and that is thus made.

\[CALCINATION OF ANTIMONY\]

Take Hungarian or other *Antimony*, the best you can get, grind it, if
possible, to an Impalpable Powder; this Powder spread Thin all over the
bottom of a Calcining Pan, round or square, which hath a Rim round
about, the height of two Fingers thickness; set this Pan into a
Calcining Furnace, and administer to it at first a very moderate Fire of
Coals, which afterward increase gradually: when you see a Fume beginning
to arise from the *Antimony,* stir it continually with an Iron
*Spatula*, without ceasing, as long as it will give forth from itself
any Fume. If in *Calcining*, the *Antimony* melt, or concrete into
Clots, then remove it from the Fire, and when cold again reduce it to a
subtle Powder, and as before calcine it, continually stirring as we
said, until no more Fume will ascend. If need be repeat this Operation
so often and so long, as until that *Antimony* put into the Fire, will
neither fume, nor concrete into Clots, but in Colour resemble White and
pure Ashes: Then is the calcination of *Antimony* rightly made.

\[GLASS OF ANTIMONY, SIMPLE\]

Put this *Antimony* thus calcined into a Goldsmiths Crucible set in a
Furnace, and urge the Fire with Bellows, or put it into a Wine-Furnace,
administering such Firee, as the *Antimony* may flow, like clear and
pure Water. Then, that you may certainly and infallibly prove, whether
the Glass made thereof be sufficiently cocted, and hath acquired a
transparent Colour, put a long rod of Iron cold into the Crucible, and
part of the glass will stick to the Iron, which with a hammer strike
off, and hold up against the Light, to see whether it be clear, clean
and transparent; if so, it is well, and perfectly mature.

Here let my Reader, unlearned and but a Beginner in Art, know (for I
write not to men skilled in this Art, who have often experienced the
powers of the fire, but to Candidates, *Tyro’s\**, and the studious
Disciples of the *Spagyrick* Science; because to make Glass of
*Antimony* is a thing common, and well known to many) know, I say, that
every Glass, whether made of Metals, Minerals, or any other Matter, must
be thoroughly cocted in Fire to due Maturity, that it may have a clear
and transparent Colour, and be apt for further Preparation to Medicinal
use: which translucid and pure Maturity *Vulcan* only effects in his
secret and hidden Nature. Therefore, let every man know, consider and
retain this.

\*

Rightly doth Basilius say, he writes to the Tyro’s of this Art, because
he begins with the Glass of Antimony, that is, from the very Rudiments
of Chymistry, and so accurately teacheth to make that, as no man how
ignorant soever can be deceived therein: yet the Ancients have not
seldom experienced, how often they have erred in the Praxis, for such I
have written these Commentaries. For me, let every One please himself in
his own Writings: surely I think I have offered somewhat, which
Posterity will always thankfully accept. For although I did for several
years most diligently read Basilius and other Masters of the Art of
Arts, and in Labouring following them, as exactly as possibly I could,
yet I committed so many Errors (the rememberance of which fills me with
Horror) lost so much Money, and was so often constrained to amend those
Errors with labour, as I have compassion of all Those, who would enter
into this way, incited thereunto by their earnest desire to help their
Neighbours: for I have no respect to Others, who aim at nothing but
Riches, and would make so noble an Art subservient to Avarice, the worst
of all Vices; let them sustain the dammage they deserve to suffer. But
do you, who are endued with a more noble Spirit, First seek the Kingdom
of GOD, which is either constituted or propagated by Charity to your
Neighbour, and all other Things, which other men so impiously seek,
shall spontaneously (which is the bounty of GOD) be added to you. I need
to use no great Arguments to persuade any man to read those
Commentaries; for every One’s own Business will sufficiently admonish
him, when he shall see me often with one word, and a most simple
Animadversion to save him so great Charges, which he hath too frequently
bestowed in labouring without success. I do here candidly profess to
thee, studious Reader, had the Manual Operations been as sincerely
showed to me, as I here open them, I should have saved a great Sum of
Money; for I very often erred, when I would over eagerly prosecute
certain Processes of others, and by that vain endeavour, lost some
Thousands of Florens. Yet I seldom twice repeated any of those
Operations, which out Author (most sincerely and openly, of all that I
know) hath in this Book inserted. I shall not here institute a
Tyrocinium of Chymistry, as other Authors, well known to young
Beginners, have already done; but I am willing, by Admonition to help
those, who long since could loose this Subject from its Bonds, and with
most fervent desire design to arive to the Goal exposed to their Eyes
and Mind, least either slippery Blood in the Way, or Entellus now lying
prostrate, should hinder them from gaining the proposed Reward, which is
Riches and Health.

When in the Method we have taught, you *Antimony* is converted into
Glass, take a Platter or Dish made of Copper, which is smooth and broad,
heat it hot at the Fire, otherwise your Matter will flie out; then pour
in the fluid Matter as thin as you can, and you will have pure, yellow,
transparent Glass of *Antimony*. This is the best way of preparing Glass
of *Antimony* *per se*, without addition; and this Glass, above all
others, is endewed with the greatest Virtue and Power, which it
manifests after its further Preparation. This is by me called *Pure*
Glass of *Antimony.*\*

\*

This is now the Common, and well known way of making Glass of Antimony,
which is profitable in many Operations: but to administer it so to the
Sick without Distinction, is a Work full of danger and peril. It indeed
succeeds happily, but this casual or accidental health of some, is not
of so great moment, as therefore to expose the Life of one man to Peril.
For I have seen a Sick man, who after he had taken but half an ounce of
the Infusion, vomited and purged above measure, and soon after died.
\[DOCTORS REPREHENDED\] hence are those Tears, hence those Clamours
arise against Chymists, as if the impious rashness of some false
Chymists were to be imputed to the Art, which PseudoChymists care not
how many Houses they fill with Funerals, provided one or two that are
healed will blaze their Fame, and they can hear themselves called
Doctors, and rob the simple of their money. The reason of this great
danger is, because all the Emetick force of Antimony contained in the
fixed Salt thereof, in which resides all its Venenosity, which weak
Natures cannot overcome, and therefore receive not so much good from the
Salutiferous virtue thereof, as hurt from its Venom. But this thing
should not deter sound men from the use of Antimony, since they see it,
even then when mixed with Venom, often to produce salutary Effects. They
should rather thus reason; if that salutiferous Virtue be freed fromt he
Noxious faculty, what Good would it not do, or what Diseases would it
not heal? Therefore, behold I here offer to you such Glass of Antimony,
as I myself use often, and may be used by every man, without any danger
of a mortal Catastrophe.

Take pure Glass of Antimony, made as Basilius here teachet, melt it in a
Crucible, and keep it in flux so long, as until a third part be
consumed. Then let it cool, and grind the same to an Impalpable Powder,
upon which pour Spirit of Wine highly rectified, until it stand three
fingers above the Powder; close the Vessel firmly, and circulate the
Matter for three Months; then by Distillation abstract the Spirit of
Wine, or if it be tinged with Redness, (which always will be, if you
have rightly operated) only pour it off, and keep it apart; for it is an
excellent Medicine. The remaining Body put into a Crucible, permit it to
flow, and then cast it into what Forms you will. For it can assume
whatsoever Shapes you will have it, which may be set in Rings, and worn
on the Hand. But its Medicinal use is thus.

Put this Glass for one Night in two ounces of Cold Wine, and in the
Morning let the Sick drink that Wine, and you will find very good
success, for it purgeth kindly, and if Nature incline to bring the
Matter upward, it performs that action moderately, causing gentle
Vomits. Only Note this: the prescribed Dose must be diminished,
according to the Strength, Age and Constitution of the Sick. Here,
Reader, candidly accept of this my first Admonition offer to thy self,
and expect to find more, if you willingly and intently peruse the after
following.

\[GLASS OF ANTIMONY WITH BORAX\]

For there are other Glasses prepared of *Antimony*, by Addition of
*Borax* and other things, in this manner.

Take of Crude *Antimony* one part, of *Venetian Borax* two parts; put
these together into a Crucible, which setting the Vessel in a
Wind-Furnace, or urging the Fire with Bellows, cause to flow, that they
may be well and perfectly mixed together, afterward pour out the Mixture
into a Pan, or Dish of Copper made hot, as thin as is possible, as
before was said in the Superior Preparation, and you will find you
*Antimony* fair and transparently clear, \*like a *Pyropus* or Ruby,
provided you observe the due and accurate Method, Operating as you
ought, in the Governing Fire.

\*

The Caution, to which our Author here ascribeds the Success, is that you
use a most strong Fire, such as is required for melting Gold: for
without this you cannot acquire the Redness of a Pyropus.

The Redness may be abstracted from this Red Glass, with Spirit of
Wine\*, and by long continued Circulation in Fire, be perfected, and
rendered a most excellent, profitable and efficacious Medicine.

\*

Not with common Spirit of Wine, but with Philosophic Spirit, which for
extracting this Tincture, I thus prepare. Take of Sal-Armoniac thrice
sublimed four ounces Spirit of Wine, distilled upon Salt of Tartar so,
as it may be perfectly dephlegmated: put them together in a Phial, which
place in heat of Digestion the Spirit may fully imbibe Sulphur or Fire
of the Sal- Armoniac; then distil the mixture by Alembic thrice, and you
will have a true Menstruum, wherewith to Extract that Redness from the
Glass of Antimony. Also the Tincture of this Glass is extracted with its
proper Vinegar, and by a further Operation is perfected, and becomes a
most excellent Medicament.

But a transparent white Glass of *Antimony*, after commixtion thereof,
is prepared in this manner.

\[ANOTHER GLASS OF ANTIMONY WITH BORAX\] Take *Antimony* beat or ground
small one part, *Venetian* *Borax* very pure four parts: put these, well
mixed together, into a Crucible, and cause the Mixture to flow well. At
first indeed it will be yellow, but if it stand longer in Fire, the
yellowness vanisheth, the Matter receives a white Colour, and
thenceforth becomes a fair and white Glass. Whether this colour be
brought to perfect Maturity, you may prove with a cold Iron, as above is
said. Many other ways, of *Antimony* may be formed Glasses\* consisting
almost of infinite Forms.

\*

Let him who desires to prepare more Glasses of Antimony, consult
Beguinus, Hartman, Crollius, and other Authors; we here acquiesce in
these proposed by Basilius.

But since my purpose here was not to describe other Glasses, then I
myself had experienced, and which manifest happy success in Healing, I
judged it unnecessary to waste Paper in describing them, or by a tedious
discourse to weary the Reader; especially since, unto you is already in
part proposed the principal Colour (*viz*. the Red) which is found in
Glass made of *Antimony*. The black Colour, which *Antimony* had before
Preparation, is now in a Spiritual manner flown up the Chimney; because
in such a Spiritual manner, very much of the Venomous Substance had left
it before, through the Expulsive force of the Fire, as by Calcination.
Yet because in this Preparation all the whole Venom is not taken away
from the Glass of *Antimony*, but it still retains very much thereof; I
am willing (now I have begun) further to reveal to you, which way the
Venom may wholly be removed from this Glass, and another Separation of
the Pure from the Impure, of the Venom from the Medicine, be instituted;
by which the Tongue of the *Orator* will be loosed, and occasion given
to him of largely expressing my Praises, and publishing the same, as
with a great Sound, through all Parts of this Inferiour Orb: which will
be a necessary Consequence of the Gratitude of my Disciples, when they
shall see with their Eyes, touch with their Hands, and with their
Understanding comprehend, that I do their great profit, have declared to
them the very Truth, without Deceit, and made them the Heirs of a
memorable Testament.

Therefore the first Separation of the Sulphur from its Body, and the
Extraction of the Tincture from its Salt, is performed in this manner.
Take pure Glass of *Antimony*, as I taught you to make it, without the
adjunction of any other Thing, Grind it to subtle Powder\* impalpable as
Flower;

\*

What I here shall advise is short, but very profitable, without which
what the Author appoints cannot be done, nor by beating or by grinding
in a Mortar can you ever bring the Body to a requisite fineness, much
less upon a Porphyry Stone can you grind the same. Therefore first beat
it in a Mortar, afterward mix it with distilled Vinegar, that it may
have the Consistency of a soft Paplike matter, and so grind it upon a
Porphry Stone, as Painters grind their Colours, and undoubtedly you will
obtain your desire.

Which powder put into a Glass with a Plain flat bottom, called a
Cucurbit, and there pour upon it strong Vinegar well rectified: then set
the Vessel in a Digestive fire, or if it be Summer, expose it to the
Sun, stiring it twice or thrice\* a Day, and so long digest it in that
temperate heat, as until the vinegar contract a Yellow Colour inclining
to Redness, like the colour of most clean and well purified Gold.

\*

Thou art happy, if thou canst be wise by my Dammage, O Love of Art. I
exactly followed this short Admonition, stirring the Cucurbit twice or
thrice a Day, but the Matter was always coagulated like a Stone, and
stuck so firmly to the bottom, as it could by no force be removed
thence; but afterward, being more wary, from the first I began to stir
the Matter with a Wooden Spatula five or six times a Day, or oftner; you
may imitate the same, if you be wise, not only here, but also in the
Superior Preparation of Antimony, and in every Extraction of Tincture
from Antimony.

Then pour off this clear and pure Extraction, and pour on fresh Vinegar,
and repeat the Operation, as long as the Vinegar is tinged, and until no
more Tincture can be extracted. Filter all these Extractions mix’d
together, and put them into a Glass Body, with its Head annexed, and by
*B.M.* distil off the Vinegar; until in the Bottom remain a Yellow
Powder, inclining to Redness. Upon this Powder pour distill Rain-water
often times, and as often distill it off again, still pouring on fresh
distilled Rain-water. Repeat this labour so long, as until the Powder
remain Sweet and \*grateful.

\*

Our most sincere Author here deceives you not, but conceals a certain
manual Operation, which if you attend to me clearly discovering the
same, the Work itself will never fail to Answer your desire. If you have
much Tincture, you must have a great Cucurbit; if Little, a less will
serve. For if you take a greater Vessel, than your Tincture requires,
the vinegar must necessarily have a great fire to cause it to ascend, by
reason of the height it must unavoidably rise, or it cannot be
distilled; and in sustaining so forcible a Fire, there is great danger
of Corrupting the Tincture itself. Here also is required another
Caution; viz. this, after two thirds are distilled off, you must change
your Vessel and put the remaining Matter into a less Glass body, and
thence distill off the Vinegar, until the Remanency acquire the just
thickness of a Poultis. Also take heed, as Basilius seems to intimate,
that you distil not off the Vinegar unto dryness, lest the Tincture by
Adustion be wholly corrupted.

Notwithstanding all This my own Precaution now given, I could not
choose, but labour a whole year to little purpose, often repeating this
Tincture with a vain endeavour, whence I was almost as often weary of
Chymistry through desperation; for my Tincture was of no efficacy in
Medicine; because a meer Caput-Mortuum only, unsavoury and of no value.
Hence consider how little any Process profits, whether set down in
Writing, or received from a Friend by word of mouth, unless you set to
your hand, and practically learn every particular of the Work fit to be
observed in operating. Also see, how liberally I deal with you, in
revealing that, the ignorance of which hath put me into great trouble
and charge. The manual Operation, which is requisite for edulcorating
this Pap-like Matter remaining in the bottom, is this. Upon this Matter
pour distilled Water, and gently abstract the same by Balneo. When you
have repeated this a third time, you will find the Water to come off
sweet; which time must be observed and with very great diligence. For if
you be deceived in that, your work is at an end, all your labour lost,
and you shall get nothing, but a Caput Mortuum. For as soon as twenty,
or at most thirty drops of sweet water come forth, an Acidity appears
again and distils forth, which the unwary judging to be an Acidity of
the Vinegar formerly added, proceed in distilling, expecting the Water
to come forth sweet; but this being the Acidity of Antimony, which (the
Vinegar being extracted) immediately follows the Sweet Water, that
persisting to distil destroys the whole Virtue of the Antimony, and
leaves nothing remaining but an unsavoury Caput-Mortuum. Therefoer be
thou more wary, and as soon as this Sweet Water comes forth, cease to
distil, and take out the Pap-like Matter residing in the Bottom, and
putting that into another Glass, permit it to dry at the Solar-Heat; or
else evaporate all its Moisture with most gentle Fire, that it may
remain a dry Powder: and when you have avoided this danger, then go on.

\[TINCTURE OF ANTIMONY, FROM ITS GLASS\]

This Powder grind upon a Marble or Glass, first made hot; then put it in
a Glass Body, and pour upon it of the best rectified *Spirit of Wine*,
so much as will stand above it three Fingers thickness: then set it in a
Digestive heat, as above, for extracting the *Tincture* *of Antimony*,
which will be high coloured and pleasantly red to amazement; and it will
deposit a certain Earth, or feculency in the bottom.

This *Extraction* is sweet, grateful, and so very efficacious in
*Medicine*, as no man, that hath not experienced the same, will give
credit thereunto. The *Feces* in the bottom retain the Venenosity, but
the *Extraction* Medicine only, which Experience hath taught to be
profitable Remedy for men and Beasts. For if three or four Granes of
this Medicine be taken, it expels the *Leprosie* and *Gallick Lues*,
purifies the *Blood*, drives away *Melancholy*, and resists all Venom:
and whosoever labours with *Shortness of Breath*, Difficulty of
Breathing, or Pricking of the Sides, he may be cured by the Use of this
Medicine: \*which effects many wonderful Things, if rightly
administered, and in due time.

\*

These Medicaments, which perform their Operations, not by sensible
force, as Catharticks, Emeticks, Diaphoreticks, and the like are wont to
operate, but insensibly uniting their own more pure Universal Spirit
unto our Spirits, amend Nature and restore it to health, are not to be
used, unless where the Body hath first been cleansed from the impurities
of pecant Humours, otherwise you cast these Peals into a Dunghill, where
(overwhelmed with Filths) they cannot shine and manifest their Virtues.
For although, by reason of their manifold Virtues, they may be called
Universals, yet they are to be numbered with Topicks, before which
Generals are to be used, according to the opinion of Galen, and all
Physicians.

The Tincture here spoken of, performs all those Cures, which Basilius
mentions, if the use of it be continued for some time. For where that
Saying is of force, Medicines used help, continued heal, it must
certainly be applied to those especially, which insensibly operate.

That Yellow Powder, of which mention is made above before it is
extracted with Spirit of Wine, may be ground upon a hot Stone, and then
put into Eggs\* boiled hard, in place of the Yolk, which is to be taken
out: set these Eggs in a moist Place, or Cellar, and the Powder will
resolve into a yellow Liquor.

\*

Indeed soft Eggs, according to the Saying; are always warily and softly
to be handled; but in these hard Eggs also, I have somewhat to advise
you of; for if after you have taken out the Yolk, you be not mindful to
break that Pellicle, which divides it from the wHite, you will wonder to
see how your Balsom will intrude itself within the White, and deprive
you of a great part thereof.

This admirable *Liquor* heals all green *Wounds*, if soon after a Wound
is made, it be put therein with a soft Feather, and the Wound well
covered with a Styptick, or other Preservative Playster. All fresh
Wounds inflicted either by Prick or Cut, are healed by this Liquor,
without Putrefaction, Inflammation, or any superfluity of Filth, so
perfectly; as unto him, who created Heaven and Earth, and in them
insited such a Medicine, due Thanks and Praise deservedly ought to be
given. In all old, malignant, and corrosive Wounds, use this
*Extraction* or *Balsom* of *Antimony*, and it will never fail Thee in
thy necessity. And thou thy self, after me wilt write an *Encomium* of
its Praises and publish the Virtues thereof, by which extrenally applied
miserable Mortals may be made happy: for the Wolf and \*Cancer yeild to
it; Rottenness in the Bones, malignant Ulcers corroded and perforate
with Worms fly from it, and it restores to pristine Health, and provides
Entertainment for that with itself, when its fixedness shall be duly
used inwardly, and other Convenient Means duly applied outwardly.

\*

If Chirurgions would here give credit to our Author, with how great Care
would they prepare this Balsom for themselves, and with how great Fruit,
and how frequently might they use the same? For I interposing my
Judgement must say, that Basilius here comes far short, in expressing
its due Praises; for it performs more, than he declares of it. \[HISTORY
OF THE VIRTUES OF BALSOM OF ANTIMONY\] One short History, drawn from the
Centuries of my Medicinal Observations, will confirm the truth of what I
have said. A certain Woman, about forty Years of Age, for seven years
together suffered great dolours in her left Breast, which were
accompanied with a Tumor and Hardness. Those Chirurgeons and Physicians,
who she advised with, did all with one Consent judge her Disease to be a
Cancer; and she was also judged to labour with a Cancer, by the Censure
of that famous Practitioner, who at Orscotus (a Village about the
Dukes-Wood) very laudably and happily practised Chirurgery, and drew to
himself a vast number of People: for after he had, for three Month
together, in vain endeavoured to heal this Disease, he severely
pronounced her Breast was to be cut off, or the Disease could not be
extirpated. The woman, resolving rather to suffer all Dolours of the
Disease, then to sustain so cruel and inhumane a Remedie, came to me. I,
beholding her Breast, found it wholly inflamed, and twise as big as the
other, and an abundance of thin Humours flowing to the Wound. I purposed
to try all I could do, rather than suffer this miserable Woman to
perish; and thinking of this Balsom resolved to try, whether That, which
in other Diseases had fulfilled the promises of its Author, would fail
me here. Therefore, to the Diseased Woman waiting my Answer, I said; in
eight days time I would resolve her, whether, there was an hopes of Cure
or not, without Cutting off; and thereupon gave her this Remedy to
anoint her Breast therewith: and which is very strange, in the Space of
two Days the Matter came to Ripeness, and a just Consistency. Therefore,
I then filled with good hope, adjoined inward and outward Remedies,
which seemed convenient for the purpose, and in two Months Space the
Womans Breast was perfectly healed. Upon this I, not without a perculiar
Joy, blessed and praised the Lord, that had conferred so great virtue on
this Balsom.

\[OIL OF ANTIMONY, FROM ITS GLASS BY DISTILLATION\]

Also Glass of *Antimony* is by me two ways reduced to an Oil, in
distillation (as they call it) by Alembeck.

Take Glass of *Antimony*; as it is made of the *Minera* of *Antimony*,
subtily pulverized, and extract its Tincture with distilled Vinegar;
afterward abstract the Vinegar thence and edulcorate the remaining
Powder. Then pour on Spirit of Wine, with which extract the Tincture,
and circulate it in a Pelican well closed, for an entire Month.
Afterward, distil it per se, without any Addition, with a certain
singular \*Dexterity; and you will thence receive a wonderful grateful
and sweet Medicine, in the form of a Red Oil, of which after may be
formed the Stone of Fire.

\*

This is the Work, this is the Labour, very few true Sons of Art (whom
Apollo loves) could extract this Tincture by Alembeck. There is need (as
Basilius saith) of a certain peculiar manual Operation. This Tincture I
sought many years, and at length (GOD favouring me) found the same.
\[OIL OF ANTIMONY, ITS PREPARATION ENIGMATICALLY DESCRIBED\] Wilt thou
have me discover it to Thee by an Enigma? I see thou desirest I should,
therefore take this Mystery, thus. Alciatus, painting a Dolphin wreathed
about an Anchor, write these words: Make not too much hast. Esteem of
this Admonition, not only in all your Life, but also in this very
matter, as very profitable to you: for the hasty Bitch (as the Saying
is) brings forth blind Whelps. Therefore I again and again admonish you,
to cause Wings to be prepared for your Matter, by Juno, Bacchus and
Vulcan; but as you love your Life, permit it not suddenly to flie,
rather deliver it to Mercury to be instructed by him gradually to
accustom itself to flying; yea, bind it with a Cord, lest (as a Bird got
out of a Cage, and past your Reach) it through Ignorance approach too
near the Sun, and with Icarus, having its Feathers burnt fall headlong
into the Sea. But after you have detained it for its due time, loose its
bonds, that it may fly, and come to those fortunate Islands, unto which
all Sons of Arts direct their Sight, and where unto all Adeptists aim to
arrive, as unto their desired and long sought Harbour. Here, O Lover of
Art, you should not be offended, or angry with me, as if I deluded you
(desirous of the Knowledge of this Secret) by a Tantalick Apple shown.
What should I do? I in this Case give you advice. Would you have me cast
Pearls before Swine? and unto all men expose the Mystery, which the
Ancient kept so holily, and might not reveal it, unless to the worthy
Sons of Art only? Thou thy self wouldest bewail nothing more, and
wouldest even execrate me, for doing so. They, who understand me,
understand Art: and unto such as are Chymists, have I opened the way,
which if they diligently travel in, they may arrive, where they desire
to be. No man did ever so clearly reveal this to me; but by reading the
Writings of Authors, strenuously labouring, and trusting in GOD without
fainting or desperation (which is a most efficatious kind of Prayer) I
at length attained to what I have. Do thou study, and be diligent, that
thou mayest comprehend: for he, who, knows how to render Tinctures
volatile, is already admitted into the very Penetrale, and Conclave of
the Chymical Art; because of all other Mysteries the Method is the same.
Peruse the Fables, search into the Riddles, and consider the Parables of
all wise men; they all tend hither, and all say the same. Compare the
Parables of others, with this my Enigma, and this with them, that you
may understand how much Light I have added in all, and how Easy I have
made the way to those serene Temples of Wisdom.

\[QUINTESSENCE OF ANTIMONY, WHAT\]

This Oil is the *Quintessence*, and the highest, that can be written of
*Antimony*; as you may find in my former Writings, wherein Ihave made a
short Declaration of *Antimony*, and in which I showed also, that there
are four *Instruments* required for its *Preparation*, and the fifth is
that, in which *Vulcan* hath fixed his Residence*.* Understand thus:
four *Preparations* must be made before it can be perfected; and the
fifth is the Utility, and effect of the Work in the Body of man. The
first Labour is *Calcination* and *Liquefaction* into Glass. The second
is *Digestion*, by which *Extraction* is performed. The third is
*Coagulation*. The fourth is *Distillation* into Oil, and after that
Separation follows *Fixation*, by the ultimate *Coagulation*, through
which the Matter is deduced to a perlucid *Fiery Stone*; which that it
may operate upon Metals, must be fermented, for acquiring its
penetrative Property; but not so much, as that Ancient Stone of the
Philosophers, because it is not Universal; but only tingeth
particularly. Touching which, about the End of this Book, more shall be
spoken when we treat of the Stone of Fire.

This distilled Oil\* of which we have now spoken, effects all things,
that are necessary to be known by a *Physician*, and which he hath need
of, in his

Cures.

\*

Had I not known Basilius, I should have thought him, in this place to
have dealt like a Deceiver, or Vagabond Medicaster with you: but the
Matter itself unto me, so often speaks for him, as I religiously scruple
even in the least to doubt his Promises. For whatsoever I have
experienced (but there are very few Processes contained in this Book,
which I have not tried: for He, from the very first, was my Teacher,
Friend and Patron) I have found so very efficacious beyond the Authors
Promises, that it seems to me, he hath been sparing in declaring the
virtues of his Medicaments, least in praising them, he should be thought
too much to commend himself. Yet I shall not here in his stead,
undertake comment much on their laudable Virtues. Let him who believes
not, make trial, that he may know. Whosoever shall by his own
incredulity be deterred from experiencing the Truth hereof, he will
suffer punishment enough for his Offence, by the Want of the fruit of
the same. For this Oil, if rightly used in its time, is a Medicine truly
Universal. Consider, I pray, what I say, if rightly used in its time,
that is, the Body being firsted purged from gross and crude Humours, and
general Medicines used (as you may remember I did before admonish) this
Oil is an Universal Medicine, for healing all Diseases Curable. For
Chymists are not so mad, or conceited, by reason of the Goodness and
Virtue of their Medicaments, as not to judge some Diseases to be
Unsanable. Who can restore any of the Prnicipal Members absumed by
putridness? yet I would not have all Diseases judged unsanable, by these
our Chymical Remedies, which are everywhere vulgarly condemned as such.
As for Example, how often have I restored the Crystalline Humour taken
away; which who judgeth not impossible to be reduced? But, of these and
the like, another place will be more fit to write. Only of this
Medicament I say, that it heals Feavers of every kind; yea, even the
Quartan itself (that ancient Reproach of Physicians) and in Chronical
Distempers manifests wonderful Effects. Here among many of my
Observations I will give you one only Experiment. \[HISTORY OF DROPSY
CURED\] In the Year 1665. A young Maid, aged twenty one Years, swollen
to an enormous grossness with the Dropsie, came to me for help. I took
this only for her Medicine. For I gave her no other thing, then this
very Medicament twice a Day, to which I dayly added a Clister: and in
twenty days she had sweat so much, as her Body was lessened half. Within
that space of twenty Days, as I said, she also voided of Urine (provoked
by the same Medicament) not a little, but her Sweat was wonderful.

Note: me Friend, and Lover of Art, that this Oil, whether you prepare it
yourself, or receive it from antoher prepared by him, doth not imitate
other Diaphoreticks in operating, which being used, will in their first
Dose provoke Sweats. For if this be given to a Patient whose Body is
obstructed with Humours, the first Dose acts nothing, but gently opens
the Passages, that Sweats may be procured; the next day it causeth a
gentle and kindly breathing of Sweats only; the third Day it Sweats
moderately; but the fourth Day, and thence forward, it causeth such an
aboundance of Sweat, as the Waters proceeding thence run through the Bed
upon the Floor. here is need of a true Physician; Hercules Club will
profit little, if not in the Hand of Hercules himself.

\[THE QUINTESSENCE OF ANTIMONY, ITS WONDERFUL VIRTUES\]

The Dose of it before Coagulation is eight Grains taken in Wine. It
makes a man very young again, delivers him from all Melancholy, and
whatsoever in the Body of man grows and increaseth, as the Hairs and
Nails, fall off, and the whole man is renewed as a *Phoenix* (if such a
feigned Bird, which is only here for Example sake named by me, can
anywhere be found upon Earth) is renewed by Fire. And this Medicine can
no more be burned by the Fire, than the Feathers of that unknown
*Salamander*: for it consumes all Symptoms in the Body, like consuming
Fire, to which it is deservedly likened; it drives away every Evil, and
expels all That, which *Aurum-Potabile* is capable to expel. The
\**Astrum* of *Sol* only exceeds every Medicine of the World when
rightly prepared to perfect Fixation: for the *Astrum* of *Sol*, and the
*Astrum* of *Mercury* arise almost from the very same Blood of their
Mother, and from one original of vivifick Sanity.

\*

Let no man here prodigally or rashly wast his own Gold, now he hears of
the Astrum of Sol, nor expose himself to so great Hazard, as to enter a
perillous Combat with vulgar Mercury. In the Chymical World another Sol
shines, and another Mercury attends on Jupiter. Yet the Chymical Sol, or
Mercury here, is not Gold, but more excellent than all Gold; yea, more
potent than every Mercury, although fabulous, and feigned to be capable
to restore the Dead to Life: it is the Gold, and Argent-Vive of
Philosophers, which Basilius here hints at. But we have treated, and
must treat of Antimony only.

Now, no man hath cause to fear, that this Oil of *Antimony* Extracted
first with distilled Vinegar, and afterward with most pure and subtle
Spirit of Wine, and then further exalted (as highly as possible) by
*Vulcan*, will in any wise purge, or excite frequent Stools, or make any
Alterations: for it effects nothing of all this, but by Sweat, Urine,
and Spittle, expels the very Root of the Disease to amazement, and
restores whatsoever is corrupted by any Symptom.

But Common Glass of *Antimony*, being ground to Powder, put into a
little Wine (*viz.* six Grains or more of the Glass, according to the
strength of Nature) and that mixture set in heat for one Night, and in
the Morning the Wine\* poured off clear from the remaining Powder, and
so drunk by the Patient, purgeth downward exciting several Stools, and
oftentimes also provokes Vomiting, by reason of the Mercurial immature
Property, which is yet inherent in the Glass, as every intelligent
Physician will easily judge, and indeed he ought to further to Examine
how this Glass, when he would purge with it, ought to be provoked, and
administed in a due Dose.

\*

This is a Common Vomitory, or Emetick Wine, well known, which all
wandering Empiricks now use in all Places, sometimes with a prosperous,
sometimes with Contrary, always ambiguous Success; which proceeds partly
from the Physician and partly from the Medicine. \[HISTORY OF GEORGE
CASTRIOT\] This is a Thing to be bewayled; for as histories relate, that
George Castriot King of the Epirots, when the Emperour of the Turks had
often asked him, how his Sword, which he had sent, when Peace was made,
according to his agreement with the Turk, could perpetrate such wonders
as he spake of, saying he saw not anything singular in it, made this
Answer: I did indeed send the Sword of Scanderbeg, but not Scanderbeg’s
Arm, with which that Sword was managed, so as to perform so great
Miracles: so, very many Chymical Medicines, are either dead, or (which
is more to be deplored) oftentimes the Causes of Death, when not managed
by the hand of a skilful Doctor. Which unhappy Success of this Medicine
is caused from the Mercurial Properties, with which it is too much
impregnated (as Basilius well notes in this Place) and which I am wont
to correct in this manner.

Take Glass of Antimony, more pure, four ounces. Venetian Borax one-half
ounce. Melt them together. This being artificially done, you will have a
Green Glass transparent as Emerald. Grind this to a subtle Powder, upon
which pour French wine, and permit the mixture to stand for several days
in Moderate Heat.

Of this Wine give to the Sick, from one drachma to two ounces, according
to the Age, Habit of Body, Strength, and other Things either Natural, or
not Natural, which the Prudence of the Physician (when he sits as Judge,
whether the Life of any One is likely to be continued or not) ought
always well to consider. That is Emetick Wine may be given to the Sick
without peril, Experience the most certain Mistress of Physicians hath
taught me, and yet more than this: for when the Wine poured in the
Powder shall be all exhausted, if you pour on more French Wine, that
will also be imbibed with the same Virtues. For here Antimony discovers
in itself to be somewhat, that is of all wonderful Things the most
admirable: because it contains in itself inexhaustable Treasures, and
although you take from it, yet you diminish not the Virtues thereof. A
like stupendous Miracle also is in extracting the Vinegar of the same,
and in other Works fit to be kept under the seal of Harpocrates.

Many men are required for the Searching out the Powers and Virtues of
this Subject. For I alone, by reason of the shortness of my Time, could
not dive into and search out all things, do you thy self set about the
Work, and after me, yea with me, thou wilt praise me and I thee: if you
find out anymore; I praise you by these my Writings, and shall commend
you out of the Sepulcher to which I am destinated, although in Body thou
art to me unknown, nor ever had I any discourse with thee, because
perhaps not yet born.

\[OIL OF ANTIMONY MADE ANOTHER WAY\]

Common Glass of *Antimony* is also by Addition distilled into a laudable
and salutary oil, which may be used without peril, with very great
profit in the *Epilepsie*; as here following I shall teach.

Grind the Glass of *Antimony* to as subtle a Powder as possibly you can,
then put it into a Glass-Vessel with a flat Bottom, and pour upon the
Powder the *Juice of unripe Grapes*, then having well luted hte Vessel
digest it for certain Days. This being done abstract all the Juice;
afterward, grind it well moistened with Spirit of Vinegar, and a double
Weight of clarified Sugar. Then, having put it into a Retort, in the
Name of the Most High begin to distil, and at last administer a vehement
Fire, and you will acquire a most Red Oil; which must be clarified unto
Transparency with \*Spirit of Wine.

\*

When the Author saith, it must be clarified with Spirit of Wine unto
Transparency; the Admonition is short indeed, but of great weight. For
he wills, that this Oil should be driven over by Alembeck, the
signification and manual Operation of which, I have already above
taught.

The Use of this, given in a small Quantity, is found to be most
profitable. With this Oil Spirit of Salt may be joined, and the Mixture
poured upon a subtle prepared Calx of Gold, (which how it should be made
I have already taught in other of my writings) which hath before,
together with its Water, passed by Alembeck. If this be done, this
*Menstruum* take to itself the Tincture\* of Gold only, and leaves the
Body untouched.

\*

Do you think, O Lover of Chymistry, you understand what you read? You
cannot understand, unless either divinely Philip, or humanely Oedipus,
appear to you, and clearly teach you the way of preparing this Tincture.
The difficulty of the Enigma consists in this; viz. that all Menstruums,
with which Tinctures are extracted, must necessarily be void of Colour;
otherwise how can you know: whether you obtain the Tincture you would
extract, or only retract the same you poured on? I will not detain you
with a tedious Discourse full of ambiguities, but lead you asi t were by
the hand, showing you how I instituted this Process in the Year 1665. If
you thence, by your attention, and comparing the precedent with the
present, and these with thsoe that follow, reap any profit, open the
Bosom of your Heart, that no part of this may fall to Earth.

I took that Red Oil, thus far prepared as is already showed, and
rectified it by Retort; and then acquired a White Oil, of an acid but
grateful Taste. Upon this I poured half so much Spirit of Salt: the
Mixture I digested in a Phial for a full Month, that these two Spirits
might be well conjoined; afterward, for the better conjunction of them,
I distilled them thrice by Retort. Then I poured them upon the Calx of
Gold (the Method of preparing which you will find in other Writings of
Basilius) and set them together in Digestion for a Month; which being
elapsed, the Menstruum was tinged with a deep Yellow Colour inclining to
redness. I leisurely poured off the Tincture, and having put it into a
Retort, with gentle Fire abstracted the Humidity, that a red Powder
might remain in the Bottom. This Powder I edulcorated with distilled
Water, and again extracted the Tincture with Spirit of Wine; then I
rendered this Dragon volatile, and gave him his own Tail to be devoured
for six whole Months, and obtained a Tincture most pleasant and
grateful; ten or twelve Grains of which given to the Sick, provoke
Sweat, comfort the Natural Powers, and (not to amuse the Intelligent
words) in all Diseases both of Humane and other bodies, it is an
universal Medicine.

Since it hath happened to me here to make mention of the most excellent
of all Tinctures, I will once teach the Chymist what will be of use to
him for the future. That is to say, it is of great concern to know, with
what Menstruum every Tincture should be extracted, For it is not
sufficient (according to the erroneous Opinion of many) that Menstruums
be sweet and void of Corrosion; but it also behooful, that there be in
them a peculiar Amity and Conveniency with the Mercury of the Body, on
which they are poured, that from the same they may extract its true and
sincere Sulphur. By Example, I shall teach you somewhat more clearly.
Distilled Water extracts the Tincture from Sulphur, made of the Glass of
Antimony by distilled Vinegar. But if in this Operation you persuade
yourself you have separated the Pure from the Impure, you will be
deceived: for this Water imbibes a certain Salt, which infects the
Tincture; but Spirit of Wine rectified is its proper Menstruum: because
That only assumes the volatile Sulphur thereof, and hath no Commerce
with the Salt.

The same happens in Tincture of Corals, which is extracted with Spirit
of Wine distilled upon Orange Pills: for here you obtain not the sincere
Tincture of Corals; because, by this Menstruum, the pure Sulphur is not
separated from the Body of the Corals. The like Error to be committed in
many other Things, I have observed by Experience, which should be
esteemed the best Mistress, unless we take it for granted that
chargeable and fruitless Processes are necessarily required in this Art.
But that I may conclude with the Tincture, whence all this Discourse
hath proceeded; I would have no man to think this to be the Aurum
Potabile of Philosophers: for this would be a very great Error in
Philosophy, and give occasion to Sophisters (as their manner is) to
prefer their Sophisms before the Truth itself. Though this Tincture is
most precious, and a Tincture of Gold, yet it hath only assumed the
Colour of Gold: but the weight thereof, which is proper to Aurum
Potabile, adheres not thereunto.

Touching the potable Medicine here is not place of speaking, unless I
would trangress the limits, which I have at this time prescribed myself,
of Commenting upon the Triumphant Chariot of Antimony, which our Basil
Valentine hath made for it is so truly magnficent. Otherwise, I should
declare, how sol might be prepared by Venus and Vulcan, so as in the
space of two hours to resolve itself into Mercury united with Bacchus,
leaving very few feces; which Mercurial Menstruum may again be separated
from the resolved Gold; and so you might acquire a most grateful Liquor
very ponderous, which can never afterward be reduced to its former
Consistence. This very Operation I have showed to some Curious Lovers of
Chymistry. But of these elsewhere another Occasion of Writing will be
given.

\[LABOUR, NECESSARILY REQUIRED\]

When the Fermentation is made, I shall have need of a vast Quantity of
Paper to declare all the *Arcanum’s* of Nature, which by this Medicine
are effected beyond the Opinion of all men. I urge this so much the more
earnestly to the Physician, that he may consider those things which I
propose Philosophically, betake himself to labour, perform this
Preparation of *Antimony*, and deduce it to Use; then, he himself will
dayly find more Praise, and learn from it more Operations than any of
the other Physicians could have prescribed him.

When you shall have brought *Antimony* so far, and duely perfercted your
Work, in which you are to act prudently, and the matter is to be largely
and profoundly weighed, that by Labour you may acquire Experience; then
may you boast that you have obtained the Magistery, which is known or
communicated to few. This Magistery mix’d with a solution or Tincture of
Corals, and exhibited with Cordial Water effects Wonders in Diseases,
that are to be cured by purifying the Blood. And whatsoever Distemper is
offered to you, in which the Blood is corrupted by any Accident, this
Magistery heals it, exhilarates the Heart, promotes Chastity and
Honesty, and renders man apt and fit for everything he takes in hand.

For all these Benefits to the *Creator* and *Conserver* of all Things,
thanks is always to be given from the bottom of our Heart; because he
hath with so great Compassion respected his *Creatures,* Infirm both in
body and Mind, and supplied us with Means, by which the Diseases of
either may be healed, and we in every necessity obtain solace,
assistance and perfect Help.

Now my Intention is to proceed, and speak somewhat of the *Arcanum* of
*Antimony*, but with very great Brevity.

Take of *Antimony* most subtlely pulverized One Part, of Sal
Armoniack\*, so called, which is brought from *Armenia*,

\*

Of Antimony and Sal-Armoniack equal parts are to be taken, which
Basilius seems to intend, but I know not how he forgot to mention it.

also pulverized; mix these, and putting them into a Retort distill them
together,\*

\*

That with one and the same labour, the Sal-Armoniack together with the
Antimony, may be distilled and sublimed, such an instrument, as this I
here show you, describing all its Parts, may be made.

A.. is the Furnace. B. the Retort. C. the Recipient. D. the Aperture wit
ha Pipe of a Moderate bigness, on which may be set the Alembeck E. The
other Furnace is F, which containing a Moderate Fire, sublimes what
falls into the receiving Vessel up into the Alembeck E. And so the
Matter which is distilled from Retort B, by the Fire of the Furnace F,
is presently sublimed; Which may not only be useful in this Case, but
also in every Sublimation of other Matters.

and upon that which comes forth in the Distillation pour common
distilled Rain-water, but let it first be made hot, and so by
edulcorating remove all the *Salt*, that no Acrimony may remain, and the
*Antimony* will appear like pure, white shining Feathers. Dry them with
subtle Heat, and having put them in a Glass circulatory or Pelican, pour
on them good and perfectly rectified *Spirit of Vitriol*, and Circulate
the Mixture till both be well conjoined\* and united, then distill the
whole, and pour on Spirit of Wine, circulate again; then let seperated
be made, and remove the *Feces* settling to the Bottom, but keep the
*Arcanum* which remains mixt with the *Spirit* of *Wine* and *Vitriol*.

\*

This Union must be so firm, as in distilling one may not be separated
from the other; otherwise you will lose your Labour and Cost. Of how
great moment this Union is in Chymistry, they best know, who only by
confounding two things together, think they shall effect wonders; but
afterwards (their Experience failing them) they learn how great
difference there is between Union and Confusion: for Things confounded
receive no Virtue, that was not in them before; but by Union, I know not
what Spirit is ingested, which performs such things as the Mind of man
could never perceive to have their being thence.

Hence consider in the Generations of Animals (who would believe it!) how
from the Union of Elements is generated Sight, Taste, Touching, and so
many Powers of Animals, which are insited in none of the Elements, and
yet arise from them united. Whensoever it happens, that any Tincture
seems to have united itself with its Menstruum, and afterward may be
separated therefrom, that therefore is because Matrimony is not
legitimately Celebrated, nor the union in a due manner perfect; which
you shall more than once see to happen in the Tincture of Sol and
Antimony.

The Instrument, by which conjoin my Tinctures, and am wont to copulate
them in an undissolvable Copulation, you shall find described hereafter
in this very Book. That in Spirit of Wine is to be noted, which happens
not in other Menstruums; because it is most easily united to Things, and
again with a slight artifice separated from the same.

Now when you again rectify this *Arcanum*, one drop of it exhibited with
Rose water, is more available than a Pot full of the Decoction of Herbs;
for it causeth a good Appetite, corrects the Stomach, and concocts all
malignity in it, drives away Sadness and Melancholy, makes good Blood
and a good Digestion; in the Suffocation of the Matrix and Cholick
Passion (both which it wonderfully appeaseth) it is instead of a
Treasure of inestimable Price and deserves Commendation, not easily
expressible by Words.

\[ELIXIR OF ANTIMONY\]

After the *Arcanum* of *Antimony* next in order follows the *Elixir\**
of the same, which you may prepare in this manner.

\*

This Process as it is easy to perform, so it may by us be easily passed
over, lest we should seem to take Pen in hand, rather from an itching
desire of Writing, then for illuminating Things obscure.

Take, in the name of the Lord, good *Minera* of *Antimony*, grind it
subtlely, and sublime it with half so much *Sal-Armoniack*. Whatsoever
shall be sublimed put into a Glass retort, and thrice distill it,
seperating the Feces everytime. Afterward remove from it the
*Sal-Armoniack* by edulcoration, and reverberate the Matter of
*Antimony* in a Vessel well closed, with moderate Fire (not forcing too
much) until it become like the Earth of *Cinnabar*. This being done,
pour on it strong distilled Wine Vinegar, and extract its Redness;
afterward abstract the Vinegar, until a Powder remain. This abstraction
must be made in *Balneo*. Then, extract this Powder with Spirit of Wine,
that the *Feces* may be separated, and you will have a pure and clear
Extraction. Having finished this Operation, put this Spirit of Wine
together with the Extraction into a *Cucurbit*, and add thereto a little
of the Tincture of Corals, and of the Quintessence of Rubarb, and then
administer the Dose of three or four Grains.

It causeth gentle Stools, and purgeth without Gripings of the Belly; and
indeed if you have proceeded well in preparing, it renders the Blood
agile, and is a Medicine apt for those who desire Gentle Purgations.

Here perhaps some *Physician* may wonder, how ‘tis possible, that this
Medicine should cause moderate and easy Purgations, when as *Antimony*
is a Matter vehement and forcible, and to it is joined Rubarb, which of
itself also hath a Purging Property. But let him cease his admiration,
and know that the venomous purging power of *Antimony* is by this
Preparation so mortified, as it can apprehend or expel nothing; but as
soon as some purging Simple is adjoined to it, it then according to the
powers of its own Nature performs the Office of opening and purging. But
*Antimony* prepared hath no action upon the \*Stomach, thence to expel
its impurities; but by the purging Medicine, its adjunct, acquires a
more open Field, and therein can operate without Impediment any other
way, and discern, yea search out the way of Effecting that better, to
which it was ordained and prepared, without hindrance.

\*

\[CARTHARTICKS EXPEL BUT CORRECT NOT\] Note here very seriously, that
Galenick Catharticks have power of expelling, but not of Correction
Humours; but Chymical Purgers are endued with either Faculty; and
certainly it should not be minded how much is expelled, but how much is
healed, which the occult power of Medicaments prepared Chymically doth
much better effect, than that common and publick violence of purging
forcibly.

 

59\. \[ELIXIR OF ANTIMONY, ITS VIRTUES\]

I would have all men to credit these words, since I have no necessity to
write other than the Truth. This *Elixir* in such manner prepared, as I
have taught, penetrates and purgeth the Body, as *Antimony* purgeth
Gold, and frees it from all Impurity: So that if I would at large
commemorate all the powers and virtues thereof, I must put up my
Supplications to the *GOD* of Heaven, and intreat him to vouchsafe me a
longer Life, that I might laud his wonderful Works, and search out
further, and according to Verity communicate to others what I have
found, that they with me excited to admiration, may publickly render
thanks to their *Creator*, for his so great Blessings.

But to proceed in my purpose, having once begun, I here describe the
Virtues of *Antimony*, as far as I have experienced them; yet what is
hid from my knowledge, I ought to pass over in silence. For it becomes
me not to give my Judgement of things unknown, and which I have not with
myself experimented, but I leave them, commending the same to other
Judges, who with study and labour in this Subject, have made some good
progress. No one man can be so expert in knowing the Virtues of
*Antimony*, as nothing shall remain unknown by him, not only by reason
of the shortness of his Life (as I before said) but also, and chiefly
because some new thing is dayly found in it.

\[ANTIMONY YET CRUDE IT FATTENS SWINE, HOW\]

Therefore, let men know, that *Antimony* not only purgeth Gold,
cleanseth and frees it from every peregrine Matter, and from all other
Metals, but also (by a power innate in itself) effects the same in Men
and Beasts. If a Farmer purpose in himself to keep up and fatten any of
his Cattle, as for Example an Hog; two or three days before, let him
give to the Swine a convenient Dose of crude *Antimony*, about half a
dram mix’d with his Food, that by it he may be purged; through which
Purgation he will not only acquire an Appetite to his Meat, but the
sooner increase and be fattened. And if any Swine labour with a Disease
about his Liver or other Parts, or else be Leprous, *Antimony* causeth
the Leprosie to be dryed up and expelled.

\[WHY AUTHOR INDUCED RUDE EXAMPLES\]

This Example seems indeed to sound somewhat gross and rustical, to the
Ears of Great men especially; but my purpose in proposing it was only to
the end, that private Men and *Laicks*, whose Brains were not by Nature
fabricated to the most subtle Philosophy of the Learned, may see the
Truth hereof, in the very Operation itself, with their own Eyes; also
that by this rude Proposal, they might give greater credit to my other
Writings, in which I have spoken a little more subtley of these Things.
Yet I would have no man, following me as his Author, to give a Medicine
of Crude *Antimony* to men; for mute Animals can in their Stomach
concoct much more hard Foods, than the tender Complexion of Men is able
to digest. Wherefore, he who would rightly and with profit use
*Antimony*, he must learn the Preparation thereof first, and afterward
know the Dose, as what is convenient for the Young, and what for the
Old; how much may be given to robust Bodies, and how much to the weak,
in which no small Mystery of this Art consists, the ignorance of which
will do more hurt than an imprudent Physician can do good.

\[ANTIMONY DIVERSELY PREPARED HATH DIVERSE EFFECTS\]

Should I confirm all things by Examples, that would be the Cause of a
very Prolix Writing; therefore I will break off this Discourse, and pass
on to another Preparation of *Antimony*, and describe its fixedness;
which acts like Wine, from which its Spirit is substracted and separated
from its Body. \[WINE HEATS, VINEGAR COOLS\] This Spirit heals the Body
internally, and if externally applied, draws to itself all the Heat of a
part inflamed: but, on the contrary, when of the Wine, Vinegar is made,
it cools, either inwardly or outwardly applied; although the Wine and
Vinegar have their Original from the same Root, and proceed from the
same Stock. The Reason of this diversity is, because Vinegar is made
through digestion only, by which Putrefaction of the Wine follows,
together with a Vegetable Fixation: but on the contrary, Spirit of Wine
is made with Separation by distilling, or vegetable subliming, which
renders the Spirit volatile. By like reason *Antimony* is prepared, and
according to its diverse Preparations hath diverse Effects, and
diversely communicates its Gifts to us, which are scarcely
comprehensible by the humane Intellect. But the fixedness thereof,
touching which I here treat, is thus prepared.

\[POWDER OF ANTIMONY, FIXED\]

Take of *Antimony* as much as you will, grind it to a subtle Powder,
which put into a *Cucurbit*, and pour on it of *Aqua Fortis* so much as
will stand above it the breadth of six Fingers; and having well and
firmly closed the Vessel, place it in a subtle heat for ten Days, that
the Matter may be extracted. Decant off this Extraction pure and clear,
and filter it, that it may be freee from all feculencies and Impurities;
then put this Extraction into a Glass-Body, and abstract all the *Aqua
Fortis* by Distillation in Ashes or Sand, and in the bottom the Powder
of *Antimony* will remain yellow and dry. Upon this pour distilled
Rain-water, and put it in a like Glass in moderate heat, and you will
have a Red Extraction. This again filter, and gently distil off the
Rain-water by B.M. and the Powder will remain red in the Bottom. Upon
this red Powder pour strong distilled Vinegar: this Vinegar will in some
time draw to itself the Colour red as Blood, and put down *Feces*.
Afterward distil off the Vinegar, and there will again remain a red
Powder. This Powder reverberate continually for three days together
without ceasing in an open Fire; This being done, abstract the Tincture
from it by Spirit of Wine, and separate the *Feces* remaining from the
Tincture. All these Works being with so great labour performed, again
separate the Spirit of Wine by distillation in *Balneo*, and a fixed
\*Red Powder will remain, which operates wonderfully.

\*

Diaphoretick Antimony is sold in Shops, but what here the Author shews
us, by the name of Fixed Powder of Antimony, is not to be bought for
Silver or Gold; the Virtues of which so far exceed all that, of which
the Common sort are Partakers: In vain with so great attention and study
(of which in preparing this Powder, there is very great need) did our
Philosopher intend this Work, if these Mysteries of so great Effects
must come to the handling of the Vulgar, or be publickly sold for Money.
Let him who attains to this fixed Powder use it in Chronical Diseases,
especially where Sweats are to be excited, and he will see Effects
causing him to rejoice, if he use it in himself; and by which he will be
glorified, if he use it in others.

Half a dram of this being taken thrice a day, *viz*. Morning, Noon, and
Night, or oftner, hurts no man; for it expels all clotted Blood out of
the Body, and being long taken securely opens all perillous Imposthums,
and expels them; radically cures the *French Disease*, causeth new Hairs
to grow, and notably renovates the whole man.

\[FLOWERS OF ANTIMONY\]

Now, since I have taught to make a fixed Powder of *Antimony*, and the
Extraction thereof very commodious for Use, leaving this Discourse, I
purpose briefly to treat of the Flowers of *Antimony*, which may be many
ways prepared. But the greatest part\* of men neither can discourse of,
nor answer to these; because they have not learned the Processes of such
Operations: but the least part, *viz*. the Disciples, Apostles, and
Followers of the *Spagyrick Art*, will more esteem my Writings, more
diligently read them, and more prudently give Judgement of the same.

\*How much Chymistry was impeached by Calumnies, in the times of
Basilius, is manifest by the very many Reliques of Writers, with which
some Theologicians, imprudently judging what they understood not, and
Politicians (not much more prudent than them) have defamed their own
Books; and in the mean while also given occasion to Others, more
throughly searching into the matter, of judging those very Authors, with
not greater circumspection to have likewise bespattered other innocent
Persons with their Censure. I do not here speak of those Writers, who
sharply reprehend certain Vagabond Sophisters, that covering their own
Wickedness, under the Pretext of a most noble Art, do by a great Name
impose great Frauds upon the People. For this kind of men are not only
worthy of severe Reprehension, but also of due Punishment. But, what
Evil do they deserve, if under their Denomination the Good be abused?
Why is the most certain and so salutary and profitable an Art
proscribed? Because there are men found, which use not the Art itself,
but the Name and Shadow of this Art. Yet I am unwilling to prolong this
Apology, lest Envy, which hath been the greatest cause of Calumny, fall
upon me in this manner lamenting, whilst I hear Basilius encouraging
his, and have reason to applaud our own Times, in which some part of
that most thick Cloud, which cast out so many Thunders, is already
vanished. \[CHYMICAL MEDICINES SOLD IN SHOPS\] In Shops they now sell
Medicaments, Chymically prepared (as they say) and those very Persons,
who are willing mostly to be esteemed Hippocratick Disciples, scarcely
dare to condemn Chymistry, and since they call into use what are made by
the Chymical Art, they cannot deny it. Are not those Times at hand, in
which Elias the Artist, the Revealer of greater Mysteries is to come? Of
whose coming Paracelsus so clearly prophesied in carious places in his
Writings? Perhaps it will be worth our while, for the Solace of the
oppressed Disciples of Basilius, to quote certain places, in which he
predicts the coming of Elias not then born: which is any One
commodiously interpret, as all other Sayings of that man are to be
taken, he will find nothing of absurdity in them, unless he resolve to
discover his own absurd Stupidity, or wicked Envy. In the Book of
Minerals, Chap 8. Paracelsus thus writes: what is the most vile, GOD
suffers to be discovered, but whwat is of greater moment is yet hid from
the Vulgar, until the coming of Elias the Artist; others read, until the
Art of Elias, when he comes. And again, in his Book of Minerals,
Treatise the first. It is indeed true (saith he) that many things lie
hid in the Earth, which I, as well as others am ignorant of. For this I
Know, GOD, in time to come will manifest his Wonders, and bring to light
many more of them, then unto this Day have been known by us. Also this
is true; there is nothing absconded, which shall not be revealed;
therefore there cometh One, whose Magnale lives not yet, who shall
reveal many Things.

Therefore be comforted, be comforted, O Lover of Chymistry, and prepare
the way of that Elias, who brings happy times, and will reveal more
Secrets than our Ancestors, by reason of Envy, and the Iniquity of their
Days durst discover. Whosoever thou art, conversing in this Art, confer
some small matter to this felicity; and let us give the World that
Medicine, which by reason of evil Humors predominant, it cannot take all
at once, by degrees, that it may gradually recover of its Disease, and
the Time of Elias come (for Arts also, as well as is understood of other
things, have their Elias, saith Theophrastus) where it will be lawful
for us to speak freely of these things, and openly to do good to our
Neighbours, without persecution of the Impious. Read, understand, and
comfort yourself with these.

But, my Disciple and Follower, if you will imitate me, my advise is,
that you take up your Cross, at first, and suffer as I have suffered;
learn to bear Persecution, as I have already born it, labour, as all our
Predecessors with me have done; with continual Prayers seek unto the
Lord *GOD*, and be thou patient, and laborious without weariness, and
then the *Most High*, who hath mercifully heard me, will not forsake
Thee: for this Cause I every hour give thanks to *GOD*, as my Eyes are
filled with Tears can and do witness.

Now, to proceed in my Instruction, touching the *Flowers* of *Antimony*,
it is to be understood, that the true *Flores* of *Antimony*, may be
prepared, not one, but various ways, as is known to every *Spagyrist*.
There are some who drive them, mix’d with *Sal-Armoniack*, over by
Retort; then they edulcorate them, by washing away the *Sal-Armoniack*,
and these they greatly esteem; for these Flowers are of a fair and white
Colour. Others have perculiar Instruments for this Work, prepared with
windy Caverns, through which the *Antimony* may receive the Air, and be
sublimed. Others, setting three Alembecks one upon another sublime them
with strong Fire, and with one and the same labour make white, yellow,
and Red *Flores;* all which ways I have tried, and found no Error in
them: but the Process, by which I make Flowers of *Antimony*, most
profitable for Medicine, and more efficacious in their Operations is
this.

I mixed the red Flowers of *Antimony* with Colcothar of Vitriol, and
sublimed them together thrice. So, the Essence of Vitriol ascends with
them, and the *Flores* are more strong: which being done, I extract the
same Flowers with Spirit of Wine. The *Feces* settle to the bottom, and
separate themselves from the Spirit. These the Artificer lays asie, and
distils off the Spirit of Wine in *B.M.* until the Powder remains dry.

\[FLOWERS OF ANTIMONY, THEIR VIRTUE\]

These are my prepared Flowers of *Antimony*, which I administered to my
Brethren, and others, who in there Necessities, required help of me, for
their Souls spiritual, in respect of my Ecclesiastical State, and for
their Bodies temporal, by reason of the Trust they reposed in my Art.
These *Flores* purge gently, without frequent, or excessive Stools, and
have cured many *Tertian* and *Quartan Fevers*, also very many other
Diseases; so that I purposed, by the help of our Saviour Jesus, and his
most Holy Mother *Mary*, to ordain in my Testament a perpetual Monument
upon my Altar, of all the Cures which I have performed by his grace;
that I might so doing, not only give thanks to *GOD*, but also make my
Gratitude known to Posterity, that they likewise may acknowledge the
wonderful works of the Most High, which I (by my diligence) have
extracted from the Bowels of Nature, and which he himself had hid and
absconde in her profound and most secret Recesses.

But touching the Sublimations of *Antimony*, which are afterwar called
Flowers; let the Reader further observe, *viz*. that they are like
Waters, which break out in high Mountains. Now, of the difference of
waters, which arise in the highest Mountains, yea in higher than they,
if such can be foun; for even unto them woul the waters ascend; since it
is known, that in the tops of the highest Mountains, Springs do very
often issue it; an of other waters which are foun by digging deep in the
Earth, and by following their Springs must be searched out: \[MATRIX
PERCULIAR TO EVERY ELEMENT\] any man may judge that the *Matrix* of
waters in the Earth, is on one part more abundantly replenishe with the
Riches of waters, then on another; since every Element hath a peculiar
*Matrix*, either strong or weak, according as it is produced by the
*Sydus*, whence Elements derive their Original an have being. Now, when
such a *Matrix* is strong and potent in the Earth, it can drive forth
its Seed strongly and efficaciously from itself, by a vehement Pressure,
even up to the Snowy Mountains of the *Alps*, or to the very top of the
*Babylonish*\* Tower.

\*

This Parable is of very great moment, but so very clear to those, from
whose Eyes the Cataract is taken away, as to explain it to them, would
be to hold a Candle to the Light of the Sun: to others, from whose sight
the Cataract is not took off, this place gives no occasion of detracting
the same. Therefore, read, peruse, and meditate; Day is an Instructor to
the Day; the later Reading explains the former, and the former the
later.

If any fatuate man hear this my Discourse, he will say, I am either mad
or drunk with Wine; but this will be no other than a Reproach, like to
that, which was cast upon the Disciples of our Saviour. Of Sublimation,
the Reason is the same; for as Waters, which are many times found in the
highest Mountains, are more salubrious, and more cool than those, which
by digging deep into the Earth are found in Plains: so, if the Matter by
pressure & force of fire be driven upwards to the Mountains of the
Ancient Wise Men, who died long before my time, the Earth, which for the
most part is unprofitable, remains until its Salt shall be extracted
from it for its proper use. Thus is made Separation, by which the Evil
may be distinguished from the Good, the Pure from the Impure, the thick
from the thin, the subtle from that which is not subtle, and the Venom
from the Medicament. We miserable Mortals, by Death which we have
deserved for our Sins are put into the Earth, until we putrefie by time,
and be reduced to filths; and afterward by the Heavenly Fire and Heat
raised, clarified, and exalted to a Celestial Sublimation, where all our
*Feces*, all Sins, and every Impurity shall be separated, and we made
the Sons of *GOD*, and of Eternal Life, unto which the Lord of his Mercy
and Goodness bring me with you. But I hope no man will take amiss this
Comparation of the Mundane with the Spiritual, *viz*. the Heavenly
Exaltation with the Earthly Sublimation. For no man should suppose what
I have done, to be done without Reason, but rather know, that I am not
ignorant what is white or black, how much the tenebrous and dismal Air
differs from the serene and clear Heaven. Therefore let us break off
this Discourse, and produce another Preparation of *Antimony*.

Let the Disciple, Apostle, and faithful Imitator of Art, understand this
Instruction, and according to the true Philosophick Doctrine faithfully
consider, that every Extraction from *Antimony* (as also from all other
Things) hath great difference in Operation, which neither consists in
the Matter, nor is known by the Matter, from which it is drawn; but
consists and remains in the Preparation, and in the Addition, by which
the Virtue is extracted from the Matter, as is known by Experience; as
for Example. Whatsoever is Extracted from *Antimony*, or any other thing
with Spirit of Wine, hath a far other virtue of Operating, than those,
which are extracted with good and sharp Vinegar. The Causes of this I
have already hinted in my other Writings; but the principal Cause have
is, because all Extractions made with Spirit of Wine, from *Antimony*,
or any purging Herbs, Roots, or Seeds (understand of the first
Extraction) powerfully expel by Seidge: but on the contrary, whatsoever
is extracted with Vinegar, purgeth not downward but rather prevents
that, and retains in a certain peculiar manner, by which the Volatile is
changed into fixed.

This is a singular Secret, and an *Arcanum* of great price; but there
are none, or very few found, who mind such things; because many things
are hidden, and lie deeply buried in this *Arcanum*, which no One,
either Master or Servant, nor any Wise man of this World hath unto this
Day observed or considered.

\[EXTRACT OF ANTIMONY\] Therefore the Extraction of *Antimony* is made
two ways, *viz*. with Vinegar, and with Spirit of Wine. Vinegar
obstructs, and Spirit of Wine, of itself powerfully expels and causeth
Urine, as also Stools; as elsewhere in another manner is shewed, and
especially where I speak of my Twelve Keys, as namely, that the
Extraction of Glass of *Antimony* moderately purgeth; but on the
contrary the Extraction of the same Glass, which is made with Vinegar
purgeth not: which is true and not permixt with any falsity. But this
Experience gives occasion of thinking and reflecting, by which way of
Reasoning, Nature gives promotion and production to a true Philosopher.
But it is a thing much to be admired, that every Subject, which is first
of all extracted with Spirit of Wine, should have a Purging Property.
Yet when Glass of *Antimony* is from the beginning extracted with
distilled Vinegar, and that Vinegar again abstracted, and then the
*Antimony* extracted with Spirit of Wine, all its venomous purging
virtue passeth away, and no sign thereof remains, nor assumes it to
itself any power of provoking Stools; but it performs its Operations by
Sweat, and other ways, chiefly by Salivation and Ejection by the Mouth;
it searcheth out all hurtful Evils in the Body, purgeth the Blood, heals
the Diseases of the Lungs, and profits those who are strait-breasted,
and troubled with a frequent Cough. In a word it Cures very many
Disease, also asswageth a Malignant Cough, and whatsoever is of that
Disposition, and is a Medicine very admirable.

Moreover, thre is another Extraction of *Antimony* made in this manner.
Grind crude *Antimony* to powder, and pour upon it strong Vinegar, not
of Wine, but made of its proper *Minera*, and expose the Mixture in a
Vessel well closed to the *Solar* heat; then, after some time the
Vinegar will be tinged with a Blood-like Colour, pour off this
Extraction clear, filter it, and distil by Alembick in Sant: then again,
in distilling, it shews admirable Colours, pleasant to the Sight, and
wonderful in Aspect. This Oil\* at length becomes Red as Blood and
leaves many *Feces* and prevails against many Infirmities: \[EXTRACT OF
ANTIMONY, ITS VIRTUES AND USE\] for its singular Virtue and Use is
commanded in the Leprosy; the New Disease lately risen amongst the
Soldiers is by it consumed and dried up, and indeed it effects Wonders.

\*

Here thy Sincerity, Valentine, is suspected. Who can by this thy
Prescription make this Quintessence, which Petrus the Spaniard, in his
Book of the Quintessence of all Things, deservedly extols, as the
greatest Secret of Philosophy? What shall I say? Malice makes thee, not
a perverse, but timerous man, fearing, lest if Arcanum’s should be
communicated openly to the wicked, they would do more hurt with them
then good. This Process seems to me to be purposely described obscurely
by this Religious Man (why else should he not have written otherwise!)
because he knew the Sons of Art would understand it by his Prescript.
But that you, Reader, may understand, you have not in vain spent your
Money in buying, or time in reading these Commentaries, I will clearly
and nakedly discover to you, how I myself have oftentimes performed this
very Work: do you give good heed to all Things, that you may not at all
be deficient; for the Operations are so concatenated, or co-linked
together, as one being omitted, or negligently performed, all the other
are spoiled, and your Labour cannot answer your Desires.

Take the best Minera of Antimony, which is friable )for if you take
crude Antimony, as Basilius seems to indicated, you can effect nothing;
because it hath already lost its most subtle Sulphur in the first
Distillation) grind it to so subtle a Powder, as it may pass through a
Tiffany Seive: put it into a Cucurbit, and pour upon it Vinegar, which
according to Art is distilled from its proper Minera. Set it in
Digestion for forty Days, and (if you have exactly observed all things,
which are here unto required) your Vinegar will be tinged with a Colour
red as Blood. This red Tincture poured off by Inclination, put into a
Retort, and gently abstract the Vinegar. The Powder remaining extract
with Spirit of Wine, that it also may contract a blood-like Colour. Put
this Extraction into a Circulatory Vessel, like to this, the Figure of
which I here expose; because I never found any more apt to render the
Spirits volatile: Then place this double vessel in B.M. to be digested
so long, as until you see the Tincture raise itself upwards and pass
over volatile by Alembeck; seeing this, cool your Vessel, and put all
the Matter into a Cucurbit, and distil the Spirit according to Art,
which will pass over the Helm as red as Blood. Then again abstract the
Spirit, and you will have a most ponderous, thick Oil.

How this Oil should after this be joined with its own Salt, and united,
we elsewhere speak; the use of which in amending Metals is very great.
Here we have described it, and brought is so far, as it becomes a most
excellent Medicine in grievous Diseases, which are in all places
accounted uncurable. It performs its whole Operation by Sweats. And
since there is no Disease, which it helps not; what need is there to
name any? It is better to be altogether Silent, then to detract from its
praises, by reciting a few. There is no man who hath made any Progress
in Chymistry, that knows not what the Quintessence of Antimony is.

The *Physician* before all Things, should diligently contemplate its
use, according to his own Experience and Knowledge; but especially
completing its Preparation in a due manner, without being weary of his
labour, or forgetting any of those Things which are prescribed to be
performed.

\[LIVER OF ANTIMONY\]

Again, another Extraction of *Antimony* is thus instituted. Take, in the
Name of the Lord, of *Antimony* and crude *Tartar*, of each equal parts;
put these well mixed together in Powders, into a strong Crucible, which
will not suffer the Spirits to penetrate it, and burn this Matter in the
Fire, until the *Tartar* be wholly combust: this work must be done in a
Wind-furnace. Grind this burnt Matter to a subtle Powder, and pour on
that Common Water first made hot, and so edulcorate the Matter by
Lixiviating. And so it becomes a *Liver*\*, so called by many of our
Ancestors, who lived long before us.

\*

The Liver is a Cause of much Discourse in Banquets, and the Liver of
Antimony will be to us no small Occasion of the like in Chymical
Operations. But in the first place consider, that instead of Crude
Tartar, it is better to take Salt of Tartar, not only for accelerating
the Operation (for otherwise it must be melted so long, as until the
Tartar be changed into Salt) but chiefly, that you may have Glass of a
far better Colour. Also Basilius forgot, or for some Reason did omit, to
appoint the Glass first to be poured into a Platter made hot, and then
beaten to Powder in an hot Mortar: otherwise the Glass, by reason of the
Salt of Tartar, as soon as it takes the cold Air is changed into a
certain Pulse or Pap. Besides, he omitted to determine the Quantity of
Water, in which this Powder should be dissolved, that we may have a more
fair and deep Colour; in which Exaltation of Colour very much is sited.
Also the Precipitation of the Liver from the Water, which must be made
with Vinegar, be involved in Silence; although this, and the above
mentioned, are necessary in this Operation.

Here I am unwilling to forbear to admonish, that not only in this, but
in every Melting of Antimony, the Artist ought to observe the Face of
Heaven, and begin his Work when the same is clear and serene. If you do
otherwise, you will in vain deplore the Obscurity of the Colour in your
Liver of Antimony. For if you laugh at me, attributing much Virtue to
the Influences of the Stars, I shall deride you, deploring the unluckie
Success of many Processes. But I would not digress so far, as to take on
me to prove the Virtues of Celestial Influences, against men, either
knowing so little, as they cannot understand, or having experienced
somewhat do not discern; but in the meanwhile are so obstinate, as they
will not believe those things which they see, have tried, and in very
deed found to be so. I would no more urge Reasons against these men,
then against these, who deny even the Mutation of Metals by the Stone of
Philosophers. We judge such men more worthy of Contempt than Refutation,
who say that is not possible, which they have beheld with their Eyes,
and done with their hands: for it is very rude to say, I deny, I deny,
who proves? These perverse men by their thus acting, do sometimes
provoke the patience of good ingenious Artists, judging that they, with
a certain Zeal of confirming what they assert, will proceed so far, as
to discover to them their Experiment of so excellent an Art. But I do
not think that any of them, who have obtained the Mystery will be so
imprudent, as unadvisedly to cast Pearls before Swine, and to discover
to the unworthy, what GOD hath revealed to him; or give them of the
Bread he Eats, which is not to be cast to Dogs.

Therefore, returning to the Matter from whence I digressed, I affirm,
that there are some times of the year, in which if Liver of Antimony be
made, and precipitated with a due Menstruum, it will be imbibed with
altogether another Colour, and be endued with other Virtues than that,
which is made at another time; and that, both for Metals, and for
healing the Infirmities of men, as I my self have experienced in many
grievous Diseases, and Symptoms of Diseases. I will also add this: from
the Liver of Antimony may be extracted a Redness with Spirit of Wine,
which Redness is made volatile, and passeth over the Helm, which also
may be exhibited to all without danger. Nor is there any great need of
that Caution of Basilius (even before the Redness is volatilized) that
it must be given in a small Quantity. For being given from thirty to
forty, or fifty Drops, it sweats moderately, and doth not Purge or
Vomit: but it effects wonders in purging the Blood, extirpating the
Roots of a Disease, and rendring the Patient vigorous, by insensible
Expiration, and its occult Virtues. This Vendible Wine needs not the
Bush of Eloquence to commend it to the Sick; who once having experienced
its Virtues, know what it can do, and that it as much answers their
Desires, as they esteem their Money.

Put this Liver dried into a *Cucurbit*, pour thereon most pure Spirit of
Wine; abstract the Spirit by distilling in *B.M.* so that a third part
only may remain. But before Distillation, the Spirit of Wine together
with the Extraction must be filtered through Paper. This Extraction may
indeed be profitably used; but in a small Dose, and with great Caution.
What happens in this Operation is very admirable. For the Spirit of Wine
abstracted, can no more be united with the red Extraction, whence it was
distilled; but one floats above the other, as Water and Oyl, which
cannot be mixed. But if the abstracted Spirit of Wine be poured upon
other Liver of *Antimony*, it again attracts the Colour to itself; yet
this, although poured upon the former Extraction, cannot be mixed
therewith. Which is a Thing so strange, as it may be numbered among
Wonders. But who can declare the Wonders of *GOD*? or who will worthily
esteem the Gifts of the Creator, which he hath implanted in his
Creatures? by us scarcely perscrutable with deep Meditation.

I before made mention of the Extraction of *Antimony*, from its Glass\*
by Vinegar, and also by Spirit of Wine: but I now say, when such an
Extraction is made by Vinegar, and the Vinegar is again abstracted by
*B.M.* and the Powder which remains is resolved in a moist place, into
Oyl or Liquor of a Yellow Colour; it effects such Wonders in Wounds, new
and old, as I neither can, nor dare to commit them all to writing.

\*

Here our Author acts as a Teacher careful, and full of Affection, who
not satisfied once to mention, doth often inculcate the principal
Precepts of his Doctrine. But, what it is, that specially moves him to
repeat the Virtues of the Sulphur of Antimony, I see not: he saith, he
repeats nothing in vain; therefore do thou, Reader, if thou judgest it
of Concern, more attently consider, whether you may not here find
somewhat that is not mentioned, or the Reason why it is again spoken of.
I, who profess myself to write to the Intelligent, reiterate nothing
here. He that comprehends, let him comprehend; he that hath not there
understood, I fear will not here understand.

\[LIVER OF ANTIMONY, ITS VIRTUES\]

For it represseth all Symptoms of what kind so ever, suffereth none to
take Root, and admits no Putrefaction in fresh Wounds. Also the
Extraction of this Powder, before Solution is made by Spirit of Wine,
effects the same, and yields not us inferior to other Medicaments, which
are administered against internal Affects.

I have often made mention of this Preparation in other of my Writings,
also in this Treatise of *Antimony*, very largely; because I know how
great benefits and how great Secrets are latent in it. Therefore I hope,
no Disciple will be affected with tediousness, by Reason of Repetitions
in my Writings, which I faithfully open and bring to Light. For
whatsoever I write is not without Reason; and my words are Short, but
require much Consideration, although often repeated. To the Ignorant my
Discourses contribute little understanding, to Children and the
unexperienced little Profit; but to my Disciples and Apostles, much
health and prosperity.

\[EXTRACT OF ANTIMONY, BY A CAUSTICK WATER\]

There remains another Extraction by a Caustick Water, which Experience
hath taught me in this manner.

Take of Vitriol and Common Salt, equal parts; from these by Retort
distil a Water\*, which being forced out by vehement fire, comes forth a
matter like thin Butter, or the Sediment of Oil Olive, which keep apart
for use.

\*

Here I will teach you the Manual Operation, O Lover of Chymistry, which
undoubtedly you will greatly esteem of, when you shall find the great
commodity thereof in operating. Lest, as it often happens, when you
distil the Spirits of Metals, your Vessels should be broken. Of your
Earth Retort A. open the upper hole B. into which put your matter by
Parts, lest all together senting the heat, should act all to forcibly;
and presently Close the Hole with its proper Cover. To the Spirits
received in the Vessel C. exit is given by the hole D. into the other
opposit Receiver E. to which again is applied the other Receiver F. So,
the more subtle Spirits ascending through the Hole D. settle in the
Recipient F. But the more gross remain in the bottom G. of the Reciever
C. This Instrument will be most apt for your use here; not only, as I
said, lest a most strong Spirit passing out break the Glasses, but also
for other Works, as by an easy Speculation you will hence gather.

Subtly grind the Caput-mortuum, and in a Cellar permit it to resolve
into Water, this Water keep and filter it through Paper. Afterward take
*Hungarian Antimony,* grind it to a fine Powder, and having put it in a
*Cucurbit* with a flat bottom, pour this Water thereon, and set the
Vessel in Heat. When it hath stood there for a due time, the Matter will
be like an *Amethyst*, with a blackish Violet-Colour. Then augment the
Fire much, and you will have a transparent Colour, like unto a blue
*Saphire*. From this Colour precipitate a white Powder, by pouring on
Common Water. \[EXTRACT OF ANTIMONY, ITS VIRTUES, AND USE\] This Powder
taken, hath the same Operation, as the red Extraction of Glass of
*Antimony*, by Seidge, and it also excites Vomiting. \[MARS TRANSMUTES
INTO VENUS\] In that Solution made from the *Caput-Mortuum*, and kept in
a Cellar, if thin Plates of Iron be digested, *Mars* will be truly
transmuted into *Venus*, as Experience will teach.

Now further consider. Take that distilled Oil or Water, as is spoken of
above in this process and pour it upon *Crocus* *Martis*, with *Sulphur*
reverberated to a Redness; set the Mixture in Heat, and you will have an
extracted Tincture of *Mars*, red as Blood. Take of this Extraction one
part; of the Red Extraction of *Antimony*, which is prepared with fixed
Salt Nitre and Spirit of Wine, three Parts; of the Water of *Mercury\**
leisurely injected through a long Pipe; one Part;

\*

\[WATER OF MERCURY, HOW MADE\] Chymists, that they may with the
Ingenuities of their Readers; and more, lest any but the true Students
of Art should penetrate into their Secrets, deliver not all Things in
one place, but scatter their Documents, that by the Diligent Collection
of them, they may judge of their Aptness, as the Eagle proves her Young,
exposing them to the Solar Rays: so you see Basilius here proposeth the
use of Water of Mercury, which he taught to be made in his Treatise,
which is called a Supplement, or rather gave a rude Draught of that
Process. For neither there, nor here doth he make mention of an hole,
that must be open, in the superior part of the Retort, and thereinto a
long Pipe fitted through which the Mercury may be put in, in very small
Parcels. For if you include a very small part of Mercury in a Retort,
first made very hot with a vehement Fire, as this must be, if you would
extract the Spirit, that Mercury, with its own vehement and untamable
violence, would not only burst the Retort, but overthrow the Furnace
also; unless you give it a larger space, and greater liberty of Flying;
so that, after it hath visited many Retorts, it may rest, and being as
it were tired, settle. But since it is well known to all true Chymists,
of how great Virtue this Mercury is, in the Resolution of Metals, I will
here make no further mention thereof.

and of the Calx of Gold dissolved in this Caustick Water, half a part.
Mix all these together, and after they are canted off clear, distil the
Mixture with a Moderate Fire in Sand. All will not pass over by
Distillation, but a fair clear Solution remains fixed \* in the Bottom;
which we may use in old open Wounds, wherein it laies a Foundation for
Healing to Amazement.

\*

This Solution is not yet fixed, but if you be not already wearied with
labour, by a further Operation you may fix it. The principal Use of this
is, in the Emendation of Metals, which Basilius doth not so much as
mention. Now the Genius of all Chymists will understand me, here
candidly discovering this Secret to all. Do thou, Lover of Chymistry, in
mind and though swiftly follow me expounding the Oracle; but the
Operation cannot be so swiftly performed.

This Powder must first be Extracted with strong Vinegar, which afterward
abstract, and what remains in the bottom edulcorate with distilled
Water: again Extract it with Spirit of Wine, and abstract the Spirit,
and in the bottom will remain a Red Powder. Join this with the fixed
Salt, which is made of the Feces, which remained after the Vinegar was
used for Extraction. And deliver it to Vulcan for three Months space,
that it may no more fly from the Fire, but most pleasingly sport with
and in the same. If you perform this, you have Two conjoyned in an
inseperable Matrimony: and you have separated the pure from the impure,
have rendered the Volatile fixed, and fixed the Volatile, and are not
far from that Felicity, which will answer all your Desires.

The *Caput-Mortuum* which is left, being resolved in an Humid place,
yields a Liquor so sharp, as no *Aqua Fortis* may be compared with it in
sharpness. But of these enough at this time. For I must now speak of a
White Powder, which may also be prepared of *Antimony* in this manner.

\[POWDER OF ANTIMONY, WHITE AND FIXED\] Take pure *Antimony*, which is
brought from *Hungaria*, or found in like Mountainous Places; grind it
to a subtle Powder: take also the same measure of pure Salnitre, which
hath been the third time diligently cleansed. This Composition burn in a
new glazed Pot (which was never infected with Fatness) in a Circulatory
Fire; not all together, but by parts, and at divers time. This way of
Operating, Ancient *Spagyrist* called *Detonation*, a Term of Art to be
learned by the Disciple of Art, as being not Common to every Rustick, in
his Artifice and Experience.

This Operation being performe,d grind the hard Matter, which remained in
the Pot, to a fine Powder, and upon it in another Glazed Pot pour common
Water warm; which when the Matter is settled again repeat the pouring on
of Water several times, until all the Salnitre be extracted: Lastly, dry
the remaining Matter, and with fresh Salnitre\* as much as its own
weight is, burn it again, and repeat the same Operation the third time.

\*\[POWDER OF RULAND\] Basilius doth not misguide or delude you, O Lover
of Chymistry, whilst he so candidly discovers most Secret Mysteries, and
so sincerely and faithfull present their wonderful Effects. As by this
very Operation you have an Example: For after the first Detonation with
Nitre, and so soon as you shallhave separated the Salnitre from the
Powder with pure Water, you have the Powder of Ruland, with which that
man effected so many Medicinal wonders, whereby he got to himself so
great a Name, and so much Wealth. Which, if you prepare under a certain
Constitution of Heaven (as I advised, in preparing the Liver of
Antimony) you will have so much the better, by how much the more Red:
for the Colour is the Soul thereof, the Effect of which in Medicine,
Ruland proved and commended; but he, neither exhausted its praises, nor
did he persuade the Unexperienced, that so great Virtues were latent in
this Medicament. This Crocus of Metals (for so it is called) is not
that, which is publicly sold in Shops, upon eight Grains of which they
pour two ounces of Wine, and although the Sick only drink that wine,
without any other Powder, it oftentimes works so forcibly, upwards and
downwards, as either way, sometimes both ways, the life itself issues
out. But the use of this is thus. Take eight, nine, ten, or eleven
Grains of this our Authors preparing the first Time, according to the
strength of the Sick, and all other Things co-indicating; pour on them
three or four ounces of Wine; for it matter not much, whether you take
more or less of the Wine. Set the Mixture in B.M. for the space of four
or five hours, and so extract a most Red Tincture from this Crocus of
Metals (which in an infusion of the Crocus of the Shops cannot be
extracted) this Wine, no impregnated with the Sulphur of the Crocus,
together with the more subtle part of the Powder, which in canting off
comes out, I give to the Sick, and it purgeth kindly upwards and
downwards without molestation. Nor doth this Medicament only expel
Humours, but (as is proper to Antimonials rightly prepared) it strikes
at the very Root of the Disease, and whatsoever in the Body is corrupted
and declined from its due state, that it amends and restores. What
wonderful Effects, this only Tincture hath discovered to me, I forbear
to mention, lest I should be compelled to bring their Credit in
Question, who have experienced them. In this only believe me, whosoever
thou art, that woulest use Chymical Medicaments, always be sure to take
the true Tinctures of Things, in which their Volatile Sulphur is
absconded; if you neglect this, you neglect your own Fame and Gain, and
the Health of the Sick.

What remains after this third Operation grind to a subtle Powder, and on
that pour the best Spirit of Wine; circulate the Mixture for one Month,
in a Cucurbit or Circulatory diligently nine or ten times, so often
pouring on fresh Spirit. This being done, dry the Powder with gentle
heat, and for one whole Day keep it red hot in a Crucible, such as
Goldsmiths use to melt their Metals in. Afterward resolve this Powder
(in a moist Place, upon a Stone or Glass Table, or in Eggs boiled to an
hardness) into a Liquor, which set in heat, again dry, and reduce to
Powder. This Powder effects many egregious and wonderful Things, which
cannot easily be believed by Those, who have not proved the same.\*

\*

If you have believed, or experienced the virtues of this Powder once
detonated, you will not be a Thomas in this third Detonation. Set to
your hand, touch and use this, and it will perform the same, which true
Diaphoretick Antimony can, but with greater Security and Efficacy.

But it operates not suddenly, it must have time to exercise its Powers,
and shew its own Virtue, by the Testimony of Experience, very admirable.

\[POWDER OF ANTIMONY, WHITE AND FIXED. ITS VIRTUES\]

Whosoever labours with internal Imposthumes, let him take of this white
fixed Powder of *Antimony* in the Spirit of Wine, or any other rich
Wine, the fourth part of a Dram, five or six times a Day, and he will
find his internal Imposthume opened, and all the Coagulated Blood to be
expelled by degrees, without any peril of Life or Health. He, hwo is
afflicted in his Body with the New Disease of Souldiers, if he use this
Powder in the aforesaid manner, will also find this Evil consumed
throughout the whole Body, and by the same expelled. Moreover, it
produceth new Hairs, and renovates a man to the admiration of all men;
it gives new, sound, and pure Blood, and is the Effecter of so much
Good, as ever the least part of it (although Equity seems to require
this) cannot by me be described or declared. \[NO MAN MADE DOCTOR
WITHOUT LABOUR\] It is not fit that I should here manifest all things
clearly, and in such manner, as any man, without Labour and Toyl, by
reading my Writings, may become a perfect *Doctor*; no more than it is
fit, that a *Young Country Man*\* should be fed with the whitest and
best baked Bread, which he hath not prepared with his own Labour, or the
Corn of which himself thrashed not out.

\*

Valentine hath so clearly detected all Things, as no man, either before
or after him, hath done it more clearly. All that came after him seem to
have conspired, and agreed together to spread Clouds over that Light,
which he brought into the World. Hence it is, that they do not Publicly
extol his Praises, according to the high Esteem every man Privately hath
of him; nor have they translated his Books into other Tongues, although
He, of all Authors, is the most worthy, Who speaks in the Languages of
all Nations, that he may be a comfort to the Lovers of Chymistry, erring
in the Labyrinths of others, and always produce a new Off-spring of
Philosophers. But no man should think, that he could so clearly speak,
as every man, handling Chymistry (according to the saying) with unwashed
Hands, might presently understand him; that is, as himself saith, not
possible to be done, nor is it expedient that the Son of a vile Clown
should eat of the finest Flower, in preparing which he took no Pains;
yet (as below he confesseth) our Author hath used plain, simple and
clear Words.

\[AUTHORS APOLOGY\]

But I make too large a Progress in this open Field of Doctrine, in which
Ancient Hunters take their Larks, and the Young Ones presently follow
them with their Nets. For my Style (as all my Writings witness) hath a
certain singular purposed Method, like that of all Philosophers before
me. If anyone think it strange, that I here propose certain singular
Processes, in which my Philosophy differs from other, let him be
answered with this, that Philosophic Speech much differs from the Method
of other mens Discourses, who nakedly and sincerely declare some
Process, without any Ambiguities or Cloudings of Enigmas. Therefore,
consider the difference, and accuse not me, as if I had deviated from
Order, in my Style of Philosophy, and of Preparations and Processes. For
in a Philosophic Discourse, it is not behooful to learn and judge of
what appertains to the Theory, but the Practice teacheth you the
Instruction of Processes; therefore in them, true, simple, clear and
well grounded Words are to be used.

\[BALSOM OF ANTIMONY\] Also, of *Antimony* is made a *Balsom*, against
grievous Diseases very profitable; yet not Crude *Antimony*, but of the
*Regulus* thereof, whence may be made living *Mercury*, in the following
manner.

Take of the best *Hungarian Antimony*, and crude \*Tartar equal parts,
and of Salnitre half a part; grind them well together, and afterwards
flux them in a Wind-furnace; pour out the flowing Matter into a Cone,
and there let it cool; then you will find the *Regulus*, which thrice or
oftner purge by Fire, with Tartar and Nitre, and it will be bright and
white, shining like Cupellate Silver, which hath fulminated and overcome
all its Lead.

\*

What I advised to in the Preparation of Liver of Antimony is here to be
repeated; instead of Crude Tartar take Salt of Tartar, by which the
Operation will sooner and better proceed. Salnitre here is unprofitable.
Therefore, take Antimony and Salt of Tartar, of each equal parts, melt
them and make a Regulus, according to the Rule here given by Basilius.
If you cast away the Glass (as all men for the most part do) you will do
ill. \[TINCTURE OF ANTIMONY, FROM ITS GLASS, ANOTHER\] For I, of that
prepare a very profitable Medicament in this manner. I grind this Glass
in an hot Mortar, taking heed to contract no Humidity from the Air,
which may easily be prevented, and having put it in a Phial, pour
Alcohol of Wine thereon, and thence extract a most beautiful Tincture,
in Colour red like Blood. This Tincture is a most excellent Cordial, if
thirty, forty, or fifty Drops of it be taken in convenient Liquor, and
that, if you will, twice or thrice a day; for it is taken with safety,
and recreates the whole Man.

Grind this *Regulus* to a subtle Powder, and having put it into a Glass,
pour it on Oil of Juniper, or Spirit of Turpentine, which comes forth in
the first Distillation, and is pure as Fountain Water; keep the Vessel
well closed, in a subtle heat of *B.M.* and the Oil of Juniper, or
Spirit of Turpentine, will become red as Blood, which pour off, and
rectify with Spirit of Wine. \[BALSOM OF ANTIMONY, ITS VIRTUES\] This is
endued with the same Virtues, as Balsom of Sulphur, as I shall then
show, when I write of Sulphur, because they require one and the same
Preparation.

Of this Balsom only three or four Drops, taken thrice in a Week with hot
Wine, heal the Diseases of the Lungs, cure the frequent Cough, and
*Asthma*, also they are conducent in the *Vertigo*, prickings of the
Sides and in diuturnal Coughs.

\[OIL OF ANTIMONY PER SE\] Also many Oils may be prepared of *Antimony*,
some *per se* and without Addition, and many others by Addition. Yet
they are not endued with the same Virtues, but each enjoys its own,
according to the Diversity of its Preparation. Of which I now give you
this Similitude. There are many kinds of Animals, which live only in the
Earth, as are many Creeping Things, Worms and Serpents; also others,
some of which are new kinds, which before were not, and also these
proceed from Putrefaction of the Earth. Some inhabit the Waters, as all
kinds of Fishes; others fly through the Air, as every Kind of Flying
Things, and Birds; some also are nourished in the Fire, as the
Salamander. And besides these, in the more hot Regions and Islands, are
found many other Animals, which to these Nations are unknown, which
prolong their Life by the Solar Heat, and which die so soon as brought
into another Air. So *Antimony*, when prepared by the Addition of Water,
assumes another nature and Complexion for operating, then when prepared
by Fire only. And although every Preparation of it ought to be made by
Fire, without which the Virtue of it cannot be amnifested: yet consider,
that the Addition of Earth gives it wholly another Nature, than the
Addition of Water. So also when *Antimony* is sublimed in Fire through
the Air, and further prepared, another Virtue, other Powers, and another
Operation follow, than in the Preparations already described. Therefore
the Oil of *Antimony*, *per se*, without addition, and the true Sulphur
thereof are prepared after this Method.

\[TRUE SULPHUR OF ANTIMONY\]

Take crude *Hungarian Antimony*, put that ground to a subtle Powder,
into a Glass *Cucurbit* with a flat bottom: pour thereon the true
Vinegar of Philosophers rendred more acid with its own Salt. Then set
the Cucurbit firmly closed in Horse-dung, or *B.M.* to putrefy the
Matter for forty Days, in which time the body resolves itself, and the
Vinegar contracts a Colour red as Blood. Pour off the Vinegar, and pour
on fresh, and do this so often, as until the Vinegar can no more be
tinged. This being done, filter all the Vinegar through Paper, and again
set it, put into a clearn Glass firmly closed in Horse-dung, or *B.M.*
as before, that it may putrefy for forty Days; in which time the Body
again resolves itself, and the Matter in the Glass becomes as black as
*Calcanthum*, or Shoomakers Ink. When you have this Sign, then true
Solution is made, by which the further Separation of Elements is
procured. Put this black matter into another Cucurbit, to which apply an
Alembick, and distil off the Vinegar with Moderate Fire; then the
Vinegar passeth out clear, and in the bottom a sordid matter remains;
grind that to a subtle Powder, and edulcorate it with distilled Rain
Water, then dry it with gentle heat, and put it in a Circulatory with a
long Neck (the Circulatory must have three Cavities or Bellies, as if
three Globes were set one above another, yet distinct or apart each from
other, as Sublimatories, with their Aludel \[or Head\] are wont to be
made, and it must have a long Neck like a Phial, (or Bolthead) and pour
on it Spirit of Wine highly rectified, til it riseth three Fingers above
the Matter, and having well closed the Vessel, set it in a moderate Heat
for two Months. Then follows another new Extraction, and the Spirit of
Wine becomes transparently red as a Ruby, or as was the first Extraction
of the Vinegar, yea more fair. Pour off the Spirit of wine thus tinged,
filter it through Paper, and put it into a Cucurbit (the black Matter
which remains set aside, and separate from this Work; for it is not
profitable therein) to which apply an Head and Receiver, and having
firmly closed all Junctures, begin to distil in Ashes with moderate
Fire: \[GOLDEN COLOUR FROM ANTIMONY\] then the Spirit of wine carries
over the Tincture of *Antimony* with it self, the Elements separate
themselves each from other, and the Alembeck and Recipient seem to
resemble the form of pure Gold transparent in Aspect. In the end some
few Feces remain, and the Golden Colour in the Glass altogether fails.
The red Matter, which in distilling passed over into the Receiver, put
into a Circulatory for ten Days, and as many Nights. By that Circulation
Separation is made; for the Oil thereby acquires Gravity, and separates
itself to the bottom from the Spirit of Wine; and the Spirit of Wine is
again Clear, as it was at first, and swims upon the Oil. Which admirable
Separation is like a Miracle in Nature: Separate this Oil\* from the
Spirit of Wine by a Separatory.

Here you have not only whatsoever can be made of Antimony, but also
almost all that can be promised by a Chymist. This is that with which
all the Books of all Chymists are filled, which is involved in so many
fables, complicated in so many Riddles, and explicate with so many
obscure Commentaries, that is, which in all the World is desired by
Fools, sought by the Sons of Art, and found by the Wise. This Basilius
reveals, this he repeats, this he inculcates; this is his Triumphant
Chariot, which he as it were carries about, and often shows in the
various Parts of his Writings. Before in this Treatise, he presents it
under the Name of an Extraction of Crude Antimony, here it is Oil of
Antimony, soon after it is converted into a Stone, which is called the
Stone of Fire. Thus this Proteus often offers itself, always various,
yet always the same in Substance. Compare all these Processes, which are
so often diversely propounded, which these my Commentaries made upon the
Extraction of Crude Antimony, and you will have the Work complete in all
its Numbers; you will have a Treasure, in which, if you know not what
you have, I remit you to Aesop’s Dunghil-Cock, who found a Gem in the
Dunghil, but knew not what he had. Consider diligently, O Lover of
Chymistry, and you will find that no man hath dealt more clearly and
sincerely with Thee, than Basilius, and me after him, who show thee
there the Hare lies, which so many Others have hunted in vain. If now
you be not here wise, you will not be healed with three Anticrya’s.
Therefore I will add nothing, lest I make Fools mad, who now indeed are
wise.

This Oil is of a singular and incredible Sweetness, with which no other
thing may be compared, it is grateful in the Use, and all Corrosiveness
is separated from it. No man can by Cogitation judge, by Understanding
comprehend, what incredible Effects, potent Powers, and profitable
Virtues are in this Royal Oil. Therefore this this *Sulphur* of
*Antimony*, I have given no other Name, than my Balsom of Life; because
it effects very much, by the Grace of *GOD*, in those, in whom was no
help to be hoped for, but by the mercy of *GOD,* and nothing remained by
a most certain expectation of changing Life with Death; as my Brethren
can witness hath been often done. It refresheth a man so, as if he were
new born; it purifies the Blood; mixt and exhibited with the Tincture of
Corals, it cleanseth Leprosy, and expels every Scab, which through
impurity of the Blood takes Root in man. It drives away Melancholy and
sadness of Heart, it confirms the Junctures, and above all strengthens
the Heart, when given with the Magistery of Pearls. Also it helps the
Memory, and in Swouning a more noble Medicine is not found, if six drops
of it mixt with equal parts of Oil of Cinnamon be put upon the Tongue,
and the Nostrils and Arteries be anointed with a little of the Essence
of Saffron.

Ah Good *GOD*, what moves me to speak, write, and invent many Things!
For I suppose I shall find few among the *Doctors*, who will give
absolute Credit to these my Writings, which I have declared faithfully,
instead of a Testament, to my Disciples, Apostles, and Followers; but
Others, who before knew these wonderful Effects, and have often in Truth
experienced these Virtues, will more accurately attend, and more easily
believe, and for this bounty of mine (*viz*. because I have opened, by
the permission of *GOD*, the Powers and Virtues which are infused in the
Creatures, and have as it were freed them from Prison, brought them to
Light, and unto free Operation) give me thanks, and speak honourably of
me, after I am reduced to Dust in the Grave.

\[ANOTHER TINCTURE OF ANTIMONY\]

Another way to drive *Antimony*, without Addition, over by Alembeck is
this.

Make a *Regulus* of *Antimony*, by *Tartar* and *Salnitre*, as I have
above taught, grind this subtily, put it in a great round Glass, and
place it in a moderate heat of Sand. This way the *Antimony* will be
sublimed: whatsoever shall be sublimed, that dayly put down with a
Feather, that at length it may remain in the Bottom, and there persist
until nothing more of it can be sublimed, but the whole remains fixed in
the Bottom. Then is your *Regulus* fixed, and precipitated *per se*. But
consider, here is required a sufficient time, and repitition of the
Labour often, before you can obtain that. This Red Precipitate take out,
grind it to a subtle Powder, which spred upon a flat and clean Stone,
set in a cold moist Place and there let it remain for six Months; at
length the Precipitate begins to resolve it self into a red and pure
Liquor, and the Feces or Earth is separated from it. \[TRUE SALT OF
ANTIMONY\] The Salt of *Antimony*, I say, only resolves itself into
Liquor, which filter, and put into a *Cucurbit*, that it may be
condensed by extraction of the phlegm; and again set it in moist Place,
then will yield you fair Crystals. Separate these from their Phlegm, and
they will be pellucid, mixt with a red Colour; but when again purified
become white. Then is made the true Salt\* of *Antimony*, as I have
often prepared it.

\*

Like with like, is a Proverb among the Greeks, and is here manifest in
our Chymical Work. For this Salt acuates all Menstruums, for their more
easie extraction of Metals; but those Extractions most, which are made
of Antimony, as of a Mineral to it of affinity and like.

\[SALT OF ANTIMONY, AND ITS USE, WHEN REDUCED TO OIL OR SPIRIT\]

This Salt dry, and mix with it *Venetian* Earth (which is called Tripel)
three Parts, and in strong Fire distil it. First a white Spirit comes
off, afterward a red Spirit, which also resolves itself into white.
Rectify this Spirit gently and subtily in a dry or moist *Balneo*, and
so you will have another white Oil distilled from the Salt of
*Antimony*. This Oil, but why do I call it Oil? this Spirit, I should
rather say, since the Salt is distilled in a Spiritual Manner, in
Quartans and other feavers often manifests its Virtues, and is very
conducent in breaking the Stone of the Bladder; it provokes Urine, and
is profitable in the Gout. Outwardly applied to old corrosive Wounds,
which have their Operation from *Mars*, it purifies them. Also this
Spirit of the Salt of *Antimony* purifies the whole Blood, as the Salt
of Gold doth. And although, in healing very many other Diseases it may
be profitably applied, yet it is not so perfect, as the above described
red Oil of *Antimony*, in which its Sulphur is deduced to the highest,
purified and separated, as I said; therefore I forbear to speak more of
this.

Now, since I have treated of the Sulphur and Salt of *Antimony*, and
shewed how they may be reduced into Oil and Spirit, to be subservient to
Medicine; I here treating further, purpose to speak of its *Mercury*
also, and to manifest what Medicine lies absconded, and as it were
buried in it.

\[MERCURY LIVING EXTRACTED FROM ANTIMONY\]

Take the *Regulus* of *Antimony*, made in such manner, as I above
taught, eight Parts. Salt of Humane Urine clarified and sublimed, one
Part. Sal-Armoniack one Part: and one Part of Salt of Tartar. Mix all
the Salts together in a Glass, and having poured on strong Wine-
Vinegar, lute it with the Luting of Sapience, and digest the Salts with
the Vinegar for an entire Month in convenient Heat; afterward put all
into a Cucurbit, and in Ashes distill off the Vinegar, that the Salts
may remain dry. These dry Salts mix with three Parts of *Venetian*
Earth, and by Retort distil the Mixture with strong Fire, and you will
have a wonderful Spirit. This Spirit pour upon the aforesaid *Regulus*
of *Antimony* reduced to a Powder, and set the whole in putrefaction for
two Months. Then gently distil the Vinegar from it, and with what
remains mix a fourfold weight of the filings of Steel, and with violent
Fire distil by Retort: then the Spirit of Salt, which passeth out,
carries over with itself the *Mercury* of *Antimony* in the Species of
Fume. Wherefore in this Operation you must apply a great Recipient with
a large quantity of Water in it, so doing, the Spirit of Salt will be
mixed with the Water, but the Mercury collected in the Bottom of the
Glass into true living *Mercury*.\*

\*

What were Arcanum’s in the times of Basilius, are now in our times but
vulgar Chymical Works. How often shall we find any One, who numbers
himself among true Chymists, that is ignorant of the way of making
Mercury of Antimony? either in this manner, as Basilius teacheth, or in
another. For various Artificers have now invented various Methods, and
every One useth that, he best approves of.

Behold, O Lover of Art, I have showed you, how of *Antimony* may be made
running *Mercury,* which very many have so long, and in so many Parts of
the World sought; and how we may use this *Mercury* with praise in
Medicine, I will here discover and set down in Writing.

\[MERCURY OF ANTIMONY, ITS MEDICINAL PREPARATION AND USE\] Take in the
Name of the Lord, of this *Mercury* one Part, express it through a Skin,
and pour on it of red Oil of Vitriol highly rectified, four Parts.
Extract the Oyl, and the Spirits of the Oyl will remain with the
*Mercury*: Force it with vehement Fire, and somewhat will be sublimed.
Thus Sublimate again put down upon the Earth in the Bottom. Then pour on
other Oil, of the same weight as before, and repeat this labour a third
time. The fourth time, put the Sublimate which ascends with the Earth,
and grind both together, and the whole will be clear and pure, like a
*Speculum* or Crystal. Put this into a Circulatory, and pour on it a
like weight of Oil of Vitriol, and thrice so much Spirit of Wine.
Circulate until Separation be made, and at length the *Mercury* resolve
itself into Oyl, and float about like Oil Olive. When you see this,
separate this Oil from the other Liquor, and put it into a Circulatory,
and there pour on strong distilled Vinegar, and permit it so to rest
foro about twenty Days. Then this Oil again acquires its own Gravity,
and settles to the Bottom; and whatsoever Veneosity was in it, remains
in the Vinegar, which will be tenebrous and altogether confused.\*

\*

There is no need of Torches at Noon Day, nor or of Commentaries in so
perspicuous a Description, by which Basilius teacheth to make the
Mercury of Antimony. Begin leisurely, give heed to all particulars, and
your Work shall never deceive you. Lest I should darken the Author, I
desist from Commenting; but add, that I doubt not, but that this Mercury
will manifest wonderful Effects in the Humane Body: Yet I have not
experienced its Virtues for the health of Animals, therefore my
Commentaries must not exceed my Experience.

But in the Emendation of Metals, it shows itself to be endued with
singular Virtues. For I say, and clearly affirm, he that can bring this
Oil here described by Basilius, to the state of a fixed Stone, may glory
that he aht a fixed Tincture, only inferior to the one only King of
Kings, the Great Stone of Philosophers. When thou hast proceeded thus
far, O Lover of Chymistry, go not back, nor take off thy hand from the
Plough: but go on chearfully, perhaps in so great a Grove.

The Golden Branch, with Leaves and Twigs of Gold

Will shew itself to Thee.

\[OIL OF THE MERCURY OF ANTIMONY\]

This is a great *Arcanum*, and seems repugnant to Nature, that this Oil
should first swim, and afterward being rendered more ponderous, settle
to the Bottom. But consider, the Oil of Vitriol is also heavy, yet when
the *Mercury* in its Separation is not altogether pure, it stands above
it; but when the impure Lightness is taken from it by Vinegar, because
the Vinegar assumes that, then the Oyl receives its just weight, becomes
compact, and settles to the Bottom. This is the Oyl of the *Mercury* of
*Antimony*, which is the fourth Column of Medicine.

Now come hither you Lepers! where be you? I will supply you with means
for Health. This Oil is profitable against the Apoplexy, comforts the
Brain, makes a man industrious, and cherisheth the vital Spirits of the
Ehad. If anyone hath laboured long with grievous Diseases, and will for
some time dayly use this Oil, his Hairs and Nayls will fall off, and he
will be renovated, as a man newborn. All the Blood in the Humane Body is
by it so purified, as every Evil is taken off from it, and expelled.
This heals the *French Disease*, which we have lately inherited; for by
this Medicine it is radically extirpated. And, to comrpehend much in few
words, the praise of this Oil is greater in Medicine, than can be
expressed in Speech or Writing.

Why do we, miserable Mortals, taken from the Earth, and ready to return
into Earth, stick here? Why do we not hasten to give Thanks to *God* our
*Creator*, for this Medicine so mercifully granted to Us? You *Doctors*
(if it please the Gods) of either Medicine, come to me a religious man
and Servant of *GOD*, I will manifest to you what your Eyes never saw,
and will show you the way of Health and Sanity, which before you never
knew. Yet if any one be found among you, who understands my Processes,
and the way of Preparation, better than I; let him, I pray, not be
silent, or set a Seal to his Lips: for here I stand ready to learn, nor
am I ashamed further to inquire, and desire that Light, which before I
knew not. For I have often said, that this our Life is circumscribed
with more strait Limits, then that one man should be able to search out
all Things, which Nature bears absconded in her Bosom. \[IDLENESS,
CONDEMNED\] But on the contrary, I being the Author, let them be silent,
who have experienced less than the Author, let them be silent, who have
experienced less than I, and if they have not attained to a solid
Understanding of my Writings, let them not attempt to amend them, or
(like Brawlers) with inconsiderate Words reprehend, what they never
learned in the Schools, and the Processes of which they never received
from men skilled in the Law. For my Terms otherwise sound, and signify
other than theirs, who oppose themselves against me, and who are shamed
of the Labour of Planting Trees, and of Grafting fruitful Sprouts
thereon; therefore they always abide among dry and withered Wild Trees,
and can never attain to any Branch of green, sappy, and well manured
Fruit Trees.

\[FISHES DIE NOT OF COLD\]

Hasten not, I say, O man experienced in our Art, to pass your Sentence
of Judging, and be not willing to condemn, what you have not yet
yourself acquired by Thoughts, or gained by Discipline. Many imprudent
men frequently say, Fishes are frozen in Waters; but these discover
their own imprudence and want of Knowledge. for it will never be proved,
that a Fish, even in the bitterest Winter will ever be frozen in Waters,
as long as the Ice of those Waters is dayly broken by the diligence of
Mortals. \[WHY THEY DIE IN FROZEN WATERS\] But the reason why Fishes
die, is because, when the Ice is not opened, their respiration is
hindred, and they thence are suffocated. For it may easily be proved,
that no Animal can live, when to it the Use of air is denied. Whence it
may well be concluded, that those Fishes, which are found dead under the
Water, in an extreme Cold Season, die not of Cold (as men of little
understanding think) but because they are deprived of Air. By like
Reason (that we may apply this Example) I say; since *Antimony*, is to
produce such admirable Fruits, it is to be taken out of the Mountains;
but first, by the Care of the Miners spiracles, or breathing places, are
to made for it, and afterward it must be prepared with Water, Air and
Fire, as with auxiliary Mediums, lest its fruitlessness be suffocated in
the Earth. But with many and laborious Preparations of Artifice, it must
be manifested and brought to Light, for the expected Sanation of
Diseases, by reason of which it hath been so long sought into.

\[ADVICE AFTER REPREHENSION\] Where now, O wretch! who contemnest
*Antimony*, and among all men accusest it as mere Venom, where is thy
Rhetorick, or Dialect, wherewith to defend thyself? But since thou
understandest neither White, nor Black, nor Green, nor Red, nor Yellow;
nor knowest which way to go about to justify *Antimony*, its Virtue,
Power and Utility, being unknown to thee, thou doest well, if thou
keepest Silence, and permittest this Reprehension of thy Ignorance, as a
Wave driven with vehement wind to fly over thy Head; fearing, that if
those Winds and Waves should be predominant, thy own weak and frail Bark
would be sunk and submerged. To avoid this peril, seasonably call upon
thy Sleeping Master, as the Disciples of our *Saviour Jesus Christ* did,
when they feared they should perish. Yet this must not be done with a
dissembled and feigned, but with a true and pure Heart, without all
Hypocrisy; then your Redemption and Help will undoubtedly follow, so
that in all Verity you will see and find the Winds and the Sea to obey
you, and all Things be brought to the desired End.

I wish man were but so disposed, as he would study to obtain somewhat
with labour and Diligence, then certainly the gods, the Presidents of
Prosperity and Art would give Success, by which such a Disciple and
Follower of Art might be assured, that in the wished School of Art, and
desired Domicile of Grace, Felicity and Health hsould not be denied him,
but that he himself should certainly see and find the Foundation of the
Corner Stone, upon which he might commodiously build up all the other
Orders of Stones. tHen would cease the so many evilly founded
Impertinencies of Bablers, which in the Schools stun the Ears of
Disciples, and in Houses the Ears of the Sick; and the Matter itself
would speak, as it were with open Mouth, and by certain Experience
confirm, that a Castle or Palace of Stone cannot so easily be set on
Fire and burnt, as a Pidgeon-House, or the old Nest of a Stork composed
of rotten Wood, and dayly dried more and more by the Sun.

\[CENTER OF ART, NOT KNOWN BY EXTERNAL ASPECT\]

But my Auditor and Disciple, do thou with sharp Judgement weigh this my
sincere Information, and iwth fervent desire strive to penetrate the
inmost Center of Art, which by the external Face can be known to no man;
prosecute and press after the Virtue and Power thereof, no otherwise,
than as a Hunter pursues a Wild Beast; search out its Footsteps through
the Snow, that you may rightly distinguish, and not take an Hart instead
of an Hind, or an Hare instead of a Fox, or give a false estimate
thereof, by erring from its Footsteps. Well, cast out your Nets, and
take a multitude of Fishes, according to your own Wish or Desire. Place
your Threads as is behooful, and dispose of the Birds, which allure
others to their place, and by this way of Fowling you will fulfil your
desire with profit. That by these, to every Searcher I may briefly
propose my Admonition and Advice, I say: My Friend the Hunter, dispose
rightly your Nets and Instruments for Hunting as behoveth; and you
Mariner, who Night and Day sail through the vast Seas, and are often
driven hither and thither by the Winds, give heed to the Point of your
Compass, and undoubtedly you will reap profit, and not bring home your
Ship, swiftly returning, without great Gain of Merchandize.

But why do I treat of many things, or spend time unprofitably (as
tatling Sophisters are wont to do) in beating out the empty Chaff? I am
deceived; \[WORDS OF THE AUTHOR ALL OF USE\] I do not unprofitably spend
my time; for all the Words in my Writings are of use, and in them are
found few empty Letters, which contain not some Utility together with a
profitable Instruction, so that the time I spend in Writing will rather
be a Recreation, than a Burthen to me. Therefore now, after the manner
of Fencers, I will step back one pace, and into the Chymical Laboratory
infer a new Doctrine of External Things; \[ANTIMONY IS A PRESENT HELP
AGAINST WOUNDS\] *viz*. Show, that *Antimony* is of such a Nature, as
may be prepared so, as to yield present help in Medicine pertinent to
External Wounds, which manifoldly offer themselves to us, and are
delcare by Chirurgy. therefore I will begin and briefly explain my
Processes, *viz*. how that is to be used in Medicine, and how it may
profitably be prepared.

Whosoever thou art, among Junior Students, that desirest to search out
the Occult things of Nature, and to bring her hidden Secrets to Light,
attend to what I say, that thou mayest be able to distinguish Day from
Night, and what is clear from the Obscure.

\[ARCANUM OF ANTIMONY\]

Take of *Hungarian Antimony* one part, Common Salt half a part, and six
parts of *Argilla* not burnt, grind all together, and distil vehemently
with a continual Fire without Intermission and at length an Oil will
come forth: from this abstract its Phlegm by Distillation, that a red
dry Powder may remain in the bottom of the *Cucurbit*. This Powder grind
subtily, and resolve it into a Liquor, upon a Marble Stone; and you will
have a red shining Balsom for Wounds, which far excels very many other
Balsoms. \[ITS USE AND VIRTUES\] Its Use\* is principally in Wounds,
which have been a long time open, and in the Cure of which the *Doctors*
with their Plaisters, Unguents, Oils and Ligaments could effect nothing:
but with very great Disgrace they at length take off the Horse’s Bridle
and Saddle, and return him to the Stable, whence they had him.

\*A wise General of an Army so disposeth his Soldiers in time of
Fighting, that in the beginning of the Battle, the good and strong
Soldiers fight, and in the End of the same the best and most strong come
to deal with the Enemy; but such as are not powerful enough, for the
first and last Encounter, in Arms or strength, are by him placed in the
midst, that they may take Example of fighting from the Former, and hope
of help and Victory from the Later. The Emperor is imitated by the
Orator, in placing his Arguments so, as he may overcome the minds of
men. Basilius imitates the Orator, in disposing his Processes so, as he
may lead his Disciples to Sapience, and the Fruit of Wisdom. We have
already had famous Processes, and in explaining them have used our
Endeavour, and contributed some Light. Now follow those, that are in
themselves clear enough, and not of so great moment as the former;
therefore we shall not insist upon them.

\[WHY THE AUTHOR SPEAKS SIMPLY\]

My Form of Speaking Savours of Simplicity; for I am a man Religious, to
whom the Method of Secular Men is unknown; therefore cannot so clearly
detect and describe all Things, as the Matter itself seems to require.
Such a man as I, as to the Terms, because he cannot so formally use
them, desires to be pardoned in this, and if he neglect anything
therein, he craves the candid Acceptation of all men, and in respect of
his State offers himself willing and ready to serve all *Christians* Day
and Night, and by his Prayers to *GOD*, to recompence this their
Benevolence.

\[BALSOM FOR WOUNDS, ITS USE\]

This Oil is salutary in many grievous Accidents, and especially in old
wounds, so that few Medicines are found, which must not give place to
this. Only that Oil, which is prepared with the Vulgar Sublimate of
Apothecaries, is equal unto it in Effects, and is oftentimes by
Experience found to be better, especially in the *Wolf* and *Cancer*,
and in the *Noli me tangere*. But in ordinary Fistula’s, and the
*Herpes* the superior Oyl effects wonders, which were they not confirmed
by Experience, could not be believed, and all which I recite not, lest
someone or other should judge me to do it from Ambition, or that thence
I hunt after Fame, which was never by me either sought or desired; nor
at this time, as I can holily affirm, is it aimed at by me.

\[ANOTHER OIL OF ANTIMONY\]

Now I will give you the Preparation of another Oil.

Take *Mercury* mortified (which is sublimed to clearness and Splendor,
and sold by Apothecaries) and *Antimony*, of each equal parts. Grind
them together, and distil them by such a Retort, as will retain the
Spirits thrice, and afterward rectify this Oil with Spirit of Wine. Then
the Operation is absolved, and the Oil becomes red as Blood; but at
first it is White, and like Ice or congealed Butter. This Oil effects
wonders in many Affects, where Nature gave no hope of Amendment, and it
always mostly shows its force, virtue, power, and efficacy, in the
perfect Emendation of Evil into Good.

By Addition may be prepared another Oil very profitable in external
Wounds.

Take of *Antimony* one part, *Sulphur* one part, *Sal-Armoniack,* or
Salt of Urine purified half a part, and *Calx-vive* two parts. Expel the
Oil strongly: whatsoever is sublimted, that grind with the
*Caput-Mortuum*, and thereon again pour the Oil distilled off, and
thrice distil it; then the Oil is prepared.

When old Wounds can in no wise be healed, then use this Oil. For it is
strong, potent and penetrative: and lays a good Ground (even as Oil of
Vitriol doth) for future Sanation.

\[BALSOM OF ANTIMONY, AND OTHER INGREDIENTS\]

An admirable Balsom of divers Ingredients (among which is *Antimony*)
very useful in old Wounds is thus prepared.

Take of *Sulphur*, four ounces, set it over a moderate Fire to melt, and
put into it half a pound of *Mercury*, and stir the Mixture so long
together, as until both become one Mass. \[CINNABAR, HOW MADE\] This
Mass grind to Powder (for it is made as *Cinnabar* is wont to be
prepared) then grind with it four ounces of *Antimony*, of red
*Arsenick* four ounces, of *Crocus Martis* two ounces and of Powder of
Tiles eight ounces. Put all these into a Glass Cucurbit, and sublime
them, as such things are wont to be sublimed; \[RUBIES OF ANTIMONY\] and
in this Sublimation you will have Rubies in Colour not inferiour to the
Oriental, but tehy are not fixed; for they are volatile, and fly from
the Fire. Let the Artificer separate these Rubies from the Cinnabar,
which ascends in the Sublimation, grind them to Powder and extract them
with strong Vinegar. This being done, let him abstract the Vinegar
leisurely in *B.M.* and a Powder will remain; this Powder grind small as
before, and having put it into another glass, extract its Tincture with
Spirit of Wine, and separate the remaining Feces. This Extraction with
Spirit of Wine digest in *B.M.* well closed for one Month. Then abstract
the Spirit of Wine, as you abstracted the Vinegar, and put the remaining
Powder into a flat Glass Dish, and set that dish in a Cellar into a Pail
full of Water, that it may Swim upon the Water, as a Boat. So doing, the
Powder which is in the Glass will in a few days resolve it self into a
clear nad perlucid Liquor.

This Liquor is salutary in old open Wounds, and is a vulnerary Balsom in
like Accidents, if put into them, and they covered round with a common
Stiptick Plaister. In diuturnal open Wounds, it leaves no man destitute
of help, although such, as in the Cure of which all otehr Remedies have
been tried in vain. Of open Ulcers, which have their Original from
within, I speak not here; for they cannot perfectly be healed without
internal Remedies, \[ROOTS OF DISEASES MINDED BY FEW\] which dry up all
Fluxions, and radically extirpate the Disease: although at this time few
are found, who bend their thoughts this way, or take any Course to touch
the Root itself of those Diseases, of which I now treat.

If Men would in their Minds well consider the Calamities of Life, into
which the Fall of our first Parents precipited us, and seriously weigh
that Original Sin, and the great troop of Evills thence issuing, *viz*:
of Sadness, Anguish, Diseases and Miseries, they certainly would spend
their time better, and employ more labour to search out the health of
their neighbours, so strictly commended to them by the Supreme Ruler of
Heaven, and by him commanded as their proper Duty. \[SUCH AS SHUN LABOUR
DO NOT WHAT THEY OUGHT\] But how many (with grief be it spoken!)
shunning labour, consume their time unprofitably, and do not what was to
be done by them, but what they formerly have done, and still ahve a lust
to do, being afraid to do so much, as will soil their Fingers Ends; as
if they did envy the Tradesman, who perhaps gets a small Gain by selling
Soap, which they would not willingly buy, to wash their delicate hands.
Are not all we miserable Mortals, that live here, Strangers in the
Earth, possessing nothing, that we can call ours? \[GOODS OF GOD LENT,
ONLY FOR TIME OF LIFE\] Are not all Things we here use, the Goods of our
*Lord,* lent to us, whilst we live and no longer? Therefore we ought so
to behave our selves in using them, taht supported with a good
Conscience we may be able to stand in that Day, in which an Account is
to be given for them; and be not for our Ingratitude cast into Prison,
and utter Darkness where shall be weeping and gnashing Teeth. If this
were the Meditation, and this the Intention of every Man, he would be
like a Monster, if he should think of admitting Sin in himself, or of
neglecting his Office; and all Men would, with a certain Emulation
strive to pleasure their Neighbours, with the Gifts received from *GOD.*
But these things are remote from the thoughts of the World, and Wordly
Men; *Money, Money,* is the Scope of all their Intentions; this the
Potent seek directly or indirectly, and for this the Poor are
subservient to them, that they also may participate of the Mamon of
Iniquity.

Yet take heed, I advise you to take heed, lest the Bones of that Flesh,
sticking in your Throat, suffocate you, or the Back-bones of Fishes
pierce your Heart. But what doth Admonition help which the World little
esteemes of and derides? Hear, I pray you an History; or learn a
Parable. \[AUTHORS PILGRIMAGE\] When I, according to my vow, undertook a
Pilgrimage to *St. James*, to visit that holy Place as a Stranger, I
prayed to *GOD*, and bound myself with a Vow, that if he granted me an
happy Return to my Monastery, I would render him due Praise. He granted
my Request, and I daily return Thanks to him. But I thought many more
would have rejoiced with me, and have given thanks to the same *GOD*,
for the famous Reliques, which at that time I brought with me to our
Monastery, (for Consolation of the Poor, and many Others) that it might
procure to it self a Name, in this perishing Valley of Tears, that could
not be wiped out by any Oblivion. Yet hence few were rendered either
better, or more grateful to *GOD*, for so great a benefit; but
persevered in Derision and Contempt of that, which *GOD* will vindicate
in the last Day.

But of these enough at this time, let us proceed in our Instruction of
*Antimony*, whence yet another Medicine may be prepared, which I myself
have experience to be very salutary; and effectual in every kind of
Feavers, and in the Pestilence.

\[ANOTHER OIL OF ANTIMONY PER SE\]

Grind *Antimony* subtily, put it inot a Glass Retort, and distil it with
a strong fire, without any Addition, 3 or 4 times, and always with a
large Receiving Vessel; at length of it is made a Red Powder, which
extract with Vinegar, and circulate the Extraction with a gentle fire
for ten whole Days; abstract the Vinegar by Distilling, and that which
remains, by a singular\* Artifice in distilling will be changed into an
Oil. Let this Oil be further Circulated until all Humidity be drawn off
therefrom, and it again be reduced to Powder, as it was; when the
Vinegar is abstracted and separated by Distillation, then gather the Oil
in a new Receiver.

\*This Extraction may be rendered volatile with Spirit of Wine, after
the same manner, as I taught you in former Operations.

\[QUARTAN, QUOTIDIAN, AND TERTIAN FEVERS CURED\]

Four Grains of this Oil taken with water of *Carduus Benedictus*, if the
Sick be well covered and Sweated, heal *Quotidian, Tertian and Quartan*
Fevers. The same Dose is very available for expelling the Pest, either
given with Spirit of Wine, or with distilled Vinegar, according as the
*Paroxysm* of the Pest first invades, either with Heat, or with Cold.
\[HISTORY OF 3 OF THE AUTHORS BRETHREN CURED OF THE PLAGUE\] Which is
witnessed by three Brethren in our Monastery, who recovered of the
Plague by this Arcanum, when they expected no other but Death, and had
made their Wills. This so reconciled their Minds to this my Art, as they
helped me, with greater Zeal then before, both by their Prayers and
Labour, and spent the leisure time they had exempt from Religious
Duties, in serving me daily; and in a short time attained to so great
Experience, that by their own Industry, and the Industry of their
Brethren, they gained more true Knowledge in searching out the Arcanums
of Nature, then they could before obtain in a longer *series* of time.
Therefore, for these Men, I give them thanks, even unto my very old Age,
and in very deed I return them thanks, because they deserved so well of
me, and of others, by their so faithful Labour; but they finished their
Course of this Life before me, and entred the way of all Flesh,
wherefore I recommend their Reward to the Supreme Physitian, who dwells
in the highest Heavens, and there will refresh them with sufficient Joy,
and make up in Heaven that Just Recompence, which here on Earth was
denyed them by ignorant, and ungrateful Men.

\[ANOTHER OIL OF ANTIMONY PER SE\]

Another Oil of *Antimony* for wounds, is prepared with Addition in the
following manner.

\[OIL OF SULPHUR PER CAMPAN. HOW MADE\] Take of *Antimony*, *Sulphur*,
*Saltnitre*, of each equal parts; Fulminate those under a Bell, as Oil
of *Sulphur* *per Campan*. is made; which way of preparing hath long
since been known to the Ancients. But Consider, you will have a better
way, if instead of a Bell, you take an Alembeck\*, and apply to it a
Recipient; so you will obtain more Oil, which will indeed be of the same
Colour, as that which is made of Common Sulphur, but in powers and
virtues not a little more excellent, then it.

\*

I now, O Lover of Chymistry, Speak to you by Pictures, not in words
onely that by a Compendium of Speech, you may also have this Compendium
of Labour, and Charge. Behold this Instrument, and provide for yourself
such an One, that you may follow Basilius, in making Oil of Sulphur per
Campan. For this way one ounce will yield you as much Oil, as a Pound
will make in the Common Method. From Sixteen ounces of Sulphur you may
extract half an Ounce of Oyl, which others, in their way, do scarcely
expect from Sixteen Pounds.

We use 3 or 4 Drops of this inwardly taken with Spirit of Wine against
the Phthisick of the Lungs; but outwardly, if it first be anointed, and
a Stiptick Playster applyed, against all Wounds stinking, and tending to
putrefaction, and so you will find it to be the most certain Remedy of
all Wounds.

\[ANOTHER OIL OF ANTIMONY PER SE\]

Again another Oil of Antimony against all corroding Wounds very
profitable, is this way made.

Take of *Antimony*, one pound, Common Salt dried, one-half pound, Tiles
broken; five pounds. Grind all together, and put them into a Retort,
whence distil a Yellow Oil. When all the Spirits are come forth, put the
Matter in another glass. and from it extract the Phlegm, and a powder
will remain; which in an humid place spread upon a stone, and you will
have an Humid Balsom, which is a singular Remedy in all Verminant
Wounds, and in the Cancer, which hath being cheifly in the Face of a
Man, and in the Breasts of a Woman. Much more might be written of this
Balsom, did I not fear, that every unskillful Man, and the Rabble of
Sophisters would fall foul on me, and say I speak too largely, and
commit more to writing, then Experience hath taught me; and so that I
boast only of Speculations, and mere Imaginations.

\[ANOTHER OIL OF ANTIMONY PER SE\]

Moreover, another Oil is made in this manner.

Sublime one part of *Antimony*, with a fourth part of Sal Armoniack,
with subtile Fire. The Salt carries up the Sulphur of *Antimony*, red as
Blood. Grind this Sublimate to a fine Powder, and if you took at first
one pound of *Antimony*, grind with it again five ounces of Sal
Armoniack, and Sublime as before. The Sublimate dissolve in a moist
place. Or otherwise, take the Sublimate, and edulcorate it from the Salt
added, gently dry it, and you will have Sulphur, which burns like Common
Sulphur, which is sold at the Apothecaries. From this Sulphur extract
its Tincture with distilled Vinegar, and when you have abstracted the
Vinegar by gentle Heat of B.M. and by a subtile Operation again
distilled the remaining Powder, you will have (if in this Operation you
erre not) a most Excellent\* Oil, grateful, Sweet, and pleasant in its
use, without any Corrosiveness or peril.

\*

This is another Repetition of the Process, by which the Balsom of
Antimony is made, as our Author calls it in this Treatise, or the
Quintessence of Antimony, of which often above. Yet in the process there
is this difference, that here the Sulphur is separated by the Sal
Armoniack from the Antimony, and then extracted from the Vinegar;
whereas in the other Process, the Sulphur is extracted by the Vinegar,
whilst it is yet united with the Antimony. But these are not things of
so great a Moment, as to frustrate the Effect of Operations. Therefore
this Variety gives the greater Liberty to the Operator, that he may not
be Scrupulous is these Things, in which he understands the Reason of
what he doth, and of the Method by which he acts.

It heals the Phthisick, remedies the Prickings of the Sides; and if any
One labours with difficulty of Breathing, let him take two Grains in the
morning, and as many at Night going to Bed. In the Elixir or Spirit of
Wine, and he shall be healed, For it dilates the Passages of the Breast,
expells all Impurities, and Phlegmes out of the Breast; and to me it
hath often produced many unlooked for Effects. But cince in other
Preparations of *Antimony*, I have described such Virtues, as with this
are common to them, I Judge it needless to repeat them all, lest in the
Sectators of Art I should create tediousness through multiciplity of
Words, or alien thoughts by an impertinent Tautology.

In the mean while, the Liquor, which, as I above said, was resolved in
an Humid Place, is an external Medicine, and very profitable; for it
cleanseth the Impurities of the Skin, and if a little Oil of Tartar be
mixed therewith, it heals the Phagedena of the Fingers; and it often
anointed therewith, it purifies the Skin and cures Scrophulaes.

\[TRUE SULPHUR OF ANTIMONY, OTHERWISE PREPARED\]

Also, Sulphur of *Antimony* is prepared in another Manner.

Grind *Antimony* to a fine Powder, which boil for two hours or a little
longer, in a sharp Lixivium made of the ashes of Beechwood. When boiled,
filter the *Antimony* clear, and pour Vinegar upon the filtered Liquor,
and then the Sulphur will settle to the bottom wholly red. Pour off the
Phlegm and gently dry the Powder. Distil this Powder with Vinegar of
Wine; extract the Tincture, and do as you did with the former Sulphur.
To reduce the same into an Oil by Distilling, is worth your while:
Although the Oil above mentioned hath greater Virtues, because its Body,
by the Sal Armoniack, in the beginning of the Sublimation was better
dissolved and opened.

There yet remain many things to be written of *Antimony*, and especially
Three, necessary to be knwon by the *Spagyrick* Physician and
Philosopher, *viz.* the Preparation of Vinegar, which is made of its
Minera; and then the Philosophick Signate Star, which is not to be
omitted; and lastly the Lead of Philosophers, of which we shall speak
somewhat; touching which Many have imagined Great Things, and though (in
their way of Reasoning, and Speculation) to prepare the true and sincere
Mercury of Philosophers of it; which indeed cannot be done, since so
great Efficacy is not from above insited in *Antimony*, as that in it
can exist that Mercury, or of it be prepared. That Mercury is the first
*Ens*, or first Water of Metals, which is perfect, otherwise the Great
Stone of the ancient Wise Men could not be made of it. That first *Ens*,
I say, and the Seeds thereof, are found in another Mineral, in which the
Operation (according to the Genius Metals) is Particular, and most
profitable Operation; and besides in it you may find whatsoever
appertains to internal and external Medicine. For it is the *Column* of
every Shop of Apothecaries, if duely prepared, as I often admonish; nor
is anything wanting in it, provided the Artist hath learned well to
distinguish the Disposition of Metals and Minerals, and diligently
observes both the Preparation and Use of *Antimony*; because then, and
not before, follows a perfect Judgement of it. Therefore I will stand to
my Promise and comfort my Disciples, according to their Wish, by
satisfying and instructing them, which way the Separation of Good from
Evil may be known to them, and giving Information touching the Vinegar
of Philosophers, which is made of

Antimony.

\[VINEGAR OF ANTIMONY\]

Melt the Minera of *Antimony*, and purify it, grind it to a Subtile
Powder, this Matter put into a Round Glass, which is called a Phial,
having a long Neck, pour upon it distilled Water, that the Vessel may be
half full. Then having well closed the Vessel, set it to putrefy in
Horse-dung, until the Mineral begins to wax hot, and cast out a Froath
to the Superficies: then ‘tis time to take it out; for that is a Sign
the Body is opened. This digested Matter put into Cucurbit, which well
close, and extract the Water, which will have an acid Taste. When all
the Water is come off, intend the Fire, and a Sublimate will ascend;
this again grind with the *Feces*, and again pour on the same Water, and
a second time abstract it, then it will be more Sharp. This Operation
must be repeated, until the Water be made as Acid, as any other Sharp
distilled Vinegar of Wine. But the Sublimate, the oftner the Operation
is repeated, the more it is diminished. When you have obtained this Acid
Vinegar, take fresh Minera as before and pour this Vinegar on it, so as
it may stand above it three Fingers; put it into a Pelican, and digest
it two days in Heat, then the Vinegar becomes red, and much more sharp
then before. Cant this clean off, and distil it without Addition in B.M.
The Vinegar comes off white, and the Redness remains in the bottom,
which extract with Spirit of Wine is an excellent Medicine. Again
rectify the Vinegar in *B.M.* that it may be freed from its Phlegm;
lastly dissolve in its proper Salt, *viz*: in four ounces of it, one
ounce of the Salt, and force it strongly by Ashes; then the \*Vinegar
becomes more sharp, and acquires greater Strength, and virtue.

\*

This Vinegar also is numbered among the chief of those things, which are
prepared of Antimony, therefore I thought it worthwhile to illustrate
this with some Commentaries. For although it may be made in the way
Basilius prescribes, yet there are still some things wanting to render
the Work both more easy and more perfect, which I here subjoin; For six
pounds of Antimony are required sixteen pounds of Distilled Water, and
when (after Digestion) we would distil it, a certain manual Operation
must be observed, on which depends the Success of the whole Work almost.
For the Alembeck must be so placed, as his Pipe or Beak may be covered
with Water, which either must be put into the Recipient, or pass out by
distilling into the same; otherwise the Spirit’s of the Antimony will be
lost, and more then half part of the same perish, or the Work require
much more time for its perfection. I have expressed this by a Figure
here placed, that if any by hearing do not sufficiently perceieve this,
they may be seeing understand. When the whole Water hath passed over by
Alembeck, the Fire (as the Author admonisheth) is to be increased, and
three Days, and as many Nights continued without intermission. Then let
all cool, and the Sublimate, as he teaches, must again be mixed with the
Antimony; this Labour for three Days and Nights must be re-assumed, and
afterwards repeated to the third time. \[AUTHOR BALSOM OF LIFE, WHAT.\]
Then your Water will be acid, as common Vinegar. If you tinge this
Vinegar with new Minera of Antimony, you will have a Tincture, which
Basilius names his Balsome of Life, so often described, but never
sufficiently commended. O, did Mortals know what Mysteries lie absconded
in this Tincture, I question whether they would be desirous to set about
any other Preparation of Antimony. All things are in this One. I have
spoken, O Lover of Chymistry, do thou act.

\[VINEGAR OF ANTIMONY, ITS PROPERTY\]

This Vinegar Cools vehemently, not as common Vinegar, but with great
Admiration, and certain Experience, especially for assuaging the
Gangreane, produced from Gunpowder; also it heals other enraged Wounds
and Members, when joined with the Soul of Saturn, wrought up into an
Unguent, and applied outwardly. And mixt with Water of Endive, to which
Salt *prunella* is added, it consumes the Squinancy, and extinguisheth
its great Heat: besides, it assuageth the Motion of the Blood inflamed.
In time of the Pestilence, taken inwardly, the Dose of one Spoonful,
several times, and outwardly applied to the Swellings by Linen Clothes
moistened therein, extracts the Venom, and most excellently cools: but
consider, when you would use it in this manner outwardly, it must be
mixed with a third part of Water distilled from Frogspawn.

Many highly esteem the Signate Star of *Antimony*, and very many have
endeavoured to prepare it, sparing no labour to attain the same. Which
some have acquired with good success, others have lost all their labour
and Cost, Many have assumed an Opinion, that this Star is the true
Matter, whence the Stone of Philosophers may be made, induced hereunto,
by this thought or Imagination, *viz.* because Nature herself hath
signed it into a Star, therefore they could not choose but esteem of it,
and by these Cogitations were led into the Way of Error, But I sincerely
denounce, that it is nothing so. For these kind of Searchers erre from
the Kings high-way, and kill themselves in clambering up Rocks and
Cliffs, in which wild Goats inhabit, and Birds of Prey build their
nests. It is not given to this Star to contain in itself so great
Potency, or from itself to form so precious a Stone. Yet I affirm, that
in it lies *absconded* a famous Medicine, which may be made of it. The
Star is thus made.

\[SIGNATE STAR OF PHILOSOPHERS\]

Take of *Hungarian Antimony* 3. parts. of Steel 1 part. melt these
together with 4. parts of burnt Tartar, when melted pour out the whole
into a cone, when cold take out the Regulus, and separate it from all
impurity, and the Scoria. Grind this Regulus to Powder and weigh it,
then add thereto thrice so much of burnt *Tartar*, and pour it out as
before. Repeat this labour the third time; then the Regulus purgeth
itself, and becomes pure and clear. Note, when you have rightly
completed the Fusion, and have used a manual Operation, as is fit (which
is of principal concern in this Work) you will obtain a fair Star\*
bring and shining like Cupellate Silver, no less artificially formed,
then if some Painter had with Compasses diligently divided the same.

\*

Here it is to be noted. In the third fusion of the Regulus, the Fire
must be vehemently heightened, that if any Impurity remain with the
Regulus, it may by that intense heat be taken away. By this means you
will have a Regulus in beauty and Whiteness comparable to Silver, but in
Virtue and Price far Superior.

This Star with Sal Armoniack is reduced to red \*Sublimate; for the
Tincture of *Mars* ascends. Such a Sublimate may be resolved in a moist
place into a Liquor, which discovers wonderful Virtues in Chirurgy.

\*

This Sublimate, before it is set in a Cellar to be there resolved,
should be purged from the Sal Armoniack with distilled Water. They are
few Things which I admonish, but by the ignorance of these or those,
great Errors are committed, and the Work with all its Costs and Charges
perisheth, or at least yeilds not sufficient to pay what the Materials
cost.

\[ANOTHER OIL OF ANTIMONY MADE OF REGULUS\]

This Regulus, or Signate Star, melted often with the Stone *Serpent*, is
brought to such a state, as at length it consumes itself in it, and
wholy unites itself with the Serpent.\* This being done, the *Sectator*
of Art hath a Matter altogether hot and fiery in which very much of Art
is *latent.* This prepared Matter resolves itself into an Oil; this very
Oil ought to be brought over the Helm by Distillation, and then
rectified, that it may be pure and clear,

\*

Of a Snake or Serpent the Nature is such, if you slacken your hold he
riseth up, if you gripe him hard he bursts, the same I fear here:
Therefore the Author calls that a Serpent, which he mixeth with this
Regulus. But it is the Serpent of a Stone, or a Stony-Serpent; because
the Salt, as a Snake willing licks a Stone.

This Oil may commodiously and securely be taken inwardly; but with great
Prudence and Caution, and not oftner then twice or thrice in a Week, and
no more at one time, then three Drops in two ounces of Wine, or other
Water distilled from Herbs, according to the Exigency of the Disease.
For this Reason, it is the Physicians part to know the Causes of
Diseases, together with the Complexion of the Sick, that he may the more
securely use his Remedies.

\[SOME ARTS WHY SUPPRESSED\]

This is a famous *Acrimony\** containing in itself many *Arcanums*; but
there is no need to reveal all things together and at once to unskillful
men. Some Arts are to be suppressed, that some Secrets and *Arcanums*
may remain proper to the Philosopher, who in searching them out hath
daily sustained grievous Toil.

\*

They, who understand of how great Utility it is to extract the Essences
from Metals, are not ignorant of the Virtues of this sharp Oil. For this
is the only Menstruum for this purpose. How many are they who have spent
their whole Life in Chymical Operations, and never could arrive to the
knowledge of a true Menstruum? To thee it is here revealed, if Health be
your aim, you may safely use it in the Body; if you attempt somewhat
more sublime, and have already conceived good hope you shall compound
it, this is the principal help of all, for ascending to the Throne of
the Chymical Kingdom.

But let him, who resolves to tread in my Footsteps not be weary of
Searching; but what I have done, let him do, and what I have so often
desired, and what with so earnest Wishes I have sought, let him seek.
These Principles, which I have prescribed you, are sufficient for to
search out the End by. Many have failed, yea many have been cut off by
Death, before they could in their Learning attain to the Principles
only; that is, they are deprived of Life, before they could acquire the
Magistery of Art. Therefore, I at first set forth a Book of Rudiments,
that the Studious follower of Art (who in his first Experiences had need
of so much time) might the sooner attain his desired end, and wished
Scope, and next unto *GOD* give me thanks.

\[ANOTHER OIL OF ANTIMONY MADE OF REGULUS, ITS EFFECTS\]

Moreover, in this Oil a wonderful Effect is latent. For if this Oil be
circulated with Crystals for sometime, *viz.* for three Days and Nights
(the Crystals being first Calcined) it from them extracts a Salt: which
being done, the Oil may again be distilled off by Retort. Thus you will
have a Medicine, which admirably breaks the Stone in the Bladder, and
expels it, and there also effects many other Things, by a certain famous
virtue in it.

\[LEAD OF PHILOSOPHERS\]

But that we may also say something of the Lead of Philosophers, let the
curious searchers of Nature know, that between *Antimony* and common
Lead, there is a certain near affinity, and they hold a strict
friendship each with other. As a Tree casts out of its side it’s
superfluous Rosin, which is the Sulphur of that Tree; as the
Cherry-tree, and other Trees, which give forth such Gums: there are
other kinds of Trees also, which by reason of their abundance of
*Mercury*, produce and cast forth from themselves a certain Excrescency,
which neither in Form, nor Virtue is in any wise like to their Fruit;
but hath wholy other properties, as in Oaks and Apple-trees is apparent,
which produce like bastard Fruits, or Monsters: So the Earth also hath
like abortive Fruits, which in Separation from the pure Metals, are
severed and cast out.

Now although there is so strict an affinity between *Antimony*, and
*Saturn*; yet by reason of the too much *Sulphur*, which *Antimony* hath
in itself, it is cast out from it: because its viscous Body (in it’s
Nativity) could not come to perfection; and therefore it was constrained
necessarily to consist among Minerals: because it’s abundance of hot
*Sulphur* was the Cause, that hindred it’s *Mercury*, that through
defect of Cold it could neither come to Coagulation, nor into a
Malleable Body. Morever, I say, the Lead in *Antimony* is no other, then
its Regulus, which hath not as yet obtained Mallaeableness. And, as
above I said, when the Regulus and Steel by Liquefaction are united, and
deduced to a Star, there are many, who would thence make the ancient
stone of Philosophers; which I before denied to be possible. Yet what
Medicines may be prepared of it, you have already briefly heard;
therefore touching them, I shall not add a Word more.

\[WHY THE REGULUS IS CALLED LEAD\]

But the Reason, why the Regulus is called and accounted Lead, is this.
When that Regulus is taken, which *Antimony* gives forth from itself in
making glass, and put into a Crucible well closed, which can resist the
fire, with the Salt of Saturn (having been first Cemented with the Salt
for three hours) and these permitted to melt together, in a Wind
Furnace, the \*Regulus, when taken out, is found to be rendered soft,
and more ponderous, then it was before. For it receives it’s ponderosity
from the Spirit of the Salt, which also gave it softness, so that it’s
Body now is compact and heavy.

\*I not enviously, as many Chymists do, but affectionately deal with
Chirurgeons: wishing that they would in their mind, as according to
their faculty they may and ought, endeavour to prepare such helps, for
their miserably afflicted Patients, and such Compendiums of Sanity, as
may be prepared of this Regulus. Would you have me discover to you the
Mystery? Hear with pleasure, and use it. This Regulus, by the Salt of
Saturn rendered Malleable, must be mixed with equal parts of Mercury
condensed by Saturn, and in a vehement fire fluexed, and so well mixed.
The Matter comes forth, in it’s external Face like unto Silver, but in
its internal Virtues is more noble, and more precious than any Silver.
But you Chyrurgeon, studious of your own Art, and by Art covetous of
Glory, deduce that into thin plates, and externally apply it to Wounds,
and Malignant Fistula’s. So doing, you will be amazed, when you shall
see Nature, helped by this Art, to perform more, in a very short time,
then you could have hoped for in a longer time, by so many Unguents and
Plaisters. The Rusticks (to use the Words of Basilius) will no more
deride and upbraid you, saying, they can effect more with a piece of
crude and stinking Lard, then you are able to do with the laborious
Process of your whole Chirurgick Art.

Therefore I say, there is not much difference between the Stignate Star,
and Lead of *Antimony*; which notwithstanding are every where
distinguished as two diverse things. For either of them is made of the
Glass of *Antimony*, and prepared into one and the same Medicine, as is
already by me sufficiently declared. Here therefore I break off my
Discourse, that I may explain what the stone of fire is, after I shall
have declared the Appendix which follows.

O GOD grant thy Grace, and open the Hearts and Ears of Men unwilling to
hear, and to them impart thy Blessing, that they may acknowledge Thee in
thy Omnipotency, and wonderful Works of Nature, to thy Praise, Honor and
Glory, and for the Health, Solace, and Confirmation of the Strength of
their Neighbour, and also for Restoring the Sick to their Pristine
Health. Amen.

THE

APPENDIX

For a Conclusion you are further to know, that *Antimony* may be applied
to many other Uses, then as above expressed, as to Scripture or
Printing, for which Printers use it. Also under a certain Constellation
and Concourse of the Planets, a Mixture of Metals is made with
*Antimony*, of which Artists form Signatures and Characters endued with
singular Virtues. Of the same Mixture also are made Speculums, of many
and wonderful Aspects and Properties. Also Bells and other Instruments
may be made thereof, of admirable sound. Likewise Images of Men, and
many other Things\*.

\[ANTIMONY ITS WONDERFUL VIRTUES, THE HUNDREDTH PART OF THEM NOT KNOWN\]
\*

The virtues and powers of Antimony which the Author here in this
Appendix so lightly toucheth, and passeth over, are so many and so
various, as indeed the hundredth part of them is not yet known to Men.
Which Ignorance undoubtedly redounds to the Reproach and Ignominy of our
kind; because we Men, among so many other Animals, only endued with
Reason, and a Faculty of Discoursing, are hurryed with so great
impetuousness, to that wicked and abominable Desire of Gain, as scarcely
any Man hath leisure to search out the Wonders, which the Author of
Nature hath insited in his Creatures. But I am unwilling to repeat this
Reprehension so often spoken of by Valentine; I do only call it to mind.
This Mineral, in which lies hid so admirable Spirit, that by Exhausting
it cannot be exhausted, hath also Virtues, which by no man studying can
be sufficiently known. What I have tried, out of the way of Chymistry
and Medicine are few; yet Experience hath taught me so much, as I judge
Antimony in other things will show itself no less admirable, then in
Chymistry and Medicine.

Yet what I think of Characters and Signatures, which the Author saith
may be made under a Concourse of certain Constellations, I shall not
here discover. It sufficeth me, that I can say, that among all Metals
and Minerals, there is not any Substance known, which contains so much
of a Celestial Spirit, and hath so great Sympathy with the Stars, as
Antimony. Weigh this, with all that I have before said of Antimony, but
not negligently, and Hasten to the Stone, which is called the Stone of
Fire.

 

But since these things concern not Medicine, nor appertain to my Order,
Rule, and Calling, I rest well satisfied in my Vocation, and commend
them to the Handling of Others, who know them better.

 

OF THE

TRIUMPHANT CHARIOT

OF

ANTIMONY

AND

What the STONE of FIRE is.

\[AUTHORS PARABLE\]

When, at a certain time an abundance of Thoughts (which my internal and
fervent Prayer to *GOD* suggested) had set me loose and wholy free from
all terrene Businesses, I purposed in my self to attend to Spiritual
Inspirations, of which we have need, for the more accurate scrutiny of
Nature. Therefore I resolved to make myself Wings, that I might ascend
on high, and inspect the stars\* themselves, as *Icarus*, and his Father
*Daedalus* in times past did, if credit may be given to the Ancient
Writings of Poets.

\*

This Leave is to be given to all, who treat of Sacred Things, viz. to
declare those things, which they are willing to discover (not to the
unlearned ignorant Deriders, but only to Men, worthy, and to such as
sincerely desire, and aspire to the knowledge of the same) in a certain
singular and Parabolical kind of Writing. In which our Author is the
more to be excused, because when he comes to the greatest of Mysteries,
which he intended to explain in this Book, he betakes himself to certain
hiding Places of Parables, and with the Heaven of Piety, which is wont
to cover all things (yea even the most wicked) he so veils his Secrets,
as None but Pious and sincere Disciples of Art can with the acuteness of
their sight penetrate these Clouds. Do thou therefore, with a certain
intellectual Luxury sport with him, he will not delude thee.

But when I soared to near the Sun, my Feathers with it’s vehement heat
were consumed, and burnt, I fell headlong into the depth of the Sea: yet
to me, in this my extreme Necessity invoking *GOD*, help was sent from
Heaven, which freed me from all peril and the present Destruction. For
an Angel hastened to my assistance, who commanded the Waters they should
be still, and instantly, in that deep Abyss appeared a most high
Mountain, upon which at length I ascended, \[INFLUENCE OF SUPERIORS ON
INFERIORS\] that I might thereon examine, whether (as Men had affirmed)
there was any Friendship\* and Familiarity between Superiors and
Inferiors, and whether the Superior Stars have acquired power from
*GOD*, their Creator, to produce any one Thing like themselves in the
Earth.

\*

There hath been no Man, who had darted his sight but as it were through
a Lattice, into the Penetrals of Chymistry, who did ever deny this
Influence of Superiors upon Inferiors. Therefore let Basilius so holily
affirming, and so often openly declaring it to Men, be credited by
those, who, the true Light being not yet risen upon them, do by feelign
without sight practice Chymistry.

And having searched into Things, I found, that whatsoever the Ancient
Masters had so many Ages since committed to Writing, and delivered to
their Disciples, who earnestly desired to be the true Imitators of them,
was (as I may say) more true than Truth itself. Wherefore, as is fit, I
give praise and thanks to my *Lord* and Heavenly Father, for his
incomprehensible Works.

\[MINERALS HOW MADE\] In very deed (that I may expound the matter in few
Words) I found all Things, which are generated in the Bowels of
Mountains, to be infused from the Superior Stars, and take their
beginning from them, in the form of an *aqueour* Cloud, Fume or Vapour,
which for a very long time fed and nourished by the Stars, is at length
educted to a tangible form by the Elements. Moreover, this Vapor is
dried, that the Wateriness may lose its Dominion, and the Fire next, by
help of the Air, retain the Ruling Power. Of Water Fire, and of Fire and
Air Earth is produce: which notwithstanding are found in all things
consisting of Body, before the Separation of them. Therefore this,
*viz*. Water is the first Matter\* of all things, which by the Dryness
of Fire and Air is formed into Earth.

\*This is an Old Song, this is the Sum of Art; from this Imitation of
Nature is found the lesser Stone of Fire, from this it is made,
whensoever it is prepared, from the Same also the great Philosophick
Stone derives its Original. \[WATER OF ANAXAGORAS, WHAT\] This is the
water of Anaxagoras, the Fire of Empedocles, and Aristotle’s first
Matter, of which all things have been, and to this Day are made. Which
is clearly evident in the Nutrition of Man, the Growth of a Tree, and in
the Generation of Metals, for that, which constitutes Flesh, Woods, and
Metals, is not taken from Food, Rain or Earth, but is infused into them
from elsewhere. \[ALIMENT, WHICH NOURISHETH ALL THINGS, WHAT\] That very
Thing is the Aliment, which nourisheth all things, but that it may be so
variously specificate, it must be separated from that Body, in which it
dwells, and by joined to another, which by the Chymical Art is
performed.

But now since my Intention is to describe the Stone of Fire, how it is
made of *Antimony*, together with the Process of its Preparation, which
not only heals Men, but Metals also particularly; it will be necessary
before all Things, to speak somewhat of these following Heads. What
properly the Stone of Fire is; what is its Minera; whether a Stone can
be made without Matter or no; what is the extreme difference of Stones,
and how many Species of them are found, and lastly of their use.

\[AUTHORS PRAYER\]

In this my purpose, I pray, O spirit of Heaven illuminate me, that I may
give a true and sincere Instruction, viz. according as is fit for me,
and the matter itself permits. Indeed I have hopes of Eternal Absolution
from this my Supreme confessor, who from Eternity possesseth the Throne
of Mercy, and will give Testimony of all things, when the Decretory
Sentence shall be pronounced upon all Men, in the Last Judgement,
without any appeal.

\[TRUE TINCTURE OF ANTIMONY NOT MADE OF CRUDE AND MELTED ANTIMONY\]

Therefore first know and consider, that the True Tincture of *Antimony*,
which is the Medicine of Men and Metals, is not made of crude and melted
*Antimony*, as it is sold by Merchants and Apothecaries; but extracted
from the Minera, as it is taken out of the Mountains, and before it is
formed into Glass. But how that Extraction should be made, is the
principal Work in which the whole Art consists: Health and Riches attend
him, who rightly attains to that. \[TRUE TINCTURE OF ANTIMONY NAMED THE
STONE OF FIRE\] But, my Reader, you must diligently mind this, *viz*.
that the Tincture of *Antimony* prepared fixed and solid, or the Stone
of Fire (as I name it) is a certain pure, penetrative spiritual and
fiery Essence, which is reduced into a coagulated Matter, like the
Salamander, which in Fire is not consumed, but purified and conserved.

Yet the Stone of Fire tingeth not universally, as the Stone\* of
Philosophers, which is made of the Essence of Gold itself. To this no
such power is given, as that it should perform such things, but it
tingeth particularly; *viz*, Silver into Gold, Tin also and Lead; but
*Mars* and *Venus* it toucheth not, nor do they yield more, then from
them by Separation may be effected.

\[

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STONE OF FIRE AND THE STONE OF PHILOSOPHERS\]
As much as Heaven is elevated above the Earth, so much doth the true
Stone of the Philosophers differ from this Stone of Fire. I myself do
candidly confess, that although I have found this, yet I am very far
distant from the other. And this, whatsoever it is, I own to be received
from the Wisdom of Basilius. Do you take heed you be not deluded by your
own Fantasy, and that others deceive you not.

Moreover, one part of it can tinge no more, then five parts of Metal, so
as to persist in the Trial of *Saturn* and *Antimony*; whereas, on the
contrary, the Great Stone of Philosophers can transmute to infinity.
Also in augmentation it cannot be so far exalted; yet the gold is pure
and solid.

\[EARTH OF ANTIMONY\] The Minera, out of which this Stone or Tincture is
made, is no other then (as I above mentioned) the very Earth of
*Antimony*; from which, I say, it is made: but how or with what virtue,
force, and power it is endued, you shall hear anon.

\[POWDERS FIXED, WHY CALLED STONES\] Let the Reader consider, that there
are many kinds of Stones found, which tinge particularly; but all fixed
Powders, which tinge, I here signify by the name of Stones; yet one
tingeth more highly then another, as especially the Stone of
Philosophers, which obtains the principal place; \[TINCTURES, THEIR
DIFFERENCE\] the next is the Tincture of *Sol*; and of *Luna*. For the
White: after these, the Tincture of *Vitriol* or *Venus*; likewise the
Tincture of *Mars*; either of which hath in it self the Tincture of
*Sol*, when reduced to Fixation. Next to these follow the Tinctures of
*Jupiter* and *Saturn* for Coagulation of *Mercury*; and lastly, the
Tincture of *Mercury* itself. This is the difference and multiplicity of
Stones and Tinctures, all which notwithstanding are generated from Seed,
and from one original *Matrix*, from which the true Universal Stone
proceeds, but out of these no other Metallic Tincture is to be found.
But all other Things, by what name soever called, all Stones (whether
precious or common) I touch not now, nor have I any Intention to write
or speak anything of them at this time; because they contain in
themselves no other Virtues, then what appertain to Medicine. Nor shall
I here make mention of *Animal* or *Vegetable* Stones; because they are
only conducent to Medicine; but for Metallic Works unprofitable and void
of all Virtue. Yet all the Virtues of all Things, *Mineral*, *Animal*,
and *Vegetable*, collected into one, are found in the Stone of the
Philosophers.

\[SALTS, ENDUED WITH NO TINGING VIRTUE\] Salts are endued with no
tinging Virtue, but are only Keys\* for the Preparation of Stones;
otherwise of themselves they effect nothing.

\[SALTS ARE KEYS\] \**Salts, as here is rightly said, are Keys; they
open the Chest wherein the Treasure lies. But you must be sure to take
the true Key; otherwise you may spoil the Lock, and not open the Chest.
It is not safe in this Case to take Quid for Quo, as Apothecaries are
wont. You must have a Philosophic Key, and proper Salts fit for opening
must be taken. Nor condemn this Distinction, which is intimated, between
Salts opening, which the Author here calls (as they are) Kleys, and
Salts fixing, which enter the Treasure itself; as is sufficiently
manifest by the Text.*

\[FIXATION, WHENCE\] Yet, as for Metallic Salts (I now speak to the
purpose if you rightly understand, what distinction I put between
Mineral Salts) they are not to be slightly esteemed, nor to be rejected
in Tinctures, since we can in no wise be without them, in their
Composition, For in them lyes that most precious Treasure, from which
every Fixation derives its Original.

\[A STONE, WHETHER MADE WITHOUT MATTER\] Here some may ask, and indeed
very properly; whether such a Stone can be made without matter? I
answer, No. For every Thing must have its own Matter; but not without
Distinction. *Animals* require their Matter, *Vegetables* theirs, and
*Minerals* theirs. Only consider and before all things observe this;
\[FERMENTATION, NECESSARY, WHY\] *viz*. that no Body can be profitable
for any Stone, without Fermentation, which I find in the end of the Work
(I mean as to the Preparation of the Great Stone) cannot be omitted, if
I would convert Metals with gain; for although in tangible is taken; yet
from that formal Body must be extracted a certain Spiritual and
Celestial Entity (shall I call it) or Apparency; for I find no other
more fit name to give it: which Entity was by the Stars, before infused
into that Body, and by the Elements concocted and made perfect. Yet this
Spiritual Entity must again by a lesser Fire, and by the *Regimen* and
Direction of the Microcosm, be reduced to a tangible, fixed, Solid and
inconsumptible Matter.

But what do I, or what do I speak? I act as if I were deprived of my
Reason\*, in uttering words so openly. For if I had either Reason or
Judgement, I should not discover so great Things with my Tongue, or
command my hand to proceed in writing them.

\*

Art thou well in thy Wits, Basilius, who doest thus prostitute the
Arcanum of the Stone, which hath unto this day been so diligently
absconded by all Philosophers? Surely, if thou hadst not laboured with I
know not what Intemperance of Mind, thou wouldst have closed thy Lips,
and not have so clearly opened, what it is to separate the Pure from the
Impure, what to render the fixed volatile, and again to fix that; how
the Inferior becomes Superior, and that again plunged into the Deep
Abyss, from which it had ascended. To discover so many Mysteries, in so
few Words, as here thou doest, assuredly if it be not Madness, it is a
certain very great benevolence to Posterity. This is that which moved
him. Valentine seems to have burned with this Affection, and could not
overcome that Inclination of Well-doing to many, by the Obligation
(imposed on all Philosophers) of concealing the Secret Mystery of
Nature, which by the Author thereof, that is, by Nature naturating with
Intellectual Revelation, is communicated only to the Sons of Art worthy
and chosen. The Secret of Secrets hath fallen from Basilius, do thou
Reader attend, if you find the Pearl, be not like Aesop’s Cock.

All Tinctures of Metals ought to be separated, as that they may be moved
with a certain principal Love and Affection to Metals, and have a
propensity and desire of uniting themselves with tehm, and of reducing
them to a better State. Will you have an Emblem, or Example? \[EXAMPLE
OF MAN AND WOMAN\] Behold here it is of Man and Woman. If they two be
inflamed with Mutual Love, neither Delay, nor Rest is admitted, until
they be united, and their Desire satisfied: after this Union they rest,
and are multiplyed, according to the good pleasure of *GOD*, and the
promise of his Blessing.

Man lives obnoxious to many and perillous Diseases, some of which
debilitate and consume the powers of Nature so, as the Man can by no
Remedies be perfectly restored to Health and his former Strength \[LOVE,
A DISEASE\] But Love is a disease, with which no other Disease may be
compared, which is not healed unless by Production of its own like,
which either Sex desireth, and that Desire is not satisfied, unless by
fulfilling his will of the enkindled affection. How many Testimonies of
this violence, which is in Love, are daily found? for it not only
inflames the Younger Sort, but it so exagitates some Persons far gone in
years, as through the burning Heat thereof, they are almost mad. Natural
Diseases are for the most part governed by the Complexion of Man, and
therefore invade some more fiercely, others more gently; but Love,
without distinction of poor or rich, young or old, seizeth All, and
having seized so blinds them, as forgetting all Rules of Reason, they
neither see or fear any Snare. Peculiar Members are infected with the
Singular Symptoms of other Diseases, all the other parts remaining sound
and free from that Dolour. Whom Love infects, it invades all over,
penetrates the Body and its whole Substance, Form, and Essence, and
leaving nothing unoffended. For taking place in the Heart there it
kindles a Fire, the burning heat of which is diffused through the Veins,
Arteries, and all the Members of the body, and in a word I say, where
Love once hath fixed its Root, the man is so deprived of all sense,
reason and understanding, as he forgets all things, seriously minds
nothing; he is unmindful of *GOD* and his Law, his promises and threats
he little regards; the torments of Hell and rewards of Eternal Life he
condemns. I speak of inordinate and unlawful Love, to which, if a man be
once addicted, he adheres so pertinaciously, as nothing can reclaim,
nothing can restrain him; he forgets his Duty, Calling and Condition;
derides all admonition, despiseth the Counsels of Parents, Superiors,
and others who wish him well; briefly I say, he is so blind with Love as
he cannot see his own Misery; so deaf, as he cannot hear those, who by
their faithful advice, endeavour to turn and avert from him, the damage
and evil, which would befall him. Love leaves nothing entire, or sound
in the Man; it impedes his Sleep, he cannot rest either Night or Day; it
takes off his Appetite, that he hath no disposition either to Meat or
Drink, by reason of the continual Toerments of his Heart and Mind. It
deprives him of all Privdence; hence he neglects his Affairs, Vocation,
and Business; he minds neither Labour, Study nor Prayer; casts away all
thoughts of any Thing but the Body beloved; this is his study, this his
most vain Occupation. If to Lovers the Success be not answerable to
their Wish, or so soon and prosperously as they desire, how many
Melancholies hence arise, with griefs and sadnesses, with which tehy
pine away and wax so lean, as they have scarcely any flesh cleaving to
the Bones; yea, at length tehy loose the Life itself, as may by many
Examples! \[LOVES SAD EFFECTS\] For such Men (which is an horrible thing
to think of) slight and neglect all perils and detriments, both of the
Body and Life, and of the Soul and Eternal Salvation.

\[AUTHORS CONTINENCY\] But of these enough; for it becomes not a
Religious Man to insist too long upon these Cogitations, or to give
place to such a flame in his heart. Hitherto (without Boasting I speak
it) I have throughout the whole course of my Life kept myself safe and
free from it, and I pray and invoke *GOD* to vouchsafe me his Grace,
that I may keep holy and inviolate the Faith, which I have Sworn, and
live contented with my Spiritual Spouse, the Holy Catholic Church.
\[TINcTURE OF ANTIMONY OUGHT TO HAVE LOVE TO METALS\] For no other
reason have I alleged these, then that I might express the Love, with
which all Tinctures ought to be moved toward Metals, if ever they be
admitted by them into true Friendship, and by Love, which penetrates the
inmost parts, be converted into a better State.

Now let us proceed to the Preparation of the Stone, and leave its use to
the Close of this Discourse. This Stone is of a penetrable and fiery
Nature, is cocted and brought to Maturity by fire, no otherwise, then
all other Things, which are found in this Orb; which notwithstanding as
they are of a diverse Nature, so they in diverse manners obtain that,
according as the Nature of Things supplies with Disverse Fires.

\[DIVERSE FIRES\] The first Fire is *Celestial*, by *GOD* kindled in our
Hearts, by which being inflamed we are moved with Love and a certain
confidence in and of *GOD* our creator, of the Most Holy and
incomprehensible *Trinity*, and of the Mercy, Grave of our Saviour JESUS
CHRIST; which Confidence kindled is Us by Love, never fails, never
deserts us in our Necessities, but will most certainly deliver our Souls
from everlasting destruction. The second Fire is Elemental, produced by
the Sun, and tends to the Ripening of all things in the Macrocosm. The
third Fire is corporal, with which all Foods and Medicines are cocted
and prepared, without which Men can neither obtain Health of Body, nor
sustentation of Life. Of a fourth Fire mention is made in the Sacred
Scriptures, *viz.* that, which before the Supreme Judgement of *GOD*
shall consume this visible World: but what Fire is, and how it shall
operate, that (if we be wise) we must leave to be judged of by his own
Supreme Majesty. A fifth Fire is also spoken of in Holy-Writ, *viz.*
Eternal Fire, in which never to have end, the Divels shall never be set
at liberty from their Infernal Prison, and wicked Men, their Companions,
adjudged to those Eternal Fires, shall be vexed, punished and miserably
tormented forever: from which I pray the Omnipotent and merciful Lord to
preserve us. Here I would admonish all and every Creature endued with
Reason, by their Prayers to beg that Grace and Mercy from the
Omnipotent, that they may so conform their Life to the Divine Precepts,
and their own Duty, as that they may escape this Fire, and its Eternal
Torments.

Our stone of Fire (which is to be noted) must be cocted ripened with
Corporal Fire in the Microcosm, as all other Medicines and foods are
prepared by the same. For where the great Fire of the Macrocosm ceaseth
from it’s Operation, there the Microcosm begins to produce a new
Generation; therefore this Concoction should seem strange to no Man.
\[EXAMPLE OF CORN\] Corn is augmented and ripened by the Elementary Fire
of the Macrocosm; but by the Corporal Fire of the Microcosm a new
Coction and maturation is effected, that man may use and enjoy that
Divine Gift for his sustentation, and by the same perfect the Last and
the Least, which is produced of the first and the Greatest.

The true Oil of *Antimony*, of which the said stone of Fire is made, is
above measure sweet, and from it’s earth is in such wise purged and
separated, as if a Glass full of it be exposed to the Sun, its casts
forth various and wonderful Rays (as if many fiery *Speculums* were
there present) resembling a Ruby and other Colours. Now attent O lover
of Art and Truth, and hear what I shall teach.

\[ITS PREPARATION\] Take in the Name of the Lord, of the *Minera* of
*Antimony*, which grew after the Rising of the Sun, and Salt Nitre, of
each equal Parts; grind them subtily and mix them; burn them together
with a moderate Fire very artificially and warily; for in this the
principal Part of the Work consists. Then you will have a matter
inclining to Blackness. Of this matter make Glass, grind that Glass to a
subtile Powder, and extract from it an high red Tincture with sharp
distilled Vinegar, which is made of it’s proper *Minera*. Abstract the
Vinegar in B.M. and a Powder\* will remain, which again extract with
Spirit of Wine highly rectified, then some feces will be put down, and
you will have a fair, red, sweet Extraction, which is of great Use in
Medicine. This is the pure Sulphur of *Antimony*, which must be
separated as exactly as is possible.

\**Take heed, take heed, O Lover of Chymistry, lest by this Fire, you
burn the Wings of your Bird, which hath now raised itself to the top of
Mountains. Few words are sufficient to the Intelligent, there is no need
to inculcate the same things often, our careful Father Basilius doth
that often enough.*

If of this Extraction you have one pound two ounces take of the Salt of
*Antimony*, as I taught you to prepare it, four ounces and on them pour
the Extraction, and circulate them, for a whole Month at least, in a
Vessel well closed, and the Salt will unite itself with the Extracted
*Sulphur*. If *Feces* be put down, separate them, and again abstract the
Spirit of Wine by B.M. The Powder which remains urge with vehement Fire,
and not without admiration will come forth a varicoloured sweet Oil,
grateful, pellucid and red. Rectify this Oil again in B.M. So that a
fourth part of it may be distilled, and then it is prepared.

This Operation being completed, take living *\*Mercury* of *Antimony*,
which I taught you how you should make, and pour

\*

This word, our Mercury, which hath so often rendred Thee ambiguous, is
also here to be understood: for if you take not the true Mercury of
Philosophers, you do nothing. Whosoever he be, that shall candidly tell
you this, he will be to you Pylades, and you to him Orestes, and nothing
will be more pleasant to me in Life, then to join myself to you, as a
third Sociate in Friendship.

upon it red Oil of Vitriol made upon Iron, and highly rectified. By
Distillation in Sand remove the Phlegm from the *Mercury*; then you will
have a precious Precipitate, in Colour such, as never was any more
grateful to the Sight; and in Chronical Diseases and open Wounds, it may
profitably be used for recovering the *Pristine Sanity*. For it
vehemently dries up all Symptomatical Humors, whence Martial-Diseases
proceed; in which the Spirit of the Oil, which remains with the
*Mercury*, and conjoins and unites itself thereto, powerfully helps.

Take this precipitate, and of the Superior Sweet Oil of *Antimony,*
equal parts, pour these together into a Phial, which well closed set in
convenient heat, and the Precipitate will in time resolve and fix itself
in the Oil. Also the Phlegm by the Fire will be consumed, and what
remains become a Red, dry, fixed and fluid\* Powder which will not in
the least give forth from itself any Fume.

\*

Far hence, far hence ye Prophane, and you that are initiated in the
Sacred Mysteries of Chymistry keep silence. Let the King enter into his
Bed-Chamber, that he may consummate his Marriage.

O tua te quantis attollet Gloria rebus,

Connubio tali!

Yet make not too much hast to enter, or disturb this Matrimonial
Conjunction, let them for many Months delight themselves with their
mutual Embraces, and not go forth, until from their mutual Love they be
changed into an Hermaphroditic Body, and have produced that Son desired
by all, if not a King of Kings, yet at least a Regulus or Ruler, which
delivers his Subjects from Diseases and Necessity.

Now my Follower, and Disciple of Arcanums, I will speak after a
Prophetic manner. When you have brought your Philosophic Studies (in the
Method by me prescribed) to this end, you have the Medicine of Men and
Metals; which is grateful and Sweet in use, without all peril, it is
penetrative, yet causeth not Stools, it induceth Emendation, and expells
Evil. Use it as is fit, and it will yield you many Commodities, both for
health and temporal necessity; by which means you will be freed from
want in this World; which is a thing of so great Moment, as no Sacrifice
of Gratitude can be found sufficient to answer this favour of *GOD*
showed to you.

Here, O my *GOD*, I as a Religious Man am troubled in Mind; and know not
whether I do well or ill, whether in \* speaking I have exceeded or not
reached the due Bounds; whilst I propose, and show to everyone, as it
were, his proper House. Do thou, that art a young Follower of Art,
inquire, search and try, as I have done; if you attain your End, give
greatest thanks to *GOD*, and after him to me your Master. But if you
turn aside into devious and by-paths, blame yourself, not me; for I am
not guilty of your Error.

\*

Our Author judgeth himself to have spoken too much, if you also think
the same, you will rejoice in his Sadness. Yet it is strange, that no
Man can contribute a little Light to this Philosophy, but he presently
repents.

Now I have said enough, and writ enough, and taught so clearly and
openly, and plainly, as more manifestly or clearly cannot be done by
Writing, unless some lost and rash Man, knowing and willingly would cast
himself into Hell, to be there Submerged and Perish: Because, by the
Creator of all Things we are most severely prohibited further to unlock
these Mysteries, or to eat of the Tree which was planted in the midst of
Paradise. Therefore here I will desist, until Others show, what is here
to be done by Me, and what they judge is to be omitted, and say no more
of this, but pass to its Use.

\[ITS USE, DOSE, ETC\]

Therefore know, that the Use consists in Observation of the Person and
his Complexion, with relation to what appertains to Humane Health, that
Nature be not overpowered with too great a Quantity, or not helped by
too small. Yet too much is not so Religiously to be feared; for it will
not readily hurt; because it helps to recover the pristine Sanity, and
fights against Venom, if any be in the Body. This I only add, three or
four grains of it, given in one only Dose, are sufficient for expelling
every Evil, if taken in Spirit of Wine. For this Stone or Tincture
passeth through all the Members of the body, and contains in itself the
Virtues of many *Arcanums*. It remedies the Giddiness of the Head, and
all Diseases, which have their Original from the Lungs. It cures
difficulty of Breathing, and the Cough; the Leprosy and *French Disease*
are amended by it, in a wonderful manner. The Pest, Jaundices, Dropsies
and all kinds of Fevers, are often cured by it, Likewise it expels Venom
taken. It profits those, who have drunk a *Philtrum* or Love-potion: it
confirms all the Members, Brain, Head, and all things depending thereon.
It helps the Stomach and Liver; heals all Diseases, which proceed from
the Reins; cleanseth the impurity of the Blood. Also this Tincture of
*Antimony*, breaks the Stone of the Bladder to Powder; and expells it;
it provokes Urine, when stopped by *Flatus’s.* It restores the vital
Spirits, cures Suffocation of the Matrix, makes the Menstrues flow if
stopped and stays them if inordinate. It causeth Fruitfulness, and makes
the Seed sound, and available for Generation, both in Women and in Men.
Lastly, this Stone of Fire inwardly taken (convenient Plaisters being
also outwardly applied) heals the Cancer, Fistula’s, Rotteness in the
Bones, and all corroding Ulcers, and whatsoever takes beginning from the
Impurity of the Blood, also the Disease itself called *Noli me tangere*.
And that I may comprehend all in few Words, this Stone, like a
Particular Tincture, is a \* Remedy against all Symptoms, which can
happen to the Humane Body. All which Experience will very clearly
demonstrate to you, and open the way further to you, if you be a
Physician, called by *GOD* to that Office.

\*

Here the Medicinal Virtues are spoken of at large. For Basilius
supposeth Thee not to be defiled with the Filths of Avarice, but
splendid in the Light of Charity, and burning with a Desire of helping
thy Neighbour, following him discovering thse Secrets. Now farewell, O
Lover of Chymistry, and if thou, hast gained any Light, either from the
Interpretation of Basilius, or my Commentaries, enjoy it, and
communicate the same to the Sons of Art, that Philosophy oppressed for
so many Years with the intollerable Yoak of Avarice, may at length be
revived, and a return be of those times of Egyptians, in which
Trismegistus and so many wise Magi, Philosophized not with empty
denominations, but with wonderful Works.

In these, I think I have done my part, and writ more then sufficiently
of *Antimony*. If any One follows me, he may add his own Experiences to
these, that (with the singular favour of *GOD*) before the consummation
of the World, the Mysteries of the most High may be revealed, to his
Glory and honour, and the Conservation of health. Having finished this
Discourse, I intend for a time to be silent and return to my Monastery,
there to learn Philosophy further, that I may be able to comment of
other Thigns and as I have already promised, I shall (*GOD* willing)
write of Vitriol, common Sulphur, and the Loadstone, and open their
Principle, Powers, Operations, and Virtues.

Let GOD the Lord of Heaven and Earth grant to us temporal Health here,
and hereafter Eternal Salvation for the Refreshment of our Souls, in the
Seas of Joy and Gladness, never to be limited within any Bounds of time.
Amen.

Thus I conclude this Treatise of *Antimony*, and all whatsoever I have
written of the Red Oil of *Antimony*, which is made of its Sulphur
highly purified, and of the Spirit, which is prepared of its Salt.
Incline your Mind to those, and with them compare these last, which I
have prescribed you touching the Stone of Fire. If you acutely consider
them, you may easily find their Union unto the End, by this Comparation.
For the Foundation is the same, the Reason the same, the Friendship the
same, by which Health is required, and the Stag long sought taken with a
pleasant Hunting.

 

FINIS.
