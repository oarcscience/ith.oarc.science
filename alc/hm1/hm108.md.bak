### A SHORT TRACT,

###### OR

##### PHILOSOPHICAL SUMMARY

## By NICHOLAS FLAMELL.

HE that would understand the whole subject of metals, and how they are
transmuted one into another, ought first to find an answer to the
question, from what substance they spring, and how they are formed in
their ores. For this purpose he must observe the changes that are
continually going forward in the mineral veins of the earth. Hence they
may be made subject to transmutation outside of their ores if they are
first made spiritual, so that they may be reduced to their sulphur and
mercury, which is performed by Nature. Now all metals have been formed
out of sulphur and quicksilver, which are the seeds of all metals, the
one representing the male, and the other the female principle. These two
varieties of seed are, of course, composed of elementary substances; the
sulphur, or male seed, being nothing but fire and

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

air (*i.e.*; *good* sulphur, resembling fire, free from the mutable
properties of metals, and not that common sulphur which is not a
metallic substance at all); while the quicksilver, or female seed, is
nothing but earth and water. These two seeds were figuratively
represented by the ancient Sages under the forms of two dragons, or
serpents, one of which had wings, while the other had none. The wingless
dragon is sulphur, because it never flies away from the fire. The winged
serpent is quicksilver, which is borne away through the air (the female
seed, which is composed of water and earth)—because in a certain degree
it flies away or evaporates. Now, if these two seeds, separated one from
another, are united spermatically by triumphant Nature, in the book of
Mercury, the first mother of metals, the Sages call the substance that
results, the flying dragon, because this dragon, being kindled with its
fire, in its flight pours abroad into the air fire and a poisonous
vapour. The same happens to mercury, which, if placed in a vessel over
an ordinary fire, has its internal, hidden fire kindled; and then you
may see how the outward vegetable fire kindles the inward natural fire
of mercury. You will notice that it exhales into the air a certain
poisonous fume or vapour, the stench of which is such as to prove that
it is nothing but the head of the dragon which is leaving Babylon in
great haste, even the philosophical Babylon which is encompassed by a
double or treble vessel.

Other Sages have likened this Mercury to a flying Lion, because the Lion
devours other animals, and refreshes and strengthens himself at will
with the blood of all animals except those which have power to resist
his rage—and because mercury, too, is known to deprive other metals of
their specific form, and to absorb and incorporate them. Gold and
silver, however, are strong enough to resist its violence; although it
is well-known that mercury, when exposed to an exceptional degree of
heat, devours and swallows even these two metals. Yet neither of them is
changed into the nature of the mercury, howbeit, they are enclosed in
its womb; for gold and silver are more permanent and more perfect than
crude mercury, this being an imperfect metal, notwithstanding that there
is in it the substance of perfection. Common gold, which is a perfect
metal, and silver, and all the imperfect metals, are developed out of

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

mercury. For this reason, the ancient Sages have called it the Mother of
the Metals, and hence, being itself a metal, it must contain a two-fold
metallic substance, namely, the inner substance of the Moon, and that of
the Sun (which is unlike the other). Of these two substances mercury is
formed, and they are cherished in its body in the form of spiritual
essences. Now, as soon as Nature has formed that mercury of these two
spirits, she strives to transmute them into a perfect bodily form; and
therefore, when those two spirits have grown up, and their two varieties
of seed awake, they desire to assume their own proper bodies; and then
the Mother, mercury, must die, and having died a natural death, can
never be quickened any more into that which it was previously.

Vainglorious and arrogant Alchemists have obscurely hinted that perfect
and imperfect bodies must be transmuted into fluid mercury, but this
assertion is only a trap for the unwary. It is true that mercury
consumes imperfect metals, like lead and tin, and thus increases in
quantity; but, by doing so, it loses its perfection, and is no longer
the mercury that it was before. If, indeed, it could be so mortified by
a chemical process as to shut out all hope of its ever quickening itself
again, it would be changed into something else, as happens with
cinnabar, or in sublimate. But, when it is coagulated by a chemical
process, whether by a swift or a slow method, its two bodies do not
assume a permanent form. By the natural process this coagulation is
indeed successfully carried out; and thus we never find a vein of lead,
for instance, which does not contain a few permanent grains, at least,
of gold and silver. The first coagulation of mercury is lead, which is
most suitable for fixing it, and bringing it to perfection. For lead is
never without some fixed grain of gold and silver, which are imparted to
it by Nature for the purpose of multiplication and development, as I
myself have experienced, and am able to testify. So long as it is in its
mercury, and not separated from its mineral, it can continue to increase
its substance from the substance of its mercury. But if this fixed grain
is taken away, and severed from its mercury (or the mineral in which it
is found), it can no longer gain in size. It is with this grain as with
the green fruit that is formed on a tree when the blossom has been shed.
If it is

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

plucked off before it is ripe, it can come to nothing. If it is left on
the tree, it is nourished and increased by the sap and the juice of the
parent stem, and thus gradually attains to its proper size, and to
maturity. But, until ripeness has been attained, the fruit continues to
attract to itself the sap and juice of the tree, that is to say, so long
as the connection with the parent tree is not severed.

Almost the same thing happens with gold. Such a grain attracts to itself
the mercury of the lead, and incessantly "fixes" it into its own
mercury, whereby it grows and gradually increases in size. The mercury
of perfect or imperfect metals is the parent tree, and the grain (of
gold) can be nourished with nothing but this mercury. But as soon as you
sever the connection with the parent mercury, that growth of the grain
must immediately come to an end; it is as though the unripe fruit had
been plucked from the tree: you would vainly endeavour to restore the
vital connexion. When you have once removed an unripe pear or apple from
its native branch, it would be foolish indeed to join it to the tree
once more, and expect it to ripen. Instead of growing, it will gradually
shrivel up, and become smaller. The same thing may be observed in the
case of the metals. For if any one were to take common metallic gold and
silver, and tried to resolve those metals into mercury, he would be
doing a very foolish thing. It is a result which cannot be brought about
by any chemical process, however subtle and ingenious, just as fruit
which has once been plucked in an unripe state can never again be
vitally joined to the parent tree. It has, indeed, been well said by the
Sages that if gold and silver be joined together through their proper
mercury, they have power to render all other (imperfect) metals perfect.
But these Sages did not speak of common gold and silver, which must
always remain what they are, can never become anything else, and
certainly cannot aid the development of other metals. It is fruit that
has been plucked before the time, and therefore is dead and withered.
No, the *living* fruit (the real living gold and silver) we must seek
*on the tree*; for only there can it grow, and increase in size,
according to the possibilities of its nature. This tree we must
transplant, without gathering its fruit, into a better and richer soil,
and to a sunnier spot. Then its fruit will receive more nourishment in

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

a single day than it was wont to receive in a hundred years, while it
was still in its former sterile soil.

I wish you to understand that Mercury, which is a most excellent tree,
and contains silver and gold in an indissoluble form, must be taken and
transplanted into a soil that is nearer to the Sun (*i.e.*, in this
case, gold), where it may flourish exceedingly, and be abundantly
watered. Where it was planted before, it was so shaken and weakened by
the wind and the frost, that but little fruit could be expected from it.
So there it remained a long time, and bore no fruit.

But in the garden of the Sages, the *Sun* sheds its genial influence
both morning and evening, day and night, unceasingly. There our *tree*
is watered with the rarest dew, and the fruit which hangs upon the trees
swells and ripens and expands, from day to day. It never withers, but
makes more progress in one year than it did in a thousand years in its
former sterile situation. Or, to drop metaphor, let the mercury be
taken, and warmed day and night in an alembic over a gentle fire. Yet it
should not be a coal or a wood fire, but a clear and pellucid heat, like
that of the *Sun* itself—a gentle and even warmth. Growing fruit must
not be exposed to too much heat, or else it is withered, and shrivelled
up, and is never brought to perfection. It must have a genial warmth,
and be supported by a moderate moisture in the tree, if it is to
flourish and expand. For heat and moisture are the food of all earthly
things, both animal, vegetable, and mineral. Ordinary coal or wood fires
are too violent for our purpose, and give no nourishment like the heat
of the Sun which preserves all bodies through its natural influences.
For this reason the Sages use none but this natural fire, not because it
is made by the Sages, but because it is made by Nature—Nature, that
creates all things, whether they be animal, vegetable, or mineral, and
warms them, each at its own proper degree.

Therefore, I will not say that man by his art can make natural things;
but I do say that human art can impart greater perfection to that which
Nature makes. For this purpose the ancient Sages have had but one object
in view, namely, to produce from the moon and the true mother

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

mercury, the mercury of the philosophers, which in its operation is much
more potent than natural mercury, and is useful for working upon simple,
perfect, imperfect, cold, and warm metals. Now, the Philosophical Stone
is good for perfect and imperfect metals, and soon restores and brings
them to perfection without any diminution, addition, or real change of
any kind. For, apart from perfecting them, it leaves them in the state
in which they were before. I do not say that the Sages combine common
gold, silver, and mercury for this purpose: this is the method only of
ignorant charlatans, who thereby hope to prepare the mercury of the
Sages; but they never succeed in producing this, the real first
substance of the Stone. If they would obtain it they must go to the
seventh mountain, where there is no plain, and from its height they must
look down upon the sixth, which they will behold at a great distance. On
the summit of that mountain they will find the glorious Regal Herb,
which some Sages call a mineral, some a vegetable. The bones they must
leave, and only extract its pure juice, which will enable them to do the
better part of the work. This is the true and subtle mercury of the
philosophers which you must take. Now, first it prepares the white
tincture, and then the red. For the Sun and Moon are prepared by the
same method, and yield the red and white tincture, respectively, and the
preparation is so simple that it might be seen to by a woman while she
works at her spindle—just as she might set a hen on some eggs, without
washing them first, and without any other trouble but that of turning
the eggs every day that the chickens may break the shells all the
sooner. In like manner, you must not wash your mercury, but only put it
with its like (which is fire) into ashes (corresponding to the straw),
into one glass vessel (which is the nest), in a suitable alembic (which
is the house). If you do this there will come out a chicken, that will
deliver you with its blood from all diseases, and feed you with its
flesh, and clothe you with its feathers, and shelter you from the cold.
Therefore, I pray and beseech the Creator of all things to grant His
grace to all faithful Alchemists, that they may find the chicken, which,
through God's unspeakable goodness and mercy, has now been vouchsafed to
me. I have written this

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

tract for your sakes, to encourage you, and point out to you the right
way: I hope and trust that my words will enable you to understand more
fully the works of other Sages. Farewell!
