PHILOSOPHY I have read, and thoroughly understood,  
The utmost depth of my teachers’ knowledge have I sounded.  
This God graciously granted to me,  
Giving me a heart to understand wisdom.  
Thus I became the Author of this Book,  
And I have clearly set forth the whole matter,  
That Rich and Poor might understand.  
There is nothing like it upon earth;  
Nor (God be praised) have I therein forgotten my humble self.  
I am acquainted with the only true foundation:  
Therefore preserve this Book with care,  
And take heed that you study it again and again.  
Thus shall you receive and learn the truth,  
And use this great gift of God for good ends.  
O God the Father, which art of all the beginning and end,  
We beseech thee for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ  
To enlighten our minds and thoughts,  
That we may praise Thee without ceasing,  
And accomplish this Book according to Thy will!  
Direct Thou everything to a good end,  
And preserve us through Thy great mercy.—  
With the help of God I will shew you this Art,  
And will not hide or veil the truth from you.  
After that you understand me aright,  
You will soon be free from the bonds of error.  
For there is only *one* substance,  
In which all the rest is hidden;  
Therefore, keep a good heart.  
Coction, time, and patience are what you need;  
If you would enjoy the precious reward,  
You must cheerfully give both time and labour.  
For you must subject to gentle coction the seeds and the metals,

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

Day by day, during several weeks;  
Thus in this one vile thing  
You will discover and bring to perfection the whole work of
Philosophy,  
Which to most men appears impossible,  
Though it is a convenient and easy task.  
If we were to shew it to the outer world  
We should be derided by men, women, and children.  
Therefore be modest and secret,  
And you will be left in peace and security.  
Remember your duty towards your neighbour and your God,  
Who gives this Art, and would have it concealed.  
Now we will conclude the Preface,  
That we may begin to describe the very Art,  
And truly and plainly set it forth in figures,  
Rendering thanks to the Creator of every creature.  
Hereunto follows the First Figure,

<p>The Sages will tell you<br />
That two fishes are in our sea<br />
Without any flesh or bones.<br />
Let them be cooked in their own water;<br />
Then they also will become a vast sea,<br />
The vastness of which no man can describe.<br />
Moreover, the Sages say<br />
That the two fishes are only one, not two;<br />
They are two, and nevertheless they are one,<br />
Body, Spirit, and Soul.<br />
Now, I tell you most truly,<br />
Cook these three together,<br />
That there may be a very large sea.<br />
Cook the sulphur well with the sulphur,<br />
And hold your tongue about it:<br />
Conceal your knowledge to your own advantage,<br />
And you shall be free from poverty.<br />
Only let your discovery remain a close secret.</p></td>

<p>The Sage says<br />
That a wild beast is in the forest,<br />
Whose skin is of blackest dye.<br />
If any man cut off his head,<br />
His blackness will disappear,<br />
And give place to a snowy white.<br />
Understand well the meaning of this head:<br />
The blackness is called the head of the Raven;<br />
As soon as it disappears,<br />
A white colour is straightway manifested;<br />
It is given this name, despoiled of its head.<br />
When the Beast's black hue has vanished in a black smoke,<br />
The Sages rejoice<br />
From the bottom of their hearts;<br />
But they keep it a close secret,<br />
That no foolish man may know it.<br />
Yet unto their Sons, in kindness of heart,<br />
They partly reveal it in their writings;<br />
And therefore let those who receive the gift<br />
Enjoy it also in silence,<br />
Since God would have it concealed.</p></td>

<p>The Sages say truly<br />
That two animals are in this forest:<br />
One glorious, beautiful, and swift,<br />
A great and strong deer;<br />
The other an unicorn.<br />
They are concealed in the forest,<br />
But happy shall that man be called<br />
Who shall snare and capture them.<br />
The Masters shew you here clearly<br />
That in all places<br />
These two animals wander about in forests<br />
(But know that the forest is but one).<br />
If we apply the parable to our Art,<br />
We shall call the forest the Body.<br />
That will be rightly and truly said.<br />
The unicorn will be the Spirit at all times.<br />
The deer desires no other name<br />
But that of the Soul; which name no man shall take away from it.<br />
He that knows how to tame and master them by Art,<br />
To couple them together,<br />
And to lead them in and out of the forest,<br />
May justly be called a Master.<br />
For we rightly judge<br />
That he has attained the golden flesh,<br />
And may triumph everywhere;<br />
Nay, he may bear rule over great Augustus.</p></td>

And of terrible and savage aspect.<br />

That no living creature can stand before him,<br />
Nor is even the Basilisk equal to him.<br />
He who hath skill to slay him, wisely<br />
Hath escaped from all dangers.<br />
Yet all venom, and colours, are multiplied<br />
In the hour of his death.<br />
His venom becomes the great Medicine.<br />
He quickly consumes his venom,<br />
For he devours his poisonous tail.<br />

From which flows forth glorious Balm,<br />
With all its miraculous virtues.<br />
Hereat all the Sages do loudly rejoice.</p></td>

That the Salamander is born in the fire;<br />
In the fire it has that food and life<br />
Which Nature herself has assigned to it.<br />
It dwells in a great mountain<br />
Which is encompassed by many flames,<br />

So that it dies, and yields up its life with its blood.<br />
But this, too, happens for its good:<br />
For from its blood it wins immortal life,<br />
And then death has no more power over it.<br />
Its blood is the most precious Medicine upon earth,<br />
The same has not its like in the world.<br />
For this blood drives away all disease<br />
In the bodies of metals,<br />
Of men, and of beasts.<br />
From it the Sages derive their science,<br />
And through it they attain the Heavenly Gift,<br />
Which is called the Philosopher's Stone,<br />
Possessing the power of the whole world.<br />
This gift the Sages impart to us with loving hearts,<br />
That we may remember them for ever.</p></td>

<p>The sleeping Father is here changed<br />
Entirely into limpid water,<br />
And by virtue of this water alone<br />
The good work is accomplished.<br />
There is now a glorified and beautiful Father,<br />
And he brings forth a new Son.<br />
The Son ever remains in the Father,<br />
And the Father in the Son.<br />
Thus in divers things<br />
They produce untold, precious fruit.<br />
They perish never more,<br />
And laugh at death.<br />
By the grace of God they abide for ever,<br />
The Father and the Son, triumphing gloriously<br />
In the splendour of their new Kingdom.<br />
Upon one throne they sit,<br />
And the face of the Ancient Master<br />
Is straightway seen between them:<br />
He is arrayed in a crimson robe.</p></td>
