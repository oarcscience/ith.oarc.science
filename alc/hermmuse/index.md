This is the main index for Arthur Edward Waite's Hermetic Museum. This
is one of the largest collections of Alchemical tracts, first published
in Latin in 1678. Waite translated it into English and issued it in two
volumes in 1893. It appears in its entirety here on the Internet for the
first time. Full bibliographic information can be found via either one
of the volume index pages, ([here](../hm1/index.md), and
[here](../hm2/index).md).
