### CHAPTER I.

*The Introduction*.

BECAUSE many have written of the Philosopher's Stone without any
knowledge of the art, and the few books extant, written by our learned
predecessors and true masters hereupon, are either lost or concealed in
the collections of such (however despised) as are lovers and seekers of
natural secrets, we have taken a resolution to communicate our knowledge
in this matter, to the intent that those who are convinced the
Philosophical Work is no fiction, but grounded in the possibility of
Nature, may be faithfully directed in their studies, and have an
undoubted criterion to distinguish between such authors as are genuine
sons of science and those who are spurious, as writing by hearsay only.

We shall not on this occasion give a summary of their names who are
undoubted

masters in the art, but shall take occasion to introduce them, as it may
be necessary, in the following chapters; and as their sense is often
concealed under a studied ambiguity of expression, we shall, out of the
gift which the Almighty hath dispensed to us, declare plainly, and
without any reserve, the first matter of the Philosopher's Stone, the
manner of proceeding through the whole process, both in the Vegetable
and Metallic Tinctures, beginning with the Vegetable process first, as
the most easy and simple, yet well worthy the attention of all ingenious
persons, particularly the practical chemists and preparers of medicines.
