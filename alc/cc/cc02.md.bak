*The Hermetic Tracts comprised in this volume are printed from a quarto
manuscript (itself a transcript from an older but now untraceable work)
belonging to the celebrated collection of the late Mr. Frederick
Hockley, who was well known among modern students of the secret
sciences, not only for the resources of his Hermetic library, but for
his practical acquaintance with many branches of esoteric lore, and for
his real or reputed connection with the numerous but unavowed
associations which now, as at anterior periods, are supposed to dispense
initiation into occult knowledge. While practically the reprint is*
verbatim*, it would have been a needless source of confusion, in a
subject which is already sufficiently confused, to have reproduced *

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

*the obsolete orthography, the superfluous capitals, the perplexing
parentheses, the unnecessary italics, and the chaotic punctuation of the
original. These, therefore, have been abandoned in favour of a simpler
method. But the flavour of antiquity is sometimes valued for its age
rather than its excellence; and partly in deference to this prejudice,
there has been no attempt to reconstruct the style of these old
writings. Moreover, though somewhat barbarous and entangled, it does not
present sufficient difficulties to justify a drastic purgation*.
