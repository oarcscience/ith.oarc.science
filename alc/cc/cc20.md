### CHAPTER XII.

*Of the Stone and its Uses*.

HAVING thus completed the operation, let the vessel cool, and on opening
it you will perceive your matter to be fixed into a ponderous mass,
thoroughly of a scarlet colour, which is easily reducible to powder by
scraping, or otherwise, and in being heated in the fire flows like wax,
without smoking, flaming, or loss of substance, returning when cold to
its former fixity, heavier than gold, bulk for bulk, yet easy to be
dissolved in any liquid, in which a few grains being taken its operation
most wonderfully pervades the human body, to the extirpation of all
disorders, prolonging life by its use to its utmost period; and hence it
has obtained the apellation of "*Panacea*," or a Universal Remedy.
Therefore, be thankful to the Most High for the possession of such an
inestimable jewel, and account the possession of it not as the result of
your own ingenuity, but a

gift bestowed, of God's mere bounty, for the relief of human
infirmities, in which your neighbour ought to share jointly with you,
without any grudging or sinister views, according to the charge
delivered to the Apostles, "Freely have you received, freely
communicate," remembering at the same time not to cast your pearls
before swine; in a word, to withhold the manifestations of Nature you
are enabled to exhibit, by the possession of our Stone, from the vicious
and unworthy.
