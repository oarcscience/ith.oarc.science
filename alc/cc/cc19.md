### CHAPTER XI.

*A Further Description of the Process*.

WHEN the putrefaction of our seed has been thus completed, the fire may
be increased till glorious colours appear, which the Sons of Art have
called *Cauda Pavonis*, or the *Peacock's Tail*. These colours come and
go, as heat is administered approaching to the third degree, till all is
of a beautiful green, and as it ripens assumes a perfect whiteness,
which is the White Tincture, transmuting the inferior metals into
silver, and very powerful as a medicine. But as the artist well knows it
is capable of a higher concoction; he goes on increasing his fire till
it assumes a yellow, then an orange or citron colour; and then boldly
gives a heat of the fourth degree, till it acquires a redness like blood
taken from a sound person, which is a manifest sign of its thorough
concoction and fitness for the uses intended.
