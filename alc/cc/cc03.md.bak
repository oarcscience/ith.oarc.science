### THE SECRET OF THE LIQUOR ALKAHEST.

1\. Question.—What is the Alkahest?

Answer.—It is a Catholic and Universal *Menstruum*, and, in a word, may
be called (*Ignis-Aqua*) a Fiery Water, an uncompounded and immortal
*ens*, which is penetrative, resolving all things into their first
Liquid Matter, nor can anything resist its power, for it acteth without
any reaction from the patient, nor doth it suffer from anything but its
equal, by which it is brought into subjection; but after it hath
dissolved all other things, it remaineth entire in its former nature,
and is of the same virtue after a thousand operations as at the first.

2\. Q.—Of what substance is it?

A.—It is a noble circulated salt, prepared with wonderful art till it
answers the

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

desires of an ingenious artist; yet it is not any corporal salt made
liquid by a bare solution, but is a saline spirit which heat cannot
coagulate by evaporation of the moisture, but is of a spiritual uniform
substance, volatile with a gentle heat, leaving nothing behind it; yet
is not this spirit either acid or alkali, but salt.

3\. Q.—Which is its equal?

A.—If you know the one, you may without difficulty know the other; seek
therefore, for the Gods have made Arts the reward of industry.

4\. Q.—What is the next matter of the Alkahest?

A.—I have told you that it is a salt; the fire surrounded the salt and
the water swallowed up the fire, yet overcame it not; so is made the
philosopher's fire, of which they speak; the vulgar burn with fire, we
with water.

5\. Q.—Which is the most noble salt?

A.—If you desire to learn this, descend into yourself, for you carry it
about with

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

you, as well the salt as its Vulcan, if you are able to discern it.

6\. Q.—Which is it, tell me, I pray you?

A.—Man's blood out of the body, or man's urine, for the urine is an
excrement separated, for the greatest part, from the blood. Each of
these give both a volatile and fixed salt; if you know how to collect
and prepare it, you will have a most precious Balsam of Life.

7\. Q.—Is the property of human urine more noble than the urine of any
beast?

A.—By many degrees, for though it be an excrement only, yet its salt
hath not its like in the whole universal nature.

8\. Q.—Which be its parts?

A.—A volatile and more fixed; yet according to the variety of ordering
it, these may be variously altered.

9\. Q.—Are there any things in urine which are different from its inmost
specific urinaceous nature?

A.—There are, viz., a watery phlegm, and sea salt which we take in with
our

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

meat; it remains entire and undigested in the urine, and by separation
may be divided from it, which (if there be no sufficient use of it in
the meat after a convenient time) ceaseth.

10\. Q.—Whence is that phlegm, or insipid watery humidity?

A.—It is chiefly from our several drinks, and yet everything hath its
own phlegm.

11\. Q.—Explain yourself more clearly.

A.—You must know that the urine, partly by the separative virtue, is
conveyed with what we drink to the bladder, and partly consists of a
watery Teffas (an excrementitious humour of the blood), whence being
separated by the odour of the urinaceous ferment, it penetrates most
deeply, the saltness being unchanged, unless that the saltness of the
blood and urine be both the same; so that whatsoever is contained in the
urine besides salt is unprofitable phlegm.

12\. Q.—How doth it appear that there is a plentiful phlegm in urine?

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

A.—Thus suppose; first, from the taste; secondly, from the weight;
thirdly, from the virtue of it.

13\. Q.—Be your own interpreter.

A.—The salt of urine contains all that is properly essential to the
urine, the smell whereof is very sharp; the taste differs according as
it is differently ordered, so that sometimes it is also salt with an
urinaceous saltness.

14\. Q.—What have you observed concerning the weight thereof?

A.—I have observed thus much, that three ounces, or a little more, of
urine, taken from a healthy man, will moderately outweigh about eighty
grains of fountain water, from which also I have seen a liquor distilled
which was of equal weight to the said water, whence it is evident that
most of the salt was left behind.

15\. Q.—What have you observed of its virtue?

A.—The congelation of urine by cold is an argument that phlegm is in it;
for the

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

salt of urine is not so congealed if a little moistened with a liquid,
though it be water.

16\. Q.—But this same phlegm though most accurately separated by
distillation, retains the nature of urine, as may be perceived both by
the smell and taste.

A.—I confess it, though little can be discerned by taste, nor can you
perceive more, either by smell or taste, than you may from salt of urine
dissolved in pure water.

17\. Q.—What doth pyrotechny teach you concerning urine?

A.—It teacheth this, to make the salt of urine volatile.

18\. Q.—What is then left?

A.—An earthly, blackish, stinking dreg.

19\. Q.—Is the spirit wholly uniform?

A.—So it appeareth to the sight, smell, and taste; and yet it containeth
qualities directly contrary to each other.

20\. Q.—Which be they?

A.—By one, through its innate virtue,

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

the Dulech is coagulated; by the other, it is dissolved.

21\. Q.—What further?

A.—In the coagulation of urine, its spirit of wine is discovered.

22\. Q.—Is there such a spirit in urine?

A.—There is indeed, truly residing in every urine, even of the most
healthful man, most of which may be prepared by Art.

23\. Q.—Of what efficacy is this spirit?

A.—Of such as is to be lamented, and indeed may move our pity to
mankind.

24\. Q.—Why so?

A.—From hence the Dulech, its most fierce enemy, hath its original.

25\. Q.—Will you give an example of this thing?

A.—I will. Take urine, and dissolve in it a convenient quantity of
saltpetre. Let it stand a month; afterwards distil it, and there will
come over a spirit which burns upon the tongue like a coal of fire. Pour
this spirit on again, and cohobate it four

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

or five times, abstracting every time not above half; so the spirit
becometh most piercing, yet not in the least sharp; the heat which goeth
out in the first distillation of the liquor, afterwards grows sensibly
mild, and at length almost (if not altogether) vanisheth, and the second
spirit may be perceived mild, both by the smell and taste, which in the
former was most sharp.

26\. Q.—What have you observed concerning the former spirit?

A.—If it be a little shaked, oily streaks appear sliding here and there,
just as spirit of wine distils down the head of the alembic in streaks
like veins.

27\. Q.—What kind of putrefaction should the urine undergo that such a
spirit may be got from it?

A.—In a heat scarce to be perceived by sense, in a vessel lightly
closed, or covered rather; it may also be sometimes hotter, sometimes
cooler, so that neither the heat nor cold exceed a due mean.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

28\. Q.—How may this winy spirit become most perspicuous?

A.—By such a putrefaction as causeth a ferment, and exciteth ebullition,
which will not happen in a long time if the urine be kept in a wooden
vessel, and in a place which is not hot, but yet keeps out the cold, as,
suppose, behind a furnace in winter, where let it be kept till of itself
a ferment arise in the urine and stirs up bubbles, for then you may draw
from it a burning water which is somewhat winy.

29\. Q.—Is there any other spirit of urine?

A.—There is; for urine, putrefied with a gentle heat, during the space
of a fortnight or thereabouts, sends forth a coagulating spirit, which
will coagulate well rectified *Aqua Vitæ*.

30\. Q.—How is that spirit to be prepared which forms the Dulech of
itself with a clear watery stalagma; and also that which dissolves the
same?

A.—Urine putrefied for a month and a-half

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

in a heat most like the heat of horse-dung will give you, in a fit
vessel, each stillatitious stalagma according to your desire.

31\. Q.—Doth every spirit coagulate the spirit of wine?

A.—By no means; this second spirit is observed to want that virtue.

32\. Q.—What doth urine, thus ordered, contain besides the aforesaid
spirits?

A.—Its more fixed urinaceous salt, and, by accident, foreign marine
salt.

33\. Q.—Can this more fixed salt be brought over the alembic, with a
gentle heat, in form of a liquor?

A.—It may, but art and ingenuity are required.

34\. Q.—Where is the phlegm?

A.—In the salt; for in the preparation of putrefaction, the salt, being
putrefied in the phlegm, ascends together with it.

35\. Q.—Can it be separated?

A.—It may, but not by every artist.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

36\. Q.—What will this spirit do when it is brought to this?

A.—Try, and you will wonder at what you shall see in the solution of
bodies.

37\. Q.—Is not this the Alkahest?

A.—This liquor cannot consist without partaking of the virtues of man's
blood; and in urine the footsteps thereof are observable.

38\. Q.—In urine, therefore, and blood the Alkahest lies hid?

A.—Nature gives us both blood and urine; and from the nature of these
pyrotechny gives us a salt which art circulates into the circulated salt
of Paracelsus.

Q.—You speak short.

39\. A.—I will add this; the salt of blood ought so to be transmuted by
the urinaceous ferment that it may lose its last life, preserve its
middle life, and retain its saltness.

40\. Q.—To what purpose is this?

A.—To manifest the excellency which is in man's blood above all other
blood

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

whatever, which is to be communicated to the urine (after an
excrementitious liquor is separated from it), whence this urine excels
all others in a wonderful virtue.

41\. Q.—Why do you add urine?

A.—You must know that to transmute things a corruptive ferment is
required, in which respect all other salts give place to the strong
urinous salt.

42\. Q.—Cannot the phlegm be collected apart from the salt?

A.—It may, if the urine be not first putrefied.

43\. Q.—How great a part of the water is to be reckoned phlegm?

A.—Nine parts of ten, or thereabouts, distilled from fresh urine are to
be rejected, the tenth part (as much as can be extracted in form of
liquor) is to be kept; from that dried urine which remains in the bottom
by a gentle fire (which will not cause sublimation), let the salt be
extracted with water, so that there be as much water as half that urine
whence this feces was

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

dried; whatsoever is imbibed by the water, let it be poured off by
decanting; let it be strained, or purged, per deliquium; then filter it
through a glass. Let fresh water be poured on, and reiterate this work
till the salt become pure, then join this vastly stinking salt with your
last spirit and cohobate it.

PRAISED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD.—AMEN.
