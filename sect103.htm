<H1>What is a Collection Copyright?</H1>
</CENTER>


The following is an excerpt from the 
<A HREF="https://www.loc.gov/copyright/title17/circ92.html">
Copyright Law of the United States</A>:
<P>
<H3>&sect; 103. Subject matter of copyright: 
Compilations and derivative works</H3>
<P>(a) The subject matter of copyright as specified by
section 102 includes compilations and derivative works,
but protection for a work employing preexisting material
in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part
of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully.</P>
<P>(b) The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends
only to the material contributed by the author of such work,
as distinguished from the preexisting material employed
in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right in
the preexisting material. The copyright in such work
is independent of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope,
duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright
protection in the preexisting material.</P>
