### The Eleventh Figure

'Although the sun did once shine upon thee, and thou hast glutted
thyself with food and plunder, and wast sitting among the honeycombs,
yet thou hast not wisely considered the end, and hast forgotten the
winter; therefore he taketh away thy pleasure, and will compel thee to
suck thine own paws. For as thou art bear-like, and has no further
reason, Magic hath driven thee into the toils that thou shouldst be
known. But if the wit of man had been thine, the winter would not have
overtaken thee.'
