### The Eighth Figure

'Who is he that knoweth on whom the Sun shines, or to whom it shall
give, what man by himself can in no wise take? Therefore because it is
in the hand of God and He giveth it to whom He wills, thence follows it
that man's resistance is in vain. For the hour hath come that thou shalt
cease to be, notwithstanding thy strength, thy allies, thy power. For
all thou hast established shall fall with thee, thou shalt delude
thyself and others to thy own pity.'
