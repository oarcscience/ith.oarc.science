Like the better known [Prophecies of Nostradamus](../../nos/index.md), the
Prophecies of Paracelsus are exceedingly cryptic, filled with
allegorical symbols and capable of being reinterpreted for any purpose.
It comes with 32 surreal woodcuts which seem to reveal additional
details about each prophecy.

This short book, published in London in 1915 in the shadow of the Great
War, was written anonymously (I have yet to figure out who 'J.K.' is).
It wraps the 32 prophecies in introductions and interpretations by the
mysterious J.K. as well as Eliphas Lévi, the French occultist--who
apparently felt that this text should be left to the experts. The
original J.K. edition is somewhat rare, and it was reprinted in 1974 by
Weiser, although the latter is out of print.

Paracelsus, a renowned scholar who is known for his chemical and
alchemical writings, may have meant this not only as a set of
predictions about the path of the Reformation, but as an allegory of the
evolution of the soul. This would not be surprising, as other authors of
the period cloaked arcane messages in almost impenetrable layers of
symbolism to escape eccelsiastical scrutiny.
