<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Another Prognostication by Theophrastus Paracelsus</H1>
<P><A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A></P>
<P>'I BEAR in mind that you may not believe me when I tell you that my (at this time) despised writings shall yet be held in great value and esteem by wise and judicious men.</P>
<P>'It will, however, not happen until the great and fearful eclipse of the sun is past.</P>
<P>'I say that then there shall overflow as the waters of a mighty river all kinds of revolts, riots, wars, slaughter, murders, conflagrations and all evil into the northern countries.</P>
<P>'Then beware Brabant, Flanders and Zealand, and ye who like my Swiss countrymen feed upon cheese.</P>
<P>'Then will the Lily be altogether decayed, exhausted and cast down.</P>
<P>'In the same wise will the Eagle be plucked, dishonoured, insulted and despised.</P>
<P>'Othman will be foremost and the Eagle shall cringe before him.</P>
<P>'Good times shall then be. Fruit and what is necessary for life will thrive, but the poor will enjoy little thereof.</P>
<P>'The Spiritual will grow and increase as the Moon.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A></P>
<P>'Then those of the East will for a time have a great Victory and exalt the Golden Tower.</P>
<P>'The people without a head will not remain untouched.</P>
<P>'Then shall the high nobility be punished as though they were criminals.</P>
<P>'The Lion having Blue and White for associates will march in, in a high manner.</P>
<P>'Beware, thou beautiful City, that wast formerly a lustre and eye of Europe.</P>
<P>'The Rue-wreath dwindles to nought. Doth there not remain of this conflagration one spark, that shall soon after begin to burn and light an inextinguishable fire?</P>
<P>'Now when these things come to pass, neither truth, nor faith, nor fidelity, nor honour will be esteemed.</P>
<P>'But there will be many truths, many fidelities, many honours; but they will be of such a kind that they may be known and considered as no faith, no truth, no fidelity and no honour.</P>
<P>'The White will for some time overcome the Black with the Black and will accomplish great things.</P>
<P>'The Pomegranate will burst and throw out his seeds and will let them perish.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A></P>
<P>'Then shall the Rue-plant or Rue-wreath incline its root or natural origin to the Lily and shall stand as a shield before her, that the Wind of Health may not blow upon her.</P>
<P>'The people of the earth shall then be in commotion, and no ties of brotherhood, marriage or friendship will be respected.</P>
<P>'The Lion will join himself to the Fishes.</P>
<P>'And the Crown will be subject to the Fine Hat.</P>
<P>'Then will the Rue-wreath be soiled with Milk.</P>
<P>'And the Pelican shall be devoured by his young.</P>
<P>'But the Phoenix shall be consumed in the fire, and when the dew moistens the ashes he will again revive according to his Nature.</P>
<P>'But he will become a noble Phoenix, and will press hard upon the Toad, and he will take to the Lion and will give him a choice.</P>
<P>'The Lion will select the best and no more.</P>
<P>'Upon the other Wild Horse this Phoenix will place a bridle and will ride it with spurs but without a saddle.</P>
<P>'Then a new generation of beasts with various strange heads shall be born. They will have many mouths and stomachs, but only one natural draught.</P>
<P>'The most profligate will maintain his magnificence,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></P>
<P>and his angels will be clothed in blood. They will be intent upon one work alone.</P>
<P>'A pair of horses will appear and in all places will the wail of the fugitives be heard.</P>
<P>'The Dragon of Sleep will cause the Eagle to become weary of all magnificence.</P>
<P>'The Fountain of Life will commence to flow.</P>
<P>'And a white Eagle will be changed into black.</P>
<P>'Milk and Blood will decrease, and the animal Tree will begin to grow.</P>
<P>'An old Lion will be bound and a young Lion will become free. He will please all those animals which the old had vexed.</P>
<P>'He will do even more, for he will change his mane and hair into silk.</P>
<P>'The Bear will lay snares, and the Ox-head will seek to gore him.</P>
<P>'The Griffin will fly over him but will not harm him.</P>
<P>'Then shall the Pearl, so long lost, be found by one of humble estate, and will be set, as a jewel, in gold.</P>
<P>'It will be given to the Prince of all beasts, that is, to the right Lion.</P>
<P>'He will hang it about his neck, and wear it with honour.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A></P>
<P>'He will resist the Bear and the Wolf, and rend them asunder; so that the beasts of the forest shall be safe.</P>
<P>'Then will the Old Art flourish and no heed will be given to the New.</P>
<P>'Then will the New World begin, and the White and the Black shall disappear.</P>
<P>'All Vain glory will be ended, and the plumes of the bird of the East shall be burnt by the Sun of the South.</P>
<P>'How then will it be with thee, Oh thou Lion and earthly one who art painted and bound with gold?</P>
<P>'All thy doings shall be changed, and the seven heads shall become one head.</P>
<P>'Out of this one, a head shall be born that shall be armed with a horn.</P>
<P>'This horn shall bruise all that which has so long brought sorrow to Iffinos.</P>
<P>'And the great City shall be the head of the less and shall become free from servitude.</P>
<P>'Europe shall be the head, Asia the crown, but Africa shall be the jewel.</P>
