### The Second Figure

'A flower groweth to the destined height. He that causeth her to grow
also causeth her to fade. This happens to thee, for *Magic* hath
therewith adorned thee, that thy coming up should be known, and also how
thou has come to nought. For before thou wast, *Magic* hath known thee
and therefore compared thee to a flower, that to-day is in bloom and
to-morrow is withered. Wisdom and Fear of God would have preserved thee,
but thou has overlooked it, thine own wisdom hath seduced thee.'
