### The Third Figure

'In good peace hast thou been sitting, but thou hast not known it, and
hast allowed thyself to be moved. Thy wilfulness hath overturned and
divided thee and no more shalt thou have thy former glory. Therefore art
thou humbled and hast again become what thou wast formerly. Thou
shouldst have been of aid and use to the whole world, and shouldst have
set at rest others as well as thyself, but thou hast been seduced by
what was rejected by thy forefathers. Although thou wilt repent, yet no
one will rejoice through thee.'
