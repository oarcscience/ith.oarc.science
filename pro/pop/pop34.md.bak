### The Twenty-Ninth Figure

'Thus shall it come to pass that each one will be led into its own
pasture. For feeding in strange pasture causeth distress, contention,
and misery in this world. As soon as each one cometh into its own stall
there shall be unity. For the mouth becometh depraved, feeding according
to its lust as it pleaseth the jaws; all that cometh of going into
strange pastures. How blessed shall be the hour, and the poverty, that
will come and shall ordain each one to its meadow, not far from the year
XXXXIII.'
