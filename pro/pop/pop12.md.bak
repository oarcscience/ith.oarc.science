### The Seventh Figure

'Because from time to time thou hast been self-willed thou art
predestined to be surrounded by much adversity. For thou hast not
considered of thyself how thou art prefigured magically under the symbol
of a stone, as both fat and lean. Thou dost not know it, therefore thou
fallest beneath the punishment that hath broken up all empires. Had thy
pretended wisdom and understanding been thine own thou wouldst have been
beyond disaster, and moreover other empires would have taken thee as a
mirror. But it is not so, therefore thy wisdom proveth to be a folly at
this time.'
