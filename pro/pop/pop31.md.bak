### The Twenty-Sixth Figure

'The Sybil hath been mindful of thee when she placed the "F," and right
well art thou now standing in the rose; for thou art ripe and time hath
brought thee. What the Sybil saith of thee shall be accomplished and
even more shall be said of thee. The summer that bringeth roses is that
contrary time wherein all things are divided; which is an indication
that man was building on sand. This must pass away, and thou shalt set
it upon the rock that many will be astounded. For when the time cometh,
also therewith cometh that wherefore the time hath come.'
