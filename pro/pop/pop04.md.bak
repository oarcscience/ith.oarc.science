### III. ELIPHAS LÉVI'S PREFACE TO THE PROGNOSTICATIONS

IN *La Clef des Grands Mystères*, mentioned in the Prefatory Remarks,
Eliphas Lévi gives: *The Preface to the Prognostication of Doctor
Theophrastus Paracelsus*, of which the following is a translation:

'Socrates, discoursing one day upon the too curious research of
celestial things, during which one forgets the realities of human life,
and of the earth that lies at our feet, exclaims: "That which is above
our comprehension does not exist for us"; wishing thereby to say that a
timorous and superstitious consideration of the heavens is vain, useless
and dangerous.

'It may be indeed that a wise man warned by his reason of peril may be
deterred from such study. Elsewhere Socrates, in the Dialogues of Plato,
everywhere praises moderation and balance in all things. It is thus that
the words of this great philosopher should be understood; for there is
no reason to suppose that he would calumniate astrology, he being
himself, according to the testimony of Plato, an excellent Astrologer.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

'I will not here essay an apology for a science honoured by many learned
men, I will only say one word: that there is not another art that can so
justly be called divine in its source, in its tradition and in its
theory. Read Moses, he will tell you why God has placed in the firmament
the sun, the moon, and the stars to be for signs and for seasons, and
for days and for years; which inspires Saint Paul to praise those wise
men of the world who have found and known in visible things their
invisible Creator. It is true that he continues to blame them for not
having honoured him more than the creature. God wills, in fact, that we
should be attentive to the law of the elements, in order to elevate
ourselves from the work to its Author, to know and adore Him; for all
appearances and all material forms are but marks and veils that allow
the most intimate secrets of nature to be divined beneath them.

'Thus were those magnificent sciences invented, thus were those
marvellous arts born, that make us discover in roots, in stones, and
even in men powers occult to the vulgar and revealed only to the
sagacity of those sages named by Hesiod and by Homer μεροπες, meropes,
that is to say, great seekers.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

'All the while let us not attribute too much to human intelligence. It
is a divine Wisdom descending from the Father of Light, according to the
text of St. James. God has given us characters forming letters; He has
attached to them all the feelings of the Soul. Through them we can
speak; through them as through a divine instrument, He transmits to us
and teaches us every day the secrets of all sciences.

'God having thus adapted the wonders of creation to the use of man, has
established from the beginning a school of initiation for that. Wisdom
which all may not comprehend. There we learn with care the things hidden
from the multitude. Thus the fisherman draws his net from the depths of
the sea filled with fish that he never saw; the miners bring forth
masses of gold and silver from the depths of the earth where the eye
cannot penetrate. In this wise in the school of Nature God teaches us
and places before our eyes things altogether unknown. Thus there is
nothing hidden which shall not become revealed and placed in the light;
be it in the firmament of the heavens, be it in the sea, be it in the
earth, all must be brought forth to the light of the day by those great
seekers of whom I have spoken.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

'Meanwhile these celebrated men by their science cause their immortal
names to pass from mouth to mouth; for they have in a manner cleared up
Nature, and their memory should never become extinct. The muse never
cedes her inheritance of glory to death. It is by genius that we live,
all the rest belongs to death.

'In same wise, according to our powers and the gift of Providence, have
we desired to glean after those noble harvesters and explained to the
world the threatenings of Nature and of the stars, for a period to come,
which is to last forty (query 400) years, in order that men may find
themselves informed, learning to fear God, and to prepare themselves for
the future chastisement of great crimes. It is impossible to express up
to what point all flesh has corrupted its way. Anarchy is everywhere.
Heaven and Earth are confounded, and were God not to shorten the days of
His wrath no flesh could be saved. The disorderly life of men of my time
is that which specially determined me carefully to study the stars.

'Now there are signs in the sun, the moon and the stars that announce
the speedy coming of the judgment of God. The axe is at the foot of the
tree, blood flows upon blood, and as the Prophet says,

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

no one among men disturbs himself about God, there is not one who seeks
Him. But the Prophets and Evangelists have at present the mission to
recall us to charity, concord and unity. Unity is in the Divine Triad,
and the Divine Triad is summarised in Unity.

'It is in this wise that in human society, unity, peace, and
tranquillity should arise. When unity is broken, plurality of power
immediately engenders discord and war. There are as many opinions as
there are heads; each one would make his own triumphant; then there is
no more harmony possible, but in unity there is rest with abundance of
peace. O how well and pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity!
exclaims the prophet David. Unity is the happiness of all creatures. The
Heavens have but one law of motion and harmony; the earth has but one
law to produce love, and gives her fruit in season. All obey unity,
except Satan and Man. Man, however, is sufficiently warned by the signs
of heaven, by the sun, the moon and the stars . . . But what do these
announce? He is too menaced with a sudden and quickly approaching end.
Happy is he that sitteth not in the chair of pestilence, and walketh not
in the counsel of scorners! The coming of God is at hand. The arm of the
avenger

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

falls on us; everyone feels the misfortunes coming which he cannot
avoid.

'Who will then struggle against God? One kicks not against the pricks
with impunity. The God of Hosts is the strong God, the jealous God, who
visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children to the fourth and
fifth generation.

'Oppose God, what folly! Foolhardy Titans who would dethrone Jupiter
were themselves overthrown by his thunder. It is time to show men their
madness, and it is this we propose to do by thirty-two figures
intelligible but to a small number of the elect.

'We have seen the consummate iniquity of the people of Gomorha, carrying
their blasphemies unto the heavens; but when things are pushed to
extremes, the overbent bow breaks, and men are driven by a fatal law to
a contrary extremity, whereby motion relaxes and the balance is
established.

'Thus by perpetrating crime after crime corruption shall exhaust itself;
and who can sadden thereat? Behold the salvation of the multitude is
coming and redemption shall overcome the kingdom of evil.

'Who would not be impatient to see the days

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

where unity shall be given unto us and we shall live in peace under only
one shepherd!

'Then no more troubles, no more injustice, the balm shall descend upon
the venerable beard of the High-Priest, the blessing, light, gratitude
to Heaven shall spread upon the children of unity.

'Pride having made itself odious even in Heaven, the faithful angels did
not weep at the fall of Lucifer, they affirmed the Divine sentence.

'Let us therefore not grieve if God opens now His Hell under the feet of
the haughty.

'Let us rather rejoice, for the judgment has commenced in the House of
God itself, and it will thence extend upon every kind of unjust pride.

'Our prediction has hardly any other aim than to reveal, as we have
said, the threatenings of Heaven against insolent heads.

'God desires to deliver and avenge finally His oppressed children
Himself, He wishes to cast down the powerful and to lift up the humble.
. . . But it is not yet there that the pains begin. The greatness of
evil has not yet revealed itself; it shall reveal itself, and with it a
force shall become manifested that will prevent the just from being
seduced and drawn into the ruin of the perverse.

'We say that no one shall be named in our

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

prophecy. God knows those whom He has resolved to chastise, men do not
know Him, but they shall sooner feel that justice has overtaken them
than we with our human sagacity can seek and divine. All is concealed
and nevertheless revealed to us.

'The Kabbala always veiled, never pronounces oracles without mysteries,
and we are assured that it is of her we receive Astrology. God blinds
the eyes and hardens the heart of those whom He has delivered to His
vengeance, for He no longer wishes to save them.

'In concluding this Preface I pray all those who will read these
articles to interpret my words in simplicity and not to seek
personalities under my emblems.

'Let them keep their minds free from all thoughts of hate, fear or envy.
The event will strike in justice and then those who will shall know.

'I know many others have worked in the same direction, I do not despise
either their knowledge nor their efforts, on the contrary I encourage
them.

'I see death flying over many monastic institutions, but if men would be
wise and were to return to God, He is merciful and good and allows
Himself to be moved by the importunity of prayers.

'We do not attribute to the stars a fatal power,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

they impel us by their influence, but if the Master wills it, He alone
can alter the direction and change all. Joshua prayed and the sun stood
still to allow him to accomplish his victory. Hezekiah prayed and the
shadow tarried on the sundial. Elijah prayed and the heavens closed. The
continual prayer of the righteous is all powerful. Those who would avert
the threatened danger have but to repent, to pray, to live wisely and
soberly. God our Father gives us His Grace by Christ and in His Holy
Spirit. Amen.'

This Preface is imbued with the Spirit of Paracelsus but differs from
the Preface in the German edition of the Prognostications given in the
following section.
