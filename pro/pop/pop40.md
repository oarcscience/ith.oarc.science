# Epilogue

THESE are the famous Prophecies of Theophrastus Paracelsus, considered
by Eliphas Lévi to be 'the most astounding monument and indisputable
proof of the reality and existence of the gift of natural prophecy.'

The Prophecies or Prognostications do not merely relate to events that
happened in the age of the Reformation, and do not refer strictly to 24
or 42 years after they were published, but suggest events that happened
long after, some that are even now happening, and others that will
happen in the future.

Nearly four centuries have elapsed since these predictions were made. I
have neither altered nor suppressed any of them, but only translated
from the old German to the best of my ability.

Whatever interpretation may be given to these predictions their ancient
origin cannot be disputed.

They were first published about the year 1530, and are extant in print
of that period. It is true the first editions give no date, and it is
uncertain whether the Latin edition preceded the German, as the latter

shows more originality of expression. It is by no means improbable that
the Latin version referred to by Eliphas Lévi may be only a translation.

The German edition Of 1530, which is also found reprinted in the works
of Paracelsus collected by Johann Huser and published at Strassburg in
the year 1616, was taken as the original for the present translation.
The Prophecies occur in vol. ii, pp. 594-608.

The Plates have also been reproduced from the old woodcuts of that
edition.

The original Manuscript of Paracelsus is said to be in the Court Library
of the Grand Duke of Baden at Karlsruhe.
