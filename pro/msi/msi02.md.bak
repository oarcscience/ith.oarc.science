ALLY THEMSELVES TO THE EVIL ONE--THE BIRTH OF MOTHER SHIPTON--HER
WONDERFUL NOSE--HER BABYHOOD AND SCHOOLDAYS--HER ALLEGED PROPHECIES AND

The miraculous incidents in the life of Mother Shipton, as published in
various almanacs and pamphlets during the last 200 years, are, for the
most part, culled from a book written by Richard Head. The earliest
extant edition of this work is dated 1684, and to it his initials only
are attached. Another edition dated 1687 has his name appended to the
preface. The first of these editions is in the British Museum Library,
and the following is a copy of its title page:--

London, Printed for Benj. Harris, at the *Stationers-Armes* and *Anchor*
under the *Piazza of the Royal Exchange*. 1684.

Head's book, in the black-letter edition of 1684, sets forth at
considerable length, that in 1486 a woman named Agatha Shipton lived in
a place called "Naseborough " near the Dropping Well in Yorkshire. Her
parents died, and she came to poverty. The Devil

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

approached her in handsome guise, made love to her, carried her off on a
demon steed, displayed before her a phantom but apparently real mansion,
in which they were married. He promised to give her power over "haile,
tempests, with lightning and thunder," the power of traveling from place
to place in an instant, and to place the hidden treasures of the earth
at her disposal, on certain conditions.

Allured by these promises "she condescended to all the Devil would have
her do. Whereupon he bid her say after him, in this manner: *Raziel
ellimiham irammish zirigai Psonthonphanchia Raphael elhaveruna
tapinotambecaz mitzphecat jarid cuman hapheah Gabriel Heydonturris
dungeonis philonomostarkes sophecord hankim*. After she had repeated
these words after him, he pluckt her by the Groin, and there immediately
grew a kind of Tet, which he instantly suckt, telling her that must be
his constant Custom with her, morning and evening; now did he bid her
say after him again, *Kametzeatuph Odel Pharaz Tumbagin Gall Flemmegen
Victow Denmarkeonto*, having finisht his last hellish speech, which the
chiefest of his Minions understand not, out of which none but the Devil
himself can pick out the meaning; I say, it thundered so horribly, that
every clap seemed as if the vaulted roof of Heaven had crackt and was
tubling down on her head; and withal, that stately Palace which she
thought she had been in, vanisht in a trice; so did her sumptuous
apparel: and now her eyes being opened, she found herself in a dark
dolesome, Wood; a place which from the Creation, had scarce ever enjoyed
the benefit of one single Sun-Beam. Whilst she was thinking what course
to steer in order to her return, two flaming fiery Dragons appear'd
before her tyed to a Chariot, and as she was consulting with her self
what was best to be done, she insensibly was hoisted into it, and with
speed unimaginable conveyed through the Air to her own poor Cottage."

Signs and wonders thenceforth attended Agatha wherever she went, so that
the neighbours were too much afraid of her to persecute her, especially
as a winged dragon had

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

once carried her away from the presence of the local magistrate.

In course of time her hellish offspring came into the world. The baby
Mother Shipton was at the time of her birth "of an indifferent height,
but very morose and big bon'd, her head very long, with very great
goggling, but sharp and fiery Eyes, her Nose of an incredible and
unproportionable length, having in it many crooks and turnings, adorned
with many strange Pimples of divers colours, as Red, Blew, and mixt,
which like Vapours of Brimstone gave such a lustre to her affrighted
spectators in the dead time of the Night, that one of them confessed
several times in my hearing, that her nurse needed no other light to
assist her in the performance of her Duty: Her cheeks were of a black
swarthy Complexion, much like a mixture of black and yellow jaundies;
wrinckled, shrivelled, and very hollow; insomuch, that as the Ribs of
her Body, so the impression of her Teeth were easily to be discerned
through both sides of her Face, answering one side to the other like the
notches in a Valley, excepting only two of them which stood quite out of
her Mouth, in imitation of the Tushes of a wild Bore, or the Tooth of an
Elephant. . . . . The Neck so strangely distorted, that her right
shoulder was forced to be a supporter to her head, it being propt up by
the help of her chin . . . . . Her Leggs very crooked and mishapen: The
Toes of her feet looking towards her left side; so that it was very hard
for any person (could she have stood up) to guess which road she
intended to stear her course; because she never could look that way she
resolved to go."

This lovely creature was put out to nurse at the charge of the parish.
Miraculous and unpleasant incidents occurred around her cradle; her
attendants were sometimes goaded to exertion by imps in the form of
apes. One day Mother Shipton, cradle and all, were missing; sweet
harmony from an unknown source was heard; finally the babe and cradle
were found three feet up the chimney. As she grew old her foul fiend of
a father visited her daily in the form of a cat, dog, bat, or hog. She
was sent to school where, says the

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

chronicler, "her Mistris began to instruct her, as other children,
beginning with the Cris-cross-row as they call'd it, showing and naming
onely three or four Letters, at first, but to the amazement and
astonishment of her Mistris; she exactly pronounced every Letter in the
Alphabet without teaching. Hereupon her Mistris, shewed her a Primmer,
which she read awel at first sight, as any in the School, and so
proceeded in any book was shown her."

Later still Mother Shipton began to tell fortunes, and to foretell the
future. High and low flocked to her for information about their private
affairs. According to Head she foretold the visit of Henry VIII to
France, the death of Cardinal Wolsey, the downfall of the Catholic power
in England, the death of the Duke of Somerset, also that of Lady Jane
Grey, and various events in the reigns of Elizabeth, Charles I, Oliver
Cromwell, and Charles II. Finally she died, honoured and esteemed, and a
stone was erected to her memory at Clifton, about a mile from the city
of York.

In very early times Mother Shipton figured in comedy. An old book in the
British Museum Library has the following title page:--

"The Life of Mother Shipton. A new Comedy. As it was Acted Nineteen days
together with great Applause. *Folia Ampla Sybillæ* Virg. Written by T.
T.--London, Printed by and for *Peter Lillicrap*, and are to be sold by
T. Passinger" \[Title-page torn here\] "the three Bibles on London
Bridge." \[Then in writing is added the date 1610, but the real date is
about 1660.\]

The comedy bears a resemblance here and there to Head's narrative. The
scene is laid partly in "*Nasebrough Grove in Yorkshire*;" the heroine
and prophetess is Agatha Shipton; no daughter Ursula appears in it at
all. On page 15 a village crier is made to announce "O Yes, if any man
or woman, in City, Town or Country can tell me tydings of *Agatha
Shipton*, the daughter of *Solomon Shipton* Ditch digger lately
deceased, let them bring word to the Cryer of the village, and they
shall be well rewarded for their pains."

Agatha marries the devil, as in other versions of the story, but cheats
him at the last:--

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

"\[Soft Musick and an Angel descends with a Book.\]

"*Shipton* despair not but in hope grow strong,  
Thou shalt find Mercy though thou hast done wrong;  
Road ore this book and in it thou shalt find  
The summe of thy aspire to free thy mind  
From fear, thy soul secure from harm  
Of any Devils! 'tis a happy charme!"

Pluto enters with "all the Devils," and finding Agatha Shipton released
from their power exclaims:--

"Was ever Devil gull'd so  
  "VVell lets descend and all Hell shall howl  
  This full fortnight for losse of *Shipton's* soul.  
         "\[*Exeunt* with horrid Musick\].  
"*Shipton*. So let them roare.  
  VVhilst I do all their Hellish Acts despise  
  The higher powers make me truly wise."
