Ward is one of the best known 'Nostradamians'. He is an emphatic
believer in the accuracy of the predictions, and he marshals a huge
amount of linguistic and historical erudition to make his case. He is
also a consummate stylist; his convoluted Victorian prose will leave
many readers rubbing their eyes. At times his writing becomes almost
(inadvertantly) Joycean (for instance, his rhapsody on Napoleon on [p.
250](oon19)).

Ward makes some key points for any prospective interpreter of
Nostradamus. First of all, Nostradamus' text is not written entirely in
French; certainly it would not serve as a good text to learn modern
French. He mixes 16th Century French, Latin, Lang d'Oc (a Provençal
dialect of French similar to Catalan), words of his own invention such
as anagrams and strange amalgams; as well as (cue the echo chamber)
*words from the future*. I've already pointed out the startling term
'Eussouis' (USA) in my [essay on 9/11](../091101). Ward notes (see [page
130](oon11.htm#page_130)) that Nostradamus uses a slang word, in
context, for a component of an improved flintlock ('dog') nearly a
century before it was invented. Nostradamus also uses a term for
conscription (see [p. 248](oon18.htm#page_248)) in a sense not used
until about 1800.

Another point which comes up again and again is that it is almost
impossible to use Nostradamus to actually *predict* events. The
predictions usually only make sense in hindsight. It is far too easy to
predict 'there will be earthquakes, floods, famine'. What distinguishes
Nostradamus is the accuracy of his 'hits' when viewed in the rear view
mirror. In particular, Wards' exposition of Nostradamus' presages of
specific events of the French revolution is one of the strongest
portions of the book. Nostradamus predicts details of the unfolding
events that are far too close to be coincidence, yet would have made no
sense whatsoever when first published. For instance, constant reference
to 'a place of tiles' is made (the Tuileries), long before it was
constructed.

Lastly, Ward makes an interesting speculation about Nostradamus' method.
He hypothesizes that Nostradamus viewed and heard the events he
described in sequence, and wrote prose notes; subsequently he composed
the enigmatic poetry, cut them into separate verses and randomized them
(*anticipating* the surrealist poets, perhaps?). Although Ward only
details 15% of Nostradamus' verses, he ties them together into a
sequence which makes a great deal of sense.

In hindsight.

Bibliographic note: Although this book is fairly rare as a first
edition, there is a 1940 Charles Scribner's and Sons Modern Library
reprint. The Modern Library edition has a selection of additional
quatrains appended (which can't be included here for copyright reasons).
This edition is very common and inexpensive on the used book market, and
should be the cornerstone of any Nostradamus collection.
