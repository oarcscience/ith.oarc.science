# Henri Quatre

THE COMING OF HENRI IV. (AUGUST 2, 1589). \[I. 105.\]

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 50.

Mendosus <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md) tost viendra à son haut
regne,  
Mettant arriere un peu les Norlaris: <span
id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_116.md)  
Le rouge blesme, la masle à l'interregne,  
Le jeune crainte, et frayeur Barbaris.

Translation.

Mendosus shall soon come to his high dominion,  
Setting back those of Lorraine a little.  
The old cardinal pale, the male of the interregnum,  
The young man timid, and the barbarian alarmed.

HENRI IV. the heretic Vendôme, changed his religion thrice, Jeanne
d'Albert, his mother, brought him up a Protestant. To escape St.
Bartholomew's Day, he professed Catholicism, in 1572. In 1576, he turned
to Protestantism, to head the Calvinist party. He declared himself
Catholic to take the throne of France. Through the Salic law he
ascended, to the exclusion of the Lorraine princes (*Nolaris*). In this
way, he shut out the old Cardinal de Bourbon, pale (*blesme*) with age,
the Duc de Mayenne, Lieutenant General of the kingdom during the
interregnum, the young Duc de Guise, and the barbarously savage Philip
Il. of Spain, who had pretensions

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

to the crown through Elizabeth his wife, the daughter of Henri II.

The Cardinal is *rouge* because of the dress of all cardinals. Philip
allied himself with the Guises. and supported the Catholic League.

THE DEPRESSION OF THE DE GUISE FAMILY (1589-1593). \[I. 107.\]

Century X.--*Quatrain* 18.

Le rang Lorrain fera place à Vendosme,  
Le haut mis bas, et le bas mis en haut,  
Le fils de Mamon sera esleu <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md) en
Rome,  
Et les deux Grands seront mis en defant.

Translation.

The house of Lorraine yields to the Vendôme,  
The high put low, the low put high instead,  
The son of Mamon they elect at Rome,  
And the Pretenders both are in default.

The house of Lorraine is now eclipsed by that of Vendôme. Mayenne, the
chief, is put down, and *le petit Béarnais*, Henri IV., rises to respect
and power. This heretic son of mammon is accepted by choice at Rome for
King of France, and neither of the Pretenders will ever be king.

The Cardinal de Bourbon had been actually proclaimed King by the League,
as Charles X., but he was dead in 1590. Isabella, the daughter of Philip
II., was incapable by the Salic law. So that the only two remaining were
the Duc de Mayenne and the young Duc de Guise. They were shut out by
Henri IV. and never reached the throne.

HENRI IV. ABJURES PROTESTANTISM (JULY 21, 1593). \[I. 108.\]

Presage 76.

Par le legat du terrestre et marin,  
Le Grande Cape <span id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_118.md) à tout

Qu'à <span id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_121.md) son advis ne voudra accorder.

Translation.

Before the legate of the earth and sea,  
Henry the Great will yield to all required:  
Mayenne to all will listen and not speak a word,  
And will grant nothing of his own free will.

Sixtus V. had boldly fulminated an excommunication against Henri Quatre,
the great Capet, but the latter subscribes to all required by the legate
of him who can bind and loose all on the earth and sea. He abjures
Protestantism at St. Denis, on July 25, 1593, the Archbishop of Bourges
officiating. The Duc de Mayenne (the *Lorraine*), Lieutenant-General of
France and Master of Paris for the League, will look on in silence, and
as far as he can will prevent Paris from receiving the King. The city
did not open its gates to him till March 22, 1594, eight months after
the abjuration.

MARSEILLES TAKEN BY THE SPANIARDS (FEBRUARY 17, 1596). \[I. 109.\]

Century III.--*Quatrain* 88.

De Barselonne par mer si <span id="fr_122"></span>[4](#fn_122.md) grand'
armée,  
Toute Marseille de frayeur tremblera:  
Isles saisies, de mer ayde fermée,  
Ton traditeur <span id="fr_123"></span>[5](#fn_123.md) en terre
nagera. <span id="fr_124"></span>[6](#fn_124.md)

Translation.

From Barcelona a great fleet shall come,  
And terror strike into the town Marseilles:  
The isles are seized, and help by sea cut off,  
But the betrayer is made swim on land.

 

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

A Spanish fleet of a dozen galleys, commanded by Charles Doria, was sent
by Philip II. to help the Leaguers. He took possession of the islands
Chateau d'If and Ratonneau, and thus cut off all help to seaward.
Charles de Casau (*le traditeur*) was consul, and proposed to place the
city in the hands of the Spaniards; Pierre Libertat, however, ran him
through with a sword, and the populace dragged the dead body through the
muddy channels of the streets.

Guynaud refers to the same event as fulfilling this quatrain in the time
of Henri IV., but by a misprint gives 1536 instead of 1596. The islands
he mentions are those of St. Honnorat and of St. Marguerite. Black's
pretentious *Imperial Gazetteer* professes to give a plan of the town,
and you see a number of nameless vermicelli streets running all about,
but not a single island off the coast is visible. One may suppose,
however, that the islands are there, and that all the four were occupied
by the Spaniards.

BIRON'S PUNISHMENT (DECEMBER 2, 1602). \[I. 110.\]

Sixain 6.

Quand de Robin <span id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md) la traisteruse

Translation.

When Biron's treason and disastrous act,  
Shall put King Henry and his Lords in fear,<span id="page_117">p.
117</span>  
Lafin betrays him, and the King beheads.  
Treason dispatched to Spain in amity, <span

The carrier caught when he has entered France, <span
id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131.md)  
And the scriv'ner will throw himself into the water.

One thing has carefully to be borne in mind in relation to the Sixains,
that they were presented to Henri Quatre, and printed for the first time
in 1605. That is to say, the) first appeared three years after this had
happened. To the sceptically disposed they can furnish no authority, but
to ordinary men, who only look for ordinary evidence, it will appear
that there is very little as to style that would not appropriately
spring from the pen of Nostradamus; and further, that if they are
forgeries, the forgers have not taken advantage of their knowledge of
the events to make the prophecies any clearer or more striking. These
are quite as enigmatical as if our author had written them, and I think
that common sense will generally be content to take them for what they
are worth, and will regard them as probably genuine "chips of the old
block" and as such very curious.

Guynaud in his *Concordance*, p. 137, gives a full and interesting
account of Biron; chiefly extracted from Davila, Montluc, De Thou,
Mezeray, Le Père Anselm, and so forth,

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

where the reader can refer for further details, if interested. I may
just note that I have copied the date of December 2, 1602, from Le
Pelletier, but that Moreri gives the date of Biron's decapitation as
July 31, 1602, in the Court of the Bastille. The name of the messenger
(*poste*) was Picoté, a native of Orleans, sold, as they say, to the
King of Spain (Guynaud, p. 140).

Garencières has (p. 464) a very elaborate annotation upon this stanza,
giving the whole history of Biron and Lafin in twenty-eight folio pages.
Biron appears to have been a vain, a violent, and foolish man, though of
great courage and audacity in war, which made him highly valued by Henri
IV. After Amiens he refused to go to quiet the towns of Picardy, unless
his statue were erected in brass before the Louvre. His sudden
prosperity had turned his head. The treasonous proposals with Spain
were, that he was to have a daughter of the Duke of Savoy in marriage,
500,000 crowns, and sovereign rights in Burgundy. These were negotiated
through Lafin; and Lafin told the King. The whole trial is given, with
Biron's defence in reply, which is audacious and eloquent, but much of
it is highly contradictory. He was condemned and executed in the court
of the Bastille, on July 31, 1602, which coincides with Moreri. The
superstitious, ignorant, violent, but able soldier comes out most
characteristically. He shows in emergency great rapidity of thought,
decision, and presence of mind; but a deficient judgment, very little
principle, and an overwhelming conceit, that, encouraged by success,
almost merged into madness. A man of this sort is always a compound of
inconsistencies; accordingly he said to the Chancellor, in speaking of
death, "I have not been afraid of it these twenty years." And that was
true, when in war, a duel, or hot blood; but in the court of the
Bastille he was thought to

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

show great fear of dying. In earlier life he had wondered at himself for
fearing nothing from the thrust of a sword, though very nervous over the
prick of a lancet, when he had occasion to "be let blood," as they used
to phrase it. The fear of death is most in apprehension; but the
apprehension is most, perhaps it may be said, of the wicked in cold
blood, and of the good in violence, and when the blood is hot, if but
the least pause give time for reflection to enter. Garencières notes
that the greatest courage and stoutness of a man is nothing in
comparison of the weakness of human nature.

Two of Biron's adventures with astrologers are so characteristic of the
manners of the time, as recounted by Guynaud \[p. 137, etc.\], that I
think the reader should not be deprived of them. Whatever is strange and
rivets the attention must have something of humanity in it, and repay
the record, though a few superior people may look down upon such
trifling. I shall give them at the risk of running this annotation to
too great length.

When at Court with his father, at the age of eighteen or twenty, he had
a duel, and killed his man. He had to hide for this, till his father
could sue out his pardon, through the, Due d' Espernon, to whom
fortunately the father was known. He took the disguise of a
letter-carrier, and in this garb consulted an astrologer called La
Brosse, who lived in a garret at the top of a house near the Luxembourg.
He told the man that it was his master's horoscope he had need of. La
Brosse told him that one day he would be a very great man, in fact,
might almost be king, but for a *caput algol* that stood in the way.
What this was the man would not explain. Biron, however, continuing to
press very hard, got him to say at last that he would be beheaded on a
scaffold. Upon this, he burst out with the want of judgment he

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

showed all through his life (forty years in all) and beat the old man
mercilessly, leaving him nearly dead. He locked him maliciously into his
room, took away the key with him, and kicked down the little ladder that
gave access to the loft. But still he believed what had been
communicated.

On another occasion he consulted César, who was thought at the time to
be the most able astrologer in France. This man also affirmed that he
would have good fortune in almost everything. Except for a blow from a
Burgundian from behind, he might even be king. But he could not get from
him a word more.

When he was confined in the Bastille, a friend called on him, and Biron
asked him to ascertain for him from what part of the country the
executioner of Paris was; and when he came back and told him that he was
a Burgundian, Biron changed colour and said--"There will be no reprieve
then; I am as good as dead."

Now as to the fulfilment of the last two lines. It will appear that my
rendering is right, and that the scrivener will throw himself into the
water. The scrivener turns out to be a man named Nicholas l'Oste, born
at Orleans, secretary to Lord Villeroy, Chief Secretary of State, who,
finding him a most capable person, confided much in him, and the more so
that Oste's father had spent the greater part of his life in his
service. When Lord Rochepot was starting as ambassador for Spain, Oste
begged to accompany him as secretary. Villeroy immediately recommended
him, and he was engaged. In a few months' time he mastered the language
to such perfection, and so thoroughly accommodated himself to Spanish
manners, that he might well pass for a true-born Spaniard. When Rochepot
had got the treaty at Vervins ratified, the King of Spain gave him rich
presents--a chain of jewels, and six gold chains valued at a hundred

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

and fifty crowns apiece--to distribute amongst his suite, as he thought
fit. Oste was so full of himself that he thought he ought to have one of
them, but his master thought otherwise; on which, says Garencières, "the
Devil crept into his soul," and, as he wanted money to supply his
debaucheries, he determined to betray the State secrets which passed
through his hands.

With this in view, he applied to Don Fanchese, a Secretary of State, and
made his proposals, but the dignified Spaniard, for some reason or
other, received him coolly. "The Catholic King was in good amity with
the most Christian one, and required to know no more than the French
Ambassador should communicate to him." Nothing discouraged, our traitor
hurries off to Don Ydiaques, another secretary, and there meets with
excellent reception. He was presented to the Duke of Lerma, to whom he
betrayed the Alphabet of Ciphers. He received twelve hundred crowns upon
the spot, and was promised the like amount as a yearly pension. By his
means the Spanish Council knew the contents of all French instructions
as soon as the ambassador himself. When La Rochepot's mission ended,
Oste got back into Villeroy's service, and so was able to maintain
correspondence with Spain. Tuxis was ambassador from Spain in Paris, and
after him Don Baltazar de Caniga. With these men he established a close
intimacy, so that finally the Council in Spain got his letters before
Des Barreaux at Madrid could receive those from Henri IV.

Des Barreaux told the King that he was always now forestalled. Oste had
let a certain reprobate Raffis into his secret, and this fellow, who had
been banished, in order to obtain a reprieve of sentence, betrayed Oste
to Des Barreaux. When he got his pardon, he gave up the name of Oste.
Raffis came to Paris to communicate with Villeroy, and orders were

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

given to detain the two Spanish couriers that had reached the
post-office. They then kept a watch upon Oste, who was "doing his
devotions at the Charter-house of Paris,"--excellent Catholic, plotter
as he was. On reaching the post-office, he soon found he was betrayed;
and Descardes, who was to watch him, did not let him out of his sight
until he brought him to Villeroy's. When there, he thought his man was
safe, and went to announce his capture to Villeroy. Oste instantly ran
down to the stable, where his horse stood, still saddled, and galloped
away. A hue and cry was soon raised. Oste got a Spanish disguise at De
Cuniga's, and made off post-haste for Luxembourg. Postmasters were
forbidden to let out horses to any one; but at Meaux the postmaster had
received the order too late, for Oste was already on horseback, but no
sooner did he begin to gallop than his horse fell under him. His look of
dismay impressed the postillion who accompanied him, and he told his
master on his return. The postmaster told the sheriff, who came up with
him at the second ferry of *la Ferte sous Jouare*; but he was already on
the boat, and threatening the ferryman's life, the man put him ashore,
in spite of the sheriff's commands, shouted to him from the bank. He
rushed into the bushes and brambles near the Marne, hoping to escape in
the darkness of the night, the sheriff scattered his men everywhere,
raised the whole country side, and caused bonfires to be lighted in all
directions. Oste crept from bush to bush, but, either accidentally or
with intention, fell into the river Marne and was drowned. His hat was
found next day, stopped between two posts, and his body two days later.
So befitting a close to the career of a gifted dastard is a wholesome
exemplar of retributive justice, and should not easily be suffered to
fall out of men's recollection. Horace thinks that lame-foot justice
always trips the sinner. No

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

doubt, if we could see both worlds; but, as we cannot, I wish that here
the lame foot were considerably less lame. In England law and the
lawyers, her two crutches, seem to reduce Justice to a gouty incapable.
With our new Palace of Justice the morals of a Court seem to have dawned
upon us.

POPULARITY OF HENRI IV. (AFTER HIS DEATH). \[I. 112.\]

Century VI.--*Quatrain* 70.

An chef du monde le grand Chyren <span id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_132.md)
sera,  
Plus outre après aymé, craint, redouté;  
Son bruit et los <span id="fr_133"></span>[2](#fn_133.md) les cieux
surpassera,  
Et du seul titre victeur <span id="fr_134"></span>[3](#fn_134.md) fort
contenté.

Translation.

Chief of the world Henri le Grand shall be,  
More loved in death than life, more honoured he:  
His name and praise shall rise above the skies,  
And men will call him victor when he dies.

French self-esteem has always appropriated to France a throne of
pre-eminence beyond all other thrones. If it were possible, they would
set theirs above that of Jupiter. They pretend a most manly contempt for
kings. But the throne, you are to remember, is the work of *sans
cullottes*, French

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

cabinet-makers, and therefore the best thing of its kind in the
universe, and so *chef du monde*. If Nostradamus is no prophet for you,
you shall at least admit that he was a Frenchman. The Frenchman whips
the old world, and the American whips creation. The rest of us may look
forward to an eternity of corporal punishment in spite of the nominal
abolition of slavery. Condillac will furnish the logical distinction,
that establishes the honour of the throne, when a manly contempt has
been duly engendered for the sanctity of the king's majesty. Honest
Democrat! Do you read Condillac?

One of Voltaire's rhetorical squibs in the *Henriade*, which the French
are so indulgent as to call not only verse, but poetry, runs--

"Il fut de ses sujets le vainqueur et le père."  
"He was the papa and conquestor of his people."

When our Charles II. was addressed as "the father of his people," he
said he thought that he might be of a good many of them. But Henri
Quatre is too noble a creature for any good and wise man to wish to
dwell long upon his foibles. What a contrast between him and the
Napoleons!

emissum*. We are to understand this line to relate to l'Oste's
treasonable complicity with Spain, of which an account will be given
further on. Also, *l'escrivain*, in the closing line stands for the same
individual.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[117:2](oon10.htm#fr_131.md) We shall see that the
two Spanish couriers were arrested at the post office in Paris. Le
Pelletier confuses all this from not happening to know that l'Oste is
the scrivener, so he applies it to the affair of Lafin, whose messenger,
when carrying Spanish despatches, had thrown them into the river when he
found himself pursued. Unfortunately, when he finds himself in the
difficulty which this involves him in, he glazes till he has forced the
words to fit his erroneous view. He had far better have stated the
difficulty, and said that he could not harmonize the text. But he very
rarely trips thus.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[123:1](oon10.htm#fr_132.md) *Le Grand Chyren* is

name of Vendosme, from his father Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme
and King of Navarre. In the first Quatrain of the series, *Henri Quatre,
Vendosme* was anagrammatically given as Mendosus; as to *Chiren* it is
the precise anagram of *Henri*, as spelt in the old language *Henric*,
from the Latin *Henricus*. Numerous etymologies have been assigned to
Henry. Camden derived it from *honore*, Verstegan from the Teutonic
*Han*, a haven, and *Rice*, Saxon for rich. Killian writes it
*Heynrick*, or *Heymrick*, rich home. This is very nearly right, but now
it is generally considered that *rick* stands for powerful; so chief of
a house or district.
