# Louis XVI

WE enter now upon the lamentable period comprised in the Reign of Louis
XVI.--a period whose only parallel in history is the false and Illegal
trial of Charles I. of England; the perfectibility of man being evinced
only by the increased savagery and augmented moral turpitude exhibited
at the later period. The first quatrain that has been adduced as
pertaining to this period in the Centuries of Nostradamus is that of:

Century I.--*Quatrain* 57. \[I. 173.\]

Par <span id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_241.md) grand discord la terre <span
id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_242.md) tremblera,  
Accord rompu dressant la teste au ciel,  
Bouche sanglante dans le sang nagera,  
Au sol la face ointe de laict et miel.

Translation.

By reason of great discord the earth shall quake.  
Revolt destroys the old order and lifts its head to heaven.  
The \[King's\] mouth will swim in its own blood,  
And his front, anointed with milk and honey, roll upon the sod.

Tremblement de terre is earthquake, and from the time of Virgil, and
much earlier than that, has been always taken to forebode convulsions of
the State; disturbance of all things rooted and firm, and typifying
upheavals of the populace.

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> That it is the
King's mouth shall swim in blood is shown unmistakably by the fourth
line that follows, where the face is said to be anointed with the milk
and honey of the holy ampulla. The Kings of France were crowned at Reims
with the oil that was kept there in *la sainte ampoule* for this
purpose. The milk and honey is merely a figurative expression; oil and
wine, milk and honey, equally represent the fatness of the land.

Upon this quatrain, about the meaning of which he manifestly could know
nothing, Garencières naively says: "The words and sense are plain, and I
cannot believe there is any great mystery hidden under these words."
Words put a slight upon men's minds to think they understand what they
see written; from this it is clear that you may understand the words,
and yet comprehend nothing from understanding them. Orators please take
note.

Century III.--*Quatrain* 59. \[Bouys, 55.\]

Barbare empire par le tiers usurpé.  
La plus grand part dc son sang mettra à mort.  
Par mort sénile par lui le quart frappé;  
De peur que sang par le sang ne soit mort.

Translation.

The rude empire is usurped by the third estate (tiers état).  
It will put to death the greatest part of his \[the Royal\] family.  
A quarter \[of the kingdom\] is struck with senile death;  
For fear of retribution of death, from children of those murdered.

This must relate to 1789, as in no country but in France had the third
estate usurped exclusive power to itself. Since that period the House of
Commons in England has pursued the same lines, in a more covert,
gradual, and, as some would say, lawful manner. In the Lyons edition,
1558, the second line reads *mettra à mort*, which makes better sense,

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

though it spoils the rhythm, unless the *a* in *mettra* may suffer
elision in old French prosody--a question I lack knowledge to determine.
The quarter being destroyed, as old age withers a man, is to be
understood analogically of the lives of citizens removed by terror, or
emigration, or spoliation of property, or revolutionary taxation, or by
imprisonment.

Bouys tells us that *sang* is to be understood in Nostradamus of
children, family, relatives, so that *que sang par le sang* here would
mean, lest the families of the injured should rise against the assassins
of their flesh and blood. Such a reaction actually took place in the
South, in spite of all the truculent precautions taken. The quatrains
exhibit no kind of method or chronological order in their arrangement.
So that, out of the thousand and more that exist of them, the
commentator must hunt at large until he comes upon something salient
that enables him to attach the passage to some event, when often he will
be led to the most extraordinary results. The usurpation by the *tiers
êtat* here, with all but the very phrase supplied, and with the results
that would follow from the usurpation so unmistakably set forth, fixes
the pertinency of the quatrain almost as perfectly as if it had been
headed *French Revolution*. Yet a reader of less observance and care
than is requisite to stay the attention which leads to discovery, might
readily pass it over as jargon and mere nonsense. But, once you have
deciphered the quaint phrases and their connection, you cannot doubt the
meaning, nor the author's vivid gift of expression in conveying ideas,
with a terseness more than Tacitean, if less artistic. You discover that
Nostradamus can hint in a phrase of three words what would require a
long paragraph to make it explicit in an ordinary way. This is truly the
language

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

of prophecy. It becomes legible in the light of the event it prefigures,
as characters written in milk upon paper become visible at the fire, or
when placed in the hot light of the sun.

Century I.--*Quatrain* 36. \[Bouys, 56.\]

Tard le monarque se viendra repentir,  
De n'avoir mis à mort son adversaire;  
Mais viendra bien à plus haut consentir,  
(à ce) Que tout son sang par mort fera défaire.

Translation.

The monarch shall too late repent  
That he hath not put to death his adversary;  
But he will have to permit later on,  
That all his family shall suffer for it by death.

Taking this to be the meaning, it is clear that the adversary is the
Duke of Orleans,--that centre of all plotting and intrigue against
Louis,--who had so forgotten himself as, at a public bed of justice, in
1788, to shake his fist in the King's fact with a most threatening
expression of countenance. For this he was only sent into exile when he
ought to have suffered death. In the last line *sang* again stands for
family and relatives. This could scarcely be plainer if the names were
given; but, had Nostradamus here deviated from the secret idiom of
prophetic language, he would have prevented the accomplishment of what
he was asserting. Things like this may be happened on by chance, if you
choose to say so, but the theory reels under the constant repetition of
such chances. Men whose names are prominently before the world can
hardly be introduced into prophecy. But we shall see shortly that
Nostradamus is able to assign names with precision where the individuals
are of a lesser rank, and that their names may so pass unobserved until
history has recorded them with her iron pen.

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 20. (June 20, 1791.) \[I. 174.\]

De nuict viendra par le forest de Reines,  
Deux pars, vaultorte, Herne la pierre blanche,  
Le moyne noir en gris dcdans Varennes:  
Esleu Cap. cause tempeste, feu, sang, tranche.

Translation. \[II. P., I. 174.\]

By night shall come through the forest of Reines  
Two parts, face about, the Queen a white stone,  
The black monk in gray within Varennes.  
Chosen Cap. causes tempest, fire, blood, slice.

In the translation of this, Garencières leaves the two words *vaultorte
Herne* as in the original French, and does not attempt the translation.
He also mistakes Reines for Rennes, the chief town in Little Brittany.
He evidently has no conception whatever of the meaning of the quatrain.
Bouys and Le Pelletier differ on minor points in rendering these words,
*Forest*, Le Pelletier reads, in Latin, as *fores*, gate, that is, by
the Queen's gate, and he quotes Thiers to show ("Hist. Révol. Fran." i.
309) that the Queen made sure of a secret gate out of the Tuileries, by
which they escaped. But Bouys takes it for the forest of Reines, which
is on the road to Varennes. *Deux pars* is husband and wife; *voltorte*,
or *vaultorte*, is a cross-road, or a divergent road; *vaulx*, a valley,
and *torte*, tortuous, says Le Pelletier. One does not quite see how to
educe cross road from this. Roquefort gives *volt* for face, and *torte*
would be turned, which seems to me more likely, However, it stands for
the road through St. Menehould, on the way to Montmédi. This, it seems,
they were forced into by posting arrangements. Prudhomme ("Revol. de
Paris," No. 102, p. 542) sets the divergence down to vacillation or
change of orders. If that be the correct statement, then my etymology of
*face about* for *vaultorte* fits it best. *Herne* is *Reine*, by
metaplasm of *h* for *i*. It was permissible in anagrammatic writing to
change one letter in a word, but not

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

more than one. The reader can refer for this to the "Dictionnaire de
Trévoux," under *Anagramme*. The white stone stands for this royal or
precious stone, the Queen, who was dressed in white. The King was
dressed in grey. Prudhomme, in the work mentioned above (p. 554), says
he wore a round hat, which hid his face, and had on an iron-grey coat
(*gris de fer*), so he appeared like a Carmelite.

There are nearly fourteen octavo pages of small print (p. 411) of De
Bouillé, which it might be well, to print, called "Details du voyage du
roi et de la reine à Montmédy et leur arrestation à Varennes dans le
Clairmontais, le 22 juin, 1791," full of interesting particulars.

VAULTORTE

"Mais on verra que les circonstances changèrent entièrement jusqu'au
moment de l'exécution de son projet; et ce qui était possible au mois de
janvier 1791, ne l'était plus au mois de juin."--"Mémoires du Marquis de
Bouillé," p. 195, ed. 1821.

"Il \[le roi\] m'informait qu'il partirait, avec sa famille, dans une
seule voiture qu'il ferait faire exprès. Dans la réponse que je fis au
roi, je pris la liberté de lui représenter encore une fois que la route
par Varennes offrait de grands inconvéniens, à cause des relais qu'il
fallait y placer pour suppléer à la poste. . . . J'engageai donc Sa
Majesté à prendre la route par Reims, ou celle de Flandre, en passant
par Chimay, et en traversant ensuite les Ardennes pour se rendre à
Montmédy. Je lui représentait les inconveniens de voyager avec la reine
et ses enfants, dans une seule voiture *faite exprès*, et qui serait
remarquée de tout le monde," etc.--"Mémoires du Marquis de Bouillé," p.
217.

This flight occurred on June 20, 1791. On the following day the National
Assembly suspended Louis XVI. from his functions. On the 1st of
September they passed another decree, that should the King surrender to
the will of the people and become a Constitutional King he might do so.
This he duly signed and attested on the 14th of the same month; so
*Capet fut esleu*. The title of King of the French instead of the King
of France, had been established since October

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 16, 1789
("Cyclopædia of Universal History"), which virtually was the same thing.
But yet strictly it was not until after the flight that he became *Esleu
Cap*. Madame Campan, in the "Mémoires de Marie-Antoinette," ii. 150,
relates that the Queen's hair had become white in a single night and she
had had a lock of her white hair mounted in a ring for the Princesse de
Lamballe, inscribed *Blanchis par le malheur*. She had become *la pierre
plus blanche encore*. Her dress was white, and her complexion too. The
*tranche* stands for the slice, or *couperet*, of the guillotine. Bouys
was amongst the first to explain this quatrain in print, and he says he
owed the explanation to M. de Vaudeuil, of Nevers, who has written upon
Nostradamus.

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 34. \[I. 177.\]

Le part <span id="fr_244"></span>[1](#fn_243.md) solus, <span
id="fr_245"></span>[2](#fn_244.md) Mary <span

Translation.

The husband alone afflicted will be mitred on his return. A conflict
will take place at the Tuileries by five hundred men. One traitor will
be titled--Narbon; and (the other) Saulce, grandfather oilman, will
\[hand him\] over to the soldiery.

The harness broke at Montmirail, and detained them two hours (p. 247).
The King showed himself at Chalons, and was recognized by the
postmaster, who held his tongue.

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Everything went
wrong owing to the change of date and loss of time on the road. At St.
Menehould he was recognized again, and Drouet the postmaster's son, rode
on to Varennes to betray him.

On the 15th of June the Marquis de Bouillé received a letter from the
King, saying his departure would be delayed till the 20th, at midnight;
that he could not take the Marquis d'Agoult, recommended to him by
Bouillé (as an "homme d'esprit, ferme et courageux, qui pent se montrer
si les circonstances l'exigalent," p. 217), because Madame de Tourzel,
the governess of the children, insisted on her right of place never to
quit them; and this consideration carried the decision. As if the King
could not have let them follow in another vehicle! Anything rather than
be forced to show himself on the road as he did (p. 256).

How it all miscarried will be best understood by reading the whole of De
Bouillé's account. His arrangements seem to have been masterly, like the
noble soldier and statesman that he was; the King's arrangements
vacillating, foolish, and even perverse. In this account Monsieur Saulce
is not seen at all.

This is to be filled in as follows. Louis XVI. alone, without his wife,
will suffer the disgrace of being crowned with the red cap of Liberty,
called the Phrygian bonnet or mitre, from its being the headdress of the
priests of Mithras. The five hundred Marseillais led the attack upon the
Tuileries, a palace begun by Catherine de Medici (1564) on the site of
the tile-kilns (*le thuille*), and not in existence when Nostradamus
wrote this (1555). The Count de Narbonne, Minister of War, was of the
noblesse, and Saulce, father, son, and grandson, were chandlers and
grocers, or oilmen, of Varennes. The father was *Procureur-syndic* of
his commune. These oilmen betrayed him to the populace, and he

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

was arrested *per custodes*. These sneaks stand as typical of
representative traitors of the two classes of *noblesse* and
*bourgoisie* paying cowardly court to the *prolétaire* class.

The Madame Campan before alluded to (ii. 158) relates that their
Majesties alighted at the grocery shop of the Mayor of Varennes, Saulce;
and he could have saved the King. The Queen was seated in the shop
between two high-piled stacks of candles, and was talking to Madame
Saulce.

The *Gazette Nationale*, June 25, 1791, reporting what took place in the
Assembly the night before, announces that M. Martinet, in addressing the
House, described Saulce's conduct as wise and *heroic*, replying as he
did to the promises and caresses of the King and Queen, "J'aime mon roi;
mais je resterai fidèle à ma patrie." The result of his heroism was that
two months later on the Assembly voted him twenty thousand livres as the
reward of his exalted *vertue citoyenne*. Whether, in the scramble that
so soon followed, he ever received the wasteful and ridiculous
Judas-gift there is nothing to show; but the bulletin recording the vote
of these new-fledged statesmen, liberal of money not their own, still
exists. We have here "*un Brute Français*," apeing the Roman, who loved
César well, but blood better.

Thiers' account of the attack upon the Tuileries, June 20, 1792 ("Révol.
Fran.," ii. 152), furnishes a pathetic picture of the afflicted King
(*marri mitré*) of the red nightcap, in which he was day-dreaming. The
palace was evacuated at about seven in the evening by the populace,
which had effected its entry by main force; but, when the crowd had Dow
withdrawn peaceably and in good order, the King, Queen, her sister, and
the children, all met together, shedding a torrent of tears. The King
seemed stunned by what had taken place; the red cap was still upon his
head;

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

he now, for the first time for several hours, noticed it, and flung it
aside with indignation.

As to the five hundred men named by our oracle, the historian of the
French Revolution again comes to our aid (ii. p. 209), saying that
Barbaroux had promised the Jacobins the co-operation of his Marseillais,
who were on the way to Paris. The project was to assemble at the
Tuileries and depose the king (ii. p. 235). They arrived on June 30,
1792, and were five hundred men. Ils étaient *cinq cents*.

Those who care to see how Narbonne acted against the King, can refer to
the "Histoire de la Révolution," by Bertrand de Molleville, for
satisfaction.

This stands out certainly as one of the most startling of all the
thousand quatrains of our strange seer. It will henceforth and to the
end of time speak for itself without comment, if we merely enumerate the
historic facts as here anticipated in four lines. The horror of the king
at finding himself *mitré*. The god Mithras is depicted on coins in this
very cap, and his priests made it their head-dress; further, it
furnishes the lively etymology of the word *mitre* itself. It was for
ages, before the French took it up, the received emblem of that frantic
crime that has been called *Liberty*. I will not say the result of this
is, as poetry, artistically beautiful; but, as a phrase of intense
expression, it is so terse that at a stroke, beyond that of hydraulic
power, it seems able to compress a truss of hay so as it may lie in a
husk of beechmast. I do say, nevertheless, that, thus regarded, Dante
and Shakespeare can hardly furnish between them three sentences of such
compressed force; the matter in it seems to be condensed to adamant.
*Mari sera mitré*, as it has been just explained, will be found, the
more profoundly it is thought upon, to be an original miracle in
phraseology. It is an actual and an awful prophecy in itself, but to
devise

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

a phrase to so convey the idea by human speech to the human mind of
another is miraculous. It may sleep for centuries, as this has done, for
lack of interpretation; but, when duly interpreted it cannot be
resisted; it storms the understanding; and, as a phrase, seems to be a
miracle begotten expressly to become the vehicle in which to convey
another miracle. This horror of the King mitred is one distinct
forecast. The second point is his return to Paris. There is, thirdly,
the conflict of the five hundred. Fourthly, the spot, the Tuileries,--at
Nostradamus' time, a thing of thin air, where the tiles were still
baking, fire-hot to roof houses with, whilst the pen was writing this.
Here again, if it is not poetry, it performs the poet's function, which
gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name. Fifthly, comes a
titled name-Narbonne. Sixthly, that of Saulce; and finally, the handing
over to the custodians. Here are seven distinct prophecies of events
historical: two of them, names of men yet to be born at a period two
hundred years removed. And, behold, these seven facts are put before you
in four lines!

There is a point of particular interest to be noted in. that first line.
Bouys (p. 62) remarks that, first line though it be, it should be the
last, as the mitre was the closing act of the entire drama; and he
supposes that Nostradamus wanted to make the treachery most prominent to
the mind of the reader. That is to talk like a chronologer. The first
cause and the final are, in spiritual matters, one. The life and death
of man are reduced to two points, and epitaphs give enough about most of
the lives of mortal men when they chronicle the birth and death dates.
"Alone he returned and was mitred." How, step by step, it all came about
*follows* necessarily; and that is how Nostradamus puts it to us. If he
had weighted himself with what science

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

calls method, he would have destroyed his own instinct; as science does,
just as Saturn ate up the offspring of his proper loins. The soul that
does this must grope to its results, but can never jump to them by
prophecy.

Before we go to the next quatrain it may be instructive to note
Garencières' treatment of the pregnant forecast we have just traversed.
He translates thus:

"The separated husband shall wear a mitre,  
Returning, battle, he shall go over the tyle,  
By five hundred one dignified shall be betrayed,  
Narbon and Salces shall have oil by the quintal."

"The verse signifieth, that some certain man who was married shall be
parted from his wife, and shall attain to some great ecclesiastical
dignity. The second verse is that, coming back from some place or
enterprise, he shall be met and fought with, and compelled to escape
over the tiles of a house. The third verse is that a man of great
account shall be betrayed by five hundred of his men. And the last that,
when these things shall come to pass, Narbon and Salces, which are two
cities of Languedoc, shall reap and make a great deal of oil."

This shows some skill, but what an unintelligible total we reach. I
merely set it down to prove to the sceptical, and those who incline to
class Nostradamus authoritatively amongst impostors whose jargon is not
worth the pains of interpreting, that they may look at this and learn
from it two facts: First, that before the event forecast has happened,
all the keys of interpretation are wanting, the prophecy looks like
jargon, and is so for all practical purposes; but that, secondly, once
it has happened, or as we may say kissed sunlight, the keys appear with
it, the light and the understanding awaken together. There is light in
potence or *in posse* now; but even then they will not unlock secrets,

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

if the keys remain in the hands of ignorant or scientific persons \[or
self-sufficient, which is nearly the same thing as scientific\], or in
the hands of romance-readers and lazy dullards. You will not unravel
"the words of the wise and their dark sayings" by reading a quatrain
once through. The interpreter must approach the work in a simple,
unprejudiced manner; he must get light from history how he can,--from
memoirs, letters, books,--and learn by the success and failure of past
commentators. He must be content to work very hard all the while, and
with little encouragement from others; and then at last he may so do
something, that even his neighbours may allow his work to be,--according
to the bent or waterpent of the particular mind of each,--some a
discovery, some a revelation. He himself may probably feel that a
supreme patience has had more to do with bringing the thing to pass than
any other faculty that could easily be named. Things of the spirit must,
of course, be spiritually discerned, and all talk about faculties when
the individual soul is treated of must sound a little paradoxical. To
divide the unique and indivisible unity of the soul into parts and
pieces, betrays in the proposer himself perhaps some "want of parts."
But from the earliest time until now, this has been the scientific way
of treating the human understanding; so let us consider that it is right
enough. The soul has almost always been cut into three, and then left to
wriggle and wriggle, and at last to join itself together again, as best
it can, like a worm in a garden. If this be according to Aristotle, let
all Sorbonne profess it for right. What does it matter how we treat
*one* thing, if only our method be perfectly scientific and in
accordance with all the rest of the universal phenomena, and with a
right interpretation of nature? What can it matter about the invisible,
if only our eyes know how to take account of

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

the things that are seen; that is, of the only things truly subject to
the cognizance of man?

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 92. \[Bouys, 64.\]

Le roi voudra en cité neufue entrer.  
Par ennemis expugner l'on viendra.  
Captif libère faux dire et perpétrer,  
Roi dehors estre, loin d'ennemis tiendra.

Translation.

The King would enter into the city.  
(By enemies expelled, France will obtain it \[or\] they will arrive
there;)  
It will be false to say and reiterate that the captive is free,  
\[And\] that the King who is out \[of Paris\] will keep aloof from
enemies

M. le Pelletier does not touch this quatrain. M. Bouys gives his
interpretation, which is not very convincing, and I thought of passing
it by altogether. But the *captif libère* so links it with the journey
to Varennes of the Royal family, that it seemed preferable to include
it, and leave it to the reader to reject or accept it, as he might think
fit. Another determining influence was from my noticing that the *cité
neuve*, or Montmédi, which the King desired to reach, was not French
when the quatrain was penned. The VIII., IX., and X. Centuries were not
published with the first seven, but were issued at Lyons from the same
press, namely that of Pierre Rigaud. Moreri states that Nostradamus felt
encouraged by the reception accorded to the seven Centuries to publish
three more (*i.e.* VIII., IX., and X.), in 1558. There is a copy now in
the Bibliothèque Royale, to which the authorities give the date of 1558.
Pierre Rigaud's name appears on the title, but no date, which is
remarkable, as the first volume of 1555 has this imprint: "*Ce present
livre a été achevé d'imprimer le IIII<sup>e</sup> lour de may MDLV*,"
giving a date as if for a nativity. M. le Pelletier demurs to the
accuracy of the pretended date, and thinks it must belong to

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

the edition of 1566, by Pierre Rigaud. if so, these three Centuries
scarcely appeared in the lifetime of Nostradamus, though they are
dedicated to his patron, Henry II.,--who died in 1559,--in an elaborate
and interesting epistle dedicatory. In opening this, Nostradamus says he
has long been in doubt as to whom he should devote (*consacrer*) these
three Centuries, but at last took courage to lay it at the feet of
royalty. Now, the edition of 1566 particularly states that the
prophecies *n'ont encore jamais esté imprimées*. One cannot read the
Dedicatory Epistle without feeling sure it was written for the eye of
the King, and therefore at least as early as 1558, but probably earlier
by a year or two. I therefore assume that he presented them to the King
in a fair manuscript, and that having done that he remained content, and
that the family at his death, finding the original manuscript, put it in
Rigaud's hands to be printed.

My reason for thus inquiring into the dates is this: that the
investigation makes it extremely likely the above quatrain was written
before 1557, the year in which Montmédi was taken by France, and, if so,
it explains the line that I have thrown into a parenthesis in a manner
in which it has never been interpreted before. *Expugner* is not French
now; *expugnable* is all that now remains of it in the language. So that

Par ennemis expugner l'on viendra

may, I think, be regarded as a parenthetic explanation referring to the
*cité neuve*, which was not yet French territory, though on the point of
becoming so,--*l'on viendra par ennemies expugner*, by expulsion of the
enemy, in 1557. If this rendering be thought valid, it furnishes one
reason the more for explaining this quatrain as one of the series
belonging to the Revolutionary epoch, and one more re deemed from the
maze of Nostradamus.

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

It would appear from Bouys, though he does not produce his historical
authorities, that immediately the King escaped, France was flooded with
announcements that the captive was free, and had their consent to hold
himself aloof--*loin d'ennemis tiendra*. If this be established, it
becomes certain that we can in the main determine this quatrain
accurately. ("Histoire de la Révolution, par deux amis de la Liberté,"
in 7 vols., vol. vii. p. 126.)

Century VIII.--*Quatrain* 87. \[I. 179.\]

Mort conspirée viendra en plein effect,  
Charge donnée et voyage de mort:  
Esleu, créé, receu par siens, deffait.

Death hatched by treason will take its full effect,  
A charge imposed, voyage made to death.  
Elected, created, received by his own, and undone by them.  
The blood of Innocency (rises) before them in remorse (eternal).

Bouys thinks by the last line Nostradamus intended to convey, that the
King felt poignant grief at the innocent victims his overthrow would
leave without protection to the tender mercies of the States-General.
The other is better, connecting it, as it does, with that case
analogous, where the mob cursed themselves out of their own mouth, and
said "His blood be upon us, and on our children" (Matt. xxvii. 25).

This is a picture to the life of the fat-making King Louis Seize. The
brush of a Velasquez, as it cannot paint the moral, could hardly so well
place him before the eye, as in life. He is no picture well-framed,
hanging for inspection in a gallery of pictures, but flesh and blood
like one's self alive, and moving with us in the gallery a spectator and
observer like ourselves. We have here Louis XVI. before us in the flesh.

His temper was ungovernable and sudden, extending even to rough bathos,
but was soon over. Maurepas always said, you must let the King have his
first fling of humour out, and then he will soon recover. Secondly, his
negligence let everything drift, finance included, till ruin brought
collapse. You might think his economists had drawn their singular axiom
for statesmenship, *Laissez faire*, from the example of their royal
master. He fell at once into the intrigue of the diamond necklace
belonging to Marie Antoinette, which was conveyed by the Countess of La
Motte to the Cardinal de Rohan. Report runs that he even placed his wife
under arrest in her own chamber for several days. "Lui mis à mort par sa
bénévolence" displays a most wonderful forecast, and it is open to read
it now LOUIS *mis à mort*.

Translation.

The prince of very comely beauty (shall be)  
Led to the head, and then betrayed to a second (place).  
The city of the sword, with powder-torch, burns  
The head of the King, hated on account of his illegal murder.

The edition of 1558 gives the reading as above, but the line does not
scan; it wants two syllables. Bouys, without comment, reads Prince sera;
Le Pelletier understands *menée* 

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

as a synonym for *intrigues*. But I should read it rather as a misprint
for méné. The city of the sword is a graphic name for Paris, where the
guillotine was first erected on September 25, 1792, having been
perfected by Guillotin, the doctor, whose name was given to it.
Roquefort gives the word *adusté* as *brûlé*; but Nostradamus uses it as
a verb, *aduster*, in the third person of the present indicative. Paris
burnt the king's head with a powder-torch, or burning powder, that is to
say with quicklime; and, as having done him wrong, the people hate him,
and wish to obliterate the traces of the murder perpetrated.

The body and head of the King were placed in a basket of wicker-work,
and carried, according to De Montgaillard ("Histoire de France," iii. p.
415. janvier, 1793 <span id="fr_260"></span>[1](#fn_259).md) to the
cemetery of the Madeleine, and thrown into a trench twelve feet deep,
which had been spread with quicklime; more was thrown in upon the top of
the body, so that decomposition would follow instantly. When the grave
was reopened some twenty-four years after, to bestow a more decent
burial on the relics, nothing remained but a few fragments of calcined
bone.

Garencières reads *Princesse de beauté tant venuste*, which will not
scan any better than the line of the edition of 1558; but he translates
*au chef menée*, I find, as "shall be brought to the general," and the
feminine termination is then right. This helps to confirm my rendering
above. His annotation says that the only difficulty about the quatrain
is as to what city is meant. As, however, he suggests no historical
allusion whatever, he leaves every difficulty unsolved.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

I think that most readers will be inclined to allow that this is a very
extraordinary forecast, and that *La cité au glaive* as a name for
Paris, and what has been perpetrated there, is both poetic and terrific
in a very high degree--a sobriquet that, once heard, is likely to cling
in the memory for ever. To devise epithets of this simplicity and force
constitutes an author at once master of utterance; no matter what may be
the shortcomings of the adjacent text. But, when you find these
startling felicities perpetually recurring to illustrate facts
historical,--facts that will not come into mortal ken for centuries
after the death of the writer,--stiff, indeed, must be the reader's neck
if he cannot bow it a little, as to a man of God passing by; or, if he
would rather have it so, to the occasional divinity shining through
man's nature, that will not, cannot wholly die when death has done its
worst. From Hecla to the tropics all rational creatures should rejoice
at such a fact. What is the new world of Columbus to this? Why, nothing
but a new hemisphere of dirt. A spirit, that can read time future, must
be a spirit whose habitation is Eternity. It is this hope kindles as we
decipher, in the stillness of night, rune upon strange rune of the
oracular sage of Salon.

Translation.

The stranger Queen, seeing her daughter fading

The Princess did marry the Duc d'Angoulême in 1799, but there was no
issue,--*mariage forclos*. The Queen wished to marry her daughter to a
German Prince: hence all the grief. The Abbé Torné-Chavigny ('L'Histoire
prédite et jugée par Nostradamus," ii. 28) had the merit, M. le
Pelletier says, of this learned interpretation. I cannot quite see this,
as M. Bouys gave the same interpretation as far back as 1806, though
with a particularity a little less minute. The prophecy thus unravelled
is the more wonderful, as the event seems so little worth recording.
There is the same exactitude and precision shown as where a kingdom is
at stake.

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 77. \[I. 185.\]

Le regne prins <span id="fr_262"></span>[1](#fn_261.md) le Roy convicra,

La vie a Royne fils on desniera,

Pierre Rigaud's edition reads *conjurera* for *convicra*, and that, at
least, makes the line scan, which *convicra* does not. Bouys says that
some ancient editions read *conviera*, *commitari per viam*, and then it
would mean to arrange the funeral cortège of the King. I think
*conjurera* the best reading, for that might be taken to mean that they
condemned the King by jurors, or jury, as the Queen was in the next
line.

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

Translation.

The assembly will condemn the King taken,  
\[And\] the Queen taken to death by jurors sworn by lot;  
They will deny life to the Dauphin (*à Royne fils*),  
And the prostitute at the fort will partake of the same fate.

Upon the word *jurés*, in the second line, M. le Pelletier remarks that
the Convention, erecting itself into a supreme court of justice,
proceeded to condemn the King to death. But the judgment upon
Marie-Antoinette was passed by the *Tribunal révolutionnaire*, newly set
up, which proceeded by jurors chosen by lot, *jurés à sort*. He further
says that this jury is an institution borrowed from England, and he
erroneously fancies that it had been first introduced into England at
the Revolution, and had no existence there, even by name, during the
lifetime of Nostradamus. This shows how little a Frenchman, when even
well read, cares about English institutions. Pettingal almost proves
that the Roman *judices*, and Greek δικασταί were jurors. There has been
great and profitless dispute, as to whether the Anglo-Saxons had juries,
or whether they came in at the Conquest. If they did it would be
strange, for they died out in Normandy. If the practice be Roman, it
would have prevailed in England as in Normandy, both having been under
Roman law forms. Coke, Blackstone, and many others, confidently maintain
its existence here prior to the Conquest. If Anglo-Saxon it would still
be Roman. Were it Scandinavian in origin, or were it Teutonic, it would
equally have prevailed here before the Conquest. So that the whole
discussion has an interest merely archæological; and leaves the trial by
jury, no matter what its origin, a thing of immemorial usage in these
islands. You might as well try, by chemical analysis, to ascertain when
oxygen first entered as a component part into the air men breathe. If
you could settle the question it would be no use; whilst the time lost
in discussing

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

it might otherwise be well employed. But the forensic usage was not so
in France itself, as modern Frenchmen think, for in old Glossaries, like
Roquefort's, you find *jurie*, not *jurée*: "Assise où l'on prononce sur
le rapport des jurés."

They delivered the poor Dauphin to the *cordonnier* Simon, with orders
to let him die slowly. The inhuman villains seem to have felt they could
not condemn a child to public execution; so they give orders to a
murderer to make away with him by ill usage and starvation, a process
that would have rendered the guillotine welcome and a boon.

The last line admits of three interpretations. M. le Pelletier takes the
*pellix* to stand for the National Convention itself, saying that it had
prostituted justice in condemning an innocent prince over whom it had no
jurisdiction. But clearly it had no jurisdiction over the King or Queen.
He then takes the fort to be the *Conciergerie*, to which it consigned
its own members, *consorts*, as an introduction to the scaffold. This is
very striking, but the quatrain does not appear to me to threaten
members of the Assembly at all. The unity of conception is best
maintained by limiting its meaning to the fate of Royalty; and Bouys
places an excellent and forcible interpretation upon it without breaking
the unity of purpose. He says that it relates to the Dubarri, the King's
courtesan, and that the fort is her palace of Luciennes, which had
anciently been a strong place or fort. This is good, if the Chateau de
Luciennes bears it out; but the *fort* may so easily be *sort* with the
old *s* type, which is scarcely distinguishable from an *f*, that I
think we might very well substitute it. We should then construe the last
line

"And \[consign\] the prostitute to the fate of the Queen consort."

This interpretation requires less force to be employed upon the line,
and less explanation than any of the others.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

The forms of the *s* and ƒ are nearly identical. The reading that brings
simplicity with it, and removes stumbling-blocks out of the way, usually
proves the safest and the best. Here we remove the complication
introduced by the word fort, which otherwise requires explanation, and
it runs: *The courtesan shares a like fate with the Queen*. It is now
for the reader to select the best.

Sixaine 55. \[I. 186.}

Un peu devant ou après très-grand' dame,  
Son ame au ciel, et son corps soubs la lame,  
De plusieurs gens regrettée sera,  
Tous ses parens seront en grand' tristesse,  
Pleurs et souspirs d'une dame en jeunesse,  
Et à deux Grands la deuil delaissera.

Translation.

A little before or after a very great lady,  
The soul \[of Madame Elizabeth shall rise\] to heaven, her body under
the blade,  
She will be grieved for by many persons;  
All her family connections will be cast into deep sorrow,  
One lady very young \[Duchesse d'Angoulême will shed\] tears and
sighs,  
And two great ones will be depressed with mourning.

This can be mistaken for no one but Madame Elizabeth, the sister of
Louis XVI., her niece, the Duchess d'Angoulême, and the two brothers of
Madame Elizabeth, the count of Provence and the Count of Artois. This is
not one of the very striking stanzas, but the forecast is still notable,
and occupies its position very well as one in a considerable series.

Translation.

The belly cut shall spring again with two heads  
And four arms: *Aquiloye* shall live several years,  
In great force (*entiers*) what (*jour qui*) time he holds.  
Fossen, Turin, Ferrara shall fall under his domination (*suivra chef*).

This is a very crabbed, but very wonderful quatrain.

The elder branch of the Bourbons was cut short in the person of
Marie-Antoinette (*le ventre tranchée*); shall spring up again in two
heads, Louis XVIII. and Charles X. The two heads being crowned, the four
lesser princes are called arms and uncrowned. They are counted thus: The
Duc de Normandy, who died in the Temple, June 8,1795; the Due de Berri,
assassinated January 13, 1820; the Duc d'Angoulême; and the Duc de
Bordeaux, exiled August 16, 1830, who, though he had so many close
chances, died without the crown,--an arm only, not a head, a hand
tenaciously to the last holding to its white handkerchief as a flag.
Zurich and Fossano stand, by synecdoche, for Piedmont, and Ferrara for
the Papal States.

This brings us to the end of the Louis Seize series. Let us, before
passing on to a fresh series, just give a glance at the ground we have
traversed; and endeavour to estimate the value of the historical facts
prefigured for us by Nostradamus in his book more than two hundred years
before the earliest of them began to take effect upon the stage of
actuality.

First, we beheld a section of the nation, the third estate, usurping the
sole authority of government, and bringing down upon the whole the
desolation that was witnessed in Europe in 1789. Then the intriguing Duc
d'Orleans was portrayed, and the poor King was seen repenting that he
had not, when insulted by him, publicly punished him by death. The next
picture was that of the remarkable flight

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

to Varennes, in which the very travelling habits of the King and Queen,
to their respective colours even, were minutely given, and the precise
name hinted of the fallen Capet on the road,--fallen, though elected by
the people, *esleu cap*. At the very last moment we are told their
destination was changed by the King, where changing meant his destiny.
He was then depicted as betrayed. He had run into the jaws of death, and
the very names of the traitors, Narbonne and Saulce, were given; with
the further detail, that he was taken back to Paris and mitred with the
Phrygian cap, in the desecrated Tuileries, at the dictation of five
hundred Marseillais. In another quatrain that journey is called a voyage
of death, and in one line is laid before us all that happened to Louis
the Unfortunate. He is elected, created king, received by his own
people, and undone. To this succeeds that extraordinary picture of the
King himself: his best friend could scarcely have portrayed the man so
truly to us. Too prosperous at the outset, too good-natured a royalty,
sudden in temper, yet dilatory in act, making and unmaking ministries
quarterly, and finally done to death by his own benevolence. We then
have a stanza devoted to him. We see him as a beautiful youth made
chief, then deposed, and his head rolling from the scaffold in the City
of the Glave, even to his burial in quicklime at the Madelaine, a
procedure so unheard of in the case of kings. Then that curious
reference to *La Royne Ergaste* and the little incident touching her
daughter's marriage to D'Angoulême. Then follows the Queen's death,
brought about by a jury, a novelty imported from England by the
innovators of that period; crowned by cruelty to the Dauphin. There
follows a more or less curious sixaine, conveying the fate of Madame
Elizabeth, the King's sister; till we close with a brilliant quatrain
that exhibits, in a symbolical fashion, the Napoleonic

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

interregnum, when the severed Bourbon race puts out again its last two
crowns, above the Eagle-law or *Alquiloye*,--probably the last
appearance it will ever make upon the stage of history. I think we may
agree, that it would not be easy to parallel such a series of verified
forecasts relating to the most striking historical incidents, that bear
upon a single reign, from any one book existing in the world.
