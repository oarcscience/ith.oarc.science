# Louis XVIII and Louis Philippe

WE now come to the Restoration of Louis XVIII.

This is a very crabbed quatrain.

Translation.

The King is saluted victor and dominator,  
The oath falsified: The King makes himself known again:  
Grandson of Louis XIV. becomes King,  
Is called back by the proud people humiliated to tears.

Louis XVIII. is proclaimed King, May 3, 1814, but the people take up
Napoleon from Elba, March 1, 1815, thus breaking faith. Louis XVIII. (Le
Royal) is again recognized, July 8, 1815; the grandson of Louis XIV.
(sang Æmathien), a name conferred by Nostradamus on Louis

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> XIV., who assumed
the emblem of the Sun, Æmathien being son of Aurora, who opens the gates
of the morning sun. This grandson becomes now undisputed King, the
humiliated French nation recalling him with tears.

Century X.--*Quatrain* 16. \[I. 236.\]

Heureux au regne de France, heureux de vie,  
Ignorant sang, mort fureur et rapine,  
Par nom flateur <span id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_391.md) sera mis en
envie:  
Roy desrobé, <span id="fr_393"></span>[2](#fn_392.md) trop de foye en
cuisine.

Translation.

Happy in the kingdom of France, happy in life,  
Free from blood, violent death and angry rapine,  
He will have a flattering name, and be an object of desire:  
A King retired, with too much faith in the kitchen.

Here we are to take Louis XVIII. as restored to the throne of France:
his life passes happily, without violent experiences of blood, death,
rage, or rapine. The flattering name was given to him of *Desiré* that
is prophetically hinted in the words "*il sera mis en envie*." He will
not devote sufficient attention to his public duties, so that he may be
described as *desrobé*, retired or retained at home; and he will be too
much addicted to enjoyments of the table,--*trop defoye en cuisine*. The
gastronomy was proverbial; the obesity consequent upon it made him grow
inert, so that he gradually let the affairs of State drift without
giving them due attention.

Century III.--*Quatrain* 96. \[I. 238.\]

Chef de Fossan <span id="fr_394"></span>[3](#fn_393.md) aura gorge

Translation.

A prince of Fossano shall have his throat cut  
By the keeper of his hounds and greyhounds:  
The attempt will be made by those of the Tarpeian rock,  
Saturn being in Leo on 13th February.

Fossana is put, by synecdoche, for Sardinia. A prince, therefore, of
Sardinia shall be stabbed by the Keeper of the Kennel, instigated by
Republicans, when Saturn is in opposition to the sign of the Lion, on
February 13, 1820. M. le Pelletier, who seems somewhat learned in the
houses of the stars, says that Saturn was in opposition to, and not in
conjunction with, Leo on this occasion. But Nostradamus leaves it open.
The Tarpeian rock is figuratively employed to signify the *Mountain*, or
the demagogues and the Republicans generally. The Mons Tarpeius was
first named from murder, and was for ages a scene of murder. Tarpeia,
who betrayed the Capitol to the Sabines, was crushed by their shields at
the gate, and her father, Spurius Tarpeius, was thrown over the
battlements by order of Romulus. Children ill-formed at birth were flung
from its heights. It was better known as Capitolinus, so called (*caput
Toli*) from the head of Tolus, found there when digging foundations for
the Temple of Jupiter: thus the place of the skull, a Golgotha from the
beginning of Rome. Later on criminals were sentenced to be thrown from
it. Many of these deadly associations were, no doubt, present to the
mind of Nostradamus, and made this mountain of death seem to him fit to
foreshadow the death that should emanate from the French

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

mountain. To dwell upon this is of physiological interest, as showing
how very closely the natures of the poet and the prophet overlap each
other; so that, as in the rainbow colours, there is no line to be drawn
as to where one begins or another ends:--they may be seen, but not
severed.

The Duc de Berri was the son of Marie Therèse of Savoy, married to the
Comte d'Artois, she being the daughter of Victor-Amédée III., King of
Sardinia. This Sardinian was to have ruled France, and, with but one
intervening, to have followed the Corsican in the occupation of the
throne. Louvel, the murderer, stabbed him coming from the opera, and
wore the King's livery at the moment of the attempt. The forecast is
again wonderful in prefiguring every particular short of the names of
the two individuals. The nationalities are given, the calling of Louvel,
and the day of the month. If all this be Chance, some hare-brained few
would prefer it to what they know of Certainty.

Century V.--*Quatrain* 4. \[I. 240.\]

Le gros mastin de cité dechassé, <span id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_398.md)

defiance.

Translation.

The great mastiff chased from the city  
Will be afflicted by the strange alliance:  
When the stag is driven to the fields,  
The wolf and bear will commence to mistrust each other.

The Duc de Bordeaux is the great mastiff, dethroned August 9, 1830, by
Louis Philippe, in the dog-days, when the star *Sirius* is in
opposition. *Le Grand Chien* burning in

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

the horizon is a synonym for the *gros mastin*; the city, of course, is
Paris. Charles X., who was fond of the chase, is turned from the great
huntsman to the stag. The wolf is Louis Philippe, a name which lends
itself to Lou. P. The bear represents, according to M. le Pelletier, *la
Montagne*, in the assembly, because bears make their lair in the highest
situations. We need not insist on this resemblance or characteristic
pointed out by Le Pelletier.

There are six quatrains devoted by Le Pelletier to the Duc de
Bordeaux,--the Henri Cinq that was never to be,--that Royal Prince whom
all the Princes should see to be heaven-descended. But as we, who are
not royal, have seen that nothing came of him; and that, being now dead,
nothing can come of him, we shall pass over the six quatrains in
silence. The quatrains of Nostradamus lend themselves most kindly to
elucidation once you find the clue, but they most persistently refuse to
have a meaning read into them from without.

M. le Pelletier has elaborated the meaning of the six quatrains, about
Louis Philippe with so much ingenious learning that we must give the
whole of them, and let the reader take them at his own valuation.

Century VI.--*Quatrain* 84.

Celuy qu'en <span id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_402.md) Sparte Claude <span
id="fr_404"></span>[2](#fn_403.md) ne peut regner,  
Il fera tant par voye seductive,  
Que du court, long le fera araigner, <span
id="fr_405"></span>[3](#fn_404.md)  
Que contre Roy fera sa perspective. <span
id="fr_406"></span>[4](#fn_405.md)

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

Translation.

He who will cause that the lame cannot reign in Paris, <span
id="fr_407"></span>[1](#fn_406.md)  
He will effect so much in his seductive way  
That from the short to long he will attain,  
Who has brought to bear his deception against the King.

The meaning of this is that Louis Philippe d'Orléans will cause the Duc
de Bordeaux to be unable to hold the reins of government in Paris. The
anagrammatic substitution of Sparte for Paris is doubly ingenious,
inasmuch as Lycurgus at Sparta established a double kingship so-called.
Of course the office could not be that of king at all, but there was the
name if not the fact, and that suffices for this prince of dexterous
analogists, Nostradamus. Louis Philippe will achieve this by the byeways
of seduction, and will usurp successfully his nephew's throne
(araigner), putting himself in opposition, says Le Pelletier, to his
lawful King. *Faire sa perspective* he renders opposition. I do not
think this is the meaning of the phrase. There is an extract from
Fontenelle (I cannot refer to it in his works at present), in which he
speaks of a perspective that will make an emperor or a beggar out of the
same figure, according to the point of view from which you regard it.
That is an optical illusion. Descartes, in his "L'Homme," mentions the
pictures placed at the end of corridors to cheat the eye agreeably, and
adds, "L'exemple des tableaux de perspective montre combien il est
facile de s'y tromper." And then there were those perspectives that
Holbein and his contemporaries used to introduce into their pictures, of
a skull, or death's head, so painted that you could not quite tell what
it was till you reached the right point of view, when it would suddenly
contract and draw its elongated self together to a true skull

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

by a process the reverse of foreshortening. By the words *sa
perspective*, I conceive that Nostradamus meant that Louis Philippe
brought his deception to bear against the King.

Century V.--*Quatrain* 69. \[I. 250.\]

Plus ne sera le Grand en faux sommeil,  
L'inquietude viendra prendre repos:  
Dresser phalange <span id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_407.md) d'or, azur, et
vermeil,  
Subjuger Afrique, la ronger jusques os.

Translation.

Le Grand will pretend no longer a false sleep;  
His disquietude will now lull itself in security,  
Arrange his army under gold, blue, and red,  
Subjugate Africa, gnawing it to the very bone.

 

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

Louis Philippe, now King, and so become le Grand, says M. le Pelletier
(though, as applied to the individual, it looks quite like a misnomer),
will now unmask his designs, and take his repose in security. He will
adopt the tricolour of the Revolution and complete the conquest of
Algeria; Pelissier roasting the refugees in caves, to the very bone.
Everything but the word Grand justifies the interpretation to a nicety.

Century I.--*Quatrain* 39. \[I. 251.\]

De nuict dans lict le supresme <span id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_408.md)

Translation.

When France shall be dominated by three parties,  
The last of the family shall be strangled at night in bed,  
For having lent too much to the fair Capet.  
Put to death because a paper and packet were not read.

When France is dominated by three alternately (Orleanists, Republicans,
Bonapartists), the Prince de Bourbon, Condé, last of his race, shall be
strangled, at night in his bed, for desiring to follow in the suite of
the Duc de Bordeaux. A new will, duly sealed up, in favor of the
Bourbon, but not read, is the cause of his death. The "not read" means,
not read by the Duc de Bordeaux, in whose favour it was drawn. The
Baronne de Feuchères, whose interests were allied to those of Louis
Philippe, defeated this by the murder. M. le Pelletier acquits Louis
Philippe of complicity in the crime, but he remarks that the interest of
the baronne

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

was incidentally that of the King. Her crime was incited by the desire
to do away with the new will, by which she would be a heavy loser. It is
curious that Garencières considers this quatrain to have been fulfilled
in Philip II. of Spain, who had his own son, Don Carlos, strangled in
bed. The coincidence of the name Philip is singular, but the remaining
two lines he does not attempt to interpret.

Century VIII.--*Quatrain* 42. \[I. 253.\]

Par avarice, par force et violence  
Viendra vexer les siens chef d'Orleans;  
Près Sainct Memire <span id="fr_415"></span>[1](#fn_414.md) assaut et
resistance,  
Mort dans sa tante, <span id="fr_416"></span>[2](#fn_415.md) diront qu'il
dort leans. <span id="fr_417"></span>[3](#fn_416.md)

Translation.

By cupidity and abuse of power, force, and violence,  
The chief of Orleans will come to vex his own;  
Near St. Memire resistance will be made;  
Dead in his palace he will ever after sleep.

Avarice was always the fault of Louis Philippe. By extortion and abuse
he raised resistance at Saint Meri; in and near the church he forced the
republicans to submission, *dort leans* a play upon the name, never
again showed energy, but slept a sleep as of death in his palace (*dans
sa tente*). The insurrection that was quelled took place on June 5 and
6, 1832.

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 89. \[I. 254.\]

Sept ans sera Philipp; fortune prospere:  
Rabaissera des Arabes effort;  
Puis son midy perplex <span id="fr_418"></span>[4](#fn_417.md) rebors <span
id="fr_419"></span>[5](#fn_418.md) affaire,  
Jeune Ognion <span id="fr_420"></span>[6](#fn_419.md) abismera son fort.

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

Translation.

Seven years will Philip's fortune prosper well;  
He will defeat every effort of the Arabs;  
In his embarrassed middle period all goes against the grain,  
Young Ogmion will overwhelm his fort.

Fortune will favour Louis Philippe for the first seven years. He will
repress the Arabs. But in the middle of his reign the Eastern question
will spring up, and cover him with disgrace (this culminated July 15,
1840). For the next seven years all will go against the grain, and the
new Republic (*jeune Ogmion*) will overturn his throne and his Bastille;
the Paris he thought he had so strongly fortified.

Garencières again introduces Philip II. of Spain, and there seems to
exist some analogy between these two kings. The Spaniard also was
prosperous for some seven years, and in the person of his brother, Don
Juan of Austria, beat the Turks in the Battle of Lepanto. Garencières
reads *Barbares* for Arabs. Later on he had to put his son to death, and
was opposed by young Ogmion; the King, Henri Quatre, of France and
Navarre.

Century V.--*Quatrain* 92. \[I. 255.\]

Après le siege tenu dix-sept ans,  
Cinq changeront en tel revolu terme:  
Puis sera l'un esleu de mesme temps,  
Qui les Romains ne sera trop conforme.

Translation.

After the throne has been held for seventeen years,  
Five shall change when that term has run out:  
Then, at the same time, one shall be elected,  
Who will not be very conformable to the wishes of the Romanists.

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

After the reign of Louis Philippe, during seventeen years, five of his
sons lost the throne with himself; and with much manœuvring have never
been able to reapproach it. They were the Comte de Paris, representative
of Chartres, Duc de Nemours, Joinville, Montpensier, and Due d'Aumale.
The election that followed was that of Louis Napoleon, whose mixed, or
no policy, suited neither the Revolutionary party nor the Roman
Catholics. There is nothing here but the seventeen years to connect this
with Louis Philippe. For the five who changed with the revolt would be
six if Louis Philippe himself were counted, and he certainly ought to
be. The concluding two lines are very vague, and may or may not belong
to Louis Napoleon. I merely cite it, as one of the ingenuities of M. le
Pelletier.

There are three prophecies cited relating to the Due de Chartres, which
seem fairly well interpreted; and very wonderful they would be if they
stood alone or related to any one whose fate was of any importance in
the opening scroll of history. All the little interest of Louis Philippe
is centred in himself, and therefore I omit the three quatrains relating
to his son, not because they are not curious, if rightly interpreted of
the son, but that, even supposing them to be so, the Due de Chartres is
a person and a character not deserving of serious mention in history.
The gossip of a barber's shop in Nostradamus's own day would be even
more interesting to any rational investigator of human affairs.

dexterity, to show to be the Due de Bordeaux.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[287:3](oon20.htm#fr_405.md) This whole line is
difficult. *Araigner*, in the Romance language, is said to mean to plead
and gain a cause against another. The *court* and *long* we had before,
in Century VIII., 57, applied to Napoleon, as rising from a soldier to
the long-robed Emperor; here he had to refer to Talma to teach him how
to carry it. Now, again, it means the rise from a mere dignitary to
Kingship.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[287:4](oon20.htm#fr_406.md) Latin, *qui*.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[288:1](oon20.htm#fr_407.md) *Sparte* = Paris. The
letters *te* may be considered as one letter, the v being mute. It will
then convert, according to the rule of the anagram.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[289:1](oon20.htm#fr_408.md) Phalange, flag,
standard, writes M. le Pelletier. As far as I can discover anything,
this statement appears to be entirely erroneous. The word "phalanx," as
connected with matters military, always signifies a body of men in
military order. It may in the plural even stand indefinitely for armies.
In the singular it is very confusing. It may stand for a party of
twenty-eight men or eight thousand (Potter's "Antiquities," ii. 56).
Danet says six thousand men. Gibbon introduces one of his constantly
recurring slovenly phrases about it,--absurd in fact, but philosophic in
form. He is comparing the legion with the phalanx (i. 22), and tells us,
"It was soon discovered by reflection, as well as by the event," that it
could not contend with the legion. It is obvious here, that if it had
been discovered by reflection it would never have been tried by the
event. This somewhat justifies the sarcasm of Porson, that schoolboys
ought to be set to translate Gibbon into English. As a pleasing variety,
Smith sets the number when complete at about sixteen thousand men. One
feels inclined to say that these classical guides are conveying us to
that ditch, which is never far to seek, when the blind are leading the
blind. Martinius, in his curious "Lex. Phil.," cites Pliny to show that
the Africans first fought the Egyptians *fustibus*, with staves, which
they called *phalanges* in the plural, or *phalanx* in the singular, so
that it is an African word. ‏ו ף?L?G‎, in Hebrew *phalag*, is a staff.
Also there is a spider called *phalangion*; and as the pikes of the
first five ranks in a *phalanx* were interlaced, they were somewhat like
a web of staves. Many may regard all this as extremely useless; perhaps
they will concede that it is curious; if so, I shall consider it to be
useful. I have long found that whatever is very curious is useful. It
sets the mind agreeably in movement, and often throws a new light on
things that previously had no interest and seemed obscure. At any rate,
we have now established that *phalange* is not to be rendered
*standard*, but troops, army.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[290:1](oon20.htm#fr_409.md) Latin, *supremus*,
the last.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[290:2](oon20.htm#fr_410.md) The order is, "Quand
l'Empire sera exanclé par trois subrogés."

<span id="fn_410"></span>[290:3](oon20.htm#fr_411.md) Latin, *subrogatus*,
substituted; read *subrogés*.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[290:4](oon20.htm#fr_412.md) *Exancillatus*,
subdued to, under the yoke of.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[291:1](oon20.htm#fr_415.md) *Sainct Memire* is
the anagram of S'Meri. To make this pass, M. le Pelletier drops one *m*
and one *e*.

*à rebours* is against the grain.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[291:6](oon20.htm#fr_420.md) *Ognion* is *Ogmius*,
the Celtic Mercury or Gallic Hercules. It has <span id="page_292">p.
292</span> figured in 1792, 1848, and again after the German war, 872.
At the two first periods they put the figure of this Hercules on their
five franc pieces, with that idle exergue, Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité.
This vocable, *Ogmion*, is equivalent to *Oignon*, onion, or bulbous
root of the lily. If there could be any doubt at all about this,
Nostradamus has taken care to remove it, calling it *le grand mercure
d'Hercule fleur de lys*, in Century X. 79.
