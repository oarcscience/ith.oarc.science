# Oracles of Nostradamus

### Life of Nostradamus

"In Nature's infinite book of secrecy  
A little I can read."

Antony and Cleopatra, i. 2.

"I am Isaiah,--be it spoken with all humility,--to the advancement of
God's glory."--Luther's *Table Talk*, Bohn, p. 12.

Yes, indeed, Luther, with quite Lutheran humility!

"Canys gwn a fydd rhag llaw."  
"For I know what has been, and will be hereafter."

TALIESSIN.

"Prophetia est solum futurorum contingentium, quia longe distant ab
humana cognitione; sed secundario ad eam pertinent præterita et
præsentia."--ST. THO. AQUINATIS, *Summa*, p. 409.

MICHEL DE NOSTREDAME was born in Provence, in the town of St. Remy, in
the year 1503, upon a Thursday, the 14th of December, about noon. Tycho
Brahe (1546), D'Herbelot (1625) the great Orientalist, and Bruce (1730)
the Abyssinian traveller, were all born on the same day of the month.
Coincidences such as these are, perhaps, not worth much; yet, do they
interest us less than the rainfall of a month, or the precise pressure
of the wind on Cleopatra's needle?--which goes by the name of Cleopatra
because Cleopatra had nothing whatever to do with it. Robert Étienne,
the great printer, was also born in 1503. What would, however, more have
affected the family of Nostradamus is the expulsion of the French from
Naples on October 31, 1503, after the famous battles in April, fought on
two consecutive Fridays with disaster to the French; the battles namely,
of Seminara and Cerignola. Many have said that the evil omen attaching
to Friday dates from that period. If we had never heard of Good Friday
we also might have been of their opinion.

His father, like Milton's, a notary, was James Nostradamus, a name which
is equivalent to *de Nôtre Dame*. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Moreri calls his
family "*une famille noble*;" <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) others
say that he was of Jewish descent, but of a family that had been
converted to Christianity, and that he claimed to be of the tribe of
Issachar, deriving thence his gift of prophecy, for they were "men that
had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do" (I
Chron. xii. 32); or, as in Esther i. 13, "the seven wise men that knew
the times." It is true that but few of the orthodox commentators
interpret these passages as signifying astrological or prophetic
forecast; but that may be, nevertheless, the real meaning (vid. Poole's
"Synopsis").

How could Nostradamus be of Issachar, as that was one of the lost
tribes? would be a natural inquiry enough; and one could only answer it,
as the wit did, in a case somewhat similar, that He could only resemble
Issachar in being a great, "strong ass" (Gen. xlix. 14).

His mother's name was Renee de Saint Remy. Her ancestors by the father's
and mother's side were men skilled in mathematics and medicine: one was
physician to René, or Renatus, titular King of Jerusalem and Sicily, and
Count of Provence; whilst the other was physician to John, Duke of
Calabria, who was the son of King René. Our author, in his Commentaries,
says that a knowledge of mathematics had traditionally descended (*de
main en main*) to him from his early progenitors; and, in the Preface to
his "Centuries," he adds: "Que la parole héréditaire de l'occulte
prédiction sera dans son estomac intercluse."

It was his great-grandfather <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md) who gave
him, almost as in sport, a first taste for the celestial sciences. After
the death

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

of this relative he was put to school at Avignon, to study his humanity
courses, and thence he went to the university at Montpellier, to acquire
philosophy and the theory of medicine.

Montpellier, the Mons Pessulanus of antiquity, contains the most famous
school of medicine in all France. It is ancient, and is said to have
been founded by Arabian physicians when forced to fly from Spain--Moreri
says in the year 1196, by the disciples of Averroes and Avicenna. Its
inhabitants are reputed to be witty and most polite. It once had
numerous noble churches and many religious establishments, but since the
Huguenots became masters of it in 1561, they ruined all this, and made
the city the headquarters of their party for a time. Louis XIII.
besieged it in 1622, and took it. His first act was to rebuild the
Cathedral of St. Peter and the other churches; the desecration of all
such edifices being the Puritan and Huguenot fashion there and
everywhere. The town seems always to have been a fief of the Crown of
France. But a number of kinglets, such as the King of Aragon and the
King of Majorca, appear at different times to have had seignorial rights
in Montpellier; and many church councils have been held there. All these
matters are of some slight interest, as furnishing in a filmy fashion a
notion of those influences, mental and physical, that would have been
floating around Nostradamus when studying there. The seizure of the town
by the Huguenots would have occurred some years before his death. As he
was a true Churchman, their successes would have embittered his mind,
and may have influenced some of the visions contained in the "Sixains"
and "Présages."

It may interest us as Englishmen to know that in the extensive botanical
garden at Montpellier lie the remains of Miss Temple, the Narcissa,
whose death and funeral are so

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

vividly recounted by Young in the "Night Thoughts." He appears to have
considerably misrepresented the transaction; but George Eliot has made
up for it by a criticism upon him and his works, conceived, perhaps in
the grossest and worst taste that criticism from a woman's pen has ever
fallen into. She grows so angry that she can hardly even see that Young
is a poet in any sense of the word. She might easily have found out that
he was, by comparing some of her own verses with his.

Another point of interest to us in regard to Montpellier is the reversal
of public opinion touching the climate of the place. Brompton, sixty or
eighty years ago, was, from the mildness and salubrity of its air,
coupled with its then semi-rural aspect, called "the Montpellier of
London." The analogy could never have been very remarkable, as Brompton
is about on a level with the River Thames, whereas Montpellier's
splendid promenade of the Place de Peyron is 168 feet above the
sea-level, whilst the whole town runs up the hillside, as its name
expresses. Still, the phrase testifies to the opinion then prevalent.
Owing to the brightness of its atmosphere and the beauty of its suburbs,
the town was long recommended by British physicians as a health-resort
to patients suffering from pulmonary complaints; but the weather-vane of
science has now reversed that opinion entirely. Its climate is found to
be changeable, its sunshine is blazing, its atmosphere is charged with
dust that is impalpable, all the while that it seems to be clear; and
its cold mistral blasts do but portend a spot most singularly hurtful to
the lungs. The fashion varies in localities, drugs, theories, and
treatment, and as a health resort for English people the reputation of
Montpellier has passed away; but the "École de Médecine" still retains
its ancient renown as the central seminary of medical instruction in
France.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

Learned and medical as it was in the days of Nostradamus, it could not
escape visitation by a great plague, <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)
and Michael Nostradamus had to retreat to Narbonne, Toulouse, and
Bordeaux. In these towns he commenced practice, when about twenty-two
years of age, and four years later he bethought him of returning to
Montpellier for refreshment, and to take his Doctor's degree. This he
got through very quickly, and in a manner that won him the admiration
and applause of the whole College. In returning to Toulouse he passed
through Agen, a town on the Garonne, where he met with no less a person
than the learned Jules César Scaliger, <span id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8.md)
with whom he entered at once into the most intimate familiarity. This
induced him to take up his permanent residence in the town. But after a
while their cordiality grew less, till rivalry and pique sprang up
between them, and they thenceforth stood aloof from one another. Here he
married a lady "*une fort honorable demoiselle*," though history has not
divulged her name. By her he had two children, who died young; she also
died. Finding himself again companionless, he returned to his natal soil
of Provence. When he reached Marseilles, he was invited by the
Parliament of Provence to come to Aix, where he stayed three years,
receiving a salary from the city from the time the plague broke out, in
1546. It seems to have raged fiercely, and it is said that he furnished
to the Seigneur de Launay the reports which he has given in his book,
"Le Théâtre du Monde."

After the contagion passed away, the town, Moreri records, voted him for
several years following a considerable

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

pension. His services must consequently have been recognized as
valuable. He has left us the formula of his plague powder in Chapter
VIII. of his treatise "Des Fards." As a curious instance of the modesty
of the women of Aix, he records that they began to sew themselves up in
their winding sheets, as soon as they were attacked by the contagion,
that their bodies might not be exposed naked after death ("Penny
Cyclopædia"). I suppose we may judge from this that the system of burial
during the contagion was as gross and indecent as in the famous plague
of London; or is this only a fanciful imitation of the story of the
women of Marseilles in classical times?

He went thence to Salon de Craux, which lies midway between Avignon and
Marseilles. Here he married for the second time. The lady's name is
given by Garencières as Anna Ponce Genelle; Anne Poussart, says Moreri;
others say Pons Jumel. (See the epitaph further on.) There is the same
incertitude as to his family. Jean Aimes de Chavigny, whom we are
following, makes it to consist of six children, three boys and three
girls; while Garencières says three sons and one daughter.

It was here, relates our memoir, that, foreseeing great mutations were
about to affect all Europe, and that civil wars and troubles were so
soon to come upon the kingdom of France, he felt an unaccountable and
new enthusiasm springing up uncontrollably in his mind, which at last
amounted almost to a maddening fever, till he sat down to write his
"Centuries" and other "Presages." The first of these "Presages" is dated
1555, and runs as follows:--

"D'Esprit divin l'ame presage atteinte,  
Trouble, famine, peste, guerre courir;  
Eaux, siccitez, terre et mer dc sang teinte,  
Paix, tresac à naistre, Prelats, Princes mourir!"

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

He kept them by him for a long time, half afraid to risk the
publication; he foresaw there was danger, and that it would lead to
infinite detraction, calumny, and backbiting, as indeed it finally fell
out. A thing like this is like the fox stolen by the Spartan youth, that
eats the heart out, and is sure to get vent sooner or later. His
memorialist says, that at last, overcome by a desire to be useful to the
public, he produced them. No sooner had he done so than the rumour ran
from mouth to mouth, at home and abroad, that some thing marvellous and
admirable had appeared. One cannot see of what use they could be to the
public, as they could not possibly be understood till they were
interpreted after the event and by it. In some of the quatrains he says
as much himself. He no doubt published them because he felt an intense
longing so to do; and, when the mind of a man reaches this stage of
desire, it will not take him long to find some excellent reason for
carrying out the impulsion. Public good, the advancement of religion,
the sustentation of faith, the psychological inference as to the
immorality of the human soul, or any other good phrase, will serve a man
as a sufficient reason for doing what he wants to do. That man must be a
great searcher into his own consciousness, if he cannot readily assume
that the motive assigned in such a case is the *causa causativa* of the
act of putting forth.

Moreri's account is not exactly the same as that of our memoir. Moreri
describes him as being invited to Lyons in 1547, but as returning very
quickly to Salon, only to find that his popularity at the latter place
had greatly abated. The disappointment he experienced from this
treatment made him withdraw a good deal from society, and commit himself
the more to hard study. He tells us that he had for a long time
previously practised divination; now he began to think himself to be
directly inspired as to the future.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> From this time, as
the lights occurred to his mind, he began committing them to writing at
the moment. He set them down at first in plain prose, if you can call
enigmatical sentences plain prose; at any rate, they were not written in
verse.

Garencières' version varies again. With him it is, that Nostradamus
found by experience that the perfect knowledge of medicine is
unattainable without the aid of astrology, to which he now addicted
himself. It is an alluring science, and one towards the pursuit of which
his natural genius strongly disposed him, so that he made very rapid
progress in it. His first publications in this line consisted of
almanacs, according to the custom of the time, for profit and
recreation's sake; and in these he so happily hit off the conjuncture of
events that both he and his publications became greatly sought after. It
is somewhat curious that so few of these almanacs appear to be now
extant. One would have expected that documents of such interest, once in
type, would not perish entirely from all households and libraries. It
may, however, be taken as a proof of the maelstrom of time that engulfs
everything, so that by the period when posterity grows interested in any
event, all its belated questionings are presented with a universal
blank. The spirit of literary piracy, too, seems to have been rife in
those early days. The success of his work soon became a cause of
discredit to him, as it led enterprising printers and booksellers to
vend, under his name, almanacs destitute of everything that had
constituted the merit of his.

When the work made its appearance, it divided the public. Some called
the prophet a simple visionary, or, in coarser phrase, a fool; others
accused him of magic, and of being in too close treaty with the Devil to
be honest. A few held their judgment in suspense, and would pronounce no
opinion

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

on the subject. A vast number of the grandees and of the learned, both
at home and abroad, thought that he was endowed with a gift
supernatural; and amongst these were Henri II. and Catherine de Medici.
It remained to the *esprits forts* and the ignorant public, who knew
nothing of him but his name, to pronounce him a charlatan and impostor.
There is one thing certain, he felt much hesitation as to publishing at
all; and, when he took that step at last, he addressed the book to his
infant son, and not to any public character, in the year 1555. At this
period he would bc fifty-two. This is not a time of life at which men
usually commence a course of imposture. When he is summoned to the Court
at Paris, loaded with honours and consulted on high matters (*de choses
importantes*), he displays nothing but moderation and good sense, and
returns contentedly to his modest home at Salon. Upon all ordinary lines
of human judgment, such conduct seems to indicate genuineness; and this
is strengthened, if not established, by his genuine gravity of
deportment and serious religious sentiments. Nobody has denied the
purity of his life. Still, a certain Lord Pavilion, of his own day,
wrote against him, or perhaps against this publishers' figment of a
name, rather than his. Further, we find the book led to the bitter
epigrammatic distich of the poet Jodele, or as others say, of Beza,--

"Nostradamus cum falsa damus, nam fallere nostrum est,  
Et cum falsa damus, nil nisi nostra damus."

This can very easily be turned against the piratical almanac makers,
thus:--

"Vera damus cum verba damus quæ Nostradamus dat;  
Sed cum nostra damus, nil nisi falsa damus."

In spite of piracy and obloquy, the repute of Nostradamus grew, as we
have said, in influential quarters, until it came

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

to the ears of Queen Catherine de Medici and Henri II, on the
publication, in March, 1555, of the first seven Centuries of his
"Prophecies." The remaining Centuries, the Sixains, and Presages, were
not published till long after. In the following year, 1556, they sent
for him to attend the Court in Paris: though Garencières says he left
Salon on July 14, 1555, and reached Paris on August 15th, a
particularity which seems to indicate special knowledge. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) The Lord Constable Montmorency attended him
at his inn, and presented him to the king in person. The king showed him
high favour, and ordered him to be lodged at the palace of the Cardinal
de Bourbon, Archbishop of Sens, during his stay in the capital.

When there a severe attack of gout seized him, that lasted ten or twelve
days. His majesty sent him two hundred crowns in gold (two hundred écus
d'or; vid. Moreri) in a velvet purse, and the queen one hundred crowns
(Le Pelletier, i. 92). They then despatched him to Blois, to visit their
children, the royal princes, and give his astrological opinion. He
repaired thither, and seems to have acquitted himself to the
satisfaction of the king. It is quite certain that he did not tell them
precisely what he thought, <span id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10.md) for the
princes were Francis II., Charles IX., and Henry III., whose tragical
fates he has correctly set out, and with unmistakable clearness, as may
be seen (at pp. [84](oon09.htm#page_84), [86](oon09.htm#page_86.md),
[96](oon09.htm#page_96).md) by the forecasts in his strange book. He,
however, cast their horoscopes and acquitted himself in this, as in all
other transactions, *en homme d'esprit*. He returned to Salon so much
encouraged that he set to work and completed his

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Centuries,"
consisting of three hundred more quatrains. These further quatrains he
appears to have printed in 1558, but Garencières says that he dedicated
them to the king in 1557. The only thing that is certain is that the
Texte-type dates the epistle June 27, 1558. This "Luminary Epistle" to
the king, Garencières tells us, discovers future events "from the birth
of Louis XIV., now reigning, till the coming of antichrist." <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md)

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

Henri II. was killed the following year, 1559, at the tournament of St.
Quentin, as we shall see- it fully set forth at Quatrain 35 in Century
I.

He had now become quite a court favourite, for Emanuel, the Duke of
Savoy, visited him at his house at Salon about this period, in the month
of October; and, in the December following, the Princesse Marguerite de
France, sister of Henry II., who by the treaty of peace at Cambresis was
to marry the duke, came also to Nostradamus, entertaining him very
familiarly (Garencières and Moreri).

Charles IX. made a progress through the kingdom in 1564, to quiet the
cities that had mutinied; and when he came to Provence, on arriving at
Salon, November 17th, he asked first of all for Nostradamus. Nostradamus
was in the suite of magistrates around the king, so that he was
presented on the instant, upon which the king made him his Physician in
Ordinary, and honoured him with the title of Counsellor. He complained
rather bitterly of the neglect with which his follow-townsmen treated
him. César Nostradamus reports this, saying, "*Et de ce, me souviens
fort* 

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

bien, car je fus de la partie" (Moreri). On the return journey he again
inquired for Nostradamus, and gave him two hundred ecus. He was at this
time over sixty, and with his health fast breaking under severe attacks
of gout. He died within about sixteen months of this period, and the
salary and profits of Physician in Ordinary must have greatly comforted
the old man in his latter days. He enjoyed now the further satisfaction
of being flocked to by learned men, grandees, and others, who resorted
to him far and near, as to an oracle. "As St. Jerome remarks of Livy, so
may we remark of him," says his biographer, Jean Aimes, "that those who
came to France sought Nostradamus as the only thing to be seen there."

The closing scene is now drawing very near, and we find him much
afflicted with his maladies, notably arthritic gout, as distinguished
from podagra, which Dr. Cullen considers as the seat of idiopathic gout.
He awaited with firmness his climacteric, as they used to designate a
man's sixty-third year. He died on the 2nd of July, 1566, a little
before sun. rise, having all his senses yet about him, for the arthrisis
turned to dropsy about eight days previously, and early on the second
day of the month suffocated him. Jean Aimes says that Nostradamus was
well advised of the time, even of the very day and hour, when his death
must take place. The prophet reminded him frequently towards the close
of the previous June that he had written with his own hand, in the
Ephemerides of Jean Stadius, these words in Latin, *Hic prope mors est*
("Here is death at hand"). "The day," continues this friend, "before he
exchanged this life for a better, after I had spent many hours with him,
and late at night was taking leave of him until the following morning,
he said, 'You will not see me alive at sunrise.'" M. le Pelletier gives
(i. 91) Presage 141 as a stanza pointing to his

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

own death; but, as the "Presages" were not printed till 1568, their
authenticity may or may not be accepted as the reader feels inclined.
The lines run thus, and are remarkable enough, if we admit that they
were a genuine forecast; for, although they assign no specific date, yet
they sum up the principal facts rather fully:--

"De retour d'Ambassade, don de Roy mis au lieu;  
Plus n'en fera; sera allé à Dieu:  
Parans plus proches, amis, freres du sang,  
Trouvé tout mort près du lict et du banc."

The meaning given to this is, that on his return from Arles, whence he
was sent for, in 1564, by Charles IX., to see him a second time, after
he had safely put away the three hundred crowns given him by the king
and queen, his last transaction would be concluded, and he would then
under his soul to God. His nearest relatives, brothers, and friends
would find him dead near his bed, seated, as was customary with him, on
the bench at its foot, as he could there breathe more freely.

This is the interpretation put upon it by M. le Pelletier. As I
understand César Nostradamus, the king did not send for him to Arles,
but asked again for him on his majesty's return to Salon; and I should
think the word "ambassade" must refer to some private mission the king
had sent him upon entirely apart from this, and for which he paid him.
Be this as it may, the fact that Nostradamus assigns no date for his
death, in this presage, goes to establish its authenticity, one would
incline to say. For supposing it to have been foisted in, after his
death, surely a fabricator of the marvellous would first of all have
made it to show *trois vingts et trois bis*, and twisted that into some
colourable shape. He would have been little likely to add as a
prophetical

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

feature that the king's present had been put away in a safe place, as to
do so seems anything rather than a supernatural instinct. It is a touch
of prose more than of the Python. On the whole, I should incline to take
the verse for a genuine emanation from the pen of Nostradamus. Certainly
he would recognize, even medically, that, as he found himself to be
growing "*fort caduc et débile*" towards his climacterical year, he
would know that his dissolution was at hand. A man's grand climacteric
is generally considered to arrive at 63, though some place it at 81,
that number being composed of 9 times 9. In either of these periods, if
sickness occur, it is considered as especially likely to prove fatal.

There seems to be a diversity of opinion about this, for some say that
the *annus climactericus* is 84, or 12 times 7. Aulus Gellius thinks the
opinion to be of immense antiquity, running back to the Chaldeans; and
no doubt Pythagoras derived it from the East. Ficinus explains it by
saying that the body of man is ruled over by each planet in turn for the
space of one year, and, Saturn being the most maleficent, every seventh
year falling to his presidency becomes extremely dangerous. This
explanation would shut out the nines, except in the sixty-third and
eighty-first year, but it would also vitiate the whole scheme of
astrology, for the planet under which a man was born (say he were born
under Saturn) would dominate his body at birth, and be, one must
suppose, the ruling planet that year, and, if it were Saturn, would
recur only on his eighth year. Eighty-four would not be in favour
generally, as it consists entirely of even numbers, though divisible by
seven. Many held that only a number produced by the multiplication of an
odd number could be climacterical. Augustus thought it a subject of
great rejoicing when he had passed over his sixty-third

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

year. <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) Moreri will have eighty-one to
be properly speaking the climacteric, and he notes that at this age died
Plato, Diogenes, Eratosthenes the geometer, and many other illustrious
personages. Some went so far as to say that political bodies had their
climacterical periods; and they certainly, judging from our own country,
have periods of fatal folly, whether or no the nines and sevens collide,
or the stars fight against Sisera. But amongst other oddities of history
may be chronicled the fact that Henri Quatre was the sixty-third King of
France, which made Malherbe talk of--

"La vaine étude s'applique,  
A trouver la climatérique,  
De l'éternelle fleur-de-lis"--

that *fleur-de-lis* whose terrible withering up in the fatal year of '93
Nostradamus so powerfully forecasts.

Suffice it to say that in this climacterical crisis Nostradamus
succumbed in his sixty-third year to gout, which turned to dropsy. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md)

Nostradamus was interred at the church of the Franciscan Friars (Les
Cordeliers) at Salon, as it is noted, on the left-hand side of the
church door (Garencières). His widow erected to him a marble tablet,
"representing his figure to the life, and his arms above it." The
epitaph is as follows, made, they say, in imitation of that great Livy
aforenamed, the Roman historian:--

TRANSLATION.

"Here lie the bones of the illustrious Michael Nostradamus, whose almost
divine pen alone, in the judgment of all mortals, was worthy to record,
under the influx of the stars, the future events of the whole world. He
lived 62 years, 6 months, 17 days. He died at Salon in the year 1566.
Posterity, disturb not his sweet rest! Anne Ponce Gemelle hopes for her
husband true felicity."

The text of this epitaph is that given by Benoist Rigaud in the edition
of Nostradamus published by him in 1568.

In stature he was somewhat undersized, of a robust body, sprightly, and
vigorous. He had a broad and open forehead, a straight even nose, grey
eyes, of kindly expression, but in anger capable of flashing fire. The
general expression was severe, though pleasant, so that a grand humanity
shone through the seriousness. Even in age his cheeks were rosy. He had
a long thick beard, and excellent health till nearly the close of life;
he had his senses, being alert and keen, up to the very last moment. He
had a good and lively wit, seizing with quick comprehension everything
that he wished to

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

acquire. His judgment was very penetrating, his memory happy and
retentive. He was taciturn by nature, thought much and spoke little; but
at the right time and occasion he could discourse extremely well. He was
quick, and sudden even to irascibility; but very patient where work had
to be done. He slept four or five hours only out of the twenty-four. He
practised freedom of speech himself and commended it in others. He was
cheerful and facetious in conversation, though in jesting a little given
to bitterness. He was attached, so says De Chavigny, to the Roman
Church, and held fixedly the Catholic faith; out of its pale there was
for him no salvation. Though pursuing a line of thought entirely his
own, he had no sympathy with the Lutheran heretics of so-called
Freethought. He was given to prayer, fasting, and charity. As far as
outward observance was concerned, he might be classed with the highly
respectable and decent. Le Pelletier says, "Sa fin fut Chrétienne;" but
he adds a little further on that his style is very much more like that
of the Pagan oracles of Greece and Rome than of the canonical prophets
of Hebrew inspiration. He was very generous to the poor, and held it as
a sort of maxim that in this sense it was legitimate to make friends
with "the mammon of unrighteousness."

Jean Aimes de Chavigny, who seems to have come over from Beaune to play
the part of a Boswell to Nostradamus and,--after his friend's death, is
said to have devoted twenty-eight years of his life to editing the
"Centuries" with notes, <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) says that he
collected twelve books of the "Centuries," of which vols. vii., xi., and
xii. are imperfect. These are in quatrains, and are classified as
*Prophéties*, and they extend to very remote ages. The *Presages*, we
are told, were written

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

between 1550 and 1567, <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) and. were
collected by Aimes and reduced into twelve books in prose, as he thinks
them worthy of the attention of posterity. The few Presages thou are in
print run to only one hundred and forty-three quatrains in verse; so we
must suppose that those written in prose have perished entirely.

Nostradamus left two brothers behind him: one named Bertrand; the other,
Jean, who was his junior, and proctor to the Parliament at Aix, composed
a History of Provence, and also wrote the lives of the Poets of
Provence. <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md)

Moreri states that by his second wife he had six children, three boys
and three girls. Of his sons, César, the eldest, was a person of
demonstratively gay and kindly spirit. It was to him, when quite a
child, that Nostradamus dedicated the first seven of the "Centuries"
published by him. These are the most authentic of all, and Moreri
remarks that, if you wish the quatrains to be without interpolation, you
should secure early editions. The reader will understand that to be now
unnecessary, inasmuch as we have all along been dealing with the
*Texte-type*. César was born at Salon, 1555, and died 1629. He, like his
uncle Jean, was an author, and wrote upon the same topics, leaving in
manuscript a collection of the most remarkable things happening in
Provence from the year 1080 to 1494. In this he included the lives of
the poets of Provence. Many years after his death, his nephew and
namesake, César Nostradamus, who was Governor of Provence and gentleman
in waiting upon the Due de Guise;

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

found them, and himself worked at them, till, in 1603, the Parliament of
the province voted him three thousand livres to encourage him to
complete the work, which he did; and they were finally printed in Lyons
in 1614, under the title of "Chroniques de l'Histoire de Provence." He
commences with the Celtic Gauls at the early date of the Deluge. This is
worthy of a true scion of the tribe of Issachar. A very strange story is
told of César by La Motte le Vayer in his "Instruction pour Monseigneur
le Dauphin." He, like his father, Michel, had a taste for forecasting
the future, and had ventured to predict that Pouzin, which was besieged,
would perish by fire; but it was taken by *coup de main*. Whilst the
pillage was going forward, the foolish prophet was, it is said, seen,
match in hand, endeavouring to set it on fire. He was caught; and
Saint-Luc, the commander, asked him if he had prophesied anything for
himself that day. He replied, "No!" on which the general rode at him
with his lance, and killed him on the spot. Moreri relates this story
somewhat differently. If either version were true, it would be clear
that César did not understand "*la parole héréditaire de l'occulte
prediction*," and that the lancehead instead was "*dans son estomac
intercluse*." From other authorities, however, it would seem that he was
busy about his history long after the date thus assigned for his death.
Charles, his brother, was very excellent in Provençal poetry,--and
several pieces of his arc still extant. Michel's third son, whose name
is not given us by Moreri, became a Capuchin.

An anecdote is related by Garencières, which he throws out as "a merry
passage" to recreate his reader. Nostradamus was with Lord Florinville
in Lorraine, at the Castle of Faim. He was attending medically his
lordship's mother. In the yard where they strolled there were two little
pigs, one white and the other black. His lordship inquired of
Nostradamus

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

jestingly what would be the fate of those pigs. "We shall eat the black
one, and the wolf shall eat the white," said he. Lord Florinville
secretly ordered the cook to get ready the white one for supper. When it
was spitted ready for roasting, the cook left the kitchen for something,
and in his absence a young tame wolf came in and ate a part of it, so
that it could not appear at table. The cook immediately killed the black
one, and sent it up at the time appointed. His lordship, not knowing
what had happened, said to Nostradamus, "Well, Sir, we are now eating
the white pig; how shall the wolf get it?" "I do not believe it,"
rejoined the prophet; "it is the black one that is upon the table." The
cook was sent for, and by his confession the truth came out, much to the
surprise of everybody present. Another story follows this, that
Nostradamus had said that treasure was hidden in a little hill near
Faim, that it would not be found if sought for, but that, if the ground
was dug for any other reason, it would. Garencières adds that there is
great probability about this as it is the site of an ancient temple, and
many times since antiquities have been unearthed here. He completes his
cock-and-bull story by saying that many such tales are told of
Nostradamus all over France but that he passes them by as being
"unwilling to write anything without good warrant."

Amongst other nonsensical reports spread was one that he caused himself
to be buried alive, and that he continued to write prophecies. This no
doubt was set afloat by those honest publishers who in life had done him
the honour to pirate his almanacs; at any rate it made for their
interest. It has also been pretended that so many in Salon regarded him
as an impostor, that for security's sake he was buried in the Franciscan
Church.

Those who desire the Bibliography of the editions of Nostradamus

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

up to the year 1840 will consult that which has been admirably drawn up
by Eugène Bareste, Paris, 1840, in his work upon "Nostradamus." Or they
may find it copied textually, with all due acknowledgment of its
excellence, in the first volume of Le Pelletier's edition of the
"Oracles."

The works of Nostradamus, besides the "Prophecies," seem. to have been--

Several Almanacs, two of which were translated at once into English, and
are given by Watt, "Bib. Brit."

"Almanacke for 1559." London: 1559. 8vo.

"Almanacke et Prognostications." London: 1559. 8vo.

Moreri gives further an--

Almanac for country labourers, to mark the seasons favourable for their
work. A true predecessor, this, of Moore's *Vox Stellarum*.

"Predictions before 1558." London: 1691. 4to. This is named by Watt, and
may be a translation of the genuine first edition of the "Seven
Centuries," but I have not met with it.

"Prophecies of the Kings and Queens of England." 1715. This is the work
by D. D. that we have largely quoted from.

"An excellent Treatise on Contagious Infirmities in 1559-60." Translated
into English. London: 1559.

"Traité des Fardements." Lyon: 1552.

"Des Confiteurs," etc. Anvers: 1557.

"Opuscule de plusieurs exquises Receptes, divisé en deux parties." Lyon:
1572. 16mo. This contains both the above.

"La Remède très utile contre la Peste et toutes Fièvres
pestilentielles.' Paris: 1651. 8vo.

"Paraphrase de Galien sur 'lexhortation de Menodote aux Études des Beaux
Arts." Lyon: 1558. 8vo.

Touching the prophecies of Nostradamus, Théophile de Garencières gives
us an interesting fact, that, after the primer, it was the first book at
school in which he learnt to read. It was the custom in France then
(*i.e.* 1618) to initiate children by that book. They thought the
crabbed and obsolete words, such as long survived in the English law,
would give the scholars some idea of the old French language; so

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

that the book got republished from year to year like an almanac. He
chronicles that many have run mad from over-studying the prophecies. He
dissuades readers from doing this, because interpretation must always be
a little uncertain where, like an ancient oracle, the author indulges in
a double sense, which he thinks Nostradamus often does. Without a
peculiar genius, he does not suppose it possible to get at a right
understanding of the quatrain. Even when the prophecy is quite plain, as
that the Parliament should put King Charles to death, no reader, until
it had happened, could tell when, or how, it would be brought about,
Even his astrological signs will not fix things, because the planets go
and return again to the same bearings. Some of his reasons are very
peculiar, one being that it is not profit able for the *vulgar* to have
knowledge of the future, that God reserves the knowledge of the times to
Himself, and that it might trespass upon "business of State" to discover
and lay open things which the prudent wish to conceal; and he concludes,
oddly enough, that "for these reasons (dear Reader) I would not have
thee entangle thyself in the pretentions of knowing future things."

He conceives that there are many concurrent causes tending to diminish
the prophetic reputation of Nostradamus. The very ordinary manner in
which he conformed to the rules and ritual of the Roman Catholic Church,
would lead no one to infer that he enjoyed any extraordinary favour from
the Almighty; his proficiency in judicial astrology would furnish matter
of prejudice against him in the minds of many learned men; the very
devout suspected him of necromancy, and familiarity with the Angel of
Darkness; finally the inherent obscurity of his style has been rendered
still more difficult by the interminable faults introduced by, the
copyists and the carelessness of printers.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Now, it is admitted, he says, and by its ablest defenders, that judicial
astrology cannot enable its professor to foretell such particularities
as proper names and other circumstances that hang upon the free will of
men; and, as our author does foretell such things as these, he must have
had recourse to the black art to obtain his results. Accordingly Lord
Florimond de Raimond, in his "Birth of Heresies," makes this charge
against him; also Lord Spond, in the third volume of his "Annals," in
1566, devised this epitaph for him. "Mortuus est hoc anno nugax ille
toto orbe famosus *Michel Nostradamus*, qui se præscium et presagum
eventuum futurorum per astrorum influxum venditavit, sub cujus deinceps
nomine quivis homines ingeniosi suas hujus modi cogitationes protendere
consueverent, in quem valde apposite lusit qui dixit: *Nostra damus* cum
falsa damus," etc. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)

Provoked thus, Garencières endeavours to prove Nostradamus to have been
enlightened by the Holy Spirit. We shall not follow him in this matter
any further than to avail ourselves of the facts we may light upon in
the course of his arguments, and to record a few of the eulogies upon
him that Garencières gathers from eminent authors in times past. To
these we may add some authorities who in modern times have named him;
but these mostly sum up his forecastings as springing from venality,
vanity, and imposture.

Of proper names, that Nostradamus has anticipated, the list is
considerable. He names the Lord of Monluc; Captain Charry; Lord de la
Mole, Admiral of the Galleys to Henri

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> II.; Entragues,
beheaded by Louis XIII.; Clarepegne, the headsman; Sinan, the Pasha who
destroyed Hungary; Clément, who murdered Henri III.; the Attorney David
and Captain Ampus; Rousseau, the Mayor of Puy; Louis, Prince of Condé;
Sixtus V., calling him son of Hamont; Gabrielle d'Estrée; Lord Mutonis;
Anthony de Sourdis, Lord Chancellor of France; the Queen Louise; Antony
of Portugal. Since Garencières' time other names have been identified:
Narbon, the Minister of War; Saulce; Lethuille, for the Tuileries;
Lonole, for Old Noll, or Cromwell; Montmorency; Le Grand Chiren, anagram
of Henri le Grand; Mendosus, anagram of Vendosme; Norlaris, anagram for
Lorrains; Robin, anagram of Biron; Rapis, anagram for Paris; Esleu Cap,
for Capet, or Louis XVI.; Varennes, the place where Louis was arrested;
the play upon *bour* and *bon*, for Bourbon (Cent. vii. 44); Ergaste,
anagram of Estrange for Marie Antoinette the Austrian; Mont Gaulfier,
for Montgolfier, the æronaut; the island of Elba, mentioned as Æthalia,
the ancient name of Elba; Sainct Memire, anagram for Sainct Meri; and
the play on "dort leans" for Louis Philippe. This is a goodly list of
names to guess at haphazard. Such chance as could so result would rival
any prophecy in the miraculous nature of its elements.

Again, as regards the curious things he mentions, one might make out a
long list. The date of the Fire of London. The five hundred Marseillais
that led the attack upon the Tuileries. The naming of the very year 1792
for the French Revolution; the 22nd of September in that year being the
date from which the Republicans began to reckon anew their era. Many
more might so easily be gathered as to even weary the reader with their
enumeration.

He mentions the birth of persons that were born after his death. Now,
judicial astrology could give no help in

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

such cases, since to commence casting a nativity presupposes birth. In
his epistle to his son César we shall see what he says of himself and
the gifts he possessed; but even there he was obliged to be somewhat
obscure, to protect himself from the ridicule of the world on the one
side, and from the severities of the Church on the other. He tells his
son to eschew the study of the future astrologically, to avoid magic, as
prohibited by the Church and Scripture, and that he himself had burnt
some books that taught the art of prophesying, although it is pretty
evident that he had first read them through very carefully himself. He
relates that a mighty flame burst forth from them to the danger of his
house, and this he interpreted to be the consequence of their falsity.
But yet he seems to have gone through a good many of the magical forms
when he was about to devote the night to prophetical studies. He holds
that inspired Revelation is "*a participation of the Eternal Divinity*,"
though he scarcely lays claim to being a prophet in this sense of the
word; in fact, he denies himself to be such a prophet. But, failing to
claim inspiration, and denouncing the practice of astrology and the
pursuit of magic, one is left somewhat in the dark as to what he really
did profess to be the source of fatidical utterance possessed by him.
That he had the gift in a marvellous potency this book will show; and
that he openly claimed to possess it his whole life proves. It is, in
fact, from this I should desire to establish that at least he was no
impostor, for he only told others what he began by implicitly believing
himself.

As to his obscurity, he himself admits it as a thing to be cultivated
both in the times he lived in and in those that were to follow. No one
can truthfully deny that obscurity and prophecy seem to be almost
interchangeable and convertible terms. The prophecies in Scripture are
of

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

such ambiguity that Whitby was commended by many for concluding his
Commentary on the Bible with the General Epistle of Jude, without a word
bestowed upon the Revelations of St. John. There are those who will hold
that prophecies are useless, as they cannot generally be understood
until they have been fulfilled. It is obvious that many prophecies are
of such a nature as that, if they were clearly understood previous to
the event, they would prevent their own fulfilment, and so cease to have
been prophecies. What they foretold would never have occurred. The
philosophy of history is supposed to show that Providence shapes the
course of human events how much soever humanity may seem at every
instant to be following out its own collective will. This theory is most
in favour amongst erudite modern thinkers, who incline very little
towards acquiescence in the old Church doctrine of Predestination. Yet
inspired prophecy is a collateral proof of the same principle as that
which underlies the philosophy of history. Both of them depend on the
finger of God shaping--first shaping chaos into things, and then things
into their continuous courses. The shaping is not needed more at the
first creation than it is at every successive stage, whether for
preservation or for progression. Again, the interest of uninspired
prophecy is for mortal man not much less vivid; for, if we have
interpreted Nostradamus rightly, we find in him a man living three
hundred years ago talking intelligibly, if not clearly, of things that
are happening to-day. If there be a power in human nature,--latent in
the generality, but in a few alert and quick,--to link far centuries
together in anticipatory thought, I take it to be quite clear, that that
one fact must revolutionize the whole scheme of human philosophy as
accepted now, whether it relates to life, to death, or to futurity. The
fatidical capacity implies a spirit

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

of immortality in man. With that once established, we re-enter upon the
domain of faith; we recognize that the earth is drossy and the body sin;
we re-create the soul, and laugh at the fool (or the philosopher) who
doubts, denies, and ridicules it. It gives new ground to teach the
immortality of man; it lifts us above the dirt-doctrine of gold; it
renders poetry once again possible to lips hallowed with Apollo's fire;
it brings back a possibility of worship upon earth, and, with that,
prayer, praise, and peace. Bates, the silver-tongued, says well, that
for man "it is as natural to pray as to breathe."

Garencières is of opinion that the writings of our prophet were for a
century allowed to "be in darkness," but we have seen that in his own
day Nostradamus attracted the notice of the learned, of the nobility,
and of the king himself. Garencières says that the first book they gave
him at school after the primer was "The Centuries," so it was not
neglected then; and M. le Pelletier remarks that Nostradamus's fame has
now been before the world for three hundred years, with an always
growing reception. Of course, as time wanes, and as fresh quatrains
become interpreted after accomplishment, the series must shine with an
ever augmenting brilliancy and splendour. The kings of France have never
been quite indifferent to the Oracles, or at least to such of them as
could be shown to refer to them individually. It is reported of Charles
Edward Stuart, the Pretender, that he to the last conned <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) over the volume, anxiously hoping to find
in it some stanza promising to his royal line restoration to the throne
of England, but in vain (Chambers' "Book of Days," ii. 13).

In modern times prophecy is derided, and our seer, obscurely hinting his
strange forecasts, is voted incoherent,

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

rhapsodial, or an impostor. Almost every one has heard his name
mentioned, but that is all. Few who come across his work accidentally on
a bookshelf can make head or tail of his Provençal and half obsolete
terms. Without special study you cannot understand him; and to study a
work that lies under a general ban of imposture, in a time when only
lucrative study is pursued, is a thing not to be thought of by a
*littérateur* of any intelligence. Consequently in England it is a name,
floating far and wide it may be, that nevertheless remains but a name
and nothing more. I hope, however, when this book comes to be read by
the competent few, it will be seen that there exists far more than a
mere name to be dealt with here; that in Nostradamus we have the
greatest fatidical seer, not divinely accredited, that the world has
ever beheld; that if accepted as being endowed with a rare and curious
foresight,--after the severest inquiry into what he has done has been
instituted by grammarians, historians, and philosophic critics,--it will
next become necessary to try to look into the causes, and so ascertain
how he operated. If we cannot succeed in that, and yet cannot deny his
work, we must add the faculty, so remarkably developed in him, to the
perceptive powers of the human race, as a sixth sense,--generally latent
but sometimes developed,--the faculty of anticipating the future.
Science, so called, must enlarge its narrow categories, and admit,
though never so grudgingly, that a new faculty of vast import must
henceforth be accredited to humanity; a faculty which the superstitious
and the profoundly religious alike have immemorially admitted, but which
philosophers, as such, have as persistently ignored, denied, or even
ridiculed. It has often been said by troubled thinkers, with a
pretentious flourish of baffled profundity, that "true philosophy begins
in doubt." I would whisper it down the

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

wind, but not in Gath, that for the most part there it also ends.
Anatomy cuts up a dead man to find life. Analysis reduces final
Investigation to a *caput mortuum*. Philosophy begins in doubt, and
travels a wide circle to close in doubt again. Perhaps, after all, the
best basis might be faith. Beginning with faith, haply a man might find
God accompanying investigation with him step by step through life, even
in this world and its miraculous garden, till the hour tome for him to
step, through the six-foot wicket, into the Paradise of that glorious
world that is adjacent to us but not seen, where sighs are not heaved,
and whose glories are incorruptible.

When we come to enumerate some few of the opinions that have been
expressed on the writings and character of Nostradamus, it will be seen
that a vast number of them condemn him for charlatanry and imposture,
especially as we approach our own day. For now what is denominated
science accepts nothing for true but what is deducible from the reason;
it takes for granted that nothing can be known respecting the future,
beyond what cultivated prudence can gather from a politic acquaintance
with the past, coupled perhaps with a sagacious estimate of the
principles now at work, and the fruit they are likely to engender. In
fact, what the knowledge of a wise man can enable him to foresee, covers
for such theorists the whole extent and province of all prophecy
possible to man,--the sagacity of Mazarin, which detected the
revolutionary element in the Cardinal de Retz whilst still a youth; or
the prediction of Bishop Butler, in 1741, that the *levelling spirit*
then visible, under the direction of principles that were atheistic,
threatened dangers that might menace Europe. But to call this prophecy
is to be ignorant of what the word prophecy means. To state it thus, or
so to limit it, is to deny the existence

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

of the prophetic faculty altogether. A direct denial of the thing is
better than a sceptical definition of it. Scepticism, then, in our day,
not believing there can be such a thing as a true presage, concludes
that Mother Shipton and Nostradamus stand on precisely the same footing.
They read a quatrain of Nostradamus, only understand one line out of
four, and say that, although that one may be intelligible, the Sphinx
itself could make nothing of the others, and that out of a number of
such verses it would be marvellous if something curious were not
occasionally let fall. The next inference is that the author set up for
a gift that he did not possess, and soon found the imposture was far
more lucrative than the dull routine of medical practice, as in those
times the superstition of the public was unlimited. The ignorance of the
Middle Ages is pointedly contrasted for us now with the wisdom and
knowledge of our own day. What, prejudice apart, does this mean, if
briefly summed up in an aphorism? Only this: that the wisdom of to-day
gives us the Nihilist of *no faith*, in place of the Astrologer of *too
much*.

We ought to remember in all this that our author had reached the mature
age of fifty-two before he printed one word of the work that we are
spending time over. He tells us that for generations the family of
Nostradamus had inherited and transmitted some share of the prophetic
gift (Garencière's Preface, p. 16), that it came to him as a natural
genius; in which it seems that his sons partially shared. He had
cultivated it long for his private pleasure, and the request in which
his almanacs stood seems to have first led him to think he Might more
largely utilize the faculty. He never appears to have made any large sum
of money through it. He supported himself and brought up his family by
steady work in his professional calling. On

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

the very brink of publicity, anticipating malign influences, he still
hesitated to take the final plunge; and, when he did take it, he was in
his fifty-third year. Men seldom pass through life performing all its
duties with credit and decorum, earn a competency, and at fifty-two
enter upon a career of contemptible imposture. No; this is not according
to human nature. We must acquit him of imposture.

Michel Nostradamus was one of the most learned men of his day, the
friend of Jules César Scaliger. He knew many modern languages, and the
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. He had followed medicine from the age of
twenty-two, took his Doctor's degree at twenty-six, filled a
professional chair at Montpellier, and late in life devoted himself to
judicial astrology; in which, and in an intuitive forecast beyond what
that can bestow, he has distanced by far all other competitors in the
same line. Let a reader thoroughly acquaint himself with all that is
here set before him as to Charles I. in England, and its bloody
re-enactment in the French Revolution, letting all the rest stand aside;
and, if he can rise from the perusal, feeling that there is any kind of
imposture discoverable throughout those strange and wonderful
revelations then he himself possesses so miraculous a form of judgment,
as to leave me without a word further to advance upon the subject.

M. le Pelletier conceives that the Commun Advénement, or *l'avénement au
règne des gens du commun*, which I have rendered "The Vulgar Advent,"
extending from the death of Louis XVI. to the reign of Antichrist, is
the grand object of Nostradamus. It is to paint this lurid epopee that
he devotes three-quarters at least of his quatrains, according to le
Pelletier. Myself, I think this proportion to be overstated. But our
prophet returns to it again and again, elaborates the most minute
details, and concentres upon it as

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

in a focus the brightest rays of his mystical genius. Some think that
Catharine de Medici was largely influenced in her firm and far-seeing
policy by the counsels of Nostradamus, whom she visited expressly at
Salon de Craux, in 1564, with her son, Charles IX. This may have been
so, but it is a great question whether Nostradamus, for all his visions,
curiously as they realize themselves in time, could advise the queen or
anybody else at all better than any other wise man of elaborate culture
could. His visions would come to him as verses to a great poet, and when
written down and the afflatus fled, he would drop back to the ordinary
condition of humanity. He would drop back to the level of reason and the
discourse of science, with nothing to specially distinguish him from
other men well placed to learn such wisdom and knowledge as this world
has to bestow upon them. To expect more of him is to expect with the
commonalty that if you met Milton in Bread Street he would address you
in blank verse, and strain "Good morning" into metre. Great men cut very
plain figures in common broadcloth. It is the impostor who is
magisterial, and puts on the airs of a Cagliostro.

Nostradamus is sometimes a pillar of fire, but oftener he is a pillar of
cloud. He is a past master in words, and depicts events with a terseness
that almost baffles parallel; but still his employment of these same
words is more practical than artistic, for he never rises to poetry. As
an accepted visionary he is perhaps less swayed by the imagination than
any man of at all kindred type that one can mention. With him words are
as often used to veil as to unfold his meaning. His contempt for simple
persons, the ignorant, is very broadly marked. Men of knowledge are to
constitute his audience; the heaven of prophecy is in his opinion a
region unfit for children. He, clean contrary to the example set

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

forth in St. Mark (x. 14), will suffer none such to approach him. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) He chiefly predicts the *evil* to come;
what is good only figures in his pages incidentally, and at long
intervals. But here it is to be observed that the staple of true
prophecy must always run parallel with that of history; whilst, as to
the latter, it has grown into an axiom, "Happy is the country that has
no history." He fatigues while he fascinates us amid the variety of his
combinations; yet a deeper examination will often end in clothing these
riddling and vext allusions in a magical and floating investment that
lifts them up into a calm sublimity.

Still he is clearly no prophet in the old and Hebrew sense of the
word--like Isaiah, Daniel, David, John,--a man who neither respects his
own person as regards its safety, nor the person of other men as regards
their position. You cannot say of him: "*Scimus quia verax es, non enim
respicis personam hominum*" (St. Matt. xxii. 16), which is the
test-touch all the world over of a true prophet. Le Pelletier's
summing-up is: *c'est un artiste en pronostics*. There is a Pythic ring
in all he writes and says; a sub-flavour, too, of cabalistic lore far
gathered from those ancient compromising books which he saw fit to burn.
The outward signs of his procedure and methods are palpably magical, as
set forth in the stanzas that open his first Century to the reader. If
we know that he professed Christian orthodoxy, equally we know that he
practiced judicial astrology, and made unquestionable use of the Pagan
ritual of incantation. These rites, uncomprehended by all the erudite in
books who wrote about them, were by the divines and fathers of the early
Church ignorantly attributed to prestidigitation, Toledan

art, and fraudulent compact with the sable fiend. Perhaps they may turn
out to have been merely natural excitations, empirically discovered,
tending to enable the subject of them more fully to reach a state of
semi-conscious ecstasy; to place the cerebral light in the current of
latent light that pervades all space (if such an expression be
permissible), and so elicit results that are ordinarily unattainable by
man. Bouys, who wrote in 1806, plainly considers him to have been a
clairvoyant. The animal magnetizers call him a *crisiaque*. Possibly all
these processes only served to place him in a position favourable to
clairvoyance; but on all this, respected and gentle reader, construct
your own opinion. Let the man be to you prophet, sorcerer, or
clairvoyant. Call him what you will, so you free him from the stigma of
impostor. M. le Pelletier's judgment as to that ought to be regarded as
final: "*L'ampleur de son génie, et la sureté inimaginable de son coup
d'æil, ne permettent guère de la croire*."

It has been well said that the man and his works are an enigma.
Everything in our author is ambiguous. the man, the thought, the style.
We stumble at every step in the rough paths of his labyrinth. Once we
enter, jeering voices seem to deride us from behind each stanza,
strophe, word. We try to interrogate, but grow silent before a man of
emotionless nerve and of impenetrable mask. What are these "Centuries?"
What is Nostradamus? In them and him all may find something; but no man
born of woman can find *all*. The Sphinx of France is here before us; a
riddler, riddling of the fate of men: a man at once bold and timid;
simple, yet who can plumb his depth? A superficial Christian, a Pagan
perhaps at heart; a man rewarded of kings: and yet, so far as we can
see, furnishing no one profitable hint to them that could make their
life run smoother, or remove a single peril from their path. His

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

leaves a book of things malign, written by one who, albeit, never spoke
a word that *à tous ne seroit agréable*. Behold this Janus of a double
face; his very breath is double; the essence of ambiguity lies wrapped
incarnate in him, and it moulds the man, the thought, the style.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4"></span>[3:1](oon05.htm#fr_4.md) The facts for this life are
taken, where no other reference is given, from a scarce work, entitled,
"La première face du Janus François, par Jean Aimes de Chavigny
Beaunois, 1594." It is found in the Library at Paris; but not in the
British Museum. Fortunately M. le Pelletier gives an almost literal
transcript of this "Brief discours sur la vie de M. Michel de
Nostredame."

<span id="fn_5"></span>[4:1](oon05.htm#fr_5.md) "Archives du Magnetisme
Animal," vol. viii. "Tous deux" (*i.e.* father and mother)
"appartenaient à une famille Juive," converted in the sixteenth century,
and of the tribe of Issachar ("Nouvelle Biog. Générale" \[Le Pelletier,
i. 16 n.\]).

<span id="fn_6"></span>[4:2](oon05.htm#fr_6.md) His grandfather, Moreri
tells us.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[7:1](oon05.htm#fr_7.md) Moreri assigns this to the
year 1525.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[7:2](oon05.htm#fr_8.md) He calls Scaliger in the
heyday of friendship "a Virgil in poetry, a Cicero in eloquence, a Galen
in medicine," and declares that to him he is indebted for his scientific
attainments ("Penny Cyclopædia," *s.v.* *Nostradamus*).

<span id="fn_9"></span>[12:1](oon05.htm#fr_9.md) "That the great bulk of
French society of his day was impressed by his effusions there can be no
doubt" (Chambers' "Book of Days," vol. ii., p. 13).

<span id="fn_10"></span>[12:2](oon05.htm#fr_10.md) Moreri says that nobody
knows what his report was.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[13:1](oon05.htm#fr_11.md) Garencières, as we have
shown, says Nostradamus dedicated the "Luminary Epistle" to Henri II. in
1557. M. le Pelletier holds (i. 10) that Henri II. never knew of the
dedicatory epistle written to him by name, and that, as the events
referred to do not concern the House of Valois, they could have had no
interest for him had he known of the epistle. M. le Pelletier adds a
most singular note to this remark, that the epistle is dedicated "*A
l'invictissime, très puissant, et très chrestien Henry Roy de France
Second*." This epigraph he maintains not to be addressed to Henri II.,
for he remarks that he was no longer alive when it made its appearance.
Now, this is not so; for the dedicatory letter was dated in print June
27, 1558, and the king's death only took place in 1559, so that the
document was even in print before his death. But, had it not been so,
there is no reason whatever why Nostradamus should not have supplied the
king with a copy of the letter and quatrains in manuscript long before
either of them had been committed to type. Jean de Roux, Curé de
Louvicamp, wrongly suggests that it was intended as a prophetical
dedication to Louis le Grand or XIV. M. le Pelletier thinks it was not
even dedicated to the great Henri Quatre, but to a "Henry, Roy de France
Second"--*second* being the Latin *secundus*, or prosperous, *i.e.* some
king not less illustrious than Henri Quatre, whose reign is to arise in
the future. This it is which furnishes to the reader the secret purpose
of Le Pelletier's book, which is to set forth the claims of the Due de
Bordeaux, who would have ascended the French throne as Henri Cinq.
Accordingly, in the body of the book, he has interpreted five quatrains
and one sixain of the prophecies of Nostradamus as referring to this
glorious King *Henri Second*, who has never arrived, and who, being now
some years dead, never can. We have seen that the Curé de Louvicamp
could even suppose that Louis XIV. could stand for "Henry, Roy de France
Second." M. F. Buget, in his "Étude sur Nostradamus," has the same idea,
that be does riot address Henri II., because he was not of a character
sufficiently great to merit the attribution of such spiritual authority
to him by our prophet, as if the flattery of a dedication was to be
interpreted *au pied de la lettre*. It could only be addressed, he
thinks to a really great man,--, a saint. M. Buget, in his book of 1862,
evidently was another of those who made the fatal error of interpreting
Nostradamus out of the future, instead of carefully following the
enigmas thrown out <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> by him to find their
fulfilment in the past. These gentlemen, if they had assiduously read
the Epistle itself, instead of consulting their imaginative faculties,
would have perceived plainly enough that Nostradamus was writing to the
only king he knew, before whom he had personally presented himself, and
whom, as he says, he had highly reverenced from "*iceluy jour que
premierement devant icelle je me presentay*." The concluding words of
the Dedication are equally plain, and show that he is addressing a king
whom he has individually seen with his own eyes: "depuis que mes yeux
jurent si proches de vostre splendeur solaire." All the rest is to be
set down to the strain of courtly flattery that was customarily
addressed to kings, then and down to a period full two hundred years
later, especially on occasion of penning royal dedications. The purpose
of this long note is to establish, once and for all, I trust, that
"*Henry, Roy de France Second*," stands, without any subtlety at all,
simply for King Henry II., and nothing more. It is vain to endeavour to
make millstones transparent that we may shoot unexpected rays of light
through them. They will answer their purpose by being left in the dark,
and will grind grain the better for it. Transparency will in such cases
represent frangibility.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[18:2](oon05.htm#fr_13.md) It was really in the
sixth month of his sixty-third year that he died.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[21:1](oon05.htm#fr_15.md) How any could have been
written in 1567, I know not, as Nostradamus died in 1566. But, however
this may be, there are twelve *Presages*, or one for each month
throughout the year 1567. The last one is that which we have already
given, as relating to his own death.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[21:2](oon05.htm#fr_16.md) The book was entitled,
"Les vies des plus célèbres et anciens poëtes provensaux, qui ont floury
du tems des comtes de Provence" (Lyon, 1575); a book still sought for,
and rather rare.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[26:1](oon05.htm#fr_17.md) "In 1566 died that
trifler, so famous throughout the world, Michael Nostradamus, who
boasted while he lived that he knew and could foretell future events by
the influence of the stars, in whose name afterwards many ingenious men
have put forth their imaginings, justifying him who said so aptly,
'Nostra damus,' etc."

<span id="fn_18"></span>[30:1](oon05.htm#fr_18.md) Bouys does the same for
Napoleon I.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[36:1](oon05.htm#fr_19.md) See the ban he utters in
Century VI., at the close--"*Barbari procul sunto*." He shows a quite
Horatian and heathen antipathy to the *profanam vulgus*.
