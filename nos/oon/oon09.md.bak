# Historical Fragments

I SHALL now give a few detached historical fragments that relate to
France, commencing with the Peace of Cateau-Cambresis, 1559, and running
down to the death of Louis XV., 1774, in chronological order, just as M.
le Pelletier has found the counterpart to lie embedded in the quatrains
of Nostradamus, in a fashion seemingly interpretable to him. This, for
any but French readers, will probably be sufficient to indicate the
style and value of the presages enveloped in the strange and fatidical
diction of the quatrains. I doubt not but that, by original research
instituted and by careful re-reading of the text throughout, a good many
more of the mysterious stanzas might be unravelled and elucidated; also
by collation of all that has been written by commentators on our author,
a good deal of light might be thrown upon what they have done, even
where their own interpretation has fallen short of clearness. All that
my book purposes to accomplish is,--at least for England,--to establish,
without doubt, and at once, for all future time, that Nostradamus is no
impostor, but, when rightly understood and unlocked, a very wonderful
anticipator of events to happen hereafter; and, farther than this, that
his works are, to all intents and purposes, the most startling oracles
ever put on paper by mortal man not professing divine inspiration. From
immemorial time instances of human prescience have occasionally been
manifested. The whole human race has an ardent and ingrain desire to
search into and anticipate futurity.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Very few
individuals, however, have from time to time been able to gratify and
keep alive their passion in this respect. But no one has done so in a
degree that at all sets him on a par with Nostradamus in the felicitous
and reiterated coruscations whereby he has anticipated the more
prominent points and epochs of time Future; and sometimes in minuteness
he even mentions by name some individual who emerges though it be but
for an instant from the general obscurity of his life.

THE PEACE OF CATEAU-CAMBRESIS (APRIL 3, 1559). \[I. 71.\]

Century IX.--*Quatrain* 52.

La paix s'approche d'un costé, et la guerre  
Oncques <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) ne fut la poursuitte si
grande:  
Plaindre hômes, femmes, sang innocent par terre,  
Et ce sera de France a <span id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md) toute bande.

Translation

Peace approaches on one side, and \[as to\] war  
Never was the pursuit of it so great:  
Men and women \[have cause\] to weep innocent blood on earth;  
All through France it shall be from end to end.

The peace was that concluded with Spain at Cateau-Cambresis, whilst the
war, carried on with such hot pursuit, was the civil conflict that raged
between Romanist and Calvinist. This it was made men and women lament
the blood spilt upon the earth in all parts of France, from north to
south.

DEATH OF HENRI 11. (JULY 10, 1559). \[I. 72.\]

Century I.--*Quatrain* 35.

Le lyon jeune le vieux surmontera  
En champ bellique par singulier duelle:<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>  
Dans cage d'or <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) les yeux lui
crevera,  
Deux classes <span id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md) une, <span
id="fr_56"></span>[3](#fn_56.md) puis mourir, mort cruelle.

Translation.

The young lion shall overcome the old  
On the field of war in single combat \[duelle\];  
He will pierce his eyes in a cage of gold.  
This is the first of two loppings, then he dies a cruel death.

Montgomery, who at the moment of the narrative bore the name of Captain
Coryes (Garencières, p. 25), afterwards became Earl of Montgomery,
overthrew Henri II. (le vieux lion) in the tournay-lists or duel, and
pierced him above the eye through the gilt visor of his helmet. This is
the first of the two blows that will destroy the dynastic tree of the
house of Valois. Henri II., wounded mortally, shall be the first to die
a violent death; whilst his son, Henri III., will be the second, who
fell by the hand of Jacques Clément.

August 1. 1589.

This is a very celebrated quatrain. It is found in the earliest edition
of the quatrains published at Lyons in 1555, containing merely 300
quatrains. It lifted Nostradamus into celebrity at once. He had applied
it to Henri II. several years before it happened, and had even announced
it as a prediction to the King himself. He was well known to Henri II.,
to whom he dedicated the last three Centuries, in a long and curious
epistle, which we have already given in full. The, King seems to have
had infinite confidence in Nostradamus, for he let him draw the royal
horoscope, as well as that of his two children, in 1556.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

The story of this is curious, as given by Guynaud in his "Concordance
des Prophéties de Nostradamus," 1712, <span
id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md) pp. 86-91. Henri II., it would seem,
proclaimed a tournament in the Rue St. Antoine, the site of the
Bastille, then in the country, for July 1, 1559, in honour of the
marriage of his daughter Elizabeth of France with Philip II. of Spain.
He listed himself as one against all comers. The joust being nearly over
and the sun setting, the Duc de Savoie begged him to quit the running,
as his side was already victorious; but the King wanted to break another
lance over it, and commanded the young Comte de Montgommeri, captain of
his Scotch Guard, to run a tilt in conclusion. He excused himself, but
the King insisted and grew angry. Of course the young man then obeyed,
put spurs to his horse, and struck the King upon the throat, below the
vizor. His lance shivered, and the butt raising the vizor, a splinter
wounded the King above the right eye, cutting several of the veins of
the *pia mater*. The King swooned. He lived on, however, for ten days in
terrible agony, as foretold in the prophecy, *Deux classes une, puis
mourir, mort cruelle*. Nostradamus styles both of them lions, as they
both fought under that device. The King wore a gilt helmet, so that the
*cage d'or* was literally fulfilled.

The strange part is that another astrologer, named Luc Gauric, had once
been visited by the King in company with two other gentlemen, to whom he
feigned to give precedence; but the astrologer, perhaps knowing him,
insisted on addressing him first, and told him he would die in a duel.
He also prophesied a violent death to the King's companions, and managed
to displease the whole trio. The King said of this, "We are making peace
now with the King of Spain, so it is not very likely that I shall
challenge him, and

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

as a king I could in no other way be challenged, whatever may be the
fate of the other gentlemen." Guynaud quotes this story from the
Princesse de Clèves, who, in the second volume of her writings,
represents the Court as discussing the credibility of astrologers, the
prevalent opinion apparently being rather strong against them. Still, we
know that Henri II. greatly honoured Nostradamus. Prophetic warning is
evidently futile, for the King had two separate warnings and heeded
neither.

PRINCESSE DE CLÈVES. \[II. 145.\]

Quelques jours après, le Roy étoit chez la Reine à l'heur du Cercle;
l'on parla des Horoscopes et des prédictions. Les opinions étaient
partagées sur la croyance que l'on y devoit dormer. La Reine y ajoûtait
beaucoup de foi; elle soûtint qu'après tant de choses qui avaient été
prédites, et que l'on avait vu arriver, on ne pouvait douter qu'il n'eut
quelque certitude dans cette science. D'autres soûtenaient, que parmi ce
nombre infini de prédictions, le pea qui se trouvaient veritables,
faisait bien voir que se n'etait qu'un effet du hazard.

"J'ai eu autrefois beaucoup de curiosité pour l'avenir," dit le Roy;
"mais on m'a dit tant de choses fausses et si peu vraissemblables que je
suis demuré convaincu que l'on ne peut rien savoir de véritable. Il y a
quelques années qu'il devint ici un homme d'une grande reputation dans
l'Astrologie. Tout le monde l'alla voir, j'y allai comme les autres,
mais sans lui dire qui j'étais, et je menai Monsieur de Guise et
Descars, je les fit passer le premier. L'Astrologue neanmoins s'addressa
d'abord à moi, comme s'il m'eut jugé le maitre des autres: Peut-être
qu'il me connaissait; cependant il me dit une chose qui ne me convenait
pas, s'il m'eut connu. Il me predit que je serai tué en duel. Il dit
ensuite à Monsieur de Guise, qu'il serait tué par derrière, et à
Descars, qu'il aurait la tête cassée d'un coup de pied de cheval.
Monsieur de Guise s'offensa quasi de cette prédiction, comme si l'on eut
accusé de devoir fuir. Descars ne fut guerre satisfait de trouver qu'il
devait finir par un accident si malheureux. Enfin nous sortimes tous
très malcontents de l'astrologue. Je ne scais cc qui arrivera à Monsieur
de Guise et à Descars, mais il n'y a guerre d'apparence que je sois tué
en duel. Nous venons de faire la paix le Roy d'Espagne et moi; quand
nous ne l'aurions pas faite, je doute que nous nous battions, et que je
le fisse appeller comme le Roy men père fit rappeller Charles Quint."

The story, as told by the Princesse de Clèves, is fuller than I have
given it, but does not correspond at all with the version

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

given to Lord Bacon when in France, as told to him by Dr. Penn, who said
(Bacon's "Essay on Prophecies") that the queen-mother, Catherine de
Medici, was given to curious arts, and caused the King's nativity to be
cast under a false name. The astrologer adjudged that he should be
killed in a duel. The queen laughed, supposing her husband to be above
challenges to duel; "but he was slain upon a course at tilt, the
splinters of the staff of Montgomery going in at his beaver." History,
in events large or small, hath so many variants that any man, whose view
of things is a little sinister, may well be allowed to say all history
is a variant of truth, and all that is sure in it is that it cannot be
relied upon at all. In this case the astrologers were right, spite of
the odds against them.

ARREST OF MONTGOMERY (May 27, 1574). \[I. 73.\]

Century III.--*Quatrain* 30.

Celuy qu'en <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) luitte <span
id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59.md) et fer au faict bellique  
Aura porté <span id="fr_60"></span>[3](#fn_60.md) plus grand qui luy le
prix,  
De nuict au lict six luy feront la pique,  
Nud, sans harnois, subit <span id="fr_61"></span>[4](#fn_61.md) sera
surprins. <span id="fr_62"></span>[5](#fn_62.md)

Translation.

To him who in strife and armour in the warlike field  
Shall have carried away the prize from one greater than himself,  
By night in bed six men will stab him;  
Unprotected he will be surprised naked and unarmed.

This means that Montgomery, who in joust (*au faict
bellique*,--*bellique*, we are told, means an engagement on horseback)
with lance in hand will have carried away the prize from Henri II.
(*plus grand que luy*) will be suddenly

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

surprised in bed at night, naked and unarmed, by six men, who will
deliver him into the vengeful hands of Catherine de Medici.

Some say the dying King gave him free pardon; others report that he fled
to England to save himself: but at any rate he came to England, and
there embraced Protestantism. When he returned to France, he placed
himself at the head of the revolted Huguenots in Normandy, and was
besieged in Domfront by the Marshal de Matignon and a large force, to
which he was obliged to surrender. The terms of the sur, render
guaranteed his life, but by express command of Catherine he was arrested
in his own castle of Domfront on the night of May 27, 1574, by six
gentlemen of the royal army, and carried to the Château of Caen, thence
to the Conciergerie at Paris, and there immured, where the great tower
still goes by his name.

THE REGENCY OF CATHERINE DE MEDICI (1559-1574). \[I. 74.\]

Century VI.--*Quatrain* 63.

La Dame seule au regne demeurée,  
D'unic esteint premier au lict d'honneur;  
Sept ans sera de douleur esplorée,  
Puis longue vie au regne par grand heur.

Translation.

The lady shall remain to rule alone,  
Her unique spouse dead, who was first in the field of honour.  
She will weep for grief through seven long years,  
And gifted with long life will reign long.

Catherine de Medici did not put off her weeds till. August 1, 1566,
seven years and a few days from the death of the King in July, 1559. on
her return from a progress with her son Charles IX., in the course of
which she had visited all the mutinous cities throughout the kingdom,
with a view to satisfy them. She survived till the year 1589, and
practically retained the whole power during the reigns of her

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

two eldest sons, François II. and Charles IX., but she entirely lost it
on the succession of Henri III.

The quatrain applies to no one so well as to Catherine de Medici; and,
if it be allowed to be realized as to her person, there is no denying
the singular exactitude of the prophecy. We have no evidence that the
Queen applied the quatrain to herself, or that her contemporaries bore
it in mind; but the second line is remarkable as assuming with reposeful
confidence the previous death of the King as predicted. The third line
is a startling example of the precision with which our prophet can mark
out the duration of a period: seven years the Queen is to wear mourning,
and she does so all the time she is travelling. The sceptical will say
she did it to fulfil the prophecy; but it looks rather as if that had
fallen quite out of remembrance, and as if it was due much more to
policy, and for the purpose of creating sympathy, during her state tour,
than to motives either of superstition or any singular attachment to her
deceased husband. The quatrain is most unobtrusively worded, and yet so
confidently assured and searching, that it seems to me, as if perfectly
unbiassed and disinterested observers might take it as a kind of moral
voucher for the simple integrity of its author. I merely draw attention
to it so far, and every reader will form his own judgment upon the
point. I hold myself aloof from theory; but this is how the particular
fact we are upon impresses my mind, and probably it may affect many
others in the same way.

EXTINCTION DES VALOIS (1559-1589). \[I. 77\]

Presage 40.

De maison Sept par mort mortelle suite;  
Gresle, tempeste, pestilent mal, fureurs:  
Roi d'Orient, d'Occident tous en fuite,  
Subjuguera ses jadis conquereurs.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

Translation.

The death of the house of seven by a suite of deaths.  
Hail, tempest, pestilence evil, fury.  
A king of the East will put all the West to flight,  
And will subdue his at-one-time conquerors.

The house of Valois consisted of the seven children of Henri II. By the
death of the fourth son, Henri III., in 1589, the whole of the seven
were dead except Marguerite, who married Henri IV., so that the family
may well be said to have died out by a suite of deaths (*mortelle
suite*). Heresy was rampant (*pestilent mal*) and civil war. Soliman
II., called the Magnificent, threatened all Christendom, and recovered
all the Holy Places that the Crusaders had wrested from his
predecessors.

CIVIL WAR (1575, 1576). \[I. 78.\]

Century VI.--*Quatrain* 11.

Des septs rameaux à trois seront reduicts,  
Les plus aisnés seront surprins <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) par
mort,  
Fratricider les deux seront seduicts  
Les conjurés en dormans seront morts.

Translation.

The seven branches when they shall be reduced to three,  
And the four eldest shall have been surprised by death,  
The two (males) shall entertain fratricidal aims,  
And the conspirators sleeping shall be reduced to death.

This means that, when the seven are become but three (*i.e.* the three
youngest), Henri III. and the Due d'Alençon will enter upon a
fratricidal war. In 1575 Alençon escaped from the Court, where he was
under surveillance, and put himself at the head of the Malcontents, who
were in alliance with the Huguenots. He was successful, and forced the
edict of pacification, May 14, 1576, upon his brother the King.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Daniel, in his
"History of France" under Henri III., shows that they mutually sought
each other's death by dagger and poison. The Guise (*les conjurés*) and
the Leaguers will come by their deaths from indulging in a false
security.

THE MURDER OF HENRI III. (1589). \[I. 79.\]

Century V.--*Quatrain* 67.

Quand chef Perouse n'osera sa tunique,  
Sans au couvert tout nud s'expolier. <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md)  
Seront prins <span id="fr_65"></span>[2](#fn_65.md) sept, faict
aristocratique!  
Le père et fils morts par poincte au colier.

Translation.

When the chief of Perouse dare not risk casting off his tunic  
Without stripping himself entirely naked,  
The last of the seven taken, what an event in the upper circles!  
Father and son killed by a stab in the throat.

When Sixtus V. (*chef de Perouse*) will not dare to excommunicate Henri
III., having already lost England in 1534, and feeling he must not be
entirely stripped by a further Gallican schism, will be rid of the
posterity of Henri II. (*seront Prins sept*) by a tremendous event in
aristocratic circles. Father and son will both perish by a thrust in the
throat.

DEATH OF THE GUISE (DECEMBER 23, 24, 1588). \[I. 80.\]

Century IV.--*Quatrain* 60.

Les sept enfans en hostaine <span id="fr_66"></span>[3](#fn_66.md)
laissés;  
Le tiers <span id="fr_67"></span>[4](#fn_67.md) viendra son enfant
trucider <span id="fr_68"></span>[5](#fn_68.md);  
Deux par son fils seront d'estoc percés;  
Gennes Florence les viendra enconder. <span
id="fr_69"></span>[6](#fn_69.md)

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

Translation.

Seven children will be left in his house;  
The *tiers état* will come to murder his child;  
Two will have been pierced by the sword of his son;  
Genoa and Florence will come to disorder them.

This is, Henri II. at his death will leave seven children in his house.
The *Conseil des Seize* (*le tiers*) will incite Jacques Clément to go
to St. Cloud to assassinate Henri III., because he has caused Henri de
Guise and the Cardinal to be slain by sword thrusts. Then Charles
Emmanuel I., Duke of Savoy (*le Génois*), and Alexander Farnese, Duke of
Parma (*le Florentin*), General of Philip II., will come to make war on
Henri IV., who will be compelled by Farnese to raise the siege of Paris
(1590) and Rouen (1592) with precipitation.

Parma was, originally, of Etruscan foundation (Bouillet, "Dictionnaire
d'Histoire" *s.v.* Parme), and in this respect rises above Florence, the
capital of Modern Tuscany. This justifies Nostradamus in designating the
Duke of Parma as *Florence*. Genoa, by synecdoche, may stand for Savoy,
as being its more commercial emporium.

BURIAL AT ST. DENIS OF THE LAST OF THE VALOIS (1589-1610). \[I. 82.\]

Century I.--*Quatrain* 10.

Serpens <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md) transmis en la cage de fer  
Où les enfans septains du Roy sont pris,  
Les vieux et peres sortiront bas <span id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_71.md) de
l'enfer, <span id="fr_72"></span>[3](#fn_72.md)  
Ains mourir voir de fruict mort et cris.

Translation.

The coffin being lowered behind the grille of iron,  
Where the seven children of the King are buried,  
The ancestors of the Valois will rise from the depths of the tomb,  
And cry out to see their withered fruit thus die.

 

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

Henri III. was deposited, provisionally, in 1589, at Compiègne, in the
Abbey of St. Corneille; and it was only in 1610 that his body was
conveyed to the vaults of St. Denis, at the same time with the bodies of
Henry IV. and Catherine de Medici. This quatrain is not very remarkable,
but the interpretation hangs pretty well together. It has perhaps this
value, that it shows us one incident in a vast procession of historical
dissolving views that seem to have passed before the eye of Nostradamus,
and one would say in chronological sequence, which he must himself have
broken up purposely afterwards, fearing that the chronological clue
would often render the prophecy too open to interpretation to be good
for either his own safety or the public advantage.

MARRIAGE OF FRANÇOIS II. AND MARY STUART (APRIL 24, 1558). \[I. 84.\]

Century X.--*Quatrain* 39.

Premier fils vefve <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md) malheureux
marriage,  
Sans nuts enfants, deux Isles en discord,  
Avant dix-huict incompetant age. <span id="fr_74"></span>[2](#fn_74.md)  
De l'autre près <span id="fr_75"></span>[3](#fn_75.md) plus bas sera
l'accord.

Translation.

The eldest son leaves, with his wretched marriage,  
Widow, no children, and two isles in strife,  
And dies before eighteen, incompetent of age.  
The younger son will marry earlier still. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[4](#fn_76.md)

The matter seems to stand thus. François II., eldest son of Henri II.,
shall die and leave his wife, Mary Stuart, a widow without children,
after an unhappy marriage that extends

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

over less than two years, before he is eighteen, or of competent age.
The particularity of this detail is wonderful, and far more like history
than prophecy, except as to the brevity with which it is expressed. His
enunciations amount to hints only, but they are so pregnant that, when
you fill in the indispensably connected particulars, the statement reads
like history. So here the instant you recognize that François II. is the
subject of the lines, you refer to history for his birth and death,
January 19, 1543, December 15, 1560--that is, 17 years, 10 months, and
15 days, or a month and 15 days short of 18 years. *Avant dix-huict* is
Nostradamus's phrase. Again, his death establishes discord between
Elizabeth of England and Mary of Scotland (*deux Isles en discord*).
Charles IX., his younger brother, was affianced to Elizabeth of Austria
when still younger, at eleven years of age, though he did not marry till
twenty. This is how M. le Pelletier harmonizes the line. But, as
affiancing is not marriage, this cannot have any affinity at all with
marrying at an incompetent age. I should propose to read the line thus.
Of the younger one afterwards, and lower down, will the concordance,
account, or accord be given; and accordingly we shall have now to enter
upon several stanzas that relate to Charles IX.

CHARLES IX. (*Le roi farouche*). (1560-1574). \[I. 86.\]

Century III.--*Quatrain* 66.

Le grand Baillif d'Orleans mis a mort  
Sera par un de sang vindicatif:  
De mort mérité ne mourra ni par sort;  
Des pieds et mains mal le faisoit captif.

Translation.

The great Bailiff of Orleans shall be put to death  
By one of vindictive blood:  
Not undeserved death shall he die, nor by fate;  
For they will insecurely make him captive by feet and hands.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

Jérôme Groslot shall be arrested November 9, 1561, and condemned by the
Inquisition to beheadal for delivering the city to the Calvinists. But
he will not suffer the death merited, nor undergo his fate; his keepers
being bribed, he shall escape.

DEFECTION OF ADMIRAL COLIGNY (1559-1567). \[I. 87.\]

Century VI.--*Quatrain* 75.

Le grand pillot <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md) par Roy sera
mandé <span id="fr_78"></span>[2](#fn_78.md)  
Laisser la classe <span id="fr_79"></span>[3](#fn_79.md) pour plus haut

Barbare armée viendra. Venise craindre. <span
id="fr_81"></span>[5](#fn_81.md)

Translation.

He who shall have been appointed admiral by the king,  
Shall leave the fleet to take a higher post;  
Seven years later, shall take the opposite side to the king;  
Venice shall dread an army of barbarians coming.

Gaspard de Coligny, made grand-admiral by Henri II., in 1552, shall quit
the fleet in 1559, on the death of the King, and place himself at the
head of the Calvinist party. In 1562 he will be general of their forces,
and in 1567--that is, seven years after withdrawal from the fleet, he
will head the rebellion in the civil war. At the same moment Venice will
dread the armies of Selim Il., that will wrest Cyprus from her in 1570.
The peace between the Catholics and Protestants was signed at St.
Germain in this very year. The Venetians, however, in this year gained
the naval victory of Lepanto over the Turks in 1570.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

MURDER OF LOUIS DE BOURBON, PRINCE OF CONDE  
(MARCH 13, 1569). \[I. 88.\]

Century III.--*Quatrain* 41.

Bossu sera esleu par le conseil:  
Plus hideux monstre en terre n'apperceu.  
Le coup voulant crevera l'œil <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md)  
Le traistre au Roy pour fidelle receu.

Translation.

Crookback shall be elected by the council:  
A more hideous monster never seen on earth.  
An intentional shot pierces the eve of the traitor  
Who had sworn to be faithful to the king.

Prince Louis of Condé, the Humpback, shall be elected general-in-chief
by the council of notables of the Calvinists. Such a monster of
wickedness was never seen on earth. Montesquiou killed him with a
pistol-shot in the eye, who had twice escaped from his treasonous
practices against the King. Here Nostradamus' forecast is miraculously
clear, although it has baffled Guynaud to find its concordance with
events. He here also exhibits his religious partisanship, A hunchback is
always considered to be morally as well as physically deformed; and, as
Louis de Bourbon took the side of the Calvinists, he became at once to
our prophet le plus hideux monstre en terre. Evidently, however, he was
a grand fighting fellow, and spent his life in camps, if we go no
further than Moreri for his history. He was condemned for a conspirator
in 1560 to lose his head. But the sentence was never carried out, as
King François II. died at the moment, and none was bold enough to see to
it. When Charles IX. set him at liberty, the *Cour des Pairs* found out
that he was innocent, and declared him so. He perished at the battle of
Jarnac. He had his leg broken by

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

the kick of a horse, and was seated at the foot of a bush when
Montesquiou, captain of the Duke of Anjou's guards, saw him, and, for
some old pique, coolly, but like the veriest coward, shot the wounded
Condé in the eye with his pistol. The body was conveyed for burial to
St. George of Vendôme, either by chance or insult, on the back of a she
ass, at Jarnac; which led to one of those impromptu epitaphial epigrams
that the French turn so prettily:

L'an mil cinq cens soixante neuf,  
Entre Jarnac et Chateauneuf,  
Fut porté mort sur une ânesse  
Le grand ennemi de la Messe.

Translation.

The savage king, when he shall have tried  
His blood-stained hand with fire, sword, and bows,  
All the people shall be terrified  
To see the great hung by the neck and feet.

When Charles IX. shall exercise his sanguinary hand with fire, the
sword, and the arquebus, the people will be horrified to see the great
Calvinist lords strung up by the neck and feet. One of the savage
amusements of Charles, in hunting, was to cut off at a single blow the
heads of any asses or pigs he came across on the way. During the very
massacre he placed himself at a window of the Louvre and took several
shots with a long arquebus at the Huguenots

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

who fled from the other side of the Seine in the Faubourg St. Germain.
The body of Coligny was dragged by the populace, at the end of a rope,
through all the mud of the kennels, and then hung up by one foot to the
gibbet at Montfaucon. This 24th of August fell on a Sunday. The King
himself died two years after, with some suspicion of poisoning. He is
said to have been a man of high courage and of a lively, quick wit,
possessing a good share of eloquence; was given much to dissimulation;
and full of oaths, unreasonably violent, and without self-control. He
turned a verse well, and loved hunting. His poems still remain, but I do
not know they can ever command a single reader. In speaking of poets, he
used to say they ought to be well fed, like good horses, but not
satisfied, or they become lazy. The world in general prefers to starve
them if they are first-rate, and enrich them if they are second-rate. We
cannot expect people to reward what they cannot understand: though
inevitable, we cannot but deplore the arrangement. With good abilities,
Charles had so little judgment that his actions would always have been
mischievous; the best thing that could have happened was his death at
twenty-four. He is said to have remarked, when dying, that he was glad
to die young and have no children, for he had sadly learnt, in his own
case, how miserable is the conduct of a prince who mounts the throne a
child, and so governs through the ministry of others. This only shows a
little recovery to sober reason, but none of the remorse that is
attributed to him on his death-bed, as being the ostensible author of
the blackest act that has ever disfigured Christianity or stained
Europe. In perfidy and crime it cannot be surpassed, nor as the outcome
of religious perversion. The crimes of an atheistic democracy,
perpetrated two hundred years later on the same theatre precisely, have
only been able to surpass

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

it, in the carnal lusts exhibited, in the inhuman degradation of the
body of man, and in the ubiquity of iniquity, when the whole people are
thirsting to satiate their debased passions in sin. Nostradamus has
elsewhere called Paris the City of the Sword. It is the wine-press of
the earth, fat with the blood of man: Lutetia of mud and blood.
Haussmann rebuilt it, but nothing can cleanse it. Their very guillotine
is an instrument contrived to publicly gratify the populace in its
tiger-taste for the reek of blood in the streets of the City of Blood.
If you wish to see the disgrace of religion, read Sully's description of
the endeavour of the ferocious priests on that day to have *his* blood.
Look also on the medal of Gregory XIII., <span
id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md) struck rejoicingly to commemorate that
awful crime. Bonanni shows it; and, as a work of medallic art, the head
of the Pope is of the very highest order of beauty and Italian grace.
But, then, it commemorates the blood of sixty thousand victims, he says.
Ranke (ii. 69) puts

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

it at fifty thousand. Take this number, if you like; it is, enough to
satisfy the successor to St. Peter, to whom the special mandate was
addressed, "Feed my sheep,"--as other shepherds do for the butcher, is
the Gregorian gloss. Trades. men, however, have the decency to shut the
shambles on the Sunday morning; but the *servus servorum* is at home in
his ministrations on the Dominical day. That Sunday in August is indeed
a Saints' rubric! For that day there is no need of a calendar. Time,
till the world ruptures, can never forget it,--nor forgive.

Le noir farouche of this quatrain is, by Guynaud, p. 113, said to stand
for Admiral Coligny, who is designated, according to him, very variously
in the quatrains. The *noir farouche* alludes to his rough and
forbidding exterior. *Le grand Pillot* (VI. 75) is another epithet; *le
tiran* (Présage III.) another. The conclusion of the quatrain is
admitted, both by Le Pelletier and Guynaud, to stand for Coligny. In the
earlier portion, most will, I think, prefer to take *noir* as the
anagram of *Roi*.

Guynaud gives a surprising account from the historians of Provence and
France, of what happened to Coligny when he was at Angoulême in 1568. He
set up a gibbet there, and on his own authority hanged upon it Michel
Grêlet, Guardian of the Cordéliers, and a most zealous preacher against
the heretics. In his dying speech on the scaffold, the latter said,
"Admiral, you put me to death very unjustly. I am going to God now to
give account to Him of my actions; but remember, you and all the people
present here to-day, I predict that in a short time you will yourself be
thrown from an upper window, and your body will be cut to pieces." The
histories go on to say that an Italian cut off Coligny's head to send it
to Cardinal de Lorraine at Rome, whilst other men cut off his hands and
other parts of his body;

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

also that at about six in the morning the mob found his body on a
dunghill in a stable, dragged it to the Seine, and threw it in. It was
again fished out, and hung by the foot to the gibbet of Montfaucon,
where it became blackened in the smoke of the fires that were lighted
below it. (Guynaud, "Concord. Nostra.," p. 113.)

Sixain 52. \[I. 90.\]

La grand' Cité qui n'a pain à demy  
Encor un coup la Sainct Barthelemy  
Engravera au profond de son ame:  
Nismes, Rochelle, Geneve et Montpellier,  
Castres, Lyon, Mars entrant au Belier,  
S'entrebattront; le tout pour une Dame.

Translation.

The great city that has bread at only half rations  
Will have the further blow of Saint Bartholomew  
Cut deep into its soul:  
Nismes, Rochelle, Geneva, and Montpellier,  
Castres, Lyons, with Mars entering the Ram,  
Will fight one another; and all for the Queen mother.

The great city is, of course, Paris, and une Dame is the Queen,
Catherine de Medici. It has to be borne in mind that these sixains were
not published till thirty-three years after the massacre of St.
Bartholomew's. Naturally, the prediction loses all special authority in
this case. It raises, however, a singular question: Why, if it was
written after the event, it was not rendered more explicit, if those who
published it had an interest in augmenting the fame of the prophet? It
looks very much as if the testamentary duties were performed in perfect
good faith, mechanically, and without even understanding the purport or
meaning of the words.

Another passage relating to St. Bartholomew's massacre occurs in the
text of 1605, and its authority is no greater than

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

that of the sixain just quoted, as it was not published till after the
event. It goes, however, to strengthen the remark I above made. Those
who caused the work to be printed seem to have been perfectly
unconscious of the meaning of the stanzas; they regarded the whole
procedure as a mere form of respect to the memory of a celebrated
relative. Their duty was clear to them, and they performed it; but the
writings were to them perfectly unintelligible.

Presage III. (ii. 252) is dated as if written January, 1555 and for
anything that I can see there is nothing whatever to make one doubt but
that it was so. Having made this point as clear as I can, the reader
will take it or reject it as he pleases.

Le gros airain qui les heures ordonne,  
Sur le trespas du Tyran cassera: <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md)  
Pleurs, plaintes et cris, eaux, glace pain ne dônc  
V. S. C. <span id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_88.md) paix l'arme passera.

Translation.

The brazen bell that rings the daily hours  
Will play full volley at the tyrant's death:  
Tears, cries, and groans; the waters freeze up bread,  
With son of Charles the Fifth a peace is made.

The tyrant here is interpreted by Guynaud (p. 107) a. Coligny, and he
appends some interesting remarks from Favin's "Histoire de Navarre,"
touching St. Bartholomew's Day In Paris. He says they marked the
lodgings of the Huguenots that they might know where to find them in the
hurry, and it was arranged that at the tocsin of the great bell at the
palace, as well as that of the church of St. Germain de l'Auxerrois,
they were to lay violent hands (*mainbaisse*)

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

on all the heretics. Two p.m. was the hour appointed. The Catholics who
went into the street were to distinguish themselves by a white cross
upon their hats. The bodies of the slain were for the most part thrown
into the river. Mezerai records that the queen-mother hastened the
signal by a full hour, and that it was, contrary to arrangement, started
by the bell of St. Germain de l'Auxerrois, although that was immediately
followed up by the big bell of the palace.

Coligny was slain in bed, and flung out of window in his shirt only. His
face, being covered with blood, the Duc de Guise coolly wiped it with
his handkerchief, to assure himself that it actually was Coligny. We
shall shortly see this bloodthirsty villain himself murdered at Blois.

The massacre continued the whole week through, for seven days that is,
but the chief fury had spent itself by Tuesday night. The Janus Gallicus
professes, though how Aimé could have any certainty of it I cannot tell,
that Nostradamus, by *tyran*, alludes to Coligny, and says that the bell
tolled so long that it broke. The quatrain does not necessitate the
supposal of any such thing, and I believe the fact is not elsewhere
recorded. Of course, if it be, it would be so literal a fulfilment that
all the sceptical world would immediately take advantage of what I have
pointed out, that this is a prophecy *après coup*. If so doing should
rejoice anybody, I can only say that he has my consent. My business is
to put the facts, without a shred of disguise, before the reader; he can
weave them into theories for himself. If I at any time manifest what I
think, he will be pleased to accept it merely as a contribution towards
the same end.

In January, 1572, the river Seine was frozen over for a long time, and
the roads became almost impassable. This *may* perhaps be thought to
interpret *eaux glace pain ne* 

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

dône, with such hieroglyphic symbolism of scarcity as oracular utterance
delights in. It is pretty certain that provisions did not enter Paris
that winter with their usual flow. In allusion to the army mentioned,
Guynaud says that the Duc d'Anjou marched with fifty thousand men to the
siege of Rochelle, where, after firing thirteen thousand shots, they at
last effected a breach. What they battered down, oddly enough, was the
Boulevard of the Gospel (*Boulevard de l'Évangile*), but they could not
storm it, and lost twenty thousand men without taking the place.

In that eulogium on Catherine de Medici which de Brantôme ("Panthéon
Littéraire," ii. 116) calls her Life, he relates that she died of a
broken heart, from grief at having consented to the massacre on this
ill-starred day, and that without intending it she (p. 133) had invited
the nobles and lords of the land to gather to it. The Cardinal de
Bourbon said to her, "Madam, you have brought us all to the butchery
without intending it." This touched her to the quick; she took to her
bed and never left it again. One can only say this does not quite accord
with Mezerai and her sounding the tocsin an hour earlier by
anticipation. Further, as the massacre took place in 1572, and the
queen-mother did not die at Blois till 1589, seventeen years after, her
heart resisted grief much as granite does vinegar. The lady must
originally have possessed a very good heart. De Brantôme says poison was
talked of; but he considers the broken heart more likely.

CIVIL WAR UNDER HENRI III. (1559-1589). \[I. 93.\]

Century III.--*Quatrain* 55.

En l'an qu'un œil en France regnera  
La Cour sera en un bien fascheux trouble:  
Le Grand de Blois son amy tuera;

Translation.

In the year when a one-eyed man shall reign in France  
The Court shall be in very vexatious trouble:  
The great one of Blois shall kill his friend;  
The Kingdom, plunged into evil and doubt, shall divide in two.

M. le Pelletier's version here seems to be a little forced. The one-eyed
man he makes to be Henri II., whose eye was destroyed by Montgomery's
lance. The Court is to be in great embarrassment. Henri III. (*le Grand
de Blois*) will convoke at that place the States-General, and will there
assassinate the Duc de Guise, first taking with him, in Italian fashion,
the Holy Communion, as a sign of entire reconciliation, Then the
desolated kingdom will divide into two camps--the Royalists on one side,
and the Leaguers On the other.

REGENCY OF CATHERINE DE MEDICI (1537-,574). \[I. 94.\]

Translation.

The holy widow shall receive news  
Of the difficulties that perplex and trouble her children;  
He whom she calls home to quiet disturbances  
Shall bring them to a crisis by his pursuit of shaven heads.

There is a little difficulty in applying the epithet *saincte* to the
queen-mother, and Garencières supposes it to signify

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

Roma la Santa; but, if so, the rest will have no meaning, Nostradamus is
so entirely for Henri II., his wife, and the Romish Church, that in
spite of his designating her son *le roi farouche*, he might think the
term saincte not inappropriate to her. She sent a private despatch to
her son, Henri III., to hurry back from Poland, as we shall see him
doing in the next quatrain cited, that he may take the direction of the
French Government. He enters into an alliance with Henri IV. and the
Huguenots to counterbalance the Catholic League. Thence follows the
murder of the Cardinal, brother of the Duc de Guise, who was murdered by
the King's order on December 24,1588, one day after his brother. This is
the prosecution of the Church (*pourchas des razes*), coupled with the
repression of the League, which culminates the crisis. The only jarring
word in this concordance, when once it is comprehended, lies in the word
*saincte*, to which I have already drawn attention, and which may be
explained by the devotion felt by Nostradamus to the crown of France and
to Rome. It is evident that Brantôme was able to regard her as a most
admirable and lovable lady. The tocsin and the blood spoil our
appreciation.

HENRI III. RENOUNCES POLAND (JUNE 26, 1574). \[I. 96.\]

Translation.

The great gambler <span id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_99.md) shall complain and
weep  
To have elected him: deceived in his age:  
The duke had no desire to stay with them:  
He will be slain by men of his own tongue.

Poland, then, will deplore having elected the Duc d'Anjou n 1573, for he
stayed only one year with them, and absconded on the 26th of June at
night, at his mother's summons, to France. The Comte de Fanchin, the
Grand Chamberlain, was sent after him, and overtook him at Piesna, a
frontier town in Austria, but the duke was deaf to all intercession
(Guynaud, p. 119). He never took the Polish throne because he wished it,
but because he was pressed by the Court of France; and now French
affairs called him back. Guynaud thinks that the last line means that
his friends deceived him into taking it; but this is because he did not
discover the Latin meaning in *deceu*. For certainly Nostradamus meant
that he would go home to die by Clement's hand, as he shows in as many
words a little later on. Guynaud says that Poland had been deceived as
to the prince's age, and that he was represented to be much older than
he really was.

EDICT OF POITIERS (OCTOBER 3, 1577). \[I. 97.\]

Century V.--*Quatrain* 72.

Pour le plaisir d'edict voluptueux,  
On mestera le poison dans la foy:  
Venus sera en cours si vertueux, <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md)  
Qu'obfusquera du soleil tout aloy. <span id="fr_101"></span>[2](#fn_101.md)

Translation.

To pass an edict of a sugared sort,  
They'll mingle poison with our holy faith:  
And Venus darken, in her course robust,  
All law and light from out the sacred Sun.

The Sun, in Nostradamus, often stands for the Church or Christianity, by
him believed to be within the palisade of Popery. It might also mean
France, whose King's name was *Rex Christianissimus*. Louis XIV. assumed
the device of the sun, with the motto *nec pluribus impar*. Venus stands
for sensual pleasure--the world triumphant over the Church. The edict of
Poitiers, October 8, 1577, So far favoured the Protestants that they
were authorized to hold public services on the reformed footing.
Calvinist ministers might marry, and auricular confession was
suppressed. Thus did Henri III. mingle the poison of unchastity, etc.,
with the Catholic faith. The licence of morals (*Vénus*)

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

became unbridled and tarnished the law of Christendom (*Soleil*).

Guynaud interprets with Le Pelletier in this, and considers the poison
to consist particularly in freeing the Huguenots from the Sacrifice of
Penance; in condemning the monastic orders; in encouraging unchastity,
by allowing the Calvinist ministers to marry; in abandoning confession.
*Vénus sera* is a line showing that many monks will quit the cloisters
to indulge in marriage and other debauchery. The last line may be
understood, that the glory of the King will be tarnished, and make him
to be ill thought of by the Catholics; or that it will obscure faith in
the Church (p. 122).

JOURNÉE DES BARRICADES (MAY 12, 1588). \[I. 98.\]

Century III.--*Quatrain* 50.

La republique de la grande cité  
A grand rigueur ne voudra consentir:  
Roy sortir hors par trompette cité,  
L'eschelle an mur la cité repentir.

Translation.

The Republic of the great city (Paris)  
Would not submit itself to the very rigorous treatment;  
The King summoned by trumpet to quit the city,  
Which is called to repent by the ladder at the wall.

This quatrain and the event it prefigures are alike wonderful.
Garencières is much puzzled over it. What city has a commonwealth? Is it
Venice, Genoa, Geneva, Luca? He cannot tell. However, the "great city"
in Nostradamus almost always stands for Paris. The League, mistress in
Paris, would not submit to the coercive measures of Henri III., and by a
call to arms--perhaps the old tocsin of St. Germain de l'Auxerrois
sounding the while--told him, as *par trompette*, he had better quit the
city with all speed. Trial and

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

sentence in one word, "Take yourself off,"--for the first time uttered
to a king of the race Capetian, in some eight hundred years of history.
Later on, the drumming and trumpeting crack-brained citizens, with
nothing about them to be called sane but their river, will feel
themselves called to repentance when the escalading ladders are laid by
Henri III. to the wall.

 

Let it be noted now that this *Day of the Barricades* is very
remarkable, and, as such, is not to be found at all in Bohn's "Index of
Dates." It was, however, repeated in the civil war of the Fronde, August
26, 1648; in the three days' war, July 27, 28, 29, 1830, that set
Philippe Citoyen on his rickety perch; and again in June 23, 1848. But
close on two hundred years after, in 1789, when the philosophic Republic
was at hand and the Bastille was taken; when another Capet was to be
handled by the mob; offering *cul pour tête* to the admiration of a wise
world, then was to be best discerned the result of this first reaction
from St. Bartholomew's Day; pretty well that tocsin of treason has rung
alarum to a world on fire. A further curious analogy demands attention
here. The Popes of Rome were the earliest patrons of the principle of
regicide, and Clément the monk, whom we shall soon introduce, was the
first to practise it; here we see the Catholic League to be the first
organized body to repudiate kingship, to set up a republican form, and
consecrate a day to revolt and insurrection, which has become memorable
in history for ever, though forgotten by Bohn, as *la Journée des
Barricades*. But what shall we say of this forecast by Nostradamus,
fifty-three years before the event happened? He is, I think, the first
who ever put in type the word *Republic* as representative of rebellion
and revolt, throughout the modern world. But here we have it,--the dough
of

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

prophecy made out of the ground wheat-seed of time, and baked by the
oven of events into the bread of history; not Walpole's lies, nor the
principles, mostly false, that philosopher Hume finds so cleverly for
us, but the facts divested of motive.--like a petrified coral. reef of
insect humanities concreted into permanence and solidity by the death of
myriads. For those who can see, it lies all contained in that linear
rune, *La république de la grande cité*.

MURDER OF THE DUC DE GUISE (DECEMBER 23, 1588). \[I. 99.\]

Century III.--*Quatrain* 51.

Paris conjure un grand meutre commetre,  
Blois le fera sortir en plein effect:  
Ceux d'Orleans voudront leur chef remettre;  
Angers, Troye, Langres leur feront un meffait.

Translation.

Paris conspires to commit a great murder;  
Blois will carry it into full effect:  
The Orléanois will try to place a Leaguer at their head;  
Angers, Troye, Langres will try and undo this.

Henri III. at Paris contrived the murder of the Duc de Guise, who had
incited and led the Parisians on the day of the Barricades, when Henri
was compelled to fly to Chartres. Henri de Lorraine, Duc de Guise, was
murdered the day after the Cardinal, his brother, had been, at the
Convention of the Estates at Blois. The murder took place at the Chateau
de Blois. The Orléanois, on learning this, rose against Balzac
d'Entragues, the governor of the town, and set Charles de Lorraine,
Chevalier d'Aumale, at their head,--he was one of the chiefs of the
League,--whilst Angers, Troyes, and Langres took the side of Henri III.
It is not very easy, says Le Pelletier, to distinctly prove the exact
position taken up by these three towns, but Nostradamus habitually puts
a part to stand for the whole. In

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

the divided interests various cities took differing sides. At the time
he wrote there was nothing to show that such internecine separations
would take place. He clearly anticipated them, and, so far, is
absolutely right. We cannot, it seems, prove him to be right in all the
details; but equally, there is nothing to show him wrong.

The King shall be troubled by the Queen-mother,

The Guise will act for both his brothers dead,  
The two whom envy, hatred, malice slew.

Henri III. will be troubled by the response of Catherine de Medici, who
disapproves of the murder of the Guise; the deputies (*ambassadeurs*)
from both Paris and Blois, make lively remonstrance at the peril of
their lives. The Duc de Mayenne (*le Grand*), when proclaimed chief of'
the League, will take the title of Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom,
and, as if doubled in authority, will represent his two brothers, Henri
de Guise and the Cardinal de Lorraine, whom the envy, hatred, and malice
of Henri III. and his Court had assassinated. We seem to have here a
republic tempered by daggers, in place of what followed, a tyranny
tempered with epigrams. This active forging of daggers, knives, and
sword-cutlery in France, to carve out an idol of a republic, with its
bloodstained heathen Phrygian cap;

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

taken together with its repetition sixty years later, in the Barricades
of the Fronde, August, 1648, was clearly generating the poison and
concentrating its venom for the most startling act of death known to
mankind, but one, in all history,--at Whitehall, on that wintry 30th of
January, 1649,--the venom, that by the subtle inoculation of a Raleigh
could, for a time, strike silly such a soul as Milton's--"Psalmist of
Paradise,"--who, but for this damned virus in the world, might have
taught men how to realize a paradise on earth.

There's powder on the tower for captives then,  
Three brothers perish; this death takes the last.

Henri III., in his camp at St. Cloud, will be struck by the hand of a
young monk,--*Joyne* might easily be a misprint for *Moyne*. Jacques
Clément was twenty-five. He came straight from receiving the Communion
(*non loin de Pasque*). He thought he did God service (*confusion*); he
struck him in the lower bowel with a knife. The crime will be committed
when the Parisians are cut off (*captifs*) by the King beleaguering, and
his vengeance is ready to fall upon

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

their ramparts. This murder completes the violent deaths of the three
sons, the issue of Henri II. and Catherine de Medici.

There is no occasion to call attention to the remarkable lucidity of
this forecast, when once the linguistic difficulties of its conveyance
have been studiously solved. The demilune towers projecting at intervals
from the wall, as at the Haute Ville, Boulogne, well enough represent
the *husne*, or tower of vantage, in the quatrain, they need but a
shield or belvidere added.

DEATH OF HENRI III. (AUGUST 2, 1589). \[I. 103.\]

Translation.

The twice King dies, by Clement hand is slain;  
War and revolt make the year pestilent.  
Hold who hold can, the great oppose not well,  
Live laughter down and teach the cavillers.

This is a most singular prophecy. Henri III., King, first of Poland then
of France is quaintly called *Roy-Roy*. *Le Doux* is an excellent
synonym for *Clément*, all must admit. The year was harassed by civil
and religious war, and the Leaguers (*les esmues*) begin to grow anxious
about the consequences. Let Henri IV. hold hard his own, the lilied
sceptre: "Let Curzon holde what Curzon helde" be his motto. The time is
passed for the Catholic grandees (*les* 

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

grands) to woo Lætitia. The King can laugh now at the laughers of the
Guise; he laughs best who laughs last.

The murder by Clément of the anti-papal king, Henri III., followed very
close upon the setting up of Jesuit Clubs in Paris under papal sanction
(Elliot's *Horæ Apoc*, iii. 321). The pulpits also had been filled by
clerical preachers of sedition and bloodshed. Precisely two hundred
years later the Bastille was taken, and in the Jacobin Clubs of that day
were hung, says Alison, the pictures of Clement and Ravaillac, in the
gloomy rooms of the old convent, in which they met like night-birds of
ill-omen, and within little wreaths beneath each picture might be seen
inscribed the words, "He was fortunate; he killed a king." This is so
sentimental, petty, and petulant, that it would move to laughter any
large good-natured mind, were it mot for the slaver of malignity that
accompanies everything that drops from the tongues of that sack of
reptiles gathered out of the Jacobin dunghill, as they crawled forth one
by one poisoning and to poison.

believe this to be pure nonsense. It would be little stronger than lead.
It merely means a gilt casque, and I think some of the accounts say so

The word is made here to apply to the wife, Mary Stuart, whom he leaves

but *vef* or *veuf* is the masculine form, so there is very little
choice given.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[96:1](oon09.htm#fr_86.md) The family name of Pope
Gregory XIII. was Hugo Buon-Compagni. On May 13, 572, he was made Pope.
He assumed the name of Gregory out of respect to St. Gregory Nazianzen.
He caused the Church to encourage the murder of refractory kings; he
promoted the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, which Sir Paul Rycaut,
the historian of the Popes, does not so much as mention in the life of
Gregory. He only says towards the end that "he may be numbered amongst
the good Popes." As Buon-Compagni was a good lawyer before he became a
good Pope, he was prequalified for a virtuous career in any line of
life. He re-confirmed the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth; he
rectified the Calendar which goes by his name,--the Gregorian. The
Jesuits' College was finished by him at Rome, dedicated so oddly--

Religioni et bonis Artibus.

In his day Japan was, by Jesuit missionary effort, brought within the
pale of the Church: on which a wit remarked that Japan varnish was
introduced into Europe, and Christian varnish into Japan. He died at
eighty-three, and to the last could almost mount on horseback without
the help of his servants. His place of retirement, Rycaut says, was
Frescati, about ten miles distant from Rome, where the Borghes Palace
now is, and was then called *Monte Dragone*--a most fit name for the
residence of the *Old Worm* of St. Bartholomew's massacre.--V. Paul
Rycaut, "Lives of the Popes," ed. 1689, vol. ii. p. 163.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[99:1](oon09.htm#fr_87.md) Will sound in full
volley.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[99:2](oon09.htm#fr_88.md) These letters are
interpreted by the old commentators and Guynaud (p. 107) as meaning the
peace concluded with Philip II. of Spain: V., cinq, S., successeur, C.,
Charles--*i.e.*, Successor to Charles Quint.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[102:1](oon09.htm#fr_89.md) Romance, *vefve* =
*veuve*, widow.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[102:2](oon09.htm#fr_90.md) Latin, *qui*, celui
qui.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[102:3](oon09.htm#fr_91.md) Latin, *ductus*, led.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[102:4](oon09.htm#fr_92.md) *Appaiser*, for pour
apaiser.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[102:5](oon09.htm#fr_93.md) *Pourchas*, old word,
pursuit, active intrigue (*proquassatio*).

<span id="fn_94"></span>[102:6](oon09.htm#fr_94.md) Razes, tonsured priests
and monks (*têtes rasées*).

<span id="fn_95"></span>[103:1](oon09.htm#fr_95.md) Greek, πεσσικός,
draught-playing, or gambling. The word was applied to gaming by the
Greeks, as we find a story in Plutarch \[Liddell and Scott, Lex.\],
exhibiting Hermes as playing draughts (on the πεσσευτήριον) with Selene,
and winning five days, which he adds to the year. Guynaud (p. 119) reads
*poche*, which I take to be an abscess, wolf, or devouring ulcer; both
he and Le Pelletier interpret it as meaning Poland.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[103:2](oon09.htm#fr_96.md) *Plaindre*, for se
plaindre.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[104:1](oon09.htm#fr_97.md) *Guiere*. Nobody
explains this word, and yet it seems to stand much in need of it. It is
given by Roquefort, as from gubernator, a general. Leader, Or we may say
*dux*, for the Duc d'Alençon. It is really guides or guide. *Guber*,
*govern*, *guide*, being all three cognate.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[104:2](oon09.htm#fr_98.md) Latin, *decisus*, cut
off, severed.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[104:3](oon09.htm#fr_99.md) This term is applied to
Poland by Nostradamus n allusion to its elective throne, which became
purely venal--a thing at last coming to be played for as a hazard at
dice. But, curiously enough, the less authentic reading *poche* is
almost equally descriptive--a burning ulcer eating into the body politic
till it destroys it.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[105:1](oon09.htm#fr_100.md) Latin, *virtuosus*;
according to M. le Pelletier "vigorous." Classical Latin has no such
word, and the lower Latin means *probus, bonis moribus et virtute
præditus*. Nostradamus probably meant *vertueux*, in old French, to be
equivalent to *robuste*.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[105:2](oon09.htm#fr_101.md) *Aloi*, the quality
of the substance of a metal. The battle of French etymologists is very
instructive over this word, as may be seen in Littré. Of course,
however, it comes from *à loi*, conformable to law. But I think there is
a misprint, and that we ought to read *toute loi* = *toute la loi*.
Guynaud (p. 122) reads *loi* in the second line for *foy*. We might
suppose that that variant had been introduced to correct the fourth
line, and was only by a "devil" carried to the second instead, by which
that imp of mischief contrived to leave two errors in place of one. In
confirmation somewhat of this, the texte-type reads *tout à loy*.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[109:1](oon09.htm#fr_102.md) Latin, *ira*, anger.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[109:2](oon09.htm#fr_103.md) Ordo, deux mourront
par ire, etc.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[110:1](oon09.htm#fr_104.md) Romance, *prins*,
pris.

jeune homme.
