# Napoleonic Rule

Century III.--*Quatrain* 35. \[I. 205.\]

Du plus profond de l'Occident d'Europe,  
De pauvres gens un jeune enfant naistra,  
Qui par sa langue seduira grande troupe,  
Son bruit au regne d'Orient plus croitra.

Translation.

In the Southern extremity of Western Europe  
A child shall be born of poor parents,  
Who by his tongue shall seduce the French army;  
His bruit shall extend to the kingdom of the East.

IN the island of Corsica was born, of an ancient but impoverished
family, a child, Napoleon Bonaparte, whose proclamations electrified the
French troops. His expedition, by order of the Directory, to Egypt,
which was meant to ruin his career, conferred upon him a world-wide
renown. This man was not eloquent as orators are eloquent; verbosity is
their gift. Even the endowment of Cicero lay much in words; and in their
multitude, which wanteth not folly: Solomon says sin. A plethora of
words becomes the apoplexy of reason. But this man's phrases are all
portable, made for the knapsack: they fly to the lip as lightning does
to metal; poetry, passion, and energy are in them, but fused to an
aerolite, till they fall like a luminous bolt, only to burn in man's
memory for ever after. They are not winged, but lightning-shod.
Fulminants are matter etherealized to an

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

interlinking with spirit. But this man's words are spirit itself, and
burn their niche in Time, to last as long as that will. Take two of
them: "Soldiers, forty centuries look down upon you!" and again, "Behold
the sun of Austerlitz!" When you speak, speak thus to men; such words
are deeds; and come not as from one who beateth the air to the pitchpipe
of the tibicen Ciceronical, but as the bullet to its butt; speak
swordpoints, that press between the joints and marrow. But I will stop
here, to escape oratory. That may still fetch its price, and seduce the
zebra troup in the courts of legal falsity, or in the Babel-room down by
the river-Minster.

Que les trois seurs <span id="fr_305"></span>[1](#fn_304) auront

Translation.

Of a savage name there shall be such publishing  
That the three sisters shall have by Fate the same name:  
Then he will lead a great nation by tongue and deed,  
And have more glory and fame than any other.

Here M. le Pelletier takes *le proferé* for a thing placed before, and
understands it as being the prenomen of Bonaparte, viz. Napoleon. But I
cannot see how that is shown to be the meaning of *proferé*. That word,
if from the Latin *proferre*, never was used for *cognomen* or
*prænomen*. One of the meanings of proferre is *palam facere*, to make
public or publish, and I think it would be safer to render it as I have
done. It will still equally draw attention to the name

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Napoleon, in
contradistinction to the name of Bonaparte; because, when he mounted the
throne as Emperor, he adopted the new name and abandoned the previous
one. This selection of a new name seems to be a natural instinct of
humanity on entering upon a new phase of life. The popes take a new name
on assuming the pontifical rank; monks and nuns do so on entering the
religious life; commoners leave their name behind when created peers;
women do so when they marry; and here Napoleon does it. But I do not
think it desirable to consider this to be indicated by the word
*proferé*. Nostradamus says that it is such a fatal name that the Parcæ
themselves will adopt it. He then repeats that he will lead,--I think it
should be seduce (*séduira*),--the grande nation by speech and deeds,
and raise a name unrivalled in the universe. This was certainly true,
and the prefiguration of it is, beyond the denial of prejudice,
marvellous.

We have now to deal with the word itself, which will furnish to
investigation a few interesting hints. Of course some may think them
intricate and far-fetched. There is no great importance to be attached
to them perhaps, but they must interest the curious; and curiosity that
is innocent has a value of its own. Who could see in Sloane's strange
Chelsea gallery the shape, dimension, and value of the museum of
Bloomsbury and its affiliations?

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

Translation.

Hercules, King of Rome and Denmark,  
Surnamed the triple Giant of France,  
Shall make Italy tremble and the wave of St. Mark,  
First in renown of all monarchs.

There was a Celtic Hercules fabled to draw men by their ears: *Par
langue et faict il conduira*, as we have just seen, so that this
Hercules means the Napoleonic dynasty. As to King of Rome, Napoleon
actually assumed that title, and later on he conferred it upon his son
by Marie Louise. In the "Memorial de Sainte-Helene," 1840 \[i. 79\], by
Las Cases, it is said that during his consulate somebody published a
genealogy connecting his family with the ancient kings of the north.
This Napoleon ridiculed in the public journals, stating that his
nobility dated only from Montenotte or the 18th Brumaire. Things were
not yet ripe for royal pretensions. The Bonaparte family in Italy can
trace to the thirteenth century. One branch was settled at Treviso, the
other at Florence, and both held an honourable position; a third was at
Sarzana, in Genoa. A Charles Bonaparte settled in Corsica in 1612, and
lived in obscurity, says Le Pelletier, till this family of kings was
born. Taine has discovered that the family was of *condottiere* stock,
and De Staël and Stendal had, before that, both of them found Napoleon's
character more analogous to that, than to any other type known to them.
Taine finds him to be a Sforza or a Malatesta born belated by three
centuries. He is as unscrupulous, searching, and ambitious as
Macchiavelli; and, curiously enough, the only book <span
id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_310) he is known to have ever annotated
profusely is

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Macchiavelli's
"Prince," which was found in his baggage at Waterloo, and has since been
published; and an intensely interesting book it is; enormously wicked
and shrewd, but diabolically wise in the Devil's gay antics. It is a
scientific treatise on government without God in the world. Its moral
axiom would seem to be that even murder should be directed by good sense
in the hands of a craft-master. In this respect I think it is even
superior to the clemency of César. The "Prince" evidently fascinated him
deeply. He treats his author quite imperially, as Bentley or any other
great critic might do, and points out condescendingly where the priest
is but a theorist and errs for want of knowledge, such as can only be
gained from the practical handling of affairs by a man of the Napoleon
calibre. I don't know that you can read so deep into the very spirit
(for I will not mention heart in the same breath with Napoleon) of the
man of blood and brain, as you may by the pencil interlineations by him
jotted down in this his Italian vade mecum; from time to time as he
recurs to the book, enlarging in view from general to first consul, and
from first consul to emperor. You seem to sit with him, as in a magical
cave, with terrible writings that come and go upon the wall before you,
writings which are the words of this book, and are lit up with a lurid
phosphoresence, the light of which emanates from his own putrescent
brain.

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

It is not historically true to say, as M. le Pelletier does, that the
family lived in obscurity in Corsica. The house at Ajaccio was the
largest in the place, a palace even as compared with the other
residences. The title of King of Rome was precious to Napoleon, as it
enabled him to claim succession to the Empire of Charlemagne. Although
Garencières, in his interpretation, fails of attaching any individual
fulfilment to the words, he is able, from this title, to say that
whoever it belongs to will attain to the Roman Empire.

Guion is equivalent to Terræfilius or Earthborn, and means giant; in
fact, it almost seems a variant of *géants*; but why *three giants of
France*? I do not know that this has ever been explained. Hercules
mythologically was distinguished by three symbols (Martinii,
"Etymologicon," *s.v.* Hercules),--a lion's skin, key, and three apples.
The three apples were, not to get angry, not to love money, not to love
pleasure. This need only be mentioned for the sake of the double
triplication and as marking so far the propriety of the term Hercules.
Master of Rome, *i.e.* Italy; of Venice, *i.e.* Austria; of Paris,
*i.e.* France; as ruled over by Napoleon as General, Consul, Emperor.
That he was "the first of monarchs over all renowned" needs no
elucidation.

Translation.

Never shall he in broad daylight  
Reach to the symbol of sceptre-bearing rule.  
Of all his positions none will be of a settled permanency,  
Conferring on the Gallic cock a gift of the armed Legion.

In other words, the Emperor will never enjoy a settled seat of firmly
established government, and he will confer upon France, either the
ruinous legacy or bequest or gift of the legionary conscription, which
converts Europe into an armed camp,--an evil gift, indeed; or those who
prefer it, may render it as the gift to France of a huge burial-place in
Spain and Portugal, where so many thousands of men, her best blood,
fell. But conscription is of the wider issue, and the more permanent
evil, as it affects Europe to this hour. It makes peace an interlude to
war, and very little less costly than war.

Our next quatrain is a great rarity, for it seems to be in pure
Provençal, and extremely pleasing it is, a great deal more honied, to
the ear in sound than the present French language; which is excellent
for conversation and the salon, where society grimaces, but where true
souls are struck dumb and poetry has ceased to be possible; or only
possible to rebellion, such as that of Victor Hugo.

Century IV.--*Quatrain* 26. \[I. 211.\]

Lou grand eyssame se lèvera d'abelhos,  
Que non sauran don te siegen venguddos.  
De nuech l'embousq. Lou gach dessous les treilhos,  
Ciutad trahido per cinq langos non nudos.

Translation.

The great swarm of bees shall rise,  
That none can tell from whence they came.<span id="page_257">p.
257</span>  
Night's ambush. The jay <span id="fr_318"></span>[1](#fn_317) beneath
the tiles.  
City betrayed by five tongues not naked.

"A peacock moulted, and a jay  
   Assumed the feathers fine,  
And, strutting in a peacock-way,  
   Thought 'now I look divine.'

"The first who met him laughed outright;  
   Others he found to sneer;  
The peacocks voted him a fright,  
His brother jays all quizzed 'the sight,'  
   But none would have him near.

"Of biped jays like this, there are  
Thousands from here to Zanzibar;  
   We call them 'plagiarist!'  
But hush! For setting souls ajar  
   Is not my line, I wist."

The bees stand for the Bonapartist army and the Empire. The second line
is understood, by M. le Pelletier, to refer to the origin of the family,
and it may be so; but I think it refers to the surprising suddenness
with which the rouges, *sans-culottes*, and republicans,--in pretended
love with equality and freedom,--were found to welcome tyranny and Rule
of One, that used to be spoken of as Monarchy. Guillotined in that form,
Frenchmen hailed it as a sword-saviour in the new dictator. It seems to
me to be the sudden conversion of such opposed principles to Bonapartism
on the night of the 18th Brumaire \[November 9, 1799\],--*De neuch
l'embousq*, an ambuscade of night,--that startles Nostradamus. Certainly
there was no doubt whatever whence the Napoleon family sprang; a family
with a history more or less traceable for five hundred years can
scarcely be described with propriety as one "whose origin

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

is *lost* in the night of time." Yet this is the meaning M. le Pelletier
would have us put upon it.

Next, like the jay in the fable, tricked out in pea-cock feathers and
spoils of the Capetian kings, Napoleon makes their palace of the
Tuileries \[*Treilhos*\] his head-quarters. The city is given over to
him by *cinq langos*, five prodigious talkers of the long robe. Far from
naked as to words or clothing were they, but as to principles very nude
and bare, quite unable to cope face to face with the audacity of this
unscrupulous cut-throat, this gunner of Ajaccio.

The men of no principles and no practice were simply ciphers before this
man of practice, *par langue et faict*; this ethnic Hercules of tongue
and sword; this servant, as Daniel has it, of "the God of Forces;" this
fly-pest Beelzebub, man of *Vespres et mouches*, grown to a dynamic
King. Where men have lost their virtue, the poor sceptics are given over
to believe a lie of their own making; tongues have they to lie withal,
but never a hand amongst them to furnish help at need.

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

Translation.

The short-haired man shall assume authority  
In maritime Toulon tributary to the enemy:  
He will afterwards dismiss as sordid all who oppose him;  
And for fourteen years direct a tyranny.

The English had seized Toulon in the name of Louis XVII., and held it a
few months till Bonaparte retook it. He overturned the Directory
(*sordide*), and suppressed its partisans with the Republic, and enjoyed
the tyranny for fourteen years, from 18th Brumaire, November 9, 1799, to
April 13, 1814. We have already seen ([p. 238](oon17.htm#page_238)) that
the *cité marine* is Toulon. Garencières fancies this to have been
fulfilled when Richelieu made himself governor of *Havre de Grace*,
where he kept his treasure and tyrannized for about fourteen years.

Century VIII.--*Quatrain* 57. \[I. 214.\]

De soldat simple parviendra en empire,  
De robbe courte parviendra à la longue:  
Vaillant aux armes, en Eglise, où plus pire,  
Vexer <span id="fr_323"></span>[1](#fn_322) les prestres comme l'eau
fait l'esponge.

Translation.

From a simple soldier he will rise to the empire,  
From the short robe he will attain the long:  
Able in arms, in Church government he shows less skill;  
He raises or depresses the priests as water a sponge.

This is a very remarkable quatrain, that Bouys and Le Pelletier, and I
suppose all French commentators, pronounce to belong to Napoleon; and it
certainly fits him very well. But, with almost as little injury to
historical fact, it may be applied to Cromwell, and accordingly
Garencières does so apply it. He writes:

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

"I never knew nor heard of anybody to whom this stanza might be applied,
than to the late usurper Cromwell; for from a simple soldier he became
to be Lord Protector, and from a student in the University he became a
graduate in Oxford, he was valiant in arms, and the worst Churchman that
could be found; as for vexing the priests, I mean the prelatical clergy,
I believe none went beyond him."

The circumstances of the French Revolution and the English Commonwealth
times are so much alike in many respects that it is not surprising that
such a description as this of a soldier who seized power and afflicted
the clergy should fit both the usurpers, Napoleon and Cromwell, almost
equally well.

Napoleon was a plain lieutenant in 1785, Consul for life in 1799, and
Emperor from 1804 to 1814. He changed the short robe for the long, is
understood by M. le Pelletier as being the consular robe for the
imperial. There is no need to interpret thus. The military dress or that
of the civilian is the short robe. Nostradamus takes but little heed, so
far as we have yet seen, of the consular dignity. In the last quatrain
he designates the duration of the tyranny, not as one of ten years,
which would represent the Empire, but of fourteen, which regards the
consulship and empire as one period. If we take Cromwell's protectorate,
however, from the death of Charles I. to the death of Cromwell, the term
will correspond with Napoleon's imperial career. But the
[interregnum](errata.htm#3) in England was a period of twelve years, and
that in France under Napoleon was of fourteen (*quatorze ans*); hence
this quatrain must not be applied to Cromwell, though it in other
respects is as true of him as of Napoleon.

Valiant in arms, but in ecclesiastical matters less successful, still he
thoroughly vexes them, penetrating into every place and corner, as water
does into a sponge. We cannot accept M. le Pelletier's rendering of
vexare as meaning to raise and cast down. It was used in the sense of to
trouble,

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

cruciare,--to anger, *commovere*; or to harass with care, *curarum œstu
fluctuare*; but never to alternately swell and depress, as in filling or
squeezing out a sponge.

Translation.

The Gallic King by means of the Celtic sword-hand,  
Seeing the discord of the great monarchy,  
Shall make his sceptre flourish by restoring the three parts,  
As against the Capets, and the Popedom.

Garencières understands as "the Cap of the great Hierarchy," Spain in
the Netherlands, which was the great upholder of the Popedom. His
application of this to history is of no value. But if we understand Cap
as Capet, and the ancient connection of the French crown with the Papal
Hierarchy, I think we elicit a better sense than that of M. le
Pelletier, which makes the Capet and the Hierarchy one. The three parts
restored, M. le Pelletier makes to consist of clergy, nobility, and
tiers état. I feel that the three parts under Napoleon were Emperor,
Senate, and Chamber of Deputies, which would be head (or Caput instead
of

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Capet), Senate
representing the higher classes, and the Chambers the people. That would
constitute les trois parts of the quatrain.

Translation.

He shall have married a woman just before  
The divine wrath falleth on the great Prince;  
And his support shall dwindle in a sudden atrophy;  
Counsel shall perish from this shaven head.

This divine evil that surprises the Prince a little after his marriage
with Marie-Louise of Austria and his mean-spirited repudiation of
Josephine, is most excellently rendered by Garencières as "*the falling
sickness*, called by the Greeks *Epilepsia*, and by the Latins *Morbus
sacer*." Garencières was a Fellow of the London College of Physicians,
and a man versed in the medical nomenclature of his day; so that *le mal
divin* should here be rendered epilepsy. It has never yet been so
rendered, except by Garencières, and he has no application to make of it
whatever, though, as a mere matter of translation, he says, "the
construction of the whole is easie." It strikes me that this forecast,
thus interpreted, will throw light from Nostradamus on what history has
heretofore overlooked, and will necessitate the re-writing of

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Napoleon's life
from the date of his wicked prostitution of the marriage rite. Napoleon,
Cromwell, Mahomet, César, were all epileptic, and probably Alexander.
But this particular scoundrel first committed, from the purely sordid
motive of self-aggrandisement, a moral crime, and that brought on the
convulsion of the brain, that practically discharged for ever the mighty
Leyden jar or electric battery, with which this potent brain-fiend had
dealt out merciless torpedo-shocks to Europe, and death as from the hot
wind Samyel. Inflated vanity, the epileptic stroke, the reaction of
external forces on the weakened centre, made the cerebral pap, still of
gigantic power, entertain new Phantasms huger than ever, with a terribly
diminished power of reason, to bring them to birth by the practical
handling of circumjacent facts and time-tendencies. Now, said the fool
of this western parable, now am I master of events, and may swim against
the sea,--not with it, as I and common mortals heretofore have done, but
against it, and to win. Well, he did carry the big dream into Russia,
and as far as the nightmare of Borodino. He also still found a mighty
utterance of lurid glory, with which to pin that evil minute in letters
of fire and phosphorus upon the curtain of eternity, "Behold the sun of
Austerlitz!" The looming *mot d'ordre*, the old work, the old guards,
and the old drillings, guided once again to a Pyrrhic victory; two such
will damn a kingdom. Reader, read Ségur \[Comte de Ségur, "Napoléon et
la Grande Armée," liv. vii. ch. viii. p. 179\], and there perceive the
giant unbrained and drivelling about his bastard boy called "King of
Rome," and what else belongs to *mon étoile effacée*. "All the supports
dwindle," says Nostradamus, "and counsel will perish from the shaven
head." Garencières is right, and the diagnosis true. It is the falling
sickness. It is

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

not Jove fulminant that strikes the reeling Pagod from without, as with
César 'twas, but an epiletic withdrawal of electricity from within,
backwards. Emperor and empire will soon roll together in the dust; man's
posthumous analysis, and that of all the evil works wrought by him,
though the good live after.

Translation.

Throughout the universe a monarch shall arise,  
Who will not be long in peace nor life;  
The bark of St. Peter will then lose itself,  
Being directed to its greatest detriment.

The Emperor Napoleon, reviving pretensions to the old Roman empire or
universe, will neither enjoy peace nor life for very long. In his time
the Holy Seat, *la piscature barque*, shall so guide itself to greatest
detriment as to be cast away and lost (under Pius VII.).

Pope Plus was made a prisoner by General Miollis, July 6, 1809, and
carried to Savone, then to Fontainebleau, and kept under strict guard by
Napoleon till March 10, 1814, when he was set at liberty. Garencières
interprets this as being fulfilled in the time of Henri II. of France,
who was slain by Montgomery in the tilt yard. Through all his reign he
was at war with the Emperor Charles V. This Emperor sacked Rome, and
Pope Clement VII. was made a prisoner (*vide* Garencières, "Tiber," p.
77).

So great fury and rage will make men say  
That he will exterminate the male sex by fire and sword.

The period of the fulfilment of this event M. le Pelletier gives as
extending from 1813 to 1815. It asks no further interpretation than that
afforded by the translation.

Translation.

The eagle, drifting in her cloud of flags,  
By other circling birds is beaten home.  
Till war's hoarse trumpet and the clarion shrill,  
Recall her senses to th' insenate dame.

This is one of the few quatrains that lend themselves freely to a poetic
rendering. The Napoleonic eagle driven back to France with all its
retreating flags about it, or chased by a surrounding of other eagles,
Austrian, Russian, Prussian. The din of cymbals, trumpets, and clarions
restore France to reason, the insensate dame.

Garencières's annotation here is extremely funny, and should not be
unrecorded. He says: "It is an eagle driven from the tents by other
birds, when a mad lady shall recover her senses by the noise of cymbals,
trumpets, and bells."

Like a griffin the King of Europe will come, Accompanied with those of
the north. Of red and white there will be a great number, And they will
go against the King of Babylon.

The King of Europe is Louis XVIII.; shall come like 2 griffin (Griffon,
γρύχ γρύπος, a fabulous animal, with hooked beak: v. Liddell and Scott;
*v. Griffe*, Noel; *Griffeau*, Roquefort, Littré, Gwillim, Brunet,
etc.), accompanied with those of the north. He will conduct grand
battalions of red and white uniforms, *i.e.* English and Austrian, and
they will march as one against the King of Babylon, which is Paris.
Louis, as the descendant of Hugh Capet, may be styled the first of
European Kings. The King of Paris is Napoleon, who ruled the Revolution
there, and brought order to confusion or Babel. But we can bring it home
to Paris even more intimately than this, for the old name of Paris was
Lutetia, or mud-place, where the toads, *crapauds*, or Frankish frogs
dwelt, and out of whose mud, or *bourbe*, came the Bourbon family. So
that Paris, their chief city, *en calembour*, yields *Bourbe ville,
Babyl, Babel*.

Garencières thinks to see Gustavus Adolphus here as the most eminent
King of Europe in his day, and he came from Aquilon, the north, and
warred upon the Emperor, who was King of Babylon, from propping the
popedom, or from the Babel of confusion. He had regiments red, white,
blue, and yellow and green, in the hope of creating emulation amongst
them. If he had only had regiments red and white we might have
hesitated, and gone further to examine

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

where the clue would lead to. But what begins by proving too much is
like other overshooting, and misses the mark entirely.

Translation.

Between two prisons, bound hand and foot,  
With his face anointed with honey, and fed with milk,  
Exposed to wasps and flies, and tormented with the love of his child,  
His cupbearer will false the cup that aims at suicide.

M. le Pelletier renders this: Napoleon, after being consecrated by Pius
VII., and anointed from the sacred ampulla with honey and milk,
underwent a double imprisonment in Elba and St. Helena. The imperial
bees--for so he translates the wasps and flies--are desolated as to
their love for the child, and his surgeon, Yvan (*pocillator*), has
falsified the death by poison, on the night of April 12 to 13, 1814.
Now, as it was not his own soldiers that tormented him, I think we ought
to read it *faché*: he was desolated by wasps, flies, his child, and
love. His soldiers are called *abeilles* before, never *guêpes*; these
are the enemy tormenting, who will not let him abdicate in favour of his
son (φυτόν). We shall do better here to follow Garencières's example,
drawn from the life of Artaxerxes, King of Persia. The Persians used to
punish poisoners by laying them between two troughs, here called boats,
with their face uncovered, bedaubed with honey to attract the wasps and
flies, and fed them with milk to prolong the torment, which if they
refused, they ran needles into their eyes most persuasively, and then
left them till vermin ate them up. So that it means: he was tormented
between two prisons bodily and mentally, with the ruin of his family,
insomuch that he would have been glad to have escaped it all by poison.
Whenever Napoleon was thoroughly frustrated in his plans, he evidently
tried to fall back upon, what he had never deserved, human sympathy;
which in prosperity he had never thought

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

of nor desired. He first showed this softening, rather of the brain than
heart, at Borodino, as we have said before.

We will now take the substance of what happened at the abdication, as
given by M. le Pelletier from the *Manuscrit de* 1814, by the Baron
Faim. He abdicated \[here may we say, "Woe unto him that buildeth a town
with blood" (Habakkuk, ii. 12)\] at Fontainebleau April 4, 1814,
reserving the Regency for the Empress Marie Louise, and his son. He was
thrown into despair when he found the allies to be masters of Paris, and
to reject any such conditions. Baron Faim was his private secretary, and
describes what occurred on the night of the 12th and 13th of April,
before the day of his unconditional abdication. Fontainebleau really
became a prison under the surveillance of strangers. There were no terms
left to him to save even his life. Still he let the day close without
yielding.

For some days previously he had seemed altogether preoccupied in
revolving some design. His conversation turned always upon the voluntary
death that the great men of antiquity courted when in situations such as
his. The Empress had reached Orleans on her way to rejoin him, but he
had given orders not to allow her to do so. He dreaded such an interview
as likely to unman him for the resolution he meditated.

It was a terrible night of suspense; the long corridors of the palace
resounded with the footsteps of servants going and coming, the candles
were burning in the private apartments. Doctor Yvan is suddenly called
upon to attend, the Duc de Vincence is sent for, and they hurry to fetch
the Duc de Bassano from the Chancellory; they are all taken to the
bedroom as they drop in one after another. Sobs and sighs escape, but
not a word is yet dropped to satisfy curiosity. On a sudden the doctor
leaves the apartment, descends

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

to the courtyard, finds a horse ready saddled, and quits the place at a
hand-gallop.

All that transpires on the occasion is that, at the retreat from Moscow,
Napoleon had provided himself with a means of escape, should he fall
alive into the hands of the enemy. Yvan, his surgeon, had given him a
packet of opium, which he had ever since carried round his neck. The
valet heard him rise in the night, and saw through the half-opened door
that he mixed something in a glass of water, drank it off, and returned
to bed. He quickly felt that his end was approaching, and had his most
trusted followers called to his bedside, Yvan amongst the rest; but,
when he heard Napoleon complain that the action of the poison was too
slow, he precipitately quitted Fontainebleau, as we have seen.

A very heavy slumber supervened, accompanied with profuse perspiration,
and when he awoke the symptoms had disappeared, the dose having proved
of insufficient quantity, or time had deprived it of its efficacy.
Napoleon, astonished at the failure, simply exclaimed, "*Dieu ne le veut
pas*!" and professing, perhaps for the first time in his life, to yield
to Providence, resigned himself quietly to his new destiny, On board the
*Northumberland* he strongly reprobated suicide. It would have been
instructive to have heard the arguments employed by this intellectual
giant, merely as a mental acrobat exhibiting, and as showing how far the
intellect may be effective in illustrating the path of duty. But on
nothing could Napoleon's opinion be worth so little as on a question of
morals, where the soul's instinct is chief guide. The rats ate his
heart, it is said, in an interim of the medical dissection. I doubt it;
he had eaten it himself long before he left Brienne.

On the morning of the 13th, Napoleon rose and dressed

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

as usual. His objections had vanished, and his next act was to ratify
the treaty--a solemn act, which he took the earliest opportunity that
offered to betray and break.

He ran the blockade, March 1, 1815, and landed at Cannes, close to
Marseilles, crossing the Gulf of Genoa, till defeated at Waterloo on the
18th of June, "seeking death," says Le Pelletier, "without being able to
find it," (*où il sera sauf de coups de feu*). When the smoke rises from
the bottomless pit, "shall men seek death and not find it; and shall
desire to die, and death shall flee from them" (Rev. ix. 6). Napoleon
comes out of the island Æthalia, or metallic smoke, and escapes the
murderous artillery that kills his men, though it were far fitter he
should die. His beehive is not burned with fire, but other liquor than
honey flows freely,--the life-blood of his bees.

Bruit, in the fourth line, is to be read as one syllable. Garencières
has *Brait*, which, though it have no meaning, shows perhaps that it was
one syllable.

and mighty overthrow of a giant leader and braggart of swelling words;
and of a proud nation split in battle, as a tree is by thunder-stroke.

Englishmen seem half afraid now to mention the day with pride, for fear
of hurting French susceptibilities. To mention it insultingly, or in a
hostile spirit, is unpardonable; but to speak of it modestly and
thankfully, and of Wellington as a great soldier and benefactor to us,
is only manly and proper. The man who has not the courage to do this
firmly and inoffensively in the company of Frenchmen is only one of the
many cowards amongst us, who lead the French to think that, however
great things our fathers may have done in the past, the spirit has fled
from us that would repeat them in the future.

From Bourg la Reine they shall march on Chartres,  
They shall camp close to Pont Anthony:  
Seven chiefs for peace, cautious as martens,  
Shall enter Paris cut off from its army.

The generals of the seven nations coalesced shall, under pretext of
peace, but really out of jealousy of France, says M. le Pelletier, and
in virtue of the capitulation of the 3rd of July, enter Paris; now cut
off from her army (*clos d'armee*), which retreats upon Chartres,
passing by Bourg la Reine and Pont d'Anthony, where it camps. The
quatrain does not at all obviously read so, but we must suppose that it
is the French army which goes to Chartres. We are not, however, bound to
believe that the marten-like and cunning seven only pretended to
establish peace out of jealousy to France. All Europe and France herself
sighed for peace;

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

and if, when victorious, the enemies were inclined to take back what
France had robbed them of severally, that would not be very wonderful.
The seven nations signatory to the treaties of 1815 were England,
Austria, Prussia, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal.

This is a very remarkable forecast, and shows that although Nostradamus
is a national prophet of France, and nearly all his one thousand
quatrains turn upon her and her interests, he seldom exhibits a particle
of partisanship, and you would not know he was a Frenchman from any word
that he lets fall. He strictly limits himself to the utterance of his
vision in the tersest phrase, and the most forcible words that he can
bring to bear for that purpose. I think there is no other instance known
of such inviolable temperance. A man sits down in his study and
prophecies; commits his visions to paper in prose; turns them
deliberately afterwards, and in cold blood, into the pithiest poetry he
knows how; shakes up in a hat, as we have previously remarked, all the
quatrains together, and, when he has effectually destroyed all sequence
and order, counts them out into even hundreds; then, without a word of
note or comment, he sends them forth in type into the world to sink or
swim; be ridiculed or admired, be understood or mistaken, perish or
endure; until such period as their fulfilment in the centuries of time
is realized, and the sleeping world awakens to the miracle, that has
slept also, beside the sleeping world, till light arose to make both
clear qt once.

Louis XVIII. is designated *Le blond au nez fourchu* according to Le
Pelletier. *Le blond* is, no doubt, the sign of the Capets, as shown by
several other stanzas in Nostradamus, but not the aquiline nose, I
think; that, I believe, is intended for Napoleon. So that Louis XVIII.
comes to blows with the hooked nose, or Napoleon, for the second time
and drives him out; he who was exiled before now replacing him within.
The strongest, that is Napoleon and his officers, are committed *aux
lieux marins*; which either means to the English, who go down to the sea
in ships, or else to St. Helena, a prison in the sea.

Translation.

The inhuman tyrant shall die a hundred times;  
A learned and debonnaire King shall take his place:  
All the senate shall be under his control,  
And he shall be grieved by a bold criminal.

Napoleon is the inhuman tyrant to die a hundred deaths: one his suicidal
attempt; another Elba, with its cinerary and fuliginous ashes; another
Waterloo; and lastly St. Helena, with its ten times ten remorseful
hours, regrets, and studious

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

falsifications of the history of his life. *Debonnaire* is, with
Nostradamus, an epithet of the Capet family, and stands doubtless for
Louis XVIII. put into his place. The King finds the Senate quite
submissive to his will, but he is cut to the heart by the daring attempt
of the criminal Louvel upon the Duc de Berri, February 13, 1820.

This is the excellent interpretation of M. le Pelletier. Bouys (p. 80),
writing in 1806 under the full influence of the demon of Napoleon, gives
it a very different reading. The inhuman tyrant with him can be nobody
but Robes pierre, who, with a pistol shot, endeavoured to put an end to
himself ineffectually, but blew away half his face, suffering thirty
hours of fearful torment, and finally was dragged to the place of
execution amidst the maledictions of the populace. The *sçavant et
debonnaire* to Bouys is, of course, Napoleon. The malin teméraire is a
forgotten Georges, whose conspiracy gave a little momentary anxiety to
Napoleon. Here terminate the oracles assigned to Napoleon by A le
Pelletier. But Bouys adduces several others, which sufficiently relate
to the Emperor to be enumerated here. It is painful to see how men
manipulate these things to suit their theories. We will give now a
quatrain that Bouys cites, as he thinks it favourable to Napoleon; but
he carefully omits the one next to it in the same Century, purely, as it
seems, because it is unfavourable to Napoleon,

To cross the Apennines and see after Gaul: <span id="page_278">p.

He will transfix the heaven, the mountain ice and snows,  
Striking each of them with his magic wand.

The Oriental, *i.e.* Napoleon in Egypt, will leave his army behind
there, after almost turning Mahometan; return and cross the Apennines
and Alps to look after the Directory and their doings in France. He will
soon even subdue the elements and Nature by his marvellous roads over
the mountains of ice and snow, and will strike each as with the rod of
Moses, or the wand of a magician; for the archaic and unusual word
*gaule* may mean that, as well as a riding switch. Bouys misses the
plainer meaning of the first line, but is determined it shall represent
Napoleon, so he takes Oriental to be Corsica, as being east of Toulon.
The passage of Mont St. Bernard with cavalry and artillery he gives
rightly enough; the Alps have to be introduced for the Apennines. The
quatrain following next to this he passes *sub silentio*, for the reason
above assigned, though it is pregnant with meaning; and how this should
have been over. looked by M. le Pelletier, I cannot quite understand;

Hannibal and Napoleon are the only great generals who

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

ever forced their military way over the Alps successfully; Hannibal,
with his *acetum*, vinegar, or hatchet, as some have interpreted Livy;
and Napoleon for cavalry and heavy pieces of artillery. He seemed to be
the marvellous Carthaginian born again out of the shades of Hades, a
scourge and flail of men: Babel itself not worse in the confusion that
fell upon Rome, and the Church of Rome through him. We have given this
before, at [p. 199](oon15.htm#page_199), but repeat it here with further
enlargement, as it belongs more to Napoleon than to the Revolution.
Garencières thinks it was fulfilled when Charles V. sacked Rome. If we
consider, as I do, that the two stanzas are inseparable, they will fit
only Napoleon.

We come now to a quatrain that M. le Pelletier has overlooked, but which
Bouys (p. 83) with some reason attributes to Napoleon.

Century IV.--*Quatrain* 54.

Translation.

Of a name that never belonged to Gallic king,  
Never was there so terrible a thunderbolt.  
He made Italy tremble, Spain and the English.  
He wooed a foreign lady with assiduity.

Bouys introduces into his interpretation of this a good deal of foolish
adulation of Napoleon; pretending that he was not only *crantif* towards
his enemies, which we must render *a cause of terror*, but also that he
was himself *crantif*,

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

very tender of the lives of his troops. To prove this monstrous
proposition, he quotes the claptrap uttered by him before the battle of
Austerlitz: "I regret to think how many of these brave fellows I shall
lose. I feel for them as if veritably they were my own children. Indeed
I sometimes reproach myself for this sentiment of tenderness; I
sometimes fear it may end in rendering me unfit to carry on war." This
was, indeed, an heroic fear, says Bouys. We are content to let its
heroism wrestle with its hypocrisy; we foresee which will come by the
first fall.

Garencières translates that the warrior, whoever he may be, will follow
after strange women; and that would fit Napoleon, though not specially.
But we think it better to render it with Bouys as indicating the Empress
Josephine, who was of Creole blood, and therefore foreign; or Marie
Louise, equally foreign. If the latter, *Estrange* would stand for
Austrian (*v*. Century I., Quatrain 83).

Century VIII.--Quatrain 53. \[I. 269.\]

Dedans Bolongne voudra laver ses fautes, <span

Il volera faisant choses si <span id="fr_379"></span>[2](#fn_378)
hautes,

Translation.

In Boulogne he would make up for his shortcomings,  
But cannot penetrate the temple of the sun.  
He hastens away to perform the very highest things.  
In the hierarchy he never had an equal.

This is a singularly interesting quatrain. It has received three
different interpretations; all three somewhat curious, Garencières opens
the ball. He says there are two towns called *Bolloin*, one in Italy,
one in France; that is, Bologna

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

in Italy, and Boulogne in France. He thinks Boulogne is intended, and
that Richelieu, a man of high things, and beyond the hierarchy, vowed, a
little before his death, that if he recovered he would make a pilgrimage
to Boulogne; to the Temple of Miracles there, dedicated to the Virgin,
here described as the *Sun*, from that passage in the Revelation, "And
there appeared a woman clothed with the sun;" but the cardinal took the
road of death, which led, not through Boulogne, to the shades below, and
certainly not to the Temple of the Sun. This has an interest of its own,
but, as an interpretation, is utterly wide of the mark. Richelieu on a
repentant pilgrimage to the Temple of the Sun would have been admirable
as a caricature in Rabelais; but, would be no fitter subject for
Nostradamus's pen, than if a lady of title went to Aix-les-Bains to take
the waters there. And observe, he had to invent a Temple of the Sun to
send him to, for never was there such a temple at Boulogne.

We have also Le Pelletier trying his hand, and he realizes it in Louis
Napoleon, in his escapade of 1840. When he was made Emperor, his Italian
exploit is represented as a flight to the *Temple of the Sun*. But how
he could suppose that inferior mortal, to be referred to in *n'en fut
oncq un pareil*, I cannot divine.

Bouys and others attribute it to Napoleon, and his intention to descend
upon England from Boulogne in the flotilla. Is there not a column there,
ridiculously built to commemorate the failure? Is there not also a
Boulogne medal struck (Ford's "Spain," i. 272) with one of the
Napoleonic falsehoods (an endless series) imprinted on its face, which
runs, "Descente en Angleterre frappé à Londres"? These are the
ridiculous touches; but now let us enter on the serious interpretation
and see what that will yield us.

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

At Boulogne the Emperor will endeavour to blot England from the map of
Europe, and so redeem all his previous shortcomings in that direction.
He promises himself the satisfaction of dictating his terms in London,
and possibly entertained, in that strange brain of his, some dream that
he would be crowned on that royalty-confirming stone of Scone in
Westminster Abbey; where, tradition tells, the Temple of Apollo was
shaken down by earthquake, A.D. 154, the Temple of the Sun. But *Il ne
pourra au temple du soleil*, says Nostradamus: and history has thought
fit in this as on so many other occasions to endorse the forecast of the
prophet. Bouys adds, "Napoléon finira par faire la conquête de
l'Angleterre;" but Bouys is not Nostradamus; and Napoleon, like
Richelieu, went to the shades below from St. Helena, and did not go to
the Temple of the Sun nor to the Stone of Scone. He went away, however,
from Boulogne to very great things, as men count greatness; and was
quite without an equal in the hierarchy of kings.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[251:3](oon19.htm#fr_307) *Duira*, for
conduira.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[252:1](oon19.htm#fr_308) Δαν-αρχή, Princedom
of Dan. The old Kings of Denmark pretended to derive from Dan, seventh
son of Jacob, it is said.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[252:2](oon19.htm#fr_309) Γῆς υἰόσ, son of
earth. *Terræfilius*, giant.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[252:3](oon19.htm#fr_310) *Unda*, wave, *onde*.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[253:1](oon19.htm#fr_311) The title of this
book is "Machiavel Commenté par N<sup>on</sup> Buonaparte," 1816,
published by H. Nicolle, 12, Rue de Seine. I have a copy, but there is
none in the British Museum. The Preface and the Introductory Discourse
on Macchiavelli are full of ability. The translation of the "Prince" in
French occupies the left-hand column of each page, and seems well done;
on the right-hand column are given the emperor's annotations, <span
id="page_254">p. 254</span> where they occur, otherwise it stands blank.
They are severally initialled G., R. C., or E--General, Republican
Consul, Emperor,--according to the period at which Napoleon may be
supposed to have written them. Some of the remarks are clever, but
perhaps scarcely show the grip of Napoleon; which, whether right or
wrong, was always that of an iron vice. I now imagine it to be an
ingenious forgery, but it is quite curious enough to merit further
inquiry. This footnote, it will be seen, does not correspond with what I
have said in the text. I wrote that under the impression that the
document was genuine, and it would be just, if the book were true. But I
leave it as it is, though it tells slightly against myself, as the
contrast, between the first and second thoughts seems to me instructive.
It shows that, let a man walk by right faith or by wrong, he must steer
by the belief that is present with him.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[255:1](oon19.htm#fr_312) *Signum*, ensign,
standard, or perhaps symbol of rule or domination.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[255:2](oon19.htm#fr_313) *Sceptrum ferre*,
sceptre-bearing, reigning.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[255:3](oon19.htm#fr_314) *Siége*, position,
situation.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[255:4](oon19.htm#fr_315) En *séjour*,
permanent, durable.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[255:5](oon19.htm#fr_316) Coq, the Gallic cock.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[255:6](oon19.htm#fr_317) *Tago*, or *tango*,
to touch or take, le Pelletier says; but it does not yield very good
sense. Perhaps τάγμα, a regular body of soldiers, in Dion Cassius it
stands for the Roman legion. Garencières reads here TAG *à misère*, "The
tag to misery," and says it is wretchedness to come from <span
id="page_256">p. 256</span> Portugal to France, Tag being the *Tagus*,
on which Lisbon is situated. This might be interpreted well to mean the
mischief arising to the empire from the successes of Wellington in the
Peninsular war.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[257:1](oon19.htm#fr_318) The jay, of course,
is Esop's Fable of that bird, tricked out in finer feathers than its
own. The elegant rendering by La Fontaine \[iv. 9, Ed., 1838\] of *Le
Geai paré des plumes du Paon* had, when Nostradamus wrote, not then
taken shape. The original is so accessible, that it may suffice to give
here the English version.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[258:1](oon19.htm#fr_319) This curious phrase
manifestly points to Napoleon wearing short hair, in military fashion,
as distinguished from the flowing locks of the line of Capet,--shaven as
contrasted with bewigged. This is one of the many coincidences that
connect the Commonwealth of England with the French repetition of it at
the Revolution. Croppies, or Roundheads, distinguished the sanctimonious
insurgents of the Commonwealth from the cavaliers with their flowing
locks. The Tory cavaliers wore wigs; the Whigs undermined the bewigged.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[258:2](oon19.htm#fr_320) *Sordide* should be
written *sordid'*, and *teste*, *test'*, if we wish the line to scan.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[258:3](oon19.htm#fr_321) *Puis*, for depuis.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[258:4](oon19.htm#fr_322) Latin, *per*,
pendant.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[259:1](oon19.htm#fr_323) Latin, *vexare*,
raise, inflate, according to Le Pelletier; but Facciolati gives no such
meaning. "Vexed Bermoothes" gives it.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[261:1](oon19.htm#fr_324) *Dextera*, Latin,
right hand, or sword hand.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[261:2](oon19.htm#fr_325) *Discorde* should be
*discord'*, or the line will not scan. These may be minor matters, but
those who think them unimportant are not wise. It is an excellent rule
in literature to let nothing remain wrong that can be set right by a
little scholarship and industry. In the world it is very different;
there you should never put anything right, for everything wrong has a
host of latent friends, that will fight very savagely in its defence.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[261:3](oon19.htm#fr_326) *Cappe*, for Capet,
says M. le Pelletier. The texte-type gives a variation here as *la
Chappe*. This yields no help at all, except as showing by the variant
that there is something wants altering. The line will not scan as it s.
I think it should be altered to *le Cap*. If it stands for Capet it is
Masculine, and when it occurred before, in Quatrain 20 of Century IX, it
was given as *Esleu Cap*.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[262:1](oon19.htm#fr_327) These two lines
furnish an hyperbaton and will be best transposed, that the great Prince
will have married a woman before the divine wrath falls upon him.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[262:2](oon19.htm#fr_328) This is equivalent to
*tout d'un coup*, suddenly.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[262:3](oon19.htm#fr_329) This line is too long
by a foot; *appuy et credit* mean the same thing, and one should be
omitted. The line should be corrected thus:

Et son appuy à un coup viendra mince.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[264:1](oon19.htm#fr_330) Par is Latin, *per*,
throughout.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[264:2](oon19.htm#fr_331) Equals *qui en*.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[265:1](oon19.htm#fr_332) The texte-type
furnishes *porter*, with *porte* as a variant. M. le Pelletier embodies
this in his text. I should replace the word that he excludes. Further, I
should regard *passera* as being a form of the Latin *patior*, and the
French *pâtir*, and therefore read *pâtira*. *Porter pâtira* will then
mean suffer it to bear. *Charge*, for the scansion, should be *charg'*.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[265:2](oon19.htm#fr_333) *Grande* should be
*grand'*, for the scansion.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[265:3](oon19.htm#fr_334) *Tranchera* should
read *il tranchena*.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[265:4](oon19.htm#fr_335) Esclavonie is put for
modern Hungary

<span id="fn_335"></span>[265:5](oon19.htm#fr_336) *Olestant* is another
variation of the nom fatidique de Napoleon, [p.
150](oon14.htm#page_150), from ὄλλυμι, to destroy, ὀλλέσθαι.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[266:1](oon19.htm#fr_337) *Poussée*, for
*repoussé*.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[266:2](oon19.htm#fr_338) *Entour* should be
*entour'*, for *entouré*.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[266:3](oon19.htm#fr_339) *Entour* here is for
*entourage*.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[266:4](oon19.htm#fr_340) *Cymbres*, κύμβη,
cymbals.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[266:5](oon19.htm#fr_341) *Tube, tuba*,
trumpet.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[266:6](oon19.htm#fr_342) *Sonnaillons*,
literally, bell-ringing, but perhaps clarion may serve.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[266:7](oon19.htm#fr_343) This line cannot be
scanned; we must read de *l'Aquillon*.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[267:1](oon19.htm#fr_344) This requires, for
both grammar and scansion, *grande*.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[267:2](oon19.htm#fr_345) The *E* in *contre*
must suffer elision, thus: *contr'*. It is right in Garencières's.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[268:1](oon19.htm#fr_346) κύμβη, is a cup,
usually, in Greek. M. le Pelletier gives κύμβος as a cavity or
precipice. I find no such meaning as precipice. There is a great
difficulty to settle the meaning here. Κύμβη means a cup, a boat, a
wallet, and also, is like κύβη, the head. We should perhaps simplify the
issue by confining ourselves strictly to the Latin word, *Cymba*, which
is boat or skiff. Always a light boat, as in the Georgics, i. 136, where
the little boats were made of *alnos cavatas*, the riverside alders
hollowed out. It is rather a craft for a small lake than for the sea; as
Ovid charmingly puts it:

"Non ideo debet pelago se credere, signa  
Audet in exiguo ludere cymba lacu."

But, then, what sense would it yield, "a man being between two boats,
tied hand and foot?" Between two abysses, M. le Pelletier interprets;
but, then, we do not find that, either in Greek or Latin, the word
yields that meaning. He interprets it of Elba and St. Helena. But was an
island ever called an abyss; I think as seldom as ever κύμβη meant one.
Hesychius gives κοίλος μυχός, a hollow recess, the penetralia of the
women's apartments, and he adds also βμθός, the depth of the sea, to
explain κύμβος. In Martinius's "Lexicon Etymol.," there is a very
curious quotation from Isidore, Bk. 19., which makes the *cymba* to be
the space occupied by a ship in the displacement of the water beneath
it. I think out of all this we may extract a meaning for the *deux
cymbes*. As two places, or recessed prisons, hollowed out of the sea, he
shall be put, bound hand and foot. The line, to scan correctly, should
have the word *et* left out.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[268:2](oon19.htm#fr_347) *Fitine*, φυτόν,
plant, scion, child.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[268:3](oon19.htm#fr_348) *Pocillator* is
cupbearer.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[268:4](oon19.htm#fr_349) *Faucer* is fauser,
to trick.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[268:5](oon19.htm#fr_350) *Scyphus*, cup. There
is a singular appropriateness in this word, whether intended or not by
Nostradamus, for Athenaeus describes the Bœotians as first using huge
silver drinking-cups, or scyphi, which were denominated Herculean,
because Hercules, who was very fond of feasting, used such, and first
invented the cry of "no heel taps!" *ut libantes nihil in calice vini
relinquerent*. The reader will bear in mind the *Hercules de Gaule* of a
former quatrain.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[272:1](oon19.htm#fr_351) Itales, *Ætalia*,
Elba.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[272:2](oon19.htm#fr_352) *Par mer*, Gulf of
Genoa.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[272:3](oon19.htm#fr_353) *Forains*, Latin,
*foris*, strangers.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[272:4](oon19.htm#fr_354) *Sauf*, Latin,
*sabous*, English, safe.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[272:5](oon19.htm#fr_355) *Sauf de* coup de
feu.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[272:6](oon19.htm#fr_356) *Le dard du ceil* is
the thunderbolt.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[272:7](oon19.htm#fr_357) Latin, *ferire*, to
strike.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[272:8](oon19.htm#fr_358) *Estandue* is
standard.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[273:1](oon19.htm#fr_359) Latin, *gens*,
nation.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[273:2](oon19.htm#fr_360) Latin, *monstrum*,
prodigy.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[273:3](oon19.htm#fr_361) *Morts* should be
read *Meurt*, perhaps, as referring to Napoleon, who, showed great
delight, it is said, when he found that Wellington intended. to fight
him. It cannot refer, as Le Pelletier would have it to do, to, the
celebrated *mot* of Cambronne or General Michel, as it has been proved
that it was never uttered at all, but manufactured by a wit *après
coup*.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[273:4](oon19.htm#fr_362) The stone is in the
tree. Le Pelletier would here understand *silex*, the flint axe of
primitive ages. This seems to me to be very far fetched., and I would
rather read, with Garencières, the stone into thunderstone or aerolite,
which seems to be far less forced.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[274:1](oon19.htm#fr_363) Hyperbaton. the
construction is *feront entrée a Paris clos d'armée*.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[274:2](oon19.htm#fr_364) Latin, *clausus*,
shut, cut off from the French army.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[275:1](oon19.htm#fr_365) *Forche*, fourchu, or
forked. Latin, *furca*, hooked.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[275:2](oon19.htm#fr_366) *Commettre*, ellipsis
for *se commettre*, to come to blows with any one.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[275:3](oon19.htm#fr_367) Latin, *per*,
through, or by means of.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[275:4](oon19.htm#fr_368) Latin, *duo*, a
second repetition.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[276:1](oon19.htm#fr_369) Consigning.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[276:2](oon19.htm#fr_370) *Plus fors*, read
*plus forts*.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[276:3](oon19.htm#fr_371) *Malignus*, Latin, a
criminal.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[278:1](oon19.htm#fr_372) *Fera* should be
*feront*, I think.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[278:2](oon19.htm#fr_373) *Avint* I take to
mean *avant*.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[278:3](oon19.htm#fr_374) *Viendra* for
*viendront*.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[279:1](oon19.htm#fr_375) *Onque* should be
*oncq'*, to scan.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[279:2](oon19.htm#fr_376) Italie is the reading
of the *texte-type*. Bouys reads *Itale*, and then this line will scan.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[279:3](oon19.htm#fr_377) *Estrangiers* was
probably pronounced as of two syllables only, but it is difficult to
make this line scan.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[280:1](oon19.htm#fr_378) *Fautes*, to be taken
as shortcomings.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[280:2](oon19.htm#fr_379) *Si*--very.
