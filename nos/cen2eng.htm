<P>
1<BR>
Towards Aquitaine by the British Isles<BR>
By these themselves great incursions.<BR>
Rains, frosts will make the soil uneven,<BR>
Port Selyn will make mighty invasions<BR>
<P>
2<BR>
The blue head will inflict upon the white head<BR>
As much evil as France has done them good:<BR>
Dead at the sail-yard the great one hung on the branch.<BR>
When seized by his own the King will say how much.<BR>
<P>
3<BR>
Because of the solar heat on the sea<BR>
From Negrepont the fishes half cooked:<BR>
The inhabitants will come to cut them,<BR>
When food will fail in Rhodes and Genoa.<BR>
<P>
4<BR>
From Monaco to near Sicily<BR>
The entire coast will remain desolated:<BR>
There will remain there no suburb, city or town<BR>
Not pillaged and robbed by the Barbarians.<BR>
<P>
5<BR>
That which is enclosed in iron and letter in a fish,<BR>
Out will go one who will then make war,<BR>
He will have his fleet well rowed by sea,<BR>
Appearing near Latin land.<BR>
<P>
6<BR>
Near the gates and within two cities<BR>
There will be two scourges the like of which was never seen,<BR>
Famine within plague, people put out by steel,<BR>
Crying to the great immortal God for relief.<BR>
<P>
7<BR>
Amongst several transported to the isles,<BR>
One to be born with two teeth in his mouth<BR>
They will die of famine the trees stripped,<BR>
For them a new King issues a new edict.<BR>
<P>
8<BR>
Temples consecrated in the original Roman manner,<BR>
They will reject the excess foundations,<BR>
Taking their first and humane laws,<BR>
Chasing, though not entirely, the cult of saints.<BR>
<P>
9<BR>
Nine years the lean one will hold the realm in peace,<BR>
Then he will fall into a very bloody thirst:<BR>
Because of him a great people will die without faith and law<BR>
Killed by one far more good-natured.<BR>
<P>
10<BR>
Before long all will be set in order,<BR>
We will expect a very sinister century,<BR>
The state of the masked and solitary ones much changed,<BR>
Few will be found who want to be in their place.<BR>
<P>
11<BR>
The nearest son of the elder will attain<BR>
Very great height as far as the realm of the privileged:<BR>
Everyone will fear his fierce glory,<BR>
But his children will be thrown out of the realm.<BR>
<P>
12<BR>
Eyes closed, opened by antique fantasy,<BR>
The garb of the monks they will be put to naught:<BR>
The great monarch will chastise their frenzy,<BR>
Ravishing the treasure in front of the temples.<BR>
<P>
13<BR>
The body without soul no longer to be sacrificed:<BR>
Day of death put for birthday:<BR>
The divine spirit will make the soul happy,<BR>
Seeing the word in its eternity.<BR>
<P>
14<BR>
At Tours, Gien, guarded, eyes will be searching,<BR>
Discovering from afar her serene Highness:<BR>
She and her suite will enter the port,<BR>
Combat, thrust, sovereign power.<BR>
<P>
15<BR>
Shortly before the monarch is assassinated,<BR>
Castor and Pollux in the ship, bearded star:<BR>
The public treasure emptied by land and sea,<BR>
Pisa, Asti, Ferrara, Turin land under interdict.<BR>
<P>
16<BR>
Naples, Palermo, Sicily, Syracuse,<BR>
New tyrants, celestial lightning fires:<BR>
Force from London, Ghent, Brussels and Susa,<BR>
Great slaughter, triumph leads to festivities.<BR>
<P>
17<BR>
The field of the temple of the vestal virgin,<BR>
Not far from Elne and the Pyrenees mountains:<BR>
The great tube is hidden in the trunk.<BR>
To the north rivers overflown and vines battered.<BR>
<P>
18<BR>
New, impetuous and sudden rain<BR>
Will suddenly halt two armies.<BR>
Celestial stone, fires make the sea stony,<BR>
The death of seven by land and sea sudden.<BR>
<P>
19<BR>
Newcomers, place built without defense,<BR>
Place occupied then uninhabitable:<BR>
Meadows, houses, fields, towns to take at pleasure,<BR>
Famine, plague, war, extensive land arable.<BR>
<P>
20<BR>
Brothers and sisters captive in diverse places<BR>
Will find themselves passing near the monarch:<BR>
Contemplating them his branches attentive,<BR>
Displeasing to see the marks on chin, forehead and nose.<BR>
<P>
21<BR>
The ambassador sent by biremes,<BR>
Halfway repelled by unknown ones:<BR>
Reinforced with salt four triremes will come,<BR>
In Euboea bound with ropes and chains.<BR>
<P>
22<BR>
The imprudent army of Europe will depart,<BR>
Collecting itself near the submerged isle:<BR>
The weak fleet will bend the phalanx,<BR>
At the navel of the world a greater voice substituted.<BR>
<P>
23<BR>
Palace birds, chased out by a bird,<BR>
Very soon after the prince has arrived:<BR>
Although the enemy is repelled beyond the river,<BR>
Outside seized the trick upheld by the bird.<BR>
<P>
24<BR>
Beasts ferocious from hunger will swim across rivers:<BR>
The greater part of the region will be against the Hister, <BR>
The great one will cause it to be dragged in an iron cage,<BR>
When the German child will observe nothing.<BR>
<P>
25<BR>
The foreign guard will betray the fortress,<BR>
Hope and shadow of a higher marriage:<BR>
Guard deceived, fort seized in the press,<BR>
Loire, Saone, Rhone, Garonne, mortal outrage.<BR>
<P>
26<BR>
Because of the favor that the city will show<BR>
To the great one who will soon lose the field of battle,<BR>
Fleeing the Po position, the Ticino will overflow<BR>
With blood, fires, deaths, drowned by the long-edged blow.<BR>
<P>
27<BR>
The divine word will be struck from the sky,<BR>
One who cannot proceed any further:<BR>
The secret closed up with the revelation, <BR>
Such that they will march over and ahead.<BR>
<P>
28<BR>
The penultimate of the surname of the Prophet<BR>
Will take Diana [Thursday] for his day and rest:<BR>
He will wander far because of a frantic head,<BR>
And delivering a great people from subjection.<BR>
<P>
29<BR>
The Easterner will leave his seat,<BR>
To pass the Apennine mountains to see Gaul:<BR>
He will transpire the sky, the waters and the snow,<BR>
And everyone will be struck with his rod.<BR>
<P>
30<BR>
One who the infernal gods of Hannibal<BR>
Will cause to be reborn, terror of mankind<BR>
Never more horror nor worse of days<BR>
In the past than will come to the Romans through Babel.<BR>
<P>
31<BR>
In Campania the Capuan [river] will do so much<BR>
That one will see only fields covered by waters:<BR>
Before and after the long rain<BR>
One will see nothing green except the trees.<BR>
<P>
32<BR>
Milk, frog's blood prepared in Dalmatia.<BR>
Conflict given, plague near Treglia:<BR>
A great cry will sound through all Slavonia,<BR>
Then a monster will be born near and within Ravenna.<BR>
<P>
33<BR>
Through the torrent which descends from Verona<BR>
Its entry will then be guided to the Po,<BR>
A great wreck, and no less in the Garonne,<BR>
When those of Genoa march against their country.<BR>
<P>
34<BR>
The senseless ire of the furious combat<BR>
Will cause steel to be flashed at the table by brothers:<BR>
To part them death, wound, and curiously,<BR>
The proud duel will come to harm France.<BR>
<P>
35<BR>
The fire by night will take hold in two lodgings,<BR>
Several within suffocated and roasted.<BR>
It will happen near two rivers as one:<BR>
Sun, Sagittarius and Capricorn all will be reduced.<BR>
<P>
36<BR>
The letters of the great Prophet will be seized,<BR>
They will come to fall into the hands of the tyrant:<BR>
His enterprise will be to deceive his King,<BR>
But his extortions will very soon trouble him.<BR>
<P>
37<BR>
Of that great number that one will send<BR>
To relieve those besieged in the fort,<BR>
Plague and famine will devour them all,<BR>
Except seventy who will be destroyed.<BR>
<P>
38<BR>
A great number will be condemned<BR>
When the monarchs will be reconciled:<BR>
But for one of them such a bad impediment will arise<BR>
That they will be joined together but loosely.<BR>
<P>
39.<BR>
One year before the Italian conflict,<BR>
Germans, Gauls, Spaniards for the fort:<BR>
The republican schoolhouse will fall,<BR>
There, except for a few, they will be choked dead.<BR>
<P>
40<BR>
Shortly afterwards, without a very long interval,<BR>
By sea and land a great uproar will be raised:<BR>
Naval battle will be very much greater,<BR>
Fires, animals, those who will cause greater insult.<BR>
<P>
41<BR>
The great star will burn for seven days,<BR>
The cloud will cause two suns to appear:<BR>
The big mastiff will howl all night<BR>
When the great pontiff will change country.<BR>
<P>
42<BR>
Cock, dogs and cats will be satiated with blood<BR>
And from the wound of the tyrant found dead,<BR>
At the bed of another legs and arms broken,<BR>
He who was not afraid to die a cruel death.<BR>
<P>
43<BR>
During the appearance of the bearded star.<BR>
The three great princes will be made enemies:<BR>
Struck from the sky, peace earth quaking,<BR>
Po, Tiber overflowing, serpent placed upon the shore.<BR>
<P>
44<BR>
The Eagle driven back around the tents<BR>
Will be chased from there by other birds:<BR>
When the noise of cymbals, trumpets and bells<BR>
Will restore the senses of the senseless lady.<BR>
<P>
45.<BR>
Too much the heavens weep for the Androgyne begotten,<BR>
Near the heavens human blood shed:<BR>
Because of death too late a great people re-created,<BR>
Late and soon the awaited relief comes.<BR>
<P>
46<BR>
After great trouble for humanity, a greater one is prepared<BR>
The Great Mover renews the ages:<BR>
Rain, blood, milk, famine, steel and plague,<BR>
Is the heavens fire seen, a long spark running.<BR>
<P>
47<BR>
The great old enemy mourning dies of poison,<BR>
The sovereigns subjugated in infinite numbers:<BR>
Stones raining, hidden under the fleece,<BR>
Through death articles are cited in vain.<BR>
<P>
48<BR>
The great force which will pass the mountains.<BR>
Saturn in Sagittarius Mars turning from the fish:<BR>
Poison hidden under the heads of salmon,<BR>
Their war-chief hung with cord.<BR>
<P>
49<BR>
The advisers of the first monopoly,<BR>
The conquerors seduced for Malta:<BR>
Rhodes, Byzantium for them exposing their pole:<BR>
Land will fail the pursuers in flight.<BR>
<P>
50<BR>
When those of Hainault, of Ghent and of Brussels<BR>
Will see the siege laid before Langres:<BR>
Behind their flanks there will be cruel wars,<BR>
The ancient wound will do worse than enemies.<BR>
<P>
52<BR>
The blood of the just will commit a fault at London,<BR>
Burnt through lightning of twenty threes the six:<BR>
The ancient lady will fall from her high place,<BR>
Several of the same sect will be killed.<BR>
<P>
52<BR>
For several nights the earth will tremble:<BR>
In the spring two efforts in succession:<BR>
Corinth, Ephesus will swim in the two seas:<BR>
War stirred up by two valiant in combat.<BR>
<P>
53<BR>
The great plague of the maritime city<BR>
Will not cease until there be avenged the death<BR>
Of the just blood, condemned for a price without crime,<BR>
Of the great lady outraged by pretense.<BR>
<P>
54.<BR>
Because of people strange, and distant from the Romans<BR>
Their great city much troubled after water:<BR>
Daughter handless, domain too different,<BR>
Chief taken, lock not having been picked.<BR>
<P>
55<BR>
In the conflict the great one who was worth little<BR>
At his end will perform a marvelous deed:<BR>
While Adria will see what he was lacking,<BR>
During the banquet the proud one stabbed.<BR>
<P>
56<BR>
One whom neither plague nor steel knew how to finish,<BR>
Death on the summit of the hills struck from the sky:<BR>
The abbot will die when he will see ruined<BR>
Those of the wreck wishing to seize the rock.<BR>
<P>
57<BR>
Before the conflict the great wall will fall,<BR>
The great one to death, death too sudden and lamented,<BR>
Born imperfect: the greater part will swim:<BR>
Near the river the land stained with blood.<BR>
<P>
58<BR>
With neither foot nor hand because of sharp and strong tooth<BR>
Through the crowd to the fort of the pork and the elder born:<BR>
Near the portal treacherous proceeds,<BR>
Moon shining, little great one led off.<BR>
<P>
59<BR>
Gallic fleet through support of the great guard<BR>
Of the great Neptune, and his trident soldiers,<BR>
Provence reddened to sustain a great band:<BR>
More at Narbonne, because of javelins and darts.<BR>
<P>
60<BR>
The Punic faith broken in the East,<BR>
Ganges, Jordan, and Rhone, Loire, and Tagus will change:<BR>
When the hunger of the mule will be satiated,<BR>
Fleet sprinkles, blood and bodies will swim.<BR>
<P>
61<BR>
Bravo, ye of Tamins, Gironde and La Rochelle:<BR>
O Trojan blood! Mars at the port of the arrow<BR>
Behind the river the ladder put to the fort,<BR>
Points to fire great murder on the breach.<BR>
<P>
62<BR>
Mabus then will soon die, there will come<BR>
Of people and beasts a horrible rout:<BR>
Then suddenly one will see vengeance,<BR>
Hundred, hand, thirst, hunger when the comet will run.<BR>
<P>
64<BR>
The Gauls Ausonia will subjugate very little,<BR>
Po, Marne and Seine Parma will make drunk:<BR>
He who will prepare the great wall against them,<BR>
He will lose his life from the least at the wall.<BR>
<P>
64<BR>
The people of Geneva drying up with hunger, with thirst,<BR>
Hope at hand will come to fail:<BR>
On the point of trembling will be the law of him of the Cevennes,<BR>
Fleet at the great port cannot be received.<BR>

To be done through Hesperia and Insubria:<BR>

The Gallic King through his Celtic right arm<BR>
Seeing the discord of the great Monarchy:<BR>
He will cause his scepter to flourish over the three parts,<BR>
Against the cope of the great Hierarchy.<BR>
