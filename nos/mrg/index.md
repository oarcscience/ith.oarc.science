# Nostradamus (French-English)

This is a merged French and English version of the prophecies of
Nostradamus. Several variations of the French text are given, based on
the available versions. This is due to the non-standard orthography
which is typical of documents of the era.

This collection is not perfect as it is based on several inconsistent
Nostradamus archives found on the Internet which were collated
mechanically using a custom C program.

Not all verses are provided with an English translation; in some cases
the verse numbering may be out of synch.

There are few (English) verses which are apocryphal. They are marked
with an asterisk. These do not have a matching French version although
reputedly they are based on verses inserted into later French versions
of Nostradamus. They should not be considered authoritative in the
bibliographic sense.
