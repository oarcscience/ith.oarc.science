# Almanacs: 1564-1567

Almanac of 1564  

The sextile year rains, wheat to abound, hatreds,  
Joy to men, Princes, King divorced:  
Herd to perish, human mutations,  
People oppressed and poison under the surface.  

Times very diverse, discord discovered,  
Council of war, change taken in, changed:  
The Great Woman must not be, conspirators through water lost,  
Great hostility, for the great one all steady.  

The bit of the enemy's tongue approaches,  
The Debonair one to peace will want to reduce:  
The obstinate ones will want to lose the kinswoman,  
Surprised, Captives, and suspects fury to injure.  

Fathers and mothers dead of infinite sorrows,  
Women in mourning, the pestilent she-monster:  
The Great One to be no more, all the world to end,  
Under peace, repose and every single one in opposition.  

Princes and Christendom stirred up in debates,  
Foreign nobles, Christ's See molested:  
Become very evil, much good, mortal sight.  
Death in the East, plague, famine, evil treaty.  

Land to tremble, killed, wasteful, monster,  
Captives without number, to do, undone, done:  
To go over the sea misfortune will occur,  
Proud against the proud evil done in disguise.  

The unjust one lowered, they will molest him fiercely,  
Hail, to flood, treasure, and engraved marble:  
Chief of Persuasion people will kill to death,  
And attached will be the blade to the tree.  

Of what not evil? inexcusable result,  
The fire not double, the Legate outside confused:  
Against the worse wounded the fight will not be made,  
The end of June the thread cut by firing.  

Fine bonds enfeebled by accords,  
Mars and Prelates united will not stop:  
The great ones confused by gifts of mutilated bodies,  
Dignified ones, undignified ones will seize the well endowed.  

From good to the evil times will change,  
The peace in the South, the expectation of the Greatest Ones:  
The Great Ones grieving Louis too much more will stumble,  
Well-known Shaven Ones have neither power not understanding.  

This is the month for evils so many as to be doubled,  
Deaths, plague to drain all, famine, to quarrel:  
Those of the reverse of exile will come to note,  
Great Ones, secrets, deaths, not to censure.  

Through death, death to bite, counsel, robbery, pestiferous,  
They will not dare to attack the Marines:  
Deucalion a final trouble to make,  
Few young people: half-dead to give a start.  

Dead through spite he will cause the others to shine,  
And in an exalted place some great evils to occur:  
Sad concepts will come to harm each one,  
Temporal dignified, the Mass to succeed.  

Almanac of 1566  

For the greatest ones death, loss of honor and violence,  
Professors of the faith, their estate and their sect:  
For the two great Churches diverse noise, decadence,  
Evil neighbors quarreling serfs of the Church without a head.  

Waste, great loss, and not without violence,  
All those of the faith, more for religion,  
The Greatest Ones will lose their lives, their honor and fortunes  
Both the two Churches, the sin in their faction.  

For the two very Great Ones pernicious loss to arise,  
The Greatest Ones will cause loss, goods, of honor, and of life,  
As much great noises will run, the urn very odious,  
Great maladies to be, meeting-house, mass in envy.  

The servants of the Churches will betray their Lords,  
Of other Lords also by the undivided of the fields:  
Neighbors of meeting-house and mass will quarrel amongst them,  
Rumors, noises to augment, to death are several lying.  

Of all blessings abundance, the earth will produce for us,  
No din of war in France, sedition put outside:  
Man-slayers, robbers one will find on the highway,  
Little faith, burning fever, people in commotion.  

Between people discord, brutal enmity,  
War, death of great Princes, several parts:  
Universal plague, stronger in the West,  
Times good and full, but very dry and exhausted.  

The grains not to be plentiful, in all other fruits, plenty,  
The Summer, spring humid, winter long, snow, ice:  
The East in arms, France reinforces herself,  
Death of beasts much honey, the place to be besieged.  

Through pestilence and fire fruits of trees will perish,  
Signs of oil to abound. Father Denis not scarce:  
Some great ones to die, but few foreigners will sally forth in attack,  
Offense, Barbarian marines, and dangers at the frontiers.  

Rains very excessive, and of blessings abundance,  
The cattle price to be just, women outside of danger:  
Hail, rain, thunder: people depressed in France,  
Through death they will work, death to reprove people.  

Arms, plagues to cease, death of the seditious ones,  
Great Father Liber will not much abound:  
Evil ones will be seized by more malicious ones,  
France more than ever victorious will triumph.  

Up to this month the great drought will endure,  
For Italy and Provence all fruits to half:  
The Great One less of enemies prisoner of their band,  
For the scroungers, Pirates, and the enemy to die.  

The enemy so much to be feared to retire into Thrace,  
Leaving cries, howls, and pillage desolated:  
To leave noise on sea and land, religion murdered,  
Jovial Ones put on the road, every sect to become angry.
