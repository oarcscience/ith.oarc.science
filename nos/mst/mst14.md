### CHAPTER TWO

### Claude de Savoie

#### MORE MARS THAN NARBONNE

CLAUDE DE SAVOIE, Duke de Villars, Marshal-General of France, and the
man who was "more like Mars than Narbonne," was the hero of France in
the War of the Spanish Succession. That tragic struggle, which involved
all Europe from 1701 to 1713, is now chiefly notable for the victories
of the Duke of Marlborough, whose reputation has overshadowed that of
the scarcely less brilliant Villars.

The story of the war, told by Nostradamus virtually in headlines, is
extraordinary for its coverage and detail. His prophecy was superb, if
his reporting was somewhat prejudiced in favor of his King.

In these verses, as in a number of others about Louis XIV, the prophet
calls Louis the "Æmathion," which means a Macedonian Greek. The term is
a good illustration of Nostradamus’ power of condensed, laconic
expression in which art he could have given lessons to Lacon of Sparta.
In this one word, Æmathion, he has made an historical commentary on *Le
Grand Monarque*. The Capetian kings had a real, if shadowy,

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

claim to the blood of Alexander the Great since the days when a Russian
princess, descended from Philip of Macedon, Alexander's father, had
married an early king of France. Alexander the Great repudiated the
paternity of Philip, and called himself the son of the Sun, claiming
Apollo for his father. History has repudiated the paternity of the
Sun-king, Louis XIV, and his true father is unknown. Both Alexander and
Louis were warriors. The conquests of the former were dissipated after
he died, while Louis outlived his winnings, which went in this war.

The world will be approaching its last cycle,  
Saturn will be nearing its slow re-entry (into Aries),  
The empire (of Spain) will pass to a Germanic nation,  
The eye of the man of Narbonne will be torn out by those around him.

Because of a death, France will undertake a foreign expedition,  
The fleet will put to sea, the army will cross the Pyrenees,

Because royal ladies were conducted into France.

Oh, how the royal household shall sigh,  
What piteous conditions are around the son of Narbonne!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The great Æmathion will hold the harbor-mouth at Blaye  
Now cleared of English and Rochellese resistance,  
The Gauls who wait for help near Agen  
Will be fooled in their enterprise, the help will be for the man of
Narbonne.

javelins and darts of the enemy.

Presage I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Ocean and the Tyrrhenian Sea will be under the anchor-watch  
Of mighty Neptune and his trident soldiers,  
But Provence will be held in safety by the army of the great Tende,  
The heroic Villars whose nature will be more like Mars than Narbonne.

</div>

The mutation of Saturn and Jupiter in the warlike sign Aries introduced
the conflict. Spain was already declining, and Austria was the
continental rival of France. Two Spanish princesses married two French
Kings, Louis XIII and XIV. The Spanish King, dying without heir, willed
his realm to the part-Spanish grandson of Louis XIV. Spain was divided
over this arrangement, and the rest of Europe strenuously objected to
it. So Louis marched, the others countermarched with a counter claimant,
and the fight was on with everybody in it, including England.

Louvet, Louis’ war minister, was so jealous of Villars that he would not
give him command until a series of disasters had made the French
situation desperate. Marshal Villefroy, commanding for the French
against Prince Eugene of Savoy and the Duke of Marlborough, was beaten
and taken prisoner. Louis started out with two weak allies, and only a
German Elector stayed with him. Villars was given command after the
damage

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

had been done; he couldn't then stand up against Marlborough, and failed
in one battle to foresee his moves. He had his eyes snatched out
metaphorically in several ways. The fighting raged from the Danube to
the west coast of Spain, and from the lowlands to the Midi. This war saw
the first use of the technique so familiar today, the large-scale
devastation of areas affecting civilian population, and it was France
that used it. Louis was criticized by the rest of the civilized world
for doing it. "Livestock maddened by hunger"--but the prophet wouldn't
say that it was Louis' fault. Capet could do no wrong.

"The Foreign Soldier" is the Duke of Marlborough. Nostradamus sees him
attacking Louis, then an old man, unjustly. The avaricious mother who
put him up to it was Queen Anne's England. Marlborough was recalled, and
English feeling later turned against him. He was criticized on the home
front for the enormous slaughter of Englishmen which marked his
victories. Villars said to Louis after Malplaquet, "If our enemies win
one more such victory they are ruined."

The Celtic prelate was the Cardinal de Bouillon, who left France and
traveled secretly across Belgium under an escort from Marlborough.

Both candidates for the Spanish throne were in turn driven out, but
eventually Louis' grandson carried the day, with the rival, descendant
of an elder branch, out of the picture, and the era of the Spanish
Bourbons began.

England's trident soldiers won her Gibraltar in this

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

war and gave her "the anchor-watch" of the Mediterranean.

In the early part of the war, the Camisards, French Protestants,
revolted and expected help would come from the coalition; they awaited
it near Agen, but Villars broke their revolt, and the help did not come.

Villars was more than a match for Prince Eugene, and after Marlborough
had gone home, won the spectacular victory over him at Denain, which
ended the war. Voltaire called Villars "*fanfaron plein d’honneur*,"
which is very close to "more Mars than Narbonne." Nostradamus often uses
the part to denote the whole. He does this in his mention of "Provence
will be safely held--" He means France, but he wanted to imply a tribute
too in the recollection which Provence evokes of the earlier Claude de
Savoie, his friend, whose valor was more exclusively associated with
that part of France.
