### CHAPTER THREE

### In the Twentieth Century

As THIS LAST CHAPTER IS BEING assembled with the horrid word
"deadline"--Oh, anathema to writers!--ringing in the author's ears, one
portion of her attention is on the radio, one on the newspaper, and the
rest on the ancient quatrains, written so long ago, and yet so full of
meaning for those who live in the present day. Today's news is in the
prophecies of the *Centuries*. Russia and England are now fighting on
the same side, while war rages in the Orient, just as Nostradamus
predicted. Before this book is off the presses, more striking
predictions may have seen fulfillment. And perhaps there will be verses,
omitted here because their meaning was not yet clear, which will have
become clear through the rapid onrush of events. It is difficult to
indicate chronological sequence in events of the future, and any
interpreter's confusion on this point in unavoidable. Nostradamus may
have juggled order to further mask identification and meaning. Also many
of the quatrains had to be omitted for lack of space. Those most
pertinent to our time, and to the development

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

of the future, are given first consideration here.

The final chapter of the historic cycle of the Nostradamus predictions
is naturally the most exciting to us who live in the midst of its
predicted alarms and tragic drama and can foresee, in part, some of the
fearsome days of the future. Nostradamus has given in the course of the
Centuries many dates, both actual years and astronomically stated times.
He has not given, directly, the date for the emergence of France from
her yoke of bondage. But in the opinion of this author he has given it
in the number of his verses, one of the cryptic methods which he enjoyed
using for his half-concealments. The final edition of his work contained
ten Centuries which by right should have totaled a thousand quatrains.
There were but nine hundred and forty-four. If one takes these two facts
as giving the elements of a historic date, and adds them, the date is
1944.

This is not to be taken, however, as the date for the crowning of a new
king of France, but rather perhaps of his coming to the fore, or raising
the royal standard, together with a new attitude in France. In other
words, it is the turning point. Several verses indicate that the
stabilization of Europe, and the fullness of a new king's power will not
come until 1952-3.

The present Pretender to the French throne is Henri, Duc de Guise. He
corresponds in the facts of his life to the description given by the
prophet of the coming king. The last king of his line, he would be the

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

first to bear the name Henry since the founder of the Bourbon dynasty,
Henry of Navarre, and would complete the cycle of the house of
Bourbon-Orleans, whose first ruler was born within the lifetime of
Nostradamus.

#### 1914 AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A horrible war in the Occident draws near.  
The year following its outbreak there will be a scourge  
So powerful and terrible that young, old and livestock will be
affected.  
There will be blood and battle when Mercury, Mars and Jupiter are in
France.

</div>

In March, 1915, the second year of World War I, these three planets were
in conjunction in Pisces; the Sun, in the chart of the Third Republic,
is in the ninth degree of Virgo, the opposing sign to that of the
conjunction. The full Moon of that month, occurring March 1st, on the
day of the second battle of Ypres, fell on nine of Virgo, exactly on the
Sun of the Republic.

The new Moon of the 15th of March fell in Pisces, thus giving emphasis
to the other planets in that sign which, since it is opposite Virgo, is
the house of enemies of the government, and of war. It is in the
precision of such details as this that the vision of Nostradamus seems
the most fabulous. For vision it was. No

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

astrologer on earth, lacking the chart of the Republic (and it was then
of course unborn), could have made a forecast based upon it.

VI-81

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A bridge made of small boats will be quickly built (pontoons)  
To attack the great Prince of the Belgians.  
There will be fighting in trenches not far from Brussels,  
They (the enemy) will outstrip him, putting seven at a time to the
sword.

</div>

III-18

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

After a considerable period of plenty (forty-four years)  
The sky will touch the country around Rheims.  
Oh, what bloody conflict raging around the people of this locality,
draws near.  
Nor fathers, nor sons, nor rulers will dare go near it.

</div>

Around Rheims, center of the two battles of the Marne, the artillery
duel developed such clouds of smoke that the sky seemed to touch the
land, and the horror of so many dead deterred even relatives and
officials from the agony of the place. The prophet's picture is as
accurate as it is harrowing.

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

VIII-61

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Never shall the day dawn to attain the flag of rulership  
Until the seats of government are returned to their proper places  
And it will be the armed Cock (France)  
Who shall bear the gift of *Der Tag*.

</div>

III-7

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Fugitives, aerial warfare above the bayonets,  
Sportive ravens neighboring the conflict,  
The cry goes up from earth for heavenly aid and rescue  
When the fighting comes close to the walls (of Paris).

</div>

III-6

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A cannon shot shall enter within a closed church.  
The citizens within shall be killed in their refuge.  
Horses, cattle, and men shall suffer. The swelling wave will touch
them,  
Hunger and thirst will deplete them, even the weakest will be under
armes.

</div>

In 1917 a shot from a Big Bertha killed people in a church in Paris. The
Seine was very high that year, at times touching the walls.

VIII-48

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Saturn in Cancer, Jupiter with Mars,  
A university professor, wise as a Chaldean seer, under <span
id="page_342">p. 342</span> the aegis of a vigorous young nation, with
the fullest round measure will save the country in February.  
There will be the fall of Château-fort, and assault on three fronts.  
The conflict will take place near Serbia. It is a mortal war.

</div>

Saturn was in Cancer throughout the first six months of 1917, leaving
the sign at the end of June. On the 3rd of February Woodrow Wilson broke
off diplomatic relations with Germany. In June Mars and Jupiter came to
conjunction when the first American contingent of troops sailed for
France. Nothing could be more precise than this astronomical timing of
the period from the first cheering announcement to France of the break
which meant this country was coming in, to the sailing of the first
troops of the A.E.F. to "save the land."

Nostradamus made use of a triple anagram to characterize President
Wilson, which is a triumph of ingenuity and condensation.

III-71

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The inhabitants of the isles (Britain) will be blockaded for a long
time.  
They will summon their vigor and might against the enemies.  
Those outside shall die, defeated by hunger.  
They will experience a greater hunger than they have ever known.

</div>

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

IX-100

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A naval battle will be won in darkness.  
The fight will be disastrous to the Occidental navies.  
A new ruse will be employed, that of coloring the ships,  
There will be wrath toward the vanquished, and the victory won in a
drizzle of rain.

</div>

X-2

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The galleys will screen the ships of the line.  
The grand fleet will draw forth the lesser one.  
The ships will maneuver to encircle the opponent.  
The great navy, which is vanquished, will draw off and reassemble its
scattered units.

</div>

The battle of Jutland is very well indicated in these two verses and the
device of camouflage is duly observed by the prophet.

IV-12

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The larger of the countries will be routed and put to flight.  
It will hardly be pursued beyond the frontiers (of France).  
The country will be reconstructed and a region regained,  
Then all of the invaders will have been driven outside of France.

</div>

Alsace-Lorraine was regained by this war.

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

II-82

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Through hunger the wolf (Germany) will become the captive of its prey.  
The assailant will be driven to great distress.  
A man of high birth (the Kaiser) will arrive at his end.  
The great leader will not avoid the central pressure.

</div>

X-1

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The enemy, which is always the same enemy, faithless to its word,  
Will not stand fast, nor keep its captives. Its people will be
captives.  
Taken, overwhelmed, its people dead or stripped to their shirts,  
They will give all they have left to be helped.

</div>

VII-25

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The whole army will be exhausted by long war.  
There shall not be found money enough to pay off the troops.  
Money will be devalued to the worthlessness of stamped leather.  
The ancient Gaulish coinage will shrink (from full moon size) to a
crescent.

</div>

An illustration in the *Jour*, for the 26th of February, 1937, showed
coins of 1914 as a full moon, those for 1918 as half moon, those for
1936, a quarter

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

crescent, and those for 1937 as a thin crescent. (*Extrait du "Jour,"*
Georges Lachapelle, Les Finances de la III<sup>e</sup> République.)

VI-72

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

By frenzy feigning divine emotion  
The wife of a great and powerful man will suffer transgression.  
The judges desiring to condemn such teachings

The Czarina of Russia and the influence of Rasputin.

I-14

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Slavic nation will sing songs and chants, they will present their
petitions.  
Their Princes will be captured and their Lords imprisoned  
At the coming into power of brainless idiots

This is a clear picture of the Russian Revolution.

X-22

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For being unwilling to agree to separation,  
He will be recognized thereafter as unfitted and

King.

</div>

VIII-38

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When the kingdom is divided and quarreling over the brothers,  
One of them will take the arms and name of Britain.  
The English title (of the other) will be tardily considered.  
Night overtaking him, he will leave for France.

These are the events around the abdication of Edward VIII.

\*

V-49

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Not from Spain but from ancient France  
Shall be he who is elected to guide the tossing barque of the Church.  
He will have trust in the enemy,  
Who during his reign shall become a great scourge.

</div>

In the papal elections of 1922 many thought that the papacy would go to
the Spanish cardinal, Merry del Val. It was given instead to Monsignor
Ratti, Pius XI, who though Italian, came from what was anciently
Cisalpine Gaul.

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

V-92

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

After the elevation to the papacy, which will last for seventeen
years,  
Five will change in the revolution of this term,  
Then one will be elected from the same time  
Who will not be very conformable to the Romans.

</div>

Pope Pius XI reigned seventeen years. The five governments which
underwent changes in his time were Italy, Germany, Austria,
Czechoslovakia and Spain. Pius XII is not too "conformable" to
Mussolini's ideas.

\*

#### THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS

V-13

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Near Lake Leman there will be a house of prostitution  
Presided over by a foreign woman, who will seek to betray the city.  
Before she is murdered by the Germans, there will be a great flight.  
Then those from the Rhineland will begin their invasion.

</div>

The house is the League of Nations, run by foreign policies.
Nostradamus, as we have seen, in earlier quatrains here included, did
not trust the League.

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

X-49

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The garden of the world where is the New City (Geneva),  
Situated in the corridor between two mountains,  
Will be seized and plunged into the vat  
And forced to drink the envenomed, sulphurous waters.

</div>

I-47

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

At Lake Leman the preachments will cause irritation.  
Days will drag into weeks,  
Then months, then years. Then they will fade away completely  
And the Judges will condemn their empty laws.

</div>

IX-92

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The King will desire to enter into the New City  
But his enemies will eventually drive him out.  
A captive, he will be free. False things will be spoken and
perpetrated.  
The King, living outside, will keep himself aloof from his enemies.

</div>

The captive king is Haile Selassie.

II-64

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The gentry of Geneva will be parched with hunger and thirst. <span
id="page_349">p. 349</span>  
Their closest hope will eventually fade away.  
The imposition of the law will have the Genevese trembling on the point
of war,  
But the fleet will not be able to protect itself in the great port
(Toulon)

</div>

Yes, that was the time they imposed the Italian sanctions and the
British fleet backed down.

I-100

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For a long time in the sky a gray bird will be seen Near  
Dole and the land of Tuscany  
Holding in its beak a green branch.  
Soon the great man will die and he will conclude the war.

</div>

The reference to the dove and the olive branch of the League of Nations
seems to close with a reference to the death of Woodrow Wilson. Perhaps
the exigencies of rhyme induced the prophet to mention his concluding
war, after the man "will die". The meaning is clear enough, but
cart-before-horse.

II-23

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The palace birds will be driven off by another bird (German eagle)  
Soon after the prince (Hitler) comes into power.  
How many times that enemy (Germany) has been driven back across the
river (Rhine). <span id="page_350">p. 350</span>  
Caught outside its own country the tether of the bird has been seized
and held.

</div>

I-87

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The central fire of the earth which causes temblors  
Will make a trembling around the new city.  
Two great boulders will for a long time make war (England and Germany)  
Then Arethusa's fountain will be red with a new flood.

</div>

II-39

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A year before Italy is in the conflict  
The Germans, French and Spanish will be struggling for power.  
The schoolhouse of the republic will fall (League of Nations)  
It and its people stifled to death.

</div>

IV-59

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Two will be besieged with burning anger.  
They will quench their thirst in two level cups,  
To the strong man who has had the edges of his power filed off, and to
the old dreamer.  
And to the Genevese, will be exhibited the track of the Aryan country.

</div>

The two besieged, or limited, by the League, are Hitler and Mussolini
quenching their thirst for power

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

with Czechoslovakia and Ethiopia. The strong man is Daladier; the
dreamer, Chamberlain.

\*

#### 1940

II-40

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A little later, but no great interval,  
By land and sea will come the great tumult.  
Naval warfare on a scale greater than ever  
With explosions and guns will increase the onslaught.

</div>

V-85

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Germans and their neighbors  
Will be in a war for the control of the regions of the clouds.  
The country will suffer from marine locusts and from gnats (hydroplanes
and airplanes),  
The faults of Geneva will be laid bare.

</div>

III-12

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Through the tumult that reigns along the Ebro, the Tagus, the Tiber, and
at Rome  
As well as at Geneva and around the man who is like Aretino,  
The two great headwaters and the cities of the Garonne will be affected,
<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>  
Captives, dead and injured, the human booty will be divided up.

</div>

One can only say that the comparison of Mussolini to Aretino is
unflattering to the early journalist and satirist.

\*

#### THE SPANISH REVOLUTION

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Greek dame of despicable beauty  
With her lucky achievement of innumerable civil processes,  
Will be imported into Spain,  
Where she will be captured and perish miserably.

</div>

Because of the Greek ideas which characterized the French Revolution and
Directorate, foreseen by Nostradamus, he usually calls a government *la
dame*, and uses throughout the *Centuries* the Greek Woman, or Castula
to signify it. Here he sees the importation of democratic principles
into Spain, crystallized in the Spanish Republic.

I-19

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When they shall complete the area of the Coffin  
The Spaniards will make trouble for their aristocratic blood.  
Their population will be greatly decimated, <span id="page_353">p.
353</span>  
Their leader will be in flight, hidden by the troughs of blood.

</div>

The author has seen a newspaper reference to the flight of the late
ex-King, Alfonso, in a boat carrying a cargo of fresh-killed meat, but
cannot cite the reference.

The reference to the Coffin area is fascinating. Bertina Harding, in
*The Phantom Crown*, tells how young Maximilian visited the tombs of his
ancestors while in Spain in 1856. "The mystery of Philip II's oracle
confronted him. In the octagon-shaped chamber, at the center of the
mausoleum, the eccentric monarch had fitted out a permanent abode for
his embalmed ancestors. That was not all. After providing accommodation
for ten defunct forebears, he had added with dreadful insight, space for
as many crowned successors to himself as he deemed probable. Tier on
tier the marble coffins stood, thirty in all. And only three were empty
. . . but the Queen, Isabella II, was fitting up a nursery in her palace
at Madrid for this expected heir, Alfonso XII. Would there then be but
one more Alfonso? A thirteenth? The Archduke fell into uncomfortable
reflections while a phlegmatic guide rattled a bunch of keys.

"'When they are quite full', the man said, pointing at the coffins, 'we
will get the Republic.'"

The construction of the tombs (the Coffin) was probably begun by Philip
II during the lifetime of Nostradamus.

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

X-48

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

In the southernmost part of Spain the standard will be raised  
And will go out to the end and the confines of Europe.  
The revolution will touch closely the bridgehead of the Aisne.  
It will be defeated by the great expedition of a coalition.

</div>

It is generally recognized that Franco's revolt was the real beginning
of the present world war.

VI-64

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

No one will keep any treaties of peace.  
All who accept them will agitate through deceit.  
While peace and truce are protested by land and sea  
At Barcelona the fleet will be caught in its activity.

</div>

III-75

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Pau, Verona, Vicence, Saragossa (throughout Spain and Italy)  
There will be the long swords, the lands humid with blood.  
The corruption of the great granary will be so great  
That though help will be near, the remedies will be very far off.

</div>

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

VI-10

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For a time the Church will follow its colors,  
Black and white, the two will be intermingled.  
The reds and yellows will seem to be like their own.  
The land will suffer blood, scourge, hunger, battle and will be maddened
by revolution.

</div>

The robes of nuns and of the priesthood are black and white. Red and
yellow are the Spanish colors. Franco's party will have the confidence
of the Church for a while, because ostensibly the Franco revolt is on
behalf of royal restoration.

X-14

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Republic of Valencia, without guidance, and by reason of its
nature  
Will be hardy and timid by turns. Seized by fear, it will be
conquered.  
Accompanied by its pale prostitutes  
It will be convicted in the prisons of Barcelona.

In place of the wife, the daughters will be killed.  
Murdered by a criminal fault which will not be allowed to endure.  
Little clad, within trenches they will be overwhelmed.  
The wife will quench her thirst in the Italian Sea.

</div>

The wife is the royal government whose principles will survive, though
her children are murdered.

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

VI-19

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The true flame will engulf the government  
Which wished to put to death the innocents.  
Near the time of assault the at my will become inflamed,  
And one will see a prodigious thing in the Bull of Seville.

III-62

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Near the Douro, the sea of Cap Cires not having been cut off,  
The great mountains of the Pyrenees will be pierced.  
The man with the short hand and the pierced tongue (a criminal; meaning
the survivors of the Republic)  
Will carry his plots into the south of France near Carcassonne.

</div>

IV-70

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Contiguous to the Pyrenees  
A leader will raise a great force against the eagle (Italy),  
Exposed and futile forces will be exterminated.  
The leader will be pursued as far as Navarre.

III-19

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

In the south of Spain both blood and prosperity will be spent.  
A little before they change their proconsul  
There will be great scourge and war; famine and thirst will be seen.  
Their prince, their great warden, will die away from his own land.

</div>

The recent death of Alfonso XIII confirms his prophecy for Spain's
"great warden."

#### THE SECOND GREAT WAR

II-56

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When corruption and massacre have not put a stop to the situation  
And there is death in the bomb-craters struck from high heaven,  
The head of the Church will die when he sees the ruin  
And those who are shipwrecked clinging to the rock.

</div>

The death of Pius XI in 1939 six months before the outbreak of war.

I-91

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The myths acting in human guise  
Will be the authors of this great conflict. <span id="page_358">p.
358</span>  
Before serene heaven, sword and lance  
Will be a less mighty affliction than will be the trend toward the left
hand.

</div>

The meaning of this is that the old gods and myths revived will dominate
human action. Such a revival has been seen in Germany, and Hitler's
belief in his relationship to the figures in Wagnerian drama is well
known to all readers of magazines and newspapers today. The left hand
meant in the prophet's day, not Communism but peace or
[pacifism](errata.htm#14). This verse, from a man of peace, is a
powerful indictment of the prewar policy of his country.

Interesting is the phraseology of a *New York Times* editorial (June 22,
1941) on the subject of myths, commenting on a speech by President
Conant, of Harvard: "President Conant's new nihilists are the people who
believe in the Myth as the great motive force in history. To stir the
masses you don't need to tell them the truth. Just tell them anything
that gets them excited."

III-26

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The kings and the princes will raise up chimeras.  
There will be empty prophecies and divination will be exalted.  
The golden horn of plenty will be a victim, and from the heaven of the
cruel  
Will come the interpretations of the oracles.

</div>

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

Everyone has heard that Hitler uses astrology and other occult methods
to guide his life and activities as well as the destiny of Germany.

VII-14

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Natural topography will come to be falsely abandoned.  
The monuments created for posterity will stand as open as pitchers.  
Factions will multiply, philosophy will be proclaimed.  
Black will be put for white, and green wine drunk for ancient vintage.

</div>

Presage 27

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Aerial warfare will be over the shores of the Occident,  
And of the Midi, rushing even to the Levant.  
About half the people will die without being able to take root.  
This third age shall belong to Mars the Warrior.  
The Firebrands will make their appearance to light the fires,  
It is the age of the Firebrand, and its end is famine.

X-99

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The end of the wolf, the lion, the bull, the ass

#### ITALY AND SPAIN

VII-32

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Born in a hovel and elevated to a regal height  
Is he who, empty and vain, will come to tyrannize over the land.  
He will raise a force for the march from Milan,  
He will exhaust Fayence and Florence of men and money.

</div>

This is Mussolini, even to the "march," by train, from Milan.

VI-36

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It is not by earthly battle that good or evil  
Will rule the confines of the Perusian plain (Italy).  
Pisa and Florence, through revolution, will see the birth of
misfortune.  
The King wounded by night will be lifted up on his mule and set upon a
black saddle-cloth.

</div>

The wounding of Victor Emmanuel is metaphorical, as is the black
saddle-cloth of Fascism.

II-65

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The calamity of a declining economy will afflict  
Spain and there will be disaster for Italy. <span id="page_361">p.
361</span>  
The Church will be inflamed, there will be corruption and captivity  
When Mercury is in the sign of the Archer and Saturn becomes a usurer.

</div>

Saturn in Aries is associated with acquisitiveness. The prophet appears
here to indicate the period of January 1938, when Saturn entered the
sign and Mercury became direct in Sagittarius, to January of 1939 when
Saturn turned direct preparatory to leaving the sign, and again Mercury
was in the Archer's sign. Nostradamus pays close attention to the times
when the planets change from retrograde to direct motion, as did all of
the older astrologers who would have noted these details in the
prophet's mention of astronomical timing. This time was a period of new
and grave economic problems for both Italy, which had not then entered
the war, and for the United States whose economic policy, born of the
war, was not then fully formulated. The death of a pope during this
period would have been felt by Nostradamus as a further deep affliction
to Italy.

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

This verse seems to describe 1940 in the spring, when Mussolini's agents
were active on all fronts before his entrance into the war. He of the
Calf is Hitler born under Taurus, sign of the Bull, Ox or Calf. The
prophet here implies that he is not only Taurus, but the Golden Calf as
well. He, Hitler, was, as one recalls, busily explaining that he had
nothing against the French--only their government.

given.

It was the Mediterranean defeats of the Italian navy which paralyzed the
power of Italy and threw her at the mercy of Britain, causing Hitler to
move in and take control.

Leopards were the famous device of the Plantagenets, and Richard I, the
Crusader, carried them to the Orient. This provides one analogy to the
present crusade of England, and the fact that the Mediterranean battles
were fought for control of the Eastern bases.

This warlike conjunction will occur on November 12, 1947. It would seem
to indicate General Franco, whose prestige has always been bound up with
his African influence; it was from the coast of Africa that he planned

### THE COMING OF HITLER

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Germany will give birth to divers creeds  
Strongly resembling a happy paganism.

The people will return to their payment of the true tithe.

</div>

The bi-sexual interests of Hitler have been frequently commented on in
the press. Late and early refers to the long interval elapsing between
the fall of the monarchy and this modern restoration, which will begin
early in the great struggle (1944).

IX-68

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Elector of Saxony. His "reform" movement will not be lasting.

He will himself usurp the power of the people and the city.

</div>

Probably no one will [need](errata.htm#15) to have it pointed out that
the dramatis personae of this verse are Hitler, France and *Mein Kamp*f.

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

Stained with murder and enormous adulteries,

This sounds like what a large part of the world thinks of Adolf Hitler
today, and recalls to the frivolous, "his sisters and his cousins and
his aunts etc."

IV-66

Divers experimenters will sow their seed.

It has been noted that Hitler, who was inspired by Mussolini's success,
has consistently surrounded himself with seven leaders who carry out his
orders and develop his ideas. Whether this is happenstance or related to
some of his ideas on occultism is not known, but the number seven has
some association with the occult in the minds of many and its legends
are very ancient.

A week after they are faced with the cruel issue.

</div>

This very well describes conditions after the fall of France. The author
does not know the exact number of members of the former government now
dead or imprisoned at Rion; but it is close on seven. France, through
Clemenceau, was responsible for the peace of Versailles.

VIII-13

372</span>  
The enraged woman whose fleet has sailed for a thou-sound years  
Will drink bitter brew, thereafter both shall perish.

</div>

This verse is as puzzling as it is intriguing. The Bellerophon was the
ship that took Napoleon to Saint Helena. Here it is a symbol of England.
Classically, Bellerophon was a hero who retired after involuntarily
causing the death of Praytus, his friend and hunting companion, while
both were guests in the house of Praytus' father-in-law. The meaning
could be that England allied with a government of France, the Republic
(which is not the true son of France but an in-law), while both are
guests of France, will meet tragedy; that England (at Dunquerque) will
be responsible for the death of (Praytus) the French government.

Then the symbolism changes, and seems to indicate Britannia, "for a
thousand years" a sea-going power from the days of William the
Conqueror, will taste defeat, and thereafter both Britain and her
antagonist, Germany, the crossed brother, will perish.

VI-99

</div>

Rudolf Hess is said to have fled because his mind was troubled at the
thought of occupation and war in the Holy Land which shocked his
Catholicism. The horned bull is Hitler, the Taurean, who has brought the
war to the Holy Land.

When the *Robin Moo*r was sunk the *New York World-Telegram* carried a
story from the survivors which stated that the submarine hoisted no
flag, but was painted with the large device of a red bull. So that it
would seem that not only the forces of Hitler, but also his actual
astrological insignia are in evidence in the far places.

This seems to mean Hitler's destruction by his own people.

England, so called because of her policy of the balance of power.

Closed up again, it will be ravished, a horrible prey to the populace.

</div>

This may refer to the gold hoard of the United States; or it may have
reference to Spain, known to the ancients as Hesperus, and often so
designated by Nostradamus.

III-3

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mars, Mercury and the Moon in conjunction  
Will produce extreme scarcity throughout the south of Europe.  
In southernmost Asia the earth will quake (or there will be revolt).  
Corinth and Ephesus will then be in a quandary.

</div>

This triple conjunction last occurred September 2nd, 1940, just before
the invasion of Greece.

Nostradamus lived too near the time of Jeanne d’Arc, and he was too
passionately French, to feel other than jealousy and distrust of
England, a power which he saw steadily expanding through centuries to
greater possessions than his own nation. From early times a prophecy of
the downfall of England had been handed down from the Welsh prophet,
Merlin. Eustache Deschamps, the French bard of the early fifteenth
century, used the Merlin prophecy in one of his satiric poems.
Nostradamus has come very near to

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

copying it. Both of these troubadours hoped Merlin was right, and,
because of that, one may perhaps discount something of the gloom that
hangs about Nostradamus’ forecasts for England. The lines of Deschamps
are these.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

According to the prophet of the Isle of Giants,  
Which has since been called Albion,  
The people were tardily converted to a belief in God.  
The Isle will be completely desolated.  
Through their pride will come their day of hardship  
Concerning which their prophet Merlin  
Predicted their dolorous end  
When he wrote: "you will lose life and land."  
When that has happened, men will point out to foreigners and those from
neighboring countries  
Where in former times there was England.

</div>

Nostradamus elaborates on the theme in the following verses. No specific
dates are indicated in these prophecies for England, some of which may
be quite distant.

X-100

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

England will be a great empire,  
The all-powerful land surrounded by water will endure for more than
three hundred years.  
Her commerce will traverse sea and land,  
The Portuguese will not be satisfied with that.

</div>

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

Portugal was the great maritime rival of Britain at the time Nostradamus
wrote this. There is something deeply symbolic in the fact that this
verse is the closing one of the *Centuries*. It is as if there were an
implication that the end of England would be the end of the world as we
know it. It is like the old saying about Rome: "While stands the
Colosseum, Rome shall stand, when falls the Colosseum, Rome shall fall,
and when Rome, falls the world." The civilized world today has a similar
feeling about England and her relationship to all that is held free and
precious.

III-70

Hitler's main objectives.

These curious lines, which seem only applicable to 1940, admit that
France has played a not quite heroic part--a great admission for the
prophet. Yet he manages to blame England for not following in the
footsteps of France.

X-32

It was all right with Nostradamus when England blockaded the seas in

1941, and England is then "dog in the manger."

Sir Thomas More, contemporary of the prophet and author of Utopia, was

#### FRANCE AND THE PAPACY

VI-74

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The government which was driven out shall return to power,  
Its enemies will be named as conspirators.  
More than ever its times will triumph  
For three and seventy years until death well assured.

</div>

This is a peculiarly interesting verse. In his letter to King Henry the
prophet speaks of "the great trembling of the earth together with the
increase of the new Babylon, wretched daughter (of the Revolution),
augmented by the abomination of the first holocaust

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (1792). It will
hold its power for just seventy-three years and seven months. Then there
shall issue from the long barren tree (of the monarchy), born at the
50th Parallel (latitude of the Franco-Belgian border), one who will
revitalize the entire Christian Church. And there shall be created a
peace, union and concord between the children of opposed and separate
races."

If 1944, as previously analyzed from the number of verses and Centuries
(this author may possibly be alone in seeing such a connection;
certainly the first to say so), it [constitutes](errata.htm#16)
Nostradamus’ date for the beginning of "France Second," over which the
new and great Henry V is to rule.

If to the date of the Battle of Sedan, September 1st, 1870, the
seventy-three years and seven months of the prophet are added, it brings
us to March, 1944. If the seventy-three years are subtracted from the
date of the downfall of Napoleon III at Sedan one gets 1797, dating the
rise of Napoleon I. Napoleon III died in 1873, which is a kind of echo
of the number. Nostradamus mentions, not in a prophetic connection, the
Hebrew prophet Joel. This is in the letter to the King. It seemed odd to
single out for no reason this one short Biblical book and not to refer
to other prophets. But on looking into Joel, one discovers that the book
has just three chapters and seventy-three verses. The French Republic
has had three chapters too, the First, Second and Third Republics. This
number 73 is a peculiar one.

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

Nostradamus gives the precise date of the French Revolution, also in the
letter to the King. "Then will be seen the beginning of events of long
duration, and in the first year there will be a great persecution of the
Christian Church. This will break out in the year one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-two. The people will think that it is a renewing of
the age."

If 1792 is taken as a starting point, and two additions of the number of
Joel, 73, are made, one has the date of 1938.

Returning to the quatrain, the verse of course refers to the government
of Napoleon I, which returned to power under Louis Napoleon. Yet as has
been shown, the verse has a much more subtle application, and the
seventy-three years does not refer to the tenure of power of either man,
but to cycles which included their years. The rise of one and the
downfall of the other give points of reference for use of the number.

Nostradamus severely blamed Louis Philippe, whose reign was the
beginning of the Second Republic, in other verses, for his catering to
democratic ideas, and

#### DISCOVERY OF THE TOMB OF A SAINT

The fascinating prophecy given below concerns the finding of a tomb of
some early Christian saint, which is to happen in April of whatever
year. The prophet does not indicate a closer date except that the "new
party" will be founded upon the bones of the saint,

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

whom he calls the Great Roman. This presumably means the Christian
royalist party of the coming King. The saint may possibly be one of the
early Christians of the time of Trajan, who journeyed into Gaul and died
there. Under Trajan the Roman Empire reached its greatest expansion of
territory. It also achieved a very high and wide-spread culture. The
persecution of Christians was, however, very severe. The verses seem to
point to an analogy between Trajan and the imperialist ambitions of
Mussolini, who is perhaps typified in the mention of Prince Ulpian.
Trajan's name was Marcus Ulpius Trajan. Nostradamus’ reference to the
golden lamp of Trajan would seem to mean the spiritual lamp of
Christianity which, though buried under persecution, still glows in its
secret place in the old Roman province, now Provence. The parallel is
made by the prophet between the persecuted Christians of Trajan's day,
of whom the old saint may have been one, and the modern Christians,
whose lamp must also burn in secret, persecuted by dictators.

#### THE RISE OF THE ORIENT

The author, sometime ago, cited some of the predictions in the following
verses to a well-known military commentator. He said that they were not
news. That men in his particular work who were always scanning future
horizons for long-range prophecies of their own had long accepted the
rise of the Orient as a fait accompli of the future, and that for this
reason the political forecasters gave triple attention to every item
that came out of Asia and Africa. Nostradamus in his own day saw the
might of the Orient and its menace to Christian Europe, and he knew that
cycles return.

VIII-5 9

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The forces of the Turban will be taken captive.  
Help will come by sea from a great leader of Portugal.  
This will happen on the twenty-fifth of May, the day of Saint Urban.

</div>

Probably the prophet looks back from this advanced time to what is
Portugal today, as this is a small country and may be incorporated in a
large one. A modern French commentator, realizing its size, says,
naïvely enough, that Portugal will send for the U. S. fleet!

#### THE END OF THE AGE

Not only ever since the Christian era, but long before in the songs and
lamentations of the Hebrew prophets, the end of the great precessional
era of the

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fishes, Pisces,
has been foretold in a wealth of tragic and saddening detail. It is not
the end of the world, as many people of old times thought, but the end
of a grand period, and the birth of a new age with a different type of
thought and civilization. Nostradamus prophesied that it would be marked
by the downfall of old Europe, and be ushered in with earthquakes and
eclipses such as the Bible describes in the scene of the Crucifixion.

Science recognizes that from time to time the earth changes the
inclination of its axis. They know this from fossil remains (which, for
example, show that Alaska had once a warm climate, and other localities
show that similar changes have taken place). But science has no
knowledge of what causes this change, nor in what cycle of years its
return may be expected. Nor does Nostradamus specify the date for this
occurrence, but by implication he links it with the phenomenon of the
double eclipse which will take place in 1999.

The two eclipses will occur in the sign Leo, a partial one on July 28th,
and a total one on August 11. The event is a very rare astronomical
phenomenon. Camille Flammarion wrote of it in detail. All astronomers
then living will prepare to observe it with every advanced resource of
scientific equipment. Nostradamus, in both his letter to the King and in
his verses, has given his picture of what he predicts will affect the
entire world. Science is just beginning to have an understanding of
terrestrial phenomena, such as floods and earthquakes, coming as the
result of celestial phenomena, the doctrine

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

held by astrologers for thousands of years. Science has arrived at some
limited conclusions forced by the necessity for better long-range
weather forecasting. But the study of earthquakes, floods and volcanoes,
made in the light of the gravitational and magnetic strains and stresses
of the Sun, Moon and planets, is still in its infancy and as yet almost
nothing is known about it. The wise men of old knew these things, and
Nostradamus knew them. He needed no telescope for the double eclipse,
and he not only saw it, but he saw the train of events that came with
it, something no giant telescope can show.

In his letter to the King the prophet has this to say of the last years
of the twentieth century:

"Then shall begin the great empire of Antichrist in the invasions of
Xerxes and Attila ('one who will revive the King of the Angoumois,' and
the Oriental invasion) who will come with a countless throng, so that
the advent of the Holy Spirit, from the 48th parallel, will make a great
change and chase away the abomination of Antichrist that made war on the
sovereign Vicar of Christ (the Pope) and against his Church for a time
and to the end of time. This will be preceded by an eclipse of the Sun,
of denser darkness than has ever been seen since the Creation and up to
the passion and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and from that time until
the coming one. There will take place in the month of October a great
translation made so that the earth will seem to lose the weight of its
natural motion in an abyss of endless darkness. There will be
premonitory

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

signs in the spring, and there will be extreme changes, overthrows of
kingdoms, and earthquakes."

"In the last period all the Christian kingdoms, and those of the
infidels, will be shaken for twenty-five years. The wars and battles
will be more injurious. Towns, cities, castles, and other buildings will
be burned, laid waste, and destroyed, with great bloodshed of vestals,
violation of wives and widows, and children at the breast dashed and
broken against the walls of the towns. Satan, the prince infernal, will
commit so many evils that nearly the whole world will be afflicted and
desolated.

"After this has endured for a certain length of time, Saturn will almost
renew his cycle (twenty-nine years), but God the Creator will bring an
age of gold. He will heed the affliction of His people, and He will bind
Satan and throw him into the abyss. Then shall begin between God and man
a universal peace, and Satan will be bound for a thousand years. Then
the cycle will return in grand power, Satan will be once more unbound
against the Church."

This configuration occurs in April, 1998. It is in that year that
Nostradamus predicts the great invasion of France. The path of the solar
eclipse, which will be total, passes through northern France and
Belgium.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The last but one to be called Pope  
Will take Diana for his day and his repose,  
He will wander afar on account of his distracted head,  
Seeking to deliver a great people from economic oppression.

</div>

Diana is the Moon, so that Monday will be the Pope's day of rest. The
Moon rules changes, travels and voyagings, and it is involved in mental
frenzies and distracted mentalities. In the famous prophecy of Malachi,
in his descriptions of the popes yet to come he names third before
Petrus Romanus (the last one named) *De Medietate Lunae*. De Medietate
Lunae means "relating to the half-Moon, which is the crescent of Diana."
Malachi's further description of this pope is: "From the half-moon
proceeds this pope sent to Rome by the Divine Doctor, Hail, our
well-beloved Pius XII, most holy Mediator, future victim." The

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

present incumbent of the holy See is Pius XII, and more than any
previous pope he has "wandered afar." But otherwise the description does
not fit, nor does he come in the order given by Malachi. According to
the Monk of Padua there will be two popes after the Lunar, and three
more before him. Nostradamus names him as the "penultimate" pope. In the
times of the Avignon popes and the Great Schism Cardinal Pietro di Luna
was one of the false popes. Eustache Deschamps, a famous satiric poet of
that time, whose writings were not only familiar to Nostradamus but
imitated and quoted by him, wrote a satire called, "Of the Schism in the
Church Which is Much Troubled by the Moon" (Luna). Some of Nostradamus’
lines are very close to lines in this satire.
