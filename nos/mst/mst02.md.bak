### Foreword

THE RICH, ACTIVELY FULFILLED LIFE of the French prophet, Michel de
Nostradame, is the story of genius not only in its rarest but its most
modern form. His ability foreshadowed a hope, now gaining a first
hearing in this our day, that science may, in some not too remote
tomorrow, discover principles of mental forces which will permit every
man to realize within himself a reflection of the powers of Nostradamus.

Many prophets have crossed the brightly lighted stage of history and
paused to utter some astounding bit of prescience. But they are seldom
remembered for more than a single episode, some ray of strange
illumination that for a moment spotlighted the fate of a throne or a
battle. Actually there exist but two written documents of prophecy which
have pictured a grand-scale continuity of history, and unfolded a
tapestry of world futures. One of these is, of course, the mighty word
of Scripture. The other is that cryptic romaunt of Europe's fate, the
*Centuries*, written by Nostradamus, Provençal troubadour of destiny.

No one knows as yet what forces shape a prophet, nor how it is that to
"remembrance of things past," he adds "remembrance of the things that
are to come." Perhaps the Red Queen knew more about it than most.

When Alice asked her why she cried out before, instead of after, she had
pricked her finger, her majesty sagely observed that it is a poor rule
which doesn't work both ways. Nostradamus would have enjoyed that bit of
wit, so like his own, and pertinent to prophecy.

What is "before" and "after"? What is up or down when considered outside
the limited, inaccurate criteria of the five senses? The
fourth-dimensional vision of Nostradamus, like the Red Queen's cry,
transcended the meanings which we give these words. The man who saw
through time watched, as through a telescope, the distant stars of
future events rise and set, beyond the eye of the present, over a period
of four hundred years.

"Heaven from all creatures hide the book of Fate,

Pope was within his sceptical rights when he penned that couplet,
because the vaticinating exceptions among heaven's creatures have always
been so few that for people as a whole his words were true. Another
Englishman, the modernist Dean Inge, had however a better perspective.
As a churchman he accepted prophecy. As an intelligent modern he said
that the phenomenon of prevision was quite possibly part of an
evolutionary process which would one day become a developed faculty
general to man. Considered in this light, Nostradamus, astounding as are
his prophecies, is himself,

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

the man, of even greater fascination than his work, because he attained
in its completeness the faculty to which it is at least a possibility
that all may eventually aspire.

It was only a few years ago that several thousand New Yorkers unhinged
one of the bronze doors of the American Museum of Natural History in an
effort to hear a talk that few could understand when heard. The lecture
was on the mathematics of the strange, and to them, new, fourth
dimension which they had visualized, confounding it with the psychic
world, as opening exciting secret vistas and miraculous powers. Such an
incident is indicative of a dawning intensity of popular interest in the
world of unseen forces, physical and metaphysical. Vitamins and visions,
telescopes and telepathy, all go together as part of the thrilling new
universe expanding within the consciousness of the twentieth century.

Science works always first with physical properties and objectives. Our
breakfast newspapers tell of atoms cracked and a new element found, and
radio serves us up freshly discovered planets with the evening meal. In
all this inrush of knowledge nothing has been of such captivating
interest as the new discoveries about time which are giving rise to a
new point of view as significant for layman as for scientist. Einstein
has substituted new time-concepts and time-mechanics for old in the
study of the universe. For half a century new inventions in
communications have been telescoping time, bringing true Mother
Shipton's words:

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Around the world thoughts shall fly  
 In the twinkling of an eye."

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now, doctors are
timing and graphing the electrical thought impulses of the human brain.
And universities are experimenting in psychology departments with a kind
of time-sense to which may be linked the phenomena of the psyche.

We are so accustomed to thinking of time as the straight road separated
by present experience into its two parts, yesterday and tomorrow. But
the scientist is beginning to perceive what the mystic has always known,
that time is an unknown country stretching boundlessly in all
directions. Nostradamus, in whom awareness of this set him apart from
his fellows, was the Marco Polo of time's uncharted land, in which he
traveled the future as we travel a continent. From these transcendental
voyagings, like Polo, he returned with incredible stories of strange
sights. The prophet's rare okapis were a vision of events to come.

Both of these men, whose discoveries were beyond the comprehension of
their age, have come late into their own. Archaeology and exploration
have verified the narrative of Polo's travels. History, not only since
the sixteenth century, but daily, is verifying the time-travels of that
other and greater explorer, Nostradamus. He is of yesterday, today, and
still a long tomorrow. By virtue of what he was, and of our own hopes,
he deserves the distinguished position today which he had in the
Renaissance, and serious study in the light of

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

what science is teaching us of the power and forces of the mind.

It is an old and tenaciously held popular idea that interest in and
concentration on extra-dimensional qualities of the mind tend inevitably
to some form of imbalance which may run the gamut from credulity to
insanity. Too often in the past superstition has added to this its dark
aura of witchcraft and abnormal rites. Nostradamus was, throughout his
life, a striking refutation of such beliefs. His intellectual
achievements and emotional balance, his social adaptation and vigorous
health show him as the pattern of the well-rounded man. Considering his
unique gift, he may be said to have had, besides his genius for
prophecy, a veritable genius for normality. Had he never written the
Centuries, his title to fame would still be clear. The brilliant skill
and self-sacrificing devotion which made him the greatest physician in
France of his day would alone keep his memory green. Physician,
linguist, scholar, diplomat, writer, teacher, *religieux* and prophet,
his life touched all phases of Renaissance thought and activity from the
hovels of France, where he fought the plague, to the court of the
Valois, where he was honored beyond any seer in history.

The Book of Joel, which seems to have made a strong impression upon
Nostradamus, contains within its grim forecast the lovely, well-known
passage:

"and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall
dream dreams, your young men shall see visions." Nostradamus was the
greatest of

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

all who since Biblical ages have given to these words the substance of
fulfillment. And perhaps his life was prelusive to the "clear seeing"
which may be the glory of the coming age.

The major facts of the life of Nostradamus are known and fully attested.
Much confusion, however, exists concerning a number of biographical
details. Such questions as which one of the prophet's grandfathers it
was who educated him, what was the year of his second marriage, and
which of his sons was the eldest born are matters of conflicting
opinion. Some commentators have assumed that his son, César, was born in
1555 simply because Nostradamus dedicated his prophecies to him in that
year. It is impossible to find out the exact truth about these and other
discrepancies because of the loss or destruction of old documents which
would provide the proof. In such instances, the author has chosen from
old accounts the story which has seemed in her opinion to be best
supported by inference and available evidence.

The fictional treatment employed to present certain incidents is used in
an attempt to give more vitality to the faded colors of time, but each
has underlying facts or substantial inference. There is one exception to
this, the attributed purpose in the writing of the *Centuries*. Other
commentators besides the author believe, however, that this theory is
true. It agrees with what is known of the prophet's character and type
of mind, and is supported by indications from within the prophecies.
