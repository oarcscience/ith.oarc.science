### CHAPTER ONE

### The Cycle of Valois-Navarre

#### THE SEVEN CHILDREN OF THE KING

Presage 40

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A succession of fatalities will decimate the house of seven,  
Hail, tempests, pestilent misfortune and furies.  
A ruler of the Orient will put all the Occident in flight  
And subdue those who were once his conquerors.

</div>

IV-60

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Seven children shall he leave behind him in his house,  
The Third Estate will eventually murder one,  
Two (people) will be pierced by the sword of one of the children,  
Genoa and Florence will contribute to the disorder.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The seven branches will be reduced to three,  
Death will surprise more than one of the elder born, <span

The two males will be corrupted to the point of fratricide,  
Conspirators will die in their sleep.

</div>

ONE OF THE CHILDREN, Francis II, was now gone. The Biblical scourges
were unleashing their furies in the religious wars between the Catholics
and Protestants, which had begun in 1561, while Nostradamus still lived.
Solyman the Great was on the throne of Turkey, his pirates were sweeping
the length of the Mediterranean, harrying Venice, preying on the
commerce of all Europe. Hatred and rivalry were between Charles IX and
his brother, the Duke d’Anjou, Catherine's favorite child.

These three quatrains are like the opening bars of a tragic symphony,
giving the *leit-motif* which the music will interweave with other
patterns, amplifying and developing the theme. Covering the reign of
Charles IX were the four religious wars which spread death and ruin over
the country. The Protestants numbered more than a quarter of the
population of France, a large number to do away with or even crush, yet
such was the only idea that presented itself to the Catholics.

VIII-85

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Between Bayonne and Saint Jean de Luz  
The promontory of Mars will rise, <span id="page_295">p. 295</span>  
The effort of the Nymph of the North will remove the light,  
Then it will be snuffed out at the bedside without help.

</div>

In 1565 Catherine and Charles IX met the Duke of Alva at Bayonne to
consult about means of quenching the fire of the Protestant menace. The
time was set for the massacre which was later postponed until Saint
Bartholomew's because the Protestants got wind of it. The Nymph of the
North is Queen Elizabeth, whose encouragement and active support were
invaluable to the Protestants. The prophet sees the unity of faith lost
to France, snuffed out never to return, largely by virtue of this
support. Elizabeth also removed the light of the Duke d’Anjou's hope to
marry her, which died aborning.

In 1558, two years after the prophet's death, a new and final edition of
the *Prophecies* was published at Lyons by Rigaud. The arrangement of
the *Centuries* was in two parts. The first comprised all of the two
previous editions together with the letter to César. The second half
consisted of three new Centuries of a hundred verses each, preceded by a
letter of dedication to Henry, King of France Second. The edition was
brought out under the direction and supervision of Brother Jean Vallier
of the monastery of the Mineurs Conventuals, and with the permission of
his ecclesiastical superiors. It is evident that this must have been in
accordance with a pre-arranged plan made during the prophet's lifetime.
It also shows the support and

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

approval which the Church accorded to his prophetic powers.. In this
time of high excitement, war and death, the publication of fresh
prophecies was an event of prime importance in court circles. So many
forecasts had already been fulfilled that, as Nostradamus had predicted,
he was even more famous in death than he had been in life.

In this same year occurred another event of importance to the court, and
saddening to all France. This was the death of the Princess Elizabeth,
then Queen of Spain. Of her marriage to Philip, Nostradamus had this to
say:

S-49

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Venus, Sun, Jupiter and Mercury  
Shall augment events of the class coming under their influence,  
A grand alliance will take place in France,  
And the blood-sucker of the Midi himself,  
The flame of war being extinguished by this extreme remedy,  
Will plant the Olive branch in solid ground.

</div>

Jupiter and Sun, stars of pomp and royalty, had been in friendly aspect
during the splendid, fatal tourney which celebrated the match. Philip,
from the time he became King of Sicily, was called by the French the
"Blood-Sucker of the Midi." The prophet, remembering the sweet child he
had seen at Blois, called the

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

marriage an "extreme remedy," but he saw that the sacrifice was
justified for France. The long peace was as foretold. It was only broken
after the death of Henry III, when the rise of Navarre, allied with the
Nymph of the North, roused Spanish fears.

#### CRESCENT AND CROSS

While the turmoil of civil war was obsessing France, momentous
happenings in the Mediterranean were fulfilling more of the prophet's
visions, which were a continuation of what Villiers de L’Isle Adam, the
soldier of Rhodes, had told him so many years before.

II-5

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When sword and doctrine are shut up within the fish  
There shall go forth one who will wreak worse than war,  
His fleet will be well rowed across the sea,  
Appearing off the coast of Italy.

</div>

IX-61

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The pillage made along the seacoast  
Will be provoked and induced in the new city, (Geneva)  
Certain Christian Knights of Malta, through the act of Messina,  
Will be poorly rewarded when they are squeezed in the straits.

</div>

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

In 1565 the Turks boldly attacked Malta, killing eight thousand of the
Knights and possessing themselves of half the island. The island had,
you will remember, been given to the Knights of Rhodes, under
Nostradamus’ patient, the Knight Commander de L’Isle Adam, by Spain, as
a reward for their valor at Rhodes. Therefore, says Nostradamus, it is
poor guerdon for Philip II of Spain and King of Sicily (the deed of
Messina, Sicily) to leave them to be squeezed in the straits without
sending any help in their dire extremity. John Calvin made Geneva his
headquarters. The prophet refers to the "New City," as it was called, in
this connection, as contributing to the war.

II-4

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

</div>

In 1571 the Battle of Lepanto turned back and seriously crippled Turkish
sea power. In that year the island of Cyprus, "The neighboring
descendants of the Crusaders will be ambushed," was seized by Turkey
with a massacre so complete and dreadful that at last Christian Europe
was galvanized into action. Individual soldiers went from France to take
part in the expedition, as did soldiers from all over Europe and
England. But France as a nation remained aloof. Philip of Spain and the
Pope were the organizers of the naval expedition which did include ten
governments, counting the states of Italy. "The picked men" were the
flower of Europe's chivalry. Great princes in person led the boarding
parties that took the Moslem ships. Cervantes was among the heroes at
the battle. The colorful Don John of Austria was the military commander
of the allied fleet.

The losses on both sides were very heavy, but the Christians
administered a smashing defeat from which Turkey never recovered.
Lepanto is one of the most

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

important naval engagements in history. Its spirit was that of the
ancient Crusaders. Its "trireme galleys," little changed from the days
when Rome defeated Carthage, saw their last use in a major engagement at
Lepanto. These romantic ships of war were shortly discarded for boats of
different build adapted to hold the new artillery, and to a complete
change in the methods of sea war.

It was some years later, but in direct consequence of Lepanto, that the
Shah of Persia seized important Turkish provinces, and also one of the
great ports on the Persian Gulf, which enabled him to enrich himself by
expansion of his maritime commerce.

#### THE MASSACRE OF SAINT BARTHOLOMEW

Meanwhile the civil wars of religion went on interminably in France.
Leaders on both sides were killed. The ability and faith of Admiral
Coligny, after the Prince of Condé died, made him the greatest leader
and military commander whom the Protestants had.

VI-75

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The great City which has but half enough bread to eat (Paris)  
Will have the further blow of Saint Bartholomew  
Engraved upon the depths of its soul.  
Nîmes, Rochelle, Geneva, and Montpellier,  
Castres and Lyons, when Mars enters Aries  
These cities will have civil war, and all because of a government.

</div>

Admiral Coligny resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the
French navy seven years after he had received it, in order to head the
Protestant party. He came within an ace of carrying off "the prize" of
power by his ascendancy over Charles IX. For a time, he and his party,
as well as his enemies, thought that he had. His domination was so great
that Catherine dared delay no longer in putting into execution the plans
made seven years previously with the

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Duke of Alva, at
Bayonne. And the first death must be Coligny's. An assassin was sent,
Maurevert, to kill the Admiral. Guizot says he watched Coligny's house
for three days before the Admiral went out, and the killer got his
chance. Nostradamus’ vivid picture of the old man reading his Bible
under the eye of the murderer is a perfect bit. Coligny was only
wounded, so that the general mass murder was ordered at once. This
occurred on the twenty-fourth of August, 1572. Six days earlier,
Marguerite of Valois had married Henry of Navarre, and the court was
still celebrating the wedding. The feverish deliberations and last
minute conferences which preceded the ringing of the tocsin happened
precisely as Nostradamus describes. Coligny was murdered at night,
unarmed, by the Duke de Guise, his servant, Besme, and three or four of
the Swiss mercenaries. The towns mentioned were those in which
Protestants were strong, particularly New La Rochelle.

The prophet had no sympathy for Coligny, the spearhead of the faction he
believed undermining France. The anointed King acted within his rights
to kill the "Traitor." But he deplored that the savagery of that same
King should massacre his people, "the slaughtered innocents" of the
quatrain quoted earlier. Charles IX was said to have stood at the palace
window, arquebus in hand, and shot down Protestants until exhausted.

Events of importance followed two years later, in 1574.

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

VII-35

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Important Fish will weep and wail  
Because he has been elected. They will be deceived in the times,  
Their political guide will not be desirous of making his home with
them.  
He will be killed by the people of his own language.

</div>

The Fish was the Duke d’Anjou. The Pope, in the Centuries, is often
called the Fisherman. France, politically and religiously, was always
the best-loved fish of the papacy. Henry of Anjou was heir presumptive
to the throne. The quarrel between himself and Charles had become so
acute that neither was safe from the other. Henry was offered the crown
of Poland, which he accepted to get out of France. After sophisticated
Paris, he loathed living in Poland. The Poles quite misjudged the
character of the times in France when they invited Henry. He was only
there three months. Charles IX, racked with remorse and illness, died,
soothed at the last only by the old Protestant nurse whom the prophet
had seen with the little boy in the gardens of Blois. Henry left Poland
at once to become Henry III of France, until such time as one of his own
people would murder him.

#### DUEL A OUTRANCE

Henry III was weak, vicious, perverted; but like all the Valois he had
charm. The psychopathic jealousy

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

and hatred which he had felt for his brother, Charles IX, now that
Charles was dead, he projected upon the strong, brilliant Henry, Duke de
Guise, son of the warrior who took Calais. Courtly, eloquent, magnetic,
Guise was the idol of Paris. He was twice wounded in action, once in the
arm, and again in the leg and head. A bullet clipped his ear and scarred
his cheek which gave him his nickname, Le Balafré, in spite of which he
was considered very handsome. One of the cardinals at court remarked of
the Guises, father and son, that they made other people seem common by
comparison.

Guise as the descendant of Charlemagne, and having also the royal blood
of the Capet line, was one of the two royal brothers whom Nostradamus
describes in the following accurate picture of their deadly duel, which
was half personal hatred, half desire for power. Guise, like the
Bourbons, wanted the throne. As the leader of the Catholic faction, he
was in consequence close to the palace, and had in a fashion the inside
track. He was at this time far more powerful than the coming King, Henry
of Navarre. Guise had every confidence that he would win the crown. The
weak King, Catherine supporting her son with her craft, and the Duke de
Guise are the actors in this tragedy.

IV-3 8

</div>

The religious wars were more than a fight between Catholic and
Protestant. They were a three-cornered fight for power between Catherine
de’ Medici, backing successively her sons, and the great competing
houses of Guise-Lorraine and Bourbon-Navarre. None of the three would
yield to the others; it had to be, as it was, a duel to the death.

Note how the Oriental motif is sustained. Lepanto had defeated Turkey,
but not crushed her, and France had not fulfilled her obligation then.
No Turkish armies threaten, but the Turk still takes his captives as
pirates' prey, while Christian France quarrels internally. The Duke de
Guise organized the Catholic League to wrest the power from the King.
Spain supported this effort, the King was losing. Assassination was the
answer. The King had gone to Blois. The Duke, as Lieutenant-General of
France and High Steward of the Royal Household, was also there, both
being present for the meeting of the States-General.

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> So one has the
strange picture of these two deadly enemies and rivals under the same
roof and dining at the same table. The King summoned the Duke for a
private conference. As the Duke raised the tapestry to enter the room,
known as the old closet, he was stabbed five times by the King's men.
The King and the Duke had taken communion together shortly before the
murder.

When the Duke was dead the King exclaimed, "Now I am sole King. The King
of Paris is dead!" Catherine said, "You have done the cutting, now we
must sew it well." But there was little time for her sewing. Her own
death, in bed, occurred thirteen days after the murder of the Duke de
Guise. France was outraged at the murder. Orleans turned against the
King. The other towns mentioned by the prophet promptly went over to the
Protestants, for which Nostradamus blames them. Sixtus V, whom, as we
have seen, the prophet did not admire, was subservient to Spain, and in
many ways vacillating or afraid to adopt a strong policy. The Cardinal
de Guise, brother ("Two shall be killed by one of the children") of Le
Balafré, was murdered by Henry a few days after the Duke. The third
Guise brother, the Duke de Mayenne, then took over the leadership of the
Catholic League.

For the satisfaction of passing an edict that caters to
self-indulgence

Venus in her course will show such power  
As will shadow the unalloyed gold of the Sun.

</div>

The edict of Poictiers, passed by Henry III in 1577, among other things
permitted Protestant ministers to marry. Nostradamus saw this as a
threat to Catholicism. It was a temptation away from the ascetic
standards of the priesthood, into the freer customs of the Protestant
ministry. Venus, here a metaphor for self-indulgence, clouds the Sun of
the monarchy.

#### HENRY OF NAVARRE

</div>

The two royal brothers, Henry III and Henry of Navarre, sinking their
religious differences and agreeing on a common plan, climb into the same
ship of state which is also the barque of religion in a country having a
state religion. The condition of the treasury, and the reaction of Italy
to the combination of the two rulers were as the prophet indicates.

</div>

After the furor over the murder of the two Guises, Henry III, twice
King, once of Poland, once of France, desperately in need of backing,
with the Duke de Mayenne, the third and sole surviving Guise brother, in
virtual control of Paris, sought out Henry of Navarre and made an
alliance with him. But, "scant

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

space"--only a few months later the King was assassinated by Jacques
Clément, believed to be the agent of the Third Estate. "The Third Estate
shall murder one." Clément, the name meaning clement or gentle, is
exactly indicated by the prophet as the murderer. The alliance with
Navarre was at Easter, the murder--"not long after."

Paris, in the hands of the Duke de Mayenne, preparing its defenses and
arresting Protestants and royalists, there were "captives and powder."
Pope Sixtus, "the leader of Perouse," after the papacy having been
despoiled of England by Henry VIII, was terrified lest it happen now
with France. Henry II had been struck on his armored neck-piece by
Montgomery's lance. Henry III was stabbed in "the little gut," or neck
of the colon. "Father and son both struck in the neck." Henry of
Navarre, surviving member of the alliance, is advised to hang on, for
not to the nobles under the Duke de Mayenne shall fall Lutetia, Paris.
Henry will survive his opponents.

The Seven Children of the King are now dead, all but Marguerite, the
wife of Henry of Navarre, who had no children. Under the Salic law she
cannot rule, and in time Navarre will divorce her.

Cryptic as these verses read, they tell a perfectly straight story. Two
brothers in royalty, Navarre and Mayenne, lead the Protestant and
Catholic factions. The winner of the war, Navarre, will not live beyond
1610. He was assassinated then. A coup or an illness will mark his year
in 1606. He nearly died of illness in 1608, but Guizot speaks of it as
if it were of long standing, and it may have begun when the prophet
said.

Henry of Navarre did claim the crown to avenge Henry III, his
brother-in-law. He seized Brittany, previously tributary, but autonomous
under France. It had belonged to Queen Claude, grandmother of Henry III.
Nostradamus said in a verse, previously given, "the cadet branch," the
Bourbon, "will plant its foot on Armoric soil." Armorica was the old
name of Brittany. Thereafter Brittany remained as a province of the
crown.

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

"The buried" is Coligny who, through his Protestant successor, Henry of
Navarre, will enchain the power of Paris. The Barbel is a fish equipped
with prongs to spear its prey. The fish, in the *Centuries*, is always a
religious symbol. Here, the Barbel, the vicious fish of the false
religion, Protestantism, will poison with the eggs it lays, hopes of the
house of the Catholic faction under Guise-Lorraine, so that it is
defeated by Navarre. The latter is Lord Warden of the Marches because he
comes from the border kingdom of Navarre, a bulwark against Spanish
aggression.

But when Henry claimed the throne, the Duke de Mayenne put up a
counter-claimant who was none other than Navarre's uncle, the old
Cardinal de Bourbon, who had come over to his side. It was in this
Cardinal's house that the prophet had lodged while in Paris. But nothing
can stop Vendôme (one of the family names of Navarre) although he is
worried and doesn't know what Spain is going to do about all this. His
first concern was to see that his uncle, whom he had under guard, didn't
escape and get himself crowned. The Cardinal was at Chinon in the care
of Sieur Chavigny, who was also old, like the Cardinal, and nearly
blind. Henry sent a courier with a letter to the governor of Saumur
"bidding him at any price" to get the Cardinal away from Chinon and
under proper guard, which was done. But the poor old man, "the contender
in the duel," died, as the prophet said, not long after.

The battle of Arques, 1589, the first of Navarre's

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

two great victories, was as the prophet indicates it. Mayenne was
between Henry and the sea, blocking help. Henry had a complete line of
trenches dug surrounding the castle and town of Arques. Nor does
Nostradamus forget to mention the white plume of Navarre, so famous in
song and story. Victory, he tells us, will crown Navarre in the battle,
that is what he means by "follow the *Fleur de Lis*." It is the
beginning of the taking over by the house of Bourbon--to the prophet a
faithless line--the royal lily emblem of Capet.

Meanwhile the letters from Sixtus were very bittersweet. He admired
Navarre, but he didn't want a Protestant ruling France. Henry of Navarre
at once began to put into practice his ideas of toleration which later
were shaped into the Edict of Nantes. "The son of Anion," the religious
turncoat and heretic, Navarre, of course, was chosen at Rome, after his
purely political conversion to Catholicism. Thus were the two great
personages, Mayenne and the Cardinal, defeated.

The Cardinal is dead, but we are not yet finished with the Duke de
Mayenne. (And, reader, if the history of France seems unduly involved,
don't shoot the prophet and the author. Like the pianist, we are doing
our best.)

</div>

Navarre and his rule were under the ban of the Church, they were
anathema until his conversion. The prophet in this verse looks forward
to Henry's end when fanatical hatred destroys him, and with his passing
the new brood, the Protestants, gradually lose their political power,
shorn of royal protection. It was, however, hardly true that they were
responsible for their own destruction.

Henry had early renounced Protestantism at Chambray, but he hesitated to
take the final steps against the feeling of his own party. Only after he
was bulwarked by the support of Orleans, which came over to him, did he
feel strong enough to take this step, which he did in 1593. He then
accommodated himself to the requirements of the Pope, "the legate of the
earth and sea."

After his conversion, Henry took Paris the following year. On the 14th
of March the civic powers of Paris, having decided to admit him, forbade
meetings of the Mayenne faction. Seven days later, as stated by the
prophet in a quatrain given earlier, Navarre entered Paris. The
reference to the new palace, when Navarre entered the old walls of
Paris, is to the Tuileries,

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

which Catherine de’ Medici had begun but which was still not entirely
finished. De Givry and La Charry are names of two of Navarre's
enthusiastic supporters. The three towns mentioned in the same verse
were in the Sardinian states with which Henry had a certain amount of
fighting and difficulty.

The war continued for a time longer but eventually Mayenne yielded and
made the best terms for himself that he could, and became a friend and
loyal subject of the King. The Duke of Parma, who led the Spanish forces
assisting Mayenne, returned to Spain, and, Spanish influence removed,
the people of France, the majority of them, rejoiced in the entry of the
Protestant into the monarchy.

Philip's plot to seize Marseilles for Spain was in the early years of
Henry's rule while he was still fighting for power and had declared war
on Spain. When the design was foiled, the traitor killed and dragged in
the mud of the streets, Henry exclaimed: "Now I am really King!" Such
was the importance, says Guizot, of Marseilles as the queen of the
Mediterranean.

The fighting in Picardy was with the Spaniards, mainly, and like that of
Piedmont before he came into his full sovereignty.

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

As true of modern Geneva as in the times of Henry IV. The passing of the
Edict of Nantes, the great law of religious toleration, of which the
prophet disapproved, permitted the return to France of "the defeated and
the dreamers," who had received asylum in Geneva during the religious
wars.

Two pieces of treachery marked the reign of Henry IV. One was that of
the great soldier, Marshal Biron, whom the King said that he loved like
a brother. Biron sold out to Spain. He wanted, he said, to see his head
on a coin before he died. If he had lived today it might have gone on a
stamp; as it was, it went on the block. His agent was Lafin, who
confessed to the King. The other traitor, who also wanted Spanish gold,
was an obscure clerk in the diplomatic service. He was trapped through a
watch set on the post-office, and when pursued by night, near the Marne,
fell in the water and was drowned.

Henry IV's second marriage was to Marie de’ Medici, who came by galley
to Marseilles as Catherine had done so long ago. Her father, the prophet
lets us know, did very well for himself when he married his daughter

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

called her, but not particularly furtive about it. Marie was twice
regent after Henry's death. Richelieu exiled her to the country. She
escaped to Brussels and died in Belgium.

The noise of armes shall long be raised to heaven,

</div>

Henry IV was preparing for war when he was stabbed by Ravaillac, while
on his way to the Cathedral for his second coronation. Halted by the
congestion in the narrow Rue Ferroniere, he was standing, strangely
enough, beneath a sign, The Crown Pierced By An Arrow. In this street of
the iron-workers there was one little alley which was occupied by the
makers of pokers, *les tisoniers*. The King was standing opposite the
entrance to this, "*face Tyson*," when he was struck down. It is said
that before he left the palace to go to the Cathedral, a tree in the
courtyard, decorated in gala style according to old custom for such
occasions, fell over.

The accession of Henry of Navarre (he had already been ruling for more
than a decade) had established the Bourbon dynasty upon "the golden
throne." It had

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

brought to fulfillment the long struggle of the Bourbons for the
rulership of France which the Constable de Bourbon had begun sixty years
before. The prophet could never bring himself to admire the splendid
qualities of Henry, though he admits his greatness. To him Navarre was
always the faithless scion of a faithless house, whose leader in the
days of his youth, the Constable, had brought treachery, plague and
slaughter to Rome and to France. He knew, too, that France was not
through with the changeable loyalties of the house of Bourbon. Louis de
Condé, called The Great, namesake of *Bossu*, would go against his King,
Louis XIII. Philippe Egalité would vote for the beheading of his own
brother, Louis XVI. And Louis Philippe would abandon the flag of the
*Fleur de Lis* for the Tricolor. The prophet had spoken bitterly of
that; it hurt him. However, with the coming of Henry, the Bourbons were
henceforward France, and to those who ruled after Henry, Nostradamus
gave spiritual allegiance as he followed them in his prophetic visions.

The author regrets that space forbids the presentation of the great
periods intervening between Henry IV and the contemporary scene. It is
in our own time, as prophesied by Nostradamus, that the last of the
Bourbons is to rule France, the man who is to be her greatest King, who
is to arise and guide the nation back to glory. This King will close the
cycle of both the Bourbons and the monarchy of France.

It was, however, the reign of Henry of Navarre which closed the cycle of
the people Nostradamus knew,

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

born in his lifetime. The world had greatly changed since he came into
it. Still, there was always something of its familiar character left
while there remained some of those born in his lifetime and acquainted
with the old ways. Now that is over. The world which he describes from
this time on is a world different from his experience, and known only to
his prophet's vision.

It was sometime during the reign of Henry of Navarre that César
Nostradamus, nephew of the prophet, and governor of Provence under Henry
IV, presented to the King the fifty-eight Sixains and one hundred and
forty-one Presages which were among the prophet's effects. In view of
Nostradamus’ devastating attacks on Henry in so many of his verses,
which the King must have seen, it does not seem a too tactful present.
One wonders how the King really felt about it, in spite of the records
which say that he was interested and pleased. But Henry was a gay,
generous, tolerant nature. He probably shrugged it off and, like the
*vert galant* the Gascons still call him, sought out the prettiest woman
in the room and told her about it as a jest.
