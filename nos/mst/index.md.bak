Interest in Nostradamus goes through cycles, usually coinciding with
periods of uncertainty and conflict. At the beginning of World War II
people turned to Nostradamus for clues as to how and when that conflict
would be resolved, and to look for indications that somehow he had
prophesized it. Some used Nostradamus for propaganda, or profit, or
publicity. Of course, this was also the case after the attacks of
September 11th, 2001.

This book, published in the early days of World War II, is partially a
biography of Nostradamus, partially a historical novelization of
incidents in his life, and an attempt to associate his predictions with
historical and future events. McCann is at his best in the former parts
of the book. He immerses us in the life and times of Nostradamus.
Although many of the episodes are fictionalized, they make pleasant
reading and appear to be historically accurate. The attempts to match
Notradamus' predictions with historical events of the rennaissance are
for the most part very well reasoned, and range from plausible to
'hmmm...'.

The book concludes with a rather long section bearing on events of the
twentieth century. This part feels tacked on, as if the publisher was
eager to get a 'tie in' to current events. McCann hypothesized that the
war would continue until late in the forties, and would end because of
the restoration of the French monarchy, specifically that a pretender to
the throne would be crowned as Henry the Fifth. Naturally, this falls
far short of the mark, but it creates perspective for current and future
attempts to make specific predictions based on the cryptic quatrains.
