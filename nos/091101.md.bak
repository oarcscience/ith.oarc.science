# Did Nostradamus predict the WTC disaster?

### By J.B. Hare

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is an email exchange I had recently. I encourage you to
make up your own mind as to the significance of this. - J.B. Hare

*Note:* After I posted this essay (which got a tremendous number of hits
and continues to do so) I received a torrent of email which I was unable
to respond to individually.

Among these responses, several readers pointed out that the place name
translated 'tower of Aiguesmortes' (in the French version Tour
d'Aignes), is actually the name of a former seaport in the south of
France from which ships left for the Crusades. Incidentally, the
seashore has now retreated several kilometers at this point so it is no
longer a seaport.

So maybe the reference to a tower is just accidental. I stand by my
original gut feeling about this quatrain, nonetheless.

The point of my essay is: why make up bogus Nostradamus when the real
text is so much more interesting?

*Note:* In 20/20 hindsight the 'Little ones for great ones' may refer to
the passengers in the plane which crashed in Pennsylvania. Many readers
have pointed this out, there is no need to write me about it. --January

[Read an in-depth analysis of the quatrain XII 52 by one of our readers
who is familiar with 16th Century French language and culture](100301.md).
He concludes that the quatrain refers to an unrelated event (which may
or may not have happened) and does not have anythying to do with the
tragedy of 9/11.

A reader wrote me a couple of days after the World Trade Center attack:

Here's my reply:

The actual quatrain which this appears to be a riff on is:  
 

> *X 72*
>
> *L'an mil neuf cens nonante neuf sept mois*  
> *Du ciel viendra vn grand Roy d'effrayeur*  
> *Resusciter le grand Roy d'Angolmois,*  
> *Auant apres Mars regner par bon heur.*
>
> *The year 1999, seventh month,*  
> *From the sky will come a great King of Terror:*  
> *To bring back to life the great King of the Mongols,*  
> *Before and after Mars to reign by good luck.*

  
It looks like someone pieced together several different quatrains (what
you have has pieces of some other actual ones); Nostradamus is never
*that* specific!  
This is not a valid use of the Nostradamus material, to say the least.

True prophecies are never explicit; they are usually either ambiguous,
have cloaked meanings, or incorrect portions.

This is one of the few Nostradamus Quatrains to actually mention a month
and year, and the arrival of this date has long been held in dread by
believers in the quatrains; however, nothing of the sort happened in
July of 1999, as far as I know.  Sometimes the quatrains are duds,
that's prophecy biz.

However, no need to make stuff up!

This is an actual quatrain which I turned up two days ago just after the
disaster occurred, which had the correct resonance; you can tell when
you find one because they make the hair stand up on the back of your
neck (like Robert Graves said about true poetry). This is much more in
keeping with the general tenor of a Nostradamus prophecy which has come
true:  
 

> *XII 52 \**
>
> *Two bodies, one head, fields divided in two,*  
> *And then to reply to four unheard ones:*  
> *Little ones for great ones, clear evel for them,*  
> *Lightning at the tower of Aiguesmortes, worse for "Eussouis"*

Here's my interpretation in 20/20 hindsight.

The two bodies, one head, fields divided in two seems to be a vision of
the twin towers.

The four unheard ones could represent the four airliners.

Little ones for great ones: This has a couple of interpretations; This
could refer to the passengers who took it on themselves to take back the
airliner which crashed in Pennsylvania; or it could refer to the
hijackers themselves, the line is suggestive but it doesn't add a lot to
the interpretation of the quatrain. In either case the end was fatal
(*clear evel*).

Aiguesmortes looks like a combination of two French words "sharp", and 
"deaths"; this certainly appears to be very apropos.  This was the key
phrase which made me think this was a hit. And even more suggestively,
Eussouis (which might be pronounced 'yew-swas', with a silent s on the
end) might be a garbled version of 'USA', of course the USA didn't exist
when he wrote; it's not an actual French word as far as anyone knows;
sometimes Nostradamus will introduce nonsense words that in retrospect
make sense, e.g. 'Hisler'.
