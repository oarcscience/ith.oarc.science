### 11

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> have seen that some of the most
brilliant inspirations of god-like intellects, or some of the most
pestilential emanations from infected minds, have been attempts to
account for the virtual changelessness of the stars. Above all other
data of astronomy, that virtual changelessness of positions stands out
as a crucial circumstance in my own mind. To account for constellations
that have not changed in 2,000 years, astronomers say that they conceive
of inconceivable distances. We shall have expressions of our own upon
the virtually changeless positions of the stars; but there will be
difficulties for us if the astronomers ever have found that some stars
move around or with other stars. I shall take up the story of Prof.
Struve and the "Companion of Procyon," with more detail, for the sake of
some more light upon refinement, exactness, accuracy in astronomy, and
for the sake of belittling, or for the sake of sneering, or anything
else that anybody may choose to call it.

Prof. Struve's announcement of his discovery of the "Companion of
Procyon" is published in *Monthly Notices*, 33-430—that, upon the 19th
of March, 1873, Struve had discovered the companion of Procyon, having
compared it micrometrically, having tested his observations with three
determinations of position-angle, three measures of distance, and three
additional determinations of position-angle, finding all in "excellent
agreement." No optical illusion could be possible, it is said, because
another astronomer, Lindemann, had seen the object. Technically, Struve
publishes a table of his observations: sidereal time, distances,
position-angles; from March 19 to April 2, 1873, after which his
observations had to be

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

discontinued until the following year. In *Monthly Notices*, 34-355, are
published the resumed observations. Struve says that Auwers would not
accept the discovery, unless, in the year that had elapsed, the
"companion" had shown increase in position, consistent with theory.
Struve writes—"This increase has really shown itself in the most
remarkable manner." Therefore, he considers it "decisively established"
that the object of his observations was the object of Auwers’
calculations. He says that Ceraski, of Moscow, had seen the "companion,"
"without being warned of the place where it was to be looked for."

However—see back some chapters.

It may be said that, nevertheless, other stars have companions that do
move as they should move. Later we shall consider this subject, thinking
that it may be that lights have been seen to change position near some
stars, but that never has a star revolved around another star, as to fit
palæo-astronomic theory it should. I take for a basis of analogy that
never has one sat in a park and watched a tree revolve around one, but
that given the affliction, or the endowment, of an astronomer, illusion
of such a revolution one may have. We sit in a park. We notice a tree.
Wherever we get the notion, we do have the notion that the tree has
moved. Then, farther along, we notice another tree, and, as an
indication of our vivid imagination or something else, we think it is
the same tree, farther along. After that we pick out tree after tree,
farther along, and, convinced that it is the same tree, of course
conclude that the thing is revolving around us. Exactness and refinement
develop: we compute the elements of its orbit. We close our eyes and
predict where the tree will be when next we look; and there, by the same
process of selection and identification, it is where it "should" be. And
if we have something of almost everybody's mania for speed, we make that
damn thing spin around with such velocity that we, too, reel in a chaos
of very much unsettled botanic conventions. There is nothing far-fetched
in this analogy, except the factor of velocity. Goldschmidt did announce
that there were half a dozen faint points of light around Sirius, and it
was Dawes’ suspicion that Clark had arbitrarily picked out one of them.
It is our expression that all around Sirius, at various distances

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

from Sirius, faint points of light were seen, and that at first, even
for the first sixteen years, astronomers were not thoroughly hypnotized,
and would not pick out the especial point of light that they should have
picked out, so that there was nothing like agreement between the
calculated and the observed orbit. Besides the irreconcilable
observations noted by Flammarion, see the *Intel. Obs.*, 1-482, for
others. Then came standardized seeing. So, in the *Observatory*, 20-73,
is published a set of observations, in the year 1896, upon the
"Companion of Sirius," placing it exactly where it should be.
Nevertheless, under this set of observations is published another set,
so different that the Editor asks—"Does this mean that there are two
companions?"

Dark Companions require a little more eliminative treatment. So the
variable nebulæ, then—and do dark nebulæ revolve around light nebulæ?
For instances of variable nebulæ, see *Mems. R. A. S.*, 49-214; *Comptes
Rendus*, 59-637; *Monthly Notices*, 38-104. It may be said that they are
not of the Algol-type. Neither is Algol, we have shown.

According to the compulsions of data, our idea is that the stars that
seem to be fixed in position are fixed in position, so now "proper
motion" is as irreconcilable to us as relative motions.

As to "proper motion," the situation is this:

The stars that were catalogued 2,000 years ago have virtually not
changed, or, if there be refinement in modern astronomy, have changed no
more than a little more nearly exact charting would account for; but, in
astronomic theory, the stars are said to be thought of as flying apart
at unthinkable velocity; so then evidence of changed positions of stars
is welcome to astronomers. As to well-known constellations, it cannot be
said that there has been change; so, with several exceptions, "proper
motion" is attributed to stars that are not well-known.

The result is an amusing trap. Great proper motion is said to indicate
relative nearness to this earth. Of the twenty-five stars of supposed
greatest proper motion, all but two are faintest of stars; so these
twenty-three are said to be nearest this earth. But when astronomers
take the relative parallax of a star, by reference to a fainter star,
they agree that the fainter star, because fainter, is

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

farther away. So one time faintness associates with nearness, and then
conveniences change, and faintness associates with farness, and the
whole subject so associates with humorousness, that if we're going to be
serious at all in these expressions of ours we had better pass on.

*Observatory*, March, 1914:

A group of three stars that disappeared.

If three stars disappeared at once, they were acted upon by something
that affected all in common. Try to think of some one force that would
not tear the seeable into visible rags, that could blot out three stars,
if they were trillions of miles apart. If they were close together that
ends the explanation that only because stars are trillions of miles
apart have they, for at least 2,000 years, seemed to hold the same
relative positions.

In Agnes Clerke's *System of the Stars*, are cited many instances of
stars that seem to be so closely related that it seems impossible to
think that they are trillions, or billions, or millions of miles apart:
such formations as "seven aligned stars appearing to be strung on a
silvery filament." There are loops of stars in a cluster in Auriga;
lines and arches in Opiuchus; zig-zag figures in Sagittarius. As to
stars that not only seem close together but that are colored alike, Miss
Clerke expresses her feeling that they are close together—"If these
colors be inherent, it is difficult to believe that the stars
distinguished by them are simply thrown together by perspective." As to
figures in Sagittarius, Fison (*Recent Advances in Astronomy*) cites an
instance of 30 small stars in the form of a forked twig, with dark rifts
parallel. According to Fison, probability is overwhelmingly against the
three uncommon stars in the belt of Orion falling into a straight line,
by chance distribution, considering also that below this line is another
of five faint stars parallel. There are dark lanes or rifts in the Milky
Way that are like branches from main lanes or rifts, and the rifts
sometimes have well-defined edges. In many regions where there are dark
rifts there are lines of stars that are roughly parallel

That it is not distances apart that have held the stars from changing
relatively to one another, because there are hosts of indications

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

that some stars are close together, and are, or have been, affected, in
common, by local formative forces.

<div align="center">

</div>

For a detailed comparison, by J. E. Gore, of stars of today with stars
catalogued by Al-Sufi about 1,000 years ago, see the *Observatory*, vol.
23. The stars have not changed in position, but it does seem that there
have been many changes in magnitude.

Other changes—*Pubs. Astro. Soc. Pacific*, No. 185 (1920)—discovery of
the seventeenth new star in one nebula (Andromeda). For lists of stars
that have disappeared, see *Monthly Notices*, 8-16; 10-18; 11-47;
*Sidereal Messenger*, 6-320; *Jour. B. A. A.*, 14-255. Nebulæ that have
disappeared—see *Amer. Jour. Sci.*, 2-33-436; Clerke's *System of the
Stars*, p. 293; *Nature*, 30-20.

In the *Sidereal Messenger*, 5-269, Prof. Colbert writes that, upon
August 20, 1886, an astronomer, in Chicago, saw, for about half an hour,
a small comet-like projection from the star *Zeta*, in Cassiopeia.

So, then, changes have been seen at the distance of the stars.

When the new star in Perseus appeared, in February, 1901, it was a point
of light. Something went out from it, giving it in six months a diameter
equal to half the apparent diameter of the moon. The appearances looked
structural. To say loosely that they were light-effects, something like
a halo, perhaps, is to ignore their complexity and duration and
differences. According to Newcomb, who is occasionally quotable in our
favor, these radiations were not mere light-rays, because they did not.
go out uniformly from the star, but moved out variously and knotted and
curved.

It was visible motion, at the distance of Nova Persei.

In *Monthly Notices*, 58-334, Dr. Espin writes that, upon the night of
Jan. 16, 1898, he saw something that looked like a cloud in Perseus. It
could have been nothing in the atmosphere of this earth, nor anything
far from the constellation, because he saw it again in Perseus, upon
January 24. He writes that, upon February 17, Mr. Heath and Dr. Halm saw
it, like a cloud, dimming and discoloring stars shining through it. At
the meeting of the British Astronomical Association, Feb. 23, 1898
(*Jour. B. A. A.*, 8-216), Dr.

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Espin described
this appearance and answered questions. "It was not a nebula, and was
not like one." "Whatever it was it had the peculiar property of dimming
and blotting out stars."

This thing moved into Perseus and then moved away.

Clerke, The *System of the Stars*, p. 295—a nebula that changed position
abruptly, between the years 1833 and 1835, and then changed no more.
According to Sir John Herschel, a star was central in this nebula, when
observed in 1827, and in 1833, but, in August, 1835, the star was upon
the eastern side of the nebula.

That it is not distance from this earth that has kept changes of
position of the stars from being seen, for 2,000 years, because
occasional, abrupt changes of position have been seen at the distance of
the stars.

That, whether there be a shell-like, revolving composition, holding the
stars in position, and in which the stars are openings, admitting light
from an existence external to the shell, or not, all stars are at about
the same distance from this earth as they would be if this earth were
stationary and central to such a shell, revolving around it—

According to the aberration-forms of the stars.

All stars, at the pole of the ecliptic, describe circles annually; stars
lower down describe ellipses that reduce more and more the farther down
they are, until at the ecliptic they describe straight lines yearly.

Suppose all the stars to be openings, fixed in position relatively to
one another, in some inter-spacing substance. Conceive of a gyration to
the whole aggregation, and relatively to a central and stationary earth:
then, as seen from this earth, all would describe circles, near the
axis, ellipses lower down, and straight lines at the limit of
transformation. If all were at the same distance from this earth, or if
all were points in one gyrating concave formation, equi-distant at all
points from the central earth, all would have the same amplitude. All
aberration-forms of the stars, whether of brilliant or faint stars,
whether circles or ellipses or straight lines, have the same amplitude:
about 41 seconds of arc.

<div align="center">

</div>

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

If all stars are points of light admitted from externality, held fixed
and apart in one shell-like composition that is opaque in some parts and
translucent in some parts and perforated generally—

The Gegenschein—

That we have indication that there is such a shell around our existence.

The Gegenschein is a round patch of light in the sky. It seems to be
reflected sunlight, at night, because it keeps position about opposite
the sun's.

The crux:

Reflected sunlight—but reflecting from what?

That the sky is a matrix in which the stars are openings, and that, upon
the inner, concave surface of this celestial shell, the sun casts its
light, even if the earth is between, no more blotted out in the middle
by the intervening earth than often to considerable degree is its light
blotted out upon the moon during an eclipse of the moon, occupying no
time in traveling the distance of the stars and back to this earth,
because the stars are near, or because there is no velocity of light.

Suppose the Gegenschein could be a reflection of sunlight from anything
at a distance less than the distance of the stars. It would have
parallax against its background of stars.

*Observatory*, 17-47:

"The Gegenschein has no parallax."

At the meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, Jan. 11, 1878, was
read a paper by W. F. Denning. It was, by its implications, one of the
most exciting documents in history. The subject was: "Suspected
repetitions in meteor-showers." Mr. Denning listed twenty-two radiants
that lasted from three to four months each.

In the year 1799, Humboldt noticed that the paths of meteors, when parts
of one display, led back to one point of common origin, or one point
from which all the meteors had radiated. This is the radiant-point, or
the radiant. When a radiant occurs under a constellation, the meteors
are named relatively. In the extraordinary meteoric display of Nov.
13-14, 1833, there was a circumstance that was as extraordinary as the
display itself: that, though

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

this earth is supposed to rotate upon its axis, giving to the stars the
appearance of revolving nightly, and supposed to revolve around the sun,
so affecting the seeming motions of the stars, these meteors of
November, 1833, began under the constellation Leo, and six hours later,
though Leo had changed position in the sky, had changed with, and seemed
still coming from, Leo.

There was no parallax along the great base line from Canada to Florida.

Then these meteors did come from Leo, or parallax, or absence of
parallax, is meaningless.

The circumstance of precise position maintained under a moving
constellation upon the night of Nov. 13-14, 1833, becomes insignificant
relatively to Denning's data of such synchronization with a duration of
months. When a radiant-point remains under Leo or Lyra, night after
night, month after month, it is either that something is shifting it,
without parallax, in exact coincidence with a doubly shifting
constellation, which is so unthinkable that Denning says, "I cannot
explain," or that the constellation is the radiant-point, in which case
maintenance of precise position under it is unthinkable if it be far
away—

That the stars are near.

Think of a ship, slowly sailing past a seacoast town, firing with
smokeless powder, say. Shells from it burst before quite reaching the
town, and all explosion-points are in line between the city and She
ship, or are traceable to one such radiant. The bombardment continues.
The ship moves slowly. Still all points of exploding shells are
traceable to one point between the ship and the town. The bombardment
goes on and goes on and goes on, and the ship is far from its first
position. The point of exploding shells is still between the ship and
the town. Wise men in the town say that the shells are not coming from
the ship. They say this because formerly they had said that shells could
not come from a ship. They reason: therefore shells are not coming from
this ship. They are asked how, then, the point of explosion could so
shift exactly in line with the moving ship. If there be a W. F. Denning
among them, he will say, "I cannot explain." But the other wise men will
be like Prof. Moulton, for instance. In his books, Prof. Moulton

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

writes a great deal upon the subject of meteors, but he does not mention
the meteors that, for months at a time, appear between observers and a
shifting constellation.

There are other considerations. The shells are heard to explode. So then
they explode near the town. But there is something the matter with that
smokeless powder aboard ship: very feeble projectile-force, because also
must the shells be exploding near the ship, or the radiant-point would
not have the same background, as seen from different parts of the town.
Then, in this town, inhabitants, provided they be not wise men, will
conclude that, if the explosion-point is near the town, and is also near
the ship, the ship is near the town—

Leo and Lyra and Andromeda—argosies that sail the sky and that bombard
this earth—and that they are not far away.

And some of us there may be who, instead of trying to speculate upon an
unthinkable remoteness, will suffer a sensitiveness to proximity
instead; enter a new revolt against a black encompassment that glitters
with a light beyond, and wonder what exists in a brilliant environment
not far away—and a new anguish for hyperæsthesia upon this earth: a
suffocating consciousness of the pressure of the stars.

The Sickle of Leo, from which come the Leonids, gleams like a great
question-mark in the sky.

The answer—

But God knows what the answer to anything is.

Perhaps it is that the stars are very close indeed.
