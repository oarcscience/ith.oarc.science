<span class="smallcaps">That</span> the Geo-system is an incubating
organism, of which this earth is the nucleus—but an organism that is so
strongly characterized by conditions and features of its own that
likening it to any object internal to it is the interpreting of a thing
in terms of a constituent—so that we think of an organism that is
incompletely, or absurdly inadequately, expressible in terms of the
egg-like and the larval and other forms of the immature—a geo-nucleated
system that is dependent upon its externality as, in one way or another,
is every similar, but lesser and included, thing—stimulated by flows of
force that are now said to be meteoric, though many so-called "meteoric"
streams seem more likely to be electric, that radiate from the umbilical
channels of its constellations—vitalized by its sun, which is itself
replenished by the comets, which, coming from external reservoirs of
force, impart to the sun their freightages, and, unaffected by
gravitation, return to an external existence, some of them even touching
the sun, but showing no indication of supposed solar attraction.

In a technical sense we give up the doctrine of Evolution. Ours is an
expression upon Super-embryonic Development, in one enclosed system.
Ours is an expression upon Design underlying and manifesting in all
things within this one system, with a Final Designer left out, because
we know of no designing force that is not itself the product of remoter
design. In terms of our own experience

<span id="page_529">p. 529</span>

we cannot think of an ultimate designer, any more than we can think of
ultimacy in any other respect. But we are discussing a system that, in
our conception, is not a final entity; so then no metaphysical
expression upon it is required.

I point out that this expression of ours is not meant for aid and
comfort to the reactionaries of the type of Col. W. J. Bryan, for
instance: it is not altogether anti-Darwinian: the concept of
Development replaces the concept of Evolution, but we accept the process
of Selection, not to anything loosely known as Environment, but
relatively to underlying Schedule and Design, predetermined and
supervised, as it were, but by nothing that we conceive of in
anthropomorphic terms.

I define what I mean by dynamic design, in the development of any
embryonic thing: a pre-determined, or not accidental, or not
irresponsible, passage along a schedule of phases to a climax of
unification of many parts. Some of the aspects of this process are the
simultaneous varying of parts, with destiny, and not with independence,
for their rule, or with future co-ordinations and functions for their
goal; and their survival while still incipient, not because they are
fittest relatively to contemporaneous environment, so not because of
usefulness or advantage in the present, inasmuch as at first they are
not only functionless but also discordant with established relations,
but surviving because they are in harmony with the dynamic plan of a
whole being: and the presence of forces of suppression, or repression,
as well as forces of stimulation and protection, so that parts are held
back, or are not permitted to develop before their time.

If we accept that these circumstances of embryonic development are the
circumstances of all wider development, within one enclosed system, the
doctrine of Darwinian Evolution, as applied generally, will, in our
minds, have to be replaced by an expression upon Super-embryonic
Development, and Darwinism, unmodified, will become to us one more of
the insufficiencies of the past. Darwinism concerns itself with the
adaptations of the present, and does heed the part that the past has
played, but, in Darwinism, there is no place for the influence of the
future upon the present.

<span id="page_530">p. 530</span>

Consider any part of an embryonic thing—the heart of an embryo—and at
first it is only a loop. It will survive, and it will be nourished in
its functionless incipiency; also it will not be permitted to become a
fully developed heart before its scheduled time arrives; its
circumstances are dominated by what it will be in the future. The eye of
an embryo is a better instance.

Consider anything of a sociologic nature that ever has grown: that there
never has been an art, science, religion, invention that was not at
first out of accord with established environment, visionary,
preposterous in the light of later standards, useless in its incipiency,
and resisted by established forces so that, seemingly animating it and
protectively underlying it, there may have been something that in spite
of its unfitness made it survive for future usefulness. Also there are
data for the acceptance that all things, in wider being, are held back
as well as protected and prepared for, and not permitted to develop
before comes scheduled time. Langley's flying machine makes me think of
something of the kind—that this machine was premature; that it appeared
a little before the era of aviation upon this earth, and that therefore
Langley could not fly. But this machine was capable of flying, because,
some years later, Curtis did fly in it. Then one thinks that the Wright
Brothers were successful, because they did synchronize with a scheduled
time. I have heard that it is questionable that Curtis made no
alterations in Langley's machine. There is no lack of instances. One of
the greatest of secrets that have eventually been found out was for ages
blabbed by all the pots and kettles in the world—but that the secret of
the steam engine could not, to the lowliest of intellects, or to
supposititiously highest of intellects, more than adumbratively reveal
itself until came the time for its co-ordination with the other
phenomena and the requirements of the Industrial Age. And coal that was
stored in abundance near the surface of the ground—and the needs of
dwellers over coal mines, veins of which were often exposed upon the
surface of the ground, for fuel—but that this secret, too, obvious, too,
could not be revealed until the coming of the Industrial Age. Then the
building of factories, the inventing of machines, the digging of coal,
and the use of steam, all appearing by simultaneous variation, and
co-ordinating,

<span id="page_531">p. 531</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shores of North
America—nowadays, with less hero-worship than formerly, historians tell
us that, to English and French fishermen, the coast of Newfoundland was
well-known, long before the year 1492; nevertheless, to the world in
general, it was not, or, according to our acceptances, could not be,
known. About the year 1500, a Portuguese fleet was driven by storms to
the coast of Brazil, and returned to Europe. Then one thinks that likely
enough, before the year 1492, other vessels had been so swept to the
coasts of the western hemisphere, and had returned—but that data of
westward lands could not emerge from the suppressions of that era—but
that the data did survive, or were preserved for future usefulness—that
there are "Thou shalt nots" engraved upon something underlying all
things, and then effacing, when phases pass away.

We conceive now of all buildings—within one enclosed system—in terms of
embryonic building, and of all histories as local aspects of
Super-embryonic Development. Cells of an embryo build falsely and
futilely, in the sense that what they construct will be only temporary
and will be out of adjustment later. If, however, there are conditions
by which successive stages must be traversed before the arrival of
maturity, ours is an expression upon the functioning of the false and
the futile, in which case these terms, as derogations, should not be
applied. We see that the cells that build have no basis of their own;
that for their formations there is nothing of reason and necessity of
their own, because they flourish in other formations quite as well. We
see that they need nothing of basis, nor of guidance of their own,
because basis and guidance are of the essence of the whole. All are
responses, or correlates, to a succession of commandments, as it were,
or of dominant, directing, supervising spirits of different eras: that
they take on appearances that are concordant with the general gastrula
era, changing when comes the stimulus to agree with the reptilian era,
and again responding harmoniously when comes the time of the mammalian
era. It is in accordance with our experience that never has human mind,
scientific, religious, philosophic, formulated one basic thought, one
finally true law, principle, or major premise from which guidance could
be deduced. If any thought were true and final it would include the
deduced. We conceive that there has been guidance,

<span id="page_532">p. 532</span>

just the same, if human beings be conceived of as cellular units in one
developing organism; and that human minds no more need foundations of
their own than need the sub-embryonic cells that build so
preposterously, according to standards of later growth, but build as
they are guided to build. In this view, human reason is tropism, or
response to stimuli, and reasoning is the trial-and-error process of the
most primitive unicellular organisms, a susceptibility to underlying
mandates, then a groping in perhaps all possible distortions until
adjustment with underlying requirements is reached. In this view, then,
though there are, for instance, no atoms in the Daltonian sense, if in
the service of a building science, the false doctrine of the atoms be
needed, the mind that responds, perhaps not to stimulus, but to
requirement, which seems to be a negative stimulus, and so conceives, is
in adjustment and reaches the state known as success. I accept, myself,
that there may be Final Truth, and that it may be attainable, but never
in a service that is local or special in any one science or nation or
world.

It is our expression that temporary isolations characterize embryonic
growth and super-embryonic growth quite as distinctly as do expansions
and co-ordinations. Local centers of development in an egg—and they are
isolated before they sketch out attempting relations. Or in wider
being—hemisphere isolated from hemisphere, and nation from nation—then
the breaking down of barriers—the appearance of Japan out of
obscurity—threads of a military plasm are cast across an ocean by the
United States.

Shafts of light that have pierced the obscurity surrounding planets—and
something like a star shines in Aristarchus of the moon. Embryonic
heavens that have dreamed—and that their mirages will be realized some
day. Sounds and an interval; sounds and the same interval; sounds
again—that there is one integrating organism and that we have heard its
pulse.
