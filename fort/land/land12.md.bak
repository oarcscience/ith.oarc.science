<span class="smallcaps">We</span> try to have independent expressions.
Accept that it is not distance that has held the stars in unchanging
position, if occasional, abrupt change of position has been seen at the
distance of the stars, and it is implied that the not enormously distant
stars are all about equally far away from this earth;

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

or some would be greatly particularized, and that this earth does not
move in an orbit, or stars would be seasonally particularized, but would
not be, if the stars, in one composition revolve; also if this earth be
relatively close to all stars, if many changes of magnitude and of
appearance and disappearance have been seen at the distance of the
stars, and, if, in the revolutions of the stars, they do not swirl in
displacements as bewildering as a blizzard of luminous snowflakes, and
if no state of inter-repulsion can be thought of, especially as many
stars merge into others, this composition is a substantial, concave
formation, or shell-like enclosure in which stars are points. So many of
the expressions .in the preceding chapter imply others, or all others.
However, we have tried to have independent expressions. Of course we
realize that the supposed difference between inductive and deductive
reasoning is a false demarcation; nevertheless we feel that deductions
piled upon other deductions are only architecture, and a great deal in
this book expresses the notion that architecture should be kept in its
own place. Our general expression is not that there should be no
architecture and no mathematics in astronomy, or neo-astronomy; not that
there should be no poetry in biology; no chemistry in physiology—but
that "pure" architecture or "pure" mathematics, biology, chemistry, has
its own field, even though each is inextricably bound up with all the
other aspects of being. So of course the very thing that we object to in
its extreme manifestations is essential to us in some degree, and the
deductive is findable somewhere in every one of our inductions, and we
are not insensible to what we think is the gracefulness of some of the
converging lines of our own constructions. We are not revolting against
aspects, but against emphases and intrusions.

This first part of our work is what we consider neo-astronomic; and now
to show that we have no rabidity against the mathematical except when
over-emphasized, or misapplied, our language is that all expressions so
far developed are to us of about 50% acceptability. A far greater
attempted independence is coming, a second part of this work,
considering phenomena so different that, if we term the first part of
our explorations "neo-astronomic," even. some other term by which to
designate the field of the second part

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

will have to be thought of, and the word "extra-geographic" seems best
for it. If in these two fields, our at least temporary conclusions be
the same, we shall be impressed, in spite of all our cynicisms as to
"agreements."

Neo-astronomy:

This supposed solar-system—an egg-like organism that is shelled away
from external light and life—this central and stationary earth its
nucleus—around it a revolving shell, in which the stars are pores, or
functioning channels, through some of which spray irradiating fountains
said to be "meteoric," but perhaps electric—in which the nebulæ are
translucent patches, and in which the many dark parts are areas of
opaque, structural substance—and that the stars are not trillions nor
even millions of miles away—with proportional reductions of all internal
distances, so that the planets are not millions, nor even hundreds of
thousands of miles away.

We conceive of the variability of the stars and the nebulæ in terms of
the incidence of external light upon a revolving shell and fluctuating
passage through light-admitting points and parts. We conceive of all
things being rhythmic, so, if stars be pores in a substance, that matrix
must be subject to some changes, which may be of different periodicities
in different regions. There may be local vortices in the most rigid
substance, and so stars, or pores, might revolve around one another, but
our tendency is to think that if light companions there be to some
stars, they are reflections of light, passing through channels, upon
surrounding substance, flickering from one position to another in the
small undulations of this environment. So there may be other
displacements, differences of magnitude, new openings and closings in a
substance that is not absolutely rigid. So "proper motion" might be
accounted for, but my own preference is to think, as to such stars as
1830 *Groombridge* and Barnard's "run-away star," that they are
planets—also that some of the comets, especially the tailless comets,
some of which have been seen to obscure stars, so that evidently they
are not wisps of highly attenuated matter, are planets, all of them not
conventionally recognized as planets, because of eccentricity and
remoteness from the ecliptic, two departures, however, that many of the
minor planets make to great degree. If some of these bodies be planets,
the

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

irregularities of some of them are consistent with the irregularities of
Jupiter's satellites.

I suggest that a combination of the Ptolemaic and the Tychonic doctrines
is in good accord with all the phenomena that we have considered, and
with all planetary motions that we have had no occasion to pay much
attention to—that the sun, carrying Mercury and Venus with him, revolves
at a distance of a few thousand miles, or a few tens of thousands of
miles, in a rising and falling spiral around this virtually, but not
absolutely, stationary earth, which, according to modern investigations,
is more top-shaped than spherical; moon, a few thousand miles away,
revolving around this nucleus; and the exterior planets not only
revolving around this whole central arrangement, but approaching and
receding, in loops, also, quite as they seem, to the remotest of them
preposterously near, according to conventional "determinations."

So all the phenomena of the skies may be explained. But all were
explained in another way by Copernicus, in another way by Ptolemy, and
in still another way by Tycho Brahé. One supposes that there are other
ways. If there be a distant object, and, if one school of wise men can
by their reasoning processes excellently demonstrate that it is a tree,
another school positively determine that it is a house, and other
investigators of the highest authoritativeness variously find and prove
that it is a cloud or a buffalo or a geranium, why then, their reasoning
processes may be admired but not trusted. Right at the heart of our
opposition, and right at the heart of our own expressions, is the
fatality that there is no reasoning, no logic, no explanation resembling
the illusions in the vainglories of common suppositions. There is only
the process of correlating to, or organizing or systematizing around,
something that is arbitrarily taken for a base, or a dominant doctrine,
or a major premise—the process of assimilating with something else,
making agreement with something else, or interpreting in terms of
something else, which supposed base is never itself final, but was
originally an assimilation with still something else.

I typify the result of all examinations of all principles or laws or
dominant thoughts, scientific, philosophic, or theologic, in what

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

we find in examining the pronouncement that motion follows the least
resistance:

That motion follows least resistance.

How are we to identify least resistance?

If motion follows it.

Then motion goes where motion goes.

If nothing can be positively distinguished from anything else there can
be no positive logic, which is attempted positive distinguishment.
Consider the popular "base" that Capital is tyranny, and almost utmost
wickedness, and that Labor is pure and idealistic. But one's labor is
one's capital, and capital that is not working is in no sense implicated
in this conflict.

Nevertheless we now give up our early suspicion that our whole existence
is a leper of the skies, quaking and cringing through space, having the
isolation that astronomers suppose, because other celestial forms of
being fly from infection—

That, if shelled away from external light and life, it is so surrounded
and so protected in the same cause and functioning as that of similarly
encompassed forms subsidiary to it—that our existence is
super-embryonic.

Darkness of night and of lives and of thoughts—super-uterine entombment.
Blackness of the unborn, quasi-illumined periodically by the little sun,
which is not light, but less dark.

Then we think of an organism that needs no base, and needs nothing of
finality, nor of special guidance to any part local to it, because all
parts partake of the pre-determined development of the whole.
Consequently our spleens subside, and our frequently unmannerly
derisions are hushed by recognitions—that all organizations of thought
must be baseless in themselves, and of course be not final, or they
could not change, and must bear within themselves those elements that
will, in time, destroy them—that seeming solidities that pass away, in
phantom-successions, are functionaries relatively to their periods, and
express the passage from phase to phase of all things embryonic.

So it is that one who searches for fundamentals comes to bifurcations;
never to a base; only to a quandary. In our own field, let there be any
acceptable finding. It indicates that the earth moves

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

around the sun. Just as truly it indicates that the sun moves around the
earth. What is it that determines which will be accepted, hypnotically
blinding the faithful to the other aspect? Our own expression is upon
Development as serial reactions to successive Dominants. Let the
dominant spirit of an era require that this earth be remote and
isolated; Keplerism will support it: let the dominant change to a spirit
of expansion, which would be impossible under such remoteness and
isolation; Keplerism will support, or will not especially oppose, the
new dominant. This is the essential process of embryonic growth, by
which the same protoplasmic substance responds differently in different
phases.

But I do not think that all data are so plastic. There are some that
will not assimilate with a prevailing doctrine. They can have no effect
upon an arbitrary system of thought, or a system subconsciously induced,
in its time of dominance: they will simply be disregarded.

We have reached our catalogue of the sights and the sounds to which all
that we have so far considered is merely introductory. For them there
are either no conventional explanations or poor insufficiencies
half-heartedly offered. Our data are glimpses of an epoch that is
approaching with far-away explosions. It is vibrating on its edges with
the tread of distant space-armies. Already it has pictured in the sky
visions that signify new excitements, even now lapping over into the
affairs of a self-disgusted, played-out hermitage.

We assemble the data. Unhappily, we shall be unable to resist the
temptation to reason and theorize. May Super-embryology have mercy upon
our own syllogisms. We consider that we are entitled to at least 13
pages of gross and stupid errors. After that we shall have to explain.
