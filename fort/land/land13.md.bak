## PART II

### 13

<span class="smallcaps">June</span>, 1801—a mirage of an unknown city.
It was seen, for more than an hour, at Youghal, Co. Cork, Ireland—a
representation of mansions, surrounded by shrubbery and white
palings—forests behind. In October, 1796, a mirage of a walled town had
been seen distinctly for half an hour at Youghal. Upon March 9, 1797,
had been seen a mirage of a walled town.

Feb. 7, 1802—an unknown body that was seen, by Fritsch, of Magdeburg, to
cross the sun (*Observatory*, 3-136).

Oct. 10, 1802—an unknown dark body was seen, by Fritsch, rapidly
crossing the sun (*Comptes Rendus*, 83-587). Between 10 and 11 o'clock,
morning of Oct. 8, 1803, a stone fell from the sky, at the town of Apt,
France. About eight hours later, "some persons believed that they felt
an earthquake" (*Rept. B. A.*, 1854-53).

Upon August 11, 1805, an explosive sound was heard at East Haddam,
Connecticut. There are records of six prior sounds, as if of explosions,
that were heard at East Haddam, beginning with the year 1791, but,
unrecorded, the sounds had attracted attention for a century, and had
been called the "Moodus" sounds, by the Indians. For the best account of
the "Moodus" sounds, see the *Amer. Jour. Sci.*, 39-339. Here a writer
tries to show the phenomena were subterranean, but says that there was
no satisfactory explanation.

Upon the 2nd of April, 1808, over the town of Pignerol, Piedmont, Italy,
a loud sound was heard: in many places in Piedmont an earthquake was
felt. In the *Rept. B. A.*, 1854-68, it is said that aerial phenomena
did occur; that, before the explosion, luminous objects had been seen in
the sky over Pignerol, and that in several of the communes in the Alps
aerial sounds, as if of innumerable

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

stones colliding, had been heard, and that quakes had been felt. From
April 2 to April 8, forty shocks were recorded at Pignerol; sounds like
cannonading were heard at Barga. Upon the 18th of April, two detonations
were heard at La Tour, and a luminous object was seen in the sky. The
supposition, or almost absolute belief of most persons is that from the
2nd to the 18th of April this earth had moved far in its orbit and was
rotating so that, if one should explain that probably meteors had
exploded here, it could not very well be thought that more meteors were
continuing to pick out this one point upon a doubly moving planet. But
something was specially related to this one local sky. Upon the 19th of
April, a stone fell from the sky at Borgo San Donnino, about 40 miles
east of Piedmont (*Rept. B. A.*, 1860). Sounds like cannonading were
heard almost every day in this small region. Upon the 13th of May, a red
cloud such as marks the place of a meteoric explosion was seen in the
sky. Throughout the rest of the year, phenomena that are now listed as
"earthquakes" occurred in Piedmont. The last occurrence of which I have
record was upon Jan. 22, 1810.

Feb. 9, 1812—two explosive sounds at East Haddam (*Amer. Jour. Sci.*,
39-339).

July 5, 1812—one explosive sound at East Haddam (*Amer. Jour. Sci.*,
39-339).

Oct. 28, 1812—"phantom soldiers" at Havarah Park, near Ripley, England
(*Edinburgh Annual Register*, 1812-II-124). When such appearances are
explained by meteorologists, they are said to be displays of the aurora
borealis. Psychic research explains variously. The physicists say that
they are mirages of troops marching somewhere at a distance.

Night of July 31, 1813—flashes of light in the sky of Tottenham, near
London (*Year Book of Facts*, 1853-272). The sky was clear. The flashes
were attributed to a storm at Hastings, 65 miles away. We note not only
that the planet Mars was in opposition at this time (July 30), but in
one of the nearest of its oppositions in the 19th century.

Dec. 28, 1813—an explosive sound at East Haddam.

Feb. 2, 1816—a quake at Lisbon. There was something in the

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

sky. Extraordinary sounds were heard, but were attributed to "flocks of
birds." But six hours later something was seen in the sky: it is said to
have been a meteor (*Rept. B. A.*, 1854-106).

Since the year 1788, many earthquakes, or concussions that were listed
as earthquakes, had occurred at the town of Comrie, Perthshire,
Scotland. Seventeen instances were recorded in the year 1795. Almost all
records of the phenomena of Comrie start with the year 1788, but, in
Macara's *Guide to Creifi*, it is said that the disturbances were
recorded as far back as the year 1597. They were slight shocks, and
until the occurrence upon Aug. 13, 1816, conventional explanations,
excluding all thought of relations with anything in the sky, seemed
adequate enough. But, in an account in the London *Times*, Aug. 21,
1816, it is said that, at the time of the quake of August 13, a luminous
object, or a "small meteor," had been seen at Dunkeld, near Comrie; and,
according to David Milne (*Edin. New Phil. Jour.*, 31-110), a resident
of Comrie had reported "a large luminous body, bent like a crescent,
which stretched itself over the heavens."

There was another quake in Scotland (Inverness) June 30, 1817. It is
said that hot water fell from the sky (*Rept. B. A.*, 1854-112).

Jan. 6, 1818—an unknown body that crossed the sun, according to Loft, of
Ipswich; observed about three hours and a half (*Quar. Jour. Roy.
Inst.*, 5-117).

Five unknown bodies that were seen, upon June 26, 1819, crossing the
sun, according to Gruithuisen (*An. Sci. Disc.*, 1860-411). Also, upon
this day, Pastorff saw something that he thought was a comet, which was
then somewhere near the sun, but which, according to Olbers, could not
have been the comet (Webb, *Celestial Objects*, p. 40).

Upon Aug. 28, 1819, there was a violent quake at Irkutsk, Siberia. There
had been two shocks upon Aug. 22, 1813 (*Rept. B. A.*, 1854-101). Upon
April 6, 1805, or March 25, according to the Russian calendar, two
stones had fallen from the sky at Irkutsk (*Rept. B. A.*, 1860-12). One
of these stones is now in the South Kensington Museum, London. Another
violent shock at Irkutsk, April 7, 1820 (*Rept. B. A.*, 1854-128).

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

Unknown bodies in the sky, in the year 1820, February 12 and April 27
(*Comptes Rendus*, 83-314).

Things that marched in the sky—see Arago's *Œuvres*, 11-576, or *Annales
de Chimie*, 30-417—objects that were seen by many persons, in the
streets of Embrun, during the eclipse of Sept. 7, 1820, moving in
straight lines, turning and retracting in the same straight lines, all
of them separated by uniform spaces.

Early in the year 1821—and a light shone out on the moon—a bright point
of light in the lunar crater Aristarchus, which was in the dark at the
time. It was seen, upon the 4th and the 7th of February, by Capt. Kater
(*An. Reg.*, 1821-689); and upon the 5th by Dr. Olbers (*Mems. R. A.
S.*, 1-159). It was a light like a star, and was seen again, May 4th and
6th, by the Rev. M. Ward and by Francis Bailey (*Mems. R. A. S.*,
1-159). At Cape Town, nights of Nov. 28th and 29th, 1821, again a
star-like light was seen upon the moon (*Phil. Trans.*, 112-237).

*Quar. Jour. Roy. Inst.*, 20-417:

That, early in the morning of March 20, 1822, detonations were heard at
Melida, an island in the Adriatic. All day, at intervals, the sounds
were heard. They were like cannonading, and it was supposed that they
came from a vessel, or from Turkish artillery, practicing in some
frontier village. For thirty days the detonations continued, sometimes
thirty or forty, sometimes several hundred, a day.

Upon April 13, 1822, it seems, according to description, that clearly
enough was there an explosion in the sky of Comrie, and a concussion of
the ground—"two loud reports, one apparently over our heads, and the
other, which followed immediately, under our feet" (*Edin. New Phil.
Jour.*, 31-119).

July 15, 1822—the fall of perhaps unknown seeds from perhaps an unknown
world—a great quantity of little round seeds that fell from the sky at
Marienwerder, Germany. They were unknown to the inhabitants, who tried
to cook them, but found that boiling seemed to have no effect upon them.
Wherever they came from, they were brought down by a storm, and two days
later, more of them fell, in a storm, in Silesia. It is said that these
corpuscles were identified by some scientists as seeds of *Galium
spurium*, but that other scientists

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

disagreed. Later more of them fell at Posen, Mecklenburg. See *Bull. des
Sci.* (*math., astro., etc.*) 1-1-298.

Aug. 19, 1822—a tremendous detonation at Melida—others continuing
several days.

Oct. 23, 1822—two unknown dark bodies crossing the sun; observed by
Pastorff (*An. Sci. Disc.*, 1860-411).

An unknown, shining thing—it was seen, by Webb, May 22, 1823, near the
planet Venus (*Nature*, 14-19).

More unknowns, in the year 1823—see *Comptes Rendus*, 49-811 and Webb's
*Celestial Objects*, p. 43.

February, 1824—the sounds of Melida.

Upon Feb. II, 1824, a slight shock was felt at Irkutsk, Siberia (*Rept.
B. A.*, 1854-124). Upon February 18, or, according to other accounts,
upon May 14, a stone that weighed five pounds, fell from the sky at
Irkutsk (*Rept. B. A.*, 1860-70). Three severe shocks at Irkutsk, March
8, 1824 (*Rept. B. A.*, 1854-124).

September, 1824—the sounds of Melida.

At five o'clock, morning of Oct. 20, 1824, a light was seen upon the
dark part of the moon, by Gruithuisen. It disappeared. Six minutes later
it appeared again, disappeared again, and then flashed intermittently,
until 5:30 A.M., when sunrise ended the observations (*Sci. Amer. Sup.*,
7-2712). And, upon Jan. 22, 1825, again shone out the star-like light of
Aristarchus, reported by the Rev. J. B. Emmett (*Annals of Philosophy*,
28-338).

The last sounds of Melida of which I have record, were heard in March,
1825. If these detonations did come from the sky, there was something
that, for at least three years, was situated over, or was in some other
way specially related to, this one small part of this earth's surface,
subversively to all supposed principles of astronomy and geodesy. It is
said that, to find out whether the sounds did come from the sky, or not,
the Prêteur of Melida went into underground caverns to listen. It is
said that there the sounds could not be heard.
