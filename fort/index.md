# Fortean Texts

In the early twentieth century Charles Fort put together great
quantities of exhaustively documented 'puzzling evidence.' This is data
which science is unable or unwilling to explain, such rains of fish or
blood, mysterious animals, or manufactured artifacts in deep strata.
Fort collected numerous accounts of aerial phenomena prior to the
invention of aviation, including huge cylinders and spheres in the sky.
Many of these would today be considered [UFOs](../ufo/index.md).

1941 Thayer one-volume edition of Fort's works. The page numbering in
each text reflects that edition. Copyrighted material in the Thayer
