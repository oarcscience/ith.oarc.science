<span class="smallcaps">The</span> New Dominant.

I mean "primarily" all that opposes Exclusionism—

That Development or Progress or Evolution is Attempt to Positivize, and
is a mechanism by which a positive existence is recruited—that what we
call existence is a womb of infinitude, and is itself only
incubatory—that eventually all attempts are broken down by the falsely
excluded. Subjectively, the breaking down is aided by our own sense of
false and narrow limitations. So the classic and academic artists
wrought positivist paintings, and expressed the only ideal that I am
conscious of, though we so often hear of "ideals" instead of different
manifestations, artistically, scientifically, theologically,
politically, of the One Ideal. They sought to satisfy, in its artistic
aspect, cosmic craving for unity or completeness, sometimes called
harmony, called beauty in some aspects. By disregard they sought
completeness. But the light-effects that they disregarded, and their
narrow confinement to standardized subjects brought on the revolt of the
Impressionists. So the Puritans tried to systematize, and they
disregarded physical needs, or vices, or relaxations: they were invaded
and overthrown when their narrowness became obvious and intolerable. All
things strive for positiveness, for themselves, or for quasi-systems of
which they are parts. Formality and the mathematic, the regular and the
uniform are aspects of the positive state—but the Positive is the
Universal—so all attempted positiveness that seems to satisfy in the
aspects of formality and regularity, sooner or later disqualifies in the
aspect of wideness or universalness. So there is revolt against the
science of today, because the formulated utterances that were regarded
as final truths in a past generation, are now seen to be
insufficiencies. Every pronouncement that has opposed our own
acceptances has been

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

found to be a composition like any academic painting: something that is
arbitrarily cut off from relations with environment, or framed off from
interfering and disturbing data, or outlined with disregards. Our own
attempt has been to take in the included, but also to take in the
excluded into wider expressions. We accept, however, that for every one
of our expressions there are irreconcilables somewhere—that final
utterance would include all things. However, of such is the gossip of
angels. The final is unutterable in quasi-existence, where to think is
to include but also to exclude, or be not final. If we admit that for
every opinion we have expressed, there must somewhere be an
irreconcilable, we are Intermediatists and not positivists; not even
higher positivists. Of course it may be that some day we shall
systematize and dogmatize and refuse to think of anything that we may be
accused of disregarding, and believe instead of merely accepting: then,
if we could have a wider system, which would acknowledge no
irreconcilables we'd be higher positivists. So long as we only accept,
we are not higher positivists, but our feeling is that the New Dominant,
even though we have thought of it only as another enslavement, will be
the nucleus for higher positivism—and that it will be the means of
elevating into infinitude a new batch of fixed stars—until, as a
recruiting instrument, it, too, will play out, and will give way to some
new medium for generating absoluteness. It is our acceptance that all
astronomers of today have lost their souls, or, rather, all chance of
attaining Entity, but that Copernicus and Kepler and Galileo and Newton,
and, conceivably, Leverrier are now fixed stars. Some day I shall
attempt to identify them. In all this, I think we're quite a Moses. We
point out the Promised Land, but, unless we be cured of our
Intermediatism, will never be reported in *Monthly Notices*, ourself.

In our acceptance, Dominants, in their succession, displace preceding
Dominants not only because they are more nearly positive, but because
the old Dominants, as recruiting mediums, play out. Our expression is
that the New Dominant, of Wider Inclusions, is now manifesting
throughout the world, and that the old Exclusion-ism is everywhere
breaking down. In physics Exclusionism is breaking down by its own
researches in radium, for instance, and in its

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

speculations upon electrons, or its merging away into metaphysics, and
by the desertion that has been going on for many years, by such men as
Gurney, Crookes, Wallace, Flammarion, Lodge, to formerly disregarded
phenomena—no longer called "spiritualism" but now "psychic research."
Biology is in chaos: conventional Darwinites mixed up with mutationists
and orthogenesists and followers of Wisemann, who take from Darwinism
one of its pseudo-bases, and nevertheless try to reconcile their
heresies with orthodoxy. The painters are metaphysicians and
psychologists. The breaking down of Exclusionism in China and Japan and
in the United States has astonished History. The science of astronomy is
going downward so that, though Pickering, for instance, did speculate
upon a Trans-Neptunian planet, and Lowell did try to have accepted
heretical ideas as to marks on Mars, attention is now minutely focused
upon such technicalities as variations in shades of Jupiter's fourth
satellite. I think that, in general acceptance, over-refinement
indicates decadence.

I think that the stronghold of Inclusionism is in aeronautics. I think
that the stronghold of the Old Dominant, when it was new, was in the
invention of the telescope. Or that coincidentally with the breakdown of
Exclusionism appears the means of finding out—whether there are vast
aerial fields of ice and floating lakes full of frogs and fishes or
not—where carved stones and black substances and great quantities of
vegetable matter and flesh, which may be dragons' flesh, come
from—whether there are inter-planetary trade routes and vast areas
devastated by Super-Tamerlanes—whether sometimes there are visitors to
this earth—who might be pursued and captured and questioned.
