### 10

<span class="smallcaps">Early</span> explorers have Florida mixed up
with Newfoundland. But the confusion is worse than that still earlier.
It arises from simplicity. Very early explorers think that all land
westward is one land, India: awareness of other lands as well as India
comes as a slow process. I do not now think of things arriving upon this
earth from some especial other world. That was my notion when I started
to collect our data. Or, as is a commonplace of observation, all
intellection begins with the illusion of homogeneity. It's one of
Spencer's data: we see homogeneousness in all things distant, or with
which we have small acquaintance. Advance from the relatively
homogeneous to the relatively heterogeneous is Spencerian
Philosophy—like everything else, so-called: not that it was really
Spencer's discovery, but was taken from von Baer, who, in turn, was
continuous with preceding evolutionary speculation. Our own expression
is that all things are acting to advance to the homogeneous, or are
trying to localize Homogeneousness. Homogeneousness is an aspect of the
Universal, wherein it is a state that does not merge away into something
else. We regard homogeneousness as an aspect of positiveness, but it is
our acceptance that infinite frustrations of attempts to positivize
manifest themselves in infinite heterogeneity: so that though things try
to localize homogeneousness they end up in heterogeneity so great that
it amounts to infinite dispersion or indistinguishability.

So all concepts are little attempted positivenesses, but soon have to
give in to compromise, modification, nullification, merging away into
indistinguishability—unless, here and there, in the world's history,
there may have been a super-dogmatist, who, for only an infinitesimal of
time, has been able to hold out against heterogeneity or modification or
doubt or "listening to reason," or loss of identity—in which
case—instant translation to heaven or the Positive Absolute.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Odd thing about Spencer is that he never recognized that "homogeneity,"
"integration," and "definiteness" are all words for the same state, or
the state that we call "positiveness." What we call his mistake is in
that he regarded "homogeneousness" as negative.

I began with a notion of some one other world, from which objects and
substances have fallen to this earth; which had, or which, to less
degree, has a tutelary interest in this earth; which is now attempting
to communicate with this earth—modifying, because of data which will
pile up later, into acceptance that some other world is not attempting
but has been, for centuries, in communication with a sect, perhaps, or a
secret society, or certain esoteric ones of this earth's inhabitants.

I lose a great deal of hypnotic power in not being able to concentrate
attention upon some one other world.

As I have admitted before I'm intelligent, as contrasted with the
orthodox. I haven't the aristocratic disregard of a New York curator or
an Eskimo medicine-man.

I have to dissipate myself in acceptance of a host of other worlds: size
of the moon, some of them: one of them, at least—tremendous thing: we'll
take that up later. Vast, amorphous aerial regions, to which such
definite words as "worlds" and "planets" seem inapplicable. And
artificial constructions that I have called "super-constructions": one
of them about the size of Brooklyn, I should say, offhand. And one or
more of them wheel-shaped things a goodly number of square miles in
area.

I think that earlier in this book, before we liberalized into embracing
everything that comes along, your indignation, or indigestion would have
expressed in the notion that, if this were so, astronomers would have
seen these other worlds and regions and vast geometric constructions.
You'd have had that notion: you'd have stopped there.

But the attempt to stop is saying "enough" to the insatiable. In cosmic
punctuation there are no periods: illusion of periods is incomplete view
of colons and semi-colons.

We can't stop with the notion that if there were such phenomena,
astronomers would have seen them. Because of our experience with

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

suppression and disregard, we suspect, before we go into the subject at
all, that astronomers have seen them; that navigators and meteorologists
have seen them; that individual scientists and other trained observers
have seen them many times—

That it is the System that has excluded data of them.

As to the Law of Gravitation, and astronomers' formulas, remember that
these formulas worked out in the time of Laplace as well as they do now.
But there are hundreds of planetary bodies now known that were then not
known. So a few hundred worlds more of ours won't make any difference.
Laplace knew of about only thirty bodies in this solar system: about six
hundred are recognized now

What are the discoveries of geology and biology to a theologian?

His formulas still work out as well as they ever did.

If the Law of Gravitation could be stated as a real utterance, it might
be a real resistance to us. But we are told only that gravitation is
gravitation. Of course to an intermediatist, nothing can be defined
except in terms of itself—but even the orthodox, in what seems to me to
be the innate premonitions of realness, not founded upon experience,
agree that to define a thing in terms of itself is not real definition.
It is said that by gravitation is meant the attraction of all things
proportionately to mass and inversely as the square of the distance.
Mass would mean inter-attraction holding together final particles, if
there were final particles. Then, until final particles be discovered,
only one term of this expression survives, or mass is attraction. But
distance is only extent of mass, unless one holds out for absolute
vacuum among planets, a position against which we could bring a host of
data. But there is no possible means of expressing that gravitation is
anything other than attraction. So there is nothing to resist us but
such a phantom as—that gravitation is the gravitation of all
gravitations proportionately to gravitation and inversely as the square
of gravitation. In a quasi-existence, nothing more sensible than this
can be said upon any so-called subject—perhaps there are higher
approximations to ultimate sensibleness.

Nevertheless we seem to have a feeling that with the System against us
we have a kind of resistance here. We'd have felt so

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

formerly, at any rate: I think the Dr. Grays and Prof. Hitchcocks have
modified our trustfulness toward indistinguishability. As to the
perfection of this System that quasi-opposes us and the infallibility of
its mathematics—as if there could be real mathematics in a mode of
seeming where twice two are not four—we've been told over and over of
their vindication in the discovery of Neptune.

I'm afraid that the course we're taking will turn out like every other
development. We began humbly, admitting that we're of the damned—

But our eyebrows—

Just a faint flicker in them, or in one of them, every time we hear of
the "triumphal discovery of Neptune"—this "monumental achievement of
theoretical astronomy," as the text-books call it.

The whole trouble is that we've looked it up.

The text-books omit this:

That, instead of the orbit of Neptune agreeing with the calculations of
Adams and Leverrier, it was so different—that Leverrier said that it was
not the planet of his calculations.

Later it was thought best to say no more upon that subject.

The text-books omit this:

That, in 1846, everyone who knew a sine from a cosine was out sining and
cosining for a planet beyond Uranus.

Two of them guessed right.

To some minds, even after Leverrier's own rejection of Neptune, the word
"guessed" may be objectionable—but, according to Prof. Peirce, of
Harvard, the calculations of Adams and Leverrier would have applied
quite as well to positions many degrees from the position of Neptune.

Or for Prof. Peirce's demonstration that the discovery of Neptune was
only a "happy accident," see *Proc. Amer. Acad. Sciences*, 1-65. For
references, see Lowell's *Evolution of Worlds*.

Or comets: another nebulous resistance to our own notions. As to
eclipses, I have notes upon several of them that did not occur upon
scheduled time, though with differences only of seconds—and one
delightful lost soul, deep-buried, but buried in the ultra-respectable
records of the Royal Astronomical Society, upon an eclipse that

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

did not occur at all. That delightful, ultra-sponsored thing of
perdition is too good and malicious to be dismissed with passing notice:
we'll have him later.

Throughout the history of astronomy, every comet that has come back upon
predicted time—not that, essentially, there was anything more abstruse
about it than is a prediction that you can make of a postman's
periodicities tomorrow—was advertised for all it was worth. It's the way
reputations are worked up for fortune-tellers by the faithful. The
comets that didn't come back—omitted or explained. Or Encke's comet. It
came back slower and slower. But the astronomers explained. Be almost
absolutely sure of that: Iv they explained. They had it all worked out
and formulated and "proved" why that comet was coming back slower and
slower—and there the damn thing began coming faster and faster.

Halley's comet.

Astronomy—"the perfect science, as we astronomers like to call it."
(Jacoby.)

It's my own notion that if, in a real existence, an astronomer could not
tell one longitude from another, he'd be sent back to this purgatory of
ours until he could meet that simple requirement.

Halley was sent to the Cape of Good Hope to determine its longitude. He
got it degrees wrong. He gave to Africa's noble Roman promontory a
retroussé twist that would take the pride out of any Kaffir.

We hear everlastingly of Halley's comet. It came back—maybe. But, unless
we look the matter up in contemporaneous records, we hear nothing of—the
Leonids, for instance. By the same methods as those by which Halley's
comet was predicted, the Leonids were predicted. November, 1898—no
Leonids. It was explained. They had been perturbed. They would appear in
November, 1899. November, 1899—November, 1900—no Leonids.

My notion of astronomic accuracy:

Who could not be a prize marksman, if only his hits be recorded?

As to Halley's comet, of 1910—everybody now swears he saw it. He has to
perjure himself: otherwise he'd be accused of having no interest in
great, inspiring things that he's never given any attention to.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

Regard this:

That there never is a moment when there is not some comet in the sky.
Virtually there is no year in which several new comets are not
discovered, so plentiful are they. Luminous fleas on a vast black dog—in
popular impressions, there is no realization of the extent to which this
solar system is flea-bitten.

If a comet have not the orbit that astronomers have predicted—perturbed.
If—like Halley's comet—it be late—even a year late—perturbed. When a
train is an hour late, we have small opinion of the predictions of
timetables. When a comet's a year late, all we ask is—that it be
explained. We hear of the inflation and arrogance of astronomers. My own
acceptance is not that they are imposing upon us: that they are
requiting us. For many of us priests no longer function to give us
seeming rapport with Perfection, Infallibility—the Positive Absolute.
Astronomers have stepped forward to fill a vacancy—with
quasi-phantomosity—but, in our acceptance, with a higher approximation
to substantiality than had the attenuations that preceded them. I should
say, myself, that all that we call progress is not so much response to
"urge" as it is response to a hiatus—or if you want something to grow
somewhere, dig out everything else in its area. So I have to accept that
the positive assurances of astronomers are necessary to us, or the
blunderings, evasions and disguises of astronomers would never be
tolerated: that, given such latitude as they are permitted to take, they
could not be very disastrously mistaken. Suppose the comet called
Halley's had not appeared

Early in 1910, a far more important comet than the anæmic luminosity
said to be Halley's, appeared. It was so brilliant that it was visible
in daylight. The astronomers would have been saved anyway. If this other
comet did not have the predicted orbit—perturbation. If you're going to
Coney Island, and predict there'll be a special kind of a pebble on the
beach, I don't see how you can disgrace yourself, if some other pebble
will do just as well—because the feeble thing said to have been seen in
1910 was no more in accord with the sensational descriptions given out
by astronomers in advance than is a pale pebble with a brick-red
boulder.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

I predict that next Wednesday, a large Chinaman, in evening clothes,
will cross Broadway, at 42nd Street, at 9 P.M. He doesn't, but a
tubercular Jap in a sailor's uniform does cross Broadway, at 35th
Street, Friday, at noon. Well, a Jap is a perturbed Chinaman, and
clothes are clothes.

I remember the terrifying predictions made by the honest and credulous
astronomers, who must have been themselves hypnotized, or they could not
have hypnotized the rest of us, in 1909. Wills were made. Human life
might be swept from this planet. In quasi-existence, which is
essentially Hibernian, that would be no reason why wills should not be
made. The less excitable of us did expect at least some pretty good
fireworks.

I have to admit that it is said that, in New York, a light was seen in
the sky.

It was about as terrifying as the scratch of a match on the seat of some
breeches half a mile away.

It was not on time.

Though I have heard that a faint nebulosity, which I did not see,
myself, though I looked when I was told to look, was seen in the sky, it
appeared several days after the time predicted.

A hypnotized host of imbeciles of us: told to look up at the sky: we
did—like a lot of pointers hypnotized by a partridge.

The effect:

Almost everybody now swears that he saw Halley's comet, and that it was
a glorious spectacle.

An interesting circumstance here is that seemingly we are trying to
discredit astronomers because astronomers oppose us—that's not my
impression. We shall be in the Brahmin caste of the hell of the
Baptists. Almost all our data, in some regiments of this procession, are
observations by astronomers, few of them mere amateur astronomers. It is
the System that opposes us. It is the System that is suppressing
astronomers. I think we pity them in their captivity. Ours is not
malice—in a positive sense. It's chivalry—somewhat. Unhappy astronomers
looking out from high towers in which they are imprisoned—we appear upon
the horizon.

But, as I have said, our data do not relate to some especial other
world. I mean very much what a savage upon an ocean island

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

might vaguely think of in his speculations—not upon some other land, but
complexes of continents and their phenomena: cities, factories in
cities, means of communication

Now all the other savages would know of a few vessels sailing in their
regular routes, passing this island in regularized periodicities. The
tendency in these minds would be expression of the universal tendency
toward positivism—or Completeness—or conviction that these few
regularized vessels constituted all. Now I think of some especial savage
who suspects otherwise—because he's very backward and unimaginative and
insensible to the beautiful ideals of the others: not piously occupied,
like the others, in bowing before impressive-looking sticks of wood;
dishonestly taking time for his speculations, while the others are
patriotically witch-finding. So the other higher and nobler savages know
about the few regularized vessels: know when to expect them; have their
periodicities all worked out; just about when vessels will pass, or
eclipse each other—explaining that all vagaries were due to atmospheric
conditions.

They'd come out strong in explaining.

You can't read a book upon savages without noting what resolute
explainers they are.

They'd say that all this mechanism was founded upon the mutual
attraction of the vessels—deduced from the fall of a monkey from a palm
tree—or, if not that, that devils were pushing the vessels—something of
the kind.

Storms.

Débris, not from these vessels, cast up by the waves.

Disregarded.

How can one think of something and something else, too?

I'm in the state of mind of a savage who might find upon a shore, washed
up by the same storm, buoyant parts of a piano and a paddle that was
carved by cruder hands than his own: something light and summery from
India, and a fur overcoat from Russia—or all science, though
approximating wider and wider, is attempt to conceive of India in terms
of an ocean island, and of Russia in terms of India so interpreted.
Though I am trying to think of Russia and India in world-wide terms, I
cannot think that that, or the universalizing of the local, is cosmic
purpose. The higher idealist

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

is the positivist who tries to localize the universal, and is in accord
with cosmic purpose: the super-dogmatist of a local savage who can hold
out, without a flurry of doubt, that a piano washed up on a beach is the
trunk of a palm tree that a shark has bitten, leaving his teeth in it.
So we fear for the soul of Dr. Gray, because he did not devote his whole
life to that one stand that, whether possible or inconceivable,
thousands of fishes had been cast from one bucket.

So, unfortunately for myself, if salvation be desirable, I look out
widely but amorphously, indefinitely and heterogeneously. If I say I
conceive of another world that is now in secret communication with
certain esoteric inhabitants of this earth, I say I conceive of still
other worlds that are trying to establish communication with all the
inhabitants of this earth. I fit my notions to the data I find. That is
supposed to be the right and logical and scientific thing to do; but it
is no way to approximate to form, system, organization. Then I think I
conceive of other worlds and vast structures that pass us by, within a
few miles, without the slightest desire to communicate, quite as tramp
vessels pass many islands without particularizing one from another. Then
I think I have data of a vast construction that has often come to this
earth, dipped into an ocean, submerged there a while, then going
away—Why? I'm not absolutely sure. How would an Eskimo explain a vessel,
sending ashore for coal, which is plentiful upon some Arctic beaches,
though of unknown use to the natives, then sailing away, with no
interest in the natives?

A great difficulty in trying to understand vast constructions that show
no interest in us:

The notion that we must be interesting.

I accept that, though we're usually avoided, probably for moral reasons,
sometimes this earth has been visited by explorers. I think that the
notion that there have been extra-mundane visitors to China, within what
we call the historic period, will be only ordinarily absurd, when we
come to that datum.

I accept that some of the other worlds are of conditions very similar to
our own. I think of others that are very different—so

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

that visitors from them could not live here—without artificial
adaptations.

How some of them could breathe our attenuated air, if they came from a
gelatinous atmosphere—

Masks.

The masks that have been found in ancient deposits.

Most of them are of stone, and are said to have been ceremonial regalia
of savages—

But the mask that was found in Sullivan County, Missouri, in 1879
(*American Antiquarian*, 3-336).

It is made of iron and silver.
