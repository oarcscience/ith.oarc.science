### 9

<span class="smallcaps">My</span> own pseudo-conclusion:

That we've been damned by giants sound asleep, or by great scientific
principles and abstractions that cannot realize themselves: that little
harlots have visited their caprices upon us; that clowns, with buckets
of water from which they pretend to cast thousands of good-sized fishes
have anathematized us for laughing disrespectfully, because, as with all
clowns, underlying buffoonery is the desire to be taken seriously; that
pale ignorances, presiding over microscopes by which they cannot
distinguish flesh from nostoc or fishes’ spawn or frogs’ spawn, have
visited upon us their wan solemnities. We've been damned by corpses and
skeletons and mummies, which twitch and totter with pseudo-life derived
from conveniences.

Or there is only hypnosis. The accursed are those who admit they're the
accursed.

If we be more nearly real we are reasons arraigned before a jury of
dream-phantasms.

Of all meteorites in museums, very few were seen to fall. It is
considered sufficient grounds for admission if specimens can't be
accounted for in any way other than that they fell from the sky—as if in
the haze of uncertainty that surrounds all things, or that is the
essence of everything, or in the merging away of everything into
something else, there could be anything that could be accounted for in
only one way. The scientist and the theologian reason that if something
can be accounted for in only one way, it is accounted for in that way—or
logic would be logical, if the conditions that it imposes, but, of
course, does not insist upon, could anywhere be found in
quasi-existence. In our acceptance, logic, science, art, religion are,
in our "existence," premonitions of a coming awakening. like dawning
awarenesses of surroundings in the mind of a dreamer.

Any old chunk of metal that measures up to the standard of "true

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

meteoritic material" is admitted by the museums. It may seem incredible
that modern curators still have this delusion, but we suspect that the
date on one's morning newspaper hasn't much to do with one's modernity
all day long. In reading Fletcher's catalogue, for instance, we learn
that some of the best-known meteorites were "found in draining a
field"—"found in making a road"—"turned up by the plow" occurs a dozen
times. Someone fishing in Lake Okeechobee, brought up an object in his
fishing net. No meteorite had ever been seen to fall near it. The U. S.
National Museum accepts it.

If we have accepted only one of the data of "untrue meteoritic
material"—one instance of "carbonaceous" matter—if it be too difficult
to utter the word "coal"—we see that in this inclusion-exclusion, as in
every other means of forming an opinion, false inclusion and false
exclusion have been practiced by curators of museums.

There is something of ultra-pathos—of cosmic sadness—in this universal
search for a standard, and in belief that one has been revealed by
either inspiration or analysis, then the dogged clinging to a poor sham
of a thing long after its insufficiency has been shown—or renewed hope
and search for the special that can be true, or for something local that
could also be universal. It's as if "true meteoritic material" were a
"rock of ages" to some scientific men. They cling. But clingers cannot
hold out welcoming arms.

The only seemingly conclusive utterance, or seemingly substantial thing
to cling to, is a product of dishonesty, ignorance, or fatigue. All
sciences go back and back, until they're worn out with the process, or
until mechanical reaction occurs: then they move forward—as it were.
Then they become dogmatic, and take for bases, positions that were only
points of exhaustion. So chemistry divided and sub-divided down to
atoms; then, in the essential insecurity of all quasi-constructions, it
built up a system, which, to anyone so obsessed by his own hypnoses that
he is exempt to the chemist's hypnoses, is perceptibly enough an
intellectual anæmia built upon infinitesimal debilities.

In *Science*, n.s., 31-298, E. D. Hovey, of the American Museum of
Natural History, asserts or confesses that often have objects of
material such as fossiliferous limestone and slag been sent to him

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

He says that these things have been accompanied by assurances that they
have been seen to fall on lawns, on roads, in front of houses. They are
all excluded. They are not of true meteoritic material. They were on the
ground in the first place. It is only by coincidence that lightning has
struck, or that a real meteorite, which was unfindable, has struck near
objects of slag and limestone.

Mr. Hovey says that the list might be extended indefinitely. That's a
tantalizing suggestion of some very interesting stuff—

He says:

"But it is not worth while."

I'd like to know what strange, damned, excommunicated things have been
sent to museums by persons who have felt convinced that they had seen
what they may have seen, strongly enough to risk ridicule, to make up
bundles, go to express offices, and write letters. I accept that over
the door of every museum, into which such things enter, is written:

"Abandon Hope."

If a Mr. Symons mentions one instance of coal, or of slag or cinders,
said to have fallen from the sky, we are not—except by association with
the "carbonaceous" meteorites—strong in our impression that coal
sometimes falls to this earth from coal-burning super-constructions up
somewhere—

In *Comptes Rendus*, 91-197, M. Daubrée tells the same story. Our
acceptance, then, is that other curators could tell this same story.
Then the phantomosity of our impression substantiates proportionately to
its multiplicity. M. Daubrée says that often have strange damned things
been sent to the French museums, accompanied by assurances that they had
been seen to fall from the sky. Especially to our interest, he mentions
coal and slag.

Excluded.

Buried unnamed and undated in Science's potter's field.

I do not say that the data of the damned should have the same rights as
the data of the saved. That would be justice. That would be of the
Positive Absolute, and, though the ideal of, a violation of, the very
essence of quasi-existence, wherein only to have the appearance of being
is to express a preponderance of force one way or another—or
inequilibrium, or inconsistency, or injustice.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

Our acceptance is that the passing away of exclusionism is a phenomenon
of the twentieth century: that gods of the twentieth century will
sustain our notions be they ever so unwashed and frowsy. But, in our own
expressions, we are limited, by the oneness of quasiness, to the very
same methods by which orthodoxy established and maintains its now sleek,
suave preposterousnesses. At any rate, though we are inspired by an
especial subtle essence—or imponderable, I think—that pervades the
twentieth century, we have not the superstition that we are offering
anything as a positive fact. Rather often we have not the delusion that
we're any less superstitious and credulous than any logician, savage,
curator, or rustic.

An orthodox demonstration, in terms of which we shall have some
heresies, is that if things found in coal could have got there only by
falling there—they fell there.

So, in the *Manchester Lit. and Phil. Soc. Mems.*, 2-9-306, it is argued
that certain roundish stones that have been found in coal are "fossil
aerolites": that they had fallen from the sky, ages ago, when the coal
was soft, because the coal had closed around them, showing no sign of
entrance.

*Proc. Soc. of Antiq. of Scotland*, 1-1-121:

That, in a lump of coal, from a mine in Scotland, an iron instrument had
been found—

"The interest attaching to this singular relic arises from the fact of
its having been found in the heart of a piece of coal, seven feet under
the surface."

If we accept that this object of iron was of workmanship beyond the
means and skill of the primitive men who may have lived in Scotland when
coal was forming there

"The instrument was considered to be modern."

hat our expression has more of realness, or higher approximation to
realness, than has the attempt to explain that is made in the
*Proceedings:*

That in modern times someone may have bored for coal, and that his drill
may have broken off in the coal it had penetrated. Why he should have
abandoned such easily accessible coal, I don't know. The important point
is that there was no sign of boring: that this instrument was in a lump
of coal that had closed around

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

it so that its presence was not suspected, until the lump of coal was
broken.

No mention can I find of this damned thing in any other publication. Of
course there is an alternative here: the thing may not have fallen from
the sky: if in coal-forming times, in Scotland, there were, indigenous
to this earth, no men capable of making such an iron instrument, it may
have been left behind by visitors from other worlds.

In an extraordinary approximation to fairness and justice, which is
permitted to us, because we are quite as desirous to make acceptable
that nothing can be proved as we are to sustain our own expressions, we
note:

That in *Notes and Queries*, 11-1-408, there is an account of an ancient
copper seal, about the size of a penny, found in chalk, at a depth of
from five to six feet, near Bredenstone, England. The design upon it is
said to be of a monk kneeling before a virgin and child: a legend upon
the margin is said to be: "St. Jordanis Monachi Spaldingie."

I don't know about that. It looks very desirable—undesirable to us.

There's a wretch of an ultra-frowsy thing in the *Scientific American*,
7-298, which we condemn ourselves, if somewhere, because of the oneness
of allness, the damned must also be the damning. It's a newspaper story:
that about the first of June, 1851, a powerful blast, near Dorchester,
Mass., cast out from a bed of solid rock a bell-shaped vessel of an
unknown metal: floral designs inlaid with silver; "art of some cunning
workman." The opinion of the Editor of the *Scientific American* is that
the thing had been made by Tubal Cain, who was the first inhabitant of
Dorchester. Though I fear that this is a little arbitrary, I am not
disposed to fly rabidly at every scientific opinion.

*Nature*, 35-36:

A block of metal found in coal, in Austria, 1885. It is now in the
Salsburg museum.

This time we have another expression. Usually our intermediatist attack
upon provincial positivism is: Science, in its attempted positivism
takes something such as "true meteoritic material" as a

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

standard of judgment; but carbonaceous matter, except for its relative
infrequency, is just as veritable a standard of judgment; carbonaceous
matter merges away into such a variety of organic substances, that all
standards are reduced to indistinguishability: if, then, there is no
real standard against us, there is no real resistance to our own
acceptances. Now our intermediatism is: Science takes "true meteoritic
material" as a standard of admission; but now we have an instance that
quite as truly makes "true meteoritic material" a standard of exclusion;
or, then, a thing that denies itself is no real resistance to our own
acceptances—this depending upon whether we have a datum of something of
"true meteoritic material" that orthodoxy can never accept fell from the
sky.

We're a little involved here. Our own acceptance is upon a carved,
geometric thing that, if found in a very old deposit, antedates human
life, except, perhaps, very primitive human life, as an indigenous
product of this earth: but we're quite as much interested in the dilemma
it made for the faithful.

It is of "true meteoritic material." In *L’Astronomie*, 1887-114, it is
said that, though so geometric, its phenomena so characteristic of
meteorites exclude the idea that it was the work of man.

As to the deposit—Tertiary coal.

Composition—iron, carbon, and a small quantity of nickel.

It has the pitted surface that is supposed by the faithful to be
characteristic of meteorites.

For a full account of this subject, see *Comptes Rendus*, 103-702. The
scientists who examined it could reach no agreement. They bifurcated:
then a compromise was suggested; but the compromise is a product of
disregard:

That it was of true meteoritic material, and had not been shaped by man;

That it was not of true meteoritic material, but telluric iron that had
been shaped by man;

That it was true meteoritic material that had fallen from the sky, but
had been shaped by man, after its fall.

The data, one or more of which must be disregarded by each of

these three explanations, are: "true meteoritic material" and surface
markings of meteorites; geometric form; presence in an ancient

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

deposit; material as hard as steel; absence upon this earth, in Tertiary
times, of men who could work in material as hard as steel. It is said
that, though of "true meteoritic material," this object is virtually a
steel object.

St. Augustine, with his orthodoxy, was never in—well, very much
worse—difficulties than are the faithful here. By due disregard of a
datum or so, our own acceptance that it was a steel object that had
fallen from the sky to this earth, in Tertiary times, is not forced upon
one. We offer ours as the only synthetic expression. For instance, in
*Science Gossip*, 1887-58, it is described as a meteorite: in this
account there is nothing alarming to the pious, because, though
everything else is told, its geometric form is not mentioned.

It's a cube. There is a deep incision all around it. Of its faces, two
that are opposite are rounded.

Though I accept that our own expression can only rather approximate to
Truth, by the wideness of its inclusions, and because it seems, of four
attempts, to represent the only complete synthesis, and can be nullified
or greatly modified by data that we, too, have somewhere disregarded,
the only means of nullification that I can think of would be
demonstration that this object is a mass of iron pyrites, which
sometimes forms geometrically. But the analysis mentions not a trace of
sulphur. Of course our weakness, or impositiveness, lies in that, by
anyone to whom it would be agreeable to find sulphur in this thing,
sulphur would be found in it—by our own intermediatism there is some
sulphur in everything, or sulphur is only a localization or emphasis of
something that, unemphasized, is in all things.

So there have, or haven't, been found upon this earth things that fell
from the sky, or that were left behind by extra-mundane visitors to this
earth

A yarn in the London *Times*, June 22, 1844: that some workmen,
quarrying rock, close to the Tweed, about a quarter of a mile below
Rutherford Mills, discovered a gold thread embedded in the stone at a
depth of 8 feet: that a piece of the gold thread had been sent to the
office of the *Kelso Chronicle*.

Pretty little thing; not at all frowsy; rather damnable.

London *Times*, Dec. 24, 1851:

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

That Hiram De Witt, of Springfield, Mass., returning from California,
had brought with him a piece of auriferous quartz about the size of a
man's fist. It was accidentally dropped—split open—nail in it. There was
a cut-iron nail, size of a six-penny nail, slightly corroded. "It was
entirely straight and had a perfect head."

Or—California—ages ago, when auriferous quartz was
forming—super-carpenter, million of miles or so up in the air—drops a
nail.

To one not an intermediatist, it would seem incredible that this datum,
not only of the damned, but of the lowest of the damned, or of the
journalistic caste of the accursed, could merge away with something else
damned only by disregard, and backed by what is called "highest
scientific authority"

Communication by Sir David Brewster (*Rept. Brit. Assoc.*, 1845-51)

That a nail had been found in a block of stone from Kingoodie Quarry,
North Britain. The block in which the nail was found was nine inches
thick, but as to what part of the quarry it had come from, there is no
evidence—except that it could not have been from the surface. The quarry
had been worked about twenty years. It consisted of alternate layers of
hard stone and a substance called "till." The point of the nail, quite
eaten with rust, projected into some "till," upon the surface of the
block of stone. The rest of the nail lay upon the surface of the stone
to within an inch of the head—that inch of it was embedded in the stone.

Although its caste is high, this is a thing profoundly of the
damned—sort of a Brahmin as regarded by a Baptist. Its case was stated
fairly; Brewster related all circumstances available to him—but there
was no discussion at the meeting of the British Association: no
explanation was offered—

Nevertheless the thing can be nullified—

But the nullification that we find is as much against orthodoxy in one
respect as it is against our own expression that inclusion in quartz or
sandstone indicates antiquity—or there would have to be a revision of
prevailing dogmas upon quartz and sandstone and age indicated by them,
if the opposing data should be accepted. Of course it may be contended
by both the orthodox and us heretics

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

that the opposition is only a yarn from a newspaper. By an odd
combination, we find our two lost souls that have tried to emerge,
chucked back to perdition by one blow:

*Pop. Sci. News*, 1884-41:

That, according to the *Carson Appeal*, there had been found in a mine,
quartz crystals that could have had only 15 years in which to form:
that, where a mill had been built, sandstone had been found, when the
mill was torn down, that had hardened in 12 years: that in this
sandstone was a piece of wood "with a nail in it."

*Annals of Scientific Discovery*, 1853-71:

That, at the meeting of the British Association, 1853, Sir David
Brewster had announced that he had to bring before the meeting an object
"of so incredible a nature that nothing short of the strongest evidence
was necessary to render the statement at all probable."

A crystal lens had been found in the treasure-house at Nineveh.

In many of the temples and treasure houses of old civilizations upon
this earth have been preserved things that have fallen from the sky—or
meteorites.

Again we have a Brahmin. This thing is buried alive in the heart of
propriety: it is in the British Museum.

Carpenter, in *The Microscope and Its Revelations*, gives two drawings
of it. Carpenter argues that it is impossible to accept that optical
lenses had ever been made by the ancients. Never occurred to him—someone
a million miles or so up in the air—looking through his telescope—lens
drops out.

This does not appeal to Carpenter: he says that this object must have
been an ornament.

According to Brewster, it was not an ornament, but "a true optical
lens."

In that case, in ruins of an old civilization upon this earth, has been
found an accursed thing that was, acceptably, not a product of any old
civilization indigenous to this earth.
