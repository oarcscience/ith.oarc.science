<span class="smallcaps">London</span> *Daily Chronicle*, March 30,
1922—"It is incredible, but nothing has been heard of Holding."

For three weeks a search had been going on—cyclists, police, farmers,
people from villages.

At half past ten o'clock, morning of the 7th of March, 1922, Flying
Officer B. Holding had set out from an aerodrome, near Chester, England,
upon what was intended by him to be a short flight in Wales. About
eleven o'clock, he was seen, near Llangollen, Wales, turning back,
heading back toward Chester

Holding disappeared far from the sea, and he disappeared over a densely
populated land. One of my jobs was that of looking over six London
newspapers for the years 1919-1926, and it is improbable that anything
was learned of what became of Holding, later, without my knowing of it.
I haven't a datum upon which to speculate, in the Holding mystery: but
now I have a story of two men, whose track on land stopped as abruptly
as stopped Holding's track in the sky: and this time I note an
additional circumstance. The story of these men is laid in a surrounding
of hates of the intensity of oriental fanaticism.

Upon July 24, 1924, at a time of Arab hostility, Flight-Lieutenant W. T.
Day and Pilot Officer D. R. Stewart were sent from British headquarters,
upon an ordinary reconnaissance over a desert in Mesopotamia. According
to schedule, they would not be absent more than several hours. I take
this account from the London *Sunday Express*, Sept. 21, 28, 1924.

The men did not return, and they were searched for. The plane was soon
found, in the desert. Why it should have landed was a

<span id="page_954">p. 954</span>

problem. "There was some petrol left in the tank. There was nothing
wrong with the craft. It was, in fact, flown back to the aerodrome." But
the men were missing. "So far as can be ascertained, they encountered no
meteorological conditions that might have forced them to land." There
were no marks to indicate that the plane had been shot at. There may be
some way, at present very exclusively known, of picking an aeroplane out
of the sky. According to the rest of this story, there may be some such
way of picking men out of a desert.

In the sand, around the plane, were seen the footprints of Day and
Stewart. "They were traced, side by side, for some forty yards from the
machine. Then, as suddenly as if they had come to the brink of a cliff,
the marks ended."

The landing of the plane was unaccountable. But, accepting that as a
minor mystery, the suggested explanation of the abrupt ending of the
footprints was that Day and Stewart had been captured by hostile
Bedouins, who had brushed away all trails in the sand, starting at the
point forty yards from the plane. But hostile Bedouins could not be
thought of as keeping on brushing indefinitely, and a search was made
for a renewal of traces.

Aeroplanes, armored cars, and mounted police searched. Rewards were
offered. Tribal patrols searched unceasingly for four days. Nowhere
beyond the point where the tracks in the sand ended abruptly, were other
tracks found. The latest account of which I have record is from the
London *Sunday News*, March 15, 1925—mystery of the missing British
airmen still unsolved.

London *Evening News*, Sept. 28, 1923—"Second-Lieut. Morand, while at
shooting practice, at Gadaux, France—himself firing at a target on the
ground, while a sergeant piloted the machine—suddenly fell back, calling
to the pilot to land, as he had been wounded. It was found that he had a
serious wound in his shoulder, and he was taken to Bordeaux, by the
hospital aeroplane." It was said that he had been shot. "But no clue has
been found, as to the origin of the shot."

I especially notice this case, because it was at a time of other
"accidents" to French fliers. The other "accidents" were different, in
that they did not occur in France, and in that they were not

<span id="page_955">p. 955</span>

shootings. I know of no case that in all particulars I can match with
the disappearance of Day and Stewart: but there are records of airmen
who, flying over a land where the sight of them directed hate upon them,
were unaccountably picked out of the sky.

In this summer of 1923, French aviators told of inexplicable mishaps and
forced landings, while flying over German territory. The instances were
so frequent that there arose a belief that, with "secret rays," the
Germans were practicing upon French aeroplanes. From a general
impression of an existence of rationality-irrationality, we can conceive
that the Germans were practicing upon French aeroplanes something that
they were most particularly endeavoring to keep secret from France—if
they had any such powers. But I think that they had not—or that
officially they had not. There may have been a hidden experimenter,
unknown to the German authorities.

An article upon this subject was published in the *London Daily Mail*,
Sept. 1, 1923. "Two theories have been put forward. One is that by a
concentration of wireless rays the magneto of the aeroplane may be
affected; and another is that a new ray, which will melt certain metals,
has been discovered. In this connection it is notable that most of the
forced landings of the French aeroplanes, when flying from Strasbourg to
Prague, have taken place in the vicinity of a German aerodrome, near
Furth." It was said that for some time, at the German wireless station
at Nauen, there had been experiments upon directional wireless, with the
object of sending out rays, concentrated along a certain path, as the
beams of a searchlight are directed. The authorities at Nauen denied
that they had knowledge of anything that could have affected the French
aeroplanes, in ways reported, or supposed. Automobiles can be stopped,
by wireless control, if they be provided with special magnetos:
otherwise not. Sir Oliver Lodge was quoted, by the *Daily Mail*, as
saying that he knew of no rays that could stop a motor, unless specially
equipped. Professor A. M. Low's opinion was that some day distant motors
may be stopped—"I feel confident that, in 50 or 60 years' time, such a
thing will be possible." Prof. Low said that he knew of laboratory
experiments in which, over a distance of two feet, rays of sufficient
power to melt a small coil of wire had been transmitted. But, as to the
reported "accidents" in Germany, Prof.

<span id="page_956">p. 956</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Low said: "There
is a wide difference between transmitting such a power over a distance
of a foot or two, and a distance of one or two thousand yards."

In the *Daily Mail*, April 5, 1924, was an account of invisible rays,
which had been discovered by Mr. H. Grindell-Mathews, powerful enough,
under laboratory conditions, to stop the engine of a motorcycle at a
distance of fifty feet.

Of course high among virtues are the honorable lies of Governments.
Whether virtuously said, or accurately reported, I don't know: but it is
said, or reported, that, in the year 1929, the British Government spent
$500,000 investigating alleged long-distance "death-rays," and developed
nothing that was effective. It is said, or reported, that the Italian
navy gave opportunity to an inventor to demonstrate what he could do
with "death-rays," but that his demonstrations came to nothing. We have
no data for thinking that, in the year 1929, any Government was in
possession of a secret of long-distance "death-rays." The forced
landings of French aeroplanes, in the summer of 1923, remain
unexplained.

There may be powerful rays that are not electromagnetic. French aviators
may have been brought to earth by no power that is called
"physical"—though I know of no real demarcation between what is called
physical and what is called mental. See back to the series of
"mysterious attacks," in England, in April and May, 1927. Three times,
as if acted upon by an unknown influence, automobiles behaved
unaccountably.

Our data are upon "accidents" that have not been satisfactorily
explained. There have been occurrences that were similar to effects that
inventors are, by mechanical means, striving for, in the cause of
military efficiencies. And these experimenters are practical persons. It
may be that we are on the track of a subtler slaughter. It looks as if a
lonely possessor of a secret, such as is called "occult," operated
wantonly, or in the malicious exercise of a power, upon automobiles, in
England, in the months of April and May, 1927. He was a criminal. But I
am a practical thinker, and a useful citizen, on the track of much
efficiency, which will be at the disposal of God's second choice of
people—which I think we must be, judging by the afflictions that are
upon us, at this time of writing—a power

<span id="page_957">p. 957</span>

that would, by this great nation, be used only righteously, if anybody
could ever distinguish between righteousness and exploitation and
tyranny. One of the engaging paradoxes of our existence—which strip
mathematics of meaning—is that a million times a crime is patriotism. I
am unable to conceive that a power to pick planes out of the sky would
be so terrible as to stop war, because up comes the notion that
counter-operations would pick the pickers. If we could have new
abominations, so unmistakably abominable as to hush the lubricators, who
plan murder to stop slaughter—but that is only dreamery, here in our
existence of the hyphen, which is the symbol of hypocrisy.

*New York Times*, Oct. 25, 1930—that about forty automobiles had been
stalled, for an hour, on the road, in Saxony, between Risa and Wurzen.

About forty chauffeurs were probably not voiceless, in this matter; and,
if the German Government were experimenting with "secret rays," that was
some more of its public secrecy. In the Times, October 27, was quoted
the mathematician and former Premier of France, Paul Painlevé—"No
experiment thus far conducted would permit us to credit such a report,
nor give any prospect of seeing it accomplished in the near future."

Upon May 26, 1925—see the *London Daily Mail*, May 28, 1925—at Andover,
Hampshire, England, a corporal of the R.A.F., making a parachute
practice jump, was killed by a fall of 1,900 feet from an aeroplane.
There is not a datum for thinking that there was anything to this
occurrence that aligns it with other occurrences told of in this
chapter. But there is an association. About the time of the accident, or
whatever it was that befell this man, and at the same place, Flight
Sergeant Frank Lowry, and Flying Officer John Kenneth Smith, pilot, were
in an aeroplane, making wireless tests. They had been in the air about
fifteen minutes, when Smith, having called to his companion, without
hearing from him, looked around, and saw smoke coming from the back
cockpit, and saw Lowry in a state of collapse.

Lowry was dead. "Flight-Lieut. Cyril Norman Ellen said that there was
nothing in the machine likely to kill a man, and that

<span id="page_958">p. 958</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lowry must have
come in contact with an electric current in the air. No similar case has
been reported."

In the *Daily Mail*, Oct. 14, 1921, a writer (T. Gifford) tells of a
scene of "accidents," at a point on a road in Dartmoor. This story is
like the account of the series of "accidents" to automobiles, in
England, in April and May, 1927, except that the "accidents" were
strictly localized.

The story told by Gifford is that one day in June, 1921, a doctor,
riding on his motor-cycle, with his two children in a side-car,
suddenly, at this point, on the Dartmoor road, called to the children to
jump. The machine swerved, and the doctor was killed. Several weeks
later, at this place, a motor coach suddenly swerved, and several
passengers were thrown out. Upon Aug. 26, 1924 a Captain M.—for whom I
apologize—it is not often that a Mr. X. or a Captain M. appears in these
records—was, at this point on the road, thrown from his motor-cycle.
Interviewed by Gifford, he told, after evasions, that something
described by him as "invisible hands" had seized upon his hands, forcing
the machine into the turf.

More details were published in the *Daily Mail*, October 17, of this
year. The scene of the "accidents" was on the road, near the Dartmoor
village of Post Bridge. In the first instance, the victim was Dr. E. H.
Helby, Medical Officer of Princetown Prison.

In *Light*, Aug. 26, 1922, a correspondent noted another "accident" at
this point. Details of the fourth "accident" were told, in the London
*Sunday Express*, Sept. 12, 1926. The victim was traveling on his
motor-cycle. "He was suddenly and violently unseated from his mount, and
knew no more until he regained consciousness in a cottage, to which he
had been carried, after a collapse." The injured man could not explain.
