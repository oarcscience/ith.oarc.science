### 28

<span class="smallcaps">Early</span> in October, 1902, vast volumes of
smoke, of unknown origin, obscured all things at sea, and made
navigation difficult and dangerous, from the Philippines to Hongkong,
and from the Philippines to Australia. I do not know of anything of
terrestrial origin that, with equal density, ever has had such
widespread effects. Vesuvius has never been known to smoke up the whole
Mediterranean. Compared with this obscuration, smoke at a distance from
Krakatoa, in August, 1883, was only a haze. For an account, see the
*Jour. Roy. Met. Soc.*, 30-285. *Hongkong Telegraph*, October 25—that a
volcanic eruption in Sumatra had been reported. *Science*, n.s.,
23-193—that there had been no known eruption in Sumatra—that perhaps
there had been enormous forest fires in Borneo and Sumatra. *Sarawak*
(Borneo) *Gazette*, October-November, 1902—no record of any such fires.

There came something that was perhaps not vaster, but that was more
substantial. If a story of a sand storm in a desert is dramatic, here is
a story of a continent that went melodramatic. Upon the 12th of
November, upon all Australia, except Queensland, dust and mud fell from
the sky. Then densest darkness lit up with glares. Fires were falling
from the sky.

Sometimes there are abortive embryos that are mixtures—an eye looking
out from ribs—other features scattered. Fires and dust and darkness—mud
that was falling from the sky—Australia was a womb that was
misconceiving.

A fire ball burst over a mound, which flickered; and frightened sheep
ran from it—or, reflecting glares in the sky, a breast leered, and stuck
out a long, red mob of animals. A furrowed field—or ribs in a haze—and a
stare from the embers of a bush fire. An avenue of trees, heavy with
mud, sagging upon a road that was pulsing with carts—or black lips, far
from jaws, closing soggily upon an umbilical cord, in vainly attempted
suicide.

<span id="page_803">p. 803</span>

Fire balls started up fires in every district in Victoria. They fell
into cities, and set fire to houses. At Wycheproof, "the whole air
seemed on fire." All day of the 12th, and the next day, dust, mostly red
dust, sifted down upon Australia, falling, upon the 13th, in Queensland,
too. Smoke rolled in upon Northern Australia, upon the 14th. A substance
that fell from it was said to be ashes. One of the descriptions is of "a
light, fluffy, grey material" (*Sydney Daily Telegraph*, November 18).

How many of those who have a notion that they're pretty well-read, have
ever heard of this discharge upon Australia? And what are the pretty
well-read but the pretty well-led? Little of this tremendous occurrence
has been told in publications that are said to be scientific, and I take
from Australian newspapers: but accounts of some of the fire balls that
fell from the sky were published in *Nature*, vol. 67. There are reports
from about 50 darkened, stifled towns, in the *Sydney Herald*, of the
14th—"business suspended"—"nothing like it before, in the history of the
colony"—"people stumbling around with lanterns." Traffics were gropes.
Mail coaches reached Sydney, nine hours late. Ashes with a sulphurous
odor fell in New Zealand, upon the 13th (*Otago Witness*, November 19).
The cities into which fell balls of fire that burned houses were Boort,
Allendale, Deniliquin, Langdale, and Chiltern.

Smoke appeared in Java, and the earth quaked. A meteorite fell, at
Kamsagar (Mysore), India. Upon this day of the 12th, a disastrous deluge
started falling, in the Malay States: along one river, seven bridges
were carried away.

There was no investigation. However, passing awareness did glimmer in
one mind, in England. In a dispatch to the newspapers, Dec. 7, 1902, Sir
Norman Lockyer called attention to the similarity between the dust and
the fire balls in Australia, and the dust and the fire balls from
volcanoes in the West Indies, in May, of this year.

Our own expression depends upon whether all this can be attributed to
any eruption upon this earth, or not. The smoke, in October, cannot be
so explained. But was there any particular volcanic activity upon this
earth, about Nov. 12, 1902?

The most violent eruption of Kilauea, Hawaii, in 20 years, was

<span id="page_804">p. 804</span>

occurring, having started upon the 10th of November. There was a geyser
of fire from the volcano Santa Maria, in Guatemala, having started upon
October 26th. About the 6th of November, Colima, in Mexico, began to
discharge dense volumes of smoke. The volcano Savii, in Samoa, broke
out, upon the 13th, having been active, though to no great degree, upon
October 30th. According to a dispatch, dated November 14th, there was an
eruption in the Windward Islands, West Indies. Stromboli burst into
eruption upon the 13th. About this time, Mt. Chullapata, in Peru, broke
out.

But the smoke that appeared, with an earthquake, in Java, was the spans
of an ocean and a continent far away. New Zealand is nearer all these
volcanoes, except Stromboli, than is Australia, but dust and ashes fell
a day later in New Zealand. Fire balls fell enormously in Australia. Not
one was reported in New Zealand. Nothing appeared between New Zealand
and these volcanoes, but dense clouds of smoke, between Australia and
the Philippines, delayed vessels until at least November 10th (*Hobart
Mercury*, November 21). So we regard the unexplained smoke of October
and November, as continuous with the discharges of November 12th, and
relate both, as emanations from one source, which is undiscoverable upon
this earth.

There was a new star.

*Popular Astronomy*, 30-60—that, in October, 1902, a new star appeared
in the southern constellation Puppis.

Upon the 19th of November, a seismic wave, six feet high, crashed upon
the coast of South Australia (*Sydney Morning Herald*, November 20).
Upon this day the new star shone at its maximum of 7th magnitude.

See our expression upon phenomena of August, 1885. If, in November,
1902, a volcanic discharge came to Australia from a southern
constellation, it came as if from a star-region to the nearest
earth-region. But, if constellations be trillions of miles away, no part
of this earth could be appreciably nearer than any other part, to any
star.

So extraordinary was terrestrial, volcanic activity at this time, that
it will have to be considered. Like other expressions, our expression
here is that mutually affective outbursts spread from the

<span id="page_805">p. 805</span>

land of the stars to and through the land of this earth, firing off
volcanoes in the disturbances of one organic and relatively little
whole.

It was a time of extremest drought in Australia. Thunderstorms that
came, after November 12th, were described as terrific.

As a glimmer of awareness, Lockyer told of the fire balls that came with
the dust to Australia, and the suggestion to him was that there had been
a volcanic discharge. But there was something that he did not tell. He
did not know. It was told of in no scientific publication, and it
reached no newspaper published outside Australia. After the first volley
of fire balls, other fire balls came to Australia. I have searched in
newspapers of all continents, and it is my statement that no such fire
balls were reported anywhere else. All were so characterized that it
will be accepted that all were of one stream. Perhaps they came from an
eruption in the constellation Puppis, but my especial expression is
that, if all were of one origin, and if, days apart, they came to this
earth, only to Australia, they so localized, because this earth is
stationary.

For references, see the *Sydney Herald*, and the *Melbourne Leader*.
There was a meteoric explosion, at Parramatta, November 13th. A fire
ball fell and exploded terrifically, at Carcoar. At Murrumburrah, N. S.
W., dust and a large fire ball fell, upon the 18th. A fire ball passed
over the town of Nyngan, night of the 22nd, intensely illuminating sky
and ground. Upon the night of the 20th, as reported by Sir Charles Todd,
of the Adelaide Observatory, a large fire ball was seen, moving so
slowly that it was watched four minutes. At 11 o'clock, night of the
21st, a fire ball of the apparent size of the sun was seen at Towitta.
An hour later, several towns were illuminated by a great fire ball. Upon
the 23rd, a fire ball exploded at Ipswich, Queensland. It is of especial
importance to note the record of one of these bombs, or meteors, that
moved so slowly that it was watched four minutes.

From Feb. 12 to March 1, 1903, dusts and discolored rains fell along the
western coast of Africa, upon many parts of the European Continent, and
in England. The conventional explanation was published: there had been a
whirlwind in Africa.

I have plodded for more than twenty years in the Libraries

<span id="page_806">p. 806</span>

of New York and London. There are millions of persons who would think
this a dreary existence.

But the challenges—the excitements—the finds.

Any pronouncement by any orthodoxy is to me the same as handcuffs. It's
brain cuffs. There are times when I don't give a damn whether the stars
are trillions of miles away or ten miles away—but, at any time, let
anybody say to me, authoritatively, or with an air of finality, that the
stars are trillions of miles away, or ten miles away, and my
contrariness stirs, or inflames, and if I can't pick the lock of his
pronouncements, I'll have to squirm out some way to save my egotism.

So then the dusts of February and March, 1903—and the
whirlwind-explanation—and other egotists will understand how I suffer.
Simply say to me, "Mere dusts from an African desert," and I begin to
squirm like an Houdini.

Feb. 12 to March 1, 1903—"dusts from an African desert."

I get busy.

*Nature*, 75-589—that some of this dust, which had fallen at Cardiff,
Wales, had been analyzed, and that it was probably volcanic.

But the word "analyzed" is an affront to my bigotries—conventional
chemist—orthodox procedures—scientific delusions—more coercions.

I am pleased with a find, in the London *Standard*, Feb. 26, 1903. It is
of no service to me, especially, now, but, in general, it is agreeable
to my malices—a letter from Prof. T. G. Bonney, in which the Professor
says that the dust was not volcanic, because there was no glassy
material in it—and a letter from someone else, stating that in specimens
of the dust that were examined by him, all the particles were glassy.

"It was dust from an African desert."

But I have resources.

One of them is *Al-Moghreb*. How many persons, besides myself, have ever
heard of *Al-Moghreb*? *Al-Moghreb* is mine own discovery.

The dust came down in England, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany,
and along the west coast of Africa. Here's the question:

If there had been an African hurricane so violent as to strew a

<span id="page_807">p. 807</span>

good part of Europe, is it not likely that there would have been
awareness of it in Africa?

*Al-Moghreb* (Tangier)—no mention of any atmospheric disturbance that
would bear out the conventional explanation. *Lagos Weekly
Record*—*Sierra Leone Weekly News*—*Egyptian Gazette*—no mention.

And then one of those finds that make plodding in Libraries as exciting
as prospecting for nuggets—

February 14th, of this year—one of the most extraordinary phenomena in
the history of Australia. In magnitude it was next to the occurrences of
the preceding November. In the blackest of darkness, dust and mud fell
from the sky. *Melbourne Age*, February 16—three columns of reports,
upon darkness and dust and falling mud, in about 40 widespread towns in
New South Wales and Victoria.

The material that fell in Australia fell about as enormously as fell the
dusts in Europe. There is no mention of it in any of the dozens of
articles by conventionalists, upon the phenomena in Europe. It started
falling two days after the first fall of dust, west of Africa. It was
coincidence, or here is an instance of two enormous volumes of dust that
had one origin.

There was an unnoticed hurricane in Africa, which strewed Europe, and
daubed Australia, precipitating nowhere between these two continents; or
two vast volumes of dust were discharged from a disturbance somewhere
beyond this earth, drifting here, arriving so nearly simultaneously that
the indications are that the space between the source and this
stationary earth is not of enormous extent, but was traversed in a few
days, or a few weeks.

There was no known eruption upon this earth, at this time. If here, but
unknown, it would have to be an eruption more tremendous than any of the
known eruptions of this earth.

There was a new star.

It was found, by a professional astronomer, upon photographs of the
constellation Gemini, taken upon March 8th (*Observatory*, 22-245). It
may have existed a few weeks before somebody happened to photograph this
part of the sky.

"Cold-blooded scientists," as we hear them called—and their "ideal

<span id="page_808">p. 808</span>

of accuracy"—they're more like a lot of spoiled brats, willfully
determined to have their own way. In *Cosmos*, n.s., 69-422, were
reported meteoric phenomena, before the destructive earthquake in
Calabria, Italy, Sept. 8, 1905. It was said—or it was "announced"—that
Prof. Agamennone was investigating. It would have been a smash to
conventional science if Prof. Agamennone had confirmed these reports. We
know what to expect. According to the account in *Cosmos*, first came a
fall of meteors, and then, three-quarters of an hour later, to this same
place upon this probably stationary earth, came a great meteor. It
exploded, and in the ground was a shock by which 4,600 buildings were
destroyed, and 4,000 persons were killed.

A volume of sound from crashing walls, in billows of roars from falling
roofs, sailed like a ship in a storm. When it sank, lamentations leaped
from it.

Because of underlying oneness, the sounds of a catastrophe are
renderable in the terms of any other field of phenomena. Structural
principles are the same, either in phonetic or biologic anatomy. A woe,
or an insect, or a centipede is a series of segments.

Or the wreck of a city was a cemetery. Convulsed into animation, it was
Resurrection Day, as not conceived of by religionists. Concatenations of
sounds arose from burials. Spinal columns of groans were exhuming from
ruination. Articulations of sobs clung to them. A shout that was jointed
with oaths reached out from a hole. A church, which for centuries had
been the den of a parasite, sank to a heap. It was a maw that engulfed a
congregation. From it came the chant of a litany that was a tapeworm
emerging from a ruptured stomach.

Choruses broke into moans that were rows of weeping willows. A prayer
crossed a field of murmurs, and was gored by a blasphemy. Tellers of
beads told ladders, up which ran profanities. Then came submergence
again, in a chorus.

In earthquake lands, it is the belief of the people that there is a
godness that, at times of catastrophes, directs them to flock to
churches. My own theology is in agreement. It is by such concentrations
that the elimination of surplusages is facilitated. But, if

<span id="page_809">p. 809</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Virgin Marys were
replaced by images of Mrs. Sanger, there would be no such useful
murders.

It is said, in the *Bull. Soc. Astro. de France*, October, 1905, that
luminous phenomena had preceded this catastrophe, in Calabria.
Observations upon appearances in the sky were gathered by Prof. Alfani,
and were recorded by him, in the *Revista di Fisca*. But it was Prof.
Agamennone's decision upon reported phenomena in the sky that was
awaited by the scientific world. From time to time, in scientific
periodicals, there was something to the effect that he was
investigating.

Not only meteors were told of. There was a fall of dust, from the sky,
at Tiriolo.

Explained.

There had been an eruption of Stromboli.

*Comptes Rendus*, 141-576—report by M. Lacroix, who had been living near
Stromboli, at the time—that, at this time of the fall of dust, there had
been no more than normal activity of Stromboli.

Long afterward, the result of Prof. Agamennone's investigation was
published. He could find only one witness.

It is not easy to think of an organic control that would beguile its
human supernumeraries into manageable concentrations, for eliminative
purposes, and also permit a Prof. Agamennone to conceive of warnings for
them. But, if in super-metabolism, there is, as in sub-organisms, the
katabolism of destructions, also there are restorations. Anabolic
vibrations, known to the people of this earth, as "sympathy" and
"charity," shook from pockets as far away as California, money that
rebuilt the mutilated tissues of Italy.

Something else that every conventionalist will explain as "mere
coincidence" is that down from the sky came deluges upon the quaking
land of Calabria. There was widespread need for water, at this time.

India—"pitiable," as described in accounts of one of the severest of
droughts. The wilt of a province—the ebb of its life is at the rate of
2,000 of its starving inhabitants, a day, into the town of Sind. Its
people shrivel, and its fields, burned brown, wrinkle with trains of
dark-skinned refugees. A band of natives in a desolate copse—trunks and
limbs of leafless, little trees, and shrunken arms and legs merge

<span id="page_810">p. 810</span>

in one jungle of emaciation. A starving native, flat in a field—he has
crawled away from the long, white cloud of dust of a trampled road. It
might be hell anywhere, but there are glimpses of the especial hell that
is India. Breech-clout of the starving native—pinned to it, a string of
jewels, which, though dying, he had stolen. Long, wide cloud of dust
that is a landscape-girdle—and it is emblazoned with a rajah's
elephants.

There was intense suffering, at Lahore. All the gods were prayed to for
rain.

Upon the 9th of September, there was an earthquake, at Lahore. All the
gods answered at once, combining their deliveries, with an efficiency
that smashed houses. *Allahabad Pioneer Mail*, September 15—"houses
collapsing in great numbers, and the occupants wandering homeless."
"Such an occurrence at this season is most unprecedented, and has taken
everybody by surprise" (*Times of India*, September 16).

Main Street—any good-sized American city—a dull afternoon—the barber
shop and the cigar store on the corner—much dullness—

A sudden frenzy—Main Street rushes out of the town.

Or a human mind in a monotonous state of smugness—there's a temptation,
or the smash of a conviction, and something that it has taken for a
principle rushes out of it, in a torrent of broken beliefs—

That delirium, or frenzy—or anything else mental or human—is not
exclusively mental or human—but just what are my data for thinking that
the principal street of an American city ever did rush out of the town?

Well, something similar. It was at the time of the deluges in India.
There was a monstrous fall of water in Kashmir.

Many of the inhabitants of the city of Srinagar, Kashmir, lived in rows
of houseboats, upon the river Jhelum, a sluggish, muddy stream, with so
little visible motion that, between the rows, it looked like a smooth
pavement. It suddenly went up 17 feet. The two long rows of houseboats
rushed away.

Another river in Kashmir smashed a village. On its banks it left
parallel confusions.

Notch a butterfly's wings—this is mutilation. But correspondingly notch
the other wing, and there is balance. Two mutilations may be

<span id="page_811">p. 811</span>

harmony. The doubly hideous may be beautiful. If, on both sides of the
river that was a subsiding axis, mothers simultaneously screamed over
the bodies of children, this correspondence was the soul of design. Two
anguishes, neatly balanced in parallel lines of wreckage, satisfy the
requirements of those who worship godness as only harmony.

A quaking zone of Europe and Asia was deluged. Drought in
Turkey—earthquakes—plentiful rain (*Levant Herald*, September 1i, 18).
Tremendous falls of water and shocks were continuing in Calabria. Spain
was flooded.

September 27th—another severe shock, at Lahore; and, this day, again
dust, of unknown origin, fell from the sky, in Calabria. A current of
hot air came with it. According to the *Levant Herald*, October 9, many
persons were asphyxiated. According to description, it was a volcanic
blast that cannot be traced to origin upon this earth. If it came from
somewhere beyond this earth, such a repetition in Calabria is a
coincidence, or is an indication that this earth is stationary. It is
easier to call it a coincidence.

There was a new star.

Upon the night of August 18th, an "auroral" beam, such as has often been
seen in the sky, at times of volcanic eruptions upon this earth, and at
times of new stars, was seen in England (*English Mechanic*, 82-88).
Upon the gist of August, Mrs. Fleming, at Harvard University
Observatory, looking over photographic plates, saw that a new star had
been recorded, on and after the 18th. The new star, diminishing,
continued to shine during September.

Our expression upon "auroral" beams is that vast beams of light have
often been seen in the sky, at times when terrestrial volcanoes were
active; that similar appearances have been seen at times of new stars,
and may be considered light-effects of volcanoes, not terrestrial. For
records of several of these beams, one while Stromboli was violent,
Sept. 1, 1891, and one, July 16, 1892, while one of the greatest
eruptions of Etna was occurring, see *Nature*, vols. 44 and 45, and
*Popular Astronomy*, 10-249. For one of the latest instances, see
newspapers, April 16, 1926: while Mauna Loa, Hawaii, was in eruption, a
beam of light was seen in Nebraska.

There's a new light in the heavens, and there's a disturbance upon

<span id="page_812">p. 812</span>

this earth, as if an interaction that could not occur, if trillions of
miles intervene.

"Mere coincidence."

There's a quake in Formosa, and there's a quake in California.

"Only coincidence," say the conventionalists, who are committed to local
explanations.

April 18, 1906—the destruction of San Francisco. The Governor of
California appointed a commission of eight Professors to investigate the
catastrophe. The eight Professors ignored, as coincidence, everything
else that had occurred at the time, and explained in the usual, local,
geological terms. In *Nature*, 73-608, is published Dr. Charles
Davison's explanation, which is in terms of a local subsidence. Dr.
Davison mentions nothing else that occurred at the time.

At the time—a disastrous quake in Formosa, and the most violent eruption
of Vesuvius since April, 1872; activity in a long-dormant volcano in the
Canary Islands; quake in Alberta, Canada; sudden rise and fall of Lake
Geneva, Switzerland; eruption of Mt. Asama, Japan.

See back to the occurrence of St. Pierre, Martinique. May, 1902—30,000
persons, who perished properly—blackened into cinders, with academic
sanction. They turned into ashes, but the principles of an orthodoxy
were upheld.

January, 1907—and the ignoramuses of Jamaica. They saved their own
lives, because they did not know better.

About 3 o'clock, afternoon of Jan. 14, 1907, there was sudden darkness,
at Kingston, Jamaica. People cried to one another that an earthquake was
coming, and many of them ran to parks and other open spaces. The
earthquake came. The people who ran to the open spaces lived, but a
thousand of the others were killed by falling houses.

A web that was spun of dogmas caught a thousand victims. After the
quake, the ruins of Kingston sprawled like a spider, stretching out
long, black lines that were trains of hearses. But all who ran to the
parks, believing that appearances in the sky did mean that catastrophe
upon earth was coming, lived. I have given data for thinking that a De
Ballore, or any other conventionalist, would ridicule these people for
so interpreting "a mere coincidence."

<span id="page_813">p. 813</span>

October, 1907, and March, 1908—falls, from the sky, of substances like
soot and ashes—catastrophes upon this earth and new stars that were
discovered by amateurs. See the *English Mechanic*, 86-237, 260, and the
*Observatory*, 31-215.

Dec. 30, 1910—new star—disastrous earthquakes—an enormous fall, from the
sky, of a substance like ashes. The new star, *Nova Lacertae*, was
discovered by Dr. Espin, a professional astronomer. Photographic records
were looked up. Almost six weeks this star had been shining, unobserved
at this earth's Observatories. It was visible without a telescope (5th
magnitude).

For almost six weeks, a new star had shone over the Observatories of
this earth, and no milkman had reported it. However, without chagrin, we
note this remissness, because it is no purpose of this book to spout
eulogies to the amateur in science. It is only in astronomy that the
humiliation of professionals by amateurs is common. I have no records of
little boys running into laboratories, startling professors of
chemistry, or physics, with important discoveries. The achievements of
amateurs in astronomy rank about with a giving of information, upon
current events, to a Rip Van Winkle. I'll not apologize, because no
night watchman hammered for several hours upon the front door of an
Observatory, rudely disturbing the spiders.
