<span class="small">It is not exclusively anywhere where anything is, if
ours is one organic existence, in which all things are continuous.--p.
769.</span>

<span class="small">I suspect that, in other worlds, or in other parts
of one existence, there is esoteric knowledge of the human beings of
this earth, kept back from common knowledge... There have been
suggestions of an occult control upon the minds of the inhabitants of
this earth. Let anybody who does not like the idea that his mind may be
most subtly controlled, without his knowledge of it, think back to what
propagandists did with his beliefs in the years 1914-18...--p.
617</span>

In Lo!, Fort develops a theme of teleportation as an agency for many
strange phenomena. He reviews the cases of the *Marie Celeste*, Princess
Caraboo, Cagliostro, Ambrose Bierce, Agatha Christie, and Kaspar Hauser
as evidence that people can be mysteriously teleported from one point to
another. The main side effect of these accidental teleportations seems
to be amnesia, in fact it is the *sine qua non* of the better examples.

Fort continues to tweak scientific pomposity, focusing on astronomers.
While astronomy bills itself as an exact science, even today, with
digital computers, calculations can go awry, often because of human
error and the limits of our mathematical models. A Mars probe was lost
because one software component was using English measurements instead of
metric. While multi-body systems can now be simulated digitally using
iterative methods, eventually chaos creeps in and makes predicting
future locations of planets impossible. Fort uses this Achilles heel to
advance his own modest cosmological proposal, of a shell of land just a
few dozen miles up, with the stars as volcanoes...

Taken at face value, of course, he is dead wrong--even the builders of
Stonehenge would have turned up their noses at this concept. However,
Fort was vindicated in many large and small ways here. He predicted the
space race, and how space travel would someday become commercialized and
routine. His sense that the universe has a lot of strange components
that early 20th century science had no concept of, was also prescient.
Today, we might use parallel universes to explain many of these
phenomena. In fact, some mainstream theories of physics demand the
existence of such universes. In fact, some of these universes may be
separated from ours by the spatial equivalent of millimeters. Somewhere,
I think, Mr. Fort is a bit less grumpy...
