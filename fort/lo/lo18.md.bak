### 18

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> was the case of Mrs. Guppy, June 3,
1871, for instance. As the spiritualists tell it, she shot from her
home, in London. Several miles away, she flopped down through a ceiling.
Mrs. Guppy weighed 200 pounds. But Mrs. Guppy was a medium. She was a
prominent medium, and was well-investigated, and was, or therefore was,
caught playing tricks, several times. I prefer to look elsewhere for
yarns, or veritable accounts.

In the *New York World*, March 25, 1883, is told a story of a girl, the
daughter of Jesse Miller, of Greenville Township, Somerset Co., Pa., who
was transported several times, out of the house, into the front yard.
But it was her belief that apparitions were around, and most of our data
are not concerned with ghostly appearances.

As told in the *Cambrian Daily Leader* (Swansea, Wales), July 7, 1887,
poltergeist phenomena were occurring in the home of the Rev. David
Phillips, of Swansea. Sometime I am going to try to find out why so many
of these disturbances have occurred in the homes of clergymen. Why have
so many supposed spirits of the departed tormented clergymen? Perhaps
going to heaven makes people atheists. However, I do not know that
poltergeists can be considered spirits. It may be that many of our
records—see phenomena

<span id="page_694">p. 694</span>

of the winter of 1904-5—relate not to occult beings, as independent
creatures, but to projected mentalities of living human beings. A woman
of Mr. Phillips’ household had been transported over a wall, and toward
a brook, where she arrived in a "semiconscious condition." I note that,
not in agreement with our notions upon teleportation, it was this
woman's belief that an apparition had carried her. Mr. Phillips and his
son, a Cambridge graduate, who had probably been brought up to believe
in nothing of the kind, asserted that this transportation had occurred.

A great deal has been written upon the phenomena, or the alleged
phenomena, of the Pansini boys. Their story is told in the *Occult
Review*, 4-17. These boys, one aged seven, and the other aged eight,
were sons of Mauro Pansini, an architect, of Bari, Italy. Their
experiences, or their alleged experiences, began in the year 1901. "One
day Alfredo and his brother were at Ruvo, at 9 A.M., and at 9:30 A.M.,
they were found in the Capuchin Convent, at Malfatti, thirty miles
away." In the *Annals of Psychic Science*, it is said that, about the
last of January, 1901, the Pansini boys were transported from Ruvo to a
relative's house, in Trani, arriving in a state of profound hypnosis. In
volumes 2 and 3, of the *Annals*, a discussion of these boys continues.

But I haven't told the damnedest. Oh, well, we'll have the damnedest. A
Mediterranean harbor—a man in a boat—and, like Mrs. Guppy, down the
Pansini boys flop into his boat.

Into many minds flops this idea—"It isn't so much the preposterousness
of this story alone: but, if we'd accept this, what else that would
threaten all conventional teachings, would we be led into?"

I can't help arguing. I have cut down smoking some, and our home brew
goes flat so often that at times I have gone without much of that, but I
can't stop arguing. It has no meaning, but I argue that much that is
commonplace today was once upon a time denounced from pulpits as the way
to hell. For all I know, a couple of kids flopped into a boat. I don't
feel hellish about it. The one thought that I do so little to develop is
that if there be something that did switch the Pansini boys from place
to place, it may be put to work, and instead of wharves and railroad
stations, there may be built departing and receiving points for
commodities, which may

<span id="page_695">p. 695</span>

be "wished," as it were, from California to London. Let stockholders of
transportation companies get ahold of this idea, and, if I'm not
satisfied with having merely science and religion against me, I'll have
opposition enough to suit anybody who can get along without popularity.
Just at present, however, I am not selling short on New York Central.

Has anybody, walking along a street, casually looking at someone ahead
of him, ever seen a human being vanish? It is a common experience to
think that one has seen something like this occur. Another common
experience, which has been theorized upon by James and other
psychologists, is to be somewhere and have an uncanny feeling that,
though so far as one knows, one was never there before, one,
nevertheless, was at some time there. It may be that many persons have
been teleported back and forth, without knowing it, or without having
more than the dimmest impression of the experience.

But about walking along a street, and having a feeling that somebody has
vanished—there have been definitely reported observations upon
disappearances. In these instances, the explanation has been that
someone had seen a ghost, and that the ghost had vanished. We shall have
accounts that look as if observers have seen, not ghosts, but beings
like themselves, vanish.

In the *Jour. Soc. Psychical Research*, 11-189, is published a story by
a painter, named John Osborne, living at 5 Hurst Street, Oxford,
England. He said that, about the last of March, 1895, he was walking
along a road to Wolverton, when he heard sounds of a horse's hoofs
behind him, and, turning, saw a man on horseback, having difficulty in
controlling his horse. He scurried out of the way, and, when safe,
looked again. Horse and man had vanished. Then came the
conventionalization, even though it would be widely regarded as an
unorthodox conventionalization. It was said that, the week before, a man
on horseback had been killed in this part of the road, and that the
horse, badly injured, had been shot. Usually there is no use searching
for anything further in a publication in which a conventionalization has
appeared, but this instance is an exception. In the June number of the
*Journal*, there is a correction: it is said that the accident with
which this disappearance had been associated,

<span id="page_696">p. 696</span>

had not occurred a week before, but years before, and was altogether
different, having been an accident to a farmer in a hayfield. Several
persons investigated, among them a magistrate, who wrote that he was
convinced at least that Osborne thought that he had seen the "figures"
disappear.

Well, then, why didn't I get a Wolverton newspaper, and even though it
would be called "a mere coincidence" find noted the disappearance of
somebody who had been last seen on horseback? I forget now why I did
not, but I think it was because no Wolverton newspaper was obtainable. I
haven't the item, but with all our experience with explanations, I
should have the knack, myself, by this time. I think of a man on
horseback, who was suddenly transported, but only a few miles. If, when
he got back, he was a wise man on horseback, he got off the back of his
horse and said nothing about this. Our general notion is that he would
have been unconscious of the experience. Perhaps, if Osborne had
lingered, he would have seen this man and his horse re-appear.

In the *Jour. S. P. R.*, 4-50, is a story of a young woman, who was more
than casually looked at, near the foot of Milton Hill, Massachusetts.
She vanished. She was seen several times. So this is a story of a place
that was "haunted," and the "figure" was supposed to be a ghost. For a
wonder there was no story of a murder that was committed, years before,
near this hill. For all I know, some young woman, living in Boston, New
York, some distant place, may have had teleportative affinity with an
appearing-point, or terminal of an occult current, at this hill, having
been translated back and forth several times, without knowing it, or
without being able to remember, or remembering dimly, thinking that it
was a dream. Perhaps, sometime happening to pass this hill, by more
commonplace means of transportation, she would have a sense of uncanny
familiarity, but would be unable to explain, having no active
consciousness of having ever been there before. Psychologists have noted
the phenomenon of a repeating scene in different dreams, or supposed
dreams. The phenomenon may not be of fancifulness, but of dim
impressions of teleportations to one persisting appearing-point. A
naïve, little idea of mine is that so many ghosts in white garments have
been reported,

<span id="page_697">p. 697</span>

because persons, while asleep, have been teleported in their
nightclothes.

In *Real Ghost Stories*, published by the *Review of Reviews* (English),
a correspondent tells of having seen a woman in a field, vanish. Like
others who have had this experience, he does not say that he saw a woman
vanish, but that he saw "a figure of a woman" vanish. He inquired for
some occurrence by which to explain, and learned that somewhere in the
neighborhood a woman had been murdered, and that her "figure" had
haunted the place. In the *Proc. S. P. R.*, 10-98, someone tells of
having walked, with her father, upon a sandy place, near Aldershot,
hearing footsteps, turning, seeing a soldier. The footsteps suddenly
ceased to be heard. She turned again to look. The soldier had vanished.
This correspondent writes that her father never would believe anything
except that it was "a real soldier, who somehow got away." In the
*Occult Review*, 23-168, a correspondent writes that, while walking in a
street in Twickenham, he saw, walking toward him, "a figure of a man."
The "figure" turned and vanished, or "disappeared through a garden
wall." This correspondent failed to learn of a murder that had been
committed in the neighborhood, but, influenced by the familiar
convention, mentions that there was an old dueling ground nearby.

The most circumstantial of the stories appears in the *Jour. S. P. R.*,
November, 1893. Miss M. Scott writes that, upon the afternoon of the 7th
of May, 1893, between five and six o'clock, she was walking upon a road,
near St. Boswells (Roxburghshire) when she saw ahead of her a tall man,
who, dressed in black, looked like a clergyman. There is no assertion
that this "figure" looked ghostly, and there is a little circumstance
that indicates that the "figure," or the living being, was looked at
more than casually. Having considerable distance to go, Miss Scott
started to run: but it occurred to her that it would not be dignified to
run past this stranger: so she stood still, to let the distance
increase. She saw the clerical-looking man turn a corner of the road,
the upper part of his body visible above a low hedge—"he was gone in an
instant." Not far beyond this vanishing point, Miss Scott met her
sister, who was standing in the road, looking about her in bewilderment,
exclaiming that she had seen a man disappear, while she was looking at
him.

<span id="page_698">p. 698</span>

One of our present thoughts is that teleportations, back and forth,
often occur. There are many records, some of which may not be yarns, or
may not be altogether yarns, of persons who have been seen far from
where, so far as those persons, themselves, knew, they were, at the
time. See instances in Gurney's *Phantasms of the Living*. The idea is
that human beings have been switched away somewhere, and soon switched
back, and have been seen, away somewhere, and have been explained to the
perceivers, as their own hallucinations.

It may be that I can record a case of a man who was about to disappear,
but was dragged back, in time, from a disappearing point. I think of the
children of Clavaux, who were about to be taken into a vortex, but were
dragged back by their parents, who were not susceptible. Data look as if
there may have been a transporting current through so-called solid
substance, which "opened" and then "closed," with no sign of a yawning.
It may be that what we call substance is as much open as closed. I
accept, myself, that there is only relative substance, so far as the
phenomenal is concerned: so I can't take much interest in what the
physicists are doing, trying to find out what mere phenomenal substance
really, or finally, is. It isn't, or it is intermediate to existence and
nonexistence. If there is an organic existence that is more than
relative, though not absolute, it may be The Substantial, but its iron
and lead, and gold are only phenomenal. The greatest seeming security is
only a temporary disguise of the abysmal. All of us are skating over
thin existence.

Early in the morning of Dec. 9, 1873, Thomas B. Cumpston and his wife,
"who occupied good positions in Leeds," were arrested in a railroad
station, in Bristol, England, charged with disorderly conduct, both of
them in their nightclothes, Cumpston having fired a pistol. See the
London *Times*, Dec. 11, 1873. Cumpston excitedly told that he and his
wife had arrived the day before, from Leeds, and had taken a room in a
Bristol hotel, and that, early in the morning, the floor had "opened,"
and that, as he was about to be dragged into the "opening," his wife had
saved him, both of them so terrified that they had jumped out the
window, running to the railroad station, looking for a policeman. In the
*Bristol Daily Post*,

<span id="page_699">p. 699</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> December 10, is an
account of proceedings in the police court. Cumpston's excitement was
still so intense that he could not clearly express himself. Mrs.
Cumpston testified that, early in the evening, both of them had been
alarmed by loud sounds, but that they had been reassured by the
landlady. At three or four in the morning the sounds were heard again.
They jumped out on the floor, which was felt giving away under them.
Voices repeating their exclamations were heard, or their own voices
echoed strangely. Then, according to what she saw, or thought she saw,
the floor opened wide. Her husband was falling into this "opening" when
she dragged him back.

The landlady was called, and she testified that sounds had been heard,
but she was unable clearly to describe them. Policemen said that they
had gone to the place, the Victoria Hotel, and had examined the room,
finding nothing to justify the extraordinary conduct of the Cumpstons.
They suggested that the matter was a case of collective hallucination. I
note that there was no suggestion of intoxication. The Cumpstons, an
elderly couple, were discharged in the custody of somebody who had come
from Leeds.

*Collective hallucination* is another of the dismissal-labels by which
conventionalists shirk thinking. Here is another illustration of the
lack of standards, in phenomenal existence, by which to judge anything.
One man's story, if not to the liking of conventionalists, is not
accepted, because it is not supported: and then testimony by more than
one is not accepted, if undesirable, because that is collective
hallucination. In this kind of jurisprudence, there is no hope for any
kind of testimony against the beliefs in which conventional scientists
agree. Among their amusing disregards is that of overlooking that, quite
as truly may their own agreements be collective delusions.

The loud sounds in the Cumpston case suggest something of correlation
with poltergeist phenomena. Spiritualists have persistently called
poltergeist-sounds "raps." Sometimes they are raps, but often they are
detonations that shake buildings. People up and down a street have been
kept awake by them. Maybe existences open and shut noisily. From my own
experience I don't know that there ever

<span id="page_700">p. 700</span>

has been a poltergeist. At least, I have had only one experience, and
that is explainable several ways. But what would be the use of writing a
book about things that we think we're sure of?—unless, like a good deal
in this book, to show the dooce we are.

In the *Sunday Express*, (London), Dec. 5, 1926, Lieut.-Colonel Foley
tells of an occurrence that resembles the Cumpstons’ experience. A room
in Corpus Christi College (Cambridge University) was, in October; 1904,
said to be haunted. Four students, of whom Shane Leslie, the writer, was
one, investigated. Largely the story is of an invisible, but tangible,
thing, or being, which sometimes became dimly visible, inhabiting, or
visiting, this room. The four students went into the room, and one of
them was dragged away from the others. His companions grabbed him. "Like
some powerful magnet" something was drawing him out of their grasp. They
pulled against it, and fought in a frenzy, and they won the tug. Other
students, outside the room, were shouting. Undergraduates came running
down the stairs, and, crowding into the room, wrecked it, even tearing
out the oak paneling. Appended to the story, in the *Sunday Express*, is
a statement by Mr. Leslie—"Colonel Foley has given an accurate account
of the occurrence."
