# PART III

### 24

<span class="smallcaps">Emissions</span> of arms—the bubbling of faces,
at crevices—fire and smoke and a lava of naked beings. Out from a
crater, discharges of bare bodies boiled into fantastic formations—

Or—five o'clock, morning of Dec. 28, 1908—violent shocks in Sicily. The
city of Messina fell in a heap, which caught fire. It is the custom of
Sicilians to sleep without nightclothes, and from this crater of blazing
wreckage came an eruption of naked beings. Thick clouds of them scudded
into thin vapors.

The earth quaked, at Messina, and torrential rains fell. According to
*Nature*, Dec. 31, 1908, a fall of meteorites had been reported in
Spain, a few days before the quake. According to the wisemen of our more
or less savage tribes, the deluge at Messina, at the time of this quake,
fell only by coincidence. No wiseman would mention the fall of
meteorites, as having any relation.

There were, at the time, world-wide disturbances, or rather,
disturbances, along a zone of this earth—Asia Minor, Greece, Sicily,
Spain, Canary Islands, Mexico. But all wisemen who wrote upon this
subject clipped off everything else, and wrote that there had been a
subsidence of land in Sicily. It is the same old local explanation.
Scientists and priests are unlike in some respects, but they are about
equally parochial.

Dec. 3, 1887—from a plinth of ruins, an obelisk of woe sounded to the
sky.

It was at Roggiano, Italy. 900 houses were thrown down by an earthquake.
The wail that went up from the ruins continued long before individual
cries could be distinguished. Then the column of woe shattered into
screams and prayers.

The survivors said that they had seen fires in the heavens. In *Cosmos*,
n. s., 69-422, we are told that Prof. Agamennone had investigated

<span id="page_766">p. 766</span>

these reported celestial blazes. But they were new lights upon old
explanations. A blazing sky could have nothing to do with a local,
geological disturbance. The orthodox explanation was that a stratum of
rocks had slipped. What could the slip of rocks have to do with
sky-fires? We are told that the Professor had reduced all alleged
witnesses of the blaze in the heavens to one, who had told about it,
"with little seriousness." What had suggested levity to him, as to
scenes of ruination and slaughter, was not enquired into: but the story
is recorded as a jest, and it may be all the more subtle, because the
fun of it is not obvious.

About 6 A.M., Feb. 23, 1887, at Genoa, Italy, burst a dam of
conventional securities. There was a flood of human beings. An
earthquake cast thousands of people into the streets. The sky was afire.
There was a pour to get out of town. It was a rush in a glare. If, at
the time of a forest fire, a dam should burst, thousands of logs,
leaping red in the glare, would be like this torrent of human forms
under a fiery sky. In other places along the Riviera, the quake was
severe. At other places was made this statement that orthodox science
will not admit—that the sky was afire. See Pop. Sci. News, 21-58. It
will not be admitted, or it is said to be merely a coincidence. See
*L’Astronomie*, 1887, p. 137—that at Apt (Vaucluse) a fiery appearance
had been seen, and that then had come a great light, like a Bengal
fire—"without doubt coincidences."

The 16th of August, 1906—and suddenly people, living along the road to
Valparaiso, Chile, lost sight of the city. There had come "a terrible
darkness." With it came an earthquake. The splitting of ground, and the
roar of falling houses—intensest darkness—and then a voice in this
chaos. It was a scream. People along the road heard it approaching.

Chile lit up. Under a flaming sky, the people of Valparaiso were running
from the smashing city—people as red as flames, under the glare in the
heavens: screaming and falling, and leaping over the bodies of the
fallen—an eruption of spurting forms that leaped and were extinguished.
This reddened gush from Valparaiso—rising, falling shapes—brief faces
and momentary arms—it was like looking at vast flames and imagining that
spurts of them were really living beings.

<span id="page_767">p. 767</span>

In *Nature*, 90-550, it is said that 136 reports upon illuminations in
the sky, at Valparaiso, had been examined by Count de Ballore,
[the](errata.htm#2.md) seismologist. At one stroke, he bobbed off 98 of
them, saying that they were indefinite. He said that the remaining 38
reports were more or less explicit, but came from a region where at the
time, a deluge was falling. He clipped these, too. For a wonder there
was an objection: a writer in the *Scientific American*, 107-67, pointed
out that De Ballore so dismissed the subject, without enquiring into the
possibility that the quake and the deluge were related.

Had he admitted the possibility of relationship, dogma would have
slipped upon dogma, and upon the face of this earth there would have
been a subsidence of some ignorance.

"The lights that were seen in the sky," said De Ballore, "were very
likely only searchlights from warships."

"The whole sky seemed afire" (*Scientific American*, 106-464). In
*Symons’ Met. Mag.*, 41-226, William Gaw, of Santiago, describing the
blazing heavens, writes that it seemed as if the sober laws of physics
had revolted.

"Or," said De Ballore, "the people may have seen lights from tram cars."

It does not matter how preposterous some of my own notions are going to
seem. They cannot be more out of accordance with events upon this earth
than is such an attribution of the blazing sky of a nation to
searchlights or to lamps in tram cars. If I should write that the stars
are probably between forty and fifty miles away, I'd be not much more of
a trimmer of circumstances than is such a barber, whose clips are said
to be scientific. Maybe they are scientific. Though, mostly, barbers are
artists, some of them do consider themselves scientific.

Upon July 11th, 1856, the sun rose red in the Caucasus. See *Lloyd's
Weekly News*paper (London), Sept. 21, 1856. At five o'clock in the
afternoon, at places where the sun was still shining red, there was an
earthquake that destroyed 300 houses. There was another quake, upon the
23rd of July. Two days later, black water fell from the sky, in Ireland
(*News of the World*, Aug. 10, 1856).

And what has any part of that to do with any other part of that? If a
red-haired girl, or a red shirt on a clothesline, had been noted

<span id="page_768">p. 768</span>

here, there would be, according to orthodox science, no more relation
with earthquakes than there could be between a red sun and an
earthquake. Black water falling in Ireland—somebody spilling ink in
Kansas.

The moon turned green.

For two observations upon a green moon that was seen at a place where an
earthquake was going to occur, see the *Englishman* (Calcutta), July 14
and 21, 1897. One of the observations was six days before, and the other
one day before, the quake in Assam, June 12, 1897. It was a time of
drought and famine, in India.

The seismologist knows of no relation between a green moon, or a red
sun, and an earthquake, but the vulcanologist knows of many instances in
which the moon and the sun have been so colored by the volcanic dusts
and smokes that are known as "dry fogs." The look is that "dry fogs,"
from a volcanic eruption, came to the sky of India, one of them six days
before, and the other one day before, a catastrophe.

The mystery is this:

If there had been a volcanic eruption somewhere else, why not volcanic
appearances in Italy, or Patagonia, or California—why at this place
where an earthquake was going to occur?

Coincidence.

Upon the 11th of June, in Upper Assam, where, upon the 12th, the center
of the earthquake was going to be, torrents fell suddenly from the sky.
A correspondent to the *Englishman*, July 14, writes that this deluge
was of a monstrousness that exceeded that of any other downpour that he
had ever seen in Assam, or anywhere else.

At 5:15 P.M., 12th of June, there was a sight at Shillong that would be
a marvel to the more innocent of the text-book writers. I tell so much
of clipping and bobbing and shearing, but also there may be considerable
innocence. Not a cloud in the sky—out of clear, blue vacancy, dumped a
lake. This drop of a bulk of water, or transportation, or teleportation,
of it, was at the time of one of the most catastrophic of earthquakes,
centering farther north in Assam.

This earthquake was an earthstorm. Hills were waves, and houses cast
adrift were wrecked on them. Out into fields stormed people from
villages, and long strings of them, in white summer garments,

<span id="page_769">p. 769</span>

were lines of surf on the earthwaves. Breakers of them spumed with
infants. In a human storm, billows of people crashed against islands of
cattle. It is not only in meteorology that there are meteorological
occurrences. The convulsions were so violent that there was
scene-shifting. When the people recovered and looked around, it was at
landscapes, changed as if a curtain had gone down and then up, between
acts of this drama. They saw fields, lakes, and roads that, in the lay
of the land, before the quake, had been hidden. It is not only in
playhouses that there are theatrical performances. It is not exclusively
anywhere where anything is, if ours is one organic existence, in which
all things are continuous.

There were more deluges that will not fit into conventional
explanations. *Allahabad Pioneer*, June 23, 1897—extremest droughts—the
quake—enormous falls of water.

There are data for thinking that somewhere there was a volcanic
eruption. Another datum is that, at Calcutta, after the earthquake,
there was an "afterglow." "Afterglows" are exceptional sunsets,
sometimes of an auroral appearance, which are reflections of sunlight
from volcanic dust high in the sky, continuing to be seen an hour or so
later than ordinary sunsets. *Friend of India*, June 15—"The entire west
was a glory of deepest purple, and the colors did not fade out, until an
hour after darkness is usually complete."

Something else that I note is that in many places in Assam, the ground
was incipiently volcanic, during the earthquake. Countless small craters
appeared and threw out ashes.

Considering the volcanic and the incipiently volcanic, I think of a
relation between the catastrophe in Assam and a volcanic eruption
somewhere else.

But there is findable no record of a volcanic eruption upon this earth
to which could be attributed effects that we have noted.

I point out again that, if there were a volcanic eruption in some part
of our existence, external to this earth, or upon this earth, it would,
unless a special relation be thought of, be as likely to cause an
"afterglow" in England or South Africa, as in India. The suggestion is
that somewhere, external to this earth, if in terrestrial terms there is
no explanation, there was a volcanic eruption, and that the earthquake
in India was a response to it, and that bulks

<span id="page_770">p. 770</span>

of water and other discharges came from somewhere else exclusively to a
part of this earth that was responsively, or functionally, quaking,
because a teleportative current of some kind, very likely electric,
existed between the two centers of disturbances.

Upon the 25th of June, dust fell from the sky, near Calcutta (*The
Englishman*, July 3). In the issue of this newspaper, of July 14th, a
meteorologist, employed in the Calcutta Observatory, described "a most
peculiar mist," like volcanic smoke, which had been seen in the
earthquake-regions. In his opinion it was "cosmic dust," or dust that
had fallen to this earth from outer space. He said nothing of possible
relationship with the earthquakes. He would probably have called it
"mere coincidence." Then he told of a fall of mud, upon the 27th of
June, at Thurgrain (Midnapur). There was a fall of mud, in the Jessore
District of Bengal, night of June-29th. "It fell from a cloudless sky,
while the stars were shining" (*Madras Mail*, July 8).

Suppose it were "cosmic dust." Suppose with the conventionalists that
this earth is a swiftly moving planet that had overtaken a cloud of
"cosmic dust," in outer space. In one minute, this earth would be more
than one thousand miles away from this point of contact, by orbital
motion, and would turn away axially.

But other falls of dust came upon India, while the shocks were
continuing, as if settling down from an eruption somewhere else, to a
world that was not speeding away orbitally, and to a point that was not
turning away by daily rotation.

Five days after the first fall of dust, "a substance resembling mud"
fell at Ghattal (*Friend of India*, July 14). For descriptions of just
such a "dry fog," as has often been seen in Italy, after an eruption of
Vesuvius, see the *Madras Mail*, July 5, and the *Friend of India*, July
14—"a perpetual haze on the horizon, all around," "sky covered with
thick layers of dust, resembling a foggy atmosphere." About the first of
July, mud fell at Hetamphore (Beerbhoom) according to the *Friend of
India*, July 14.

I list these falls of dust and mud, but to them I do not give the
importance that I give to the phenomena that preceded this earthquake. I
have come upon nobody's statement that they were of volcanic material.
But it may be that there were other precipitations, and that they were
of a substance that is unknown upon this earth,

<span id="page_771">p. 771</span>

In the *Englishman* (Calcutta), July 7, a correspondent wrote that,
several days before, at Khurdah, there had been a shower at night, and
that the air became filled with the perfume of sandalwood. The next
morning everything was found covered with "a colored matter, which
emitted the scent of sandalwood." About the same time, somebody else
wrote to the *Madras Mail* (July 8) that, at Nadia, there had been a
fall from the sky, of a substance "more or less resembling the sandal
used by natives in worshiping their gods."

The moon turns green before an earthquake.

Torrential rains precede an earthquake.

We have only begun listing phenomena that appear before catastrophes.
They are interpretable as warnings. Clipped from events, by barber-shop
science.

There was an investigation of phenomena in Assam. It was scientific, in
the sense that the tonsorial may be the scientific. Dr. Oldham
enormously reduced a catastrophe to manageable dimensions. He lathered
it with the soap of his explanations, and shaved it clean of all
unconventional details. This treatment of "Next!" to catastrophes is as
satisfactorily beautifying, to neat, little minds, as are some of the
marcel waves that astronomers have ironed into tousled circumstances.
For a review of Dr. Oldham's report, see *Nature*, 62-305. There is no
mention of anything that was seen in the sky, nor of anything that fell
from the sky, nor of occurrences anywhere else. Dr. Charles Davison, in
*A Study of Recent Earthquakes*, gives 57 pages to his account of this
catastrophe, and he, too, mentions nothing that was seen in the sky, or
that fell from the sky. He mentions no simultaneous phenomena anywhere
else. It is a neat and well-trimmed account, but there's a smell that I
identify as too much bay rum.

Simultaneous phenomena that always are left out of a conventionalist's
account of an earthquake—one of the most violent convulsions ever known
in Mexico, while the ground in India was quaking. There was a glare in
the sky, and the Mexicans thought that the glare was volcanic. If so, no
active volcano in Mexico could be found (*New Orleans Daily Picayune*,
June 22). Deluges fell upon this quaking land. One of the falls of
water, upon a Mexican

<span id="page_772">p. 772</span>

town, drowning some of the inhabitants, is told of, in the *San
Francisco Chronicle*, June 17.

In all this part of our job, our opposition is not so much denial of
data, as assertions that the occurrences in which we see relationship
were only coincidences. If I ever accept any such explanation, I shall
be driven into extending it to everything. We'll have a theory that in
our existence there is nothing but coincidence: and, according to my
experience with theorists, we'll develop this theory somewhat
reasonably. Chemical reactions, supposed to be well-known and accounted
for, do not invariably work out, as, according to formula, they should
work out. Failures are attributed to impurities in chemicals, but
perhaps it is only by persistent coincidence, like that of glares so
often occurring at times of earthquakes, that water appears when oxygen
and hydrogen unite. Meteors frequently fall to this earth during
earthquakes, but that may be only by coincidence, just as offsprings so
often appear after marriage—indicating nothing exclusively of
relationships, inasmuch as we have heard of cases of alleged independent
reproduction. Let the feminists become only a little more fanatical, and
they will probably publish lists of instances of female independence. It
is either that our data are not of coincidences, or that everything's a
coincidence.

As to some deluges, at times of earthquakes, there is no assertion of
coincidence, and there is no mystery. There's an earthquake, and water
falls from the sky. Then it is learned that a volcano—one of this
earth's volcanoes—had been in eruption, and that, responsively to it,
the earth had quaked, and that volumes of water, some of them black, and
some of them not discolored, had been discharged by this volcano,
falling in bulks, or falling in torrential rains upon the quaking
ground. Sometimes the sky darkens during earthquakes, and there is no
assertion of coincidence, and there is no mystery. Upon March 11, 1875,
for instance, a vast, black cloud appeared at Guadalajara, Mexico. There
was an earthquake. See *L’Année Scientifique*, 1876-322. In this
instance, the darkened sky at the time of an earthquake was explained,
because it was learned that both phenomena were effects of an eruption
of the volcano Caborucuco. There have been unmysterious showers of
meteors, or of fireballs that looked like meteors, at times of
earthquakes.

<span id="page_773">p. 773</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> There were
eruptions upon this earth, and the fireballs, or meteors, came from
them. There were especially spectacular showers of volcanic bombs that
looked like meteors, or that were meteors, during the eruptions in Java,
August, 1883; New Zealand, June, 1886; West Indies, May, 1902.

But our data are of such phenomena in the sky, during earthquakes, at
times when no terrestrial volcano that could have had such effects was
active.

So far we have not correlated with anything that could be considered a
volcanic eruption anywhere in regions external to this earth. Now we are
called upon, not only for data seemingly of volcanic eruptions in a
nearby starry shell around this earth, but for data that may be regarded
as observations upon celestial volcanoes in action.
