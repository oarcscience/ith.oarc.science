### 23

<span class="smallcaps">Melbourne</span> *<span
class="smallcaps">Age</span>*, Jan. 21, 1869—there was a carter. He was
driving a five-horse truck along the bed of a dry creek. Down the gulley
shot a watery fist that was knuckled with boulders. A dead man, a truck,
and five horses were punched into trees.

*New Orleans Daily Picayune*, Aug. 6, 1893—a woman in a carriage,
crossing a dried-up stream, in Rawlings County, Kansas. It was a quiet,
summery scene.

There was a rush of water. The carriage crumbled. There was a spill of
crumbs that were a woman's hat and the heads of horses.

*Philadelphia Public Ledger*, Sept. 16, 1893—people asleep, in the town
of Villacanas, Toledo, Spain. The town was raided by trees. Trees
smashed through the walls of houses. People in bed were grabbed by
roots. A deluge had fallen into a forest.

Bright, clear day, near Pittsburgh, Pa. From the sky swooped a wrath
that incited a river. It was one bulk of water: two miles away, no rain
fell (*New Orleans Daily Picayune*, July 11, 1893). A raging river
jeered against former confinements. Some of its gibes were freight cars.
It scoffed with bridges. Having made a high-water mark of rebellion, it
subsided into a petulance of jostling row-boats. Monistically, I have to
accept that no line of demarcation can be drawn between emotions of
minds and motions of rivers.

<span id="page_750">p. 750</span>

These sudden, astonishing leaks from the heavens are not understood.
Meteorologists study them meteorologically. This seems logical, and is
therefore under suspicion. This is the fallacy of all the sciences:
scientists are scientific. They are inorganically scientific. Some day
there may be organic science, or the interpretation of all phenomenal
things in terms of an organism that comprises all.

If our existence is an organism, in which all phenomena are continuous,
dreams cannot be utterly different, in the view of continuity, from
occurrences that are said to be real. Sometimes, in a nightmare, a
kitten turns into a dragon. Louth, Lincolnshire, England, May 29,
1920—the River Lud, which is only a brook, and is known as "Tennyson's
Brook," was babbling, or maybe it was purling—

Out of its play, this little thing humped itself twenty feet high. A
ferocious transformation of a brook sprang upon the houses of Louth, and
mangled fifty of them. Later in the day, between banks upon which were
piled the remains of houses, in which were lying twenty-two bodies, and
from which hundreds of the inhabitants had been driven homeless, the
little brook was babbling, or purling.

In scientific publications, early in the year 1880, an event was told
of, in the usual, scientific way: that is, as if it were a thing in
itself. It was said that a "water-spout" had burst upon the island of
St. Kitts, B. W. I. A bulk of water had struck this island, splitting it
into cracks, carrying away houses and people, drowning 250 of the
inhabitants. A paw of water, clawed with chasms, had grabbed these
people.

In accordance with our general treatments, we think that there are
waterspouts and cloudbursts, but that the waterspout and cloudburst
conveniences arise, when nothing else can, or, rather, should, be
thought of, and as labels are stuck on events that cannot be so
classified except as a matter of scientific decorum and laziness. Some
of the sleek, plump sciences are models of good behavior and inactivity,
because, with little else to do, they sit all day on the backs of
patient fishmongers.

As a monist, I think that there is something meteorological about us.
Out of the Libraries will come wraths of data, and we, too,

<span id="page_751">p. 751</span>

shall jeer against former confinements. Our gibes will be events, and we
shall scoff with catastrophes.

The "waterspout" at St. Kitts—as if it were a single thing, unrelated to
anything else. *The West Indian*, Feb. 3, 1880—that, while the bulk that
was called a waterspout was overwhelming St. Kitts, water was falling
upon the island of Grenada, "as it had never rained before, in the
history of the island." Grenada is 300 miles from St. Kitts.

I take data of another occurrence, from the *Dominican*, and *The
People*, published at Roseau, Dominica, B. W. I. About 11 o'clock,
morning of January 4th, the town of Roseau was bumped by midnight.
People in the streets were attacked by darkness. People in houses heard
the smash of their window panes. Night fell so heavily that it broke
roofs. It was a daytime night of falling mud. With the mud came a
deluge.

The River Roseau rose, and there was a conflict. The river, armed with
the detachables of an island, held up shields of mules, and pierced the
savage darkness with spears of goats. Long lines of these things it
flung through the black streets of Roseau.

In the Boiling Lakes District of Dominica, there had been an eruption of
mud, at the time of the deluge, which was like the fall of water upon
St. Kitts, eight days later. There had, in recorded time, never been an
eruption here before.

Three months before, there had been, in another part of the West Indies,
a catastrophe like that of St. Kitts. Upon Oct. 10, 1879, a deluge fell
upon the island of Jamaica, and drowned one hundred of the inhabitants
(London *Times*, Nov. 8, 1879). A flood that slid out from this island
was surfaced with jungles—tangles of mahogany logs, trees, and bushes;
brambled with the horns of goats and cattle; hung with a moss of the
fleece of sheep. Incoming vessels plowed furrows, as if in a passing
cultivation of one of the rankest luxuriances that ever vegetated upon
an ocean. Passengers looked at tangles of trees and bodies, as if at
picture puzzles. In foliage, they saw faces.

For months, there had been, in the Provinces of Murcia and Alicante,
Spain, a drought so severe that inhabitants had been driven into
emigration to Algeria. Whether we think of this

<span id="page_752">p. 752</span>

drought and the prayers of the people as having relation or not, there
came a downpour that was as intense as the necessities. See London
*Times*, Oct. 20, 1879. Upon October 10th, floods poured upon these
parched provinces. Perhaps it was response to the prayers of the people.
Five villages were destroyed. Fifteen hundred persons perished.

Virtually in the same zone with Spain and the West Indies (U. S.
Colombia) a deluge fell, in December. The River Cauca rose beyond all
former high water marks, so suddenly that people were trapped in their
houses. This was upon December 19th.

The next day, the earth started quaking in Salvador, near Lake Ilopanga.
This lake was the crater of what was supposed to be an extinct volcano.
I take data from the *Panama Daily Star and Herald*, Feb. 10, 1880.

Upon the 31st of December—four days before occurrences in the island of
Dominica—the earth quaked in Salvador, and from the middle of Lake
Ilopanga emerged a rocky formation. Water fell from the sky, in bulks
that gouged gullies. Gullies writhed in the quaking ground. The
inhabitants who cried to the heavens prayed to Epilepsy. Mud was falling
upon the convulsions. A volcanic island was rising in Lake Ilopanga,
displacing the water, in streams that writhed from it violently. Rise of
a form that filled the lake—it shook out black torrents—head of a
Gorgon, shaggy with snakes.

Beginning upon October 10th, and continuing until the occurrence at St.
Kitts, deluge after deluge came down to one zone around this earth—or a
flight of lakes was cast from a constellational reservoir, which was
revolving and discharging around a zone of this earth. In the minds of
most of us, this could not be. We have been taught to look up at the
revolving stars, and to see and to think that they do not revolve.

Our data are of the slaughters of people, who, by fishmongerish
explanations, have been held back from an understanding of an
irrigational system: of their emotions, and of the elementary emotions
of lands. There's a hope in a mind, and it turns to despair—or there's a
fertile region in the materials of a South American country—and an
unsuspected volcano chars it to a woe of leafless trees. Plains and the
promise of crops that are shining in sunlight

<span id="page_753">p. 753</span>

plains crack into disappointments, into which fall expectations. An
island appears in the ocean, and after a while young palms feel upward.
There's a convulsive relapse, and subliminal filth, from the bottom of
the ocean, plasters the little aspirations. Quaking lands have clasped
their fields, and have wrung their forests.

Each catastrophe has been explained by the metaphysical scientists, as a
thing in itself. Scientists are contractions of metaphysicians, in their
local searches for completeness, and in their statements that, except
for infinitesimal errors, plus or minus, completenesses have been found.
I can accept that there may be Super-phenomenal Completeness, but not
that there can be phenomenal completenesses. It may be that the
widespread thought that there is God, or Allness, is only an extension
of the deceiving process by which to an explanation of a swarm of lady
birds, or to a fall of water at St. Kitts, is given a guise of
completeness—or it may be the other way around—or that there is a
Wholeness—perhaps one of countless Wholenesses, in the cosmos—and that
attempting completenesses and attempting concepts of completenesses are
localizing consciousness of an all-inclusive state, or being—so far as
its own phenomena are concerned—that is Complete.

There have been showers of ponds. From blue skies there have been shafts
of water, golden in sunshine. Reflections from stars have fluted sudden,
dark, watery columns. There have been violent temples of
water—colonnades of shafts, revealed against darkness by
lightning—foaming façades as white as marble. Nights have been caves,
roofed with vast, fluent stalactites.

These are sprinkles.

March, 1913.

The meteorologists study meteorologically. The meteorologists were
surprised.

March 23, 1913—250,000 persons driven from their homes—torrents falling,
rivers rising, in Ohio. The floods at Dayton, Ohio, were especially
disastrous.

Traffics of bodies, in the watery streets of Dayton. The wind whistles,
and holds up a cab. They stop. Night—and the running streets are
hustling bodies—but, coming, is worse than the sights

<span id="page_754">p. 754</span>

of former beings, who never got anywhere in life, and are still
hurrying. The wreck of a trolley car speeds down an avenue—down a side
street rushes a dead man. Let him catch the car, and he'll get about
where all his lifetime he got catching other cars. A final dispatch from
Dayton—"Dayton in total darkness."

March 23, 24, 25—a watery sky sat on the Adirondack Mountains. It began
to slide. It ripped its slants on a peak, and the tops of lamp posts
disappeared in the streets of Troy and Albany. Literary event, at
Paterson, N. J.—something that was called "a great cloudburst" grabbed a
factory chimney, and on a ruled page of streets scrawled a messy
message. With the guts of horses and other obscenities, it put in
popularizing touches. The list of dead, in Columbus, Ohio, would
probably reach a thousand. Connecticut River rising rapidly. Delaware
River, at Trenton, N. J., 14 feet above normal.

March 26th—in Parkersburg, West Virginia, people who called on their
neighbors, rowed boats to second story windows. If they had in their
cellars what they have nowadays, there was much demand for divers. New
lakes in Vermont, and the State of Indiana was an inland sea. "Farmers
caught napping." Surprises everywhere: napping everywhere. Wherever
Science was, there was a swipe at a sleep. Floods in Wisconsin, floods
and destruction in Illinois and Missouri.

March 27th—see the *New York Tribune*, of the 28th—that the Weather
Bureau was issuing storm warnings.

The professional wisemen were not heard from, before this deluge. Some
of us would like to know what they had to say, afterward. They said it,
in the *Monthly Weather Review*, April, 1913.

The story is told "completely." The story is told, as if there had been
exceptional rains, only in Ohio and four neighboring States. Reading
this account, one thinks—as one should think—of considerable, or of
extraordinary, rain, in one smallish region, and of its derivation from
other parts of this earth, where unusual sunshine had brought about
unusual evaporations.

Canada—and it was not here that the sun was shining. Waters falling and
freezing, in Canada, loading trees and telegraph wires

<span id="page_755">p. 755</span>

with ice—power houses flooded, and towns in darkness—crashes of trees,
heavy with ice. California was drenched. Torrents falling, in Washington
and Oregon. Unprecedented snow in Texas, New Mexico, and
Oklahoma—Alabama deluged—floods in Florida.

"Ohio and four neighboring States."

Downpours in France and in other parts of Europe.

Spain—seems that, near Valencia, one of these nights, there was a rotten
theatrical performance. Such a fall of big hailstones that a train was
stalled—vast tragedian, in a black cloak, posing on the funnel of an
engine—car windows that were footlights—and disapproval was expressing
with the looks of millions of pigeons’ eggs. Anyway, near Valencia, a
fall of hail, three feet deep, stopped trains. Just where was all that
sunshine?

South Africa—moving pictures of the low degree of the now old-fashioned
"serials." Something staged Clutching Hands. There were watery grabs
from the sky, at Colesburg, Murraysburg, and Prieska. The volume of one
of these bulks equaled one-tenth of the total rainfall in South Africa,
in one year.

Snow, two months before its season, was falling in the Andes—floods in
Paraguay, and people spreading in panics—Government vessels carrying
supplies to homeless, starving people—River Uruguay rising rapidly.

Heavy rains in the Fiji Islands.

The rains in Tasmania, during the month of March, were 26 points above
the average.

Upon the first day of the floods in "Ohio and four neighboring States"
(March 22nd) began a series of terrific thunderstorms in Australia.
There was a "rain blizzard" in New South Wales. In Queensland, all mails
were delayed by floods.

New Zealand.

*Wellington Evening Post*, March 3i—"The greatest disaster in the
history of the Colony!"

Where there had been sluggish rivers, bodies of countless sheep tossed
in woolly furies. Maybe there is a vast, old being named God, and
reported strands of tossing sheep were glimpses of his whiskers, in one
of those wraths of his. In the towns, there were

<span id="page_756">p. 756</span>

fantastic savageries. Wherever the floods had been before, it looks as
if they had been to college. One of them rioted through the streets of
Gore, having broken down store windows. It roystered with the bodies of
animals, wrapped in lace curtains, silks, and ribbons. Down the Matura
River sounded a torrent of "terrible cries." It was a rush of drowning
cattle. It was a delirium of brandishing horns, upon which invisible
collegians were blowing a fanfare.

"Ohio and four neighboring States."

The clip of Paraguay, and the bob of New Zealand: the snip of South
Africa, and the shearing of everything else that did not fit in with a
theory. Whoever said that the pen is mightier than something else,
overlooked the mightiest of all, and that's the scissors.

Wherever all this water was coming from, the full account is of North
America and four neighboring Continents.

Peaches flying from orchards, in the winds of New Zealand—icicles
clattering in the streets of Montreal. The dripping palms of
Paraguay—and the pine trees of Oregon were mounds of snow. At night this
earth was a black constellation, sounding with panics. I can think of
the origin of the ocean that fell upon it in not less than
constellational terms. Perhaps Orion or Taurus went dry.

If a place, say in China, greatly needs water, and if there be stores of
water, somewhere else, in one organism, I can think of relations of
requital, as I think of need and response in any lesser organism, or
suborganism.

Need of a camel—and storages—and reliefs.

Hibernating bear—and supplies from his storages.

At a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, Dec. II, 1922, Sir
Francis Younghusband told of a drought, in August, 1906, in Western
China. The chief magistrate of Chungking prayed for rain. He put more
fervor into it. Then he prayed prodigiously for rain. It began to rain.
Then something that was called "a waterspout" fell from the sky. Many of
the inhabitants were drowned.

In the organic sense, I conceive of people and forests and dwindling
lakes all expressing a need, and finally compelling an answer. By
"prayers" I mean utterances by parched mouths, and also the rustlings of
dried leaves and grasses. It seems that there have been responses. There
are two explanations. One is that it is the mercy

<span id="page_757">p. 757</span>

of God. For an opinion here, see the data. The other is that it is an
Organism that is maintaining itself.

The British Government has engineered magnificently for water supply in
Egypt. It might have been better to plant persuasive trees and clergymen
in Egypt. But clergymen are notoriously eloquent, and I think that
preferable would be less excitable tipsters to God, who could convey the
idea of moderation.

In one year the fall of rain, at Norfolk, England, is about 29 inches.
In *Symons’ Meteorological Magazine*, 1889, p. 101, Mr. Symons told of
this fall of water of 29 inches in a year, and then told of volumes of
water to depths of from 20 to 24 inches that had fallen, from May 25th
to the 28th, 1889, in New South Wales, and of a greater deluge-34
inches—that, from the 29th to the 30th, had devastated Hongkong. Mr.
Symons called attention to these two bursts from the heavens, thousands
of miles apart, saying that they might, or might not, be a coincidence,
but that he left it to others to theorize. I point out that a
professional meteorologist thought the occurrence of only two deluges,
about the same time, but far apart, remarkable, or difficult to explain
in terms of terrestrial meteorology.

It was left a long time to others.

However, when I was due to appear, I appeared, perhaps right on
scheduled time; and I got Australian newspapers. The Sydney newspapers
told of the soak in New South Wales. I learned that all the rest of
Australia was left to others—or was left, waiting for me to appear,
right on scheduled time, most likely. Not rain, but columns of water
fell near the town of Avoca, Victoria, and, in the *Melbourne Argus*,
the way of accounting for them was to say that "a waterspout" had burst
here. There were wide floods in Tasmania. Fields turned to blanks that
were then lumpy with rabbits.

There had been drought in Australia, and floods were a relief to a
necessity, but the greater downpour in China interests us more in
conditions in China.

It was a time of direst drought and extremest famine in China. *Homeward
Mail*, June 4—that, in some of the more cannibalistic regions, sales of
women and children were common. It is said to be almost impossible for
anybody to devour his own child. Parents exchanged children.

<span id="page_758">p. 758</span>

Down upon monstrous need came relief that was enormous. At Hongkong,
houses collapsed under a smash of alleviation. A fury of mercy tore up
almost every street in the Colony. The people had prayed for rain. They
got it. Godness so loved Hongkong that in the town's morgue it stretched
out sixteen of the inhabitants. At Canton, every pietist proclaimed the
efficacy of prayer, and I think he was right about that: but the problem
is to tone down all this efficacy. If we will personify what I consider
an organism, what he, or more likely she, has not, is any conception of
moderation. The rise of the river, at Canton, indicated that up country
there had been catastrophic efficacy. At Canton efficacy was so extreme
that for months the people were rebuilding.

Show me a starving man—I pay no attention. Show me the starving man—I
can't be bothered. Show me the starving man, on the point of dying—I
grab up groceries and I jump on him. I cram bread down his mouth, and
stuff his eyes and his ears with potatoes. I rip open his lips to hammer
down more food, and bung in his teeth, the better to stuff him. The
explanation—it is the god-like in me.

Now, in a Library, we put in calls for the world's newspapers. Not a
hint have we had that there is anything else—nothing in scientific
publications of the period—not another word from Mr. Symons—but there is
an implement that is mightier than the pen—and we are led on to one of
our attempted correlations, by our experiences with it.

Germany—there was a drought so severe that there were public prayers for
rain. Something that was called "a waterspout" fell from the sky, and
people who did not get all the details went to church about it.
*Liverpool Echo*, May 20—one hundred persons perished.

At the same time, there were public rejoicings in Smyrna, where was
staged another assuasive tragedy.

Drought in Russia. *Straits Times*, June 6—droughts ended by downpours
in Bengal and Java. In Kashmir and in the Punjab, violent thunderstorms
and earthquakes occurred together (*Calcutta Statesman*, June 1 and 3).
In Turkey, there would have been extremist distress, but about the first
of June, amidst woe and thanks-giving,

<span id="page_759">p. 759</span>

destructive salvations demonstrated efficacy, and for a week kept on
spreading joy and misery. *Levant Herald*, June 4—earthquakes preceded
deluges, and then continued with them.

In conventional meteorology, no relation between droughts and
exceptional rains is admitted. Our data are of widespread droughts and
enormous flows of water. There are two little, narrow strips of views on
the margins of our moving pictures. On one side—that there is a
beneficent God. On the other side—that there isn't anything. And every
one of us who has paid any attention to the annals of controversies
knows that such oppositions usually give in to an intermediacy. May,
1889—widely this earth was in need—widely waters were coming from
somewhere. Now—in Organic terms—I am telling of what seems to me to be
Functional Teleportation, or enormous manifestations of that which is
sometimes, say in Oklahoma, a little drip over a tree.

Volcanic eruptions upon this earth, at times of deluges—and maybe, in a
land of the stars, there was an eruption, in May, 1889. In France, May
31st, there was one of the singularly lurid sunsets that are known as
"afterglows," and that appear after volcanic eruptions. There was no
known volcanic eruption upon this earth, from which a discharge could
have gone to the sky of France. It may have come from a volcanic
eruption somewhere else. All suggestiveness is that it came to this
earth over no such distance as millions of miles.

Other discharges, maybe—red rain coming down from the sky, at Cardiff,
Wales (*Cardiff Western Mail*, May 26). Red dust falling upon the island
of Hyères, off the coast of France, in the Mediterranean—see the *Levant
Herald*, May 29. *St. Louis Globe-Democrat*, May 30—an unknown substance
that for several hours had fallen from the sky—crystalline particles,
some pink, and some white. *Quebec Daily Mercury*, May 25—a fine dust
that had the appearance of a snowstorm, falling in Dakota.

Monstrous festivities in Greece—a land that was bedecked with
assassinations. Its rivers were garlands—vast twists of vines, budded
with the bodies of cattle.

The Malay States gulped. The mines of Kamunting were suctions,

<span id="page_760">p. 760</span>

into which flowed floods (*Penang Gazette*, May 24). The Bahama Islands
were thirsts—drought and loss of crops—then huge swigs from the sky.
Other West Indian islands went on Gargantuan sprees—and I'll end up a
Prohibitionist. Orgies in Greece, and more or less everywhere else—this
earth went drunk on water. I've experimented—try autosuggestion—you can
get a pretty fair little souse from any faucet. Tangier—"great suffering
from the drought"—abundant rains, about June 1st. Drought in British
Honduras, and heavy rains upon the 1st and 2nd of June. Tremendous
downpours described in the newspaper published upon the island of St.
Helena. Earthquake at Jackson, California—the next day a gush from the
sky broke down a dam. I'm on a spree, myself—Library attendants wheeling
me stacks of this earth's newspapers. Island of Cyprus—a flop from the
sky, and the river Pedias went up with a rush from which people at
Nicosia narrowly escaped. Torrents in Ceylon. June 4th—a drought of many
weeks broken by rains in Cuba. Drought in Mexico—and out of the heavens
came a Jack the Ripper. Torn plantations and mutilated cities—rise of
the river, at Huezutla—when it subsided the streets were strewn with
corpses.

In England, Mr. Symons expressed astonishment, because there had been
two deluges.

Deluge and falls of lumps of ice, throughout England. France deluged.
Water dropped from the sky, at Lausanne, Switzerland, flooding some of
the streets five feet deep. It was not rain. There were falling columns
of water from what was thought to be a waterspout. The most striking of
the statements is that bulks dropped. One of them was watched. Or some
kind of a vast, vaporous cow sailed over a town, and people looked up at
her bag of water. Something that was described as "a large body of
water" was seen at Coburg, Ontario. It crossed the town, holding its
bag-like formation. Two miles away, it dropped. It splashed rivers that
broke down all dams between Coburg and Lake Ontario. In the *Toronto
Globe*, June 3, this falling bulk is called "a waterspout." Fall of a
similar bulk, in Switzerland—crops and houses and bridges mixing down a
valley, at Sargans. Fall of a bulk, at Reichenbach, Saxony. "It was a
waterspout" (London *Times*, June 6).

<span id="page_761">p. 761</span>

This time the fishmonger is a waterspout.

Spain pounded by falling waters: Madrid flooded: many buildings damaged
by a violent hailstorm. Deluges in China continuing. Deluges in
Australia continuing. Floods in Argentina: people of Ayacuchio driven
from their homes: sudden rise of the river, at Buenos Aires. In the
*South American Journal* of this period are accounts of tremendous
downpours and devastations in Brazil and Uruguay.

One of these bodies of water that were not rain fell at Chetnole,
Dorsetshire, England. The people, hearing crashes, looked up at a hill,
and saw it frilled with billows. Watery ruffs, from eight to ten feet
high, heaved on the hill. The village was tossed in a surf. "The cause
of this remarkable occurrence was for some time unknown but it has now
been ascertained that a waterspout burst on Batcombe Hill." So wrote Mr.
Symons, in whose brains there was no more consciousness of all that was
going on in the world about him than there was in any other pair of
scissors.

It was not ascertained that a waterspout had burst on Batcombe Hill. No
waterspout was seen. What was ascertained was that columns of water of
unknown origin had fallen high on the Hill, gouging holes, some of them
eight or nine feet deep. Though Mr. Symons gave the
waterspout-explanation, it did occur to him to note that there was no
statement that the water was salty—

These bulks of water, and their pendent columns—that they were
waterspouts—

Or that Slaughter had lain with Life, and that murderous mothers had
slung off their udders, from which this earth drank through teats that
were cataracts.

Wherever the deluges were coming from, I note that, as with phenomena of
March, 1913, unseasonable snow fell. Here it was about the first of
June, and snow was falling in Michigan. The suggestion is that this was
not a crystallization in the summer sky of Michigan, but an effect of
the intenser coldness of outer regions, upon water that had come to this
earth from storages on a planet, or from a reservoir in Starland. Note
back to mention of falls of lumps of ice in England.

<span id="page_762">p. 762</span>

Wherever the deluges were coming from, meteors, too, were coming. If we
can think that falls of water and falls of meteors were related, we have
reinforcement to our expression that water was coming to this needful
earth from somewhere else. Five remarkable meteors are told of, in the
*Monthly Weather Review*. In the *New York Sun*, May 30, is an account
of a meteor that exploded in the sky of Putnam County, Florida, and was
heard 15 miles around. In Madras, India, where the drought was "very
grave," an extraordinary meteor was seen, night of June 4th (*Madras
Mail*, June 26). In South Africa, where the drought was so extreme that
a herd of buffaloes had been driven to a pool within five miles of the
town of Uitenhage, a meteor exploded, with detonations that were heard
in a line 40 miles long (*Cape Argus*, May 28). May 22nd—great,
detonating meteor, at Otranto, Italy. The meteor that was seen in
England and Ireland, May 29th, is told of in *Nature*, 40-174. For
records of three other great meteors, see *Nature* and *Cosmos*. There
was a spectacular occurrence at Dunedin, New Zealand, early in the
morning of May 27th (*Otago Witness*, June 6). Rumbling sounds—a
shock—illumination of the sky—exploding meteor.

In some parts of the United States, there had been extreme need for
water. In the *New Orleans Daily Picayune* are accounts of the "gloomy
outlook for crops" in six of the Southern States. About twenty reports
upon this drought were published in the *Monthly Weather Review*.

Rushes of violent mercies—they flooded the south and smashed the
north—crash of a dam, at Littleton, New Hampshire—busted dam near
Laurel, Pa.—

May, 1889—and Science and Religion—

It is my expression that the two outstanding blessings, benefits, or
"gifts of God" to humanity, are Science and Religion. I deduce this—or
that the annals of both are such trails of slaughter, deception,
exploitation, and hypocrisy that they must be of enormous good to
balance with their appalling evils—

Or the craze of medical science for the vermiform appendix. That played
out. Now everybody who can pay for it is losing his tonsils. Newspaper
headings—"Family of eight relieved of their

tonsils"—"Save your pets—dogs and cats endangered by their tonsils."

Concentrate in one place this bloody fad, or scientific "racket," and
there would be a fury like that at Andover, N. Y., in May, 1889—

A bulk of water, foaming as white as a surgeon—it jabbed a bolt of
lightning into Andover. It operated upon farms, and cut off their
inhabitants. Trained clouds stood around, and handed out more bolts of
lightning. A dam broke, and a township writhed upon its field of
operations. Another dam broke—but the operations were successes, and, if
there was much destruction, that was because of a complication of other
causes.

May 31st—Johnstown, Pa.—

If I can't think of massacre apart from devotions, I think that a lake
ran mad with religious mania. It rushed down a valley, and, if I'm right
about this, it bore on its crest, the most appalling of all symbols—the
mast of a ship that was crossed by a telegraph pole. In a pogrom against
houses, it clubbed out their occupants, with bridges. It impaled homes
upon the steeples of churches. Its watery Cossacks, mounted on billows,
flogged factories. And then, along the slopes of the Conemaugh Valley,
it told its beads with strings of corpses.

Earthwide droughts—prayers to many gods—something vouchsafed
catastrophes—

That from somewhere else in existence, vast volumes of water were sent
to this arid earth, or were organically teleported—

Or that, by coincidence, and unseen, waterspout after waterspout rose
from the Atlantic, and rose from the Pacific: from the Indian Ocean, the
Southern Ocean, and from the Mediterranean; from the Gulf of Mexico, the
English Channel, Lake Ontario—or that such an extension of such
fishmongering is a brutalization of conveniences—

Or that from somewhere in a starry shell that is not enormously far away
from this earth, more than a Mississippi streamed to this needful earth,
and forked the disasters of its beneficence from Australia to Canada.

15,000 persons were drowned at Johnstown. *Chicago Tribune*, June 10,
1889—"The people of Johnstown have lost all faith in Providence. Many
have thrown away their Bibles, and since the disaster have openly burned
them."

By the providential, I mean the organically provided for.

By God, I mean an automatic Jehovah.
