### 21

<span class="smallcaps">A trek</span> of circumstances that kicks up a
dust of details—a vast and dirty movement that is powdered with
particulars—

The gossip of men and women, and the yells of brats—whether dinner is
ever going to be ready, or not—young couples in their nightly sneaks—and
what the hell has become of the grease for the wheels?—who's got a
match?

It's a wagon train that feels out across a prairie.

<span id="page_731">p. 731</span>

A drink of water—a thaw of tobacco—just where to borrow a cupful of
flour—and yet, even though at its time any of these wants comes first,
there is something behind all—

The hope for Californian gold.

The wagon train feels out across the prairie. It traces a path that
other wagon trains make more distinct—and then so rolls a movement that
to this day can be seen the ruts of its wheels.

But behind the visions of gold, and the imagined feel of nuggets, there
is something else—

The gold plays out. A dominant motive turns to something else. Now a
social growth feels out. Its material of people, who otherwise would
have been stationary, has been moved to the west.

The first, faint structures in an embryonic organism are of cartilage.
They are replaced by bone.

The paths across prairies turn to lines of steel.

Or that once upon a time, purposefully, to stimulate future
developments, gold was strewn in California—and that there had been
control upon the depositions, so that only enough to stimulate a
development, and not enough to destroy a financial system had been
strewn—

That in other parts of this earth, in far back times, there had been
purposeful plantings of the little, yellow slugs that would—when their
time should come—bring about other extensions of social growths.

But the word *purposeful*, and the word *providential*, are usurped
words. They are of the language of theologians, and are meant to express
an idea of a presiding being, ruling existence, superior to it, and not
of it, or not implicit to it. I'd rather go on using these words,
denying their ownership by any special cult, than to coin new words.
With no necessity for thinking of an external designer and controller, I
can think of design and control and providence and purpose and
preparation for future uses, if I can think not loosely of Nature, but
of *a* Nature, as an organic whole. Every being, except for its
dependence upon environment, is God to its parts.

It is upon the northern parts of this earth that the civilizations that
have persisted have grown up, then extending themselves colonially
southward. History, like South America and Africa,

<span id="page_732">p. 732</span>

tapers southward. There are no ruins of temples, pyramids, obelisks, in
Australia, Argentina, South Africa. Preponderantly peninsulas are
southward droops. As if by design, or as if concordantly with an
accentuation of lands and peoples in the north, the sun shines about a
week longer in the north, each year, than in the south. The coldness in
the less important Antarctic regions is more intense than in the Arctic,
and here there is no vegetation like the grasses and flowers of the
Arctic, in the summertime. Life withers southward. Musk oxen, bears,
wolves, foxes, lemmings in the Far North—but there are only amphibious
mammals in the Antarctic. Fields of Arctic poppies in the Arctic
summertime—but summer in the Antarctic is gray with straggling lichens.
If this earth be top-shaped as some of the geodesists think, it is a
bloom that is stemmed with desolation.

There are no deposits of coal in the southern parts that compare with
deposits in the northern parts. The greatest abundance of oil supplies
is north of the equator. It looks like organic preparation, in formative
times, before human life appeared upon this earth, for civilizations
that would grow up in the north. For ages, peoples of this earth were
ignorant of the uses of coal and oil, upon which their later
developments would depend.

But so conventionalized are the thoughts of most persons, upon this
subject, that if, for instance, my expression is that gold was strewn in
California in preparation for future uses, there must be either a
visualization of an aggrandized man, who walked about, slinging nuggets,
or a denial that, except in the mind of a man, there can be purpose, or
control, or design, or providence—

But the making of a lung in an embryonic being that cannot breathe—but
it will breathe. This making of a lung is a preparation for future uses.
Or the depositions of tissues that are muscles that are not, but that
will be, used. Mechanical foresight, or preparation for future uses,
pervades every embryonic being. There is a fortune teller in every womb.

Still, not altogether only theological have been speculations upon the
existence of purpose, or design, control, or guidance in "Nature." There
are philosophical doctrines known as *orthogenesis* and *entelechy*.
Again we are in a situation that we have noted. If there

<span id="page_733">p. 733</span>

be orthogenesis, or guidance from within—within what? Heretofore, this
doctrine has provided no outlines within which to think. All that is
required for thinkableness, instead of bafflement, is to give up
attempted notions upon Nature, as Universality, and conceive of one
thinkable-sized existence, of shape that is representable in thought,
and conceive of an organic orthogenesis within that.

In the organic sense, there is, in the Arctic regions, no great need for
water. Though the coldness is not so intense here as it is commonly
supposed to be, the climate nevertheless prevents much colonization. I
have never read of a deluge in the Arctic. Thunderstorms are very
uncommon. Some explorers have never seen a thunderstorm in the Arctic
regions. And at the same time there are oppressively warm, or almost
tropical, summer days in the Arctic. Instead of the enormous falls of
snow, of common suppositions, the fall of snow, in the Far North, is
"very light" (Stefansson). It looks like organically economic neglect of
a part that cannot be used. Where, as reliefs, thunderstorms are not
needed, there are, except as vagaries, no thunderstorms, though the
summertime conditions in places of need and no need are much alike. See
Heilprin's account of his experiences in Greenland—summer days so nearly
tropical that pitch melted from the seams of his ship.

The alternations that are known as the seasons are beneficial. They have
come about accidentally, or they have been worked out by Automatic
Design, or by all-pervasive intelligence, or by equilibration, if that
word be preferred to the word "intelligence." It looks as if more
complexly a problem was solved. It is commonly thought that only brains
solve problems, or, rather, approximate to solutions: but every living
thing that carries a weapon, or a tool, has, presumably not with its
brains, but with the intelligence that pervades all substances—so then
with the intelligence of its body—solved a problem. It looks as if more
complexly a problem was solved, as I say, though in anything like a
real, or final, sense, no problem ever has been solved. By the varying
incidence of the sun, alternations of fruitfulness and rest could be
brought about in the north and the south, but that left rhythms small in
the tropics. It looks as if here, intelligently, were brought about the
changes that are known as the dry season and the rainy season.

<span id="page_734">p. 734</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I have never read
a satisfactory explanation of this alternation, in conventional,
meteorological terms.

In the April rains there is evidence, or might be, if we could have a
rational idea as to what we mean by evidence, of design, and an
automatically intelligent provision and control. Something is
controlling the motions of the planets, according to all appearances
that we take as appearances of control. Accepting this, I am only
amplifying. Rains, of a gentle and frequent kind that is most beneficial
to young plants, or best adapted to them, fall in April. Conventional
biology is too one-sided. It treats of adaptation of plants to rain. We
see also the adaptation of rains to plants. But there must be either the
conventionally theological, or the organic, view, to see this
reciprocity. If one prefers to think of a kind and loving deity, who is
sending the April rains, he will have to consider—or, rather, will be
faced by—records of other rains, which are of the loving kindness of
slaughter and desolation and woe.

There is some, unknown condition that ameliorates the climate of Great
Britain, as if this center of colony-sporing were prepared for by an
automatic purposefulness, and protected from the rigors of the same
latitudes in the west. Once upon a time, one of the wisemen's most
definite concepts was the Gulf Stream. They wrote about its "absolute
demarcation" from surrounding waters. They were as sure of the Gulf
Stream as they are today that the stars are trillions of miles away.
Lately so much has been written upon the inconceivability of the Gulf
Stream having effect upon climate farther from its source than somewhere
around Cape Hatteras, that I shall not go into that subject. Something
is especially warming Great Britain, and it cannot be thought to be the
Gulf Stream. It may be an organically providential amelioration. It may
play out, when the functioning period of Great Britain passes away. I am
not much given to prophecy, but I'll take this chance—that if England
loses India, we may expect hard winters in England.

Our acceptance is that nations work together, or operate against one
another functionally, or as guided by the murderous supervisions of a
whole Organism. Or, apologizing again, I call such organized slaughter,
*super-metabolism*. So enormous is the subject of human history, as
affected by its partness in a whole, that I shall

<span id="page_735">p. 735</span>

reserve it for treatment some other time. Monistically—though some other
time I shall pluralistically take another view, as well—the acceptance
is that human beings have not existed as individuals any more than have
cells in an animal organism existences of their own. Still, one must
consider that there is something of individuality, or contrariness in
every cell. This view of submergence is now so widespread that it is
expressed by writers in many fields of thought. But they lack the
concept of a whole, trying to think of a social organism as a whole,
though clearly every social quasi-organism has relations with other
social quasi-organisms, and is dependent enormously, or vitally, upon
environment. Other thinkers, or more than doubtful thinkers, say that
they think of the unthinkable Absolute as the whole.

I have a notion that, for ages, as a factor in an automatic plan, the
Australian part of our existence's nucleus, this earth, was reserved. If
this be not easy to think, it is equally hard to think why Australia, in
its fertile parts, was not colonized by Asiatics. There was relative
isolation. But it was not geographical isolation: the distance between
Cape York, Australia, and New Guinea is only 100 miles. There was an
approximation to isolation so extreme that one type of animal life grew
up and prevailed. This gap was jumped by the marsupials of Australia.
Then the question is—why, if not obediently to an inhibition, was it not
jumped the other way? Of course we can have no absolute expressions, but
just when the dingoes and the wild cattle of Queensland first arrived in
Australia is still considered debatable.

There were civilizations in the Americas, but they were civilizations
that could not resist the relatively late-appearing Europeans. Long
before, there had been other civilizations in Central America, but they
had disappeared, or they had been removed. The extinction of them is, by
archaeologists, considered as mysterious, as is the extinction of the
dinosaurs, by the paleontologists—or as, by cells of a later period,
might be considered the designed and scheduled, or purposeful,
extinction of cartilage cells in an embryo.

The expression is that Australia and the Americas were reserved, as
relative blanks, in which human life upon this earth could shake

<span id="page_736">p. 736</span>

off, after a fashion, many conventions and traditional hamperings, and
start somewhat anew.

Drones appear in a beehive. They are reserved. At first they contribute
nothing to the welfare of the hive, but there is a providence that looks
after them just so long as they will be of future use. This is automatic
foresight and purpose, according to automatic plan, in a beehive,
regarded as a whole. The God of the bees is the Hive. There is no
necessity to think of an external control, nor of any being, presiding
over the bees and directing their affairs.

Reservations besides those in the affairs of bees and men are common.
Some trees have buds that are not permitted to develop. These are known
as *dormants*, and are held in reserve, against the possibility of a
destruction of the tree's developed leaves. In one way or another, there
are reservations in every organism.

We think of inter-mundane isolations that have been maintained, as once
the Americas were kept separated from Europe, not by vast and
untraversable distances, but by belief in vast and untraversable
distances. I have no sense of loneliness in thinking that the inorganic
sciences that are, by inertia, holding out for the isolation of this
earth, have lost much power over minds. There are dissatisfactions and
contempts everywhere.

There may be civilizations in the lands of the stars, or it may be that,
in the concavity of a starry shell, vast, habitable regions have been
held in reserve for colonization from this earth. Though there is
considerable opposition to wars, they are, as at any moving picture
place, one can see, still popular: but other eliminations of human
beings have waned, and it is likely that for a long time birth control
will have no more than its present control upon births. The pestilences
that used to remove millions are no longer so much heard of. It may be
that an organic existence is, by lessening eliminations, preparing a
pressure of populations upon this earth that can have relief only in
enormous colonizing outlets somewhere else. It is as if concordantly,
the United States has shut down, as a relief, to superabundances of
people in Europe, and as if representing the same purpose or plan,
Australia and Canada, as well as the United States, are shutting out
Asiatics. It is as if co-operatively

<span id="page_737">p. 737</span>

with the simultaneous variations of need, aviation is developing, as the
means of migratory reliefs—

If there be a nearby land that is a revolving shell of stars—

And if, according to data that I have collected, there be not increasing
coldness and attenuation of air, past a zone not far from this earth.

Nineteen hundred and thirty something or another—may be nineteen hundred
and forty or fifty—

There's a flash in the sky. It is said to be a meteor. There's a glow.
That is said to be an aurora borealis—

The time has come.

The slogan comes—

*Skyward ho!*

The treks to the stars. Flows of adventurers—and the movietone
news—press agents and interviews—and somebody about to sail to Lyra
reduces expenses by letting it be known what brand of cigarettes he'll
take along—

Caravels with wings—and the covered planes of the sky—and writers of
complaints to the newspapers: this dumping of milk bottles and worse
from the expeditions is an outrage. New comets are watched from this
earth—long trains of voyagers to the stars, when at night they turn on
their lights. New constellations appear—the cities of the lands of the
stars.

And then the commonplaceness of it all.

Personally conducted tours to Taurus and Orion. Summer vacations on the
brink of Vega. "My father tells of times, when people, before going to
the moon, made their wills." "Just the same there was something peaceful
about those old skies. It's getting on my nerves, looking up at all
those lip stick and soap and bathing suit signs."

Or my own acceptance that there can be no understanding of our
existence, if be overlooked the irony of it all—

The aristocratic astronomers—their alleged rapport with infinitude—their
reputed familiarity with the ultra-remote—the academic—the classical—

One looks up and sees, instead, an illuminated representation of a can
of spaghetti in tomato sauce, in the sky.

<span id="page_738">p. 738</span>

The commonplaceness of it all. Of course the stars are near. Who, but a
few old fossils, ever thought otherwise? Does the writer of this book
think that he found out anything new? All these notions of his were
matters of common knowledge, away back in the times of ancient Greece.
