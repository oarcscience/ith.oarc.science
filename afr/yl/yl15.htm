<H2 ALIGN="center">XIII<BR> THE WATER-BIRD</H2>

<P>T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> water-bird always stands on one leg, and this is why:</P>

<P>&#8195;A water-bird once, in search of food, swallowed the King of the crabs, and the whole tribe of crabs were so enraged that they swore they would have their revenge.</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;We will find this horrible bird,&#8221; they declared, &#8220;and nip off its legs. We shall not fail to find it, for its legs are bright

pink in colour and its feathers are pink and white.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;But the water-rat overheard the crabs plotting, and hastened to tell the water-bird.</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; cried the water-bird. &#8220;They will nip off my beautiful pink legs, and then what will become of me? Whatever can I do?&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;It is very simple,&#8221; replied the water-rat. &#8220;If you stand on one leg, they will think you are some other creature.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;The bird thanked him and tucked up one leg. When the crabs came, they saw, as they thought, a very tall pink bird with one leg and a large beak.</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;Our enemy has two legs,&#8221; they said. &#8220;This cannot be he.&#8221; And they passed by.</P>
