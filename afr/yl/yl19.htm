<H2 ALIGN="center">XVII<BR> IS<U>O</U>KUN AND THE BABY</H2>

<P>A <SMALL>CERTAIN</SMALL> King Dekun had a wife named Is<U>o</U>kun who bore him no children, on which account there was great unhappiness in the palace.</P>

<P>&#8195;One day Is<U>o</U>kun disappeared and was absent for many weeks, and though search was made, no trace of her could be found. The truth was that Is<U>o</U>kun had set out to visit the shrines of all the gods, in the hope that one of them would promise her a child. But though she travelled far and wide, the gods of all the trees and streams and rocks refused her prayer.</P>

<P>&#8195;When she was at last nearing home again, she came upon a poor woman asleep by the wayside with her baby two days old.</P>

<P>&#8195; Is<U>o</U>kun stole the baby and hastened to the palace, where she informed the King that she had disappeared in order to give him the joyous surprise of his little son.</P>

<P>&#8195;There were great rejoicings in the palace,

sacrifices were made, and the drums beat loudly.</P>

<P>&#8195;Meanwhile the real mother awoke and discovered that her baby had been stolen. She ran into the town distracted, and insisted on searching in every house, but without success.</P>

<P>&#8195;At last she came to the palace and insisted on entering there also, which was possible at that moment because all were celebrating the arrival of the King&#8217;s heir.</P>

<P>&#8195;All this time the baby cried with hunger, and as Is<U>o</U>kun could not feed him, she invented other reasons for the crying and sought in vain to pacify him without arousmg suspicion.</P>

<P>&#8195;Drawn by the cries, the mother entered and snatched the baby to her breast, where it was at once contented.</P>

<P>&#8195;In a few moments the deception was made clear, the mother departed with her child, and Is<U>o</U>kun, ashamed and fearing the anger of the King, fled from the palace and never returned.</P>
