## XXXVII TORTOISE AND CRAB

E<span class="small">VERYONE</span> knows that Tortoise and Crab are
enemies.

 One morning on the seashore they decided to fight to see which was the
stronger, but, as both of them are protected by a hard shell, neither
could succeed in injuring the other.

 Finally they came to an agreement that they were equal in strength.

 “We are so well protected by our <span id="page_77">p. 77</span>
armour,” said Tortoise, “that no one can harm us.”

 “And thus,” said Crab, “we are the strongest creatures in the world.”

 But at this moment a boy passed by and picked them both up. Tortoise
was boiled in a pot and his shell was made into ornaments, while Crab
was cooked in a stew for the boy’s supper. Since that day the
descendants of the two boasters have always been ashamed to meet, and
that is why they always shun one another.
