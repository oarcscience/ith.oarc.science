## XXVII THE SECRET OF THE FISHING-BASKETS

A<span class="small">CROSS</span> a certain river a poor fisherman set a
row of stakes, and on each stake was fastened a basket in which he hoped
to trap the fishes as they swam down the river.

 But his luck was very bad, and every <span id="page_50">p. 50</span>
evening, as he went from basket to basket in his canoe, he was
disappointed to find that no fishes, or only a few very small ones, had
been caught.

 This made him very sad, and he was forced to live frugally.

 One day he found a stranger lying asleep on the river-bank. Instead of
killing the stranger, the fisherman spoke kindly to him, and invited him
to share his evening meal.

 The stranger appeared very pleased and ate and drank, but spoke no word
at all, The fisherman thought: “He speaks another language.”

 Quite suddenly the stranger vanished, and only the remains of the meal
convinced the fisherman that he had not been dreaming.

 The next evening when he went to empty his baskets, he was astonished
to find them overflowing with fish. He could not account for his good
fortune, and his surprise was even greater when the same thing occurred
the next day. On the third day <span id="page_51">p. 51</span> the
baskets were again quite full, and when the fisherman came to the last
basket he saw that it contained a single monstrous fish.

 “Do you not know me?” said the fish.

 “Indeed no, Mr. Fish. I have never seen you before!” declared the
fisherman, nearly upsetting the canoe in his astonishment.

 “Have you forgotten the stranger whom you treated so courteously?” went
on the fish. “It was I, and I am the King of the fishes. I am grateful
for your kindness and intend to reward you.”

 Then the fish jumped into the river with a great splash. But ever
afterwards the fishing-baskets were full every evening, and the
fisherman became rich and prosperous.
