## PREFACE

I<span class="small">N</span> modern times we have begun paying close
attention to folklore—old tales, not invented by one man, but belonging
to the whole people; not written down, but told by parents to their
children, and so handed on for hundreds of years.

 The legends and fairy stories in this book belong to the Yoruba country
of Southem Nigeria. They relate the adventures of men and animals, and
try to explain the mysteries of Nature—Why Women have Long Hair, How the
Leopard got his Spots, and so forth. Most of them include very old
songs, but these cannot here be given in full.

 We must not think that the stories are scientifically true; they grew
out of the imagination of the people, and for actual, proven facts we
must look in our text-books. We read these folk-tales for their <span
id="page_iv">p. iv</span> quaintness and humour, for their sympathy with
Nature, and because we find in them the ideas and ideals, not just of
one man, but of the race.

 The legends express primitive notions of right and wrong, and in this
they fall below the new standard which Christianity has set for our
actions. As a rule, however, the wicked are punished and the good
rewarded; and that, we feel, is as it should be. We may weep at the
death of rascally Tortoise, but we feel that he deserves his fate!
