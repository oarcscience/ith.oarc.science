## IV SONS OF STICKS

A <span class="small">GREAT</span> King sent his various sons to rule
over different parts of his kingdom, and all were satisfied but one, the
youngest and most ambitious, who returned to his father after some time
with the complaint that his territory was much too small and his
subjects too few.

 The King was displeased with his son, and sent for a large bundle of
sticks, which he converted into human beings.

 “Here are some more subjects for you!” he said to the astonished
Prince.

 From that time the tribe was famous for its strength and stupidity, and
went by the nickname of “Sons of Sticks,” or “Ọmọ igi”!
