## XXXVI TORTOISE AND THE COCK

O<span class="small">NE</span> day Tortoise and Nyanribo felt very
hungry, but they could not afford to buy food, and while they were
discussing what might be done, Tortoise heard a cock crowing, and it
gave him an idea. He went to the cock and said:

 “I have come to warn you. I heard the farmer asking his wife to prepare
chicken for dinner to-morrow.”

 At this all the fowls were in great distress and wondered which of them
was to be killed.

 Tortoise replied:

 “I heard the farrner’s wife say that she will kill the first of you
which she hears crowing or clucking in the morning.”

 Naturally the fowls decided to be absolutely silent.

 Very early in the moming Tortoise went creeping among the fowls and
stole all the eggs from the nests, taking them <span id="page_76">p.
76</span> one by one to his house; but the cock was afraid to crow and
the hens were afraid to cluck, and when the farmer’s wife came to
collect the eggs, she found that they had all been stolen.

 At this she flew into a rage, and killed all the fowls instead of one,
and while the farmer and his wife had a feast of chicken, Tortoise and
Nyanribo invited their friends to a feast of eggs!
