## XVII IS<u>O</u>KUN AND THE BABY

A <span class="small">CERTAIN</span> King Dekun had a wife named
Is<u>o</u>kun who bore him no children, on which account there was great
unhappiness in the palace.

 One day Is<u>o</u>kun disappeared and was absent for many weeks, and
though search was made, no trace of her could be found. The truth was
that Is<u>o</u>kun had set out to visit the shrines of all the gods, in
the hope that one of them would promise her a child. But though she
travelled far and wide, the gods of all the trees and streams and rocks
refused her prayer.

 When she was at last nearing home again, she came upon a poor woman
asleep by the wayside with her baby two days old.

  Is<u>o</u>kun stole the baby and hastened to the palace, where she
informed the King that she had disappeared in order to give him the
joyous surprise of his little son.

 There were great rejoicings in the palace, <span id="page_32">p.
32</span> sacrifices were made, and the drums beat loudly.

 Meanwhile the real mother awoke and discovered that her baby had been
stolen. She ran into the town distracted, and insisted on searching in
every house, but without success.

 At last she came to the palace and insisted on entering there also,
which was possible at that moment because all were celebrating the
arrival of the King’s heir.

 All this time the baby cried with hunger, and as Is<u>o</u>kun could
not feed him, she invented other reasons for the crying and sought in
vain to pacify him without arousmg suspicion.

 Drawn by the cries, the mother entered and snatched the baby to her
breast, where it was at once contented.

 In a few moments the deception was made clear, the mother departed with
her child, and Is<u>o</u>kun, ashamed and fearing the anger of the King,
fled from the palace and never returned.
