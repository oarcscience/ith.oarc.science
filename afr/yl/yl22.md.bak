## XX ANOTHER STORY OF LEOPARD’S SPOTS

A<span class="small">CCORDING</span> to another story, Leopard once had
a very dark skin. He was prowling one day in a beautiful compound, when
he noticed a little hut in which a lady was taking her bath.

 Round and round the hut Leopard walked, waiting for an opportunity to
spring into the hut and seize his victim, for he was hungry.

 But as he passed the opening of the hut, the lady saw him, and,
uttering a scream <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> of terror, she threw
at him her loofah, which was full of soap.

But to this day the Leopard still<br />
Is flecked with soap from foot to head!”<br />
