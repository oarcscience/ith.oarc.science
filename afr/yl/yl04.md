## II HOW TRIBAL MARKS CAME TO BE USED

A <span class="small">CERTAIN</span> King named Sango sent two slaves to
a distant country on an important mission.

 In due course they returned, and he found that one slave had achieved
successfully what he had been sent to do, while the other had
accomplished nothing. The <span id="page_3">p. 3</span> King therefore
rewarded the first with high honours, and commanded the second to
receive a hundred and twenty-two razor cuts all over his body.

 This was a severe punishment, but when the scars healed, they gave to
the slave a very remarkable appearance, which greatly took the fancy of
the King’s wives.

 Sango therefore decided that cuts should in future be given, not as
punishment, but as a sign of royalty, and he placed himself at once in
the hands of the markers. However, he could only bear two cuts, and so
from that day two cuts on the arm have been the sign of royalty, and
various other cuts came to be the marks of different tribes.
