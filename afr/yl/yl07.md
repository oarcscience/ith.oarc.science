## V WHY WOMEN HAVE LONG HAIR

T<span class="small">WO</span> women quarrelled, and one of them went
out secretly at night and dug a deep pit in the middle of the path
leading from her enemy’s house to the village well.

 Early next morning, when all were going to the well for water with jars
balanced on their heads, this woman fell into the pit and cried loudly
for help.

 Her friends ran to her and, seizing her by the hair, began to pull her
out of the pit. To their surprise, her hair stretched as they pulled,
and by the time she was safely on the path, her hair was as long as a
man’s arm.

 This made her very much ashamed, and she ran away and hid herself.

 But after a while she realized that her long hair was beautiful, and
then she felt <span id="page_7">p. 7</span> very proud and scorned all
the short-haired women, jeering at them. When they saw this, they were
consumed with jealousy, and began to be ashamed of their short hair. “We
have men’s hair,” they said to one another. “How beautiful it would be
to have long hair!”

 So one by one they jumped into the pit, and their friends pulled them
out by the hair.

 And in this way they, and all women after them, had long hair.
