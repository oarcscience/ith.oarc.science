# PART I

### CHAPTER I:

### Greek Philosophy is Stolen Egyptian Philosophy.

#### 1. The Teachings of the Egyptian Mysteries Reached Other Lands Many Centuries Before It Reached Athens.

<span class="smallcaps">According</span> to history, Pythagoras after
receiving his training in Egypt, returned to his native island, Samos,
where he established his order for a short time, after which he migrated
to Croton (540 B.C.) in Southern Italy, where his order grew to enormous
proportions, until his final expulsion from that country. We are also
told that Thales (640 B.C.) who had also received his education in
Egypt, and his associates: Anaximander, and Anaximenes, were natives of
Ionia in Asia Minor, which was a stronghold of the Egyptian Mystery
schools, which they carried on. (Sandford's *The Mediterranean World*,
p. 195–205). Similarly, we are told that Xenophanes (576 B.C.),
Parmenides, Zeno and Melissus were also natives of Ionia and that they
migrated to Elea in Italy and established themselves and spread the
teachings of the Mysteries.

In like manner we are informed that Heraclitus (530 B.C.), Empedocles,
Anaxagoras and Democritus were also natives of Ionia who were interested
in physics. Hence in tracing the course of the so-called Greek
philosophy, we find that Ionian students after obtaining their education
from the Egyptian priests returned to their native land, while some of
them migrated to different parts of Italy, where they established
themselves.

Consequently, history makes it clear that the surrounding neighbours of
Egypt had all become familiar with the teachings of Egyptian Mysteries
many centuries before the Athenians,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

who in 399 B.C. sentenced Socrates to death (Zeller's *Hist. of Phil.*,
p. 112; 127; 170–172) and subsequently caused Plato and Aristotle to
flee for their lives from Athens, because philosophy was something
foreign and unknown to them. For this same reason, we would expect
either the Ionians or the Italians to exert their prior claim to
philosophy, since it made contact with them long before it did with the
Athenians, who were always its greatest enemies, until Alexander's
conquest of Egypt, which provided for Aristotle free access to the
Library of Alexandria.

The Ionians and Italians made no attempt to claim the authorship of
philosophy, because they were well aware that the Egyptians were the
true authors. On the other hand, after the death of Aristotle, his
Athenian pupils, without the authority of the state, undertook to
compile a history of philosophy, recognized at that time as the Sophia
or Wisdom of the Egyptians, which had become current and traditional in
the ancient world, which compilation, because it was produced by pupils
who had belonged to Aristotle's school, later history has erroneously
called Greek philosophy, in spite of the fact that the Greeks were its
greatest enemies and persecutors, and had persistently treated it as a
foreign innovation. For this reason, the so-called Greek philosophy is
stolen Egyptian philosophy, which first spread to Ionia, thence to Italy
and thence to Athens. And it must be remembered that at this remote
period of Greek history, i.e., Thales to Aristotle 640 B.C.–322 B.C.,
the Ionians were not Greek citizens, but at first Egyptian subjects and
later Persian subjects.

B. D. Alexander's Hist. of Phil.: p. 13; 21.

Sandford's The Mediterranean World p. 157; 195–205.

A brief sketch of the ancient Egyptian Empire would also make it clear
that Asia Minor or Ionia was the ancient land of

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

the Hittites, who were not known by any other name in ancient days.

According to Diodorus and Manetho, High Priest in Egypt, two columns
were found at Nysa Arabia; one of the Goddess Isis and the other of the
God Osiris, on the latter of which the God declared that he had led an
army into India, to the sources of the Danube, and as far as the ocean.
This means of course, that the Egyptian Empire, at a very early date,
included not only the islands of the Aegean sea and Ionia, but also
extended to the extremities of the East.

We are also informed that Senusert I, during the 12th Dynasty (i.e.,
about 1900 B.C.) conquered the whole sea coast of India, beyond the
Ganges to the Eastern ocean. He is also said to have included the
Cyclades and a great part of Europe in his conquests.

Secondly, the "Amarna Letters" found in the government offices of the
Egyptian King, Iknaton, testify to the fact, that the Egyptian Empire
had extended to western Asia, Syria and Palestine, and that for
centuries Egyptian power had been supreme in the ancient world. This was
in the 18th Dynasty i.e., about 1500 B.C.

We are also told that during the reign of Tuthmosis III, the dominion of
Egypt extended not only along the coast of Palestine: but also from
Nubia to Northern Asia.

(Breadsted's Conquest of Civilization p. 84; Diodorus 128; Manetho;
Strabo; Dicaearchus; John Kendrick's Ancient Egypt vol. I).

#### 2. The Authorship of the Individual Doctrines Is Extremely Doubtful.

As one attempts to read the history of Greek philosophy, one discovers a
complete absence of essential information concerning the early life and
training of the so-called Greek philosophers, from Thales to Aristotle.
No writer or historian professes to know anything about their early
education. All they tell us about them consists of (a) a doubtful date
and

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

place of birth and (b) their doctrines; but the world is left to wonder
who they were and from what source they got their early education, and
would naturally expect that men who rose to the position of a Teacher
among relatives, friends and associates, would be well-known, not only
by them, but by the whole community.

On the contrary, men who might well be placed among the earliest
Teachers in history, who had grown up from childhood to manhood, and had
taught pupils, are represented as unknown, being without any domestic,
social or early educational traces.

This is unbelievable, and yet it is a fact that the history of Greek
philosophy has presented to the world a number of men whose lives it
knows little or nothing about; but expects the world to accept them as
the true authors of the doctrines which are alleged to be theirs.

In the absence of essential evidence, the world hesitates to recognise
them as such, because the truth of this whole matter of Greek philosophy
points to a very different direction.

The Book on nature entitled *peri physeos* was the common name under
which Greek students interested in nature-study wrote. The earliest copy
is said to date back to the sixth century B.C. and it is customary to
refer to the remnants of peri physeos as the Fragments. (William
Turner's History of Philosophy p. 62). We do not believe that genuine
Initiates produced the Book on nature, since this was contrary to the
rules of the Egyptian Mysteries, in connexion with which the
Philosophical Schools conducted their work. Egypt was the centre of the
body of ancient wisdom, and knowledge, religious, philosophical and
scientific spread to other lands through student Initiates. Such
teachings remained for generations and centuries in the form of
tradition, until the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, and the
movement of Aristotle and his school to compile Egyptian teaching and
claim

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

it as Greek Philosophy. (Ancient Mysteries by C. H. Vail p. 16.)

Consequently, as a source of authority of authorships, peri physeos, is
of little value, if any, since history mentions only four names as
authors of it, namely, Anaximander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras;
and asks the world to accept their authorship of philosophy, because
Theophrastus, Sextus, Proclus and Simplicius, of the school at
Alexandria are said to have preserved small remnants of it (the
Fragments). If peri physeos is the criterion to the authorship of Greek
Philosophy, then it falls short in its purpose by a long way, since only
four philosophers are alleged to have written this book, and to have
remnants of their work. According to this idea all the other
philosophers, who failed to write peri physeos and to have remnants of
it, also failed to write Greek philosophy. This is the reductio ad
absurdum to which peri physeos leads us.

The schools of philosophy, Chaldean, Greek and Persian, were part of the
Ancient Mystery System of Egypt. They were conducted in secrecy
according to the demands of the Osiriaca, whose teachings became common
to all the schools. In keeping with the demands for secrecy, the writing
and publication of teachings were strictly forbidden and consequently,
Initiates who had developed satisfactorily in their training, and had
been advanced to the rank of Master or Teacher, refrained from
publishing the teachings of the Mysteries or philosophy.

Consequently any publication of philosophy could not have come from the
pen of the original philosophers themselves, but either from their close
friends who knew their views, as in the case of Pythagoras and Socrates,
or from interested persons who made a record of those philosophical
teachings that had become popular opinion and tradition. There is no
wonder then, that in the absence of original authorship, history has had
to resort to the strategy of accepting Aristotle's opinion as the sole
authority in determining the authorship of Greek Philosophy
(Introduction to Alfred Weber's History of Philosophy). It is for these
reasons that great doubt surrounds the so-called

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Greek authorship
of philosophy. (William Turner's History of Philosophy p. 35; 39; 47;
53; 62; 79; 210–211; 627. Ancient Mysteries by C. H. Vail p. 16.
Theophrastus: Fragment 2 apud Diels. Introduction to Alfred Weber's
History of Philosophy.)

#### 3. The Chronology of Greek Philosophers Is Mere Speculation.

History knows nothing about the early life and training of the Greek
philosophers and this is true not only of the pre-Socratic philosophers:
but also of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, who appear in history about
the age of eighteen and begin to teach at forty.

As a body of men they were undesirable to the state, (personae non
gratae) and were consequently persecuted and driven into hiding and
secrecy. Under such circumstances they kept no records of their
activities and this was done in order to conceal their identity. After
the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, and the seizure and
looting of the Royal Library at Alexandria, Aristotle's plan to usurp
Egyptian philosophy, was subsequently carried out by members of his
school: Theophrastus, Andronicus of Rhodes and Eudemus, who soon found
themselves confronted with the problem of a chronology for a history of
philosophy. (Introduction of Zeller's Hist. of Phil. p. 13).

Throughout this effort there has been much speculation concerning the
date of birth of philosophers, whom the public knew very little about.
As early as the third century B.C. (274–194 B.C.) Eratosthenes, a Stoic
drew up a chronology of Greek philosophers and in the second century
B.C. (140) Apollodorus also drew up another. The effort continued, and
in the first century B.C. (60–70 B.C.) Andronicus, the eleventh Head of
the Peripatetic school, also drew up another.

This difficulty continued throughout the early centuries, and has come
down to the present time for it appears that all modern writers on Greek
Philosophy are unable to agree on

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

the dates that should be assigned to the nativity of the philosophers.
The only exception appears to occur with reference to the three Athenian
philosophers, i.e., Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, the date of whose
nativity is believed to be certain, and concerning which there is
general agreement among historians.

However, when we come to deal with the pre-Socratic philosophers, we are
confronted with confusion and uncertainty, and a few examples would
serve to illustrate the untrustworthy nature of the chronology of Greek
Philosophers.

\(1\) Diogenes Laertius places the birth of Thales at 640 B.C., while
William Turner's History of Philosophy places it as 620 B.C.; that of
Frank Thilly at 624 B.C.; that of A. K. Rogers at early in the sixth
century B.C.; and that of W. G. Tennemann at 600 B.C.

\(2\) Diogenes Laertius places the birth of Anaximenes at 546 B.C.;
while W. Windelbrand places it at the sixth century B.C.; that of Frank
Thilly at 588 B.C.; that of B. D. Alexander at 560 B.C.; while that of
A. K. Rogers at the sixth century B.C.

\(3\) Parmenides is credited by Diogenes as being born at 500 B.C.;
while Fuller, Thilly and Rogers omit a date of birth, because they say
it is unknown.

\(4\) Zeller places the birth of Xenophanes at 576 B.C.; while Diogenes
gives 570 B C.; and the majority of the other historians declare that
the date of birth is unknown.

\(5\) With reference to Xeno, Diogenes who does not know the date of his
birth, says that he flourished between B.C. 464–460; while William
Turner places it at 490 B.C.; like Frank Thilly and B. D. Alexander;
while Fuller, A. K. Rogers and W. G. Tennemann declare it is unknown.

\(6\) With references to Heraclitus, Zeller makes the following
suppositions: if he died in 475 B.C. and if he was sixty years old when
he died, then he must have been born in 535 B.C.; similarly Diogenes
supposes that he flourished between B.C. 504–500; and while William
Turner places his birth at 530 B.C.; Windelbrand places it at 536 B.C.;
and

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fuller and
Tennemann declare that he flourished in 500 B.C.

\(7\) With reference to Pythagoras, Zeller who does not know the date of
his birth supposes that it occurred between the years 580–570 B.C.; and
while Diogenes also supposes that it occurred between the years 582–500
B.C.; William Turner, Fuller, Rogers, and Tennemann declare that it is
unknown.

\(8\) With reference to Empedocles, while Diogenes places his birth at
484 B.C.; Turner, Windelbrand, Fuller, B. D. Alexander and Tennemann
place it at 490 B.C.; while A. K. Rogers and others declare it is
unknown.

\(9\) With reference to Anaxagoras, while Zeller and Diogenes place his
birth at 500 B.C.; William Turner, A. G. Fuller, and Frank Thilly agree
with them, while Alexander places it at 450 B.C. and A. K. Rogers and
others declare it is unknown.

\(10\) With reference to Leucippus, all historians seem to be of the
opinion that he has never existed.

\(11\) Socrates (469–399 B.C.), Plato (427–347 B.C.), and Aristotle
(384–322 B.C.) are the only three philosophers the dates of whose
nativity and death do not seem to have led to speculation among
historians; but the reason for this uniformity is probably clue to the
fact that they were Athenians and had been indicted by the Athenian
Government who would naturally have investigated them and kept a record
of their cases. (A. K. Roger's Hist. of Phil. p. 104).

*N.B.*

It must be noted from the preceding comparative study of the chronology
of Greek philosophers that (a) the variation in dates points to
speculation (b) the pre-Socratic philosophers were unknown because they
were foreigners to the Athenian Government and probably never existed
(c) it follows that both the pre-Socratic philosophers together with
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were persecuted by the Athenian Government
tor introducing foreign doctrines into Athens. (d) In consequence of
these facts, any subsequent claim by the

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Greeks to the
ownership or authorship of the same doctrines which they had rejected
and persecuted, must be regarded as a usurpation.

#### 4. The Compilation of the History of Greek Philosophy Was the Plan of Aristotle Executed by His School.

When Aristotle decided to compile a history of Greek Philosophy he must
have made known his wishes to his pupils Theophrastus and Eudemus: for
no sooner did he produce his metaphysics, than Theophrastus followed him
by publishing eighteen books on the doctrines of the physicists.
Similarly, after Theophrastus had published his doctrines of the
physicists, Eudemus produced separate histories of Arithmetic, Geometry,
Astronomy and also theology. This was an amazing start, because of the
large number of scientific books, and the wide range of subjects
treated. This situation has rightly aroused the suspicion of the world,
as it questions the source of these scientific works.

Since Theophrastus and Eudemus were students under Aristotle at the same
time, and since the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, made the
Egyptian Library at Alexandria available to the Greeks for research,
then it must be expected that the three men, Aristotle who was a close
friend of Alexander, Theophrastus and Eudemus not only did research at
the Alexandrine Library at the sane time, but must also have helped
themselves to books, which enabled them to follow each other so closely
in the production of scientific works (William Turner's Hist. of Phil.
p. 158–159), which were either a portion of the war booty taken from the
Library or compilations from them. (Note that Aristotle's works reveal
the signs of note taking and that Theophrastus and Eudemus were pupils
attending Aristotle's school at the same time). William Turner's Hist.
of Phil. p. 127.

Just here it might be as well to mention the names of Aristotle's pupils
who took an active part in promoting the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

movement towards the compilation of a history of Greek philosophy:

\(a\) Theophrastus of Lesbos 371–286 B.C., who succeeded Aristotle as
head of the peripatetic school. As elsewhere mentioned, he is said to
have produced eighteen books on the doctrines of physicists. Who were
these physicists? Greek or Egyptians? Just think of it.

\(b\) Eudemus of Rhodes a contemporary of Theophrastus with whom he also
attended Aristotle's school. He is said to have produced histories of
Arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and theology, as elsewhere mentioned.
What was the source of the data of the histories of these sciences,
which must have taken any nation thousands of years to develop? Greece
or Egypt? Just think of it.

\(c\) Andronicus of Rhodes, an Eclectic of Aristotle's school and editor
of his works (B.C. 70).

These men's works together with Aristotle's metaphysics, which contained
a critical summary of the doctrines of all preceding philosophers, seem
to form the nucleus of a compilation of what has been called, the
history of Greek philosophy (Zeller's Hist. of Greek Phil.: Introduction
p. 7–14).

The next movement was the organization of an association called "The
learned study of Aristotle's Writings", whose members were Theophrastus
and Andronicus, who were both closely connected with the school of
Aristotle. The function of this association was to identify the
literature and doctrines of philosophy with their so-called respective
authors, and in order to accomplish this the alumni of Aristotle's
school and its friends were encouraged to enter upon a research for
Aristotle's works and to write commentaries on them.

In addition to this, the Learned Association also encouraged research
for the recovery of what has been named Fragments or remnants of a book,
which is supposed to have once existed, and to have borne the common
title "*Peri Physeos*", i.e., concerning nature.

Here again those who went out in search of "peri physeos"

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

or its remnants were the alumni of Aristotle's school and its friends:
but their efforts to establish authorship was a failure.

\(a\) Theophrastus found only two lines of peri physeos, supposed to
have been written by Anaximander.

\(b\) Sextus and Proclus of the fifth century A.D., and Simplicius of
the sixth century A.D. are said to have found a copy of "peri physeos"
supposed to have been produced by Parmenides.

\(c\) In addition, the name of Simplicius is also associated with a copy
of "peri physeos", which is supposed to have been produced by
Anaxagoras.

So much for "peri physeos and the Fragments," and so much for the
attempt of "The Learned Association" for the study of Aristotle's works;
which has failed because of lack of evidence, as has elsewhere been
pointed out.

The recovery of two copies and two lines of "peri physeos" is not proof
that all Greek Philosophers wrote "peri physeos", or even that the names
assigned to them were their bona fide authors. It certainly would appear
that the object of the Learned Association was to beat Aristotle's own
drum and dance. It was Aristotle's idea to compile a history of
philosophy, and it was Aristotle's school and its alumni that carried
out the idea, we are told.
