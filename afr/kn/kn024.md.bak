### 16. CONCERNING RÔBÊL (REUBEN)

And after him, Jacob's firstborn son transgressed the commandment of
God, and the kingdom departed from him and from his seed, because he had
defiled his father's wife <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md); now it is
not right to transgress the law which God hath commanded. And his father
cursed him, and God was wroth with him, and he became the least among
his brethren, and his children became leprous and scabby; and although
he was the firstborn son \[of Jacob\] the kingdom was rent from
him. <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md) And his younger brother
reigned, and he was called Judah because of this. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md) And his seed was blessed, and his kingdom
flourished, and his sons were blessed. And after him Fârês (Pharez) his
son reigned. And he died and ’Isârôm (Hezron) his son reigned. And after
him his son ’Orni (Oren <span id="fr_44"></span>[4](#fn_44)?.md) reigned,
and after him Arâm (Aram <span id="fr_45"></span>[5](#fn_45).md) his son
reigned, and after him Amînâdab his son reigned, and after him Nasôn
(Naasson) his son reigned, and after him Sâlâ (Salmon?) his son reigned,
and after him Bâ‘ôs (Boaz) his son reigned, and after him ’Iyûbêd (Obed)
his son reigned, and after him Ĕ’sêy (Jesse) his son reigned. And this
is what I say \[concerning\] the kingdom: The blessing of the father
\[was\] on the son,

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

so that it (*i.e.*, the kingdom) was blessed with prosperity. And as for
the kingship over Israel, after the death of Jesse David reigned in
righteousness, and in integrity, and in graciousness.
