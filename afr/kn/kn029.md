### 21. CONCERNING THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH

And how this Queen was born I have discovered written in that
manuscript, and in this manner also Both the Evangelist mention that
woman. And our Lord Jesus Christ, in condemning the Jewish people, the
crucifiers, who lived at that time, spake, saying: "The Queen of the

the preaching of My word, for she came from the ends of the earth to
hear the wisdom of Solomon." <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48) And the
Queen of the South of whom He spake was the Queen of Ethiopia. And in
the words "ends of the earth" \[He maketh allusion\] to the delicacy of
the constitution of women, and the long distance of the journey, and the
burning heat of the sun, and the hunger on the way, and the thirst for
water. And this Queen of the South was very beautiful in face, and her
stature was superb, and her understanding and intelligence, which God
had given her, were of such high character that she went to Jerusalem to
hear the wisdom of Solomon; now this was done by the command of God and
it was His good pleasure. And moreover, she was exceedingly rich, for
God had given her glory, and riches, and gold, and silver, and splendid
apparel, and camels, and slaves, and trading men (or, merchants). And
they carried on her business and trafficked for her by sea and by land,
and in India, and in ’Aswân (Syene).
