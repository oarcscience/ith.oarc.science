### 107. CONCERNING HIS ENTRANCE INTO JERUSALEM IN GLORY

And the Prophets have prophesied concerning His glorious entry into
Jerusalem, and Isaiah the Prophet said, "Shine thou, shine thou,
Jerusalem, thy light hath come and the glory of God hath risen upon
thee." <span id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_237)

Thus the Prophet Zechariah prophesied and said, "Rejoice, rejoice,
daughter of Zion, and let Jerusalem shout for joy." <span
id="fr_238"></span>[2](#fn_238)

Thus David prophesied and said, "Out of the mouth of children and babes
Thou hast prepared praise because of the enemy, so that Thou mightest
overthrow the enemy and the avenger." <span
id="fr_239"></span>[3](#fn_239)

Thus Solomon prophesied and said, "The children are taught by God, and
the peoples rejoice within thee." <span id="fr_240"></span>[4](#fn_240)

Thus David his father prophesied and said, "Blow ye the horn in Zion, on
the day of the new moon, on the appointed day of our festival, for it is
an ordinance for Israel." <span id="fr_241"></span>[5](#fn_241)

Thus Ezra the Scribe prophesied and said, "Get ye out, make ye a
festival in gladness, and say unto the daughter of Zion, Rejoice thou,
behold thy King hath come." <span id="fr_242"></span>[6](#fn_242)

Thus Isaiah the Prophet prophesied and said, "Rejoice thou, Jerusalem,
rejoice thou. Behold, thy King hath come riding upon an ass. His reward
is with Him, and His work is before His face." <span
id="fr_243"></span>[7](#fn_243)

Thus David the Prophet prophesied and said, "Blessed is He who cometh in
the name of the Lord." <span id="fr_244"></span>[8](#fn_244)

Thus Jacob the son of Isaac prophesied and said, "Judah, thy brethren
have praised thee. Thine hand is upon the back of thine enemy, and the
children of thy mother shall worship thee. And the dominion

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

shall not diminish from Judah, and the government shall not depart from
his kin, until he shall find Him Who hath been waited for, and Who is
the Hope of the nations." <span id="fr_245"></span>[1](#fn_245) And he
also prophesied and said, "His teeth are white as with snow, and His
eyes are glad as with wine, and He shall wash His apparel in wine and
said, "His tunic in the blood of clusters of grapes." <span
id="fr_246"></span>[2](#fn_246) And again he prophesied, saying, "Judah
is a lion's whelp; thou hast lain down, and thou hast slept; no one
shall wake him up except him that hunteth until he findeth him; rise up
from thy strong place." <span id="fr_247"></span>[3](#fn_247) And again
Jacob blessed his son Judah, and said unto him, "There is a King who
shall go forth from thee and shall wash His apparel in wine, and
glorious is the place of rest of the Beloved"; now, by "Beloved" Christ
is meant, and by "Messiah" Christ is meant, and Jesus meaneth "Saviour
of the people." Now the Prophets mention Christ under a secret name and
they call Him "the Beloved."

And Isaiah spake concerning His Ascension in his prophecy, saying, "On
that day the Beloved shall come down from heaven, and shall choose for
Himself twelve Apostles." <span id="fr_248"></span>[4](#fn_248) And
again he said, "I have seen the ascension of the beloved Son to the
seventh heaven, and the Angels and the Archangels receiving Him, He
being very much higher than they."

And David said, "The beloved is like the son of the unicorn " <span
id="fr_249"></span>[5](#fn_249); and again he said, "And thine only one
from the horns of the unicorn." <span id="fr_250"></span>[6](#fn_250)
And again he said, "Let my horn be exalted like that of the
unicorn." <span id="fr_251"></span>[7](#fn_251) "Horns" meaneth the
kingdoms of the world; and "unicorn" meaneth He Who is over His kingdom
Whom no one can resist, for He is the governor of

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

kings; He destroyeth whom He will and He setteth up him whom He will.
Even as David saith, "I will make thee to rejoice more than those who
are mighty through their horns," <span id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_252)
which meaneth, "Thou art nobler than the noble kings, and thou dost
rejoice."

And Habakkuk prophesied, saying, "Horns are in his hands, <span
id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_253) and he hath placed the beloved in the
strength of his power," which meaneth, "The palms of the hand, wherein
the life of all is held, of the holder of the dominion of kings, are
pierced with nails, which Christ, the beloved, hath endured in the
strength of His might."
