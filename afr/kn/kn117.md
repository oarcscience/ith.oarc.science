### 109. CONCERNING HIS CRUCIFIXION

And the Prophets also prophesied concerning the Crucifixion of Christ.

Thus Moses, the servant of God, prophesied and said, "Ye shall see your
salvation crucified upon the wood, and shall not believe."

Thus David prophesied and said, "Many dogs have seized Me; and they
drove nails through My hands and

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> My feet; and they
counted all My bones; though they knew Me they despised Me; and they
divided My garments among themselves; and they cast lots for My
apparel." <span id="fr_273"></span>[1](#fn_273)

Thus Isaiah prophesied concerning the Incarnation and Crucifixion of
Christ, and said, "Who believeth our word, and to whom is the arm of the
Lord revealed? And we spake like a child before Him: and He is like a
root in parched ground, He hath no beauty and no form; and His form is
more rejected and abased than \[that of\] any man. He is a broken man
and a man of suffering; for He hath turned away His face, and they treat
Him with contempt and esteem Him as nothing." <span
id="fr_274"></span>[2](#fn_274)

Thus Solomon prophesied and said, "Let us kill the righteous man, for he
is a burden unto us; he setteth himself up against our works, he
resisteth our intentions continually, and we are an abomination unto him
because of our sins." <span id="fr_275"></span>[3](#fn_275) And he
continued, saying, "My son, let not wicked men lead thee astray; if they
say unto thee, 'Come with us, be a partner with us, let us hide innocent
blood and take plunder from him; and let there be one purse common to us
all': withdraw thyself from their footsteps, for let it not be through
thee that the birds find the net." <span id="fr_276"></span>[4](#fn_276)

Thus David prophesied and said, "They cast gall into My meat, and they
gave Me vinegar to drink to \[quench\] My thirst." <span
id="fr_277"></span>[5](#fn_277)

Thus prophesied Isaiah the Prophet and said, "He hath taken our disease
and carried our sickness, and by His wound we are healed; and we saw Him
suffering, and wounded in his pain; and He opened not His mouth in His
pain, and He came to be slaughtered; like a lamb before his shearer He
opened not His mouth in

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> His suffering
until they took away His life; and they knew not His birth; through the
sin of My people have I come even unto death." <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](kn118.htm#fn_278)

Thus Jeremiah the Prophet prophesied and said, "And they took the price
of the honourable one thirty \[pieces of\] silver, whom they had
honoured among the children of Israel. And God said unto me, Cast it
into the melting pot, and test it \[and see\] if it be pure; and they
gave it for the field of the potter; as God hath commanded me I will
speak." <span id="fr_279"></span>[2](kn118.htm#fn_279)

Thus Isaiah the Prophet prophesied and said, "They counted Him with the
sinners, and brought Him to death." <span
id="fr_280"></span>[3](kn118.htm#fn_280)

Thus David the Prophet prophesied and said, "Those who hate Me
wrongfully are many, and they have rewarded Me with evil for
good." <span id="fr_281"></span>[4](kn118.htm#fn_281)

Thus Zechariah the Prophet prophesied and said, "And they shall look
upon Him Whom they have crucified and pierced." <span
id="fr_282"></span>[5](kn118.htm#fn_282)

Now there are still very many passages which have been written and many
prophecies which might be mentioned concerning His coming, and His
Crucifixion, and His death, and His Resurrection, and His second coming
in glory. But we have only mentioned a few of the prophecies of the
prophets—we have mentioned one of each kind—so that ye may hear, and
believe, and understand, even as it is said in the Acts of the Apostles,
"By the Gospel Thou hast guided us, and by the Prophets Thou hast
comforted us; for the words of the Prophets make right the faith of
those who doubt." <span id="fr_283"></span>[6](kn118.htm#fn_283)
