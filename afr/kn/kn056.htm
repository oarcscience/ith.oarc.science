And he raised up Az&acirc;ry&acirc;s and said unto him, "Stand up, be strong, and rouse up thy brother &Ecirc;lm&#277;y&acirc;s, and &#8217;Ab&#277;s&acirc;, and M&acirc;kar&icirc;, and take the pieces of wood and I will open for thee the doors of the sanctuary. And take thou the Tabernacle of the Law of God, and thou shalt carry it without trouble and discomfort. And I, inasmuch as I have been commanded by God to be with it for ever, will be thy guide when thou shalt carry it away."</p>

And they took lamps and set them in the place where [Zion] was hidden, and they sacrificed the sheep thereto, and burned offerings of incense thereto, and they spread purple cloths over it and set it in a secret place for seven days and seven nights.</p>
