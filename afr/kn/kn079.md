### 71. CONCERNING MARY, THE DAUGHTER OF DAVID

And from this it is evident that Mary was the daughter of David, and
that Joseph was the son of David. Therefore was Mary betrothed to Joseph
her kinsman, as it is said in the Gospel, "O Joseph, son of David, fear
thou not to take to wife Mary thy betrothed, for that which is to be
born of her is of the Holy Spirit, the Word of God." <span
id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md) And there was born of her God, the Word,
Light of Light, God of God, Son of the Father, Who came and delivered
His creation; from the hand of Sheôl, and from Satan, and from death He
hath delivered all of us who have believed in Him, He hath drawn us to
His Father and hath raised us up into heaven His throne to become His
heirs; for He is a lover of man, and unto Him praise belongeth for ever.
Amen.
