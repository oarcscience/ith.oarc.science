### 75. CONCERNING THE KING OF BABYLON

Now the King of Babylon is of the seed of Shem, and we will show you
clearly that the King of Babylon is of the seed of Shem. It came to pass
in days of old that there lived in the kingdom of Manasseh, the King of
Israel, a certain man whose name was Karmîn, and he was a fearer of God,
and he gave many alms and oblations to the poor of Israel. And when he
made offerings to the house of God, he did so with sincerity, and his
tithe he gave twofold; and he was good in all his ways, and there was no
evil whatsoever before him. And Satan, the enemy of all good, became
envious of him, for he saw that his course of life was good. And that
man was exceedingly rich in camels and horses, and flocks of sheep, and
herds of cattle, and gold and silver, and fine apparel, and he used to
feed the mule of the king in ’Armâtêm, a city of Israel. Now his native
place was the country of Judah, his fathers’ portion, but because of
this love for wealth he departed into ’Armâtêm to dwell there, and
Israel allowed him to settle

there because of his riches; for he was exceedingly rich and had many
possessions, and the governors \[of Judah\] were afraid of him.
