### 111. CONCERNING HIS ASCENSION AND HIS SECOND COMING

Thus all the Prophets and many of the early Fathers prophesied
concerning His Ascension and His Second Coming to judge the living and
the dead.

And David said concerning His Resurrection, "He hath gone up into the
heights. Thou hast made captive captivity, and hast given grace to the
children of men." <span id="fr_292"></span>[9](#fn_292.md) And he also
said, "Having gone forth, I will

come back, and I will return from the abyss of the sea." <span
id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_293.md) And again he said, "Sing ye unto God Who
hath gone up into the heavens, the heavens which are opposite the
morning." <span id="fr_294"></span>[2](#fn_294.md)

Thus Amos the Prophet prophesied and said, "The Messiah, Who made the
time of the morning, hath come and is exalted from the earth into the
heights: and His Name is God Who ruleth all things." <span
id="fr_295"></span>[3](#fn_295.md)

Thus prophesied David the Prophet and said, "Thou art exalted, O Lord,
by Thy might, and we will praise and hymn Thy strength." <span
id="fr_296"></span>[4](#fn_296.md)

Thus prophesied Zechariah the Prophet and said, "His foot standeth on
the Mount of Olives to the east of Jerusalem. And He rideth upon the
Cherubim, and He flieth upon the wing of the winds." <span
id="fr_297"></span>[5](#fn_297.md)

Thus David said, "Open ye the gates of the princes, and let the doors
which were from the creation be opened, and the King of glory shall
come! Who is this King of glory? God, the mighty and strong One, God,
the mighty One in battle." And he also made known and said, "Open ye the
gates of princes, and let the doors which were from the creation be
opened, and the King of glory shall come! Who is this King of glory? The
Lord God of Hosts is this King." <span id="fr_298"></span>[6](#fn_298.md)

And again concerning His coming—He shall judge the living and the
dead—He to Whom belongeth glory for ever and ever. Amen.

Thus Zechariah the Prophet prophesied and said, "That day the Lord my
God shall come, and all His saints with Him." <span
id="fr_299"></span>[7](#fn_299.md)

Thus David the Prophet prophesied and said, "God spake once, and this
according \[to what\] I have heard: Compassion belongeth unto God. And
Thine, O Lord,

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

is the power, for Thou wilt reward every man according to his
work." <span id="fr_300"></span>[1](#fn_300.md)

Thus spake Daniel the Prophet and said, "I saw in my vision by night,
and behold, there came \[one\] like unto the Son of man to the Ancient
of Days, and there were given unto him dominion, and glory, and
sovereignty, and all the nations and peoples and countries shall serve
Him, and His dominion shall have no end for ever and ever. Amen." <span
id="fr_301"></span>[2](#fn_301.md)

And all the Prophets prophesied, and nothing that hath happened hath
been without the prophecy of the Prophets. And they have declared
everything that hath happened, and what shall happen, what hath been
done and what shall be done, and that which belongeth to the times of
old and that which belongeth to the latter days up to His Second Coming.
And this they have done not only by what they have prophesied and
declared, but together with their prophecies they have given
manifestations of Him in their bodies. And there was a famine in the
land of Canaan, and our father Abraham went down to Egypt, and came back
with much riches and honour without blemish. And in like manner our
Redeemer went down and delivered the Church, the Assembly of the
Nations, and He went up \[again\], having gotten honour and praise.
