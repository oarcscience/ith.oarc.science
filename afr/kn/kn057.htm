And my Lady Zion, the holy and heavenly, the Tabernacle of the Law of God, shall be a guide unto thee at ail times, a guide in respect of what thou shouldst think in thy heart and shouldst do with thy fingers, whether it be far or near to thee, whether it be low or high to thee, whether it be strong or weak to thee, whether it be outside or inside thee, whether it be to thee in the house or in the field, whether it be visible or invisible to thee, whether it be away from or near to thee, whether it be hidden from or revealed to thee, whether it be secret or published abroad to thee&#8212;unto thee our Lady Zion, the holy and heavenly, the pure Tabernacle of the Law of God, shall be a guide." And David was blessed, and he made obeisance, and departed.</p>
