### 66. CONCERNING THE PROPHECY OF CHRIST

Now, according to the interpretation of prophecy, the name Solomon
signified in the secret speech "Christ." And as Solomon built the house
of God, so Christ raised up His Body and made it into the Church. And
when He said unto the Jews, "Throw down this house, and in three days I
will build it up \[again\]," <span id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_88.md) He
spake to them of the house of His Body. And as Solomon multiplied wives
from alien peoples because of their beauty and winsomeness, and desires
\[arose\] in him in his feigning love \[for them\], so Christ gathered
together from alien peoples those who had not the Law, but who believed
on Him. And there was no uncircumcised man to Him, and no pagan; and
there was no slave, and no Jew, and no servant and no free man <span
id="fr_89"></span>[3](#fn_89.md); but He gathered them all into His
heavenly kingdom by His Flesh and Blood. And in the Song of Songs
Solomon himself sang and said, "There are sixty mighty men round about
the bed of Solomon, all of them trained in war and holding swords, each
man with his sword upon his thigh." <span id="fr_90"></span>[4](#fn_90.md)
The number sixty indicated the number of the righteous Patriarchs, and
the Prophets, and the Apostles, and the Martyrs, and the Believers, and
the Saints, and the Monks who have resisted the evil thought and the war
of Satan. And the word "sword" is, being interpreted, the word of the
Scriptures. The word of the Lord cutteth like a straight sharp razor,
and in like manner the Scriptures cut from men's hearts the danger
caused by lying dreams by

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

night. And the words "bed of Solomon" are, being interpreted, the Church
of Christ.

And again Solomon sang, saving, "King Solomon hath made a litter for
himself," <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md) and these words are to be
interpreted that Christ hath put on our body. The name Solomon in the
language of the Hebrews is, being interpreted, "Christ." And the foolish
Jews imagine that the words of David, "The Lord said unto me, 'Thou art
my son and I this day have begotten thee,'" <span
id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md) were spoken concerning Solomon his son. "O
God, give Thy judgment to the king, and Thy righteousness to the son of
the king, so that he may judge thy people with righteousness and thy
needy ones with justice. And he shall live and they shall give him of
the gold of Arabia, and shall pray for him continually, and shall follow
him \[with good words\], and he shall be a support for the whole earth
on the tops of the mountains, and his fruit shall be greater than the
cedar, and he shall flourish in the city like the grass of the earth,
and his name shall be blessed for ever, and his name shall be before the
sun. I have brought thee forth from the belly before the Morning Star.
God hath sworn, and He will not repent, thou art His priest for ever,
after the appointment of Melchizedek." <span
id="fr_93"></span>[3](#fn_93.md)

And concerning this prophecy and others like thereunto, which David
prophesied concerning Christ, the foolish Jews, who are blind of heart,
say that what David said in the beginning of his book was spoken
concerning his son Solomon; this do the Jews say, and they make Christ
to be Solomon because of the similarity of name, and the wisdom, and
because He was the Son of David in the flesh. And although those who
came after David and Solomon, namely Elijah and Elisha, knew this, they
ascribed Solomon's sin to him in the Book of Kings in order that they
might put to

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

shame the Jews, who are blinded in heart and the enemies of
righteousness. And Solomon the King, the son of David the King and
Prophet, was himself also King and Prophet, and he prophesied many
similitudes concerning Christ and concerning the Church, and he wrote
four books of prophecy, and is numbered with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
and David his father in the kingdom of the heavens.
