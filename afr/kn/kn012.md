### 4. CONCERNING ENVY

And when they had grown up together, Satan had envy of him, and he cast
this envy into the heart of Cain, who was envious \[of Abel\] first,
because of the words of his father Adam, who said, "He who hath the
good-tempered face shall be the heir of my kingdom"; and secondly,
because of his sister with the beautiful face, who was born with him and
who had been given unto Abel, even as God commanded them to multiply and
fill the earth—now the face of the sister who had been born with Abel
resembled that of Cain, and their father had transferred them (*i.e.*,
the two sisters) when giving them \[in marriage\];—and thirdly, because
when the two \[brothers\] offered up sacrifice, God accepted the
offering of Abel and rejected the offering of Cain. And because of this
envy Cain killed Abel. Thus fratricide was first created through Satan's
envy of the children of Adam. And having killed his brother, Cain fell
into a state of trembling and horrible fright, and he was repulsed by
his father and his Lord. And \[then\] Seth was born, and Adam

looked upon him and said, "Now hath God shown compassion upon me, and He
hath given unto me the light of my face. In sorrowful remembrance I will
console myself (?) with him. The name of him that shall slay my heir
shall be blotted out, even to his ninth generation."
