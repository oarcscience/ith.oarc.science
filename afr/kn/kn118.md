### 110. CONCERNING HIS RESURRECTION

And the prophet David also prophesied concerning His Resurrection and
said, "I will arise, saith the Lord,

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

and I will make salvation and manifest it openly." <span
id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_284.md) And again he saith, "Rise up, O Lord,
and judge the earth, for Thou shalt inherit among the nations." <span
id="fr_285"></span>[2](#fn_285.md) And he also prophesied and said, "Rise
up, O Lord, help us, and deliver us for Thy Name's sake." <span
id="fr_286"></span>[3](#fn_286.md) And again he said, "Let God arise and
let His enemies be scattered, and let His enemies flee from before His
face." <span id="fr_287"></span>[4](#fn_287.md) And he also prophesied and
said, "God hath risen up like one who hath woke up from sleep, and like
a mighty man who hath left \[his\] wine." <span
id="fr_288"></span>[5](#fn_288.md)

Thus Isaiah the prophet prophesied and said, "He will remove sickness
from his soul, for he hath not committed sin, and falsehood hath not
been found in his mouth. And to him that hath served righteousness and
good will he show light and he will justify him; and he shall do away
the sins of many, for he hath not committed sin, and falsehood is not
found in his mouth." <span id="fr_289"></span>[6](#fn_289.md)

Thus prophesied David the Prophet and said, "For My soul shall not be
left in hell." <span id="fr_290"></span>[7](#fn_290.md)

Thus Solomon his son prophesied and said, "The Sun of righteousness
shall arise, and shall travel towards the right, and shall return into
His place." <span id="fr_291"></span>[8](#fn_291.md)
