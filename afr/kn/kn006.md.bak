##### III.—<span class="smallcaps">Legends of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba in the Kur’ân and in Muhammadan Literature</span>

The author, or editor, of the Kur’ân devoted a considerable section of
Surah XXVII to the correspondence that passed between the Queen of Sheba
and King Solomon, and to their interviews. Among the many gifts that God
bestowed upon Solomon were the understanding of the speech of birds, and
knowledge of every kind. He was the lord of men, genii and birds. When
he travelled through the air on his magical carpet of green silk, which
was borne aloft by the wind according to the King's direction, the men
stood on the right of it, and the spirits on the left, and a vast army
of birds of every kind kept flying over the carpet to protect its
occupants from the heat of the sun. One day when he was reviewing the
birds he perceived that the lapwing was absent, and he asked why she was
absent, and threatened to punish her for not making her appearance with
the other birds. Very soon after he had spoken the lapwing appeared, and
she excused herself for her absence by saying that she had been looking
upon a

<span id="page_lvii">p. lvii</span>

country that the king had never seen, and that she had seen Sâba, which
was ruled over by a queen called "Balḳîs," who was very rich, and who
sat upon a throne made of gold and silver and set with precious stones,
eighty cubits long, forty cubits broad, and thirty cubits high. The
queen and her people were idolaters and worshipped the sun, and they
were under the influence of Satan, who had turned them from the right
way. Thereupon Solomon wrote the following letter to the Queen of Sheba:
"From the servant of God, Solomon, the son of David, unto Balḳîs (<span
id="img__05700"></span> ![](img/_05700.jpg)), Queen of Sheba. In the
Name of the most merciful God. Peace be unto him who followeth the true
direction. Rise not up against me, but come and render yourselves unto
me." Having perfumed this letter with musk and sealed it with his
wonderful seal, Solomon gave it to the lapwing and told the bird to go
and drop it in Sâba, and to turn aside afterwards and wait for the
Queen's answer. The lapwing departed and delivered the letter, some
saying that she flew into the Queen's private apartment through the
window, and others that she dropped the letter into the Queen's
bosom <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) as she was standing surrounded
by her army. Having read the letter the Queen called upon her nobles to
advise her what to do, but they reminded her that they were soldiers,
who were ready to march against Solomon if she ordered them to do so,
and that the letter was addressed to her and she must make the decision.
Wishing to avoid invasion and the evils that would follow in its train,
the Queen decided to send gifts to Solomon, and she despatched forthwith
five hundred male and five hundred female slaves, five hundred ingots of
gold, a crown studded with precious stones, and a large quantity of
musk, amber, spices,

<span id="page_lviii">p. lviii</span>

precious woods, etc. The lapwing returned quickly to Solomon and told
him what had happened, and that an embassy from the Queen bearing gifts
was on its way. When the men of Sâba arrived they were received by
Solomon in a large square surrounded by a wall, the bricks of which were
made of gold and silver. Solomon spoke slightingly of the Queen's gifts
and sent the embassy back, bidding them tell their mistress that he
would send invincible troops against her city, and that they would
capture it and expel its inhabitants in disgrace. When Balḳîs received
this message, she determined to go to Solomon and to tender her
submission to him, and having locked up her throne in a certain strong
fortress, and set a guard over it to protect it, she set out for
Jerusalem, accompanied by a large army. Whilst she was on her way
Solomon said one day to his nobles, Which of you will bring the Queen's
throne here to me before she and her company arrive? And an ‘Ifrît, one
of the genii, whose aspect was most terrible, and who was called
Dhakwân, <span id="img__05800"></span> ![](img/_05800.jpg); or <span
id="img__05801"></span> ![](img/_05801.jpg), said, I will bring it to
thee before thou hast finished thy session. Now Solomon used to sit in
judgment until noon daily. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) Some one
who had knowledge of books and who was present seemed to think that the
‘Ifrît was demanding too much time in which to fulfil the King's urgent
wish, and he said, I will bring thee the throne before thou canst cast
thine eyes on an object and remove them again. The commentators are in
doubt about the identity of the person who made this offer to Solomon,
for some say he was Âṣaf, the son of Barkhîyâ, the wazîr of Solomon, and
others that he was Khidhr (Elijah), or Gabriel, or some other angel, or
even Solomon himself. <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) It is
generally thought that the person was Âṣaf, for he knew the ineffable
Name of God. Be this as it may, Solomon accepted the offer,

<span id="page_lix">p. lix</span>

and raising his eyes to heaven brought them down quickly to earth again,
and when his eyes rested on the earth he saw the throne of Balḳîs
standing before him. Then Solomon had the throne altered, with the view
of preventing her knowing her own throne when she arrived. When Balḳîs
came into his presence, he pointed to the throne, saying, Is thy throne
like unto this? And she replied, It is all one with this. Then Balḳîs
was invited to go into the palace which Solomon had built specially for
her reception. The walls were made of blocks of white glass, and the
floor was made also of glass, over which water flowed, and in the
running water fishes swam. When Balḳîs turned to enter the palace and
saw the water, thinking that it was deep, she drew up the skirts of her
garments before attempting to walk through it. By this act she uncovered
her legs, and Solomon had proof that the rumour that the feet and legs
of Balḳîs were covered with hair like the coat of an ass, was true. The
sight of the glass building with its floor of glass amazed Balḳîs, who
said, O Lord, verily I have dealt unjustly with my own soul, and I
resign myself, together with Solomon, unto God, the Lord of all
creatures. Some commentators think that the Queen uttered these words
partly in repentance for having worshipped the sun, and partly through
fear of being drowned in the water which she saw before her. Jalâl
ad-Dîn says that Solomon thought of marrying Balḳîs, but could not bring
himself to do so because of the hair on her feet and legs. The devils
who were always in attendance on Solomon removed the hair by the use of
some infernal depilatory, <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) but it is
doubtful if even then Solomon married her. Al-Beidhawî says that it is
very doubtful who married Balḳîs, but is inclined to think that it was
one of the chiefs of the Hamdân tribe. <span
