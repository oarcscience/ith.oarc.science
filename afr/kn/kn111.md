### 103. CONCERNING THE HORNS OF THE ALTAR

Now, the Tabernacle symbolizeth the horns of the altar, where the holy
priests offer up sacrifice, whereon they place the *ṭarapîzâ*, (*i.e.*
table), the similitude of the grave wherein He (*i.e.* Christ) was
buried in Golgotha. And what is on the table, that is, the offering, is
a symbol of the firstling, that is to say, the Body of Emmanuel, \[or\]
"’Akrâṭôs," the "pure," the "unmixed," which our Saviour took from Mary,
of the which He said unto His holy Apostles, "Eat ye My Body <span
id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169); whosoever eateth not of My Body hath no
portion with Me, and no everlasting life. But he who hath eaten My Body,
even though he be dead, shall live for ever, \[for\] he is associated
with My Body and My Blood, and he hath become My heir, and he shall say
to My Father, 'Our Father which art in heaven,'" and the Father shall
answer him, saying, "Thou art My Son," and the crown (*i.e.* the
covering), which is above the offering, is a similitude of the stone
with which the Jews sealed the grave. And when the priest saith, "Send
the Holy Spirit," the Holy Spirit shall be sent, and the Body of our
Lord shall be perfect (or, complete). And when we have received we shall
be participators in the Body and Blood of our Lord and Redeemer Jesus
Christ, the Son of the Living God, and the Holy Spirit, henceforth and
for ever. Speak

ye then to one another so that the Jews, who are blind in heart, and who
are our enemies and the enemies of our Lord God, may not boast
themselves over us. And they say, "Your gods are many, and ye worship
wood" (*i.e.* the Cross), and they say, preaching openly the word of
Isaiah the Prophet, "Ye worship the half of it, and with the other half
ye cook the body and eat \[it\]." <span id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170)
Now Isaiah speaketh thus in respect of those who worship graven images
and idols. And they say \[that we say\], "These are our gods, and they
have created us"; and that we talk to them and worship them as the Lord
our God. And these also are they whom the devils lead into error in
their wickedness, and David saith, concerning them, "The gods of the
heathen are devils, but God hath created the heavens; truth and goodness
are before Him." <span id="fr_171"></span>[2](#fn_171)
