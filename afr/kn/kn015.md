### 7. CONCERNING NOAH

Now Noah was a righteous man. He feared God, and kept the righteousness
and the Law which his fathers had declared unto him—now Noah was the
tenth generation from Adam—and he kept in remembrance and did what was
good, and he preserved his body from fornication, and he admonished his
children, bidding them not to mingle with the children of Cain, the
arrogant tyrant, the divider of the kingdom, \[who\] walked in the
counsel of the Devil, who maketh evil to flourish. And he taught them
everything that God hated—pride, boastfulness of speech, self-adulation,
calumniation, false accusation, and the swearing of false oaths. And
besides these things, in the wickedness of their uncleanness, which was
unlawful and against rule, man wrought pollution with man, and woman
worked with woman the abominable thing.
