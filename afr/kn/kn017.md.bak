### 9. CONCERNING THE COVENANT OF NOAH

And then Noah the righteous man died, and Shem reigned in wisdom and
righteousness, for he was blessed by Noah, saying, "Be God to thy
brother." And to Ham he said, "Be servant to thy brother." And he said
unto Japhet, "Be thou servant to Shem my heir, and be thou subject unto
him." <span id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md) And again, after the Flood,
the Devil, our Enemy, did not cease from his hostility against the
children of Noah, but stirred up Canaan, the son of Ham, and he became
the violent tyrant (or usurper) who rent the kingdom from the children
of Shem. Now they had divided the earth among them, and Noah had made
them swear by the Name of his God that they would not encroach on each
other's boundaries, and would not eat the beast that had died of itself
or had been rent \[by wild animals\], and that they would not cultivate
harlotry against the law, lest God should again become angry with them
and punish them with a Flood. And as for Noah, he humbled himself, and
offered up sacrifice, and he cried out, and groaned, and wept. And God
held converse with Noah, who said \[unto Him\], "If Thou wilt destroy
the earth a second time with a Flood, blot Thou me out with those who
are to perish." And God said unto him, "I will make a covenant with thee
that thou shalt tell thy children they shall not eat

the beast that hath died of itself or that hath been torn by wild
beasts, and they shall not cultivate harlotry against the law; and I, on
My part, \[covenant\] that I will not destroy the earth a second time
with a Flood, and that I will give unto thy children Winter and Summer,
Seedtime and Harvest, Autumn and Spring. <span
