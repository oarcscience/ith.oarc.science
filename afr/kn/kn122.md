### 114. CONCERNING THE RETURN OF ZION

And the Tabernacle of the Law of God, the Holy Zion, shall remain here
until that day when our Lord shall dwell on Mount Zion; and Zion shall
come and shall appear unto all prepared, with three seals—even as Moses
gave her—as it saith in the Old Law and in the New, "At the testimony of
two or three \[witnesses\] everything shall stand." <span
id="fr_308"></span>[2](#fn_308) And then, saith Isaiah the Prophet, "The
dead shall be raised up, and those who are in the graves shall live, for
the dew which \[cometh\] from Thee is their life." <span
id="fr_309"></span>[3](#fn_309) And when the dead are raised up, His
mercy whereby He watereth the earth shall cease; they shall stand up
before Him with the works which they have done. And Enoch and Elias
shall come, being alive, so that they may testify, and Moses and Aaron
from the dead shall live with everyone. And they shall open the things
that fetter her (*i.e.* Zion), and they shall make to be seen the Jews,
the

crucifiers, and they shall punish them and chide them because of all
that they have done in perverting the Word of God. And the Jews shall
see what He wrote for them with His hand—the Words of His Commandment,
and the manna wherewith He fed them without toil \[on their part\], and
the measure thereof, the Gômôr, and the spiritual Zion, which came down
for their salvation, and the rod of Aaron, which blossomed after the
manner of Mary.
