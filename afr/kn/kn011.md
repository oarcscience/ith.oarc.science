### 3. CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF ADAM

And I go up from Adam and I say, God is King in truth, for Him praise is
meet, and He appointed under Him Adam to be king over all that He had
created. And He drove him out of the Garden, because of his apostasy
through the sin of the Serpent and the plotting of the Devil. And at
that sorrowful moment Cain was born, and when Adam saw that the face of
Cain was ill-tempered (or, sullen) and his appearance evil he was sad.
And then Abel was born, and when Adam saw that his appearance was good
and his face good-tempered he said, "This is my son, the heir of my
kingdom."
