### 93. HOW THE MEN OF RÔMÊ DESTROYED THE FAITH

And after they had waited for three months—now Zion came into the
country of Ethiopia at the beginning of the first month in the language
of the Hebrews, and in Greek Târmôn and in Gĕ’ĕz (Ethiopic) Mîyâzyâ, on
the sixth (or, seventh) day—they wrote down the Law and the names, and
they deposited \[the writing\] for a memorial for the later days, so
that what was right should be done for the pavilion \[of Zion\]

thereby, and so that the glory of the kings of Ethiopia and the glory of
the kings of Rômê might be well known. For the kings of Ethiopia and the
kings of Rômê were brethren and held the Christian Faith. Now first of
all they believed in an orthodox manner in the preaching of the Apostles
up to \[the time of\] Constantine, and ’Ĕlênî (Helena) the Queen, who
brought forth the wood of the Cross, and they (*i.e.* the kings of Rômê)
continued \[to believe for\] one hundred and thirty years.

And afterwards, Satan, who hath been the enemy of man from of old, rose
up, and seduced the people of the country of Rômê, and they corrupted
the Faith of Christ, and they introduced heresy into the Church of God
by the mouth of Nestorius. And Nestorius, and Arius, and Yabâsô (?) were
those into whose hearts he cast the same jealousy as he had cast into
the heart of Cain to slay his brother Abel. In like manner did their
father the Devil, the enemy of righteousness and the hater of good, cast
jealousy, even as David saith, "They speak violence in the heights of
heaven, and set their mouths in the heavens, and their tongue waggeth on
the earth." <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) And those same men who
know not whence they came, and know not whither they are going, revile
their Creator with their tongues, and blaspheme His glory, while He is
God, the Word of the Lord. He came down from the throne of His Godhead,
and put on the body of Adam, and He is God the Word. And in that body He
was crucified so that He might redeem Adam in his iniquity, and He went
up into the heavens, and sat upon the throne of His Godhead in that
body, which He had taken. And He shall come again in glory to judge the
living and the dead, and shall reward every man according to his work,
for ever and ever. Amen.

And we believe thus and we adore the Holy Trinity. And those who do not
believe thus are excommunicated

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

by the Word of God, the King of heaven and earth both in this world and
in that world which is to come. And we are strong in the Orthodox Faith
which the Fathers the Apostles have delivered unto us, the Faith of the
Church. And thus Ethiopia continued to abide in her Faith until the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.
