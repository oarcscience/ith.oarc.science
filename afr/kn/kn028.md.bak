### 20. CONCERNING THE DIVISION OF THE EARTH

From the middle of Jerusalem, and from the north thereof to the
south-east is the portion of the Emperor of Rôm; and from the middle of
Jerusalem from the north thereof to the south and to Western India is
the portion of the Emperor of Ethiopia. For both of them are of the seed
of Shem, the son of Noah, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David, the
children of Solomon. For God gave the seed of Shem glory because of the
blessing of their father Noah. The Emperor of Rôm is the son of Solomon,
and the Emperor of Ethiopia is the firstborn and eldest son of Solomon.
