### 115. CONCERNING THE JUDGEMENT OF ISRAEL

And He shall answer and say unto them, "Why did \[ye deny Me, and
entreat Me evilly and crucify Me, seeing that\] I did all this for you,
and that by My coming down \[from heaven\] I delivered you from Satan
and from the slavery of Satan, and that I came for your sakes? Look ye
and see how ye pierced Me with nails I and thrust the spear through Me."
And the Twelve Apostles shall be raised up, and they shall pass
judgement upon them, and shall say unto them, "We would have made you
hear, but ye would not hear the prophecy of the Prophets and the
preaching of us the Apostles." And the Jews shall weep and repent when
it shall be useless to do so, and they shall pass into everlasting
punishment; and with the Devil, their father who had directed them, and
his demons who had led them astray, and with the wicked they shall be
shut in.

And those who have believed and who have been baptized in the Holy
Trinity, and have received His Body and His Blood, shall become His
servants with their whole heart, for "there is no one who can hate His
Body altogether." The Body of Christ crieth out in our Body, and He hath
compassion because of His Body and Blood, for they have become His sons
and His brethren. And if there be some who have sinned they shall be
judged in the fire according to the quantity of their sins; he whose
burden of sin is light his punishment

a standard with flags attached to it, sits in the centre with His angels
about Him. On His right are seated the blessed, clothed, and on His left
are the damned in the form of naked men and women. At his feet lie

shall be light, and he whose burden of sin is heavy, exceedingly great
shall his punishment be. One day with God is as a period of ten thousand
years; some there shall be who shall be punished for a day; and some for
half a day, and some for three hours of a day, and some for one hour of
a day; and some there shall be who shall be tested and who shall be
absolved from their transgressions.
