This is a translation of the Kebra Nagast, a tremendous collection of
Ethiopian Biblical folklore. The Kebra Nagast tells the legend of the
Queen of Sheba's son by King Solomon, Menyelek (also known herein as
Bayna-Lehkem and David II). Menyelek engineers a plot to take the
Tabernacle of the Law of God (i.e., the Ark of the Covenant) to
Ethiopia. This is done at the behest of an Angel of God who predicts the
downfall of the kingdom of Solomon.

Comitted to writing in the fourteenth century, the Kebra Nagast was
derived from Ethiopian oral traditions of the Queen of Sheba and her
state marriage with Solomon. The Kebra Nagast has been cited as one of
the sources of the Rastafarian movement because of its support of
Ethiopian theocracy.
