### 108. CONCERNING THE WICKEDNESS OF THE INIQUITOUS JEWS

And the Prophets prophesied concerning the wickedness of the Jews. And
David said concerning it, "The man of violence hunteth iniquity to
destroy himself." <span id="fr_254"></span>[3](#fn_254) And again he
saith, "His sorrow shall return upon his head, and his iniquity upon his
forehead" (or, skull). <span id="fr_255"></span>[4](#fn_255)

Thus Solomon his son prophesied and said, "The foolish man and the man
of iniquity travel by paths that are not straight. He winketh with the
eye, and tappeth with the foot, and he giveth a sign by movements of the
fingers and motion of the lips, and his perverted heart meditateth evil
at all times; a man who is like this will make to come tumult and
murder, and the shedding of blood through double-dealing, and he shall
not escape the judgement." <span id="fr_256"></span>[5](#fn_256)

And David his father prophesied and said, "They brought forth against me
the word of error; he who sleepeth shall he not awake? Shall then the
man of my peace (*i.e.*, my friend), whom I trusted, who ate my food,
lift up his foot against me?" <span id="fr_257"></span>[6](#fn_257)

Thus Isaiah the Prophet prophesied and said, "Woe

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

be unto the man of iniquity who bringeth wrath." <span
id="fr_258"></span>[1](#fn_258) And again he said, "Let them remove the
sinner so that he may not see the glory of God." <span
id="fr_259"></span>[2](#fn_259)

Thus David the Prophet prophesied and said, "The sinner speaketh what
will condemn him, and there is no fear of God before his eyes." <span
id="fr_260"></span>[3](#fn_260)

Thus Solomon his son prophesied and said, "The man of iniquity bringeth
tumult to the city; and he willingly maketh to come destruction, and
beating, and calamity which cannot be healed, for he rejoiceth in
everything which God hateth." <span id="fr_261"></span>[4](#fn_261)

Thus prophesied Moses the Prophet and said, "God wisheth not to forgive
him but rather to increase vengeance upon him; and He will make
punishments to rest upon him, and the curse which is written in this
book shall come upon him; and his name shall be blotted out from under
heaven." <span id="fr_262"></span>[5](#fn_262)

Thus David the Prophet prophesied and said, "His heart is ready for
slaughter; he preferreth cursing and it shall come to him; he refuseth
blessing and it shall be far from him." <span
id="fr_263"></span>[6](#fn_263)

Thus Jeremiah the Prophet prophesied concerning him and said, "The man
of iniquity shall be destroyed because of the love of money, and he
looketh upon darkness because of his fraud." <span
id="fr_264"></span>[7](#fn_264)

Thus Job prophesied and said concerning him, "His Creator will destroy
his fair work, and his root shall dry up under him, and his flower shall
be beaten down upon him, and his memorial shall be blotted out from the
earth, and his name shall be cast far away, and men shall remove him
into the darkness so that he may not see the light, and the house of the
man of iniquity shall be blotted out." <span
id="fr_265"></span>[8](#fn_265)

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

Thus Hosea prophesied and said concerning him, "Hearken unto me, O
children of Israel, for there is no righteousness, and no mercy, and no
fear of God in his heart, but falsehood, and theft, and murder, and
fornication." <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](kn117.htm#fn_266)

And David the Prophet prophesied and said, "Satan standeth at his right
hand"; and again he said, "Let another take his office." <span
id="fr_267"></span>[2](kn117.htm#fn_267)

And Moses cursed in the Law and said, "Cursed be every one who taketh
bribes to slay innocent blood; and all the people said, Amen. And
Amen." <span id="fr_268"></span>[3](kn117.htm#fn_268)

Thus Habakkuk the Prophet prophesied and said, "The governor maketh
\[men\] wise concerning this perversion of the Law, and no right
judgement cometh forth; for the sinner corrupteth the righteous man, and
therefore a perverted judgement cometh forth." <span
id="fr_269"></span>[4](kn117.htm#fn_269)

Thus David the Prophet prophesied and said, "The sinner seeth and
becometh wrathful, and he gnasheth with his teeth and is
dissolved." <span id="fr_270"></span>[5](kn117.htm#fn_270)

Thus Solomon his son prophesied and said, "A false balance is a hateful
thing to God." <span id="fr_271"></span>[6](kn117.htm#fn_271)

Thus Jeremiah prophesied and said concerning Judah, "My hire is ready
(or, weighed) for me—thirty \[pieces of\] silver." <span
id="fr_272"></span>[7](kn117.htm#fn_272)
