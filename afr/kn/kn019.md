### 11. THE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN ORTHODOX FATHERS

And they answered and said unto him, "Yea, verily the Tabernacle of the
Covenant was the first thing to be created by Him, and there is no lie
in thy word; it is true, and correct, and righteous, and unalterable. He
created Zion before everything else to be the habitation of His glory,
and the plan of His Covenant was that which He said, 'I will put on the
flesh of Adam, which is of the dust, and I will appear unto all those
whom I have created with My hand and with My voice.' And if it had been
that the heavenly Zion had not come down, and if He had not put on the
flesh of Adam, then God the Word would not have appeared, and our
salvation would not have taken place. The testimony (or proof) is in the
similitude; the heavenly Zion is to be regarded as the similitude of the
Mother of the Redeemer, <span class="smallcaps">Mary</span>. For in the
Zion which is builded there are deposited the Ten Words of the Law which
were written by His hands, and He Himself, the Creator, dwelt in the
womb of <span class="smallcaps">Mary</span>, and through Him everything
came into being."
