# CHAPTER X

# BAVILI PHILOSOPHY

Sacred Symbols. -Compound Names. -The Sun and Moon. -General Scheme of
Bavili Ideas. -Cosmological Ideas. -Ternporal Ideas.-The Year.-The
Seasons. -Genetic Relations.-The Categories.

THE King of the Bavili, as I have said, has seven titles, one of which,
that of Ntawtela, he does not receive until after his death. The other
six, as I have explained elsewhere, are assigned to him as head of the
six great departments of state. These six titles are, as I shall point
out later, closely connected with the system of philosophy which I wish
to expound to you. I believe that above and beyond fetishism or
NDONGOISM, which I have already dealt with, there is a higher form of
religion among the Bavili which is connected with certain symbols in the
form of (1) sacred groves, (2) sacred lands and rivers, (3) sacred
trees, (4) sacred animals, (5) omens, and (6) the seasons. The six
titles of the King connect him directly with these six divisions of
sacred symbols as well as with the six departments in the state. As
Nkici ci he is, according to the native view, one of the products, or
perhaps we should rather say the end and final result, of the working of
the powers, or Bakici baci, represented by the sacred groves. As Fumu he
is the king (or chief from whom all proceed) of the symbolic lands and
rivers. As Ntinu Lukene he is head of the custom of the leopard, and
thus associated with the sacred animals. As Nganga Nvumba (the doctor of
the source of seasons or time) he is intimately connected with the
seasons. As Xivangi (procreator) he is at the head of the omens. And as
Mueno (the overseer of the morals of his people) he presides over the
sacred trees. That is, he is the chief teacher in all these branches of
native belief.

It is possible that at one time each of the sacred symbols mentioned
above had its sacred grove; in this grove, it may be, the king, as the
great high priest, taught his people the lesson connected with the
symbol. In support of this conjecture I may mention that I have so far
in no case discovered more than twenty-four sacred symbols in any of the
six divisions enumerated above. There are, it is true, certain apparent
exceptions, but the supernumerary symbols can be shown to stand apart
from the others for clearly defined reasons. After years of study I have
discovered twenty-four trees and herbs which are, as the natives say,
BAKICI BACI or sacred, twenty-four sacred animals, and so on. Now if
each division of sacred symbols is composed of twenty-four parts, the
sum total of Bakici Baci should be 144. I have as a matter of fact
discovered upwards of 90 sacred groves. It is therefore quite legitimate
to suppose that there may formerly have been 144 or more. Not only so,
but the meanings of the names of the sacred groves go to prove this
supposition, as I shall show more in detail later. The most remarkable
fact, however, about these groves is that the Bavili have preserved the
orderly grouping of twenty-four of these, and I believe that it is in
this order that we find the key to their philosophy.

In the sequel I treat of all the six sets of twenty-four symbols in
detail. I should now like to draw your attention to the eight words, the
only eight of this kind, so far as I know, found in Xivili, which are
compounded of two words, as they seem to me to imply that the idea of
the Bavili with regard to the symbols fall into 1+6+1 divisions. These
words are:-

                 MAMU-NZAMBI

MBUNGU-NTWALI         MAULA-NXIENJI

NKALA-NGO                NKONDA, or NONGA-NZAU

MANIA-MATALI            BULU-NTU

                 KACI-NUNI

\(1\) MAMU-NZAMBI (the acts or word of God)\[1\] is a name given to
certain towns, where some great palaver, consequent on the death of a
great prince, has been talked out.

\(2\) MBUNGU-NTWALI (two mugs). This is the name given to the mouth of
rivers where the waters of the sea and the river meet and form
whirlpools.

BUNGU is the water bottle or mug, and there is a native saying KU NUA
MALAVU, KU BULA MBUNGU, MBI I BELA NU MALAVU VO MU MBUNGU? To drink palm
wine, to break the mug is the evil in the wine or the mug? This implies
that the liquid in the mug may be replaced, but the wise man takes care
of the mug.

A slave wishes to transfer himself to a new master, breaks his water
cooler, and this act is called XIBULA MBUNGU.

When the princes hearing a palaver retire to take counsel one with
another, they say they go away to drink water.

When the King dies it is his ambassador (or mouth) MAXIENJI, who carries
the royal mug in the funeral procession, just as he has often before
carried his words of wisdom. The mug is still left, you see, although it
is not used until the princes elect their next King.

In ordinary funerals, which take place there, four or five years after
death, the wife, parting from her dead husband for the last time, as
they take his body away to bury it, lifts up her basket, containing the
water bottle and, perhaps as a purification ceremony, goes to the stream
to draw water.

Ideas of liquids, wisdom, and morality are connected with the MBUNGU
NTWALL

\(3\) NKALA-NGO, the crab and the leopard. This stands for "Roe and Doe"
in palavers, and the crab is the symbol of the sea, while the leopard is
that of the earth. Their ideas of solids and justice are connected with
these words.

\(4\) MANIA-MATALI, generally the name of a district up a river where
rocky land rises from the low-lying swamps.

MANIA means the "cold" stones found in rivers and valleys. The word
written in full is MANDIA (the princely womb). Ideas of the moon are
connected with this word; everything looks cold by moonlight, and is
actually cold.

\[1. The translations given in brackets were in every case given me by
the natives.\]

MATALI (or Matadi) means the metallic rocks, heated by the sun, NTANGUA
(mother chaser), and is opposed to NGONDE (or NGONDIA) the Moon,
regarded here as the mother of the sun. The words mania-matali stand
also for sun and moon.

The Sun and Moon are also spoken of as two brothers running one after
the other, but as the word NKOMBA in BAVILI may stand for either brother
or sister, we may if we like call them brother and sister.

The sun and moon are further spoken of as judges to whom certain
palavers must be referred. The other day I noticed a very neatly devised
badge (Pl. II*b*) upon a native's shirt, and I asked him what it meant.
The background of the badge was red, a favourite colour with the
materialistic Bavili. The sun and new moon were figured in white cloth,
while the mouth was formed of white and black cloth. The native told me
that he had a palaver with a certain cook, and that they had come to the
conclusion that the decision of so great a question could come only from
the sun and moon. Upon a visit to the grave of my old native friend
Francisco I found the following device upon the gate of the fence
surrounding it: the sun with lines across its face and the moon in its
last quarter. Here no mouth was figured, showing, I suppose, that all
breath was at an end. I can find no trees sacred either to the sun or
moon.

5\. The Morning Star the Bavili liken to a child running before its
parent calling him to rule the day. This Star they call MA ULA.\[1\]

The Evening Star is the offspring expressing its joy at going to rest
with its mother the Moon, and it is called NXIENJI.

The full moon rises from her couch accompanied by this same star, her
offspring, now her husband, and this star is then called NDONGO (the
spirit of witchcraft).

6\. NKONDA or NONGA-NZAU (to hunt the Elephant) has the meaning of
amassing everything for one's own family and giving nothing to others.
It is the name of certain towns The words symbolise weight, energy, and
plenty.

\[1. The exclamation U ULU is that with which the Bavili greet either
the new moon or a "witch" (NDOXI).\]

7\. BULU-NTU (a breaking of the head) a place generally situated about
the falls of a river where the waters burst a channel through or past
the rocks. MBULU = beast. NTU = man.

8\. KACI-NUNI = wife and husband, really "primeval dawn" and "I have
absorbed." These words are not only used for man and wife but also for
negative and positive powers; inferior and superior, as when one man
comes up to another to ask him for a favour and calls himself the
other's NKACI. NKACI is also used for the word NGULINKACI meaning one's
uncle on the mother's side. Thus the mythologist may easily become
confused. The natives say that the sun calls the moon his mother, but
MAMA (mother) may mean his aunt by marriage. He is also said to be the
husband of the moon; this may mean that he is superior to her just as
Maluango, though the king of the offspring province, considers himself
superior to KAKONGO, the mother province, from whence his wife comes.

These double words, which with one exception are compounded of elements
of contrary meaning, may be regarded as one particular case of a formula
which runs through their philosophy. To sum up we have-

1\. MAMU-NZAMBI-concerning god palaver.

2\. MBUNGU-NTWALI-the heads of maternity connected with ideas of water.

3\. NKALA-NGO-the crab and the leopard connected with ideas of earth.

4\. MANIA-MATALI-cold and hot stones connected with ideas of fire.

5\. MAULA-NXIENJI-the two stars connected with ideas of motion and
procreation.

6\. NONGA-NZAU-hunting the elephant, connected with ideas of plenty.

7\. BULU-NTU-beast and man connected with ideas of birth.

8\. KACI-NUNI-wife and husband ideas of opposites.

Put into a generalised form we may say that the philosophy of the Bavili
can be expressed by the formula 1 +6+ 1; six categories, which, as will
be shown in the subsequent chapters, reappear in the arrangement of the
groves and other symbols of Nzambi, and outside these categories at the
one end the idea of Nzambi, regarded as cause; at the other the idea of
man regarded as effect.

In the case of the compound words the order adopted is not based on any
information drawn from the natives: all that has been gathered from them
is the distinctive character of these eight words and the ideas which
they connect with them. We now pass on to consider the seasons, and here
not only has it been possible to elucidate the native ideas connected
with the seasons and their names, but to get from the natives further
details as to the genetic relation held to exist between the various
months and seasons.

### COSMOLOGICAL IDEAS.

In the last resort the Bavili are monists: they reduce everything
ultimately to a manifestation of Nzambi. From the abstract Nzambi
proceed Nzambi Mpungu, Nzambi Ci and Kici. These three elements of the
trinity appear in Bavili philosophy as Xi, Ci, and Fu. (It is desirable
to note Xi and Ci are respectively female and male, whereas Nzambi
Mpungu and Nzambi Ci are male and female.)

Xi means passive matter or things pertaining to the maternal principle.
Ci is the paternal or active principle.

Let us take an example. The sea is regarded as a male principle; from it
proceeds rain which falls on the earth, and the earth is regarded as a
female or passive principle; the rain fertilises the earth and causes it
to bring forth fruits.

Fu is, properly speaking, habit, custom, or sequence; we may, perhaps,
express it in one word by evolution, understanding thereby rather the
process by which the individual is produced than the life history of a
species. In another sense it may almost be said to be the individual
himself. Thus, when the rain has fallen upon the earth, it forms on the
one hand springs and rivers, and on the other causes vegetation to
spring up. Both the rivers and the vegetation result from the
interaction of earth and sea: the process of production and the product
are both Fu.

In order to prevent misconception I expressly state that these ideas are
not derived directly from the natives, but from philological
considerations. These three ideas are naturally strictly abstract and
out of all relation with the material universe.

Xi and Ci having produced Fu cease to operate; Fu, on the other hand,
continues. Under the name Vu it becomes active in space and time, and
may be called the cause of the material universe, Vu=time, season.

## TEMPORAL IDEAS.

\(a\) The Divisions of the Year.

Properly speaking, the year falls into three divisions, Mawalala, Xicifu
and Mvula. Of these, Mawalala is a period of rest, Xicifu a period of
preparation, and Nvula an evolutionary period or period of production.
just as in the cosmological ideas we have a progression of three
factors, Xi, Ci and Fu, so in the same way in temporal ideas, Mawalala
and Xicifu produce Nvula. just as Fu in its turn became a cause, so
Nvula produces Mawalala of the succeeding year.

\(b\) The Seasons and Months.

Of the three divisions of the year, Mawalala is itself both a season and
a month; Xicifu falls into two seasons of two months each, and Nvula
into four seasons of two months each. Properly speaking, the seasons
only ex'ist as factors in six groups of four, the other three being in
each case the two months, and the product specially associated with the
seasons. These groups of four are related just as our cosmological
series, Xi, Ci, Fu, and Vu; they consist of a principle, male and female
causes and a product.

We have already dealt with the months under measures (p. 65), and it is
unnecessary to repeat the information given there.

I now give you these groups in the form of a table

MAWALALA.

We may now consider the genetic relations of these six groups.
Denominating the groups by the names of the seasons which preside over
them, Mwici is female and Bunji is male; their product Mvumvumvu is
regarded as female. just as in the cosmological ideas Fu, the effect,
becomes Vu, the cause, the female effect Mvumvumvu is replaced by the
male cause Waw Waw Waw. This is, however, not directly operative, but
manifests itself through the secondary causes Nvula Nxentu and Nvula
Mbakala, and their effect is Mawalala. Mawalala, as the table shows,
stands outside the progression, and is in a way the end or final effect
of the whole process.

In its turn Mawalala becomes a cause; it stands to Mwici and Bunji in
the same relation as Waw Waw Waw to the two groups which follow it.
Being regar-ded by the natives as a season of rest, no product is
associated with Mawalala. The orderly grouping of the symbols may be
termed the formula.

## THE CATEGORIES.

The Bavili ideas relating to the various divisions enumerated above may
be said to fall into six divisions which we shall term the categories.
It must be understood that the European ideas which I have been led to
select only represent imperfectly the native ideas. On the one hand the
European conceptions go beyond those of the natives in many directions;
on the other the natives associate many to the European heterogeneous
notions under one heading, as shown below.

The six categories are: Water, Earth, Fire, Procreation and Motion,
Fruitfulness, Life. I will now proceed to show the connection of the
seasons with these ideas.

Mwici. Not only do the names of the months composing this season mean
salt-water and fresh-water, but the word Mwici itself contains the root
Mu. (for Mbu =the sea). The connection of this group with liquids is
clear.

Bunji. The names of the component months mean the valley of Xicifu, and
the name of the group the source of seed or maize. This connects it with
the category of earth.

Mvumvumvu. This is the period of marriage and the names of the months
mean male and female desire. The flame of love is perhaps sufficient to
justify me in associating this group with fire and marriage.

Wawawaw. The notion of running away, to which we have already alluded,
may serve to connect this season with the category of motion and
procreation.

Nvula Nxentu. The months are the months of maturity of crops and the
harvest, and their names are connected with the mortar in which seed is
pounded. The connection with fruitfulness seems clear.

Nvula Nbakala. We have already mentioned that the opening of Mawalala is
a period of high birth rate. This may serve to associate this season
with the category of Life. The names of the months mean male and female
suffering or travail.

In dealing with the compound words it has been mentioned that the
natives associate various ideas with them; these ideas in their relation
to the categories are here set out in tabular form:-
