# BAVILI PSYCHOLOGY

The Soul. -Shadows. -Black Magic. -Ghosts. -The Future of the
Soul.Witchcraft.

## THE SOUL.

WHEN I read that according to the observation of Mr. So-and-So the same
word is used among a certain people for breath, shadow, ghost, and soul,
I do not conclude that the observer in question is wrong. Neither,
however, am I led to suppose that these four distinct ideas are one in
the mind of those people. I know how hard it is for an observer of
primitive, arrested, or degraded people's thoughts to get at their real
meaning, and I know that in some cases one word may stand for four
distinct ideas.\[1\] Even in the country in which I have lived, although
the white man has been there over four hundred years, I doubt if there
are many who could enter into this subject with any great hope of giving
you a definite idea of the difference the native draws between life
shadow, breath, and intelligence on the one hand, and ghost, soul, and
spirit on the other.

### XI DUNDU OR SHADOW.

I remember when it was considered a crime for a person in this part of
the country to trample on or even to cross the shadow of another, more
especially if the shadow were that of a married woman. This shadow the
Bavili call Xi dundu.

\[1. Take the word MABILI for instance.\]

To-day people are still very particular about passing one another; but a
new-comer would be rather reminded of the custom at home that it is rude
to pass in front of anyone, and inclined to put this habit down to a
native's natural politeness.

At night the Xi dundu is said to sleep\[1\] in the body of its owner;
and that it is considered a very vital part of man we gather from the
fact that should an ndoxi, or dealer in black arts, rob a sleeper of his
Xi dundu, he is said to take away his life. The Xi dundu enters and
comes out of the body by the mouth (Munu), and is then likened to the
(Muvu) breath of a man. When a man dies, he is said to have no shadow,
even as he has no breath. Thus, in the mind of the Bavili both Xi dundu
and Muvu are part of mortal man, and die with him. But when a person
swoons, or has a fit, or is in a trance, they say some ndoxi has taken
his Xi dundu, and it is just at his pleasure to return it or not. Should
you kill the ndoxi, the Xi dundu in question would escape with another
member of the ndoxi's family. Supposing even that you think you know the
ndoxi who has secured your friend's shadow, you may not go to him and
ask him to return it; you must get two or three zinganga to confirm your
supposition, who shall visit the sick person and cry out to the ndoxi to
leave the person alone, and then threaten to call out his name if he
does not return the Xi dundu; then if it is not returned you must knock
some fetish, calling his name out, so that if the ndoxi does not return
the Xi dundu he will surely die.

## XIMBINDI, OR REVENANT.

We have already learnt a good deal about the Ximbindi in the tales in
*Notes on the Folklore of the Fjort*.\[2\]

After death the Ximbindi of a person may rest in the house in which he
dies for twenty days, after which it goes off to the woods and lives the
very natural kind of life described in the above tales. But the Ximbindi
of an ndoxi may haunt the place he died in for ever.

\[1. This belief is obviously derived from the fact that at night a
man's shadow disappears. How far the statement in the text requires
modification when there is moonlight I am unable to say.

2\. pp. 11-16, 115, 156.\]

It is believed that if a person ever sees the Ximbindi of one of his
relations he will die, and should anyone be beaten by a Ximbindi, that
person certainly has not long to live.

An ndoxi who has the proper medicine (mpanga) is spoken of as having the
power of "Nyungala." Such an ndoxi catches and keeps Bimbindi, and sends
them out to beat and kill living persons. This ndoxi has also the power
to send the leopard to kill people, or the crocodile to drown them and
to carry their Bimbindi away under the waters to some island in the
river Kongo, where he collects them previous to selling them to the
white man, whom they serve as slaves, and make cloth for him beneath the
blue sea far away.

The girl mentioned in *Notes on the Folklore of the Fjort*\[1\] as
living in Malela, and as having died and been buried there, and then
sold in Boma as a slave, and who afterwards came back to her family, was
supposed to be under the influence of Nyungala by her parents. Since
giving this example of a living Ximbindi I have heard of another case. A
girl of the village of Lumbembika, in the upper Lukula river in Kakongo,
died and was buried. Some time after this her mother, having made a long
journey into the bush, came across her daughter, and asked her how she
got there. She said that she had been sold to the chief of that town.
After some palavers and delay she was brought back to her town, where
she lived as a Ximbindi. She was forbidden to go near the place where
she had been buried. The only difference people noticed about her was
that her will was not her own, and that her eyes were like those of a
person who had been drinking.\[2\]

Xilunzi, or *ndunzi*, the intelligence, dies, so they say, with man, and
a Ximbindi is simply a tool in the hands of the ndoxi and has no ndunzi.

## NKULU, VOICE OR SOUL OF THE DEAD.

The Bakulu, or souls, of the BAVILI have nothing to do with witches,
shadows, or ghosts, or breath, or even intelligence; they are the
guiding voices of the dead. They prefer

\[1. p. 11

2 It is by no means impossible that she was under hypnosis.\]

to dwell in the heads of some of their near relations, and are placed
there as described in the "Death and Burial of the Fjort."\[1\] If they
are not fortunate enough to find such a habitation, they are said to
hover about the outer division or verandah of the houses of their
relations. They are never seen. They mourn with their relations when in
trouble, and long to help them. And they say that if every one of the
Bavili were destroyed to-morrow, these Bakulu would hover about in the
grass around their towns for ever and ever.

I was very much touched the other day, when present at the funeral of a
woman whom I had learnt to respect very much, to note the careful way in
which the brother picked up the sacred earth from the grave of his now
buried sister. His wife held out the end of the red cloth serving as her
husband's waistband, and he carefully placed the earth in it. She then
doubled the cloth over it, and tied the whole into a knot. This earth at
some future date will be placed by some nganga in the little horn
"Likawla," or then in the little tin box "Nkobi," so that the Nkulu of
the dead sister may be placed in the head of some living relation, and
her guiding voice be once more heard by those who loved her.

There are apparently six kinds of KULU among the Bavili, three belonging
to the MUNTu NZAMBI class and three to the MUNTO A NDONGO class-that is
to say, three pertaining to the higher or moral nature of man, and three
to his lower and physical nature.

1\. Nkulu bakakata (or the soul of our ancestors) causes women to bear
offspring. (This is connected with the BAKICI BACI or sacred groves, but
I have not found any traces of reincarnation.)

2\. Nkulu npunu is also an ancestral soul that causes babies to fall
sick.

3\. Nkulu yianzi is the soul of one who has just died. It is placed in
the head of a living relation for the purpose of consultation.

4\. The muntu nzambi will not reckon as "nkulu" the nkulu ndoxi (nkulu
of the person dealing in witchcraft).

\[1. *Folklore*, viii, 136.\]

This nkulu of the dead witch only a witch seeks to have placed in his
head. It is a sore point with the BAVILI, and they prefer to tell us
that the nkulu of a witch ceases at his death.

5\. Nkulu mbuila, a very destructive locust.

6\. Nkulu xilunga.\[1\] Both 5 and 6 have medicines attached to them to
be given to women whose "courses have been greatly delayed for some
cause.

Those who have read either *Seven Years among the Fjort* or my *Notes on
the Folklore of the Fjort* may remark that the Nkasa tree has not been
mentioned as a sacred tree. It will be remembered that the powdered bark
of the Nkasa tree is given to suspected witches and wizards as a test to
prove their innocence or guilt. If the accused vomit the noxious
medicine, they are innocent. If the poison is retained, it either
poisons the witch or else acts as a strong purge, when the culprit is
set upon and killed, the body burnt, and the ashes scattered to the
wind. No burial was granted to this temple of "Ndongo."

This witchcraft or fetishism (I use the word in the sense given to this
part of BAVILI philosophy by the Portuguese sailors and missionaries of
old) is just the evil counterpart of Nkicism (in the ancient acceptation
of the word).

The BAVILI thus to this day describe *themselves* as BANTU NZAMBI, men
of God, or BANTU A NDONGO, men of the black art; but all who think
themselves *Bantu nzambi* are not necessarily such, for while among the
*Bantu a ndongo* there are people who are aware that the evil power is
in them (and these are those that are burnt, after death), there are
others, on the other hand, who have lived with *ndongo* in their
stomachs all their lives without knowing it. In fact, the painful truth
is only brought to light after death, when the *ndongo*, who hates the
idea of being tightly wrapped up and buried deep in the bowels of Mother
Earth (or *Bulunji*), makes its appearance. For, say the Bavili, when
the corpse has been wrapped up in folds of cloth, *ndongo* fights his
way out of the stomach with a fearful explosion, burning a hole

\[1. The meaning of this term has escaped me.\]

through the wrappings. As the *ndongo* is no longer in the stomach of
the corpse, and as when alive the man had lived a decent life, the
corpse is buried; but no loving relation will pick up a handful of earth
from the grave to keep until required for the purpose of depositing it
in the *Likaula* or *nkobi*, those little *zinkici* so necessary to the
sick relation who would commune with the "voice" or "*nkulu*" of the
departed.

## LU MUÉNO OR MIRROR.

It is "Xina" (a thing forbidden) to throw the light reflected from a
mirror upon a person, and when the light passes across the face of an
individual he cries out: "Leave me alone. I have ndudu medicine in my
body." It is not a crime, but more of the nature of an insult, to throw
this light upon a person. Bits of looking-glass are to be found fixed in
trees, and in the eyes and stomach of many fetishes. The light thus
thrown is called "ntenia lu muéno."

## PHOTOGRAPHY.

When one wanders about the native village with a camera and points it at
people with the intention of taking their photographs, they invariably
at first run away. They say that they are afraid that the photographer
wishes to take away their life or "*Monio*."
