# CHAPTER XXIII

# CONCLUSION

IT is said that the earliest traditions represent rulers as Gods or
demigods.

In times and among races less barbarous we find these beliefs a little
modified, the monarch is conceived to be a man having divine authority.
He retains, however, as in the East to the present day titles
representing his heavenly descent.

Later on the progress of civilisation, as during the middle ages in
Europe, the current opinions respecting the relationship of rulers and
ruled are further changed, for the theory of divine origin is
substituted that of divine right.

With advancing political opinion have come still greater restrictions of
imperial power.

The writer does not think that the eternal and everlasting principles
founded on man's senses and the seasons and retained in the titles of
Maluango and other kings have by any means passed away.

Although we do not talk of our most gracious King by seven titles he is
certainly represented by six great dignities in the six offices of state
which King Alfred like King Maluango may have managed in person.

It is this wide gap, between European constitutions and their
developments and the constitutions as we find them in Africa -and their
developments-that blinds most people to a proper valuation of the latter
and makes the government of the Africans by the former so great a
puzzle.

It needs but a glance at the following lists for us to be convinced of
the psychic unity of mankind, and that in the art of ruling man this
must be accepted as a working hypothesis inductively established.

I must now conclude hoping that these notes may be of service both to
the intelligent black man anxious to remind his people of their greater
past and to encourage them once more to search after higher things, and
to the white man who for want of information has been inclined to
undervalue the material he is expected to understand and I am sure hopes
to guide or mould in the right way.

Both in the case of the white and black man environment has done its
fatal work, it is therefore as foolish for the white man at the present
juncture to impose many of his laws and customs upon the black man
living in the tropics as it would evidently be for the black man to
impose his upon the white man. It is, of course, easy to say that we
should act up to the ideals set before us by great philosophers and be
superior to our environment; but as a matter of fact we are not, and
while in Africa we find the ruins of what were once great kingdoms
wanting in strength to maintain themselves for any length of time free
from the gravest internal disorders and so degenerating into a series of
enclosed despotisms which in anything beyond the management of village
affairs do not contain the principle of representation by the people-so,
on the other hand, in Europe democracy has become too powerful, and the
people, fast losing sight of the great fundamental truths at the base of
all good government, look upon licence as liberty and attack or attempt
to disestablish any one of the six great estates which endeavours to
curb their so-called liberty.

It is here that the full beauty and use of the kingly office becomes
apparent, for the king at least should be placed by the people above
environment and so enabled to hold himself and the six great principles
of government well in hand.

Insects recognise this great truth, why should not man?
