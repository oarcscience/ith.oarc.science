# STORY OF LION AND LITTLE JACKAL.

This story is very likely of Hottentot origin. It is generally told by
the Kaffirs, but I have observed that it is a special favourite in
places only where there is a very strong tinge of Hottentot blood.

It is capable of indefinite extension by the narrator, but the tricks of
Little Jackal are always very silly ones. The above are among the best
of them.
