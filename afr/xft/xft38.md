# THE STORY OF KENKEBE.

In the above story Kenkebe is represented as the personification of
selfish greed. In this character his name has passed into a common
proverb-

Sibayeni sonke, Kenkebe.  
We are all bridegrooms, Kenkebm

This saying is used to any one who does not readily share food with
others. It means, we are all entitled to a portion, you greedy one. A
Kaffir, when eating, commonly shares his food with any others who may be
present at the time.
