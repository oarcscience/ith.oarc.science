# THE STORY OF LONG SNAKE.

ONCE upon a time a certain girl left her father's place, and went to the
village of Long Snake. Having arrived at the village of Long Snake she
remained there, but the owner of the place was absent. The only person
present was the mother of the owner of the place.

Then in the evening the mother of Long Snake gave that girl some millet,
and told her to grind it. After it was ground she made bread. When it
was ready the mother of Long Snake said: "Carry this bread into the
house of Long Snake."

A short time after that girl went into the house, the owner of the place
arrived. Then she gave him bread and fermented milk, and he ate. When
they had finished the food they went to sleep. Then early in the morning
Long Snake went away, because in the daytime he lived in the open
country.

The girl went to the house of the parents of Long Snake. The mother of
Long Snake clothed her with a very beautiful robe. After she was dressed
she called for an axe, and went to cut firewood. Having arrived in the
open fields she did not cut the firewood, but she threw away the axe and
ran to her father's place.

When she arrived at her father's place, her sister asked for where she
had got that beautiful robe. She told her, and her sister said: "I am
going to that village too."

The girl said: "Just listen, and I will tell you the custom of that
village."

But her sister said in reply: "I do not want you to tell me anything,
because you yourself were not warned before you went."

Then she set off at once, and went on till she arrived in the evening at
the village of Long Snake. When she sat down the mother of Long Snake
gave her millet, telling her to grind it and make bread. When it was
ready she took it into the house of Long Snake. Then in the evening the
owner of the place arrived, and the girl gave him bread and fermented
milk. When they had finished eating they went to sleep, and early in the
morning Long Snake went away.

Then the girl went to the house of Long Snake's parents. His mother
clothed that girl also in the same manner as she had dressed the elder
one. Then she borrowed an axe and went to cut fuel. In doing so she made
an excuse to run away.

On this day, however, the man went after his wives, and arrived at his
father-in-law's place as the sun was setting.

They went out of the house that the bridegroom might sleep in it. While
he was eating, the people of the village piled up bundles of grass, and
the bridegroom was burned in the house. In this manner he died.
