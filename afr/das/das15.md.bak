# Sandfly

Sandfly, about nine miles southeast of Savannah, is a scattered Negro
community spreading through the hot pine barrens to the Isle of Hope.
There is nothing unusual or outstanding about the sleepy little
settlement; its three hundred inhabitants appear to lead a placid,
uneventful existence.

Many of the houses are situated on a side road which leads to the Isle
of Hope. Modern conveniences are lacking, but the nondescript dwellings
are brightened by flower gardens in the front yards, while small truck
gardens occupy the space to the rear and sides. The more substantial
houses of the more prosperous citizens are set deep in the wooded
sections and are reached by means of narrow winding paths bordered with
giant moss-hung oak trees.

Usually life in Sandfly flows along pleasantly and without serious
interruption. Even in the morning men and women sit around on porches or
in yards, sometimes talking, sometimes dozing in the sun. The more
industrious are at work in the gardens or may be seen through doors
busily occupied in washing or ironing clothes. Many of the men are
employed as fishermen or day laborers, and the women who work out are
generally engaged as house servants in homes at near-by Isle of Hope.

At first residents of the community were reluctant to talk about their
superstitions and beliefs and their knowledge of conjure. Their
customary response when first approached was a laconic, "No, ma'am, I
ain got no fait in sech tings as cunjuh." When pressed for details,
however, and when assured

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

that the interviewers' interest was a friendly one, their attitude
frequently changed and they talked volubly of queer happenings in the
vicinity.

"They jis don't think bout nuthin but cunjuh," said one woman, a
newcomer in the neighborhood. <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md) "Yuh
heah all the time of folks havin spells put on em an findin cunjuh bags
buried in the yahd. All the times some folks are fixin
othuhs. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md)

"A woman that lived in Homestead Park jis couldn't seem to have nothin
but bad luck. She thought maybe an enemy had conjuhed uh, so she looked
in the yahd an sho nough theah wuz a cunjuh bag. It wuz a queah lookin
bundle with a lot of brown clay in it. She destroyed the bag an the bad
luck stopped an the evil spirits didn't bothuh uh none."

A small child complained to his parents that he felt snakes moving about
in his head. [5](das26.htm#xref_5), [50](das26.htm#xref_50.md) A local
doctor diagnosed the illness as ringworm, but this explanation failed to
satisfy the parents for the child's own theory of snakes seemed to them
much more convincing. One morning, soon after, the mother discovered a
large snake crawling about in front of the house. She killed the snake
and the next day the inflamed places on the boy's head began to heal. In
a few days he was completely cured. <span id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md)

Professional witch doctors and root doctors [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) ply
an active trade and are employed in the more extreme cases, but often
the people take matters in their own hands and by means of conjure bags
and charms seek to alter their own destinies and those of their
neighbors. Retribution is brought to bear on an enemy, the favor of a
loved one is gained, and luck in business or in games of chance is
assured by the possession of some sort of luck charm or
powder. [8](das26.htm#xref_8.md)

In a section of Sandfly known as Baker's Crossing lives Ophelia Baker,
better known as Madam Truth, professed fortune teller and clairvoyant.
The woman's sober attire and her modern attractive house give little
evidence of her profession. When holding a seance, however, her whole
appearance

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

undergoes a change; her body becomes tense and jerks spasmodically; her
dark eyes roll wildly. Of her ability in her chosen field the medium
says, "I advise on business an love affeahs. I tell good an bad nooz
comin tuh yuh. Deah's a remedy fuh ebry trouble and I hab dat remedy,
fuh a spirit hab brung it tuh
me." [22a](das26.htm#xref_22a), [22e](das26.htm#xref_22e.md)

Madam Truth, a member of the Holy Sanctified Church of Sandfly, said
that all members must undergo a sanctifying process in order to be
saved. After this has been accomplished members claim to be able to
hear, from a great distance, singing, talking, and the sounding of
drums. We were told that the beating of the drums has a special
significance, but that was all we could learn on the subject; we were
told that this was a secret, divulged only to members.

Members of the church are forbidden to eat certain kinds of fish and
also cabbage, lettuce, and other green vegetables. The reason they give
is that they have received a warning from the spirits that it is unwise
to eat these foods. [65](das26.htm#xref_65.md)

The plump, dark-skinned fortune teller said that she had spent her
childhood on Skidaway Island. She remembered hearing the drums beaten to
tell the people in the nearby settlements of an approaching dance or
festival. Her father had been one of those who beat the drum and thumped
out a regular message on it, a message that could be beard for miles and
was clearly understood by all those who had heard
it. [26](das26.htm#xref_26.md)

The woman also remembered wakes which had been held on Skidaway. Coffee
and sandwiches were served the [37b](das26.htm#xref_37b.md),
 [37c](das26.htm#xref_37c.md) mourners, each one of whom poured some of the
coffee on the ground for the spirit of the
deceased. [58b](das26.htm#xref_58b),  [58e](das26.htm#xref_58e.md)

Another native of Skidaway, <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) now
living in Sandfly, also remembered drum codes being sent out from
Skidaway. [26](das26.htm#xref_26.md) A member of the Baptist Church, he has
never heard drums beaten in the house of praise, but he described with
great pride and earnestness the ceremony of a river baptism.

"We gadduh at duh chuch wid duh candidates who comes all dressed ready
fuh baptism in long wite robes. Duh deacons range duh folks in line, two
by two. Den duh mahch

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

tuh duh ribbuh begin, duh pastuh an duh deacons leadin duh way. Dis is a
solemn time, an duh candidates an deah friens an relatives all rejoice.
As we mahch we sing. Some uh duh songs we sing is I*'m Gwine Down tuh
duh Ribbuh ub Jawdan* an *Oh, Who Will Come an Go Wid Me*?

"Wen we git tuh duh ribbuh some uh duh folks is so happy an dey scream
an jump roun so much dat some uh duh udduhs hab tuh hole em. Duh
candidates is led intuh duh watuh, one by one, an baptize. Attuh duh
baptizin dey change deah cloze an we all go tuh duh chuch fuh duh
communion services."

Here, as in many other sections, a silver coin is frequently worn on the
ankle to insure good luck [8](das26.htm#xref_8.md) and to give warning by
turning black at any effort by an enemy to conjure the
wearer. [12a](das26.htm#xref_12a),  [12c](das26.htm#xref_12c.md),
 [12d](das26.htm#xref_12d.md) In regard to this custom of wearing a coin
one woman who is married to a man "wid duh powuh tuh see
tings" [22a](das26.htm#xref_22a),  [22e](das26.htm#xref_22e.md) said, "Duh
folks roun yuh use tuh weah five dolluh gole pieces on deah ankle, but
hahd times jis nachly make dem gole pieces jump off." <span
id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94.md)

The same woman told that when she and her husband first moved to Sandfly
several years ago, a neighbor employed a conjure man to put a spell on
them to drive them away.

"I membuh wen deze folks cross duh way wuz conjuhin us, an strikin roun,
I went tuh duh sto an change a dolluh bill fuh one of deze silvuh
dolluhs. It wuz roun an shiny as yuh please. I carry it in muh
pocketbook an duh nex day it tun black an I know fuh sho dey wuz tryin
tuh cunjuh us." [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md)

Repeated efforts were made to conjure the newcomers. At first bottles
filled with a queer oily substance were buried around the house. When
these failed in effect a more powerful charm was compounded, and a few
days later the intended victim discovered buried in her back yard what
she described as "a bottle neck down in duh groun. It wuz filled wid
some kine of funny lookin oil."

"I know dis wuz a cunjuh," she said. "I call muh huzbun an show it tuh
im. He git plenty mad an say he gonuh settle mattuhs once and fuh all
wid dis cunjuh man. He wait fuh im by duh lane an wen he come long, he
grab im an shake im an tell im he know all bout wut he bin doin. He tell
im

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

he bettuh stop tryin tuh cunjuh us, fuh he know bout cunjuh his ownsef
an he tell im all duh tings dat be done. Wen duh cunjuh man heah dis, he
fall down on is knees an beg muh huzbun tuh fuhgib im. He tell im bout
all sawts uh magic dat he wukd on udduh folks in duh neighbuhood. He
promise not tuh do no mo uh dis an muh huzbun let im go."

We were told of another woman who, as a result of
conjure, [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) fell mysteriously ill and felt snakes
running up and down her left side under the skin. [5](das26.htm#xref_5.md),
 [50](das26.htm#xref_50.md) Medical care did not help the case and she is
now, according to report, "jis wastin away an no one caahn do
nuttn." <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md)

Graveyard dirt is often employed in the making of conjure
bags. [8](das26.htm#xref_8),  [9](das26.htm#xref_9.md) if possible this
must be taken from the grave of a murdered person and some money must be
left in exchange. Not very long ago when a man was arrested for murder,
his friends, wishing to save him, went to the grave of the murdered man,
secured some dirt, and left three pennies on the grave. A man, lingering
in the vicinity, stole the money and shortly thereafter spent it in the
neighborhood store. As one neighbor put it "duh ban come widin an inch
uh wukin." Although the defendant was not acquitted, he was sentenced to
a mere two or three years, and there was some speculation as to whether
or not the theft of the money had been what kept him from going entirely
free. <span id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_96) [64](das26.htm#xref_64.md)

A woman, suspecting that someone was attempting to conjure her
daughter, [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) dug up the ground around her house
until she found the evil charm. Of this case our informant says, "It wuz
two balls of graveyahd dut, [9](das26.htm#xref_9.md) all wrapped up in a
clawt. Dey tuk it roun an show it tuh ebrybody. It wuz up at duh
poolruhm all spread out on duh pool table, an folks stop in all duh time
tuh xamine it. Duh girl dat wuz cunjuhed buy a han [6](das26.htm#xref_6.md)
frum a root man an duh spirits dohn bodduh uh none." <span
id="fr_97"></span>[3](#fn_97.md)

People in the community believe that extremely powerful charms can be
made from the dust from people's foot tracks. [7](das26.htm#xref_7.md)
There is a constant dread that someone will secure this dust, and
zealous care is taken to prevent this. We were told, "A

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

ole uhmun who libed heah-a-bouts wuz so sked dat somebody would fix uh
dat she alluz carried a rake wid uh. Down duh road she would go, rakin
up uh foot-steps in back of uh, so dat nobody could git dat dus an fix
uh." <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98.md)

Another resident who neglected these precautions said she became very
ill, due to the fact that someone had manufactured a charm from the dust
left by her foot tracks. As her condition became more aggravated she at
length consulted a root doctor. He sold her a counter
charm [6](das26.htm#xref_6.md) and soon the mysterious illness
disappeared. <span id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_99.md)

Death, especially if violent or unexpected, is attributed to witchcraft
or conjure. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) One woman voiced the sentiment of
many of the community when she said, "Theah ain't supposed tuh be no
sech thing as nachul death yuh in Sandfly. Wen a pusson dies some one
have fix im sho. Bout a yeah go ole woman went fuh a walk right down
this road yuh. She went up on a hill cross frum yuh weah she live an the
nex mawnin she wuz foun dead theah. Mos folks said she wuz cunjuhed that
night, though theah wuz some wut did say she have haht trouble. Jis a
week aw so ago the brothuh of a neighbuh die right sudden an folks said
he wuz cunjuhed too." <span
id="fr_100"></span>[3](#fn_100) [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md)

In regard to death we found a rigid observance of customs that were
prevalent also in the other communities. For example, one Negro's body
had been shipped back from New York City in order that it might be
buried in Sandfly. Otherwise, we were told, the spirit of the deceased
would have found no rest, but instead would have roamed the
countryside. [1](das26.htm#xref_1.md) Here, too, was observed the practice
of placing broken bits of pottery and possessions last used by the dead
person on the grave for the purpose of supplying the needs of the
spirit. [47](das26.htm#xref_47.md)

In Sandfly there is a ready market for love powders and charms. <span
id="fr_101"></span>[4](#fn_101.md) This field has been highly
commercialized and representatives of different corporations frequently
visit Sandfly selling such articles as *Adam and Eve Root*,

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Lucky Mojo Love
Drops*, *Black Cat Ashes*, and *Courting Powder*. [8](das26.htm#xref_8.md)
Apparently the women resort to the use of the love charms more
frequently than the men, and their reason for doing so was described by
one woman as being "so dat dey kin rule duh men." <span
id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102.md)

Old and young entertain a firm belief in the existence of witches and
spirits. The witches may come in a variety of shapes, appearing as a
person either male or female, an animal, or sometimes as an
insect. [68](das26.htm#xref_68.md) When questioned regarding the
apparitions, one person said, "A witch ride muh sistuh mos every
night. [69](das26.htm#xref_69.md) He come singin a lill song. I heah uh
movin bout an moanin an in duh mawnin she is jis bout wone out an uh
haiah is all tangled. Sometime she wake up an drive him away, but some
nights he come back two aw three times an ride uh. In duh mawnin she jis
too tied tuh go tuh wuk. <span id="fr_103"></span>[2](#fn_103.md)

"Deah wuz a ole woman in Savannah dat dey say wuz a witch. One night a
ole man wake up an foun dis witch ridin im. [69](das26.htm#xref_69.md) He
say it look lak a bug. [68](das26.htm#xref_68.md) He ketch it an break off
duh leg at duh joint. Duh nex mawnin he go an see duh ole woman an sho
nuff she have uh ban all tie up wid a bandage. Dey tell me bout uh an I
go see uh. Uh finguh wuz right off at duh joint."

Spirits of the dead often wander along the dark
roadways, [56](das26.htm#xref_56), [59](das26.htm#xref_59.md) and
frequently some belated stroller runs screaming in terror, declaring
that he is being pursued. <span id="fr_104"></span>[3](#fn_104.md) The
spirits may appear as misshapen men or women, as sheep, dogs, and
cats. [54](das26.htm#xref_54),  [55](das26.htm#xref_55.md) A spirit need
not always assume the same appearance but may change form entirely each
time. <span id="fr_105"></span>[4](#fn_105.md)

The following story was told by a woman in the community:

"I sho believe in spirits. I have seen em wid muh own eyes. One evenin
jis as it wuz gittn dusty I wuz goin in tuh town tuh see duh dressmakuh.
I walk tuh duh cah tracks an deah sittin on a rail wuz a lill tiny man,
bout long as dis. I nevuh seen sech a lill
man. [54b](das26.htm#xref_54b),  [55](das26.htm#xref_55.md) He wuz so lill
he ain good

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

fuh nuthin. I look at im hahd. On his head wuz a lill tin lamp wut
gleamed in duh dahk. He wuz kine of an Indian culluh. He wuz a grown man
fuh sho fuh he hab a lill mustache. I holluh fuh a man tuh come out an
see wut I foun, but wen he git deah duh lill man hab disappeah. Jis den
duh cah blowed an I hab tuh leab.

"Wen I gits home dat night, it wuz real dahk. I ain goin tuh walk dat
dahk road by mysef an I holluh fuh every man I knowd dat live neahby. I
make em all walk home wid me, but deah wuzn no signs of duh lill man.

"Attuh dat lots of folks say dey see im. Wen duh moon is noo an deah is
a drizzle, he come walkin along wid his lill lamp. He take all kine uh
shapes. Sometime he's a man an sometime he's a
animal. [54](das26.htm#xref_54.md) Dey say he's comin roun cuz deah's
buried treasure neah yuh." <span
id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106) [61](das26.htm#xref_61.md)

Here in this little Negro community there seem to be few phases of life
left untouched by superstitious fears. As one woman aptly expressed
it--"Everything that happen is cause by cunjuh an magic. They jis dohn
leave nuthin tuh Gawd." <span id="fr_107"></span>[2](#fn_107.md)
