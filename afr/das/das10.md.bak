# Springfield

Rows of faded gray houses, huddled close together and facing on narrow
dirt lanes, house the population of Springfield, a Negro community lying
west of Savannah near the city waterworks. In the neighborhood are
several wooden churches of various denominations, a well constructed
modern brick school building, and a number of stores that supply the six
hundred odd Negroes of the community.

Many of the houses are shuttered, dim and quiet. So somber an atmosphere
prevails that it is easy to imagine the spectral figures that the
Negroes claim they see wandering at night along the twisting pathways.
It is not surprising to be told of the sinister powers which are
constantly at work and against which many inhabitants of this locality
are always on guard.

A familiar figure in the neighborhood is James Washington, <span
id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) famed locally as a fortune teller and root
doctor. It is said that Washington's patronage is growing
steadily; [22a](das26.htm#xref_22a),  [22e](das26.htm#xref_22e.md),
 [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) each day new clients visit his dilapidated
house, seeking advice or perhaps a cure for some puzzling ailment that
has descended upon them.

The consulting room is smoky, airless, and reeking with a queer pungent
odor. The shades are drawn down tightly, and when a visitor is being
given advice the door is shut securely against intrusion. The furniture
is scant, consisting of a lamp on a plain table, a couch for the
visitor, and placed directly across the room a wooden armchair in which
sits

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

the dealer in magic. The most remarkable object in the room is a "spirit
picture," showing the head of one of the creatures of the "shadduh
worl." The eyes are closed, the face bears a rapt, exalted expression,
and the picture fades off into a dim mist of clouds.

Washington uses no cards or crystals. "I kin tell duh fewchuh jis by
lookin at duh pusson," [22a](das26.htm#xref_22a.md),
 [22e](das26.htm#xref_22e.md) he told us, "cuz I wuz bawn wid a double
cawl [4](das26.htm#xref_4.md) wut wuz sabe fuh me till I wuz grown. Duh
spirit show me ebryting. Ain many people hab duh powuh tuh see tings,
but I got dis gif frum Gawd.

"I hab a deep knowledge uh magic. Deah's magic wut gahd yuh frum hahm an
deah's ebil magic wut kin put yuh down sick aw eben kill
yuh. [8](das26.htm#xref_8.md) Wen yuh bin fix, yuh caahn git well wid
regluh medicine. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) Yuh got tuh git a han gense duh
fixin. [6](das26.htm#xref_6.md) Magic roots hep a
lots. [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) Duh haiah is one uh duh mos powful tings
yuh enemy kin git hole ub [10](das26.htm#xref_10.md) cuz it grow neah duh
brain an a han made outuh haiah kin sho affec duh brain."

The credulous neighbors constantly seek Washington's aid, for there is
much talk of conjure among them. His recent acquittal on a charge of
assault and robbery was interpreted as evidence that he possessed the
ability to "fix duh cote so dey couldn nebuh sen im up."

We were told of a woman who had a spell cast upon her by her own
sister. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) Wishing to verify our information, we
decided to pay the unfortunate victim a visit.

The house stood at the dead end of a narrow street. A high wall
separated it from its neighbors and the barren ground encircling it was
littered with refuse, tin cans, and large piles of rocks. A fierce
looking dog prowled restlessly near the high arched gateway and bared
his teeth at the intruders. At our request a neighbor obligingly called
over the fence to the sick woman, <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md)
who a moment later came limping towards us.

Her age was uncertain; she was gaunt and sickly in appearance. Her
outfit consisted of a dull gray waist with a turban to match and a faded
blue skirt. Large brass earrings dangled from her ears, making her lean
face appear still more woebegone. Certainly there was something wrong
with

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

the woman, for she dragged listlessly with the effort of walking the
short distance from the house.

We inquired about her health but when we asked about the "cunjuh" which
had been put upon her, she looked at us distrustfully, saying, "Muh
huzbun tell yuh bout dat." With that she left us abruptly.

Soon the man <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) appeared, a bent figure
in ragged blue overalls, with a battered felt hat on his grizzled head.
Unlike his wife, Stephen Bryant was talkative and friendly, and he told
us readily of his wife's strange predicament. "She wuz cunjuhed by uh
own sistuh," he began. "Some days she all right an kin cook an clean up;
den all at once tings git tuh runnin all obuh uh
body. [5](das26.htm#xref_5.md) Sometimes she fall down an hab tuh be put
tuh bed."

We asked Stephen if he had consulted any root
doctors [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) about his wife's condition and he said,
"I hab monuh dozen root doctuhs tuh uh but dey dohn do uh no good. I
keep on tryin an maybe some day I fine duh right un tuh reach duh
cunjuh."

In this instance retribution seemed to have come swiftly, for Stephen
told us that the sister who had caused the conjure was now "laid up
uhsef wid cunjuh, fuh someone cas a spell on huh too."

When we asked Stephen if he believed in evil spirits, he nodded in
affirmation. "I sees um all duh time," he said. "Dey is lill an wite an
hab no head. [54](das26.htm#xref_54),  [55](das26.htm#xref_55.md) Yuh nebuh
see um till attuh duh sun gone down. Yuh dohn bodduh um none an dey leab
yuh lone.

"Deah use tuh be a ole house right pas ours. Ebry night we would be woke
up by a loud bangin noise. Ef we look out duh winduh we could see dis
spirit. He was alluz wanduhin roun. Ebry now an den he would tro a rock
at a ole gasoline tank an it would make dat noise we
heah. [55](das26.htm#xref_55.md) We alluz use tuh tink deah wuz buried
treasure neah an dis spirit wuz gahdin it. [61](das26.htm#xref_61.md) I
nebuh did look fuh duh treasure, I dohn wahn tuh fool wid no spirits.
Attuh a time dey tuk down duh house an duh spirit nebuh did come back no
mo."

Another victim of conjure, <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md) a Negro
man of about

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

eighty-eight, told us that although he did not usually believe
superstitious tales, his own strange experience had forced him to
realize that "folks kin fix yuh." "One time I fall down sick frum a
puhculeyuh disease. Nuttn didn do no good till uh hab a root uhmun come
in. Right away she tell me a enemy done put down a dose fuh
me. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) She say I wuz fined in fish. Well, den, she
tell me tuh drink a haffuh pint uh wiskey and tro way duh udduh res uh
duh pint. Attuh uh done dis, uh git well agen. [6](das26.htm#xref_6.md)

"I knows a case uh fixin right now. It's a young man wut dohn lib fah
frum yuh. He alluz complainin bout crickets crawlin unduh his skin an
some uh duh neighbuhs say dey see um. I blieb dis mus be so cuz deah's a
uhmun roun yuh wut kin make a han tuh put any kine uh insec in yuh
body. [5](das26.htm#xref_5.md) She kill duh insec an grine it tuh powduh an
rub it on duh skin uh duh pusson aw gib it tuh um tuh drink. Wen it
entuh duh body, it tun back intuh insec, sometime a lizud aw a frawg aw
a snake."

The old man continued, "Ise had plenty sperience bout root
wuk, [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) but I alluz try tuh keep way frum dat kine
uh folks. I membuh ole Doctuh Sheppard who use tuh oppurate yuh. He hab
hunduds uh folks come tuh him day an night. He mustuh been bery good.

"Deah wuz a uhmun name Clara an she wuz good too. She use tuh ketch lots
uh Doctuh Sheppard's customuhs. I went tuh uh house once. She show me a
box full uh packages an she say dat ebry one wuz a han fuh diffrunt
tings. [8b](das26.htm#xref_8b.md)-e I reach out tuh git hole ub em, but she
stop me an say ef uh touch em, dey lose all duh powuh. Clara and Doctuh
Sheppard bote dead now.

"Ise heahd lots uh stories bout folks wut could fly. Some time back I
wuz libin in Woodville wen a man come tru deah. He wuz frum Liberty
County. Dis man talk lot bout duh story uh duh Africans wut could fly.
He say all dis wuz true. He say he wuz takin awduhs fuh wings an dey wuz
all yuh need tuh fly. A peah uh wings coss twenty-five dolluhs. Duh man
take yuh measure an a five dolluh deposit an say he collec duh balance
wen he delibuh duh wings. Lots uh people gib deah awduh fuh wings, cuz;
all deah libes dey been heahin bout folks wut could fly. Duh man jis go
roun

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

takin awduhs an collectin five dolluhs. Das duh las any ub us ebuh heah
uh duh man aw duh wings."

Clara Smith, <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md) a resident of this
community, told us that she too remembered the time when Dr. Sheppard
and the woman called Clara, who it appeared was her aunt, had operated a
thriving business. "I didn unduhstan much wut dey did," she said, "but
dey wuz bote kep busy all uh dat time. Deah wuz alluz; a long line uh
folks waitin tuh see em.

"Dey say my Aunt Clara wuz bery good. She could wuk roots an gib good
luck hans an tell fawchuns, and fix yuh enemies.

"One time a man come an git muh aunt. He say somebody cunjuh his
wife. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) She ack queah an run away an stay fuh days
at a time. My aunt go tuh duh house an dig all roun. She fine a sack
filled wid sulphuh, an haiah, [10](das26.htm#xref_10.md) an matches, an
grabeyahd dut. [9](das26.htm#xref_9.md) Den she took in duh house an she
fine mo sacks in duh mattress, in duh pilluh, an in duh dressuh draws.
Deze cunjuh sacks wuz wut causin duh woman tuh be crazy. My aunt destroy
duh sacks an gie duh woman a good luck ban tuh
weah [6](das26.htm#xref_6), [12a](das26.htm#xref_12a.md),
 [12c](das26.htm#xref_12c),  [12d](das26.htm#xref_12d.md) so no udduh root
wukuh could hahm uh. Attuh dis duh ebil spell went away an duh woman wuz
cuod."

One of the interesting characters of the section is Ellen Jones, <span
id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md) better known as "Pipe Ellen" because of a
very evident liking for tobacco. The old woman, an ex-slave, claims to
be almost one hundred and twenty-two years old and walks almost daily
from Springfield to Savannah. Winter and summer, her frail figure is
snugly buttoned into a heavy top coat, so long that the hem trails on
the ground. On her white head she wears a dark wool skull cap.

"Pipe Ellen" told us that she firmly believed in conjure and in proof of
this she related the following instance: "Right yuh in Savannah a uhmun
wut claim tuh be muh frien root-mahk me. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) I ain
fraid tuh tell uh name, cuz she dead now. It wuz Flossie Hopkins.

"She fix me wid tuhbaccuh. Yuh see she knowed I lub tuhbaccuh. She wuk a
root on me so strong dat she put a big snake in muh bed, an uh could
feel tings moobin all tru muh

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

body. I could feel duh snake runnin all tru me. [5](das26.htm#xref_5.md),
 [50](das26.htm#xref_50.md) Den I heah a noise an it keep on, so uh say tuh
muhsef, 'A snake is in yuh.' I git up an set duh lamp in duh middle uh
duh room. Duh snake show up. I close all duh cracks roun duh house, so
nuttn couldn git out.

"Nex ting I know dat uhmun wuz knockin at muh doe. Wen I let uh in, she
grab dat snake, tro it cross uh shoulduh an walk out.

"Ef uh hadduh kill dat snake, a man tole me, it sho would ub bin Flossie
Hopkins. He tole me tuh git a box uh Debil Lye. Denne dug unduh muh doe
step an took a bunle uh roots. Deah wuz red peppuh, an sulphuh, an salt,
an some udduh kine uh powduh. He sprinkle dis all roun duh place an say
I need nebuh be fraid cuz dis would kill any cunjuh put down fuh
me." [6](das26.htm#xref_6.md)

During the course of an inter-view, which was held later with another
woman <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md) in the community, we again
discussed the subject of conjure. This woman told us, "Deah's plenty
cunjuh in dis neighbuhhood. Deah wuz a man and his wife libed yuh. Duh
man couldn git wuk an he went away. Attuh he lef, duh wife wuz took
sick; dey say she wuz cunjuhed, [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) an dey sen fuh
duh huzbun. Wen he git home he git a root doctuh tuh visit
uh. [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) Duh root man go tuh duh back step an dig a
hole, an deah he fine nails an sulphuh an haiah an some grabeyahd dut.
In duh pilluhs an mattresses an in duh dressuh draws, dey fine duh same
ting. Dem tings run uh crazy. She ack queah an run away an stay fuh days
at a time. Duh root doctuh moob duh cunjuh an she wuz cuod. He gie uh
duh powuh tuh disappeah an appeah any time she want tuh. I heah bout
lots uh folks wut kin disappeah lak dat. Duh ole folks use tuh tell bout
duh people wut could take wing an fly right back tuh
Africa. [69c](das26.htm#xref_69c.md)

"I alluz know deah wuz witches an ghos. Attuh I gits married muh huzbun
tell me dat he sees ghos. [59](das26.htm#xref_59.md) He describe duh ghos
tuh me. It wuzn long fo I wuz seein duh ghos too. Sometime he would say
tuh me, 'Deah go a spirit. It jis floatin long, ain got no head.' Sho
nuff, deah I would see a shadduh floatin by me.

"Sometime muh huzbun see duh spirit uh some frien ub

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

ours. Dat wuz a sho sign sumpm gwine happen tuh dat pusson, eeduh
sickness aw det. One day he see a ghos ub a close frien uh his. Duh nex.
day he git a tiligram wut say duh frien wuz dead.

"I knowd folks dat wuz witches; dey nebuh bodduhed me but jis picked on
muh huzbun. Ain a night hahdly pass wen dey ain ride
im. [69](das26.htm#xref_69.md) Deah wuz a uhmun libed on duh same street we
did. We use tuh call uh An Sally, duh cunjuh uhmun. She could tell
fawchuns [22](das26.htm#xref_22.md) an gib
hans [8e](das26.htm#xref_8e), [8d](das26.htm#xref_8d.md) an fix yuh enemies
fuh yuh. She ain seem tuh like muh huzbun. Ef she pass our house durin
duh day, dat night she come an ride im. [69](das26.htm#xref_69.md) Dis went
on till he staht pinin away. He git disagreeable roun duh home an denne
went away. He ain nebuh come back. I tink somebody git uh tuh fix
im. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) Dat sho convince me uh duh powuh uh cunjuh."

The spirits of the dead are believed to return and visit their former
neighbors, sometimes as frequently as in life. [56](das26.htm#xref_56.md)
Their presence is not always regarded with dread but is often looked
upon as a natural incident. One woman made the following statement: "I
know deah's ghos, fuh I kin see um. Ef any uh muh friens die, I kin see
um mos anytime. Dey peah jis as natchul as wen dey wuz libe."

On the fringe of the community was a small store at which we stopped for
a few minutes. The proprietress, a robust, good-natured Negro woman of
middle age, talked with us amiably and verified the numerous reports
regarding superstitions that her neighbors had already confided in us.
In parting we inquired if she thought the people's faith in the
supernatural was weakening. The woman regarded us with a wide smile.
Shaking her head she declared emphatically, "No, ma'am, dey sho ain
losin no faith in magic an sech tings. All deah libes dey heah bout um
frum duh ole folks. Seem lak tuh me dey beliebin in um mo an mo all duh
time."
