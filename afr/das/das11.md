# Brownville

Brownville, more prosperous of aspect than the Negro communities usually
fringing business and industry, spreads westward along the edge of
Savannah. Though on its Currytown boundary it, too, contains the
inevitable shacks in lanes, several of its streets, paved and tree
shaded, are lined with good frame and brick houses which are occupied by
the more well-to-do Negroes, among them teachers, doctors, lawyers, and
business men. A substantial school building and the Charity Hospital
speak of advanced social consciousness.

On Bismark Street is found the House of Prayer, one of the many churches
established throughout the country by Bishop Grace. Here several times
each year the leader visits his congregation, and the day on which
"Daddy Grace" <span
id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46) [16](das26.htm#xref_16.md) returns to his
flock is always a gala occasion. Regular members and visitors from
outlying districts crowd the heavy lumber benches of the House of
Prayer. The air is tense with excitement. Above the confusion can be
heard the strident but rhythmic beat of drums. [23](das26.htm#xref_23.md)
Bright splashes of color are given by the crepe paper decorations and
the vividly contrasting military costumes of members of the church
organizations, among which are the Lilies of the Valley, the Queens, the
Royal Guards, the Silver Leaf Band, the Transportation Committee, Male
Ushers No. 1, Male Ushers No. 2, and the Sons and Daughters of the
Prophet. Others in the

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

congregation don their newest and most colorful garments.

Preparation has been made for all emergencies. In attendance are burly
guards whose duty it is to see that nothing occurs to disturb the smooth
performance of the ceremonies. The floor has been thickly sprinkled with
sawdust and the stout posts at the front of the church are padded to
prevent injury to overzealous worshipers.

At the sudden sharp sound of a whistle all activity ceases; there is
silence in the church. The Armor Bearers leave the building to escort
the Bishop to his seat of honor. Soon they return, followed by the Queen
who is arrayed in a pate green satin evening dress over which is worn a
black velvet cape lined with scarlet. A double line of uniformed guards
follows, and marching proudly between the lines is the Bishop. According
to his own statement, the Holy Prophet, as his followers call him, is of
Portuguese birth. His long dark hair which falls to his shoulders, his
piercing eyes, his pointed beard, and sideburns all combine to give him
a distinguished and unusual appearance. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md)

The procession continues to the front of the church, where, with much
ceremony, the Bishop seats himself upon a lofty throne set far back on
the spacious platform. The Queen stands at the Bishop's right, facing
the congregation. The music blares forth with renewed intensity and the
entire

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

multitude, led by the uniformed guard, passes in single file before the
throne. As members approach the Bishop, they pledge themselves to him by
removing their hats and bowing low. In the midst of all this commotion
"Daddy" sits, a remote, detached figure, his downcast eyes seemingly
indicating that he is scarcely aware of this carefully planned
reception.

Between the musical numbers several of the congregation rise and loudly
testify to the miracles that Bishop Grace [22](das26.htm#xref_22.md) has
performed in their behalf. A flourishing sale is conducted in
consecrated handkerchiefs and copies of a newspaper published by the
cult. These are believed to possess unusual healing
powers. [8](das26.htm#xref_8), [12](das26.htm#xref_12.md) A ready market is
also found for large pictures of the Bishop, for it is said that to chew
up his likeness will cure many kinds of illness.

The grand march is spectacular. All those present assemble in the large
center aisle. The band strikes up a lively measure and the procession
starts. At the front of the church the line of march divides, half the
people going down one side aisle, the other half going down the opposite
one. At first the procession is orderly and fairly quiet, but as time
passes, the music becomes increasingly loud. Above the brass instruments
the steady throb of the drum can be heard. Voices are raised in
accompaniment, feet stamp, shoulders sway, and hands
clap. [19](das26.htm#xref_19.md)

Around and around the procession winds. The singing and dancing become
wilder and more abandoned. Many now close their eyes, dancing blindly
and stumbling into those near them and into the benches and posts. By
this time the music is almost deafening and the noise made by the
worshipers is equally loud. The muscles of their bodies twitching
convulsively, they continue in their dance. [46](das26.htm#xref_46.md)

Occasionally one of the participants stops, and, regardless of the
hindrance to the rest of the worshipers, jumps up and down wildly,
crying out in a shrill, hysterical voice. At length, exhausted, he sinks
to the floor and is dragged by friends from under the whirling feet of
the others.

One woman, seized by such a paroxysm, falls to her knees, screaming
incoherently. Exhausted by her violent emotion, she lies on the rough
board floor, her jaws hanging open

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

loosely, her eyes closed. Slowly, she raises her hands and beats them
together muttering, "Praise Daddy. Praise Daddy Grace."

The pulsating rhythm of the instruments increases in tempo. A man leaps
high into the air, gesticulating and babbling; faster and faster he
whirls, until he too falls from utter exhaustion. Still the wild display
continues. The terrific nervous strain is taking its toll, and now all
but a few of the dancers stumble wearily. The steady, insistent sound of
the drum urges them on; feet still shuffle, hands beat out the rhythm,
and voices chant an incoherent incantation.

Abruptly the band ceases and members straggle back to their places.
Those who have fallen out from exhaustion are dragged to the benches by
their friends.

The service continues. During the evening many collections are taken up.
Two of the deacons, acting on behalf of the Bishop, urge the people to
contribute freely. Their methods of approach present a strong contrast.
One, stout, dark-skinned, and clad in a pearl gray suit, has a gentle
and persuasive manner. He says softly to the congregation, "Precious
Haht, hep us tuh raise fawty bucks fuh Daddy Grace right quick. Wile duh
Prophet sits on duh throne befo us, let us all contribute freely tuh
him."

The other deacon, short and wiry, darts about among the congregation.
His manner of speaking is quick, and he barks his orders to first one
and then another of the church members. "Step right up now," he advises.
"Dohn hole back on us. Anybody else now, come right up an contribute.
Ebrybody gib at leas one nickel now wile we still hab duh privilege uh
gibin tuh Daddy. Step up, ebrybody."

Until this point Bishop Grace, apparently indifferent, has had no active
part in the ceremony, but he now steps forward. There is a sudden hush.

"Daddy" becomes an intimate, vivid part of the group. Coming down among
the congregation, he addresses his talk now to one individual, now to
another, dropping frequently into the southern Negro dialect. The theme
of his address is, "Whatsoever a man soweth, that also shall he reap."
The main issue, however, is often sidetracked, and the speaker comments
in turn upon world politics, the war, anecdotes of

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

his own trips abroad, his persecution by enemies, all of whom "the Lord
struck down dead," and the general condition of the local community. The
entire discourse is interspersed with humorous sayings that find a
delighted response. "Daddy" advises his followers strongly against
trusting anyone. "If the angel from Heaven comes down an wants an extra
pair of wings, don't trust him," he warns. "Tell him you ain't got no
time to keep books today. He have to pay cash." Near the conclusion of
his talk the Bishop says that be can accomplish anything he chooses,
even to sinking ships, destroying fleets of planes, or conquering entire
nations. He is not the actual power, he says, but he is so close to it
that he has only to reach out his hand and pull the switch.

After every sentence or two that "Daddy" utters his listeners echo his
statements with such remarks as "Ain't it so, Daddy," "Dat is duh
trute," "Yes Daddy," "You tell em, Daddy," "Hallelujah," "Amen." These
utterances, do not always agree with what the speaker has just said but
nevertheless are meant to express thorough approbation. At one time
"Daddy" tosses to a woman in the congregation a rose he has used in
illustrating a point in his sermon. This unexpected honor overcomes the
recipient to such an extent that she is seized with violent convulsions.

Noticing that the hour is growing late, the Bishop abruptly ends his
talk. There follows a prayer, led by one of the deacons and chanted
rather than spoken. At the end of each line the man's voice catches on a
high sob verging on hysteria, and those in the congregation murmur an
almost inaudible echo of the speaker's plea. The other deacons join in
the recital and in the wild sobbing. At the conclusion of the prayer a
high pitch of excitement is reached.

It is now time for the Bishop to take leave of his flock. Slowly,
reverently, his attendants bring him his top coat and high Stetson hat.
From his pocket "Daddy" draws out a large white handkerchief which he
waves slowly in accompaniment to the closing hymn, a corrupt version of
*Nearer My God To Thee*. The worshipers, too, wave their handkerchiefs
in solemn tribute to their departing leader.

Shortly after a visit from the Bishop we pursued our course

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

of research in Brownville. We found a number of people who had been
named for week days or the month in which they had been born. Thursday
Jones, <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) when questioned about this
particular custom, replied, "Dey name me dat way jis cuz uh happen tuh
be bawn on Tursday, I guess. Sech tings seem tuh be in our fambly. I hab
an uncle whose name is Monday Collins. It seem tuh come duh fus ting tuh
folks' mine tuh name duh babies fuh duh day dey is bawn
on." [20](das26.htm#xref_20.md)

Another man <span id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49.md) told us, "We hab membuhs
in our fambly name Monday, Friday, July an Augus. Dey jis didn tink ub
any name tuh call em but duh day dey wuz bawn. [20](das26.htm#xref_20.md)
Deah wuz two brudduhs call July an Augus an deah two sons wuz name aftuh
um. Some uh deze names go all duh way back tuh slabery time. Duh chillun
jis name aftuh duh kin."

"Ise quainted wid two ole men, one call Uncle Friday, duh othuh Uncle
July," was the statement of a third Brownville resident. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[3](#fn_50.md) "One wuz bawn on Good Friday an duh othuh
on duh Foth uh July." [20](das26.htm#xref_20.md)

We learned that certain foods are viewed with suspicion and are never
eaten or allowed to be brought into the house. [65](das26.htm#xref_65.md)
The exact reason why these foods are forbidden was not explained to us.
One woman said, "One ting I do lak is peanuts, but I dohn eat um. An I
dohn let nobody else eat um in muh house. I dohn know jis wy, but it
bring bad luck all duh week." <span id="fr_51"></span>[4](#fn_51.md)

The palmetto tree, Robert McNichols <span id="fr_52"></span>[5](#fn_52.md)
told us, supplies an edible substance in the form of palmetto cabbage
taken from the center of the tree, about a foot below the top. This is
the terminal bud of the tree, white in color, tender, and resembling the
ordinary northern cabbage. It may be eaten cooked or
uncooked. [45a](das26.htm#xref_45a.md)

From the same tree a wine is made. We learned two different recipes for
the preparation of this beverage. The wine is sometimes made from the
cabbage, which when first cut contains a white sap. The chopped cabbage
is put in a container

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

where it is allowed to ferment, after which it is strained and sugar
added. <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53) [45b](das26.htm#xref_45b.md) The
wine may also be made from the dark blue palmetto berries. These are
placed in a container until fermentation occurs after which the juice is
extracted and sweetened. The wine is a clear dark brown and is said to
have an excellent flavor. Incidentally, the palmetto tree serves a
variety of other purposes. Palmetto fibre is used in making baskets,
rugs, bottle holders, and numerous other
objects. [45](das26.htm#xref_45.md)

Many of the Brownville residents are skilled in palmetto weaving and
also in woodcarving. Walking sticks were brought to our attention. One
had a lizard carved on its handle, <span id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54.md)
while the likeness of a snake twisted its body realistically about the
length of the stick. [50](das26.htm#xref_50.md),
 [70a](das26.htm#xref_70a.md)-h On a similar stick of dull, yellowish wood
the tense, erect head of the large reptile which wrapped itself about
the cane formed the handle. [50](das26.htm#xref_50.md) In the gaping mouth
was held a ball. Even the smallest detail had been delicately and
artistically executed. We could learn little of the history of the stick
except that it had been carved many years ago by an old Negro who had
given it to the present owner and soon afterward moved away from the
section. <span id="fr_55"></span>[3](#fn_55.md) The snake
decorating [50](das26.htm#xref_50.md) a third cane had eyes of
rhinestones [41c](das26.htm#xref_41c.md) which gleamed and flashed as the
stick was moved about. <span id="fr_56"></span>[4](#fn_56.md)

Crude hand-carved wooden table utensils were in use in several
households. [70a](das26.htm#xref_70a.md)-h We were shown a fork with only
two prongs set wide apart on the far sides of the base. One of the
Spoons was about the size of an average tablespoon, but with a bowl of
considerably greater depth. <span id="fr_57"></span>[5](#fn_57.md)

One Negro showed much ingenuity in the carving of a linked chain <span
id="fr_58"></span>[6](#fn_58.md) with a box-like object attached. inside
the box was a small wooden ball. This entire contraption had been made
from one solid piece of wood. [70f](das26.htm#xref_70f.md)-h Another man
employed his spare time in the carving of small wooden

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

dolls, jointed and so designed that they could stand
alone. [41e](das26.htm#xref_41e)-i <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md)

An old Negro living in very poor circumstances owned a number of
interesting objects. <span id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60.md) These he said
he had inherited from a grandfather who had come to this country from
Santo Domingo, West Indies. Among the objects were old coins, a pistol,
and a pocketbook made of shells clamped together with metal bands. The
most significant item, however, was a carved stone fig. The grainy
texture and the slight splits in the skin had been executed with great
skill. The fig had been carried as a charm by the old man's ancestor,
but where this forebear had obtained it we were unable to
learn. [8](das26.htm#xref_8),  [32](das26.htm#xref_32.md),
 [34c](das26.htm#xref_34c.md)

On the Ogeechee Road not far from Brownville we came in contact with a
Negro <span id="fr_61"></span>[3](#fn_61.md) whose favorite pastime was
carving. [70a](das26.htm#xref_70a.md) He showed us the figure of a man,
about twenty-seven inches high, with heavy shoulders and torso
overbalancing the lower part of the figure. The head was large and
square, the eyes were painted on roughly, and the nose and mouth were
attached pieces of wood. A wooden crane and other birds carved by the
same man bore a crude, primitive stamp. [70c](das26.htm#xref_70c.md),
 [70d](das26.htm#xref_70d),  [70g](das26.htm#xref_70g.md)

Near by on the Ogeechee Road we found Tony William Delegal, <span
id="fr_62"></span>[4](#fn_62.md) an old man, well over one hundred years
old, who was formerly a slave of Major John Thomas, Harris Neck,
plantation owner. His dark eyes are filmed, his once powerful shoulders
are bent, but Uncle Tony can still recall incidents which took place
during his childhood on the plantation. Sitting on the front porch of
his daughter's house, he sang an African song to us. Unfortunately he
did not know the English translation. The old man sang the song over and
over and we were finally able to take down the following:

Wa kum kum munin  
Kum baba yano  
Lai lai tambe  
Ashi boong a nomo <span id="page_51">p. 51</span>  
Shi wali go  
Ashi quank.  
Kum baba yano  
Lai  lai tambe  
Ashi lai lai lai  
Shi wali go  
Dhun.

In the heart of the thriving Brownville community live fortune tellers,
root doctors, and vendors of magic charms who conduct flourishing
businesses. [22a](das26.htm#xref_22a),  [22e](das26.htm#xref_22e.md),
 [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) There is a ready market for their wares which
are used for the various activities of daily living. Numerous
perplexities pertaining to. matters of business, luck, and love affairs
are thought to be solved by the mere possession of certain
charms. [8](das26.htm#xref_8.md)

Mattie Sampson, <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) a robust young Negro
woman, told us that she does an active mail order business as
representative of the Lucky Heart Company, the Sweet Georgia Brown
Company, and the Curio Products Company. She supports herself
comfortably by means of selling her credulous neighbors good luck
perfumes, roots, lodestones, and similar charms. "Duh chahms an good
luck puhfumes an powduhs do deah wuk independent of any additional hep,"
Mattie said. "Ef anybody believe a puticuluh chahm is wut dey need,
well, dat chahm will do duh wuk."

"Mos of muh customuhs depen on special chahms tuh bring em good luck,"
the young woman continued. "Dey nevuh puhmit deah supply tuh give out
but awduh it ovuh an ovuh. I have sevral bes selluhs. One is duh *Mystic
Mojo Love Sachet*. Dis is sometimes call *Quick Love Powduh* an is
guaranteed tuh make yuh populuh, successful, an happy. Yuh use it tuh

powduh is wone in a bag aroun duh neck aw rubbed on duh body. But ef yuh
prefuh, yuh kin sprinkle it in duh dressuh draw aw in duh bottom uh duh
shoes.

"*Mystic Mojo Incense* is anudduh one uh muh bes selluhs. On duh box it
says dis is duh same incense used by duh Hindus an Arabs an Tuks, an
also duh Egyptians, an Chinese.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In every box is
five diffunt culluhs, each one fuh a diffunt puhpose." From a box which
Mattie had on hand we took down the directions: "Work the magic spell
now. Just hold *Mystic Mojo* in hand and light match to tip. Perfumed
with rare fragrance and exotic sandalwood, myrrh and incense. Price 25¢.
Sweet and strong."

Mattie also constantly reorders a product known as *Magnetic Lodestone
in Holy Oil*. "Dis is used," she explained, "tuh drive away evil spirits
an bad luck an tuh bring yuh luck in love, an business, an gamblin
games. Den deah's *Five Finguh Grass*. A lot uh duh people heah are sked
of witches an spirits visitin em at night. Dey hang *Five Finguh Grass*
ovuh deah bed aw doeway tuh protec duh whole house." Some of em use
*Black Cat Incense an Powduh*."

A few blocks from Mattie Sampson lives William Edwards <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md) who follows the diverse trades of root
doctor, [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) piano tuner, and watchman at a filling
station. For a while the old man stubbornly insisted that, although he
had been a popular root doctor in his younger days, he had not treated a
patient in years. After a good deal of casual friendly conversation, he
at length admitted that he was at present doctoring a man who had
malaria. He also admitted that he was treating a cousin for an ailment
and said that by the use of roots he had recently cured another patient
of kidney trouble.

"Muh roots kin cuo mos any pains," he said earnestly. "I wuks on dogs
too. I kin cuo a mad dog in lessn a day ef dey git tuh me in time. I
make muh medicine frum King Physics. It grows on duh salts an is bery
plentiful neah Montgomery, but yuh hab tuh know how tuh fine it.

"Duh spiduh is bote good and ebil an is useful tuh man. I make a

"Tuh keep ghos away, missus, yuh hab tuh go in duh woods an fine a tree

keep witches frum ridin yuh is keep a Bible unduh yuh pilluh at
night." [12](das26.htm#xref_12.md)

Another root doctor <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) in the section
told us that he had been born with a special knowledge of healing and
had studied the science of herbs from the time he was a small
boy. [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) Some of the herbs he uses in his mixtures
are Golden Seal, Yellow Dust, Golden Thread, Hippo Root, Pink Root, Lady
Slipper, Yellow Root, Blood Root, Rattlesnake Master, Black Snake Root,
and John the Conqueror.

"I know in a dream," he said, "jis wen a patient is comin to consult me
an I know head uh time zackly wut kine uh herbs tuh gadduh in awduh tuh
cuo im."

He had been born with this power to foretell the future, he
asserted. [22a](das26.htm#xref_22a),  [22e](das26.htm#xref_22e.md) "Outside
uh dreams," he went on, "I kin use leaves an coffee grouns an a suttn
kine uh seed known as duh sensitive aw jumpin seed. Yuh fine deze seeds
at suttn times long duh sho uh duh Wes Indies. Yuh hab tuh keep duh
seeds in a closed containuh aw dey will jis disappeah. Tuh tell fawchuns

Yuh." [22b](das26.htm#xref_22b.md)-d

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

Conjure is being practiced all the time, the root doctor informed us.
"Frawgs an lizuds an sech tings is injected intuh people's bodies an duh
people den fall ill an sometime
die. [5](das26.htm#xref_5), [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) Udduh strange tings
is happenin, too. Take duh story uh dem people wut fly back tuh Africa.
Das all true. Yuh jis hab tuh possess magic knowledge tuh be able tuh

Yes, ma'am, I know wut yuh hab tuh hab in awduh tuh fly aw vanish away,
but it is mighty hahd tuh git. It's duh bone ub a black cat."

A woman <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md) informant, too, had heard
about flying Africans and persons who could disappear at
will. [69c](das26.htm#xref_69c.md) She said also that she had often been
ridden by witches. "Dey seem tuh come frum. noweah an staht chokin
yuh. [69](das26.htm#xref_69.md) Witches an root men hab duh same magic
powuh."

Relative to the custom of placing food and possessions on a new grave
this woman spoke earnestly. "Dis wuz a common ting wen I wuz young. Dey
use tuh put duh tings a pusson use las on duh
grabe. [47](das26.htm#xref_47.md) Dis wuz suppose tuh satisfy duh spirit an
keep it frum followin yuh back tuh duh house, I knowd a uhmun at

cake, pies, an wine. Den she would carry dishes too an set out a regluh
dinnuh fuh duh daughtuh an uhsef. She say duh daughtuh's spirit meet uh
deah an dey dine tuhgedduh."

Another woman <span id="fr_67"></span>[2](#fn_67.md) told us that on
holidays she carried food to her husband's grave and left it there for
the spirit to come and get. [58](das26.htm#xref_58.md) "I carry duh kine uh
food we use tuh hab tuh eat on duh days be wuz off frum wuk," she said.
"I take cooked chicken an cake an pie an cigahs--he like tuh smoke attuh
eatin. [58a](das26.htm#xref_58a),  [58b](das26.htm#xref_58b.md) I do dis
cuz I know he will be lookin fuh me tuh bring it.

"Ebuh since I kin membuh I hab heahd bout spirits wanduhin roun at
night," [59](das26.htm#xref_59.md) she continued. "Muh mothuh nebuh

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

We found that belief in supernatural beings such as witches and ghosts
was widespread throughout the community.

"Witches is lak folks," one woman said. <span
id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md) "Dey done sell demsefs tuh duh debil an he
make em do anyting he wants tuh. Some git a grudge gense yuh an stahts
tuh ride yuh. [69](das26.htm#xref_69.md) No mattuh wut yuh do, dey kin git
in yuh house. Sometime dey come lak a mouse, sometime a rabbit, an
sometime eben a roach. [68](das26.htm#xref_68.md) I membuh heahin bout a
witch wut come ebry night lak a rabbit an rode a woman. A man wut knowd
duh woman laid a trap fuh duh witch. Duh witch scape frum duh house, but
duh dogs track uh down. Wen she see she wuz caught, she beg duh man not
tuh do nuttn tuh uh an she wouldn nebuh do no mo witchin."

A Negro preacher <span id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_69.md) in a near by
section said that he had been in the habit of seeing ghosts all his
life. [56](das26.htm#xref_56), [59](das26.htm#xref_59.md) "Once wuz jis
aftuh muh fathuh died. I saw him all dressed up an weahin a Stetson hat.
I called muh mothuh an said, 'Mothuh, heah come Papa.' Wen I tun roun,
he wuz gone.

"Aftuh I marry I moob out by duh watuh wuks. A frien uh mine name Arthur
Perry die. Some time latuh anothuh frien die. One night I wuz lyin down
wen I heah a noise. I look up an deah wuz two men all dressed up in
wite, walkin cross dat room. As I watch em dey begin tuh shrink till dey
wuzn no bigguhn dawls. Den dey disappeah. I see ghos mos any time, so
Ise used to it now."

That he was frequently visited by both witches and ghosts was the
assertion of another man. <span id="fr_70"></span>[3](#fn_70.md) "Duh
witches come in an strangle me," [69](das26.htm#xref_69.md) he said, "but
duh ghos yuh jis see, an no

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

hahm come frum um. Jis las night attuh I gone tuh bed a ghos come in muh
house. [59](das26.htm#xref_59.md) I hab tuh git up an run im out. Sometime
dey pull duh cubbuh right off muh bed."

The same man said considerable conjuring was being practiced in the
neighborhood, but that he kept a careful distance from people who were
believed to be able to "do tings tuh yuh." [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md)

"Yuh see," he volunteered, "I hab muh leg fix once. Dat wuz back in
1893. Fus muh foot swell up, den muh leg. It wuz so bad I couldn walk. A
man tole me tuh go tuh Doctuh Buzzud, a root
doctuh. [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) Doctuh Buzzud gimme some root medicine
an in no time I wuz all right." [6](das26.htm#xref_6.md)

A more recent case of attempted conjure was told us by the woman <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) who had been the intended
victim. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) We found her living in new quarters
where she had hurriedly moved to escape the evil influences directed
towards her by the downstairs tenants in her former residence. Stout and
middle-aged, she had not yet recovered from her fright at the time she
was interviewed. As she talked, her dark eyes rolled wildly and her
manner betrayed signs of extreme agitation.

"Dem folks wuz detuhmined tuh git muh spirit. Ef dey do dat, den I go
crazy an nobody could hep me. Dey hab a' dog trained wut would git unduh
muh winduh an bahk twice tuh git me tuh look out. Ise on tuh em an uh
stay shut in muh ruhm. Den dey would blow a automobile hawn twice.
Sometime dey would beat on a sycamo tree in front uh duh house an call
muh name, 'Tressie, Tressie, Tressie, wake up! Yuh gwine tuh sleep alluh
time?'

"Dey bun all kine uh powduh unduh muh winduh. [8b](das26.htm#xref_8b.md) I
moob muh bedruhm, but dey fine it out an somehow dey make holes unduh
muh bed. Attuh twelve o'clock dey staht bunnin powduh an roots an callin
muh name agen. Duh nex mawnin I fine all kines uh tings on muh poach,
red peppuh an haiah an some kine uh powduh an some bus eggs.

"One night I see em bunnin some kine uh powduh unduh muh winduh. Dat sho
sked me. I run upsteahs, and git muh huzbun's gun. Den I stan in duh
back uh duh house listenin.

"I heah a voice callin way off. It keep sayin 'Tressie,

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Tressie,' tryin
tuh git me tuh ansuh. I didn say nuttn, cuz ef uh ansuh tuh muh name den
muh spirit would be stole. I heah muh name obuh an obuh an it seems dat
it go right tru me. I take duh gun an fyuh two shot tru duh flo. Duh
voice stop right off. Den somebody call a pleeceman. Wen he speak tuh
me, I tell im all bout duh root wuk an wy uh fyuhd duh gun. I ax im
wouldn he uh done duh same an he say, 'Cose, but dohn do it agen.'

"I bin tuh duh poeleece tuh hep me but dey cuss me out. Once wen dat
poeleece show up, duh uhmun wut tryin tuh fix me staht combin uh haiah.
She kep it up till duh poeleece jis walk away. Den I went tuh a root
doctuh an he tole me duh poeleece caahn do nuttn long as duh uhmun comb
uh haiah. He tell me tuh use tuhpentine tuh destroy duh ban wut she put
down fuh me. Duh uhmun jist keep on wukin gense me an nobody couldn do
nuttn tuh stop uh so I know I bettuh moob fo she git muh spirit."

In Brownville we found a man who knew how to make the old time drums. He
made one for us out of a hollow log, across the end of which he tightly
stretched a goat skin. He fastened the skin to the log by means of a
number of wooden Pegs. Unlike modern drums, this one was taller than it
was wide, measuring about eighteen inches in length and ten inches in
diameter. [25](das26.htm#xref_25.md)

The drum maker, James Collier, <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md) a
middle-aged, intelligent, well-educated Negro, said he had made a number
of drums in this primitive manner. Collier told us that he had heard of
drums having been used during funeral ceremonies in former years. The
mourners beat the drum while on the way to the cemetery; after arriving
they marched around the, grave in a ring and beat the drum and
shouted. [24](das26.htm#xref_24.md) "They call it the dead march,"
explained the man.

"The spirit don't stay in the grave," he went on. "When the funeral
procession stahts tuh leave, the spirit leaves the body an follows the
people frum the graveyahd. It nevuh stays with the
body." [66](das26.htm#xref_66.md) A little later he volunteered the
additional information, "Fuh the spirit tuh rest in the grave folks

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

have tuh be buried at home. They nevuh feel right ef they buried frum
home. The spirit jist wanduh aroun. [1](das26.htm#xref_1.md)

"I have seen something I think wuz a ghost. I have no explanation of it,
but I think it wuz supuhnatural. I have heard of witchcraft, cunjuh an
magic. I believe some of these things happen, and the mo yuh probe intuh
them the less yuh know.

"I have heard about a magic hoe that folks put in the gahden. They speak
certain words tuh it; then the hoe goes ahead an cultivates the gahden
without anyone touching it. They jist tell it tuh do the wuk and it does
it." [39](das26.htm#xref_39.md)

We questioned Collier again about his personal experiences with
supernatural beings and he related the following story:

"Wen I wuz jist a young boy muh family use tuh live in Currytown. Me and
muh brothuh use tuh go and see muh aunt who lived in Yamacraw. Tuh get
frum our house tuh wheah she lived we had tuh go past a cemetery which
wuz in back of the Union Station.

"One time we had been tuh see muh aunt and it got tuh be late. We
stahted fuh home. It wuz beginnin of night. Muh brothuh he had
rheumatism an he wuz hobblin along on a stick. We stahted along by a
fence tuh get tuh West Broad Street an wen we had gone about a hundred
yards we saw a lady comin tuhwards us. [59](das26.htm#xref_59.md) She wuz
very feah, very feah, an she wuz all dressed in black and had on a long
black veil. Her dress wuz black silk and rustled as she walked.

"Muh brothuh an I, we were suhprised tuh see the lady all of a sudden,
fuh we hadn't noticed her befo. She come up tuh us an she say, 'Are yuh
goin roun the fence?' We tell her we wuz an she say, 'Yuh not afraid?'
an we say, 'No--we not afraid.'

"The lady wanted tuh walk with us an we all staht walkin along. We had
gone a short ways wen all of a sudden we look in the cemetery an we see
a little white thing risin up out of the groun. It wuz kinduh hazy an
shadowy an it spring up from the groun an streak out tuh meet us on the
path ahead. it looked like a lill animal. [54](das26.htm#xref_54.md)

"The lady, wen she see the lill white sumpms a comin, she daht out like
lightin an she go right tuh meet it. Wen she get tuh it she disappeah
right intuh the eah, disappeah right

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

befo our eyes. Muh brothuh fuhgot he wuz crippled, he drop his stick an
staht runnin, an I run too. An we nevuh stop runnin, kept right on goin
till we got home tuh Currytown. He don't like to speak of it tuhday
cause we're not supuhstitious."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_46"></span>[43:1](das11.htm#fr_46.md) Though the meetings of
Bishop Grace are common to many parts of the United States, it was
thought well to include an accurate description of the House of Prayer
as it was found in this Community.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[44:1](das11.htm#fr_47.md) Details of the early
life of "Daddy Grace" are clothed in obscurity and little can be learned
of the real origin of the House of Prayer. Some claim that he is of West
Indian birth, others that he was born Marcilino Manuel Garcia in
Portugal, and still others interpret his references to "a land beyond
the sea" as indication that he hails from Egypt. All members of the cult
must be baptized and during a four-week session in 1936 1,789 candidates
were ministered to at a charge of

1.00 each. The Bishop advocates that members give generously of their
material goods to the church and he has been known on occasions to go
about among his congregation seizing purses and demanding that
worshipers sacrifice treasured jewelry. It is a well known fact that his
profession of "spiritual leader" has proved a vastly profitable one, and
in the course of the last several years he has amassed a huge fortune.
Many of "Daddy's" enterprises are looked upon with disfavor and
suspicion by the police department. His frequent clashes with the law
over various matters of an extremely worldly nature serve only to
increase the attendance and the collections at the church and also give
the Bishop much desired publicity. Followers are unimpressed by his
occasional arrests, secure in the knowledge that no earthly force can
ever conquer "Daddy." See *Time* (New York), March 7,1938, XXXI, No. 10,
p. 30.
