# White Bluff

Huge, moss-hung oaks form a canopy and cast filigreed shadows upon the
White Bluff Road, which passes directly through the quiet Negro
community of White Bluff, eight miles southeast of Savannah.

Winding roads turn from the main highway and terminate in the various
sections which form the settlement and which are known as Nicholsonboro,
Rose Dhu, Twin Hill, and Cedar Grove. The sections east of the White
Bluff Road are on the Vernon River. It is here that many of the
inhabitants make their living by catching crab and fish which they sell
in the city markets. West of the highway the narrow roads lead through
thickly wooded areas of great beauty. Along these roads families have
cleared small tracts and built their homes, reserving garden space for
flowers and vegetables. In the summer wild crepe myrtle trees, with
blossoms as luscious a red as the heart of the watermelon, contrast
colorfully with the bright blue paint on the doors and trimmings of some
of the houses.

The White Bluff Road, which for two miles forms the main street of the
community, passes the houses of other residents set well back from the
road. Most of them are small and unpretentious but well kept. At
intervals of perhaps half a mile are three rural grocery stores; farther
along is a whitewashed church with red and blue glass windows, and at
the farthest extremity of the settlement is a similar but larger church.

The inhabitants, of which there are approximately four hundred, are
deeply religious and lay great stress on being

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Christian
people." Many of the older inhabitants were formerly slaves on a large
plantation on St. Catherines Island. After the War between the States
many of these Negroes moved to White Bluff, built their homes, reared
their families, and have lived to see two generations reach maturity.
With all their fervent Christian doctrines the old people have an
unwavering faith in many of the beliefs taught them by their
grandparents. A few remember their ancestors who were brought from
Africa on slave ships.

The younger group seem carefree as they perform their tasks in the cool
part of the morning. It is not unusual to see several young men lying on
a shady porch resting or happily engaged in a card game as early as ten
o'clock on a summer morning. These young people have little faith in the
practices of their elders, but they believe profoundly in the power of
certain charms to affect luck and love. [8](das26.htm#xref_8.md)

Having heard that Sophie Davis was one of the oldest persons in the
community, we visited her and found her cordial in her reception.
Sophie <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) does not know her exact age,
but was eight at the time of the war. She is very short and very stout
with gray hair and a very large smiling face. The day we saw her she
wore a cotton print dress with gray predominating. Her sparkling eyes
expressed her interest in current happenings of the community, and when
she laughed, her eyes became mere slits and her shoulders shook.

Indicating a small bush growing beside the doorway of her little cabin,
Sophie told us, "Some uh duh folks heah sho belieb in some queah tings.
Yuh see dis lill bush--it call Cherokee an mos uh duh folks yuh plants
it at duh doe. It bring um good luck. [34c](das26.htm#xref_34c.md) Lot uh
medicine an cuos is made frum udduh roots and herbs an some uh duh folks
uses um wen dey's sick." [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md)

We inquired as to the kind of herbs used.

"Duh wite root," pointing to a wild shrub, "dey use fuh stomach
troubles. Buttuh root an palmettuh root an May apple, yuh bile tuhgedduh
wid a quawt uh watuh till it simmuh down tuh haf uh pint, den yuh add
some cawn wisky. Dat a fambly tonic tuh buil yuh up."

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

Sophie went on to tell us something about the beliefs prevailing in the
neighborhood. "Ef some relative is sick, yuh dohn nebuh deah tuh sew on
a gahment wut yuh is weahin cuz dat put a spell on duh sick un an dey
mos liable tuh die. [49](das26.htm#xref_49.md) Deah's anudduh ting too. Yuh
sho bettuh not steal tings frum a grabe. [64](das26.htm#xref_64.md) I sho
know I wouldn. Deah's jis a lot uh udduh tings bout bad luck too. One
sho sign is dat ef a pusson sneeze wile dey's eatin long, dat is, dey
hab food in dey mout, den dey got tuh put it out lessn dey hab bad
luck. [52](das26.htm#xref_52.md) Anudduh sign is duh hootin ub a
owl." [44](das26.htm#xref_44.md)

A strange look of doubt and amusement came into Sophie's eyes at the
mention of conjuring. She smiled and slowly shook her head.

"I heahd ub a few cases weah dey say one uh duh neighbuhs cunjuh
anudduh, [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) but fuh duh mos paht dey all gits long
all right. Das cuz we's all Christians an dohn put no faith much in dem
kine uh tings. Dey say dat a powuhful chahm kin be made frum grabeyahd
dut [9](das26.htm#xref_9.md) fuh cunjuhin puhposes, but duh pusson dat git
duh dut mus put some pennies on duh grabe, else he hab trouble hissef.
Nebuh let a enemy git any ub yuh haiah wut bin cut off aw yuh nail
clippins. Ef he git deze he kin make sumpm dat will cause lot uh
trouble. [10](das26.htm#xref_10.md) I kin tell yuh sumpm else bout duh
haiah too. Ef a bud gits duh haiah, yuh'll hab a headache soon.

"Now Uncle John Bowen on St. Catherines he wuz a root man an one time a
man come tuh him tuh git somebody fix. Uncle John he wuz fixin tings tuh
linguh um, an duh man sit on duh cheah weah he hab duh cunjuh tings an
Uncle John he git so mad he git right up an fix duh cunjuh right now so
dat man wut awduh duh fixin die hesef. He fix lot uh people. Deah so
much debilment in ole Uncle John Bowen dat finally he eat out hesef till
he fix hesef an die." We asked about the use of drums.

"Yes'm, dey alluz use tuh beat duh drum wen somebody die tuh let duh
udduh folks know bout duh det. An at fewnuls too, dey beat it."

Relative to spirits, she replied, "No'm, I caahn see spirits cuz I ain
bawn wid a caul. But now Bob Delegal he knows spirits. Down on
Blackbeard Ilun, deah wuz a big hawg wut wuz a ebil spirit. Dey call um
Blackbeard an dey try an try

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

tuh kill um. So ole Bob Delegal cut up some silbuh an put it in he gun.
He aim at duh hawg but he miss um an ole Bob Delegal fall down an couldn
speak. Dey carry um home an he nebuh did talk no mo, an duh nex day he
die."

According to Sophie the old people on St. Catherines would pray at the
rising and at the setting of the sun and at the conclusion of their
prayers they would say the words "Meena, Mina, Mo." Asked if she knew
the meaning of these words, she shook her head negatively.

"Yuh know, Susie Branch, who lib jis cross duh road deah, could tell yuh
some uh deze tings too. We wuz chillun tuhgedduh down on St. Catherines
Ilun. I gwine call uh."

In a moment Susie <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md) arrived. Tall and
thin, she was dressed in a red, green, and blue cotton plaid skirt and a
man's shirt with the tail hanging loosely outside. She was very
talkative and was enthusiastic in verifying many of the things that
Sophie had mentioned.

Susie listened gravely as we inquired about her recollections of the old
people in her family. She told us the following story: "Dey steal muh
great-great-gran, uh name wuz Sukey, frum off duh beach in Africa wen
she wuz a young miss. I dunno wut paht ub Africa she come frum. She
alluz say she come frum Africa, duh country weah dey dohn weah no cloze.
At duh plantation at St. Catherines she wuz duh seamstress fuh duh
slabes. She make mos all dey weah."

When we asked her if she ever heard that dreaming about a snake "meant
anything," the old woman replied, "Yes, ma'am, dat mean yuh got a
enemy. [51](das26.htm#xref_51.md) Not many nights ago I dream bout a snake
an uh sho wuz sked wen uh wake up."

They both laughed and Susie leaned over and tapped Sophie on the arm and
said, "Oh yes, deah's lots uh dem tings bout babies. Wen dey bawn wid a
caul, das sho a sign dey will be bery wise an kin talk wid duh
spirits. [4](das26.htm#xref_4.md) Ain dasso, Sophie?"

Agreeing, Sophie hastened to add what she had heard about babies born
with teeth. "Dey will hab bad luck all deah
libes. [66](das26.htm#xref_66.md) Dat sho wuk out. Deah wuz one boy bawn
dat way wut lib right yuh in Wite Bluff an he wine up by bein in duh
chain-gang an dat sho nuff bad luck."

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

"But dis lill plant heah called 'Cherokee' is spose tuh bring good luck
ef yuh plants it by duh front doe step" [34c](das26.htm#xref_34c.md) said
Susie.

In this community as in many others strangers are not allowed to be
buried in the local cemetery but in what is known as the "strangers
lot," a piece of ground set apart from the cemetery proper. The custom
of bringing the dead back to their original home for interment is also
prevalent throughout coastal Georgia. The body of a young man who
recently died in New York was brought back to White Bluff for burial.
Relative to this custom, Susie spoke quietly. "Dey alluz brings um back
tuh bury um ef dey kin git duh money, cuz yuh see duh spirit'll jis
wanduh roun an nebuh be satisfied lessn it brung back home tuh be
buried."'

I know Lunnon Grayson know all bout dem tings too. Yuh tun off tuh duh
lef at duh fus road leadin off frum duh highway yuh. Ax anybody den, an
dey'll tell yuh wich is his house. He use tuh lib on St. Catherines too,
but he come up yuh long fo me an Susie," Sophie said.

Lunnon <span id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md) remembered a great deal about
the old customs. Seated in his front yard under the shade of a crepe
myrtle tree, he and Prince Sneed were chatting. Lunnon's hair was snow
white and wooly. On his left ear was a gold earring, which he claimed
tended to improve his eyesight. [27](das26.htm#xref_27.md) When he laughed
he bent double and slapped his knees with his bands; at the same time
his mouth opened wide, revealing his three remaining teeth. At first he
was reluctant to admit that he had heard much about conjuring. He
finally admitted, between chuckles, that be had heard about it from his
mother and grandmother but vehemently denied any belief in conjure
himself. He was serious, however, as he told the following story about
Prince Sneed's father-in-law, who was being conjured at the time.

"I lib in White Bluff fuh bout fifty yeahs, an I kin tell yuh many
stories I heahd bout cunjuhin an root doctuhs. Somebody heahbouts put an
ebil spell on Prince Sneed's fathuh-in-law, Lunnon
Milton. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) He seem tuh git wus an wus an nuttn seem
tuh hep him none. Finally he sen fuh a root doctuh an

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

he wuk obuh im. but he dohn git no bettuh. [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) He
call in eight ub um altuhgedduh, but dey dohn seem able tuh countuhrack
dat cunjuh. [6](das26.htm#xref_6.md) Duh ole man sick tuh dis day. Maybe
some day he fine a root doctuh wut is powful nuff tuh hep
him." [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md)

As Uncle Lunnon finished his story, Prince Sneed, <span
id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md) a dark man of splendid physique despite
his sixty-odd years, added, "It's lak dis. Wen Ise sick, I gonuh see a
doctuh right away. Now muh faduh-in-law, he jis keep on wid dem root
doctuhs, but he say he ain gittin a bit bettuh."

Prince proved to be an interesting talker, much of his knowledge having
been gleaned from conversations by the fireside with his grandfather.
The following narrative was still fresh in his memory:

"Muh gran say ole man Waldburg down on St. Catherine own some slabes wut
wuzn climatize an he wuk um hahd an one day dey wuz hoein in duh fiel an
duh dribuh come out an two ub um wuz unuh a tree in duh shade, an duh
hoes wuz wukin by demsef. Duh dribuh say 'Wut dis?' an dey say, 'Kum
buba yali kuni buba tambe, Kum kunka yali kum kunka tambe,' quick like.
Den dey rise off duh groun an fly away. Nobody ebuh see um no mo. Some
say dey fly back tuh Africa. Muh gran see dat wid he own eye."

He had heard that on Blackbeard Island it was customary in the old days
for a group of men to agree upon a location in which to bury their
money, whereupon one of them would voluntarily offer his life and be put
to death at the hands of the others, thereby enabling his spirit to
stand guard and protect the treasure.

"I seen a spirit muhsef once wen I wuz a young man," Prince continued.
"It wuz late in duh aftuhnoon. I wuz cookin crab an uh look up an see a
man widout a head. I look away, den uh look back tuh weah uh see im, an
sho nuff deah he is in plain sight. I rush tuh duh house an staht tuh
tell muh fostuh mudduh but she stop me. She dohn wahn me tuh talk bout
it. Den duh nex day she ax me wut uh see an fix me sumpm tuh drink an I
nebuh did see no mo spirit."

Another woman in the community, Bessie Royal, <span
id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_87.md) in relation

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

to her belief in witchcraft and conjure said, "Lots uh people roun yuh
say dat hags ride um at night. [69](das26.htm#xref_69.md) None ub um ebuh
bodduhed me. Dey say dat duh hags is libe folks wut hab duh powuh tuh
change demsefs intuh animals an insecs an any udduh ting dey want tuh
be. [68](das26.htm#xref_68.md)

"I dohn know how it wuz done but muh faduh wuz
cunjuhed [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) by a suttn uhmun dat wuz said to be a
hag. [69](das26.htm#xref_69.md) He go crazy sometimes an ack lak he wuz
sked by sumpm chasin im. He git wus and dey take im tuh a root doctuh.
Duh root doctuh say he wuz cunjuhed. He hab us ketch a wite chicken wich
he split open wile duh chicken wuz; still libe. He place dis chicken,
blood an all wile it wuz still wome, on top uh muh faduh head an boun it
deah.

"Well, muh faduh git bettuh fuh a wile. Den all at once he hab anudduh
attack an he die befo duh doctuh could git tuh im. Attuh dis I belieb in
cunjuh mo dan ebuh."

Later that same day we visited a small Negro cabin set deep in the woods
some distance from the highway. Here lived Serina Hall, <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) born eighty-eight years ago on St.
Catherines Island and a former slave of Jacob Waldburg. She said that
when she was a small child her master had brought the members of her
family to Savannah to be employed as house servants.

The old woman at first disclaimed any knowledge of conjure or the
existence of supernatural creatures. After a time, however, her attitude
changed and she launched into a lengthy discussion of the current
beliefs.

"I dohn lak tuh talk bout dem tings," she began, "but I hab tuh belieb
wut muh eyes see. I membuh once a man uh knew well got kill. Attuh he
wuz buried his spirit use tuh folluh me all duh time. I feel a heat come
tuh me, den uh look roun, an deah a shadduh ub a man pass by. I ax duh
spirit, 'Wut you want?' Den it leab me lone an I ain seen dat spirit
sence." [56](das26.htm#xref_56),  [59](das26.htm#xref_59.md)

We asked Serina if she had ever known any conjure workers and she said,
"Witches an root men is duh same ting. Dey kin tun demsefs intuh any
shape, a insec, a cat, aw a dog, aw any kine uh
animal. [68](das26.htm#xref_68.md) Dey kin go tru any kine uh hole tuh git
at yuh.

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

"Tub tun intuh sumpm else dey hab tuh hab duh powuh tuh take off deah
skin. I heahd bout somebody watchin a hag take off is skin. He git some
salt an peppuh an rub it on duh skin. [69a](das26.htm#xref_69a.md) Wen duh
hag go tuh put is skin back on, duh salt an peppuh bun so he couldn git
it on. Duh folks wuz able tuh ketch im an dey fine it wuz one uh deah
neighbuhs. He beg an plead an so dey fuhgib im. Dey nebuh hab no mo hag
ridin. [69](das26.htm#xref_69.md)

"Muh ma tell me many times bout a man an his wife wut could wuk
cunjuh. [48](das26.htm#xref_48.md) Anytime dey want tuh dey would fly back
tuh Africa an den come back agen tuh duh plantation. Dey come back cuz
dey hab some chillun wut didn hab duh powuh tuh fly an hab tuh stay on
duh plantation. One ub duh daughtuhs wanted tuh lun tuh fly an wuk
cunjuh. Duh faduh tell uh she hab tuh lun duh passwud, den she hab tuh
kill a man by cunjuh. [15](das26.htm#xref_15.md) Attuh dis den she would
hab duh powuh. Duh magic passwud mean sumpm like dis, 'Who loss duh key
Branzobo?'"
