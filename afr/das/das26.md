# APPENDIX

<span id="xref_1">1</span>. BURIAL AT HOME

<span id="xref_1a">1a</span> *Basden says of the Ibo*: "The desire of
every Ibo man and woman is to die in their own town or, at least, to be
buried within its precincts. For a long period it was very difficult to
persuade a man to travel any distance from his native place, and if he
were in need of medical assistance an Ibo would seldom agree to go from
home in spite of assurances that he would be able to have better
treatment elsewhere. in case of death occurring at a distance, if it can
be done at all, the brethren will bring the body home for burial. It may
be that this cannot be done for several days, according to distance and
other circumstances."  
*Among the Ibos of Nigeria, pp. 115-16*.

<span id="xref_1b">1b</span> Bosman says of the coast of Guinea: "The
Negroes are strangely fond of being buried in their own Country; so that
if any Person dies out of it, they frequently bring his Corpse home to
be buried, unless it be too far distant."  
*Description of the Coast of Guinea, p. 232*.

<span id="xref_1c">1c</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: 'When a man dies at
a distance from his home his body is always taken back, when possible,
to his home, wrapped up in mats covered by a cloth and placed on a bier
or cradle, which is carried on the shoulders of his relatives. The
reason assigned for this is that the dead must not be severed from the
company of other ancestors--they should be buried close to their living
descendants on whom they are dependent for nourishment. Moreover, it is
important that the ritual traditional to the kindred should be carried
out accurately. This cannot be done by strangers."  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, p. 309*.

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

<span id="xref_1d">1d</span> *Nassau says of the Bihe country*: "It is
considered essential that a man should die in his own country, if not in
his own town, On the way to Bailundu, shortly after leaving Bihe
territory, I met some men running at great speed, carrying a sick man
tied to a pole, in order that he might die in his own country."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 228*.

<span id="xref_2">2</span>. BURIAL OF SECTIONS OF BODY

<span id="xref_2a">2a</span> *Burton says of Gelele*: "Amongst the Egbas
and various tribes of the Congo family . . ., various small parts of the
body are brought home to be reinterred."  
*A Mission to Gelele, King of Dahome*, II, *165*.

<span id="xref_2b">2b</span> *Ellis says of the Gold Coast*: "*Toh-fo*,
'one lost' is a ceremony held when a person has met with death, and the
body has either been destroyed or cannot be found; for instance, when a
man has been burned to death and the body reduced to ashes, or when one
has been drowned and the body cannot be recovered. . . . In the case of
a man destroyed by fire, some of the ashes of the burned body, or of the
house in which it was consumed, are placed in the coffin with similar
ceremonies.

"In this ceremony a fragment of the corpse is always interred if
possible; and, if no portion of it can be found, some earth, water, or
other substance from the locality in which the death occurred."  
*The Tshi-Speaking Peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa, p. 223*.

<span id="xref_3">3</span>. BURIAL OF RELATIVES AND STRANGERS

<span id="xref_3a">3a</span> *Pearce says of West Africa*: "There is a
strong feeling of kinship in Africa and only relatives may be buried in
the same piece of ground together."  
(Interview with John Pearce of Hinesville, Ga., an ex-missionary in West
Africa.)

<span id="xref_4">4</span>. CAUL

<span id="xref_4a">4a</span> *Beckwith says of Jamaica*: "A baby born
with a caul has the power to see duppies without the duppies' harming
him. Parkes was born with a caul and attributed his frequent visions of
ghosts to this circumstance."  
*Black Roadways, p. 57*.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

<span id="xref_4b">4b</span> *Herskovits says*: "Born with a caul is
significant in Dahomey, West Africa, Dutch Guiana, Jamaica, and probably
everywhere among the New World Negroes."  
From correspondence dated October 10, 1938.

<span id="xref_4c">4c</span> *Peterkin says*: "Animals have 'second
sight' and can see spirits, but only people born with cauls over their
faces have this keen vision."  
*Roll, Jordan, Roll, p. 206*.

<span id="xref_4d">4d</span> *Beckwith says*: "The caul is also
connected with sympathetic magic of a healing, rather than an injurious
kind. It should be removed and carefully parched over a hot brick and a
bit put into the baby's tea to prevent convulsions due to the irritation
of a ghost."  
*Black Roadways, p. 57*.

<span id="xref_4e">4e</span> *Herskovits says of Haiti*: "A child born
with a can\] is believed to be strong in combating all evil spirits. The
caul is dried and reduced to powder, and the infant is given some of the
powder in water two or three days after birth."  
*Life in a Haitian Valley, p. 95*.

<span id="xref_4f">4f</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "A child born
with a caul--'with a veil over its face'--who follows the first child
after twins, is called, if a boy Wusu^, if a girl Wúmé. The child born
after such a one is called Wu^sâ or Wuhwê, according to sex. If the
child with the caul does not follow the first child born after twins,
then the names given are Kesu^ or Kesî; the child who follows one of
these is called Kesâ, if a boy. No special name is given a girl born
immediately after a child with a caul."  
*Dahomey, I, 264*.

<span id="xref_5">5</span>. CHARMS, MADE OF ANIMALS, INSECTS

<span id="xref_5a">5a</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "Thus from
the earth, from trees and shrubs, from rocks, and from the bodies of
animals and humans the Dahomean obtains materials for his *gbo^*, while
from the *Azizą̆·* and other spirits of the forest, from Lεgbá, the Fá
Group, Dą, and the Great Gods, he obtained knowledge of how to endow
them with effective power."  
*Dahomey*, II, *287*.

<span id="xref_5b">5b</span> *Leonard says of West Africa*: "These are
procured from or made with the spines of certain animals, porcupines
more especially, compounded with potash, iron filings, and other
inorganic

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

matters, which are reduced to a powder. In this form they are supposed
to be communicated invisibly with such celerity and exactness against a
person, that blood poisoning supervenes."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 500*.

<span id="xref_5c">5c</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of the
Paramaribo Negro*: *Fiofio*, as envisaged in this belief, is the name of
an insect and also of a spirit which, taking the shape of this insect,
enters human bodies, causing illness and sometimes death. It comes as a
result of family quarrelling which does not end in reconciliation.
Strictly speaking, it is the extending of gestures of friendship or
intimacy at a later date, when the bitterness of the quarrel has either
passed or is masked, which brings on the illness. Such gestures of
intimacy or friendship include accepting food that is offered, or a
caress, or borrowing some kind of wearing apparel, or asking and
receiving any other favor, and the resulting illness comes to either one
or both of the persons who had participated in the quarrel."  
*Suriname Folk-Lore, p. 53*.

<span id="xref_6">6</span>. CHARMS, COUNTER

<span id="xref_6a">6a</span> *Farrow says of the Yoruba*: "The power of
'medicine' (*ogun*) exercised through a certain channel may be
neutralised or overcome by a superior power of ogun through another
channel. Van Gennep tells us that in Madagascar *fady* (the local name
for 'taboo') may be broken by one who has a higher power known as
*hasina*. So in Yoruba, a stronger 'medicine' is employed to overcome,
or counteract, an evil one, or a curse incurred through a broken *ewo*
('taboo'). This is the explanation of the use of 'charms,' whether
material (as amulets), vocal, or actionary. It is the invocation of a
higher power, or a fuller measure of the same power."  
*Faith, Fancies and Fetich, p. 121*.

<span id="xref_6b">6b</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "Súkpíkpa^,
*brings danger to another*. a. This *gbo^* is essentially a 'counter'
against sorcery. Actually, it demonstrates the principle which will be
developed at greater length in the succeeding pages, that the line
between good magic and bad magic is difficult to determine, since evil
can be done by a charm otherwise good, if it is directed toward an evil
end, and good by an evil charm, if properly handled. This *gbo^* is
called *agbá̧ngba* 'outside'--and consists of a piece of wood first split
in two, and then, after the ingredients are placed between the pieces,
tied together with cord and fastened by passing the end through, and
tying but not knotting it. One end is colored green. If a man who is
strong in magic power is angry with the owner,

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

and it is deemed likely that an attempt may be made to kill him with
magic, the owner takes this charm, inserts it in the ground near his
house, puts a stone on top of it and the evil magic is thereby not only
prevented from becoming effective, but any evil attempted will rebound
on him who has sent it."  
*Dahomey*, II, *269*.

<span id="xref_6c">6c</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
Dahomey*: "No matter how strong the magic, somewhere there is stronger
magic which not only can overcome it, but may, in certain cases, turn
back its effect on the person who invoked the original magic. This is
true not only of evil charms, but of protective ones as well. Thus, we
have in lengthy detail, information concerning a charm which a man
buries in his field to protect it. Against this there is an evil
'counter' which will not only allow its user to steal from the field,
but brings evil on the rightful owner. Against this bad magic there is,
in turn, an elaborate 'counter-counter,' which brings the thief to
book."  
*An Outline of Dahomean Religious Belief, p. 65*.

<span id="xref_7">7</span>. CHARMS, FOOT-TRACK

<span id="xref_7a">7a</span> *Puckett says of the Gold Coast*: "On the
Gold Coast it is believed that a man may be harmed by a 'medicine' made
from the dust picked up from his foot-tracks . . ."  
*Folk Beliefs of the Southern Negro, p. 220*.

<span id="xref_8">8</span>. CHARMS, GENERAL

<span id="xref_8a">8a</span> *Brown says of the Bantu tribes*: "As the
Bechuana believe that no misfortune befalls one naturally, but is always
the effect of malevolence on the part of the living or the dead, so they
also strongly believe that good fortune can only be maintained by means
of charms."  
*Among the Bantu Nomads, p. 137*.

<span id="xref_8b">8b</span> *Ellis says of the Ewe of West Africa*:
"Magic powders are very numerous. One kind, when blown against a door or
window, causes it to fly open, no matter how securely it may be
fastened; another, when thrown upon the footprints of an enemy, makes
him mad; a third, used in the same way, neutralizes the evil effects of
the second; and a fourth destroys the sight of all who look upon it.

"Magic unguents (iro) are not uncommon. They and the powders are
obtained from the priests, and must be rubbed on the body of

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

the person who is to be influenced by them. Some are believed to compel
a man to lend money, but their more common property is to constrain the
unwilling fair to listen favourably to the amorous proposal."  
*The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 94*.

<span id="xref_8c">8c</span> *Herskovits says*: "In Dahomey magic charms
are sold by professional workers of magic."  
*Life in a Haitian Valley, p. 31*.

<span id="xref_8d">8d</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "Magic charms
form another type of personal property. As has been noted, these charms,
which include herbs and other medicines, are held by tradition to have
been revealed chiefly to hunters in the bush. When a hunter had learned
how to make a given charm, or had been taught how to use a certain leaf
to cure some disease, this knowledge was then his property and had
salable value. When he was sought out for a charm to achieve a specific
purpose--to protect a man on a journey, or to make of him a successful
trader, or to insure the death of an enemy--if the hunter detailed the
contents of the charm, how to put the ingredients together, the
situation in which it would become effective and any formulae necessary
to set it in operation, this knowledge then became the property of the
purchaser as well as the vender. . . . To the professional dealers in
charms, then, these comprise a stock in trade that is their property and
potential wealth; for others, while the charms they own are property,
they do not represent a source of income."  
*Dahomey*, I, *81-82*.

<span id="xref_8e">8e</span> *Kingsley says of West Africa*: "Charms are
made for every occupation and desire in life-loving, hating, buying,
selling, fishing, planting, travelling, hunting, etc."  
*Travels in West Africa, p. 448*.

<span id="xref_8f">8f</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of the
Suriname Negro*: "That is, people are spoken of as 'buying luck' or
'wearing luck,' and comments are heard about the importance of carrying
one's 'luck' when walking alone at night, when going on a journey, when
wooing a woman, or seeking work, or combating the effect of black
magic."  
*Suriname Folk-Lore, p. 99*.

<span id="xref_8g">8g</span> *Nassau says of the Gabun territory*: "For
every human passion or desire of every part of our nature, for our
thousand necessities or wishes, a fetich can be made, its operations
being directed to the attainment of one specified wish, and limited in
power only

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

by the possible existence of some more powerful antagonizing spirits."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 85*.

<span id="xref_8h">8h</span> *Talbot says of the Ibibio tribes*: "Ibokk
are, for the most part, made for defensive purposes, for protection
against ill-wishers or evil messengers, but are sometimes procured from
'doctors' to harm an enemy."  
*Life in Southern Nigeria, p. 21*.

<span id="xref_8i">8i</span> "There is what may be termed a 'white art'
as well as a 'black art,' and the great majority of fetiches and charms
are intended to protect from evil, and not to attack innocent folk."  
*The Geographical Journal*, XXXI, *607*.

<span id="xref_9">9</span>. CHARMS, GRAVEYARD DIRT

<span id="xref_9a">9a</span> *Pearce says of West Africa*: "Juju bags
containing graveyard dirt and other material which had had a spell put
upon it by juju are effective for either good or evil purposes. A bag of
this sort worn around the neck, as a Catholic wears a scapula, serves as
a protection from the spells of enemies. However, if a man wishes to
work evil on his enemy, he may purchase a juju bag containing evil
powder, and through it cast a spell on his enemy."  
(Interview)

<span id="xref_10">10</span>. CHARMS, HAIR AND NAILS

<span id="xref_10a">10a</span> *Ellis says of the Ewe*: "Hence it is
usual for pieces of hair and nails to be carefully buried or burned, in
order that they may not fall into the hands of sorcerers; and whenever a
king or chief expectorates, the saliva is carefully gathered up and
hidden or buried."  
*The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 99*.

<span id="xref_10b">10b</span> *Meek says of the Jukun*: "Sorcerers also
capture and injure or kill souls in a variety of ways, notably by acting
on the hair, nail-parings or excreta of a person, the soul substance
being regarded as immanent in these. If a person wishes to injure
another he has merely to obtain a piece of his enemy's nails and hand
them to a sorcerer, who, if he knows his work, will speedily cause the
death of the former owner of the nail-parings. For this reason a Jukun
always hides or buries his hair and nail cuttings. Some Jukun burn
these, but others would refrain from doing this on the ground that the
burning would cause a scorching of his soul."  
*A Sudanese Kingdom, p. 298*.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

<span id="xref_10c">10c</span> *Milligan says of the Mpongwe*: "The
parings of fingernails, the hair of the victim and such things are
powerful ingredients in these 'medicines.' An Mpongwe, after having his
hair cut, gathers up every hair most carefully and burns it lest an
enemy should secure it and use it to his injury. When sickness continues
for a length of time they usually conclude that some offended relation
has caused an evil spirit to abide in the town."  
*The Fetish Folk of West Africa, p. 39*.

<span id="xref_10d">10d</span> *Nassau says of the Bantu*: "So fearful
are natives of power being thus obtained over them, that they have their
hair cut only by a friend; and even then they carefully burn it or cast
it into a river."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 83*.

<span id="xref_10e">10e</span> *Nassau says of the Benga, the Mpongwe,
and the Fang*: "If it be desired to obtain power over some one else, the
oganga must be given by the applicant, to be mixed in the sacred
compound, either crumbs from the food, or clippings of finger nails or
hair, or (most powerful!) even a drop of blood of the person over whom
influence is sought. These represent the life or body of that person."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 83*.

<span id="xref_10f">10f</span> *Nassau says of the Banita region*:
"Sitting one day by a village boat-landing in the Banita region, about
1866, while my crew prepared for our journey, I was idly plucking at my
beard, and carelessly flung away a few hairs. Presently I observed that
some children gathered them up. Asking my Christian assistant what that
meant, he told me: 'They will have a fetich made with those hairs; when
next you visit this village, they will ask you for some favor, and you
will grant it, by the power they will thus have over you."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 83*.

<span id="xref_10g">10g</span> *Nassau says of the West Coast natives*:
"Lately a fellow missionary told me that in a conversation with certain
natives, professed Christians, they admitted their fear lest their
nail-clippings should be used against them by an enemy, and candidly
acknowledged that when they pared their nails they threw the pieces on
the thatch of the low roof of their house."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 104*.

<span id="xref_10h">10h</span> *Talbot says of the Ibibio tribes*: ". .
. witches and wizards try to obtain hair, nail-clippings, or a piece of
cloth long worn by the person whom they desire to injure."  
*Life in Southern Nigeria, p. 65*.

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

<span id="xref_10i">10i</span> "*Ekanem, witness for prosecutor, stated
on oath*: 'I remember Ofuo Afaha Eke telling me that Tomkpata had come
to his mother in a dream and cut off some of her hair. So next day she
went to him and said that he must restore her soul.' Ofuo Afaba Eke,
sworn, stated: 'Tomkpata is my elder brother, I complained to him that
my mother had dreamed a dream in which she saw him cut off her hair with
scissors. From this we knew that he was trying to snare her soul.'"  
*Life in Southern Nigeria, p. 122*.

<span id="xref_11">11</span>. CHARMS AND BAD LUCK SIGNS, HOUSE AND
PROPERTY

<span id="xref_11a">11a</span> *Burton says of Dahome*: "Every house has
its 'fetish' hanging up, and every man has a 'fetish' charm about his
person. There is a devil fetish for driving away evil spirits, and
another for bringing good luck."  
*A Mission to Gelele, King of Dahome*, II, *361*.

<span id="xref_11b">11b</span> *Ellis says of the Yoruba*: "An *onde*
for the protection of the person is worn on the body, being tied round
the wrist, neck, or ankle, or placed in the hair. Others, for the
protection of property, are fastened to houses, or tied to sticks and
stumps of trees in cultivated plots of ground. In consequence of their
being tied on to the person or object they protect, the word *edi*,
which really means the act of tying or binding, has now the meaning of
amulet or charm, just as in Ew̌e the word *vo͂̌-sesa* (amulet) is derived
from *vo͂̌* and *sa*, to tie or bind."  
*The Yoruba-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 118*.

<span id="xref_11c">11c</span> *Farrow says of the Yoruba*: "Charms and
amulets of various kinds are greatly used by the Yorubas. The Bale, or
head-chief, of Ogbomosho, being of a particularly nervous and
superstitious nature, had not only a number of tutelary gods guarding
the threshold of his dwelling, but had laid in the ground, from one side
of his compound to the other, chains and other charms to render each
person who approached him powerless to do any evil. Charms for the
protection of property are fastened to the houses, etc. They may consist
of sticks, stumps of trees, etc."  
*Faith, Fancies and Fetich, p. 123*.

<span id="xref_11d">11d</span> *Beckwith says*: "Other acts are to be
avoided lest they pay the penalty of death to the immediate family.
Never add to a house or cut down an old tree."  
*Black Roadways, p. 87*.

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

<span id="xref_12">12</span>. CHARMS, MEDICINAL

<span id="xref_12a">12a</span> *Delafosse says of the African in
general*: "Belief . . . in the power of amulets and talismans is
legendary among the Negroes. There is not one of them, whatever his
religion, who does not wear on his body several 'gris-gris,' of which
one is to preserve him from such and such a malady, a second from the
evil eye."  
*Negroes of Africa, pp. 236-37*.

<span id="xref_12b">12b</span> *Ellis says of the Yoruba*: "Another word
sometimes used to express amulet is *ogun*, which, however, more
properly means medicinal preparation, poison, or magical drug."  
*The Yoruba-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 118*.

<span id="xref_12c">12c</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Bush Negro of Dutch Guiana*: "We had not been long in her hut before
we noticed the iron arm-band she wore. It was, we knew, a '*tapu*'--a
magical preventive which, in this instance, warned its wearer of danger,
and kept her from harm in a combat."  
*Rebel Destiny, p. 288*.

<span id="xref_12d">12d</span> "Obia, then, is the spirit; obia is the
preventive and curing agent; obias are the charms that are worn by
people to help them."  
*Rebel Destiny, p. 321*.

<span id="xref_13">13</span>. CHICKEN AND COCK SUPERSTITIONS

<span id="xref_13a">13a</span> *Herskovits says*: "Frizzled chickens are
prized both in Africa and in the New World for their ability to find and
scratch up evil magic buried against the owner."  
From correspondence dated October 10, 1938.

<span id="xref_13b">13b</span> *Rattray says of Ashanti*: "A cock
crowing at midnight or long before dawn is immediately killed, as it is
considered unlucky."  
*Ashanti Proverbs, p. 80*.

<span id="xref_14">14</span>. CICATRIZATION

<span id="xref_14a">14a</span> Herskovits says of Dahomey: "Another form
which these positive injunctions take has to do with facial cuts, which
vary from sib to sib. Thus the Adjalénû make no cuts at all. The Hwedánu
who live in Whydah, make two cuts on each cheek. The Agblomenu, who are
considered a group of autochthonous inhabitants of the plateau of
Abomey, make three cuts on each side of the face, one on

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

the temple called *àdjàkàsí* (tail of a rat), and two on the cheek, both
in front of the ear. The Gedevi^, another aboriginal group near Abomey,
distinguish themselves by means of three cuts on each temple. At the
present time all Dahomeans are supposed to have three cuts on the
temple, though the Agblomenu have suppressed the two of these three and
only cut the 'rat's tail.'"  
*Dahomey*, I, *162*.

<span id="xref_14b">14b</span> "Twelve sets of cuts constitute a
complete cicatrization."  
*Dahomey*, I, *292*.

<span id="xref_14c">14c</span> "The last design is placed between the
breasts, and often takes the form of a series of links or of straight
lines radiating from a central point."  
*Dahomey*, I, *295*.

<span id="xref_14d">14d</span> *Livingstone says of South Africa*: "They
mark themselves by a line of little raised cicatrices, each of which is
a quarter of an inch long; they extend from the tip of the nose to the
root of the hair on the forehead."  
*Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa, p. 576*.

<span id="xref_15">15</span>. CONJURE, ILLNESS AND DEATH

<span id="xref_15a">15a</span> *Ellis says of the Yoruba*: "They
consequently attribute sickness and death, other than death resulting
from injury or violence, to persons who have for bad purposes enlisted
the services of evil spirits, that is to say, to wizards and witches."  
*The Yoruba-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 117*.

<span id="xref_15b">15b</span> *Meek says of the Jukun*: "Sudden deaths,
especially of young people, are usually regarded as the work of
sorcerers (*ba-shiko* or *ba-shibu*). If the deceased had been noted for
his disrespect to his seniors his death would be ascribed to offended
ancestors, and he would go to his grave with 'bloodshot eyes'; but
otherwise it is thought that one who had died suddenly had met his death
by the foul means of witchcraft and would take vengeance in his own
time."  
*A Sudanese Kingdom, pp. 223-24*.

<span id="xref_15c">15c</span>*Milligan says of a Mpongwe tribe*:
"Sickness and death, they believe, may be caused by fetish medicine,
which need not be administered to the victim, but is usually laid beside
the path where he is about to pass."  
*The Fetish Folk of West Africa, p. 39*.

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

<span id="xref_15d">15d</span> *Nassau says of West Africa*: "'According
to native ideas, all over Africa, such a thing as death from natural
causes does not exist. Whatever ill befalls a man or a family, it is
always the result of witchcraft, and in every case the witch-doctors are
consulted to find out who has been guilty of it.'"  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 117*.

<span id="xref_15e">15e</span> *Talbot says of the Ibibio tribes*: "When
a man falls sick because his soul has gone forth and is being detained
by an enemy, or when he believes that such an one is trying to entice it
from out his body, he, in turn, goes to a Juju man known to have the
power of seeing clearly."  
*Life in Southern Nigeria, p. 121*.

<span id="xref_15f">15f</span> *Talbot says of the Yoruba*: "The Yoruba,
like all other tribes here, considered that a large number of deaths was
due to witchcraft or ill-will on the part of some enemy, and when many
people died of famine or sickness, a general meeting was held and resort
had to divination to find out the guilty persons, who were at once
killed or offered in sacrifice to one of the Orisha."

<span id="xref_17a">17a</span> *Cuney-Hare says of the Bushman*: "They
possess a variety of dances pertaining to social customs, each of which
has its appropriate chant. One dance imitates the actions of different
animals."  
*Negro Musicians and Their Music, pp. 10-12*.

<span id="xref_17b">17b</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Bush Negro of Dutch Guiana*: "Those who danced for the buzzard had
no machetes, but went about in a circle, moving with bodies bent forward
from their waists and with arms thrown back in imitation of the bird
from which their spirit took its name."  
*Rebel Destiny, p. 330*.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

<span id="xref_17d">17d</span> "The men were dancing to the great
Kromanti spirits; the tiger-jaguar-and the buzzard, two of the three
forms which the dreaded Kromanti *obia* can take. 'Obia! Huh! Huh!' one
ejaculated, imitating the tiger, as his dancing became wilder and

*Rebel Destiny, p. 17*.

<span id="xref_18">18</span>. DANCES, FUNERALS

<span id="xref_18a">18a</span> Moore says of a Mandingo funeral: "They
begin with Crying, and at Night they go to Singing and Dancing, and
continue so doing till the Time they break up and depart."  
*Travels Into the Inland Parts of Africa, p. 130*.

<span id="xref_18b">18b</span> *Rattray says of Ashanti*: "People from a
far place who were related to the deceased and people from towns near
by, also form their own companies. They dance the war-dances in the
morning, and at 'the mouth' of evening, when the sun is slanting, they
circle the grave. It is now that the corpse is taken to the grave."  
*The Tribes of the Ashanti Hinterland, p. 194*.

<span id="xref_19">19</span>. DANCES, RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE

<span id="xref_19a">19a</span> *Rattray says of Ashanti*: "Dancing in
Africa invariably has a religious significance."  
*Religion and Art in Ashanti, p. 184*.

<span id="xref_19b">19b</span> *Talbot says of the Sudanese tribes*:
"Among Nigerians, however, it would appear that the god was not evolved
out of the dance, but was there first and the dance was developed as a
method of worship, of attaining union with him, and of exerting an
influence with his help on the fertility of men and of crops."  
*The Peoples of Southern Nigeria*, III, *803*.

<span id="xref_20">20</span>. DAY NAMES

<span id="xref_20a">20a</span> *Beckwith says of Jamaica*: "According to
an old custom recorded from the African Gold Coast, every child receives
at birth a name depending on the day of the week on which it is born.

<span id="xref_20b">20b</span> *Ellis says of the Tshi-Speaking native*:
"Every child, from the moment of birth, is given a name which is derived
from the day of the week on which it is born."  
*The Tshi-Speaking Peoples of West Africa, p. 219*.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

<span id="xref_20c">20c</span> *Rattray says of Ashanti*: "As soon as it
is born, all the old women shout, 'Hail so-and-so,' at once naming the
infant after that particular day of the week upon which it is born. This
-name, which is sometimes called 'God's name,' will ever after be the
child's natal day name. To this, as will be noted presently, will later
be added a patronymic, and possibly later on in life one or more 'strong
names' (*mmerane*)."  
*Religion and Art in Ashanti, pp. 56-57*.

<span id="xref_21">21</span>. DAYS, LUCKY AND UNLUCKY

<span id="xref_a">a</span> *Ellis says of the Tshi-Speaking native*:
"There are national and tribal lucky and unlucky days, and individuals
also have days which they consider lucky and unlucky for themselves.
Kwoffi Karikari considered Thursday an unlucky day, and would never
commence any undertaking on a Thursday. Kidjo Monday, which falls early
in February, is considered by the Ashantis the luckiest day of the year.
Their most unlucky day is the anniversary of the Saturday on which Osai
Tutu was slain in an ambush near Acromanti in 1731."  
*The Tshi-Speaking Peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa, p. 220*.

<span id="xref_22">22</span>. DIVINERS, DIVINING, SEED CASTING, ETC.

<span id="xref_22a">22a</span> *Delafosse says*: "Numerous
fortune-tellers predict the future and reveal hidden things, by means of
processes, many of which strangely resemble those which our own
clairvoyants employ."  
*Negroes of Africa, p. 237*.

<span id="xref_22b">22b</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "A third
type, called *agɔ̌kwíka*, employed two magically treated *ago^* seeds
tied to the ends of a cord long enough to go about the neck of the
accused, and the seeds were buried lightly in the ground. Such was the
spiritual power in these seeds, that if the accused was guilty of the
crime, he could not remove them from the ground; if he succeeded in
rising, he was declared innocent."  
*Dahomey*, II, *18*.

<span id="xref_22c">22c</span> "In this myth, not only is the
explanation found of how the prevalent system of divination came to man,
but the principal outlines of the practices which characterize the Fá
cult are to be discerned--that is, the sixteen palm--kernels employed in
throwing the

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

lots, the sixteen combinations in which they may fall, and which
foretell the future.  
*Dahomey*, II, *206*.

<span id="xref_22d">22d</span> "The details of this system by means of
which the future is foretold may now be considered. In essence, Fá is
based on the interpretation, by reference to appropriate myths, of the
permutations and combinations obtained by the diviner when he
manipulates the sixteen palm-kernels he employs for this purpose. Before
him as he works lies a rectangular wooden tray, on which powdered white
clay or meal has been sprinkled. In one hand he holds his sixteen
palm-kernels, and with great rapidity brings the hand which holds them
into the palm of the other one, leaving either one or two seeds for an
instant before they are once more picked up and the process is repeated.
As soon as he has glimpsed the one or two kernels in his left hand, the
right, with the palm-kernels, closes down upon it and the two clasp the
seeds. The index and second fingers of the right hand are, however, left
free and with these he describes marks in the white powder on the board
in front of him. Moving his fingers away from him, he makes a double
line for each single kernel, a single line if two seeds are left. The
process is repeated eight times for a complete reading."  
*Dahomey*, II, *209-10*.

<span id="xref_22e">22e</span> *Rattray says of the Ashanti*: "The
soothsayer, oracle man, or diviner, as will be seen presently, takes a
leading part in the everyday life of these people. He is consulted on
almost every conceivable occasion. Hardly anything can be done until he
has been asked. He is really a medium, a 'go-between' in the land of the
living and the world of spirit ancestors. The root of the word used to
describe, this person is generally the same as that found in the word
for shrine. The people consult him at some shrine, the spirit in which
guides him and directs his answers."  
*The Tribes of the Ashanti Hinterland*, I, *44*.

<span id="xref_23">23</span>. DRUMS

<span id="xref_23a">23a</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Paramaribo Negro*: "Drums are the most important instruments in both
Town and flush, and the drummers, in these as in all Negro cultures,
achieve a virtuosity of performance and an intricacy of rhythm that come
of long practice. It was impossible to obtain satisfactory recordings of
drumming which would reveal the complexity of these rhythm

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

patterns, chiefly because, lacking electrical recording apparatus, the
inner rhythms which in combination give a steady beat are lost, and only
the points where the notes of the several instruments coincide can be
discerned.

"The drums have more than a musical significance in this culture.
Tradition assigns to them the threefold power of summoning the gods and
the spirits of the ancestors to appear, of articulating the messages of
these supernatural beings when they arrive, and of sending them back to
their habitats at the end of each ceremony. Both in Town and in the
Bush, the dancers who are the worshippers,--one of the most important
expressions of worship is dancing--face the drums and dance toward them,
in recognition of the voice of the god within the instruments."  
*Suriname Folk-Lore, pp. 520-21*.

<span id="xref_23b">23b</span> *Milligan says of the West African*: "The
fact is, however, that the only one of his musical instruments which the
African regards with profound respect is his dearly beloved tom-tom-the
drum to which he dances."  
*The Fetish Folk of West Africa, p. 77*.

<span id="xref_24">24</span>. DRUMS, FUNERAL

<span id="xref_24a">24a</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "Outside
the house the funerary zç̇li, a pottery drum, is played day and night.
The drummers are the members of the *dókpwe^* of the quarter where the
dead man lived, or if he was a villager, of his village, and it is the
head of this *dókpwe^* who is the commanding *dókpwégâ* at the
funeral."  
*Dahomey*, I, *355*.

<span id="xref_24b">24b</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Bush Negro of Dutch Guiana*: "That night whenever we stirred in our
sleep we strained for the sound of the drums, but the wind blew from the
east, and though Gankwe, where the dead man lay in state, was but a
ten-minute run down the rapids, we could hear nothing. In the morning,
however, we heard them plainly, heard the invocations drummed by the
grave diggers on their way to the burial ground deep in the bush on the
opposite bank."  
*Rebel Destiny, p. 3*.

<span id="xref_24c">24c</span> *Livingstone says of South Africa*:
"Drums were beating over the body of a man who had died the preceding
day, and some women were making a clamorous wail at the door of his hut,
and

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

addressing the deceased as if alive. The drums continued beating the
whole night, with as much regularity as a steam-engine thumps, on board
ship."  
*Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa, p. 467*.

<span id="xref_25">25</span>. DRUMS, MANUFACTURE OF

<span id="xref_25a">25a</span> *DuPuis says of Ansah*: "The large drums
were carried on the heads of men, and beaten in that posture; but the
small ones were slung as kettle drums. These added to calabashes and
gourds filled with shot or small stones, concave bits of iron, and
striking sticks, will give an idea of the national taste in harmonic
matters."  
*Journal of a Residence in Ashantee, p. 43*.

<span id="xref_25b">25b</span> *Ellis says of the Gold Coast*: "Drums
are made of the hollowed sections of trunks of trees, with a goat's or
sheep's skin stretched over one end. They are from one foot to four feet
high, and vary in diameter from about six to fourteen inches. Two or
three drums are usually used together, each drum producing a different
note, and they are played either with the fingers or with two sticks.
The lookers-on generally beat time by clapping the hands."  
*The Tshi-Speaking Peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa, p. 326*.

<span id="xref_25c">25c</span> *Herskovits says of Haiti*: "Drums, iron,
and rattles are indispensable for a *vodun* dance. The drums, of the
characteristic hollow-log African type, tuned with pegs inserted in the
sides and reinforced with twine wound about the stretched heads of
cow-hide or goat-skin, are played in batteries of three, the largest
being called *manman*, the middle the *seconde*, and the smallest the
*bula*."  
*Life in a Haitian Valley, pp. 181-82*.

<span id="xref_25d">25d</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "Generally
the drums are of the usual African type, made of a hollowed-out log with
a more or less crudely carved foot, its head of animal skin being
attached to pegs inserted into the body of the drum, just below its
upper end. The drum-head is tightened by driving these pegs into the
drum until the required note is sounded, since by this method the skin
is stretched to produce the desired tone. Ordinarily the attachment of
the head to the pegs is by means of strips of the skin itself; in some
forms, however, a cord attachment is used. A small barrel drum, the only
one of its kind observed, about eighteen inches high

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

and twelve inches in diameter, and which does not have a foot, is used
in the Sagbatá rites. The other more conventional drums range from two
feet in size to a length of five feet and more."  
*Dahomey*, II, *318*.

<span id="xref_25e">25e</span> *Moore says of the Mandingo*: with him
came two or three Women, and the same Number of Mundingo Drums, which
are about a Yard long, and a Foot, or twenty Inches diameter at the Top,
but less at the Bottom, made out of a solid Piece of Wood, and covered,
only at the widest End, with the Skin of a Kid. They beat upon them with
only one Stick, and their left Hand, to which the Women will dance very
briskly."  
*Travels Into the Inland Parts of Africa, p. 64*.

<span id="xref_25f">25f</span> *Ward says of the Bakongo country*: "The
natives were drumming on a goat-skin stretched tightly across the mouth
of a hollowed-out log, and dancing round a fire lighted in their midst,
one man singing a refrain, while others took up the chorus; and the
mingled sound of the voices and the distant beating of other drums in
neighboring villages helped to keep me awake."  
*Five Years with the Congo Cannibals, p. 68*.

<span id="xref_25g">25g</span> *Beckwith says*: "The beating of the
gombay drum is a familiar accompaniment of death."  
*Black Roadways, p. 83*.

<span id="xref_26">26</span>. DRUM MESSAGES

<span id="xref_26a">26a</span> *Rattray says of Ashanti*: "A great deal
is heard in Africa about the wonderful way in which news can be passed
on over great distances in an incredibly short space of time. It has
been reported that the news of the fall of Khartum was known among the
natives of Sierra Leone the same day, and other equally wonderful
instances are quoted to show that the native has some extraordinary
rapid means of communicating important events. It must, however, be
remembered that most of the instances that one hears quoted are
incapable of verification, and would, moreover, probably be found to
have been much exaggerated. Having said this much, however, it must be
admitted that these natives have a means of intercommunication which
often inspires wonder and curiosity on the part of Europeans. One of
such means of communication is by drumming.

"This idea the European will readily grasp, and being familiar with
various means of *signalling*, will suppose that some such a method
might be adapted to drums; but among the Ashantis the drum is

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

not used as a means of signalling in the sense that we would infer, that
is by rapping out words by means of a prearranged code, but (to the
native mind) is used to sound or speak the actual words."  
*Ashanti Proverbs, pp. 133-34*.

<span id="xref_26b">26b</span> "I first became interested in this
difficult subject many years ago. At that time it was generally known
that the Ashanti, in common with certain other West Coast peoples, were
able to convey messages over great distances and in an incredibly short
space of time by means of drums, and it was thought that their system
was based upon some such method as that with which Europeans are
familiar in the Morse code."  
*Ashanti, p. 242*.

<span id="xref_27">27</span>. EARRINGS

<span id="xref_27a">27a</span> *Beckwith says of the Jamaica Negro*:
"Parkes says that men who 'deal in spirits' wear a red flannel shirt, or
a crosspiece of red under their ordinary clothes, and generally gold
earrings. Not all men who wear earrings are Obeah Men; fishermen, for
example, generally wear one earring. The gold is said to 'brighten their
eyes to see ghosts,' but also a gold earring is put on to improve the
natural sight."  
*Black Roadways, p. 108*.

<span id="xref_28">28</span>. EARTH THROWN IN GRAVE

<span id="xref_28a">28a</span> *Brown says of the Bantu Nomad* (*the
Bechuana*): "A pit is dug and into it the body is lowered in the sitting
position. The grave is then filled in, each person present slowly
pouring earth onto the body and around it with their hands until the
grave is full."  
*Among the Bantu Nomads, p. 67*.

<span id="xref_28b">28b</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: "Loose earth is
then thrown in on the body, together with the mat and cloth. Even very
young sons must throw in a little earth, as evidence that they had taken
a share in their father's burial rites. The last handfuls are thrown in
with the back turned to the grave, as a sign that they had finished with
the dead man."  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, pp. 307-08*.

<span id="xref_29">29</span>. ECHO OF SPEECH

<span id="xref_29a">29a</span> Herskovits says of Haiti: "With the
benediction, the *action de grâce* came to an end, and the solemn, tired
voice of the *prêt savanne* 

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

was heard intoning a hymn, which, in the usual fashion, was repeated by
the assembled group until, without interlude, without even a pause, the
interpolations of the chorus gradually changed, so that the rhythm
became African, and, with the transition, the *vodun* priest took over
the leadership. The *hungan* began by repeating several times the phrase
which throughout the entire ceremony was to punctuate all its climaxes,
*'Grâce* \[et\] mise’corde,' and the family murmured it in response."  
*Life in a Haitian Valley, p. 161*.

<span id="xref_30">30</span>. FAREWELL TO CORPSE (SPOKEN TO)

<span id="xref_30a">30a</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Bush Negro of Dutch Guiana*: "Now the ceremony was drawing to a
close, and the leave takings were to be said. . . . Distinctly the low
voice of Sedefo came to us as he addressed the corpse:

'*The hour has come when we must part from you. What the Earth has
decreed we cannot help. We have done for you what we could. We have
given you a funeral worthy of you. You must care for us, and you must
deliver us from all evil that may come upon us*.'"

sanctuary, and that any one sentenced to death who escaped there would
be safe."

<span id="xref_33">33</span>. FOLK TALES

<span id="xref_33a">33a</span> *Rattray says of Hausa folk tales*:
"Stories and traditions collected through the medium of an interpreter
are amusing, and might prove of interest in the nursery, though much
would have to be omitted or toned down, as savage folk-lore is often
coarse and vulgar according to our notions."

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

<span id="xref_34">34</span>. FOREST-DWELLING FORCES

<span id="xref_34a">34a</span> *Farrow says of the Yoruba*: "Certain
trees are particularly sacred. The silk-cotton tree (Yoruba *peregun*)
is highly venerated throughout West Africa 'from the Senegal to the
Niger,' probably because of its majestic appearance, for it is of little
utility, the timber being soft, and its cotton possessing neither
strength nor durability. This tree often grows to a stupendous height,
approximating 300 feet, far out-topping all other trees of the
forest."  
*Faith, Fancies and Fetich, p. 16*.

<span id="xref_34b">34b</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "The
psychological liaison between the gods and magic, however, is revealed
in the character of the semi-divine spirits who are believed to people
the forest--Mínonâ, Hoho, the *abiku^* and the *azizą*."  
*Dahomey*, II, *260*.

<span id="xref_34c">34c</span> *Kingsley says of the Bantu tribes*: "In
some part of the long single street of most villages there is built a
low hut in which charms are hung, and by which grows a consecrated
plant, a lily, a euphorbia, or a fig."  
*Travels in West Africa, p. 452*.

<span id="xref_34d">34d</span> *Leonard says of Southern Nigeria*:
"Groves and woods, and those portions of the bush close to every town
which are reserved as burial-grounds, are considered sacred and worship
is paid to either the spirits or the deities who inhabit or preside over
them."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 298*.

<span id="xref_35">35</span>. FOWL, SACRIFICE OF

<span id="xref_35a">35a</span> *Ellis says of the Yoruba*: "After this
invitation to be gone, the fowl, called *adire-iranna*, is sacrificed,
which, besides securing a right-of-way for the soul, is supposed also to
guide it. The feathers of the fowl are scattered around the house, and
the bird itself carried out to a bush-road, where it is cooked and
eaten."  
*The Yoruba-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 160*.

<span id="xref_35b">35b</span> *Leyden says of the Mandingo territory*:
"The journey was marked by nothing remarkable, except the sacrifice of a
white chicken, which was offered by Johnson, the interpreter, to the
spirits of the woods, described as a powerful race of white beings, with
long flowing hair."  
*Historical Account of Discoveries and Travels in Africa*, I, *339*.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

<span id="xref_35c">35c</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: "The next rite is
known as Ekuibuocha, a phrase which seems to mean 'Making the face (of
the dead man) white (i.e. radiant).' Women of the deceased's family
bring a cock fastened to a string of cowries and one of the women who is
considered especially lucky (e.g. whose children are all alive), or some
person previously indicated by the deceased, holds or hangs the cock
over the dead man's head. When the cock shakes its wings (a sign of
acceptance by the deceased), it is taken out and hung at the door of the
hut or on a branch of an *oterre* tree in the compound. After a while it
is taken down and its neck is drawn, the blood being allowed to drip on
to the ground at the threshold. The fowl is then cooked and eaten by the
female relatives. The intention in leaving the fowl hung up is,
apparently, to give the deceased time to see and receive the
offering."  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, pp. 303-04*.

<span id="xref_35d">35d</span> *Rattray says of Ashanti*: "The eldest
son supplies a sheep and a fowl which are killed in the yard of the
compound (*dundon*) and grain-food is prepared which is called *sanfana*
(in Dagomba, *sore segam*, literally 'food for the road'). The sextons
and others attending the funeral partake of this food, and a portion of
the grain-food and a leg of the fowl are also placed in a calabash which
is set down in the room where the corpse had been laid prior to
interment."  
*The Tribes of the Ashanti Hinterland*, II, *460-61*.

<span id="xref_36">36</span>. FUNERAL, PROPER OBSERVANCE

<span id="xref_36a">36a</span> *Ellis says of the Yoruba*: "It is
considered the greatest disgrace to a family not to be able to hold the
proper ceremonies at the death of one of their number, a notion which is
comprehensible when we remember how much the welfare of the soul of the
deceased is supposed to depend upon their performance. Hence families
not unfrequently reduce themselves almost to beggary in order to carry
them out, or pawn or sell their children to raise the money
necessary."  
*The Yoruba-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 161*.

<span id="xref_36b">36b</span> *Leonard says of the Ibo*: "All Ibo place
great faith in the due and proper observance of the funeral ceremony,
for they are of the opinion that it enables the soul to go to God and to
find its final destination, and that without this sacred rite the soul
is prevented by the other spirits from eating, or in any way associating
with

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

them, and in this manner, from entering into the Creator's presence. So
in this way it becomes an outcast and a wanderer on the face of the
earth, haunting houses and frequently burial grounds, or is forced
perhaps to return to this world in the form or body of some animal."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 142*.

<span id="xref_36c">36c</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: "The spirit of a
dead Ibo is considered to hover round his home, or wander aimlessly in
the. underworld, until the final funeral rites have been performed."  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, p. 314*.

<span id="xref_36d">36d</span> *Milligan says of the Mpongwe of Gaboon*:
"The spirit of the deceased knows all that is going on and is supposed
to be very sensitive in regard to the amount of mourning and the details
of the funeral."  
*The Fetish Folk of West Africa, p. 148*.

<span id="xref_37">37</span>. FUNERALS, WAKES--IMPORTANCE, SOCIAL
ACTIVITY

<span id="xref_37a">37a</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "A
death-watch is now provided to see to it that the body is not left
unattended. This watch is kept with rigid care, especially when the body
is in the hands of the members of the *dókpwe^* who actually carry out
the ritual of the funeral. This is because of the opportunity a corpse
affords anyone who is desirous of obtaining the means for working magic
by capturing the soul of the deceased, since a bit of the dead man's
cloth, or, better still, some of his hair or nail-parings might easily
be taken and used to this end. Furthermore, with such material, or with
a cloth placed inside the mouth of the corpse to absorb some of the
moisture remaining there, charms of great power and therefore great
value could be made."  
*Dahomey*, I, *353*.

<span id="xref_37b">37b</span> *Leonard says of the Ibo and other
tribes*: "Although the death of a man is in reality a great loss to his
household or even to the community, the occasion of his obsequies is
regarded as an event of great entertainment to the community at large.
It is looked upon as a circumstance in which the family honour is
concerned in a distinctly two fold sense, affecting its reputation in
this world as well as in the next. For the reception of the soul of the
deceased in spiritland and his final prestige are altogether dependent
on the grandeur and liberality of the human entertainment."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, pp. 157-58*.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

<span id="xref_37c">37c</span> *Talbot says of the Sudanese tribes*: "A
wake invariably takes place, the duration and grandeur of which depend
upon the wealth of the family. Animals--including cows if these can be
afforded--are slain in profusion, while palm wine and gin are provided
in plenty, and in old days, rum. Cannons and guns are fired off to give
notice to the ghosts that a 'big man' is coming, and plays are performed
by the clubs and societies of which the deceased was a member. In fact,
funerals provide the best opportunity for festivals, 'plays,' dances and
performances in general."  
*The Peoples of Southern Nigeria*, III, *473*.

<span id="xref_38">38</span>. HARVEST FESTIVALS

<span id="xref_38a">38a</span> *Ellis says of the Tshi-Speaking native*:
"Yam, or Harvest Festivals.--These appear to be festivals held for the
purpose of returning thanks to the gods for having protected the crop.
There are apparently two; one held in September, when the yam crop is
ripe, and another, called *Ojirrah*, in December, when it is planted. A
minor festival, called *Affi-neh-dzea-fi*, which is held in April,
appears, however, to be of the same nature. The September festival lasts
a fortnight, and is commenced by a loud beating of drums. It is called
by the Ashantis *Appatram*, and no new yam may be eaten by the people
till the close of the festival."  
*The Tshi-Speaking Peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa, p. 229*.

<span id="xref_38b">38b</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: "Public sacrifice
to Ala may be offered periodically at the beginning of the agricultural
season, before clearing new land, or after clearing old, before planting
yams, or at the end of the yam harvest.  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, p. 26*.

<span id="xref_38c">38c</span> *Rattray says of Ashanti*: "There appear
to be at least three great festivals which are held by the Talense in
connexion with the crops and harvest."  
*The Tribes of the Ashanti Hinterland*, II, *358-59*.

<span id="xref_38d">38d</span> *Talbot says of the Ibibio tribes*: "At
the time of new yam planting, people came from far and near to beg
protection and increase for their crops and herds. On such occasions the
brow of the chief priest is bound with a fillet of white cloth, which
may not be taken off till the time of sacrifice comes round again. He
marks all the people with white chalk, as a sign that they have attended
the festival and asked the blessing of the genius of the pool."  
*Life in Southern Nigeria, p. 38*.

<span id="xref_39">39</span>. HOE, MAGIC

<span id="xref_39a">39a</span> *Rattray repeats a Hausa folk tale*:
"When he struck one blow on the ground with the hoe, then he climbed on
the hoe and sat down, and the hoe started to hoe, and fairly flew until
it had done as much as the hoers. It passed them, and reached the
boundary of the furrow."  
*Hausa Folk-Lore Customs, Proverbs, Etc.*, I, *74-76*.

<span id="xref_39b">39b</span> *Rattray tells an Ashanti folk tale*:
"The Hoe turned over a huge tract (of land). Then they stopped work and
went off, and the Porcupine took the hoe and hid it. And Kwaku, the
Spider, saw (where he put it). He said, 'This hoe that I have seen,
to-morrow very, very early I shall come and take it to do my work.'
Truly, very, very, very early, the Spider went and got it; he took to
his farm. Now, the Spider did not know how to make it stop, and he
raised his song:

'Gyensaworowa, Kotoko, saworowa.  
Gyensaworowa, Kotoko, saworowa,  
Gyensaworowa.'

And the Hoe, when it commenced hoeing, continued hoeing. And it hoed
until it came too far away. Now it reached the Sea-god's water. Thence
it came to the Land of White-men-far, and the White men took it, and
looked at it, and made others (like it). That is how many (European)
hoes came among the Ashanti. Formerly it was only Kotoko, the Porcupine,
who had one."  
*Akan-Ashanti Folk-Tales, p. 43*.

<span id="xref_40">40</span>. HOG, SACRIFICE OF

<span id="xref_40a">40a</span> *Beckwith says of Jamaica*: "When they
come to the Grave, which is generally made in some Savannah or Plain,
they lay down the Coffin, or whatever the Body happens to be wrapt up
in; and if he be one whose Circumstances could allow it (or if he be
generally liked, the Negroes contribute among themselves) they sacrifice
a Hog."  
*Dark Roadways, p. 79*.

<span id="xref_41">41</span>. IMAGES

<span id="xref_41a">41a</span> *Cruickshank says of the Gold Coast of
Africa*: "They also mould images from clay, and bake them. We have seen
curious groups of these in some parts of the country. Upon the death of
a

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

great man, they make representations of him, sitting in state, with his
wives and attendants seated around him."  
*Eighteen Years on the Gold Coast of Africa, p. 270*.

<span id="xref_41b">41b</span> *Ellis says of the Ewe*: "The head is
sometimes of wood, rising like a cone; the mouth extends from ear to
ear, and is garnished with the teeth of dogs, or with cowries to
represent teeth; the eyes are also represented by cowries. The arms of
the figure are invariably immensely long, while the legs are short and
the feet large."  
*The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 42*.

<span id="xref_41c">41c</span> *Guillaume and Munro say*: "He is
especially fond of giving a flashing regard to the eyes by inserting
beads, shells, stones or bits of metal."  
*Primitive Negro Sculpture, p. 29*.

<span id="xref_41d">41d</span> "Constructed like a building of solid
blocks, a typical negro, statue is itself a solid, a full, substantial
block, set with convincing, massive reality in its own space. Its effect
does not depend, as that of much other sculpture does, on elaborate
superficial decoration scratched upon a weak and vaguely realized mass.
There is rarely a sense of overdecoration or pretense, a feeling of
inner rottenness, as though, one could squash the whole fabric between
the hands, or scrape off its ornaments at a stroke. Surface decorations
there may be in profusion, but they are based upon a firm foundation and
integrated with it, to form an unyielding and immovable structure."  
*Primitive Negro Sculpture, p. 37*.

<span id="xref_41e">41e</span> *Kingsley says of the West African*: "He
cuts from a tree a moderately thick branch which he carves into a rude
resemblance of the human figure; usually these figures are simply
cylindrical pieces of wood, from ten to fourteen inches in length and
from three to four in diameter. Two or three inches from one end, which
may be called the top, the stick is notched so as to roughly resemble a
neck, and the top is then rounded to bear some rough distant resemblance
to a head."  
*Travels in West Africa, p. 510*.

<span id="xref_41f">41f</span> *Leonard says of the Ibo and other
tribes*: "It is quite impossible to understand the spiritual conception
and the god-idea of these natives unless we possess a knowledge of that
peculiarly personal system of society out of which it has evolved and
developed; and we recognise that the gods are but the shadows or

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

spirits, so called, of mortals. They are rude but perfect pictures of
the very worshippers in whose own human image they have been either
kneaded out of clay or carved out of wood."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 433*.

<span id="xref_41g">41g</span> "Not so the barbarian, however. With him
the Ju-Ju or emblem is no child's play, no mere outlet for a state of
activity which he is not particularly desirous of, not even a
safety-valve by which the accumulated steam of his pent-up emotions
might escape, but a matter of life and death, connecting, as it does,
one to the other, *i.e.* himself and household to the household in the
spirit. To natural man this grotesque image of clay or wood is no mere
toy, no senseless figure, that he moulds or carves for amusement during
his hours of leisure, simply to kill time with.

"So this bundle of repressed but irrepressible emotions appeals to his
household doll, as to an association--not in a merely abstract but in a
personal sense, as a lifelong association, to which, connected and
related as he is, from a twofold aspect, he is doubly bound. He appeals
to it, as to a familiar object, embodying, as it does, his familiar and
guardian spirit, not because he merely thinks or hopes this to be so,
but because in all sincerity he feels and believes it to he the case.
More than this, because he believes it to be the spirit of his father or
grandfather, who, in accordance with the divine instructions, occupies
the position of communicator and mediator between the human and
spiritual households."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 384-85*.

<span id="xref_41h">41h</span> "Small figures and images, such as are
mentioned above, purporting and believed by the natives to contain the
spirits of the defunct, and occupying exactly the same status as the
Aryan 'Pitris' or 'Fathers' and the Roman Lares and Penates, are also
made and venerated by all the Delta tribes. Food and liquid offerings
are regularly placed on graves or at the monuments erected, or the
symbols that have just been referred to, for the use of the departed
spirits."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 183*.

<span id="xref_41i">41i</span> *Rattray says of Ashanti*: "The priestly
class and the *sumankwafo*, the doctors in *suman*, demanded for their
professional purposes figures in human or animal forms; this resulted in
the carving of *Sasabonsam*, *mmoatia* and, finally, human figures; in
all of these the genius of the people found an outlet for latent
artistic talent."  
*Religion and Art in Ashanti, p. 269*.

<span id="xref_42">42</span>. MEMORIAL (SECOND FUNERAL)

<span id="xref_42a">42a</span> *Farrow says of the Yoruba*: "In June of
each year the Annual Egun festival is held, for seven days. It is the
Yoruba 'All Souls' festival, when mourning is repeated for all those who
have died during the last few years. Egungun is specially powerful in
Ibadau, even as Oro is in Abeokuta."  
*Faith, Fancies and Fetich, pp. 79-80*.

<span id="xref_42b">42b</span> *Leonard says of the Ibo and other
tribes*: "The Lamentation or Second Burial.--This is conducted on much
the same lines as the first, except that a greater entertainment is
provided and the expenses incurred are heavier.

"In a spiritual sense, however, the rite is one of infinitely greater
importance, because it is a special memorial service held over the
deceased in order to release him from the thraldom of the region of the
dead in which all souls are confined, where they exist on leaves or
grass just like the brute beasts, and to usher him triumphantly, as
befits his birth, into the abode of his fathers in the world of spirits.

"For the universal belief on this point is that no human soul can attain
to the peaceful ancestral habitations without this rite of second
burial. Hence the great aversion shown by a community towards those who
fail to observe this holy sacrament."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, pp. 159-60*.

<span id="xref_42c">42c</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: "The Ekwa-Ozu
rites are commonly referred to in English as Me Second Burial,' though
there is no apparent reason for the use of this expression.

"The responsibility for performing the rites falls mainly on the
principal heir, who should endeavour to carry them out within a year of
the dead man's death. But the period may be extended, if the deceased's
family has been unable to find the necessary means, and cases have
occurred of the final funeral rites being postponed for as much as ten
or twenty years."  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, p. 314*.

<span id="xref_42d">42d</span> *Talbot says of the Ibibio tribes*: "This
first burial, generally called Mkpa Owo, is followed, from six months to
two years later, by the Ewouga or Usiak Ekkpo, the second burial, with
which the obsequies are completed and without which the deceased is
thought to be unable to take his proper position in the realm of the
dead."  
*Life in Southern Nigeria, p. 142*.

<span id="xref_43">43</span>. MORTARS

<span id="xref_43a">43a</span> *Monteiro says of Angola*: "These mortars
are made of soft wood, mostly of the cotton wood tree, which is easily
cut with a knife; for scooping out the interior of the mortars the
natives use a tool made by bending round about an inch of the point of
an ordinary knife, which they call a "locombo."  
*Angola and the River Congo, p. 167*.

<span id="xref_44">44</span>. OWL, HOOTING OF

<span id="xref_44a">44a</span> *Ellis says of the Vais*: "The Vais
consider the owl the king of all witches. They believe that some old
king transformed himself into the owl and became the king of witchcraft.
The owl is called húhu. Whenever the cry of this bird is heard they
tremble with fear. It is said when an owl sits upon a home at least one
of its inmates is sure to die."  
*Negro Culture in West Africa, p. 66*.

<span id="xref_44b">44b</span> *Nassau says of West Africa*: "Then,
concerning owls; see that your camp at night is not disturbed by the cry
of the Kulu (spirit of the departed), that warns you that one of you is
going to die."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, pp. 195-96*.

<span id="xref_45">45</span>. PALM CABBAGE, PALM WINE

<span id="xref_45a">45a</span> *Bridge says of the West Coast of
Africa*: "Palm wine is the sap of the tree; and its top furnishes a most
delicious dish, called palm-cabbage. The trunk supplies fire-wood and
timber for building fences. From the fibres of the wood is manufactured
a strong cordage, and a kind of native cloth; and the leaves, besides
being used for thatching houses, are converted into hats. If nature had
given the inhabitants of Africa nothing else, this one gift of the
palm-tree would have included food, drink, clothing, and habitation, and
the gratuitous boon of beauty, into the bargain."  
*Journal of an African Cruiser, p. 106*.

<span id="xref_45b">45b</span> *Burton says of Gelele*: "The palm, after
being felled, is allowed to lie for a couple of days, the cabbage is
removed for food, and in its place a pipe, generally a bit of
papaw-stalk, conducts the sap into the calabash below. At times, to make
the juice flow more freely, a lighted stick is thrust into the hole,
which is afterwards scraped clear of charred wood. This "toddy" is the
drink

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

of the maritime regions, where it is most impudently watered, and we
shall not taste it beyond the Agrime swamp."  
*A Mission to Gelele, King of Dahome*, I, *pp. 128-29*.

<span id="xref_46">46</span>. POSSESSION

<span id="xref_46a">46a</span> *Basden says of the Ibo*: "The more one
listens to native music, the more one is conscious of its vital power.
It touches the chords of man's inmost being, and stirs his primal
instincts. It demands the performer's whole attention and so sways the
individual as almost to divide asunder, for the time being, mind and
body. . . . Under its influence, and that of the accompanying dance, one
has seen men and women pass into a completely dazed condition, oblivious
and apparently unconscious of the world around them."  
*Among the Ibos of Nigeria, p. 192*.

<span id="xref_46b">46b</span> *Ellis says of the Gold Coast*: "The
drums strike up, and the priest commences his dance, leaping, bounding,
and turning and twisting round and round, until he works himself into a
real or simulated condition of frenzy, with foam dropping from the
mouth, and eyes wildly rolling."  
*The Tshi-Speaking Peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa, p. 125*.

<span id="xref_46c">46c</span> *Ellis says of the town of Forhudzi*: "A
god was beginning to take possession of him. . . . In the meantime the
trembling increased, and soon the priest was shuddering as if in an ague
fit. Every portion of his body seemed to shake; the head, arms, legs,
abdomen, and pectoral muscles, all quivering violently. He leaned
forward and appeared to be endeavoring to vomit, doubtless to give the
idea that his body was struggling to expel the god which was now
supposed to possess him. A little foam appeared on his lips, and from
time to time saliva fell on the ground. Next, with open mouth and
protruding tongue, and with eyes wildly rolling, he worked himself,
still seated and quivering violently, into the middle of the arena."  
*The Tshi-Speaking Peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa, p. 132*.

<span id="xref_46d">46d</span> *Herskovits says of Haiti*:
"Fundamentally, to be possessed by a loa means that an individual's
spirit is literally dispossessed by that of the god. Personalities
undergo radical change in accordance with the nature of the deity, while
even the sex of the one possessed is disregarded if it differs from that
of the god, so that, for example, a woman 'mounted' by Ogun is always
addressed as

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Papa Ogun. One
wears the colors of the god and the ornaments he likes, eating and
drinking those things he prefers, and otherwise manifesting his peculiar
characteristics--rolling on the earth, if possessed by Damballa or
chattering incessantly if by Gede."  
*Life in a Haitian Valley, p. 146*.

<span id="xref_46e">46e</span> *Leonard says of the Ibo and other
tribes*: "This possession by spirits, although not confined to any
particular tribe or tribes in the Delta, is said to be much more common
among the Ijo and Brassmen, and women are afflicted in a considerably
greater proportion than men. These possessions--which are invariably
made by the Owu or water spirit--may occur at any time, or in any place,
and as soon as a woman jumps up and begins to talk a strange
language--usually either Okrika or Kila--it is the first as it is a sure
indication that she has become possessed. The fact that in many
instances the obsessed person in her normal state is unable to speak the
tongue which, when possessed, she speaks quite fluently, is naturally
looked upon as direct evidence that it is the investing spirit who
speaks and not the woman herself. So, too, a girl or woman who through
excessive shyness is too coy to dance in public, develops, when under
the influence of the Owu, an excess of boldness, which enables her to do
things that under ordinary conditions she would not dream of doing. This
boldness is to these natives merely the confirmation of a pre-existing
conviction that it is not the person that is doing these things but the
spirit who has invaded and obsessed her.

"It is further believed that persons so afflicted are possessed of
physical strength which is altogether superhuman, so that when they
become violent and uncontrollable they are scarcely to be overcome by
half a dozen or more able-bodied men."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, pp. 227-28*.

<span id="xref_46f">46f</span> *Meek says of the Yaku*: "As the dance
proceeds they are one by one assailed with convulsive shiverings, wave
their arms, strike themselves and throw themselves on the ground like
demented persons."  
*A Sudanese Kingdom, p. 278*.

<span id="xref_47">47</span>. POSSESSIONS ON GRAVE

<span id="xref_47a">47a</span> *Burton says of Dahome*: "At the end of
the funeral customs, especially in the Old Calabar River, a small house
is built upon the beach, and in it are placed the valuables possessed by
the departed--

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

some whole, and others broken,--statues, clocks, vases, porcelains, and
so forth."  
*A Mission to Gelele, King of Dahome*, II, *p. 262*.

<span id="xref_47b">47b</span> *Nassau says of the Benga, the Mpongwe
and the Fang*: "Formerly also slaves carried boxes of the dead man's
goods, cloth, I hardware, crockery, and so forth, to be laid by the
body, which in those days was not interred, but was left on the top of
the ground covered with branches and leaves."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 218*.

<span id="xref_47c">47c</span> *Talbot says of the Ibibio*: "Next a
table and some of the finest pieces of household furniture, together
with jars, dishes, and bowls of old china, were carried thither and set
in order. When all had been arranged, the coffin was carefully lowered
down the shaft, borne through the passage and laid upon the
resting-place so reverently prepared."  
*Life in Southern Nigeria, p. 154*.

<span id="xref_48">48</span>. ROOT DOCTORS

<span id="xref_48a">48a</span> *Cardinall says of the Gold Coast*: "With
the belief that spiritual agents are the cause of misfortune and
sickness, it follows that medical treatment consists generally in
charms. There are certain men considered most proficient in the curative
art. These are the *liri-tina* (Kassena), *tiindana* (Nankanni),
*tinyam* (Builsa), (owner of medicine). Their medicines are drawn from
the bush, and are usually bitter-tasting grasses, herbs, and barks. For
poultices the same herbs are used mixed with shea-butter and charcoal
and ashes. Usually they are covered with cow-dung. It is said that the
stronger the smell the more easily will the evil spirit causing the
sickness be driven away."  
*The Natives of the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast, p. 46*.

<span id="xref_48b">48b</span> *Cruickshank says of the Gold Coast
native*: "The natives of the Gold Coast have Do despicable knowledge of
the qualities of herbs. A collection of these was, at one time, sent
home for analysis; and it was found generally that they possessed some
qualities calculated to be of use in alleviating the diseases for which
the natives applied them."  
*Eighteen Years an the Gold Coast*, II, *147*.

<span id="xref_48c">48c</span> *Leyden says of the interior sections of
West Africa, such a, the Congo, the banks of the Senegal and the Gambia,
etc*.: "The

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

magicians appear to have been resorted to universally in cases of
malady, which proved a hard trial on the faith even of the steadiest
converts. When their children or near relations were seized with
illness, they immediately began to cast a longing eye towards their old
method of cure; and if they had not recourse to it, they even incurred
reproach among their neighbors, as suffering their relation to die,
rather than incur the expence of a magician."  
*Historical Account of Discoveries and Travels in Africa*, I, *120*.

<span id="xref_48d">48d</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: "The believer in
witchcraft feels he has a right to protect himself by every means in his
power, and chief among these is the employment of a witch-doctor . . .
\[who\] is therefore considered just as essential in most negro
communities as a medical practitioner is amongst ourselves, and, though
some witch-doctors may abuse their powers for selfish ends, as a class
they are regarded as champions of morality."  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, p. 345*.

<span id="xref_48e">48e</span> *Nassau, quoting Menzies' History of
Religion, p. 73, says of the Benja, the Mpongwe, the Fang, and other
West African tribes*: "'There is generally a special person in a tribe
who knows these things, and is able to work them. He has more power over
spirits than other men have, and is able to make them do what he likes.
He can heal sickness, he can foretell the future, he can change a thing
into something else, or a man into a lower animal, or a tree, or
anything; he can also assume such transformations himself at will. He
uses means to bring about such results; he knows about herbs, he has
also recourse to rubbing, to making images of affected parts in the
body, and to various other arts. . . . It is the spirit dwelling in him
which brings about the wonderful results; without the spirit he could
not do anything.'"  
*Fetichism in West Africa, pp. 86-87*.

<span id="xref_48f">48f</span> *Ward says of the Bakongo tribes*: "it is
a general belief with the Bakongo that all sickness is the result of
witchcraft exercised by some member of the community, and the services
of the charm-doctor are employed to discover the individual who is
*ndoki*, *i.e.*, bedeviled, and guilty of devouring the spirit of the
unfortunate invalid; and in the event of the sick person dying, the
medicine-man is deputed by the relatives of the deceased to find out the
witch who has 'eaten the heart.'"

<span id="xref_50">50</span>. SERPENTS

<span id="xref_50a">50a</span> *Beckwith says of Jamaica*: "The snake is
the 'baddest of all,' anyone will affirm, but as there are seldom to be
found snakes in Jamaica today this takes one back in the history of
obeah to the days of *ob*, to the voodoo, and the Obeah Man of the past
who carried 'A staff carved with snakes or with a human head on the
handle, a cabalistic book and a stuffed snake.'"  
*Black Roadways, p. 122*.

<span id="xref_50b">50b</span> *Leonard says of Southern Nigeria*:
"Reptiles, snakes, and crocodiles particularly are much more utilised as
emblems, simply, it is to be presumed, because they are more in evidence
in the forests and rivers of the Delta than any other species of
animals, consequently must have appealed to the natives as the most
convenient and suitable repositories for the ancestral manes."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 317*.

<span id="xref_50c">50c</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
Dahomey*: "The next personal spirit or force we are to describe is one
less esteemed than feared. It is called Dą, which signifies 'serpent.'
What is the power of Dą? All serpents are Dą but not all serpents are
worshipped. Quintessentially, Dą represents the principle of mobility,
of sinuosity. 'All things which curve, and move, but have no feet, are
Dą.'"  
*An Outline of Dahomean Religious Beliefs, p. 56*.

<span id="xref_50d">50d</span> Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Paramaribo Negro: "The most prevalent types of *winti* among women
in particular are those associated with the snake, and since these enter
into all the categories of winti, we list them after the gods of the Sky
and Earth. Of these we have *Dagowe*, *Papa*, *Vɔdų*, *Hei̪-grɔ̨*,
*Aboma*, *Aninine*, *Alado*, *Sinero*, *Korowena*, *Kwεnda*,
*Tobochina*, and *Cheno*. The term *Dagowe* often serves, in the town,
as a generic term for all the snake spirits, though the *Dagowe*, snake,
properly speaking, is one of the constrictor group found in the colony,
and is believed by the natives to inhabit both land and water. This is,
of course, good observation on their part, for this characteristic of
all snakes of the boa type is well-known. Not all snakes are sacred, yet
no one will kill a snake."  
*Suriname Folk-Lore, pp. 63-64*.

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

<span id="xref_50e">50e</span> *Talbot says of the Ibibio tribes*: "Each
great Ibibio Juju man is supposed to keep one such serpent familiar in
his house, in the 'bush' where secret rites are celebrated, or in some
place by the waterside. It is called Kukubarakpa, and, by virtue of this
agent, much of the magician's power is said to come to him. The
possession of a snake is also supposed to bring riches, though its magic

<span id="xref_51">51</span>. SERPENTS, DREAM OF

<span id="xref_51a">51a</span> *Leonard says of Southern Nigeria*: "A
snake seen in a dream implies a host of enemies seeking to destroy the
dreamer's life. Nightmare is caused by the visitation of an evil or it
may be antipathetic spirit."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 147*.

<span id="xref_52">52</span>. SNEEZING

<span id="xref_52a">52a</span> *Puckett says of the Ewe*: "Sneezing is
regarded as a bad omen by the Ewe tribes of Africa because it indicates
that the indwelling spirit is about to quit the body, affording an
opportunity for a homeless spirit to enter in and cause illness. A
similar belief leads the Calabar natives to exclaim, 'Far from you!'
when a person sneezes, with an appropriate gesture as if throwing off
some evil."  
*Folk Beliefs of the Southern Negro, p. 453*.

<span id="xref_53">53</span>. SPIDER STORIES

<span id="xref_53a">53a</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Suriname Negro*: "Though few tales have been recorded, these play an
important role in the life of the Suriname Negroes. They are, whatever
their nature, called *Anąnsi-tri*, the stories of Anansi, the Twi
trickster-hero, who, like in Curaçao, and Jamaica, has survived his
migration to the western hemisphere to be here, as on the Gold Coast,
the most important single character in the folk-tales of the Negroes of
these regions."

<span id="xref_55">55</span>. SPIRITS, DWARFS

<span id="xref_55a">55a</span> *Cardinall says of the Gold Coast*: "They
are *kyikyiri* (Kassena), *kukru* (Builsa), and *chichirigu* (Nankanni).
Sometimes they are visible to men, and in appearance resemble the
*mmotia* of the Ashanti, ill-shapen dwarfs . . . they annoy travellers

<span id="xref_56">56</span>. SPIRITS, EXISTENCE AFTER DEATH

<span id="xref_56a">56a</span> *Campbell says of the Aku, Yoruba
tribes*: "They believe in the spirit after death, and in its power of
being present among the living for good or evil purposes."  
*A Pilgrimage to My Motherland, p. 75*.

<span id="xref_56b">56b</span> *Cruickshank says of the Gold Coast
native*: "They are unanimous in thinking that there is in man a spirit
which survives the body. This spirit is supposed to remain near the
spot, where the body has been buried. They believe it to have a
consciousness of what is going on upon earth, and to have the power of
exercising some influence over their destiny."  
*Eighteen Years on the Gold Coast of Africa*, II, *135*.

<span id="xref_56c">56c</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Bush Negro of Dutch Guiana*: "As in Africa, the spirit of the dead
is powerful for good or evil, and the rites of death must be carried out
as tradition demands, so that the dead man may feel he has received
honor among the living and proper introduction to the world of the
dead."  
*Rebel Destiny, p. 4*.

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

<span id="xref_58">58</span>. SPIRIT, FOOD FOR

<span id="xref_58a">58a</span> *Cole says of West Africa*: "The spirits
of the dead, as well as genii, are also honored and adored. Food,
tobacco, and rum are placed on the graves for the departed, and their
aid is requested at the taking of a journey, or in times of need."  
*A Revelation of the Secret Orders of Western Africa, p. 39*.

<span id="xref_58b">58b</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "Food is
brought in the dishes from which the dead ate when alive, and each meal
is given to the *akɔvi̋* on guard, who takes three morsels and puts them
down one after the other near the corpse. She also allows water to drop
three times nearby, and then tells the wife of the deceased to gather up
and remove everything that has been put down. The dead man's pipe must
now be placed next to him; tobacco is put into it, and it is smoked for
the enjoyment of the dead man by the *akɔvi̋* and the wife who watch the
body."  
*Dahomey*, I, *356*.

<span id="xref_58c">58c</span> *Hutchinson says of the Efik*: "Amongst
the Efik tribe, who are the residents here, there exists a practice of
cooking food and leaving it on the table of a fabric called the 'devil
house,' which is erected near the grave of a man or woman. The food is
placed there in calabashes, and it is believed that the spirit of the
deceased, with those of the butchered serfs who are her or his
fellow-travelers, frequently came to partake of it in their journey to
the world of spirits, whither they are supposed to be travelling."  
*Ten Years' Wanderings Among the Ethiopians, pp. 206-07*.

<span id="xref_58d">58d</span> *Nassau says of West Africa*: "When
affairs are going wrong in the villages, and the people do not know the
cause, offerings of food and drink are taken to the grave to cause the
spirit to cease disturbing them, and prayers are made to it that it may
the rather bless them."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 220*.

<span id="xref_58e">58e</span> *Rattray says of Ashanti*: "An Ashanti
never drinks without pouring a few drops of the wine on the ground for
the denizens of the spirit world who may happen to be about (also some
for 'fetishes'). Food is constantly placed aside for them."  
*Ashanti Proverbs, p. 37*.

lying dead, as he did on the day of his death, then you know that there
is going to be an

other death in your clan; otherwise, to be visited by an ancestor only
means that he is hungry and you place food upon his stool."  
*Religion and Art in Ashanti, pp. 193-94*.

<span id="xref_59">59</span>. SPIRITS AND GHOSTS, GENERAL

<span id="xref_59a">59a</span> *Kingsley says of the West Coast of
Africa*: "Accounts of apparitions abound in all the West Coast
districts, and although the African holds them all in high horror and
terror, he does not see anything supernatural in his 'Duppy.' It is a
horrid thing to happen on, but there is nothing strange about it, and he
is ten thousand times more frightened than puzzled over the affair. He
does not want to 'investigate' to see whether there is anything in it.
He wants to get clear away, and make ju-ju against it, 'one time.'

"These apparitions have a great variety of form, for, firstly, there are
all the true spirits, nature spirits; secondly, the spirits of human
beings--these human spirits are held to exist before as well as during
and after bodily life; thirdly, the spirits of things."  
*Travels in West Africa*, p. 509.

<span id="xref_59b">59b</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Suriname Negro*: "When going home late from winti-dances, we were
led away from certain thoroughfares, and went a roundabout way to avoid
a corner, or a tree, or a house, because these were known to be 'bad'
places,--that is to say, they were haunted. At least two persons
accompanied us home, so that, in returning to their own homes, they
would not have to walk the streets alone. The hours that are dangerous
are mid-day, from 5:30 to 6:30 in the evening, and from 12:30 to 1:30 at
night."  
*Suriname Folk-Lore, p. 111*.

<span id="xref_59c">59c</span> *Rattray says of Ashanti*: "Sasabonsám.
Deriv. *bonsam*, a devil, or evil spirit (not the disembodied soul of
any particular person, just as the fetish is not a human spirit). Its
power is purely for evil and witchcraft. The *obayifo* is perhaps its
servant, as the terms are sometimes synonymous."  
*Ashanti Proverbs, p. 47*.

<span id="xref_60">60</span>. SPIRIT, GUARDIAN OF ENTRANCE (LEGBA)

<span id="xref_60a">60a</span> *Herskovits says of Haiti*: ". . . they
proceeded slowly to the gateway, where a ceremony was held for Legba,
the guardian of entrances, that he might permit the other loa to
pass."  
*Life in a Haitian Valley, pp. 172-73*.

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

<span id="xref_60b">60b</span> "Even at the church, however, where all
go to offer the prayers that are the central observances of the fête,
the many candles placed on the rocks at the entrances are usually for
St. Anthony; that same St. Anthony who, it will be recalled, is the
*loa* named Legba, the Guardian of all entrances."  
*Life in a Haitian Valley, p. 286*.

<span id="xref_61">61</span>. SPIRIT, GUARDIAN OF BURIED TREASURE

<span id="xref_61a">61a</span> *Herskovits says of Haiti*: "*Baka* are
often employed to guard buried money. 'In this country, when you find
money buried in jars, it is an affair of *baka*. There is never one jar,
but always two or three, and you must call a *hungan* to find out which
one you may take and which you must not touch. Generally the finder is
allowed to take half of the treasure, for if he took all he would be
tormented by the *baka* who had been left as guardian. Such jars, it is
said, are usually found with human bones beside them or under them, and
tradition has it that the slave-owners who are believed to have been
strong in magic customarily killed the most evil slave on a plantation
that his spirit might keep watch over the jars. If the owner never
returned, the spirit of the slave, as a 'sold *baka*,' remained to wreak
vengeance upon anyone who dared disturb his charge."  
*Life in a Haitian Valley, pp. 242-43*.

<span id="xref_62">62</span>. SPIRITS, PLAT-EYE

<span id="xref_62a">62a</span> *Johnson says of St. Helena*: "In the
Georgetown section plat-eye is used to signify a ghost or spook. Its
etymology is uncertain, and it may be an instance of an Africanism
surviving in a restricted area."  
*Folk Culture on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, p. 58*.

<span id="xref_62b">62b</span> *Nassau says of West Africa*: "Another
manifestation is that of the uvengwa. . . . It is the self-resurrected
spirit and body of a dead human being. It is an object of dread, and is
never worshipped in any manner whatever. Why it appears is not known.
Perhaps it shows itself only in a restless, unquiet, or dissatisfied
feeling. It is white in color, but the body is variously changed from
the likeness of the original human body. Some say that it has only one
eye, placed in the centre of the forehead. Some say that its feet are
webbed like an aquatic bird. It does not speak; it only wanders, looking
as if with curiosity."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 71*.

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

<span id="xref_63">63</span>. SPIRITS, RIVER

<span id="xref_63a">63a</span> *Cardinall says of the Gold Coast*:
"Spirits of rivers and waterholes are greatly respected. They are most
powerful spirits, too. They can slay men and they can bring much good
fortune. To them are brought many sacrifices of fowls and goats, etc. It
is said that these spirits live below the river-bed."  
*The Natives of the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast, p. 34*.

<span id="xref_63b">63b</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Paramaribo Negro*: "A fourth group of *winti* are those which are
associated with the river. This group, as all others, overlap the Snake
gods, since the constrictor lives in the water as well as on land.
However, there are other gods, among them the *kaimą*, which are
peculiar to the rivers alone. The river-gods are headed by the
*Liba-Mama*, or *Watra-Mama*, respectively Mother of the River, or
Mother of the Water, who, again, is not referred to by name. Among the
Saramacca tribe of Bush-Negroes, the river-gods go under the generic
name of Tone, and this name, like the name from the interior for the
gods in general, is also sometimes employed in Paramaribo."  
*Suriname Folk-Lore, pp. 64-65*.

<span id="xref_63c">63c</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: "At Eha-Amufu
(Nsukka Division) there is a river-cult, the priest of which is known as
the Atama Ebe. Ebe is the spirit of the river and controls the fish, who
are regarded as the spiritual counterparts of the inhabitants of
Eha-Amufu. The big fish are the counterparts of the principal men of the
village group, while the fry are the counterparts of persons of no
consequence. When a villager dies a fish dies, and when a fish dies a
villager dies. It is taboo, therefore, to catch fish in the river, and
much annoyance has been caused by visits of foreign fishermen who
disregard the local scruples. Ebe, the spirit of the river, being the
guardian of the fish, which are his children and messengers, is regarded
as the giver of children to men, and is thus the object of public and
private worship."  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, p. 38*.

<span id="xref_64">64</span>. STEALING FROM GRAVE

<span id="xref_64a">64a</span> *Nassau says of the interior tribes of
the West Coast*: "A noticeable fact about these gifts to the spirits is
that, however great a thief a man may be, he will not steal from a
grave. The coveted mirror will lie there and waste in the rain, and the
valuable garment will flap itself to rags in the wind, but human hands
will not

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

touch them. Sometimes the temptation to steal is removed, by the donor
fracturing the article before it is laid on the grave."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 232*.

<span id="xref_65">65</span>. TABOOS

<span id="xref_65a">65a</span> *Bosman says of Guinea*: "Each Person
here is forbidden the eating of one sort of Flesh or other; one eats no
Mutton, another no Goats-Flesh, Beef, Swines-Flesh, Wild-Fowl, Cocks
with white feathers, &c. This Restraint is not laid upon them for a
limited time, but for their whole Lives: And if the Romanists brag of
the Antiquities of their Ecclesiastical Commands; so if you ask the
Negroes why they do this, they will readily tell you, because their
Ancestors did so from the beginning of the World and it hath been handed
down from one Age to another by Tradition. The Son never eats what the
Father is restrained from, as the Daughter herein follows the Mother's
Example; and this Rule is as strictly observed amongst them, that 'tis
impossible to persuade them to the contrary."  
*Description of the Coast of Guinea, pp. 154-55*.

<span id="xref_65b">65b</span> *Burton says of the Dahomean*: "Some are
allowed to eat beef, others only mutton; many are prohibited to touch
the flesh of goats. Poultry is permitted to some, eggs to others."  
*A Mission to Gelele, King of Dahome*, II, *361-62*.

<span id="xref_65c">65c</span> *Ellis says of the Ewe*: "The usual
reverence is paid by the members of a clan to the animal or plant from
which the clan takes its name. It may not be used as food, or molested
in any way; but must always be treated with veneration and respect. The
general notion is that the members of the clan are directly descended
from the animal, or plant, eponymous."  
*The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 100*.

<span id="xref_65d">65d</span> *Ellis says of the Tshi*: "With some
races the reverence originally felt for the deceased ancestor, and in
later times transferred to the animal for which he was named, culminates
in the animal being regarded as a tutelary deity, and consequently a
being to be worshipped and propitiated by sacrifice; but in other
cases-and this is almost always the case with the family divisions of
the natives of the Gold Coast-an abstention from the use of the flesh of
the animal whose name the family bears, is sometimes the only remaining
sign of any feeling of reverence or respect."  
*The Tshi-Speaking Peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa, p. 206*.

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

<span id="xref_65e">65e</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Suriname Negro*: "An illness may be caused by . . . an unconscious
violation, arising out of the fact that a man's mother had never told
him the name of his true father, and consequently he had been observing
food taboos which were not his own and had been neglecting to observe
those which were his, since, as we have seen, these personal food taboos
are inherited from the father."  
*Suriname Folk-Lore, pp. 59-60*.

<span id="xref_66">66</span>. TEETH, CHILDREN BORN WITH

<span id="xref_66a">66a</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: "Children born
feet first or with teeth or any deformity were also destroyed, on the
ground that they were incarnations of evil spirits."  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, pp. 290-91*.

<span id="xref_66b">66b</span> *Thomas says of the Ibo of Nigeria*: "Not
only twins, but many other children are, or were, exposed because of
some circumstance connected with their birth or development. For
example, a child born with teeth is regarded as a monster who will bring
misfortune on its father-perhaps the belief may be that it will devour
him. . . ."  
*Anthropological Report on the Ibo-Speaking Peoples of Nigeria*, I, *pp.
10-11*.

<span id="xref_67">67</span>. TWINS

<span id="xref_67a">67a</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Suriname Negro*: "Twins, and the child born after twins, who is
called *Dosu*, and children born feet foremost, are in a category by
themselves, and they are often spoken of as *ɔgri*. . . . bad."  
*Suriname Folk-Lore, p. 42*.

<span id="xref_67b">67b</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: "And twins were
allowed to die or were deliberately killed by being enclosed in a pot or
ant-hill. For the Ibo hold the common belief that the birth of twins is
an indication of the disfavour of the spirits, and a punishment,
possibly of adultery. Twin-births are regarded as non-human, and it is a
common belief that the chi or accompanying soul of a twin is the chi of
an animal. After the birth of twins a diviner is consulted to ascertain
which spirit or ancestor had been offended, and sacrifice is offered to
appease his wrath."  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, p. 291*.

<span id="xref_67c">67c</span> *Nassau says of Africa*: "All over Africa
the birth of twins is a notable event, but noted for very different
reasons in different

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

parts of the country. In Calabar they are dreaded as an evil omen, and
until recently were immediately put to death, and the mother driven from
the village to live alone in the forest as a punishment for having
brought this evil on her people.

"In other parts, as in the Gabun country, where they are welcomed, it is
nevertheless considered necessary to have special ceremonies performed
for the safety of their lives, or, if they die, to prevent further
evil."  
*Fetichism in West Africa, p. 206*.

<span id="xref_68">68</span>. WITCHES, ANIMAL FORM

<span id="xref_68a">68a</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "The
*azɔ̨ndato*, as such practitioners are called, are spoken of in whispers,
and are said to be organized into a close guild. They exercise power
over the souls of those who have not had proper burial and therefore
wander about the earth discontented, and over these souls procured by
'killing' their owners in the manner described above. These *azɔ̨ndato*
are to be recognized by their blood-shot eyes, and Dahomeans stealthily
point out two or three such persons in the market-place who usually may
be remarked to be doing somewhat better business than those who sit near
them. These dangerous individuals change into bats at night, or assume
other animal forms and go forth to hold council together or to perform
their dark deeds."  
*Dahomey*, II, *287*.

<span id="xref_68b">68b</span> *Meek says of Nigeria*: "Witches
(*amozu*) and wizards (*ogboma*) have also animal counterparts, and so
assume the forms of owls, lizards, vultures, and numerous species of
night-birds. Consequently, if a night-bird comes and rests on a house,
the owner loses no time in trying to drive it away or shoot it; and if
he fails he will seize his *ofo* and call on his ancestors or any local
deity to rid him of his enemy. A witch always assails at night. By magic
means she attacks the throat, so that the victim is paralysed and cannot
move or speak, and in the morning may be found lying senseless and naked
outside his hut. . . . Witches can penetrate into a house through the
smallest cracks in the wall, and can assume the form of the smallest
insect. Flies and other creatures which bite are witches or the agents
of witches, and if a person is severely bitten he may consult a diviner,
who will order the patient to offer sacrifice to propitiate some witch,
and induce the witch to remove the spell by transferring it to some one
else. Witches can poison food or infect it with sorcery, and if any one
eats a meal cooked by a witch he will become seriously ill or die.
Mothers,

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

therefore, advise their children to avoid eating food outside their own
homes."  
*Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe*, pp. 79-80.

<span id="xref_68c">68c</span> *Talbot says of Southern Nigeria*:
"Witches often change into leopards and other animals."  
*The Peoples of Southern Nigeria*, II, *219*.

<span id="xref_68d">68d</span> "Witchcraft seems to have been more
dreaded in the Oru clan than among any other Ibo. . . . They can change
into crocodiles, fish, leopards, bush-cows, snakes and goats."  
*The Peoples of Southern Nigeria*, II, *213*.

<span id="xref_68e">68e</span> *Farrow says*: "The witch-doctor is, of
course, a privileged person. He is called in to trace the source of
disease and death, for these are generally attributed to witchcraft,
unless they are evidently caused by the vengeance of Shopono (smallpox),
Shango, or some similar deity. Various forms of disease are described as
'snakes inside' (*ejo-inu*), 'an insect' (*kokoro*), etc., and it is
supposed that these have been introduced by a foe through the agency of
witchcraft."  
*Faith, Fancies and Fetish, p. 125*.

<span id="xref_69">69</span>. WITCHES, RIDING VICTIMS

<span id="xref_69a">69a</span> *Ellis says of the Vais*: "There is a
belief, as I have stated, among the Vais that witches come to your house
and ride you at night,--that when the witch comes in the door he takes
off his skin and lays it aside in the house. It is believed that he
returns you to the Ned where he found you, and that the witch may be
killed by sprinkling salt and pepper in certain portions of the room,
which will prevent the witch from putting on his skin. Just before they
go to bed it is a common thing to see Vais people sprinkling salt and
pepper about the room."  
*Negro Culture in West Africa, p. 63*.

<span id="xref_69b">69b</span> *Leonard says*: "In Brass the natives
firmly believe that witches exist, and that certain persons by natural
operations--or rather by co-operation with natural forces--possess the
power of inflicting disease, injury, or death upon their neighbours.
These individuals are divided into two classes--the harmful and the
harmless.

"The former are said to go out of their houses at night, and to hold
meetings with demons and their colleagues, to determine whose life is
next to be destroyed. This is done by gradually sucking the blood of the
victim through some supernatural and invisible

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

means the effect of which on the victim is imperceptible to others."  
*The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 486*.

<span id="xref_69c">69c</span> Rattray says of Ashanti: "Men and women
possessed of this black magic are credited with volitant powers, being
able to quit their bodies and travel great distances in the night.
Besides sucking the blood of victims, they are supposed to be able to
extract the sap and juices of crops."  
*Ashanti Proverbs, p. 48*.

<span id="xref_70">70</span>. WOODCARVING AND WEAVING

<span id="xref_70a">70a</span> *Herskovits says*: "In West Africa, the
development of techniques of all kinds is the greatest on the continent.
The Benin bronzes, the brass-work of Dahomey, the weaving of the
Ashanti, or the wood carving of the Ivory Coast, Dahomey, and Nigeria
are famous, while pottery of a high grade, basketry, and iron work are
found everywhere."  
*Social History of the Negro, p. 221*.

<span id="xref_70b">70b</span> *Herskovits says of the Bush Negro*: "In
the villages of the Bush Negroes the artist holds an enviable position,
and the good carver is sought after in marriage and often wins the most
desirable young woman for his wife. This is because Suriname woodcarving
is a part of all phases of life."  
*Social History of the Negro, p. 247*.

<span id="xref_70c">70c</span> *Herskovits says of Dahomey*: "But, as
stated, the greatest proportion of objects are intended for some
specific end. The spotted hyena, for example, formed a handle for the
staff of a chief. The two wands with human figures on them are employed
in the Fá cult. The three figures in the background of the same plate,
representing a woman, an animal, and a bird respectively, support cups
which hold the seeds employed in the Fate cult.  
*Dahomey*, II, *370*.

<span id="xref_70d">70d</span> "Wood-carving is the most democratic, and
the most widely practiced, of all the arts. It constitutes the one mode
of artistic expression open to all men in Dahomey, for, as in many
cultures, wood-carving is not a technique permitted to women. In
addition, however, to the democratic nature of the art it pervades the
daily life of the people to a greater degree than any other art-form,
and a catalogue of the uses to which the objects carved in wood are put
by the Dahomeans would touch upon all elements of Dahomean culture.
Carvings thus catalogued would range from the artistic

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

statuettes found in the shrines of the gods and the smaller human
figures used as *gbo^*, the beautifully carved cups which hold the
palm-kernels employed in the Fá cult, and the carefully worked handles
of the Xεvioso axes, all of which indicate the association of
wood-carving with religion, to the mortars, stools, and other decorated
objects used in the everyday round of life."  
*Dahomey*, II, *363*.

<span id="xref_70e">70e</span> "Among these forms are plastic and
graphic arts, music, dancing and a wide range of oral literature. In the
former group woodcarving is the most widespread and the most commonly
practised. As will be indicated in detail below, carvings in wood enter
many phases of life. Statues of the gods, human forms which, as gbo^,
protect the owner and his household, and the implements of the Fate
cult, are all a part of the religious life. The sceptres of King and
chiefs, and the elaborately carved stools on which they sat were
indispensable symbols of rank and succession. The wands of office and
stools of sib-chiefs associate this art with social organisation,
especially where the totem animal is figured, while even the *adjí*
game-boards of the Dahomeans are embellished by the carvings of the
artist."  
*Dahomey*, II, *311*.

<span id="xref_70f">70f</span> *Melville and Frances Herskovits say of
the Bush Negro of Dutch Guiana*: "There were other carvings which we
bought-a large rice-carrying tray, and some food stirrers, one of which
was especially fine, made as it was of two small paddles with miniature
blades, the handles joined by a wooden ring-chain, and all of this
carved out of one piece of wood."  
*Rebel Destiny, p. 277*.

<span id="xref_70g">70g</span> "Few things on the river seemed to the
outsiders more characteristic of the life of the Saramacca people than
these carvings which were met with everywhere, however small the
village, however poor the home. When the seasonal rains came, men
incised their desires on wood, which later told the legend of
procreation, or safety on the river, or a curse invoked against a woman
if she proved unfaithful; or something of humor, such as a man bidding
for a girl's favor, and she refusing him, while up above intertwined
were a man and woman, symbolizing the ultimate consummation with the
proper suitor."  
*Rebel Destiny, pp. 277-78*.

<span id="xref_70h">70h</span> *Talbot says of the Sudanese tribes*:
"Carving in wood is common among all tribes, but is for the most part
rather crude. In all

cases articles were as far as possible made from the solid block; never
nailed or glued together."  
*The Peoples of Southern Nigeria*, III, *928*.

<span id="xref_70i">70i</span> "The varieties of woven work include
checker, twilled and wicker; others are plaited, and there are several
sorts of coiled basketry. The oblong market baskets used by the women,
particularly among the Ibo and many of the Semi-Bantu tribes, closely
resemble those of the Ancient Egyptians."  
*The Peoples of Southern Nigeria*, III, *938*.
