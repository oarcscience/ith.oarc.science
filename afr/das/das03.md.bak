# FOREWORD

The coastal region of Georgia and South Carolina is a fertile field for
the study of old cultural heritages. Artists, poets, and novelists are
not the only ones who have felt the, allure of this region with its old
plantations, its sleepy towns, its cypress swamps, its moss-hung trees,
its ox carts, and its Negro peasantry. The works of C. C. Jones, Jr.,
John Bennett, Marcellus Whaley, Ambrose Gonzales, Reed Smith, Elsie C.
Parsons, Ballanta-Taylor, T. J. Woofter, Jr., Guion G. Johnson, Guy B.
Johnson, Robert Gordon, Lorenzo Turner, and others testify to the
continuing interest of scholars in the history, folklore, folk music,
and dialect of the Negro people of this region. These Negroes, more
perhaps than any others in the United States, have lived in a physical
and cultural isolation which is conducive to the survival of many old
customs and thoughtways, both African and European. The present work
represents an effort to go a bit deeper than any other work has done
into certain aspects of the folk culture of these people in the coastal
area. it is particularly welcome at this time, for it not only covers an
area which has not received as much attention as have other areas,
notably those around Charleston and Beaufort, but it is oriented toward
the problem of African heritages in this country, a problem which is
coming to be more and more important to the cultural anthropologist.

Readers of DRUMS AND SHADOWS will encounter much that is familiar, for
many of the customs and beliefs found among the Georgia coastal Negroes
are not peculiar to them.

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indeed, many of
these traits, such as the belief in ghosts, witches, and conjure, are
either known or practiced by thousands of white and Negro people in
other parts of the United States; while the dogmas and methods of Father
Divine and Bishop Grace seem to flourish best among the proletariat of
Harlem, Chicago, Detroit, Washington, Richmond, and other urban centers.
Nevertheless, one finds much in these pages which is new, and one senses
the great virility of old heritages in the daily lives of the coastal
Negroes.

DRUMS AND SHADOWS makes no pretense of offering a complete picture of
the life and culture of these people, but limits its scope of inquiry to
certain definite types. In undertaking the work, Miss Granger, the
supervisor, also wisely refrained from attempting to include an
investigation of subjects like folk music and dialect, which require
special training and technical analysis. The visits, interviews, and
observations were made by the workers on the Georgia Writers' Project.
The investigators were enthusiastic and persistent, and, in spite of the
fact that they had had no formal training in ethnological methods, they
have made a real contribution to knowledge. They have recorded what is
probably the most thorough search for African heritages among Negroes in
a small area that has ever been attempted in this country up to the
present time.

This question of the nature and importance of African heritage in
America bids fair to develop into something of a controversy. At one
extreme are scholars like Robert E. Park and E. B. Reuter who would not
even consider the matter debatable since they virtually deny the
existence of *any* significant Africanisms in the United States. Toward
the other extreme is Melville J. Herskovits, who believes that African
heritages are very significant, that they have contributed much to the
culture of white America, and that the study of these heritages may
point the way to racial understanding and the alleviation of friction
between the races in the United States. My own position lies somewhere
between these two, since I believe that there are a few important
African survivals in the United States, but that the degree of
significance of these African heritages is questionable in view of the
overwhelming tendency of the culture of the white

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

man to displace the Negro's African culture, and that their influence on
the everyday problem of race relations is relatively inconsequential.

However, regardless of differences of opinion as to the nature and
importance of African heritages in our civilization, almost everyone
would agree that the question is interesting and worthy of study. Such
study may not only satisfy a wholesome curiosity but may throw light on
the scientific problem of the processes which go on when two different
cultures come into contact. In dealing with the material collected for
this book, Miss Granger makes no decision as to the African sources of
particular traits. She has, however, included a valuable appendix on
West African culture patterns and has cited therein numerous possible
parallels between these patterns and the culture of Georgia coastal
Negroes.

DRUMS AND SHADOWS will interest the scholar as well as the general
reader, for it has combed over a strategic area, has discovered clues,
has raised problems, and thus made easier the way of any cultural
anthropologist who might want to follow and attempt a definitive
scientific study of the question of African heritages and influences in
American civilization.
