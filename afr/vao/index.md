# VOODOOS AND OBEAHS

## Phases of West India Witchcraft

This companion book to [Psychic Phenomena of Jamaica](../ppj/index) goes
into much greater depth as to the New World-African connection, and adds
more material about Afro-Carribean religion in Haiti. The primary
strength of this work is the careful documentation of the history and
ethnography of Vodun. Williams includes numerous quotes from rare
documents and books on the subject. The weakness is the lack of detailed
information about the religious system of Vodun, which we now know to be
as complicated (or more so) than any of the major religions. There is
scarcely any mention of the loas, the pantheon of Vodun Gods and
Goddesses, and he misses the importance of possession during the
religious ceremonies. However, all things considered, this is required
reading if you want to understand the background of Haitian and Jamaican
Vodun, and the profound influence of imperialism, slavery and racism on
its development.--jbh.
