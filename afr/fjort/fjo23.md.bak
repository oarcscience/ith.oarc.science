# XX. THE WILD CAT AND THE GAZELLE.

NENPETRO (kind of wild cat) and Nsessi (the gazelle), agreed that in
case of famine the one might eat the other's mother. The famine came.
Nsessi killed Nenpetro's mother and ate her; but, loving his own mother
very much, he took her into the bush, and hid her there in a cave,
telling her never to come out unless she should bear him call her. Each
day he took her food, but not caring to carry it himself, he got
Nenpetro's little son to carry it for him.

Now this little boy felt with his father in his loss of his mother, and
so resolved to tell him where Nsessi kept his mother. Thus he told
Nenpetro, and showed him the way to the cave where Nsessi had hidden his
mother. Nenpetro then simulated the voice of Nsessi, and called to her
to come out. When she came, Nenpetro killed her and took her to town.
Then he had her cooked, and gave a feast, and invited Nsessi. But Nsessi
wondered where he could have got his meat, and went to look for his
mother. Could he have killed her? She was not there. Yes, he had killed
her. He refused Nenpetro's invitation, and said he would no longer live
in that town. So he called his people together, and they burned their
houses and went to live elsewhere.
