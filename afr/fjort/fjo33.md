# XXX. WHY THE CROCODILE DOES NOT EAT THE HEN.

THERE was a certain hen; and she used to go down to the river's edge
daily to pick up bits of food. One day a crocodile came near to her and
threatened to eat her, and she cried: "Oh, brother, don't!"

And the crocodile was so surprised and troubled by this cry that he went
away, thinking how he could be her brother. He returned again to the
river another day, fully determined to make a meal of the hen.

But she again cried out: "Oh, brother, don't

"Bother the hen!" the crocodile growled, as she once more turned away.
"How can I be her brother? She lives in a town on land; I live in mine
in the water."

Then the crocodile determined to see Nzambi about the question, and get
her to settle it; and so he went his way. He had not gone very far when
he met his friend Mbambi (a very large kind of lizard). " Oh, Mbambi!"
he said, "I am sorely troubled. A nice fat hen comes daily to the river
to feed; and each day, as I am about to catch her, and take her to my
home and feed on her, she startles me by calling me 'brother.' I can't
stand it any longer; and I am now off to Nzambi, to hold a palaver about
it."

"Silly idiot!" said the Mbambi, do nothing of the sort, or you will only
lose the palaver and show your ignorance. Don't you know, dear
crocodile, that the duck lives in the water and lays eggs? the turtle
does the same; and I also lay eggs. The hen does the same; and so do
you, my silly friend. Therefore we are all brothers in a sense." And for
this reason the crocodile now does not eat the hen.
