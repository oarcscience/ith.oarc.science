# XIII. THE YOUNGER BROTHER WHO KNEW MORE THAN THE ELDER.

IN a certain town there lived two brothers who could not agree with one
another, the younger continually asserting that he knew more than his
brother, thus enraging his elder.

At last the younger brother said he could stand it no longer, and
threatened to leave his town. So he and his wife left the town and
wandered far away, until at last they entered a wood and came to a
little river of very clear water.

"Let us drink," he said," and sit down here, as there does not seem to
be a path leading from the river on the other side."

So they drank and rested. Then he got up and waded down the stream some
way, and found a pathway on the other side of the river. He called his
wife, and they proceeded on their way. Soon they heard voices, and
wondered what kind of people could have built in such a place.

"Let us go back," said the wife;" how do you know that these people will
not harm us?"

"Nay, I will not go back; so let us enter the town at once."

They saw only two or three huts.

Now these huts, or shimbecs, were inhabited by a man and his wife, who
had left his town on account of certain "palavers" that had been
constantly pushed against him.

"And where do you come from?" said he, as the stranger and his wife
entered his clearing.

The younger brother told him how it was that he had left his town and
wandered there, and added that he would like to live there with him.

"Very well, you can do so. But first tell me, are you a bad man?"

"No, certainly not; I am a good man, the others treated me badly."

"Well, there's a shimbec for you; stay there."

They did nothing for four days; but on the fifth day the man proposed
that they should take their women with their hoes to a certain place he
knew of, and get them to dig a large hole, which they would cover over
with dried sticks and leaves, so as to form a trap for the many wild
animals that passed that way. This they did.

"Now, that we may not quarrel over the game we catch, tell me: which
will you have, the males or the females?"

The younger brother said he would take the males.

"Agreed! Then I will take the females."

Agreed!"

They went back to their towns, and slept soundly that night. The next
morning very early they went to see their trap. They had caught an ox.

"'Tis yours," said the owner of the town, "take it."

The next day an antelope, the next day a chimbimbi, \[1\] and

\[1. A kind of antelope-mouse coloured with a fawn-coloured patch on its
shoulders and back, small straight horns like a goat.\]

the next a hog, each day a male of some kind, until the younger brother
had so much meat that he did not know what to do with it, But he gave
the owner of the town none of it. He sent his wife out into the woods to
gather sticks to smoke the meat, and so preserve it. Towards night he
became anxious about her, as she had not returned. He went to the owner
of the town and told him about it. But he could not account for her
absence.

"Let us go and look for her."

"Nay," said the man, "it is night. To-morrow we will go." The younger
brother roamed about the whole night, crying and moaning at the loss of
his wife. Early he awoke the owner of the town and asked him to go with
him to look for her.

"Yes. But first let us go and see the trap, for I have dreamt that luck
has changed, and that to-day we shall catch a female."

They went, and soon discovered the female in the trap. It was the young
man's wife. Overjoyed at finding her the young man wanted to jump into
the hole to help her out. But the man reminded him of his agreement, and
how he had given him nothing of all the meat he had entrapped.

"Nay, take all the meat you like, but my wife is a human being, surely
you will not kill and eat her?"

"She is mine by agreement, I can do as I like with her." And thus they
went on wrangling the day through.

Now the elder brother had gone out bunting and had chanced to come into
the wood not far from where the trap was. He heard voices, and so crept
cautiously up in that direction. He recognised his brother's voice and
ran to him. The younger brother was overjoyed to see him, and welcomed
him boisterously. The elder brother met him coldly. When the owner of
the town knew who the stranger was, he laid the whole matter before him,
and asked him to say whether the female in the trap was his or not. The
elder heard all, and answered that the female in the trap was certainly
his, and that he had better go in and kill her. The younger brother
tried to restrain him; but the man flung him aside and jumped into the
trap.

"Fool," said the elder to the younger, when he saw him trying to stop
the man from entering the pit; "can you not yet trust your brother's
superior wisdom? See, now, that male in your trap; he is yours by
agreement, even as your wife is his. Spare his life, and perhaps he will
give you back your wife." The man saw how he had been fooled, and gave
the woman up. The two brothers and the wife then returned to their town.
