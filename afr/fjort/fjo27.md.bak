# XXIV. THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE TWO FETISHES, LIFUMA AND CHIMPUKELA.

Now this is a sad but true story, for it is of recent occurrence, and
many living witnesses can vouch for its truth.

Poor King Jack, late of Cabinda, now retired a little into the interior
of KaCongo, known to all who visit this part of Africa, either in
whaler, steamer, or man of war, owns the fetish called Lifuma. Lifuma
had all his life sniffed the fresh sea-breezes, and rejoiced with his
people when they returned from the deep sea in their canoes laden with
fish. But now circumstances (namely, the occupation of Cabinda by the
Portuguese) forced him to retire to the interior, behind the coast-line
between Futilla and Cabinda. How he longed to see his people happy yet
again is proved by the trouble he put himself to in trying to gain
possession of a part of the sea-beach that he thought should belong to
his "hinterland." He left the sweet waters of Lake Chinganga Miyengela
(waters that have travelled even to the white man's country, and
returned without being corrupted) and quietly travelled down to the
sea-beach, near to a place called Kaia. Once there, he picked up a few
shells and pebbles, and filled a pint mug with salt water, meaning to
carry them back to his sweet-water home, and to place them on the holy
ground beside him as a sign of his ownership of the sea-beach, and as a
means whereby his people might once more play on the sea-beach by the
salt water, and once again occupy themselves in fishing in the deep blue
sea. Peaceful and benevolent was indeed his mission, and perhaps, as he
passed the town of Kaia and Subantanu unmolested, he at last thought
that his object was secured. Alas! the bird Ngundu espied him, and
rushed to town to acquaint the Kaia people's fetish, called Chimpukela.
Then Chimpukela, ran after Lifuma, and caught him up, and roughly asked
him what he had there, bidden under his cloth.

"Go away," cried the anxious Lifuma, as he pushed Chimpukela aside.

Chimpukela stumbled over an ant-hill and fell, so that when he got up
again he was very angry with Lifuma, and knocked him down. Poor Lifuma
fell upon a thorn of the Minyundu tree and broke his leg. The mug of
salt water was also spilt, and Chimpukela took from him all the relies
he had gathered upon his sea-beach.

Then Chimpukela swore that ant-hills should no longer exist in his
country, and that is why you never see one there now as you travel
through his country.

And Lifuma cursed the bird Ngundu, and the tree Minyundu, and canoes,
and salt water, and everything pertaining to the beach. And that is why
all these things do not now exist in his country, or on his sweet-water
lake.
