# XVI. HOW THE SPIDER WON AND LOST NZAMBI'S DAUGHTER.

NZAMBI on earth had a beautiful daughter; but she swore that no earthly
being should marry her, who could not bring her the heavenly fire from
Nzambi Mpungu, who dwelt in the heavens above the blue roof. And as the
daughter was very fair to look upon, the people marvelled, saying: "How
shall we secure this treasure? and who on such a condition will ever
marry her?"

Then the spider said: "I will, if you will help me."

And they all answered: "We will gladly help you, if you will reward us."

Then the spider reached the blue roof of heaven, and dropped down again
to the earth, leaving a strong silken thread firmly hanging from the
roof to the earth below. Now, he called the tortoise, the woodpecker,
the rat, and the sandfly, and bade them climb up the thread to the roof.
And they did so. Then the woodpecker pecked a hole through the roof, and
they all entered the realm of the badly dressed Nzambi Mpungu.\[1\]

Nzambi Mpungu received them courteously, and asked them what they wanted
up there.

\[1. See Appendix, p. 133\]

And they answered him, saying: "O Nzambi Mpungu of the heavens above,
great father of all the world, we have come to fetch some of your
terrible fire, for Nzambi who rules upon earth."

"Wait here then," said Nzambi Mpungu, "while I go to my people and tell
them of the message that you bring."

But the sandfly unseen accompanied Nzambi Mpungu and heard all that was
said. And while he was gone, the others wondered if it were possible for
one who went about so poorly clad to be so powerful.

Then Nzambi Mpungu returned to them, and said: "My friend, how can I
know that you have really come from the ruler of the earth, and that you
are not impostors?"

"Nay," they said; "put us to some test that we may prove our sincerity
to you."

"I will," said Nzambi Mpungu. "Go down to this earth of yours, and bring
me a bundle of bamboos, that I may make myself a shed."

And the tortoise went down, leaving the others where they were, and soon
returned with the bamboos.

Then Nzambi Mpungu said to the rat: "Get thee beneath this bundle of
bamboos, and I will set fire to it. Then if then escape I shall surely
know that Nzambi sent you."

And the rat did as he was bidden. And Nzambi Mpurigu set fire to the
bamboos, and lo! when they were entirely consumed, the rat came from
amidst the ashes unharmed.

Then he said: "You are indeed what you represent yourselves to be. I
will go and consult my people again."

Then they sent the sandfly after him, bidding him to keep well out of
sight, to hear all that was said, and if possible to find out where the
lightning was kept. The midge returned and related all that he had heard
and seen.

Then Nzambi Mpungu returned to them, and said: "Yes, I will give you the
fire you ask for, if you can tell me where it is kept."

And the spider said: "Give me then, O Nzambi Mpungu, one of the five
cases that you keep in the fowl-house."

"Truly you have answered me correctly, O spider! Take therefore this
case, and give it to your Nzambi."

And the tortoise carried it down to the earth; and the spider presented
the fire from heaven to Nzambi; and Nzambi gave the spider her beautiful
daughter in marriage.

But the woodpecker grumbled, and said: "Surely the woman is mine; for it
was I who pecked the hole through the roof, without which the others
never could have entered the kingdom of the Nzambi Mpungu above."

"Yes," said the rat, "but see how I risked my life among the burning
bamboos; the girl, I think, should be mine."

"Nay, O Nzambi; the girl should certainly be mine; for without my help
the others would never have found oat where the fire was kept," said the
sandfly.

Then Nzambi said: "Nay, the spider undertook to bring me the fire; and
he has brought it. The girl by rights is his; but as you others will
make her life miserable if I allow her to live with the spider, and I
cannot give her to you all, I will give her to none, but will give you
each her market value."

Nzambi then paid each of them fifty longs of cloth and one case of gin;
and her daughter remained a maiden and waited upon her mother for the
rest of her days.
