# XXVIII. THE BIRD-MESSENGERS.

ALL the towns in Molembo or Neotchi were suffering terribly from the
awful scourge or evil wind (the disease we know by the name of
small-pox). And the chief prince called the princes and people together
and asked them if it were not time to ask Nzambi Mpungu why he was so
cross with them? And they all agreed that it was so. But whom were they
to send? They said that the Ngongongo was a wonderful bird, and could
fly in a marvellous way. They sent him with a message to Nzambi Mpungu;
but when he got there, and cried out "quang, quang, quang," it was
evident that Nzambi Mpungu did not understand his tongue. So he flew
back back to Neotchi and reported his failure.

Then Neotchi sent the rock-pigeon (mbemba), but he could not make Nzambi
Mpungu understand, and he also returned to Neotchi.

Then the prince sent the ground-dove (ndumbu nkuku), and she went and
sang before Nzambi Mpungu:

"Fuka Matenda ma fua  
Vanji Maloango ma fua  
Vanji Makongo ma fua  
Sukela sanga vi sia."

("Mafuka Matenda is dead,  
Vanji Maloango is dead,  
Vanji Makongo is dead;  
This is the news that I bring."\[1\])

And Nzambi Mpungu heard what the dove had said, but answered not.

\[1. *Mafuka* means ambassador, and is a title given to certain rich
natives. *Matenda* is the name of a prince of KaCongo. *Vanji* is a
title and has the sense of creator, lord. The last line is a form
expressing that one has delivered one's message.\]
