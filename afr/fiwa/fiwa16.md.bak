# CHAPTER XIV

### FETICH--ITS RELATION TO THE FUTURE LIFE--CEREMONIES AT DEATHS AND FUNERALS

WHEN a heathen Negro is sick, the first thing done, just as in civilized
lands, is to call the "doctor," who is to find out what is the
particular kind of spirit that, by invading the patient's body, has
caused the sickness.

This diagnosis is not made by an examination and comparison of the
physical and mental symptoms, but by drum, dance, frenzied song, mirror,
fumes of drugs, consultation of relies, and conversation with the spirit
itself. Next, as also in civilized lands, must be decided the ceremony
particular to that spirit, and the vegetable and mineral substances
supposed to be either pleasing or offensive to it. If all those cannot
be obtained, the patient must die; the assumption probably being that
some unknown person is antagonizing the "doctor" with arts of sorcery.

Fearing this, all the family relatives and friends come, hav ing been
informed by a messenger of the state of the case. They speak to and try
to comfort the sick, as would be done in civilization. But to believers
in fetich their coming means more than that. They have come from distant
places as soon as the news had spread that their relative was seriously
ill, without waiting for summons. Their coming is, indeed, a necessary
mark of respect for the sick; but it may happen, too, in case of the
sick man's dying, that it would be a proof for them of their innocence
if a charge should come up of witchcraft as the cause of death. The
neglect to make this prompt visit of condolence would be resented by the
sick should he recover, or, in case of his death, in the days when
witcheraft arts were more common, would have been held as a proof that
the absentee had purposely absented himself, under a sense of guilt.

In the sick man's village there already has been a slight wailing the
while that be is dying. Before life is extinct, and while yet the sick
may still be conscious though speechless, a low wail of mourning is
raised by the female relatives who have gathered in the room.

These visitors have sat quietly in the sick-room while the patient was
still conscious. To a foreigner that quiet is very strange in its
oppressive silence and in the stolidity of faces (at other times
expressive), whose very reason for being present is supposed to be the
expression of sympathy. Only a few assist in the making of food or
medicine for the patient, even when the medicines are not fetich. All
the others are spectators, smoking, lounging, dozing, or, if conversing,
speaking in a low tone. At the first report that death has actually
come, the women break into a louder wail.

But about a quarter of an hour is spent by some of the old members of
the family, testing to see whether life is really extinct. When that
fact is fully certified to the crowd in the street, the wailing breaks
forth unrestrainedly from men, women, and children. The moment that
death is declared, grief is demonstrated in screams, shrieks, yells,
pitiful supplication, and extravagant praise by the entire village.

Shortly after this first frantic outburst quiet is ordered, and the
arrangements for burial begin. The body is bathed and the limbs are
straightened. The stomach is squeezed so as to make the contents emerge
from the mouth in order that decomposition may be delayed and the body
kept as long as possible. The time will vary according to the necessity
of the case and the social position of the dead. Usually the corpse is
retained only one day; but in case of a prominent person as many as five
days, and in case of kings in some tribes, *e.g.*, of Loango, the
rotting corpse, rolled in many pieces of matting, is retained for weeks.

When the washing and vomiting have been done, the corpse is dressed in
its finest clothing. The bed-frame is often enlarged so that many of the
chief mourners may be able to sit on it.

The body is generally taken from the bed and laid on a piece of matting
on the floor. The chief female mourner is given the post of honor, to
sit nearest to the dead, holding the head in her lap.

During the time until the burial the women keep bending the joints of
the corpse to prevent the body becoming stiff. The day before the burial
(but if in haste, on the very day of the death) the coffin is made.
During the making the mourning which had been resumed is again bidden to
cease, in order that the spirit may be pleased with the wooden house
that is being constructed for it. For the same reason the wailing is
again intermitted while the grave is being dug. Those who are digging it
must not be called off or interrupted in any way. When begun, the job
must be continued to completion.

After the grave is completed, when they leave it and go to arrange the
coffin, they must put into the excavation some article, *e.g.*, a stick
of wood, as a notice to any other wandering spirit not to occupy that
grave.

When all these preparations are complete, the corpse is laid in the
coffin, and some goods of the deceased, such as pieces of cloth and
other clothing, are stuffed into it for his use in the other world. If
the deceased was addicted to smoking, a pipe and tobacco are laid in the
coffin, or if accustomed to spirituous drink, some liquor is often
placed there, either native palm-wine or foreign rum.

Recently, while the Rev. F. S. Myongo, a native clergyman, was visiting
on Corisco Island, be saw a mother put into a coffin a bundle of salt
for her daughter to eat in the future world.

If the deceased was a rich man, the people of his mother's side do not
allow him to be buried without their first being given a part of his
property by the people of the father's side.

If there be a suspicion that he has been killed by witchcraft, and yet
not enough proof to warrant a public charge and investigation, the
relatives take amomum seeds (cardamom), chew them, and put them into the
mouth of the dead, as a sign that the spirit shall itself execute
vengeance on the murderer, and that the survivors will take no further
steps. It is a *nolle prosequi* of a judicial case.

All being ready, the lid of the coffin is nailed down, except in the
case of a first-born only child, as has been stated.

In former days, before coffins were used, the bamboo tatta of the
bed-frame, the pandanus leaf mat, palm-fibre mosquito-net, and other
bedding were all rolled about the corpse as it lay, and were buried with
it.

While the corpse is being arranged in the coffin, the women have resumed
their wailing. The coffin is lifted by strong men and hurriedly taken to
the grave, the locality of which varies in different tribes,--sometimes
in the adjacent forest, sometimes in the kitchen-garden of plantains
immediately in the rear of the village houses, sometimes under the clay
floor of the dwelling-house. With the men who are carrying the coffin
may go some women as witnesses.

Formerly also slaves carried boxes of the dead man's goods, cloth,
hardware, crockery, and so forth, to be laid by the body, which in those
days was not interred, but was left on the top of the ground covered
with branches and leaves.

In carrying the coffin to the grave it must not be taken through the
village street but by the rear of the houses, lest the village be
"defiled." As a result of such "defilement," all sorts of difficulties
will arise, such as poor crops from the gardens and short supplies of
fish.

The coffin is laid with the face of the dead looking eastward. During
the interment people must not be moving about from place to place, but
must remain at whatever spot they were when the coffin passed, until the
burial is completed.

The digging of the grave, the carrying of the coffin, and the closing of
the grave are all done only by men. When these have finished the work of
burial, they are in great fear, and are to run rapidly to their village,
or to the nearest body of water, river or lake or sea. If in their
running one should trip and fall, it is a sign that he will soon die.
They plunge into the water as a means of "purification" from possible
defilement. The object of this purification is not simply to cleanse the
body, but to remove the presence or contact of the spirit of the dead
man or of any other spirit of possible evil influence, lest they should
have ill-luck in their fishing, hunting, and other work.

During the time of these burial and other ceremonies the women have
refrained from their mourning.

Women who have babes must not go along the route that was taken in the
carrying of the coffin, lest their children shall become sick.

When all parties have returned from the grave, the wailing is resumed.
They all mark their faces with ashes, and then begins the regular
official kwedi (mourning). During the continuance of this, pregnant
women and mothers with young children are not allowed to come near lest
evil happen to them. To prevent any possibility of the just-departed
spirit injuring any children of the village, leaves of a common weed,
kâlâkâhi, are laid on their heads.

The day after the funeral a decoction is made of the bark of a
well-known tree, bolondo. With it the doctor sprinkles the people, their
houses, their utensils and weapons, and the two entrances to the
village. During the ceremony the people are shouting an ejaculatory
prayer, "Goods! Possessions! Wealth! Do not allow confusions to come to
us!" this is distinctly a petition that the spirit should bring to them
goods or help them to obtain wealth; "Let us have food!" and many other
similar cries for good things. What remains in the vessel of the
decoction of bolondo bark after the general sprinkling is carried to the
ends of the village street, and emptied there, as a prevention against
the entry of evil spirits.

Also there is made a mixture of scrapings of bolondo, powdered red-wood,
and chalk. This is rubbed on the cheeks of the people to keep off the
evil spirits. It is rubbed also, for that same purpose, on the walls of
houses.

The cutlass (machete) and native hoe that was used in the digging of the
grave are washed with the bolondo decoction after having been left
exposed to rain over night.

Then one of the houses of the village is chosen as the ndabo ya kwedi
(house of mourning). The mourners are to sit only in that house. If they
should eat in any other house, the spirit of the dead would come and eat
with them and would make them sick. During the days of kwedi the men go
in the mornings to fish; while they are away at the work, the weeping is
intermitted lest in some way it spoil the fishing.

The bedstead in the house of mourning must be constantly occupied, even
during the daytime, by some persons sitting there, lest the spirit come
to take any vacant space; and the house itself must not, by day or
night, be without some occupant. The near relatives, when one has
occasion to go out of that house, must not go unaccompanied, lest the
spirit follow them and attempt to resume earthly companionship and thus
injure them.

If it was a great man who has died, an occasional dance is held during
the prescribed mourning time to please his spirit, which is supposed to
be walking around and observing what is done.

The kwedi formerly lasted a month, or, for a prominent person, a month
and a half.

People who while they were living were supposed to have witch power are
believed to be able to rise in an altered form from their graves. To
prevent one who is thus suspected from making trouble, survivors open
the grave, cut off the head, and throw it into the sea,-or in the
interior, where there is no great body of water, it is burned; then a
decoction of the bolondo bark is put into the grave. (The bolondo is a
poison; even a little of it may be fatal.)

When affairs are going wrong in the villages,and the people do not know
the cause, offerings of food and drink are taken to the grave to cause
the spirit to cease disturbing them, and pravers are made to it that it
may the rather bless them.

If the deceased was (a very important person, the kwedi is interrupted
on the fifth day, for the selection of his successor as chief or king.
This ceremony is called "ampenda" (glories). The successor is placed on
the vacant seat or "throne"; and songs are sung in his praise. But
first, a herald is sent to the forest, or wherever the burial was made,
to call the dead to come and dispute his right to the throne, if he be
not really dead. The herald stands and calls on the dead by name", Such
an one!" This he does slowly once, twice, thrice, until five times. He
returns, and reports to the waiting assembly, "He is really dead. I
called five times, and he did not answer." Then, this herald, standing
in the street before all the people, praises the dead for all his good
deeds, and blames for some of his bad ones. He turns to the chosen
successor sitting on the throne, and asks pardon for the candor he is
about to exercise: "To-morrow I will bow to you and take off my hat.,
but to-day I will tell the whole truth about you." Turning to the crowd,
he says, "The man who is gone was good, and be has given us this new
man. We hope that he too will be good. You all help me now to tell him
his bad points." Then, addressing the new chief, he specifies, "You have
a bad habit of so and so." And the crowd responds affirmatively, "Bad!
cease it!" After this, when the herald has ended his own list of
rebukes, any one else may call him aside and tell him of any other evil
of which be knows, and ask him to direct the new king to reform it. This
ceremony was particularly observed by the Mpongwe-speaking tribes of the
Gabun country. In the presence of the domination by foreign governments,
but little of it now exists there or in any other tribes to the north.

In the improvised songs and ejaculations of the kwedi period the
goodness and greatness of the dead are recounted. The praise is fulsome,
exaggerated, and often preposterously untrue. Some declare their
hopelessness of ever again seeing any joy. Supplications are shrieked by
others for the departed to come back and reanimate the dead body. By
most the wailing is a song in moans. Men tear their garments; women
dishevel their hair; all take off their ornaments, and disfigure their
faces with ashes or clay. The female relatives reduce their clothing to
a minimum of decency. In all tribes formerly, and in some interior
tribes still, the wives are made naked, and compelled to remain so for
months, especially if they were known not to have been as submissive as
is expected in the slavery of savage African marriage.

During my early days in the Ogowe, about 1876, a native Akele chief,
Kasa, who had been my patron at my first residence in the Ogowe,
Belambila, died after I had removed to my second station, Kangwe. I made
a ceremonious visit of respect and condolence about a month after his
death, for Kasa, though a heathen and often cruel, to me had been true
and helpful. His family appreciated the compliment of my visit. I looked
around the room, and missed his wives. I did not know that they had been
divested of all clothing. I asked for them. A man hastened to go out and
call them. I wondered somewhat at the delay in their coming. I was
afterward told that though they were accustomed to the disgrace of
nakedness before native eyes, they did not wish to meet mine, for I had
always treated them respectfully. A half-dozen of them sidled into the
room, each carrying in their hands, as their only protection, a plate,
and quickly huddled together in a corner of the room. I as quickly
dismissed them, telling them I had not known of the rule under which
they were living.

In the Batanga interior, among the Bulu-Fang tribe, where women at all
times wear scarcely any clothing, most widows are still required to go
perfectly naked, sometimes for a whole year.

All this wailing and mourning, while sincere on the part of some, is by
most simply a yielding to the contagion of sympathy. By some it is a
mere formality, and with many even a pretence.

In the older days, before Christianity had obtained any influence, or
before foreign governments had exercised power to force away barbarous
rites and compel civilized ones, when almost every death was regarded as
due to the exercise of black art, and was always followed by a
witchcraft investigation and by the putting to death of from one to ten
socalled "witches" and "wizards" (in the case of kings, fifty to one
hundred), no one, except the doctor and his secret councillors, knew on
whom suspicion for the death might fall, and all were quick to be
demonstrative in their grief, whether real or feigned, as a means of
warding off the dreaded accusation against themselves.

Though those witchcraft executions have ceased wherever foreign power
exists, the wailing is still as demonstrative, either as a sign of real
grief or as a mere custom; and the mourning after burial continued for
weeks (or even months) is an enormous evil. Wives and husbands
abandoning their duties to their own villages; children either slighted
at their own homes or idly helping to swell the confusion at the town of
mourning; men neglecting their fishing, and women neglecting their
gardens,--all these visitors are an expensive draft on the hospitality
and resources of the town of kwedi, or on their other relatives who may
happen to be living near. Inevitably there is not enough food for all,
and they stanch their hunger by immoderate drinking of foreign alcoholic
liquors.

After the first paroxysms of grief, in a few days the mourning is
reduced to a perfunctory wail by the women for a short time each morning
and evening. The remainder of the day is spent in idle talk, which
always runs into quarrels; and the nights in dances, which generally end
in dissolute revelry. A month of mourning lays up a list of assignations
and intrigues that result in trials for adultery and broken marriage
relations.

The feelings in the hearts of the mourners are very mixed. The outcry of
affection, pleading with the dead to return to life, is sincere, the
survivor desiring the return to life to be complete; but almost
simultaneous with that cry comes a fear that the dead may indeed return,
not as the accustomed embodied spirit, helpful and companionable, but as
a disembodied spirit, invisible, estranged, perhaps inimical, and
surrounded byan atmosphere of dread imparted bythe unknown and the
unseen. The many then ask, not that the departed may return, but that,
if it be hovering near, it will go away entirely.

Few were those who during the life of the departed had not on occasions
had some quarrel with him, or had done him some injustice or other
wrong, and their thought is, "His spirit will come back to avenge
itself!" So guns are fired to frighten away the spirit, and to cause it
to go off to the far world of spirits, and not take up a residence in or
near the town to haunt and injure the living.

Nevertheless, the kwedi is kept up, if for nothing else than to satisfy
the self-complacence of the dead. It is believed that the dead,
sometimes dissatisfied with the extent or character of the mourning
ceremony, have returned and inflicted some sickness on the village, for
the removal of which other cerernonies have to be performed.

Thus far acts which are dictated by natural feelings, good and
otherwise, have been dealt with; but there are a multitude of other
ceremonies, varied in different tribes and never the same in any one
tribe, which are performed under the direct influence of religious duty
as well as superstitious fear. What has been thus far described is
especially true of the Mpongwe, Benga, and Batanga tribes of western
Equatorial Africa, typical for most Bantu tribes of the continent. The
following quotations afford a comparison of the burial customs of
savages in other regions with those I have observed:

Lumholtz,\[1\] describing the burial customs of Australia, writes: "The
natives in the neighborhood of Portland Bay, in the southwestern part of
South Australia, cremate their dead by placing the corpse in a hollow
tree and setting fire to it.... The natives of Australia have this
peculiarity, in common with the savages of other countries, that they
never utter the names of the dead, lest their spirits should hear the
voices of the living and thus discover their whereabouts. There seems to
be a widespread belief in the soul's existence

\[1. Among Cannibals, pp. 278-279.\]

independently of matter. On this point Fraser relates that the Kulie
tribe (Victoria) believes that every man and animal has a muriep (ghost
or spirit) which can pass into other bodies. A person's muriep may in
his lifetime leave his body and visit other people in his dreams. After
death the muriep is supposed to appear again, to visit the grave of its
former possessor, to communicate with living persons in their dreams, to
eat remnants of food lying near the camp, and to warm itself by the
night fires. A similar belief has been observed among the blacks of
Lower Guinea. On my travels I, too, found a widespread fear of the
spirits of the dead, to which the imagination of the natives attributed
all sorts of remarkable qualities. The greater the man was on earth, the
more his departed spirit is feared.... An old warrior who has been a
strong man and therefore much respected by his tribe, is, after his
death, put on a platform made with forked sticks, cross-pieces, and a
sheet or two of bark; he is hoisted up amidst a pandemonium of noise,
howling, and wailing, besides much cutting with tomahawks, and banging
of heads with nolla-nollas. He is laid on his back with his knees up,
like the females, and the grass is cleared away from under and around.
The place is now for a long time carefully avoided, till he is quite
shrivelled, whereupon his bones are taken away and put in a tree.

"The common man is buried like a woman, only that logs are put over him,
and his bones are not removed. Young children are put bodily into the
trees.

"The fact that the natives bestow any care on the bodies of the dead is
doubtless owing to the fear of the spirits of the departed. In some
places I have seen the legs drawn and tied fast to the bodies, in order
to hinder the spirits of the dead, as it were, from getting out to
frighten the living. Women and children, whose spirits are not feared,
receive less attention and care after death.

"In several tribes it is customary to bury the body where the person was
born. I know of a case where a dying man was transported fifty miles in
order to be buried in the place of his nativity. It has even happened
that the natives have begun digging outside a white man's kitchen door,
because they wanted to bury an old man born there. In Central Queensland
I saw many burial-places on hills. Such are also said to be found in New
South Wales and in Victoria. These burial grounds have been in use for
centuries, and are considered sacred.

"In South Australia and in Victoria the bead is not buried with the
body, for the skull is preserved and used as a drinking-cup. It is a
common custom to place the dead between pieces of bark and grass on a
scaffold, where they remain till they are decayed, and then the bones
are buried in the ground.

"In the northern part of Queensland I have heard people say that the
natives have a custom of placing themselves under these scaffolds to let
the fat drop on them, and that they believe that this puts them in
possession of the strength of the dead man.

"A kind of mummy dried by the aid of fire and smoke, is also found in
Australia; male children are most frequently prepared in this manner.
The corpse is then packed into a bundle, which is carried for some time
by the mother. She has it with her constantly, and at night sleeps with
it at her side. After about six months, when nothing but the bones
remain, she buries it in the earth. Full-grown men are also sometimes
carried in this manner, particularly the bodies of great warriors."

W. H. Brown, in "On the South African Frontier," describes a burial in
Mashona-land: "When a member of the community dies, he or she, as the
case may be, is usually buried under a shelf of rock in a reclining
position, with arms folded and legs doubled up. In some districts, where
heaps of rocks are scarce, I have seen graves made in large ant-heaps.
As a rule, a small canopy or thatched roof is built over the grave, and
under this it is common to see placed, as an offering, a pot of beer and
a plate of sadza. The beer evaporates, and the ants eat the sadza; but,
to the Mashona mind, the disappearance is due to supernatural causes. At
the burial the near relatives of the deceased cry aloud. I was camping
one night near a village where a child died. The obsequies took place
next morning between dawn and sunrise. The mother cried loudly while the
ceremony was proceeding, but her wailing ceased soon after the funeral,
and there was no more noise made over it. I went into the village about
two hours later, and saw some men, women, and children quietly sitting
around the hut in which the death had taken place, and looking very
solemn. The child was about two weeks old, and the cause of death was
attributed by the Mashonas to the fact that the mother had not given
beer to her grandfather when he wanted it at his death.

"If a woman's husband dies, and she afterwards procures another, the new
man takes up his abode in the hut of the dead one, becomes owner of his
assegais and battle-axes, and assumes his name. Whether or not the
second husband is supposed to enter into possession of the spirit of the
deceased, I could not discover. Some Mashonas have told me that they
believe that the spirits of their departed relatives enter the bodies of
animals, particularly those of lions.

"At the end of the lunar month during which a death has taken place, the
surviving partner, man or woman, kills a goat, and its meat is cooked,
as well as quantities of other food, and a large amount of Kaffir beer
is brewed. The people gather from the neighboring kraals, and an
all-night feast and dance ensue.

"Monthly 'dead-relative dances,' which are called 'machae' are very
common; and if no one has been accommodating enough to die during the
month, the feast and dance may be held in honor of some one who departed
years before."

A similar dance is held in the Gabun region of West Africa, partly as a
consolatory amusement for the living, near the close of whatever
prescribed time of mourning. It is called "Ukukwe" (for the spirit), as
if for the gratification of the hovering spirit of the dead; but in many
places in that region this dance has lost all reference to or for the
dead, or even any connection with a time of mourning, and has become
simply a common amusement.

In the Bihe country of Southwest Africa,\[1\] "death is surrounded by
many strange and absurd superstitions. It is considered essential that a
man should die in his own country, if not in his own town. On the way to
Bailundu, shortly after leaving Bihe territory, I met sorne men running
at great speed, carrying a sick man tied to a pole, in order that be
might die in his own country. I tried to stop them; but they were
running, as fast as their burden would allow them, down a steep rocky
bill. By the sick man's convulsive movements I could see that be was in
great pain, perhaps in his death throes; hence the great haste. If a
Bailundu man dies in Bibe, the Bibe people have to pay the Bailundu
heavily for the shameful conduct of the Bihe demons in killing a
stranger; and vice versa.

"When a man dies at home, his body is placed on a rude table, and his
friends meet for days round the corpse, drinking, eating, shouting, and
singing, until the body begins actually to fall to pieces. Then the body
is tied in a fagot of poles and carried on men's shoulders up and down
some open space, followed by doctors and drummers. The doctors demand of
the dead man the cause of his death, whether by poison or witchcraft;
and if by the latter, who was the witch? Most of the deaths I have known
of in Negro-land were from pulmonary diseases, but all were set down to
witchcraft. The jerking of the bier to and fro, causing the men bearing
it to stumble hither and thither, is taken as the dead man's answer;
thus, as in the case of spirit-rapping at home, the reply is spelled
out. The result of this enquiry is implicitly believed in; and, if the
case demands it, the witch is drowned."

Among the Barotse of South Africa \[2\] "funerals take place at night,
and generally immediately after death, while the

\[1. Arnot, Garenganze, p. 116.

2\. Deck, Three Years in Savage Africa, pp. 74-79.\]

body is still warm. If the person, when alive, possessed the skin of an
animal, they wrap the body in it, and also in a--plain mat, and then
bury it near the hut. But death inspires them with a mortal terror, and
thus the hut of the dead man is nearly always abandoned. Anything that
has been used for the burial, such as the wood. on which the corpse was
carried, is left near the grave. It is the fashion to display great
external signs of grief, howls and cries of lamentation and the like.
Formerly the graves of chiefs were distinguished by elephant tusks
turned toward the east. All cattle belonging to the deceased are killed;
and any animal of which he was particularly fond, such as the cow whose
milk he drank, is killed first. They bury in the kraal itself those who
died in the kraal; but whenever it is possible, the dying are taken out
and laid in the fields or forest. There are two reasons for this: first,
they think that away from other people is a better chance of the invalid
making a recovery; and, secondly, wherever the person dies he must be
buried; therefore, if possible, far from their habitations. When a man
dies, visits of condolence are paid to the relatives, the visitors
bringing a calf or a head of cattle as a mark of sympathy, which is
killed and eaten as a kind of consolation. The night after the funeral
is passed in tears and cries, A few days later, the doctor comes and
makes an incision on the forehead of each of the survivors, and fills it
with medicine, in order to ward off contagion and the effect of the
sorcery which caused the death. They place on their tombs some souvenir
of the profession or vocation of the defunct; for example,-if he had
been a hunter, horns or skins; if a chairmaker, a chair; and so on. Over
the grave a sacred tree is planted. The tree is a kind of laurel called
'morata.'... A man will kill himself on the tomb of his chief; he
thinks, as he passes near by, that he hears the dead man call him and
bid him bring him water. These natives believe in transmigration of the
soul into animals; thus, the hippopotamus is believed to shelter the
spirit of a chief. Nevertheless, they do not appear very clear that the
soul can not be in two places at once; else, if a chief has become a
hippopotamus in the Zambesi, why should one slay one's self to bring
water to his tomb?"

Perhaps Declè was not aware of a widespread belief in a dual soul,
consisting of a "spirit," that, as far as known, lives forever in the
world of spirits, and a "shadow" that for an uncertain length of time
hovers around the mortal remains. Some, as already mentioned in a
previous chapter, also name a third entity, the "life,"-that which,
being "eaten" by sorcerers, causes the living being to sicken, and which
the sorcerer, if detected, can be compelled to return to its owner. Miss
Kingsley thought also she had discovered a belief in a fourth entity,
the "dream-soul." But this, though doubtless believed in as that which
sometimes leaves the sleeping body and goes on distant wanderings, is
the same as the "spirit," during whose temporary absence the body
continues its breathing and other physical motions, in virtue of the
presence of its second and third soul-entities.

The funeral practices of all the tribes, with very few exceptions, over
all Africa, however much they may and do vary, contain all of them, as
shown by the preceding quotations, a decided belief in, and fear of, the
intelligent and probably inimical activity of the spirits of their dead.
They include also the custom of the burial with the dead man of more or
less of his property, together with the destruction of such things as
cannot be conveniently placed in the grave,--clothing, crockery,
utensils, wives, slaves, trees of fruitage, etc.

Even among the civilized and enlightened, while of course there would be
no excessive destruction of property, nor murder of widow or slave, an
extravagant amount of wearing apparel is stuffed into the coffin (which
is sometimes made large for that purpose) as a sign of the importance of
the dead, and of the sacrifice the love and grief of the living are
willing to make.

The residence of the transmigrated spirit is probably not a permanent
one. The Wa-nya-mwesi of East Africa "believe in transmigration both
during life and after it. Thus, according to them, a sorcerer can
transform himself into a wild animal to injure his enemies; but in such
cases the change is not permanent, and the soul does not remain in its
new habitation."\[1\]

Leaving out of view the immense difference, caused by the absence of
Christianity, in the moral life of native Africa, as compared with that
of the United States, there is no one thing that more painfully strikes
me, in the low civilization of the former, than their customs for the
dead. It would occupy too much space to recount at length all the
reasons the natives give for their sometimes apparently heartless
ceremonies. The true explanation lies in their belief in witchcraft and
their fear of spirits.

From the testimony of travellers, burial customs are much the same all
over Africa. What I have written is my personal knowledge of what
prevails on the West Coast, in the equatorial regions, and especially in
the portion lying along the course of the Ogowe River,--a river that was
first brought to public notice through the writings of Paul Du Chaillu,
the journeys of a British trader, Mr. R.B.N. Walker, and subsequently by
the thorough explorations of Count P. S. De Brazza.

There are in Africa social distinctions of rich and poor, higher and
lower classes, just as there are, and always will be, all the world
over, the claims of communism to the contrary notwithstanding. These
distinctions follow their subjects to the grave,--just as, in our own
civilization, one is laid in the sculptured cemetery and another in the
Potter's Field.

The African burial-grounds are mostly in the forest, in the low-lying
lands and tangled thickets along the sea-beach, or the banks of rivers.
Hills and elevated building-sites are reserved for villages and
plantations. If a traveller, in journeying along the main river of the
country, observes long reaches of uncleared thickets, he will probably
be

\[1. Declè.\]

correct in suspecting that these are burial-grounds. His native crew
will be slow to inform him of the fact or to converse on the subject,
unless to object to an order to go ashore there.

Some of the interior tribes bury all their dead under the clay floors of
their houses. The living are thus actually treading and cooking their
food over the graves of their relatives.

This mode of burial is reserved as a distinction, in the case of some
coast tribes, for a very few of their honored chiefs, or for a specially
loved relative.

Over or near the graves of the rich are built little huts, where are
laid the common articles used by them in their life,--pieces of
crockery, knives, sometimes a table, mirrors, and other goods obtained
in foreign trade. Once, in ascending the Ogowe, I observed, tied to the
branches of a large tree extending over the stream from the top of the
bank, a wooden trade-chest, five pitchers and mugs, and several fathoms
of calico prints. I was informed that the grave of a lately deceased
chief was near, that these articles were signs of his wealth, and were
intended as offerings to spirits to induce them to draw to the villages
of his people the trade of passing merchant vessels.

A noticeable fact about these gifts to the spirits is that, however
great a thief a man may be, he will not steal from a grave. The coveted
mirror will lie there and waste in the rain, and the valuable garment
will flap itself to rags in the wind, but human hands will not touch
them. Sometimes the temptation to steal is removed by the donor
fracturing the article before it is laid on the grave.

Actual interment is generally given to all who in life were regarded as
at all worthy of respect. Native implements for excavating being few and
small, the making of a grave is quite a task; it is often, therefore,
made no deeper than is actually sufficient for covering the corpse.
This, according to the greatness of the dead or the wealth of the
family, is variously encased, Sometimes it is placed in a coffin made of
the ends of an old canoe; or, more shapely, of boards cut from the
canoe's bottom and sides; or, even so expensively as to use two
trade-boxes, making one long one by knocking out an end from each and
telescoping them.

Sometimes the corpse is cast out on the surface of the ground, and
perhaps a pile of stones or brushwood gathered over it. Sometimes it
lies uncovered. Sometimes they are cast into the river.

Many years ago, I was ascending the Ogowe River in my boat, painfully
toiling against the current. I had unwisely refused the wish of my crew
to stop for our mid-day meal at a desirable ulako (camping-ground), as
the hour was too early; and I determined to go on, and stop at some
other place. But I regretted presently; for, instead of finding forest
and high camping-ground, we came to a long stretch of papyrus swamp;
and, after that, to low jungle. We pulled on for another mile, the sun
growing hotter, along the unsheltered bank, and we growing faint with
hunger as the hour verged to noon. Becoming desperate, I directed the
crew to stop at the very first spot that was solid enough for foothold,
intending to eat our dry rice without fire. Presently we came to a clump
of oil-palms. Their existence showed solid ground, and I seized the
rudder and ran the boat ashore. The crew objected, hungry though they
were, that "it was not a good place "; but they did not mention why. I
jumped ashore, however, and ordered them to follow, and gather sticks
for fire. As they were rather slow in so doing, and I overheard
murmuring that "firewood is not gotten from palm trees" (which is true),
I set them an example by starting off on a search myself.

I had not gone far before I found a pile of brushwood, and, rejoicing at
my success, I called out to the crew to come and carry it. While they
were coming, I stooped down and laid hold of an eligible stick. But an
odor startled me; and the other sticks that I had dislocated falling
apart, there was revealed a human foot and shin, which, from the
ornaments still remaining about the ankle, I suppose was a woman's.

My attendants fled; and I re-embarked in the boat, sufficiently
unconscious of hunger to await it late meal that was not cooked until we
reached a comfortable village a short distance beyond. My crew then
explained their slowness to obey me at that clump of palm trees, by
saying that they knew it looked like a burying-place.

A less respectful mode of burial (if, indeed, the term be not a
misnomer) is applied to the poor, to the friendless aged who have
wearied out the patience of relatives by a long sickness, and to those
whose bodies are offensive by a leprous or otherwise ulcerous condition.
Immediately that life seems extinct (and sometimes even before) the
wasted frame is tied up in the rnat on which it is lying, and, slung
from a pole on the shoulders of two men, is flung out on the surface of
the ground in the forest, to become the prey of wild beasts and the
scavenger "driver" (Termes bellicosa) ants.

Of one tribe in the upper course of the Ogowe, I was told, who, in their
intense fear of ghosts, and their dread of the possible evil influence
of the spirits of their own dead relatives, sometimes adopt a horrible
plan for preventing their return. With a very material idea of a spirit,
they seek to disable it by beating the corpse until every bone is
broken. The mangled mass is bung in a bag at the foot of a tree in the
forest. Thus mutilated, the spirit is supposed to be unable to return to
the village, to entice into its fellowship of death any of the
survivors.

Some dead bodies are burned, particularly those of criminals. Persons
convicted on a charge of witchcraft are "criminals," and are almost
invariably killed. Sometimes they are beheaded. I have often had in my
possession the curved knives with which this operation is performed.

Sometimes torture is used: a common mode is to roast the condemned over
a slow fire, which is made under a stout bed-frame built for the
purpose. In such a case almost the entire body is reduced to ashes. When
I was clearing a piece of ground at Belambila in the Ogowe in 1875, for
the house which I afterward occupied, my workmen came on a pile of
ashes, charcoal, and charred bones, where, they assured me, a criminal
had been put to death.

A barely mentionable method of disposal of the bodies of the dead is to
eat them. That is possible only in a cannibal country. That it was
actual was known among the Gabun Fang flfty years ago, and among my
Ogowe Fang twentyfive years ago. None ate of their own dead; adjacent
towns exchanged corpses. Women were not allowed to partake. The practice
was confined to the old men. One such was pointed out to me at Talaguga
in 1882. He robbed graves for that purpose.

Among the coast tribes of the Gabun region of West Africa cremation is
not known, nor are corpses thrown out on the ground. Under the influence
of foreign example, the dead are coffined, more or less elaborately,
according to the ability of the family; and the interment is made in
graves of proper depth. In some of these tribes a locality of low, dark,
tangled forest, not suitable as site for a village or for a plantation,
is used as a public cemetery.

Among the tribes of Batanga in the German Kamerun territory, though the
people are civilized, the old unsanitary custom of burying in the
kitchen-gardens immediately in the rear of the village, and sometimes
actually in the clay floor of the dwelling itself, is still kept up,
even by the more enlightened natives. The Christians are not in numbers
sufficiently large in any family to control all the burial ceremonies of
its dead members. The strange spectacle is therefore presented of a
mixture of Christian ritual and fetich custom. In my own experience at
funerals of some children of church-members at Batanga, the singing of
hymns of faith and hope by the Christian relatives alternated with the
howling of half-naked heathen death-dancers in an adjoining house. And
when I had read the burial service to the point of beginning the march
of the procession to the grave, perhaps only a few rods distant, the
heathen remained behind; and while I was reading the "dust to dust" at
the grave-side, they would be building a quick fire of chips and dried
leaves on the exact spot where the coffin had last stood in the village
street. The ashes they would gather and incorporate into their family
fetiches, to insure fertility to the mother and other near female
relatives of the dead child.

Also, in the Gabun region, there is the remains of a custom, practised
especially by the Orungu tribe of Cape Lopez, of a pretended quarrel
between two parties of mourners on a question whether or not the burial
shall actually be made, even though there is no doubt that it will be,
and the coflin is ready to be carried. This contest concluded, a second
quarrel is raised on a question as to which of two sets of relatives,
the maternal or the paternal, shall have the right to carry it. Very
recently this actually occurred at the town of Libreville, and on the
premises of the American Presbyterian Mission, the fight being
shamefully waged by young men who formerly had been professing
Christians. They had been given permission to bury a young man in our
Protestant cemetery. The missionary in charge of the station heard a
great hubbub on the path entering the mission grounds, as if a fight was
in progress. Going to investigate, he found an angry contest was being
carried on, under the old heathen idea that the spirit of the dead must
see and be pleased by a demonstration of a professed desire to keep him
with the living, and not to allow him to be put away from them. The
contest of words had almost come to blows, and the victors had set up a
disgraceful shout as they seized the coflin to bring it to the grave.

Another custom remains in Gabun,--a pleasant one; it may once have had
fetich significance, but it has lost it now, so that Christians may
properly retain it. Just before the close of the kwedi, friends (other
than relatives) of the mourners will bring some gift, even a small one,
make a few remarks appropriate to it and to the circumstances of the
receiver, and give it to his or her mourning friend. It is called the
"ceremony of lifting up," *i.e.*, out of the literal ashes, and from the
supposed depths of grief. For instance, if the gift be a piece of soap,
the speech of donation will be, "Sit no longer in the dust with begrimed
face! Rise, and use the soap for your body!" Or if it be a piece of
cloth, "Be no longer naked! Rise, and clothe yourself with your usual
dress!" Or if it be food, "Fast no longer in your grief! Rise, and
strengthen your body with food!"

As to the status of the departed in the spirit-world, though all those
African tribes from old heathen days knew of the name of God, of His
existence, and of some of His attributes, they did not know of the true
way of escape from the evils of this present life, of any system of
reward and punishment in the future life, nor of any of the conditions
of that life. That they had a belief in a future world is evidenced by
survivors taking to the graves of their dead, as has been described in
the preceding pages, boxes of goods, native materials, foreign cloth,
food, and (formerly) even wives and servants, for use in that other life
to which they had gone. Whatever may have been supposed about the
locality or occupations of that life, the dead were confidently believed
to have carried with them all their bu man passions and feelings, and
especially their resentments. Fear of those possible resentments
dominated the living in all their attempts at spiritual communication
with the dead.

As to the locality of the latter, it was not believed that all of them
always remained in that unknown other world. They could wander invisibly
and intangibly. More than that, they could return bodily and resume this
earthly life in other forms; for belief in metempsychosis is a common
one among all these tribes. The dead, some of them, return to be born
again, either into their own family or into any other family, or even
into a beast.

Who thus return, or why they return, is entirely uncertain. Certainly
not all are thus born again. Those who in this present life had been
great or good or prominent or rich remain in the spirit-world, and
constitute the special class of spirits called "awiri" (singular,
"ombwiri").

But these awiri are at liberty to revisit the earth: if they choose,
taking a local habitation in some prominent natural object, or coming on
call to aid in ceremonies for curing the sick. Other spirits, as
explained in a previous chapter, are sinkinda, the souls of the common
dead; and ilâga, unknown spirits of other nations, or beings who have
become "angels," all of these living in "Njambi's Town."

As to Father Njambi Himself, the creator and overseer of all, both
living and dead, every kind of spirit-ombwiri, nkinda, olaga, and all
sorts of abambo-is under His control, but He does not often exercise it.
