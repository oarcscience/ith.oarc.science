# PREFACE

ON the 2d of July, 1861, I sailed from New York City on a little brig,
the "Ocean Eagle," with destination to the island of Corisco, near the
equator, on the West Coast of Africa. My first introduction to the
natives of Africa was a month later, when the vessel stopped at
Monrovia, the capital of the Liberian Republic, to land a portion of its
trade goods, and at other ports of Liberia, Sinoe, and Cape Palmas;
thence to Corisco on September 12.

Corisco is a microcosm, only five miles long by three miles wide; its
surface diversified with every variety of landscape, proportioned to its
size, of hill, prairie, stream, and lake. It is located in the eye of
the elephant-head shaped Bay of Corisco, and from twelve to twenty miles
distant from the mainland. Into the bay flow two large rivers,--the Muni
(the Rio D'Angra of commerce) and the Munda (this latter representing
the elephant's proboscis).

The island, with adjacent mainland, was inhabited by the Benga tribe. It
was the headquarters of the American Presbyterian Mission. On the voyage
I had studied the Benga dialect with my fellow-passenger, the senior
member of the Mission, Rev. James L. Mackey; and was able, on my
landing, to converse so well with the natives that they at once
enthusiastically accepted me as an interested friend. This has ever
since been my status among all other tribes.

I lived four years on the island, as preacher, teacher, and itinerant to
the adjacent mainland, south to the Gabun River and its Mpongwe tribe,
east up the Muni and Munda rivers, and north to the Benito River.

In my study of the natives' language my attention was drawn closely to
their customs; and in my inquiry into their religion I at once saw how
it was bound up in these customs. I met with other white men--traders,
government officials, and even some missionaries--whose interest in
Africa, however deep, was circumscribed by their special work for,
respectively, wealth, power, and Gospel proclamation. They could see in
those customs only "folly," and in the religion only "superstition."

I read many books on other parts of Africa, in which the same customs
and religion prevailed. I did not think it reasonable to dismiss curtly
as absurd the cherished sentiments of so large a portion of the human
race. I asked myself: Is there no logical ground for the existence of
these sentiments, no philosophy behind all these beliefs? I began to
search; and thenceforward for thirty years, wherever I travelled,
wherever I was guest to native chief, wherever I lived, I was always
leading the conversation, in hut or camp, back to a study of the native
thought.

I soon found that I gained nothing if I put my questions suddenly or
without mask. The natives generally were aware that white men despised
them and their beliefs, and they were slow to admit me to their thought
if I made a direct advance. But, by chatting as a friend, telling them
the strange and great things of my own country, and first eliciting
their trust in me and interest in my stories, they forgot their
reticence, and responded by telling me of their country. I listened, not
critically, but apparently as a believer; and then they vied with each
other in telling me all they knew and thought.

That has been the history of a thousand social chats,--in canoes by day,
in camp and but by night, and at all hours in my own house, whose public
room was open at any hour of day or evening for any visitor, petitioner,
or lounger, my attention to whose wants or wishes was rewarded by some
confidence about their habits or doings.

In 1865 I was transferred to Benito, where I remained until the close of
1871. Those years were full of travels afoot or by boat, south the
hundred miles to Gabun, north toward the Batanga region, and east up the
Benito for a hundred miles as a pioneer, to the Balengi and Boheba
tribes,--a distance at that time unprecedented, considering the almost
fierce opposition of the coast people to any white man's going to the
local sources of their trade.

After more than ten uninterrupted years in Africa, I took a furlough of
more than two years in the United States, and returned to my work in
1874.

I responded to a strong demand on the part of the supporters of Foreign
Missions in Africa, that mission operations should no longer be confined
to the coast. Unsuccessful efforts had been made to enter by the Gabun,
by the Muni, and by the Benito.

On the 10th of September, 1874, I entered the Ogowe River, at Nazareth
Bay, one of its several embouchures into the Atlantic, near Cape Lopez,
a degree south of the equator. But little was known of the Ogowe. Du
Chaillu, in his "Equatorial Africa" (1861), barely mentions it, though
he was hunting gorillas and journeying in "Ashango Land," on the sources
of the Ngunye, a large southern affluent of the Ogowe.

A French gunboat a few years before had ascended it for one hundred and
thirty miles to Lembarene, the head of the Ogowe Delta, and had attached
it to France. Two English traders and one German bad built
trading-bouses at that onehundred-and-thirty-mile limit, and traversed
the river with small steam launches in their rubber trade. Besides these
three, I was the only other white resident. They were living in the
Galwa tribe, cognate in language with the Mpongwe. I settled at a
one-hundred-and-flfty-mile limit, in the Akele tribe (cognate with the
Benga), building my house at a place called Belambila.

Two years later I abandoned that spot, came down to Lembarene, and built
on Kângwe Hill. There I learned the Mpongwe dialect. I remained there
until 1880, successful with school and church, and travelling by boat
and canoe thousands of miles in the many branches of the Ogowe, through
its Delta, and in the lake country of Lakes Onange and Azyingo. In 1880
I took a second furlough to the United States, remaining eighteen
months, and returning at the close of 1881.

My prosperous and comfortable station at Kangwe was occupied by a new
man, and I resumed my old role of pioneer. I travelled up the Ogowe, one
hundred and fifty miles beyond Lembarene, ascending and descending the
wild waters of its cataracts, and settled at Talaguga, a noted rock near
which was subsequently established the French military post, Njoli, at
the two-hundred-mile limit of the course of the river. There I was alone
with Mrs. Nassau, my nearest white neighbors the two French officers
five miles up river at .the post, and my successors at Kângwe, seventy
miles down river. The inhabitants were wild cannibal Fang, just recently
emerged from the interior forest. It was a splendid fleld for original
investigation, and I applied myself to the Fang dialect.

I remained at Talaguga, until 1891, when I took a third furlough to the
United States, and stayed through 1892, during which time the Mission
Board transferred my entire Ogowe work, with its two stations and four
churches and successful schools, to the French Paris Evangelical
Society.

In March, 1893, at the request of the Rev. Frank F. Ellinwood, D.D.,
LL.D., I wrote and read, before the American Society of Comparative
Religions, a forty-minute essay on Bantu Theology.

At the wish of that Society I loaned the manuscript to them, for their
use in the Parliament of Religions at the Chicago Exposition; but I
carried the original draft of the essay with me on my return to Africa
in August, 1893, where I was located at Libreville, Gabun, the Mission's
oldest and most civilized station. There I found special advantage for
my investigations. Though those educated Mpongwes could tell me little
that was new as to purely unadulterated native thought, they, better
than an ignorant tribe, could and did give me valuable intelligent
replies to my inquiries as to the logical connection between native
belief and act, and the essential meaning of things which I had seen and
heard elsewhere. My ignorant friends at other places had given me a mass
of isolated statements. My Mpongwe friends had studied a little grammar,
and were somewhat trained to analyze. They helped me in the collocation
of the statements and in the deduction of the philosophy behind them. It
was there that I began to put my conclusions in writing.

In 1895 Miss Mary H. Kingsley journeyed in West Africa, sent on a
special mission to investigate the subject of freshwater fishes. She
also gratified her own personal interest in native African religious
beliefs by close inquiries all along the coast.

During her stay at Libreville in the Kongo-Frangais, May-September,
1895, my interest, common with hers, in the study of native African
thought led me into frequent and intimate conversations with her on that
subject. She eagerly accepted what information, from my longer residence
in Africa, I was able to impart. I loaned her the essay, with permission
to make any use of it she desired in her proposed book, "Travels in West
Africa." When that graphic story of her African wanderings appeared in
1897, she made courteous acknowledgment of the use she had made of it in
her chapters on Fetich.

On page 395 of her "Travels in West Africa," referring to my missionary
works, and to some contributions I had made to science, she wrote:
"Still I deeply regret he has not done more for science and geography. .
. . I beg to state I am not grumbling at him . . . but entirely from the
justifiable irritation a student of fetich feels at knowing that there
is but one copy of this collection of materials, and that this copy is
in the form of a human being, and will disappear with him before it is
half learned by us, who cannot do the things he has done."

This suggestion of Miss Kingsley's gave me no new thought; it only
sharpened a desire I had hopelessly cherished for some years. In my many
missionary occupations--translation of the Scriptures, and other
duties--I had never found the strength, when the special missionary
daily work was done, to sit down and put into writing the mass of
material I had collected as to the meaning and uses of fetiches. Nor did
I think it right for me to take time that was paid for by the church in
which to compile a book that would be my own personal pleasure and
property.

Impressed with this idea, on my fourth furlough to America in 1899, I
confided my wish to a few personal friends, telling them of my plan, not
indeed ever to give up my life-work in and for Africa, but to resign
from connection with the Board; and, returning to Africa under
independent employ and freed from mission control, but still working
under my Presbytery, have time to gratify my pen.

One of these friends was William Libbey, D. Sc., Professor of Physical
Geography and Director of the E. M. Museum of Geology and Archaeology in
Princeton University. Without my knowledge he subsequently mentioned the
subject to his university friend, Rev. A. Woodruff Halsey, D.D., one of
the Secretaries of the Board of Foreign Missions. Dr. Halsey thought my
wish could be gratified without my resigning from the Board's service.

In November, 1899, the following action of the Board was forwarded to
me: "November 20th, 1899. In view of the wide and varied information
possessed by the Rev. Robert H. Nassau, D.D., of the West Africa
Mission, regarding the customs and traditions of the tribes on the West
Coast, and the importance of putting that knowledge into some permanent
form, the Board requested Dr. Nassau to prepare a volume or volumes on
the subject; and it directed the West Africa Mission to assign him, on
his return from his furlough, to such forms of missionary work as will
give him the necessary leisure and opportunity."

On my return to Africa in 1900, I was located at Batanga, one hundred
and seventy miles north of Gabun, and was assigned to the pastorate of
the Batanga Church, the largest of the twelve churches of the Corisco
Presbytery, with itineration to and charge of the sessions of the Kribi
and Ubenji churches.

During intervals of time in the discharge of these pastoral duties my
recreation was the writing and sifting of the multitude of notes I had
collected on native superstition during the previous quarter of a
century. The people of Batanga, though largely emancipated from the
fetich practices of superstition, still believed in its witchcraft
aspect. I began there to arrange the manuscript of this work. There,
more than elsewhere, the natives seemed willing to tell me tales of
their folk-lore, involving fetich beliefs. From them, and also from
Mpongwe informants, were gathered largely the contents of Chapters XVI
and XVII.

And now, on this my fifth furlough, the essay on Bantu Theology has
grown to the proportions of this present volume.

The conclusions contained in all these chapters are based on my own
observations and investigations.

Obligation is acknowledged to a number of writers on Africa and others,
quotations from whose books are credited in the body of this work. I
quote them, not as informants of something I did not already know, but
as witnesses to the fact of the universality of the same superstitious
ideas all over Africa.

By the courtesy of the American Geographical Society, Chapters IV, V, X,
and XI have appeared in its Bulletin during the years 1901-1903.

1 am especially obligated to Professor Libbey for his sympathetic
encouragement during the writing of my manuscript, and for his judicious
sug estions as to the final form I have given it.
