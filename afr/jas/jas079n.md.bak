*NOTE:* 

### 79. Juggin Straw Blue.

The story is confused in the telling. It has three parts. (1) A
water-being helps a girl who is abused by her aunt and sent to fetch
water with too heavy a jug. (2) The water-being pursues and carries off
the girl, though she is locked in an iron chest. (3) The girl's lover
comes to her rescue and defeats the monster. See the next number and
perhaps 99.
