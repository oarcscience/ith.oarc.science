# INDEX TO INFORMANTS.

1\.

*Alexander*, Emily, aged 15. She came to my room in the evening after
her work was done at the hotel and recited to me more than twenty
stories which she had from her father, who was a native of Mandeville,

people employed at the hotel.

See 108, 109, 110, 111, 130.

friends of the colored housekeeper at Harmony Hall.

6\.

*Barrett*, George, aged 60 or over. He visited me at Harmony Hall with a
group of men from Maroon Town. They would spend a whole morning or even
all day telling stories in this way, first one and then another taking
his turn and each making way for the other with a fine sense of fair
play.

See 57b (2), 76a, 84a.

7\.

*Brown*, Arthur, aged 23. He was a friend of the chauffeur for the hotel

two stories in turn.

*Falconer*, Simeon, aged 47. He was an intelligent and resourceful man,
a church member but nevertheless a frequenter of wakes, where he learned
his stories. He dictated his stories to me at his home, without
audience, and on various visits. His little sitting-room held a mahogany
table set against the wall, at each end two mahogany chairs, in which we
sat, and a curiously carved chair which a friend had brought him from
Africa.

Bethlehem, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, an old-time woman and quite
illiterate.

*Forbes*, William, over 75. He came from Dry River and was one of my
best story-tellers. He had been song-leader and "Tea-meeting chairman"
for his district and was much respected for his intelligence and sense
of order. He came at several different times and sang or told stories
with equal case and with a freshness and delight which was contagious,
never failing to bring a small gift from his garden and never arguing
over the pay. He had a very long-shaped head and beaming eyes.

See 2a, 3, 7, 8, 11b, 24, 25b, 46, 70, 85c, 86a, 101, 140, 141, 142.

loose-jointed. It was in the evening after work at Moneague and he stood
in the middle of the group and acted out the story he was telling in
rapid, unintelligible dialect, and with excellent mimicry of both speech
and gesture. Afterward he recited it to me more slowly, possibly more in
detail.

38\.

*Pottinger*, Henry, over 70. We were gathered one evening in his son's
cottage near Claremont for story-telling when the old man made his

{p. 294}

of formal prelude to the occasion, but I could not get the words.
