### 39. Anansi, White-belly and Fish.

Mrs. Ramtalli, Maggotty.

Anansi is accustomed to lie in the sun every morning watching the birds
going to feed. One day he said to White-belly, "Brar White-belly, whe'
you go to feed eb'ry day? tek me wid you." So White-belly promised on
condition that he would behave himself. He fitted him out with a pair of
wings to fly, and they went to the feeding-trees. These overhung a
river. Every tree White-belly went on, Anansi said, "A fe me tree dat!"
and White-belly went away to another. Anansi eat so much that he fell
fast asleep. White-belly got annoyed. When Anansi was sleeping, he went
and took off the false wings. Anansi turned in his sleep and fell into
the river.

The Fish picked him up and took him to their home. He said, "Cousin
Fish, no eat me!"--"If we are 'cousin' we wi' see!" Fish boiled some hot
rice-pop. Anansi said, "It no hot enough! putee in the sun mekee hot
more!" When he thought is was quite cooled off, put it to his head,
never stopped drinking until it was finished. Then Fish say, "Yes, me
cousin fe trew!"

It was getting night and Fish told him to remain over until next day.
Fish had a barrel of eggs in the kitchen. Anansi wanted to eat them off,
asked Fish to make his bed in the kitchen for the night. He poached all
the eggs in the ashes, left one, and they went 'pop!' The pickney say,
"A wha' stranger man a do deh?" The Fish mother said, "Have manners,
pickney! Let you cousin prosper." Morning dawn, the mother sent the
children to bring the eggs to her to count them. Anansi said, "Mek the
child'ren keep quiet; me wi' work!" and he took the one egg, took it to
the mother Fish. Each time she marked it he would wipe it off, take back
the same egg, until he had taken the whole barrel full.

After that, he said he wanted to go. Fish said to two of the children,
"Me son, get the canoe an' tek you cousin over the river." It was
looking very breezy and rainy. When they got half way across, Fish
bawled out at the top of her voice, "Bring stranger man back he-e-ah! fe
he eat off all me eggs; only one is heah!" The children say, "Wha' ma
say?" Anansi said, "You ma say you mus' row quickly, squall ahead!" The
children rowed across. Anansi took them up, put them in his bag and took
them home, eat them. And from that day, fishes are eaten!
