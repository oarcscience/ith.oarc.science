*NOTE:* 

### 21. Anansi and the Tar Baby.

For the distribution of the Tar-baby story in negro folk-lore and its
relation to negro practices compare: Boas, JAFL 25:247-250; Tremearne,
20--24; Parsons, Andros Island, 12-13; Sea Islands, 26-29. For Spanish
see Espinosa (Cuentos populares españoles, Stanford University 1923,
Vol. 1, p. 80.)

Version (a). Of all the devices to catch a thief, the tar-baby story is
by far the most popular in Jamaica. Despite its conformity to negro
practices, the uniformity of style in which the story is treated shows
that it is not here developed upon a naturalistic basis. On the other
hand, the trick of the escape into the habitat does not often occur in
Jamaica, perhaps because it is more amusing when coupled with the figure
of Rabbit, as in 59 a. For other instances of the fire-test see notes to
number 9.

Version (b). Jamaica thief stories lay emphasis upon the unexpectedness
of the thief's identity. In version (a) and in number 50, it is the
watchman himself who is robbing the garden. In (b) it is the intimate
friend. In (c) it is the father of the family. Pains are taken,
moreover, to divert suspicion. In number 20, Anansi establishes an alibi
by playing all night at a dance while his gang rob the field; in Junod,
102, Rabbit makes his companion put him under a mortar at night and
fasten his feet, then wriggles out of the trap and returns to it again.
The device in version(b) seems to be native to Jamaica.

{p. 245}

The escape by means of a substitute is more dramatically handled than in
Mrs. Parsons's Bahama versions, 15-16, but as Goat is generally a wary
animal in Jamaica stories, the ending must be derived from the "Boukee
and Rabby" cycle of the Bahama and Louisiana equivalents. For the
substitute theme, compare numbers 2, 4, 5b, 10b, 58.

Version (c). Compare: Bleek, 80-82; Cronise and Ward, 101-111; Barker,
69-72, For the detection of the father by the son, see
Cunnie-more-than-father, number 23.
