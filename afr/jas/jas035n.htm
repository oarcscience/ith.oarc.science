<P>The story of Tumble-bug's revenge is even more common than the last number. In Wona, 51-55, Tumble-bug is carrying butter and Anansi only lard. Anansi proposes that they put their loads together, sees that Tumble-bug's is at the bottom, and makes the ruling in order that he may get the butter and Tumble-bug the lard. Compare number 46 and the opening episode of the last number.</P>
<P>The revenge story is recent. In Wona, Tumble-bug suffers further at Anansi's hands.</P>
<P>In Tremearne, FL 21:213-214, Tortoise and Spider have a bull in common; Tortoise eats the liver and Spider claims in compensation the whole bull. Tortoise pretends dead and frightens Spider, who thinks it is a spirit and gives him everything.</P>
