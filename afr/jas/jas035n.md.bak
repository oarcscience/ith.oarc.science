*NOTE:* 

### 35. Tumble-bug and Anansi.

The story of Tumble-bug's revenge is even more common than the last
number. In Wona, 51-55, Tumble-bug is carrying butter and Anansi only
lard. Anansi proposes that they put their loads together, sees that
Tumble-bug's is at the bottom, and makes the ruling in order that he may
get the butter and Tumble-bug the lard. Compare number 46 and the
opening episode of the last number.

The revenge story is recent. In Wona, Tumble-bug suffers further at
Anansi's hands.

In Tremearne, FL 21:213-214, Tortoise and Spider have a bull in common;
Tortoise eats the liver and Spider claims in compensation the whole
bull. Tortoise pretends dead and frightens Spider, who thinks it is a
spirit and gives him everything.
