### 69. Grandy-Do-an'-Do.

a\. Moses Hendricks, Mandeville.

There was an old woman, a witch, but she was very wealthy. She lived
quite to herself. Plenty of stock-horses, cows, sheep, mules, each kind
kept by itself in a separate pasture. The old lady's name was Grandy
Beard-o, but nobody knew that name. She wanted a person to sup with her.
She came across a little girl one day. The took that girl home. After
she prepared her meal, she called the girl and asked her if she knew her
name. The girl said, "No, ma'am." She said to the girl, "Unless you tell
me my name, I will not give you anything to eat."

She started out the girl to go and fetch some water. The girl had to go
through all the pastures to get where the water was--mules to
themselves, cows to themselves, horses to themselves, sheep to
themselves. She went along crying, being hungry. So she got into
cow-pasture--that was first pasture. The cow said to her, "What's the
matter with you, me baby?"

The girl said, "The old lady will not give me anything to eat except me
can tell her her name!" Cow was afraid to tell her.

From there she went into mule pasture, crying all the same. Mule said,
"What's the matter, me baby?"

The girl said, "The old lady will not give me anything to eat, except me
can tell her her name!" Mule wouldn't tell her.

She got into horse pasture, crying all the way. Horse said, "What's the
matter, me baby?'

"Old lady in there won't give me anything to eat except me can tell
her her name!" Horse wouldn't tell her.

From there she went into bull pasture, still crying. Bull said, "What's
the matter, me baby?"

"Old lady won't give me anything to eat except me can tell her her
name!"

Bull says, "Cho! when you go home, tell her her name Grandy Beard-o."
Bull was a mighty man; he didn't care!

The girl was so glad, hastened home so as to get something to eat. Old
lady said, "You can tell me my name make me give you something to eat?"

The girl said, "Your name Grandy Beard-o, ma'am."

Old lady got so indignant! She gave the girl a good feed and after that
she started to find who told the girl, Went into cow pasture.

"You cow, you cow, you cow,  
Why you tell the girl  
Me name Grand Beard-o?"

{p. 78}

Cow said,

"A ring ding ding, mamma, ring ding ding;  
A ring ding ding, mamma, ring ding ding;  
No

*me* tell."

She jump into horse pasture now.--

"You also horse tell the girl  
Me name Grandy Beard-o?"

Horse said,

"A ring ding ding, mamma, ring ding ding;  
A ring ding ding, mamma, ring ding ding;  
No

*me* tell him."

She got into bull pasture now.--

"You bull, you bull, you bull,  
Why you tell the girl  
Me name Grandy Beard-o?"

Bull said,

"A ring ding ding, mamma, ring ding ding;  
A ring ding, ding, mamma, ring ding ding;  
Damme, me tell 'm!"

The old lady gripped the bull and tossed him in the air. The bull
dropped; nothing happened. The bull tossed her in the air now, and she
dropped; one leg broken, She tossed the bull again; the bull came down
unhurt. The bull tossed her up again; she came down, another leg was
broken.

She tossed the bull; nothing happened. The bull tossed her; she came
down, one arm broken. She tossed the bull again; the bull came down
unhurt. The bull tossed her again; she came down, the other arm was
broken.

She tossed the bull again; the bull came down unhurt. The last toss the
bull made, her neck broke. That was the end of her. The girl became
mistress of all she possessed, and that is why the land goes from hand
to hand in legacy up to to-day.
