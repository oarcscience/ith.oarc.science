### 95. The Dumb Child.

George Parkes, Mandeville.

There was once a little child born into a country, born with golden
tongue an' golden teet', an' from de day she born, nobody

{p 122}

see de teet' excep' de mother an' de father; she never talk for no one
to hear her nor to see neither the teeth nor the tongue. Now the king of
the country hear of it, an' he offer a gran' reward for anyone who would
get to make the chil' talk, because he, the king, never seen a golden
tongue an' teet' yet. So lot of men went to the house an' try all sort
of mechanic; the chil' wouldn't talk.

So Anansi heard off it, went to the king an' tol' the king that he would
make the chil' talk; an' the king say if Anansi make the chil' talk
before him, he will make the reward much larger, but if he don't make
the chil' talk before him, he, the king, will kill Anansi. So Anansi
went away, got his fiddle, cord it up, an' went to the place of the
little chil'; an' he played on his fiddle to make the chil' hear,--

Poly don ya sin do,  
Poly don ya sin do,  
Poly don ya sin do,  
Merry day t'-day ya,  
Merry day t'-day ya,  
    Sin do, sin do-o!"

The chil' look upon Anansi an' smile; Anansi shake his head. He play the
tune again--

"Poly don ya sin do,  
Poly don ya sin do."

The chil' laugh; Anansi get to see de teet'. Now Anansi play stronger
again de same t'ing,--

"Poly don ya sin do,  
Poly don ya sin do."

The chil' begin hum it now,--

"Poly don ya sin do,  
Poly don ya sin do."

Anansi play again harder now,

"Poly don ya sin do,  
Poly don ya sin do,  
Poly don ya sin do,  
Merry day t'-day ya,  
Merry day t'-day ya,  
Sin do, sin do-o!"

The chil' make,

"Poly don ya sin do,  
Merry day t'-day ya."

Anansi shake de head an' laugh an' he play much stronger now,

"Poly don ya sin do,  
Poly don ya sin do."

{p. 123}

The chil' now sing louder,

"Poly don ya sin do!  
Poly don ya sin do!"

As the chil' sing that time, Anansi pick up the chil', run right away to
the king palace, call for the king, put the chil' in the chair, tol' the
king he make the chil' sing, see tongue an' teet'. The king wouldn't
believe him. Anansi play him fiddle before the king, play the same
tune,--

"Poly don ya sin do,  
Poly don ya sin do,  
Poly don ya sin do,  
Merry day t'-day ya,  
Merry day t'-day ya,  
Merry day t'-day ya,  
    Sin do, sin do-o!

Chil' begin now,

"Poly don ya sin do,  
Merry day t'-day ya!"

And the king was very glad, an' Anansi was nicely rewarded and the king
took the child in his own home, an' dere she live wid de king forever.
