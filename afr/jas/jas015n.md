*NOTE:* 

### 15. Long Shirt.

Hendrick's version of this good story is the only one I heard in
Jamaica. It has a European coloring in the speaking garment, which
resembles the English versions of Jack and the Bean-stalk. The setting
of the dance resembles number 4, but in this story the dance plays no
motivating part. For the horn as stump see Aesop, Phaedrus 2:8. The
conclusion is no doubt a turn of Hendrick's own, as he was fond of
explanatory endings and got one in whenever he could.
