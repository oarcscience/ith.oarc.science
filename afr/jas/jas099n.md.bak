*NOTE:* 

### 99. The Water Cray fish.

In Jacottet, 166-174, Mosimoli has been killed by her stepmother for
cooking and eating taboo food. When her step-sister comes to the water
to fill her pitcher, Mosimoli comes out of the water, beats her and
gives her muddy water to drink, singing, "My father and mother are the
crocodile." Compare 79, 80, of this collection and Parsons, Andros
Island, 140. The story is a mere fragment, but belongs to the very great
number of tales which turn upon a broken taboo driving a supernatural
visitor back to its original abode. The success of the story doubtless
depends upon the song interest.
