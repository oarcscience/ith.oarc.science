*NOTE:* 

### 28. Brother Dead and the Brindle Puppy.

The second story of "Brother Dead" is mixed up with obeah beliefs and it
is hard to tell where the pattern ends and improvisation begins. Brother
Dead, like the sorcerer, evidently sends a shadow in the shape of a
brindled pup to pursue and catch Anansi. The song, meanwhile, plays a
part in the conjuring. Words and tune are African. The old Maroon who
gave me the trap-setting picture of "Brar Dead" quoted in the note to
the last number, concluded as follows:

"When he (Dead) ketch to a cross-path, tek him lance an' see one little
maugre dog into a hole an' dig him out an' say to de puppy, 'Ai! Brar,
fo' kitty a shall man bra!' If he had caught Anansi, he would kill
Anansi"

I was unable to get an explanation of the sorcerer's phrase.

Compare, for the guardian dog, the story of Sarah Wintun by Lewis, 291,
and see number 72. Jamaica sorcerers send a helping spirit in animal
form to work their revenge.
