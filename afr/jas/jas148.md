### 148. Wooden Ping-ping and Cock.

Matilda Hall, Harmony Hall, Cock-pit country.

Wooden Ping-ping (there's a worm in the dirt name so) and Cock. So then
Wooden Ping-ping hid in the earth and the Cock hunted for him, couldn't
find him. Wooden Ping-ping said (fine falsetto voice, rising
inflection),

"Clay den, clay den, see me, ah?  
Clay den, clay den, see me, ah?"

Cock answered,

Na pullee theng theng,  
Na pullee theng theng!"

They kept on singing, this in the earth, that outside; but Cock couldn't
find him.
