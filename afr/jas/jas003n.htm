<P>The story is very common in Jamaica and presents no local variations from the form familiar in America. In Parkes's version, the "two misses" become two "post-mistresses". In a version by Knight, a school-master in the Santa Cruz mountains, Tacoomah is the horse and the story ends, "From that day the saddle fasten on Brer Tacoomah's back." Knight explained that "Brer Tacoomah is a large spider with yellow spots and a broad back shaped like a saddle," and that the story was told to explain this characteristic.</P>
<P>Other Jamaica versions are found in Milne-Home, 51-63; Pamela Smith, 17; and Wona, 19-23. In Wona's version, the story is made to explain "why gungo-peas are always covered with Tacoomahs," a species of spider.</P>
<P>Compare Parsons, Andros Island, 30 and note; Sea Islands, 53; for comparative references.</P>
<P>Tremearne, FL 21: 205, and Tailed-Head-Hunters, 322, tells a Hausa story of a Hyena who has stolen a holy man's horse. Spider offers to bring the Hyena to him in its place, and persuades Hyena, under pretence of taking him to a dead animal, to be saddled and bridled and ridden by Spider to the holy man, who then mounts Hyena and completes his journey.</P>
<P>In Ellis, Yoruba 265, Tortoise rides Elephant into town to sustain an idle boast,</P>
<P>In Smith's Brazil version, the little animal is tied on for safety, and takes care to slip into a hole when he finally dismounts.</P>
<P>In Ernst, VBGAEU 20:277 (Venezuela), Rabbit rides Tiger across a river. The story is coupled here with the murder in midstream.</P>
