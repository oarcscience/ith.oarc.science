*NOTE:* 

### 19. Dog and Dog-head.

This story is told everywhere in Jamaica, but I find no African version
and Mrs. Parsons says (JAFL 32:391) that, although she heard it "over
and over again" in South Carolina, it was altogether unknown in North
Carolina; see Sea Islands, 1-5. Such a distribution argues a fairly
modern origin for the complete form of the story.

The story has two parts. (1) Two friends, who have, one a dog and the
other a dog-head, go hunting, and the owner of the dog-head claims the
spoils for his own. (2) His companion, who dares not dispute him,
recovers the spoils by pretending that the owner is come to punish the
theft.

{p. 244}

An introduction sometimes tells how the friends come by the dog and
dog-head. Each gets a present of a dog, but one is so greedy that he
eats his down, beginning at the tail, until only the head is left. When
his friend jeers at him, he makes a bet that his dog-head will catch the
prey. The business of deciding at which end to begin to eat the dog is
used as a humorous episode detached from the rest of the story, the
victim sometimes escaping in the meantime.

The trick of claiming the cow as the prey of the dog-head may be related
to such stories as that of Basset 2:88, in which the man lays the
new-born calf beside his own bull and declares that the bull has
mothered it.

For the revenge, compare Rivière, 11; Harris, Nights, 131-132.
