*NOTE:* 

### 72. The Barking Puppy.

On the whole, the bird is a friendly spirit, the dog an unfriendly in
African story. Here, as in number 28, the dog takes the place of the
warning bird. The idea seems to be here that the dog, by calling his
master's name, invokes his spirit.

{p. 266}

Compare Junod, 93; Parsons, Andros Island, 165; and "The Hobyahs" in
Jacobs, More English Fairy Tales, 127.

In Junod, Dove warns Hippopotamus against Rabbit; Rabbit kills Dove. The
feathers give warning; Rabbit burns all the feathers but one and mixes
them with dirt; then the one feather gives warning,

In Chatelain, 129, a dog warns of a murder. See note to number 73.

In Callaway, 52, a witch's flesh is ground to powder and thrown into the
water in order that it may not come back to life
