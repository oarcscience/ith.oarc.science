*NOTE:* 

### 107. Uncle Green and Jack.

See Bolte u. Polívka 2:1-18. The story is composed of three episodes.
(1) A nephew sells to his miserly uncle a means for making pots
self-cooking. (2) In revenge, he is put into a bag to be thrown into the
sea; exchanges places with a shepherd and gets his sheep, (3) then
pretends to his uncle to have got them under-seas and persuades him to
try the same means of enriching himself. The first is a modification of
the self-cooking vessel, which is episode C in Bolte u. Polívka's
analysis.

Compare Clouston, Popular Tales 2:243, 263, for Norse (Dasent) and
Italian (Crane) parallels; Espinosa, Pedro de Ordimales cycle, JAFL
27:169, and discussion, 220-221.

The second and third are episodes H and J in Bolte u. Polívka. See
numbers 23 and 108 in this collection.
