*NOTE:* 

### 54. Why Crab is afraid after Dark.

The story represents a very wide-spread folk motive--that of a weak
being who appeals to some deity for more power, but whose request is
proved to be either needless or disastrous.

In Tremearne, FL 21:360, an old woman is to teach Spider cunning. She
sends him for a bottle of lion's tears, an elephant's tusk, a dog's
skin. Spider secures them all, and escapes her when she tries to kill
him. She says, "If I taught you more cunning, you would destroy
everybody." This story is popular in Sea Islands, according to Dr.
Parsons, JAFL 32:404, and Sea Islands, 14-19. Compare Bundy, JAFL
32:416-417, and note, page 416.

In Tremearne, 270-271, Snake promises Scorpion a poison that will kill a
man at once. Scorpion accidentally bites Snake, and she refuses the
poison lest he kill everybody.

In Fortier, 13-19, the Devil gives the little Earthworm his wish: "I
want to become big big and beat everybody who will come to trouble and
bother me. Give me only that and I shall be satisfied." The consequences
are disastrous for the earth-worm.

In Folk-tales of the Malagasy, FLJ 1:238-239, "the little Pound Boy"
smokes out God's children and so wins his desire,

In Ralston, 1-20, Sukra grants all an ambitious king's wishes until he
finally wishes to push Sukra himself off his seat, See Grimm, 19, The
Fisherman's Wife, Bolte u. Polívka 1:138-148.

Compare the Panchatantra story quoted by Ralston, introduction to
Tibetan Tales, Liii, Of the weaver who asks for two pairs of arms and
two heads in order to work faster, but is pelted by his terrified
neighbors for his pains.
