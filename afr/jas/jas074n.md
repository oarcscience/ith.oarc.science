*NOTE:* 

### 74. Two Sisters.

Jamaica versions of this popular story appear in Milne-Home, 70-72;
Jekyll, 14-16; Trowbridge, JAFL 9:283-284. Parsons Andros Island,
150-152, has equivalent versions.

The False Bride motive is very common in African story. Compare
Callaway, 105-130; 303-316; Theal, 56-66; 144-117; 151-154; Jacottet,
90-99; Torrend, 66-68; Dayrell, 126.

In number 101, the true bride comes at night and sings and is detected
through the words of her song. In this story, she comes at night to
suckle her child; see the Child ballad version noted

{p. 267}

by Parsons, and Bolte u. Polívka 1:76-96, on Grimm 11, Brother and
Sister. In Theal, 55-66, the drowned woman comes at night to suckle her
child, is watched, and a net set to catch her, In Theal, 144-147, the
snare and the milk are set for the false instead of for the true bride
as a test of her witch nature because no witch's tail can escape the
attraction of milk. This is like the old fable of the cat who became a
lady, but betrayed her origin when a mouse ran across the floor.
