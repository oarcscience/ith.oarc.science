call the name at all make no one hear it. So she offered a hundred pound
to anyone who could tell the girl name. Anansi say he mus' get that
money. Now he went an' mak a bargain with Mosquito that Mosquito mus' go
in the girl room, as he's a small man an' can go thru crevices, an' he,
Anansi will go underneath the mother room. In the night while the girl
was sleeping, Mosquito went an' sing at her ear; an' the girl then knock
her han' up on Mosquito an' say, "Go 'way!" At that time the mother stop
into her room an' hear. After a little time, Mosquito went back to the
girl ear an' sing again. The girl knock after him an' say, "

*Go 'way!*" again. Anansi underneath the mother's room give a clear
listening. A little time after, Mosquito went back to the girl an' sing
at her ear. She then knock after him again an' say,

Zegrady, what's the matter?" The daughter said, "It is something
