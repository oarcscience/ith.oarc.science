<CENTER><I>NOTE:</I>&nbsp;</CENTER><H3 ALIGN="CENTER">9. The Christening.</H3>
<P>The Jamaica version of this wide-spread tale (Grimm 3, discussed in Bolte u. Pol&iacute;vka, 1:9-13), has no local peculiarities. Compare Parsons, Sea Islands, 5-9 and references; also Frobenius 3:13-16.</P>
<P>It consists of two parts. (1) A rascal excuses himself three times for leaving his companion, on the plea of a summons to a christening, in order to rob a tub of butter which the two hold in common. (2) By smearing the innocent companion with the butter, he makes him appear the guilty one.</P>
<P>The first part is the distinguishing feature of the tale. A stolen food-supply is one of the commonest episodes in negro trickster stories and common tests to detect the thief occur:--(a) Taking a purge to detect stolen food as in Dennett, 92. (b) Jumping over a fire, as in Harris, Uncle Remus, 84; Nights, 253-254; JAFL 30: 193; 32: 394; and numbers 21 a and 36. (See Bolte u. Pol&iacute;vka 1:39). (c) Jumping over, or walking, a string, as in Theal, 115; Junod, 105; Boas and Simango JAFL 35:193; Compare also Monk Lewis's story of the test in crossing a river, 253-254, illustrated in number 80.</P>
<P>The trick to "incriminate another fellow" is, regularly, to smear the innocent victim with food while he sleeps. Compare: Bleek, 18; Callaway, 169; Theal, 93-97; Junod, 102; Dayrell, 53-54; Harris, Uncle Remus, 83; Parsons, Sea Islands, 8-14; also, Haida Indians, Swanton 113 (Bur. of Am. Ethn. Bull. 29).</P>
<P>The blood-smearing of the innocent victim in Leopard's Marriage Journey, Nassau, 85-95, is a particular instance of the same motive. The sheep-skin suit and the song in the mouth of the unsuspecting victim, serve as witty substitutes for this common device for the incriminating of an innocent person by the guilty.</P>
<P>In Arcin, 473, the common food-supply is stored in a granary of which Rabbit steals the key, eats the food, and scatters the remains in the house of the guardian Hyena.</P>
