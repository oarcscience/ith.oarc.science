*NOTE:* 

### 97. Leap, Timber, Leap.

An old man over eighty who was present at the recital of this story
remembered hearing it when he was a little boy. Hauling lumber was in
old days accompanied by song. The story turns upon a theme common in
American Indian hero cycles, that of a trickster's claim to magical
powers which he does not possess.
