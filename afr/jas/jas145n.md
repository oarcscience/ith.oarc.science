*NOTE:* 

### 145. Fowl and Pretty Poll.

Literally this means, Fowl wants to be married to Parrot in church, but
Parrot has no good clothes. Parrot wants Crow to marry her in church,
but he says he can't because of his peelhead (or perhaps he wants to in
spite of this peelhead). Compare the witticism vi.
