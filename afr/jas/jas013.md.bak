it in his basket alive. Rat t'ot Anansi kill it, an' he tak up his now

second one,--didn't kill it, put it in his basket. Pat took up the other

Anansi knew exactly which way Tiger would walk coming home. They met
Tiger. Said, "Brer Tiger, I see yo' baby them Crying hungry, I tak them

nurse them. Anansi took out one alive. Rat took out one dead, got

took out his dead. Tiger got into a temper an' made a spring at Rat to
catch him. Rat was running. The track was along the side of a wall.
Anansi call, "Brer Pat, 'member stone-hole!" Tiger say, "What you say,
Brer Nansi?" Anansi say, "Tell you mus' min', him go into dat stone-hole
