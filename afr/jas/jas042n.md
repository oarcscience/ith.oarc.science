*NOTE:* 

### 42. Fire and Anansi.

A less witty version of this popular Jamaica story occurs in Jekyll,
129-131.

In Dayrell, 64-65, Sun and Water are great friends. Sun visits Water,
but Water never visits Sun. At length, Sun invites Water and builds a
great compound to receive him and his friends. All come, take
possession, and crowd Sun and his wife, Moon, out into the sky.
