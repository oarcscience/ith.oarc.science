------------------------------------------------------------------------

*NOTE:* 

### 80. The Witch and the Grain of Peas.

There are two parts to this story. (1) The witch step-mother discovers
that the girl has eaten food in her house and threatens to drown her.
(2) The lover comes to rescue her and fights the step-mother.

\(1\) Compare Jacottet, 166-175, and Lewis, 253-255.

\(2\) For the fight, compare numbers 69, 79, 88, 89, 90. For the fight
with eggs see number 79 and compare Fortier, 11-13. Eggs are used as
propitiatory offerings to a water monster, as in Dayrell, 130, and are
among the most useful objects employed for conjuring. In Zeltner, 1-6,
eggs are used for magical purposes in the fight with a witch, but arrows
serve as the actual weapons.
