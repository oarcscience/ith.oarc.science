*NOTE:* 

### 4. Tiger's Sheep-skin Suit.

Parkes heard this story in St. Ann Parish. Wona, 62-67, tells how Anansi
steals Monkey's clothes and passes the theft off on "Bone."

Compare: Tremearne, FL 21:352; Harris, Nights; 68-74; Parsons, Sea
Islands, 145: JAFL 32:366.

The common theme of teaching to an unsuspecting comrade an incriminating
song (as in Parsons, Sea Islands, 145) is here emphasized by a second
intrigue, that of the sheep-skin suit. The idea seems related to the
next number. In Wona, 30-36, Tacoomah puts on a sheep-skin and bides in
the fold from which the sheep are being stolen, Anansi ties and accuses
him because he wears the sheep-skin.
