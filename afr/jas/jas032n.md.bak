*NOTE:* 

### 32. The Law against Back-biting.

Parkes learned this story on board ship coming from Africa. It is common
in Jamaica, and the wit by which the revenge is effected seems to be an
individual invention, as it varies from story to story. In Junod's
Ba-ronga version (156-158), Piti, the fool, amuses himself by the
roadside instead of going to herd cattle. Everyone who reproaches him
falls dead. Later he restores his victims to life by means of fire.
