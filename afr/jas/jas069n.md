*NOTE:* 

### 69. Grandy Do-an'-do.

In a Jamaica version by P. Smith, the story takes the form of the
transformed mistress (numbers 84, 87). Toad betrays the witch to her
suitor and teaches him the name by pronouncing which he discovers her
true nature. In another Jamaica story (P. Smith, 38-40), the monster
does not harm the woman who knows his name.

\[1. See supplementary note, p. 290.\]

{p. 264}

The story belongs to the group of fatal-name stories so popular in
Jamaica. See numbers 14, 17, 23, 31, 44, 75, 88, 87, 89, 92, 93. All
turn upon name customs and superstitions such as are touched upon in
Tremearne, 178-182; Renel, 2: 39-40; Theal 2:214; and discussed in
Clodd's Magic in Names, New York, 1921; Frazer's Golden Bough (1911)
3:318-418. See also Bolte u. Polívka 1:490-498, on Grimm 55.

Compare Junod, 309-313; Tremearne, 274-278; 349-350; Dayrell, 79-80;
Parsons, Andros Island, 114-115; Sea Islands, 22-23.

In this story, (1) a servant, refused food unless she tells the name of
her mistress, learns the secret from a friendly animal; (2) the mistress
discovers the traitor and avenges herself upon him or is herself
vanquished.

\(1\) In some African versions, girls come to wed a desirable suitor,
who kills them if they cannot tell his name. One girl is polite to an
old woman, who tells her the secret.

\(2\) In some African versions, as in number 93, the name is fatal. In
Jamaica, its possession wins a reward, and the interest is likely to
turn upon an explanatory ending. For the incident of singing the name,
see Musgrave, FLR 3: 1:53-54. For the bullfight, see number 88, and
compare Cronise and Ward, 55-65.
