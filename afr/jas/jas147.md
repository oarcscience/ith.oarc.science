### 147. John-crow and Fowl at Court.

Susan Watkins, Claremont, St. Ann.

John-crow and Fowl went to court. Now as Fowl's baby was prettier than
Crow's, Crow had taken Fowl's baby and left her baby for Fowl to take.
So Fowl took Crow to court. The judge said whichever could sing the
sweetest song should have the prettiest baby. Crow sang,

"Periwe, periwa!"

Fowl sang,

"Sun up an' sun down,  
I sing the song to cheer me heart.  
'Tis my charming baby dear,  
Bam, cluck, cluck!'"

So Fowl got back her pretty baby and Crow got her ugly one.
