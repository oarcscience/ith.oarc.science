*NOTE:* 

### 146. The Cumbalo.

Sarah Findley was an old-time negress who lived in a little hut far out
in the bush. She danced to the song with a queer jumping motion like
boys playing leap-frog and with all the agility of a young girl. The
dance as a wake game is performed upon two parallel bars held by four
men. One informant called it dancing "Calimbe."
