*NOTE:* 

### 141. Tacoomah makes a Dance.

Medleys of this character seem to have been a popular form of
entertainment and may still be common, though the examples I have were
given me in every case by old men. They are composed of scraps of song
or whole scenes from well-known Nansi stories, together with game-songs,
imitations of animal sounds, and "rhyming," strung together much like
our own musical medleys--the last line of one suggesting the first of
the next. In this example, story-songs from numbers 97 and 86 are
followed by a game dialogue; next by some animal imitations; last, by a
specimen of Jamaica "rhyming." Other examples of this kind of improvised
"rhyming" are:

"Mr. Might, jump up a height, after a kite,  
And knock his eye, upon his hog-sty, and cry out 'hi!  
    oh, my! why should I die'."

"There is a boat, and in the boat, is a goat, and has  
    a long coat, catch him under the throat."
