##### a. Old Conch.

Emanuel Johnson, Brownstown, St. Anne.

There was a king have a lumber to bring into the palace, an' that lumber
was one mile in length and there was not one man could carry it except
one old man name of Old Conch. The king sen' for him; him tek five days
to do one mile. Anansi hear, an' he can walk a little faster than him,
an' went to the king an' say he will go an' the king say if he can carry
it quicker than Old Conch, he can go. Anansi mek a cotta an' travel for
the lumber, an' when Old Conch ketch up the five days, fin' Anansi

were beside the timber an' comence a song,--

<span id="12400.jpg">![](img/12400.jpg)</span>  
Fol-low, timber, follow, fol-low 'long road, timber follow. Leap,
timber, leap,  
leap tim-ber, leap. Follow, timber, 'long road fol-low, fol-low, timber,
follow.

{p. 125}

fol-low,  
fol-low, 'long road, tim-ber, fol-low. Leap, tim-ber, leap, leap
tim-ber, leap.

Timber pick up himself an' mek a leap in two mile.

Anansi went on before an' stood beside the timber trying to help it on

Old Conch go beside the timber an' say,

"Follow long road, timber, follow!  
Follow long road, timber, follow!  
Follow long road, timber, follow!  
    Leap, timber, leap! leap, timber, leap!  
    Leap, me timber, leap! leap, timber, leap!"

Timber pick up himself mek one jump two more mile; that's four miles

The timber pick up himself two more miles an' drop in the king yard now.

Then Old Conch go on, an' Anansi run ahead an' say, "King, I brought de
timber!" King were very glad to see the timber come an' say, "You done
well, Anansi!" an' say, "I wan' de timber in dat corner." Anansi go
beside the timber an' couldn't fix it in; were trying an' frying an'
couldn't fix it in. Now Old Conch come, says, "King, I brought de
timber." King says, "No! Anansi  
brought it; but, however, I wan' de timber to go in dat corner, an' I'll
prove out of de two of you which bring it!" Anansi first go to the
timber, an' couldn't manage it. Now Old Conch start an' say,

tak a knife an' slit the timber-head like

*this* an' he fix the grass-straw into it, an' he say,\[1\]

<span id="12600.jpg">![](img/12600.jpg)</span>  
Come, lit-tle tim-ber, fol-low me, hur-rah we a lay.  
Come, lit--tle tim-ber, fol-low me, hur-rah me a lay,  
Big tim-ber, fol-low me, hur-rah me a lay. Little tim-ber,

measures; It was explained that the second time the song must stop as
given because that is how the Anansi Story ends.\]
