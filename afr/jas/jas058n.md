*NOTE:* 

### 58. Hunter, Guinea-hen and Fish.

The story as Williams tells it is made up of three parts. (1) Bird and
Hunter set up the same home without either knowing of the other. (2)
Bird supplies Fish with wings and brings him to the feeding-patch, then
takes the wings and flies away when Hunter comes in pursuit. (3) Fish is
captured as the thief, but escapes by song and dance into the sea.
