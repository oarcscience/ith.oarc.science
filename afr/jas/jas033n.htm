<P>Jekyll, 152-155, has a good version of this very popular Jamaica story.</P>
<P>Compare the Bulu tales, Schwab, JAFL 27:284-285; 32:434.</P>
<P>In JAFL 27, Turtle sets a trap and by pretending to teach other animals who come along one by one how to use it, he catches one victim after another until he is himself caught.</P>
<P>In JAFL 32, Pangolin offers to initiate the animals one by one and makes them climb a tree and jump upon a concealed rock, which kills them. Turtle finally circumvents the trick.</P>
<P>In a Jamaica version collected in Mandeville, Anansi holds a butchering at a place where there is a tree which seizes any person who leans against it and flings him upon a lance which Anansi has set up.</P>
