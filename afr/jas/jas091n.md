*NOTE:* 

### 91. Tiger softens his Voice.

Parkes heard his version on Cape Coast, Africa.

Jekyll, 108-113, Leah and Tiger, tells the story. In my number 17 a, it
is the mother who is hidden away. In Bahama versions, Parsons, 35-39,
the plot turns upon the rescue of the lost girl through song rather
than, as in Jamaica, upon the voice-changing trick by which she is
stolen.

Compare Jacottet, 62-69, Tremearne, 401; FL 21: 492-493; Hollis, Masai,
153-155; Callaway, 142-144; Theal, 118-120; Renel 1:247-249; Frazer, FLJ
7:167-168; Harris, Nights, 251-252; 257-260; Parsons, Sea Islands,
50-52; Rattray 2:14.

See Grimm 5, Wolf and Kids; Bolte u. Polívka 1:37-42, and Grimm 12,
Rapunzel; Bolte u, Polívka 1:97-99.
