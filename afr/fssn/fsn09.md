# VII. Why the Bat flies by Night

A BUSH rat called Oyot was a great friend of Emiong, the bat; they
always fed together, but the bat was jealous of the bush rat. When the
bat cooked the food it was always very good, and the bush rat said, "How
is it that when you make the soup it is so tasty?"

The bat replied, "I always boil myself in the water, and my flesh is so
sweet, that the soup is good."

He then told the bush rat that he would show him how it was done; so he
got a pot of warm water, which he told the bush rat was boiling water,
and jumped into it, and very shortly afterwards came out again. When the
soup was brought it was as strong and good as usual, as the bat had
prepared it beforehand.

The bush rat then went home and told his wife that he was going to make
good soup like the bat's. He therefore told her to boil some water,
which she did. Then, when his wife was not looking, he jumped into the
pot, and was very soon dead.

When his wife looked into the pot and saw the dead body of her husband
boiling she was very angry, and reported the matter to the king, who
gave orders that the bat should be made a prisoner. Every one turned out
to catch the bat, but as he expected trouble he flew away into the bush
and hid himself. All day long the people tried to catch him, so he had
to change his habits, and only came out to feed when it was dark, and
that is why you never see a bat in the daytime.
