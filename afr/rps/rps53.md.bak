### PSALM 50 BY THE MONARCH PETTERSBURGH

Psalms are the Music of the TREE of life.  
THE TREE of the Zodiac was much DISHONOURED by Angle-MILITANT
Astrologers.

His & Her Supreme Registered crown Manuscript of the Great Zodiac of His
Majesty King Alpha and his Wife, Queen Omega, the Lion and his Lioness,
Pettersburgh and His Wife Lula; Owner of the Canopy.  
Their Superior Registered Manuscript of all Angle-Militant Works.  
Planted a CROWNED CAPITAL of MOST HOLY CREATION, CALLED MT. AFRICA.

THE CANOPY OF THE MOST HOLY & LIVING GOD OF BOISTEROUS LOVE.  
Deeper and Sounder than the Anglo-Saxon (Slave) Manuscript at the
Monistry of St. Augustine at English Canterbury, since A.D. 1000.

SWEET HEART, GREAT BLACK SUPREMACY YOUR TRUE LOVER TOOK DOWN The
Angle-Militant Slaves, The Twentieth Century, A.D. 2000.

I am the Supreme Judge of Holy Time, Angle-Militant Crime Against the
TRUE and Most Holy Creator, is Eternal Leze Majesty.

MY SON, THE PSALMIST DAVID ASK ME TO CLOSE UP THE PIT FOR HIM.  
I am YOUR Vehement Venerable Psalmist and Bible Editor of the 'TREE of
Life, PETTERSBURGH THE MONARCH of Creation (from the Throne) June 2,
1926.
