### THE ETERNAL LAW OFFICE

HIS AND HER MAJESTY KING ALPHA AND QUEEN OMEGA'S WEDDING,
K.A.Q.O.K.O.K.  
St. Matthews 25 (ten) 10th Verse, left words, for Me to Lock Out
Adam-Abraham-Angle-Saxon the Lepor from my wedding's Banquet. I do not
Call Ministers for they are not working for me, they are following
Adam-Abraham-Angle-Saxon the Lepor.

Legislators said one Man CANNOT serve two Masters. Adam-Abraham The
lepor are Ministers and Lawyers Boss.  
For all they teach and Preach about is Adam and Eve and Abraham The
Lepor.

For they do not see not (even) one Book in The Bible, written by Adam
and Eve, or the Book of Abraham, or Book of Isaac According to the
(CLEARNESS) of This case, there is nobody name Adam and Eve, and Abraham
The Lepor, if you want to get away with RED HOT MURDER.  
If you ever touch the Slave papers they catch you as sure as God Lives.
S.J.W.K.A.Q.O.K.O.K.
