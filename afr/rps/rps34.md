### HIS AND HER MONARCH THE AFRICAN POTENTATE

The Lesson learnt by Slave Traders through Black Histories is well
PRESERVED.  
We have given Our Blood, Souls, Bodies, and Spirits to REDEEM
Adam-Abraham-Angle-Saxon the white man from his DREADFUL downfall and
Leprosy, but from 4004 B.C. to A.D. SECOND SCORE at his astonishing
stop.

He is STILL INFESTED with the indomitable INCURABLE accursed Deadly
Diseases.  
We have given him access to the Tree of Life, we gave him the Garden of
Eden, we gave him Egypt, Palestine, Africa.  
We gave him The Life, Soul, and Body of Jesus Christ, at the Request of
the Lepor, Ciaphas, their Chief Priest. We gave them Daniel and The Body
of the Black Virgin, The Mother of Jesus, and they took Joseph also.  
We gave ourselves to be Slaves for Hundreds of Years.  
WE GAVE UP KING ALPHA AND QUEEN OMEGA, THE FIRST AND THE LAST.  
Now we are Perfectly DISGUSTED OF THEM.  
We wash our hands of THEM, for life.

THE POTENTATE
