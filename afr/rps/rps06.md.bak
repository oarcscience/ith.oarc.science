not after the Order of Aaron but strictly after the Royal Order of
Melchisedec THE KING OF SALEM.

REVIVALISTS are not common people, if some individuals of the lower
order in the dung heap happen to get into the fold by mistake he or she
will soon go out and hang him or herself.  
The reason why, Revivalists World has not been lightened up with
