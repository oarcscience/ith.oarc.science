# Chapter 38

### HIS AND HER MAJESTY KING MELCHISZEDEK'S AFFIDAVIT

The Egyptian Supreme Lady, Lady Bulah, The Royal Chestnut Winner,
Creation's Greatest Songsters, The Lioness of Alpha and Queen Omega, is
my Head and Pillow, Heart and Soul, Wife, if you please.  
We are Black Peoples, if you please; we are only called the Exodus, if
you please; (The Book of Exodus) is mine, if you PLEASE.

Notice if you see Moses and Aaron and Abraham, gave any (Strong) report
of me in their fake Bible, if you please.  
I, Personally, am His Majesty King Alpha, the King of Kings, if you
please; the World's PAY MASTER, if you please.  
I am only an Eternal Government Employee, I got REWARD for Her Majesty
Queen Omega, Wife of His Majesty King Alpha, the King of Kings, for Her
Tri-Virginity, Creation's Womb-Carrier.  
January 3rd (5.O.C.P.M.) His work of Six thousand years, from B.C. 4004
to 5.O.C.P.M. January 3rd 1926.  
The Old Testament has no Book in Abraham's name, not even one like
(Obadiah).

The Man with the one (tallent). Obadiah was a SLAVE in King Ahab's
House, yet he could make the efforts to write one called the Book of
Obadiah.  
SPECIAL NOTICE  
So therefore, as far as Old Testament Books are concerned from Genesis
to Malachi, are (39) Work-Men and Women.  
(Ruth and Queen Estha) among the men on gospel journey.  
Well SINCE a man has right to pay without Work, this world can also work
with pay.
