# CHAPTER VI

### MAIDENHOOD TO MARRIAGE

THE first great event in the life of an Ibibio girl is her entrance into
the "Fatting-house," on the occasion of *Mbobi*--i.e. "The Coming of
Small Breasts."

This so-called "Fatting-house" is a room set apart in the home of the
parents for the seclusion of daughters while undergoing the process of
fattening up, which among West Coast tribes is thought necessary for
their well-being. During this time girls are not allowed to go outside
the compound walls save on very special and extremely rare occasions.
Theoretically they are not supposed to pass the threshold of the
"fatting-room." They do no work, and are fed up and pampered on every
side.

Before undergoing this seclusion for the first time, young girls are led
down to the edge of some sacred pool or stream or that from which the
village drinking water is drawn. A sacrifice is offered to the
indwelling naiad, and the following prayer recited over each maid:

"Behold! Here comes your child who is about to enter the Fatting-house.
Protect her that no evil thing may have power to harm her while she
dwells therein."

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

There is a beautiful appropriateness in this choice of the spirits of
streams and pools as the special guardians of maidenhood. So close,
indeed, was the tie that among Efiks, and indeed all Ibibios, as well as
amid the Ibenos, a small tribe of Ibo race driven by persecution to
leave their homes and settle in the southwestern part of the Eket
District, a special day in every week was set apart on which none but
pure maids might go down to the springs reserved for the drinking water
of the village. This day is called in Efik "Akwa Ederi" or "Greater
Sunday," to distinguish it from the lesser holiday called "Ekpiri
Ederi." Should wives, or those no longer maids, have failed to provide a
sufficient supply for the use of their household on the eve of the
festival, they must either persuade some maiden to fetch it for them, or
thirst till dawn of the following day.

A story in illustration of this ancient tabu was told us first by Mr.
David Ekong, son of the former head priest of the chief Ibeno juju,
Ainyena, and native minister of the church established by the Kwa Ibo
Undenominational Mission in his native town. He stated that he had heard
the tale from a very old man of Ibeno. In it the feminine water sprite,
a male tree spirit--for among his people the genii of the great trees
are thought to be male--and the leopard guardian of sacred spring and
grove, all play their part. It was afterwards told us by an Efik woman,
the sole difference being that in her account the tree spirit was
feminine. It runs as follows:

"There was once a man who had two wives. The daughter of one of them was
very sick, and in tending

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

her the mother, whose name was Adiaha Anaw, forgot to go down to the
spring and fetch enough water to last them over the sacred day of Idemm
(fresh water). When the child thirsted and begged for a drink, the
mother took some water from out a jar provided by her fellow wife, since
she had none of her own. When the latter discovered what had been done
she was very angry, and ordered the poor woman to go and fetch some with
which to repay her; although, by so doing, she knew very well that the
law of the juju would be broken. Since there was no other way to provide
drink for her child, the poor mother was forced to take her water-jar
and go down to the spring on the forbidden day. On the way she passed a
place where a great tree stood, and, as she drew near, the spirit of the
tree stretched out long branches over the road and blocked it so that
she could not pass. In great terror and perplexity she waited a while,
and would have gone back home again, but that the need of her child
urged her on. Then she made a little song, stating her case before the
genius of the tree and entreating help and protection. This was the song
that she sang:

"'I know that to-day is the day on which only maids may go to the
water;  
But yesterday I could fetch me none, because of my small sick
daughter.  
I begged my friends for even a cup, but none would grant such a thing;  
So now, I pray you, open the road, and let me pass to the spring.'

When the tree spirit heard the singing, he swept

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

his branches aside and allowed her to pass on; but, a little farther
along, she met a great leopard, who stood before her, blocking up the
road, so that her heart again sank with fear. Indeed, so terrified was
she this time, that she turned and ran back along the homeward path, but
again the thought of her child gave her courage to face the terrible
beast. To him also she sang, in a sweet, soft voice, bemoaning her hard
case; and he too, moved with pity, let her go by. At last she came to
the spring, and there, at its brink, she lifted up her voice and sang a
third time, entreating forgiveness for thus breaking the rule of the
juju. As she finished, the naiad rose from out the pool and spoke gently
to her, bidding her take what water she needed without fear. Before she
left, the spirit also gave her rich gifts to bear home to her child. So
with these she came back laden.

"The first thing which she did after her return was to give back the
water taken from the other woman. When the latter saw the presents which
her fellow wife had brought back, so envious was she of the other's good
fortune that she determined to go herself to the spring, although she
very well knew that this was forbidden.

"As the second woman walked along no obstacle blocked her road. The tree
spirit did not reach out so much as a twig to stay her, while the
guardian leopard let her pass unhindered. Only as she stood on the brink
of the spring and bent down to fill her jar did the water-sprite call
upon the stream to rise around her. Over all the place it swirled, ever
higher and higher, till it overflowed the lips of the terrified

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

woman. In vain did she strive to free herself, for she was held by a
force there was no resisting, and at length sank and was drowned in the
spring which she had polluted--not, like her fellow wife, from dire
need, but only through greed, because she was envious of the rich gifts
bestowed upon the other."

It is on account of the cleansing and fertilising powers ascribed to
water that maidens are led down to pool or stream before entering the
Fatting-house.

In those families which regard a tree as their special guardian, young
girls, before entering upon this period of seclusion, are led down to
stand beneath the shadow of the mighty trunk while prayers are offered
to induce the indwelling Dryad to look favourably upon this "child of
the tree" and shed upon her the blessing of strength and fruitfulness,
that she may grow up strong and tall, fair to the eye and fitted for
motherhood.

As among the Ekoi of the Oban District, so in almost every Ibibio town
of any age, there stands a gnarled specimen of *Dolichandrone*. This was
brought as a young sapling and planted when first the town was founded,
and ever since its great mauve-pink flowers have showered their fragrant
beauty upon generation after generation of sturdy piccans, slender
maids, round-limbed young mothers, and aged crones, who have come to
pray beneath its shadow. It is called "The Mother of the Town" (i.e. the
largest flower).

One of the best examples of such a tree is to be found at Ikotobo, in
the midst of the town playground. So old it is, that the trunk is little
more than a shell,

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

though still bearing aloft brave branches of dark waving leaves, and
great tufts of blossoms of a tint only to be described by the line in
which Dante depicts the apple blooms of his own land:

"Less than of rose and more than violet."

From the gnarled branches of this ancient tree hang great trails of
creamy white orchids, the fragrance of which lay like a benediction on
the early morning air as we passed by. Within the hollow trunk stood
native pots, filled with offerings; for this tree is the "Mother of the
Town," and to it come wives, young and old, to pray that "plenty
piccans" may be sent to bless their hearths. Hither, too, come ancient
women to beg a like boon for their children and grandchildren. Should
lightning shiver the aged trunk or tornado strike it down, loud would be
the wailing of those who have grown up beneath its shadow.

In most Okkobbor towns stands a great tree, named "Ebiribong," to which
offerings are made twice a year--at the planting of new farms, and
during the yam harvest. This is done with the special purpose of drawing
down the blessing of fertility upon the women of the place, as also upon
farm and byre.

That something of the beauty of the nature symbols which they worship
enters into the character of the race, however dimly felt or understood,
is shown, I venture to think, by many an unexpected trait, and more
especially by the touching gratitude evinced by some of the women, as
well as by the humbler members of the community generally, at my
husband's efforts to soften, as far as may be, the hardness of

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

their lot and give practical proof that British justice is indeed no
respecter of persons. Time after time attempts made upon his life in
revenge for the discovery and punishment of evil practices were
frustrated by warnings given, at the peril of their own lives, by such
humble members of the race. It would be more than ungrateful, too, not
to mention here the loyalty shown by some of the principal Oron chiefs,
two of whom publicly risked their lives to save ours.

Such actions are beyond praise--especially when one takes into account
the underlying antagonism to white rule ever present among peoples where
witch-doctor and fetish priest are untiring in their efforts to stem the
power of the white man, and prevent the suppression of those hideous
rites which still obtain in little-known parts of the earth such as
these.

In this part of the world it is easy, for those to whom the secret has
been confided, to know how many maidens are undergoing the fattening
Process, for, at the entrance to each town, before the market-place,
bundles of little frames--such as are used for the carriage of fresh or
dried fish--may be found tied together. Each bundle has been placed
there by the family of a girl who is just entering the Fatting-house as
an intimation to prospective wooers of the number of brides preparing in
the town.

Among the Efiks, and those Ibibios rich enough to bear the expense,
free-born girls of good family go twice, and sometimes even thrice, into
the Fatting-house before the full marriage ceremony is performed. As
already mentioned, the first occasion is called *Mbobi*, "The Coming of
Small Breasts." This usually

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

lasts for three months, during which time the girl undergoes
circumcision.

We chanced to be at Adut Nsitt, a town on the upper reaches of the Ubium
River, about the time when the daughters of the principal inhabitants
were ready to leave the Fatting-house after undergoing this first period
of seclusion. One of the chiefs stated that the girls were not due to
emerge till a few days later, but that they did so in honour of our
presence in the town. Some half-dozen of them came to visit us--the most
charming of whom, a small mite of eight summers, unfortunately could not
be persuaded to face the perils of the camera.

All wore massive bangles and bracelets of beaten brass or copper, and
from a cord round the neck of each dangled a live white chicken, feebly
fluttering against the bare brown breast of its bearer. It may be
noticed that in the Efik ceremony on the death of a great chief, each of
the women is said to wear a similar decoration. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)

The round brown limbs were painted over with elaborate patterns, in
black pigment, made either from the fruit of one of the many Randias
which abound in this district, or from the rhizome of the little wild
hyacinth-like Ibiri Nsi, to be found in great quantities all over the
neighbouring district of Oban.

The second time spent in the Fatting-house is the period in the lives of
Ibibio women during which they may be looked upon as most indulged--and,
indeed, spoiled to the top of their bent. This second seclusion

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

is fixed at the point where "brook and river meet." For a period
varying, according to the wealth of the family, from a few weeks to two
years, girls of good position, and even those not "free born" who are
looked upon as likely to repay the expenditure--by means of dowry
money--are sent once more into the Fatting-house. During this time they
again do no work, but are kept in one room, and fed up and pampered in
every way. The result is that they emerge, to the admiration of their
adoring relatives, and of the townsfolk at large, perfect mountains of
flesh--naked, in most parts of the district, save for a few strings of
beads and bells, or else decked out with an extravagant array of native
ornaments, but always with an air at once arrogant and querulous.

A day is set apart for the first appearance of the girls of each town
who are ready to emerge from the Fatting-house. On several occasions we
have been present when these swollen specimens of femininity strutted
through the market-place enjoying their brief hour of importance; while
the men, who at every other period of a woman's existence are looked
upon as of superior race, draw back admiringly, to give them passage.

On such occasions the whole charm of these women has temporarily
disappeared--at least in the eyes of white people. Of the kindly, gentle
air and friendly greeting to be found at all other times, there is no
trace in this their little hour of triumph. Only an overweening vanity
and bloated self-importance are now manifested.

The wooers, who stand during this parade

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

praising the merits, and value, of the various débutantes, afterwards
hurry to the parents with offers of dowry. A marriage is speedily
arranged for each, and the young bride quickly finds her place amid the
new surroundings; no longer petted, spoiled and pampered--the centre of
attention, for whom her family stint and deny themselves--but, only too
often, the slighted, hard-worked drudge of her new lord.

Among most Ibibio tribes all such rites are undergone in order to draw
down the blessing of Eka Mbopo, the "Mother of the Fatting-house." Among
Efiks, however, this is not the case. The second occasion on which a
girl of the last-named tribe enters the Fatting-house is called
"Abiana Abiana Nkuawhaw," "The Coming of the Full Breasts." The ceremony
is also in preparation for marriage, and, should the girl be already
betrothed, as is mostly the case, the bridegroom must now pay the first
instalment of dowry, or bride price, called "Nkpaw Nkuawhaw Eyen Owon,"
i.e. "Small Gifts of Fatting."

About Christmastide an Efik bride usually sallies forth to visit her
future husband and all his family. There is said to be a special
significance in the time chosen for thus emerging from seclusion. It is
just before the planting of new farms, and it is thought that the
ceremonies proper to the season, which are offered with the object of
drawing down the blessing of fertility upon the new crops, will not be
without favourable influence upon the maiden who, in this case, stands
with anything but "'reluctant feet,' where the brook and river meet."
The great ambition of such a one is to become a mother at the earliest

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

possible moment. As one of the tribe naively expressed it: "Young girls
just out of the Fatting-house are always looking round the corner, eager
to see their first babe."

Indeed, the ceremonies carried out throughout the Ibibio country in
honour of Abassi Isua, the God of the Year, with the object of inducing
the granting of plentiful crops, are so like those resorted to by the
Ekoi to ensure fruitfulness in a wife, that the two ideas would seem to
be closely connected.

After a short visit to the bridegroom's household the future bride goes
back, loaded with gifts, to live in the house of her mother as before.
Should the head wife of the prospective husband belong to a great
family, rich and powerful, and should she be sufficiently kindly
disposed toward the new bride as to invite the latter to stay with her,
the invitation may be accepted for two or three days. Among the gifts
borne back to the parents' house on return should always be a thousand
wires--in value about one pound sterling--given, to use the Efik
expression, "To wash juju." This is sent as a sign on the bridegroom's
part of his recognition of the marriage tie.

After this visit rich Efik girls often go back to the Fatting-house,
sometimes for as long as two years. During this time they never come out
at all, but only walk round within the compound walls.

Should the parents notice that the girl is growing so fat as to endanger
her health--to quote the words of my native informant--"they slack off
with the 'chop,' and afterwards increase the quantity again."

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

Just before a daughter leaves the Fatting-house, after this third
seclusion, the father and bridegroom consult together and fix upon a
date, saying:

"We will hold Etuak Ndum (i.e. 'Chalk Ceremony') on such and such a
day."

On the date chosen the girl is dressed out in her best, though the
robing may seem rather scanty to European eyes, and sits in state in the
midst of one of the inner courts of the compound. "Thither great gifts
are borne, sometimes as much as one to two hundred pounds in cash, with
string upon string of the finest beads, great bars of coral threaded
together, and the costliest of native ornaments. Next the bridegroom
enters followed by a long stream of servants bearing 'dashes,' which are
laid before the bride. Not for herself alone must such be provided, but
for every member of the family down to the little maids, who sometimes
get a penny only.

"Several moons earlier a fine house has been prepared in the husband's
compound. A 'play' is given, and the bride is borne thither, the
performers following. Friends and acquaintances stay until midnight,
then at the coming of darkness leave her alone with her husband. Only
the bride's mother lingers yet a little, trying to make friends with one
of the 'big women' of the compound, begging the latter to instruct the
new wife in her duty to her husband and in all native customs, teaching
her everything that may pleasure their common lord.

"After a good girl has thus been married she will never leave the
compound without her husband's permission. Woman friends may enter to
visit her,

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

but no man does so save the male servants sent to clean the rooms or
sweep courts."

According to Ibibio ideas the actual marriage tie is entered upon after
the payment by the groom to the bride's parents of the major portion of
the so-called "dowry money." The first instalment of this constitutes
betrothal, and is often paid when the little maid is still very young.

Infant betrothal and marriage are not uncommon. In the latter case the
baby bride usually lives with her husband's family; but, save in very
rare instances, her youth is respected by him. Should the contrary be
proved against a man his conduct is regarded as reprehensible, and the
girl's family can claim her back without returning the dowry.

In many cases child betrothal and marriage inflict undoubted hardships
upon the unfortunate bride, who thus has no word to say as to her own
fate. At the present day many such youthful spouses, on reaching years
of discretion, claim the protection of Government to free them from an
arrangement in which they had no choice.

A typical case is recorded from Ndun Ukaw town, where a girl, Nko by
name, had been betrothed as a very small child. On the day after she
came out of the Fatting-house her father said to her:

"The time has now come to carry out the marriage which I arranged for
you long ago. Prepare, therefore, to go to the home of the husband to
whom I have given you."

The girl pleaded that she did not like the man,

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

and earnestly begged that she might not be forced to wed him; but the
father answered:

"This is the one whom I have chosen for you. I will not allow you to
refuse. Him you shall marry, and no other."

To which she replied, "Sooner than wed such a one I would rather die."

On hearing this, the father shouted in great anger, "If you do not
accept the man whom I have chosen for you, I wish that you may die."

The daughter replied, very gently and with sad dignity, "I have nothing
more to say. By your order, sir, I die."

With that she went quietly out, and next morning was found lying dead by
her own hand.

The hardships to which unmarried girls among the Ibibios are sometimes
subjected may be illustrated by another case, which was brought up
before my husband on his first visit to the Native Court at Awa. On this
occasion a young girl, daughter of one of the head chiefs of the town,
claimed the Commissioner's protection against her father.

It appeared that two suitors were asking her hand, each of whom was in a
position to pay the usual "bride price" or dowry of thirty goats. She
herself seemed to have set her affections on a third wooer, whom, from
some cause or other, her father did not favour. When, therefore, the
latter ordered her to take as husband the man whom he had chosen, she
refused, and pleaded that if she might not be given to the man of her
choice she should at least not be forced into marriage against her will.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

In answer, the chief seized her and said:

"If it were not that this *bad* Commissioner is always going up and down
in his district, appearing at all times when and where he is least
wanted, I would kill you at once with my own hands for daring to disobey
me"

Perhaps it should be remarked that the adjective "*bad*" has a secondary
meaning of "strong," but in this case the circumstances forbid us to
hope that the word might have been intended in the more complimentary
sense.

The unnatural father bound the girl and thrust her toward the two
suitors whom he favoured, saying:

"Take this woman and do to her whatsoever you may choose, that thus she
may learn the penalty for having disobeyed me by refusing the man whom I
had chosen for her husband."

Delivered over in this way to the mercy of men furious at her rejection
of their suit, the wretched girl was dragged along the road to a waste
place in the bush. There she was stripped of every garment, and with
arms lashed behind forced to endure indescribable outrage. By a
fortunate chance, before the last extremity had been reached, a court
messenger happened to appear upon the scene. These men are natives
employed by Government to serve summonses, make arrests, and generally
assist in the carrying out of law and order. This particular one showed
considerable courage, for, when drawn to the spot by the girl's cries,
he not only ordered the men to desist from their ill-treatment of her,
but arrested them when, on the plea that they were justified by

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

the father's permission, in all that they had done, they refused to set
the girl free.

The court messenger took them, with the girl, before the chief, and
asked whether it was true that the latter had intended the men so to
maltreat his daughter. On which the cruel father is reported to have
said:

"You cannot touch these men. All that they have done was by my
authority. May not a father now do as he chooses with a disobedient
child?"

When the case was tried in court the advisory council of chiefs agreed
that all had been done as stated, and that they were willing, as a
concession to white prejudice in such matters, that some punishment
should be inflicted upon the two men. When it came, however, to the
question of penalising the chief himself, they pleaded, with a mixture
of astonishment and indignation, that a father surely had the right to
do as he would with his child, and must, therefore, on no account be
punished! Later, when it was explained that whatever might have been
native custom in such matters, these abuses could not be tolerated under
white rule, the spokesman pleaded again and again--long after his
request had been declared impossible--first, that an infinitesimal fine,
and afterwards a slowly increasing sum, might be inflicted; but no
imprisonment.

Another case, brought up before the Native Court at Oyubia in August,
1913, casts further light on Ibibio ideas of marriage.

A man had lately died, and two people came forward to claim his
property, the value of which

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

was computed at about £150. The first of these, Ensinini by name,
demanded the whole sum *plus* the five wives, on the ground that the
dead man had not been free born, but was a "member" of the family of
which he himself was the head. The second claimant was chief wife of the
deceased, and asserted that her late husband had been free born. Since,
singularly enough, neither son nor brother of the dead man existed, she
demanded that, in default of nearer kin, the goods should come to her.
The second wife gave corroborative testimony to the statement that their
common husband had been of free birth, and the third was called as a
further witness on the matter. In answer a small girl of some eight
years appeared. Afterwards the Commissioner asked to see the other two,
and a little later a diminutive person of not more than five summers
walked shyly up. The chief wife begged to be excused from producing the
fifth on the ground that the latter was only just able to walk, and had
been presented by herself, after her own payment of dowry, to her late
husband only a few weeks before his death.

By native law the whole question turned upon the point as to whether the
deceased was free born, or a "member" of the first claimant's family. An
equal number of witnesses came forward to swear to positive knowledge as
to the truth of each conflicting statement. In the end the bewildered
"assessors" suggested that the property should be divided into two equal
portions--one for the male claimant and the other to be distributed
between the five wives.

Both sides vehemently objected to such an arrangement,

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

the woman adding, "Why, at any rate, should the other four have a
share?" The judgment was, however, upheld by unanimous opinion of the
Court, and a long and difficult case seemed at an end, when a chief of
great weight rose to propound a question which to native ideas was of
first importance, but which, in all probability, would never have struck
the white man who was acting as judge.

"To whom," queried the chief, "will the dowry of the five wives be paid
on their re-marriage?"

At first sight, to twentieth-century eyes, this question seemed so
simple of solution that the Commissioner answered, "Why not to the
parents as usual?"

One of the jurors rose, horror visibly struggling with respect, to
ejaculate, "Why should the father enjoy a double dowry? Were such a
thing allowed the husband's family would lose from both sides!"

By native law in such a case one of two courses was open to the
"widows." Either to remain in the family, "bearing children to the dead
man's name," as was also decreed by old Jewish custom, or to pay back
the dowry, and be free to leave their late husband's family and marry
any man whom they might choose.

Although in the case above cited, a member of the Court rose to
expostulate against the idea that a father should be allowed to "enjoy"
double dowry on account of the same daughter, yet instances axe not
unknown in which parents have so arranged matters that the marriage
affairs of an only child provided them with a veritable gold mine.

Such was the case of Ama Awsawdi of Okuko,

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

who, so soon as his daughter had left the Fatting-house, gave her in
marriage to Obio Esio of Ubodo, receiving as dowry thirty "articles" and
one cow-valued together at about £25. A short time afterwards this
unprincipled parent inveigled the girl away. The two went on a journey,
in the course of which the father arranged a second wedding with one
Ukpon Uwe. From this new son-in-law he received eighty articles and one
cow, the total value of which was about £50. After a few days, Ama
coaxed the girl to leave her second husband and go away with himself to
Calabar. She was undoubtedly attractive, and the father considered that
a few shillings laid out on a gown and bead ornaments for her were
likely to prove a good investment. For considerably less than one pound
sterling he succeeded in attiring the girl so sumptuously that a
well-known citizen named Asukwaw Etin was induced to offer a hundred
articles and one cow, i.e. about £60, as bride price. Since this third
son-in-law was a man of greater weight and position than the others of
whom he had so easily rid himself, Ama probably thought it necessary to
be a little more careful in his dealings on this occasion. He therefore
went to consult one or two friends as to the next step in his career of
crime.

"I am thinking of taking away my daughter to a far country," he said,
"and there hiding her until I can arrange a fresh marriage. I do not
want anyone to know that I am running away with the girl, lest she
should be pursued and brought back; so please help me to hide our
tracks."

The men consulted were too conservative to receive

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

such revolutionary ideas with favour. They therefore protested against
the plan, but Ama replied:

"I know what I am doing, and would not act thus in defiance of custom
without pressing cause; but my debts are really too heavy, and I can see
no other way of paying them! That is my reason for wanting to run away
with the girl."

Since the friends on whose help he had counted would have none of his
plan, Ama shrugged his shoulders and, being an energetic soul, proceeded
to carry it out by himself. The daughter was abducted and concealed in
what the father thought a safe retreat. Matters were progressing most
favourably in the direction of her fourth nuptials when a cruel fate
intervened with the news that the three defrauded husbands had joined
forces and were on the way to demand a return of their dowries. Such a
contingency was unforeseen and unprovided for. The excellent *parti*
with whom the new alliance had been all but arranged, at a higher rate
than ever before, had to be abandoned, and the pair disappeared in the
direction of Mbukpo, where they were lost sight of, but are still in all
probability, pursuing their profitable career amid "fresh woods and
pastures new."

Viewed in the light of a provider of dowries, the story of the mother
who, when faced by the necessity of giving up one of her children, chose
to keep the daughter rather than the son on account of the high bride
