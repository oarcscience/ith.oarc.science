------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ultimately, we are all Africans. Studies of mitochondrial DNA have
proven that all human beings are descended from a small population (less
than a hundred individuals) that emerged from Africa about 60,000 years
ago. The earliest written religious texts as well as the first
documented monotheistic religion also developed in Africa. During the
European dark ages, many ancient manuscripts were preserved in African
libraries in places such as Ethiopia and Timbuctoo.

This section has texts on the traditional spirituality of Sub-Saharan
Africa, as well as their descendants in the New World.

Finding books about African religion and spiritual beliefs [in the
public domain](../faq.htm#public_domain.md) was not difficult. These books
have a great amount of useful information on this topic, some of it
written before colonialism destroyed or greatly modified aspects of
traditional culture. The problem with these works is that they were for
the large part written by Europeans with their particular biases and
agendas. For this reason, we encourage you to 'read between the lines'.

The texts here are provided for scholarly purposes. They may contain
racist characterizations, errors of interpretation, or
misrepresentations of traditional culture. For instance, the term
'Kaffir', which is used in many of these texts to refer to the Xhosa
(Nelson Mandela's tribe), is now considered derogatory.

This page also has texts and books with alternate views, primarily
written by African-Americans, which, in our opinion, also deserve
consideration.

Africa is home to a rich religious tradition. Refer to [Ancient
Egypt](../egy/index), [Islam](../isl/index.md), and
[Christianity](../chr/index.md).

### <span id="wc_africa">West and Central Africa</span>

The West African area is important because this is where the majority of
slaves departed for the New World. Hence large elements of West African,
particularly Yoruba, religion (blended with Catholicism) can be found in
religions such as Vodun (also known as Voodoo) (Haiti), Candomblè
(Brazil) and Santeria (Carribean). For more information on New World
African-derived religions, refer to the [The Santeria
page](https://www.religioustolerance.org/santeri.md) at Ontario Consultants
for Religious Tolerance.

Here are two books relating to Haitian Voodoo (Vodun). They were written
by an outsider to the religion who was ultimately unable to penetrate
its inner mysteries; however both of these books has strengths as
historical and ethnographic background on the topic:
