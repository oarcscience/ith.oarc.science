# CHAPTER XII: THE AMAZIMU

THE word *izimu*, in the Zulu tales, is usually, as by Callaway and
Theal, translated 'cannibal.' But this word, with us, is ordinarily
applied to people who, for one reason or another, are accustomed to eat
human flesh. As Callaway pointed out long ago, however, "it is perfectly
clear that the cannibals of the Zulu legends are not common men; they
are magnified into giants and magicians." Perhaps it might also be said
that the attributes of the legendary *amazimu* were transferred to the
abhorred beings, who, driven to cannibalism by famine, kept up the habit
when it was no longer needed and, as Ulutuli Dhladhla told the bishop,
"rebelled against men, forsook them, and liked to eat them, and men
drove them away . . . so they were regarded as a distinct nation, for
men were game (izinyamazane) to them."\[1\] In fact, he distinctly says
that "once they were men," and implies that they were so no longer.

## Cannibals

The practice of cannibalism undoubtedly exists in Africa, though it is
much less common than is sometimes supposed; and it is usually of a
ceremonial character, which is a different matter from using human flesh
as ordinary food. This last seems to be-or to have been-done by some
tribes in West Africa-*e.g.*, the Manyema-but one need not accept all
the sensational statements that have been published on this subject. So
far as there is any truth in these, the custom probably originated in
famine times, as it did with the people referred to by Bishop Callaway's
informant. Thus, it is said, in Natal, after a long drought, a certain
chief of the Abambo, named Umdava, "told his people to scatter
themselves over the veld and catch all the people they came upon in the
paths to serve as food . . . and those people lived on human flesh till
the time for the crops came round." \[2\] The dwellers on Umkambati (the
Table Mountain

\[1. *Nursery Tales*, p. 156.

2 Colenso, *Zulu-English* Dictionary, P. 705.\]

near Pietermaritzburg) were more than once attacked by these cannibals.

The old chief Nomsimekwana, who died less than thirty years ago, had a
narrow escape from them in his childhood. They seized his whole family
and drove them along, making the boy carry on his head the pot in which,
so they told him, he was to be cooked. Watching his opportunity, at a
turn in the path hidden by the tall grass he slipped into the Umsunduzi
river, and lay concealed under the bushes which overhung the bank-the
spot was pointed out to me in 1895. Failing to find him, the enemy came
to the conclusion that he had been killed by the hippopotami, who at
that time abounded in the river, and passed on their way. Nomsimekwana's
sister and the other captives were ultimately killed and eaten.

Those man-eaters who refused to give up the practice when the necessity
for it had passed fled to the mountains, pursued by universal
execration, and eked out a wretched existence in dens and caves,
sallying forth, when occasion offered, to attack lonely travellers.
Moshesh, paramount chief of the Basuto, spared no pains in putting an
end to these horrors, though he refused to exterminate the criminals, as
his councillors advised, provided they would turn from their evil ways.
He gave them cattle, and encouraged them to till the soil, and when that
generation had died out cannibalism was a thing of the past,

Ulutuli Dhladhla, whom we quoted in a previous paragraph, said that "the
word *amazimu*, when interpreted, means to gormandize-to be gluttonous."
But the word exists in so many Bantu languages, with (as far as one can
discover) no such connotation, that I cannot help thinking him mistaken.
Moreover, it has, distinctly, some relation to *mzimu* (of a different
noun class), which means 'a spirit' -in the first instance an ancestral
spirit. It is not used in Zulu, where the ancestral spirits are called
*amadhlozi*, or *amatongo*, save in the phrase *izinkomo ezomzimu*,
"cattle of the spirits"-i.e., slaughtered as a sacrifice to them. Here
*umzimu* seems to be "a collective name for *amatongo*."

## Ogres

The Basuto use the word *madimo* (singular *ledimo*) for 'cannibals,'
*badimo* for 'spirits' or 'gods.' *Zimwi* is the Swahili word for a
being best described as an ogre; the word occurs in old, genuine Bantu
tales, and I have heard it used by a native; but most Swahili nowadays
seem to prefer the Arabic loan-words *jini* and *shetani*. A ghost is
*mzuka*; but the stem *-zimu* survives in the expression *kuzimu*, "the
place of spirits "-thought of as underground -and *muzimu*, a place
where offerings are made to, spirits. The Wachaga and the Akikuyu have
their *irimu*, the Akamba the *eimu* (the Kamba language is remarkable
for dropping out consonants), and the Duala, on the other side of
Africa, their *edimo*. Other peoples in West Africa, while having a
notion of beings more or less similar, call them by other names. The
*makishi* of the Ambundu in Angola play the same part in folk-tales as
the *amazimu*-their name may perhaps be connected with the Kongo
*nkishi* (*nkisi* in some dialects), which meant originally 'a spirit,'
but now more usually 'a charm,' or the object commonly called a
'fetish.' The Aandonga (in the Ovambo country south of Angola),
strangely enough, tell the usual ogre tales of the *esisi* 'albino.'
Albinos are found, occasionally, in all parts of Africa; they are not,
as a rule, so far as one can learn, regarded with horror, though the
Mayombe of the Lower Congo think that they are spirit children, and
observe particular ceremonies on the birth of such a one.

The appearance of the *izimu* is variously described, but it seems to be
agreed that he can assume the appearance of an ordinary human being, if
it is not his usual guise. The Zulus and the Ambundu say they may be
recognized by their long, unkempt hair-a noticeable point among people
who either shave off their hair frequently for reasons of cleanliness,
or build it up into elaborate structures, like the conical coiffures of
Zulu wives or the head-rings of their husbands.

The *makishi* are sometimes said to have many heads; in one story when
the hero cuts off a *dikishi's* head he immediately grows a second; in
another a *dikishi* carries off a woman and makes her his wife; when her
child is born and found to have only one head the husband threatens to
call it "our folk" to eat her if she ever has another like it. As the
second baby appears with two heads the threat was not fulfilled. But,
thinking it best to be on the safe side, the wife took the elder child
and ran away, hid for the night in a deserted house, was surprised when
asleep by a wandering *dikishi*, and eaten after all.

Other accounts of the *amazimu* are still more weirdly sensational. The
*irimu* of the Wachaga is said to be a 'were-leopard'-that is, a man who
is able at will to change himself into a leopard. But in one story this
*irimu*, or leopard, is described as having ten tails; in another he
presents himself in human shape at a homestead, as a suitor to the
daughter, but is detected when she catches sight of a second mouth on
the back of his head.\[1\] In the Ronga story of "Nabandji" \[2\] the
people of the cannibal village whence the young man takes a wife all
have this peculiar feature. It may not be out of place here to mention a
Hausa (Nigeria) belief that a witch has mouths all over her back. It is
not easy to see what can have suggested this notion.

The Chaga idea of the *irimu* seems to be a fairly comprehensive one. An
unfortunate man, who broke a *tabu*, was turned into an *irimu*, with
the result that thorn-bushes grew out of his body, and he wandered about
the country, swallowing everything that came in his way. His brother,
whom he had considerately warned to keep his distance, consulted a
diviner and, by his advice, set the thorns on fire. When they were all
burned away the *irimu* returned to his own proper shape.\[3\]

Sometimes the *amazimu* are said to have only one leg, or only half a
body; one story of a Kikuyu *irimu* describes him as having one leg, but
two heads, one of which was stone; one-half of his body was human, but
the other half stone. The Basuto speak of a set of beings with one leg,
one arm,

\[1. Gutmann, *Volksbuch*, p. 75

2\. Junod, *Chants et contes*, p. 246.

3\. Gutmann, *Volksbuch*, p. 73.\]

one ear, and one eye, but these are called *matebele* \[1\] (it is not
quite clear why), not *madimo*. They carry off a chief's daughter,
though it is not suggested that she is to be eaten. In the story of "The
Mothemelle" \[2\] we hear of cannibals (*madimo*) "hopping on one leg."
But these half-bodied beings, while appearing in folklore all over
Africa, are, as a rule, quite distinct from the *amazimu*. They are not
invariably malignant; often,. indeed, very much the reverse. They will
be discussed later on.

## The Little People

Chatelain thought that the *makishi* were the aboriginal inhabitants of
the country, the 'Batua' (Batwa) Pygmies, "not as they are now, but as
they appeared to the original Bantu settlers." But there is no evidence
that the Pygmies or the Bushmen (whom the Zulus call Abatwa) were ever
regarded as cannibals. Callaway's Zulu informants were very emphatic
about "the dreadfulness of the Abatwa," who, if offended, as by a
reference to their small stature, about which they were especially
sensitive, would shoot you with a poisoned arrow as soon as look at you.
But there is no reference to their eating human flesh.

There is a distinct body of tradition about these 'little people,' who
are nowhere confused with the *amazimu*; they may be dangerous if
irritated, as stated above, but are otherwise inoffensive, and even
helpful, when approached in the right way. The Wachaga have tales about
the Wakonyingo, supposed to live on the summit of Kilimanjaro (formerly
believed inaccessible to human feet), which show them in quite an
amiable light. Even the man who insulted them by taking them for
children and asking when their parents were coming home met with no
worse fate than waiting dinnerless till nightfall, and then going home
as he

\[1. This name is applied by the Basuto not only to the Zulus of
Rhodesia (Amandebele), but to the Zulus and Xosa in general. Their
relations with these people have so often been hostile that their name
may have been given for this reason to the monsters in question.

2\. Jacottet, *Treasury of Ba-Suto* Lore, p. 224.\]

had come, whereas his more tactful brother was presented with a fine
herd of cattle.

Dr Doke,\[l\] writing about the Lamba people, also distinguishes between
ogres (*wasisimunkulu* or *wasisimwe*\[2\] and dwarfs (*utuchekulu*),
whom he calls 'gnomes.' These, however, differ from the other 'little
people' in one important respect-they eat people. The gnome is renowned
for the one long tooth, blood-red and sharp, with which it kills its
victims. Moreover, the Lamba people recognize the existence of pygmies
(*utunyokamafumo*), distinct from the gnomes. In the one story in which
they figure they come much nearer the character of the *wakonyingo*. Yet
in "The Choric Story \[3\] of the Lion" a gnome shows himself helpful in
saving a man and his sister from an ogre.\[4\] And in another tale a
gnome who has been robbed of his drums by the chief's orders sprinkles
'medicine' over the men carrying them off, whereupon they all fall down
dead, and he recovers his property. But, having done so, he sprinkles
them again, and they return to life. And the matter was arranged
amicably in the end.

## The Kamba Aimu

A different origin for the *amazimu* has been suggested by
others-*viz.*, that they are the ghosts of evil-disposed persons. This
is expressly affirmed by the Akamba about some spirits called *limu ya
kitombo*. They

haunt woods and waste places . . . they are evil spirits and are
supposed to be the disembodied relics of people who have killed their
neighbours by the help of black magic. . . . God has banished them to
the woods, where they wander about without anyone to care for them by
sacrificing to them. . . . A man who lived at Kitundu went out one night
about midnight to look at a maize-field

\[1. *Lamba Folklore*, pp. 385-386.

2 This word contains the same root (-*simwe*) as -*zimu*.

3 Dr Doke uses this expression to translate *ulusimi*, "a prose story
interspersed with songs," in which the audience join. See also Steere,
*Swahili Tales*, Preface, p. vii.

4 This belongs to the type of story labelled "Robber Bridegroom" in the
Folk-Lore Society's classification.\]

some distance away.... On his way back he met a spirit in the path; it
was of enormous size, and had only one leg ... before he could move he
was struck down by a flash of fire, and the spirit passed on its way.'

This may well have been the origin of the *amazimu*, but I fancy that in
most cases it has been forgotten, and they are looked on as quite
different from the ghosts, good or bad. Another point to notice is that
the ghosts are still largely believed in and taken quite seriously,
while the *amazimu* proper occur only in stories related for
entertainment (and, possibly, instruction), but not accepted as fact.
This fits in with Mr Hobley's account of the *aimu*, described by the
Akamba as wicked ghosts, and actually seen (and even felt!) by people
now living.

It will be noticed that the Akamba, like the Akikuyu, give the *aimu*,
or some of them, only one leg. Dr Lindblom also mentions this
characteristic. In addition he states that the *eimu* is "a figure
appearing in different shapes, sometimes smaller than a dwarf, sometimes
of superhuman size . . . though, on the other hand, he also often
appears as a wholly human being . . . he is a gluttonous ogre, and
kidnaps people in order to eat them up." This writer refers to several
Kamba stories-unfortunately not yet published in one of which the *eimu*
appears as a handsome young man and lures a girl to his home; in another
a Kamba woman turns into an *eimu* and eats her own grandchild.\[2\]

The idea of the *eimu* seems here to be mixed up, in some cases, with
that of the Swallowing Monster, in the peculiar form in which it occurs
in Basutoland and in Ruanda:

A favourite ending to many tales about the eimu, or nearly related, more
or less monstrous beings, is that the monster, now

\[1. Hobley, *Bantu Beliefs*, pp. 89 and 91. It is curious that both
this and other authorities give the plural of *eimu* as *aimu*, which is
properly a plural of the person class, whereas the right form would be
*maimu*, of the sixth noun class. *Aimu* is also the Kamba word for the
ancestral spirits, but this plural is seldom, if ever, used for the
ogres, while the singular of *aimu*, 'ghosts,' is equally rare, so that
there is not likely to be any confusion between the two. *Izimu* and all
cognate words in. Bantu belong to the *li-ma* class (5-6), while the
words for the ancestral ghosts belong (with some exceptions, as *aimu*,
above) to the *mu-mi* class (3-4).

2 Lindblom, *Kamba Tales*, pp. viii and ix.\]

at length vanquished, tells his conqueror in his death-hour to cut off
his little finger, and, this having been done, the people and cattle
that he had devoured all come to life again.

## Stories of Escape from Ogres

There are several stories which, in slightly differing shapes, are found
probably in all parts of the Bantu area. Some of them are familiar to us
from European analogues, though this does not necessarily mean that they
have been imported. In one the ogre puts a girl into a bag and carries
her about the country till she is rescued by her relations. Another
tells how a party of girls or lads pass the night in an ogre's hut, and
are rescued by the ready wit of the youngest. Then we have the girl
forcibly married to an ogre who makes her escape in various ways. And,
again, there is the theme, already referred to, of the "Robber
Bridegroom," though he is more commonly a transformed animal (hyena,
leopard, or lion) than an ogre properly so called. But, as the Chaga
*irimu*, for instance, is also described as a 'were-leopard,' it is not
always easy to keep the two notions distinct.

Some stories of escape from ogres employ the familiar device of
obstacles created by the fugitives throwing various things behind them,
which become a rock, a fire, a forest of knives, and a lake or river.
This particular incident may not be indigenous to Africa; it is not
found in all the stories, and those which have it-*e.g.*, "Kibaraka,"
referred to in our concluding chapter-contain other foreign elements.
There is no reason to suppose that most of the other incidents are not
of home growth.

Of the type first mentioned there is a well-known example in the story
of "Tselane," which (first published by Arbousset in 1842) was
introduced to English readers by Sir James G. Frazer, under the title of
"A South African Red Riding-hood." \[1\] The resemblance to the European
Red Riding-hood is not very close, and applies chiefly to the opening
incident, which is not found in most of the versions.

\[1. *Folk-Lore Journal* (1889), vol. vii, p. 167.\]

Tselane, remaining behind in the hut from which her parents have
migrated, is charged by her mother not to open the door to anyone but
herself. The ogre, by imitating the mother's voice, gains admission and
carries the girl off. The same opening is found in "Demane and Demazana"
(where it is a brother, not the mother, whose voice is counterfeited),
but in the Zulu "Usitungusobendhle" \[1\] and the Xosa "The Cannibal's
Bird," \[2\] and in most, if not all, of the other stories, a party of
girls go out to bathe, or to gather wild fruits, or for some other
purpose, and one of them, either unwittingly, or even in wanton
mischief, offends the ogre, who thereupon seizes her.

A curious point in the Sesuto, Xosa, and Zulu versions is that when the
ogre has been (as they think) finally disposed of he is changed into a
tree, which seems to have retained harmful powers, for when people tried
to get honey out of the hollow trunk their hands stuck fast.\[3\]
Something of the same notion appears in the Swahili tale I am about to
relate. It is called " The Children and the Zimwi."

## A Swahili Tale

Some little girls went out to look for shells on the seashore. One of
them found a very beautiful shell and, fearing to lose it, laid it on a
rock, so that she could pick it up on the way home. However, as they
were returning she forgot it till they had passed the place, and then,
suddenly remembering it, asked her companions to go back with her. They
refused, and she went alone, singing to keep up her courage,\[4\] and
found a *zimwi* sitting on the rock. He said, "What do you want?" and
she sang her song over again. He said, "I can't hear you. Come closer!"
And when she

\[1. Callaway, *Nursery Tales*, p. 74.

2\. Theal, *Kaffir Folklore*, p. 25.

3\. The same thing happens in a Ronga story to some women who had
offended the ghosts by trespassing on their sacred grove.

4\. The words of the song are a mixture of Yao and Swahili (indicating a
probable origin for the story). The meaning is not very clear, except
for the two lines: "I have forgotten my shell; I said, Let me go back
and pick it up." Neither is it clear from the text as it stands whether
she began to sing before or after she had seen the zimwi. If the latter,
the song may have been intended to propitiate him, though it seems to
have had the opposite effect.\]

had done so he seized her and put her into a barrel (*pipa*)\[1\] which
he was carrying.

He then set off on his travels, and when he came to a village made for
the place of meeting \[2\] and announced that he was prepared to give a
musical entertainment in return for a meal. "I have this drum of mine. I
should like a fowl and rice." He beat the drum, and the imprisoned child
sang in time to the rhythm, to the delight of every one. He was given
plenty of food, but gave none to the girl. He went on and repeated his
performance at the next village, which happened to be the girl's own
home. The report of his music seems to have preceded him, for the people
said, "We have heard, O zimwi, that you have a most beautiful drum; now,
please, play to us!" He asked for *pombe* (native beer), and, being
promised that he should have some, began to beat the drum, and the girl
sang. Her parents at once recognized her voice, and when the performance
was over supplied the drummer with all the liquid refreshment he
required. He soon went to sleep, and they opened the drum, released
their daughter, and hid her in the inner compartment of the hut. They
then put into the drum a snake and a swarm of bees and some biting ants,
and fastened it up again.

In the Sesuto and Xosa versions the parents, instead of making the ogre
drunk, induce him to go to the stream for water, and give him a leaky
pot in order to delay his return as long as possible. In one case they
put in a dog as well as the venomous ants, in the other snakes and
toads, the latter being supposed poisonous.

After a while they awakened him, saying, "Ogre, wake up! Some strangers
have arrived, and they want to hear.

\[1. Later on it is called a drum (*ngoma*), as it is in Dudley Kidd's
story of "The Child in the Drum," in *Savage Childhood*, p. 233. In this
the child is said to be a boy; but I cannot help thinking this is a
mistake. Europeans seem to take for granted that a child is masculine
unless otherwise specified.

2\. Called by Duff Macdonald the 'Forum'; in Chinyania *bwalo*; in
Swahili *baraza*. It is sometimes merely an open space under the village
fig-tree, sometimes an erection like a bandstand, sometimes a more
ambitious structure, with seats for the elders, who hold their
discussions there. Strangers arriving at a village always make for this
place.\]

your music." So he lifted his drum and began to beat it, but the voice
was silent. He went on beating, but no other sound was heard, and at
last he took his leave, and was not pressed to stay.

When he had gone a certain distance and was no longer in sight of the
village he stopped and opened his drum. Immediately the snake shot out
and bit him, the bees stung him, and he died.

## The Baleful Pumpkin

But that was not the end of him. On the spot where he died there sprang
up a pumpkin-vine, which bore pumpkins of unusual size. One day some
small boys passing by stopped to admire them, and, prompted by the
destructive instinct which seems to be inherent in the very young of all
climes, exclaimed, "jolly fine pumpkins, these! Let's get father's sword
and have a slash at them!"

The largest of the pumpkins waxed wroth and chased the children-breaking
off its stem and rolling over and over, one must suppose-and they took
to their heels. In their headlong flight they came to a river, and saw
the old ferryman sitting on the bank by his canoe.

"You, Daddy, ferry us over! Take us to the other side! We are running
away from a pumpkin."

The old man, without waiting for explanations, took them across, and
they ran on till they came to a village, and found all the men sitting
in the *baraza*, to whom they appealed: "Hide us from that pumpkin! The
*zimwi* has turned into a pumpkin. You will just have to take it and
burn it with fire."

No doubt this version has lost some particulars in transmission; the
whole neighbourhood must have known the story, and been aware that the
pumpkin-plant had grown out of the *zimwi's* remains; one may guess that
the boys had, over and over again, been told not to go near it, and,
boylike, were all the more attracted to the forbidden thing.

The men seem at once to have appreciated the danger; they hurried the
boys off into a hut and told them to keep quiet behind the partition at
the back. Presently the pumpkin arrived. It is not explained how it had
crossed the river, but in such a case one marvel the more is easily
taken for granted. It spoke with a human voice, saying, "Have you seen
my people \[i.e., my slaves\] who are running away?"

The village elders, who by this time had returned to their seats and
were deliberately taking snuff, asked, "What are your people like? We
don't know anything about them." But the pumpkin was not to be put off.
"You have them shut up inside the hut!"

Then the old headman gave the word, two or three strong men seized the
pumpkin, chopped it to pieces, and built a roaring fire, in which it was
consumed to ashes. They scattered the ashes, and then released the boys,
who went home to their mothers.

We have already referred to versions in which the dead ogre turns into a
tree; in a Kiniramba story I collected by Mr Frederick Johnson a
porcupine, which seems to partake of the nature of an ogre or some other
uncanny being, is killed and buried under the fireplace. "In the morning
they found a pumpkin growing." This began by speaking, repeating
everything that was said in its presence, and ended by swallowing all
the people in the village. The Shambala people also have a story in
which a pumpkin figures as the Swallowing Monster-but here nothing is
said about its origin.

To return to the story of the ogre, some other versions give it a more
dramatic ending. In these he reaches his home, hands the bag to his
wife, and tells her to open it and cook the food. She refuses, on
finding that "the bag bites"; so, in turn, do his daughter and his son.
He shuts himself into the hut and opens the bag, with the result already
related; but instead of expiring on the spot he forces his way out, and
throws himself head first into a pool, or a marsh, out of which a tree
subsequently grows.

\[1. *Kiniramba Folk-tales*, p. 334.\]

## The Magic Flight

The second of the types mentioned above is well exemplified by the story
of Sikulumi, which is told, without much variation in its main features,
by Zulus, Xosas, Basuto, and Baronga.

One day a number of men seated by the fence of the chief's cattle-fold
saw several birds of a kind they had never seen before perched on a tree
not far off. The chief's son, Sikulumi, said, "These are indeed
beautiful birds. I want to catch one and make a plume for my head
\[*isidhodhlo*\] of his feathers."

So he and some friends set off in pursuit of the birds, which had
already flown away while they were seizing their knobkerries. They
followed them across country for a long time, and at last succeeded in
knocking down several. By this time the sun had set, and they were far
from home; but as darkness fell they perceived the glimmer of a distant
fire, and made for it straightway. When they came up with it they found
it was burning in an empty hut, which, though they could not know it,
belonged to some *amazimu*. They went in and made themselves at home,
plucked their birds, roasted, and ate them, after cutting off the heads,
which Sikulumi arranged all round the ledge of the hut. Then they made
plumes out of the feathers, and when they had done so went to sleep-all
but Sikulumi.

In the middle of the night an ogre arrived, having left his fellows at a
distance, and Sikulumi heard him muttering to himself, "Something smells
very good here in my house!" \[1\] He looked at the sleepers, one by
one-Sikulumi, of course, pretending to be asleep-and said, "I will begin
with this one, I will cat that one next, and then that one, and finish
up with him whose little feet are white from walking through the sand!"
\[2\] He then caught sight of the birds' heads, crunched them up, and
swallowed them, before starting off to call the other ogres to the
feast.

\[1. *Endhlini yami lapa kwanuka 'zantungwana!* Some versions make him
say, "I smell human flesh."

2\. In the Ronga version he says, ". . . I shall get fat right down to
my little toe!"\]

Sikulumi at once roused his friends and told them what had happened, and
they, picking up their plumes and their sticks, set off for home,
running for all they were worth. They had gone quite a long way when
Sikulumi remembered suddenly that he had left his plume behind. His
friends said, "Don't go back. Take one of ours. Why should you go where
cannibals are?" But he persisted. He took his stick, rubbed it with
'medicine,' and planted it upright in the ground, saying, "If this stick
falls over without rising again you will know that I am dead, and you
must tell my father when you get home. As long as it stands firm I am
safe; if it shakes you will know that I am running for my life."

Meanwhile the ogre had come back with his friends, and when they found
no one in the hut they were furious with him for cheating them, so they
killed and ate him.

On his way back to the hut Sikulumi saw an old woman sitting by a big
stone beside the path. She asked him where he was going, and he told
her. She gave him some fat, and said, "If the ogres come after you put
some of this on a stone." He reached the hut, and found a whole party
seated round the fire, passing his plume from hand to hand. On the fire
a large pot was boiling, in which they were cooking toads.\[1\] Sikulumi
sprang in among them, snatched his plume from an old hag who happened to
be holding it at that moment, and at the same time shattered the pot
with a blow of his knobkerrie, scattering the toads all over the floor.
While the ogres were occupied in picking them up he made his escape.
They were not long, however, in following him, and when he saw them he
did as the friendly old woman had told him and threw some of the fat on
a stone. When the ogres came up to this stone they began (it is not
explained why) to fight for the possession of it. One of them swallowed
it, whereupon the others killed and ate him. Sikulumi thus

\[1. Is this significant? I do not remember to have seen it noticed by
any writer on folklore; but a Nyasaland native told me that witches, at
certain seasons, eat frogs (or toads) as a part of their magical
practices. The incident of the stone, a little farther on, is not easy
to understand.\]

gained some advantage, but soon they had nearly come up with him again.
He threw some more fat on a stone, an

the same thing happened as before. Again they started after him, and
this time he threw down his skin cloak, which began to run off by
itself. The ogres ran after it, and were so long catching it that he was
able to rejoin his friends, and they all made their way home.

Here, properly, the story comes to an end, but the Baronga add another
adventure at a cannibal village, and the Xosa version \[1\] gives the
further incident of the ogres again nearly coming up with them and being
baffled by a "little man" (not accounted for by the narrator) who turned
a large stone into a hut. They took refuge in it, and the ogres, to whom
the outside still looked like a stone, tried to bite it, till they broke
all their teeth and went away.

The young men then reached their own village, and found that it had been
swallowed up, with all its inhabitants, except one old woman, by a
monster called an *inabulele*. This episode really belongs to another
story, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. The tale then goes
on to relate Sikulumi's courtship and marriage to the daughter of
Mangangezulu. It is not said that her family are cannibals, though "no
one ever leaves the place of Mangangezulu," as they seem to be in the
habit of killing strangers. By the help of a friendly mouse Sikulumi
escapes with the girl, and she takes with her "an egg, a milksack, a
pot, and a smooth stone." When she throws down the first it produces a
thick mist, the milksack becomes a lake, the pot darkness, and the stone
a huge rock. Thus the pursuers are baffled, and he reaches his home in
safety.

## The Ogre Husband

From the Duruma, a tribe living inland from Mombasa to the west and
north-west, comes the story of "Mbodze and the *Zimwi*," which forms a
good illustration of our third type.

There was a girl named Mbodze, who had a younger

\[1. Theal, *Kaffir Folklore*, P. 78.\]

sister, Matsezi, and a brother, Nyange. She went one day, with six other
girls, to dig clay-either for plastering the huts or for making pots,
which is usually women's work. There was a stone in the path, against
which one after the other stubbed her toes; Mbodze, coming last, picked
up the stone and threw it away. It must be supposed that the stone was
an ogre who had assumed this shape for purposes of his own; for when the
girls came back with their loads of clay they found that the stone had
become a huge rock, so large that it shut out the view of their village,
and they could not even see where it ended. When they found that they
could not get past it the foremost in the line began to sing:

"Stone, let me pass, O stone! It is not I who threw you away, O stone!  
She who threw you away is Mbodze, Matsezi's sister,  
    And Nyange is her brother."

The rock moved aside just enough to let one person pass through, and
then closed again. The second girl sang the same words, and was allowed
to pass, and so did the rest, till it came to Mbodze's turn. She, too,
sang till she was tired, but the rock did not move. At last the rock
turned into a *zimwi*-or, rather, we may suppose, he resumed his proper
shape-seized hold of Mbodze, and asked her, "What shall I do with you?
Will you be my child, or my wife, or my sister, or my aunt?" She
answered, "You may do what you like with me." So he said," I will make
you my wife"; and he carried her off to his house.

There was a wild fig-tree growing in front of the *zimwi's* house.
Mbodze climbed up into it, and sang:

"Matsezi, come, come! Nyange, come, come!"

But Matsezi and Nyange could not hear her.

She lived there for days and months, and the *zimwi* kept her well
supplied with food, till he thought she was plump enough to be eaten.
Then he set out to call the other ogres, who lived a long way off and
were expected to bring their own firewood with them. No sooner had he
gone than there appeared a *chitsimbakazi*,\[l\] like the friendly gnome
in the Lamba story, who, by some magic art, put Mbodze into a hollow
bamboo and stopped up the opening with wax. She then collected
everything in the house except a cock, which she was careful to leave
behind, spat in every room, including the kitchen, and on both the
doorposts, and started.

Before she had gone very far she met the ogres, coming along the path in
single file, each one carrying his log of wood on his head. The first
one stopped her, and asked, "Are you Marimira's wife?"-Marimira being
the ogre, Mbodze's husband.

She sang in answer, "I am not Marimira's wife: Marimira's wife has not a
swollen mouth \[like me \[2\]\]. *Ndi ndi!* this great bamboo!"

At each *ndi* she struck the bamboo on the ground, to show that it was
hollow, and the ogre, seeing that the upper end was closed with wax,
suspected nothing and passed on.

The other ogres now passed her, one after another. The second was less
easily satisfied than the first had been, and insisted on having the
bamboo unstopped, but when he heard a great buzzing of bees \[3\] he
said hastily, "Close it! Close it!" The same happened with all the rest,
except the last, who was Marimira himself. He asked the same question as
the others, and was answered in the same way, and then said, "What are
you carrying in that stick? Unstop it and let me see!" The sprite,
recognizing him, said to herself, "Now this is the end! It is Marimira;
I must be very cunning," and she sang:

"I am carrying honey, *ka-ya-ya!*  
I am carrying honey, brother, *ka-ya-ya!*  
*Ndi ndi!* this great bamboo!"

\[1. This sprite will come into the next chapter. There is usually no
indication as to its sex, unless we can infer it from the termination
*-hazi* which in some languages is a feminine suffix. But in a Swahili
story very like this one the helpful being is expressly said to be "a
little old woman."

2 The appearance of the *chitsimbakazi* is not described, but one may
assume that it had some sort of a snout, like an animal.

3 These bees are not accounted for; the text says simply The bees buzzed
at him-*who-o-o-o!*" Perhaps we are to suppose that the sprite had
filled up the top end of the bamboo with honeycomb, and that the bees
hatched out inside!\]

But he kept on insisting that he must see, and at last she took out the
wax: the bees swarmed out and began to settle upon him, and he cried in
a panic, "*Funikia! funikia!* Shut them up!"

So he passed on with his guests, and the sprite went on her way.

The ogres reached Marimira's house, and he called out, *"Mbodze!"* The
spittle by the doorposts answered, "*He-e!*" He then cried, "Bring some
water!" and a voice from inside answered, Presently!" He got angry, and,
leaving the others seated on the mats, went in and searched through the
whole house, finding no one there and hearing nothing but the buzzing of
flies. Terrified-and, as will be seen, not without reason-at the thought
of the guests who would feel themselves to have been brought on false
pretences, he dug a hole to hide in and covered himself with earth-but
his one long tooth projected above the soil.

It will be remembered that a cock had been left in the house when
everything else was removed; and this cock now began to crow,
"*Kokoikoko-o-o!* Father's tooth is outside!"

The guests, waiting outside, wondered. "Hallo! Listen to that cock. What
is he saying?" "Come! Go in and see what Marimira is doing in there, for
the sun is setting, and we have far to go!" So they searched the house,
and, coming upon the tooth, dug him up and dragged him outside, where
they killed, roasted, and ate him-all but his head. While doing so they
sang:

"Him who shall eat the head, we will eat him too."

After a while one of them bit off a piece from the head; the others at
once fell upon him and ate him. This went on till only one was left. He
fixed up a rope to make a swing and climbed into it, but the rope was
not strong enough; it broke, and he fell into the fire. "And he began to
cry out, '*Maye! Maye!* \[Mother!\] I'm dying!' And he started to chew
himself there in the fire," and so perished.

This incident is somewhat puzzling; it may be a misunderstood report of
an episode in another story \[1\] in which the ogre tries to trick his
victim by inducing him to get into a swing fixed above a boiling
cauldron, but is caught in his own trap. The swing is quite a popular
amusement in Africa, wherever children can get a rope fixed to a
convenient branch of a tree.

Meanwhile the *chitsimbakazi* had reached Mbodze's home. A little bird
flew on ahead, perched outside the house, and sang:

"Mother, sweep the yard! Mbodze is coming!"

The mother said, "just listen to that bird! What does it say? It is
telling us to sweep the yard, because Mbodze is coming." So she set to
work at once, and presently the sprite arrived and said, "Let me have a
bath, and then I will give you your daughter."

She gave her a bath and rubbed her with oil and cooked gruel for her.
The. sprite said, "Don't pour it into a big dish for me; put it into a
coconut shell," which the woman did. When the *chitsimbakazi* had eaten
she unstopped the bamboo and let Mbodze out, to the great joy of the
whole family, who could not do enough to show their gratitude.

## The Were-wolf Husband

The ogre as bridegroom appears in a Chaga story, of a kind found all
over Africa,\[2\] and told to warn girls against being overhard to
please in the choice of a husband. But the wooer is not so often called
an ogre, as such, as a lion, a hyena, or a leopard, who has assumed a
man's shape for the time being. Some of these stories are more detailed
than the one I am about to give, and will come better into the next
chapter.

There was once a girl who refused to marry.\[3\] Her  
  
\[1. Steere, *Swahili Tales*, p. 383: "The Spirit and the Sultan's Son."

2\. Thus by the Ewe on the Gold Coast, the Ikom, the Hausa, and others.
English-speaking people in Sierra Leone call the ogre the Devil (the
story is headed "Marry the Devil, there's the Devil to pay"), but such a
person is not known to Africans, unless they have heard of him from
white people.

3 Gutmann, Volksbuch, p.75\]

parents, too, discouraged all wooers who presented themselves, as they
said they would not give their daughter to any common man. (This is an
unusual touch: in most tales of this kind it is the parents who
remonstrate and the girl who is wilful.)

On a certain day the sword-dance was going on at this girl's village,
and men came from the whole countryside to take part in it. Among the
dancers there appeared a tall and handsome young man, wearing a broad
ring like a halo round his head, who drew all eyes by his grace and
noble bearing. The maiden fell in love with him at first sight, and her
parents also approved of him. The dancing went on for several days,
during which time she scarcely took her eyes off him. But one day, as he
happened to turn his back, she caught sight of a second mouth behind his
head, and said to her mother, That man is a *rimu*!" They would not
believe it. " That fine fellow a *rimu*! Nonsense I just you go with him
and let him cat you, that's all!"

The suitor presented himself in due course, and the marriage took place.
After spending some days with the bride's parents the couple left for
their home. But her brothers, knowing the husband to be a *rimu*, felt
uneasy, and followed them, without their knowledge, keeping in the
bushes alongside the path. When they had gone some distance the husband
stopped and said, " Look back and tell me if you can still see the smoke
from your father's hut." She looked, and said that she could. They went
on for another hour or two, and then he asked her if she could see the
hills behind her home. She said yes, and again they went on. At last he
asked her again if she could see the hills, and when he found that she
could not said, What will you do now? I am a *rimu*. Climb up into this
tree and weep your last tears, for you must die!"

But her brothers, watching their chance, shot him with poisoned arrows,
and he died. She came down from the tree and the brothers took her home.
