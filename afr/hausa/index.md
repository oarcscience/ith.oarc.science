This is a collection of Hausa folklore, which is directly sourced from a
Hausa storyteller, and translated by a European academic. This
originally appeared as two volumes, the translation being in the first
one. These West African stories, from what is today is Nigeria, are from
an Islamic background, giving us a look into this important African
storytelling tradition.
