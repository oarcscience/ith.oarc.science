# 16. A story about a test of skill

This story is about a (test of) skill.

A story, a story.

A certain chief begat children, three males. One day his councillors
assembled. He said he himself wished to see the most skilled among them.
There was a huge baobab tree (near) the entrance to the chief's house.
He said he wanted them to mount (their) horses, (and) come (and) show
their skill, where this baobab tree was.

So they mounted their chargers, (and) went far away. The eldest galloped
(and) came, (and) thrust that baobab with (his) spear. The spear went
right through and he followed, passing through the hole made by the
spear, with his horse. And he passed on.

The next to follow the eldest came on. When he was near to the baobab
tree he lifted his horse (on the bit) and jumped the baobab.

When the youngest galloped, he came, (and) pulled up the whole baobab,
roots and all, and came on waving it aloft at his father, and the place
rang with applause.

Now I ask you who excelled among them. If you do not know, that is all.

Off with the rat's head.
