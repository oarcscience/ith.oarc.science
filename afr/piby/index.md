The *Holy Piby* was written by Robert Athlyi Rogers, who founded an
Afrocentric religion in the US and West Indies in the 1920s. Rogers'
religious movement, the Afro Athlican Constructive Church, saw
Ethiopians (in the Biblical sense of Black Africans) as the chosen
people of God, and proclaimed Marcus Garvey, the prominent Black
Nationalist, an apostle. The church preached self-reliance and
self-determination for Africans.

The original is very rare. There are no copies listed in either the
Library of Congress or the University of California catalogs, which is
highly unusual. The Holy Piby was banned in Jamaica and other Caribbean
Islands in the middle and late 1920s. Today the Holy Piby is acclaimed
by many Rastafarians as a primary source. <span id="contents"></span>
