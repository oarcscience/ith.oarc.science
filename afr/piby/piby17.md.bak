### CHAPTER 12

### THE GUIDING LIGHT

Now when Athlyi started for Newark, there appeared a spotlight on the
sleeve of his coat.

When Athlyi saw the light he tried to cover it with his hat but the
light could not be covered.

Then he looked up and yelled joyfully, "It's the light of the Lord.

"Surely it cannot be covered. The light of the Lord our God I shall
follow this day. Indeed I will not stray."

Athlyi journeyed to Newark and the light with him. But when he turned
contrary to the will of God, the light would not follow but stood on
another street.

Now when Athlyi saw the light would not go, he turned and went the way
the light pointed him.

And it came to pass when Athlyi reached the City of Newark he prepared a
house for the Lord our God and when he was making ready for the first
sermon, a little girl opened the door and stared plumply into his face
and uttered "Gaathly?" "Is your name Gaathly?" the shepherd <span

again said "Gaathly," and went out.

Straightway a light flashed and Athlyi looked around. He beheld over the
altar a hand, writing on the wall the name Gaathly.

When Athlyi saw the hand on the wall he became very fearful but
embroiled with joy.

He then rushed into the inner chamber and proclaimed before his wife
Miriam and his daughter Muriel, the name of Gaathly saying, "Behold a
hand wrote it and the child revealed it as the Lord had promised."

From that day unto this the Holy House founded upon the Gospel of God
through Athlyi is known as the Gaathly.
