### CHAPTER 15

### THE BEGGAR

And it came to pass that on the twenty-eighth day of the eighth month of
nineteen hundred and twenty-seven (according to the English years but
the fourteenth year according to the Athlican years) a young man
twenty-two years of age came in to the Gaathly begging for money.

The shepherd looked upon the young man and said, "Thou art in the bloom
of youth and power, but because thou art not of me, ye must beg.

"Go ye, however, through the highways and into comers, even so behind
closed doors and gather men unto me, that they be lifted up from hell
unto salvation.

"Then shall ye not be a beggar of me, but a sower and a reaper in me.

"For as many as believe and walk in me shall be saved. I shall relieve
them of their miseries. I shall banish their sorrows. I shall defend
them.

"I shall be a light in their darkness. I shall raise them up when all
hopes are dead.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

I shall harden my heart against backsliders, the hypocrite, the liar,
and the thief, I despise.

"Be aware of the gospels that are not of God through Ethiopia. For it
shall rob and destroy as many as accept it.

"Verily I say unto you, he that is not of me is not for your salvation.
For I am he whom the Lord, God of Ethiopia, had promised thee from
creation, that ye may stretch forth thy hands direct unto the Father
through me and be saved.

"Before me there was none unto Ethiopia, but with me there is another
and you, in me, in him are one with God; and the offspring of my vein
and the offspring of his vein are cousins.

"Take heed! O ye children of Ethiopia. For I Athlyi zigy sobcok tee.
Whosoever cometh after me and is not of me is not for your salvation,
but seeketh to destroy your civilization in God through me.

"Prophets shall rise and wise men shall spring out of you, but they that
build not upon this foundation in me, in righteousness are deceivers of
you.

"They shall come up to you with unjust gospels, which seeketh to destroy
the offsprings of our father, Ham, doctrines which were before me.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

"But it shall be as a man pleading with an electrician to go back to the
tallow candle age, but the electrician shall laugh him to scorn.

"For I am greater than all gospels that were before my coming. I am
richer. I am higher. Test me and be ye convinced that I, in the bosom of
the God of Justice, have laid a foundation sufficient to hold all the
builders that cometh after me in righteousness.

I shall banish the devil. I shall clear up his hell and it shall bloom
like a garden of brimigen. Then shall the rivers of peace flow out and
the children of all the earth shall sit around the table of salvation in
the house of God enjoying life the splendor of true love and justice in
me. For I am not myself, but God in me unto you.

"But verily I say unto you, I shall cut my heaven from him that knoweth
and doeth not according the gospel.

"The wise will prepare for battle even though there may not be any
fight.

"The fool will quarrel but he that quarrels with a fool is a damn fool.
Hear me, oh thou Athlyians! Be ye wise and live I go to prepare a place
for you beyond this heaven.

"Whosoever walketh in my blood within the principles of this gospel
shall dwell with me in <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> heaven
everlasting, but he that walketh another way shall not find me."

"I will blow my trumpet throughout the kingdom of Athlyi in Africa,"
saith the lord our God, "and my people the Athlyians shall blow it unto
the world.

"Then shall the inhabitants of the earth respect me, for I am a God of
salvation, a conqueror of evil."

And it came to pass that Athlyi issued an order saying," A real minister
of Athlicanity must bear a diploma from the Athlican School of
Athlicology and the graduation process shall embody ordination.

"God be with you my beloved. Let there be unity in spirit while ye are
absent one from another. Wheresoever it is one Athlyian there is the
shepherd in him, and whatsoever heareth an Athlyian, heareth also the
Shepherd, and whatsoever an Athlyian seeth, seeth the Shepherd also, for
the Athlyians are an amalgation instituted by God which no man can
separate."
