### CHAPTER 13

### ATHLYI BLEEDS

And it came to pass on the third Saturday night of the seventh month of
the year nineteen hundred and twenty-seven, the word of the Lord came to
Athlyi saying, "Tomorrow, thou shalt with thine own blood set apart the
Athlyians from the rest of the world's inhabitants, that I may glory in
them and nourish them."

I shall send my angels and they shall dwell among the Athlyians and
teach them new things. Verily, the women as well as the men shall
develop great in science."

"Fear not, because of the inventions of today," saith the Lord, "for
greater shall come out of my people, the Athlyians. They shall school
Ethiopia. Consequently the sons and daughters of Ham shall be a burning
light unto all the earth."

On the next day which was Sunday, while the Shepherd Athlyi preached
before the people who came out to Gaathly, the spirit of the Lord came
upon him and he then bit the top of his fingers, so that the blood
spouted.

Then with his blood he marked a line between the Athlyians and the rest
of the earth's inhabitants as the Lord had commanded him.

Then came forth the Shepherdmiss Muriel, daughter of Athlyi, who fell
upon her knees saying, "Let thy blood fall upon me that I bear it
through the ages." The shepherd let his blood fall upon her.

Then came forward also Sister Mary Howard, [Stear](errata.htm#4.md) of the
Nourishers and Saints. She bound up the Shepherd's wound.

"I am a witness of this blood," the Stear uttered, but the Shepherd
answered saying, "All Athlyians are witnesses of this blood, and I shall
be their Shepherd forever. Even in the spirit I shall be with them and I
shall be quick to answer those who called upon me in sincerity; but
those who seeketh me empty in heart shall not find me.

"Happy shall be the aged who sacrifice the days of his youth within this
blood. His tree shall grow mighty in the green pasture. He shall not
want, but flourish."

"But verily I say unto you, only through concretation can anyone come
beyond this blood and become an Athlyian.

"For unto the Athlyians, there is but one God, one Law, and one
Shepherd."

"I am the lover of Justice, the light and guide unto perfect salvation
saith Athlyi."

"Whosoever believeth in me shall in life enjoy salvation and inherit
eternal happiness in the kingdom of God who sent me.

"But he that believeth not in me shall be a victim of slavery and
oppression at the hands of Europe all the days of his unbelief.

"For he that receiveth me not, his heart despiseth the gift of God, the
father, who sent me."

"For thus saith the Lord our God, I shall not send
[Japheth](errata.htm#5.md) to Ham, neither will I send to Shem,
[Japheth](errata.htm#6.md). But in time of peril I shall appoint from among
them a savior whose word shall reign forever."

"They that refuseth their own in me, shall find no other. But slavery
and oppression shall overcome them. They shall live in disgrace and die
in dishonor."

"I am the almighty powerhouse," said the Lord, "the spring of salvation,
but a people without a king has no connection with me."

"Fear not, O ye Athlyians, for I, Athlyi, am your Shepherd. I am not of
the flesh but of the Spirit of God, the Father, who sent me to gather
the children of Ethiopia that they be saved from peril. In the bosom of
the Lord I shall forever <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> hold my grip,
therefore thou shalt be an everlasting light and power upon the earth."
