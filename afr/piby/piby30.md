# THE SHEPHERD'S COMMAND BY ATHLYI

First: Let all literature for the instruction of Athlyian's children be
of a constructive nature looking towards Ethiopia.

Second: Let the eye of a star be the eye of the Shepherd and the ear of
a star be the ear of the Shepherd, for they are his stars.

Third: Fight for that which is yours and ye shall obtain it, for there
is nothing hard against the power of God.
