### CHAPTER IV

##### SACRIFICE

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> have already seen that the earliest
form of human sacrifice was associated in the minds of men with killing
the god himself. The divine King of Congo was put to death by his
successor. In the Fiji Islands old people are hurried alive. When a king
of Kabonga is near his end the magicians quietly strangle him. Certain
tribes of East Africa put their kings to death as soon as wrinkles or
grey hairs appear. <span id="fr_64"></span>[\*](#fn_64.md) A modification
of the custom of king- killing was introduced when the expedient of
temporary kings was reached. These could be put to death at stated
intervals. We have met with examples of this in Sofala and Calicut.
Ancient Babylonia affords another illustration. There, when the time
drew near that the king should be put to death, he abdicated for a few
days, during which a temporary monarch reigned and suffered in his
stead. "A prisoner condemned to death was dressed in the king's robes,
seated on the king's throne, allowed to issue whatever commands he
pleased, to eat, drink, and enjoy himself, and to lie with the king's
concubines. But at the end of the

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

five days he was stripped of his royal robes, scourged and
crucified." <span id="fr_65"></span>[\*](#fn_65.md) This same custom,
softened down, is observed in Cambodia, where the king abdicates
annually for a few days. The substitute performs all functions of State,
and receives the revenues for the time he reigns. At the close of his
brief term of office he goes and does homage to the king, and then, as
his last act, orders the elephants to trample the "mountain of rice."
This is a large scaffold hung round with rice-sheaves. When they are
trampled down the people gather up the rice, each man taking home a
portion to mix with his seed-corn and so secure a good harvest. <span
id="fr_66"></span>[†](#fn_66.md)

Once the idea of substitution was reached, sacrifice as an institution
would develop rapidly, and the curious thing is, that a trace of the
original system of killing the god has remained to tell the world of an
older and ruder conception of divinity. To the ancient man-god it was so
convenient to have another take his place, that we can fancy the
innovation being hailed with joy by the ruling castes, who by it were
freed from the uncertainties of popular discontent and the accidental
advent of signs of decay. But the doctrine of substitution had its
disadvantages, and these in course of time would be felt and have
far-reaching effects. Under the old order men were accustomed to offer
homage to the living king; and their supreme and final act of worship
was when he was put to death that his spirit might enter his successor
as the creative, fructifying and preserving power of the world.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Worshippers who
associated such ideas with sacrifice could not be prevented from viewing
the real victim offered, even as a substitute, as in some sort divine by
inherent right. If divine by inherent right, the question of the
spirit's return to the real king might be raised. Advanced thinkers
would ask whether the spirit of the god, or the god-life, left the king
to enter the substitute, slave or criminal, when the former abdicated,
and if so, whether other causes might not lead to the same result? Could
a successful revolt, headed by a bold and fearless man, secure to the
usurper the god-life the moment the king was deposed or slain? If so,
revolt and revolution might be, if not lawful, at all events possible,
without the collapse of the world. Again, was there a true transference
of divinity to the temporary king, his mean and common spirit taking the
place of the god in the hereditary monarch? If so, might not men of
ambition become substitutes, and at the last act rally their friends in
order to retain the divine spirit permanently? Would the substitute's
spirit, which dwelt in the king, give place to the returning god-spirit,
"poor fluttering thing," after the victim was slain? With such questions
pressing for solution—and for a question to be raised among savage men
is to find an answer—kings and their advisers would naturally seek to
foster faith in an hereditary principle of divinity apart from the
actual sacrifice of the god himself. We call this the divine right of
kings. When this conception of hereditary divinity was reached, men
would sacrifice to the king-god as a personal and hereditary spirit—a
spirit dwelling

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

in the king in virtue of his office, or whom he represented to
men—rather than to the spirit of creative and reproductive energy and
vegetation which, in an earlier and ruder age was undoubtedly the
savage's conception of his divine king. He was divine, not because he
was a personal immortal spirit, but because in him was contained that
spirit or power which ensured the orderly continuance of the course of
nature.

The sacrifice made in former days of the king himself by the priests,
would, under the advance of thought, be made in the first instance to
the king, and the more costly the sacrifices, and the more elaborate the
ritual, the greater would be the virtue, and by consequence his
influence and power. Kings attaining to great eminence as conquerors and
administrators would be greatly honoured with sacrificial offerings
during their lives, and revered after their death. Their successors,
especially if weaker men, would, in order to secure the continued
allegiance of their people, pay respect to their memory. This, without
any revolution of thought, would take the form of offerings, prayer, and
sacrifice. Then the spirit of the departed king visited his successor in
dreams and visions. At such times he entered his person; hence the
common saying, "He got the spirit of his father." By such means he kept
his successor informed of his wishes, which were respected and obeyed;
thus enabling a weakling to retain power which otherwise would have
dropped from his nerveless grasp. That this is no phantasy is clearly
proved by beliefs common among

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Africans at the
present day. A Kaffir who has a remarkable dream will begin to tell it
next day by saying: "My father's soul was within me last night."
Prophets claim to be god-possessed, or, in other words, to have within
them the souls of departed priests or chiefs. In this case they work
themselves into, or through long practice assume, a state of semi-coma.
During their paroxysms and the succeeding unconsciousness they are
treated as objects of worship; in other words, they are truly divine for
the time being.

Let us now proceed to illustrate these general statements by an
examination of the sacrificial system common throughout the continent,
and in doing so it will be well to select a few places, widely apart, as
typical illustrations. The natives of South Africa discontinued human
sacrifices before they had much contact with Europeans, and, being of
mixed origin, we study their religious institutions at a disadvantage.
But an examination of their system of thought leads us up to a time when
their rites and sacrifices differed in no essential from what is common
to the vast majority of the tribes inhabiting the continent, from 10° of
north latitude to the farthest promontory of the south.

When the course of nature is not to a Kaffir's mind, as during drought,
floods, sickness among men or cattle, misfortune in war, failure in
hunting or a visitation of locusts, he offers propitiatory sacrifices to
the offended deities. Each man sacrifices to his own ancestors; each
clan, through the magician, to the heads of the clan; the tribe to the
ancestors

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

of its chief; but in the latter case the sacrifice can only be offered
by the tribal priest, or by the chief in those rare instances in which
he is not only the ruler but the high priest also. I am not aware of any
ruler at present in South Africa being his own high priest, but the
combination is not unknown. The chief Makoma used to offer the
sacrifices on important occasions himself.

Here we have the curious anomaly of sacrifices to minor divinities made
by ordinary householders, while those to superior deities can only be
offered by the high priest if they are to be acceptable to the god.
Those whose function it is to stand between men and the unseen, approach
divinity with an offering for men's sins. They stand there as
representatives or substitutes, taking the place of the worshippers. For
a tribal offering may be made by the priest without a muster of the
tribe or even the army. The sacred functions belong to sacred persons,
and they determine how and when these are to be performed, and only obey
certain general principles, without which no sacrifice is a genuine
offering. One of these is that all sacrifices must be made by fire.
Unless portions of the animal slain are burned, there has been no true
offering, and the gods view the whole ceremony in grief and anger.
Another is, that the animal must be honestly come by. A man may purchase
a sacrifice, but this is rare, and, I think, regarded as irregular; but
no man would sacrifice a beast that had been stolen. The most acceptable
sacrifice is that which is a man's very own. There is also one phrase in
the

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

dedicatory prayer which is never omitted. It is this: "We do not offer
the dead; it is blood. We offer life. Behold, O ye hosts." During the
time when the sacrifice is offered the priest stands as intercessor for
the people in room of the chief His orders are obeyed as the chief's,
and his deliverances accepted as the very oracles of God.

It may at first sight be difficult to connect this doctrine of
propitiatory sacrifice with that of substitution, as we have seen that
in the case of the killing of the temporary king. And if this
[propitiatory](errata.htm#0.md) system of sacrifice were our only guide, it
would be impossible to do so. But there is another system, complete in
all its parts and distinct from the idea of propitiation, observed by
the same people alongside of this doctrine. It is that of thank-offering
and sacrificial thanksgiving. For every supposed benefit a man makes a
thank-offering. It may be but a single grain of corn, or even an article
of no value, as a tuft of grass, but it is never omitted. When a father
offers a sheep as a thank-offering for the birth of a child, his idea is
not only to recompense the soul of his father for good offices by so
much burning fat, but to "give to those who were before" the keeping of
the child's soul; giving the soul to them in homage and thankfulness.
This is undoubtedly the dedicatory offering of the soul by the sacrifice
of a sheep as a substitute for the firstborn, a custom with which we are
only too familiar elsewhere. Besides, the first child of a widow who
re-marries, should her husband have fallen in war, is put to death:
offered to the gods

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

as "the child of the assegai." <span id="fr_67"></span>[\*](#fn_67.md) In
making thank-offerings for good offices a man adds to the portion of the
sacrifice that is burned something from his own person, and men have
been known to cut off a finger or toe for this purpose, to enhance the
value of the offering. The Israelitish practice of shaving, as a sign of
having made a vow or formed a resolve, is not unknown. <span
id="fr_68"></span>[†](#fn_68.md) Adopting peculiar garments as a
head-dress, in token of anything remarkable having happened to a man, is
common.

When a tribe is at war, or preferably before entering upon hostilities,
if an enemy can be caught he is put to death. The warriors eat his heart
raw. <span id="fr_69"></span>[‡](#fn_69.md) Various parts of his body,
supposed to be the seat of particular virtues, are used in the
preparation of the compound known as war medicine, while shreds of fat
from his kidneys are burned in the fire. Much the same is done in the
case of a slain enemy who has distinguished himself for bravery and
feats of strength. <span id="fr_70"></span>[§](#fn_70.md) This, though the
people do not say so, is undoubtedly an offering made to the gods. The
explanation given is, "Our people always did so," and that war medicine,
without the fat burning in the fire while it is being prepared, would
not act. <span id="fr_71"></span>[\*\*](#fn_71.md) For the true
significance of such acts we must seek an explanation, not from the
people, who can give none, but from analogy,. and their resemblance to
other acts performed by the same people, or by others having customs in
common with them. The fat burned in the fire.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

when oxen are sacrificed in time of war, drought, or the great annual
festival of firstfruits, is avowedly a gift to the gods, <span
id="fr_72"></span>[\*](#fn_72.md) the odour of which they inhale; <span
id="fr_73"></span>[†](#fn_73.md) and when we find the burning of human fat
in almost identical circumstances—*i.e.*, war—and the preparation of a
magic decoction into which calcined human flesh largely enters, and on
which depends its efficacy, the conclusion is forced upon us that here
we have the last lingering traces of human sacrifice. Nor is this the
only use made of portions of the human body in connection with the
religious ritual of the people. The dried fingers of a man's hand is an
essential portion of a magician's outfit when he goes to curse his
chief's enemies. <span id="fr_74"></span>[‡](#fn_74.md) Wizards deal
largely in human flesh. <span id="fr_75"></span>[§](#fn_75.md)

The multiplication of sacrifices is acceptable to all the gods <span
id="fr_76"></span>[\*\*](#fn_76.md) of heathendom, and one case is on
record in which tribes killed every hoof of cattle and destroyed every
peck of corn to secure the favour of their ancestors. True, the priest
who ordered this to be done promised that there should be a general
resurrection of both ancestors and cattle on a given day, that of full
moon; but this only adds to the completeness of the faith reposed in his
predictions as the oracles of God. On the appointed day thousands of men
and women gathered for a moon dance; folds had been erected for the
cattle that were to rise; stores for the corn which men were to gather;
houses for the ancestors who were to come clad in armour. In honour of
the great event

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

the sun was to rise double on the resurrection morning. During that
night sounds of revelry were heard far and near, but when day came the
sun rose alone while his companion lagged behind. Black fear entered
every heart. Starvation stared men in the face. Umlanjeni declared they
had mistaken the day of full moon, and urged a resumption of the dance
with assured triumph on the morrow. But men had no heart left, and the
next twenty-four hours were but a sorry time. Once more the sun rose in
lonely majesty, and men's worst fears were realised; the gods had
betrayed them. By such experiences did men learn to differentiate the
natural and supernatural.

When a chief dies, one at least, or it may be many persons are put to
death for having killed the king by the exercise of the unlawful art of
witchcraft; but this falls rather under magic and divination than under
sacrifice. The only connection it has with the latter is, that among
most tribes the chief is never allowed "to go alone." A few of his
wives, servants and slaves must be killed to accompany him and attend to
his wants. It may also be noted that the ruling chief may order, even in
the case of accusations of having caused his father's death, the
substitution of an ox for the condemned person. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[\*](#fn_77.md) The ox is sacrificed, not killed, as a
criminal substitute for the wizard, who is set at liberty. This seems to
point to the victims of witchcraft, whom we generally regard as
criminals under native law, being in reality a sacrifice to the

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

gods. The substitution of an animal, which is killed as a sacrifice, is
common in cases where the patient has recovered, though causing sickness
with intent to kill is a capital crime.

When we leave South Africa and pass into the Lake region all doubt about
substitutionary human sacrifice is set at rest. If a Wayao murderer is
caught he may make compensation by giving a few slaves to be put to
death, so that they may accompany the murdered man, taking his place to
attend upon him. <span id="fr_78"></span>[\*](#fn_78.md) Should the
murderer escape, one of his relatives is caught and treated as if he
were the murderer. The object here is not so much the punishment of
crime as an offering to the deceased, whose spirit would naturally be
enraged at his own relatives were they not to pay due honour to it by
sending, either the murderer to be his slave, or such of his relatives
or slaves as may make amends for his absence. Of departed spirits some
have considerable influence among the gods. Matanga of the Wayao has
many powerful servants, and arranges most of the details of the spirit
world in that region. <span id="fr_79"></span>[†](#fn_79.md) He is
capricious and easily offended, but can be coaxed by judicious flattery.
Men having ghostly relations with him, or with lesser divinities through
him, can compound for personal service by substitution. So, instead of
betaking themselves to the land of shades, as in duty bound, when a
relative to whom they owe allegiance dies, they send a number of slaves
as their representatives to do duty by proxy.

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

But it is when we enter the territories of powerful kings, like Mr.
Stanley's friend Mtesa, that we can study primitive sacrificial
institutions to best advantage. Broken and scattered tribes like those
round Lake Nyassa, or bands of marauding warriors like the ancestors of
the tribes inhabiting South Africa, do not retain the institutions of
their forefathers in their unblemished splendour. In the one case,
poverty, oppression, and the constant fear of death or captivity, slowly
but surely undermine and modify original institutions. In the latter,
daring warriors learn by degrees to defy even the gods, or at least
neglect them. That stout old Roman who threw the sacred chickens into
the sea was not a bolder reformer than the Zulu monarch who gave battle
to the army of Moselekatse when all the omens of heaven and earth warned
him of defeat. More fortunate than the Roman, a decisive victory saved
both his own head and his country's freedom.

Among the Wagogo the simplest form of human sacrifice is when the
magician comes to the palace with two bunches of grass dipped in the
blood of a victim slain quietly and without ostentation. <span
id="fr_80"></span>[\*](#fn_80.md) These he lays on the lintel or threshold,
where they are touched by the king, and so offered to the gods. Of these
gods the principal is Makusa, who, as we have seen, claims a right
higher than the king over the Lake, as the embodiment of the powers of
nature. He it is that is personified by the Lubare, who is the real
object of worship. Makusa as a sort of Neptune is but a chief
Lubare. <span id="fr_81"></span>[†](#fn_81.md) He enters

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

a person; that person is god, and to him sacrifices are offered. Closely
bound up with the worship of the Lubare is the care of the place where
the king's predecessors are kept, or rather of these predecessors
themselves, for the Lubare holds converse with the dead as with the
living. <span id="fr_82"></span>[\*](#fn_82.md)

Associated with, or subordinate to the Lubare are Nende, Kajangeyewe,
and Kubuka, who are a kind of national guardian spirits. These appear in
persons who are god-possessed, and such persons are always accompanied
by magicians, priests, and executioners; <span
id="fr_83"></span>[†](#fn_83.md) that is to say, those who slay victims for
the sacrifices. The god-possessed person has but to demand a victim,
when a wayfarer is caught, bound, beheaded, and offered in sacrifice.
Every person holding the sacred office of priest or magician claims to
have the spirit of the king dwelling in him, or at least visiting him at
intervals. <span id="fr_84"></span>[‡](#fn_84.md) The head wife of every
great man's harem is called "Kuda Lubare " <span
id="fr_85"></span>[§](#fn_85.md)—*i.e.*, slave of the spirit, meaning one
in whom the god dwells. The same terms are applied to the child of a
woman long barren, and who offered sacrifice and prayed to the Lubare
for offspring. This is a true dedication of issue at the shrine when the
offering is made. Of this we have an illustration, in widely different
circumstances, when Hannah said: "O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed
look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and give unto thine handmaid a
man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his
life, <span id="fr_86"></span>[\*\*](#fn_86.md)

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

which vow Eli, worthy man, thought to be but the ravings of a drunken
votary.

Mention has been made of the tombs of the king's predecessors. This is a
large hut, of comparatively slight construction, and needing frequent
repair or renewal. Connected with it is a large college of sorceresses,
whose chief duty it is to tend the spirits of the departed and guard the
sacred place. When the king decides that it must be repaired, he issues
his orders to the members of this college, who see the work done, and
report when it is completed. Offerings must now be made to their
majesties as a kind of solatium for the trouble they were put to, owing
to the disturbance in connection with the repair of their quarters. As
many as two thousand victims have been offered on such occasions. These
are to the Lubare as the earth god, rather than to the kings, for the
Lubare is the genius of the country, the object of universal worship. So
general is the worship of Lubare that no one leaves his hut in the
morning without first throwing out an offering, as a wisp of grass,
saying, "Here, Lubare, take that. <span id="fr_87"></span>[\*](#fn_87.md)

To them Katonga, or Creator, and Lubare mean the same, for every
phenomenon is subject to Lubare. Crops, famine, food, rain, thunder,
storms on the lake, day, night; everything in nature has its Lubare, and
still Lubare is one and not many. It is the spirit of Makusa, who is all
and is everywhere—a kind of universal deification of nature as animate.
When sacrifices are offered to the Lubare,

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

as on the completion of repairs of the "house of the king's ancestors"
or the death of a great man, the method of procuring victims is at once
simple and sufficient. If victims were selected by choice from the
sub-tribes and clans, difficulties of no ordinary kind would be met with
in the case of a sudden demand for a parcel of five hundred or a
thousand; if chosen by lot, expedients would be adopted to avoid the
ordeal. All these inconveniences are avoided by the executioners, of
which a small army is kept, posting themselves on the great highways
approaching the capital and seizing travellers on their way to the
palace. At such times the gods send the proper victims, and when a
sufficient number has been caught the sacrifices are offered. These
victims go as royal messengers, or more properly pages, to attend on the
king's ancestors.

Turning to West Africa, where all religious institutions are modified by
Fetish, the systems at first seem distinct, not only in details, but in
original conception of what is due to divinity. A closer examination
shows that the conceptions of Central and West Africa regarding the
unseen world are substantially the same, and that the intention in
sacrifice is the same. From killing the god they passed to substitution,
thence to propitiatory sacrifice and thank-offerings. Each kingdom has
its own particular customs and yearly festivals, presenting an infinite
variety of detail, but in their general features the same; marking the
steady advance of thought from the rude conceptions of

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

the days when the world was young, to a conception of divinity akin to
Pantheism, and passing over into that system at various points.

In Gomba, when a sacrifice is offered, the victim is paraded about the
streets after the manner of the Lord Mayor's show. He is decked out in
finery, adorned with jewels, and wearing a crown and other insignia of
royalty. From being a slave, he becomes something more than a king; he
becomes a demigod. He may do whatever he pleases and have all he
fancies, should his tastes be like those of the damsel who asked the
Baptist's head. Nothing is denied him, as long as it does not imply his
escaping his doom at the appointed hour. As he parades the streets he
receives and accepts the homage due to a god, and when slain, men
prostrate themselves before the body. The body itself is taken up by the
women, decorated and honoured as divine, and finally treated more as god
than an offering to a god. The object seems to be, not so much an
offering to the god as the killing of the god himself by substitutionary
sacrifice. The King of Ashantee, when holding the great annual Fetish
festival, calls it the festival of his fathers, <span
id="fr_88"></span>[\*](#fn_88.md) and is himself for the time regarded as
the personification of the gods. His actions are not so much that of
their delegate, which he claims at all times to be, but their actions,
their words, and their very movements. If the king rises, the gods
stand; if he reclines, they sleep; should he dance, they too caper about
with the movements of his arms and legs. For the festival

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

he arrays himself with scrupulous care and with extraordinary grandeur.
Whatever of wealth and splendour his palace holds is wrapped round his
person or attached to his garments. He is literally loaded with precious
gems and the most costly ornaments. The drums that are to accompany him
in procession are decorated with human skulls, while soldiers, priests
and executioners deck themselves with what is acceptable to the gods and
on which they love to gaze. During the festival, sheep, goats, and human
beings are indiscriminately sacrificed. The king, during the pageant
procession, is carried by the priests, and must on no account walk or
even touch the ground. He receives homage on behalf of his fathers, and
it is impossible to determine how much the intention is to sacrifice to
them or to the king himself. They reside in him as the god in the
Fetish, and in virtue of such possession he is divine.

But the great festival of the year is the yam festival. Before the day
appointed for the king to eat fresh yams there are processions, reviews,
dances, and general rejoicing, in which the king takes an active part.
On the fifth day of the festival a human sacrifice is offered, or, to be
correct, a "messenger" is despatched by the king to the spirit world. As
this messenger is not designed for any of his ancestors, nor charged
with any commission to them, the inference is that like the Khond
sacrifices to Tari, the sacrifice is to the world of life and
reproduction. After the sacrifice is made, the king eats fresh yams from
a dish held by the chief cook, who keeps stirring the contents with a
gold fork,

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

while the nobles stand before him uncovered. <span
id="fr_89"></span>[\*](#fn_89.md) At this and the palm-wine festival the
honours of adoration are all done to the king, and the progress of the
festival is consecrated by any stray person about the palace doors being
seized and slain as an act of reverence to his majesty. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[†](#fn_90.md) The treatment of such victims after
execution is thus described by Kühne, who frequently witnessed such
scenes.

"One took a finger, another an arm or foot, and whoever obtained the
head danced in crazy ecstasy, painted its forehead red and white, kissed
it on the mouth, laughing, or with mocking words of pity, and finally
hung it round his neck or seized it with his teeth. Another took out the
heart and washed it, carried it in one hand and a loaf of maize bread in
the other, and walked about as if he were eating his breakfast.

"In the evening they brought the skulls of their most important enemies
from the mausoleum at Bantama, and placed them, in the stillness of the
night, in front of the Fetish. Among them was the skull of Sir Charles
Macarthy, kept in a brass basin and covered with a white cloth. . . . .
On the next day all laws were abrogated, and every one drinking freely
was permitted to do what was good in his own eyes. Even funerals were
celebrated for those who had suffered capital punishment."

Here we have, in the extreme west, the common Pondo custom of the
abrogation of all law at the feast of firstfruits. From the last
sentence, which Kühne does not explain, it is to be inferred that

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

holding funerals for persons executed is, according to Ashantee notions,
the farthest extreme of license to which men can go.

The festival of Bantama affords the king an opportunity of sending a
messenger to his fathers. He delivers his charge slowly and
deliberately, as if giving a diplomatic commission, and then the
executioners cut off the victim's head, a knife having been previously
run through his cheek and left there. Should the king remember anything
he wished to say after the victim is slain, he orders another to be
brought, and sends him with a hurried postscript lest his ancestors
should be offended at the matter not being referred to in the original
communication.

Bantama is the resting-place or mausoleum of the departed kings, and
when Kühne was in Ashantee there were fourteen of the king's
predecessors within its walls. It is a long building, divided into small
cells, each of which contains the skeleton of a king; <span
id="fr_91"></span>[\*](#fn_91.md) the coffins containing these, as well as
the skeletons themselves, being connected together with gold wires. Each
cell contains such articles as the tenant loved best during his life. At
the festival of Bantama the skeletons are placed on chairs in the
audience hall to receive the royal visitor. This they do in the order of
seniority. The king on entering offers each skeleton food, and as he
does so, passing from one to another, the victim selected for each is
decapitated in the approved manner by the executioners. During the
succeeding night, and after the monarchs are returned to their cells and
coffins,

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

victims are slain at intervals by beat of drum or sound of horn. With
the regularity of the minute-gun, the horn sounds a double blast, which
means "death"; then three rapid blasts, which signify an order to cut
off a victim's head; followed by one long blast to tell that the head
has dropped. When the building needs repair, the king pays it a visit of
inspection, after which the same ritual as we saw among the Wagogo is
observed, the victims being counted by hundreds. Should the king dance
with his wives, a messenger must be sent to his fathers to explain why
he is at that particular time engaged in the light pastime. <span

But it is not necessary to go so far afield as Ashantee to find
illustration of messages being sent to the spirit world. My father, who
over seventy years ago resided for some years in the Highlands of
Perthshire, used to tell how at that time the people of Glenlyon and
Glendochart charged their dying relatives with messages beyond the
grave, and that people came long distances to ask, as an extreme favour,
that their wishes should be made known "beyond" about certain
particulars, one of the most common requests being to explain away shady
transactions: "If you meet such an one, tell him how we are, and all
that is going on. I gave every penny he left to his daughter. Mind you
tell him the dun horse, which I kept to get a better price for, died."
Such were the commissions entrusted to the dying by pious Calvinists as
late as the second decade of the present century;

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

commissions from which even elders of the kirk were not exempt. If this
may happen in the green tree of Puritanism, what may not be done in the
dry tree of Paganism.

In Dahomey the customs observed are in their main characteristics
identical with those of Ashantee and other West African kingdoms. One
peculiarity of Dahomeyan religion is—and in this, so far as I know, it
is singular—that the Fetish priest is supposed to be able to visit the
regions of the dead in *propria persona*, as the substitute or
representative of the living, and there act for them as if they were
themselves present in the land of shades.  <span
id="fr_93"></span>[\*](#fn_93.md) For example, a man falls ill and believes
that he is being warned by some ancestral spirit that his presence is
required beyond the bourne. He consults the priest, who on receipt of a
suitable fee agrees to descend and make reconciliation on his behalf, so
that he may continue to enjoy the upper air for a further period. When
this is done the patient recovers; if not, he is killed by evil persons;
the spirits never called at all, for the intervention of the priest is,
within limits, effectual in all cases when the matter is in the hands of
the gods. But this leads us to the verge of the doctrine of devils,
which is an advanced form of savage religious thought; the worship of
devils being a late development as compared with that of the beneficent
gods. After spirits were multiplied, men, in seasons of drought and
times of disaster and stress of circumstances, would endeavour to
conciliate the demon that

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

brought calamity. Hence it is that demon worship is always propitiatory,
while the worship of the gods is devotional and sympathetic, as in
thank-offerings and tokens of goodwill and fellowship towards the
unseen, whether regarded as personal or as the earth-god, nature, the
mother of all. When a king of Dahomey dies he must enter the lower world
in such regal state as became his dignity while he lived. The number of
victims is almost incredible in order to make a grand procession. During
his life he sends substitutes and messengers to spirit-land on the most
slender pretext, or on no pretext at all.

Similar illustrations of the doctrine of substitution by sacrifice might
be given from the observances of American Indians, South Sea Islanders,
ancient Mexicans, and the Teutonic peoples of Europe. In tracing the
system we have seen how the original practice of killing the god, as the
spirit of vegetation and creative energy, passed into the form of
substitution. Even in propitiatory sacrifice we see the same idea of the
earth spirit reappearing whenever we can catch a glimpse of society
under primitive conditions. Sacrifices to kings or Fetish are more to
the earth-goddess than to the object to which they are immediately
presented; that is, to the powers of nature as in vegetation and
reproduction generally. This points back to the time when the divine
element of natural force resided in kings, and was sacrificed to ensure
a new resurrection with the opening year. Our inquiry has led u away
from that original conception of primitive

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

man to a more elaborate system of thought, which, gradually expanding,
included within its range factors and forces, spirits personal and
impersonal, and conceptions of man himself, of which the earlier
philosophy took no account. To understand the further development of
human thought, and how spirits came to be classified as good and bad, we
must consider the restrictions under which divine and sacred persons
were placed, and the reasons for such restrictions so far as these may
be discovered.
