### CHAPTER XI

##### ACTS OF DEVOTION—MYTHS

<span class="smallcaps">To</span> the savage who is constantly
surrounded with spiritual beings, and whose life is dependent on
securing their continued favour, no actions can be performed without a
religious significance. He has not arrived at the idea of natural law
apart from agents which regulate phenomena. To these agents he owes
allegiance, because of the benefits he receives at their hands, and
according to his conceptions of their wants and wishes, their tastes and
fancies, will his life and actions be ordered. At first sight it would
appear as if the whole business of religion were left to its avowed
professors, for these are in evidence in connection with every event
which happens. But there could be no greater error that to conclude that
the magician's vocation represents the domestic religious life of the
people. We may take it as a general rule that the magician's services
are required only in connection with what is unusual in village life, as
births, marriages, deaths, accidents, evil omens or any circumstance the
meaning of which may be doubtful. The religion of ordinary life, of
eating and drinking, sleeping and walking, working and talking is
conducted by each individual according to the approved method of the
tribe. In

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

the details of this religion he has been instructed from childhood. His
intellectual faculties lie dormant, but the ritual of life has been
burned into his very soul and become part of his being. An African is no
more likely to forget the minutest detail of private devotion than a
European is to forget to undress when he retires to rest. The chief, as
in the case of the Barotsi, may be a demigod, <span
id="fr_182"></span>[\*](#fn_182.md) and his people flock to his village for
protection during a thunderstorm, but it would be an error to suppose
the Barotsi devoid of a religion and ritual, because of this simple
childish trust in the divinity of the chief. They have a peculiar method
of presenting their offerings. A sacred horn is stuck into the ground,
and when they sacrifice they pour the blood of the victim over the horn.
It is also customary to tie pieces of cloth devoted to the gods round
it. The horn is generally placed in a sacred grove, and is really an
altar to which the worshipper repairs to do his private devotions. <span
id="fr_183"></span>[†](#fn_183.md)

There seems but little religion in a number of love-sick swains
battering one another with slave whips, nor in a maiden running
knife-blades into their thighs, but in a land where the bull is the
emblem of universal life the gods rejoice to see a display of vigour and
virile power. That and heroic endurance are the cardinal virtues. A free
fight with bare sabres for a crown is not consistent with our ideas of
succession, and the suggestion of weapons of war banishes all thoughts
of devotion from our minds. But he who is to sit upon the

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

throne favoured by the gods must, as an act he owes to them, win his
position by giving evidence of the physique as well as mental vigour
necessary for upholding the dignity of the tribe. A chief hanging on to
the toe of old King Chop as he regaled himself with trade rum is not
suggestive of altars and incense, but then King Chop himself was divine
and represented the god-life to his people. To hold his toe was a sacred
office, an act of dutiful obedience to the gods. Who could tell but, as
he poured the "devil water" down his throat, the god spirit might escape
by his toes if these were not held by a sacred person? The Waneka who
wandered in woods with murderous intent during his novitiate believed
himself to be doing a religious duty of the most sacred nature, and that
without this preliminary the gods would never give him wisdom in council
nor strategy in war. By obedience he was qualifying himself to advise
regarding the affairs of gods and men, so different are savage man's
conceptions of qualification for office from ours.

The King of Dahomey while doing homage to the gods would to us appear to
be engaged in a profitable commercial transaction, and but for his being
himself divine there would be a strong suspicion that considerations of
profit influenced him. All the women of the country are his by divine
right. It is an act of divine favour to bestow a wife on a subject, and
when he does bestow one he expects. handsome black mail. It is he who
gives to men all they possess. They must toil for the corn which

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

the king gives through regulating the course of nature, and if they must
pay by toil for the lower gifts, it would be impiety not to labour also
for the higher—that is, for their wives. The king has given his subjects
fecundity; they in return must reward him for the blessing, else the
younger generation of women will be barren.

Thus we see that many acts, which according to Western ideas are far
removed from the region of devotion and worship, are in reality parts of
a life every act, word, and movement of which has a significance in a
religious sense. I have seen natives of Africa perform acts of devotion
before the eyes of men who declared that they had no idea of worship nor
of gods. When a native glances at the sun or moon, he prays; when he
drops a small particle of food on the ground before he begins to eat, he
offers an oblation; if he throws a tuft of grass, a bit of stick, or a
stone, out of his hut door in the morning before he emerges himself, he
has said matins. Nor does he neglect to sing vespers when he turns his
face to the bright constellations overhead be-tore rolling himself up in
his skin blanket for the night. These are all acts of devotion, and
represent forms of worship common among a large proportion of primitive
men. They are performed by each individual on his own account, apart
from the more formal religious rites which are the proper functions of
the magician. And this is consistent with what we know of the growth of
religious ritual among those nations where the evolution of religion can
be best studied. The earliest forms of devotion of

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

which we have an account among the Jews were very simple and acts of
sacrifice were exceptional and rare. With the development of the
religious life of the people different orders sprung up, and these
confined themselves to particular functions. But though we know but
little of domestic and individual religion among the mass of the people,
such indications as we have go to show that each man did perform acts of
devotion however simple these might be.

We have seen that the king of Old Town kept his soul in a sacred grove,
and that this was an act of devotion. It, however, gives the clue to a
class of myths which are common from the Ganges to the Atlantic, and
that is the soul dwelling apart from the body. It is difficult to
classify the legends and folk-lore tales in which these myths are met
with. They partake of magic certainly; but are more of the nature of
devotion, and the caring for the soul's welfare by placing it in such
safe keeping as to defy the enemies of mankind to obtain access to it.

In a former chapter reference was made to the soul's absence during
sleep or fainting. Some of the dangers of soul-snatching by ghosts,
wizards, and evil spirits have also been noticed. The dangers of the
soul during its temporary absence were considerable. While resident in a
man's body it was comparatively safe; but even then there were dangers,
and dangers of such nature as to be difficult to guard against. While a
man remained in sound vigorous health his soul was safe, but should he
be taken ill his soul was then in danger, for it could

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

be reached and injured, perhaps stolen, through his body, as in the case
of the soul which the wizard got as it was handed about among the gods
at the sick man's door. This being an admitted and recognised fact, it
would be of the utmost importance for a man to have a place of safe
keeping where he could deposit his soul in time of danger, and if this
place were very secure, it would be a manifest advantage to have his
soul kept there permanently. This would make a man independent of
wizards on the one hand and of magicians on the other. The former could
no longer hurt him; the latter he could dispense with when freed from
the fear of witchcraft. Such a man could boldly strike out a new course,
and become a reformer by a defiance of the powers of evil, and a total
neglect of the gods. Hence it is that such men, in popular imagination,
are regarded as giants, monsters of impiety, cruel and cunning,
regardless of all interests except their own, and oppressing all who
come into their power. Evidence of this is found in the folk-lore tales
taken from the traditions of peoples living widely apart, and the number
and variety of such tales is proof that, at one time, this was a sober
belief widely diffused throughout the world, and is a faithful
reflection of the facts of life, in relation to the unseen, as these
appeared to primitive man. These tales would in the first instance be
preserved and recited as a true statement of the facts, and, handed down
through millenniums of years, told at one time to warn the impious, at
another as nursery rhymes, or by the fitful light of a blazing log on a
winter's

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

night, to amuse the curious, they would preserve much of their original
form, though places and circumstances would change.

Such was the story of "Headless Hugh," of my own nursery days. I still,
when the winds howl about the gables and among the trees, find my mind
running back to the time when Headless Hugh was a real living man, who
on stormy nights rode along the sea shore "between wave and sand," and
watched whether little boys went to sleep quietly. If they did not he
took them away on "the grey filly that never had a bridle." It must be
nearly thirty years since I heard old Betty Miles tell the story. I
could repeat it word for word now, so persistent are the impressions of
childhood, especially when accompanied by a wholesome state of terror.

Hugh was a prince of Lochlin, and was long held captive by a giant who
lived in a cave overlooking the Sound of Mull, and known by his name to
this day. For many years Prince Hugh lived in the dismal recess of this
grotto. One night there was a violent altercation between the giant and
his wife, and Hugh who lay very still listening, knowing that he would
be killed and eaten if it was known that he overheard their
conversation, discovered that the giant's soul was in a great
pearl—literally precious gem—which he always wore on his forehead. The
prince watched his opportunity, seized the pearl, and having no means of
escape or concealment, hastily swallowed the gem. Like the lightning
from the clouds, the giant's sword flashed from its scabbard and flew
between Hugh's head and his body to

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

intercept the gem before it could be swallowed. It was too late, and the
giant fell down, sword in hand, and expired without a gasp. Hugh had
lost his head, but having the giant's soul in his body, saved his life
and gained his liberty. He took the giant's sword, slew his wife, and
then with the trusty weapon buckled to his side he mounted "the grey
filly that never had a bridle, and swifter than the east wind," and made
his way home unconscious of the loss of his head. His friends did not
recognise him, declared he was a ghost, and refused to admit him to the
palace, and so "he wanders in shades of darkness for ever, riding the
grey filly faster than the east wind." On stormy nights he is seen
riding along the shore "between waves and sand." He has taken many boys
who would not go quietly to bed, and none of them have ever returned.
This is the outline of a story I often heard from an old beldam who made
my young life a long-continued torment while she had the opportunity of
doing it.

Compared with it, the following Hindoo tale betrays a common origin in
the days when such facts were soberly believed. The story is of a giant
or magician who had held a beautiful queen captive for twelve years. At
last the queen's brother came to visit her, and they both spoke the
magician fair. He told them, in a moment of confidence, that he kept his
soul thousands of miles away in a desolate country covered with jungle.
In this jungle there was a circle of palm trees; within the circle six
water tanks, piled one above another; under the lowest a birdcage with a
small green parrot in it.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The parrot was his
soul, or rather he kept his soul in the parrot. The queen's brother
hearing this sought out the jungle, and at last found the cage which he
brought to the magician's palace. When the magician saw it, he cried,
"Give me my parrot." The boy tore off a wing; the magician lost an arm.
In this way he was torn limb from limb, and, finally, when the parrot's
neck was wrung he fell down dead, his neck broken. <span
id="fr_184"></span>[\*](#fn_184.md) In another Hindoo story the soul is in
a necklet. In a well-known Highland story the giant says: "There is a
great flagstone under the threshold; under the flagstone is a wether; in
the wether's belly is a duck; in the duck's crop an egg, and that egg
contains my soul." <span id="fr_185"></span>[†](#fn_185.md) The egg, as
usual, is found and crushed and the captive is set free. The giant dies,
of course.

The same form of superstition and myth is common to Teutons, Norse,
Slavonians, Ancient Greeks, and Jews. The history of Samson, <span
id="fr_186"></span>[‡](#fn_186.md) as recorded in the Book of Judges, is a
case in point. He remained invulnerable till, through the wiles of his
wife, he was shorn of his locks, and then his strength departed. The
variations in this case from the Hindoo and Celtic tales is nothing more
than might be expected, when the national characteristics of the Jews
and their peculiar history is taken into account. This form of myth is
as wide as humanity. I was on one occasion sitting in a Hlubi chief's
house waiting for the appearance of the great man, who was doing his
toilet, to hold a palaver. Several of his chiefs and

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

councillors were present, and entered freely into conversation with my
attendants. I did not pay any particular attention to what passed till
one of my own people said, in English, "Ntame has his soul in these
horns," at the same time pointing to a pair of magnificent ox-horns
placed in the roof by the lightning doctor to protect the house and its
inmates from the thunderbolt. The horns were those of an animal offered
in sacrifice and were sacred. I took the statement at the time to mean
that to hold a palaver with Ntame was equivalent to holding converse
with an ox, and made no farther inquiries. Whether my factotum spoke a
parable, or stated a sober fact gathered from the councillors present, I
cannot say. He addressed me in English, which he spoke fluently, and as
no one else present understood a word of what he said Î took his
statement to be a hint to be careful what I said, and how I received our
host's promises and professions of friendship. I have had no opportunity
of verifying the statement, but the idea is in no way foreign to South
African thought. A man's soul there may dwell in the roof of his
house, <span id="fr_187"></span>[\*](#fn_187.md) in a tree, by a spring of
water, or on some mountain scaur.

This form of superstition leads by an easy transition to totemism, and
it is on this account I regard it as more religion than magic or
witchcraft. The object where the soul dwells is sacred, and it gets its
sanctity because it is the home of the soul. This may be a bird, as the
tufted crane among Kaffirs; an animal, as the crocodile, among
Bechuanas; an insect,

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

as among the Hottentots, who regard the *mantis religiosa* as a
divinity. All these objects are sacred because either a person's life is
bound up with a particular specimen, or the tribal life with a class.
The horns of a lightning sacrifice are sacred, and must not be touched
except by the doctor, but this does not extend beyond the family in
whose interests the sacrifice was offered, while animals that are sacred
to the tribe are sacred to each individual member of it. To shoot a
crane would be a more heinous offence than to shoot a fox before the
hounds. Again, tribes are named after animals or objects, as the
elephant people, the swimmers, men of the wood, and such other names or
titles descriptive of supposed qualities as tradition has preserved.

In Sutherlandshire at the present day there is a sept of Mackays known
as "the descendants of the seal." These claim as their ancestor a laird
of Borgie, who married a mermaid, and as the legend has never been in
print, I give it here as recently told me by one well versed in
north-country mythology. <span id="fr_188"></span>[\*](#fn_188.md) It is as
follows:—The laird was in the habit of going down to the sea rocks under
his castle to bathe and drink salt water. One day he saw a mermaid close
in shore, combing her hair and swimming about as if anxious to land.
After watching her for a time, he noticed her cowl on the rocks beside
him, and knowing she could not go to sea without it he carried it up to
the castle, hoping she would follow him. This she did; but he refused

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

to give up the cowl and detained the maid herself, whom he made his
wife. To this she consented with great reluctance, and told him her life
was bound up with the cowl, and if it rotted or was destroyed she would
instantly die. The cowl was placed for safety in the centre of a large
hay-stack, and there it lay for years. One day, during the master's
absence, the servants were working among the hay and found the cowl.
They showed it to the lady of the house, not knowing what it was. She
took it, and then, strapping her child securely in its cot, she left and
went to sea never to return again to Borgie. For Years she used to come
close in shore that she might see her boy, and then she would weep
because he was not of her own kind so that she might have him at sea
with her. The boy grew to be a man, and his descendants have always been
exempt from drowning. They are famous swimmers, and are known locally to
this day as "Sliochd an roin," that is, the descendants of the seal.

It is difficult to give an explanation of such myths as this, but when I
first heard it I began to make inquiries, and discovered that there are
floating traditions of shipwrecked crews having settled down among the
native population, and I have thought that the Borgie mermaid may have
been a cast-away maiden. If so, was she detained against her will? Did
she make her escape? Were there negotiations about the custody of her
child between her friends and the wild septs of the Reay country? And
did local tradition weave these facts into the legend as it was current
half a century ago? An

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

answer to these questions is made all the more difficult by the
existence of other local traditions. There is a sept known as "the men
of the hide" in the same district, and the tradition regarding their
name, if not their origin, is this:—The devil visited the district to
get the names of all those who were willing to aid him. The laird of
Cobachy met the stranger, whom he found a "nice-spoken gentleman,"
albeit he was attired in a bull-hide with the horns attached. The laird
noticed that his visitor kept his feet concealed, but in leaping a bog
he got a glimpse of the cloven hoof, and to get rid of him recommended a
visit to Melness. The devil put to sea in his bull-hide, and raised the
Kyle of Tongue into foam and furrow as he crossed. After an interval he
returned, and called to pay his respects to his friend Cobachy. The
latter asked how he had succeeded. "Oh," said he, "that is the place to
go to; I have covered my hide with names. I got so many that some are
marked on the horns." <span id="fr_189"></span>[\*](#fn_189.md) The men of
the district are known as Fir-na-Sioch—the men of the hide. This the
present generation resent, and are apt to fly to their fists if
bull-hides are mentioned.
