### CHAPTER V

##### TABOOS

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> have already seen how the Mikado of
Japan and the divine King of Laondo lived surrounded with safeguards and
restrictions. The dangers to which souls are exposed have also been
touched upon. We shall now consider how these were guarded, and the
fresh dangers to which taboos gave rise as restrictions were multiplied.

To the savage, as we know him, the great danger of existence is
witchcraft and the action of charms and spells; and to secure himself
against these he adopts such precautions as the nature of the case
suggests. But witchcraft itself is a system which must have had an
origin, and developed, from one or more simple conceptions, to be an art
practised by persons who claimed to have communication with the unseen
world. With the art we generally associate the ideas of pure mischief,
but it was capable of being turned to good account, and the Scotch
witches who banned rats from farmers’ barns were thought worthy of a
night's quarters and a substantial honorarium for their service. It has
been hastily inferred that they learned the art from ecclesiastics, who,
with bell, book and candle could ban the devil himself; but it is far
more likely that

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

priests learned the art of banning from an older cult coming down from
the ages before the Flood.

With great persuasion I once induced an old woman to repeat to me a form
of words for the banning of rats, which she had learned from "a woman
that had the second sight and could do things." It is many years since I
heard the doggerel, and can remember but one sentence of it, which,
wedged in between imprecations and curses, was, that they should "shed
the hair off their skulls" if they did not betake themselves to other
quarters. This freed the farmer of the pest, but unfortunately the same
power could be turned against any one who offended the witch. She in
that case brought an army of rats down upon him, "to eat his corn and
cut his sacks, and teach him to rue the day that he shut his door on
Shoanad." This I heard from a Morven woman nearly thirty years ago, when
quite a boy. If Andrew Lang, who in those days was a frequent visitor at
Ardtornish, had but known Gaelic, we should have had a store of legends,
rhymes and charms preserved to us which are now finally lost. I have
travelled in all parts of the Highlands of Scotland, but nowhere have I
met with such variety and richness of legend and myth as along the
shores of the Sound of Mull.

If men need to guard against witchcraft in Scotland, how much more
necessary must it be to do so in savagedom. Lives of great importance to
the community we may expect to find guarded with special care, in the
same way as we guard royalty

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

in Europe, from attack by evil-disposed persons, sane and insane. There
are not only the dangers which may lurk unseen near at hand, but also
unknown dangers from a distance, and which are associated with the
arrival of foreigners. Besides, there are districts specially charged
with such malign influences, and any one visiting these must be purged
and purified before he has any communication with others. Thus the
missionary New and his party were, on their return from Killimanjaro,
sprinkled by a "professionally prepared liquor" on arriving on the
borders of the inhabited country. This was done by the priest, and
before they had had any communication with the tribe. In the Yoruba
country there is a custom of keeping strangers standing outside the gate
of the town till sundown, lest evil spirits should enter with them if
admitted during the day. <span id="fr_94"></span>[\*](#fn_94.md) In South
Africa the traveller must halt at a distance from the "great place," and
is invited to the chief's presence only after the magician has performed
the necessary incantations. Dinka and Bongo tribes on the Nile, take the
like precautions against the advent of evil spirits when visited by
strangers. <span id="fr_95"></span>[†](#fn_95.md) The South Sea Islanders
subject those landing on their shores to a process of purgation to expel
any evil which may hang about them. These are all general precautions
taken for the benefit of the community. But do what he may, the savage
cannot absolutely exclude evil from the tribe. Spirits do enter in the
most unexpected manner, and witches will prowl

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

about and follow their unlawful calling while men sleep. So he takes
special precautions to guard those whose lives are of great value;
precautions which, in their own language, "cannot be taken for
commoners."

The arts of witchcraft are so subtle that those marked for its victims
can be affected through the food they eat, if the wizard can but get his
fingers into it, or even see it; through articles taken from their
persons, as cut nails, hair, arms, ornaments, saliva, and also through
all those articles which sacred persons may not see or touch. Thus it
happens that those whose lives are so guarded may not eat in public, nor
must their food be seen except by trusted personal attendants. In
Gondokoro a guest asked to a marriage sends a present of food, but it
must be carefully covered with a napkin to protect it from the influence
of wizards and witches, <span id="fr_96"></span>[\*](#fn_96.md) through
whom the whole bridal party might be affected. A Wanyoro will not return
by the way he went; his very footprints may in the interval be
bewitched. The King of Loango may not be seen eating or drinking, on
pain of death. In Dahomey the same law exists, and Cameron in his walk
across Africa paid men to let him see them eat or drink.

By judiciously extending these taboos life may be made a burden too
grievous to be borne by the persons so guarded, and a day comes when,
utterly wearied arid goaded to madness, the king defies the gods and
asserts his own independence. Such defiance is the herald of reform and
a further advance

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

of thought. Those having charge of sacred mysteries must adapt their
teaching to the stern facts of life, and adopt such ritual as will be
submitted to by those who have the civil power in their hands. And this
illustrates a curious trait of religious life the world over, viz., that
reforms are forced on sacred persons from without. From within it does
not come. They cling to tradition and usage, and when a custom or dogma
has outlasted its time, instead of boldly throwing it aside, an attempt
is made to prop and buttress it up by fresh legislation and more
extended ritual, till some one comes and shivers the structure, and it
falls crumbling to dust and nothingness by its own weight.

But there is another side to this mystery of taboos, for if the sacred
person must be guarded from harm from without, so must others be
protected from receiving hurt from him. He is neither in heaven nor on
earth, and it is men's interests that he should be suspended as evenly
as may be between the two. His divinity will be injured by too much
contact with earth and with men; but then this very divinity is a source
of danger should men be brought, in the ordinary relations of life, into
too close contact with him. He is a source of blessing under proper
conditions, but let these be violated, and his divinity becomes a source
of greatest danger; a fire which, if touched, will burst forth to scorch
and burn. Should any one wear the Mikado's clothes without his leave, he
would have swellings all over his body. <span
id="fr_97"></span>[\*](#fn_97.md) Nor is this

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

confined to Japan. The following quotation from J. G. Frazer, quoting
the authority of W. Brown and a Paheka Madri, illustrates the lengths to
which taboos were carried in New Zealand.

"It happened that a New Zealand chief of high rank and great sanctity
had left the remains of his dinner by the wayside. A slave, a stout
hungry fellow, coming up, saw the unfinished dinner, and eat it up
without asking any questions. Hardly had he finished when he was
informed by a horrorstricken spectator that the food of which he had
eaten was the chief's. . . . . 'No sooner did he hear the fatal news
than he was seized by the most extraordinary convulsions and cramp in
the stomach, which never ceased till he died about sundown the same day.
He was a strong man, in the prime of life, and should any one have said
he was not killed by the taboo of the chief, he would have been listened
to with feelings of contempt for his ignorance and inability to
understand plain and direct evidence.'" This is not a solitary case. Mr.
Frazer quotes several others, and in each case it is plain the persons
died of sheer fright, so all-powerful can a fixed belief become among an
ignorant and superstitious people.

With such results before his eyes, it is not to be wondered at if we
find the savage placing sacred persons among the dangerous classes, and
that he should extend taboos to persons and things supposed to be
dangerous. Those who touch the dead are, in New Zealand and Africa,
unclean till purified by magicians. Indeed, the rules of ceremonial
purity

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

are so strict among some tribes that cases are on record where men have
killed their wives for lying down on their mats at forbidden
periods. <span id="fr_98"></span>[\*](#fn_98.md) Hence it is that at such
times women are secluded, as also after child-birth. In the former case
they may be even rolled up in mats and suspended as in a hammock for a
period of six or seven days, to be unstrapped and conveyed to a stream
of water for necessary sanitary purposes.

"The rules of ceremonial purity observed by divine kings, chiefs, and
priests; by homicides, women at child-birth, and so on, are in some
respects alike. To us these classes of persons appear to differ totally
in character and condition. Some of them we should call holy, others
unclean and polluted. But the savage makes no such moral distinction
between them To him they are dangerous and in danger, and the danger in
which they stand and to which they expose others is what we should call
spiritual or supernatural—that is, imaginary." <span
id="fr_99"></span>[†](#fn_99.md) One of the substances most commonly
tabooed by savages is iron. No iron may touch a sacred person's body. He
may die when a simple incision might save his life, but the incision
must not be made. A Hottentot priest never uses a knife in performing
the operation of circumcision; he uses a sharp bit of quartz instead.
Gold Coast natives remove all iron from their persons when consulting
Fetish. <span id="fr_100"></span>[‡](#fn_100.md) Scottish Highlanders never
use iron nails or hammers in making the fire-wheel

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

apparatus for the celebration of certain Yule festivals; they use wooden
pegs and stone hammers instead. The Jews used no iron tools in building
their Temple in Jerusalem, nor in making an altar.

The objection to iron arose in all probability when the metal was new
and scarce, and so regarded with superstitious awe and reverence. But
soon, daring spirits like Lamech arose, who, defying custom and taboo,
and believing only in the strength of his own arm and the trusty weapons
his son had forged for him, turned the dreaded metal to good account. A
substance charged with such power that spirits could root endure it in
their presence, and before which kings might fall down dead, put into
men's hands a terrible weapon which could be used with disastrous
effects even against the gods themselves. But if iron could be used
against the gods, they in turn could use it against evil-doers, and the
priesthood would not be slow in availing themselves of so potent a
weapon. Apart from its obvious utility as an arm, when properly forged
and shaped, it would be regarded as having magic and miraculous power,
when properly used, for the expulsion of evil. And so we find iron, and
the metals generally, occupying a prominent place in the superstitions
of all countries. When a Scottish fisherman hears "the unclean animal"—a
pig—mentioned, he feels for the nails in his boots and mutters "cauld
iron." So, too, if one of the crew utters certain oaths or curses when
at sea. He bans the devil of ill-luck and disaster by nailing a
horseshoe, preferably that of a stallion, to the stern of

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

his boat. A Golspie fisherman a few years ago had a small boat with
which he had an extraordinary run of luck in the prosecution of his
calling. Inside the stem was nailed an entire horse's shoe, given to him
by "a wise person" As he prospered his ambition grew till he purchased a
larger boat, selling the small one and its belongings to a neighbour.
From the first day he went to sea with his new boat luck forsook him,
nor would fickle fortune be wooed. He bethought him of his horse-shoe,
and went to his neighbour to demand restitution. This was denied, the
new owner contending successfully that he had purchased the "boat and
its gear." <span id="fr_101"></span>[\*](#fn_101.md) To this day that man
believes that to parting with an old shoe was due the entire failure of
his season's fishing. Whether returning luck—for he still lives and
prospers—had an educative effect upon his mind, I do not know.

Sutherlandshire crofters and cottars ban, or expel, the spirit of death
from a house after one dies, by placing bits of iron in the meal chest,
the butter jar, whisky bottle, and other articles of food, without which
precaution they would speedily "go to rottenness and corruption." Whisky
not treated so has been known to turn white as milk and curdle. Among
savages iron is held in the same veneration. The Baralongs, who are
famous smiths, regard the blacksmith's trade as a sacred art. Furnaces
are placed at a distance from the houses, and none dare approach when
the metal begins to flow, except those versed in the mysteries of the
craft.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

But in Africa it is on articles from the person, or which have belonged
to one regarded as sacred, that the greatest care is bestowed. This is
common to the Zulu and the Dinka, to the Galla and Dahomeyan. We meet
with it in every possible relation of life. For example, a young Zulu
soldier, who was travelling to join his regiment with a companion,
arrived at a village where they were to spend the night. They were
directed to the "travellers’ hut," where they found a mat such as
natives sleep upon. The soldier took the mat and unrolled it, when, to
his dismay, he found it contained head ornaments and other articles of
female dress, such as is only used by the king's household. Seeing this,
he rolled the mat up again and put it aside. It belonged to a girl of
the king's harem, on her way to the capital, who had stayed there a few
nights before. She had forgotten her mat and ornaments. On arriving at
headquarters he was at once detailed for cattle-guard, but on his return
in the evening he was met by a young man of his regiment, who told him
his companion had been put to death, and that he was to be killed for
having touched articles belonging to sacred persons. <span
id="fr_102"></span>[\*](#fn_102.md) He fled, but was overtaken and put to
death. If touching ornaments is a capital offence, stepping over the
head of a recumbent African is a yet more serious crime, if the sleeper
be a person sacred in virtue of position or office. The head is
peculiarly sacred, and to step over it is the most grievous offence that
a man can commit, if it be not excelled in enormity by pulling his hair.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When this sanctity
of the head and the consequent difficulty of disposing of shorn locks is
borne in mind, it will be seen that the barber's vocation is, if an
honourable one, a dangerous office. Suppose an artist is called to
perform a necessary office for his chief, whose ample locks have become
too secure a retreat for the colonies that take shelter under them, he
must be first purified with sprinkling, and have the tools of his craft
cleansed by the magicians. He then proceeds to the royal residence, and,
in presence of the king's guards and officers of State, removes the mass
close to the skull. If after the operation the king takes a chill the
poor barber is accused of something more than neglect of duty: <span
id="fr_103"></span>[\*](#fn_103.md) he bewitched the king, or he may have
given a hair to his friend the wizard to enable the latter to do the
evil deed. In either case the barber must stand his trial, in the first
case as a principal, in the second as an accessory, and failing his
divulging the wizard's name, must take the consequences of his guilt if
the magicians decide the case as one of bewitching.

But should he honestly perform his office and no untoward events follow,
there remains the difficulty of disposing of the shorn locks. Burn them,
says common sense; but to the savage common sense often is what the law
was to the elder Weller, "a hass." To burn shorn locks would be to
invite all the demons of a locality to secure and treasure up the very
essence they are in search of in the ascending smoke. To them the smell
of burning hair or

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

nail clippings is what the carcase is to the vulture. Nor is it safe to
keep them by one, for who can guard against rats and white ants, not to
speak of accidents of fire, war, and theft. The only prudent course is
to bury them. <span id="fr_104"></span>[\*](#fn_104.md) But how and where?
And here the sacred and lawful art of the magician comes to the aid of
the perplexed. Sacred spots are set apart for such purposes—a kind of
consecrated ground where the chief can bury his shorn locks and cut
nails, as well as dispose of other necessary superfluities in the most
approved fashion prescribed in Deuteronomy xxiii. 13; there as a wise
sanitary precaution; in Africa as a sacred function; at the lowest as a
precaution against the works of the devil.

And here I may say that those who had charge of my own youth were most
remiss in a necessary and most important particular, evidence of which I
have to go before any jury of Celts over seventy years of age with. One
of my earliest recollections is having my hair cut by an itinerant
tailor, who combined the art of clothing one's limbs with that of
unclothing the head. I remember him still: a gaunt, lean-looking man,
with hollow eyes and a sepulchral voice. When the operation was finished
he directed that the severed locks should be gathered up and burned,
because, should the birds—it was spring-time, and the danger was
real—get the smallest particle, even a single hair, to build their
nests, I should be grey at twenty-one. This he insisted upon with the
strongest asseveration

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

of its truth; while I, evil imp as I must have been, gathered up a
handful of hair, which I threw over the window for the robins. The deed
was done. The artist stood aghast, and now, though a good decade from
the time when grey hairs should appear, I carry the evidence of my own
folly to kirk and market.

The gods of the Dakota Indians are mortal, and propagate their kind.
Their Onkteri resemble a bull, and can extend their tails and horns to
the sky, the seat of their power. <span id="fr_105"></span>[\*](#fn_105.md)
The earth is believed to be animated by the spirit of the female
Onkteri, while the water and the earth beneath the water is the abode of
the male god. The Onkteri have power to issue from their bodies an
essence, signifying a god's arrow, which can work wholesale
destruction. <span id="fr_106"></span>[†](#fn_106.md) The priests possess
or claim all the power ascribed to the gods, and are believed to pass
through a series of inspirations by which they receive the god-spirit.
They lay hold on all that is mysterious, predict events, and declare
that they bring about events of which they made no prediction. They have
duplicate souls, one of which remains with the body, while the other
wanders at will. Clearly it is necessary that such persons should be
surrounded by such restrictions as will ensure the peace and safety of
the community. And so we find in Africa, America, Asia, and the South
Seas the same system of taboo; the same objections to certain objects
and animals, and the same sanctity of others, running into clan badges
and totems, which are at once sacred and to be cared

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

for, while they afford protection to those whose symbols they are.

But let men guard as they may; let them surround divinities with
restrictions, and take every precaution against evil persons getting
possession of objects dangerous to their lives, accidents will happen
and evils will accumulate, with a corresponding increase among those
spirits who cause them. So, as we have a process of evolution going on
among the gods, we have also a development of the doctrine of devils.
This I do not propose to trace fully, but it is necessary to refer to
the subject in general terms before we consider the methods adopted for
their expulsion.

How man arrived at the idea of good and evil spirits as personal beings
is impossible to determine with accuracy. It is probable after he
reached the conception of a soul separate from the body, personal and
immortal, or at least capable of existence in a distinct spirit-world,
he began to attribute to such souls the same character as was borne by
the man while he lived. The soul of a seditious man would foment
sedition on earth among those whom he could influence after his death.
So, too, the soul of a murderer, a thief, or a contentious man would
incite to similar crimes. These would be regarded as evil spirits, to be
dealt with as men of like disposition are dealt with. To secure society
against their influence, only two ways were open to primitive man: one,
to defy them, as is often done in the case of men of evil disposition,
and so make them practically outcasts; another to conciliate

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

them, and so by acts of bribery and flattery secure their good offices,
or at least their neutrality. Both these methods are found wherever
savage man dwells. Devils are cursed, defied, expelled the country, and
treated as we do our dangerous classes. At other times they are
flattered, cozened, and feasted with sacrifice, in order that the
largeness of the offering may be a sufficient inducement for them to
refrain from evil. We shall in the present inquiry meet frequently with
devil-worship, but here it may be well to inquire how primitive man
sought to rid himself of spirits which he both feared and hated.
