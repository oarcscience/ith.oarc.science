### CHAPTER VI

##### EXPULSION OF DEMONS

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> man found his steps dogged by
demons, he sought for means by which he could rid himself of those imps
of evil which rendered his life an insupportable burden. His first
impulse was to surround himself with safeguards, as a warrior in mail
armour. But this necessitated an increase of restrictions each time evil
spirits or daring men discovered means of breaking through his taboos.
With the discovery of gunpowder mail armour became useless. Bullets
could only be resisted by an increase in the weight and thickness of the
protecting coat of mail, and warriors found it necessary to change their
methods. So the savage whose taboos are rendered useless by a Lamech,
finds it necessary to re-examine the whole surrounding. Must he add to
the number of restrictions, to the weight of the already overburdened
taboos, till they become like swaddling clothes in which he cannot move
or breathe? Are his movements to be restricted as dangers multiply? Does
the advent of each fresh enemy necessitate a re-adjustment of his whole
philosophy?

The savage, feeling the awkwardness of his position by ever-increasing
restrictions, arrived at the conception that, by a supreme effort made
periodically,

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

or as occasion might arise, he could rid himself, for a time at least,
of the evils which surrounded him. And when we come to this doctrine of
devils and their expulsion, we arrive at a point which marks a distinct
advance in thought. Under the earlier forms the king or earth spirit did
good or evil according to humour or caprice; but with the conception of
personal spirits, divided into a good class and a bad, we find men
projecting into the supernatural what they experienced in the natural
world. Their philosophy, crude as it was, was based on observation, and
embodied the results of experience so far as savage man could formulate
his experience into a system. When taboos failed to meet the case, men
adopted the bolder policy of making war on devils. Nor is the savage
singular in the methods adopted to expel evils. When fasts and prayers
failed the inhabitants of European cities in the expulsion of the devils
of epidemic diseases, they made war upon them in sewers and cellars, and
to far better purpose than by the older and more pious method of
priestly intercession. A comparison of the methods adopted for the
expulsion of evils in Africa, and survivals amongst ourselves, gives one
the impression that popular imagination is not yet far removed from the
age of Balac, whose only hope lay in having a powerful magician, like
the prophet Balaam, to curse his enemies before he joined his: forces in
battle with theirs.

Taking South Africa—with the practice of which I was long
familiar—first, it may be said in a general way that no "commoner" dare
interfere with spirits

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

either good or bad, beyond offering such sacrifices as are sanctioned by
custom. Demons may haunt a man, and render his life a burden, but he
must Submit to their machinations until the case is taken in hand by the
proper authorities. A baboon may be the messenger of evil spirits, and
perch itself on a tree within easy gunshot, or regale itself in his
maize field; but to pull a trigger at the brute would be worse than
suicide. As long as the man remains a solitary sufferer he has little
chance of redress. It is assumed, he has been guilty of some crime, and
that the ancestors have in their wrath sent the demon to torment him.
But should his neighbours suffer; should the baboon from choice or
necessity—for men do pluck up courage to scare the brutes—select a fresh
field in which to glean its supper, or another man's barn roof for its
perch, the case alters its complexion. The magicians now take the matter
up seriously. One man may be visited by the ancestors with severe
reproof, as being haunted by a demon, but a whole community is another
matter. Clearly in that case there is something amiss, and a remedy must
be found. To shoot the baboon will not serve the purpose. African
spirits are not amenable to powder and lead, as Scottish witches are to
powder and silver bullets, and to kill the baboon would only be to
enrage the demon and increase the danger. The first thing to do is to
discover where the devil has his permanent abode. This is generally a
deep pool of water with overhanging banks and dark recesses. There the
villagers gather with priests and magicians. Under the direction of
their

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

ghostly counsellors, and secured from harm by their presence, men,
women, and children pelt the demon with stones. Drums are beaten and
horns blown at intervals, and when all are worked up into a frenzy of
excitement, as one after another catches a glimpse of the imp as he
tries to avoid the missiles, he takes his flight at a single bound, and
the village is free from his influence for a time. Baboons may now be
killed and crops protected. While the stone throwing goes on, all
present, and especially the women, hurl the most abusive epithets at the
object of their fear and vengeance.

There is no periodic purging of devils, nor are more spirits than one
expelled at a time. I have noticed frequently a connection between the
quantity of grain that could be spared for making beer, and the
frequency of gatherings for the purging of evils and other necessary
purposes. No large gathering can be held in Africa without feasting and
drinking, especially the latter. Like the Scotch factor, anxious to let
a barren moor with hardly a feather on it, to an Englishman, as "one of
the finest bits o’ ground i’ the north," and who after the second
tumbler of "toddy," suggested a third before closing the bargain, on the
ground that "it's dry wark talking," the African finds all public
functions, even his devotions, "dry wark," and needs his pombe. If this
is not to be had, the assured result is failure.

There are demons who are not amenable to stone-throwing and abuse. Such
methods would only give them further opportunity for mischief by an
increased knowledge of village affairs. They in that case could

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

adapt their methods to the new conditions, and the end of that place
would be worse than the first, for they would enter it clean swept of
all effectual means of defence. So the Dinka and Bongo expel their
devils by guile. <span id="fr_107"></span>[\*](#fn_107.md) There the
exorcist begins by holding a conversation with the demon. He ascertains
his name; how long he has been there; where he belongs to; his permanent
residence; kinsfolk, acquaintances, and other particulars, all the while
disguising his own identity as a devil-doctor. When he ascertains all he
wishes to know, he hurries to the woods to collect such medicines as are
effectual for the expulsion of demons of the class to which the one in
question belongs. After this his course is clear: he sends the evil one
beyond the bounds of his diocese by bell, book, and candle, or, to be
literal, by horn, calabash, and torch.

The Wazeramas, more tender of heart towards their demons, expelled them
by gentler means than a shower of stones or a drastic purge. Suppose a
patient is devil-possessed, he is taken out of his hut and propped up
against a tree in presence of the assembled villagers. An ancient crone
ladles out beer to all who wish a draught. When she has completed her
round of the crowd, drums are beaten, horns blown, and all manner of
musical instruments played. The demon, captivated by the music, has his
senses—"’cuteness"—dulled for the time, and at the auspicious moment,
when the noise has reached a maddening pitch, the magician entices him
to enter a stool, wooden pillow, or any other object that can

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

be easily carried about. <span id="fr_108"></span>[\*](#fn_108.md) This he
conveys to a safe place, where he can deal with the demon at will and
prevent his re-entering the patient. He, poor beggar, standing on one
leg propped against the tree, is either killed outright by noise and
excitement, or by a process of reaction obtains sleep, and frequently
recovers within a few days or even hours.

When a Galla exorcist is called upon to exercise his powers over the
unseen world, against any one of the eighty-eight demons that haunt the
tribe, <span id="fr_109"></span>[†](#fn_109.md) he kills a goat, the
entrails of which he hangs about his neck. Thus arrayed, he carries in
one hand a bell, which he rings "to waken the demon," and in the other a
whip. After he has capered about for a time ringing his bell, he
suddenly raises his whip, with which he gives the patient several sharp
cuts. The demon, not liking such treatment, takes to his heels; a final
flourish of the whip in the air as the demon flies past completes the
process, and the magician goes his way carrying his fee along with him,
which is the only guarantee against the demon's return. I recommend this
method to European physicians whose accounts are of long standing!

Of all methods employed for the expulsion of evil spirits that found
among the Wanika is the gentlest I have met with. There they are treated
with the care and consideration with which ladies of quality were
treated when they walked abroad a century, ago. This method may be
illustrated by taking the case of a patient who is devil-possessed, as
has been done with the preceding. A mortar filled with water

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

is placed at his bedside. Next a gaudily-coloured stick, richly
ornamented with beads, bits of glass, -and ornaments, is stuck in the
ground close at hand. A boy dips a bundle of twigs in the water, with
which he sprinkles the head of the patient. The people beat drums,
dance, sing, and play as if round a May-pole. The demon loves music, and
he loves beads and gewgaws. As the merriment proceeds he thinks people
are off their guard, and he looks at the stick. As he looks he becomes
fascinated and leans towards it. Finally, he leaves the patient and
enters the stick, when it is promptly pulled from the ground by the
magician. <span id="fr_110"></span>[\*](#fn_110.md) What he does with the
demon so tenderly treated the historian does not record. He probably
mars all his previous kindness by throwing the stick, devil and all,
into lake or river.

But the demons of South and East Africa are as water to whisky when
compared to those of the West Coast, where their expulsion wholesale, at
stated intervals is a necessity of existence. So potent are they for
evil that the people of Dahomey, who may in a few weeks thereafter expel
them wholesale, sacrifice sheep and goats to them before sowing their
crops. <span id="fr_111"></span>[†](#fn_111.md) If they neglected this
precaution, so powerful are evil spirits, no corn would ripen, even
should every demon be expelled before it comes into ear. Along the
coast, where large towns have to be purged, the ceremonies are both
elaborate and protracted. Rude wicker figures of elephants, tigers,
cows, and other animals are made,

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

and carefully covered over with cloth. Of these, one is set up before
every house door. <span id="fr_112"></span>[\*](#fn_112.md) Each family
needs a figure, and the animals are selected from a supposed connection
between them and the spirits of departed ancestors. Old Tiger-face's son
would naturally select the animal whose name his father bore when taking
part in the great ceremony of expelling devils from the town and from
his own fireside. The figures are intended as receptacles or places of
temporary retreat for the demons when the process of purgation begins.

At 3 <span class="smallcaps">a.m.</span> a tempest of noise begins
simultaneously in all parts of the town. Drums beat, bugles bray, horns
roar, bells tingle, whistles screech. Everything which can be made to
emit sound is brought into requisition and kept going till the owner is
exhausted, or the instrument gives way, a frequent occurrence. This
pandemonium of noise continues till high noon. At that hour floors are
swept, dusty corners turned out, the ashes of the previous day's fires
carefully collected, and everything where a demon could lurk removed and
placed inside the wicker figure at the door. The images are then carried
in tumultuous procession to the river and tossed into the water with
beat of drum. The demons dare not return; they are now beyond the
boundaries of the town, and but for untoward accidents men might live in
peace for an indefinite time. But as ill-luck will have it, the next
tribe may be expelling their own devils, and these, turned out of
comfortable quarters, may enter the newly

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

purged territory and finding it unoccupied, take up their abode there
till once more carried to the river and so cast out. Illustrations of
this might be multiplied indefinitely, but what has been given may be
taken as characteristic of a particular phase of thought.

Now this belongs to an early and very rude state of society—to the time
before man had differentiated clearly between the natural and
supernatural, and when he still believed himself to have power over the
unseen world. The condition has continued among peoples far removed from
the flowing current of civilisation, and who had not invented the art of
writing. It has survived through the hunting, pastoral, and agricultural
stages of progress among rude peoples, and seems to persist wherever man
is unable to record his thoughts in symbols readily understood by his
fellows. But although this peculiar belief in man's powers over the
world of spirits persists in barbarous countries, to use a common
expression, we should hardly be prepared for its persistency in
Christian times in Europe, and among the most highly educated
communities in civilised lands. Few peoples have enjoyed greater
educational advantages, so far as the bulk of the peasantry is
concerned, than the Scotch, and still we find among them, even at the
present day, many persons who believe in man's power to call the devil
at will. That such faith should be found universal among savages is
consistent with all we know of the progress of human thought; that
Christian communities should continue, generation after generation,

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

through millenniums of years, to believe in the power of their religious
teachers on the one hand, and of their wizards and witches on the other,
to control demons and influence nature, is one of those curious
phenomena which show how narrow are the limits which divide savage man
from civilised, and make us pause to ask, how much of truth, absolute
truth, we, any of us, know concerning ourselves, and the mysterious,
unsatisfied yearnings of our souls for a fuller, truer, and clearer
knowledge of the unseen.

Not more than a century ago it was no uncommon thing to appeal to priest
or presbyter to visit this village or that to "lay the devil," and the
curious thing is, that men of education and experience of the world went
through the mummeries supposed to have that effect. A priest of the
Braes of Lochaber "laid" the devil about what is now Spean Bridge, and
the Reformed faith proceeded no farther up the glen of the Spean. A
successor of his, however, doubted whether he had but half laid him in
Inveroy, the next district to Spean Bridge, the inhabitants of which,
according to the worthy father, did justice neither to God nor man. This
"laying" of the devil was rendered necessary through his being "raised"
by persons who had that power being in league with him, and without
whose aid he "could not leave his hole." How this was done I have failed
to discover with certainty. The "laying" was by bell, book and candle,
or within Reformation times "by prayer and the exercise of the power of
prayer," a phrase as difficult of interpretation as any African oracle
of them all. Prayer one

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

can understand, but what is the "power of prayer" as applied to the
"laying" of the devil? As to the "raising" of his majesty, one old man
told me the following incident, for the truth of which he vouched on
personal knowledge, "for," said he, "it happened when I was a good bit
o’ a callant." I give his own words as nearly as I can remember.

"It's a long time since, but I mind it as if it were yesterday. The boys
were having a wild night. Two old men had just finished wi’ a pickle
malt for the new year like, and there was plenty going. About the middle
of the night, at the turn as you would say, one of the young men began
to curse and swear awful. He called on the devil, and said he might come
and take him. Some o’ them were a wee sober, and bade him keep quiet,
but he gaed worse, and defied a’ the devils in hell, and said he would
like to smell their brimstone. That moment there was an awful flash of
lightning, and a woman, said no to be canny, or the likes o’ her, came
down the chimney and stood afore him. She stood facing him, and said:
'Ye want to see the devil: he may be here sooner nor ye think.' Sorry a
word more did she say when the house was filled wi’ burning brimstone,
and something going up and down in a blue flame on the crook"—\[*i.e.*,
the chain for hanging pots over the fire\]. "Then it made a noise such
as the like was never heard, and gaed out o’ sight. The gun-barrels in
the house were twisted and broken, and the next day the smell o’
brimstone was strong on their clothes. None of them could ever tell
right how it happened, but there's nae doubt about it.

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It's as true as
gospel." And then the old man proceeded to detail other experiences of
his youth, and to bemoan the scepticism of the age, which was sure to
bring the curse of God down upon the world. This was not an ignorant
man, but one fairly well informed; a man who knew his Bible, and could
correct preachers on, points of Calvinistic theology. I knew him well,
and he represented current opinion among middle-aged and old people in
parts of the Highlands about twenty years ago. How the devil was "laid"
in this case my informant did not remember, but he was fully informed
how it was done in other cases, and believed as firmly as he did in his
own existence that the art "was known to many of the godly in olden
times."

There is a woman of my acquaintance in Reay who can "do things." Some
years ago she asked a coach-driver for a "sail" in his vehicle. He
refused. "Very well," said Annie; "I will be in Thurso before you." A
mile farther on one of his horses fell stone dead, and he had the
mortification of seeing the witch pass with an air of triumph. The owner
has never refused her a "sail" since then.

A former minister of the parish of Reay in Caithness, a Mr. Pope, was a
man of more than local reputation. He came to the parish when the people
were largely pagan, and being a man of herculean strength, used gentle
physical persuasion by means of an oaken cudgel, known as the "bailiff,"
to bring his parishioners to church. His feats of strength, and
especially his having first thrashed, and then driven before him to
church, a local character regarded

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

with dread as a giant in strength and a tiger in temper, gave him an
extraordinary influence over his unruly flock. Supernatural powers were
freely attributed to him, and this for reasons of his own he may have
encouraged. Among other powers he possessed he was regarded as being
able to "lay the devil" at will. It so happened that the people of
Strathy, in the neighbouring parish, "raised" the fiend but could not
get him "laid" again. In dire extremity they went to Mr. Pope, and on
some pretext induced him to visit Strathy. When nearing the place "he
got the smell of the fiend," and knew why they had sent for him. He was
excessively angry, but having gone so far he proceeded to the place, and
so effectually did he dispose of their troublesome visitor, that, as I
was told last summer, "the devil has never since been raised in the
district."

Did the scope of our inquiry permit, illustrations of the same practice
of expelling the devil could be drawn from the usages of the Teutonic
peoples of Europe. This is represented by such practices as are observed
among the Finns of Eastern Russia. There on the last day of the year a
band of young girls march through the streets and stop at each house
corner, which they beat with wands they carry for the purpose. As they
beat each house they say, in chorus, "We are driving Satan out of the
village." After they have in this manner visited all the houses, they
march in procession to the river, singing as they go, and when they
arrive there throw their wands, devils and all, into the water to float
away down stream. "At Brunnen, in Switzerland, the boys

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

go about in procession on Twelfth Night, carrying torches and lanterns,
and making a great noise with horns, cowbells, and whips. This is said
to frighten away two female spirits of the wood—Strudeli and
Strätteli." <span id="fr_113"></span>[\*](#fn_113.md) These are but
illustrations of the simpler forms of a custom observed by all the
peoples of Europe; a custom which in many cases became grafted on to the
services of the Christian Church, <span id="fr_114"></span>[†](#fn_114.md)
no man can tell how, but which clearly carry us back to an age when the
peoples of Europe were, by painful experience, groping their way towards
a knowledge of truth, as the Central African of to-day is undoubtedly
doing. For what are all religions but a searching after truth; the
expression of man's desire to attain to a true and final knowledge of
causes, and his own relation to these?

offering to the spirit of the spring, while others say it is to ban evil
from the water. In either case it is a survival of a long-forgotten
past—a simple action, carrying us back to a time when spirits inhabited
every grove and running stream.
