# WHY HAS JACKAL A LONG, BLACK STRIPE ON HIS BACK?

THE Sun, it is said, was one day on earth, and the men who were
travelling saw him sitting by the wayside, but passed him without
notice. Jackal, however, who came after them, and also sitting, went to
him and said, "Such a fine little child is left behind by the men." He
then took Sun up, and put it into this awa-skin (on his back). When it
burnt him, he said, "Get down," and shook himself; but Sun stuck fast to
his back, and burnt Jackal's back black from that day.
