<p>ONCE on a time Jackal, who lived on the borders of the colony, saw a wagon returning from the seaside laden with fish; he tried to get into the wagon from behind, but he could not; he then ran on before and lay in the road as if dead. The wagon came up to him, and the leader cried to the driver, "Here is a fine kaross for your wife!"</p> 
<p>"Throw it into the wagon," said the driver, and Jackal was thrown in.</p> 
<p>The wagon traveled on, through a moonlight night, and all the while Jackal was throwing out the flsh into the road; he then jumped out himself and secured a great prize. But stupid old Wolf (hyena), coming by, ate more than his share, for which Jackal owed him a grudge, and he said to him, " You can get plenty of fish, too, if you lie in the way of a wagon as I did, and keep quite still whatever happens."</p> 
<p>"So!" mumbled Wolf.</p> 
<p>Accordingly, when the next wagon came from the sea, Wolf stretched himself out in the road.</p> 
<p>"What ugly thing is this?" cried the leader, and kicked Wolf. He then took a stick and thrashed him within an inch of his life. Wolf, according to the directions of Jackal, lay quiet as long as he could; he then got up and bobbled off to tell his misfortune to Jackal, who pretended to comfort him.</p> 
<p>"What a pity," said Wolf, "I have not got such a handsome skin as you have!"</p>
