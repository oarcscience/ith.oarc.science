# ORIGIN OF THE DIFFERENCE IN MODES OF LIFE BETWEEN HOTTENTOTS AND BUSHMEN

IN the beginning there were two. One was blind, the other was always
hunting. This hunter found at last a hole in the earth from which game
proceeded and killed the young. The blind man, feeling and smelling
them, said, "They are not game, but cattle."

The blind man afterwards recovered his sight, and going with the hunter
to this hole, saw that they were cows with their calves. He then quickly
built a kraal (fence made of thorns) round them, and anointed himself,
just as Hottentots (in their native state) are still wont to do.

When the other, who now with great trouble had to seek his game, came
and saw this, he wanted to anoint himself also. "Look here!" said the
other, "you must throw the ointment into the fire, and afterwards use
it." He followed this advice, and the flames flaring up into his face,
burnt him most miserably; so that he was glad to make his escape. The
other, however, called to him: "Here, take the kirri (a knobstick), and
run to the hills to hunt there for honey."

Hence sprung the race of Bushmen.
