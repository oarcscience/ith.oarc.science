# THE LION AND JACKAL

NOT because he was exactly the most capable or progressive fellow in the
neighborhood, but because he always gave that idea-that is why Jackal
slowly acquired among the neighbors the name of a "progressive man." The
truly well-bred people around him, who did not wish to hurt his
feelings, seemed to apply this name to him, instead of, for instance,
"cunning scamp," or "all-wise rat-trap," as so many others often dubbed
him. He obtained this name of "a progressive man" because he spoke most
of the time English, especially if he thought some of them were present
who could not understand it, and also because he could always hold his
body so much like a judge on public occasions.

He had a smooth tongue, could make quite a favorable speech, and
especially with good effect could he expatiate on the backwardness of
others. Underneath he really was the most unlettered man in the
vicinity, but he had perfect control over his inborn cunningness, which
allowed him for a long time to go triumphantly through life as a man of
great ability.

One time, for instance, he lost his tail in an iron trap. He had long
attempted to reach the Boer's goose pen, and had framed many good plans,
but when he came to his senses, he was sitting in front of the goose pen
with his tail in the iron trap, the dogs all the time coming for him.
When he realized what it meant, he mustered together all his strength
and pulled his tail, which he always thought so much of, clean off.

This would immediately have made him the butt of the whole neighborhood
had he not thought of a plan. He called together a meeting of the
jackals, and made them believe that Lion had issued a proclamation to
the effect that all jackals in the future should be tailless, because
their beautiful tails were a thorn in the eyes of more unfortunate
animals.

In his smooth way he told them how he regretted that the king should
have the barbaric right to interfere with his subjects. But so it was;
and he thought the sooner he paid attention to it the safer. Therefore
he had had his tail cut off already and he should advise all his friends
to do the same. And so it happened that once all jackals for a long time
were without tails. Later on they grew again.

It was about the same time that Tiger hired Jackal as a schoolmaster.
Tiger was in those days the richest man in the surrounding country, and
as he had had to suffer a great deal himself because he was so
untutored, he wanted his children to have the best education that could
be obtained.

It was shortly after a meeting, in which it was shown bow important a
thing an education was, that Tiger approached Jackal and asked him to
come and teach his children.

Jackal was very ready to do this. It was not exactly his vocation, he
said, but he would do it to pass time and just out of friendship for his
neighbor. His and Tiger's farm lands lay next each other.

That he did not make teaching his profession and that he possessed no
degree was of no account in the eyes of Tiger.

"Do not praise my goodness so much, Cousin Jackal," laughed he. "We know
your worth well enough. Much rather would I intrust my offspring to you
than to the many so-called schoolmasters, for it is especially my wish,
as well as that of their mother, to have our children obtain a
progressive education, and to make such men and women of them that with
the same ability as you have they can take their lawful places in this
world."

"One condition," said Jackal, "I must state. It will be very
inconvenient for me, almost impossible, to come here to your farm and
hold school. My own farm would in that case go to pieces, and that I
cannot let happen. It would never pay me."

Tiger answered that it was not exactly necessary either. In spite of
their attachment to the little ones, they saw that it would probably be
to their benefit to place them for a while in a stranger's house.

Jackal then told of his own bringing up by Wolf. He remembered well how
small he was when his father sent him away to study with Wolf.
Naturally, since then, he had passed through many schools, Wolf was only
his first teacher. And only in his later days did he realize how much
good it had done him.

"A man must bend the sapling while it is still young," said he. "There
is no time that the child is so open to impressions as when he is
plastic, about the age that most of your children are at present, and I
was just thinking you would be doing a wise thing to send them away for
quite a while."

He had, fortunately, just then a room in his house that would be suited
for a schoolroom, and his wife could easily make some arrangement for
their lodging, even if they had to enlarge their dwelling somewhat.

It was then and there agreed upon. Tiger's wife was then consulted about
one thing and another, and the following day the children were to leave.

"I have just thought of one more thing," remarked Jackal, "seven
children, besides my little lot, will be quite a care on our hands, so
you will have to send over each week a fat lamb, and in order not to
disturb their progress, the children will have to relinquish the idea of
a vacation spent with you for some time. When I think they have become
used to the bit, I will inform you, and then you can come and take them
to make you a short visit, but not until then. "It is also better,"
continued he, "that they do not see you for the first while, but your
wife can come and see them every Saturday and I will see to all else."

On the following day there was an unearthly howling and wailing when the
children were to leave. But Tiger and their mother showed them that it
was best and that some day they would see that it was all for their
good, and that their parents were doing it out of kindness. Eventually
they were gone.

The first Saturday dawned, and early that morning Mrs. Tiger was on her
way to Jackal's dwelling, because she could not defer the time any
longer.

She was still a long way off when Jackal caught sight of her. He always
observed neighborly customs, and so stepped out to meet her.

After they had greeted each other, Mrs. Tiger's first question was:
"Well, Cousin Jackal, how goes everything with the small team? Are they
still all well and happy, and do they not trouble you, Cousin Jackal,
too much?"

"Oh, my goodness, no, Mrs. Tiger," answered Jackal enthusiastically,
"but don't let us talk so loud, because if they beard you, it certainly
would cause them many heartfelt tears and they might also want to go
back with you and then all our trouble would have been for nothing."

"But I would like to see them, Cousin Jackal," said Mrs. Tiger a little
disturbed.

"Why certainly, Mrs. Tiger," was his answer, "but I do not think it is
wise for them to see you. I will lift them up to the window one by one,
and then you can put your mind at rest concerning their health and
progress."

After Mr. and Mrs. Jackal and Mrs. Tiger had sat together for some time
drinking coffee and talking over one thing and another, Jackal took
Tiger's wife to a door and told her to look through it, out upon the
back yard. There he would show her the children one by one, while they
would not be able to see her. Everything was done exactly as Jackal had
said, but the sixth little tiger he picked up twice, because the
firstborn he had the day before prepared in pickle for their Sunday
meal.

And so it happened every Saturday until the last little tiger-which was
the youngest-had to be lifted up seven times in succession.

And when Mrs. Tiger came again the following week all was still as death
and everything seemed to have a deserted appearance on the estate. She
walked straight to the front door, and there she found a letter in the
poll grass near the door, which read thus:

"We have gone for a picnic with the children. From there we will ride by
Jackals' dance for New Year. This is necessary for the completion of
their progressive education."

Saturday after Saturday did Mrs. Tiger go and look, but every time
Jackal's house seemed to look more deserted; and after a while there was
a spider's web over the door and the trail of Snake showed that he, too,
had taken up his abode there.
