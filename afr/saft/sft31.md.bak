# ELEPHANT AND TORTOISE

TWO powers, Elephant and Rain, had a dispute. Elephant said, "If you say
that you nourish me, in what way is it that you do so?" Rain answered,
"If you say that I do not nourish you, when I go away, will you not die?
And Rain then departed.

Elephant said, "Vulture! cast lots to make rain for me."

Vulture said, "I will not cast lots."

Then Elephant said to Crow, "Cast lots! who answered, "Give the things
with which I may cast lots." Crow cast lots and rain fell. It rained at
the lagoons, but they dried up, and only one lagoon remained.

Elephant went a-hunting. There was, however, Tortoise, to whom Elephant
said, "Tortoise, remain at the water!" Thus Tortoise was left behind
when Elephant went a-hunting.

There came Giraffe, and said to Tortoise, "Give me water!" Tortoise
answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Zebra, who said to Tortoise,

"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Gemsbok, and said to Tortoise,

"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Wildebeest, and said, "Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The
water belongs to Elephant."

There came Roodebok, and said to Tortoise,

"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Springbok, and said to Tortoise,

"Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Jackal, and said to Tortoise,

"Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The water belongs to Elephant."

There came Lion, and said, "Little Tortoise, give me water!" When little
Tortoise was about to say something, Lion got hold of him and beat him;
Lion drank of the water, and since then the animals drink water.

When Elephant came back from the hunting, he said, "Little Tortoise, is
there water?" Tortoise answered, "The animals have drunk the water."
Elephant asked, "Little Tortoise, shall I chew you or swallow you down?"
Little Tortoise said, "Swallow me, if you please!" and Elephant
swallowed him whole.

After Elephant had swallowed Little Tortoise, and he had entered his
body, he tore off his liver, heart, and kidneys. Elephant said, "Little
Tortoise, you kill me."

So Elephant died; but little Tortoise came out of his dead body, and
went wherever he liked.
