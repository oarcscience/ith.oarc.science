# THE STORY OF A DAM

HERE was a great drought in the land; and Lion called together a number
of animals so that they might devise a plan for retaining water when the
rains fell.

The animals which attended at Lion's summons were Baboon, Leopard,
Hyena, Jackal, Hare, and Mountain Tortoise.

It was agreed that they should scratch a large hole in some suitable
place to hold water; and the next day they all began to work, with the
exception of Jackal, who continually hovered about in that locality, and
was overheard to mutter that he was not going to scratch his nails off
in making water holes.

When the dam was finished the rains fell, and it was soon filled with
water, to the great delight of those who had worked so bard at it. The
first one, however, to come and drink there, was Jackal, who not only
drank, but filled his clay pot with water, and then proceeded to swim in
the rest of the water, making it as muddy and dirty as he could.

This was brought to the knowledge of Lion. who was very angry and
ordered Baboon to guard the water the next day, armed with a huge
knobkirrie. Baboon was concealed in a bush close to the water; but
Jackal soon became aware of his presence there, and guessed its cause.
Knowing the fondness of baboons for honey, Jackal at once hit upon a
plan, and marching to and fro, every now and then dipped his fingers
into his clay pot, and licked them with an expression of intense relish,
saying, in a. low voice to himself, "I don't want any of their dirty
water when I have a pot full of delicious honey." This was too much for
poor Baboon, whose mouth began to water. He soon began to beg Jackal to
give him a little honey, as he had been watching for several hours, and
was very hungry and tired.

After taking no notice of Baboon at first, Jackal looked round, and
said, in a patronizing manner, that he pitied such an unfortunate
creature, and would give him some honey on certain conditions, viz.,
that Baboon should give up his knobkirrie and allow himself to be bound
by Jackal. He foolishly agreed; and was soon tied in such a manner that
he could not move hand or foot.

Jackal now proceeded to drink of the water, to fill his pot, and to swim
in the sight of Baboon, from time to time telling him what a foolish
fellow he had been to be so easily duped, and that he (Jackal) had no
honey or anything else to give him, excepting a good blow on the head
every now and then with his own knobkirrie.

The animals soon appeared and found poor Baboon in this sorry plight,
looking the picture of misery. Lion was so exasperated that he caused
Baboon to be severely punished, and to be denounced as a fool.

Tortoise hereupon stepped forward, and offered his services for the
capture of Jackal. It was at first thought that he was merely joking;
but when he explained in what manner he proposed to catch him, his plan
was considered so feasible that his offer was accepted. He proposed that
a thick coating of "bijenwerk" (a kind of sticky black substance found
on beehives) should be spread all over him, and that he should then go
and stand at the entrance of the dam, on the water level, so that Jackal
might tread upon him and stick fast. This was accordingly done and
Tortoise posted there.

The next day, when Jackal came, he approached the water very cautiously,
and wondered to find no one there. He then ventured to the entrance of
the water, and remarked how kind they had been in placing there a large
black stepping-stone for him. As soon, however, as he trod upon the
supposed stone, he stuck fast, and saw that he had been tricked; for
Tortoise now put his head out and began to move. Jackal's bind feet
being still free he threatened to smash Tortoise with them if he did not
let him go. Tortoise merely answered, "Do as you like." Jackal thereupon
made a violent jump, and found, with horror, that his hind feet were now
also fast. "Tortoise," said he, "I have still my mouth and teeth left,
and will eat you alive if you do not let me go." "Do as you like,"
Tortoise again replied. Jackal, in his endeavors to free himself, at
last made a desperate bite at Tortoise, and found himself fixed, both
head and feet. Tortoise, feeling proud of his successful capture, now
marched quietly up to the top of the bank with Jackal on his back, so
that he could easily be seen by the animals as they came to the water.

They were indeed astonished to find how cleverly the crafty Jackal had
been caught; and Tortoise was much praised, while the unhappy Baboon was
again reminded of his misconduct when set to guard the water.

Jackal was at once condemned to death by Lion; and Hyena was to execute
the sentence. Jackal pleaded hard for mercy, but finding this useless,
he made a last request to Lion (always, as he said, so fair and just in
his dealings) that he should not have to suffer a lingering death.

Lion inquired of him in what manner he wished to die; and he asked that
his tail might be shaved and rubbed with a little fat, and that Hyena
might then swing him round twice. and dash his brains out upon a stone.
This, being considered sufficiently fair by Lion, was ordered by him to
be carried out in his presence.

When Jackal's tail had been shaved and greased, Hyena caught hold of him
with great force, and before he had fairly lifted him from the ground,
the cunning Jackal had slipped away from Hyena's grasp, and was running
for his life, pursued by all the animals.

Lion was the foremost pursuer, and after a great chase Jackal got under
an overhanging precipice, and, standing on his hind legs with his
shoulders pressed against the rock, called loudly to Lion to help him,
as the rock was falling, and would crush them both. Lion put his
shoulders to the rock, and exerted himself to the utmost. After some
little time Jackal proposed that he should creep slowly out, and fetch a
large pole to prop up the rock, so that Lion could get out and save his
life. Jackal did creep out, and left Lion there to starve and die.
