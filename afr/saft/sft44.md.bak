# ANOTHER VERSION OF THE SAME FABLE

THE Moon dies, and rises to life again. The Moon said to the Hare, " Go
thou to Men, and tell them, 'Like as I die and rise to life again, so
you also shall die and rise to life again.'" The Hare went to the Men,
and said, "Like as I die and do not rise to life again, so you shall
also die, and not rise to life again." When he returned the Moon asked
him, "What hast thou said?" "I have told them, 'Like as I die and do not
rise to life again, so you shall also die and not rise to life again."'
"What," said the Moon, " hast thou said that?" And she took a stick and
beat the Hare on his mouth, which was slit by the blow. The Hare fled,
and is still fleeing.
