> is neither a chief nor a doctor, cannot touch this kind of medicine;
> if any one among the chief's men were seen with it, he used to be

> a man stands in his presence he is oppressive; it is as though the
> chief was bearing him, and he feels a perspiration breaking out; and
> he starts up and goes away to strengthen himself with his medicines.
> If that man does not leave <span id="page_418">p. 418</span> these

> if you do not leave off this conduct of yours, you are already dead.
> Give me all your medicines, that I may see those which you have about
> you." And indeed the man does not conceal them, because he has been
> discovered by being felt by the chief's body. And if the chief finds a
> great medicine on him, he asks what he does with it, and from whom he
> got it. He says he purchased it from So-and-so. The chief asks what he
> was about to do with it. And he explains what he wished to do when he
> bought it; perhaps he says to make damsels love him. The chief takes
> the medicine, and places it among his own.
>
>  As to the possibility of a man who carries powerful medicines being
> felt, this is what I know.

>  It happened one day the people assembled at a dance; and the men were
> sitting in the cattle-pen looking at the damsel dancing; and then, as
> the men were sitting and looking on without there being anything the
> matter, they saw one among them who appeared to be cold, and saw him
> fall down—a young man of the people of Unomsimekwane, the chief of the
> nation of Umkcoseli.<span
> id="page_418_fr_81"></span>[81](#page_418_note_81.md) And <span
> id="page_419">p. 419</span> the people asked, "What is the matter with

> matter with you?"
>
>  He replied, "No. I feel different sensations in different parts of my
> body; I am weak; I do not know what is the matter with me. I felt
> myself become suddenly hot, and then fell."
>
>  He was unable to see. My brother went and took his medicines, and

> himself, having chewed some, puffed into his ears and nostrils; and in

>  I heard the people talking much, saying, "O, So-and-so did a
> wonderful thing; as we were arriving at the wedding, before we had sat
> down any time, we saw a man fall without apparent reason; and
> So-and-so at last restored him." There was much talk of that kind.

>  Further, we do not say of a man that falls, "He merely falls; he has

>  Just as in the thorn-couutry where our tribe lived, at Table

> id="page_421_fr_85"></span>[85](#page_421_note_85.md) though you are a

> said that the tree cries like a sheep. There are several kinds of

> that which grows among the Amanthlwenga.
>
>  Usopetu said, "Upeteni, begin." But although the heaven is still, and
> there is no wind, the tree moves, and makes a noise by moving; its
> leaves move. Usopetu said, "Upeteni, do you begin, since you say you
> are a doctor. Pluck for me, and give me." At once Upeteni untied his
> medicines, and selected what was proper; he chewed them and puffed on
> his body. He arose, thinking to go and pluck from the tree. And as he
> carried his assagais that he might stab it, he stabbed it;<span
> id="page_422_fr_86"></span>[86](#page_422_note_86.md) it moved violently;
> and would not allow him to approach it. He went back to other
> medicines, and chewed them and puffed upon his body; and again went to
> the tree, and stabbed it; it made a great noise; again and again he
> tried to approach it, but he was unable; he went back again, and his
> face began to be suffused with perspiration.
>
>  Usopetu said, "Pluck from the tree, and let us go home."
>
> <span id="page_423">p. 423</span>
>
>  He applied to other medicines; but he was still unable to pluck from
> the tree. And he was no longer able to quit the place; cold entered
> into him; although there was a cloudless, bright sun, he was cold, and
> began to say to Usopetu, "O, I am conquered. Help me; I am now ill."
>
>  Usopetu replied, "Yes! yes! You are about to be satisfied today that
> I am a doctor; you are my boy."<span
> id="page_423_fr_87"></span>[87](#page_423_note_87.md) Usopetu untied his

> took his medicines, and went with them to the tree; he stabbed and it
> made a great noise; he went back from it, and took other medicines and
> went to it again; he stabbed it; it was silent; he went down to it,
> and plucked its branches.
>
>  And Upeteni said, "Pluck for me also." He gave him some of the
> branches of the tree. He took up the assagais and came back with them.
>
>  Upeteni said, "Usopetu, you are a doctor. You have conquered me this

>
>  But the Amanthlwenga know how to treat this disease. Unofithlela

> had already died. And those who treated them told them not to drink

> the way and not reach home.
>
>  And indeed whilst under treatment, the Dutchman wished to return
> home, and put them in his waggons. O, as they journeyed they passed

> id="page_428_fr_95"></span>[95](#page_428_note_95.md) Usomseu<span

> enough fire. No, there was enough. At length they saw that more time
> had passed than was required to cook the meat; they began to remember,
> and say one to another, "Oh, can it be that Udumisa is doing that

> <span id="page_429">p. 429</span> magic on a bullock,<span
> id="page_429_fr_97"></span>[97](#page_429_note_97.md) it does not get

>
> <span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

>
>  So they returned, and went at once to the chief.<span

>  But Udumisa said in reply, "O, chiefs,<span

>  And the chiefs agreed with Udumisa, and said, "The meat was not

>
>  But in their opinion, although Udumisa spoke cunningly, and <span
> id="page_431">p. 431</span> the chiefs agreed with him, it was not so;
> for they said, "Eh! what does Udumisa mean by saying that we did not

>  When the grain begins to appear, a doctor is called, for the people

> When can I find time to look for food, if I am harassed in this way?

collects to himself all medicines of known power; each doctor has his
own special medicine or medicines, and treats some special form of
disease, and the knowledge of such medicines is transmitted <span
id="footnotes_page_420">p. 420</span> as a portion of the inheritance to
the eldest son. When a chief hears that any doctor has proved successful
in treating some case where others have failed, he calls him and demands
the medicine, which is given up to him. Thus the chief becomes the great
medicine-man of his tribe, and the ultimate reference is to him. If he
fail, the case is given up as incurable. It is said that when a chief
has obtained some medicine of real or supposed great power from a
doctor, he manages to poison the doctor, lest he should carry the secret
to another and it be used against himself.

 <span id="page_420_note_83"></span>[83](#page_420_fr_83.md) An injury of
the head is always a cause of anxiety to natives, especially one which
has caused depression of the bone, which the natives usually treat by
cutting down to the bone, and scraping it, often leaving a deep
depression. Such injuries are always referred to as the cause of all
future diseases.

 <span id="page_420_note_84"></span>[84](#page_420_fr_84.md) That is, an
inexperienced man bears about him powerful medicines, and therefore the
medicines of another become aware that there is an opponent at hand, and
contend with the medicines till they are <span
id="footnotes_page_421">p. 421</span> overcome, and he who carries them
is seized with illness. By bearing medicines he becomes a centre of
influence and attraction, and is, as it were, attacked by another. One
who bears no such medicine does not suffer; not being a centre of
influence, he is not a centre of attraction, and so, being neutral,
escapes.

by throwing his assagai, standing at a distance, not by approaching it
so as to stab it without throwing. When the tree is pierced, it is said
to throw out of the wound a water, with a hissing noise; and if the
juice fall on the body of a man, it will produce a deep wound, and kill
him if he is not treated by a skilful doctor.

using medicines similar in character to those which the chief is using,
but those of the chief are the stronger of the two, and the doctor feels
their power. He is, as it were, an enemy in the presence of an enemy
more powerful than himself. The common man not being under the influence
of medicines is not in a state of antagonism with those who use them.

name, that the magic might take effect on him, and not on another.

 In the Legends of Iceland we meet with several instances of persons
being "called" or forced by magical means to go to a certain place,
where their enemies were awaiting them. Thus Olafr says to Gudmundr:—"My
father lives at a farm not far from hence; he has charmed you hither,
for he wants to repay you the slaying of his son." (*Legends of Iceland.
Second Series, p.* 103.) Again, the farmer having unsuccessfully
attempted to kill Oddr, says:—"Great is thy luck, Oddr, to have escaped
scatheless, for thou shalt know that, by my charms, thou art here, as I
intended to kill thee." (*Id., p.* 123.) See also p. 132 and p. 153.

<span id="footnotes_page_433">p. 433</span>

 <span id="page_433_note_5"></span>[5](#page_433_fr_5.md) Although, as is
supposed, Ufaku had by magical charms forced Uncapayi to come to him
alone, yet when he was there in his power, Ufaku relented, and was
unable to kill his son-in-law. But he could not be comfortable till he
had vented his anger on someone, so he collected his troops and sent
them out on a raid against some neighbouring tribe.

<span id="footnotes_page_434">p. 434</span>

 <span id="page_434_note_6"></span>[6](#page_434_fr_6.md) This cannot be
rendered literally, so as to be intelligible to the English reader. It
is very common for the Zulu thus to introduce a subject in an elliptical

leaves, and stalks, when bruised.

 <span id="page_435_note_9"></span>[9](#page_435_fr_9.md) This system of
squirting water containing medicine from the mouth, is a very common
custom among the natives, in the efficacy of which they have great
faith. It is practised to ward off a danger which might arise from the
magical practices of another; it is also a defiance, and a means of
sending evil to another. The custom of spitting in contempt is probably
connected with some such superstition.

 <span id="page_435_note_10"></span>[10](#page_435_fr_10.md) The native
dress is very simple, and during washing is placed on a rock close at
hand; and the man stands in the water whilst washing, and does not go
out of the water till he has dressed.

powder made of the dried flesh of various wild beasts,—leopard, lion,
elephant, snakes, &c.,—the natives intending by the administering this
compound to impart to the men the qualities of the several animals.
Sometimes if a man has killed a wild beast, a leopard for instance, he
will give his children the blood to drink, and roast the heart for them
to eat, expecting thereby to cause them to grow up brave and daring men.
But it is said by others that this is dangerous, because it is apt to
