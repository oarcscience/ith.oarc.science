### INKOSAZANA.<span id="page_253_fr_96"></span>[96](#page_253_note_96.md)

T<span class="small">HE</span> following superstition as regards the
Inkosazana appears to be the relic of some old worship; and is therefore
properly considered in this place.

> T<span class="small">HE</span> account of the Inkosazana who came out
> on the same day that men came out of the earth.
>
>  She is not commonly seen. We hear it said the primitive men knew her.
> No one existing at the present time ever saw her. She is said to be a
> very little animal, as large as a polecat, and is marked with little
> white and black stripes; on one side there grows a bed of reeds, a
> forest, and grass;<span
> id="page_253_fr_97"></span>[97](#page_253_note_97.md) the other side is
> that of a man. Such is her form.
>
>  If she meet with a man she conceals herself and speaks with him
> without his seeing her; he hears only a voice saying to him, "Turn
> your back; do not look on me, for I am naked." Saying thus because her
> buttocks are red like fire. And so the man no longer looks in that
> direction, but believes that <span id="page_254">p. 254</span> it is
> indeed the Inkosazana about whom he has heard; and turns his back from
> fear, because it is said that if a man look on her face to face, he
> will be ill and very soon die.<span
> id="page_254_fr_98"></span>[98](#page_254_note_98.md)
>
>  She goes followed by a large troop of children which resemble her.
>
>  Sometimes if a man meet with her in his garden she says to him, "This
> year you shall have food; although for a long time there has been
> famine, it shall be so no longer."
>
>  Besides it is she who introduces many fashions among black men. She
> orders the children to be weaned; and although they are very young,
> they are at once weaned in obedience to her commands, for they are
> afraid if they do not wean them they will be seized with some disease
> and die.
>
>  She makes such laws as these; and her laws are obeyed and not
> despised; for they say, "The Inkosazana has said." And the reigning
> chief does not say it is a fable; the word of the Inkosazana is
> greater than the chief's.
>
>  When she orders the children to be weaned she does not speak to many
> people; she speaks but to <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> one man,
> sometimes meeting with him in the fields, sometimes at his home,
> coming by night to the man she loves and telling him; and he repeats
> her word to the people; and every one is afraid to hide her word, for
> he may die; her word is not kept secret. And this exists to the
> present time.
>
>  Sometimes she orders much beer to be made and poured out on the
> mountain. And all the tribes make beer, each chief and his tribe; the
> beer is poured on the mountain; and they thus free themselves from
> blame.
>
>  For example, there used to be a man in this country, living on the
> Umlazi, named Ubobobo;<span
> id="page_255_fr_99"></span>[99](#page_255_note_99.md) he was a man who
> troubled people much by appointing customs by asserting that the
> Inkosazana had spoken to him, and said, "Let much beer be made and
> poured on the mountains; let the children be weaned; let the damsels
> marry young men, and reject the old." Another year he would say, "She
> says, 'I give the damsels to the old men; let them reject the young.'"
>
>  And many other such commands were all observed, and were published
> throughout the land; and whatever Ubobobo was told by the Inkosazana
> was rumoured in <span id="page_256">p. 256</span> all directions. This
> is what I know about it.
>
>  It is not said that she is an Itongo (spirit), for she speaks with
> men of her own accord. I never heard that they pray to her for any
> thing, for she does not dwell with men, but in the forest, and is
> unexpectedly met by a man, who has gone out about his own affairs, and
> he brings back her message.

Princess, or Little Chieftainess.

 <span id="page_253_note_97"></span>[97](#page_253_fr_97.md) Not, says the
native who gives the narrative, to be understood literally; but that
there was something growing on her like a bed of reeds, a forest, and
grass. But compare Ugungqu kubantwana, *Zulu Nursery Tales*, p. 176; and
Usilosimapundu, p. 184.

 <span id="page_254_note_98"></span>[98](#page_254_fr_98.md) It may be
interesting to compare this superstition with the following
passages:—[Exodus xxxiii. 20](../../bib/kjv/exo.htm#33:20.md); [Genesis
xxxii. 30](../../bib/kjv/gen.htm#32:30.md); [Judges vi.
