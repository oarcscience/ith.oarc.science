### THE LORD OF HEAVEN.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I<span class="small">N</span> the previous pages we meet with frequent
allusions to a lord above or heavenly lord. Thunder and lightning and
aerial changes appear to be the only natural phenomena which have
attracted the notice of the natives of this part of Africa, and led them
to believe in a personal power above nature. Struck with terror by a
thunder storm, they encourage each other by asserting that they have
committed no crime against the powerful being in heaven who wields the
lightning, and that he is not angry, but merely playing. But we shall be
much mistaken if we hasten to conclude from this that because they speak
of a heavenly lord, they have any conception of him which identifies him
with God.

 In almost every country there is some such notion of a heavenly
being,—a relic possibly of heaven-worship; or it may be merely a natural
suggestion of the human mind, springing up spontaneously among different
peoples, and every where leading to a similar conclusion, that where
there are such manifestations of power, there is also a personal cause.

 There is the Indian Indra, called also "the lord of heaven;" the Zeus
and Jupiter of the Greeks and Romans; the Esquimaux Pirksoma; the Mau or
Ye-whe of Whydah; the So or Khevioso of Dahome; the Kaang or chief in
the sky of the Bushmen; and the Thor of our own ancestors.

 We have already seen that the Dahomans speak of thunder in the same way
as the natives of these parts; they do not say it is the sign of an
angry chief, but of a chief who is rejoicing or playing. Arbousset says
that among the Bechuanas, "when it thunders every one trembles; if there
are several together, one asks the other with uneasiness, 'Is there any
one amongst us that devours the wealth of others?' All then spit on the
ground, saying, 'We do not devour the wealth of others.' If a
thunderbolt strikes and kills one of them, no one complains, none weep;
instead of being grieved, all unite in saying <span id="page_118">p.
118</span> that the lord is delighted, (that is to say, he has done
right,) with killing that man." (*Op. cit., p.* 323.) In like manner
among the natives of Natal, if the lightning kills their cattle, they
neither complain nor mourn, but say, "The lord has taken his own."
Neither do they cry the funeral wail over those who have been killed in
this manner, lest, as they say, they should summon the lightning to kill
them too. It is not lawful for them to touch the body of a person killed
with lightning, until the doctor has come and applied medicines to the
dead, and to the living of the village to which he belonged.—Among the
Romans those struck with lightning were not buried, neither are they
among the Dahomans; but they cut from the corpse lumps of flesh, which
they chew without eating, crying to the passers by, "We sell you
meat!—fine meat!—Come and buy!" (*Burton, Mission to the King of Dahome.
Vol. II., p.* 142.)

 The following statement by an intelligent, educated Christian native
will show how utterly indistinct and undeveloped is their notion
respecting a heavenly lord:—

>  It is by no means clear what is really said about the lord of heaven.
> For when the heaven \[lightning\] has struck any place, it is said,
> "The lord is angry." This is said because of the lightning stroke. It
> is not very clear which is the lord that strikes—whether it is the
> lightning, or whether the lightning is the lord's power. It is said of
> the lightning, "The lord has struck." But there are many who are
> called lords by men, and even beasts, as the boa and the lion; but
> althongh they are thus named, they are notwithstanding killed, that
> is, their being called lords is not the same as giving the name lord
> to the lord of heaven.
>
> <span id="page_119">p. 119</span>
>
>  There is a bird of heaven;<span
> id="page_119_fr_30"></span>[30](#page_119_note_30.md) it too is killed;
> it comes down when the lightning strikes the earth, and remains on the
> ground; but neither is it said to be the lord; it is not very clear
> which is meant by lord, the lightning, or the lord which is in heaven.
> We hear it said there are men in heaven and under the earth. But it is
> hard to understand what is the condition of these underground men;
> neither do we know what is the condition of those who are above. All
> we know is that it is said they are there.

 Among the Amazulu, when there is a thunder storm, they say:

>  The heaven of Umjokwane is thundering and raining, the heaven of
> Upunga and of Umageba; the heaven of Ugukqabadele.

 The first three of these names are izibongo of the Amazulu, that is, of
the royal family, the names of ancient chiefs. But Ugukqabadele <span
id="page_120">p. 120</span> is said to be a new name, invented for that
Lord of heaven of whom the white man speaks to them. It means the
Unconquerable (see [p. 114](rsa03.htm#page_114).md). This is explained in
the following account:—

>  As regards the saying, "The heaven of Upunga and of Umageba and
> Umjokwane, it is not permitted that there should be any thing greater
> than the chief. The greatness of the heaven was said to belong to
> Upunga, who was a great Zulu chief; for you can see by this that it is
> merely something done for the purpose of exalting a man when it is
> said that the heaven too belongs to him.
>
>  It used to be said if any omen happened in a village, that it was
> occasioned by the chief. For instance, Utshaka once sprinkled the
> blood of a bullock in the royal house during the night, saying by that
> means he should know if the diviners were true when they pointed out
> offenders. But they did not divine rightly, and he killed them all but
> one, who said, "It was done by the heaven," and asked, if he could
> point out the heaven as the offender? That was all he said; and the
> people understood that by the heaven he meant Utshaka; for the heaven
> too was said to be his. This is not true; it is a mere exaltation of
> the chief. For they say he is as big as the mountains, meaning great
> mountains. But it is not so; for if he is standing or sitting at the
> foot of <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> the mountain it would hide
> him, and he could not be seen. It is the mere exaltation of a human
> being.
>
>  Further, the word Ugukqabadele is not a name of Utshaka or
> Usenzangakona. It is a name which has arisen here among the English,
> as a name for the lord of heaven. For at first when the Dutch came,
> the white men used to make us swear to the truth of what we said; for
> they did not understand what a man said when he swore by our chiefs;
> so the oath was, "Utikxo o pezulu," God of heaven; or, "I swear by the
> Lord of heaven," and one spat on his finger and pointed towards heaven
> and said, "May He take me if I know this thing." The word Ugukqabadele
> means the Lord of heaven. And kneeling is a sign of strength; for it
> is said, if a man wish to make himself very firm, and avail himself of
> all his strength, he kneels, that he may not be moved from his place;
> and the man who is fighting with him will go away. That, then, is what
> is meant by "ba-dele," They pass on or have enough, that is, they
> leave him when he has knelt.

A<span class="small">N</span> old native, in expressing his gratitude
for some act of kindness, said, pointing towards heaven, "Nkosi, elako
ilanga," Sir, the sun is yours. On asking the meaning of this, I
received the following explanation:—

>  Among the Amazulu they use the name of heaven; and when it thunders
> they say, "The heaven of the chief thundered." They do not mean the
> owner of the heaven who made it, but a mere man who is a chief; he is
> exalted by saying the heaven is his. And many are now in the habit of
> making obeisance to others, saying, "Thou of the inner circle of
> greatness, the heaven is thine; all things are thine."
>
>  They say thus because they see no one else but the chief himself, who
> if he choose can command any particular person to die, and he will die
> at once. And so they say, "That man is the owner of heaven; and every
> thing is his." It does not suffice them to honour a great man, unless
> they place the heaven on his shoulders; they do not believe what they
> say; they merely wish to ascribe all greatness to him.
>
>  Such, then, is the reverence of black men; for the chief did not say,
> "No; you are ascribing to me what does not belong to me; the heaven
> and the sun are not mine; they have their own owner; for my part I am
> insignificant." He expected to have it said always <span
> id="page_123">p. 123</span> that the heaven was his; and now our
> people address white men in the same way.
>
>  It happens among black men when the chief calls out an army and he
> has collected all his bands, he addresses them, and then they sing a
> song which excites their passions, that their hearts burn with the
> desire of seeing their enemy; and though the heaven is clear, it
> becomes clouded by a great wind which arises. And the people say, "The
> heaven of the chief feels that the chief is suffering." Therefore it
> was affirmed among great chiefs, that the heaven is the chief's; for
> when he assembles his troops the heaven clouds over, although it had
> been quite bright.

A<span class="small">NOTHER</span> native, named Ududula, who was a
great courtier, whose highest notion of politeness was the highest
hyperbole of praise, wished to borrow half-a-crown, which I had no wish
to lend. At length he said, "Mfundisi, u ng' ubaba," Teacher, you are my
father. I asked, "How?" He replied, "Wa dabuka emhlabeni, wa kula, wa ba
ngaka; mina be ngi ngaka nje," You broke off from the earth, and grew as
big as this, (placing his hand six feet above the ground;) but for my
part I only grew as high as this, (placing his hand about a foot and a
half from it.) By this he meant to say that I was not born like other
men, but came out of the ground, like Unkulunkulu.<span

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

 It appears, therefore, that in the native mind there is scarcely any
notion of Deity, if any at all, wrapt up in their sayings about a
heavenly chief. When it is applied to God, it is simply the result of
teaching. Among themselves he is not regarded as the Creator, nor as the
Preserver of men; but as a power, it may be nothing more than an earthly
chief, still celebrated by name,—a relic of the king-worship of the
Egyptians; another form merely of ancestor-worship.

 A lad of the Waiau or Ajawa tribe, living on the Eastern coast of Lake
Nyassa, informs me that among them the Rainbow is called Umlungu, that
is, God; for Umlungu is the word they there use for the Supreme Being
and supernatural powers. They also call the Supreme Being Lisoka, the
Invisible, when they wish to distinguish him from the Rainbow.<span
id="page_124_fr_32"></span>[32](#page_124_note_32.md)—Among the Dahomans,
the Rainbow is worshipped <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> under the
name of Danh, the heavenly snake. (*Burton, Op. cit., p.* 148.)

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_119">p. 119</span>

 <span id="page_119_note_30"></span>[30](#page_119_fr_30.md) "The bird of
heaven" is a bird which is said to descend from the sky when it
thunders, and to be found in the neighbourhood of the place where the
lightning has struck. The heaven-doctors place a large vessel of amasi
mixed with various medicines near a pool such as is frequently met with
on the tops of hills; this is done to attract the lightning, that it may
strike in that place. The doctor remains at hand watching, and when the
lightning strikes the bird descends, and he rushes forward and kills it.
It is said to have a red bill, red legs, and a short red tail like fire;
its feathers are bright and dazzling, and it is very fat. The bird is
boiled for the sake of the fat, which is mixed with other medicines and
used by the heaven-doctors to puff on their bodies (pepeta) and to
anoint their lightning-rods, that they may be able to act on the heavens
without injury to themselves. The body is used for other purposes as
medicine. A few years ago some peacocks' feathers were sold at a great
price among the natives of Natal, being supposed to be the feathers of
this bird.

<span id="footnotes_page_123">p. 123</span>

 <span id="page_123_note_31"></span>[31](#page_123_fr_31.md) Arbousset
appears to have noticed a similar custom. Yet his statement may have
been made from not understanding the meaning of such phrases as "Inkosi
yohlanga " (see [Note 30, p. 14](rsa01.htm#page_14_note_30).md):—"They
<span id="footnotes_page_124">p. 124</span> have no idol but he; it is
before him, literally, that they prostrate themselves. He grants them
permission to live, or he slaughters them according to his caprice. Can
the devil really have whispered to the Zula (the celestial) that he is a
god? Be this as it may, many of the Matebeles, of the same people,
believe, on the word of their princes, that the ancestors of these have
sprung from the reeds of a fountain, instead of being born of a woman,
as other men are." (*Op. cit., p.* 231.)—But the Amazulu are so called,
not because they have arrogated to themselves the title of "Celestials,"
but from Uzulu, an ancient chief. He, however, may have obtained that
name from the ascription to him of heavenly power. U-izulu, Thou art the
heaven, became soon converted into the proper name, Uzulu.

 <span id="page_124_note_32"></span>[32](#page_124_fr_32.md) In Rowley's
*Story of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa* we find the
following account of the religion of the people in the neighbourhood of
Lake Nyassa:—

 "Both Manganja and Ajawa seemed to have a better idea of the Deity than
most savage tribes. The Manganja called God, Pambi, or Mpambi; the
Ajawa, Mulungu. Neither, as I have elsewhere said, looked upon Him as a
God of wrath; indeed, they did not appear to assign any wrathful
attribute to Him, nor did they in any way make Him the author of evil;
they supposed evil to proceed from malevolent spirits—the Mfiti. We
never, therefore, found them offering up human sacrifices in order to
avert God's anger. If great danger, either famine or war, threatened
them, they would assemble at an appointed place, and in an appointed
way, offer up prayer to God to deliver them from the famine, or to give
them the victory in the war. We saw instances of this. At Magomero, soon
after the commencement of the first rainy season after we were in the
land, there was a solemn assemblage <span id="footnotes_page_125">p.
125</span> for prayer. The ground had been prepared, the seed sown; the
rains came, the corn sprang up—all seemed as we desired it; and then the
rains ceased: day by day, week by week, and no rain; the fierce sun
seemed withering the young corn, famine appeared imminent. Chigunda
assembled his people in the bush ontside the village, then marched with
them in procession to the appointed place for prayer, a plot of ground
cleared and fenced in, and in the middle of which was a hut, called the
prayer hut. The women attended as well as the men, and in the procession
the women preceded the men. All entered the enclosure, the women sitting
on one side of the hut, the men on the other; Chigunda sat some distance
apart by himself. Then a woman named Mbudzi, the sister of Chigunda it
was said, stood forth, and she acted as priestess. In one hand she had a
small basket containing Indian corn meal, in the other a small earthen
pot containing the native beer, pombi—the equivalent, doubtless, to the
ancient offering of corn and wine. She went just into the hut, not so
far but what she could be seen and heard. She put the basket and the pot
down on either side of her. Then she took up a handful of the meal and
dropped it on the floor, and in doing this called out in a high-pitched
voice, 'Imva Mpambi! Adza mvula!' (Hear thou, O God, and send rain!) and
the assembled people responded, clapping their hands softly, and
intoning—they always intone their prayers—'Imva Mpambi!' (Hear thou, O
God!) This was done again and again until the meal was expended, and
then, after arranging it in the form of a sugar loaf, the beer was
poured, as a libation, round about it, The supplications ceased, Mbudzi
came out of the hut, fastened up the door, sat on the ground, threw
herself on her back; all the people followed her example, and while in
this position they clapped their hands and repeated their supplication
for several minutes. This over, they stood up, clapped hands again,
bowing themselves to the earth repeatedly while doing so; then marched
to where Chigunda was sitting, and danced round about him like mad
things. When the dance ceased, a large jar of water was brought and
placed before the chief; first Mbudzi washed her hands, arms, and face;
then water was poured over her by another woman; then all the women
rushed forward with calabashes in their hands, and dipping them into the
jar threw the water into the air with loud cries and wild
gesticulations. And so the ceremonies ended."
