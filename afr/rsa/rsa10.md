> and begin to light a fire in the isolo;<span
> id="page_376_fr_22"></span>[22](#page_376_note_22.md) they do this before

> he has no longer power to overcome the hail; for it is difficult to
> make it turn back again when once it has came.
>
>  As regards their preparing for the contest, when they hear the sky
> rumbling, they too begin to get themselves ready, that they may not be
> conquered. For as to <span id="page_377">p. 377</span> the hail, if a
> doctor has not fasted, it is said if the hail-stones strike him much
> he is near to danger; and it is said that the hail-stones make it
> manifest that he has no longer any power to contend with the
> lightning.<span id="page_377_fr_24"></span>[24](#page_377_note_24.md) And
> he will require to be again purified a second time, that he may have
> courage. For if whilst herding<span
> id="page_377_fr_25"></span>[25](#page_377_note_25.md) he observes that he
> cannot subject either the hail or the lightning, he has no longer any
> courage, but is afraid; and even if he see the lightning dazzle his
> eyes, he is afraid, and wishes to go indoors.
>
>  It is this then about which black men speak, when they say that black
> men have power; for they say that they know how to quell the wrath
> which comes from the whole heaven, that is, the two powers, lightning
> and hail. I do not say they know also how to make the sky rain; but
> they say they know.
>
>  But it is especially this which darkens their eyes, for they do not
> <span id="page_378">p. 378</span> say there is any other wrath but
> that, for which they have already found medicines, which are capable
> of subduing it.
>
>  The hail then has its doctors in all places; and though there is a
> chief in a certain nation, the people do not say, "We have corn to eat
> through the power of the chief;" but they say, "We have corn to eat
> through the son of So-and-so; for when the sky rolls cloud upon cloud,
> and we do not know that it will go back to another place, he can work
> diligently and do all that is necessary, and we have no more any
> fear."
>
>  There is thunder; if it<span
> id="page_378_fr_26"></span>[26](#page_378_note_26.md) thunders without
> hailing, but hurls lightning, they do not appoint an inyanga of hail
> to herd, but an inyanga of lightning to go out and shout; and take
> courage when there is a heaven-herd herding outside the house. But if
> the herd is not at home, they take his blanket, and put it outside.
> The blanket is made, as it were, the herd himself.
>
>  This then is what those izinyanga do who herd the heaven. For if it
> thunders excessively, the inyanga begins to frown, that he <span
> id="page_379">p. 379</span> too may be dark as the heaven when it is
> covered with clouds. If the people of the house, whether he has gone
> out or not, speak very loudly, he silences them, saying, "Be still
> altogether." For his heart too is gathering clouds, as the heaven when
> it is coming quickly; and he no longer wishes that any one else should
> speak, but himself only by shouting. And if you go with him on a
> journey, and it suddenly thunders whilst you are at a distance from
> any village, and you are going first and he following, he will say to
> you, "Go on in front;" and he will follow at some distance from you;
> for he says if you go behind him you will meet with an accident, for
> the heaven will think you are killing him.<span
> id="page_379_fr_27"></span>[27](#page_379_note_27.md) And he makes you go
> on in front till you reach home.
>
>  Such then is the action of the heaven and of the inyanga; for black
> men believe in that scolding of the heaven, and that silencing of the
> hail. They do not imagine that when they say they know <span
> id="page_380">p. 380</span> that the heaven-herd<span
> id="page_380_fr_28"></span>[28](#page_380_note_28.md) is able to contend
> with the lightning and hail; for these people say, if we ask them,
> that they do not understand where they get the courage with which they
> contend with the heaven.
>
>  They say that when the heaven is about to be clouded,<span
> id="page_380_fr_29"></span>[29](#page_380_note_29.md) and before the
> clouds appear or it is evident that it is about to thunder
> excessively, the inyanga's heart already feels, for there is heat
> within him, and he is excited by anger; when the sky just begins to be
> clouded, he too becomes dark like it. For the doctors say they scarify
> with the heaven,<span
> id="page_380_fr_30"></span>[30](#page_380_note_30.md) and eat it. To eat
> the heaven is this, for the heaven eats cattle, and the <span
> id="page_381">p. 381</span> doctor takes the flesh of such cattle, and
> plaes it in a sherd, and the doctor eats it whilst hot,<span
> id="page_381_fr_31"></span>[31](#page_381_note_31.md) mixed with his
> medicines; for where the lightning strikes the ground, the doctors say
> there is something resembling the shank of assagai,<span
> id="page_381_fr_32"></span>[32](#page_381_note_32.md) which remains in
> the earth, and this thing is called a thunderbolt; they dig till they
> find it,<span id="page_381_fr_33"></span>[33](#page_381_note_33.md) and
> use it as a heaven-medicine; and so they say that the courage which
> they possess of contending with the heaven is that thunderbolt, which
> is found where the lightning has struck. Especially the bird also
> which is called the lightning-bird,<span
> id="page_381_fr_34"></span>[34](#page_381_note_34.md) they <span
> id="page_382">p. 382</span> say that that is the most powerful among
> all lightning-medicines. If a doctor does not possess it, but is a
> doctor only, he cannot have courage as that doctor can who possesses
> the lightning-bird, and who has eaten it. For doctors make their boast
> of this bird; for it is fat, and it is said to be the fat especially
> with which the doctors treat those who are struck, when one has been
> slightly struck and then left; but has been left full of dread. If it
> thunders he has no courage, and is much troubled at all times; he is
> not troubled mentally only; it is evident that he is troubled, for he
> continually moves about in the house, and seeks a place where he may
> hide himself. But if the doctor has been surrounded to come and give
> him heaven-medicine,<span
> id="page_382_fr_35"></span>[35](#page_382_note_35.md) then after that if
> it thunders he says, "The doctor has given me medicine; I am no longer
> afraid."
>
> <span id="page_383">p. 383</span>
>
>  But as regards that bird, there are many who have seen it with their
> eyes. And especially doctors, and those persons who have seen it when
> it thunders and the lightning strikes the ground; the bird remains
> where the ground was struck. If there is any one near that place, he
> sees it in the fog on the ground, and goes and kills it. When he has
> killed it, he begins to be in doubt, saying, "Can it be that I shall
> continue to live as I have hitherto, seeing that I have killed this
> bird, which I never saw before? Is it not really that bird which it is
> said exists, the lightning-bird which goes with the lightning?" He is
> in doubt because he sees that its characteristics are not like those
> of birds which he has known for a long time; he sees that it is quite
> peculiar, for its feathers glisten. A man may think that it is red;
> again he sees that it is not so, it is green. But if he looks
> earnestly he may say, "No, it is something between the two colours, as
> I am looking at it." And I myself once saw a feather of this bird
> whilst I was living on the Umsunduzi; for I had wished for a long time
> to see the colour of the bird; and at length I saw one of its
> feathers. The man to whom it belonged <span id="page_384">p.
> 384</span> took it out of his bag; and truly I saw it, and said,
> "Indeed it is the feather of a dreadful bird." He also showed me one
> of its bones; it was like a bone in which are many little
> blood-vessels and many little grey lines; I saw many lines in the
> bone, and said, "Truly." This then is what I have heard on this
> matter, and that was confirmed by what I saw for myself with my own
> eyes.
>
>  When we say herding-doctors, we speak metaphorically, for a man who
> herds cattle has weapons and his rain-shield.<span
> id="page_384_fr_36"></span>[36](#page_384_note_36.md) We take the name of
> a herder of cattle, and give it to one who counteracts the lightning,
> for when he keeps it back he shouts as a boy who is herding cattle; if
> he goes into the cattle-pen with his weapons and is silent, the cattle
> cannot go out; but by whistling the cattle understand that he tells
> them to go to the pastures, that is, to go out of the pen. And the
> herd that herds the lightning does the same as the herder of the
> cattle; he does as he does by whistling; he says, "Tshui-i-i. Depart,
> and go yonder; do not come here." He repeats this again and again.
>
>  Such doctors as these say they have a common feeling with the heaven.
> They say this because <span id="page_385">p. 385</span> sometimes it
> is said a certain doctor sends the lightning<span
> id="page_385_fr_37"></span>[37](#page_385_note_37.md) to another doctor
> to try him whether he is a powerful doctor or not. He does not try the
> doctor who appointed him; he tries others whose appointment he does
> not understand;<span
> id="page_385_fr_38"></span>[38](#page_385_note_38.md) for it is this by
> which he sees that another is a doctor indeed, by his sending back to

>  It happened in times past when I visited my people, on my arrival I
> lay down; on the following day in the afternoon the sky became
> overcast, and was very dark indeed; at the time when the maize was
> blossoming. I was sitting at the doorway whilst it was thundering
> excessively; and my brother who is a doctor entered the house,
> running, and took down his shield and his string of medicines, and
> went out. When it thundered aloud, he too shouted aloud, and whistled.
> I asked my mother what the man was doing. She replied, "Do not speak,
> for when it is like this no one any longer speaks. He is a
> heaven-herd." So I was silent. And the heaven cast down many
> hail-stones. And I thought he would die, for I heard them striking on
> his shield; it was as though maize had been thrown on him. But
> although he was resisted very much, he did not enter the house. And as
> regards the lightning, in like manner the heaven resisted him; but he
> did not enter the house until it was bright again.
>
>  In the morning I heard it said that at my uncle's village, at Inyama,
> down the river, one Umathlati said he would go out before the great
> doctors went out; he shouted aloud, saying, "Depart, <span
> id="page_387">p. 387</span> and go yonder." But the hail smote loudly
> on his body, and he came into the house backwards. Another went out,
> and when he shouted, the heaven stopped his mouth. On that day the
> heaven turned its back<span
> id="page_387_fr_40"></span>[40](#page_387_note_40.md) on the village; it
> was entirely in its power, and it did its will. They remained in their
> houses; it entirely destroyed the corn.
>

> herd?"

> id="page_389">p. 389</span> drink if he is given beer in a cup that is
> not full." And, "Let him not eat herbs before the feast of
> firstfruits."<span id="page_389_fr_42"></span>[42](#page_389_note_42.md)

> rain-man;<span id="page_389_fr_44"></span>[44](#page_389_note_44.md) his
> name was Umkqaekana. He was a great doctor even among the
> Amazulu,<span id="page_389_fr_45"></span>[45](#page_389_note_45.md)
> skilful <span id="page_390">p. 390</span> in producing rain. But among
> the Amazulu he did not show himself much to the chief; for the chiefs
> of the house of Uzulu used not to allow a mere inferior<span
> id="page_390_fr_46"></span>[46](#page_390_note_46.md) to be even said to
> have power over the heaven; for it was said that the heaven belonged
> only to the chief of that place. Umkqaekana therefore remained hidden.
> But he did not cease to produce rain in secret. At length he crossed
> to this side the Utukela, for he heard that Utshaka had said, "Let all
> the heaven-doctors be killed." He escaped, and came among the English;
> he came here without any property, by himself alone.<span
> id="page_390_fr_47"></span>[47](#page_390_note_47.md) He came without any
> thing, because he came to his own relations.
>
>  He became a dependent of the chief of the Amadhlala; it is the same
> to whom we were subject; his name was Unjeje, the son of Usechele. And
> when he had staid a short time, the heaven became very hot and
> dry.<span id="page_390_fr_48"></span>[48](#page_390_note_48.md) His own

> man; if you ask him, he can cause the rain to drop for you. <span
> id="page_391">p. 391</span> He is a great doctor above all other
> doctors."
>
>  And this was first spoken of a little, and at last openly; and we all
> heard that Umkqaekana was a rain-doctor. The chief asked him just to
> set to work, that he might see if it were true or not. And—for at that
> time the heaven was hot and dry—I heard it said, "Umkqaekana says,
> 'Let the people look at the heaven at such a time; it will rain.'"
>
>  And he went away into the forest to get his things ready; he went
> there continually, until the day he had mentioned came. And when it
> rained, the people said, "Truly, he is a doctor!" And it was always
> thus. He was given cattle, and very quickly became rich.
>
>  And after that year the heaven was hard, and it did not rain. The
> people persecuted him exceedingly. When he was persecuted I saw him
> and pitied him, for I saw men come even by night and smite his doorway
> with clubs, and take him out of his house, telling him to come out and
> give them back their cattle which they had given him, because the
> heaven no longer yielded rain. They did this constantly. And he was
> greatly troubled, for sometimes they came in the morning and took him
> out of his house; he fled, and they <span id="page_392">p. 392</span>
> threw clubs at him; he ran away down into the bush, until the sun set,
> without eating, being afraid to go home; for they said they would
> really kill him, if it did not rain. But they said that through their
> subtlety, thinking that he would do what they wished at once, because
> he expected them to kill him. And I saw that it sometimes rained
> whilst he was working.
>
>  And on another year, when they saw that the heaven wished to destroy
> the corn, they hated him exceedingly. I was not there at that time. I
> was with my own people, the Amapepete. I heard it said that it rained
> excessively, that it might cover the dead body of Umkqaekana with
> earth. It is said they poisoned him, and did not stab him. I heard it
> said that those people were troubled, for their gardens were carried
> away by a flood. This then is what I heard of this rain-doctor.

> *Magical Songs.*

<span class="small">I<span class="small">N</span> the *Zulu Nursery
Tales* we meet with an instance of the use of an incantation or magical
song to produce a storm. Umkxakaza-wako-gingqwayo sung her song, and
raised the tempest which destroyed the Amadhlungundhlebe. (*P*. 203.) In
another case, Ubongopa-kama-gadhlela raised a storm by spitting on the
ground. The spittle boiled up and saluted him; a great storm arose, from
which every one suffered but himself. (*P*. 228.) Every tribe has its
tribal or national song, which is called "The chief's song." This song
is sung on two occasions only; on the feast of firstfruits, when, if
there has been a continued drought, it is supposed to be capable of
causing rain; it is also sung by an army if overtaken with continuous
rain on the march; on singing the chief's song the rain ceases, and the
army is able to go on its way. Thus the national song is an incantation
supposed to be capable of producing rain, or causing it to cease. The
song of the Amapepete is given in the following account; its meaning is
scarcely understood.</span>

fireplace outside the kraal, but near it, where medicines capable of
influencing the heaven—heaven-medicines—are burnt.

 <span id="page_376_note_23"></span>[23](#page_376_fr_23.md) That is, by
burning the heaven-medicines whilst the hail is still distant, they
diminish its power, so that when it comes, if it should be able to come
at all, it may be unable to do any harm; but may be readily made to obey
the doctor's command to depart.

<span id="footnotes_page_377">p. 377</span>

 <span id="page_377_note_24"></span>[24](#page_377_fr_24.md) *Ukumelana
nezulu,—ukumelana nonyazi*,—to counteract the heaven or the
lightning,—is an expression we shall often meet with. I point out,
without being able to say whether there is any similarity in meaning, a
passage—[Ps. lxxiii. 9](../../bib/kjv/psa.htm#73:9.md)—"They set their
mouth against the heaven," which we shall best render by, *Ba melana
ngomlomo wabo nezulu*. No doubt the heaven in the Hebrew Scriptures is
often synonymous with God; in other places it is spoken of as an object
of idol-adoration. There were sorcerers, diviners, and those with
familiar spirits known to the Hebrews; there might also have been
rain-doctors and sky-doctors.

 <span id="page_377_note_25"></span>[25](#page_377_fr_25.md) That is,
whilst endeavouring to turn back the storm.

throughout spoken of as though it was a person, possessed of
intelligence. The literal translation of the sentence is: There is
thunder; if the heaven thunders, without bringing hail-stones, but urges
on the lightning.

<span id="footnotes_page_379">p. 379</span>

 <span id="page_379_note_27"></span>[27](#page_379_fr_27.md) From this it
is clear that we are not to regard the heaven-herd as an opponent of the
heaven; but as a priest to whom is entrusted the power of prevailing
mediation. He is under the protection of the heaven; and his enemies,
real or supposed, are liable to be destroyed by it, whilst he is safe so
long as he is observant of the laws of his office. Heathen have
sometimes asked me to pray for rain because I am one whose office it is
"ukumelana nenkosi," to contend with God. Compare [Gen. xxxii.
24](../../bib/kjv/gen.htm#32:24.md)-28. And see below, where the heaven
avenges the death of the rain-doctor.

<span id="footnotes_page_380">p. 380</span>

 <span id="page_380_note_28"></span>[28](#page_380_fr_28.md) Or sky-doctor,
heaven meaning the sky, which is not supposed to be very high above the
earth.

 <span id="page_380_note_29"></span>[29](#page_380_fr_29.md) Lit., about to
arm.

 <span id="page_380_note_30"></span>[30](#page_380_fr_30.md) I have
translated literally here, but it will be scarcely intelligible to the
English reader without explanation. The natives say they scarify with
the heaven, that is, make scarifications and rub in medicines, and eat
it. The heaven is here used for those substances in which it, or its
power or virtue, is supposed to be. A bullock struck with lightning is
supposed to have the heaven, or power of the heaven, in it; so the
thunderbolt which comes from heaven; and the fabulous bird which is
supposed to descend in a thunder storm. Therefore when they say they
scarify with the heaven, they mean that the doctors make scarifications
in their own bodies and rub in medicines mixed with the flesh of a
bullock struck with lightning, or with the thunderbolt, or with the
flesh of the *inyoni-yezulu*, the lightning-bird. And "eating the
heaven" means in like manner eating those things in which the heaven, or
its power or virtue, is supposed to be. By this practice they are
brought into sympathy with the heaven,—feel with it, know when it is
going to thunder, and are able to counteract it. Here again we see the
homœopathic principle coming out in their therapeutics, as we do in so
many other instances; *similia similibus*,— lightning by lightning.

 <span id="page_381_note_32"></span>[32](#page_381_fr_32.md) *Umsuka* is
the shank of an assagai, or of a native pick, or any thing of that kind.

 <span id="page_381_note_33"></span>[33](#page_381_fr_33.md) It is said
that the doctors are directed to the place where the thunderbolt is by
watching during a storm, and, going to the place where they suppose they
saw the lightning strike, they find a heap of jelly-like substance over
the spot where the bolt entered, and digging find it.

 <span id="page_381_note_34"></span>[34](#page_381_fr_34.md) In the legends
of the American Indians we meet with accounts of Thunder-birds, or
Cloud-birds. "They frequently explain the thunder as the sound of the
cloud-bird flapping his wings, and the lightning as the fire that
flashes from his tracks, like the sparks which the buffalo scatters when
he scours over the stony plain." A metaphor which probably arose from
personifying the clouds, and supposing that motion meant life, and where
there was a voice there must be a living being to utter it; like the
Maruts or Storm-gods of the Hindoo. The metaphor may have been a simple
metaphor at first, to become at last to the minds or the masses a truth
expressing a fact of nature. (*Brinton's Myths of the New World, p.*
102-104.)—A Dahcotah thus explains the theory of thunder:—"Thunder is a
large bird, flying through the air; its bright tracks are seen in the
heavens, before you hear the clapping of its wings. But it is the young
ones that do the mischief. The parent bird would not hurt a Dahcotah.
Long ago a thunder-bird fell from the heavens; and our fathers saw it as
it <span id="footnotes_page_382">p. 382</span> lay not far from the
Little Crow's village." (*Dahcotah; or, Life and Legends of the Sioux.
By Mrs. Mary Eastman, p.* 191.) See also the legend of Unktahe and the
Thunder-bird. Cloudy-Sky, during one of his earthly sojournings, had
allied himself with the thunder-birds to fight against the spirits of
the waters, and with his own hand killed the son of Unktahe, the God of
rivers. For this he was doomed to death on his fourth appearance on
earth as a great medicine-man. (*Id., p.* 213, *&c.*)—Catlin relates
that some Indians led him to "The Thunder's nest," where it is supposed
the thunder-bird, a very small bird indeed, hatches its eggs, and the
thunder is supposed to come out of the egg. (*Life among the Indians,
p.* 166.)—Jupiter's Eagle probably has some connection with such
legends.

have apparently an intimation that the *izinyanga* were priests—not
self-appointed, but commissioned by others who preceded them. But there
appears also to have been dissidents—those whose commission was not
known. Man is the same every where.

 <span id="page_385_note_39"></span>[39](#page_385_fr_39.md) We find
similar trials of skill among sorcerers of other countries. It is said a
German sorcerer was called to see if he could not "extinguish" our
far-famed sorcerer Roger Bacon. He raised a spirit which he ordered to
carry off Roger Bacon. But Roger was too strong for the German, and the
raised spirit, instead of taking away Roger as commanded, carried off
his own master.—In like manner "the priest Eiríkur" having snatched by
his sorcery from the hands of "the good folk of Sída" a murderer who was
condemned to lose his head,—a not very priestly act, it may be,—they
"hired a man from the West firths who dabbled in magic to send a great
cat to slay Eiríkur." Eiríkur's magic and prophetic power could not
protect him from this cat. The sender worked,—the "sending" was
sent,—and unlooked-for rushed upon its victim; and Eiríkur was saved,
not by magic and inner sight, but by "quickness" and help of a pupil in
sorcery. And "Puss," that is, the "sending," soon lay dead upon the
ground. Eiríkur had triumphed. But triumph is nothing without revenge.
He must teach the people that Eiríkur—priest and sorerer, strange but
not uncommon combination—must not be trifled with. So he "despatehed a
sending to the man in the West firths, and put an end to him almost as
quickly as to his goblin-cat." (*Icelandic Legends, p.* 262.)

<span id="footnotes_page_387">p. 387</span>

 <span id="page_387_note_40"></span>[40](#page_387_fr_40.md) It is well to
note this use of *fulatela*; to turn the back on an enemy means to have
conquered him utterly.

 <span id="page_387_note_41"></span>[41](#page_387_fr_41.md) Here we find
fasting—abstinence from food and labour—one of the conditions of
successful performance of the duties of an office. There is this saying
among the natives, "*Umzimba ow esutayo njalo-njalo u nge bone kahle
oku-imfihlo*," The continually stuffed body cannot see secret things.
And they have no faith in a fat diviner—do not believe that he can
divine. Their diviners fast often, and are worn out by fastings,
sometimes of several days' duration, when they become partially or
wholly ecstatic, and see visions, &c. This is very instructive, and
throws light on the results of fasting among those who suppose
themselves to be the objects of a divine revelation.

 It is curious how universally a system of fasting prevails amongst
different peoples, being regarded as a merit, or as a means of
preparation for a work, or for the reception of a revelation from a
superior power, or as an expression of self-contrition, or as a means of
producing a high order of spirituality. It would be interesting to trace
this custom to its root, but this is not the place for such a subject.
We may, however, refer to some instances among the Polynesians, where
neglect of fasting by others is supposed to have seriously interfered
with the work of some great man:—

 "Maui then left his brothers with their canoe, and returned to the
village; but before he went he said to them, 'After I am gone, be <span
id="footnotes_page_388">p. 388</span> courageous and patient; do not eat
food until I return, and do not let our fish be cut up, but rather leave
it until I have carried an offering to the gods from this great haul of
fish, and until I have found a priest, that fitting prayers and
sacrifices may be offered to the god, and the necessary rites be
completed in order. We shall thus all be purified. I will then return,
and we can cut up this fish in safety, and it shall be fairly portioned
out to this one, and to that one, and to that other; and on my arrival
you shall each have your due share of it, and return to your homes
joyfully; and what we leave behind us will keep good, and that which we
take away with us, returning, will be good too.'

 "Maui had hardly gone, after saying all this to them, than his brothers
trampled under their feet the words they had heard him speak. They began
at once to eat food, and to cut up the fish. When they did this, Maui
had not yet arrived at the sacred place, in the presence of the god; had
he previously reached the sacred place, the heart of the deity would
have been appeased with the offering of a portion of the fish which had
been caught by his disciples, and all the male and female deities would
have partaken of their portions of the sacrifice. Alas! alas! those
foolish, thoughtless brothers of his cut up the fish, and behold the
gods turned with wrath upon them, on account of the fish which they had
thus cut up without having made a fitting sacrifice. Then, indeed, the
fish began to toss about his head from side to side, and to lash his
tail, and the fins upon his back, and his lower jaw. Ah! ah! well done
Tangaroa, it springs about on shore as briskly as if it was in the
water.

 "That is the reason that this island is now so rough and uneven—that
here stands a mountain—that there lies a plain—that here descends a
vale—that there rises a cliff. If the brothers of Maui had not acted so
deceitfully, the huge fish would have lain flat and smooth, and would
have remained as a model for the rest of the carth, for the present
generation of men. This, which has just been recounted, is the second
evil which took place after the separation of Heaven from Earth."
(*Polynesian Mythology. By Sir George Grey. Pp.* 43-45.)

 So when the powerful magician Ngatoro-i-rangi wished to ascend to the
snow covered top of Mount Tongariro he said to his companions, "Remember
now, do not you, who I am going to leave behind, taste food from the
time I leave you until I return, when we will all feast together." Then
he began to ascend the mountain, but he had not quite got to the summit
when those he had left behind been to eat food, and he therefore found
the greatest difficulty in reaching the summit of the mountain, and the
hero nearly perished in the attempt. (*Id., p.* 156.)

<span id="footnotes_page_389">p. 389</span>

 <span id="page_389_note_42"></span>[42](#page_389_fr_42.md) At the period
of the year when the new food is ripe, varying with different places,
the chief summons all his people to a festival, (which is called
*ukudhlala umkosi*;) all the people make beer, which they take with them
to the chief's village; at the chief's village, too, much beer is made.
When the people are assembled the chief has oxen killed by his soldiers,
and there is a great feast of one day with singing and dancing. This is
called *ukushwama*, and the people return to their homes and begin to
eat the new produce. If any one is known to eat new food before this
festival he is regarded as an *umtakati*, and is killed, or has all his
cattle taken away.

 <span id="page_389_note_43"></span>[43](#page_389_fr_43.md) The natives

 <span id="page_393_note_51"></span>[51](#page_393_fr_51.md) The notion
that the heaven is a solid body or roof over this world is very common,
probably universal, among primitive peoples. The Hebrews spoke of it as
a firmament, that is, a beaten out solid expanse, which was "strong as a
molten looking glass." [Job. xxxvii. 18](../../bib/kjv/job.htm#37:18.md).
It was supposed to support a celestial reservoir of waters, and to have
doors, open lattices, and windows, through which rain, hail, and dew
descend. It also supported the heavenly bodies; and is spoken <span
id="footnotes_page_394">p. 394</span> of as a floor on which the throne
of God rests. [Ezek. i. 26](../../bib/kjv/eze.htm#1:26.md). The Greeks had
similar ideas, and applied the terms brazen and iron to the sky. The
Latin cœlum is a hollow place, or cave scooped out of solid space.
(*Smith's Dictionary of the Bible*. F<span
class="small">IRMAMENT</span>.) The Arabs believed in numerous heavens
one above the other, a belief which St. Paul entertained, and which is
common to the Hindus, and to the Polynesians. Among the Chinese there is
a myth, in which Puanku or Eldest-Antiquity is represented as having
spent 18,000 years in moulding chaos, and chiseling out a space that was
to contain him. And it is through openings made by his mighty hand that
the sun, moon, and stars appear; not as the Amazulu think, shining on
this side of the blue rock. (*See Nursery Tales of the Zulus. Vol. I.,
p.* 152. The Heaven-Country.) See some amusing diagrams by
Cosmas-Indicopleustes, made on the supposed revealed cosmogony of the
