# THE DEATH OF THE LIZARD.

The Lizard<span class="small">\[1\]</span> formerly sang--

"For,  
I therefore intend to go,  
Passing through,  
*!guru-\|na*'s pass.

"And,  
I therefore intend to go,  
Passing through,  
*\|Xe-!khwai*'s pass.

For,  
I therefore intend to go,  
passing through,  
*!guru-\|na*'s pass,

"For,  
I therefore intend to go,  
Passing through,  
*\|Xe-!khwai*'s pass.

 

And, when he was passing through, the mountains<span
class="small">\[2\]</span> squeezing broke him, when he had intended to
pass through; for, he seems to have thought that he would spring through
the mountain pass, which was like this (the narrator here showed

\[1. The *!khau* was a man of the early race. He is now a lizard of the
genus *Agama*. "Chiefly found in rocky and sandy places. Many species
distributed all through South Africa."

2\. These mountains are large ones, near *\|itten\|hing*.\]

the first and second fingers of his left hand in a forked and almost
upright position). Then, the mountains caught him thus (putting his
fingers close together), the mountains bit, breaking him. Therefore, his
forepart fell over<span class="small">\[1\]</span> (and) stood still) it
became *!guru-\|na*; while his hinder part fell over (and) stood still;
it was that which became *\|Xe-!khwai*.

REMARKS ON THE PRECEDING STORY BY THE NARRATOR.

I think that he seems to have been going to the red sand hills, that he
might come (and) dwell at them. For, I think that the (shallow) pools,
which lie among the red sand hills, seem to have been those towards
which he was going, that he might come (and) live at them. He seems to
have been going towards *!kaugen-\|ka\|ka* (a certain pool), that he
might come (and) live at it. For, I think that *!kaugen-\|ka\|ka* is
near this place. He is the one who, when he came passing through, would
come along the 'vlei', that he might ascend, passing along the side of
the hill; and he would altogether descend into *\|\|na-\|\|kuarra* (a
certain river), and he would go quite down, along (the river bed) to
*!kaugen-\|ka\|ka. !kaugen-\|ka\|ka* would be the place where he
descended; it was where he was going to dwell; it must, I think, be the
place towards which he appears to have been going. He broke (in twain)
when he seems to have been going towards it.
