# THE SONGS OF THE BLUE CRANE.

1\. It is the Blue Crane's story which it sings; it sings(about)its
shoulder, namely, that the"krieboom" berries are upon its shoulder; it
goes along singing--

The berries are upon my shoulder,  
The berries are upon my shoulder,  
The berry it<span class="small">\[1\]</span> is upon my shoulder,

\[1. Its name is one; they (the berries) are numerous; its name is
(still) one. The "krieboom" berries are many; the name of the berries is
one. It appears as if its berry were one, (but) they are many.

The word *\|gara* is the same in the singular and plural, viz., *\|gara*
(or *\|gara tsaXau)* *a !kwai*, "one *\|gara* berry," and *\|gara* (or
*\|gara tsaXaiten*) *e \|Ukwaiya*, "many *\|gara* berries." The *\|gara*
is a part of the *\|\|na*, or"krieboom", the berries of it, as far as I
can understand. They are said to be round, white, and "hard" (i.e., they
have something hard inside them). The outside flesh is sweet. They are
eaten by the Koranna and the Bushmen. The women go to the "krieboom",
pick the berries, put them into a bag and take them home to eat, first
mixing them with other berries. They do not eat them unmixed, on account
of their teeth, as they fear that the sweetness of the berries might
otherwise render their teeth unfit to chew meat well.\]

The berries are upon my shoulder.  
The berries are up here (on its shoulder),<span
class="small">\[1\]</span>  
*Rrru* are up here;  
The berries are up here,  
*Rrru* are up here,  
Are up here;  
The berries *Rrru* are put away (upon)it(its shoulder)."

2\.

(When running away from a man.)

A splinter of stone which is white,<span class="small">\[2\]</span>  
A splinter of stone which is white,  
A splinter of stone which is white.

3\.

(When walking slowly, leaving the place <span class="small">\[walk of
peace\]</span>.)

A white stone splinter,  
A white stone splinter.

4\.

(When it flaps its wings.)

Scrape (the springbok skin<span class="small">\[3\]</span> for) the
bed.  
Scrape (the springbok skin for) the bed.

Rrrru rrra,  
Rrru rrra  
Rru rra!

\[1. *\|\|kabbo* cannot explain why the berries do not roll off; he says
that he does not know. This is a song of the very old people, the
"first" old people, which was in his thoughts.

2\. *\|\|kabbo* explains that the bird sings about its head, which is
something of the shape of a stone knife or splinter, and has white
feathers. He says that Bushmen, when without a knife, use a stone knife
for cutting up game. They break a stone, knocking off a flat splinter
from it, and cut up the game with that. The Grass Bushmen, *\|\|kabbo*
says, make arrowheads of white quartz points (crystal points, as far as
could be understood).

3\. The Bushmen make beds (*i.e.*, skins to sleep on) from the skins of
springbok and goats.\]
