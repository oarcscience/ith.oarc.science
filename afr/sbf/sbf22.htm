<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE MASON WASP<SMALL>[1]</SMALL> AND HIS WIFE.</H1>
<P>The Mason Wasp<SMALL>[2]</SMALL> formerly did thus as he walked along, while (his) wife walked behind him, the wife said: "O my husband! Shoot for me that hare!" And the Mason Wasp laid down his quiver; the Mason Wasp said: "Where is the hare? And (his) wife said: The hare lies there."</P>
<P>And the Mason Wasp took out an arrow; the Mason Wasp in this manner went stooping along.<SMALL>[3]</SMALL> And the wife said: "Put down (thy) kaross! Why is it that thou art not willing to put down (thy) kaross?" Therefore, the Mason Wasp, walking along, unloosened the strings of the kaross; he put down the kaross. Therefore the wife said: "Canst thou be like this?<SMALL>[4]</SMALL> This must have been why thou wert not willing to lay down the kaross."</P>
<P>Therefore, the Mason Wasp walked, turning to one side; he aimed at (his) wife, he shot, hitting the (head of) the arrow on (his) wife's breast<SMALL>[5]</SMALL> (bone).</P>
<P><SMALL>[1. The Mason Wasp resembles the <I>Palpares</I> and <I>Libellula</I>. It has a small body. The Mason Wasp flies, and is to be seen in summer near water; <I>|hang#kass'o</I> has seen it in our garden at Mowbray. it is rather smaller than the <I>Palpares</I> and <I>Libellula</I>.</P>
<P>2. He was formerly a man; therefore, he had a bow; therefore, he shot his wife, when he had not shot the hare.</P>
<P>3. We are accustomed to go along stooping, when we wish that the hare may quietly lie hidden (knowing that people are at hand; lying still, thinking that it will be passed by).</P>
<P>4. She mocked at the man on account of the middle of the man's body, which was slender; hence she mocked at the man.</P>
<P>5. <I>i.e.</I> breaking her breastbone.]</SMALL></P>
<P>And (his) wife fell down dead on account of it. Then he exclaimed: "<I>Yi ii hihi</I>! O my wife <I>hi</I>!" (crying) as if he had not been the one to shoot (his) wife. He cried, that he should have done thus, have shot his wife; his wife died.</P>
