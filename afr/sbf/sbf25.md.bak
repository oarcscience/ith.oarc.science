# THE GIRL'S STORY; THE FROGS' STORY.

A girl formerly lay ill; she was lying down. She did not eat the food
which her mothers<span class="small">\[1\]</span> gave her. She lay ill.

She killed the children of the Water<span class="small">\[2\]</span>;
they were what she ate. Her mothers did not know that she did thus,
(that) she killed the Water's children; (that) they were what she ate;
she would not eat what her mothers were giving to her.

Her mother was there. They<span class="small">\[3\]</span> went out to
seek Bushman rice. They<span class="small">\[4\]</span> spoke, they
ordered a

\[1. That is to say, her mother and the other women.

2\. *!kweiten ta \|\|ken* has not seen these things herself, but she
heard that they were beautiful, and striped like a *\|habba*, i.e.
zebra.

3\. The Water was as large as a bull, and the Water's children were the
size of calves, being the children of great things.

4\. All the women, and all the children but one.\]

child<span class="small">\[1\]</span> to remain at home. The girl did
not know (about) the child. And the old woman said that she must look at
the things which her elder sister ate. And they left the child at home;
and they went out to seek food (Bushman rice). They intended (?) that
the child should look at the things which her elder sister ate.

The elder sister went out from the house of illness, (and) descended to
the spring, as she intended again to kill a Water-child. The (Bushman)
child was in the hut,<span class="small">\[3\]</span> while she (the
girl) did not know (about) the child. And she went (and) killed a
Water-child, she carried the Water-child home. The (Bushman) child was
looking; and she (the girl) boiled the Water-child's flesh; and she ate
it; and she lay down; and she again went to lie down, while she (the
child) beheld her. And she went to lie down, when she felt that she had
finished eating. The child looked at her; and she lay down.

And her mother returned. The child told her mother about it; for her
elder sister had gone to kill a handsome thing at the water. And her
mother said: "It is a Water-child!" And her mother did not speak about
it; she again went out to seek for Bushman rice.

And when she was seeking about for food, the clouds came up. And she
spoke, she said: "Something is not right at home; for a whirlwind is
bringing (things) to the spring. For something is not going on well at
home. Therefore, the whirlwind is taking (things) away to the spring."

\[1. A little girl, as big as a European child of 11.

2\. Literally, "allowed" her to remain there.

3\. In her mother's hut.\]

Because her daughter killed the Water's children, therefore the
whirlwind took them away to the spring. Something had not gone well at
home, for her daughter had been killing the Water's children. That was
why the whirlwind took them away to the spring. Because her daughter
killed the Water's children, therefore the whirlwind took them away to
the spring; because she had killed the Water's children.

The girl was the one who first went into the spring, and then she became
a frog. Her mothers afterwards went into the spring; the whirlwind
brought them to it, when she was already in the spring. She was a frog.
Her mothers also became frogs; while the whirlwind was that which
brought them, when they were on the hunting ground; the whirlwind
brought them to the spring, when her daughter was already in the spring.
She was a frog. And her mothers afterwards came; the whirlwind was that
which brought them to it, when they were on the hunting ground.
Meanwhile their daughter was in the spring; she was a frog.

Her father also came to become a frog; for the whirlwind brought her
father-when he was yonder on the hunting ground-to the spring, (to) the
place where his daughter was. Her father's arrows<span
class="small">\[1\]</span> altogether grew out by the spring; for the
great whirlwind had brought them to the spring. He also altogether
became a frog; likewise his wife, she also became a frog; while she felt
that the whirlwind had brought them to the spring. Their things entered
that spring (in which) they were. The

<span class="small">\[1. All the family and their mats were carried into
the spring, by the whirlwind, and all their things.\]</span>

things entered that spring, because they (the people) were frogs.
Therefore it was that their things went into the spring, because they
were frogs. The mats<span class="small">\[1\]</span> (grew) out by the
spring, like the arrows; their things grew out<span
class="small">\[2\]</span> by the spring.

\[1. Mats of which the Bushmen make their huts (made from a thick grass
or reed?).

2\. These things that grow by the springs belonged to the first Bushmen,
who preceded the present race, *!kweiten ta \|\|ken* says. Her mother
told her this.\]
