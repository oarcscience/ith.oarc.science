# THE MARKING OF ARROWS.

The Bushmen are those who mark arrows,<span class="small">\[1\]</span>
while they wish that they may recognize the arrows, when they are
shooting springbok at one place. And, when they are following the
springbok spoor, when

<span class="small">\[1. All the arrows.\]</span>

they are going along picking up the arrows they recognize the arrows.
They say: "Thy arrow it seems to be, for, their mark is like this."
Another man says: "Yes, my arrow is yonder." They again go to pick up
this arrow. The other man says: "My arrow seems to be yonder; for their
mark is like this."

\|kwae<span class="small">\[1\]</span> is that with which they make the
marks. They put *tto* into (it), and they pound the *tto* together with
the *\|\|kuae*; and the *\|\|kuae* becomes red on account of it; then,
they mark the arrows with it.

<span class="small">\[1. They (the farmers) call it "Harpis." (Probably
harpuis, \* \* \* "resin.")\]</span>
