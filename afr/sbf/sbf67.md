# HOW THE DANCING RATTLES ARE PREPARED.

A woman takes off the skin<span class="small">\[1\]</span> of the
springbok's ear; and then, she sews the inner skin of the springbok's
ear, when she has laid aside the (hairy) skin of the springbok's ear;
for it is the inner skin of its ear which she sews. And she sews it, and
she scoops up with her hand, putting soft earth into it. And they dig,
lading in earth, because they wish that the springbok ears may dry; that
they may put in *\|\|kerri*<span class="small">\[2\]</span> berries when
they have taken out the earth. And then they tie on a small piece of
sinew at the tip of the springbok ear, which was open, while they tie
shutting in the *\|\|kerri* berries, so that the *\|\|kerri* berries may
not come out of the springbok ear. And they pierce through the springbok
ears; and they put in little threads, which the men are to tie,
fastening the springbok ears on their feet.<span

\[1. The hairy skin.

2\. The top of this plant is described as being like that of a pumpkin.
Its seeds are black, and small. They are found underneath the flower,
which is red. The root is roasted and eaten by the Bushmen. The seeds
are also eaten, unroasted; being, when dry, pounded fine by the women
with stones, and mixed with "Kambro" in order to moisten them for
eating.

3\. The narrator explains that the springbok ears, when thus prepared
and filled, are tied, in fours or fives, on to the top of each foot (on
the instep), letting the men's toes appear below them.\]
