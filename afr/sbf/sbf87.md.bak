# THE FOUR PIECES OF WOOD CALLED \|XU<span class="small">\[1\]</span>, USED FOR DIVINING PURPOSES.

The *!kung* women respect these things, (they) do not take hold (of
them). Men take hold (of them). A small *!kung* child, who is a little
girl, does not take hold of this thing; for (she) respects (it). For,
her mother says to her: "This thing, thou must respect, my mother." And
the child listens, (and) respects the thing; but a little male child
does not fear the thing, (and) takes hold of the thing, (and) carries,
carries the thing to his father.

And his father puts down<span class="small">\[2\]</span> the thing upon
the ground, and (the child) does not see (or look at) the thing, he goes
away. For his father objects

\[1. The *\|Xu* is a set of four pieces of wood, two "male" and two
"female ". Spoons are also made from the wood of the same tree. The
narrator described it as follows:--

The name of the tree is *!ke*; and (it) is a food tree; (it) is not a
mere tree. (It is) one tree, (from) which we make the thing (i.e., the
set of

!Xu).

By the Makoba, the *!Xu* is called *\|nu\|num*. Their name for the fruit
of the *!ke* tree is *kanzuai*.

2\. (When putting down) one thing, I say *\|\|ning*; (when putting down)
several things, I say *\|\|ning-a*.\]

(to his looking on, and says): "Go, my father!"<span
class="small">\[1\]</span> The child laughs, and runs off, goes to his
mother, (and) says to his mother: "My mother! give water." For the child
ran, coming (and) saying to his mother:

Give my father water."

And his mother took water (from the pot) with a gourd(?), the skin of
food; and gave her child water; and her child carried the (vessel of)
water in his hands, carried water to his father. And the water (vessel)
fell, and (the water) poured upon the ground; and he (the boy) saw, and
cried out: "My father! the water pours down, oh dear! My father! the
water pours down, oh dear!" And his father heard him, and ran, coming to
take hold of him. And (he) beat his child, broke off a little stick, and
beat his child; and the little stick was a *shana*. And his son's speech
was this (?): "My father! leave off beating me! oh dear! My father!
leave off beating me! oh dear! My father! leave off striking me! oh
dear! My father! leave off striking me! oh dear!"

And the people<span class="small">\[2\]</span> took hold of him, his
mother came to take hold of him (saying): "My mother! my child! oh dear!
My mother! my child! oh dear! My mother! my husband is striking my
child, oh dear!"

His (the child's) father came and took (his) quiver, and drew out an
arrow, and put his arrow upon his bow; and the people (i.e., the women)
called out. For, he took aim at his wife with (two) arrows; for his
arrows were a *\|nubbo*, and a *\|\|Xi.*<span class="small">\[3\]</span>

\[1. (He) caressed (?) his child; for his child was a little boy.

2\. (They) were not men, but were women.

3\. He aimed at his wife with two arrows (one after the other).\]

And his wife cried, and avoided the arrow. And (she) cried; and his
wife's mother cried: "My mother! my son-in-law takes aim at my daughter
with two arrows, oh dear!" And (she) fell down, and lay upon the ground,
and cried; and the people (many other women) came (and) took hold of
her, and said to her: "Do not cry!" And she refused (saying): "No! my
son-in-law aims at my daughter with two arrows, oh dear!" And the people
took hold of her; and she would not listen to the people, and refused.
