# THE SONG OF !NU!NUMMA-!KWITEN.

!nu!numma-!kwiten<span class="small">\[1\]</span> formerly said (sang)-

"Hng-ng, hng;  
I kill children who cry;  
Hng-ng, hng.  
I kill children who cry;  
Hng-ng, hng;  
I kill children who cry.

A beast of prey (he, *!nu!numma-!kwiten*) is. My grandfather used to say
(that) *!nu!numma-!kwiten* formerly said-

"Hng-ng, hng;  
I kill children who cry;  
"Hng-ng, hng;  
I kill children who cry;

When my grandfather wished that we should leave off making a noise,<span
class="small">\[2\]</span> he said that *!nu!numma-!kwiten* formerly
used to say

"Hng-ng, hng;  
I kill children who cry;  
"Hng-ng, hng;  
I kill children who cry;

\[1. The narrator gave the following explanation of
*!nu!numma-!kwiten*'s name:--

"A man who eats great (pieces of) meat, he cuts them off, he puts them
into his mouth. I think that eggs are white; therefore, I think that his
name seems to be 'White-Mouth'."

"*!nu!numma-!kwiten* is a beast of prey. A man was the one who gobbled
eggs, swallowed down eggs. Therefore, be was <span class="small">\[his
name was\]</span> *!kotta-kkoe*." Reference is here made to a man of the
early race, who swallowed ostrich eggs whole, and is the chief figure in
a legend related by *\|han\#kass'o* (V.--56. *L*.).

2\. We were calling out, making a noise there, as we played.\]

And (when) he hears a little child crying there, he follows the sound to
it, while the little child is crying there, he, following the sound,
goes to it, approaches it stealthily, approaching stealthily, reaches
the hut, in which the little child is crying. He springs, springs into
the hut. He catches hold of the little child) he springs, taking it
away. He goes to swallow it down. He departs.
