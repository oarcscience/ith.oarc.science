# MODE OF GETTING RID OF THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF BAD DREAMS.

My mother used to do in this manner, when she intended to go out to seek
for food, when she was about to start, she took a stone; (and) as she
plunged the stone into the ashes of the fire, she exclaimed: "Rider(?)
yonder!" while she wished that the evil things, about which she had been
dreaming, should altogether remain in the fire; instead of going out
with her. For, if she did not act in this manner, they would go out with
her. That place to which she went would not be nice; while she knew that
she had dreamt of evil things which were not nice. Therefore, she acted
in this manner; because she was aware that, if she went out with the
dream which she had dreamt, her going out would not be fortunate.

The Bushman rice which she dug would not be favourable to her, because
it was aware that she had dreamt evil things. Therefore, the Bushman
rice would not be favourable to mamma; while the Bushman rice was aware
that mamma had dreamt evil things; therefore, the Bushman rice would act
in this manner about it.
