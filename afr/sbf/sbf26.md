# THE MAN WHO ORDERED HIS WIFE TO CUT OFF HIS EARS.

He<span class="small">\[1\]</span> formerly wished (his) wife to cut off
his ears, for his younger brother's head had surely been skinned<span
class="small">\[2\]</span>; whereas his younger brother's wife had only
shaved his younger brother's head.

Therefore, (his) wife cut away his ears; although (his) wife had said
that she would not do so; he was the one who insisted (upon it).

Therefore, (his) wife cut off his ears; and he was screaming, on account
of his skin, while he himself had been the one who wished the wife to do
so; for his younger brother's head had surely been skinned; whereas his
younger brother had merely had his head shaved; while (his) wife shaved,
removing the old hair.<span class="small">\[3\]</span>

\[1. *!Xwe-\|na-sse-!k'e* is the name of the Bushmen who lived first in
the land.

2\. I am one who does not know his name, because the people were those
who did not utter his name to me; for, they were men of the early race;
therefore, they did foolish things on account of it.

3\. He really thought that the skin of his younger brother's head was
off, while it was his younger brother's head's hair which had been
shaved away.\]
