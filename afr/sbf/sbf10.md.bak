# THE GREAT STAR, !GAUNU, WHICH, SINGING, NAMED THE STARS.

!gaunu,<span class="small">\[1\]</span> he was formerly a great Star;
therefore, his name is *!gaunu*; while he feels that he was the one who
formerly spoke (lit. "called") the Stars' names; while he feels that he
is a great one. Therefore, he called the Stars' names. Therefore, the
Stars possess their names; while they feel that *!gaunu* was the one who
called their names. He formerly sang, while he uttered the Stars' names.
He said "*\|\|Xwahai*"<span class="small">\[2\]</span> to (some) Stars
which are very small; they are those of which he made *\|\|Xwhai*; their
small, fine ones are those which are

\|\|Xwhai.

\[1. My (paternal) grandfather, *\|Xugen-ddi*, was the one who told me
star's stories."

2\. The stars *\|\|Xwahai \|aiti* and *\|\|Xwhai-@pua* were identified
as "Altair" or "Alpha Aquilae", and "Gamma Aquilae", respectively, by
the late Mr. George Maclear and Mr. Finlay of the Royal Observatory, on
October 10, 1873, at Mowbray. *\|\|Xwhai gwai* was behind a tree and too
low to be distinguished.\]

Therefore, the porcupine, when these Stars have, sitting, turned back,
he will not remain on the hunting ground; for, he knows that it is dawn,
when *\|\|Xwhai* has, lying, turned back. He returns home; for, he is
used to look at these Stars; they are those which he watches; while he
feels that he knows that the dawn's Stars they are.
