<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">HOW TTO IS OBTAINED.</H1>
<I><P>Tto</I> is in the mountain, the <I>tto</I> mine; the people say that the <I>tto</I> mine is on the side of the mountain, the people say '<I>tto</I> mine' to it.</P>
<P>The people are afraid of it <SMALL>[that is, of the sorcerers who live by the mine]</SMALL>, because the people are aware that people are there (sorcerers). They (the sorcerers) make a house<SMALL>[1]</SMALL> there. Therefore, the people who intend to pound <I>tto</I>, rub themselves when they (go to) collect <I>tto</I>. And when they go to the <I>tto</I>, they throw stones at the <I>tto</I> mine, when they wish the sorcerers to bide themselves, that they may go undisturbed to work at the <I>tto</I>, while they feel that the sorcerers dwell at the <I>tto</I> mine. Therefore, they take up stones, they throw stones at the <I>tto</I> mine, when they wish the sorcerers to hide themselves, that they may go in peace<SMALL>[2]</SMALL> to work at the <I>tto</I>. And they go to work at the <I>tto</I>, <I>tto</I>, <I>tto</I>. They also get <I>||hara</I>;<SMALL>[3]</SMALL> they put away the <I>||hara</I> and the <I>tto</I>, and they return home.</P>
<P><SMALL>[1. The narrator thinks that their houses are small holes, like mouse-holes.</P>
<P>2. For, they would be ill, if the sorcerers saw them.</P>
<P>3. The <I>||hara</I> mine <SMALL>[literally, "mouth" or "opening "]</SMALL> is in a different place; the <I>tto</I> mine is also in a different place.]</SMALL></P>
