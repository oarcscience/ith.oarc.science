# DOINGS OF THE SPRINGBOK.

The mother springbok is wont to do thus, as she trots along, when she
has a springbok kid which is little, she grunts,<span
class="small">\[1\]</span> as she trots along; she says-- "*a, a, a*"
<span class="small">\[2\]</span> as she trots along. Therefore they (the
springbok) make a resounding noise(?), because they are numerous; while
the springbok kids also cry (bleat), while their mothers cry (grunt).
Their mothers say--"*a, a, a,*" the springbok kids say-

\[1. Because she protectingly takes along the child, she grunts, as the
child plays.

2\. Here the narrator made a grunting noise which, he said, was "in his
throat"; and about which he remarked--"When I sit imitating the
springbok, then I cough, on account of it."\]

"*me, me, me,*" while their mothers say "*a, a, a,*" as they grunt. The
springbok children say "*me, me, me,*" while their mothers say "*a, a,
a,*" as they grunting go forward.

Therefore,<span class="small">\[1\]</span> we are wont to say--"O beast
of prey! thou art the one who hearest the place behind, it is resonant
with sound. Therefore, I said that I would sit here. For these male
springbok which stand around, are those which will go along, passing
behind you; because I am lying down, and they do not perceive me; they
will have to (?) go along, passing behind you, when ye have gone behind
(the hill); they will have to (?) go along, passing behind you."

<span class="small">\[1. Therefore, the Bushmen are wont to say: "O
beast of prey! it (the herd of springbok) seems as if it will arise; for
thou art the one who seest the springbok's children. For thou art the
one who seest (that) the springbok's children seem as if (they) would
arise." (They had been lying down, or, as the narrator expressed it,
"sitting.")\]</span>
