And they were taking hold<span class="small">\[1\]</span> of the pieces
of skin, they swallowed them down. Their elder sister's husband scolded
them, because they again, they ate with their elder sister, of the
springbok's skin, when they had just eaten the body of the springbok,

And they were afraid of their elder sister's husband, they went away,
they went in all directions, they, in this manner, sat down. And they
looked at their elder sister's husband, they were looking furtively at
their elder sister's husband.

springbok. Therefore, the wife should go with him. Then, the wife went
with him.

shalt ascend, and then thou must come to tell us what the place seems to
be like." And another said: "Little sister<span
class="small">\[4\]</span> shall be the one to try; and then, she must
tell us." And then, a Vulture who was a little Vulture girl, she arose,
she ascended.

They said: "Allow us, that we may see what little sister will do." Then,
she went, disappearing in the sky, they no longer perceived her.

They sat; they were awaiting the time at which their younger sister
should descend. Then, their younger sister descended (lit. fell) from
above out of the sky, she (came and) sat in the midst of them.

And they exclaimed Ah! What is the place like? "And their younger sister
said: "Our mate<span class="small">\[5\]</span> who is here shall
ascend, that she may look. For, the place seems as if we should perceive
a thing, when we are above there."

Then, her elder sister who was a grown up girl, she arose, she ascended,
she went, disappearing in

"There is nothing the matter with the place; for, the place is clear.
The place is very beautiful; for, I do behold the whole place; the stems
of the trees,<span class="small">\[2\]</span> I do behold them; the
place seems as if we should perceive a springbok, if a springbok were
lying under a tree; for the place is very beautiful."

Then, they altogether arose, all of them, they ascended into the
sky,<span class="small">\[3\]</span> while they wished that their elder
sister should eat; for, their elder sister's husband scolded them.

Therefore, they used, when they espied their elder sister's husband
coming, they ate in great haste. They said: "Ye must eat! ye must eat!
ye must eat in great haste! for, that accursed man who comes yonder, he
could not endure us." And, they finished the springbok, they flew away,
flew heavily away, they thus, they yonder alighted; while their elder
sister's husband came to pick up the bones.

They, when they perceived a springbok, they descended, and their elder
sister perceived them, their elder sister followed them up.<span

the meat which is in the springbok's skin."<span
class="small">\[2\]</span> And, they left (it).<span
class="small">\[3\]</span> And, when they beheld that their elder sister
drew near to them, they went away, they went in all directions.

as if I had been the one who scolded you!"

class="small">\[3\]</span> took up the springbok, she returned home;
while the Vultures went forward (?), they went to fly about, while they
sought for another springbok, which they intended again to eat.

the upper part of the spine.

2\. The word *\|kuaiten*, translated here as "undercut" (in accordance
with the description of its position), bears some resemblance to that
given for "biltong flesh", in the Katkop dialect, by *Dia!kwnain*, which
is *\|kwaii*.

3\. They ate the skin together (with the meat).

4\. It is possible that the pronoun *hi* may have combined with the verb
