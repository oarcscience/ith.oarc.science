# HOW TTO IS OBTAINED.

Tto is in the mountain, the *tto* mine; the people say that the *tto*
mine is on the side of the mountain, the people say '*tto* mine' to it.

The people are afraid of it <span class="small">\[that is, of the
sorcerers who live by the mine\]</span>, because the people are aware
that people are there (sorcerers). They (the sorcerers) make a
house<span class="small">\[1\]</span> there. Therefore, the people who
intend to pound *tto*, rub themselves when they (go to) collect *tto*.
And when they go to the *tto*, they throw stones at the *tto* mine, when
they wish the sorcerers to bide themselves, that they may go undisturbed
to work at the *tto*, while they feel that the sorcerers dwell at the
*tto* mine. Therefore, they take up stones, they throw stones at the
*tto* mine, when they wish the sorcerers to hide themselves, that they
may go in peace<span class="small">\[2\]</span> to work at the *tto*.
And they go to work at the *tto*, *tto*, *tto*. They also get
*\|\|hara*;<span class="small">\[3\]</span> they put away the *\|\|hara*
and the *tto*, and they return home.

\[1. The narrator thinks that their houses are small holes, like
mouse-holes.

2\. For, they would be ill, if the sorcerers saw them.

3\. The *\|\|hara* mine <span class="small">\[literally, "mouth" or
"opening "\]</span> is in a different place; the *tto* mine is also in a
different place.\]
