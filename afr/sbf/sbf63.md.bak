# THE MAKING OF CLAY POTS.

The women dig, removing the earth which lies above, lifting it away; and
they only dig out the earth<span class="small">\[1\]</span> which is
inside there. And they scoop it out; they put it into the bag. And they
sling it (the earth) over their <span class="small">\[left\]</span>
shoulder, they take it home.

And, as they return, they go along plucking grass, they only pluck the
male grass; they bind it together. And they take it to the hut.

And they pound the pot (clay),<span class="small">\[2\]</span> pound
(it), making it soft.<span class="small">\[3\]</span> And they pound the
grass, they also pound, making the grass soft. And they put the grass
into the earth; and they make the earth wet. And they make the earth
wet, and they make the earth very nice indeed, and they mould<span
class="small">\[4\]</span>

\[1. The earth resembles stones which contain things which seem to
glitter. Hence, the earth of which the people make a pot contains
things, which are like them (i.e., like the said glittering particles).
The earth is red,

The earth to which the people go, to dig it out, is red. They call it "a
pot's hole", because they dig, making a stick's hole, there. Therefore,
they call it "a pot's hole".

2\. The earth of which they make the pot.

It is earth; it is dry; the people pound it (when) it is dry. And they
sift it, sift out the earth which is soft. And they pour down the earth
which is hard <span class="small">\[to be pounded again at another
time\]</span>. With regard to the soft earth, they pour it out upon a
skin <span class="small">\[a whole skin, which has no holes in it, a
springbok skin\]</span>.

3\. Pound, making it like sand. (They) put it upon a skin.

4\. They work it; they work, making a pot of it.\]

the earth. And, when they have made the lower part of the pot, they,
holding, break off the clay, they rub the clay between their hands. They
put the clay down (in a circle). And they smooth<span
class="small">\[1\]</span> the clay very nicely indeed; they moulding,
raise (the sides of) the pot. And they smooth it, smooth it, smooth it,
make it very nice indeed, they set it down to dry (in the sun).<span
class="small">\[2\]</span> And they make a little pot which is small,
beautiful beyond comparison. They anoint the pot with fat, while they
wish the pot not to split. Therefore, they anoint the pot with fat,
while the pot is still damp, when the pot has just newly dried, the
pot's inner part (the inner layers, not the inside) being still damp;
because they wish the pot to dry when it has fat upon it (inside and
out). And they set the pot (in the sun) to dry; they make a little pot;
they make it very nicely indeed. They set the little pot to dry (in the
sun) by the side of the large pot; and they take the other part of the
clay; they make it also wet. They mould it; they mould it very nicely
indeed; they set it down. They also make another little pot, a little
pot which is larger (lit. "grown"). And they set it to dry (in the sun).
When the pot dries, they also prepare gum;<span
class="small">\[3\]</span> they pound it (between stones); they pound
it, they pound, making it fine. They take it up in their hand (and) put
it into the pot; and they

\[1. This is done with a piece of bone called *!kau* or *!au* (See
IX.-185, and also illustration.)

2\. (They) wish that it may become dry.

3\. The berries (*lit.* "the eyes") of the "Doorn Boom" are black (i.e.
"black gum"). The people call them the dung of the "Doorn Boom", because
they come out of the stem of the *!khou* tree.

4\. A white gum, called *!gui*, seems also to be found on this tree.\]

pour in water <span class="small">\[into the new pot\]</span>. It <span
class="small">\[the gum\]</span> boils while they feel that gum is that
which adheres,<span class="small">\[1\]</span> it resembles *\|kwaie*.

And if springbok are at hand, a man kills a springbok, they pour the
springbok's blood into (its) stomach, and the man brings back the blood
he takes the blood home.

And the wife goes to pour the blood into the new pot. And she boils the
blood; and, when the blood is cooked, she takes the pot off the fire,
she takes the blood out of the pot (with a springbok horn spoon), and
she sets the pot down; because she wishes the blood <span
class="small">\[i.e., the blood remaining in the pot\]</span> to dry.

And she<span class="small">\[2\]</span> again takes the pot, and she
pours water into (it), she boils meat.

And, also, they do not strike with a stone,<span
class="small">\[3\]</span> when a new pot is on the fire, because they
wish it not to split.

\[1. They smear the pot outside <span class="small">\[with gum taken out
with the spoon, made from springbok horn, with which they stir the gum
which is boiling inside\]</span>, while they wish this gum to adhere to
the outside of the pot.

2\. A man works at springbok's arrows, making them straight. A woman
moulds pots.

3\. *\|hang\#kass'o* further stated that his wife, *Ssuobba-\|\|keng*,
had been taught to make pots by *\|Xu-ang* (an elder sister of her
mother, *!kuabba-ang*), and also by *\|Xu-ang* (another elder female
relative on the maternal side).

3\. To break bones (with a stone). The Bushmen do this because they do
not possess an axe. They place a bone upon a stone which stands upon the
ground, while they hold a stone which has a sharp edge, they strike with
it; strike, dividing the bone because they intend to boil it, that they
may gnaw it.\]
