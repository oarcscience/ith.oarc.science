# BUSHMAN PRESENTIMENTS<span class="small">\[2\]</span>

The Bushmen's letters<span class="small">\[3\]</span> are in their
bodies. They (the letters) speak, they, move, they make their (the
Bushmen's) bodies move. They (the Bushmen) order the others to be silent
a man is altogether still, when he feels that his body is tapping
(inside). A dream speaks falsely, it is (a thing) which deceives. The
presentiment is that which speaks the truth; it is that by means of
which the Bushman gets (or perceives) meat, when it has tapped.

\[3. The above piece of Bushman native literature is described by Dr.
Bleek as follows: "99. Bushman Presentiments.--They feel in their bodies
that certain events are going to happen. There is a kind of beating of
the flesh, which tells them things. Those who are stupid, do not
understand these teachings; they disobey them, and get into
trouble,--such as being killed by a lion, etc.--The beatings tell those
who understand them, which way they are not to go, and which arrow they
had better not use, and also warn them, when many people are coming to
the house on a wagon. They inform people where they can find the person
of whom they are in search, *i.e.*, which way they must go to seek him
successfully." ("A Brief Account of Bushman Folk-lore and other Texts."
By W.H.I. Bleek, Ph.D. Cape Town, 1875. pp. 17 and 18.)

2\. The word *!gwe* was used by the Bushmen to denote both letters and
books. *\|\|kabbo* explained that the beatings in their bodies, here
described, are the Bushman's "letters", and resemble the letters which
take a message or an account of what happens in another place.\]

The Bushmen perceive people coming by means of it. The Bushmen feel a
tapping (when) other people are<span class="small">\[1\]</span> coming.

With regard to an old wound, a Bushman feels a tapping at the wound's
place, while the tapping feels that the man (who has the old wound)
walks, moving his body. The one man feels the other man who comes; he
says to the children: "Look ye around, for grandfather, for grandfather
seems to be coming; this is why I feel the place of his body's old
wound." The children look around; the children perceive the man coming.
They say to their father: "A man is coming yonder." Their father says to
them: "Grandfather (his own father) comes yonder; he would come to me;
he was the one whose coming I felt at the place of his old wound. I
wanted yon to see that he is really coming. For ye contradict my
presentiment, which speaks truly."

He feels a tapping (at) his ribs; he says to the children: "The
springbok seem to be coming, for I feel the black hair (on the sides of
the springbok). Climb ye the Brinkkop standing yonder, that ye may look
around at all the places. For I feel the springbok sensation." The other
man agrees with him: "I think (that) the children (should) do so;

\[1. The Bushman, when an ostrich is coming and is scratching the back
of its neck with its foot, feels the tapping in the lower part of the
back of his own neck; at the same place where the ostrich is scratching.

The springbok, when coming, scratches itself with its horns, and with
its foot; then the Bushman feels the tapping.

2\. When a woman who had gone away is returning to the house, the man
who is sitting there, feels on his shoulders the thong with which the
woman's child is slung over her shoulders; he feels the sensation
there.\]

for the springbok come in the sun; for the Brinkkop standing yonder is
high; they shall look down upon the ground. And then they can see the
whole ground. They can therefore (?) look inside the trees; for the
springbok are wont to go hidden inside the trees. For the trees are
numerous. The little river beds are also there. They are those to which
the springbok are wont to come (in order) to eat in them. For, the
little river beds have become green.<span class="small">\[1\]</span> For
I am wont to feel thus, I feel a sensation in the calves of my legs when
the springbok's blood is going to run down them. For I always feel
blood, when I am about to kill springbok. For I sit feeling a sensation
behind my back, which the blood is wont to run down, when I am carrying
a springbok. The springbok hair lies behind my back." The other agrees
with him (saying): Yes, my brother.

Therefore, we are wont to wait (quietly); when the sensation is like
this, when we are feeling the things come, while the things come near
the house. We have a sensation in our feet, as we feel the rustling of
the feet of the springbok with which the springbok come, making the
bushes rustle. We feel in this manner, we have a sensation in our heads,
when we are about to chop the springbok's horns. We have a sensation in
our face, on account of the blackness of the stripe on the face of the
springbok;<span class="small">\[2\]</span> we feel a sensation in our
eyes, on account of the black marks on the eyes of the springbok. The
ostrich is one, for whom we feel the sensation of

\[1. *i.e.*, the grass and the little bushes of the river bed.

2\. A black stripe that comes down in the centre of the forehead, and
terminates at the end of the nose.\]

a louse;<span class="small">\[1\]</span> as it walks, scratching the
louse; when it is spring,<span class="small">\[2\]</span> when the sun
feels thus, it is warm.

Then it is that the things go from us. They go along, passing opposite
to the hut. Therefore, we early cross the things' spoor, when we early
go to hunt. For, the things which are numerous are us, to come first,
when we are lying in the shade of the hut; because they think that we
are probably lying asleep in the noonday's sleep. For we really lie down
to sleep the noonday's sleep. But we do not lie sleeping at noon, when
we feel this sensation. For we are used to feel like this when the
things are walking; when we have felt the things coming, as they walk,
moving their legs. We feel a sensation in the hollows under our knees,
upon which blood drops, as we go along, carrying (the game). Therefore,
we feel this sensation there.

Therefore, the little boys do not lie in the shade inside the hut; they
lie in the shade above yonder, so that they may beckon to us, when they
have perceived the things, when the things walk at that place. They will
beckon, making us see; for we are wont, sitting at a distance, to watch
them, as they sit above yonder. Therefore, we say to each other, that
the children appear to have seen things. For, they beckon. They point to
that place, while they point to the place towards (?) which the things
are walking, where the Brinkkop, mountains lie thus spread out (?). So
we may quickly chase

\[1. An insect which bites the ostrich, a black insect; an "ostrich
louse" as the Bushmen describe it.

2\. *\|\|kabbo* explains that *\|\|gu* means "de bloem tijd."\]

the things at the hill which lies across, to which the things are
walking. The things walk, putting themselves in front of it;<span
class="small">\[1\]</span> we will quickly pass behind it, while it
still lies away (from the springbok). We will stand nicely (ready) for
the things, that we may not steal up abreast<span
class="small">\[2\]</span> of the things, (but) that we may steal up in
front of the things, at the place<span class="small">\[3\]</span> to
which the leader goes.

\[1. That is, putting their faces towards the mountain.

2\. That is, not at the side of the game as it goes along, but right in
front of its path.

3\. The Bushmen are at the back of the hill, waiting for the springbok
to cross it, coming to the place where they (the Bushmen) are.\]
