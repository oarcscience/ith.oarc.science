## CUTTING OFF THE TOP OF THE LITTLE FINGER, AND PIERCING EARS AND NOSE.

A little boy has this hand out.<span class="small">\[1\]</span> A female
child has this hand cut,<span class="small">\[2\]</span> because she is
a little girl, therefore, she has the hand of her female arm cut;
because this is her female hand. The little boy feels that he is a
little boy, therefore, he has this hand cut, his male arm, for, they
shoot with this hand. Another boy does not have his hand cut; another
girl does not have her hand cut.

Thus, the boy has this arm cut, with which they intend him to shoot;
therefore, he turns this (the right) hand, when be grasps the arrow, he
turns this (the left) hand, when he grasps the bow.

Another man has this (the right) ear pierced; he also has that (the
left) ear pierced. Another woman has this (the left) ear pierced,
because she feels that her female arm is here (i.e., on this side); she
also has this (the right) ear pierced, because she feels that her male
arm is here; she also has her nose pierced.

Another woman does not have her nose pierced, because the other woman is
ugly; the other woman who has had her nose pierced, is handsome.
