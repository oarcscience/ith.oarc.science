# 3. \|XUE AS A \|\|GUI TREE AND AS A FLY.

The sun set, and *\|Xue* was *\|Xue*, and lay upon the ground, and
slept, was alone, and lay upon the ground and slept. And the sun rose,
and *\|Xue* awoke and . . . and stood up, and saw the sun,--a little
sun,--and was *\|\|gui*, and was a tree.

And his wife saw the *\|\|gui*, and went to the *\|\|gui*, and went to
take hold of a *\|gui* fruit, and the *\|\|gui* vanished; and *\|Xue*
was a fly. And his wife laid herself upon the earth, and cried about the
*\|gui*, and died. And *\|Xue* was a fly, and settled upon the
grass.<span class="small">\[1\]</span> And his wife lay down upon the
earth, and cried about the *\|\|gui*<span class="small">\[2\]</span>

\[1. And he settled upon the grass, and the grass broke. The name of the
grass is *goo*.

2\. The *\|\|gui* is a tree. People eat the *\|\|gui*, the*\|\|gui*
fruit. People do not put the *\|\|gui* into a pot, but eat it raw. The
*\|\|gui* has thorns.\]
