# VIII. Personal History.

## \|\|KABBO'S CAPTURE AND JOURNEY TO CAPE TOWN. FIRST ACCOUNT.

I came from that place, I came (here), when I came from my place, when I
was eating a springbok. The Kafir took me; he bound my arms. We (that
is, I) and my son, with my daughter's husband, we were three, when we
were bound opposite to (?) the wagon, while the wagon stood still. We
went away bound to the Magistrate; we went to talk with him; we remained
with him.

We were in the jail. We put our legs into the stocks. The Korannas came
to us, when our legs were in the stocks; we were stretched out(?) in the
stocks. The Korannas came to put their legs into the stocks; they slept,
while their legs were in the stocks. They were in the house of
ordure(?). While we were eating the Magistrate's sheep, the Korannas
came to eat it. We all ate it, we and the Korannas.

We went; we ate sheep on the way, while we were coming to Victoria; our
wives ate their sheep on the way, as they came to Victoria.

We came to roll stones at Victoria, while we worked at the road. We
lifted stones with our chests; we rolled great stones. We again worked
with earth. We carried earth, while the earth was upon the handbarrow.
We carried earth; we loaded the wagon with earth; we pushed it. Other
people walked along. We were pushing the wagon's wheels; we were
pushing; we poured down the earth; we pushed it back. We again loaded
it, we and the Korannas. Other Korannas were carrying the handbarrow.
Other people (i.e. Bushmen) were with the Korannas; they were also
carrying earth; while the earth was upon the handbarrow. They again came
to load the handbarrow with earth.

We again had our arms bound to the wagon chain; we walked along, while
we were fastened to the wagon chain, as we came to Beaufort, while the
sun was hot. They (our arms) were set free in the road. We got tobacco
from the Magistrate; we smoked, going along, with sheeps' bones. We came
into Beaufort jail. The rain fell upon us, while we were in Beaufort
jail.

Early (the next) morning, our arms were made fast, we were bound. We
splashed into the water; we splashed, passing through the water in the
river bed. We walked upon the road, as we followed the wagon, while the
wagon went first. We walked, following the wagon, being bound, until we,
being bound, came to the Breakwater. On the way, we ate sheep as we came
to the Breakwater; we came (and) worked at it.

A white man took us to meet the train in the night. We early sat in the
train; the train ran, bringing us to the Cape. We came into the Cape
prison house when we were tired, we and the Korannas; we lay down to
sleep at noon.
