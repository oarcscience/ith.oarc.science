# TACTICS IN SPRINGBOK HUNTING.

This man <span class="small">\[who stands at 5\]</span>, he has ostrich
feathers upon sticks.<span class="small">\[1\]</span> Therefore, he
sticks (into the little bushes) a large stick with ostrich feathers
(upon it) here <span class="small">\[at 6\]</span>, because he wants it
to look like a man who stands, so that the springbok may see it, when
they go towards the (lesser) feather brushes. For, the springbok would
(otherwise), turning back, pass behind him, when he was driving<span
class="small">\[2\]</span> the springbok for the other people, the
springbok would, turning back, pass behind him, at the place where he

\[1. The *!Xui!Xui* are three in number; of these he sticks two (a
longer and a shorter) into the ground at 6 and 7; the smallest of the
three he holds in his hand, waving it over his head to make the
springbok afraid of him. He had been calling the springbok; but is now
silent; because the springbok have come into the curve of the feather
brushes.

2\. (He) drives the springbok, that they may run in among the other
people. He does not a little run along, for, he passes the foremost
springbok, while he desires that the springbok may not pass by on one
side of the man who came to lie on this side.\]

had stood, calling them. He runs forward from it. Therefore, he sticks
in a feather brush at it <span class="small">\[at 6\]</span>. He goes,
also to stick in a little feather brush, which is short <span
class="small">\[at 7\]</span>; while he intends, with the little feather
brush which is very small to drive the springbok, as he wishes that the
foremost one may run, passing through, may run passing by the man who
lies between <span class="small">\[at 9\]</span>; he is the one to whom
he (the man who drives the springbok) intends the foremost to run.<span
class="small">\[1\]</span> Therefore, the springbok do thus, when this
man shoots the springbok which follows the leading one, they divide
nicely; because, the springbok which was following the other turns
aside, it darts aside, while the springbok which had been following it
turns aside <span class="small">\[in an opposite direction\]</span>,
while they, springing aside, divide at the noise of the arrow on the
other one's skin, that and (the noise of) the feathers, which went so
quickly.

<span class="small">\[1. <span class="small">\[At 8 is\]</span> the man
who lies...; the man who lies to leeward. He lies "with a red
head".\]</span>
