# \|\|KABBO'S JOURNEY IN THE RAILWAY TRAIN.<span class="small">\[1\]</span>

I have said to thee that the train (fire wagon) is nice. I sat nicely in
the train. We two sat in (it), we (I) and a black man.

A woman did seize my arm; she drew me inside, because I should have
fallen, therefore she drew me in. I sat beside a black man; his face was
black; his mouth (was) also black; for they are black.

White men are those whose faces are red, for they are handsome. The
black man he is ugly, thus his mouth is black, for his face is black.

The black man then asked me: "Where dost thou come from?" I said to the
black man: "I come from this place." The black man asked me: "What is
its name?" I said to the blackman: "My place is the Bitterpits."
