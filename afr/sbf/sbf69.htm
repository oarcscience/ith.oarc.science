<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PREPARATION OF THE FEATHER BRUSHES USED IN SPRINGBOK HUNTING.<SMALL>[1]</SMALL></H1>
<P>They roll the feather brushes, binding the ostrich feathers (the body feathers) upon the "Driedoorn" stick. They become numerous; and they (the Bushmen) pound red stones,<SMALL>[2]</SMALL> they paint<SMALL>[3]</SMALL>, the feather brush sticks. And they make ready the (dried) skin of a springbok's chest; they thread little thongs<SMALL>[4]</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>[1. I used to see my grandfather (<I>Tsatsi</I>) roll the feather brushes.</P>
<P>2. The red stones here meant, are <I>||ka</I>; not <I>tto</I>. At the "Philadelphia Exhibition," in November, 1875, <I>Dia!kwain</I> recognized red h&aelig;matite as <I>||ka</I>.</P>
<P>3. Paint them red.</P>
<P>4. Thongs (they) are. The "children of thongs" (they) are. The Korannas call them <I>!Ya</I>.]</SMALL></P>
<P>into (it); and they put away the feather brushes. They put away the feather brushes; they dig <I>||kuain,</I><SMALL>[1]</SMALL> they roast (the stem of) the <I>||kuain</I>, they lay the feather brushes over the <I>||kuain</I>'s smoke, while the <I>||kuain</I>'s smoke ascends into the feather brushes.</P>
<P>First, they dig<SMALL>[2]</SMALL> <SMALL>[with a stick pointed with horn]</SMALL>, making a little hole; they put live coals into it. And they put <I>||kuain</I> upon the live coals, while they wish that the <I>||kuain</I> may smoke quietly, and not flame up; for the <I>||kuain</I> would set the feather brushes on fire, if the fire were to flame up, if they (the stems) flamed up, when roasted.</P>
<P>They (the Bushmen) put the springbok skin<SMALL>[3]</SMALL> over (the fire); they put a stone upon the place where the feather brush sticks are for they intend that the smoke should only go out through the ostrich feathers.</P>
<P><SMALL>[1. Its stem is that which the people call <I>||kuain</I>, because it does not a little smell. Therefore, the people smoke the feather brushes with it. The people call the stem of the <I>!Ywa-kau</I>, which is in the earth, <I>||kuain</I>.</P>
<P>2. Men dig with sticks which have no stones (upon them); they are those with which men dig.</P>
<P>3. They turn the skin, into which the feather brushes have been put, upside down, over the hole into which the live embers and the <I>||kuain</I> were put.]</SMALL></P>
