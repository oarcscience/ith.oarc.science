# THE MASON WASP<span class="small">\[1\]</span> AND HIS WIFE.

The Mason Wasp<span class="small">\[2\]</span> formerly did thus as he
walked along, while (his) wife walked behind him, the wife said: "O my
husband! Shoot for me that hare!" And the Mason Wasp laid down his
quiver; the Mason Wasp said: "Where is the hare? And (his) wife said:
The hare lies there."

And the Mason Wasp took out an arrow; the Mason Wasp in this manner went
stooping along.<span class="small">\[3\]</span> And the wife said: "Put
down (thy) kaross! Why is it that thou art not willing to put down (thy)
kaross?" Therefore, the Mason Wasp, walking along, unloosened the
strings of the kaross; he put down the kaross. Therefore the wife said:
"Canst thou be like this?<span class="small">\[4\]</span> This must have
been why thou wert not willing to lay down the kaross."

Therefore, the Mason Wasp walked, turning to one side; he aimed at (his)
wife, he shot, hitting the (head of) the arrow on (his) wife's
breast<span class="small">\[5\]</span> (bone).

\[1. The Mason Wasp resembles the *Palpares* and *Libellula*. It has a
small body. The Mason Wasp flies, and is to be seen in summer near
water; *\|hang\#kass'o* has seen it in our garden at Mowbray. it is
rather smaller than the *Palpares* and *Libellula*.

2\. He was formerly a man; therefore, he had a bow; therefore, he shot
his wife, when he had not shot the hare.

3\. We are accustomed to go along stooping, when we wish that the hare
may quietly lie hidden (knowing that people are at hand; lying still,
thinking that it will be passed by).

4\. She mocked at the man on account of the middle of the man's body,
which was slender; hence she mocked at the man.

5\. *i.e.* breaking her breastbone.\]

And (his) wife fell down dead on account of it. Then he exclaimed: "*Yi
ii hihi*! O my wife *hi*!" (crying) as if he had not been the one to
shoot (his) wife. He cried, that he should have done thus, have shot his
wife; his wife died.
