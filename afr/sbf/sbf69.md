# PREPARATION OF THE FEATHER BRUSHES USED IN SPRINGBOK HUNTING.<span class="small">\[1\]</span>

They roll the feather brushes, binding the ostrich feathers (the body
feathers) upon the "Driedoorn" stick. They become numerous; and they
(the Bushmen) pound red stones,<span class="small">\[2\]</span> they
paint<span class="small">\[3\]</span>, the feather brush sticks. And
they make ready the (dried) skin of a springbok's chest; they thread
little thongs<span class="small">\[4\]</span>

\[1. I used to see my grandfather (*Tsatsi*) roll the feather brushes.

2\. The red stones here meant, are *\|\|ka*; not *tto*. At the
"Philadelphia Exhibition," in November, 1875, *Dia!kwain* recognized red
hæmatite as *\|\|ka*.

3\. Paint them red.

4\. Thongs (they) are. The "children of thongs" (they) are. The Korannas
call them *!Ya*.\]

into (it); and they put away the feather brushes. They put away the
feather brushes; they dig *\|\|kuain,*<span class="small">\[1\]</span>
they roast (the stem of) the *\|\|kuain*, they lay the feather brushes
over the *\|\|kuain*'s smoke, while the *\|\|kuain*'s smoke ascends into
the feather brushes.

First, they dig<span class="small">\[2\]</span> <span
class="small">\[with a stick pointed with horn\]</span>, making a little
hole; they put live coals into it. And they put *\|\|kuain* upon the
live coals, while they wish that the *\|\|kuain* may smoke quietly, and
not flame up; for the *\|\|kuain* would set the feather brushes on fire,
if the fire were to flame up, if they (the stems) flamed up, when
roasted.

They (the Bushmen) put the springbok skin<span
class="small">\[3\]</span> over (the fire); they put a stone upon the
place where the feather brush sticks are for they intend that the smoke
should only go out through the ostrich feathers.

\[1. Its stem is that which the people call *\|\|kuain*, because it does
not a little smell. Therefore, the people smoke the feather brushes with
it. The people call the stem of the *!Ywa-kau*, which is in the earth,
*\|\|kuain*.

2\. Men dig with sticks which have no stones (upon them); they are those
with which men dig.

3\. They turn the skin, into which the feather brushes have been put,
upside down, over the hole into which the live embers and the
*\|\|kuain* were put.\]
