# PREFACE

The time has not yet come for a complete history of the Negro peoples.
Archaeological research in Africa has just begun, and many sources of
information in Arabian, Portuguese, and other tongues are not fully at
our command; and, too, it must frankly be confessed, racial prejudice
against darker peoples is still too strong in so-called civilized
centers for judicial appraisement of the peoples of Africa. Much
intensive monographic work in history and science is needed to clear
mooted points and quiet the controversialist who mistakes present
personal desire for scientific proof.

Nevertheless, I have not been able to withstand the temptation to essay
such short general statement of the main known facts and their fair
interpretation as shall enable the general reader to know as men a sixth
or more of the human race. Manifestly so short a story must be mainly
conclusions and generalizations with but meager indication of
authorities and underlying arguments. Possibly, if the Public will, a
later and larger book may be more satisfactory on these points.
