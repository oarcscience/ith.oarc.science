Beckwith of Vassar College, *Black Roadways*, Chapel Hill, 1929, p. 176
f., even to-day the Jamaica Maroons use the old Ashanti language which
she calls Kromanti as a secret code of speech. She also declares that
old "Kromanti" songs are still sung among these same Maroons. (l.c., p.
192 f.)

\(23\) Dallas, l.c., Vol. I, p. 34. Cfr. also Martha Warren Beckwith;
"The Maroons know 'stronger obeah' than any other group; they are more
cunning in herb magic; they command a secret tongue (the so-called
Kromanti), and they know old songs in this speech 'strong enough to
bewitch anybody'; they employ old arts which deal with spirits." (l.c.,
p. 191.)

Beckwith accentuates the fact that the Maroons to-day refer their
traditions back to the Kromanti, (l.c., p. 184) and further asserts that
the Maroons form "in some respects a secret society . . . which
preserves certain so-called Kromanti customs as a proof of their African
pride of blood." (l.c., p. 184 f.)

making obi, he would have been surer of his

privacy and would have squatted on the ground surrounded by his
paraphernalia and this would have been the scene with little variation.
Most of the ingredients to be used are concealed in a bag from which he
draws them as he needs them. The special offering of his patron which
must include a white fowl, two bottles of rum and a silver offering are
on the ground beside him. Before him is the inevitable empty bottle to
receive the ingredients. The incantation opens with a prolonged mumbling
which is supposed to be "an unknown tongue." This is accompanied by a
swaying of the body. Gradually ingredients are placed in the bottle, and
a little rum is poured over them. The throat of the fowl is deftly slit
and drops of blood are allowed to fall first on the silver offering, and
then on the contents of the bottle to which is finally added a few
feathers plucked from various parts of the fowl with a last libation of
rum. During all this process the obeah-man has been drawing inspiration
from frequent draughts of rum, reserving a substantial portion to be
consumed later when he makes a meal off the flesh of the fowl.

the subject of the slave trade*, London, 1789, Stephen Fuller gave a
summary of the Negroes from Africa who were sold in Jamaica between 1764
and 1788. During this period some 50,000 slaves were imported by the
five principal agents and of these nearly 15% came from the Gold Coast.

\(6\) *The Medical Times*, September 20, 1851, p. 306.

\(7\) *Notes and Queries*, July 15, 1899, p. 47. Note:--This letter of
James Platt drew forth the following reply from James Hooper of Harwich
in *Notes and Queries* for July 29, 1899: "If the Reverend H. Goldie's
etymology as quoted by Mr. Platt, is correct, Dr. Brewer's account of
obiism, as he spells the word, is all wrong. 'Obiism, Serpent-worship.
From the Egyptian Ob (the sacred serpent). The African sorceress is
still called obi. The Greek ophis is of the same family. Moses forbade
the Israelites to inquire of Ob, which we translate wizard.' Now this
looks very interesting, and carries us far; but is there an Egyptian
word Ob signifying the sacred serpent? And is the Hebrew word Ob
identical with the Egyptian Ob; and are both susceptible of the same
interpretation? Is an African witch called Obi?"

Jacob Bryant, (1715-1804) of whom his biographer wrote: "In point of
classical erudition he was perhaps without an equal in the world,"
published in 1774-76, *A New System or an Analysis of Antient
Mythology*, "wherein an attempt is made to divest Tradition of Fable,
and to reduce Truth to its original Purity." An entire chapter is
devoted to "Ob, Oub, Pytho, sive de Ophiolatria."--Cfr. (Third Edition)
London, 1807, Vol. II, p. 197 ff.--According to Bryant, a serpent in the
Egyptian language was called Ob or Aub--Obion is still the Egyptian name
of a serpent--Moses, in the name of God, forbids the Israelites even to
inquire of the daemon, Ob which is translated charmer or wizard,
divinator aut sortilegus, etc. All this was adopted by the *Report of
the Lords of the Committee of the Council appointed for the
consideration of all Matters relating to Trade and Foregn Plantations*,
London, 1789, as a basis of the etymology of the word obeah, and as this
Report has since served as a starting point for all writers on the
subject, the views of Bryant have prevailed until comparatively
recently. {p. 270} Thus we find *The Daily Advertiser* of Kingston,
Jamaica, in the issues of October 13-16, 1790, reprinting that part of
the *Report* which refers to obeah.

In The Gentleman's Magazine, December, 1816, p. 502f., there is a letter
addressed to the Editor, Sylvanus Urban, dated Penzance, June 1, and
signed C. V. L. G., wherein, without reference to the above *Report*,
the writer calls attention to Bryant's derivation of the word Ob, and
adds: "The curious coincidence which I mean to remark is, that the
witchcraft practised by the Blacks in the West Indies at this day is
called Ob or Obi; the ignorant Negroes are under the most superstitious
dread of those who profess the art."

\(37\) C. O. 139/21. Note:--Conditions in Jamaica at the time may be
judged from contemporaneous Publications in England. Thus in *The London
Chronicle*, Vol. VIII (1760), No. 569, a letter dated Kingston, Jamaica,
June 14, 1760, mentions: "On Thursday afternoon two Negroes, named Quaco
and Anthony, concerned in the late insurrection in St. Mary's, were
executed at Spring Path, according to sentence. The former was burnt at
a stake, and the latter hanged, his head cut off, and fixed on a pole on
the Greenwich road etc." *The Annual Register*, under date of August 1,
1760, gives (p. 124 f.) extracts of a letter from Jamaica dated May 8,
1760: "They cut off the overseer's head put his blood in a calabash,
mixed gun-powder with it, and eat their plantains dipped in it, as they
did by every white man they killed. I was last Saturday at Spanish Town
before which time one, who had not been in the rebellion actually was
burnt alive, for having sworn to cut his master and mistress's heads
off, and to make punch bowls of them." A second letter, dated May 21,
1760, states, (l.c., p. 124): "The sentence against the rebel Negroes
was put into execution. One of them lived nine days, wanting six hours,
without a drop of water, hanging in an excessive hot place, though they
complained of the cold in the night."

Note:--Professor Beckwith remarks: "It is true that as the Negroes
become better educated and more intelligent, the spiritist beliefs (upon
which obeah practices depend) lose their hold upon the mind; hence a
larger and larger number of obeah practitioners become such for
mercenary

{p. 272}

reasons or for the opportunity the trade gives them to satisfy sensual
desires. But the fact that the trade remains lucrative proves the
persistence of the belief, and there is no reason-to suppose that the
practitioner is in every case more intelligent than the great mass of
the people who employ his skill." (1.c., p. 107 f.)

the obeah-man may achieve his ends, there is no doubt whatever as to the
faith of the Negroes im his spiritual power. . . . One of the strongest
arguments against the honesty of the obeah-man is the fact that he
actually does excite a man to crime as a condition laid down by the
spirit to make his obeah work." (l.c., p. 140.)

\(17\) Banbury, l.c., p. 23f. Note:--Charles Rampini in his *Letters
from Jamaica*, Edinburgh, 1873, p. 83, states: "A very mischievous ghost
is that known by the name of 'rolling calf,' a spirit who haunts the
city by night with a flaming eye, trailing a long chain behind him. To
speak to, or to touch the chain of a rolling calf will cause him to turn
and rend you. The only way to escape is to stick an open penknife in the
ground and run without looking behind you.

\(18\) Banbury, l.c., p. 25. Note:--According to Professor Beckwith,
(l.c., p. 100f.): "Whatever the origin of the rolling calf it is looked
upon to-day as the animal form assumed by especially dangerous duppies.
Obeah-men often become tolling calves and they 'set' rolling calves upon
people. Murderers and butchers and I know not how many other reprobates

{p. 275}

become rolling calves when they die, and go to live not only at the
roots of cotton-wood trees and in clumps of bamboos but also in caves
and deserted houses, whence they emerge at night to follow sugar wains
because of their fondness for molasses, or to break into cattle pens."

\(19\) Banbury, l.c., p. 26. Note:--A writer in *Chambers's Journal*,
January 11, 1902, asserts: "The rolling calf . . . This is a quadruped
with blazing eyes and having a clanking chain round its neck. Like the
*loup-garo*u, it prowls at night, and the man whom it touches dies. The
only way to escape--so the Negroes say--is to stick a penknife in the
ground and turn your back on the monster. Like Mephistopheles held back
by the sign of the Cross, it cannot then advance, however malevolent it
may be."

shadow for him. So long as it is tightly corked, he has power over that
poor enemy and can make him do anything he likes."

"With West Indian Duppies," by L. C. Quinlan, wherein it is asserted:
"That every man is accompanied by two duppies, a good and a bad one, is
a general belief. When a man sleeps, the good duppy remains on watch
beside him, while the other goes walking, nor can the sleeper wake until
the evil spirit has returned. When you go on a journey, be sure the bad
duppy precedes you, as if it doesn't it is likely to harm you. just how
you can insist on the bad duppy keeping ahead of you I am at a loss to
say." While the writer implies that there is a general belief in this
"dream-soul" or bad duppy as he calls it, from my own experience, as
related in the text, I could find only vestiges of the belief.

that "Ole Hige is still a menace to infants in Jamaica, and it is from
fear of her visit that they are guarded by a blue cross on the ninth
night after birth and that a cross is put on the door of dwellings, or
grain is strewn before the door. But I do not think her name carries
otherwise much fear with it. She is the skin-changing witch of European
folk tale, and the story is commonly told of the child who watches the
witch slip out of her skin and, while she is away, burns or peppers it
so that she cannot resume it again at her return. The lively recital of
the hag's consternation, her cry of 'Kin, you no know me?' never fails
to win a roar of merriment from the delighted audience. Equally
uproarious mirth accompanies the recital of her way of counting when
grain or rice is scattered at the door or an X marked on the sill--'One,
two, t'ree, an' deh a da!' she reiterates, because, since she can never
count beyond the number 'three' and has then to go back and repeat the
reckoning, the tale is never told. Why the poor old thing has to count
at all is part of the mystery."

contaminated by Mohammedan contacts had a degree of morality that shamed
the Whites who first had dealings with them. Cfr. J. H. Driberg, *The

death penalty prescribed for those sensual acts which are usually
classified as being "against nature."

women partake; they join in the choruses, and at the funeral of a female
sing the dirge itself; but the frenzy of the moment renders it such a
mixture of yells and screeches, that it bids defiance to all notation."

\(23\) Charles Leslie, 1.c., p. 308 ff. Note:--Sir Hans Sloane, *Natural
History of Jamaica*, London, 1707, Vol. 1, Introduction, p. xlviii,
writing from personal observation had previously reported: "The Negroes
from some countries think that they return to their own country when
they die in Jamaica, and therefore regard death but little, imagining
they shall change their condition by that means from servile to free,
and so for this reason often cut their own throats. Whether they die
thus or naturally, their country people make great lamentations,
mournings, and howlings

{p. 278}

about their expiring, and at their funeral throw in rum and victuals
into their graves, to serve them in the other world. Sometimes they bury
it in gourds, at other times spill it in the graves."

\(24\) Edward Long, 1.c., Vol. II, p. 421 f. Note:--In describing the
Koromantyn funerals as he had witnessed them in Jamaica, Bryan Edwards
l.c., Vol. II, p. 850, reported: "At the burial of such among them as
were respected in life, or venerable through age, they exhibit a sort of
*Pyrrhic* or warlike dance, in which their bodies are strongly agitated
by running, leaping, and jumping, with many violent and frantic gestures
and contortions. Their funeral songs too are all of the heroic or
martial cast"--he has just mentioned that the songs of the Eboes are
soft and languishing, those of the Koromantyns heroic and
martial--affording some colour to the prevalent notion that the Negroes
consider death not only as a welcome and happy release from the
calamities of their condition, but also as a passport to the place of
their nativity; a deliverance which, while it frees them from bondage,
restores them to the society of their dearest, long-lost and lamented
relatives in Africa. But I am afraid that this, like other European
notions concerning the Negroes, is the dream of poetry; the sympathetic
effusion of a fanciful or too credulous an imagination." Then after
showing the Negro's fear of death, he declares: "We may conclude,
therefore, that their funeral songs and ceremonies are commonly nothing
more than the dissonance of savage barbarity and riot; as remote from
the fond superstition to which they are ascribed, as from the sober
dictates of a rational sorrow." The Reverend James M. Phillippo, a
Baptist missionary in Jamaica of twenty years' experience, in his
*Jamaica, its Past and Present State*, (London, 1843, p. 244 ff.),
relates concerning the slaves: "Their practices at funerals were
unnatural and revolting in a high degree. No sooner did the spirit
depart from the body of a relative or friend, than the most wild and
frantic gesticulations were manifested, accompanied by the beating of
drums and the singing of songs. When on the way with the corpse to
interment, the bearers, who were often intoxicated, practised the most
strange and ridiculous manoeuvres. They would sometimes make a sudden
halt, put their ears in a listening attitude

{p. 279}

against the coffin, pretending that the corpse was endued with the gift
of speech--that he was angry and required to be appeased, gave
instructions for a different distribution of his property, objected to
his mode of conveyance, or refused to proceed farther towards the place
of burial until some debts due to him were discharged, some slanderous
imputation on his character removed, some theft confessed, or until they
(the bearers) were presented with renewed potations of rum: and the more
effectually to delude the multitude, and thereby enforce their claims,
to some of which they were often instigated by the chief mourners, they
would pretend to answer the questions of the deceased, echo his
requirements, run back with the coffin upon the procession, or jerk it
from side to side of the road; not unfrequently, and under the most
trivial pretence, they would leave the corpse at the door or in the
house of a debtor or neighbour indiscriminately, and resist every
importunity for its removal, until his pretended demands were satisfied.
On estates these ceremonies were generally performed in a manner which
was, if possible, still more revolting. They took place at night by the
light of torches, amidst drumming, dancing, singing, drunkenness, and
debauchery. The coffin was usually supported on the heads of two
bearers, preceded by a man carrying a white flag, and followed by the
intoxicated multitude. They went to each. house of the Negro village
ostensibly to 'take leave,' but really for exaction and fraud . . . The
corpse being deposited in the grave and partially covered with earth,
the attendants completed the burial (for a time) by casting the earth
behind them, to prevent the deceased from following them home. The last
sad offices were usually closed by sacrifices of fowls and other
domestic animals, which were torn to pieces and scattered over the
grave, together with copious libations of blood and other ingredients,
accompanied at the same time with the most violent and extravagant
external signs of sorrow; they stamped their feet, tore their hair, beat
their breasts, vociferated, and manifested the most wild and frantic
gestures. No sooner, however, did the party return to the house of their
relatives and friends than every sign of sadness vanished; 'the drums
resounded with a livelier beat, the song grew more animated, dancing and
festivity commenced, and the

{p. 280}

night was spent in riot and debauchery.' Were the deceased a female, the
reputed husband for about a month afterwards was negligent in his person
and dress. At the close of this period he proceeded with some of his
friends to the grave with several articles of food, and sung a song
congratulating the deceased on her enjoyment of complete happiness. This
was supposed to terminate their mutual obligations. Each of the party
then expressed his wishes of remembrance to his kindred, repeated
benedictions on his family, promised soon to return to them, repeated
promises to take care of her children, and bade the deceased an
affectionate farewell. An additional quantity of earth was now thrown
over the grave, and the party partook of the repast they had provided,
concluding the ceremony with dancing, singing, and vociferation,
regarding death as a welcome relief from the calamities of life, and a
passport to the never-to-be-forgotten scenes of their nativity."

\(25\) Gardner, l.c. p. 186 f. Note:--Matthew Gregory Lewis, more
familiarly known as "Monk" Lewis, recorded in his *Journal of a West
India Proprietor*, (London, 1834, p. 97 f.), under date of January 13,
1816: "The Negroes are always buried in their own gardens, and many
strange and fantastical ceremonies are observed on the occasion. If the
corpse be that of a grown person, they consult it as to which way it
pleases to be carried; and they make attempts upon various roads without
success, before they hit upon the right one. Till that is accomplished,
they stagger under the weight of the coffin, struggle against its force,
which draws them in a different direction from that in which they had
settled to go; and sometimes in the contest the corpse and the coffin
jump off the shoulders of the bearers. But if, as is frequently the
case, any person is suspected of having hastened the catastrophe, the
corpse will then refuse to go any road but the one which passes by the
habitation of the suspected person, and as soon as it approaches his
house, no human power is equal to persuading it to pass. As the Negroes
are extremely superstitious and very much afraid of ghosts (whom they
call the *duppy*), I rather wonder at their choosing to have their dead
buried in their gardens; but I understand their argument to be, that
they need only fear the duppies of their enemies, but have nothing to
apprehend

{p. 281}

from those after death, who loved them in their lifetime; but the
duppies of their adversaries are very alarming beings, equally powerful
by day as by night, and who not only are spiritually terrific, but who
can give very hard substantial knocks on the pate, whenever they see fit
occasion, and can find a good opportunity."

\(26\) Gardner, l.c., p. 386 ff. Note:--J. Stewart who reported
conditions as he found them in Jamaica in 1823, mentions a rather
amusing incident, (*A View of the Past and Present State of the Island
of Jamaica*, p. 276): "A Negro who was to be interred in one of the
towns, had, it was pretended by some of his friends, a claim on another
Negro for a sum of money. The latter denied any such claim; and
accordingly, at the funeral of the deceased the accustomed ceremonies
took place opposite to the door of his supposed debtor; and this mummery
was continued for hours, till the magistrates thought proper to
interfere, and compelled the defunct to forego his claim, and proceed
quietly on to his place of rest." Cynric R. Williams who visited Jamaica
in this same year, 1823, in his *Tour through the Island of Jamaica*,
London, 1826, p. 104 ff., relates: "I did not attend the funeral of the
Negro above mentioned, as I thought my presence might be unwelcome, but
my two lacqueys were of the party; and Ebenezer, as I suspected, did not
lose so excellent an opportunity of endeavouring to edify his brethren,
and displaying his progress in religious knowledge. He objected to the
heathen ceremony of throwing a fowl into the grave, and said that the
yams which they would have buried with the corpse had no more business
there than a hog in the Gibna's (Governor's) garden. The son, in the
law, of the deceased, described the scene to me, or rather the speech
made by Ebenezer, on the occasion, which I shall endeavour to relate in
his own words. The corpse was buried by moonlight with the help of
torches, and after the Negro fashion; but Ebenezer, seeing that the
business was to end there, had called out to know if they would not
'read ober him, and if they were not going to sabe his soul?' The
Negroes, very accommodating, told him he might read if he would; on
which he took a book from his pocket, and held it the wrong way upward
(which did not much signify, as he does not know his letters) and began

{p. 282}

as follows: 'Dea belubb'd, we gather tigether dis face congregation,
because it horrible among all men not to take delight in hand for
wantonness, lust, and appetite, like brute mule, dat hab no
understanding. When de man cut down like guinea grass, he worship no
more any body, but gib all him world's good to de debbil; and Garamighty
tell him soul must come up into heab'n, where notting but glorio. What
de use of fighting wid beast at Feesus? Rise up all and eat and drink,
because we die yesterday, no so tomorrow. Who shew you mystery? Who

spirit adds itself to that innumerable company of spirits which fill the
world about us. The spirit needs the food and care just as it did in its
human incarnation, save that it now only consumes the essence of the
food, leaving the visible or material food which is eaten by the
natives."

224. Note:--In *Chambers's Journal*, January 11, 1902, p. 81 ff. there
appeared an article entitled "'Obeah' To-day in the West Indies,"
wherein the writer makes this statement: "Just as I was writing, the
following curious 'duppy' story came under my notice. It is believed by
hundreds of black people in the district of Lamb's River, Jamaica: A boy
who was wanted to give evidence in a criminal case was missed a few
months ago. It was supposed that he had run away; but it is now darkly
rumoured that he was murdered by a young woman, who has ever since been
tormented by his 'duppy.' The ghost stones her every night. People say
they see the stones hurtling through the air, and the bruises on her
body; but they never see anybody throw them. Hundreds of people--so the
story goes--follow the luckless young woman about every night to see
where the stones come from, but it remains a mystery. The young woman
has had her head broken by them, and it is feared that she will lose her
reason."

\(7\) Bell, 1.c., p. 93 ff. Note:--Andrew Lang in *The Making of
Religion*, (London, 1898, p. 366), includes an Appendix, entitled, "The
Poltergeist and his Explainers," where, after discussing a number of
cases, he concludes: "It seems wiser to admit our ignorance and suspend
our belief. Here closes the futile chapter of explanations. Fraud

{p. 284}

is a *vera causa*, but an hypothesis difficult of application when it is
admitted that the effects could not be caused by ordinary mechanical
means. Hallucination, through excitement, is a *vera causa*, but its
remarkable uniformity, as described by witnesses from different lands
and ages, knowing nothing of each other, makes us hesitate to accept a
sweeping hypothesis of hallucination. The case for it is not confirmed,
when we have the same reports from witnesses certainly not excited. This
extraordinary bundle, then, of reports, practically identical, of facts
paralyzing to belief, this bundle made up of statements from so many
ages and countries, can only be 'filed for reference.'" It is
interesting, then, to record that I received a letter from the Most
Reverend Arthur Hinsley, Apostolic Delegate, in East Africa, dated
Mombasa, February 11, 1933, wherein he states: "The stone-throwing
propensity of the Jamaica Duppies is extraordinary! I heard from
missionaries in Uganda or in Kavirondo (Kenya) of two or three cases of
such mysterious stone-throwing." Perhaps one of the most remarkable
cases that have been recorded on excellent authority is that reported in
*Rome* of January 23, 1909, by Monsignor Delalle, Vicar Apostolic in
Natal, which concerns the exorcism of a possessed girl named Germana at
St. Michael's Mission, Natal in May, 1907. We have here extraordinary
strength, as well as knowledge of what is going on at a distance. The
girl was sixteen years of age, utterly ignorant of Latin, and yet the
Bishop addressed her only in that tongue, while she answered usually in
Zulu, but sometimes in Latin.
