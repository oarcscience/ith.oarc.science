# PSYCHIC PHENOMENA OF JAMAICA

### By JOSEPH J. WILLIAMS, S.J.

NEW YORK \[1934\]

*Note:* This book is in the public domain because its copyright was not
renewed in a timely fashion (U.S. Copyright Database).

The authorship of this book (by a Jesuit ethnologist) makes some of the
editorial content suspect. However, the author spent time in the field
in Jamaica. His library research was extensive and used rare and unique
sources such as contemporary newspapers, legal archives and early
accounts. Williams keeps his skepticism active while remaining
open-minded. On the downside there are some passages which could be
interpreted as racist (in hindsight), so the usual disclaimers apply.

All that said, this book remains a good introduction to the outlines of
this subject. If you've ever listened to a Reggae song about 'Duppies'
and wondered what they were talking about, now you'll know. -jbh
