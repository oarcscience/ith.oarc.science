This short book is a translation of some of the myths of the Yoruba
people of Nigeria. It is a history of the creation of the world, the
gods, and humanity, and the early days of the sacred city of Ífè, the
traditional center of Yoruba culture. The text was recited to the
author/translator by the high priests of Ífè, and the book is still
cited in some books on traditional Yoruba religion and thought today. It
has undeservedly become quite rare, as it can be considered a minor
classic in the field.
