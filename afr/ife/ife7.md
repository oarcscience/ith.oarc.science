Of the Great Gods' departure. . . The years slid by<br />
Unnoted while King Ógun<span id="page_40_fr_2"></span><a href="#page_40_note_2">2</a> reigned. The World<br />
Was young: upon the craggy slopes the trees<br />
Shot forth red buds, and ancient Ífè, gaunt<br />
With suffering, dreamed again her early dreams.<br />
Taught by the Gods, the folk began to learn<br />
The arts of Heaven's peace anew; the drum<br />
Returned to measures of the dance, and Great<br />
Orísha saw the joy of life once more<br />
In his creatures' eyes. Thus lived mankind among</td>

Olúbo of Úbo with his chieftaincy.</td>

And when the time of festival was near,<br />
Word came to Ífè that the folk of Úbo<br />
Would bring no gifts, nor worship at the feet<br />
Of Ógun. But the King scorned them, laughing: "Who lights<br />

But rivers answered not, not brooks, nor Gods<br />
Of crossway altars at the light of dawn;<br />
And through the unceasing hissing of the foam<br />
No voice of counsel came. . . With Autumn's fall<br />
Olúbo came with gifts before the shrine<br />
Of the grim Forest-God who hedged his land,<br />
And prayed him to accept the corn he brought<br />
And the fat beasts, nor seize his lands again.<br />
