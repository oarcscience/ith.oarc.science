How God in the Beginning sent three sons<br />
Into the World—Earth, Water and the Forest—<br />
With one and twenty gifts for Earth and men<br />
That are the sons of Earth; and all save one<br />
The Forest and the Rivers stole; and how<br />
God promised to his first-born, Earth, that men<br />
Should win the twenty gifts again by virtue<br />
Of that last one, Good Humour. And this is true:<br />
For in those years when Ógun and the Gods<br />
Made known their handicrafts men learned to seek<br />
Thatch, food and wine in Forest and in River</td>

Came strife and turmoil to the Gods—for still<br />
For jealousy and pride Odúwa held<br />
The bag Arámfè gave to Great Orísha.<br />
Often Orísha made entreaty; oft<br />
A suppliant came before his brother—in vain;<br />
Till once when Odudúwa sat with Ógun<br />
<span id="page_28">p. 28</span> In that same palace where the Órní reigns,<br />
The sound of drums was heard and Great Orísha<br />
Approached with skilled Obálufon, and said:<br />
"The time has come to teach Arámfè's arts<br />
"To men. Give back the bag (for it is mine!)<br />
That I may do our Father's bidding. Else,<br />
Have a care, is it not told how caution slept<br />
In the still woods when the proud leopard fell,<br />
Lured on by silence, 'neath the monster's foot?"<span id="page_28_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_28_note_1">1</a><br />
Then was Odúwa angered exceedingly:<br />
"Am I not king? Did not Arámfè make<br />
Me lord of Gods and men? Begone! Who speaks<br />
Unseemly words before the king has packed<br />
His load."<span id="page_28_fr_2"></span><a href="#page_28_note_2">2</a></td>

In Ífè and the Forest. Such was the fall<br />
Of the Gods from paths divine, and such for men<br />
The woe that Odudúwa's theft prepared;<br />
But little the Gods recked of their deep guilt<br />
<span id="page_29">p. 29</span> Till darkness fell and all was quiet—for then<br />
Returned the memory of Calm, their heritage,<br />
Of Heaven born and destined for the World;<br />
Gloom, too, with the still night came down: a sense<br />
Of impious wrong, ungodly sin, weighed down<br />
Warriors aweary, and all was changed. Around,<br />
Dead, dead the Forest seemed, its boughs unstirred;<br />
Dead too, amidst its strangling, knotted growth<br />

Of Old Arámfè as he mused: "In vain<br />
Into the Waste beneath I sent my sons—<br />
The children of my happy vales—to make<br />
A World of mirth: for desolation holds<br />
The homes of Ífè, and women with their babes<br />
Are outcast in the naked woods." But when<br />
The whirling clouds were wheeling in the sky<br />
And the great trees were smitten by the wind,<br />
Thundrous Arámfè in his ire rebuked<br />
His erring sons: "At my command you came<br />
To darkness, where the Evil of the Void—<br />
Insentient Violence—had made its home,<br />
To shape in the Abyss a World of joy<br />
<span id="page_30">p. 30</span> And lead Creation in the ways of Heaven.<br />
How, then, this brawling? Did the Void's black soul<br />
Outmatch you, or possess your hearts to come<br />
Again into its own? For Man's misfortune<br />
I grieve; but you have borne them on the tide<br />
Of your wrong-doing, and your punishment<br />
Is theirs to share. For now my thunderbolts<br />
I hurl, with deluges upon the land—<br />
To fill the marshes and lagoons, and stay<br />
For aye your impious war."</td>

<td>Was gone, and Old Arámfè in his grief<br />
Departed on black clouds. But still the wrath,<br />
But still the anger of his sons endured,<br />
And in the dripping forests and the marshes<br />
The rebel Gods fought on—while in the clouds<br />
Afar Arámfè reasoned with himself:<br />
"I spoke in thunders, and my deluge filled<br />
The marshes that Ojúmu dried;—but still<br />
They fight. Punish, I may—but what can I<br />
Achieve? In Heaven omnipotent: but here—?<br />
What means it? I cannot tell. . . In the Unknown,<br />
Beyond the sky where I have set the Sun,<br />
<span id="page_31">p. 31</span> Is He-Who-Speaks-Not: He knows all. Can this<br />
Be Truth: Amidst the unnatural strife of brothers<br />
The World was weaned: by strife must it endure—?"<br />
Oíbo, how the first of wars began,<br />
And Old Arámfè sought to stay the flow<br />
Of blood—your pen has written; but of the days,<br />
The weary days of all that war, what tongue<br />
Can tell? 'Tis said the anger of the Gods<br />
Endured two hundred years: we know the priest<br />
Osányi made strange amulets for all<br />
The mortal soldiers of the Gods—one charm<br />
Could turn a spear aside, a second robbed<br />
The wounding sword of all its sting, another<br />
Made one so terrible that a full score<br />
Must flee—but not one word of the great deeds,<br />
Of hopes and fears, of imminent defeat<br />
Or victory snatched away is handed down:<br />
No legend has defied, no voice called through<br />
The dimness and the baffling years.</td>

On Ífè of the many battles; while<br />
With sorrowful reproach the wise trees stood<br />
And gazed upon the Gods who made the soil<br />
The voices of the Forest crooned their dreams<br />
Of peace: "Sleep, sleep" all weary Nature craved,<br />
And "Sleep" the slumbrous reed-folk urged, and 'twixt<br />
The shadow and the silver'd leaf, for sleep</td>

Ógun, the warrior, with his comrades stood<br />
Before the king, and thus he spoke: "Odúwa,<br />
We weary of the battle, and its agony<br />
Weighs heavy on our people. Have you forgot<br />
The careless hours of Old Arámfè's realm?<br />
What means this war, this empty war between<br />
One mother's sons? Orísha willed it so,<br />
You say. . . 'Twas said of old 'Who has no house<br />
Will buy no broom',<span id="page_32_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_32_note_1">1</a> Why then did Great Orísha<br />
Bring plagues on those he made in love? In Heaven<br />
Afar Arámfè gave to you the empire,<br />
<span id="page_33">p. 33</span> And to Orísha knowledge of the ways<br />
Of mysteries and hidden things. The bag<br />
You seized; but not its clue—the skill, the wisdom<br />
Of Great Orísha which alone could wake<br />
The sleeping lore. . . The nations of the World<br />
Are yours: give back the bag, and Great Orísha<br />
Will trouble us no more." But neither Ógun<br />
Nor the soft voices of the night could loose<br />
Odúwa from the thrall of envy: the rule<br />
Of men and empire were of no account<br />
When the hot thought of Old Arámfè's lore<br />
Roused his black ire anew. The bag he held;<br />
But all the faithless years had not revealed<br />
Its promised treasures. Bitterly he answered:</td>

Wearies of war, and joins my enemies.<br />
Weak son, the sceptre you were born to hold<br />
And hand down strengthened to a line of kings<br />
Could not uphold your will and be your spur<br />
Until the end. Is it not said, "Shall one<br />
Priest bury, and anon his mate dig up<br />

But all my heart has longed for through a life<br />
Of labour. So let it be: God of Soft Iron!<br />

With the sweet honours of a king in name—<br />
