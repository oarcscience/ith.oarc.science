<TD>O&iacute;bo, graven on my memory<BR>
Is the sad legend which my father told me<BR>
Of the Great Gods' departure. . . The years slid by<BR>
Unnoted while King &Oacute;gun<A NAME="page_40_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_40_note_2"><FONT size=1>2</FONT></A> reigned. The World<BR>
Was young: upon the craggy slopes the trees<BR>
Shot forth red buds, and ancient &Iacute;f&egrave;, gaunt<BR>
With suffering, dreamed again her early dreams.<BR>
Taught by the Gods, the folk began to learn<BR>
The arts of Heaven's peace anew; the drum<BR>
Returned to measures of the dance, and Great<BR>
Or&iacute;sha saw the joy of life once more<BR>
In his creatures' eyes. Thus lived mankind among</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>The<BR>foundation<BR>of &Uacute;bo</I></TD>
<TD>The Gods, and multiplied until the youth<BR>
Of &Iacute;f&egrave; sought new homes and wider lands<BR>
In the vast Forest; and thus was born the first<BR>
Fair daughter of Od&uacute;wa's city. Men called<BR>
Her &Uacute;bo, and the leader took the name<BR>
Ol&uacute;bo of &Uacute;bo with his chieftaincy.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>is attended<BR>by strife<BR>from the<BR>first.</I></TD>
<TD>But to these colonists the Gods, their Fathers,<BR>
Gave no good gifts: 'midst battles with the Wild,<BR>
'Mid struggles with the Forest the town grew-<BR>
While dull remembrance of unnatural wrongs<BR>

Bred Man's first rebel thought against the Gods;<BR>
And when the time of festival was near,<BR>
Word came to &Iacute;f&egrave; that the folk of &Uacute;bo<BR>
Would bring no gifts, nor worship at the feet<BR>
Of &Oacute;gun. But the King scorned them, laughing: "Who lights<BR>
His lamp between the leopard's paws?"<A NAME="page_41_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_41_note_3"><FONT size=1>3</FONT></A></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><I>The Chief</I></TD>
<TD align=right>Years passed</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>of &Uacute;bo<BR>seeks advice,</I></TD>
<TD>In grieving while Ol&uacute;bo sought the homes<BR>
Of spirits of the Forest springs, laid gifts<BR>
At crossway shrines where childless women go,<BR>
Or wandered to drear coasts to share his wrongs<BR>
With Ocean chafing at his old restraint.<BR>
But rivers answered not, not brooks, nor Gods<BR>
Of crossway altars at the light of dawn;<BR>
And through the unceasing hissing of the foam<BR>
No voice of counsel came. . . With Autumn's fall<BR>
Ol&uacute;bo came with gifts before the shrine<BR>
Of the grim Forest-God who hedged his land,<BR>
And prayed him to accept the corn he brought<BR>
And the fat beasts, nor seize his lands again.<BR>
And the God saw the oil, and smelled the blood<BR>
Of birds and cattle; and the longed-for voice</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>which the<BR>Forest-God<BR>gives him</I></TD>

Came to Ol&uacute;bo: "See with the rain I come<BR>
Each year upon your fields with springing trees,<BR>
Rank-growing grass and vegetation wild:<BR>
Your work of yester-year is all undone<BR>
By my swift desolation. Be this your symbol:<BR>
Go thus against the Scornful Ones arrayed<BR>
As I."</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD align=right>In &Iacute;f&egrave; was great joy: the last</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD>Black thundercloud has passed; the maids were wed,<BR>
And all men feasted on the sacred days</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Ol&uacute;bo in-<BR>vades If&egrave;,<BR>and takes<BR>the men<BR>away as<BR>slaves.</I></TD>
<TD>Of &Oacute;gun and the Lord of Day&#8212;when sudden,<BR>
From the still Forest o'er the walls there broke<BR>
Portents of moving trees and hurrying grass<BR>
On &Iacute;f&egrave;'s stone-still revellers. (Hope perishes<BR>
In the dark hour a mother sees the dance<BR>
Of white-robed goblins<A NAME="page_42_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_42_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> of the midnight streets&#8212;<BR>
A glimpse, no more; and her sick child is lost).<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Despair held rule: the new-wed wives were lone;<BR>
Their men were slaves of &Uacute;bo lords. The drum<BR>
Was silent, and laughter mute. About dull tasks<BR>
A listless people wandered; but not so</TD></TR>

M&oacute;rimi&#8212;for she, assured of triumph, strode<BR>
To the dim court of &Iacute;fa, and laid bare<BR>
Her gift. A vision flickered and was gone,<BR>
And the priest prophesied: "The bode is good.<BR>
As when a sick man lies beset by fiends<A NAME="page_43_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_43_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A><BR>
I call not to the Gods for aid, but take<BR>
The pepper on my tongue and thus invoke<BR>
Those very fiends in their dread mother's name,<BR>
And then command the Prince of leaguing Woes<BR>
(Though hastening to the River's lip) to turn<BR>
Again&#8212;such now is &Iacute;fa's counsel, borne<BR>
Swift in the form of Messengers to me</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>who advises<BR>her to go<BR>to &Uacute;bo.</I></TD>
<TD>His priest, his voice: 'Evil has come down on &Iacute;f&egrave;:<BR>
By Evil only can desire prevail.<BR>
Take six he-goats to &Eacute;shu, the Undoer;<BR>
Thus crave his aid and go, Great M&oacute;rimi,<BR>
A harlot to the land of &Uacute;bo'" . . So sped<BR>
M&oacute;rimi to the rebel town; and when</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>She finds<BR>out the<BR>secret.</I></TD>
<TD>A lord of &Uacute;bo sought her midst the shades<BR>
Of night, the Undoer's will possessed his lips,<BR>
And he betrayed the way of &Uacute;bo's downfall.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While &Eacute;shu's shrine yet ran with blood, the Gods,</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Meanwhile,<BR>the gods<BR>transform<BR>to stones,<BR>rivers,<BR>etc.,</I></TD>

Unknowing, sat alone in their abasement,<BR>
And &Oacute;gun said: "We scorned our upstart son;<BR>
Scorned him and let him be&#8212;nor bore in mind<BR>
The wisdom of the Past, 'A little snake<BR>
Is yet a snake.'<A NAME="page_44_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_44_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> See now the end has come:<BR>
Swift from the sight of mocking men we must<BR>
Depart. The sage Os&aacute;nyi will lay wide<BR>
The door of our deliverance: come then&#8212;<BR>
For naked of dominion what are we Gods?"<BR>
And one by one Os&aacute;nyi gave his charms<BR>
To the lorn Gods. . Or&iacute;sha could but moan<BR>
"Children I made you&#8212;who but I?" and sank<BR>
Beneath the soil he loved. And &Oacute;shun<A NAME="page_44_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_44_note_2"><FONT size=1>2</FONT></A> threw<BR>
Her body down&#8212;but never ceased: a stream<BR>
Gushed up, the sacred stream that flows for ever.<BR>
Ol&oacute;kun<A NAME="page_44_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_44_note_3"><FONT size=1>3</FONT></A> fell; 'neath the wide Earth she flowed<BR>
To the broad spaces of her troubled realm. . .</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>except<BR>&Oacute;gun.</I></TD>
<TD>So went the Gods; but last, as Os&aacute;nyi gave<BR>
The charm to &Oacute;gun, last of all the Gods&#8212;<BR>
Back from the rebel town Great M&oacute;rimi<BR>
Rushed back, and cried: "The fire the vulture brought<BR>

Shall slay the hosts of &Uacute;bo!". . . The months crept by<BR>
Fate-laden, white King &Oacute;gun's warrior son,</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Or&aacute;nyan<BR>destroys<BR>the &Uacute;bo<BR>army.</I></TD>
<TD>Or&aacute;nyan,<A NAME="page_45_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_45_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> schooled the sireless lads to War;<BR>
But when the festive season came, he hid<BR>
Them with red fire prepared within the city,<BR>
And, as the invading hosts of &Uacute;bo scaled<BR>
The walls, a rush of flaming boughs destroyed<BR>
Grass garments and rebellious men. Thus fell<BR>
&Uacute;bo before Or&aacute;nyan, and her folk<BR>
Saw slavery in &Iacute;f&egrave;. . .</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD align=right>Time spared these deeds&#8212;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD>But gave to the impenetrable wilds<BR>
The place where &Uacute;bo stood, her rebel Gods,</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>The &Eacute;di<BR>Festival</I></TD>
<TD>Her rites. And here in &Iacute;f&egrave;, by command<BR>
Of M&oacute;rimi, the children of the captives<BR>
Worship Ol&uacute;bo, but must flee before<BR>
Or&aacute;nyan's fire. And on those days of feasting<BR>
No man may blame his wife for her misdeeds&#8212;<BR>
All-mindful of the guile of M&oacute;rimi.</TD></TR>
