A white man visits Ífè, the sacred city of the Yórubas, and asks to hear
the history of the place. The Órní, the religious head of Yórubaland,
begins, and directs the Babaláwo Arába, the chief-priest of Ífa to
continue.

Oíbo, you have asked to hear our lore,<br />
The legends of the World's young hours—and where<br />
Could truth in greater surety have its home<br />
Than in the precincts of the shrines of Those<br />
Who made the World, and in the mouths of priests<br />
To whom their doings have been handed down<br />
From sire to son?</td>

There reigned Arámfè in the realm of Heaven<br />
Amidst his sons. Old were the hills around him;<br />
The Sun had shone upon his vines and cornfields<br />
Since time past reckoning. Old was Arámfè,<br />
The father of the Gods: his youth had been<br />
The youth of Heaven. . . Once when the King reclined<br />
Upon the dais, and his sons lay prostrate<br />
In veneration at his feet, he spoke</td>

But fair things which I made for you, before<br />
I called your spirits from the Dusk: for always<br />
<span id="page_14">p. 14</span> Your eyes have watched the shadows and the wind<br />
On waving corn, and I have given you<br />
The dances and the chorus of the night—<br />
An age of mirth and sunrise (the wine of Heaven)<br />
Is your existence. You have not even heard<br />
Of the grey hour when my young eyes first opened<br />
To gaze upon a herbless Mass, unshaped<br />
And unadorned. But I knew well the heart<br />
Of Him-Who-Speaks-Not, the far-felt Purpose that gave<br />
Me birth; I laboured and the grim years passed:<br />
Streams flowed along their sunny beds; I set<br />
The stars above me, and the hills about;<br />
I fostered budding trees, and taught the birds<br />
Their song—the unshapely I had formed to beauty,<br />
And as the ages came I loved to make<br />
The beautiful more fair. . . All went not well:<br />
A noble animal my mind conceived<br />
Emerged in loathsome form to prey upon<br />
My gentle creatures; a river, born to bask<br />
In sunlit channels and mirror the steep hills,<br />
Tore down its banks and ravaged field and plain;<br />
While cataract and jagged precipice,<br />
Now grand with years, remind me of dread days<br />
<span id="page_15">p. 15</span> When Heaven tottered, and wide rifts sundered my young<br />
Fair hills, and all seemed lost. Yet—I prevailed.<br />
Think, now, if the accomplished whole be Heaven,<br />
How wonderful the anxious years of slow<br />
And hazardous achievement—a destiny<br />
For Gods. But yours it has not been to lead<br />
Creation by the cliff's-edge way from Mass<br />
To Paradise." He paused on the remembrance,<br />
And Great Orísha cried: "Can we do naught?<br />
What use in godhead without deeds to do?<br />
Where yearns a helpless region for a hand<br />
To guide it?" And Old Arámfè answered him:</td>

Rests always on the outer waste which skirts<br />
Our realm; beyond, a nerveless Mass lies cold<br />
'Neath floods which some malign unreason heaves.<br />

The five-clawed Bird, the sand of power.<span id="page_15_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_15_note_1">1</a> Go now,<br />
Call a despairing land to smiling life<br />

For a new race whose destiny is not<br />
The eternal life of Gods. You are their judge;<br />
<span id="page_16">p. 16</span> Yours is the kingship, and to you all Gods<br />
And men are subject. Wisest of my sons,<br />

My younger sons, the chorus and the dance,<br />
The voice of worship and the crafts are yours<br />
To teach—that the new thankful race may know<br />
The mirth of Heaven and the joys of labour."<br />
Then Odúwa said: "Happy our life has been,<br />
And I would gladly roam these hills for ever,<br />
Your son and servant. But to your command<br />
I yield; and in my kingship pride o'ersteps<br />
Sorrow and heaviness. Yet, Lord Arámfè,<br />
I am your first-born: wherefore do you give<br />
The arts and wisdom to Orísha? I,<br />
The King, will be obeyed; the hearts of men<br />
Will turn in wonder to the God who spells<br />
Strange benefits." But Arámfè said "Enough;<br />
To each is fitting task is given. Farewell."</td>
