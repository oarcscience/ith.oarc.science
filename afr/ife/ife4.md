I am the voice of Ífa, messenger<br />
Of all the Gods: to me the histories<br />
Are known, and I will tell you of the days<br />
Of the Descent. How Old Arámfè sent<br />
The Gods from Heaven, and Odudúwa stole<br />
The bag—my king has told you. . . For many a day<br />
Across unwatered plains the Great Ones journeyed,<br />
And sandy deserts—for such is the stern bar<br />
Set by Arámfè 'twixt his smiling vales</td>

<td>And the stark cliff's edge which his sons approached<br />
Tremblingly, till from the sandy brink they peered<br />
Down the sheer precipice. Behind them lay<br />
The parched, forbidding leagues; but yet the Sun<br />
Was there, and breezes soft, and yet the mountains—<br />
A faded line beyond the shimmering waste—<br />
Called back to mind their ancient home. Beneath<br />
Hung chaos—dank blackness and the threatening roar<br />
Of untamed waters. Then Odudúwa spoke:<br />
"Orísha, what did we? And what fault was ours?<br />
Outcasts to-day; to-morrow we must seek<br />
Our destiny in dungeons, and beneath<br />
<span id="page_21">p. 21</span> That yawning blackness we must found a city<br />
For unborn men. Better a homeless life<br />
In desert places: dare we turn and flee<br />
To some lost valley of the hills? Orísha,<br />
What think you?" Then spoke Orísha whom men call<br />
The Great: "Is this Odúwa that I hear—<br />
My mother's son who stole Arámfè's gift,<br />
And thought to filch away the hearts of men<br />
With blessings which were mine to give? For me,<br />
The arts I know I long to use, and yearn<br />
To see the first of toiling, living men<br />
That I shall make. Forbidding is our task,<br />
You say—but think, ere we return to peace<br />
And Heaven's calm, how boundless is the fate<br />
You flinch from! Besides, is Godhead blind?</td>

Orísha; and Odúwa hung a chain<br />
Over the cliff to the dark water's face,<br />
And sent Ojúmu, the wise priest, to pour<br />
The magic sand upon the sea and loose<br />

Triumphant land.<span id="page_22_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_22_note_1">1</a> But, as Earth's ramparts grew,<br />
Ever in the darkness came the waves and sucked<br />
Away the crumbling shore, while foot by foot<br />
Lagoons crept up, and turned to reedy swamps<br />
The soil of hope. So Odudúwa called</td>

And thus he spoke: "Beneath, the waters wrestle<br />
With the new-rising World, and would destroy<br />
Our kingdom and undo Arámfè's will.<br />
Go to the fields of men to be, the homes<br />
That they shall make. Olókun! to the sea!<br />
For there your rule and your dominion shall be:<br />
To curb the hungry waves upon the coastlands<br />
For ever. And thus, in our first queen of cities<br />
And secret sanctuaries on lonely shores<br />
Through every æon as the season comes,<br />
Shall men bring gifts in homage to Olókun.<br />
And you, Olóssa, where your ripple laps<br />
The fruitful bank, shan see continually<br />
The offerings of thankful men."</td>

The corners of the World were steadfast. And then<br />
Odúwa called Orísha and the Gods<br />
To the cliff's edge, and spoke these words of sorrow:<br />
"We go to our sad kingdom. Such is the will<br />
Of Old Arámfè: so let it be. But ere<br />
The hour the wilderness which gapes for us<br />
Engulf us utterly, ere the lingering sight<br />
Of those loved hills can gladden us no more—<br />
May we not dream awhile of smiling days<br />
Gone by? . . Fair was drenched morning in the Sun<br />
When dark the hill-tops rose o'er misty hollows;<br />
Fair were the leafy trees of night beneath<br />
The silvering Moon, and beautiful the wind<br />
Upon the grasslands. Good-bye, ye plains we roamed.</td>

Beneath the thunder of the unseen waves<br />
On crumbling shores around. Always the marsh<br />
Pressed eagerly on Ífè; but ever the Bird<br />
Returned with the unconquerable sand<br />
Ojúmu poured from his enchanted shell,<br />
And the marsh yielded. Then young Ógun bade<br />
The Forest grow her whispering trees—but she<br />
Budded the pallid shoots of hopeless night,<br />
And all was sorrow round the sodden town<br />
Where Odudúwa reigned. Yet for live men</td>

Of Night, Olókun and Olóssa, and all<br />

From outer nowhere to the murk beyond. . .<br />

Wistfully—as one who follows the set flight<br />
<span id="page_25">p. 25</span> Of a lone sea-bird when the sunset fades<br />
Beyond a marshy wilderness—and spoke<br />
To Odudúwa: "Our day is endless night,<br />
And deep, wan woods enclose our weeping children.<br />
The Ocean menaces, chill winds moan through<br />
Our mouldering homes. Our guardian Night, who spoke<br />
To us with her strange sounds in the still hours<br />
Of Heaven is here; yet she can but bewail<br />
Her restless task. And where is Evening? Oh! where<br />
Is Dawn?" He ceased, and Odudúwa sent<br />
Ífa, the Messenger, to his old sire<br />
To crave the Sun and the warm flame that lit<br />
The torch of Heaven's Evening and the dance. . .</td>

For men; and, by the Gods' command, the bird<br />

A mark of honour for remembrance. Again<br />
The Father spoke the word, and the pale Moon<br />
Sought out the precincts of calm Night's retreat<br />
