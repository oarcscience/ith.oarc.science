Proudly bore many sons unto their lord,<br />
A daughter only, young Adétoún,<br />
Was granted to his queen. And as the years<br />
Lagged by, a strangeness which he always seemed<br />
To keep in hiding chequered the fair day<br />
With doubtings, and waylaid her in the paths<br />
Of her fond nightly dreams. Once with the Spring,<br />
She saw the clustered tree-tops breaking into leaf<br />
Copper and red and every green, and she<br />
Remembered how beneath the new year's buds<br />
It was ordained by Peregún ’Gbo, lord<br />
Of uninhabitable woods that Life<br />
<span id="page_36">p. 36</span> Should spring from Forest, and Life from Life,—till all<br />
The Woods were gladdened with the voice of beasts<br />
And birds—and thus she reasoned: "Is it not told<br />
How Peregún ’Gbo<span id="page_36_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_36_note_1">1</a> spoke, and from the womb<br />
Of Forest leaped the sloth that laughs by night?<br />
How 'mid the boughs the sloth brought forth the ape<br />
That bore the leopard? And did not Peregún<br />
Watch o'er the birth of young Orúnmila,<br />
And ever, when the morrow's sorrowing dawn<br />
Must yield up to the leaguing fiends the child's<br />
Fair life, did not the watchful God send down<br />
His messenger to stay the grasping hand<br />
Of Death? Thus do the Gods; and surely one<br />
Will give me sons. Ah! whom must I appease?"</td>

A priest of Ífa<span id="page_36_fr_2"></span><a href="#page_36_note_2">2</a> in his court yard dim,<br />
Where from each beam and smoke-grimed pillar hung<br />
The charms the wise man set to guard his home,<br />
His wives and children from the ills contrived<br />
<span id="page_37">p. 37</span> By the bad spirits. To her gift she whispered,<br />
And laid it on Okpéllè; and the priest<br />
Seizing the charm of Ífa said: "Okpéllè,<br />
To you the woe of Mórimi is known;<br />
You only can reveal its secret cause,<br />
Its unknown cure!" Then he laid down the charm<br />
And Óffun Kánran stood before them. The face<br />
Of Ífa's priest was troubled, and he said:</td>

Ífa: a son, nay many sons, you long for.<br />
You have a daughter, and your husband's love<br />
Was yours. The Gods would give you many sons,<br />
But in your path stands Éshu, the Undoer,<br />
Whose shrine calls out for blood, for sacrifice:<br />
Adétoún." Without hope Mórimi<br />
Went forth, and loathing of the ways of the Gods<br />
Possessed her—while indignation fed her love<br />
Of her one child. . . .</td>

"But sons l asked for; I will go again<br />
<span id="page_38">p. 38</span> And pray for sons and my Adétoún.<br />

The far-off, thundrous voice. Would you hold back?<br />
Is not the birth of Nations the first law<br />

His will, or maid stern Ógun's call?<span id="page_38_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_38_note_1">1</a> To-day<br />
Is yours, oh, mother of great kings that shall be:<br />
The green shoots greet the Spring-rain and forget<br />
The barren months, and Mórimi shall know<br />
Her grief and her reproach no more." Then doubt<br />
<span id="page_39">p. 39</span> Seized Mórimi but still she answered; "Will Gods<br />
Not give? Is the grim World a morning market<br />
Where they drive bargains with the folk they made?<br />
Are babes as bangles which Obálufon<br />
Fashions to barter?" But Édi answered her:<br />
"But once Arámfè spoke to Odudúwa,<br />
And with what heavy hearts the Gods went forth<br />
From Heaven's valleys to the blackness! Now thrice,<span id="page_39_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_39_note_1">1</a><br />
Thrice to the woman Mórimi the word<br />
Has come—with promise of the World's desire:<br />
Not every wife is chosen for the mother<br />
Of a house of kings. And think!—Obálufon!"<br />

In darkness; and with the dawn a young girl lay</td>
