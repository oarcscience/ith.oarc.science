# CHAPTER IX.

### THE MARVELOUS ARABIAN CIVILIZATION.

Arabia was one of the earliest colonies of the ancient Cushite Empire of
Ethiopians. Baldwin claims that it was the original land of Cush. He
says, "In the oldest recorded traditions, Arabia is the land of Cush,
the celebrated Ethiopia of very remote times." He continues, "In ages
older than Egypt or Chaldea, Arabia was the seat of an enlightened and
enterprising civilization that went far into neighboring countries. At
that time Arabia was the exalted and wonderful Ethiopia of olden
tradition, the center and life of what in western Asia was known as the
civilized world. Traditions of the ancient world rightly interpreted can
have no other meaning. In the early traditions and records of Greece,
Arabia was described as Ethiopia." Arabia was only separated from old
Ethiopia by the Red Sea. We would decide that the "Old Race" of the
Upper Nile early sent colonies across the sea, which built up the cities
and communities along the opposite Arabian coast. This happening before
the founding of Memphis or the colonizing of Chaldea.

The Scriptures unite Arabia with the most intimate dealings of God with
men. Here says the *Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature*, were transacted

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

the marvelous panorama of the life of the Patriarch Job, who was
described as one of the greatest men of the east. To this land Moses
escaped after killing the Egyptian. Here he lived (put to school as it
were) among the Midianites, descendants of Cush. Here he married a
daughter of Ethiopia, here: he saw the burning bush and here he talked
with God. Here Elijah was fed by the ravens. In Arabia was the scene of
all the marvelous displays of divine power and mercy that followed the
deliverance of Israel from Egypt and accompanied their journeyings into
the Promised Land, and here Jehovah manifested himself in
[visible](errata.htm#52.md) glory to his people. Here today in the desert
of Sin, manna still forms a tiny cereal upon the rocks. It was out of
this region that God selected the race through which in two religions,
one supreme God should be revealed to the world, the Hebrews and
Mohammedans spring from the same race.

These primitive Semites were a north Arabian race. Southern Arabia was
occupied by the older and more civilized Ethiopian race. Gibbon speaks
of Sabaeans in north Arabia, if they were it was families that had
passed northward after the Flood of Arem, which dispersed the families
of old Yemen over northern Arabia. These people were advanced in
civilization. The fact that the father-in-law of Moses could show him
defects in his administration of government, proves that he was in
possession of an older and more seasoned form of law. The Scriptures
tell us that Moses harkened to the voice of his father-in-law

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

and did all that he said. There is marked similarity between the Jewish
law and the code of Hammurabi, which was the essence of the old laws
that for thousands of years had ruled the Cushite race. The Jewish law
maker was thus placed in close contact with the race which in earlier
ages had possessed the revelations of God in law and equity. This is why
the code of Hammurabi, though it preceded Jewish law by many ages, yet
in many features was the same code.

Arabia possessed many products in ancient days, that were coveted by the
rest of the world. Nothing then was considered more costly and desirable
than frankincense and myrrh, which were Arabia's fabled products. It was
by this commerce that she amassed her fabulous wealth. The treasures of
Africa were conveyed over the peninsula to Gerrha. Joined by the pearls
of the Persian Gulf, this commerce was floated on rafts to the mouth of
the Euphrates. Diodorus Siculus says, Bk. II, ch. 3, "The perfumes of
Arabia ravished the senses and were conveyed by the winds to those who
sailed near the coast. Having never been conquered, by the largeness of
their country, they flow in gold and silver; and likewise their beds,
chairs and stools have their feet of silver; and all their house stuff
is so sumptuous and magnificent that it is incredible. The porticoes of
their homes and temples, in some cases are overlaid with gold. They have
enjoyed a constant uninterrupted peace for many ages and generations.
Archaeological research has proved

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

these assertions to have been true of the southern Arabians of the
Hamitic race.

Pliny said of these Arabians that they were the richest nations in the
world. The harbors of Oman and Aden were laden with the precious cargo
of perfumes. Agatharchides declared, "The Sabaeans surpass in wealth and
[magnificence](errata.htm#53.md) not only the neighboring barbarians but
all the nations whatsoever. As their distant situation protects them
from foreign plunderers, immense stores of precious metals have, been
accumulated among them, especially in the [capital](errata.htm#54.md). They
have curiously wrought gold and silver drinking [vessels](errata.htm#55.md)
in great variety, couches and tripods, with silver feet; an incredible
profusion of costly furniture in general; porticoes with large columns
partly gilt and capitals ornamented with gold fretwork set with precious
stones; besides an extraordinary magnificence reigning in the
decorations of their houses, where they use silver, gold, ivory and the
most precious stones and all other things that men deem valuable." (*De
Mari Erythraeo*, 102.) This civilization was one that rose and perished
long before the day of the Saracens.

From Baldwin's researches we learn that Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, as well
as the Hebrew writers speak of the great cities of Arabia, that no
longer exist. So fax back does this ancient civilization extend that
from the great length of time its literature has disappeared. The
monuments of these Himyarites were inscribed with an obsolete and
mysterious alphabet. The present Cufic letters

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

were invented on the banks of the Euphrates, Gibbon tells us. The
present inhabitants cannot explain the ancient ruins. They owe their
origin to very remote antiquity. At Mareb is the Great Tank, so famous
in Arabic tradition. The history of its origin was lost before the age
of Solomon. Then the solid and vast embankment was going to decay. The
ancient city of Saba was in ruins before the time of Christ. Throughout
Yemen are to be found gigantic ruins which bewilder the beholders, who
cannot understand how they were raised by human hands. They were built
by the same race that reared the columns at Belbec and Karnak. These
original Arabians were spoken of by later Arabs as Adites, Men of Ad,
giants of old.

Lenormant in his painstaking researches found that Cushites were the
first inhabitants of Arabia and were known in the national traditions as
Adites. These descended from Ad, a grandson of Ham. His sons were Shedid
and Shedad. To them was attributed the Shepherd invasion of Egypt. It
was recorded in the traditions that one of them built a palace of superb
columns surrounded by a magnificent garden. He tried to imitate the
celestial paradise and God took him away. The Adites, were depicted as
men of gigantic stature. Fanciful tales like the Arabian Nights exist in
Arabian legends, springing from the same source as those of the Egyptian
manuscripts. Lenormant says, "We may perceive in all this the
remembrance of a powerful empire founded by Cushites in very early ages.
We find

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

traces of a wealthy nation, constructors of great buildings, with an
advanced civilization like that of Chaldea. This must be true as
everywhere we find traces of Cushites in Arabian literature and their
brothers the Canaanites." (*Ancient History of the East*, Lenormant,
Vol. III, Arabians, p. 296 )

Alexander the Great said that Arabia was inferior to no country of the
earth. He referred to the once famous town of Oman, which had been a
harbor of the ancient commerce. It was in the day of Alexander a
wilderness. His estimate of these Cushites was, "Taking them all in all,
they are the richest nation of the world." Alexander lived in the
declining days of Ethiopian power. Himyar was the son of Seba, the son
of Cush. These were the people of Yemen and the Sabaeans of the Greeks.
Lenormant called them related to the Accadians of Shinar and the Ghez of
Abyssinia. Himyar became the head of the dynasty of Himyarites. These
Cushite Arabians were a fine race of remarkable stature, and dark
complexion. The Semitic Arabians are brown, thin, small, well formed and
of opposite traits from the Cushite Arabian. The Omanee kingdom attained
a latter great splendor at the beginning of the Nineteenth Century. The
conquering Mohammedan tribes of the north in idol-destroying mood have
effaced all the pagan temples that once covered Arabia. Several enormous
stone circles like those of some parts of Europe, built as a form of
primitive religion, still remain.

At Hagerein, Gen. E. T. Haig saw the ruins

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

of once fertile districts under the weight of sand that had overwhelmed
them. There were ruins of once lofty square buildings. The ground lies
strewn with fragments of Himyaritic inscriptions and pottery. Wherever
he found ruins they were on elevated spots. The centers of civilization
in the valleys must have been buried very deeply. Arabia, just as once
fertile spots of the Sahara, has been overwhelmed by the sand. At Al
Azorem are many ancient stone monuments on slightly elevated ground. The
old Cushite stones of cromlech type abound. They are decorated with
geometric patterns, which are like the Cushite decorations of Rhodesia
in Africa and those of Asia Minor. There were buildings surrounded by
stone walls. Welsted uncovered at Nakab-el-Hajar a massive wall, thirty
or forty feet high flanked with square towers. On the face of the
building he found an inscription in the ancient Himyaritic writing,
which is a form of the primitive African language and has no relation to
the Semitic tongues.

In Yemen appears another evidence of Cushite occupation, the terracing
to be found on all ancient Hamitic sites. In one district the whole
mountainside was terraced from top to bottom. Gen. Haig saw in this
district everywhere above, below and around, endless flights of terraced
walls. One can hardly realize the enormous amount of labor, toil and
perseverance, these represent. These walls were usually four or five
feet in height, but toward the top, they were sometimes is high as
fifteen to eighteen feet. Agriculture

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

among these indefatigable people was brought to the highest degree of
perfection. They constructed immense dikes, forming permanent
reservoirs, which irrigated the lowlands in dry weather. The Semitic
Arabian abhors agriculture. It is by these differences in traits that we
can unerringly detect race. When the Israelites first appear in the
light of Bible history, they were keepers of flocks. Pastorals do not
originate culture. The nature of their life renders it impossible.
Nomadic people. have been the invincible opponents of culture.

A primitive form of religion called Sabaeanism spread all over the
Arabian provinces in the earlier ages. We find a gross form of
Sabaeanism among the Turanian nations mixed with magic, but this
religion in Arabia was without images, idolatry or priesthood. Once this
religion was spread over the whole primitive world wherever Cushites
were established. They addressed worship to the stars from high places.
It was probably from this observation of the stars, that the science of
astronomy first developed among them. To this use was put the tops of
the pyramids. The pyramids of the ancients were built by this race for
sacerdotal purposes. In India, Egypt, Rhodesia, in West Africa and
western Europe this worship from high mountains was slow to die out. The
ancient inhabitants of Arabia Petraea and Yemen believed in one god and
a future life. .Dead ancestors were [canonized](errata.htm#56.md) and
worshipped by their families. This one custom marked the race of "Anu"
one of the names of the "Old

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Race" of the Upper Nile. The people that by the
traditions of Western Europe settled old Gaul, Ireland, Spain, and
ancient Thrace.

Myers tells us in his *Ancient History*, that just as the
"[Odyssey](errata.htm#57.md)" of Homer mirrored the trade voyages of the
prehistoric Greeks, so the marvelous tales of Sinbad the Sailor pictured
the adventures of the Cushite Arabian sailors upon the seas. The ships
of these Ethiopians in the early ages of their dominion covered the
ancient world. It was from this branch of the race, that the early race
of India gained the knowledge that appears in Sanskrit books, that
contain maps upon which we can trace the outlines of Western Europe and
the British Isles. These books portray knowledge of ages prior to 2000
B. C. The Phoenicians in later times only followed courses that their
Cushite cousins had pursued in earlier ages. They learned geography from
their wide conquests and extended trade relations. The
[Portuguese](errata.htm#58.md) found maps and charts in their possession
when they first came in contact with them on the coasts of East Africa,
which were original and authentic. Some showed routes extending to the
new world long before the age of Columbus.

One early [Portuguese](errata.htm#59.md) map, gained from these Arabians
marks South America, Western Africa and Southern Europe, as three
ancient centers of civilization. The remains of primitive American
nations give forth relics, proving ancient Cushite communication. Before
the arrival of the Portuguese, Arabian navigators had kept this
knowledge secret. With declining Ethiopian power the

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

links of this great chain had been broken to the Americas but they still
kept up the ancient lines of trade with the nations peculiarly Cushite,
India, Chaldea, South Africa, and Western Europe. By caravan routes they
crossed deserts and delivered merchandise to the North African colonies,
which in ages earlier than Phoenician dominion had been Cushite
Ethiopian nations. To sum up we must decide that the meager information
of the average historical book is very misleading as to who were the
original Arabians and the giving of the right credit to the race which
was responsible for the earlier so-called Arabian conquest of Babylonia.
The later spurious stock, the Semitic Arabians appeared there in
comparatively modern times. They were a pastoral, warlike people who in
their mode of life, their food, their dress, their traits, manners,
customs, and government were wholly unlike the original Arabians.

Through the ages these differences have remained unalterable. The riches
to be gained as carriers induced some of the Semitic Arabian tribes from
the more wild life to the service of bearers of the rich ancient
commerce over the, deserts. Having to constantly change their residence
these Semites live in movable tents. These are divided into two parts
one of which is for the women. The tents are arranged in an irregular
circle, the space between being reserved as a fold for the cattle at
night. As they have no land belonging to themselves they change their
abode as often as they please. Col. Capper thus

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

describes an Arab encampment, "From this hill, we could see at a
distance of about three miles an Arab encampment, an immense body. There
were nearly twenty thousand of them including women and children. They
demanded and received tribute from us and promised a protecting guard
until we were past all danger of attack from their detached bands."
Those too poor to own a tent sheltered themselves under a piece of cloth
suspended from poles Their tents are of coarse black material woven by
the women from goats' hair.

The primitive nature of the Semitic Arabian is to be seen in the
religion of Mohammed, in the presentation of his gospel, at the point of
the sword; as Gibbon says, if they professed the creed of Islam they
were admitted to all spiritual and material benefits. His apostles
united the professions of merchant and robber. The distribution of the
spoil was regulated according to Mohammed by divine law. From all sides
the roving Arabs were allured to his standard by this combination of
religion and plunder. In one incidence seven hundred Jews were dragged
in chains to the market place of the city and descended alive into the
grave prepared for their execution and burial; and the Apostle beheld
with an [inflexible](errata.htm#60.md) eye the slaughter of his helpless
enemies. In 628, the town of Khaibar surrendered, the chief of the tribe
was tortured in the presence of Mohammed, to force confession of his
hidden treasure.

Gibbon looks on the other side of Mohammed's character. He seemed
endowed, whether he was

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

an imposter or enthusiast, with a pious and contemplative disposition.
He despised the pomp of royalty; he observed without effort or vanity
the abstemious diet of an Arab and a soldier. The interdiction of wine
arose and was confirmed by his example. The freedom of divorce was
discouraged and [adultery](errata.htm#61.md) made a capital offense. During
the twenty-four years of his marriage to his first wife, he abstained
from polygamy. At her death he placed her in the rank of the four
perfect women. The triumphant banners of Mohammed after his death waved
over the cities of the Euphrates. Persia was reduced. Turning to Syria,
his followers invested Damascus, which fell; then Jerusalem, until all
Syria, bowed under the scepter of the caliphs. Greek rule had become
odious in Egypt and it was gladly exchanged for the rule of the
Saracens. The Greeks retreated from Upper Egypt and made their last
stand at Alexandria. After a [siege](errata.htm#62.md) of fourteen months
the Saracens prevailed. Mohammed's standard was set up on the walls of
the capital of Egypt.

Let us examine the passage of the Semitic Arabians across Africa. Was
his influence for the making of civilization? They burned the priceless
collection of books that made up the Alexandrian library, in which were
locked up the secrets of the lost arts and the knowledge of the origin
of civilization. So great was the number of books that six months were
needed for the consumption of this precious fuel. Every scholar with
pious indignation has deplored this irreparable shipwreck of the
learning and genius of antiquity. Many

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Africans and Moors helped to make up the numbers
and strength of the armies of the Saracens. After successive
expeditions, the arms of Hassan reduced and pillaged Carthage. Greeks
and Goths who came to the aid of Carthage were defeated and the city
given to the flames. This ancient Metropolis of Africa was destroyed,
all but the broken arches of an aqueduct. The Moors under the standard
of a queen attacked the invaders with an enthusiasm equal to their own
and the Arabians were driven back to the confines of Egypt. In later
expeditions the blood of the Moors and Semites was insensibly mixed.

Moor and Arab attacked Spain then under the crumbling domination of the
Goth. They landed at the Pillars of Hercules. The royal city of Toledo
fell. Their conquest spread northward. A table of emerald, Gothic spoil
from the Romans, was sent to the caliph at Damascus. In 712 A. D. 10,000
Arabs and 8,000 Africans passed over from Mauritania into Spain. The
ports were thrown open to the vessels of Syria and the Goths were
pursued to Gaul. Spain imbibed in a few generations the name and manners
of the Arabs. This need not be surprising for in Spain was the basic
blood of the Cushite, that ran in the Moor and the Cushite Arabian, who
as natives of Yemen and other Cushite centers of Arabia, represented the
proudest and noblest of the Arabian tribes. From this combination of
conquerors sprang a most prosperous era of wealth, cultivation and
populousness for Spain. Those who were willing to pay a moderate tribute
were allowed freedom of

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

conscience in religious worship. Where it [paid](errata.htm#63.md) the
Moslem practiced moderation.

A glance taken over the vast empire of the Semitic Arabians finds them
extended from the confines of Tartary and India to the shores of the
Atlantic. The laws of the Koran were studied with equal zeal at
Samaracand and Seville. Hindu and Moor embraced as brothers on the
[pilgrimage](errata.htm#64.md) to Mecca. Yet this does not seem strange for
the Moor and Hindu in race were brothers. Forty-six years after the
flight of Mohammed from Mecca, Arabian arms appeared under the walls of
Constantinople in [siege](errata.htm#65.md) of the city. The solid and
lofty walls were guarded by numbers and discipline. For six summers they
made an attack with a retreat. This revived me reputation of the Roman
arms and cast a momentary shade over the glory of the Saracens. Persia
and Syria revolted. 717 A. D. the attack was made on Constantinople by
120,000 Arabs and Persians. A huge armada approached from Egypt and
Syria. Entering the harbor they were assailed with Greek Be and the
Arabian arms and vessels were involved in flames. In a later attempt the
Egyptian ships deserted to the Christian emperor. The arms of Arabia
retired after almost incredible disasters.

The deliverance of Constantinople sprang from the terror and efficacy of
Greek fire. The skill of a chemist defeated fleets and armies, a distant
forerunner of the gases of the world war of our day. Its composition was
guarded by the Greeks with zealous care. It was the invention of a
Cushite

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

Arabian but was bought by the emperor and it filled the Semitic Arabs
with superstitious terror. The secret of Greek fire was finally stolen
by the Mohammedans and returned upon the heads of the Christians in the
holy wars of Syria and Egypt. This Arabian invention effected a
revolution in the art of war and in the history of mankind. Turning for
a survey of the onward sweep of the Saracens of the west, we find them
invading Gaul (France). Here we find Goth, Gascon and Franks assembled
under the standard of the Duke of Iberian (Cushite) Aquitaine. He
repelled their first invasion. In a second engagement the Arabs
conquered and overran Aquitaine They stripped the churches of their
ornaments and delivered them to the flames. Their invasion formed the
groundwork of many a weird tale of chivalry.

Had they not been checked, instead of the Bible, interpretations of the
Koran would today be taught at Oxford. To a circumcised people would be
demonstrated the revelations of Mohammed. Christendom was delivered by
the genius of one man. Half the kingdom was in the hands of the Saracens
when Charles Martel, Duke of the Franks aided by the Germans met the
enemy in the, center of France. At the close of seven days of fighting
the leader of the Saracens was slain. The tribes of Yemen, Damascus,
Africa and Spain were provoked to turn their arms against one an-other.
A hasty and separate retreat was made the spoils being left in the
tents. The victory of the Franks was complete and final. Aquitaine

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

was recovered by the arms of Eudes. Thus the ancient Franks saved the
Christian world. Arabia at this time was convulsed with the massacre of
the warring factions claiming their right of succession to the authority
of Mohammed. The chair of Mohammed was disputed by three caliphs. At
Bagdad they aspired to emulate the magnificence of the Persian kings.
$150,000,000 was exhausted in a few years by the children of Caliph
Almansor. His grandson showered a thousand pearls of largest size upon
the head of his bride. Barges and boats of superb decoration were seen
on the Tigris. In the palace were 38,000 pieces of tapestry, 12,500 of
which were embroidered with gold.

Here was a perfect setting for the stories of the Arabian Nights,
Gibbons continues this description, "A hundred lions were brought out
with a keeper to each lion. Among the other spectacles of rare and
stupendous luxury was a tree of gold and silver spreading into eighteen
large branches, on the [lesser](errata.htm#66.md) branches sat a variety of
birds made of the same precious metals, as well as the leaves of the
tree. While the machinery effected spontaneous motions, the several
birds warbled their natural harmony." In the west the Caliphs of Cordova
supported an equal pomp. The hall of audience was incrusted with gold
and pearls. The caliph was attended to the field by a guard of 12,000
horse, whose belts and [scimitars](errata.htm#67.md) were studded with
gold. Luxury terminated the progress of the Arabian empire. 786 A. D.
Harun, the most powerful and vigorous

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

monarch of his race, ascended the throne. He was the perpetual hero of
the Arabian tales. He swept the surface of Asia Minor. The ruin was
complete, the spoil was ample, 823 A. D. the islands of Crete and Sicily
fell and the cities of the age of Minos became thirty.

846 A. D. a fleet of Saracens from the African coast entered the Tiber
and approached Rome. Her gates and ramparts were guarded by a trembling
people. The costly offerings were torn from the altars. The Arabians
divided their forces to pillage the neighboring towns of Fundi and
Gaeta, and this division saved the capital from the yoke of the Prophet
of Mecca. 838 Saracens advanced again upon Constantinople. A domestic
traitor after fifty-five days of fruitless fighting pointed out the
weakest part of the wall. Constantinople fell, the Arabs satiated with
destruction then returned to Bagdad. Quarter was seldom given in the
field. Those who escaped the edge of the sword were condemned to
helpless servitude or exquisite torture. As the Arabian conquerors
mingled with the servile crowds of Persia, Syria and Egypt, they lost
the free-born virtues of the desert. Therefore the mercenary forces of
the caliphs were recruited from the north. Mutasm introduced into the
capital fifty thousand Turks. His son was cut in seven pieces by their
swords. In three years they created, deposed and murdered three
commanders of the faithful. Then Abbasids curbed and divided their
power.

Near the end of the ninth century an imposter

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

arose. He relaxed the duties, ablution, fasting and pilgrimage. His
twelve apostles dispersed themselves among the Bedouins, a race of men
whom Abulfeda called equally devoid of reason and religion. His subjects
were ripe for revolt disclaiming the title of the house of Abbas and
abhorring the worldly pomp of the caliphs of Bagdad. 107,000 fanatics
took and pillaged the cities of Racca, Baalbec, Cufa and Bassora. Bagdad
was filled with consternation. The city was taken. They stormed and
trampled upon the most venerable relics of the Mohammedan faith. Their
sect was finally broken into sections but they were a second visible
cause of the fall of the empire of caliphs. A third cause was the
[unwieldiness](errata.htm#68.md) of the empire resulting from its
magnitude. The provinces of Syria and Egypt were twice dismembered by
Turkish slaves. The sons of the caliphs were educated in the vices of
kings. 1000 A. D. Persia became free and her language and genius
revived. Radhi the thirty-ninth of the successors of the Prophet was the
last to represent the wealth and magnificence of the caliphs. After him
the lords of the eastern world were reduced to abject misery. The
treasury was no longer replenished by the spoil and tribute of nations.
The African and Turkish guards turned their swords against each other.
The chief commanders imprisoned or deposed their sovereigns. 945 A. D.
the caliph was dragged from the throne to a dungeon. His palace was
pillaged and his eyes put out.

In this school of adversity the caliphs went

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

back to the rigid virtues of the more primitive times. Sometimes through
the division of their tyrants the Abbasids were restored to the
sovereignty of Bagdad. Their misfortunes were embittered by the triumphs
of the Fatimites, claimed progeny of the daughter of Mohammed. Rising
from the extremity of Africa, they put an end to the authority of the
Abbasids. In the declining age of the caliphs the arms of the Byzantine
empire extirpated the nest of the Arabian pirates upon the island of
Crete. 963 A. D. and 969 A. D. was the most splendid period of the
Byzantine annals. Roman arms were carried into the heart of Syria. The
reign of Caesar and of Christ was restored at Antioch the ancient
metropolis of the east. At Aleppo they found in the stately palace
outside the walls a magazine of arms, 1400 mules and three hundred bags
of silver and gold. A hundred cities were reduced to obedience. Greek
ardor was quickened to seize the virgin treasures of Bagdad but they had
already been dissipated by the avarice and prodigality of the domestic
tyrants. The fears of Bagdad were relieved by the retreat of the Greeks.
Hunger and thirst had guarded the deserts of Mesopotamia. The emperor
laden with oriental spoils returned to Byzantium. The Moslems purified
their temples and overturned their idols but the old days of glory were
fled. 1538 the claim to the caliphate passed to the Ottoman Turks. Their
sultan called himself head of the Mohammedan world.
