# CHAPTER XVI.

### HINDU RELIGION AND LITERATURE.

India with its deeply religious people has given two great religions to
the world. Buddhism and Brahminism are typical of the intermingled races
from which they have come. Buddhism arose from the more ancient
civilization. The older temples, of India are to Buddha. His worship was
anterior to that of Brahma. In the Ramayana they are spoken of as
opponents. Buddhism was older than Buddha-Gautema, who was only one of
the incarnations of the old faith. In India, China, Thibet and Nepal six
mortal predecessors of Buddha are recognized. The Jains celebrated one
of his forerunners. Because of this the various sects differed and
disputed about his coming. The dates of the incarnations of Buddha
ranged from 2450 B. C. to 453 B. C. Buddhism was the evolution of many
centuries. It sprang from some earlier form of Cushite faith. Buddhists
when they pray call: upon "Ad." The early Cushites were Adites. This
religion preached equality and held the primitive inhabitants. The
Cushites of western Europe possessed the worship of Buddha in primitive
ages. There had been religious pilgrimages between them and the people
of India in those old days. Woden father of the gods of northern Europe
was the Indian

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Buddha. (See *Ancient Races of Western Europe*,
Chapter XX.)

Buddha Gautema a prince of a Sakya clan, was an Indian sage of the fifth
century before Christ. He was a prince filled with compassion for the
human race and works of charity. He left the courts of royalty and lived
in hermitage striving to read the mysterious riddle of life. He became
the incarnation of Buddha. His teaching was that there is no escape from
pain, that to attain perfection our appetites and emotions must be kept
in subjection. He practiced extreme renunciation, giving up his princely
rights, wife and infant son. He sought to forget self in a life of
service for others. The principles of his faith were abstinence from
lying, stealing, adultery, drunkenness, indulgence in extravagant
entertainment, feasting and theatrical performances. He idealized and
made beautiful by his life and teachings the primal virtues--purity,
charity, patience, courage, introspection and understanding. His ethics
warned his disciples against coarse language and indulgence in vain and
frivolous talk. This faith was accepted by the later Scythian hoards,
though they made changes in it. Thus it became a great Lord of union
between the races of India and the fiercer Mongolian peoples.

Gautema did not leave his doctrines in writing. He taught and talked to
the people. His words were carefully treasured and reduced to writing
after his death. There is an almost identical likeness between his
teachings and those of the Saviour but Gautema preceeded Him by five
hundred

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

years. Buddha carried his message not to caste but to the common men. He
brought a spiritual [deliverance](errata.htm#154.md) to the people not
through imaginary deities but by conduct. The Buddhist books we now
possess are the work of several [canons](errata.htm#155.md) and were
completed two full centuries before the birth of Christ. Buddhism was a
protest against caste distinctions. It permeates and softens even today
the Brahminism that thrust it out of India. Buddha forbade the worship
of images. The religion was pure in its beginning, but has become
confounded with the worship of the sage. Though now banished from India
by the persecutions of the Brahmins, Buddhism prevails in Ceylon,
Burmah, Siam, Thibet, Mongolia, Java and Japan. Buddhism became
established in China 65 A. D. The Græco-Bactrians accepted it with the
Scythian dynasty that succeeded them. It was carried to Thibet,
Afghanistan and to the Caspian.

247 B. C. Asoka of the non-Aryan race, the grandson of Chandra Gupta,
supported many Buddhist priests, 64,000 in number. He founded many
religious houses. He did for Buddhism what Constantine did for
Christianity. He corrected the heresies of evil men who had taken upon
themselves the yellow robe of Buddha, without the life. Britannica says
that Buddhism has won greater triumphs in its exile than it could have
achieved in the land of its birth. It has created a religion and
literature for more than one-third of the human race, and has profoundly
affected the beliefs of the rest. Five hundred million men still follow
the teachings of Buddha.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

\[paragraph continues\] His shrines and monasteries stretch in a
continuous line from the Caspian to the Pacific and still extend from
the confines of the Russian empire to the [equatorial](errata.htm#156.md)
archipelago. The most reliable of the books of Buddha are written in
Pali, a dialect direct from the Old Race. It is not surprising that
teachings so high and earnest should have met with eager acceptance by a
people as intensely religious as the Hindu. 400 A. D. Buddhism was still
flourishing over a large. area in India. In the ninth and tenth
centuries a great persecution arose and Buddhists were utterly
exterminated. For two centuries Brahmins had been gaining the upper
hand.

Brahminism and Buddhism had lived side by side from 250 B. C. till about
900 A. D. Modern Hinduism is but the product of both. 400 A. D. temples
of the two faiths could be found side by side. Fah Hian, traveling in
India saw many Brahmins in their idol temples. He found Buddhist monks
maintained at public expense. He carried back revised copies of the
Buddhist scriptures to his brethren in China. He saw Buddhist hospitals
where the crippled, destitute, and diseased were attended by physicians
and supplied with medicines and food until relieved. There was a huge
[monastery](errata.htm#157.md) of Buddhists at Nalanda, the ruins of which
are still to be seen. It was a vast university where a thousand Buddhist
monks and novices were lodged and supplied with every necessity. Towers
and domes rose and pavilions were to be seen amidst a paradise of trees,
gardens and fountains. There were six large ranges

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

of buildings, four stories high, as well as a hundred lecture rooms.
Food, bed, and vestments were furnished free. They were thus enabled to
devote their whole lives to the acquisition of learning. They studied
the sacred books of all religions and all sciences especially arithmetic
and medicine. The people of India became gentle, honest and just. There
was no capital punishment.

Many miraculous stories grew up around the life and death of Buddha.
Great festivals were held in which the monarch stripped off his jewels
and royal raiment and handed them to bystanders in imitation of the
great renunciation of Buddha. In the architecture of India, the Pagoda
is the symbol of Buddhism. It is one massive solid structure of an
elongated bell shape. The highest part is usually covered with precious
metal. The Schway Dagon is 370 feet high on an artificial mound of 170
feet. Its top is mostly of solid gold incrusted with precious stones. It
is surrounded with numberless shrines or temples every one of which
holds an image of the Great Buddha. The shrines are built of marble,
richly carved teak, or glass mosaics, every one trying to excel the
other in delicate charm. In each are sweet little bells which upon the
winds blowing, ring gentle peals of sacred music to the great founder of
the faith. In Mandelay, Burmah is an immense brazen statute of Buddha.
The devout among his believers gild the image with leaf gold. At least a
dozen men and women can be seen at any time thus expressing their
devotion. Here

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Brahma holds no sway. Here the women, modest and
self-respecting possess equality with men.

Brahminism claims to be founded upon the Vedas, the sacred books of
India, taken over by the Brahmins. They were not the creators of the
writings, though today they are the custodians,
[interpretors](errata.htm#158.md) and priests. They only attained this
place after a bloody struggle with the native races. Upon the
suppression of Buddhism a line of apostles of Brahminism appeared, with
a philosophy built upon the peculiar mystic, ascetic, teachings of
Buddha. A mass of Hindu legends sprang up around them. Some were born of
virgins, others overcame lions, others raised the dead. When hands and
feet were cut off they sprouted again; while the earth opened up and
swallowed their slanderers. In Brahminism, Brahma was the first person
of the trinity. He was the creator. Vishnu was the preserver and the
abominable Siva, the destroyer. Brahma who was at first the most exalted
sunk into the background and today Vishnu and Siva form the two
worshipped deities of India. Though Siva was revered in a philosophical
way by the Brahmins, he is worshipped with the most degrading rites by
the masses of India. In the image of Siva of the Grotto of Elephante
obscenity is displayed that surpasses anything that depravity can
imagine.

Buddha and Siva were two hostile sects, Heeren tells us emphatically
that in the [Phallic](errata.htm#159.md) emblems and the female
counterpart, there are no evidences of grossness. In one place Vishnu is
represented as a servant of Buddha. The Brahmins

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

attempted to incorporate the pure worship of Buddha into their religion
by making him an incarnation of Vishnu. As time went on Brahmins added
to and corrupted the Vedas to confirm their excessive
[pretensions](errata.htm#160.md). Brahmanism is full of elements foreign to
the Aryas. It worships gods that they did not bring into India and the
traditions are borrowed from the darker race. Brahminism as a power came
in by political changes about 700 A. D. Dr. Stevenson declares that
wherever Brahmins found a god whom it was politic to reverence they made
him one of their own. Later Brahmins tried to conciliate and absorb
everything. Their religion was not pure or attractive enough to supplant
Buddhism fairly, so they destroyed, revised and interpolated the
historical books of India, suppressing its real religious history. "Thus
we find two strains running through the Vedas, one pure and devotional
in the other," Barnett says, are bursts of filthy
[obscenity](errata.htm#161.md), a mass of vulgar superstitions and magic
rites enwrapping almost every function of life."

High in the Himalayas in an eastern direction from Bramaputra of Thibet
the original seat of the Brahmins was found in 1807. There were seven
hundred cities. Here the predominant sect is Siva, showing that this
abominable god had a [Mongol](errata.htm#162.md) origin. This is the
birthplace of a people who came down into the India plains to bring
their faith, which in the seven hundredth year of the Christian Era
gained the upper hand. The cruel nature or Brahmic law reveals their
Tartar origin. By torture they forced Brahminism upon

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

the Indian Cushites. They punished theft by the cutting off of hands and
feet. One who defamed the Brahmins or the caste spirit they sought to
force upon the people had his tongue torn out, red hot irons thrust into
his mouth, or the lips cut off. (*Antiquities of India*, Barnett, p.
116, 122.) Under their law the husband could whip or kill his wife and
confiscate her property. The polyandry of the Malay tribes of Thibet was
among them where brothers had a common wife. The burning of the widow on
the funeral pyre persisted down to modern times. Time has treated the
Brahmin roughly. He had a better start than any other Hindu, he
appropriated learning ready made, but he made but little of the great
chance. He has been too proud and self centered. The Brahmin has the
proud conviction of superiority depicted in every muscle of his face.
His is not the nature that could have created the wonderful literature
of India. Pride is manifested in every movement of his body. Though he
is in possession of the richest literature and the deepest philosophy of
the ages, he adds nothing to the solution of India's bitter problems
today. We must look to Ghandi and the masses for that. Brahmins added
fictions to the great Indian epic poem Maha Bharata to satisfy their
hatred of the Buddhists. Some modern books claim that Buddha belonged to
the Aryas but history proves the Brahmins to have been the hostile sect
that drove Buddhism from India. Buddha could not have been Turanian.
Heeren says, "This god is easily known by his

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

woolly hair and long ears as he sits cross-legged." So we see him in the
great temple dedicated to him at Kinnery. Brahmins in the altered
literature represented the heads of Buddhist monasteries as monsters and
the charioteer, whom the priests envied were represented as lowborn
carters and wagoneers.

Barnett speaking of the Aryas or Brahmins in their beginning says of
them that, whatever was their inception, their race was very
quarrelsome. They brought no women with them to India but took Dravidian
wives. They established themselves in the midlands and here amidst Aryas
mixed with Cushite blood the Vedas developed their classic culture.
Sanskrit was the language in which it was written because it was the
tongue of the predominent race. In the Vedas we find but a very
rudimentary knowledge of astronomy. Their enlightenment on medicine is
very obscure and mixed with sorcery. History and geography, says
Barnett, were left solely to the [imagination](errata.htm#163.md). Vedic
society was [patriarchal](errata.htm#164.md) or masculine, the Cushite life
[matriarchal](errata.htm#165.md). In the Vedas were tales of endless
blood-feuds, capital punishment, roasting alive, drowning, trampling by
elephants, devouring by dogs, tearing in pieces, impalement and other
horrors that sound more like the Assyrian cruelties of a later age or
Hunnish atrocities, rather than the deeds and customs of the noble
Indo-European race in its beginning. The Rig-Veda written not later than
1000 B. C. represents a civilization similar to the Iliad. Both
represent a society moulded by foreign invasion, a race of

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

stalwart strangers, strong in culture and armour, of the late bronze and
early iron ages, descending upon a darker, weaker people, subjecting
them and mixing blood and culture.

Leaving the enigma of the origin and meaning of the Rig-Veda, we come to
the two allegorical poems, the Ramayana and the Maha
[Bharata](errata.htm#166.md), which eclipse anything in Sanskrit. The
Ramayana is very ancient. It represents a culture and ideals very
different from the early Vedas. It is an allegory in which good triumphs
over evil. It begins with the description of a city founded by Manu
(Menes), first sovereign of mankind. The streets are full of merchants,
elephants, horses and chariots, beautiful temples and palaces decorated
with precious stones, incense and flowers. No covetous person was there,
no liar, deceiver, or evil disposition. This poem is uncontaminated with
foreign alloy. It is a picture of Hindu life prior to 1000 B. C. It is
also a picture of Cushite civilization at that age. It is the story of
the deeds of primitive heroes. The poem contains 24,000 verses and is
divided into seven books. It was written about 500 B. C. Another Hindu
book is the Code of Manu, dating 1000 B. C. It regulated the moral and
social life. The Maha Bharata is 240,000 lines, the, longest epic poem
ever written, being eight times as long as the Iliad and
[Odyssey](errata.htm#167.md) put together. The sacred books of Buddha
contain five times as much matter as the Old and New Testaments
combined.

The Rig-Veda is composed of songs of praise, prayers and commandments.
They sprang from

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

an [imaginative](errata.htm#168.md) and creative, as well as serious and
thoughtful people. Much of the grossness found in these writings cannot
be attributed to the creators but to the interpolations of the Brahmins.
The Puranas, the Fifth Veda, consists of prehistoric legends. With the
voluminous additions of the Brahmins, they have become a kind of
encyclopedia of general knowledge. They are based upon older books of
less extended scope. None of them are older than 1000 B. C. The Jains,
wealthy southern Dravidians, an offshoot from Buddhism, accuse the
Brahmins of destroying the real historical books of India, wherever they
gained ascendency. They assert that the Puranas were formerly historical
books-and that some of the divine heroes were merely kings of Oude. As
Buddhism declined Jainism grew in southern India. Heeren tells us that
the mythology of the Indian Bacchus (Dionysus), son of Cush, seems to
have been transformed by the Brahmins into Brahma. Siva one of the great
gods of the religion does not appear in the Veda as a god but is simply
an invention of the Brahmins. Buddha-Gautema denied the claims of the
Brahmins that they were the divinely appointed teachers or sacred
knowledge.

The literature of India is vast beyond all comprehension. The library of
one of its kings was so huge that it required a hundred Brahmins to
carry it front place to place. Sanskrit is supposed to bear the closest
resemblance to the primitive language. Its writings have furnished a
storehouse for the rest of the world. The Vedas,

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

as the Homeric poems, and the folk lore of western Europe, were probably
sung and recited for hundreds of years before they were committed to
writing. Sanskrit has not been a living [language](errata.htm#169.md) since
200 B. C. The rising supremacy of the Brahmins must have hastened its
decay. Had it been their language it would have come over into the
Christian Era. It is a carefully constructed tongue and very
symmetrical. Great masses of the literature are in meter. Indian
jurisprudence is a standing proof of the ancient moral and intellectual
refinement of the people. It has striking similarity to German and
Jewish law. All of these nations were in close contact with ancient
Cushite law. The poetry of India reveals the high moral status of the
female sex. A deep feeling of tenderness and regard for woman is
invariably represented.

The Epic narrative of the Hindu poems, bears great resemblance to the
Homeric stories, yet in subject and prevailing tone, they are more
gigantic. They are full of tenderness and female charm, like the mass
element of India that was once Buddhist. The poems describe their
character and relations with women as pure and noble. The great poems
are [pervaded](errata.htm#170.md) by a most subtle philosophy and their
history of metaphysics extends back into the mythical ages and cannot be
attributed to the creation of the Brahmitical mind, which dominated and
appropriated far down to our era. The first system of philosophy is
founded upon nature, the second upon the psychic self, the third upon
the revelations of the Vedas. Of

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

the different systems of philosophy, the Vedanta was founded by the
author of the Maha Bharata, which is from the Cushite element. The
Sanchya philosophy gave the highest place to nature and seems
[atheistic](errata.htm#171.md). It reveals absorption of thought in the
deity as necessary to the gaining of miraculous power. The Yoga system
of philosophy teaches complete union of thought and faculty with God. It
leads to hermitage. Buddha was the author of the Nyaya system of
philosophy. It was logical, dialectic or the
[metaphysics](errata.htm#172.md) of logical science. He taught that this
vain world was but an illusion and that our personality must be absorbed
in the god-head

In grammatical structure the language of India is absolutely similar to
Greek and Latin in the minutest particulars, only Sanskrit is far richer
and more varied. The sacred books of Buddha were written in Palli, the
language of native India. If we examine the language of Persia, we find
no relation between it and Sanskrit, yet we are led to believe by
linguists that Sanskrit with its roots common to the nations of western
Europe, passed across Asia with succeeding emigrations of Aryans. "It is
impossible to acknowledge the indebtedness of western literature to the
literary thought of India. We have borrowed from every department, but
nowhere have we found richer treasures than in its romances and fairy
tales. Stories written in far away India have been the favorites of the
story tellers of the world. Many of the fairy tales like Cinderella were
written to delight some Hindu child. India

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

is rich in literary as well as material treasures and we are far richer
for having borrowed from them." <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)
Grammar seems to have had a special fascination for the Hindu. The
oldest extant grammar dates from 300 B. C. In mathematics and astronomy
they have greatly distinguished themselves.
