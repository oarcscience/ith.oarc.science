# CHAPTER IV.

### THE AMAZING CIVILIZATION OF ETHIOPIA.

At the beginning of the historical period of Egypt most inhabitants of
the earth were rude savages. In western Europe and northern Asia the
half-human Neanderthal lived in eaves under overhanging ledges and fed
upon the untamed products of the wild. Outside of Africa, we find over
the earth the rude stone tools of the first barbaric inhabitants, that
mark the evolution of these races, from savagery, through long stages of
development to the civilized state. In Africa we mud no evidences of
this slow progress of man up from the barbaric state. The Soudan shows
no evidence of a stone age. The African seems to have passed directly to
the use of metals without intermediate steps. The Semitic and Japhetic
races upon the more sterile lands of the east, and north, as nomadic
shepherds, were slow to change to the more settled life, that developed
naturally in the rich regions of Egypt and the Upper Nile. Without
agriculture they could not advance to the handicraft stage. Going back
only three thousand years we find these nations still very ignorant.
Semites made no showings of culture until the rise of half barbarous
Assyria, which copied its arts and sciences from Cushite

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

Chaldea. The Hebrews learned agriculture and building from the Hamitic
race of Canaan.

Some one civilized race of prehistoric times had tamed the domestic
animals; for when the curtain of history was raised we find them in
attendance upon man. With the same infinite patience, this race
developed wild plants into tamed fruits and cereals. The Cushite was the
only race that could have performed this service, for the other races in
historic times despised agriculture. Nomadic races are fierce and
impatient, they have a nature the opposite to habits that make for
patient and perseverence, which are the steps to art and literature.
Before the dawn of history Cushites were working in metals and they had
perfected the tools with which we conquer the forces of nature today.
Our masons tools are identical with those unearthed in Egypt. Joly calls
the three significant factors of progress in the life of man: the
hearth, the altar and the forge. All three of these were given to the
world by the African. The ancients said that Ethiopians first taught
them the worship of the gods and sacrifice. The agricultural Ethiopian
developed the idea of a settled hearth and home. He developed very early
the art of smelting iron, which is found in the pyramids and gave
knowledge of its manufacture to the world.

Donnelly points out that in the thousands of years since the
domestication of animals, the historic nations of our times have tamed
one bird. In the light of these facts, is it helpful to our development,
that we blazen forth the boast that

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

from later races has come the sum total of civilization? Ancient
Africans yoked the wild ox, tamed the cow, the horse and sheep. This is
why animals play such an important part in the old Cushite mythology.
Africans subdued the elephant as early as the Cushites of Asia. Ancient
sculptures show the African lion tamed. These indefatigable men
domesticated wheat, barley, oats, rye and rice, in fact all the staple
plants of our civilization were fully developed so far back in the
distant ages, that their wild species have disappeared.

Think how helpless we would be today without them. Reclus declares, "We
are indebted to the African for sorghum, dates, kaffir, coffee and the
banana, also for the dog, cat, pig, ferret, ass and perhaps for the
goat, sheep and ox. The first African explorers, found the country
covered with cattle parks, in which the natives kept thousands and tens
of thousands of cattle of remarkable breeds, rare skill being shown in
their handling.

A [botanist](errata.htm#13.md) of the, Smithsonian Institute recently
traveled nine thousand miles through Africa, finding species from which
valuable grasses, grains, forage, and fruit may be obtained. We are
still reaping the fruits of the earlier zeal and genius that tamed the
first plants. Ancient Ethiopians were wonderful agriculturalists. The
melon and sweet potato produced there are far more delicious than ours.
The races to which agriculture was not native present the spectacle
today of crowding their populations into cities.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

Ethiopians developed long staple cotton, millet, kaffir and Soudan
grass. The, unusual size and flavor of African fruits were not the
result of accident but of labored perseverance and skill. Primeval man
gave us the gift of language. Myers says, "Rich and copious languages
were. upon the lips of the great peoples of antiquity, when they first
appear in the morning light of history." This was of incalculable value
to succeeding ages. They also gave us the alphabet. Baldwin affirms that
the writings used by the peoples of the first ages of history were all
derived from a common source. The Phoenicians said the art was invented
by Taut.

The primitive worship of the Ethiopians was pure. They worshipped one
supreme being. Their rulers were priest-kings and at death were deified.
As the ages ensued this extended itself in ancestor worship, which was
original with the Cushite race. It flourishes on the African continent
today. Ancestor worship spread over all the countries Which the Cushites
conquered. Frobenius, the great anthropologist, says, "Ethiopia is an
ancient classical land. In olden days its inhabitants were considered
the most pious and oldest of mankind. In many quarters Meroe is thought
to be indebted to primitive Egypt. From a standpoint of ethnology, we
must unhesitatingly reject this supposition. The Nubians possessed an
independent and individual religion in the earliest known times, the
cult of which impressed the Egyptians, who gave an account of it to the,
authors of old." (*Voice of Africa*. Vol. II p. 621)

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

Champollion, the father of Egyptology, in his valuable memoirs declared,
that the Lower Valley of the Nile was originally peopled from Abyssinia
and Meroe. The most ancient cities that they founded were Thebes and
Edfou. In the beginning Egypt was ruled by priest-kings, who reigned in
the name of some deity. This sacerdotal class were overthrown by the
warrior caste, whose chiefs raised themselves to the rank of kings. This
new establishment of power took place about 2000 B, C. Thebes under them
reached the height of her glory. The Old Race of the first dynasties,
the race of Thot, Amen-Ra and Osiris had turned its greatest strength in
wider and wider circles across North Africa and up the coast of western
Europe. To the eastward they had civilized the Mesopotamian plains and
had swept on to India. Their relation toward Egypt became, more and more
hostile, though full blooded Ethiopians still sat upon the throne. The
idols of Egypt to the last detail were gods of Meroe.

Heeren says, "The best informed travelers and the most accurate
observers recognize the same color, features and mostly the same
fashions and weapons in the inhabitants of the Upper Nile as they find
portrayed on the Egyptian monuments. The race which we now discover in
the Nubian, though by loss of liberty and religion much degenerated;
yet, which was once the ruling race in Egypt. This Nubian race did not
come from Arabia. Their color, language and manner of life were
different. According to their own

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

traditions the Egyptians were originally savages without tillage or
government. They lived in huts made of reeds. A race of different
descent and color settled among them and lifted them to civilization.
The men of this race were the ancestors of the Nubians, who planted
other colonies in opposite regions of the world, in Greece, Colchis,
Babylonia, and even India." All of these regions had priest-kings.

There had been a rich literature in ancient Ethiopia, which endured
until the time of Christ. There are now in existence more than two
thousand Ethiopian manuscripts. The early Christian missionaries who
entered Ethiopia considered it a duty to destroy all the ancient pagan
literature. The two thousand extant are but a remnant of olden writings,
which if in the possession of me world today would unfold many a
baffling mystery. The literature of Ethiopia that remains is almost
wholly Christian. Nubia long resisted the inroads of foreigners. The
Barabra knew what the entrance of aliens would mean to their land, but
its confiscation and violence to their rights. Nubians mothers would
drown or mutilate their daughters, that they could not carry away, to
save them from dishonor. Virtue is highly prized among them today.
Frobenius tells us that Nubians adopted Christianity as early as 500 A.
D. Determinedly for a thousand years they refused to accept Mohammedism.
When Islam began to persecute the Christians in Egypt, Nubia sent her
cry, "Stay your hand," ringing down the

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Nile with both energy and effect. The Arab
spared Egypt for fear of the Nubian.

The Barabra or Nubian hated the Turk and the Arab and were right in
their determination not to let them enter their land, Which was blooming
and prosperous but which later came to utter ruin. Sir Samuel Baker
describing the Nile between Berber and Karthum said, that as late as
1862 the banks were crowded with populous villages. The land everywhere
was cultivated and produced heavy crops. Under the Turks in thirty years
it had become a howling wilderness. Gaps in the bank show where wheels
once stood, which have entirely disappeared. Their channels have been
choked for years. Budge paints a pathetic picture of the few inhabitants
who remain, who are nearly naked and slowly starve for months. They lack
sufficient covering at night, the cold being intense. These Nubians get
up long before dawn and sit shivering, waiting for the needed warmth of
the sun. They love their independence and are content to endure
hardship.

700 A. D. Moslem Arabs overran the Delta and transformed the old Retu
type of Egyptian into an Arab speaking fellahin. The old Egyptian
intermixed with Greeks, Romans and Arabs, produced a physical type quite
unlike the people of earlier days. Along the Nubian Nile ancient
prestige prevented their onrush. The old Ethiopian empire with its
northern and southern capitals, blocked Moslem progress for almost a
thousand years. In 1316, this Christian kingdom was overthrown but the
race loving Nubian peasantry

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

clung to and still retain their Hamitic speech, which is the key to
their origin. After 1300 A. D. massacre was introduced to compel the
Nubian to change his faith. Slave raiding brought inconceivable ruin.
"Four-fifth of the population was destroyed and the greater part of this
once best cultivated region of the world went back to wilderness. The
cattle were killed, the young men slain, and the daughters of Ethiopia
ravished."

A look at Ethiopia today in her ruined condition, makes it difficult for
the average observer to receive the deductions of explorers, geologists
and ethnologists. The great lapse of time has erased traces of a
civilization that was decaying in the days of Cambyses. Many of the
massive ruins and relics of those declining days as described in books
are conceived by the readers to be products of the lower Nile, When they
existed far up in Nubia. The museums of the world contain much of
Ethiopian art that is labeled as Egyptian. Ferlini in 1820 found in the
tomb of the Great Queen of Meroe, a bronze vessel, the handles of which
were ornamented with Dionysus masks, also necklaces, bracelets, rings
and other articles of jewelry. Dionysus was the Bacchus of the Greeks,
the Osiris of Egypt and a very famous ruler of the ancient Cushite
empire of Ethiopians. These jewels and the bronze jar are in the museum
at Munich. Ferlini was greatly surprised at the workmanship, which he
considered finer than any to which the Greeks had attained. (*Egyptian
Soudan*--Budge.)

In 1863, Marriette discovered at Jebel Barkal

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

among the monuments, five columns of the highest importance, proving
Ethiopia to have had a very important position among the Egyptian
dynasties, in later historical times. These Ethiopian kings residing in
Nubia ruled Egypt. One of these [conquerors](errata.htm#14.md), Takarka
carried his expeditions into Asia. He was doing no more than Ethiopians
of earlier ages had done. European museums contain some of the monuments
of Jebel Barkal. Groups of pyramids are near the temple. In twenty-five
structures at Nuri in interior vaults is a method of support, until
recently thought to be an Etruscan invention. At the time of the Old
Empire the population of Upper Egypt was Nubian. In the Sixth Dynasty
Nubia was a part of the Egyptian Kingdom. In the inscriptions of
Ethiopia the ruler is called "King of the Two Lands" and the symbol of
the Uraei proves their authority over Egypt and Ethiopia. The pyramids
of the Queens of Meroe show the authority of this line over the Two
Lands. This was why Egyptian monarchs so often married princesses of
Ethiopia. It seemed to strengthen their claim to the throne.

Late excavations of Harvard University in old Ethiopia have unearthed at
Napata a royal [cemetery](errata.htm#15.md) more than two thousand years
old. At Nuri they examined the tombs of twenty kings and twenty-five
queens of Ethiopia from 660 B. C. to 250 B. C. The line of Candace was
highly honored in Ethiopia. Their jewelry was very elaborate and purely
Merotic in style and workmanship. At the feet of the Great Queen were
the gods of

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

the north and south tying the two lands together. The two lands that in
their beginning had been one. The symbolic representation of the union
of the north and south is found at a very early period in Egypt. Her
Pharaohs bearing the title, King of the Two Lands. Hoskins infinitely
preferred the pyramids of Meroe for their elegance of architectural
effect to those of Gezeh. He viewed the ruins of Meroe as the last
architectural efforts of a people whose greatness had passed away. These
rulers were fully Ethiopian in feature and hair. In their titles was the
name Amen-Ra.

Some of the largest temples of Nubia were built by this line of kings
and queens. The power of Tarkaka and Pankhi who subjugated Egypt is
attested by the sculptured reliefs of the scenes of their battles. In
XXII Dynasty of Egypt, the country having become so intermingled with
foreign blood, the main body of the priests of Amen, who had ruled so
long at Thebes, emigrated into Ethiopia. Favors shown foreigners so
displeased the military class that they deserted in a body to Ethiopia,
240,000 soldiers. Pharaoh made overtures to them but they would not
return. These were the former ruling class of Egypt returning to the
land and culture from which they had originated.

The term Nubia was unknown to the ancients. Everything south of Egypt
was called Ethiopia, the land of the dark races. Though the local
traffic is small, a very large caravan trade still passes through Nubia
between Central Africa

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

and Egypt. The Nuba tribes of Kordofan seem to constitute the original
stock. The Nile Nubas are closely allied to the Nubas of Kordofan who
are admittedly, says Britannica (Vol. XVII. Nubia.), of Negro stock and
speech, so the Nile Nubas must be regarded as essentially a Negro
people. The Nile above Egypt has always hen occupied by this people.
Many Nubians are artizans, small dealers, porters and soldiers in Egypt
where they are noted for their honesty and cheerful and frank
temperaments. The native tongue is very sonorous and expressive. It is
of distinctly Negro character. These Barbarians in Nubia are labored
agriculturists, faithful, obedient, cleanly and Keane insists that
nearly all of them understand arithmetic and know how to read and write.

Many Nubians recall the Retu type upon the Egyptian monuments. These
people of old Ethiopia wear today the plaited turned up beard of the
Egyptian gods and a style seen in Etruscan sculptures. Amen-Ra, from
whom a long line of Egyptian monarchs descended, was an Ethiopian god.
He was the most terrible of the Egyptian gods to look upon, with his
blue-black complexion. Ancient Egyptians were so determined to represent
him as black that they produced a singular black effect by laying on a
dead black color and treating it with blue through which the black
remained visible. The Soudan in those ancient days was considered as but
a continuation of Egypt. The greatest of the Soudanese gods ranked with
the Egyptian gods. Thotmes III of Egypt called

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

himself royal son of the land of the south. His son, Amenhotep, appears
on the reliefs of the temple of Thelmes making offerings to the Nubian
gods.

Reclus tells us that at Dongola, the capital of Nubia, is the ruin of
one of the largest and finest specimens of ancient architecture. The
columns are as elegant as those of Greek temples. The crests of the
neighboring rocks are crowned with towers and strongholds and walls of
ancient entrenched camps. Nubian castles differ but little from those of
the Rhine. They were both built by the descendants of the Cushite dolmen
builders. These Nubian castles are the remnants of a feudal system
similar to that of Europe. This system is still alive in Abyssinia
today. In the Nubian castles the battlements, keeps and roofs are all
broader at the base than at the summit and all the towers are conical.
[Ramses](errata.htm#16.md) II built wonderful temples in Nubia, the rock
hewn temple of Abu Simbel for simple grandeur and majesty is second to
none in all Egypt. He built another temple to Amen-Ra at Napata. The
Harvard expedition found the ancient Ethiopian kingdom had been called
Seba or Sheba. It was that part of the empire from which the Queen of
Sheba had come with rich gifts to Solomon. Josephus, the Jewish
historian called her a queen of Egypt and Ethiopia. This was in the ages
when Egypt probably was the Two Lands.
