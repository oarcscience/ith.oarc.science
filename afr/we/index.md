This is a pioneering, long-lost, work of Afrocentric history. Drusilla
Dunjee Houston, (1876-1941) was a teacher, journalist and self-taught
historian. Inspired by W.E.B. DuBois' The Negro, Houston undertook a
life-long quest to discover African history from an African-American
perspective. Today it is clear that conventional historians' fixation on
'Dead White Men' misses huge parts of the historical picture. Africa had
several advanced civilizations in antiquity which flourished at the same
time as the better known European and Asian ones. However, at the time
that Houston wrote, history was viewed through a Eurocentric perspective
and any mention of advanced African cultures was considered on a par
with Atlantis.

Houston believed the Cushite civilization to be the motherland of
humanity. The Cushite civilization did exist, although it was not as
ancient as Egypt, and certainly not the origin of all culture.
Nevertheless, the Cushites were the earliest known Black African
civilization. Reaching its peak between 1750 and 1500 B.C.E., and
lasting until the fourth century C.E., the Cushite empire occupied what
is now the Sudan, with its capital at Meroe on the Nile. At their high
point, Cushites even conquered and ruled ancient Egypt from 750-650
B.C.E. Because of their geographical isolation, they had nowhere near
the impact on other parts of the world that Houston attributed them. The
Cushites were heavily influenced by the older Egypt culture, rather than
the other way around. They left behind fields of hundreds of small
steep-angled burial pyramids, the design of which was borrowed from
Egypt and scaled down.

Houston wrote three volumes, of which only this one, the first, known as
Wonderful Ethiopians, was published. She had no staff, and no formal
training in academic procedures. Living in Oklahoma, her access to
specialized libraries was limited. One can only wonder what she would
have made of Google. Although Houston identifies many of her sources in
the body of the text, there are few footnotes or other apparatus that
such a bold theory would require for consideration. The writing is
vigorous and popularized, which also makes it a difficult sell for
historians. The received text of this book could have used a bit of
proofing and editing (refer to [errata](errata.md)

), but given the circumstances under which it was published, this is
understandable. The compelling part of this book is that it exists at
all. While we debate her theories, one historical fact is fairly clear:
Houston left her own mark as a pioneering advocate of the study of Black
History.
