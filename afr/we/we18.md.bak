# CHAPTER XIV.

### ANCIENT INDIA THE LAND OF MYSTERY.

India has always been a land of mystery. The facts of her beginning and
the origin of her culture have been the subject of much contradiction.
Some would pronounce her a land of late development and that her rock
hewn temples and hoary monuments were built after the beginning of the
Christian era. Rawlinson says of the early founders of Indian
civilization, "Recent linguistic discoveries show that a Cushite race
did in the earliest times extend itself along the southern shores of the
continents from Abyssinia to India. The whole peninsula of India, the
sea coast of Beluchistan and Kerman by the inscriptions belonged to this
race." Wilford who had an extended and thorough knowledge of Hindu
mythology points out that the Sanskrit writings describe the extended
domains of the ancient Cushite empire. In these books are relations
about early Egyptian history. It mentioned one of the emigrations going
out from the Upper Nile as having peopled India. The Puranas divided the
world into seven dwipas or divisions. Sancha Dwipa was Africa in
general. Cusha Dwipa was the land of Cush, India and the Mediterranean.
These books speak

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

place to another with perfect security to themselves and their
merchandise.

Alexander the Great found the natives of India not living under a
monarchial system, but in republics. From very ancient times there had
been indirect trade between India and the Mediterranean but it was with
the Ægean civilization that had preceeded the historic Greek and of
which Greece had no record. Alexander found that Nysa had a senate of
three hundred members. Many of these republics were very powerful and
warlike, opposing Alexander as he had scarcely been resisted anywhere
else. His victories were purchased at vast price of blood. Walls and
ramparts encircled their cities. Their encampments were protected by
triple lines of military wagons and cars. They had boats and vessels.
One of the temple reliefs represents the fore part of a vessel filled
with strangers. In Multan, in Malle and Oxydracae, nearer the Ganges,
there were still more powerful nations. (Ibid. V, 23-24.) At Sangola
thousands perished. Many tribes deserted their cities preferring exile
to subjugation. The reports of the mighty armies of the native Parsii,
the modern Bengal, and Oude, so terrified the hitherto unconquered
Macedonians that they retreated. (*Historical Researches in the Nations
of Antiquity*, Heeren, Vol. I, p. 319.) How different is this report by
a careful student of the records of the past, to what we read in the
hastily written volumes of today.

*Buddhist India*, by Rhys-Davids gives a clear and interesting picture
of the communal system

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

of India. The villages consist of houses all built together, separated
by narrow lanes. Immediately adjoining is the sacred grove or primeval
forest, left standing when the first clearing was made. Beyond is the
wide expanse of cultivated fields. There are grazing grounds for cattle
and jungle where every villager has the equal right of wood and waste.
The cattle belonged severally to the householders of the village. After
crops they roam the fields under the charge of herdsmen hired
collectively and a man skilled in cattle care. The fields are all
cultivated at the same time. Irrigation channels are laid out by the
community. The supply of water is regulated by rule under the
supervision of head men. There is a common fence. The great fields are
divided into plots corresponding to the heads of the families in each
village. Each family takes the produce of its share." Compare our system
of monster bonds to make community improvements, that after
multitudinous shavings bring us back meager results, with this communal
system of co-operation which brought almost perfect results with little
expenditure.

In India it is impossible for a shareholder to mortgage his part of the
village field without the consent of the village council. No individual
hat the right of bequest. All such matters were settled by the general
sense of the community as to what was right and proper. The
superintendence of the estate fell to the elder son. Women had personal
property and daughters could inherit from their mothers. They had no
need of a

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

separate share of the land for they were supported from the produce
falling to husbands or brothers. The villagers united of their own
accord to build motes, halls and rest houses. They followed the same
plan in building reservoirs, in road mending and park building. There
were no landlords and no paupers. There was little if any crime. The
people dwelt with open doors. These people occupied a social grade quite
above our village folk. They held it degradation to hire. These traits
are quite contrary to the nature of the races called Indo-European that
peopled western Europe. They were quite contrary to Turanian or Semitic
nature as it developed in Asia, but was the nature of Ethiopians and
from this foundation of communal life that they [laid](errata.htm#142.md)
in southern Europe, in early Chaldea and elsewhere, evolved the
foundation and ideals from which the democracies of our times were
developed.

It was by this simple system, as revealed in the communal districts of
India--which cannot function perfectly, because of the spirit of
exploitation and foreign rule--this system of cooperation, of the
Cushite race that built the wonderful temples, palaces and giant
engineering works of the past that today bewilder the beholder. The
basis of the wonderful [achievements](errata.htm#143.md) of Babylonia,
Egypt and Ethiopia was this communal system. It is for the results they
gained that we should weigh this system, seemingly impossible to us, for
its value. It was by their combined strength that they gained and held
world sovereignty for so many thousands of years.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

\[paragraph continues\] There are things in Cushite forms that would
relieve some of the insufferable miseries of today that are a reproach
to our civilization. The placing of every man upon an actual basis of
equality seems a thing impossible to our natures, though it is written
in our civil confessions of faith. Metcalf says, "These little village
communities are little republics, having everything they want within
themselves and almost independent of any foreign relations. They seem to
last when nothing else lasts. Dynasty after dynasty tumbles in India,
revolution succeeds revolution, the Mogul, Sikh, and English, all have
been master but the village communities remain the same."

Megathenes, the Greek ambassador to the court of a non-Aryan king about
300 B. C., gives us another picture of Indian Cushite life. He observed
with admiration the absence of slavery in India, the chastity of the
women and the courage of the men. In valor they excelled all other
Asiatics. They required no locks to their doors, above all no Indian was
ever known to tell a lie. They were sober and industrious, good farmers
and skillful artisans. They scarcely ever had recourse to a law suit and
lived peaceably under their native chiefs. The kingly government was
portrayed almost as described in Mann, with its hereditary caste of
councilors and soldiers. Husbandmen were exempt from war and public
service. These were worthy descendants of the "Blameless Ethiopians," of
old traditions. Though we are told that the Greeks and Hindu are kindred
the Hellenes were vary ignorant of

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

\[paragraph continues\] India prior to the expedition of Alexander. The
prehistoric Greek and the Hindu were both branches of the Old Race. The
native tribes which Megathenes found esteemed their constitution as an
inheritance from Dionysus, an ancient Cushite king. The names Nysa,
Malli, Nanda, and many other names of cities and nations are purely
African words, alive today in the Soudan.

Missionaries to India have, given further pictures of the working of the
communal system in the home. When a man and wife have reared a family,
the sons bring their wives to the paternal home to live together and
raise families in the common home of their father. The supreme authority
rests with this parent. The whole income goes into a common treasury.
There is no individual property. So loyal is the Hindu to paternal
authority that no question is ever raised by anyone as to obedience to
his commands. (We may scoff at such a system as impossible to
individualism and freedom but where is there any family of any
civilization that has succeeded by any other plan. Families that learn
to pull together soon rise to position or wealth. The tendency of our
civilization is toward a dangerous freedom that weakens and enslaves
us.) In India the weak, the sick and the feebleminded have the same
claim on the family resources as the others. His claim is universally
recognized by the race. No poorhouses are needed. The Hindu considers
this as his most cherished and ancient institution. He should be proud
of it, for it indeed

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

proves his humanity. They have a sublime conception of reverence for
parental authority and obligation to the ties of blood.

Jones tells us, that Buddhism has produced in India, a higher type of
womanhood than Brahminism; yet the women of no other land wield a
greater power than the much abused women of India. We are made to feel
by superficial observers of Hindu life, that the women of this race are
undervalued. This is misrepresentation. No woman on earth today reveals
a greater attachment for her husband. She allowed herself to be burned
upon the funeral pyre as a sublime exhibition of wifely devotion. So the
African wife for ages desired to pass on into the unknown with the mate.
In the narrow home sphere, in religion and the training of children, her
influence is supreme. The conversion of the husband to another faith
will not be permanent if the wife persists in the ancestral faith.
Millions of money is expended in the manufacture of female ornaments.
The Hindu expresses his love in this way to his bride. There are four
hundred thousand goldsmiths constantly employed. The wealth of the
family in the Middle Ages was largely measured by the amount of jewels
possessed by the women of the family. Hindu clothing is beautiful and
suited to the climate. The one-cloth of the Hindu women bright with
colors and deftly wound around her body is the most exquisitely
beautiful garment in the world.

Did the Indian race create anything in architecture? The ancient ruins
and remarkable

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

structural remains were built in ages remote from ours. A period long
before any Aryan, Scythian or Mohammedan invasion. They are the work of
the native races that inhabited India. The Brahmins only reached power
and overthrew Buddhism in the year 700 A. D. They took over the ancient
records and they themselves say that the ancient ruins were constructed
7000 years ago. This was coeval with the pyramids. They were both built
by the same race. Everything in these grottoes is of Indian character,
they belong to the time when India was under no foreign yoke. In Ellora,
Hindu mythology is shown in perfect development. In the rock in the
excavations of Elephante, we find a stone so hard that ordinary steel
cannot work it. The same hand that carved the rock of Egypt worked here.
The temple grotto, at Salsette, has inscriptions but the alphabet no one
has been able to decipher. This would all prove that these forms of
architecture had their origin from the primitive Cushite race of India.

All the scenes of the mythology on the walls of these ancient temples
are southern and do not represent any phase of the life of Aryans or
Turanians. Heeren, in *Asiatic Nations, The Indians* (Vol. III, p. 43),
tells us that in the carvings may be seen armies on elephants, never on
horses, which would disprove the 1000 A. D. theory of their building.
Their plan is simple yet grand. Ponderous roofs rest on seemingly
slender and inadequate supports. There are halls with roofs of solid
rock supported on massive piers, which

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

are richly carved with pictures and friezes. Painted reliefs and
numerous colossal animals enliven the temples. The inscriptions are in
Sanskrit. If this be true, then Sanskrit must have been the language of
the primitive race. Langles says, "If these structures were reared nine
hundred years ago, then Ethiopia alone could have furnished the
architects, for at that late date, the world had lost the art of carving
in granite." The plains around the Indian temples were once highly
cultivated but now are [impenetrable](errata.htm#144.md) jungle and the
lair of wild beasts. The topes of India prove the Hindu to have been
acquainted with both the pointed and circular arch, which were unknown
to both the Egyptians and Greeks.

Heeren describes Mavalipurian, a royal city, hewn out of the living
rock. A large part of this city had been engulfed by the sea. Immense
blocks of stone in [Cyclopean](errata.htm#145.md) style show that these
ruins must have been very ancient. They were built by the same race that
at that age in other parts of the world, in Phoenicia, in Arabia, in
Nubia, and in Egypt, left similar massive ruins. These Indian works were
built so long ago that the very recollection of their origin is lost.
The pagodas are pyramidal temples of [Cyclopean](errata.htm#146.md)
construction. The Brahmins must be right in their estimate of the age of
these ruins. Heeren thinks that nine hundred years ago, there were no
powerful princes that could have erected such stupendous monuments.
Bardesanes reported, that at the beginning of the Christian Era almost
two thousand years ago, Indian messengers said

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

that in a large grotto under a lofty hill is an image of Siva, half man
and half woman twelve ells high. At that day Elephante was completely
deserted, unused and as mysterious as now. Mohammedans destroyed all of
the ancient monuments of India and Heeren thinks we may be sure that
they borrowed from Indian architectural ideals. The Hindu far surpassed
Egypt and Greece in the richness of their ornamentation.

Maurice, that eminent authority on Indian antiquities, says, "One would
suppose that such astonishing works would have been called the eight
wonder of the world and would have a fixed place in any country as an
era never to be forgotten."

The presence of the image of Siva would give us the impression that
these temples might have come from beyond the deluge, for Siva worship
and its abominable rites were a part of the idolatrous religion for
which God destroyed the antediluvian world. The Tartar nations north of
India are addicted to the worship of this god and may justly be credited
with bringing it into India; for two streams of emigration have swept
into the peninsula, one from the northeast and the other from the
northwest. The rite polyandry, a wife having a number of husbands,
exists among these Tartars and we find this custom in India even among
Brahmins. The early Cushite worship was pure and included no part of
Siva worship that has prostituted the morals of a once pure race. Siva
worship must have been introduced by the Brahmins as it is one of the
chief deities of Brahminism. Nowhere in these ancient

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

ruins is there a temple dedicated to Brahma or Vishnu showing that
Turanians had nothing to do with the erection of the structures. The
rock temples of India were built at the same age as the building of the
Great Sphinx.

From 100 B. C. to 700 A. D. Indian civilization suffered from the
inroads of Tartars or Scythians. For five hundred years the native
dynasties waged war against them. The Greeks called these invaders Huns.
They were shepherds or herdsmen who roamed across the plains of central
Asia. It was from this element that the caste of Brahmins may have
sprung or from earlier invasions, for about 700 A. D. the Brahmins began
to gain the upper hand in India. The old religion of Buddhism was
falling to decay from age. Brahma's apostles having caught the central
gist of the life of Buddha began to invent varying philosophies upon the
central thought of Buddha's-self denial and restraint. A mass of
impossible miracles and divine incantations were fostered upon the
people. Siva worship was adopted in the national religion. With the
introduction of cremation came the burning of the widow on the funeral
pyre. Human sacrifice was incorporated. Krishna which means black was
taken out of the old cult and incorporated in Brahminism, anything to
insure the strengthening of the claim of the Brahmin to the priesthood.
Some sought to teach the equality of caste, others sought to establish a
religion of pleasure.

The Scythic invasions were followed by the Mohammedan conquest. In which
the idols of India

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

were broken and her treasures carried away. Mohammed died 632 A. D. One
hundred years after his death his followers had invaded Asia as far as
Hindu Kush. It took three hundred years more for them to be strong
enough to grasp at India. The first invaders were struck with wonder at
the despairing valor of the Hindus. One Rajput garrison preferred
extermination to submission. They raised a huge funeral pyre upon which
the women and children first threw themselves. The men having bathed,
took a solemn farewell of each other, and throwing open the gates,
rushed upon the weapons of the [besiegers](errata.htm#147.md) and perished
as a man. The difficulty of the Mohammedan entrance into India lay in
the daring of the Hindu tribes, for they did not enter easily as is
commonly supposed. Not only the Sind Rajputs but the kingdoms of the
lower Ganges from Bahar downward of non-Aryan extraction represented by
the Chers, Chola and Pandya dynasties made the conquest of India a very
tedious progress. The Hindu power in southern India was not fully broken
until 1565 A. D. At no time was Islam triumphant throughout all India.
Hindu dynasties always ruled over a large area. The Mogul empire was
fast falling into the hands of the Hindu when the English power fastened
itself upon this afflicted people.

The three ancient kingdoms of Chers, Chola and Pandya were of
Dravidians. They were Tamil speaking races. No European kingdom can
boast a continuous succession such as that of Pandya or Madura, traced
back by the piety of genealogists

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

for more than two thousand years. In the sections of India that were
conquered it was because these were essentially a creative and not a
naturally ferocious people. The Mohammedans stripped the temples of gold
and the idols of precious stones. The Tartar invasion of 1316 was
indescribable in its atrocities. From 1350 to 1550 A. D. the Dekan was a
theatre of war between the Hindu and the Mohammedans. Then began the
intermingling of Arabian and Indian blood, both of which were
foundationally Cushite. From this union of genius has risen the richest
architecture in the world. The Taj Mahal, the Indian Mohammedan temple
is perhaps the most beautiful edifice in the universe. It is described
as though it was conceived by Titans and finished by jewelers. Its
grandeur of conception and wonderful delicacy of workmanship enthralls
all. The visitor exclaims, "The half has never been told." The Taj is
the highest expression of art human affection has ever attained.

Akbar the Great was the founder of the Mogul dynasty. Mogul is the
Arabic word for Mongol. This empire lasted for one hundred and fifty
years. His grandfather had married a Rajput princess. His favorite wife
was of the old race. The tomb of Akbar the Great almost equals the Taj.
In this great mausoleum, the famous Kohinor diamond was exhibited for
years in the open air. Would this have been possible in our
civilization? The Shah of Persia in 1739 sacked the palace of the Moguls
and carried this diamond and other [fabulous](errata.htm#148.md) wealth
back to Persia. These vast treasures

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

seemed to convey a curse. This famous diamond passed into the hand of
Queen Victoria. The imperial grandeur of the Moguls arose from the
sacking of Hindu cities of the accumulated wealth of the ages. Their
display has probably never been surpassed. The temple of the Sikhs is
only fifty three feet square but it is largely covered with gold plate,
it is a beautiful object to behold. The Mohammedans though they left
wonderful [architectural](errata.htm#149.md) beauty did not seriously
change the undercurrents of the life of the people. The Hindu charge the
Mohammedans with compelling them to the necessity of secluding their
women, who before their invasion were free and independent. The
licentiousness of the Arab caused them to withdraw their women into the
home.

Modern literature places great emphasis upon the caste system of India.
Some books represent the seeming four castes as subdividing into as many
as 3000 castes. These cannot intermarry and most cannot eat together.
Each caste is supposed to keep to the same occupation. Though we read
this, in reality, the castes often change employment and lower ones rise
in the social scale. Vaisyas were once tillers of the soil, now they are
great merchants and bankers of India. The system of castes helped to
bring the crafts up to perfection. The famous manufacturers of medieval
India, its muslins, silk, cloth of gold, inlaid weapons, and exquisite
work in precious stones, were brought to perfection under the system of
casts or trade guilds. Such guilds may still be found in full force in
India today. These

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

in their organization prevent undue competition among the members and
each upholds the interest of its own body in any dispute arising among
craftsmen. Their trade disputes are settled and a stamped agreement
fixes the rate for the future. The trade guild charges a fee and acts as
an insurance society. (*History of the Nations, India-Persia*, p. 78.)

We may pass over to the west coast of Africa and we will find these same
trade guilds and clans that eat only with their caste and only certain
kinds of food. In India some are vegetarians, others eat beef. All of
this grew out of that African custom where a tribe is forbidden to eat
the animal that is its totem. Caste difference in India has no
[existence](errata.htm#150.md) because of color. Caste keeps Aryans in
Hindustan outside the pale as well as other aliens. Europeans delight in
calling themselves of the same race as the Persians, but Jones tells us
that the Parsee, driven from Persia twelve hundred years ago into India,
declined the other day to receive into their fold, the English bride of
one of their number. Caste delights in calling all foreigners unclean
wretches and teaches that contact with other races brings ceremonial
[pollution](errata.htm#151.md) and sin. Some of the native rulers have set
the time of audience with Englishmen at impossible hours, that the visit
might not take place. They look upon the Hindu who has crossed the ocean
into foreign lands and who has associated with us, as engulfed in
[pollution](errata.htm#152.md). In early Cushite days there were no child
marriages, prohibition of widow marriages and rite of suttee. These

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

abominations have been added in later ages by the Brahmins.

The Hindu of today lives in ages that have long gone by. The present to
him is an age of corruption with ones more deeply degraded to ensue. He
looks with contempt upon our modern scientific investigations and modern
haste. He feels that they do not add to real progress or to our
happiness. His life is introspective, dealing with the mystic. He
renounces outer attractions to seek communion with God. In early ages he
had evolved a subtle system of philosophy. He has developed a sixth
sense, which we of modern civilization cannot comprehend, 350 B. C. or
2350 years ago he had attained the same degree of civilization that is
his today. Jones declares, "the people of India are the most religious
upon the face of the earth. The Chinese and Japanese beside them are
worldly and prosaic." The Hindu are deeply spiritual. They are not
materialistic like the people of western nations. In India religion
enters every detail of life as it did in Egypt and old Ethiopia. In
remote ages, when our ancestors were in the depth of savagery, the Hindu
were [indulging](errata.htm#153.md) in metaphysical disquisitions, which
even today are admired by western sages. Many Hindu writings express
aspirations and yearnings so beautiful as to excite our highest
admiration.
