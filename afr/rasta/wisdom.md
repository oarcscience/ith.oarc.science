# The Wisdom of Rastafari

**PREFACE**

In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; we have a
strong city; salvation will Jah appoint for walls and bulwarks. Open ye
the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter
in. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee:
because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the Lord God Jah Rastafari for
ever: for the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.

For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lost city, he layeth
it low: he layeth it low; even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the
dust.

The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps
of the needy. The way of the just is uprightness; thou most upright,
dost weigh the path of the just. Yea, in the way of thy judgements, O
Lord, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is thy name, and
to the rememberance of thee.

With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea with my spirit within
me will I seek thee early; for when thy judgements are in the earth, the
inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.

LET FAVOUR BE SHOWN TO THE WICKED, YET WILL HE NOT LEARN RIGHTEOUSNESS;
IN THE LAND OF UPRIGHTNESS WILL HE DEAL UNJUSTLY, AND WILL IDIOT BEHOLD
THE MAJESTY OF THE LORD GOD JAH RASTAFARI.

selah, When thy hand is lifted up, they will not see, but they shall
see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people, yea, the fire of thine
enemies shall devour them.

Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou also hast wrought all our
works in us.

O Lord our God Jah Rastafari, other Lords besides thee have had dominion
over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. They are
dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise;
therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their
memory to perish.

Thou hast increased the nation, O Lord, thou hast increased the nation;
thou art glorified; thou hast removed it far unto all the ends of the
earth.

Jah, in trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer when
thy chastening was upon them. Like a woman with child, that draweth near
the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so
have we been in thy sight, O Lord.

WE HAVE BEEN WITH CHILD, WE HAVE BEEN IN PAIN, WE HAVE AS IT WERE
BROUGHT FORTH WIND; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth;
neither have the inhabitants of the World fallen.

Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise;
awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of
herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about
thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation
be overpast. For, behold the Lord, God Jah Rastafari, cometh out of his
place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the
earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.
ISAIAH 26

<span id="bible"></span> His Imperial Majesty  
HAILE SELASSIE I  
Emperor of Ethiopia, says:  

WE IN ETHIOPIA HAVE ONE OF THE OLDEST VERSIONS OF THE BIBLE, but  
however old the version may be, in whatever language it might be
written, the Word remains  
one and the same. It transcends all boundaries of empires and all
conceptions of race. It is  
eternal.  

No doubt you all remember reading in the Acts of the Apostles of how
Philip baptised the  
Ethiopian official. He is the first Ethiopian on record to have followed
Christ, and from that  
day onwards the Word of God has continued to grow in the hearts of
Ethiopians. And I might  
say for myself that from early childhood I was taught to appreciate the
Bible and my love for it  
increases with the passage of time. All through my troubles I have found
it a cause of  
infinite comfort.  

"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
you  
rest" who can resist an invitation so full of compassion?  

Because of this personal experience in the goodness of the Bible, I was
resolved that all my  
countrymen should also share its great blessing and that by reading the
Bible they should find  
truth for themselves. Therefore, I caused a new translation to be made
from our ancient  
language into the language which the old and the young understood and
spoke.  

Today man sees all his hopes and aspirations crumbling before him. He is
perplexed and knows  
not whither he is drifting. But he must realise that the Bible is his
refuge, and the rallying  
point for all humanity. In it man will find the solution of his present
difficulties and  
guidance for his future action, and unless he accepts with clear
conscience the Bible and its  
great Message, he cannot hope for salvation. For my part I glory in the
Bible.  

<span id="religion"></span> RELIGION  

We are gratified in particular, to note that the work of this conference
has been concerned  
purely with religious, spiritual matters free from extraneous political
considerations.  

This is only fitting and proper, for the church, as a symbol of peace,
must follow the path of  
peace in all parts of the world. For world peace can only be made
abiding by the grace of God,  
through the prayers of the Holy Fathers. The truth of this cardinal fact
is evident to all  
mankind.  

Therefore, it has become the noble responsibility of Christians, and
peoples of other faiths  
and their leaders throughout the world, to pray and to work hard for the
preservation of world  
peace.  

We have always been religious, ever since childhood, ever since the day
our father, Ras  
Makonnen, taught us the commandment of Our Lord the Creator.  

But we don't consider our religion alone valid and have granted the
people the freedom to  
observe any religion they please.  

We believe in the reunification of the churches, which is why we were so
happy to meet Pope  
Paul VI during our voyage to Italy. We were greatly taken with him, we
judged him a man of  
superior capacity, especially as regards his intention to work towards
church unity.  
He received us with great friendliness.  

<span id="morality"></span> MORALITY  

ITS BETTER TO GIVE  

Wise men have always known the deep and pervading truth that it is
better to give than to  
receive, for even as it conflicts with selfish and ambitious desires, it
moderates and  
controls them.  

Giving always demands sacrifice. To overcome the temptation to enjoy
mere daily comfort, to  
press resolutely and patiently forward on the scheduled way, are true
tests of the high degree  
of determination that should bind you together. Memories of past
injustices should not divert  
us from the more pressing business at hand.  

We must live in peace with our former colonizers, shunning recrimination
and bitterness and  
fore-swearing the luxury of vengeance and retaliation, lest the acid of
hatred erode our souls  
and poison our hearts.  

Let us act as befits the dignity which we claim for ourselves as
Africans, proud of our own  
special qualities, distinctions, and abilities. We must speak out on
major issues, courageously,  
openly and honestly, and in blunt terms of right and wrong.  

If we yield to blandishments or threats, if we compromise when no
honourable compromise is  
possible, our influence will be sadly diminished and our prestige
woefully prejudiced and  
weakened.  

On this day which men of earth and angels of heaven could neither have
foreseen nor known, I  
give thanks unutterable by the mouth of man to the living God who has
enabled me to be present  
among you.  

Today is the beginning of a new era in the history of Ethiopia.  

Since this is so, do not reward evil for evil, do not commit any act of
cruelty like those  
which the enemy committed against us. Do not allow the enemy any
occasion to foul the good  
name of Ethiopia.  

We shall take his weapons and make him return by the way he came.  

We believe in cooperation and collaboration to promote the cause of
international security,  
the equality of man and the welfare of mankind.  

We believe in the peaceful settlement of all disputes without resorting
to force.  
And in accordance with the charter of O.A.U. we will strive to eradicate
colonialism, racism  
and apartheid from the face of the earth, to frustrate the efforts being
made by foreign powers  
to dictate the destiny of the African continent, and we will continue to
stand.  

<span id="human"></span> HUMAN RIGHTS  

Colonialism and the policy of racism impose soul searching questions of
human rights, weighing  
equally on the conscience of all men and nations of good-will. History
amply shows that the  
freedom enjoyed by the many becomes fragile when the denial, even to the
few, of basic human  
rights is tolerated.  

Our efforts as free men must be to establish new relationships, devoid
of any resentment and  
hostility, restored to our belief and faith in ourselves as individuals,
dealing on a basis of  
equality with other equally free people.  

We believe in cooperation and collaborration to promote the cause of
international security, the  
equality of man and the welfare of mankind.  

We believe in the peaceful settlement of all disputes without resorting
to force.  

All well ordered and modern states can only base themselves upon Courts
of Justice and Conduct  
of Laws which are just, correct and geared towards the protection of the
rights of individuals.  
Justice is a product of education.  

Man's ingratitude to man is often manifested in willingness to relegate
human beings to the  
scrapheaps of life when they enter the twilight of their careers and
younger brains and  
stronger arms are found to replace them  

<span id="unity"></span> UNITY  

Ethiopia is a nation fully committed to African unity and to the greater
guise of world peace  
and shall continue to support and strengthen the O.A.U., which was
established as an African  
instrument for peace and progress.  

*O.A.U.*  

The Organization of African Unity, is an organization which the people
of our vast continent  
have established with a view to performing certain specific tasks.  

Briefly speaking, the organization is established for the purpose of
protecting in a better  
fashion, the independence of African States.  

It is also meant to expedite the economic and social progress through
cooperation of African  
peoples. It also has the important task of assisting in the maintenance
of international peace  
and security.  

We know that unity can be and has been attained among men of the most
disparate origins, that  
difference of race, of religion, of culture, of tradition, are no
insurmountable obstacles to  
the coming together of peoples.  

We stand today on the stage of world affairs, before the audience of
world opinion. We have  
come together to assert our role in the direction of world affairs and
to discharge our duty  
to the great continent whose two hundred and fifty million people we
lead. Africa is today at  
mid-course, in transition from the Africa of Yesterday to the Africa of
Tomorrow. Even as we  
stand here, we move from the past into the future The task on which we
have embarked, the  
making of Africa, will not wait we must act, to shape and mould the
future and leave our  
imprint on events as they pass into history.  

We seek, at this meeting, to determine whither we are going and to chart
the course of our  
destiny. It is no less important that we know whence we came. An
awareness of our past is  
essential to the establishment our personality and our identity as
Africans.  

This world was not crested piecemeal. Africa was born no later and no
earlier than any other  
geographical area on this globe. Africans, no more and no less than
other men, possess all  
human attributes, talents and deficiencies, virtues and faults.
Thousands of years ago,  
civilizations flourished in Africa which suffer not at all by comparison
with those of other  
continents. In those centuries, Africans were politically free and
economically independent.  
Their social patterns were their own and their cultures truly
indigenous.  

The obscurity which enshrouds the centuries which elapsed beteeen those
earliest days and the  
rediscovery of Africa is being gradually dispersed. What is certain is
that during those long  
years Africans were born, lived and died. Men on other parts of this
earth occupied themselves  
with their own concerns and, in their conceit, proclaimed that the world
began and ended at  
their horizons. All unknown to them, Africa developed in its own
pattern, growing in its own  
life and, in the Nineteenth Century, finally re-emerged into the world's
consciousness.  
The events of the past hundred and fifty years require no extended
recitation from us. The  
period of colonialism into which we were plunged culminated with our
continent fettered and  
bound; with our once proud and free peoples reduced to humiliation and
slavery; with Africans  
terrain cross-hatched and checker - boarded by artificial and arbitrary
boundaries Many of  
us, during those bitter yearn were overwhelmed in battle, and those who
escaped conquest did  
so at the costs of desperate resistance and bloodshed. Others were sold
into bondage as the  
price extracted by the colonialists for the 'protection' which they
extended and the  
possessions of which they disposed. Africa was a physical resource to be
exploited and Africans  
were chattels to be purchased bodily or, at best, peoples to be reduced
to vasselage and  
lackeyhood. Africa was the market for the produce of other nations and
the source of the raw  
materials with which their factories were fed.  

Today, Africa has emerged from this dark passage, Our Armageddon is
past. Africa has been  
reborn as a free continent and Africans have been reborn as free men.
The blood that was shed  
and the sufferings that were endured are today Africa's advocates for
freedom and unity. Those  
men who refused to accept the judgement passed upon them by the
colonisers, who held  
unswervingly through the darkest hours to a vision of an African
emancipated from political,  
economic and spiritual domination, will be remembered and revered
wherever Africans meet.  
Many of them never set foot on this continent. Others were born and died
here. What we may  
utter today can add little to the heroic struggle of those who, by their
example, have shown  
us how precious are freedom and human dignity and of how little value is
life without them.  
Their deeds are witten in history.  

Africa's victory, although proclaimed, is not yet total, and areas of
resistance still remain.  
Today, we name as our first great task the final liberating of those
Africans still dominated  
by foreign exploitation and control. With the goal in sight and
uriqualified triumph within  
our grasp, let us not now falter or lag or relax. We must make one final
supreme effort now,  
when the struggle grows weary, when so much has been lost, that the
thrilling sense of  
achievement has brought us near satiation. Our liberty is meaningless
unless all Africans are  
free. our brothers in the Rhodesias, in Mozambique, in Angola, in South
Africa cry out in  
anguish for our support and assistance. We must urge on their behalf
their peaceful accession  
to independence. We must align and identify ourselves with all aspects
of their liberation and  
not fail to back our words with action. To them we say, your pleas shall
not go unheeded. The  
resources of Africa and all freedom-loving nations are marshalled in
your service. Be of good  
heart, for your deliverance is at hand.  

1.  
One important lesson that we have learnt from the experience of the last
ten years is that we  
cannot leave the further progress of African unity to take its own
direction at its own pace  
without active guidance from us.  

The volume of intra-African trade, which at present, accounts for less
than ten percent of our  
total foreign trade should be progressively increased, so that by the
end of the decade trade  
among African countries should occupy a significant place in the exports
of each of our  
countries.  

2\. African countries should establish progressive targets for reducing
tariffs and other trade  
barriers among themselves.  

3\. Our Ministers charged with the responsibility of economic planning
should hold regular  
consultations so as to harmonise our development policies and plans and
to open up potential  
avenues for the expansion of intra-African trade.  

Through regular consultations, we should undertake to identify the need
for and to establish  
industries which may cater to our common needs.  

This is important, because the scale on which modern industries can
become viable today  
necessitates that we should create in Africa wide economic bases to
support a balanced  
economic state.  

<span id="gov"></span> GOVERNMENT  

When a whole nation accepts and maintains a government in existence, it
means that the nation  
recognizes that government.  

There is always something moving, brewing. There are ambitious people
everywhere. Wicked  
people.  
The only thing to do is to deal with them with courage and decision.  
One must beware of uncertainty, weakness or conflicting emotions - they
lead to defeat.  

It is our opinion that the world has not changed at all. We believe that
such changes have  
modified nothing. We don't even notice any difference between monarchies
and republics: to us,  
they appear two substantially similar methods of governing a nation.  

Democracy, Republic:  
What do these words signify?  
What have they changed in the world?  
Have men become better, more loyal, kinder?  
Are the people happier?  
All goes on as before, as always.  
Illusions, illusions.  

One should consider the interests of a nation before subverting it with
words. Democracy is  
necessary in some cases and we believe some African peoples might adopt
it. But in other cases  
it is a handful, a mistake.  

We are all adherent, whatever our internal political systems, of the
principles of democratic  
action. Let us apply these to the unity we seek to create.  

Force must be used against force.  
We ourselves, by virtue of our descent from the Queen of Sheba and King
Solomon, ever since we  
accepted in trust, in 1916, first the regency of the Ethiopian realm and
later, the Imperial  
Dignity, right up to the present, we have set out to the best of our
ability, to improve,  
gradually, internal administration by introducing into the country
western modes of civilization  
through which our people may attain a higher level.  

In explanation of the notion 'gradually': unless it is through coaxing a
child and getting it  
accustomed, it will not be pleased if one takes from it what it has
seized with its hand. When  
one gives such a baby any sort of food, it will not wish to eat it,
unless one shows it to the  
child and lets it taste it. Unless they give it milk or other soft food
until it grows teeth, it  
will not be able to eat when they place bread or meat before them.  

And similarly with people who have lived by custom only, without
learning at school, without  
absorbing knowledge by the ear or observing and searching with the eye,
it is necessary to  
accustom them, through educations to abandon habits by which they have
for long been living,  
to make them accept new ways. yet not by hasty or cruel methods but by
patience and study.  
gradually and over a prolonged period.  

*Only a system which tolerates dissent can survive*  

It gives us great pleasure to appear before this distinguished
assemblage and we bring you the  
fraternal salutations of the Ethiopian people.  

The people of Ethiopia and Trinidad and Tobago are joined in a massive
and continuous effort to  
create for themselves a new and better way of life. They face many of
the same problems.  

The hopes and aspirations which they share derive from the same
essential beliefs in the nature  
and destiny of man. It is thus inevitably true that there should exist
between those two great  
peoples strong and lasting ties of friendship and understanding  

Your role as the representatives of the people is a particularly
critical one in the councils of  
the twentieth century. The manner in which a representative of the
people should properly  
discharge his responsibilities has long been a matter for learned
discussion among philosophers  
and political scientists.  

The world of the developing nations is creating new problems for the
scholars to ponder as  
new societies are emerging to deal with the intricate and explosive
questions of national and  
institutional development.  

Is a representative responsible only to a constituency or to the
particular group or interest  
which has chosen or appointed him? Certainly this responsibility Must be
an element in the  
thought and action of such a man, but there are higher values and
greater interests and  
responsibilities than these.  

Obstacles  

Sectional, tribal and other divisive factors often pose major obstacles
to national  
development. In their expanded sense, as narrowly national and
ideological interests, they  
threaten unity and progress.  

No one is today so foolish as to believe thay any one nation constitutes
a perfect monolith  
of faith and ideology. Nor could anyone wish that there should be such
utter vanity of thought  
and aspiration.  

The systems of Government which have sought to impose uniformity of
belief have survived  
briefly and then expired, blinded and weakened by obsessive reliance
upon their supposed  
infallibility. The only system of Government which can survive is one
which is prepared to  
tolerate dissent and criticism and Which accepts these as useful and in
any case, inevitable  
aspects of all social and political relations.  

The tolerance of dissent and criticism within a Government proceeds from
a single essential  
premise: that the Government exists to serve the people generally.
Government servants, whether  
designated as representatives or not, have a trust to work for the
general welfare.  

The same trust exists among the member states of international
organizations. The members of  
such organizations must adhere to some tacit or expressed conception of
international welfare.  

Common Goals  

In the case of the Organization of African Unity, it is an African
Unity, it is an African  
welfare; in the case of the United Nations Organization, it is world
welfare.  

In one way or another, the member nation must accept in thought, spirit
and action the basic  
premise of their institutions that men of all races, beliefs and status
share some essential  
common goals.  

From this premise, no great and easy actions follow as corollaries. The
representatives of  
peoples and nations can only come together with open and objective minds
and willing hearts  
to engage in dialogue, without rigid dogmas and slogans and without
violence.  

Working in this way achieves no instant Utopia. It may, however, enable
us to achieve together  
what it is possible to achieve and to move forward steadily, if not
always in great haste, with  
some degree of harmony and mutual understanding.  

Domestically, we can build strong and happy and resourceful societies.
internationally, we can  
force the end of oppression of man by man and nation by nation. We can
bring about the security  
and mutual trust which will open the way to the greater human
achievements for which the needs  
of mankind now cry out.  

(He concluded:)  
Permit me to express my heartfelt gratitude for the reception accorded
me by the people and  
Government of Trinidad and Tobago.  

<span id="leadership"></span> LEADERSHIP  

Leadership does not mean domination. The world is always well supplied
with people who wish to  
rule and dominate others.  

The true leader is a different sort; he seeks effective activity which
has a truly beneficient  
purpose. He inspires others to follow in his wake, and holding aloft the
torch of wisdom, leads  
the way for society to realize its genuinely great aspirations.  

The art of leadership is in the ability to make people want to work for
you, while they are  
really under no obligation to do so. Leaders are people, who raise the
standards by which they  
judge themselves and by which they are willing to be judged. The goal
chosen, the objective  
selected, the requirements imposed, are not mainly for their followers
alone.  
They develop with consumate energy and devotion, their own skill and
knowledge in order to  
reach the standard they themselves have set.  

This whole-hearted acceptance of the demands imposed by even higher
standards is the basis of  
all human progress. A love of higher quality, we must remember, is
essential in a leader.  
The true leader is one who realizes by faith that he is an instrument in
the hands of God, and  
dedicates himself to be a guide and inspirer of the nobler sentiments
and aspirations of the  
people.  

He who would be a leader must pay the price in self-discipline and moral
restraints. This  
details the correction and improvement of his personal character, the
checking of passions and  
desires and an exemplary control of one's bodily needs and desires.  

To be first in place, one must be first in merit as well.  

He who has not learned to render prompt and willing service to others
will find it difficult  
to win and keep the goodwill and cooperation of his subordinates.  
A leader will kindle interest, teach, aid, correct and inspire. Those
whom he leads will  
cooperate with him in maintaining discipline for the good of the group.
He will instruct his  
followed in the goals towards which to strive, and create in them a
sense of mutual effort  
for attaining the goal.  

<span id="edu"></span> EDUCATION  

A strong nation and a free nation can only base itself upon education.  

In order to make life worthwhile it is also necessary to acquire other
things that can only  
come about after the acquisition of learning. Learning and technical
training must be nurtured  
by faith in God, reverence for the human soul, and respect for the
reasoning mind.  

There is no safer anchorage for our learning, our lives and our actions
than that provided by  
divine teachings coupled with the best in human understanding. The
leaders developed here  
should  
be guided by the fundamental values and the moral power which have for
centuries constituted  
the essence of our religious teachings.  

These are crucial times when nations rise against nations, tensions
increase and disaster is  
possible at any moment. Distances are shrinking. Peace and life itself
are threatened by  
misunderstanding and conflict. Now is the time when man's relationship
to God must be the  
foundation for all his efforts toward enlightenment, and learning the
basis for understanding  
cooperation and peace.  

The existence of a skilled and trained manpower is an absolute necessity
for the progress and  
development of any country. Therefore, it is the sacred duty and
responsibility of students and  
parents to see to it that the mistakes of the past are not repeated and
that time which should  
be devoted to the pursuit of learning is not wasted by students
heedlessly, following the  
instigation of a few misguided troublemakers who have yet to understand
the value and the true  
meaning of education.  

The salvation of our country Ethiopia, we have repeatedly stated to you,
lies primarily in  
education. As Ethiopia is one, all Ethiopians are also one and education
is the only way to  
maintain the condition.  

In all countries of the modern world, special competence is required to
deal with the  
advancement of agriculture, industry, commerce and the civil service.
That competence, can be  
secured only through the facilities provided in modern universities.  

We believe that the universities today stand as the most promising hope
for constructive  
solutions to the problems that beset the modern world, problems which
prevent the peaceful  
cooperation of nations and which threaten the world and humanity with
death and disaster.  

From universities must come men, ideas, knowledge, experience, technical
skills and the deep  
human understanding vital to fruitful relations among nations. Without
these, world order for  
which we have so long strived, cannot be established.  

A well informed public opinion is essential to the growth of political
and social awareness.  
Only he who is informed can comment intelligently on his nation's
development and only by such  
comments can errors be corrected and progress stimulated.  

We must draw on what is valuable and meaningful in our history and
tradition, merging this  
with the best in modern learning.  

We expect from you, to whom we have given the opportunity of education
in your chosen field  
great and productive service to our country.  

If women develop in education, they can overcome the natural weakness
and serve their country  
as men do.  

It is our wish to assure the spread of education among all African
People as much as among our  
own subjects.  

A father should bequeath not only wealth but also provide proper
education. Education has value  
when it is established in individuals of good character with respect to
God. We wish that your  
destiny shall be embraced in an education firmly based in good character
before men and respect  
before God.  

Any who may wish to profit himself alone from the knowledge given him,
rather than serve  
others through the knowledge he has gained from learning, is betraying
knowledge and rendering  
it worthless.  

A man's happiness is to make his brother happy, and to serve his
country. Thus it is possible  
to justify for knowledge its high and deserved place. For knowledge is
power. If it is not  
applied to its proper purpose, to create, let there be no doubt, it will
destroy.  

If we have made so many sacrifices for the education of our youth, it is
because we are  
convinced that only through intellectual progress and education can
Ethiopia come into its own  
and make it's just contribution to the history of the Middle East.  

We believe that from truth alone is born liberty and only an educated
people can consider  
itself as really free and master of its fate. It is only with an
educated people that  
representative and democratic organs of government can exercise their
influence for national  
progress.  

<span id="responsibility"></span> RESPONSIBILITY  

It is both the duty and responsibility of the world's fortunate few to
help fulfil the  
legitimate aspirations of the unfortunate many.  

As man's faculty attains higher level of development and sophistication,
so do his wants in  
life.  

As generations come and go, those assuming responsibility for the period
do not cease to try  
and improve on the past in order to meet newly arising demands. In this
respect, it is quite  
evident that to march with the time members of the coming generation
should build on what their  
forefathers have bequeathed to them.  

It is because the present generation is cherishing and keeping intact
what it has received  
from the past that it has succeeded in attaining its present stage of
development, by making  
the necessary changes and improvements called for by conditions now
existing. This would  
require great foresight and the-work accomplished as far as regards to
this task of great  
responsibility is no small matter. It has been fulfilled as a result of
God's blessing and His  
Divine guidance.  

It is both the responsibility of the governor as well as elders to
create harmony among the  
people in initiating them to discuss their common problems and work
towards the problems and  
the betterment of their standard of living.  

It is the duty of teachers to direct the thought and outlook as well as
mould the character of  
their students. For this reason, the responsibility of teachers in
training student-teachers  
aimed at the future progress and development of our country and the
proper upbringing of  
students, could hardly be underestimated.  

In the age in which we are living especially when different philosophies
of life are competing  
against another, the responsibility of teachers has been even more
exacting. Those who will be  
serving the people in future should follow this same path in
endeavouring to develop their  
country and maintain her freedom. This is one of the main
responsibilities of teachers.  

In this age when man, through his knowledge of science, has created
dangerous weapons to  
destroy himself the responsibility of the great powers for the
maintenance of world peace is  
well known to everyone. We believe that the exchange of visits by
statesmen to talk over  
matters on which their points of view will greatly help remove the
misunderstandings and  
mistrust prevailing among States.  

<span id="planning"></span> PLANNING  

Planning is the basis of the rational and sustained use of capital,
manpower and time in the  
acceleration of economic development.  

The history of planning shows that no pioneer plans were ever executed
even partially, much  
less wholly.  

Planning is indispensable for the rational utilization of both a
nation's resources and  
foreign aid or loans.  

As a basis of, and working procedure for, a national socio-economic
policy, a plan is a means  
whereby a nation can be developed through the rational utilization of
manpower and machinery for  
the most important aspects of he country's needs.  

The execution of any such plan needs, however, national participation.
You must ensure that  
in your desire to achieve immediate goals, long term considerations of
equal or greater  
importance are not ignored or irrevocably prejudiced. Plan your time and
use both your  
physical and mental powers purposefully and productively. Military
planning for the security  
of this continent must be undertaken in common within a collective
framework.  

<span id="work"></span> WORK  

Every labourer is a father, his labour is his child. Choose your project
carefully and achieve  
it worthily.  

Once a person has decided upon his life work and is assured that in
doing the work for which  
he is best endowed and equipped, he is filling a vital need, what he
then needs, is faith and  
integrity, compiled with courageous spirit so that no longer preferring
himself to the  
fulfilment of his task, he may address himself to the problems he must
solve in order to be  
effective.  

Rich and poor have always existed and always will.  
Why? Because there are those that work and those that don't, those that
wish to earn their  
living and those that prefer to do nothing.  
Those that work, that want to work, are not poor. For it is true that
Our Lord the Creator  
sends us into the world as equals, but it is also true that when one is
born one is neither  
rich nor poor. One is naked.  
It is later on that one becomes rich or poor, according to one's
desserts.  

Yes, we too are aware that giving alms serves no useful purpose. For
there is only one means  
to solve the poverty problem. work.  

We have said that whoever doesn't work because he doesn't want to is
poor. We have said that  
wealth has to be gained through hard work. We have said those who don't
work starve. And now  
we add that the capacity to earn depends on the individual: Each
individual is responsible for  
his misfortunes, his fate. It is wrong to expect help to fall from
above, as a gift: Wealth has  
to be deserved. Work is one of the commandment of Our Lord the
Creator!  

If each and everyone endeavours to cooperate and work in as much as his
capacity permits, our  
faith rests upon the Almighty God that he would bless the results for
us.  

It is not sufficient simply to see and admire the natural beauty and
fertility of Ethiopia.  

It is our obligation to work upon and benefit from this country whose
fertile soil has been  
granted us by the Almighty God. We have to gain honour and pride for the
country.  

Whatever the task may be, man may begin it but he cannot complete it,
unless God sustains  
and supports him. If he fails to accomplish the task on which he has set
out, having worked to  
the best of his ability, he is not to be maligned by being called
lazy.  

<span id="self"></span> SELF HELP  

The people themselves must come to realize their own difficulties in the
development of their  
community and try to solve them by collective participation following an
order of priority and  
taking their potentiality into account.  

It is well known to you all that recognizing one's problems and striving
hard to challenge  
them is a mark of an attempt at self-sufficiency. Self help in the
benefits to be acquired  
through education, will save the individual from asking someone's
assistance.  

<span id="dev"></span> DEVELOPMENT  

Although the beginnings of civilization of each country vary in time,
the fundamental factors  
which gave impetus to each country to awaken and embark on the road to
progress to reach their  
present level of development, are those qualities which are enshrined in
the nature of man,  
namely desire and fortitude.  

The partner who places his own short-range ambitions ahead of the
long-range interests of the  
partnership has embarked on a course which will ultimately result in the
dissolution of the  
partnership itself.  

It is by the understanding of past difficulties that we can bequeath
fundamental guidance  
which would be of pride to the coming generations we therefore urge our
people to struggle and  
to make sacrifices for those things which will enable them to ameliorate
their conditions of  
life and leave a richer heritage.  

*Economic Development*  

Where enterprise and initiative are not lacking, the pace at which the
growth of a country's  
economy normally proceeds can be quickened or slackened by global
developments far or near. In  
our effort to raise the living Standard of our beloved people, in our
endeavour to bring  
prosperity to our country, the feeling of cooperation and understanding
has always characterized  
our people.  

A special case is the recent development in certain provinces where the
people are seen  
voluntarily raising funds to build schools, clinics, roads and similar
other projects.  
What can give one more pleasure than to see such a measure of self-help
in one's life time,  
for the prosperity and progress of his own country? Let every citizen of
our empire strive  
hard to strengthen this espirit de corps everywhere.  

We entrust the spirit of good-will to our people to work diligently and
cooperatively in order  
to arrive at the realization of this socioeconomic development that has
been launched by either  
our government or our people. You have a rich land that yields a variety
of products, do not  
be contented with the satisfaction of your bare needs but instead,
cultivate your land among  
others with oleogenous plants, the seeds of which you can export for
your greater benefit. Use  
the forest woods to make furniture and implements and exchange them for
money. Your  
workmanship will be a monument to your name.  

One should realize that thriftiness is the basis for the accumulation of
wealth and the  
economic growth of a nation. One seldom minimizes the value of money
earned by the sweat of  
the brow however small it may be, but for the extravagant even a huge
amount of money is  
worthless.  

The co-operative movement has long been known throughout the world, and
we Ourself have on  
numerous occasions urged Our people to join increasingly in cooperative
enterprises.  

Co-operatives must, ultimately, play a highly important role in the
growth of our economy, and  
no time can be lost in availing ourselves of the benefits to be derived
from therm During the  
past year, we decided upon a programme designed to provide specific
encouragement to the  
creation of agricultural co-operatives, and a number of
Government-sponsored co-operatives,  
farms have been established by Our Ministry of National Community
Development. We have  
provided lands, agricultural machinery and expert assistance to these
farms and we entertain  
high hopes that their success will spur Our people to embark
increasingly upon co-operative  
endeavours. Should Our people fail to avail themselves of this
opportunity, the consequences  
will be regrettable indeed.  

*Community Development*  

The fundamental purpose of a community development movement is to teach
the rural people of  
Our Empire that through cooperative self-help and a united approach to
common problems, the  
vast potential for their own self-improvement which they themselves
represent, can be  
translated into effective programmes which can do much to  
improve their standard of living.  

*Social Development*  

Lasting progress can only be built on deep and enduring foundations.
When a solid foundation  
is laid, if the mason is able and his materials good, a strong house can
be built.  

To develop oneself, one has to develop one's own initiative and
perseverance - a man has to  
strive in order to grow. Let us work out our own programmes in all
fields - political, economic,  
social and military. Man's contributions which live to influence the
life and progress of  
posterity, are the most permanent monuments that can ever be created. We
must become  
increasingly willing to analyze our efforts, to experiment, to admit our
failures as we take  
pride in our successes.  

<span id="land"></span> LAND POLICY  

For those of you who possess the land and labour but lack capital, we
have made credit  
available at low interest. For those of you who have the necessary
finance but do not possess  
land to work on, we have, in accordance with our 'Proclamation' which
entitles every Ethiopian  
to ownership of land, established offices in every province through
which you may be able to  
acquire land. Those who have neither land nor money will be granted land
and financial loans  
at low interest. For those of you who possess land, who have financial
resources and manpower,  
we have made experts available to furnish you with the necessary
guidance and advice in your  
various undertakings.  

*Land Reform*  

The essence of land reform is, while fully respecting the principle of
private ownership, the  
landless people must have the opportunity to possess their own land,
that the position of  
tenant farmers must be improved, and that the system of taxation
applying to land holdings  
must be the same for all.  

It is our aim that every Ethiopian own his own land, in implementation
of this principle. We  
have ourselves set the example by ordering that certain lands in Arussi
Province heretofore  
administered by our Ministry of the Imperial Court be distributed to the
tenants working on  
them, against payment by each man only of the nominal fees charged for
the transfer and the  
registration of this property in his own name.  

This has been the basic objective of virtually every modern programme of
land reform; this  
is the ultimate goal of the study now being undertaken by the Committee
of Land Reform.  

<span id="resources"></span> RESOURCES  

The ultimate resource of a nation is its people.  
Unless this resource is employed for the benefit of the nation, unless
the latent good which  
it represents is exploited to the maximum for the common good the nation
will languish, poor  
in spirit, lacking in achievernent.  

But no people can make their full contribution to the life of the nation
to which they ovve  
allegiance unless they possess and enjoy those few fundamental
prerequisites indispensable  
to rendering their participation in the affairs of their country both
possible and  
significant.  

The growth of a people is complex and inter-related. Man must be
educated; he cannot come to  
grips with or cope with or understand the modern world unless he has
been taught about it. He  
must be assured of a minimum economic security; concern himself with
matters going beyond  
the day-to-day satisfaction of his physical needs. unless he is fed and
clothed and sheltered,  
nor can he acquire a sufficient degree of social consciousness to be
able to support his  
own personal interests to the good of the nation and the development of
its society.  

Freedom, liberty, the rights of manùthese mean little to the ignorant,
the hungry, the  
ill-clothed, the badly housed.  

It is our desire to see a much larger number of our young people
benefitting from the  
resources we have our own and have received as aid from abroad, and our
young people  
graduating in the fields of technology and industrial relation.  

It is essential that, however great the sacrifice needed to curb
economic stagnation may  
be, available resources be as judiciously used as possible on a
carefully selected list of  
priorities.  

<span id="ag"></span> AGRICULTURE  

Since Ethiopia's economy is predominantly agricultural, agriculture must
play a large role  
in the plans which have been drawn up, at our command, for our empire's
development.  

It is the duty of all to apply the skill of their minds to the
factories, the trading centres  
and the roads and communications which are also evidence of Ethiopia's
prosperity, of  
Ethiopia's strength.  

During the past year (1958) the abrupt cessation of rainfall during the
growing season  
caused considerable damage to Ethiopia's crops. This experience has
demonstrated that  
the rivers of our country should be devoted to irrigation, so that the
food needs of our ever  
growing population will no longer be left at the mercy of the whims and
caprices of the  
elements.  

The fruits of the farmer's labour must be enjoyed by him whose toil has
produced the crop.  
The uses of trees are many and varied. Groves of trees protect our
fields and plantations  
from being desiccated by the desert winds which blow from neighbouring
regions During the  
summer months, they provide moisture and shade. If trees are not
presently planted to replace  
those being cut down from time to time, our constant efforts to conserve
and develop the  
wealth of our country through the welfare of present and future
generations will be rendered  
ineffective and futile.  

We are greatly grieved to observe the many thousands of gashas of rich
forest land being  
destroyed every year by reckless timber-cutting, thoughtless forest
burning, unregulated  
forest grazing and other misuses of our forest wealth, due to popular
ignorance and desire  
for temporary advantage on the part of our people.  

The existence or non-existence of forest wealth in a country is one of
the most important  
factors influencing its development and progress. The increasing pace of
deforestation and  
the growing dearth of timber in Ethiopia, caused by unregulated
tree-cutting and the failure  
to replace these by new plantings, give us occasion for anxiety that a
severe economic  
problem will confront the coming generation. It is essential that steps
be taken here and  
now to stop this wastage and check this destruction.  

In these days when all nations of the world, in recognition of the
tremendous importance of  
forest wealth, have launched intensive progranmes for forest
conservation and re-forestation,  
it behoves our county also to take the appropriate measures to solve
this problem.  

It is our wish and our desire that each and every citizen of our country
follow the example  
we set on this Arbour Day in planting this tree, and himself plant as
many trees as he can,  
for his own benefit as well as for the benefit of future generations.  

Without agricultural expansion, industrial growth is impossible. Great
strides, it is true,  
have been made in introducing industries into Ethiopia in recent years.
But in any  
less-developed agrarian country possessing only limited possibilities
for selling the  
products of its factories in world export markets, industry can grow
only if there exists  
an increasingly prosperous rural consumer population. Industrialisation
is not an alternative  
to the development of agriculture; rather, the development of
agriculture is the essential  
pre-condition to the growth of industry.  

Measures will shortly be proposed to Parliament for action to be taken
to preserve, for  
the benefit of present and future generations, the nation's forests
which are not only  
valuable in themselves as a source of wood, but act as nature's guardian
against the forces  
of erosion, which, unchecked, can transform fertile areas into barren
and sterile desert.  

<span id="fine"></span> FINE ARTS  

A purely materialistic art would be like a tree which is expected to
bear fruit without  
flowering and to sacrifice grace and beauty for mere utility.  

Our admiration for the creator's handiwork should not be limited to
those things he has  
provided us with for our daily needs, but should include all that is
good and beautiful.  
It is these tender feelings of deep and silent admiration evoked from
our hearts by the  
beauties of creation that should find adequate expression in the fine
arts.  

Music, drama and the other arts are rooted in the ancient history of our
empire, and their  
development to an even higher peak of perfection will be possible in the
atmosphere of a  
university. Ethiopia possesses an ancient literature and its study can
be fostered here so  
thag the Ethiopian youth inspired by this national example, may raise it
to yet higher levels  
of excellence.  

The study of the heroic history of our empire will stimulate the
imagination of building  
authors and teachers.  

<span id="health"></span> HEALTH  

There is nothing as precious to man as a sound mind in a sound body and
it is essential that  
the physical well being of our people merits as much attention as its
spiritual welfare.  

<span id="inter"></span> INTER AFRICA  

There is absolutely no doubt that Africans will eventually obtain their
freedom and  
independence in spite of their present difficulties.  

The people of African origin have emigrated to all parts of the world,
but wherever they may  
be, they have similar historical experience and the problems that await
them depend on  
sympathy and this can be used by all of us as the basis for the
establishment of greater  
cooperation, which will be for our mutual benefit.  

*Haile Selassie to Parliament in Jamaica:*  
The people of Jamaica, by and large, have originated in Africa. This
gives us another basis  
upon which we can contract a healthy relation because of the fundamental
similarity between  
us, that will in the long run contribute to a better maintenance of
international peace and  
security.  

The Organization of African Unity is an organization which the people of
our vast continent  
have established with a view of performing certain specific tasks.
Briefly speaking, the  
organization is established for the purpose of protecting in a better
fashion, the independence  
of African States.  

It is also meant to expedite the economic and social progress through
cooperation of African  
peoples. It also has the important task of assisting in the maintenance
of initernational peace  
and security. And in accordance with the Charter of O.A.U., we eradicate
colonialism and  
apartheid.  

<span id="ethiopia"></span> ETHIOPIA'S WORLD POSITION  

Because of her unity and independence, Ethiopia had and still has
jealous enemies and  
aggressive dissidents.  

It is therefore the primary duty of every Ethiopian to safeguard the
unity and freedom that  
has been fortified since time immemorial by the courage and bravery of
our forefathers.  
We have to maintain its integrity, to work and benefit from its
existence.  

Ethiopia is a nation fully committed to African unity and to the greater
cause of world peace  
and subsequently shall continue to support and strengthen the O.A.U.,
which was established  
as an African instrument for peace and progress.  

Ethiopia is, by her own choice, a nonaligned state. Our Policies on the
vexatious  
international issues of the day have been declared to all, and our
adherence to them is  
steadfast: the urgent imperative of universal disarmament, the
settlement of disputes by  
peaceful negotiation, the supremacy of reason and logic over force and
irrationality.  

We insist that the way to peace among men and nations rests in the
even-handed application  
and enforcement of the principles of the United Nations and Organization
of African Unity:  
non-interference in the internal affairs of others, self determination
for the remaining  
dependent peopies of the world, respect for the territorial integrity of
independent states  
In the conduct of the international affairs of our nation, we have
placed high value upon  
personal contacts between peoples and leaders of nations.  

Ethiopia is a peace-loving nation. Except for those times when it had to
rise up in arms to  
fight-off aggression or to advance the cause of collective security;
there is not one instance  
in history of Ethiopia provoking a conflict by violating territorial
integrity or by  
interfering in the internal affairs of others, and there will never be
any such instance.  
However, Ethiopia will never be found wanting in its efforts to
strengthen its defence force,  
sustained as it is by the traditional valor of its gallant people, to
thwart the designs of  
those who are bent on violating the freedom and unity of its people and
its territorial  
integrity.  

<span id="intl"></span> INTERNATIONAL POLITICS  

In matters of foreign policy we have been ever guided by three basic
principles.  
First is our deep conviction that, where there is no lack of goodwill,
all international  
disputes can be resolved through negotiations, without recourse to
violence. An inevitable  
corollary of this belief is our firm conviction that all nations,
whatever their political  
persuasions, can live together in peace.  

Second is our unswerving devotion to the principle of collective
security.  

Third, flowing from the principle of collective security, is the
necessity, in these anxious  
days when the major powers are engaged in a frantic arms race, for all
countries which have  
accepted this principle and assumed a share of the responsibility for
ensuring the peace of  
the world, to become ever stronger militarily.  

As we have stated time and time again, we are firmly persuaded that the
path to guaranteeing  
the peace of the world lies in supporting the principle of collective
security ard the United  
Nations Charter, combined with a progressive reduction of the armaments
which are being built  
up throughout the world. The billions of dollars which are now wasted on
this fruitless effort  
could with great benefit, be diverted into the constructive channels of
aid for the economic  
growth of under-developed countries.  

*Personal Diplomacy*  

International friendship can be strenthened and deepened by the personal
exchange of ideas  
between leaders of nations.  

What the economically backward countries are looking forward to, however
is the application  
of the money now dumped on destructive armament to the solution of
economic problems.  

*The Need for Concerted Action*  

What is called for at this critical time is for the international
community to move from mere  
rejection and condemnation to taking action. The international community
has many options,  
but what has been lacking so far is political will.  

The world is only now coming to realize what Ethiopia and Africa have
long recognized, that  
peace, independence and prosperity of mankind can be achieved and
assured only by the  
collective and united efforts of free men who are prepared to maintain
eternal vigilance and  
abour unceasingly to protect these most precious of God's gifts.  

<span id="fate"></span> FATE  

Whatever the task may be, man may begin it but he cannot complete it,
unless God sustains and  
supports him. If he fails to accomplish the task on which he has set
out, having worked to the  
best of his ability, he is not to be maligned by being called lazy.  

Man may, at the onset, control the direction which events take, but once
his choice is made,  
events soon escape his control and history proceeds by its own force and
momentum.  

<span id="life"></span> LIFE  

What life has taught me on the question of racial discrimination, I like
to share with those  
who want to learn.  

That until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another
inferior is finally and  
permanently discredited and abandoned.  
That until there are no longer first class and second class citizens of
any nation;  
That until the colour of a man's skin is no more significance than the
colour of his eyes:  
That until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all, without
regard to race;  
That until that day, the dream of lasting peace and world citizenship
and the rule of  
international morality will remain but a fleeting illusion to be pursued
but never attained;  
And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes that hold our brothers in
Angola, in Mozambique  
and in South Africa in sub-human bondage have been toppled and
destroyed;  
Until bigotry and prejudice and malicious and inhuman self interest have
been replaced by  
understanding and tolerance and goodwill;  
Until all Africans stand and speak as free beings, equal in the eyes of
the Almighty;  
Until that day, the African continent will not know peace. We Africans
will fight, if  
necessary, and we know that we shall win, as we are confident in the
victory of good over  
evil.  
It will be self deceiving and a waste of time to advocate dialogue with
those who are not  
ready to listen, because it is obvious that the freedom of millions is
not a commodity subject  
to bargaining.  

It is a fact that young people have always been impatient. This
intemational movement is  
therefore not surprising. Such move ments sometimes bring useful ideas
into the open, but  
very often these ideas turn out to be harmful and contrary to ordinary
progress.  

This impatience and agitation result in larue part from a
rnisunderstanding of realities. We  
are convinced that young people must learn to use their heads rather
than their fists. They  
should be heard, but also guided for the common good.  

Young people will be young people. You cannot change the uncouth manners
of the youth.  
Besides there is nothing new in that: there is never anything new under
the sun. They can't  
know it because they lack experience, they lack wisdom. Examine the
past: you'll see that  
the disobedience of the young has occurred all through history. The
young don't know what  
they want.  

Life is like the theatre - One mustn't try to understand it all at once
and immediately. It is  
no longer amusing.  

There are good men and wicked. The former should be made use of and the
latter punished,  
without attempting to understand why the ones are good and the others
wicked. We demand  
too much of men to be able to respect them ...  

That which man dreams of and to Which he aspires, unless fulfilled in
his own lifetime, can  
produce no actual satisfaction to him. It will be self deceiving and a
waste of time to  
advocate dialogue with those who are not ready to listen, because it is
obvious that the  
freedom of millions is not a commodity subject to bargaining. It is
better to die free than  
to live as slaves.  

<span id="death"></span> DEATH  

Now, however, it has become your fate to obey the order of the great and
merciful Lord, a  
lot that befalls each and everyone of us in our turn.  

As it were, after you had accomplished what was within your bounds, you
have slept, but  
although you depart from us physically, yow works and your name will
always remain among  
us.  

*On the death of Prince Makonnen:*  

Mortality is man's inevitable course. We must patiently accept God's
resolution in giving us  
Makonnen, the one whom he gave us to be the ornament of our life, and
recalling him.  
Death changes everything, sweeps everything away. Even mistakes.  

<span id="misc"></span> MISCELLANEOUS  

Throughout history it has been the inaction of those who could have
acted, the indifference of  
those who should have known better, the silence of the voice of justice
when it mattered most,  
that has made it possible for evil to triumph.  

The glorious pages of human history have been written only in those
moments when men have  
been able to act in concert to prevent impending tragedies. By the
actions you take you can  
also illuminate the pages of history.  

When you make man rich in the honours of this world and appoint him
above other creatures,  
that it be known that It is not for his merit but only through your
benevolence and generosity,  

Since no creature created in Your image and to Your pattern gives up
hope that everything he  
begs of You will be done for him until the day You sever his soul from
his body, we beseech  
You that Ethiopia should not remain with her freedom extinct and
prostrate under an alien  
ruler, so that the mouth of her people be silenced for fear of a foreign
governor, but rather,  
that You will save them by Your deeds of kindness lest they remain with
their hearts  
oppressed through being deprived of their own Ethiopian ruler who was
leading them towards  
civilization under a light yoke and with gladness  

O Lord, abode of exiles, light of the blind, truth and justice are Your
thrones. Receive us  
who have been exiled for our freedom's sake, who have had to leave our
country on account of  
violent assault, In praying to You thus, it is not for our righteousness
but for Your great  
mercies.  

Technical and scientific advances have combined to raise mankind to a
level of material  
achievement never before realized.  

A house built on granite and strong foundations, not even the onslaught
of pouring rain,  
gushing torrents and strong winds will be able to pull down. Some people
have written the  
story of my life representing as truth what in fact derives from
ignorance, error or envy;  
but they cannot shake the truth from its place, even if they attempt to
make others believe it.  

Sports being the symbol of fraternity and team work there can be no
doubt of its utility or  
of the sound virtues which it develops.  

Unemployment is harmful - it harms and damages the unemployed himself,
his nation and his  
country. Employers should strive to create more jobs. Workers should
attend to their work with  
diligence and vigour. These twin attributes are the cornerstones for
progress.  

I know of the love which the Jamaican people entertain for the people of
Ethiopia and the  
welcome which you have given me this day is evidence of it.  
I know that the Jamaican people were very sympathetic when Ethiopia was
occupied during the  
fascist regime. During that time, Jamaicans as well as others who had
African blood supported  
the Ethiopian Liberation Movement.  
And now that we are free we must assume the responsibility to work for
the greater unity of all  
peoples of African origin.  

It is quite true that a country can achieve material progress alone.
However, we know from the  
experiences of the past that internaltional cooperation tends to quicken
the pace for progress of  
individual countries.  

This is again another area for us to think about and see in what way we
can further expand the  
relations of the people of Jamaica and Ethiopia.  

From another fundamental point of view, this is precisely why the O.A.U.
has been  
established. It is because the African continent, which comprises more
than 250 million people,  
if it were to remain divided among more than 30 states, their individual
voices would not carry  
weight. It is precisely why, since there is an identity of interest, we
have attempted to include  
Jamaica.  

Also, so that we can carry this weight in the councils of nations, and
also through the  
process of cooperation and expanded economic relations we might be in a
position to quicken  
the pace of development of the individual member countries of the O A
U.
