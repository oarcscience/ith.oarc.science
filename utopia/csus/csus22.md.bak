#### IV.—SUNDAY AT THE ONEIDA COMMUNITY, WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF "CRITICISM."

I was permitted to spend several days at the Oneida Community, among
which was a Sunday.

The people are kind, polite to each other and to strangers, cheerful,
and industrious. There is no confusion, and for so large a number very
little noise. Where two hundred people live together in one house,
order, system, and punctuality are necessary; and loud voices would soon
become a nuisance.

I was shown the house, the kitchen and heating arrangements, the barns
with their fine stock, the various manufacturing operations; and in the
evening was taken to their daily gathering, at which instrumental music,
singing, and conversation engage them for an hour, after which they
disperse to the private parlors to amuse themselves with dominoes or
dancing,

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

or to the library to read or write letters. Cards are prohibited. The
questions I asked were freely answered; and all the people in one way or
another came under my eye.

Some of them have the hard features of toil-worn New England farmers;
others look like the average business-men of our country towns or inland
cities; others are students, and there are a number of college-bred men
in the community. A fine collection of birds in a cabinet, skillfully
stuffed and mounted, showed me that there is in the society a lively
love of natural history. The collection is, I should think, almost
complete for the birds of the region about Oneida.

The people seem contented, and pleased with their success, as well they
may be, for it is remarkable. They use good language, and the standard
of education among them is considerably above the average. No doubt the
training they get in their evening discussions, and in the habit of
writing for a paper whose English is pretty carefully watched, has
benefited them. They struck me as matter-of-fact, with no nonsense or
romance about them, by no means overworked, and with a certain, perhaps
for their place in life high average of culture. I should say that the
women are inferior to the men: examining the faces at an evening
meeting, this was the impression I carried away.

If I should add that the predominant impression made upon me was that it
was a common-place company, I might give offense; but, after all, what
else but this could be the expression of people whose lives are removed
from need, and narrowly bounded by their community; whose religious
theory calls for no internal struggles, and, once within the community,
very little self-denial; who are well-fed and sufficiently amused, and
not overworked, and have no future to fear? The greater passions are not
stirred in such a life. If these are once thoroughly awakened, the
individual leaves the community.

On Sunday the first work is to sort and send away to the

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

laundry the soiled clothing of the week. After this comes the regular
weekly meeting of the Business Board; and thereafter meetings for
criticism, conducted in rooms apart.

The institution of Criticism, a description of which I have reserved for
this place, is a most important and ingenious device, which Noyes and
his followers rightly regard as the corner-stone of their practical
community life. It is in fact their main instrument of government; and
it is useful as a means of eliminating uncongenial elements, and also to
train those who remain into harmony with the general system and order.

I am told that it was first used by Mr. Noyes while he was a divinity
student at Andover, where certain members of his class were accustomed
to meet together to criticize each other. The person to suffer criticism
sits in silence, while the rest of the company, each in turn, tell him
his faults, with, I judge, an astonishing and often exasperating
plainness of speech. Here is the account given by Mr. Noyes himself:

"The measures relied upon for good government in these community
families are, first, *daily evening meetings*, which all are expected to
attend. In these meetings, religious, social, and business matters are
freely discussed, and opportunity given for exhortation and reproof.
Secondly, *the system of mutual criticism*. This system takes the place
of backbiting in ordinary society, and is regarded as one of the
greatest means of improvement and fellowship. All of the members are
accustomed to voluntarily invite the benefit of this ordinance from time
to time. Sometimes persons are criticized by the entire family; at other
times by a committee of six, eight, twelve, or more, selected by
themselves from among those best acquainted with them, and best able to
do justice to their character. In these criticisms the most perfect
sincerity is expected; and in practical experience it is found best for
the subject to receive his criticism without replying. There is little
danger that the general verdict in respect to his character will be
unjust. This ordinance is far from agreeable to those whose egotism and
vanity are stronger than their love of truth. It is an ordeal which
reveals insincerity and selfishness; but it also often takes the form of
commendation, and reveals hidden virtues as well as secret faults. It is
always acceptable to those who wish to see themselves as others see
them.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

"These two agencies—daily evening meetings and criticism—are found quite
adequate to the maintenance of good order and government in the
communities. Those who join the communities understanding their
principles, and afterward prove refractory and inharmonic, and also
those who come into the communities in childhood, and afterward develop
characters antagonistic to the general spirit, and refuse to yield to
the governmental agencies mentioned, either voluntarily withdraw or are
expelled. Only one case of expulsion is, however, recorded."

They depend upon criticism to cure whatever they regard as faults in the
character of a member; for instance, idleness, disorderly habits,
impoliteness, selfishness, a love of novel-reading, "selfish love,"
conceit, pride, stubbornness, a grumbling spirit—for every vice, petty
or great, criticism is held to be a remedy. They have even a
"criticism-cure," and hold that this is almost as effective as their
"prayer-cure."

On Sunday afternoon, by the kindness of a young man who had offered
himself for criticism, I was permitted to be present. Fifteen persons
besides myself, about half women, and about half young people under
thirty, were seated in a room, mostly on benches placed against the
wall. Among them was Mr. Noyes himself, who sat in a large
rocking-chair. The young man to be criticized, whom I will call Charles,
sat inconspicuously in the midst of the company. When the doors were
closed, he was asked by the leader (not Mr. Noyes) whether he desired to
say any thing. Retaining his seat, he said that he had suffered for some
time past from certain intellectual difficulties and doubts—a leaning
especially toward positivism, and lack of faith; being drawn away from
God; a tendency to think religion of small moment. But that he was
combating the evil spirit within him, and hoped he had gained somewhat;
and so on.

Hereupon a man being called on to speak, remarked that he thought
Charles had been somewhat hardened by too great good-fortune; that his
success in certain enterprises had somewhat spoiled him; if he had not
succeeded so well, he would

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

have been a better man; that he was somewhat wise in his own esteem; not
given to consult with others, or to seek or take advice. One or two
other men agreed generally with the previous remarks, had noticed these
faults in Charles, and that they made him disagreeable; and gave
examples to show his faults. Another concurred in the general testimony,
but added that he thought Charles had lately made efforts to correct
some of his faults, though there was still much room for improvement.

A young woman next remarked that Charles was haughty and supercilious,
and thought himself better than others with whom he was brought into
contact; that he was needlessly curt sometimes to those with whom he had
to speak.

Another young woman added that Charles was a respecter of persons; that
he showed his liking for certain individuals too plainly by calling them
pet names before people; that he seemed to forget that such things were
disagreeable and wrong.

Another woman said that Charles was often careless in his language;
sometimes used slang words, and was apt to give a bad impression to
strangers. Also that he did not always conduct himself at table,
especially before visitors, with careful politeness and good manners.

A man concurred in this, and remarked that he had heard Charles condemn
the beefsteak on a certain occasion as tough; and had made other
unnecessary remarks about the food on the table while he was eating.

A woman remarked that she had on several occasions found Charles a
respecter of persons.

Another said that Charles, though industrious and faithful in all
temporalities, and a very able man, was not religious at all.

A man remarked that Charles was, as others had said, somewhat spoiled by
his own success, but that it was a mistake for him to be so, for he was
certain that Charles's success came

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

mainly from the wisdom and care with which the society had surrounded
him with good advisers, who had guided him; and that Charles ought
therefore to be humble, instead of proud and haughty, as one who ought
to look outside of himself for the real sources of his success.

Finally, two or three remarked that he had been in a certain transaction
insincere toward another young man, saying one thing to his face and
another to others; and in this one or two women concurred.

Amid all this very plain speaking, which I have considerably condensed,
giving only the general charges, Charles sat speechless, looking before
him; but as the accusations multiplied, his face grew paler, and drops
of perspiration began to stand on his forehead. The remarks I have
reported took up about half an hour; and now, each one in the circle
having spoken, Mr. Noyes summed up.

He said that Charles had some serious faults; that he had watched him
with some care; and that he thought the young man was earnestly trying
to cure himself. He spoke in general praise of his ability, his good
character, and of certain temptations he had resisted in the course of
his life. He thought he saw signs that Charles was making a real and
earnest attempt to conquer his faults; and as one evidence of this he
remarked that Charles had lately come to him to consult him upon a
difficult case in which he had had a severe struggle, but had in the end
succeeded in doing right. "In the course of what we call stirpiculture,"
said Noyes, "Charles, as you know, is in the situation of one who is by
and by to become a father. Under these circumstances, he has fallen
under the too common temptation of selfish love, and a desire to wait
upon and cultivate an exclusive intimacy with the woman who was to bear
a child through him. This is an insidious temptation, very apt to attack
people under such circumstances; but it must nevertheless be struggled
against." Charles, he went

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

on to say, had come to him for advice in this case, and he (Noyes) had
at first refused to tell him any thing, but had asked him what he
thought he ought to do; that after some conversation, Charles had
determined, and he agreed with him, that he ought to isolate himself
entirely from the woman, and let another man take his place at her side;
and this Charles had accordingly done, with a most praiseworthy spirit
of self-sacrifice. Charles had indeed still further taken up his cross,
as he had noticed with pleasure, by going to sleep with the smaller
children, to take charge of them during the night. Taking all this in
view, he thought Charles was in a fair way to become a better man, and
had manifested a sincere desire to improve, and to rid himself of all
selfish faults.

Thereupon the meeting was dismissed.

All that I have recited was said by practiced tongues. The people knew
very well how to express themselves. There was no vagueness, no
uncertainty. Every point was made; every sentence was a hit—a stab I was
going to say, but as the sufferer was a volunteer, I suppose this would
be too strong a word. I could see, however, that while Charles might be
benefited by the "criticism," those who spoke of him would perhaps also
be the better for their speech; for if there had been bitterness in any
of their hearts before, this was likely to be dissipated by the free
utterance. Concerning the closing remarks of Noyes, which disclose so
strange and horrible a view of morals and duty, I need say nothing.

Here are a few specimens of criticisms which have been printed in the
*Circular*. The first concerns a young woman:

"What God has done for U. is wonderful; her natural gifts and
attractions are uncommon; but she has added very little to them. She is
spoiling them by indolence and vanity. The gifts we have by nature do
not belong to us. We shall have to give account for them to God as his
property. All that we can expect any reward for is what we add to that
which he gives us."

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

The next seems to point at troubles of a kind to which the community is,
I suppose, more or less subject:

"I wish I could entirely change public opinion among us in regard to the
matter of keeping secrets. The fact that a person is of such a character
that others associated with him are afraid that he will finally expose
their wrong-doing is the highest credit to him. I would earnestly exhort
all lovers of every degree, young and old, and especially the young, to
consider the absolute impossibility of permanently keeping secrets. It
is not for us to say whether we will keep other folks' secrets or not.
It is for God to say. We are in his hands, and he will make us tell the
truth even though we say we won't. He has certainly made it his
programme and eternal purpose that every secret thing shall come to
light. What is done in darkness shall be published on the house-top.
This is sure to come, because it is God's policy, and it is vain for us
to seek to evade and thwart it. Two persons get together with shameful
secrets, and promise and protest and pledge themselves never to turn on
each other. What is the use? It is not for them to say what they will
do. They *will* finally turn on one another. It is a mercy to them that
they must. The best thing to be said of them is that they are likely to
turn on one another and betray their secrets. They will, if there is any
honesty or true purpose in them. This keeping secrets that are
dishonest, profane, and infernal, and regarding them as sacred, is all
wrong. It is the rule of friendship and honor in the world, but to let
the daylight in on every thing is the rule for those who want to please
God."

What follows relates to a man who was cast down because of criticism,
and whose fault Noyes says is excessive sensitiveness:

"Excessive sensitiveness is a great fault. Every one should strive to
get where he can judge himself, look at himself truthfully by the grace
of God, and cultivate what may be called the superior consciousness,
looking at his own fault as he would at another person's, and feeling no
more pain in dissecting his own character than he would that of any one
else. This superior consciousness takes us into fellowship with God and
his judgment; and in that condition it is possible to rejoice in pulling
to pieces our own works. Paul says: 'Other foundation can no man lay
than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this
foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every
man's work shall be made manifest—for the day shall declare it, because
it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work,
of what sort

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

it is. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer
loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.' There is a
great amount of poor building upon that good foundation; a great number
of structures that are wood, hay, and stubble, and which in the day of
fire will be burned up. The main point to be gained by those who have
thus built is to get into such sympathy with God that they can stand by
when the day of fire comes, and help on the destruction—poke the wood,
hay, and stubble into the flame, rejoicing that they have a good
foundation, and are to be saved not only from the fire, but by the
fire."

Finally, they use criticism as a remedy for diseases. I take this
example from the *Circular* for June 4, 1853:

"S. P., having a bad cold and symptoms of a run of fever, tried the
criticism-cure, and was immediately relieved. She was on the bed in a
state of pain and restlessness, when a friend mentioned to her the above
remedy as having been successfully applied in similar cases. Having some
faith in it, she arose immediately and made her wishes known to the
family physician, that is, to the *family*, who kindly administered the
remedy without delay. The operation was not particularly agreeable—there
is no method of cure that is; but it was short and speedily efficacious.
One secret of its efficacy is, it stops the flow of thought toward the
seat of difficulty, and so tends directly to reduce inflammation. At the
same time it has a very bracing, invigorating effect. In the present
case, it went right to the cause of the disease, which was discovered to
be a spirit of *fear*, throwing open the pores and predisposing the
subject to the attack. S. P. had been brought up in a bad habit in this
respect, expecting with every exposure to take cold—and then expecting
to have it go on to a serious cough, and so on—fear realizing itself.
Criticism stopped this false action, and not only made her well in the
first instance, but by breaking up this fear it has given her
comparative security against future attacks. It requires some fortitude
and self-denial in the patient, when he thinks he needs sympathy and
nursing, to take criticism instead; but it is well known that to rouse
the will to strong exertion is more than half a cure. The criticism
remedy professes to be universal, and is recommended for trial to all
the afflicted."

The *Circular* for December, 1863, reports:

"It is a common custom here for every one who may be attacked with any
disorder to apply this remedy by sending for a committee of six or

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

eight persons, in whose faith and spiritual judgment he has confidence,
to come and criticize him. The result, when administered sincerely, is
almost universally to throw the patient into a sweat, or to bring on a
reaction of his life against disease, breaking it up, and restoring him
soon to usual health. We have seen this result produced without any
other agency except the use of ice, in perhaps twenty cases of sore
throat within a few weeks. We have seen it take effect at an advanced
stage of chronic disease, and raise a person up apparently from death's
door. It seems a somewhat heroic method of treatment when a person is
suffering in body to apply a castigation to the character through the
spiritual or moral part; but this is precisely the thing needed to
cleanse and purify the system from disease. We have tried it, and found
it to be invaluable. To all who have faith in Christ as a physician we
can commend this prescription as a medium for conveying his healing
life. If you are sick, seek for some one to tell you your faults, to
find out your weakest spot in character or conduct; let them put their
finger on the very sore that you would best like to keep hid. Depend
upon it, there is the avenue through which disease gets access to you.
And if the sincerity which points this out and opens it to the light
hurts, and is mortifying for the time being, it is only a sign that the
remedy is applied at the right place and is taking effect."

In a recent number of the *Circular* (1874) a "criticism of a sick man"
is reported in full. It is too long to give here; but I quote a few of
the remarks, to show the style of attack in such cases. The report opens
with this statement:

"\[L. has been quite prostrate for months with some kind of spinal
affection, complicated with chills and fever. In presenting himself for
criticism, he was invited, as the subject generally is, to open his own
case. He said he was under a spirit of depression and discouragement,
particularly about his health. He thought he should be better off if he
did not know so much about his disease. Dr. Pope had pronounced it
incurable.\]"

*W*. said:

"I think that L. is troubled with false imaginations, and that he has
inherited this tendency. His father was subject to the hypo—always a
prey to imaginations. I question whether the root of L.'s whole
difficulty does not lie in his imagination. I don't doubt but that he
feels what he

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

thinks he does, but imagination has terrible power to make us feel.
Christ can cast down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth
itself against the knowledge of God."

*J*. said:

"He talks a great deal about his symptoms. If he would talk on the side
of faith, I think he would be a well man right off. He is as well as any
body when he *is* well, and there is no reason why he should not be well
all the time. He is a very valuable member of the community, and I don't
like to see him lie on his back so much.

"*M*.—I have thought that his knowledge of physiology, as he uses it, is
really a hindrance to him: he knows too much about his case.

"*C*.—I thought I had the heart disease when I was about nineteen years
of age. My heart would beat so when I went up stairs that I had to sit
down at the top. I remember that I said to my aunt one day I was sure
that I had got that disease, because my heart had such times of beating.
'O la!' she answered,' I guess you would not live long if it did not
beat.'

"*N*. \[probably Mr. Noyes\]—I have good reason to believe that a great
many diseases which doctors pronounce incurable are so so far as their
powers are concerned, and yet can be cured by exorcism. Doctors do not
believe in possession by the devil, and of course have no means of
curing diseases of that nature. They accordingly pronounce some diseases
incurable. Yet these diseases are not incurable by persons who
understand the nature of them, and that they are spiritual obsessions. I
do not care what the doctors say about L.'s back. It is very likely
incurable so far as they know, and yet it may be very easily curable to
any body who knows about the doctrine of the possession of the devil.
There is a range of science beyond the routine of the doctors which we
must take into the account in all this dealing with disease. Just look
at the case of Harriet Hall, and see what incurable diseases she had.
Two doctors certified that she ought to be dead twenty years ago, and
here she is alive and waiting on her father. Those doctors are dead, and
she is trotting around.

"*E*.—I have been associated a good deal with L. in business and now in
this sickness. I have studied his case some. His attitude toward disease
is very much like his attitude in business. When he has been well and
able to do his best, he has been in the past an autocrat in our
businesses. If he said a thing would not go, or would go, his dictum was
always accepted. He has a good deal of pride in having what he predicts
turn out to be true. I have sometimes thought that he was willing to

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

have things break down in order to demonstrate his infallibility as an
oracle. He shows the same trait in regard to disease. If he has a
symptom, and makes up his mind that he is going to have a certain
disease, he notifies his friends of it, and seems bound to have his
prophecy come true any way.

"*N*.—He would rather have a good chill, I suppose, than have his
prediction prove false.

"*E*.—I think he really knows but very little about his case. He lost
his health, and took up the study of medicine to find out what ailed
him. It may seem paradoxical, but I think that he is suffering for want
of work; his brain is suffering for want of some healthy action. If he
would use his brain about something for only half an hour a day, he
would find himself improving right along.

"*A*.—I remember L. had the reputation of being an ingenious boy; but he
used to seem old even then—he had the rheumatism or some such complaint.
In thinking about him, it seems to me that the instinct of his life is
to find a soft place in the world: he is hunting up cushions and soft
things to surround himself with. His bent is rather scientific than
religious. A man that is an oracle surrounds himself with something soft
in having people defer to him. I must say I think he is too oracular
about disease, considering the amount of study he has given to the
science of medicine. He went into the study of medicine in a sort of
self-coddling way, to find out what the matter was with himself. I have
realized that it is not good for a man in this world to hunt for a soft
spot."

And so on. Mr. Noyes closed the session with this remark:

"*N*.—Christ's words, 'Because I live ye shall live also,' may be thrust
in the face of all incurable diseases. There is no answer to that. No
incurable disease can stand against it."

I do not know whether L. recovered or not.

On Sunday evening, about half-past six o'clock, there was a gathering in
the large hall to hear some pieces of music from the orchestra. After
half an hour's intermission, the people again assembled, this time for a
longer session. A considerable number of round tables were scattered
about the large hall; on these were lamps; and around them sat most of
the women, old and young, with sewing or knitting, with which they
busied

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

themselves during the meeting. Others sat on benches and chairs,
irregularly ranged about.

After the singing of a hymn, a man rose and read the report of the
business meeting held that morning, the appointment of some committees,
and so on; and this was then put to vote and accepted, having elicited
no discussion, and very little interest apparently. Next a man, who sat
near Mr. Noyes in the middle of the room, read some extracts from
newspapers, which had been marked and sent in to him by different
members for that purpose. Some of these were mere drolleries, and raised
laughter. Others concerned practical matters.

To this reading, which was brief, followed a discussion of the power of
healing disease by prayer. It was asserted to be "necessary to regard
Christ as powerful to-day over diseases of the body as well as of the
spirit." When several had spoken very briefly upon this subject, and the
conversation was evidently closed, a considerable number of the people
concurred in what had been said by short ejaculations, as "I confess the
power of Christ in my heart;" "I confess the power of healing;" "I
confess to a tender conscience;" "I confess Christ;" "I confess a love
for all good people," and so on.

Next a hymn was sung relating to community life, which I copy here as a
curiosity:

  "Let us sing, brothers, sing,  
  In the Eden of heart-love—  
  Where the fruits of life spring,  
  And no death e'er can part love;  
  Where the pure currents flow  
  From all gushing hearts together,  
  And the wedding of the Lamb  
  Is the feast of joy forever.  
  Let us sing, brothers, sing.

  "We have built us a dome  
  On our beautiful plantation,  
  And we all have one home,  
  And one family relation; <span id="page_300">p. 300</span>  
  We have battled with the wiles  
  Of the dark world of Mammon,  
  And returned with its spoils  
  To the home of our dear ones.  
  Let us sing, brothers, sing.

  "When the rude winds of wrath  
  Idly rave round our dwelling,  
  And the slanderer's breath  
  Like a simoon was swelling,  
  Then so merrily we sung,  
  As the storm blustered o'er us,  
  Till the very heavens rung  
  With our hearts' joyful chorus.  
  Let us go, brothers, go.

  "So love's sunshine begun:  
  Now the spirit-flowers are blooming,  
  And the feeling that we're one  
  All our hearts is perfuming;  
  Toward one home we have all  
  Set our faces together,  
  Where true love doth dwell  
  In peace and joy forever.  
  Let us sing, brothers, sing."

This was presently followed by another song peculiar to the Oneida
people. A man sang, looking at a woman near him:

  "I love you, O my sister,  
  But the love of God is better;  
  Yes, the love of God is better—  
  O the love of God is best."

To this she replied:

  "I love you, O my brother,  
  But the love of God is better;  
  Yes, the love of God is better—  
  O the love of God is best."

Then came the chorus, in which a number of voices joined:

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

  "Yes, the love of God is better,  
  O the love of God is better;  
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah—  
  Yes, the love of God is best."

Soon after the meeting broke up; but there was more singing, later, in
the private parlors, which I did not attend. Thus ended Sunday at the
Oneida Community; and with this picture of their daily life I may
conclude my account of these people.
