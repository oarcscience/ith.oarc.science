#### SHAKER LITERATURE, SPIRITUALISM, ETC.

"It should be distinctly understood that special inspired gifts have not
ceased, but still continue among this people:" so reads a brief note to
the Preface of "Christ's First and Second Appearing," the edition of
1854.

In the "Testimonies concerning the Character and Ministry of Mother Ann
Lee," a considerable number of her followers who had known her
personally, being her contemporaries, relate particulars of her teaching
and conduct, and not a few give instances of so-called miraculous cures
of diseases or injuries, performed by her upon themselves or others.

The hymns or "spiritual songs" they sing are said by the Shakers to be
brought to them, almost without exception, from the "spirit-land;" and
the airs to which these songs are sung are believed to come from the
same source. There are, however,

two collections of Hymns, to most of whose contents this origin is not
attributed, though even in these some of the hymns purport to have been
"given by inspiration."

In the older of these collections, "A Selection of Hymns and Poems for
the Use of Believers," printed at Watervliet, in Ohio, 1833, one can
trace some of the earlier trials of the societies, and the evils they
had to contend with within themselves. The Western societies, for
instance, appear to have early opposed the drinking of intoxicating
beverages. Here is a rhyme, dated 1817, which appeals to the members in
the cause of total abstinence:

  "From all intoxicating drink  
  Ancient Believers did abstain;  
  Then say, good brethren, do you think  
  That such a cross was all in vain?

  "Inebriation, we allow,  
  First paved the way for am'rous deeds;  
  Then why should poisonous spirits now  
  Be ranked among our common needs?

  "As an apothecary drug,  
  Its wondrous virtues some will plead;  
  And hence we find the stupid *Slug*  
  A morning dram does often need.

  "Fatigue or want of appetite  
  At noon will crave a little more,  
  And so the same complaints at night  
  Are just as urgent as before.

  "By want of sleep, and this and that,  
  His thirst for liquor is increased;  
  Till he becomes a bloated sot—  
  The very scarlet-colored beast.

  "Why, then, should any soul insist  
  On such pernicious, pois'nous stuff?  
  Malignant *spirits*, you're dismissed!  
  You have possessed us long enough."

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

As a note to this temperance rhyme, stands the following:

"CH. RULE.—All spirituous liquors should be kept under care of the
nurses, that no drams in any case whatever should be dispensed to
persons in common health, and that frivolous excuses of being unwell
should not be admitted. Union Village, 1826."

"Slug," in the third of the preceding verses, seems to have been a cant
term among the early Shakers for a sluggard and selfish fellow, a kind
of creature they have pretty thoroughly extirpated; and presumably by
such free speech as is used in the following amusing rhymes:

  "The depth of language I have dug  
  To show the meaning of a Slug;  
  And must conclude, upon the whole,  
  It means a stupid, lifeless soul,  
  Whose object is to live at ease,  
  And his own carnal nature please;  
  Who always has some selfish quirk,  
  In sleeping, eating, and at work.

  "A lazy fellow it implies,  
  Who in the morning hates to rise;  
  When all the rest are up at four,  
  He wants to sleep a little more.  
  When others into meeting swarm,  
  He keeps his nest so good and warm,  
  That sometimes when the sisters come  
  To make the beds and sweep the room,  
  Who do they find wrap'd up so snug?  
  Ah! who is it but Mr. Slug.

  "A little cold or aching head  
  Will send him grunting to his bed,  
  And he'll pretend he's sick or sore,  
  Just that he may indulge the more.  
  Nor would it feel much like a crime  
  If he should sleep one half his time. <span id="page_217">p.
217</span>

  "When he gets up, before he's dress'd  
  He's so fatigued he has to rest;  
  And half an hour he'll keep his chair  
  Before he takes the morning air.  
  He'll sit and smoke in calm repose  
  Until the trump for breakfast blows—  
  His breakfast-time at length is past,  
  And he must wait another blast;  
  So at the sound of the last shell,  
  He takes his seat and all is well."

"Slug" at the table is thus satirized:

  "To save his credit, you must know  
  That poor old Slug eats very slow;  
  And as in justice he does hate  
  That all the rest on him should wait,  
  Sometimes he has to rise and kneel  
  Before he has made out his meal.  
  Then to make up what he has miss'd,  
  He takes a luncheon in his fist,  
  Or turns again unto the dish,  
  And fully satisfies his wish;  
  Or, if it will not answer then,  
  He'll make it up at half-past ten.

  "Again he thinks it quite too soon  
  To eat his dinner all at noon,  
  But as the feast is always free,  
  He takes a snack at half-past three.  
  He goes to supper with the rest,  
  But, lest his stomach be oppress'd,  
  He saves at least a piece of bread  
  Till just before he goes to bed;  
  So last of all the wretched Slug  
  Has room to drive another plug.

  "To fam'ly order he's not bound,  
  But has his springs of union round;  
  And kitchen sisters ev'ry where  
  Know how to please him to a hair: <span id="page_218">p. 218</span>  
  Sometimes his errand they can guess,  
  If not, he can his wants express;  
  Nor from old Slug can they get free  
  Without a cake or dish of tea."

"Slug" at work, or pretending to work, gets a fling also:

  "When call'd to work you'll always find  
  The lazy fellow lags behind—  
  He has to smoke or end his chat,  
  Or tie his shoes, or hunt his hat:  
  So all the rest are busy found  
  Before old Slug gets on the ground;  
  Then he must stand and take his wind  
  Before he's ready to begin,  
  And ev'ry time he straights his back  
  He's sure to have some useless clack;  
  And tho' all others hate the Slug,  
  With folded arms himself he'll hug.

  "When he conceits meal-time is near,  
  He listens oft the trump to hear;  
  And when it sounds, it is his rule  
  The first of all to drop his tool;  
  And if he's brisk in any case,  
  It will be in his homeward pace."

Here, too, is a picture of "Slug" shirking his religious duties:

  "In his devotions he is known  
  To be the same poor lazy drone:  
  The sweetest songs Believers find  
  Make no impression on his mind;  
  And round the fire he'd rather nod  
  Than labor in the works of God.

  "Some vain excuse he'll often plead  
  That he from worship may be freed—  
  He's bruis'd his heel or stump'd his toe,  
  And cannot into meeting go;  
  And if he comes he's half asleep,  
  That no good fruit from him we reap: <span id="page_219">p.
219</span>  
  He'll labor out a song or two,  
  And so conclude that that will do;  
  \[And, lest through weariness he fall,  
  He'll brace himself against the wall\],  
  And well the faithful may give thanks  
  That poor old Slug has quit the ranks.

  "When the spectators are address'd,  
  Then is the time for Slug to rest—  
  From his high lot he can't be hurl'd,  
  To feel toward the wicked world;  
  So he will sit with closed eyes  
  Until the congregation rise;  
  And when the labor we commence,  
  He moves with such a stupid sense—  
  It often makes spectators stare  
  To see so dead a creature there."

The satire closes with a hit at "Slug's" devotion to tobacco:

  "Men of sound reason use their pipes  
  For colics, pains, and windy gripes;  
  And smoking's useful, we will own,  
  To give the nerves and fluids tone;  
  But poor old Slug has to confess  
  He uses it to great excess,  
  And will indulge his appetite  
  Beyond his reason and his light.  
  If others round him do abstain,  
  It keeps him all the time in pain;  
  And if a sentence should be spoke  
  Against his much-beloved smoke,  
  Tho' it be in the way of joke,  
  He thinks his union's almost broke.  
  In all such things he's at a loss,  
  Because he thinks not of the cross,  
  But yields himself a willing slave  
  To what his meaner passions crave.

  "This stupid soul in all his drift  
  Is still behind the proper gift— <span id="page_220">p. 220</span>  
  With other souls he don't unite,  
  Nor is he zealous to do right.  
  Among Believers he's a drug,  
  And ev'ry elder hates a Slug.

  "When long forbearance is the theme,  
  A warm believer he would seem—  
  For diff'rent tastes give gen'rous scope,  
  And he is full of faith and hope;  
  But talk about some good church rule,  
  And his high zeal you'll quickly cool.  
  Indulge him, then, in what is wrong,  
  And Slug will try to move along;  
  Nor will he his own state mistrust,  
  Until he gets so full of lust  
  His cross he will no longer tug,  
  Then to the world goes poor old Slug."

"Hoggish nature" comes in for a share of denunciation next in these
lines:

  "In the increasing work of the gospel we find,  
  The old hoggish nature we will have to bind—  
  To starve the old glutton, and leave him to shift,  
  Till in union with heaven we eat in a gift.

  "What Father will teach me, I'll truly obey;  
  I'll keep Mother's counsel, and not go astray;  
  Then plagues and distempers they will have to cease,  
  In all that live up to the gospel's increase.

  "The glutton's a seat in which evil can work,  
  And in hoggish nature diseases will lurk:  
  By faith and good works we can all overcome,  
  And starve the old glutton until he is done.

  "But while he continues to guzzle and eat,  
  All kinds of distempers will still find a seat—  
  The plagues of old Egypt—the scab and the bile,  
  At which wicked spirits and devils will smile.

  "Now some can despise the good porridge and soup,  
  And by the old glutton they surely are dup'd—  
  To eat seven times in a day! What a mess!  
  I hate the old glutton for his hoggishness. <span id="page_221">p.
221</span>

  "No wonder that plagues and distempers abound,  
  While there is a glutton in camp to be found,  
  To spurn at the counsel kind Heaven did give—  
  And guzzle up all, and have nothing to save.

  "When glutton goes in and sits down with the rest,  
  His hoggish old nature it grabs for the best—  
  The cake and the custard, the crull and the pie—  
  He cares not for others, but takes care of I.

  "His stomach is weak, being gorg'd on the best,  
  He has had sev'ral pieces secret from the rest;  
  He'll fold up his arms, at the rest he will look,  
  Because they do eat the good porridge and soup.

  "Now all that are wise they will never be dup'd;  
  They'll feed the old glutton on porridge and soup,  
  Until he is willing to eat like the rest,  
  And not hunt the kitchen to find out the best.

  "We'll strictly observe what our good parents teach:  
  Not pull the green apple, nor hog <span id="fr_22"></span>[\*](#fn_22.md)
in the peach;  
  We'll starve the old glutton, and send him adrift;  
  Then like good Believers we'll eat in a gift."

Following these verses are some reflections, concluding:

  "Away with the sluggard, the glutton, and beast,  
  For none but the bee and the dove  
  Can truly partake of this heavenly feast,  
  Which springs from the fountains of love."

Obedience to the elders and ministry also appears to have been difficult
to bring about, for several verses in this collection inculcate this
duty. In one, called "Gospel-virtues illustrated," an old man is made
the speaker, in these words:

  "Now eighteen hundred seventeen—  
  Where am I now? where have I been?  
  My age about threescore and three,  
  Then surely thankful I will be. <span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

  "I thank my parents for my home,  
  I thank good Elder Solomon,  
  I thank kind Eldress Hortency,  
  And Eldress Rachel kind and free.

  "Good Elder Peter with the rest—  
  By his good works we all are blest;  
  His righteous works are plainly shown—  
  I thank him kindly for my home.

  "From the beginning of this year,  
  A faithful cross I mean to bear,  
  To ev'ry order I'll subject,  
  And all my teachers I'll respect.

  "With ev'ry gift I will unite—  
  They are all good and just and right;  
  If mortifying they do come,  
  I'll still be thankful for my home.

  "When I'm chastis'd I'll not complain,  
  Tho' my old nature suffer pain;  
  Tho' it should come so sharp and hot,  
  Even to slay me on the spot.

  "I will no longer use deceit,  
  I will abhor the hypocrite;  
  His forged lies I now will hate—  
  His portion is the burning lake.

  "My vile affections they shall die,  
  And ev'ry lust I'll crucify;  
  I'll labor to be clean and pure,  
  And to the end I will endure.

  "Th' adulterous eye shall now be blind—  
  It shall not feed the carnal mind;  
  My looks and conduct shall express  
  That holy faith that I possess.

  "I will not murmur, 'tis not right,  
  About my clothing or my diet,  
  For surely those who have the care,  
  Will give to each their equal share. <span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

  "I will take care and not dictate  
  The fashion of my coat or hat;  
  But meet the gift as it may come,  
  And still be thankful for my home.

  "I will be careful and not waste  
  That which is good for man or beast;  
  Or any thing that we do use—  
  No horse or ox will I abuse.

  "I will be simple as a child;  
  I'll labor to be meek and mild;  
  In this good work my time I'll spend,  
  And with my tongue I'll not offend."

Again, in "Repentance and Confession," a sinner confesses his misdeeds
in such words as these:

  "But still there's more crowds on my mind  
  And blacker than the rest—  
  They look more dark and greater crimes  
  Than all that I've confess'd  
  With tattling tongues and lying lips  
  I've often bore a part:  
  I frankly own I've made some slips  
  To give a lie a start.

  "But worse than that I've tri'd to do,  
  When darken'd in my mind;  
  I've tri'd to be a Deist too—  
  That nothing was divine.  
  But O, good elders, pray for me!  
  The worst is yet behind—  
  I've talk'd against the ministry,  
  With malice in my mind.

  "O Lord forgive! for mercy's sake,  
  And leave me not behind;  
  For surely I was not awake,  
  Else I had been consign'd.  
  Good ministry, can you forgive,  
  And elders one and all?  
  And, brethren, may I with you live,  
  And be the least of all?"

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

In "A Solemn Warning" there is a caution against the wiles of Satan, who
tries Believers with a spirit of discontent:

  "This cunning deceiver can't touch a Believer,  
  Unless he can get them first tempted to taste  
  Some carnal affection, or fleshly connection,  
  And little by little their power to waste.  
  The first thing is blinding, before undermining,  
  Or else the discerning would shun the vile snare;—  
  Thus Satan hath frosted and artfully blasted  
  Some beautiful blossoms that promis'd most fair.

  "This wily soul-taker and final peace-breaker  
  May take the unwary before they suspect,  
  And get them to hearken to that which will darken,  
  And next will induce them their faith to reject;  
  He'll tell you subjection affords no protection—  
  These things you've been tau't are but notions at best;  
  Reject your protection, and break your connection,  
  And all you call'd faith you may scorn and detest."

"The Last Woe" denounces various sins of the congregation:

  "In your actions unclean, you are openly seen,  
  And this truth you may ever remark,  
  That in anguish and woe, to the saints you must go,  
  And confess what you've done in the dark.

  "From restraint you are free, and no danger you see,  
  Till the sound of the trumpet comes in,  
  Crying 'Woe to your lust—it must go to the dust,  
  With the unfruitful pleasures of sin.'

  "And a woe to the liar—he is doom'd to the fire,  
  Until all his dark lies are confess'd—  
  Till he honestly tell, what a spirit from hell  
  Had its impious seat in his breast.

  "And a woe to the thief, without any relief—  
  He is sentenc'd in body and soul,  
  To confess with his tongue, and restore ev'ry wrong,  
  What he ever has robbed or stole. <span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

  "Tho' the sinner may plead, that it was not decreed  
  For a man to take up a full cross,  
  Yet in hell he must burn, or repent and return,  
  And be say'd from the nature of loss."

In the following "Dialogue" "confession of sins" is urged and enforced:

"*Q*. Why did you choose this way you're in, which all mankind despise?

*A*. It was to save my soul from sin, and gain a heav'nly prize.

*Q*. But could you find no other way, that would have done as well?

*A*. Nay, any other way but this would lead me down to hell.

*Q*. Well, tell me how did you begin to purge away your dross?

*A*. By honestly confessing sin, and taking up my cross.

*Q*. Was it before the Son of man you brought your deeds to light?

*A*. That was the mortifying plan, and surely it was right.

*Q*. But did you not keep something back, or did you tell the whole?

*A*. I told it all, however black—I fully freed my soul.

*Q*. Do you expect to persevere, and ev'ry evil shun?

*A*. My daily cross I mean to bear, until the work is done.

*Q*. Well, is it now your full intent all damage to restore?

*A*. If any man I've wrong'd a cent, I'll freely give him four.

*Q*. And what is now the greatest foe with which you mean to war?

*A*. The cursed flesh—'tis that, you know, all faithful souls abhor.

*Q*. Have you none of its sly deceit now lurking in your breast?

*A*. I say there's nothing on my mind but what I have confess'd.

*Q*. Well, what you have proclaim'd abroad, if by your works you show,
You are prepar'd to worship God, so, at, it, you, may, go."

"The Steamboat" seems to me a characteristic rhyme, which no doubt came
home to Believers on the western rivers, when they were plagued with
doubters and cold-hearted adherents:

  "While our steamboat, Self-denial,  
  Rushes up against the stream,  
  Is it not a serious trial  
  Of the pow'r of gospel steam? <span id="page_226">p. 226</span>  
  When Self-will, and Carnal Pleasure,  
  And Freethinker, all afloat,  
  Come down snorting with such pressure,  
  Right against our little boat.

  "Were there not some carnal creatures  
  Mixed with the pure and clean,  
  When we meet those gospel-haters,  
  We might pass and not be seen;  
  But the smell of kindred senses  
  Brings them on us fair broadside,  
  Then the grappling work commences—  
  They must have a fair divide.

  "All who choose the tide of nature,  
  Freely take the downward way;  
  But the doubtful hesitater  
  Dare not go, yet hates to stay.  
  To the flesh still claiming kindred,  
  And their faith still hanging to—  
  Thus we're held and basely hinder'd,  
  By a double-minded few.

  "Wretched souls, while hesitating  
  Where to fix your final claim,  
  Don't you see our boiler heating,  
  With a more effectual flame!—When  
  the steam comes on like thunder,  
  And the wheels begin to play,  
  Must you not be torn asunder,  
  And swept off the downward way?

  "Tho' Self-will and Carnal Reason,  
  Independence, Lust, and Pride,  
  May retard us for a season,  
  Saint and sinner must divide;  
  When releas'd from useless lumber—  
  When the fleshly crew is gone—  
  With our little faithful number,  
  O how swiftly we'll move on!"

The "Covenant Hymn" was publicly sung in some of the Western societies,
"so that no room was left for any to say

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

that the Covenant \[by which they agree to give up all property and
labor for the general use\] was not well understood." I quote here
several verses:

  "You have parents in the Lord, you honor and esteem,  
  But your equals to regard a greater cross may seem.  
  Where the gift of God you see,  
  Can you consent that it should reign?  
  Yea I can, and all that's free may jointly say—Amen.

  "Can you part with all you've got, and give up all concern,  
  And be faithful in your lot, the way of God to learn?  
  Can you sacrifice your ease,  
  And take your share of toil and pain?  
  Yea I can, and all that please may freely say—Amen.

  "Can you into union flow, and have your will subdu'd?  
  Let your time and talents go, to serve the gen'ral good?  
  Can you swallow such a pill—  
  To count old Adam's loss your gain?  
  Yea I can, and yea I will, and all may say—Amen.

  "I set out to bear my cross, and this I mean to do:  
  Let old Adam kick and toss, his days will be but few.  
  We're devoted to the Lord,  
  And from the flesh we will be free;  
  Then we'll say with one accord—Amen, so let it be."

It is evident from these verses that the early Shakers had among them
men who at least could make the rhymes run glibly, and who besides had a
gift of plain speech. Here, for instance, is a denunciation of a
scandal-monger:

  "In the Church of Christ and Mother,  
  Carnal feelings have no place;  
  Here the simple love each other,  
  Free from ev'ry thing that's base.  
  Therefore when the flesh is named,  
  When impeachments fly around,  
  Honest souls do feel ashamed—  
  Shudder at the very sound. <span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

  "Ah! thou foul and filthy stranger!  
  What canst thou be after here?  
  Thou wilt find thyself in danger,  
  If thou dost not disappear.  
  Vanish quick, I do advise you!  
  For we mean to let you know  
  Good Believers do despise you,  
  As a dang'rous, deadly foe.

  "Dare you, in the sight of heaven,  
  Show your foul and filthy pranks?  
  Can a place to you be given  
  In the bright angelic ranks?  
  Go! I say, thou unclean devil!  
  Go from this redeemed soil,  
  If you think you cannot travel  
  Through a lake of boiling oil."

In those earlier days, as in these, idle persons seem to have troubled
the Shakers with the question "What would become of the world if all
turned Shakers," to which here is a sharp reply:

  "The multiplication of the old creation  
  They're sure to hold forth as a weighty command;  
  And what law can hinder old Adam to gender,  
  And propagate men to replenish the land?  
  But truly he never obey'd the lawgiver,  
  For when the old serpent had open'd his eyes,  
  He sought nothing greater than just to please nature,  
  And work like a serpent in human disguise."

"Steeple houses" are as hateful to the Shakers as to the Quakers and the
Inspirationists of Amana, and they are excluded in an especial manner
from the Shakers' Paradise:

  "No sin can ever enter here—  
  Nor sinners rear a steeple;  
  'Tis kept by God's peculiar care,  
  For his peculiar people. <span id="page_229">p. 229</span>  
  One faith, one union, and one Lord,  
  One int'rest all combining,  
  Believers all, with one accord,  
  In heav'nly concert joining.

  "Far as the gospel spirit reigns,  
  Our souls are in communion;  
  From Alfred to South Union's plains,  
  We feel our love and union.  
  Here we may walk in peace and love,  
  With God and saints uniting;  
  While angels, smiling from above,  
  To glory are inviting."

Occasionally the book from which I am quoting gives one of those lively
brief verses to which the Shaker congregation marches, with clapping
hands and skipping feet; as these, for instance:

  "I mean to be obedient,  
  And cross my ugly nature,  
  And share the blessings that are sent  
  To ev'ry honest creature;  
  With ev'ry gift I will unite,  
  And join in sweet devotion—  
  To worship God is my delight,  
  With hands and feet in motion."

  "Come, let us all be marching on,  
  Into the New Jerusalem;  
  The call is now to ev'ry one  
  To be alive and moving.  
  This precious call we will obey—  
  We love to march the heav'nly way,  
  And in it we can dance and play,  
  And feel our spirits living."

In the newer collection, entitled "Millennial Hymns, adapted to the
present Order of the Church," and printed at Canterbury, New Hampshire,
in 1847, a change is noticeable. The hymns are more devotional and less
energetic. There are many praises of Mother Ann—such lines as these:

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

  "O Mother, blest Mother! to thee I will bow;  
  Thou art a kind Mother, thou dost teach us how  
  Salvation is gained, and how to increase  
  In purity, union, in order and peace.

  "I love thee, O Mother; thy praise I will sound—  
  I'll bless thee forever for what I have found,  
  I'll praise and adore thee, to thee bow and bend,  
  For Mother, dear Mother, thou art my known friend."

Or these:

  "I will walk in true obedience, I will be a child of love;  
  And in low humiliation I will praise my God above.  
  I will love my blessed Mother, and obey her holy word,  
  In submission to my elders, this will join me to the Lord.

  "I will stand when persecution doth around like billows roll;  
  I will bow in true subjection, and my carnal will control.  
  I will stand a firm believer in the way and work of God,  
  Doubts and fears shall never, never in me find a safe abode.

  "When temptations do surround me, floods of evil ebb and flow,  
  Then in true humiliation I will bow exceeding low.  
  I will fear the God of heaven, I will keep his holy laws,  
  Treasure up his blessings given in this pure and holy cause.

  "Tho' beset by wicked spirits, men and devils all combin'd,  
  Yet my Mother's love will save me if in faithfulness I stand:  
  No infernal crooked creature can destroy or harm my soul,  
  If I keep the love of Mother and obey her holy call."

Or this hymn, which is called "Parents' Blessing:

  "My Father does love me, my Mother also  
  Does send me her love, and I now feel it flow;  
  These heavenly Parents are kind unto me,  
  And by their directions my soul is set free.

  "They fill up my vessel with power and strength—  
  Yea, make my cross easy, my peace of great length;  
  My joy fall and perfect, my trouble but light,  
  My gifts very many in which I delight. <span id="page_231">p.
231</span>

  "I truly feel thankful for what I receive,  
  In each holy promise I surely believe;  
  They're able and willing to do all they've said,  
  And by my kind Parents I choose to be led.

  "I love to feel simple, I love to feel low,  
  I love to be kept in the path I should go;  
  I love to be taught by my heavenly lead,  
  That I may be holy and perfect indeed."

I add another, which has the lively, quick rhythm in which the Shakers
delight. It is called "Wisdom's Path:

  "I'll learn to walk in wisdom's ways,  
  And in her path I'll spend my days;  
  I'll learn to do what Mother says  
  And follow her example.  
  All pride and lust this will subdue,  
  And every hateful passion too;  
  This will destroy old Satan's crew  
  That's seated in the temple.

  "Come, honest souls, let us unite  
  And keep our conscience clear and white,  
  For surely Mother does delight  
  To own and bless her children.  
  In Father's word let us go on,  
  And bear our cross and do no wrong,  
  In faith and love then we'll be strong  
  To conquer every evil.

  "For love and union is our stay,  
  We'll be strong and keep it day by day;  
  Then we shall never go astray,  
  We'll gain more love and union.  
  Obedience will still increase,  
  And every evil work will cease,  
  We'll gain a true and solid peace,  
  We'll live in Mother's union."

I make no excuse for these quotations of Shaker hymns, for the books
from which they are taken have been seen by very

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

few outside of the order, and not even by all its members, as they are
not now in common use.

The Shakers have always professed to have intimate intercourse with the
"spirit world." Elder Frederick Evans says in his autobiography that
from the beginning the exercises in Shaker meetings were "singing and
dancing, shaking, turning, and shouting, *speaking with new tongues and
prophesying*." Elder Frederick himself, as he remarks, "was converted to
Shakerism in 1830 by spiritual manifestations," having "visions" for
three weeks, which converted him, as he relates, from materialism. He
adds:

"In 1837 to 1844 there was an influx from the 'spirit world,'
'confirming the faith of many disciples' who had lived among Believers
for years, and extending throughout all the eighteen societies, making
media by the dozen, whose various exercises, not to be suppressed even
in their public meetings, rendered it imperatively necessary to close
them all to the world during a period of seven years, in consequence of
the then unprepared state of the people, to which the whole of the
manifestations, and the meetings too, would have been as unadulterated
'foolishness,' or as inexplicable mysteries."

In a recent number of the *Shaker and Shakeress* (1874), Elder James S.
Prescott, of the North Union Society, gave a curious account of the
first appearance of this phenomenon at that place, from which I quote
what follows:

"It was in the year 1838, in the latter part of summer, some young
sisters were walking together on the bank of the creek, not far from the
hemlock grove, west of what is called the Mill Family, where they heard
some beautiful singing, which seemed to be in the air just above their
heads.

"They were taken by surprise, listened with admiration, and then
hastened home to report the phenomenon. Some of them afterwards were
chosen mediums for the 'spirits.' We had been informed, by letter, that
there was a marvelous work going on in some of the Eastern societies,
particularly at Mt. Lebanon, New York, and Watervliet, near Albany. And
when it reached us in the West we should all know it,

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

and we did know it; in the progress of the work, every individual, from
the least to the greatest, did know that there was a heart-searching God
in Israel, who ruled in the armies of heaven, and will yet rule among
the inhabitants of earth.

"It commenced among the little girls in the children's order, who were
assembled in an upper room, the doors being shut, holding a meeting by
themselves, when the invisibles began to make themselves known. It was
on the Sabbath-day, while engaged in our usual exercises, that a
messenger came in and informed the elders in great haste that there was
something uncommon going on in the girls' department. The elders brought
our meeting to a close as soon as circumstances would admit, and went
over to witness the singular and strange phenomena.

"When we entered the apartment, we saw that the girls were under the
influence of a power not their own—they were hurried round the room,
back and forth as swiftly as if driven by the wind—and no one could stop
them. If any attempts were made in that direction, it was found
impossible, showing conclusively that they were under a controlling
influence that was irresistible. Suddenly they were prostrated upon the
floor, apparently unconscious of what was going on around them. With
their eyes closed, muscles strained, joints stiff, they were taken up
and laid upon beds, mattresses, etc.

"They then began holding converse with their guardian spirits and
others, some of whom they once knew in the form, making graceful motions
with their hands—talking audibly, so that all in the room could hear and
understand, and form some idea of their whereabouts in the spiritual
realms they were exploring in the land of souls. This was only the
beginning of a series of 'spirit manifestations,' the most remarkable we
ever expected to witness on the earth. One prominent feature of these
manifestations was the gift of songs, hymns, and anthems—new, heavenly,
and melodious. The first inspired song we ever heard from the 'spirit
world,' with words attached, was the following, sung by one of the young
sisters, while in vision, with great power and demonstration of the
spirit, called by the invisible.

"'THE SONG OF A HERALD.

"'Prepare, O ye faithful,   To fight the good fight;  
  Sing, O ye redeemed,  
  Who walk in the light.  
  Come low, O ye haughty,  
  Come down, and repent.  
  Disperse, O ye naughty,  
  Who will not relent. <span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

"'For Mother is coming—   Oh, hear the glad sound—  
  To comfort her children  
  Wherever they're found;  
  With jewels and robes of fine linen  
  To clothe the afflicted withal.'

"Given by inspiration, at North Union, August, 1838, ten years prior to
the Rochester Rappings.'

"The gifts continued increasing among the children. Among these were the
gift of tongues, visiting the different cities in the 'spirit world,'
holding converse with the indwellers thereof, some of whom they once
knew in the body. And in going to these cities they were accompanied by
their guardian angels, and appeared to be flying, using their hands and
arms for wings, moving with as much velocity as the wings of a bird.

"All of a sudden they stopped, and the following questions and answers
were uttered through their vocal organism: *Question*—What city is this?
*Answer*—'The City of Delight.' *Question*—Who live here? *Answer*—The
colored population. *Question*—Can we go in and see them?
*Answer*—Certainly. For this purpose you were conducted here. They were
admitted, their countenances changed. *Question*—Who are all these?
*Answer*—They are those who were once slaves in the United States.
*Question*—Who are those behind them? *Answer*—They are those who were
once slaveholders. *Question*—What are they doing here? *Answer*—Serving
the slaves, as the slaves served them while in the earth life. God is
just; all wrongs have to be righted. *Question*—Who are those in the
corner? *Answer*—They are those slaveholders who were unmerciful, and
abused their slaves in the world, and are too proud to comply with the
conditions. *Question*—What were the conditions? *Answer*—To make
confession and ask forgiveness of the slaves, and right their wrongs;
and this they are too proud to do. *Question*—What will be done with
them? *Answer*—When their time expires they will be taken away and cast
out, and will have to suffer until they repent; for all wrongs must be
righted, either in the form or among the disembodied spirits, before
souls can be happy. And when the girls came out of vision, they would
relate the same things, which, corresponded with what they had
previously talked out.

"Now, we will leave the girls for the present and go into the boys'
department. Here we find them holding meetings by themselves, under

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

the safe guidance of their care-takers, going in vision, some boys and
some girls, for the work had progressed so as to reach adults, and all
were called immediately into the work whose physical organizations would
possibly admit of mediumship. The peculiar gift at this time was in
visiting the different cities in the 'spirit world,' and in renewing
acquaintances with many of their departed friends and relatives, who
were the blissful and happy residents therein.

"But before we go any further we will let our mediums describe the first
city they came to after crossing the river.

"*Question*—'What city is this?' *Answer*—'The Blue City.'
*Question*—'Who lives here?' *Answer*—'The Indians.' *Question*—'What
Indians?' *Answer*—'The American Indians.' *Question*—'Why are they the
first city we come to in the spirit-land, on the plane, and most
accessible?' *Answer*—'Because the Indians lived more in accordance with
the law of nature in their earth life, according to their knowledge, and
were the most abused class by the whites except the slaves, and many of
them now are in advance of the whites in 'spirituality,' and are the
most powerful ministering spirits sent forth to minister to those who
shall be heirs of salvation.

"At another time these same mediums, fifteen in number, of both sexes,
sitting on benches in the meeting-house, saw a band of Indian spirits
coming from the 'Blue City' in the spirit world to unite with them in
their worship, and said, 'They are coming;' and as soon as the spirits
entered the door they entered the mediums, which moved them from their
seats as quick as lightning. Then followed the Indian songs and dances,
and speaking in the Indian tongue, which was wholly unintelligible to us
except by spiritual interpreters."

Some of the most curious literature of the Shakers dates from this
period; and it is freely admitted by their leading men that they were in
some cases misled into acts and publications which they have since seen
reason to regret. Their belief is that they were deceived by false
spirits, and were unable, in many cases, to distinguish the true from
the false. That is to say, they hold to their faith in "spiritual
communications," so called; but repudiate much in which they formerly
had faith, believing this which they now reject to have come from the
Evil One.

Little has ever become authentically known of the so-called

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "spiritual"
phenomena, which so profoundly excited the Shaker societies during seven
years that, as Elder Frederick relates, they closed their doors against
the world. Hervey Elkins, a person brought up in the society at Enfield,
New Hampshire, in his pamphlet entitled "Fifteen Years in the Senior
Order of Shakers," from which I have already quoted, gives some curious
details of this period. It will be seen, from the passages I extract
from Elkins, that he came under what he supposed to be "spiritual"
influences himself:

"In the spring succeeding the winter of which I have treated, a
remarkable religious revival began among all the Shakers of the land,
east and west. It was announced several months prior to its commencement
that the holy prophet Elisha was deputized to visit the Zion of God on
earth, and to bestow upon each individual those graces which each
needed, and to baptize with the Holy Ghost all the young who would
prepare their souls for such a baptism.

"The time at length arrived. No one knew the manner in which the prophet
would make himself known. The people were grave and concerned about
their spiritual standing. Two female instruments from Canterbury, N. H.,
were at length ushered into the sanctuary. Their eyes were closed, and
their faces moved in semigyrations. Their countenances were pallid, as
though worn by unceasing vigils. They looked as though laden with a
momentous and impending revelation. Throughout the assembly, pallid
faces, tears, and trembling limbs were visible. Anxiety and excitement
were felt in every mind, as all believed the instruments sacredly and
superhumanly inspired. The alternate redness and pallor of every
countenance revealed this anxiety. For the space of five minutes the
spacious hall was as silent as the tomb. One of the mediums then
advanced in the space between the ranks of brethren and sisters, and
announced with a clear, deep, and sonorous voice, and in sublime and
authoritative language, the mission of the holy prophet. The ministry
then bade the instruments to be free and proceed as they could answer to
God; and conferred on them plenary power to conduct the meetings as the
prophet should direct.

"After marching a few songs, the prophet requested the formation of two
circles, one containing all the brethren, the other the sisters. The two
mediums were first enclosed by the circle of brethren. They both

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

were young women between twenty and twenty-five years of age, and had
never before been at Enfield. They had probably never heard the names of
two thirds of the younger members. They moved around in these circles,
stopping before each one as though reading the condition of every heart.
As they passed some, they evinced pleasure; as they passed others, they
bespoke grief; others, yet, an obvious contempt; by which it seemed they
looked within, and saw with delight or horror the state of all. From our
knowledge of the members, we knew they passed and noticed them as their
works merited. Little was said to separate individuals in the first
meeting. In the second, we were requested to form six circles, three of
each sex, and those of a circle to be connected together by the taking
hold of hands; and in this manner to bow, bend, and dance. In this
condition an influence was felt, upon which psychologists and biologists
would differ. It would be needless to enumerate the many gifts, the
prophecies, the extempore songs, the revelations, the sins exposed, and
the hypocrites ejected from the society during this period of two
months. But, as near as we could estimate, four hundred new songs were
sung in that time, either by improvisation or inspiration, of which I
have my opinion. I doubt not but that many were inspired by spirits
congenial with themselves, and consequently some of the songs evinced a
fatuity and simplicity peculiar to the instrument. On the other hand,
many songs were given from spheres above, higher in melody, sentiment,
and pathos than any originating with earth's inhabitants.

"I recollect that the first spiritual gift presented to me was a 'Cup of
Solemnity.' I drank the contents, and felt for a season the salutary
effects. During the revival I became sincerely converted. I for a time,
by reason of prejudice and distrust, resisted the effect of the
impressions, which at length overwhelmed me in a flood of tears, shed
for joy and gladness, as I more and more turned my thoughts to the
Infinite. At last a halo of heavenly glory seemed to surround me. I
drank deep of the cup of the waters of life, and was lifted in mind and
purpose from this world of sorrow and sin. I soared in thought to God,
and enjoyed him in his attributes of purity and love. I was wafted by
angels safely above the ocean of sensual enjoyment which buries so many
millions, but into which I had never fallen. I explored the beauties of
ineffable bliss, and caught a glimpse of that divinity which is the
culmination of science and the end of the world. The adoration and
solemnity of the sanctuary enveloped me as with a mantle, even when
employed in manual labor and in the company of my companions. The
frivolity of some of my companions

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

disgusted me. The extreme and favorable change wrought within me in so
short a time was often remarked by the elders and members of the
society; but the praise or the censure of mortals were to me like
alternate winds, and of little avail.

"Two years thus passed, in which my highest enjoyments and pleasures
were an inward contemplation of the beauty, love, and holiness of God,
and in the ecstatic impressions that I was in the hollow of his hand,
and owned and blessed of him. Still later in life I retained and could
evoke at times the same profoundly religious impressions, contaminated,
however, by other favorite objects of study and attachment. Even the
expression of my countenance wore an aspect of deep, tender, and
benignant gravity, which the reflection of less holy subjects could not
produce. It was my delight to pray fervently and *tacitly*, and this I
often did besides the usual time allotted for such devotion. (Vocal
prayer is not admissible among the Shakers.) I loved to unite in the
dance, and give myself up to the operations of spirits even, if it would
not thwart my meditative communion with God and with God alone. Though
instruments or mediums were multiplied around me, dancing in imitation
of the spirits of all nations, singing and conversing in unknown
tongues, some evincing a truly barbarian attitude and manners, I stood
in mute thanksgiving and prayer. At times I was asked by the elders if I
could not unite and take upon me an Indian, a Norwegian, or an Arabian
spirit? I would then strive to be impressed with their feelings, and act
in conformity thereto. But such inspiration, I found, was not the
revelation of the Holy Ghost. It was not that which elevated and kept me
from all trials and temptations. But my inward spontaneous devotion was
the kind I needed. I informed the elders of my opinion, and they
concurred in it, only they regarded the inspiration of simple and
unsophisticated spirits as a stepping-stone to a higher revelation, by
virtue of removing pride, vanity, and self-will, those great barriers
against the accession of holy infusions."

\*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*

"In the fall of that season this revival redoubled its energy. The gifts
were similar to those of the spring previous, but less charity was shown
to the hypocrite and vile pretender. It was announced that Jehovah-Power
and Wisdom—the dual God, would visit the inhabitants of Zion, and bestow
a blessing upon each individual as their works should merit. A time was
given for us to prepare for his coming. Every building, every apartment,
every lane, field, orchard, and pasture, must be cleansed of

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

all rubbish and needless encumbrance; so that even a Shaker village, so
notorious for neatness, wore an aspect fifty per cent more tidy than
usual. To sweep our buildings, regulate our stores, pick up and draw to
a circular wood-saw old bits of boards, stakes, and poles that were fit
for naught but fuel, and collect into piles to be burned upon the spot
all such as were unfit for that, was the order of the day. Even the
sisters debouched by scores to help improve the appearance of the farm
and lake shores, on which were quantities of drift-wood. Thus was passed
a fortnight of pleasant autumnal weather. As the evenings approached, we
set fire to the piles of old wood, which burned, the flames shooting
upward, in a serene evening, like the innumerable bonfires which
announce the ingress of a regal visitant to monarchical countries.
Viewed from the plain below, in the gray, dim twilight of a soft and
serene atmosphere, when all nature was wrapped in the unique and
beautiful solemnity of an unusually prorogued autumn, these fires,
emerging in the blue distance from the vast amphitheatre of hills, were
picturesque in the highest degree. How neat! How fascinating! And how
much like our conceptions of heaven the whole vale appeared! And then to
regard this work of cleansing and beautifying the domains of Mount Zion
as that preparatory to the visitation of the Most High, is something
which speaks to the heart and says: 'Dost thou appear as beautiful, as
clean, and as comely in the sight of God as do these elements of an
unthinking world? Is thine heart also prepared to be searched with the
candles of him from whom no unclean thing is hidden?'

"The following words were said to have been brought by an angel from
Jehovah, and accompanied by a most beautiful tune of two airs:

  'I shall march through Mount Zion,  
  With my angelic band;  
  I shall pass through the city  
  With my fan in my hand;  
  And around thee, O Jerusalem,  
  My armies will encamp,  
  While I search my Holy Temple  
  With my bright burning lamp.'

"It was during this revival that Henry, of whom I have spoken, was
ejected from the society. During this, as also during the previous
excitement, he had exhibited an aversion which often found vent in
bitter taunts and jeers. Sometimes, however, a simulated unity of
feeling had prevented his publicly incurring the imputation of open
rebellion. He

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

had learned some scraps of the Latin language, and on the occasion of
the evening worship in which he was expelled, he afterward informed us
that, at the time he was arraigned for expulsion, he was pretendedly
uniting with those who were speaking in unknown languages by employing
awful oaths and profanity in the Latin tongue. A female instrument, said
to be employed by the spirit of Ann Lee, approached him while thus
engaged, and uttered in a low, distinct, and funereal accent a
denunciation which severed him as a withered branch from the tree of
life. He suddenly bowed as if beneath the weight of a terrible destiny,
smiting his breast and ejaculating, 'Pardon! Pardon! Oh, forgive—forgive
me my transgressions'. The elders strove to hush his cries, and replied
that 'all forbearance is at an end.' His ardent vociferations now
degenerated into inarticulate yells of horror and demoniacal despair. He
rushed from the group which surrounded him, he glided like one
unconscious of the presence of others from one extremity of the hall to
another, he smote with clenched fists the walls of the apartment, and
reeled at last in convulsive agony, uttering the deep, hollow groan of
inexorable expiation. In this situation he was hurried for the last time
from the sanctuary which he had so often profaned, and from the presence
of those moistened eyes and commiserative looks which he never would
again behold. The confession of his blasphemous profanity he made at the
trustees' office prior to his leaving the society, which occurred the
subsequent morning."

At another time such scenes as the following are described:

"Shrieks of some one, apparently in great distress, first announced a
phenomenon, which caused the excitement. The screeching proceeded from a
girl of but thirteen years of age, who had previously among the Shakers
been a clairvoyant, and who has since been a powerful medium for
spiritual manifestation elsewhere. She soon fell upon the floor,
uttering awful cries, similar to those we had often heard emanating from
instruments groaning under the pressure of some hidden abomination in
the assembly. She plucked out entire handfuls of her hair, and wailed
and shrieked like one subjected to all the conceived agonies of hell.
The ministry and elders remarked that they believed that something was
wrong; something extremely heinous was covered from God's witnesses
somewhere in the assembly. All were exhorted to search themselves, and
see if they had nothing about them that God disowns. The meeting was
soon dismissed, but the medium continued in her abnormal and deplorable
condition. Near the middle of the succeeding night we were all

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

awakened by the ringing of the alarm, and summoned quickly to repair to
the girls' apartments. We obeyed. The same medium lay upon a bed,
uttering in the name of an apostate from the Shaker faith, and who was
still living in New England, tremendous imprecations against himself,
warning all to beware of what use they make of their privilege in Zion,
telling us of his awful torments in hell, how his flesh (or the
substance of his spiritual body) was all to strings and ringlets torn,
how he was roasted in flames of brimstone and tar, and, finally, that
all these calamities were caused by his doleful corruptions and
pollutions while a member, and professedly a brother to us. This, it was
supposed by many, was by true revelation the anticipation of the future
state of this victim of apostasy and sin. Two or three more girls were
soon taken in the same manner, and became uncontrollable. They were all
instruments for reprobated spirits, and breathed nothing but hatred and
blasphemy to God. They railed, they cursed, they swore, they heaped the
vilest epithets upon the heads of the leaders and most faithful of the
members, they pulled each other's and their own hair, threw knives,
forks, and the most dangerous of missiles. When the instruments were
rational, the elders entreated them to keep off such vile spirits. They
would weep in anguish, and reply that, unless they spoke and acted for
the spirits, they would choke them to death. They would then suddenly
swoon away, and in struggling to resist them would choke and gasp, until
they had the appearance of a victim strangled by a rope tightly drawn
around her neck. If they would then speak, the strangulation would
cease. In the mean time two females of adult age, and two male youths,
were seized in the same manner. Unless confined, they would elope, and
appear to all intents the victims of insanity. One of the young women
eloped, fled to a lake which was covered with ice, was pursued by some
of the ox teamsters, and carried back to the infirmary. Two men could
with difficulty hold a woman or a child when thus influenced. To prevent
mischief and elopement, we were obliged to envelop their bodies and
their arms tightly in sheets, and thus sew them up and confine them
until the spell was over. Such delirium generally lasted but a few
hours. It would seize them at any time and at any place.

"The phenomena to which we allude was the source of much facetious
pleasantry with the young brethren. One of the infernal spirits had one
evening declared that 'before morning they would have the deacon and
Lupier.' 'Deacon' was an epithet applied to myself, as a token of
familiarity. The tidings of the declaration of this infernal agent were
soon

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

conveyed to me. It happened that my companion of the dormitory, a
middle-aged man, had that evening gone to watch with the mediums, and I
was left alone. I replied to my companions, who interrogated and
sarcastically congratulated me on my prospects for the night, that 'if
the corporeal influence of incarnate devils could be kept from the room,
I would combat without aid all other influences and answer for my own
safety.' I accordingly locked myself into my room, and enjoyed,
unmolested for the night, except by occasional raps upon the door by my
passing comrades, some of whom were up all night by reason of the
excitement, a sound and pleasant sleep. One or two instances occurred in
which a superhuman agency was indubitably obvious. One of the abnormal
males lay in a building at some distance from the infirmary where the
female instruments were confined. Suddenly one of the last, who had been
for some time in a quiescent state and rational, was seized by one of
these paroxysms, which were always accompanied by dreadful contortions
and sudden twitchings of the body, and, speaking for the spirit, said
that 'Old S—— had bound him with a surcingle, and he had left E——,' one
of the male instruments. The physician instantly repaired to the
building where E—— lay, and he was perfectly rational. S——, the watch,
informed the physician that E—— raved so violently a moment before that
he bound his arms to his body by passing a surcingle around both, and he
quickly became himself. At another time one of the females took a
handful of living coals in her bare hands, and thus carried them about
the room without even injuring the cuticle of the skin.

"The phenomena and excitement soon dwindled away by the tremendous
opposition directed against them; and when afterward spoken about, were
designated by the sinister phrase—'The Devil's Visitation.'

"Other ministrations and gifts, original and perfectly illustrative of
the inspirations of crude and uncivilized spirits, continued as usual to
exist. They were truly ludicrous. I have seen female instruments in
uncouth habits, and in imitation of squaws, and a few males acting as
suneps, glide in groups on a stiffly frozen snow, shouting, dancing,
yelling, and whooping, and others acting precisely the peculiar traits
of a Negro, an Arab, a Chinese, an Italian, or even the polite gayety of
a Frenchman. And, what is still more astounding, speaking the vernacular
dialects of each race. Their confabulation, aided by inspired
interpreters, was truly amusing and interesting. On one occasion I saw a
sister, inspired by a squaw, her head mounted with an old hat of felt,
cocked, jammed, and

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

indented in no geometrical form, rush to a pan containing a collection
of the amputated legs of hens, seize a handful of the raw delicacy, and
devour them with as much alacrity as a Yankee woman would an omelet or a
doughnut."

In general, Elkins relates:

"I have myself seen males, but more frequently females, in a
superinduced condition, apparently unconscious of earthly things, and
declaring in the name of departed spirits important and convincing
revelations. Speaking in foreign tongues and prophesying were the most
common gifts. In February, 1848, a medium became abstracted from earthly
scenes, and announced the presence of an angel of God. The angel
declared, through her, that he was sent on a mission to France, and that
before many days we should hear of his doings in that nation. This
announcement was in presence of the whole family, and it was then and
there noted down. France at that time was, for aught we knew, resting
upon a permanent political basis; or as nearly in that condition as she
ever was. In a few days the revolution of the 24th of February
precipitated the monarchy into an interregnum, which philanthropists
hoped was bottomless.

"Turning rapidly upon the toes, bowing, bending, twisting, and reeling
like one a victim to the fumes of intoxication; swooning and lying
prostrate with limbs stiff and unyielding, like a corpse, and to all
outward appearance the vital spark extinct; then suddenly
resuscitating—the mind still abstracted from scenes below—and rising to
join in the jubilancy of the dance, in company with and in imitation of
the angels around the throne of God, singing extemporaneous anthems and
songs, or those learned direct of seraphs in the regions of bliss—such
are the many exercises, effusions of devotion, and supernatural elapses
of which I was for fifteen years at intervals an eye and ear witness.
Also the exposure of sin, designating in some cases the transgressor,
the act, and the place of perpetration, of which the accused was most
generally found culpable.

"More than a score of new dances were performed, with an attitude of
grace and with the precision of a machine, by about twenty female
clairvoyants. They *said* they learned them of seraphs before the throne
of God.

"I was doubtful of their assertions, for such things were to me novel. I
however determined not to overstep the bounds of prudence, and declare
the work an illusion, for fear that I might blaspheme a higher power.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I communicated my
doubts to a few of my companions, and one, less cautious than myself,
immediately broke forth in imprecations against it. I never was secretly
opposed, but a turbulent disposition or a love for dramatic scenes,
prompted by the hope of detecting either the validity or deception of
such phenomena, impelled me to wink opposition to my reckless companion.
In the devotional exercises, which served as a preliminary to the
entrance of the mind into a superior condition, such as whirling,
twisting, and reeling, we all took a part. Henry, for that was the name
of the youth who was so zealous in his aspersions, united awkwardly and
derisively in these exercises. Amid so many arms, legs, and bodies,
revolving, oscillating, staggering, and tripping, it is not remarkable
that a few should be thrown prostrate (not violently, however) upon the
floor. One evening, in a boy's meeting at a time of great excitement,
when the spirits of some of our companions were reported to be in
spiritual spheres, and other departed spirits were careering their
mortal ladies in the graceful undulations of a celestial dance, Henry
and many others, among whom I was seen, were whirling, staggering, and
rolling, striving in vain, by all the humility we could assume, to be
also admitted into the regions of spiritual recognition, Henry suddenly
tripped and fell. One of his visionary companions instantly sprang,
passed his hands with great rapidity over him, as though binding him
with invisible cords, and then returned to his graceful employment. The
clairvoyant's eyes were closed, as indeed were the eyes of all while in
that condition. In vain Henry struggled to rise, to turn, or hardly to
move. He was fettered, bound fast by invisible manacles. The brethren
were summoned to witness the sight. In the space of perhaps half an hour
the clairvoyant returned, loosened his fetters, and he arose mortified
and confounded. Singularly disposed, he ever after treated these gifts
with virulent ridicule, and never was heard to utter any serious remarks
concerning this transaction. The clairvoyant after this event was the
butt of his satire and jests, and received them without revenge so long
as Henry remained, which was about five years—a reckless, abandoned,
evil-minded person, eventually severed by that same power which he
strove incessantly to ridicule. All these strange operations and gifts
are attributed by the Shakers to the influence of superhuman power like
that manifested in the Primitive Church."

Some of the hymns which date from this period have fragments of the
"strange tongues" in which the "mediums"

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

spoke. Here is one, dated at New Lebanon, and printed in the collection
called "Millennial Hymns:"

"HEAVENLY GUIDE.

  "Lo all ye, hark ye, dear children, and listen to me,  
  For I am that holy Se lone´ se ka´ ra an ve´;  
  My work upon earth is holy, holy and pure,  
  That work which will ever, forever endure.

  "Yea, my heavenly Father hath se-ve´-ned to you  
  That power which is holy and that faith which is true;  
  O then, my beloved, why will ye delay?  
  O la ho´ le en se´ ren, now while it is day.

  "The holy angels in heaven their trumpets do raise,  
  And with saints upon earth sound endless praise.  
  Blessed, most blessed, your day, and holy your call,  
  O ven se´ ne ven se´ ne, yea every soul.

  "All holy se ka´ ren are the free blessings given  
  And bestowed on you from the fountain of heaven;  
  Yea, guardian spirits from the holy Selan´,  
  Bring you heavenly love, vi´ ne see´, Lin´ se van´.

  "Press ye on, my dear children, the holy Van´ la hoo´  
  Is your heavenly guide, and will safely bear you through  
  All vo´len tribulation you meet here below;  
  Then be humble, dear children, be faithful and true.

  "For God, your holy, holy HEAVENLY FATHER, will never,  
  Never forsake his holy house of Israel on e.a.r.t.h.,  
  But the blessings of heaven will continue to flow  
  On you, my beloved Ar´ se le be low. (*n-o-t-e-s*.)"

The most curious relics of those days are two considerable volumes,
which have since fallen into discredit among the Shakers themselves, but
were at the time of their issue regarded as highly important. One of
these is entitled "*A Holy, Sacred, and Divine Soil and Book, from the
Lord God of Heaven to the Inhabitants of Earth:* Revealed in the United
Society at New Lebanon, County of Columbia, State of

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> New York, United
States of America. Received by the Church of this Communion, and
published in union with the same." It is dated Canterbury, N. H., 1843;
contains 405 pages; and is in two parts. The first part contains the
revelation proper; the second, various "testimonies" to its accuracy and
divine origin. Of these evidences, some purport to be by the prophets
Elisha, Ezekiel, Malachi, Isaiah, and others; from Noah, St. Peter, St.
John; by "Holy and Eternal Mother Wisdom," and a "holy and mighty angel
of God," whose name was *Ma´ne Me´rah Vak´na Si´na Jah*; but the greater
number are by living Shakers. As a part of the revelation, the Shakers
were commanded to print, "in their own society, five hundred copies" of
this book, to be "given to the children of men," and "it is my
requirement that they be printed before the 22d of next September. To be
bound in yellow paper, with red backs; edges yellow also." Moreover,
missionary societies were commanded to translate the book into foreign
tongues, and I have heard that a copy was sent to every ruler or
government which could be reached by mail.

The body of the book is a mixture of Scripture texts and "revelations of
spirits;" and the absurdity of it appears to have struck even the
so-called "holy angel" who was supposed to have superintended the
writing, as appears from the following passage:

"We are four of the holy and mighty angels of God, sent from before his
throne, to pass and repass through the four quarters of the earth; and
many are the holy angels that bear us company. And thus we shall visit
the earth in partial silence, as this Roll goes forth, until we have
marked the door-posts of all, as our God hath commanded, who shall
humble themselves and repent at his word, by proclaiming a solemn fast,
and cease from their awful crimes of wickedness, and turn to him in
righteousness.

"My name, says the angel whose quarter is eastward, and stands as first,
is HOLY ASSAN´ DE LA JAH´. The second, whose part is second, and quarter
westward, is MI´CHAEL VAN´ CE VA´ NE. The

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

third, whose part is third, and quarter northward, is GA´ BRY VEN´ DO
VAS´ TER REEN´. The fourth, whose part is fourth, and quarter southward,
is VEN DEN´ DE PA´ ROL JEW´ LE JAH´.

"These are our names in our own tongues, and we are sent on earth to
prepare the way for the Most High; and the whole human family will be
convinced of this before the final event of our mission shall arrive.

"And although we know that the words of this book will be considered by
many as being produced in the wildest of enthusiasm, madness, blasphemy,
and fanaticism, and by others as solemn, sacred, and awful truths; yet
do we declare unto all flesh that this Roll and Book contains the word
of the God of heaven, your Almighty Creator, sent forth direct from his
eternal throne now in this your day.

"And by this word shall every soul on earth be judged, in mercy or in
judgment, whether they believe or disbelieve. We are not sent forth by
our God to argue with mortals, but to declare his word and his work. And
we furthermore declare unto all the inhabitants of earth that they have
no time to lose in preparing for their God.

"If there be any who cannot understand to their souls' satisfaction
(though the requirements are plain), yet they may apply wheresoever they
believe they can be correctly informed."

As a sample of the book, here is an account by one of the mediums of her
"interview with a holy angel:"

"It was in the evening of the twenty-second of January, eighteen hundred
and forty-two, while I was busily employed putting all things in
readiness for the close of the week, that I distinctly heard my name
called very loudly, and with much earnestness. I could not go so well at
that moment, and I answered, 'I will come soon,' for I supposed it to be
some one in the adjoining room that wished to see me; but the word was
repeated three times, and I hastened to the place from whence the sound
seemed to come, but there was no one present.

"I soon saw in the middle of the room four very large and bright lights,
or balls of fire, as they appeared to be; they moved slowly each way,
and after a little time joined together in one exceedingly large light,
or pillar of fire. At this moment I heard a loud voice, which uttered
many words with such mighty force that I feared to stay in the room, and
attempted to go out; but found that I had not power to move my feet.

"For some time I could not understand one word that was sounded

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

forth; but the first that I did understand were as follows: 'Hark! Hark!
hearken, oh thou child of mortality, unto the word that is and shall be
sounded aloud in thine ears, again and again, even until it is obeyed.

"'And lo, I say a time, and a time, and a half-time shall not pass by
before my voice shall be heard, and my word sounded forth to the nations
abroad. But in the Zion of my likeness and true righteousness shall it
be received first, and from thence shall it go forth; for thus and thus
hath the God of heaven and earth declared and purposed that it should
be.

"'Then why will you, O why will you, yet fear to obey? What would you
that your God would do in your presence, that you might fear his power
rather than that of mortal man?'

"From this moment I was not sensible where I was; and after a little
time of silence the body of light, or pillar of fire, dispersed, and I
saw a mighty angel coming from the east, and I heard these words:

"'Woe, woe, and many woes shall be upon the mortal that shall see and
will not stop to behold.'"

And so on, for a good many pages.

The second work is called *"The Divine Book of Holy and Eternal Wisdom,
revealing the Word of God, out of whose mouth goeth a sharp Sword.*
Written by Paulina Bates, at Watervliet, N. Y., United States of
America; arranged and prepared for the Press at New Lebanon, N. Y.
Published by the United Society called Shakers. Printed at Canterbury,
N.H., 1849." This book contains 718 pages; and pretends also to be a
series of revelations by angels and deceased persons of note. In the
Preface by the editors its origin is thus described:

"During a number of years past many remarkable displays of divine power
and heavenly gifts have been manifested among the children of Zion in
all the branches of the United Society of Believers in the second
appearing of Christ. Much increasing light has been revealed on many
subjects which have heretofore remained as mysteries; and many prophetic
revelations have been brought forth, from time to time, through
messengers chosen and inspired by heavenly power and wisdom.

"Among these it has pleased God to select a female of the United Society
at Wisdom's Valley (Watervliet), and indue her with the heavenly light
of revelation as an instrument of divine Wisdom, to write by divine

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

inspiration those solemn warnings, prophetic revelations, and heavenly
instructions which will be found extensively diffused through the sacred
pages of this book.

"These were written in a series of communications at various times
during the year 1841, '42, '43, and '44, with few exceptions, which will
be seen by their several dates. But the inspired writer had no knowledge
that they were designed by the Divine Spirit to be published to the
world until a large portion of the work was written; therefore, whenever
she was called upon by the angel of God, she wrote whatever the angel
dictated at the time, without any reference to the connective order and
regular arrangement of a book; for she was not directed so to do, for
reasons which were afterwards revealed to her and other witnesses then
unknown to her.

"Hence it was made known to be the design of the Divine Spirit that
these communications should be transmitted to the Holy Mount (New
Lebanon), there to be prepared for publication by agents appointed for
that purpose, in union with the leading authority of the Church.
Accordingly they were conveyed to New Lebanon, and the subscribers were
appointed as editors, to examine and arrange them in regular and
convenient order for the press, and divine instructions were given for
that purpose.

"Having therefore faithfully examined the manuscripts containing these
communications, we have compiled them into one book, in two general
divisions or volumes, agreeably to the instructions given. We have also,
for convenient arrangement, divided the whole into seven parts,
according to the relative connection which appeared in the different
subjects. And for the convenience of the reader we have divided each
part into chapters, prefixing an appropriate title to each.

"Some passages and annotations have been added by *The Angel of
Prophetic Light,* who by inspiration has frequently assisted in the
preparation and arrangement of the work, for the purpose of illustrating
and confirming some of the original subjects by further explanations. A
few notes have also been added by the editors for the information of the
reader. These are all distinguished in their proper places from the
original matter.

"But although it was found necessary to transcribe the whole, in order
to prepare it properly and intelligibly for the press, yet we have used
great care to preserve the sense of the original in its purity; and we
can testify that the substance and spirit of the work have been
conscientiously preserved in full throughout the whole.

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

"This work is called 'Holy Wisdom's Book,' because Holy and Eternal
Wisdom is the Mother, or Bearing Spirit, of all the works of God; and
because it was especially revealed through the line of the female, being
WISDOM'S *Likeness; and she lays special claim to this work*, and places
her seal upon it.

"An *Appendix* is added, containing the testimonies of various divine
and heavenly witnesses to the sacred truth and reality of the
declarations and revelations contained in the work. The most of these
were given before the inspired writers who received them had any earthly
knowledge concerning the book or its contents. A *testimony* is also
affixed to the work by the elders of the family in which the inspired
writer resides, bearing witness to the honesty and uprightness of her
character, and her faithfulness in the work of God."

The main object of the book is to warn sinners of all kinds from the
"wrath to come." Especial woes, by the way, are denounced against
slaveholders and slave traders: "Whether they be clothed in tenements of
clay, or whether they be stripped of their earthly tabernacles, the same
hand of Justice shall meet them whithersoever they flee." It must be
remembered to the honor of the Shakers that they have always and every
where consistently opposed human slavery.

The "Divine Book of Holy Wisdom" contains the "testimonies" of the
"first man, Adam," of the "first woman, Eve," of Noah and all the
patriarchs, and of a great many other ancient worthies; but, alas! what
they have to say is not new, and of no interest to the unregenerate
reader.

These two volumes are not now, as formerly, held in honor by the
Shakers. One of their elders declared to me that I ought never to have
seen them, and that their best use was to burn them. But I found them on
the table of the visitors' room in one or two of the Western societies,
and I suppose they are still believed in by some of the people.

At this day most (but not all) of the Shaker people are sincere
believers in what is commonly called Spiritualism. At a Shaker funeral I
have heard what purported to be a message

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

from the spirit whose body was lying in the coffin in the adjoining
hall. In one of the societies it is believed that a magnificent
spiritual city, densely inhabited, and filled with palaces and fine
residences, lies upon their domain, and at but a little distance from
the terrestrial buildings of the Church family; and frequent
communications come from this spirit city to their neighbors. "When I
was a little girl, I desired very much to have a hymn sent through me to
the family from the spirit-land; and after waiting and wishing for a
long time, one day when I was little expecting it, as I was walking
about, a hymn came to me thus, to my inexpressible delight"—so said a
Shaker eldress to me in all seriousness. "We have frequently been
visited by a tribe of Indians (spirits of Indians), who used to live in
this country, and whose spirits still come back here occasionally," said
another Shaker sister to me.

On the other hand, when I asked one of the elders how far he believed
that their hymns are inspired, he asked me whether it did not happen
that I wrote with greater facility at one time than at another; and when
I replied in the affirmative, he said, "In that case I should say you
were inspired when your words come readily, and to that degree I suppose
our hymn-writers are inspired. They have thought about the subject, and
the words at last come to them."

I think I have before said that the Shakers do not attempt to suppress
discussion of the relations of the sexes; they do not pretend that their
celibate life is without hardships or difficulties; but they boldly
assert that they have chosen the better life, and defend their position
with not a little skill against all attacks. A good many years ago Miss
Charlotte Cushman, after a visit to Watervliet, wrote the following
lines, which were published in the *Knickerbocker Magazine*:

  "Mysterious worshipers!  
  Are you indeed the things you seem to be,  
  Of earth—yet of its iron influence free— <span id="page_252">p.
252</span>  
  From all that stirs  
  Our being's pulse, and gives to fleeting life  
  What well the Hun has termed 'the rapture of the strife.'

  "Are the gay visions gone,  
  Those day-dreams of the mind, by fate there flung,  
  And the fair hopes to which the soul once clung, And battled on;  
  Have ye outlived them? All that must have sprung,  
  And quicken'd into life, when ye were young?

  "Does memory never roam  
  To ties that, grown with years, ye idly sever,  
  To the old haunts that ye have left forever—Your early homes?  
  Your ancient creed, once faith's sustaining lever,  
  The loved who erst prayed with you—now may never?

  "Has not ambition's paean  
  Some power within your hearts to wake anew  
  To deeds of higher emprise—worthier you, Ye monkish men,  
  Than may be reaped from fields? Do ye not rue  
  The drone-like course of life ye now pursue?

  "The camp—the council—all  
  That woos the soldier to the field of fame—  
  That gives the sage his meed—the bard his name And coronal—  
  Bidding a people's voice their praise proclaim;  
  Can ye forego the strife, nor own your shame?

  "Have ye forgot your youth,  
  When expectation soared on pinions high,  
  And hope shone out on boyhood's cloudless sky, Seeming all truth—  
  When all looked fair to fancy's ardent eye,  
  And pleasure wore an air of sorcery?

  "You, too! What early blight  
  Has withered your fond hopes, that ye thus stand,  
  A group of sisters, 'mong this monkish band? <span id="page_253">p.
253</span>  
  Ye creatures bright!  
  Has sorrow scored your brows with demon hand,  
  Or o'er your hopes passed treachery's burning brand?

  "Ye would have graced right well  
  The bridal scene, the banquet, or the bowers  
  Where mirth and revelry usurp the hours—Where, like a spell,  
  Beauty is sovereign—where man owns its powers,  
  And woman's tread is o'er a path of flowers.

  "Yet seem ye not as those  
  Within whose bosoms memories vigils keep:  
  Beneath your drooping lids no passions sleep; And your pale brows  
  Bear not the tracery of emotion deep—  
  Ye seem too cold and passionless to weep!"

A "Shaker Girl," in one of the Kentucky societies, published soon
afterward the following "Answer to Charlotte Cushman," which is
certainly not without spirit:

  "We are, indeed, the things we seem to be,  
  Of earth, and from its iron influence free:  
  For we are they, or halt, or lame, or dumb,  
  'On whom the ends of this vain world are come.'  
  "We have outlived those day-dreams of the mind—  
  Those flattering phantoms which so many bind;  
  All man-made creeds (your 'faith's sustaining lever')  
  We have forsaken, and have left forever!  
  "To plainly tell the truth, we do not rue  
  The sober, godly course that we pursue;  
  But 'tis not we who live the dronish lives,  
  But those who have their husbands or their wives!  
  But if by drones you mean they're lazy men,  
  Then, Charlotte Cushman, take it back again;  
  For one, with half an eye, or half a mind,  
  Can there see industry and wealth combined.  
  "If camps and councils—soldiers' 'fields of fame'—  
  Or yet a people's praise or people's blame, <span id="page_254">p.
254</span>  
  Is all that gives the sage or bard his name,  
  We can 'forego the strife, nor own our shame'  
  What great temptations you hold up to view  
  For men of sense or reason to pursue!  
  The praise of mortals!—what can it avail,  
  When all their boasted language has to fail?  
  And 'sorrow hath not scored with demon hand,'  
  Nor 'o'er our hopes pass'd treachery's burning brand;'  
  But where the sorrows and the treachery are,  
  I think may easily be made appear.  
  In 'bridal scenes,' in 'banquets and in bowers!'  
  'Mid revelry and variegated flowers,  
  Is where your mother Eve first felt their powers.  
  The 'bridal scenes,' you say, 'we'd grace right well!'  
  'Lang syne' there our first parents blindly fell!—  
  The bridal scene! Is this your end and aim?  
  And can you this pursue, 'nor own your shame?'  
  If so—weak, pithy, superficial thing—  
  Drink, silent drink the sick hymeneal spring.  
  'The bridal scene! the banquet or the bowers,  
  Or woman's \[bed of thorns, or\] path of flowers,'  
  Can't all persuade our souls to turn aside  
  To live in filthy lust or cruel pride.  
  Alas! your path of flowers will disappear;  
  E'en now a thousand thorns are pointed near;  
  Ah! here you find 'base treachery's burning brand,'  
  And sorrows score the heart, nor spare the hand;  
  But here 'Beauty's sovereign'—so say you—  
  A thing that in one hour may lose its hue—  
  It lies upon the surface of the skin—  
  Aye, Beauty's self was never worth a pin;  
  But still it suits the superficial mind—  
  The slight observer of the human kind;  
  The airy, fleety, vain, and hollow thing,  
  That only feeds on wily flattering.  
  'Man owns its powers?' And what will not man own  
  To gain his end—to captivate—dethrone?  
  The truth is this, whatever he may feign,  
  You'll find your greatest loss his greatest gain; <span
id="page_255">p. 255</span>  
  For like the bee, he will improve the hour,  
  And all day long he'll hunt from flower to flower,  
  And when he sips the sweetness all away,  
  For aught he cares, the flowers may all decay.  
  But here, each other's virtues we partake,  
  Where men and women all their ills forsake:  
  True virtue spreads her bright angelic wing,  
  While saints and seraphs praise the Almighty King.  
  And when the matter's rightly understood,  
  You'll find we labor for each other's good;  
  This, Charlotte Cushman, truly is our aim—  
  Can you forego this strife, 'nor own your shame?'  
  Now if you would receive a modest hint,  
  You'd surely keep your name at least from print,  
  Nor have it hoisted, handled round and round,  
  And echoed o'er the earth from mound to mound,  
  As the great advocate of ——— (Oh, the name!).  
  Now can you think of this, 'nor own your shame?'  
  But, Charlotte, learn to take a deeper view  
  Of what your neighbors say or neighbors do;  
  And when some flattering knaves around you tread,  
  Just think of what a SHAKER GIRL has said."

The *Shaker and Shakeress*, a monthly journal, edited by Elder Frederick
Evans and Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, is the organ of the society; and
in its pages their views are set forth with much shrewdness and ability.
It is not so generally interesting a journal as the *Oneida Circular*,
the organ of the Perfectionists, because the Shakers concern themselves
almost exclusively with religious matters, and give in their paper but
few details of their daily and practical life.

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

### POPULATION RETURNS OF THE SHAKER SOCIETIES.

I give here, in a convenient tabular form, figures showing the present
and past numbers of the different Shaker Societies—males, females, and
children—the amount of land each society owns, and the number of
