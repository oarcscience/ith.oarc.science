#### II.—RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND FAITH-CURES.

They call themselves "Perfectionists."

They hold to the Bible as the "text-book of the Spirit of truth;" to
"Jesus Christ as the eternal Son of God;" to "the apostles and Primitive
Church as the exponents of the everlasting Gospel." They believe that
"the second advent of Christ took place at the period of the destruction
of Jerusalem;" that "at that time there was a primary resurrection and
judgment in the spirit world;" and "that the final kingdom of God then
began in the heavens; that the manifestation of that kingdom in the
visible world is now approaching; that its approach is ushering in the
second and final resurrection and judgment; that a Church on earth is
now rising to meet the approaching kingdom in the heavens, and to become
its duplicate and representative; that inspiration, or open
communication with God and the heavens, involving perfect holiness, is
the element of connection between the Church on earth

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

and the Church in the heavens, and the power by which the kingdom of God
is to be established and reign in the world." <span
id="fr_23"></span>[\*](#fn_23.md)

They assert, further, that "the Gospel provides for complete salvation
from sin"—hence the name they assume of "Perfectionists." "Salvation
from sin," they say, "is the foundation needed by all other reforms."

"Do you, then, claim to live sinless lives?" I asked; and received this
answer:

"We consider the community to be a Church, and our theory of a Christian
Church, as constituted in the apostolic age, is that it is a school,
consisting of many classes, from those who are in the lowest degree of
faith to those who have attained the condition of certain and eternal
salvation from sin. The only direct answer, therefore, that we can give
to your question is that some of us claim to live sinless lives, and
some do not. A sinless life is the *standard* of the community, which
all believe to be practicable, and to which all are taught to aspire.
Yet we recognize the two general classes, which were characterized by
Paul as the "nepiou" and the "teleioi." Our belief is that a Christian
Church can exist only when the "teleioi" are in the ascendant and have
control."

In compliance with my request, the following definition of
"Perfectionism" was written out for me as authoritative:

"The bare doctrine of Perfectionism might be presented in a single
sentence thus:

"As the doctrine of temperance is total abstinence from alcoholic
drinks, and the doctrine of anti-slavery is immediate abolition of human
bondage, so the doctrine of Perfectionism is immediate and total
cessation from sin.

"But the analogy thus suggested between Perfectionism and two popular
reforms is by no means to be regarded as defining the character and
methods of Perfectionism. Salvation from

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

sin, as we understand it, is not a system of duty-doing under a code of
dry laws, Scriptural or natural; but is a special phase of *religious
experience*, having for its basis spiritual intercourse with God. All
religionists of the positive sort believe in a personal God, and assume
that he is a sociable being. This faith leads them to seek intercourse
with him, to approach him by prayer, to give him their hearts, to live
in communion with him. These exercises and the various states and
changes of the *inner* life connected with them constitute the staple of
what is commonly called *religious experience*. Such experience, of
course, has more or less effect on the character and external conduct.
We cannot live in familiar intercourse with human beings without
becoming better or worse under their influence; and certainly fellowship
with God must affect still more powerfully all the springs of action.
Perfectionists hold that intercourse with God may proceed so far as to
destroy selfishness in the heart, and so make an end of sin. This is the
special phase of religious experience which we profess, and for which we
are called Perfectionists."

Among other matters, they hold that "the Jews are, by God's perpetual
covenant, the royal nation;" that the obligation to observe the Sabbath
passed away with the Jewish dispensation, and is "adverse to the advance
of man into new and true arrangements;" that "the original organization
instituted by Christ \[the Primitive Church\] is accessible to us, and
that our main business as reformers is to open communication with that
heavenly body;" and they "refer all their experience to the invisible
hosts who are contending over them."

I must add, to explain the last sentence, that they are not
Spiritualists in the sense in which that word is nowadays usually
employed, and in which the Shakers are Spiritualists; but they hold that
they are in a peculiar and direct manner under the guidance of God and
good spirits. "Saving faith, according to the Bible, places man in such
a relation to God that he

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

is authorized to ask favors of him as a child asks favors of his father.
Prayer without expectation of an answer is a performance not sanctioned
by Scripture nor by common-sense. But prayer with expectation of an
answer (that is, the prayer of faith) is impossible, on the supposition
that 'the age of miracles is past,' and that God no longer interferes
with the regular routine of nature." Hence their belief in what they
call "Faith-cures," of which I shall speak further on.

Community of goods and of persons they hold to have been taught and
commanded by Jesus: "Jesus Christ offers to save men from all evil—from
sin and death itself; but he always states it as a necessary condition
of their accepting his help that they shall forsake all other; and
particularly that they shall get rid of their private property."
Communism they hold therefore to be "the social state of the
resurrection." "The account on the sides of life and death arranges
itself thus:

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />

<p> </p></td>

The community system, which they thus hold to have been divinely
commanded, they extend beyond property—to persons; and thus they justify
their extraordinary social system, in which there is no marriage; or, as
they put it, "complex marriage takes the place of simple." They surround
this singular and, so far as I know, unprecedented combination of
polygamy and polyandry with certain religious and social restraints; but
affirm that there is "no intrinsic difference between property in
persons and property in things; and that the same spirit which abolished
exclusiveness in regard to money would

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

abolish, if circumstances allowed full scope to it, exclusiveness in
regard to women and children." <span id="fr_24"></span>[\*](#fn_24.md)

It is an extraordinary evidence of the capacity of mankind for various
and extreme religious beliefs, that many men have brought their wives
and young daughters into the Oneida Community.

They have no preaching; do not use Baptism nor the Lord's Supper; do not
observe Sunday, because they hold that with them every day is a Sabbath;
do not pray aloud; and Avoid with considerable care all set forms. They
read the Bible and quote it much.

They believe that the exercise of sufficient faith in prayer to God is
capable of restoring the sick to health; and assert that there have been
in their experience and among their membership a number of such cures.
In a "Free-Church Tract," dated "Oneida Reserve, 1850," there is an
account of such a cure of Mrs. M. A. Hall, ill of consumption, and given
up by her physicians. In this case J. H. Noyes and Mrs. Cragin were
those whose "power of faith" was supposed to have acted; and Mrs. Hall
herself wrote, two years later: "From a helpless, bed-ridden state, in
which I was unable to move, or even to be moved without excruciating
pain, I was *instantly* raised to a consciousness of perfect health. I
was constrained to declare again and again that I was perfectly well. My
eyes, which before could not bear the light, were opened to the blaze of
day and became strong. My appetite was restored, and all pain removed."
This is said to have taken place in June, 1847. The following case is
reported in the *Circular* for February 9th of the present year (1874),
and the description of the injury, which immediately follows, is given
by Dr. Cragin—a member of the Oneida Community—whom I understand to be a
regularly educated physician. The sufferer was a woman, Mrs. M.

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

"Her hand was passed between the rubber rollers of a wringing-machine.
The machine was new, and the rollers were screwed down so that it
brought a very heavy pressure on her hand, evidently crowding the bones
all out of place and stretching the ligaments, besides seriously
injuring the nerves of her hand and arm. When she came here from
Wallingford Community, several weeks after the accident, not only the
nerves of her hand were essentially paralyzed, but the trunk nerve of
her arm was paralyzed and caused her a great deal of suffering. It was
as helpless as though completely paralyzed: she had not sufficient
control over her hand to bend her fingers.

"That was her condition up to the time of the cure. I could not see from
the time she came here to the time of the cure that there was any change
for the better. I told her the first time I examined her hand that,
according to the ordinary course of such things, she must not expect to
get the use of it under twelve months, if she did then. At the same time
I told her I would not limit the power of God.

"Her general health improved, but her hand caused her the acutest
suffering. It would awaken her in the night, and oblige her to get up
and spend hours in rubbing it and trying to allay the pain. If any one
has had a jumping toothache, he can imagine something what her suffering
was, only the pain extended over the whole hand and arm, instead of
being confined to one small place like a tooth. I have known of strong
men who had the nervous system of an arm similarly affected, who begged
that their arms might be taken off, and have indeed suffered amputation
rather than endure the pain.

"For some time before her cure there had been considerable talk in the
family about faith-cures, and persons had talked with her on the
subject, and encouraged her to expect to have such a cure as Harriet
Hall did. Finally Mr. Noyes's interest was aroused, and he invoked a
committee for her—not so much to criticize as to comfort her, and bring
to bear on her the concentrated attention and faith of the family. She
was stimulated by this criticism to cheerfulness and hope, and to put
herself into the social current, keeping around as much as she could
where there was the most life and faith. A private criticism soon after
penetrated her spirit, and separated her from a brooding influence of
evil that she had come under in a heart affair.

"Still she suffered with her hand as much as ever, up to the time of her
sudden cure. A few evenings after this private criticism we had a very
interesting meeting, and she was present in the gallery. The subject

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

was the power of prayer, and there was a good deal of faith experience
related, and she appeared the next morning shaking hands with every body
she met. Now you see her washing dishes and making beds.

"*Mrs. A.*—The morning she was cured I was at work in the hall, when she
came running toward me, saying, 'I'm cured! I'm cured!' Then she shook
hands with me, using the hand that had been so bad, and giving a hearty
pressure with it.

"*Dr. C.*—To show that the case is not one of imagination, I will say
that the day before the cure she could not have it *touched* without
suffering pain. She had not been dressed for a week, but that morning
she bathed and dressed herself and made her bed, and then went to Joppa.

"*Mr. N.*—She came down to Joppa with her hands all free, and went out
on the ice; I don't know that she caught any fish, but she attended the
'tip-ups.'

"*Mrs. C.*—She said to me that she had attended to dieting and all the
prescriptions that were given her, and got no help from them; and she
had made up her mind that if there was any thing done for her, the
community must take hold and do it.

"*W. A. H.*—Let us be united about this case; and if it be imagination,
let us have more of it; and if it be the power of faith, let us have
more faith.

"*C. W. U.*—Was Mrs. M. conscious of any precise moment when the pain
left her in the night?

"*Mrs. M.* \[the person who was cured\].—After the meeting in which we
talked about faith-cures, I went to my room and prayed to God to take
the pain out of my hand, and told him if he did I would glorify him with
it. The pain left me, and I could stretch out my arm farther than I had
been able to since it was hurt. I went to bed, and slept until four
o'clock without waking; then I awoke and found I was not in pain, and
that I could stretch out my arm and move my fingers. Then I thought—'I
am well.' I got up, took a bath, and dressed myself. After this my arm
ached some, but I said, 'I am well; I am made every whit whole.' I kept
saying that to myself, and the pain left me entirely. My arm has begun
to ache nearly every day since then, but I insist that I am well, and
the pain ceases. That arm is not yet as strong as the other, but is
improving daily.

"*Mrs. C.*—I have had considerable of that kind of experience during the
last few years. For two years I raised blood a good deal, and thought

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

a great many times that I was going to die—could not get that idea out
of my mind. Mrs. M. talked with me about it, and told me I must not give
up to my imaginations. I was put into business two years ago, and some
days my head swam so that I could hardly go about, but I did what was
given me to do; and finally I came to a point in my experience where I
said, 'I don't care if I do raise blood; I am not going to be frightened
by it; I had as soon raise blood as do any thing else.' When I got there
my trouble left me."

I have copied this account at some length, because it speaks in detail
of a quite recent occurrence, and shows, in a characteristic way, their
manner of dealing with disease.

They profess also to have wrought cures by what they call "Criticism,"
of which I shall speak further on.

Concerning their management of the intercourse of the sexes, so much has
been written, by themselves and by others, that I think I need here say
only that—

1st. They regard their system as part of their religion. Noyes said, in
a "Home Talk," reported in the *Circular*, February 2,1874: "Woe to him
who abolishes the law of the apostasy before he stands in the holiness
of the resurrection. The law of the apostasy is the law of marriage; and
it is true that whoever undertakes to enter into the liberty of the
resurrection without the holiness of the resurrection, will get woe and
not happiness. It is as important for the young now as it was for their
fathers then, that they should know that holiness of heart is what they
must have before they get liberty in love. They must put the first thing
first, as I did and as their parents did; they must be *Perfectionists*
before they are *Communists*." He seems to see, too, that "complex
marriage," as he calls it, is not without grave dangers to the
community, for he added, in the same "Home Talk:" "We have got into the
position of Communism, where without genuine salvation from sin our
passions will overwhelm us, and nothing but confusion and misery can be
expected. On the other hand, we have

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

got into a position where, if we do have the grace of God triumphant in
our hearts and flowing through all our nature, there is an opportunity
for harmony and happiness beyond all that imagination has conceived. So
it is hell behind us, and heaven before us, and a necessity that we
should *march!*"

2d. "Complex marriage" means, in their practice: that, within the limits
of the community membership, any man and woman may and do freely
cohabit, having first gained each other's consent, not by private
conversation or courtship, but through the intervention of some third
person or persons; that they strongly discourage, as an evidence of
sinful selfishness, what they call "exclusive and idolatrous attachment"
of two persons for each other, and aim to break up by "criticism" and
other means every thing of this kind in the community; that they teach
the advisability of pairing persons of different ages, the young of one
sex with the aged of the other, and as the matter is under the control
and management of the more aged members it is thus arranged; that
"persons are not obliged, under any circumstances, to receive the
attentions of those whom they do not like;" and that the propagation of
children is controlled by the society, which pretends to conduct this
matter on scientific principles: "Previous to about two and a half years
ago we refrained from the usual rate of childbearing, for several
reasons, financial and otherwise. Since that time we have made an
attempt to produce the usual number of offspring to which people in the
middle classes are able to afford judicious moral and spiritual care,
with the advantage of a liberal education. In this attempt twenty-four
men and twenty women have been engaged, selected from among those who
have most thoroughly practiced our social theory." <span
id="fr_25"></span>[\*](#fn_25.md)

Finally, they find in practice a strong tendency toward what they call
"selfish love"—that is to say, the attachment

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

of two persons to each other, and their desire to be true to each other;
and there are here and there in their publications signs that there has
been suffering among their young people on this account. They rebuke
this propensity, however, as selfish and sinful, and break it down
rigorously.
