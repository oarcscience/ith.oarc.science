### THE PERFECTIONISTS OF ONEIDA AND WALLINGFORD

#### I.—HISTORICAL.

THE Oneida and Wallingford Communists are of American origin, and their
membership is almost entirely American.

Their founder, who is still their head, John Humphrey Noyes, was born in
Brattleboro, Vermont, in 1811, of respectable parentage. He graduated
from Dartmouth College, began the study of the law, but turned shortly
to theology; and studied first at Andover, with the intention of fitting
himself to become a foreign missionary, and later in the Yale
theological school. At New Haven he came under the influence of a
zealous revival preacher, and during his residence there he "landed in a
new experience and new views of the way of salvation, which took the
name of Perfectionism."

This was in 1834. He soon returned to Putney, in Vermont, where his
father's family then lived, and where his father was a banker. There he
preached and printed; and in 1838 married Harriet A. Holton, the
granddaughter of a member of Congress, and a convert to his doctrines.

He slowly gathered about him a small company of believers, drawn from
different parts of the country, and with their help made known his new
faith in various publications, with such effect that though in 1847 he
had only about forty persons in his own congregation, there appear to
have been small gatherings of "Perfectionists" in other states, in
correspondence with Noyes, and inclined to take him as their leader.

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

Originally Noyes was not a Communist, but when his thoughts turned in
that direction he began to prepare his followers for communal life; in
1845 he made known to them his peculiar views of the relations of the
sexes, and in 1846 the society at Putney began cautiously an experiment
in communal living.

Their views, which they never concealed, excited the hostility of the
people to such a degree that they were mobbed and driven out of the
place; and in the spring of 1848 they joined some persons of like faith
and practice at Oneida, in Madison County, New York. Here they began
community life anew, on forty acres of land, on which stood an unpainted
frame dwelling-house, an abandoned Indian hut, and an old Indian
saw-mill. They owed for this property two thousand dollars. The place
was neglected, without cultivation, and the people were so poor that for
some time they had to sleep on the floor in the garret which was their
principal sleeping-chamber.

The gathering at Oneida appears to have been the signal for several
attempts by followers of Noyes to establish themselves in communes. In
1849 a small society was formed in Brooklyn, N.Y., to which later the
printing for all the societies was entrusted. In 1850 another community
was begun at Wallingford, in Connecticut. There were others, of which I
find no account; but all regarded Oneida as their centre and leader; and
in the course of time, and after various struggles, all were drawn into
the common centre, except that at Wallingford, which still exists in a
flourishing condition, having its property and other interests in common
with Oneida.

The early followers of Noyes were chiefly New England farmers, the
greater part of whom brought with them some means, though not in any
single case a large amount. Noyes himself and several other members
contributed several thousand dollars each, and a "Property Register"
kept from the beginning of the community experiment showed that up to
the first of January, 1857, the members of all the associated

communes had brought in the considerable amount of one hundred and seven
thousand seven hundred and six dollars. I understand, however, that this
sum was not at any one time in hand, and that much of it came in several
years after the settlement at Oneida in 1848; and it is certain that in
the early days, while they were still seeking for some business which
should be at the same time agreeable to them and profitable, they had
sometimes short commons. They showed great courage and perseverance, for
through all their early difficulties they maintained a printing-office
and circulated a free paper.

At first they looked toward agriculture and horticulture as their
main-stays for income; but they began soon to unite other trades with
these. Their saw-mill sawed lumber for the neighboring farmers; they set
up a blacksmith shop, and here, besides other work, they began to make
traps by hand, having at first no means to buy machinery, and indeed
having to invent most of that which they now use in their extensive trap
shop.

Like the Shakers with their garden seeds, and all other successful
communities with their products, the Perfectionists got their start by
the excellence of their workmanship. Their traps attracted attention
because they were more uniformly well made than others; and thus they
built up a trade which has become very large. They raised small fruits,
made rustic furniture, raised farm crops, sold cattle, had at one time a
sloop on the Hudson; and Noyes himself labored as a blacksmith, farmer,
and in many other employments.

Working thus under difficulties, they had sunk, by January, 1857, over
forty thousand dollars of their capital, but had gained valuable
experience in the mean time. They had concentrated all their people at
Oneida and Wallingford; and had set up some machinery at the former
place. In January, 1857, they took their first annual inventory, and
found themselves worth a little over sixty-seven thousand dollars. Their
perseverance

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

had conquered fortune, for in the next ten years the net profit of the
two societies amounted to one hundred and eighty thousand five hundred
and eighty dollars, according to this statement:

| “   | “           | 1866 | 13,198.74 |

During this time they made traps, traveling-bags and satchels,
mop-holders, and various other small articles, and put up preserved
fruits in glass and tin. They began at Wallingford, in 1851, making
match-boxes, and the manufacture of traveling-bags was begun in
Brooklyn, and later transferred to Oneida. Trap-making was begun at
Oneida in 1855; fruit-preserving in 1858, and in 1866 the silk
manufacture was established.

Meantime they bought land, until they have in 1874, near Oneida, six
hundred and fifty-four acres, laid out in orchards, vineyards, meadows,
pasture and wood land, and including several valuable water-powers; and
at Wallingford two hundred and forty acres, mainly devoted to grazing
and the production of small fruits. They have erected in both places
commodious and substantial dwellings and shops, and carry on at this
time a number of industries, of which some account will be found further
on.

The two communities, whose members are interchangeable at will and
whenever necessity arises, must be counted as one. At Oneida they have
founded a third, on a part of their land, called Willow Place, but this
too is but an offshoot of the central family. In February, 1874, they
numbered two hundred and eighty-three persons, of whom two hundred and
thirty-eight were at Oneida and Willow Place, and forty-five at
Wallingford. Of these one hundred and thirty-one were males,

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

and one hundred and fifty-two females. Of the whole number, sixty-four
were children and youth under twenty-one—thirty-three males and
thirty-one females. Of the two hundred and nineteen adults, one hundred
and five were over forty-five years of age—forty-four men and sixty-one
women.

They employ in both places from twenty to thirty-five farm laborers,
according to the season, and a number of fruit-pickers in the time of
small fruits. Besides, at Oneida they employ constantly two hundred and
one hired laborers, of whom one hundred and three are women,
seventy-five of whom work in the silk factory; sixty-seven of the men
being engaged in the trap works, foundry, and machine shops. At
Wallingford the silk works give employment to thirty-five hired women
and girls.

Originally, and for many years, these Communists employed no outside
labor in their houses; but with increasing prosperity they have begun to
hire servants and helpers in many branches. Thus at Oneida there are in
the laundry two men and five women; in the kitchen three men and seven
women; in the heating or furnace room two men; in the shoemaker's shop
two; and in the tailor's shop two—all hired people. At Wallingford they
hire three women and one man for their laundry.

These hired people are the country neighbors of the commune; and, as
with the Shakers and the Harmonists, they like their employers. These
pay good wages, and treat their servants kindly; looking after their
physical and intellectual well-being, building houses for such of them
as have families and need to be near at hand, and in many ways showing
interest in their welfare.

The members of the two societies are for the most part Americans, though
there are a few English and Canadians. There are among them lawyers,
clergymen, merchants, physicians, teachers; but the greater part were
New England farmers and mechanics. Former Congregationalists and
Presbyterians

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Episcopalians,
Methodists, and Baptists are among them—but no Catholics.

They have a great number of applications from persons desirous to become
members. During 1873 they received over one hundred such by letter,
besides a nearly equal number made in person. They are not willing now
to accept new members; but I believe they are looking about for a place
suitable for a new settlement, and would not be unwilling, if a number
of persons with sufficient means for another colony should present
themselves, to help them with teachers and guides.

In the year 1873 the Oneida Community produced and sold preserved fruits
to the value of $27,417; machine and sewing silk and woven goods worth
$203,784; hardware, including traps, chucks, silk-measuring machines and
silk-strength testers (the last two of their own invention), gate-hinges
and foundry castings, $90,447. They raised twenty-five acres of sweet
corn, six acres of tomatoes, two acres of strawberries, two of
raspberries; half an acre of currants, half an acre of grapes,
twenty-two acres of apples, and three and a half acres of pears.

Silk-weaving has been abandoned, as not suitable to them.

At the beginning of 1874 they were worth over half a million of dollars.

From the beginning, Noyes and his followers have made great use of the
press. Up to the time of their settlement at Oneida they had published
"Paul not Carnal;" two series of *Perfectionist; The Way of Holiness*,
the *Berean*, and *The Witness*. From Oneida they began at once to issue
the *Spiritual Magazine*, and, later, the *Free Church Circular*, which
was the beginning of their present journal, the *Oneida Circular*.
"Bible Communism" also was published at Oneida during the first year of
their settlement there. They did not aim to make money by their
publications, and the *Circular* was from the first published on terms
probably unlike

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

those of any other newspaper in the world. I take from an old number, of
the year 1853, the following announcement, standing at the head of the
first column:

"The *Circular* is published by Communists, and for Communists. Its main
object is to help the education of several confederated associations,
who are practically devoted to the Pentecost principle of community of
property. Nearly all of its readers outside of those associations are
Communists in principle. It is supported almost entirely by the free
contributions of this Communist constituency. A paper with such objects
and such resources cannot properly be offered for sale. Freely we
receive, and we freely give. Whoever wishes to read the *Circular* can
have it WITHOUT PAYING, OR PROMISING TO PAY, by applying through the
mail, or at 43 Willow Place, Brooklyn. If any one chooses to pay, he may
send TWO DOLLARS for the yearly volume; but he must not require us to
keep his accounts. We rely on the free gifts of the family circle for
which we labor."

This paper was published on these terms, at one time semi-weekly, and at
another three times a week. For some years past it has appeared weekly,
printed on extremely good paper, and an admirable specimen of
typography; and it has now at the head of its columns the following
notice:

"The *Circular* is sent to all applicants, whether they pay or not. It
costs and is worth at least two dollars per volume. Those who want it
and ought to have it are divisible into three classes, viz.: 1, those
who can not afford to pay two dollars; 2, those who can afford to pay
*only* two dollars; and, 3, those who can afford to pay *more* than two
dollars. The first ought to have it free; the second ought to pay the
cost of it; and the third ought to pay enough more than the cost to make
up the deficiencies of the first. This is the law of Communism. We have
no means of enforcing it, and no wish to do so, except by stating it and
leaving it to the good sense of those concerned. We take the risk of
offering the *Circular* to all without price; but free subscriptions
will be received only from persons making application for themselves,
either directly or by giving express authority to those who apply for
them.

"Foreign subscribers, except those residing in Canada, must remit with
their subscriptions money to prepay the postage."

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

They print now about two thousand copies per week, and lost last year
six hundred dollars in the enterprise, without reckoning what would have
had to be paid in any other work of the kind for literary labor.

A list of the works they have issued will be found, with the titles of
works issued by other communistic societies, at the end of the volume.

Aside from its religious and communistic teachings, the *Circular* has a
general interest, by reason of articles it often contains relating to
natural history and natural scenery, which, from different pens, show
that there are in the society some close observers of nature, who have
also the ability to relate their observations and experiences in
excellent English. In general, the style of the paper is uncommonly
good, and shows that there is a degree of culture among the Oneida
people which preserves them from the too common newspaper vice of fine
English.

Their publications deal with the utmost frankness with their own
religious and social theories and practices, and I suppose it may be
said that they aim to keep themselves and their doctrines before the
public. In this respect they differ from all the other Communistic
societies now existing in this country. That they are not without a
sense of humor in these efforts, the following, printed as
advertisements in the *Circular,* will show:

**GRAND FIRE ANNIHILATOR!—AN INVENTION** for overcoming Evil with Good
MEEK & LOWLY.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TO JEWELERS.—A SINGLE PEARL OF GREAT PRICE!** This inestimable Jewel
may be obtained by application to Jesus Christ, at the extremely low
price of "all that a man hath!"

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TO BROKERS.**

**WANTED**.—Any amount of SHARES OF SECOND-COMING STOCK, bearing date
A.D. 70, or thereabouts, will find a ready market and command a high
premium at this office.

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**ATTENTION!**

**SOLDIERS** who claim to have "fought the fight of faith" will find it
for their advantage to have their claims investigated. All who can
establish said claim are entitled to a bounty land-warrant in the
kingdom of Heaven, and a pension for eternity.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**ROOMS TO LET** in the "Many Mansions" that Christ has prepared for
those that love him.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**DIRECTIONS** for cultivating the fruits of the Spirit may be obtained
*gratis*, at MEEK & LOWLY'S, No. 1 Grace Court.

Practical Reflections on CHRIST'S SERMON ON THE MOUNT may be had also as
above.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**LEGAL NOTICE**.—Notice is hereby given that all claims issued by the
old firm of Moses and Law were canceled 1800 years ago. Any requirement,
therefore, to observe as a means of righteousness legal enactments
bearing date prior to A.D. 70, is pronounced by us, on the authority of
the New Testament, a fraud and imposition.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**THE EYES! THE EYES!!**—It is known that many persons with two eyes
habitually "see double." To prevent stumbling and worse liabilities in
such circumstances, an ingenious contrivance has been invented by which
the WHOLE BODY is filled with light. It is called the "SINGLE EYE," and
may be obtained by applying to Jesus Christ.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**WATER-CURE ESTABLISHMENT**.—I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and
ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness and from all your idols,
will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit
will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your
flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.—Ezekiel xxxvi., 25, 26.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**PATENT SIEVES**.—The series of sieves for CRITICISM having been
thoroughly tested, are now offered to the public for general use. They
are warranted to sift the tares from the wheat, and in all cases to
discriminate between good and evil. A person, after having passed
through this series, comes out free from the encumbrances of egotism,
pride, etc., etc. All persons are invited to test them gratuitously.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**MAGNIFICENT RESTAURANT!**—In Mount Zion will the Lord of hosts make
unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees; of
fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. And he
will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all
people, and the veil that is spread over all nations. He will swallow up
death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all
faces; and the rebuke of his people shall be taken away from off all the
earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.—Isaiah xxv., 6-8.

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**PATENT SALAMANDER SAFES**.—Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through
and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor
steal.—Matt, vi., 19, 20. This safe, having been submitted for 1800
years to the hottest fire of judgment, and having been through that time
subject to constant attacks from the fiery shafts of the devil, is now
offered to the public, with full confidence that it will meet with
general approbation. Articles enclosed in this safe are warranted free
from danger under any circumstances.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TO THE AFFLICTED!**—WINE and MILK for the hungry, REST for the weary
and heavy-laden, CONSOLATION and BALM for the wounded and invalids of
every description—may be had *gratis,* on application to the storehouse
of the Son of God.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The *Circular* contains each week extracts from journals kept in the two
communities, and "Talks" by Noyes and others, with a variety of other
matter relating to their belief and daily lives.
