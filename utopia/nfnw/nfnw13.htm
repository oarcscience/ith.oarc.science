<p>Said I: "How do you manage with politics?"</p>  
<p>Said Hammond, smiling: "I am glad that it is of ME that you ask that question; I do believe that anybody else would make you explain yourself, or try to do so, till you were sickened of asking questions. Indeed, I believe I am the only man in England who would know what you mean; and since I know, I will answer your question briefly by saying that we are very well off as to politics,&#8212;because we have none. If ever you make a book out of this conversation, put this in a chapter by itself, after the model of old Horrebow's Snakes in Iceland."</p>  
<p>"I will," said I.</p>
