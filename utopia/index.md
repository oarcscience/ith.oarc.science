------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dream of a golden age, first expressed by
[Hesiod](../cla/hesiod/index.md), and philosophical writings such as
Plato's [Republic](../cla/plato/rep/index.md), has become a recurring theme
in literature. Many have attempted to define the ideal society. For
some, the dream has turned into a nightmare, a dystopia. This page
includes the best of these speculations.
