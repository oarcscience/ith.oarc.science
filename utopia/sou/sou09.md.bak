### CHAPTER SIX

How something happened in the eighteenth century which made men
"furiously to think," and how a whole group of utopias sprang out of the
upturned soil of industrialism.

### CHAPTER SIX

#### 1

THERE is a gap in the Utopian tradition between the seventeenth century
and the nineteenth. Utopia, the place that must be built, faded into
no-man's land, the spot to which one might escape; and the utopias of
Denis Vayrasse and Simon Berington and the other romancers of this
in-between period are in the line of Robinson Crusoe rather than the
Republic.

One finds the clue to this lapse in Tiphaigne de la Roche's Giphantia, a
sketch of what was and what is and what will be, and in particular, an
inquiry into the "Babylonian" mode of life. The author of Giphantia
tells a parable about Sophia, the incarnation of Wisdom, who rejects the
offers of the spendthrift, the merchant, the soldier, and the student,
and accepts the suit of a diffident fellow who had retired in solitude
to the country, to spend his days like a cultivated gentleman. One
remembers the way in which Montaigne spent his declining years; one
remembers Voltaire; and one sees how deeply the ideal of Robinson
Crusoe—a cultivated Robinson Crusoe, surrounded with books and beyond
the reach of any king and court—colored the deepest aspirations of this
period. Rousseau, writing about the corrupting influence of the arts and
sciences, and Chateaubriand, seeking the noble savage in the American
wilderness and finding him in his own bosom—these men struck the
dominating note of the

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

eighteenth century. In a society that was already painfully artificial
and "arranged" the institutes of Lycurgus and Utopus must have seemed as
repressive as those of Louis XIV. So almost two centuries pass before we
find any fresh regions to explore in Utopia.

#### 2

The Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and those of the later men of the
Renascence, arose, as I have pointed out, from the contrast between the
possibilities that lay open beyond the sea and the dismal conditions
that attended the breakdown of the town economy of the Middle Age. Like
Plato's Republic, it attempted to face the difficult problem of
transition.

In the course of the next three centuries the adventure of exploring and
ransacking strange countries loses its hold upon men's imagination; and
a new type of activity becomes the center of interest. The conquest of
alien countries and the lure of gold do not indeed die out with this new
interest; but they are subordinated to another type of conquest—that
which man seeks to effect over nature. Here and there, particularly in
Great Britain, untrained men "with a practical turn" begin to busy
themselves with improving the mechanical [apparatus](errata.htm#3.md) by
which the day's labor is done. In a country parsonage a clergyman named
Arkwright invents a waterframe, a Scotchman named MacAdam discovers a
new method of laying roads; and out of a hundred such inventions during
the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries a new world comes
into existence—a world in which energy derived from coal and running
water takes the place of human

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

energy; in which goods manipulated by machinery take the place of goods
woven or sawed or hammered by hand. Within a hundred years the actual
world and the idola were transformed.

In this new world of falling water, burning coal, and whirring
machinery, utopia was born again. It is easy to see why this should have
happened, and why about two-thirds of our utopias should have been
written in the nineteenth century, The world was being visibly made
over; and it was possible to conceive of a different order of things
without escaping to the other side of the earth. There were political
changes, and the monarchic state was tempered by republicanism; there
were industrial changes, and two hungry mouths were born where one could
feed before; and there were social changes—the strata of society shifted
and "faulted," and men who in an earlier period would have been doomed
to a dull and ignominious round, perhaps, took a place alongside those
whom inheritance had given all the privileges of riches and breeding.

In contrast to all these fresh possibilities were the dismal realities
which were easily enough perceived by people who stood outside this new
order, or who by temperament revolted against the indignities and
repressions and vilenesses that accompanied it. It is not my particular
business here to deal with the facts of history; but unless one
understands the facts of history, the utopias which I am about to
present lose a good part of their meaning. Those machines whose output
was so great that all men might be clothed; those new methods of
agriculture and new agricultural implements, which promised crops so big
that all men might be fed—the very instruments that were to give

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

the whole community the physical basis of a good life turned out, for
the vast majority of people who possessed neither capital nor land, to
be nothing short of instruments of torture.

I do not speak too harshly of the early industrial age; it is impossible
to speak too harshly. 'Take the trouble to read Robert Owen's "Essay on
the Formation of Character" (Manchester: 1837) and learn what conditions
were like in a model factory run by an enlightened employer: it is a
picture of unmitigated brutality. One must go back to the blackest
periods of ancient slavery for a parallel, if indeed one would find it,
for the Pyramids that were built under the lash have a certain grandeur
and permanence which justify their existence, whilst the goods which
were produced in Yorkshire through the maimed bodies of pauper children
proved to be as impermanent as the lives that were sacrificed in making
them.

Those who were inside this new order—the Gradgrinds and Bounderbys whom
Dickens pictures in "Hard Times"—sought to realize their utopia of the
Iron Age on earth. When we are through with the genuine utopians we
shall examine the idola by which all the "practical" men of the
nineteenth century, Marx as well as Macaulay, patterned their behavior.
Those who stood out against this new order were not so much opposed to
the new methods as to the purposes for which they were being used: they
felt that an orderly conquest of Nature had turned into a wild scramble
for loot, and that all the goods industrialism promised were being lost,
for the benefit of a few aggressive and unsocialized individuals. With
the host of critics and interpreters and reformers that arose in the
nineteenth

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

century we shall have a little reckoning to make presently: those who
concern us here however belong to the stock of Plato, More, and Andreæ,
in that they attempted to see society as a whole, and to protect a new
order which would be basically sound as well as superficially improved.
Yet with the exception of the utopias which revolted against
industrialism these nineteenth century essays are partial and one-sided;
for they tend to magnify the importance of the industrial order as much
as Gradgrind and Bounderby did, and in doing this they lose sight of the
whole life of man. These industrial utopias are no longer concerned with
values but with means; they are all instrumentalist. I doubt whether an
intelligent peasant in India or China would get out of the whole batch
of these utopias a single idea which would have any bearing on the life
that he has experienced—so little of human significance remains when the
problems of mechanical and political organization have been disposed of!

One symptom of this lack of individuality, this lack of what, in the
old-fashioned sense used to be called a philosophy, is the fact that we
can treat all these industrial utopias in groups. The first of these
group-utopias I shall call, perhaps somewhat arbitrarily, the
Associationists.

#### 3

Among the Associationists, the most influential utopian is Charles
François Marie Fourier. He was a prolific and incoherent writer, and his
Utopia, if the truth be told, exists as disjecta membra rather than as a
single work; but in his case I make an exception to the criterion of
selection; because in every other respect

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

he has a claim upon our attention. This Fourier was a dry little French
commercial traveller, whose personal fortune was lost in the French
revolution and whose hopes for founding a real eutopia were blasted by
the July revolution of 1830. Again and again he transferred himself from
one line of goods to another in order to increase the area of the
territory he covered and learn more of the workings of society; and so
in his writings a wealth of concrete detail goes hand in hand with
personal crotchets and the opinionativeness which arises almost
inevitably out of an undisciplined solitude. What follows is a
distillation of Fourier's thought, with the lees and orts left in the
bottom of the flask.

Fourier differs largely from the early utopians in that he is concerned
first of all not with modifying human nature but with finding out what
it actually is. His utopia is to be based upon an understanding of man's
actual physical and mental makeup, and its institutions are to be such
as will permit man's original nature to function freely. The motive
which draws his community together is attraction; the power which sets
his institutions going is "the passions." Under the head of passions—the
original biological equipment—Fourier gives a list of tendencies which
corresponds roughly with the modern psychologist's list of instincts.

Fourier takes these passions as "given"; his utopia is not designed to
"effect any change in our passions . . . their direction will be changed
without changing their nature." As Brisbane says in his Introduction to
Fourier's philosophy, social institutions are to these passional forces
what machinery, is to material forces. A good community, according to

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fourier, is one
which will bring all these passions into play, in their complex actions
and interactions.

As in the Republic, the ideal behind Fourier's utopia is harmony; for
man has a threefold destiny; namely, "an industrial destiny, to
harmonize the material world; a social destiny, to harmonize the
passional or moral world; and an intellectual destiny, to discover the
laws of universal order and harmony." What was at fault with modern
civilized societies was that they were incomplete, and in their
functioning they created a social dissonance. To overcome this, says
Fourier, men must unite into harmonious associations which will give
play to all their activities, and which, by erecting common
institutions, will do away with the waste arising in the individual's
attempts to do for himself all the things which would be done by a
complete community.

For this perfect association Fourier provides minute plans and tables;
but the general plan can be outlined with brevity.

First of all, Fourier, too, goes back to the valley section. The initial
nucleus of his utopia is to consist of a company of 1,500 or 1,600
persons, owning a good stretch of land comprising at least a square
league. Since this experimental phalanx, as Fourier called it, would
have to stand alone, and without the support of neighboring phalanxes,
there will in consequence of this isolation be many gaps in
"attraction," and "many passional calms to dread in its workings." To
overcome this, Fourier insists that it is necessary to locate the
phalanx on soil fit for a variety of functions. "A flat country, such as
Antwerp, Leipsic, Orleans, would be totally unsuitable . . . owing to
the uniformity of land surface. It will therefore be necessary to select

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

a diversified region, like the surroundings of Lausanne, or at the very
least, a fine valley, provided with a stream of water and a forest, like
the valley of Brussel or of Halle."

This domain would be laid out in fields, orchards, vineyards, and so
forth, according to the nature of the soil and industrial requirements.
By devotion to horticulture and arboriculture, Fourier figures, an
intensive development would supply abundantly the needs of the colony.
The main economic occupation of the phalanx would be agricultural—this
is perhaps the great distinction between Fourier and later Utopians—but
all the arts would be practiced within the phalanstery, since otherwise
the association would be incomplete.

The principle of the association is concretely embodied in a vast
edifice in the center of the domain: "a palace complete in all its
appointments serving as the residence of the associates. In this palace
there are three wings, corresponding to the Material, the Social, and
the Intellectual domains. In one wing are the workshops and halls of
industry. In another are the library, the scientific collections,
museums, artists' studios, and the like. In the center, devoted to the
social element, are banquet halls, a hall of reception, and grand
salons. At one end of the palace is a Temple of the Material Harmonies,
devoted to singing, music, poetry, dancing, gymnastics, painting, and so
forth. At the other end is the Temple of Unityism, to celebrate with
appropriate rites man's unity with the universe. On the summit there is
an observatory with telegraph and signal tower, for communication with
other phalanxes.

The phalanx men are associationists; but it follows

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

from Fourier's theory of the passions that they have private interests
as well as public ones; and these private interests are permitted to
flourish as long as they do not interfere with social solidarity. Thus
they avoid the waste inherent in private housekeeping by having public
kitchens, where, incidentally, the children are trained from an early
age at cooking, as they are today in one or two experimental schools:
nevertheless it is possible to dine in solitude as well as in company.
By the same token, every member of the phalanx is guaranteed a minimum
of food, clothing, lodging, and even amusements without respect to work;
at the same time, private property is sanctioned, and each member
extracts from the common store a dividend in proportion to the amount of
stock he holds in the association. This dividend, it must be qualified,
is considerably reduced by the fact that a system of profit sharing
replaces the pure wage system. There is thus a sort of balance between
private self-seeking and the maintenance of the public good.

In order to manufacture goods economically, large scale production is
introduced wherever possible, and the division of labor is forced to its
ultimate limits. Fourier takes account of the resulting monotony,
however, and suggests that the monotony be corrected by having recourse
to changing tasks and occupations from time to time. In commercial
exchange, the phalanx acts as a unit; it constitutes a great
self-governing body which traffics in surplus goods with similar
associations, without any middleman, in something of the manner,
perhaps, that the Co-operative Wholesale Societies do today.

By abolishing the individual household, the phalanx

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

gives a new freedom to women; and Fourier does not see how it is
possible to maintain the system of monogamic proprietorship once women
have a free choice of mates. So the women of the phalanx are not
intellectual nonentities; and since they no longer preside over the
individual home, they help run the whole community. Is it necessary to
add the common nurseries, the common schools, the informal education of
the children, and the number of other things which follow from this
emancipation?

Perhaps one of the most remarkable characteristics of this utopia is its
utilization of a moral equivalent for war, long before Professor William
James invented the phrase. One of the great functions of the phalanx is
the assemblage of productive armies even as "civilization" assembles
destructive ones. There is a fine passage in which Fourier pictures an
industrial army of golden youths and maidens, "instead of devastating
thirty provinces in a campaign, these armies will have spanned thirty
rivers with bridges, re-wooded thirty barren mountains, dug thirty
trenches for irrigation, and drained thirty marshes." It is for lack of
such industrial armies, says Fourier, that civilization is unable to
produce anything great.

What strikes us when we put together the fragments of Fourier's
utopia—as one might put together a jigsaw puzzle—is the fact that he
faces the variety and inequality of human nature. Instead of erecting a
standard for men to live up to, and rejecting mankind as unfit for
utopia because the standard is far beyond

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

its height, the standard itself is founded upon the utmost capacity
which a community might be able to exhibit. Fourier meets human nature
half-way: he endeavors to project a society which will give regular
channels to all its divergent impulses, and prevent them from spilling
unsocially all over the landscape. In his statement of this aim there
are plenty of weaknesses and absurdities; and I confess that it is hard
to take this pathetic little man seriously; but when one has grappled
with Fourier's thought one discovers that there is something to take.

Fourier died without persuading anyone to give a trial to his scheme of
association; and yet his work was not without its practical influence.
The Brook Farm experiment in America was a fumbling attempt to plant a
phalanstery without paying any attention to the conditions which Fourier
would have rigorously imposed; and the "familistere" of the great steel
works of Godin at Guise, in France, is another direct result of
Fourier's inspiration. He remains, I believe, the first man who had a
plan for colonizing the wilderness of industrial barbarism that existed
at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and redeeming that
wilderness to civilization.

#### 5

The name of Robert Owen is usually associated with utopianism; but his
work belongs more to the "real" world than to the idola of utopia; and I
pass over him with the briefest mention, for his projects for a model
industrial town have more of the flavor of a poor colony than that of a
productive human society. Let us grant him good intentions, organizing
ability, and moral

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

fervor: without doubt he is a noble figure, even when his attitude is
strained and his tone strident. The series of essays he wrote on love
and marriage are marked by fine sympathy and common sense; and it is to
be regretted that they are not as widely known as his plans for a new
moral world. If this little note can repair the neglect, I have done
Owen ample justice: as an active figure in English and American public
life he is properly a subject for the social historian. With Owen I must
also dismiss John Ruskin, who began in the last quarter of the
nineteenth century to develop plans for a "Guild of St. George." This
guild was to form a little island of honest labor and sound education in
the midst of the turbid sea of industrialism; but it did not embrace the
whole of society, and it was utopian only in the sense that the Oneida
Community, let us say, was utopian. While they are full of pregnant
suggestions, the plans for the Guild are as fragmentary as the New
Atlantis.

One of the neglected utopias of the mid-nineteenth century is that of
James Buckingham.

James Buckingham was one of those erratic men of affairs which the
fertile soil of British individualism produces, and which hard British
common sense persistently ignores. Like Owen, Buckingham was acquainted
with industrial and commercial affairs from the inside: he travelled
widely and wrote upon various matters with that copious, amateurish
dogmatism and spirit which marks him, perhaps, as the philistine
counterpart of John Ruskin. If the utopias of the past express the
ideals of the soldier, the farmer, and

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

the artisan, the community which Buckingham projected represents the
ideal of the bourgeoisie. Buckingham's Victoria is the ideal aspect of
that Coketown which in a later chapter we shall attempt to describe.

We talk loosely of the individualism of the nineteenth century; but in
reality it was a period that was thriving with associations. The scope
of joint stock companies and philanthropic societies had immeasurably
widened. Along with the Mudfog Association, "for the advancement of
everything," which Dickens satirized, there sprang up a hundred
different societies for performing some special function in the
industrial system or realizing some particular purpose in society.
Buckingham gives us a picture of his contemporaries which is also a
criticism:

"We have the government of the country itself, passing acts of
parliament for the better drainage of towns, and a more ample supply of
water and air for ventilation. . . . Hence, too, arise associations of
noblemen and others for building model lodging houses for the labouring
classes; associations for improving the dwellings of the poor; societies
for providing baths and bath houses for families unable to procure such
conveniences for themselves; associations for establishing suburban
villages for the working classes, and to get them at night at least out
of the crowded haunts and vicious atmosphere of the towns. And hence we
have Temperance Societies, Tract Societies, Home Missions, Asylums for
Repentant Magdalens, Homes for Seaman out of Employ, and Houses of
Refuge for the Destitute, with soup kitchens and other modes of
temporary relief. . . ."

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

What does this all come to? Let Buckingham answer:

"They are, after all, mere palliatives, and do not reach the seat of the
disease. . . . This can only be done by uniting the disjointed efforts
of all these well-meaning but partially curative bodies into one, in
order to achieve, by their union of means, influence, and example, the
erection of a "Model Society," with its model farms, model pastures,
model mines, model manufactures, model town, model schools, model
workshops, model kitchens, model libraries, and places of recreation,
enjoyment, and instruction; all of which could be united in one new
Association."

Without inquiring too closely into what a model pasture may be, we may
admit that the notion behind Buckingham's proposal was not unsound. The
industrial society of his day was in an inchoate, indeed in a chaotic
state. In order to sift out the necessary institutions and put them on a
firm basis, it was the better part of wisdom to start anew on a fresh
area of land and attempt to plan the development of the community as a
whole. It is true that in this proposal of Buckingham's there is none of
Fourier's brilliant intuitions of a true social order, and none of
Buskin's critical inquiry into what composed a good life: Buckingham
took contemporary values for granted. What he sought to do was to
realize these values completely, and in orderly fashion. Here are the
elements of his proposal.

There is to be formed a model town association, with a limited
liability, for the purpose of building a new town called Victoria. The
town is to contain every improvement in "position, plan, drainage,
ventilation,

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

architecture, supply of water, light, arid every other elegance and
convenience." Its size is to be about a mile square and the number of
inhabitants is not to exceed 10,000. A suitable variety of manufactures
and handicraft trades is to be established near the edge of the town;
and the town itself is to be surrounded by farm land 10,000 acres broad.
All of the lands, houses, factories, and materials are to be the
property of the company, and not of any individual; and this property is
to be held for the benefit of all in proportion as their shares entitle
them. No person is to be a member of the company or an inhabitant of the
town except one who is a bona fide shareholder to the extent of at least
twenty pounds, and who is ready to subscribe to a drastic series of blue
laws which, while permitting freedom in religious worship and preventing
child labor, do away with liquor, drugs, and even tobacco.

In addition to these provisions there are to be common laundries,
kitchens, refectories, and nurseries; and medical advice is to be given
free, at home or in the hospital, as in the army and navy. Education is
to be undertaken by the community. Justice, it should be noted by those
who are acquainted with an experiment which has recently been started in
New York, is to be administered by competent arbitrators under a written
code of laws, without the expense, delay, and uncertainty of ordinary
legal proceedings. All members are to sign declarations accepting
arbitration and waiving other legal proceedings against members of the
company.

All these affairs, especially the manner in which the town is to be
built, are worked out in considerable detail; thus the size and
character of the houses are set

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

forth on the plan, and it is provided that each workingman is to occupy
at least one entire and separate room for himself; whilst each married
couple without children gets two rooms, and each family in which there
are children is to occupy at least three rooms for domestic purposes. I
have set down all these details baldly because the plan itself is a bald
one; and no amount of fine writing will embellish it. Buckingham's
society is not based upon a thoroughgoing criticism of human
institutions: the ends for which this society exists are doubtless those
which were held good and proper by the Macaulays and the Martineaus.
What is interesting in Buckingham's utopia is the definite plans and
specifications, accompanied by drawings; for this is surely one of the
first attempts to put a problem in social engineering on a basis from
which an engineer or an architect could work.

Buckingham thought that, given a successful model town, the rest of
England might in time be colonized by the surplus population, and thus
the old centers of black industry would he wiped out. Nor was Buckingham
altogether deceived. His utopia was a limited one, but out of his
limitations has come success. In 1848 this utopia was a chimera; in
1898, Mr. Ebenezer Howard reconstructed it and set it forth in a
persuasive little book called Tomorrow, and as a direct result of the
plans advocated by Mr. Howard, a flourishing Garden City called
Letchworth has come into existence; which in turn has propagated another
garden city, called Wellwyn; and at the same time has, by example, paved
the way for numerous other garden cities and garden suburbs in various
parts of Europe and in America.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

With this mid-Victorian theorist, we pass over from a pre-scientific
method of thinking to one which sacrifices the artistic imagination to a
realistic grasp of the facts; and in this passage something is gained
and something is lost. Buckingham gains by confining his proposals to
what is immediately practicable. He loses by not having the imaginative
energy to criticize the ways, means, and ends that are sanctioned by
current practise. If utopia begins with Plato's glorious dream of an
organic community, the image of the just man made perfect, it cannot end
with Buckingham's invention of a shell. Nevertheless, through the
nineteenth century the superficial utopians, the shell-builders, are
dominant; and we must continue to examine them.
