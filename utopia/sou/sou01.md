### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The first outline of this book dates back ten years; and since then I
have woven it and rewoven it in my mind. The actual work of composition
was started by a suggestion from Mr. Van Wyck Brooks; and without Mr.
Brooks’ encouragement I should perhaps never have begun or carried
through the task. The general background of ideas has been heavily
colored by my contacts with Professor Patrick Geddes, through his books
and by correspondence; and I owe a debt to him I have not always been
able to acknowledge in direct reference or in quotation marks. I take
the opportunity here to express the hearty gratitude which might
otherwise have been conveyed in the more archaic form of a dedication.

In the revision of the MS. I have been blessed with the generous advice
and criticism of a number of friends; in particular, Mr. Clarence
Britten, Mr. Herbert Feis, Mr. Geroid Robinson, and Miss Sophia
Wittenberg, each of whom performed a unique service. To Messrs. Victor
Branford and Alexander Farquharson of the Sociological Society of Great
Britain I am indebted for many pertinent suggestions. My thanks are also
due to the editors of The Freeman for permission to use extracts from
two articles: Towards a Humanist Synthesis and Beauty and the
Picturesque. Finally, Mr. Hendrik van Loon's friendly interest calls for
a departing beam of gratitude.
