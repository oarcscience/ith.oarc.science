# THE OWNER OF THE VOICE

There are works, and this is one of them, that are best begun with a
portrait of the author. And here, indeed, because of a very natural
misunderstanding this is the only course to take. Throughout these
papers sounds a note, a distinctive and personal note, a note that tends
at times towards stridency; and all that is not, as these words are, in
Italics, is in one voice. Now, this Voice, and this is the peculiarity
of the matter, is not to be taken as the Voice of the ostensible author
who fathers these pages. You have to clear your mind of any
preconceptions in that respect. The Owner of the Voice you must figure
to yourself as a whitish plump man, a little under the middle size and
age, with such blue eyes as many Irishmen have, and agile in his
movements and with a slight tonsorial baldness—a penny might cover it—of
the crown. His front is convex. He droops at times like most of us, but
for the greater part he bears himself as valiantly as a sparrow.
Occasionally his hand flies out with a fluttering gesture of
illustration. And his voice (which is our medium henceforth) is an
unattractive tenor that becomes at times aggressive. Him you must
imagine as sitting at a table reading a manuscript about Utopias, a
manuscript he holds in two hands that are just a little fat at the
wrist. The curtain rises upon him so. But afterwards, if the devices of
this declining art of literature prevail, you will go with him through
curious and interesting experiences. Yet, ever and a gain, you will find
him back at that little table, the manuscript in his hand, and the
expansion of his ratiocinations about Utopia conscientiously resumed.
The entertainment before you is neither the set drama of the work of
fiction you are accustomed to read, nor the set lecturing of the essay
you are accustomed to evade, but a hybrid of these two. If you figure
this owner of the Voice as sitting, a little nervously, a little
modestly, on a stage, with table, glass of water and all complete, and
myself as the intrusive chairman insisting with a bland ruthlessness
upon his "few words" of introduction before he recedes into the wings,
and if furthermore you figure a sheet behind our friend on which moving
pictures intermittently appear, and if finally you suppose his subject
to be the story of the adventure of his soul among Utopian inquiries,
you will be prepared for some at least of the difficulties of this
unworthy but unusual work.

But over against this writer here presented, there is also another
earthly person in the book, who gathers himself together into a distinct
personality only after a preliminary complication with the reader. This
person is spoken of as the botanist, and he is a leaner, rather taller,
graver and much less garrulous man His face is weakly handsome and done
in tones of grey, he is fairish and grey-eyed and you would suspect him
of dyspepsia. It is a justifiable suspicion. Men of this type, the
chairman remarks with a sudden intrusion of exposition, are romantic
with a shadow of meanness, they seek at once to conceal and shape their
sensuous cravings beneath egregious sentimentalities, they get into
mighty tangles and troubles with women, and he has has his troubles. You
will hear of them, for that is the quality of his type. He gets no
personal expression in this book, the Voice is always the other's, but
you gather much of the matter and something of the manner of his
interpolations from the asides and the tenour of the Voice.

So much by way of portraiture is necessary to present the explorers of
the Modern Utopia, which will unfold itself as a background to these two
inquiring figures. The image of a cinematograph entertainment is the one
to grasp. There will be an effect of these two people going to and fro
in front of the circle of a rather defective lantern, which sometimes
jams and sometimes gets out of focus, but which does occasionally
succeed in displaying on a screen a momentary moving picture of Utopian
conditions. Occasionally the picture goes out altogether, the Voice
argues and argues, and the footlights return, and then you find yourself
listening again to the rather too plump little man at his table
laboriously enunciating propositions, upon whom the curtain rises now.
