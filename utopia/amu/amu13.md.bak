# CHAPTER TEN

#### RACE IN UTOPIA

### SECTION 1

Above the sphere of the elemental cravings and necessities, the soul of
man is in a perpetual vacillation between two conflicting impulses: the
desire to assert his individual differences, the desire for distinction,
and his terror of isolation. He wants to stand out, but not too far out,
and, on the contrary, he wants to merge himself with a group, with some
larger body, but not altogether. Through all the things of life runs
this tortuous compromise, men follow the fashions but resent ready-made
uniforms on every plane of their being. The disposition to form
aggregations and to imagine aggregations is part of the incurable nature
of man; it is one of the great natural forces the statesman must
utilise, and against which he must construct effectual defences. The
study of the aggregations and of the ideals of aggregations about which
men's sympathies will twine, and upon which they will base a large
proportion of their conduct and personal policy, is the legitimate
definition of sociology.

Now the sort of aggregation to which men and women will refer themselves
is determined partly by the strength and idiosyncrasy of the individual
imagination, and partly by the reek of ideas that chances to be in the
air at the time. Men and women may vary greatly both in their innate and
their acquired disposition towards this sort of larger body or that, to
which their social reference can be made. The "natural" social reference
of a man is probably to some rather vaguely conceived tribe, as the
"natural" social reference of a dog is to a pack. But just as the social
reference of a dog may be educated until the reference to a pack is
completely replaced by a reference to an owner, so on his higher plane
of educability the social reference of the civilised man undergoes the
most remarkable transformations. But the power and scope of his
imagination and the need he has of response sets limits to this process.
A highly intellectualised mature mind may refer for its data very
consistently to ideas of a higher being so remote and indefinable as
God, so comprehensive as humanity, so far-reaching as the purpose in
things. I write "may," but I doubt if this exaltation of reference is
ever permanently sustained. Comte, in his *Positive Polity*, exposes his
soul with great freedom, and the curious may trace how, while he
professes and quite honestly intends to refer himself always to his
"Greater Being" Humanity, he narrows constantly to his projected
"Western Republic" of civilised men, and quite frequently to the minute
indefinite body of Positivist subscribers. And the history of the
Christian Church, with its development of orders and cults, sects and
dissents, the history of fashionable society with its cliques and sets,
and every political history with its cabals and inner cabinets, witness
to the struggle that goes on in the minds of men to adjust themselves to
a body larger indeed than themselves, but which still does not strain
and escape their imaginative grasp.

The statesman, both for himself and others, must recognise this
inadequacy of grasp, and the necessity for real and imaginary
aggregations to sustain men in their practical service of the order of
the world. He must be a sociologist; he must study the whole science of
aggregations in relation to that World State to which his reason and his
maturest thought direct him. He must lend himself to the development of
aggregatory ideas that favour the civilising process, and he must do his
best to promote the disintegration of aggregations and the effacement of
aggregatory ideas, that keep men narrow and unreasonably prejudiced one
against another.

He will, of course, know that few men are even rudely consistent in such
matters, that the same man in different moods and on different
occasions, is capable of referring himself in perfect good faith, not
only to different, but to contradictory larger beings, and that the more
important thing about an aggregatory idea from the State maker's point
of view is not so much what it explicitly involves as what it implicitly
repudiates. The natural man does not feel he is aggregating at all,
unless he aggregates *against* something. He refers himself to the
tribe; he is loyal to the tribe, and quite inseparably he fears or
dislikes those others outside the tribe. The tribe is always at least
defensively hostile and usually actively hostile to humanity beyond the
aggregation. The Anti-idea, it would seem, is inseparable from the
aggregatory idea; it is a necessity of the human mind. When we think of
the class A as desirable, we think of Not-A as undesirable. The two
things are as inevitably connected as the tendons of our hands, so that
when we flatten down our little fingers on our palms, the fourth digit,
whether we want it or not, comes down half-way. All real working gods,
one may remark, all gods that are worshipped emotionally, are tribal
gods, and every attempt to universalise the idea of God trails dualism
and the devil after it as a moral necessity.

When we inquire, as well as the unformed condition of terrestrial
sociology permits, into the aggregatory ideas that seem to satisfy men,
we find a remarkable complex, a disorderly complex, in the minds of
nearly all our civilised contemporaries. For example, all sorts of
aggregatory ideas come and go across the chameleon surfaces of my
botanist's mind. He has a strong feeling for systematic botanists as
against plant physiologists, whom he regards as lewd and evil scoundrels
in this relation, but he has a strong feeling for all botanists, and,
indeed, all biologists, as against physicists, and those who profess the
exact sciences, all of whom he regards as dull, mechanical, ugly-minded
scoundrels in this relation; but he has a strong feeling for all who
profess what is called Science as against psychologists, sociologists,
philosophers, and literary men, whom he regards as wild, foolish,
immoral scoundrels in this relation; but he has a strong feeling for all
educated men as against the working man, whom he regards as a cheating,
lying, loafing, drunken, thievish, dirty scoundrel in this relation; but
so soon as the working man is comprehended together with those others,
as Englishmen—which includes, in this case, I may remark, the Scottish
and Welsh—he holds them superior to all other sorts of European, whom he
regards, etc. . . .

Now one perceives in all these aggregatory ideas and rearrangements of
the sympathies one of the chief vices of human thought, due to its
obsession by classificatory suggestions.  <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) The necessity for marking our classes has
brought with it a bias for false and excessive contrast, and we never
invent a term but we are at once cramming it with implications beyond
its legitimate content. There is no feat of irrelevance that people will
not perform quite easily in this way; there is no class, however
accidental, to which they will not at once ascribe deeply distinctive
qualities. The seventh sons of seventh sons have remarkable powers of
insight; people with a certain sort of ear commit crimes of violence;
people with red hair have souls of fire; all democratic socialists are
trustworthy persons; all people born in Ireland have vivid imaginations
and all Englishmen are clods; all Hindoos are cowardly liars; all
curly-haired people are good-natured; all hunchbacks are energetic and
wicked, and all Frenchmen eat frogs. Such stupid generalisations have
been believed with the utmost readiness, and acted upon by great numbers
of sane, respectable people. And when the class is one's own class, when
it expresses one of the aggregations to which one refers one's own
activities, then the disposition to divide all qualities between this
class and its converse, and to cram one's own class with every desirable
distinction, becomes overwhelming.

It is part of the training of the philosopher to regard all such
generalisations with suspicion; it is part of the training of the
Utopist and statesman, and all good statesmen are Utopists, to mingle
something very like animosity with that suspicion. For crude
classifications and false generalisations are the curse of all organised
human life.

### SECTION 2

Disregarding classes, cliques, sets, castes, and the like minor
aggregations, concerned for the most part with details and minor aspects
of life, one finds among the civilised peoples of the world certain
broad types of aggregatory idea. There are, firstly, the national ideas,
ideas which, in their perfection, require a uniformity of physical and
mental type, a common idiom, a common religion, a distinctive style of
costume, decoration, and thought, and a compact organisation acting with
complete external unity. Like the Gothic cathedral, the national idea is
never found complete with all its parts; but one has in Russia, with her
insistence on political and religious orthodoxy, something approaching
it pretty closely, and again in the inland and typical provinces of
China, where even a strange pattern of hat arouses hostility. We had it
in vigorous struggle to exist in England under the earlier Georges in
the minds of those who supported the Established Church. The idea of the
fundamental nature of nationality is so ingrained in thought, with all
the usual exaggeration of implication, that no one laughs at talk about
Swedish painting or American literature. And I will confess and point
out that my own detachment from these delusions is so imperfect and
discontinuous that in another passage I have committed myself to a short
assertion of the exceptionally noble quality of the English imagination.
 <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) I am constantly gratified by
flattering untruths about English superiority which I should reject
indignantly were the application bluntly personal, and I am ever ready
to believe the scenery of England, the poetry of England, even the
decoration and music of England, in some mystic and impregnable way, the
best. This habit of intensifying all class definitions, and particularly
those in which one has a personal interest, is in the very constitution
of man's mind. It is part of the defect of that instrument. We may watch
against it and prevent it doing any great injustices, or leading us into
follies, but to eradicate it is an altogether different matter. There it
is, to be reckoned with, like the coccyx, the pineal eye, and the
vermiform appendix. And a too consistent attack on it may lead simply to
its inversion, to a vindictively pro-foreigner attitude that is equally
unwise.

The second sort of aggregatory ideas, running very often across the
boundaries of national ideas and in conflict with them, are religious
ideas. In Western Europe true national ideas only emerged to their
present hectic vigour after the shock of the Reformation had liberated
men from the great tradition of a Latin-speaking Christendom, a
tradition the Roman Catholic Church has sustained as its modification of
the old Latin-speaking Imperialism in the rule of the *pontifex*
*maximus*. There was, and there remains to this day, a profound
disregard of local dialect and race in the Roman Catholic tradition,
which has made that Church a persistently disintegrating influence in
national life. Equally spacious and equally regardless of tongues and
peoples is the great Arabic-speaking religion of Mahomet. Both
Christendom and Islam are indeed on their secular sides imperfect
realisations of a Utopian World State. But the secular side was the
weaker side of these cults; they produced no sufficiently great
statesmen to realise their spiritual forces, and it is not in Rome under
pontifical rule, nor in Munster under the Anabaptists, but rather in
Thomas a' Kempis and Saint Augustin's City of God that we must seek for
the Utopias of Christianity.

In the last hundred years a novel development of material forces, and
especially of means of communication, has done very much to break up the
isolations in which nationality perfected its prejudices and so to
render possible the extension and consolidation of such a world-wide
culture as mediæval Christendom and Islam foreshadowed. The first onset
of these expansive developments has been marked in the world of mind by
an expansion of political ideals—Comte's *Western Republic* (1848) was
the first Utopia that involved the synthesis of numerous States—by the
development of "Imperialisms" in the place of national policies, and by
the search for a basis for wider political unions in racial traditions
and linguistic affinities. Anglo-Saxonism, Pan-Germanism, and the like
are such synthetic ideas. Until the 'eighties, the general tendency of
progressive thought was at one with the older Christian tradition which
ignored "race," and the aim of the expansive liberalism movement, so far
as it had a clear aim, was to Europeanise the world, to extend the
franchise to negroes, put Polynesians into trousers, and train the
teeming myriads of India to appreciate the exquisite lilt of *The Lady
of the Lake*. There is always some absurdity mixed with human greatness,
and we must not let the fact that the middle Victorians counted Scott,
the suffrage, and pantaloons among the supreme blessings of life,
conceal from us the very real nobility of their dream of England's
mission to the world. . . .

We of this generation have seen a flood of reaction against such
universalism. The great intellectual developments that centre upon the
work of Darwin have exacerbated the realisation that life is a conflict
between superior and inferior types, it has underlined the idea that
specific survival rates are of primary significance in the world's
development, and a swarm of inferior intelligences has applied to human
problems elaborated and exaggerated versions of these generalisations.
These social and political followers of Darwin have fallen into an
obvious confusion between race and nationality, and into the natural
trap of patriotic conceit. The dissent of the Indian and Colonial
governing class to the first crude applications of liberal propositions
in India has found a voice of unparalleled penetration in Mr. Kipling,
whose want of intellectual deliberation is only equalled by his poietic
power. The search for a basis for a new political synthesis in adaptable
sympathies. based on linguistic affinities, was greatly influenced by
Max Müller's unaccountable assumption that language indicated kindred,
and led straight to wildly speculative ethnology, to the discovery that
there was a Keltic race, a Teutonic race, an Indo-European race, and so
forth. A book that has had enormous influence in this matter, because of
its use in teaching, is J. R. Green's *Short History of the English
People*, with its grotesque insistence upon Anglo-Saxonism. And just now
the world is in a sort of delirium about race and the racial struggle.
The Briton forgetting his Defoe,  <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md)
the Jew forgetting the very word proselyte, the German forgetting his
anthropometric variations, and the Italian forgetting everything, are
obsessed by the singular purity of their blood, and the danger of
contamination the mere continuance of other races involves. True to the
law that all human aggregation involves the development of a spirit of
opposition to whatever is external to the aggregation, extraordinary
intensifications of racial definition are going on; the vileness, the
inhumanity, the incompatibility of alien races is being steadily
exaggerated. The natural tendency of every human being towards a stupid
conceit in himself and his kind, a stupid depreciation of all
unlikeness, is traded upon by this bastard science. With the weakening
of national references, and with the pause before reconstruction in
religious belief, these new arbitrary and unsubstantial race prejudices
become daily more formidable. They are shaping policies and modifying
laws, and they will certainly be responsible for a large proportion of
the wars, hardships, and cruelties the immediate future holds in store
for our earth.

No generalisations about race are too extravagant for the inflamed
credulity of the present time. No attempt is ever made to distinguish
differences in inherent quality—the true racial differences—from
artificial differences due to culture. No lesson seems ever to be drawn
from history of the fluctuating incidence of the civilising process
first upon this race and then upon that. The politically ascendant
peoples of the present phase are understood to be the superior races,
including such types as the Sussex farm labourer, the Bowery tough, the
London hooligan, and the Paris apache; the races not at resent
prospering politically, such as the Egyptians, the reeks, the Spanish,
the Moors, the Chinese, the Hindoos, the Peruvians, and all uncivilised
people are represented as the inferior races, unfit to associate with
the former on terms of equality, unfit to intermarry with them on any
terms, unfit for any decisive voice in human affairs. In the popular
imagination of Western Europe, the Chinese are becoming bright gamboge
in colour, and unspeakably abominable in every respect; the people who
are black—the people who have fuzzy hair and flattish noses, and no
calves to speak of—are no longer held to be within the pale of humanity.
These superstitions work out along the obvious lines of the popular
logic. The depopulation of the Congo Free State by the Belgians, the
horrible massacre of Chinese by European soldiery during the Pekin
expedition, are condoned as a painful but necessary part of the
civilising process of the world. The world-wide repudiation of slavery
in the nineteenth century was done against a vast sullen force of
ignorant pride, which, reinvigorated by the new delusions, swings back
again to power.

"Science" is supposed to lend its sanction to race mania, but it is only
"science" as it is understood by very illiterate people that does
anything of the sort—"scientists'" science, in fact. What science has to
tell about "The Races of Man" will be found compactly set forth by
Doctor J. Deinker, in the book published under that title.  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) From that book one may learn the
beginnings of race charity. Save for a few isolated pools of savage
humanity, there is probably no pure race in the whole world. The great
continental populations are all complex mixtures of numerous and
fluctuating types. Even the Jews present every kind of skull that is
supposed to be racially distinctive, a vast range of complexion—from
blackness in Goa, to extreme fairness in Holland—and a vast mental and
physical diversity. Were the Jews to discontinue all intermarriage with
"other races" henceforth for ever, it would depend upon quite unknown
laws of fecundity, prepotency, and variability, what their final type
would be, or, indeed, whether any particular type would ever prevail
over diversity. And, without going beyond the natives of the British
Isles, one can discover an enormous range of types, tall and short,
straight-haired and curly, fair and dark, supremely intelligent and
unteachably stupid, straightforward, disingenuous, and what not. The
natural tendency is to forget all this range directly "race" comes under
discussion, to take either an average or some quite arbitrary ideal as
the type, and think only of that. The more difficult thing to do, but
the thing that must be done, if we are to get just results in this
discussion, is to do one's best to bear the range in mind.

Let us admit that the average Chinaman is probably different in
complexion, and, indeed, in all his physical and psychical proportions,
from the average Englishman. Does that render their association upon
terms of equality in a World State impossible? What the average Chinaman
or Englishman may be, is of no importance whatever to our plan of a
World State. It is not averages that exist, but individuals. The average
Chinaman will never meet the average Englishman anywhere; only
individual Chinamen will meet individual Englishmen. Now among Chinamen
will be found a range of variety as extensive as among Englishmen, and
there is no single trait presented by all Chinamen and no Englishman, or
*vice versa*. Even the oblique eye is not universal in China, and there
are probably many Chinamen who might have been "changed at birth," taken
away and educated into quite passable Englishmen. Even after we have
separated out and allowed for the differences in carriage, physique,
moral prepossessions, and so forth, due to their entirely divergent
cultures, there remains, no doubt, a very great difference between the
average Chinaman and the average Englishman; but would that amount to a
wider difference than is to be found between extreme types of
Englishmen?

For my own part I do not think that it would. But it is evident that any
precise answer can be made only when anthropology has adopted much more
exact and exhaustive methods of inquiry, and a far more precise analysis
than its present resources permit.

Be it remembered how doubtful and tainted is the bulk of our evidence in
these matters. These are extraordinarily subtle inquiries, from which
few men succeed in disentangling the threads of their personal
associations—the curiously interwoven strands of self-love and
self-interest that affect their inquiries. One might almost say that
instinct fights against such investigations, as it does undoubtedly
against many necessary medical researches. But while a long special
training, a high tradition and the possibility of reward and
distinction, enable the medical student to face many tasks that are at
once undignified and physically repulsive, the people from whom we get
our anthropological information are rarely men of more than average
intelligence, and of no mental training at all. And the problems are far
more elusive. It surely needs at least the gifts and training of a
first-class novelist, combined with a sedulous patience that probably
cannot be hoped for in combination with these, to gauge the all-round
differences between man and man. Even where there are no barriers of
language and colour, understanding may be nearly impossible. How few
educated people seem to understand the servant class in England, or the
working men! Except for Mr. Bart Kennedy's *A Man Adrift*, I know of
scarcely any book that shows a really sympathetic and living
understanding of the navvy, the longshore sailor man, the rough chap of
our own race. Caricatures, luridly tragic or gaily comic, in which the
misconceptions of the author blend with the preconceptions of the reader
and achieve success, are, of course, common enough. And then consider
the sort of people who pronounce judgments on the moral and intellectual
capacity of the negro, the Malay, or the Chinaman. You have
missionaries, native schoolmasters, employers of coolies, traders,
simple downright men, who scarcely suspect the existence of any sources
of error in their verdicts, who are incapable of understanding the
difference between what is innate and what is acquired, much less of
distinguishing them in their interplay. Now and then one seems to have a
glimpse of something really living—in Mary Kingsley's buoyant work, for
instance—and even that may be no more than my illusion.

For my own part I am disposed to discount all adverse judgments and all
statements of insurmountable differences between race and race. I talk
upon racial qualities to all men who have had opportunities of close
observation, and I find that their insistence upon these differences is
usually in inverse proportion to their intelligence. It may be the
chance of my encounters, but that is my clear impression. Common sailors
will generalise in the profoundest way about Irishmen, and Scotchmen,
and Yankees, and Nova Scotians, and "Dutchies," until one might think
one talked of different species of animal, but the educated explorer
flings clear of all these delusions. To him men present themselves
individualised, and if they classify it is by some skin-deep accident of
tint, some trick of the tongue, or habit of gesture, or such-like
superficiality. And after all there exists to-day available one kind at
least of unbiased anthropological evidence. There are photographs. Let
the reader turn over the pages of some such copiously illustrated work
as *The Living Races of Mankind*,  <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md)
and look into the eyes of one alien face after another. Are they not
very like the people one knows? For the most part, one finds it hard to
believe that, with a common language and common social traditions, one
would not get on very well with these people. Here or there is a brutish
or evil face, but you can find as brutish and evil in the Strand on any
afternoon. There are differences no doubt, but fundamental
incompatibilities—*no!* And very many of them send out a ray of special
resemblance and remind one more strongly of this friend or that, than
they do of their own kind. One notes with surprise that one's good
friend and neighbour X and an anonymous naked Gold Coast negro belong to
one type, as distinguished from one's dear friend Y and a beaming
individual from Somaliland, who as certainly belong to another.

In one matter the careless and prejudiced nature of accepted racial
generalisations is particularly marked. A great and increasing number of
people are persuaded that "half-breeds" are peculiarly evil creatures—as
hunchbacks and bastards were supposed to be in the middle ages. The full
legend of the wickedness of the half-breed is best to be learnt from a
drunken mean white from Virginia or the Cape. The half-breed, one hears,
combines all the vices of either parent, he is wretchedly poor in health
and spirit, but vindictive, powerful, and dangerous to an extreme
degree, his morals—the mean white has high and exacting standards—are
indescribable even in whispers in a saloon, and so on, and so on. There
is really not an atom of evidence an unprejudiced mind would accept to
sustain any belief of the sort. There is nothing to show that the
children of racial ad mixture are, as a class, inherently either better
or worse in any respect than either parent. There is an equally baseless
theory that they are better, a theory displayed to a fine degree of
foolishness in the article on Shakespeare in the *Encyclopædia*
*Britannica*. Both theories belong to the vast edifice of sham science
that smothers the realities of modern knowledge. It may be that most
"half-breeds" are failures in life, but that proves nothing. They are,
in an enormous number of cases, illegitimate and outcast from the normal
education of either race; they are brought up in homes that are the
battle-grounds of conflicting cultures; they labour under a heavy
premium of disadvantage. There is, of course, a passing suggestion of
Darwin's to account for atavism that might go to support the theory of
the vileness of half-breeds, if it had ever been proved. But, then, it
never has been proved. There is no proof in the matter at all.

### SECTION 3

Suppose, now, there is such a thing as an all-round inferior race. Is
that any reason why we should propose to preserve it for ever in a
condition of tutelage? Whether there is a race so inferior I do not
know, but certainly there is no race so superior as to be trusted with
human charges. The true answer to Aristotle's plea for slavery, that
there are "natural slaves," lies in that fact that there are no
"natural" masters. Power is no more to be committed to men without
discipline and restriction than alcohol. The true objection to slavery
is not that it is unjust to the inferior but that it corrupts the
superior. There is only one sane and logical thing to be done with a
really inferior race, and that is to exterminate it.

Now there are various ways of exterminating a race, and most of them are
cruel. You may end it with fire and sword after the old Hebrew fashion;
you may enslave it and work it to death, as the Spaniards did the
Caribs; you may set it boundaries and then poison it slowly with
deleterious commodities, as the Americans do with most of their Indians;
you may incite it to wear clothing to which it is not accustomed, and to
live under new and strange conditions that will expose it to infectious
diseases to which you yourselves are immune, as the missionaries do the
Polynesians; you may resort to honest simple murder, as we English did
with the Tasmanians; or you can maintain such conditions as conduce to
"race suicide," as the British administration does in Fiji. Suppose,
then, for a moment, that there is an all-round inferior race; a Modern
Utopia is under the hard logic of life, and it would have to exterminate
such a race as quickly as it could. On the whole, the Fijian device
seems the least cruel. But Utopia would do that without any clumsiness
of race distinction, in exactly the same manner, and by the same
machinery, as it exterminates all its own defective and inferior
strains; that is to say, as we have already discussed in Chapter Five,
Section 1, by its marriage laws, and by the laws of the minimum wage.
That extinction need never be discriminatory. If any of the race did,
after all, prove to be fit to survive they would survive—they would be
picked out with a sure and automatic justice from the over-ready
condemnation of all their kind.

Is there, however, an all-round inferior race in the world? Even the
Australian black-fellow is, perhaps, not quite so entirely eligible for
extinction as a good, wholesome, horse-racing, sheep-farming Australian
white may think. These queer little races, the black fellows, the
Pigmies, the Bushmen, may have their little gifts, a greater keenness, a
greater fineness of this sense or that, a quaintness of the imagination
or what not, that may serve as their little unique addition to the
totality of our Utopian civilisation. We are supposing that every
individual alive on earth is alive in Utopia, and so all the surviving
"black-fellows" are there. Every one of them in Utopia has had what none
have had on earth, a fair education and fair treatment, justice, and
opportunity. Suppose that the common idea is right about the general
inferiority of these people, then it would follow that in Utopia most of
them are childless, and working at or about the minimum wage, and some
will have passed out of all possibility of offspring under the hand of
the offended law; but still—cannot we imagine some few of these little
people—whom you must suppose neither naked nor clothed in the European
style, but robed in the Utopian fashion—may have found some delicate art
to practise, some peculiar sort of carving, for example, that justifies
God in creating them? Utopia has sound sanitary laws, sound social laws,
sound economic laws; what harm are these people going to do?

Some may be even prosperous and admired, may have married women of their
own or some other race, and so may be transmitting that distinctive thin
thread of excellence, to take its due place in the great synthesis of
the future.

And, indeed, coming along that terrace in Utopia, I see a little figure,
a little bright-eyed, bearded man, inky black, frizzy haired, and clad
in a white tunic and black hose, and with a mantle of lemon yellow
wrapped about his shoulders. He walks, as most Utopians walk, as though
he had reason to be proud of something, as though he had no reason to be
afraid of anything in the world. He carries a portfolio in his hand. It
is that, I suppose, as much as his hair, that recalls the *Quartier*
*Latin* to my mind.

### SECTION 4

I had already discussed the question of race with the botanist at
Lucerne.

"But you would not like," he cried in horror, "your daughter to marry a
Chinaman or a negro?"

"Of course," said I, "when you say Chinaman, you think of a creature
with a pigtail, long nails, and insanitary habits, and when you say
negro you think of a filthy-headed, black creature in an old hat. You do
this because your imagination is too feeble to disentangle the inherent
qualities of a thing from its habitual associations."

"Insult isn't argument," said the botanist.

"Neither is unsound implication. You make a question of race into a
question of unequal cultures. You would not like your daughter to marry
the sort of negro who steals hens, but then you would also not like your
daughter to marry a pure English hunchback with a squint, or a drunken
cab tout of Norman blood. As a matter of fact, very few well-bred
English girls do commit that sort of indiscretion. But you don't think
it necessary to generalise against men of your own race because they are
drunken cab touts, and why should you generalise against negroes?
Because the proportion of undesirables is higher among negroes, that
does not justify a sweeping condemnation. You may have to condemn most,
but why *all*? There may be—neither of us knows enough to deny—negroes
who are handsome, capable, courageous."

"Ugh!" said the botanist.

"How detestable you must find Othello!"

It is my Utopia, and for a moment I could almost find it in my heart to
spite the botanist by creating a modern Desdemona and her lover sooty
black to the lips, there before our eyes. But I am not so sure of my
case as that, and for the moment there shall come nothing more than a
swart-faced, dusky Burmese woman in the dress of the Greater Rule, with
her tall Englishman (as he might be on earth) at her side. That,
however, is a digression from my conversation with the botanist.

"And the Chinaman?" said the botanist.

"I think we shall have all the buff and yellow peoples intermingling
pretty freely."

"Chinamen and white women, for example."

"Yes," I said, "you've got to swallow that, anyhow; you *shall* swallow
that."

He finds the idea too revolting for comment.

I try to make the thing seem easier for him. "Do try," I said, "to grasp
a Modern Utopian's conditions. The Chinaman will speak the same language
as his wife—whatever her race may be—he will wear costume of the common
civilised fashion, he will have much the same education as his European
rival, read the same literature, bow to the same traditions. And you
must remember a wife in Utopia is singularly not subject to her husband.
. . ."

The botanist proclaims his invincible conclusion: "Every one would cut
her!"

"This is Utopia," I said, and then sought once more to tranquillise his
mind. "No doubt among the vulgar, coarse-minded people outside the Rule
there may be something of the sort. Every earthly moral blockhead, a
little educated, perhaps, is to be found in Utopia. You will, no doubt,
find the \`cut' and the \`boycott,' and all those nice little devices by
which dull people get a keen edge on life, in their place here, and
their place here is somewhere——"

I turned a thumb earthward. "There!"

The botanist did not answer for a little while. Then he said, with some
temper and great emphasis: "Well, I'm jolly glad anyhow that I'm not to
be a permanent resident in this Utopia, *if our daughters are to be
married to Hottentots by regulation*. I'm jolly glad."

He turned his back on me.

Now did I say anything of the sort?...

I had to bring him, I suppose; there's no getting away from him in this
life. But, as I have already observed, the happy ancients went to their
Utopias without this sort of company.

### SECTION 5

What gives the botanist so great an advantage in all his Anti-Utopian
utterances is his unconsciousness of his own limitations. He thinks in
little pieces that lie about loose, and nothing has any necessary link
with anything else in his mind. So that I cannot retort upon him by
asking him, if he objects to this synthesis of all nations, tongues, and
peoples in a World State, what alternative ideal he proposes.

People of this sort do not even feel the need of alternatives. Beyond
the scope of a few personal projects, meeting Her again, and things like
that, they do not feel that there is a future. They are unencumbered by
any baggage of convictions whatever, in relation to that. That, at
least, is the only way in which I can explain our friend's high
intellectual mobility. Attempts to correlate statesmanship, which they
regard with interest as a dramatic interplay of personalities, with any
secular movement of humanity, they class with the differential calculus
and Darwinism, as things far too difficult to be anything but finally
and subtly wrong.

So the argument must pass into a direct address to the reader.

If you are not prepared to regard a world-wide synthesis of all cultures
and polities and races into one World State as the desirable end upon
which all civilising efforts converge, what do you regard as the
desirable end? Synthesis, one may remark in passing, does not
necessarily mean fusion, nor does it mean uniformity.

The alternatives fall roughly under three headings. The first is to
assume there is a best race, to define as well as one can that best
race, and to regard all other races as material for extermination. This
has a fine, modern, biological air ("Survival of the Fittest"). If you
are one of those queer German professors who write insanity about
Welt-Politik, you assume the best race is the "Teutonic"; Cecil Rhodes
affected that triumph of creative imagination, the "Anglo-Saxon race";
my friend, Moses Cohen, thinks there is much to be said for the Jew. On
its premises, this is a perfectly sound and reasonable policy, and it
opens out a brilliant prospect for the scientific inventor for what one
might call Welt-Apparat in the future, for national harrowing and
reaping machines, and race-destroying fumigations. The great plain of
China ("Yellow Peril") lends itself particularly to some striking
wholesale undertaking; it might, for example, be flooded for a few days,
and then disinfected with volcanic chlorine. Whether, when all the
inferior races have been stamped out, the superior race would not
proceed at once, or after a brief millennial period of social harmony,
to divide itself into sub-classes, and begin the business over again at
a higher level, is an interesting residual question into which we need
not now penetrate.

That complete development of a scientific Welt-Politik is not, however,
very widely advocated at present, no doubt from a want of confidence in
the public imagination. We have, however, a very audible and influential
school, the Modern Imperialist school, which distinguishes its own
race—there is a German, a British, and an Anglo-Saxon section in the
school, and a wider teaching which embraces the whole "white race" in
one remarkable tolerance—as the superior race, as one, indeed, superior
enough to own slaves, collectively, if not individually; and the
exponents of this doctrine look with a resolute, truculent, but slightly
indistinct eye to a future in which all the rest of the world will be in
subjection to these elect. The ideals of this type are set forth pretty
clearly in Mr. Kidd's *Control of the Tropics*. The whole world is to be
administered by the "white" Powers—Mr. Kidd did not anticipate Japan—who
will see to it that their subjects do not "prevent the utilisation of
the immense natural resources which they have in charge." Those other
races are to be regarded as children, recalcitrant children at times,
and without any of the tender emotions of paternity. It is a little
doubtful whether the races lacking "in the elementary qualities of
social efficiency" are expected to acquire them under the chastening
hands of those races which, through "strength and energy of character,
humanity, probity, and integrity, and a single-minded devotion to
conceptions of duty," are developing "the resources of the richest
regions of the earth" over their heads, or whether this is the ultimate
ideal.

Next comes the rather incoherent alternative that one associates in
England with official Liberalism.

Liberalism in England is not quite the same thing as Liberalism in the
rest of the world; it is woven of two strands. There is Whiggism, the
powerful tradition of seventeenth-century Protestant and republican
England, with its great debt to republican Rome, its strong constructive
and disciplinary bias, its broad and originally very living and
intelligent outlook; and interwoven with this there is the sentimental
and logical Liberalism that sprang from the stresses of the eighteenth
century, that finds its early scarce differentiated expression in
Harrington's *Oceana*, and after fresh draughts of the tradition of
Brutus and Cato and some elegant trifling with noble savages, budded in
*La Cité Morellyste*, flowered in the emotional democratic naturalism of
Rousseau, and bore abundant fruit in the French Revolution. These are
two very distinct strands. Directly they were freed in America from the
grip of conflict with British Toryism, they came apart as the Republican
and Democratic parties respectively. Their continued union in Great
Britain is a political accident. Because of this mixture, the whole
career of English-speaking Liberalism, though it has gone to one
unbroken strain of eloquence, has never produced a clear statement of
policy in relation to other peoples politically less fortunate. It has
developed no definite ideas at all about the future of mankind. The Whig
disposition, which once had some play in India, was certainly to attempt
to anglicise the "native," to assimilate his culture, and then to
assimilate his political status with that of his temporary ruler. But
interwoven with this anglicising tendency, which was also, by the bye, a
Christianising tendency, was a strong disposition, derived from the
Rousseau strand, to leave other peoples alone, to facilitate even the
separation and autonomy of detached portions of our own peoples, to
disintegrate finally into perfect, because lawless, individuals. The
official exposition of British "Liberalism" to-day still wriggles
unstably because of these conflicting constituents, but on the whole the
Whig strand now seems the weaker. The contemporary Liberal politician
offers cogent criticism upon the brutality and conceit of modern
imperialisms, but that seems to be the limit of his service. Taking what
they do not say and do not propose as an indication of Liberal
intentions, it would seem that the ideal of the British Liberals and of
the American Democrats is to favour the existence of just as many petty,
loosely allied, or quite independent nationalities as possible, just as
many languages as possible, to deprecate armies and all controls, and to
trust to the innate goodness of disorder and the powers of an ardent
sentimentality to keep the world clean and sweet. The Liberals will not
face the plain consequence that such a state of affairs is hopelessly
unstable, that it involves the maximum risk of war with the minimum of
permanent benefit and public order. They will not reflect that the stars
in their courses rule inexorably against it. It is a vague, impossible
ideal, with a rude sort of unworldly moral beauty, like the gospel of
the Doukhobors. Besides that charm it has this most seductive quality to
an official British Liberal, that it does not exact intellectual
activity nor indeed activity of any sort whatever. It is, by virtue of
that alone, a far less mischievous doctrine than the crude and violent
Imperialism of the popular Press.

Neither of these two schools of policy, neither the international
*laisser* *faire* of the Liberals, nor "hustle to the top" Imperialism,
promise any reality of permanent progress for the world of men. They are
the resort, the moral reference, of those who will not think frankly and
exhaustively over the whole field of this question. Do that, insist upon
solutions of more than accidental applicability, and you emerge with one
or other of two contrasted solutions, as the consciousness of kind or
the consciousness of individuality prevails in your mind. In the former
case you will adopt aggressive Imperialism, but you will carry it out to
its "thorough" degree of extermination. You will seek to develop the
culture and power of your kind of men and women to the utmost in order
to shoulder all other kinds from the earth. If on the other hand you
appreciate the unique, you will aim at such a synthesis as this Utopia
displays, a synthesis far more credible and possible than any other
Welt-Politik. In spite of all the pageant of modern war, synthesis is in
the trend of the world. To aid and develop it, could be made the open
and secure policy of any great modern empire now. Modern war, modern
international hostility is, I believe, possible only through the stupid
illiteracy of the mass of men and the conceit and intellectual indolence
of rulers and those who feed the public mind. Were the will of the mass
of men lit and conscious, I am firmly convinced it would now burn
steadily for synthesis and peace.

It would be so easy to bring about a world peace within a few decades,
was there but the will for it among men! The great empires that exist
need but a little speech and frankness one with another. Within, the
riddles of social order are already half solved in books and thoughts,
there are the common people and the subject peoples to be educated and
drilled, to be led to a common speech and a common literature, to be
assimilated and made citizens; without, there is the possibility of
treaties. Why, for example, should Britain and France, or either and the
United States, or Sweden and Norway, or Holland, or Denmark, or Italy,
fight any more for ever? And if there is no reason, how foolish and
dangerous it is still to sustain linguistic differences and custom
houses, and all sorts of foolish and irritating distinctions between
their various citizens! Why should not all these peoples agree to teach
some common language, French, for example, in their common schools, or
to teach each other's languages reciprocally? Why should they not aim at
a common literature, and bring their various common laws, their marriage
laws, and so on, into uniformity? Why should they not work for a uniform
minimum of labour conditions through all their communities? Why, then,
should they not—except in the interests of a few rascal plutocrats—trade
freely and exchange their citizenship freely throughout their common
boundaries? No doubt there are difficulties to be found, but they are
quite finite difficulties. What is there to prevent a parallel movement
of all the civilised Powers in the world towards a common ideal and
assimilation?

Stupidity—nothing but stupidity, a stupid brute jealousy, aimless and
unjustifiable.

The coarser conceptions of aggregation are at hand, the hostile, jealous
patriotisms, the blare of trumpets and the pride of fools; they serve
the daily need though they lead towards disaster. The real and the
immediate has us in its grip, the accidental personal thing. The little
effort of thought, the brief sustained effort of will, is too much for
the contemporary mind. Such treaties, such sympathetic international
movements, are but dream stuff yet on earth, though Utopia has realised
them long since and already passed them by.
