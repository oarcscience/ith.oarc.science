*A Modern Utopia*, by H.G. Wells \[1908\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

# A NOTE TO THE READER

This book is in all probability the last of a series of writings, of
which—disregarding certain earlier disconnected essays—my
*Anticipations* was the beginning. Originally I intended *Anticipations*
to be my sole digression from my art or trade (or what you will) of an
imaginative writer. I wrote that book in order to clear up the muddle in
my own mind about innumerable social and political questions, questions
I could not keep out of my work, which it distressed me to touch upon in
a stupid haphazard way, and which no one, so far as I knew, had handled
in a manner to satisfy my needs. But *Anticipations* did not achieve its
end. I have a slow constructive hesitating sort of mind, and when I
emerged from that undertaking I found I had still most of my questions
to state and solve. In *Mankind in the Making*, therefore, I tried to
review the social organisation in a different way, to consider it as an
educational process instead of dealing with it as a thing with a future
history, and if I made this second book even less satisfactory from a
literary standpoint than the former (and this is my opinion), I
blundered, I think, more edifyingly—at least from the point of view of
my own instruction. I ventured upon several themes with a greater
frankness than I had used in *Anticipations*, and came out of that
second effort guilty of much rash writing, but with a considerable
development of formed opinion. In many matters I had shaped out at last
a certain personal certitude, upon which I feel I shall go for the rest
of my days. In this present book I have tried to settle accounts with a
number of issues left over or opened up by its two predecessors, to
correct them in some particulars, and to give the general picture of a
*Utopia* that has grown up in my mind during the course of these
speculations as a state of affairs at once possible and more desirable
than the world in which I live. But this book has brought me back to
imaginative writing again. In its two predecessors the treatment of
social organisation had been purely objective here my intention has been
a little wider and deeper, in that I have tried to present not simply an
ideal, but an ideal in reaction with two personalities. Moreover, since
this may be the last book of the kind I shall ever publish, I have
written into it as well as I can the heretical metaphysical scepticism
upon which all my thinking rests, and I have inserted certain sections
reflecting upon the established methods of sociological and economic
science. . . .

The last four words will not attract the butterfly reader, I know I have
done my best to make the whole of this book as lucid and entertaining as
its matter permits, because I want it read by as many people as
possible, but I do not promise anything but rage and confusion to him
who proposes to glance through my pages just to see if I agree with him,
or to begin in the middle, or to read without a constantly alert
attention. If you are not already a little interested and open-minded
with regard to social and political questions, and a little exercised in
self-examination, you will find neither interest nor pleasure here. If
your mind is "made up" upon such issues your time will be wasted on
these pages. And even if you are a willing reader you may require a
little patience for the peculiar method I have this time adopted.

That method assumes an air of haphazard, but it is not so careless as it
seems. I believe it to be—even now that I am through with the book—the
best way to a sort of lucid vagueness which has always been my intention
in this matter. I tried over several beginnings of a Utopian book before
I adopted this. I rejected from the outset the form of the argumentative
essay, the form which appeals most readily to what is called the
"serious" reader, the reader who is often no more that the solemnly
impatient parasite of great questions. He likes everything in hard,
heavy lines, black and white, yes and no, because he does not understand
how much there is that cannot be presented at all in that way; wherever
there is any effect of obliquity, of incommensurables, wherever there is
any levity or humour or difficulty of multiplex presentation, he refuses
attention. Mentally he seems to be built up upon an invincible
assumption that the Spirit of Creation cannot count beyond two, he deals
only in alternatives. Such readers I have resolved not to attempt to
please here. Even if I presented all my tri-clinic crystals as systems
of cubes——! Indeed I felt it would not be worth doing. But having
rejected the "serious" essay as a form, I was still greatly exercised, I
spent some vacillating months, over the scheme of this book. I tried
first a recognised method of viewing questions from divergent points
that has always attracted me and which I have never succeeded in using,
the discussion novel, after the fashion of Peacock's (and Mr. Mallock's)
development of the ancient dialogue; but this encumbered me with
unnecessary characters and the inevitable complications of intrigue
among them, and I abandoned it. After that I tried to cast the thing
into a shape resembling a little the double personality of Boswell's
Johnson, a sort of interplay between monologue and commentator; but that
too, although it got nearer to the quality I sought, finally failed.
Then I hesitated over what one might call "hard narrative." It will be
evident to the experienced reader that by omitting certain speculative
and metaphysical elements and by elaborating incident this book might
have been reduced to a straightforward story. But I did not want to omit
as much on this occasion. I do not see why I should always pander to the
vulgar appetite for stark stories. And in short, I made it this. I
explain all this in order to make it clear to the reader that, however
queer this book appears at the first examination, it is the outcome of
trial and deliberation, it is intended to be as it is. I am aiming
throughout at a sort of shot-silk texture between philosophical
discussion in the one hand and imaginative narrative on the other.
