A huge bestseller in its day, *Looking Backwards* is a pure Utopia with
no dark notes. Like [Cæsar's Column](../cc/index) and [The Iron
Heel](../ih/index), we get huge swaths of exposition and a love story.
However, because the narrator pops up in the best of all possible worlds
(the USA in the year 2000), the story lacks the conflict and
characterizations which make the Donnelly and London works interesting.
The one part of the story with dramatic impact is an extended sequence
at the end where he revisits the harsh 19th Century he thought he had
left behind.

Bellamy predicts shopping malls, mass media (including sermons delivered
by telephone!) and, most notably, credit cards. The whole of future
society is explored, one component at a time; it gives the appearance of
a well-engineered Victorian machine, each part functional, rational and
a little bit cold to the touch. While this work had an enormous impact
at its time, today it is primarily of historical interest. However, this
is required reading if you are studying 19th Century utopian thought.
