# Chapter 21

It had been suggested by Dr. Leete that we should devote the next
morning to an inspection of the schools and colleges of the city, with
some attempt on his own part at an explanation of the educational system
of the twentieth century.

"You will see," said he, as we set out after breakfast, "many very
important differences between our methods of education and yours, but
the main difference is that nowadays all persons equally have those
opportunities of higher education which in your day only an
infinitesimal portion of the population enjoyed. We should think we had
gained nothing worth speaking of, in equalizing the physical comfort of
men, without this educational equality."

"The cost must be very great," I said.

"If it took half the revenue of the nation, nobody would grudge it,"
replied Dr. Leete, "nor even if it took it all save a bare pittance. But
in truth the expense of educating ten thousand youth is not ten nor five
times that of educating one thousand. The principle which makes all
operations on a large scale proportionally cheaper than on a small scale
holds as to education also."

"College education was terribly expensive in my day," said I.

"If I have not been misinformed by our historians," Dr. Leete answered,
"it was not college education but college dissipation and extravagance
which cost so highly. The actual expense of your colleges appears to
have been very low, and would have been far lower if their patronage had
been greater. The higher education nowadays is as cheap as the lower, as
all grades of teachers, like all other workers, receive the same
support. We have simply added to the common school system of compulsory
education, in vogue in Massachusetts a hundred years ago, a half dozen
higher grades, carrying the youth to the age of twenty-one and giving
him what you used to call the education of a gentleman, instead of
turning him loose at fourteen or fifteen with no mental equipment beyond
reading, writing, and the multiplication table."

"Setting aside the actual cost of these additional years of education,"
I replied, "we should not have thought we could afford the loss of time
from industrial pursuits. Boys of the poorer classes usually went to
work at sixteen or younger, and knew their trade at twenty."

"We should not concede you any gain even in material product by that
plan," Dr. Leete replied. "The greater efficiency which education gives
to all sorts of labor, except the rudest, makes up in a short period for
the time lost in acquiring it."

"We should also have been afraid," said I, "that a high education, while
it adapted men to the professions, would set them against manual labor
of all sorts."

"That was the effect of high education in your day, I have read,"
replied the doctor; "and it was no wonder, for manual labor meant
association with a rude, coarse, and ignorant class of people. There is
no such class now. It was inevitable that such a feeling should exist
then, for the further reason that all men receiving a high education
were understood to be destined for the professions or for wealthy
leisure, and such an education in one neither rich nor professional was
a proof of disappointed aspirations, an evidence of failure, a badge of
inferiority rather than superiority. Nowadays, of course, when the
highest education is deemed necessary to fit a man merely to live,
without any reference to the sort of work he may do, its possession
conveys no such implication."

"After all," I remarked, "no amount of education can cure natural
dullness or make up for original mental deficiencies. Unless the average
natural mental capacity of men is much above its level in my day, a high
education must be pretty nearly thrown away on a large element of the
population. We used to hold that a certain amount of susceptibility to
educational influences is required to make a mind worth cultivating,
just as a certain natural fertility in soil is required if it is to
repay tilling."

"Ah," said Dr. Leete, "I am glad you used that illustration, for it is
just the one I would have chosen to set forth the modern view of
education. You say that land so poor that the product will not repay the
labor of tilling is not cultivated. Nevertheless, much land that does
not begin to repay tilling by its product was cultivated in your day and
is in ours. I refer to gardens, parks, lawns, and, in general, to pieces
of land so situated that, were they left to grow up to weeds and briers,
they would be eyesores and inconveniencies to all about. They are
therefore tilled, and though their product is little, there is yet no
land that, in a wider sense, better repays cultivation. So it is with
the men and women with whom we mingle in the relations of society, whose
voices are always in our ears, whose behavior in innumerable ways
affects our enjoyment--who are, in fact, as much conditions of our lives
as the air we breathe, or any of the physical elements on which we
depend. If, indeed, we could not afford to educate everybody, we should
choose the coarsest and dullest by nature, rather than the brightest, to
receive what education we could give. The naturally refined and
intellectual can better dispense with aids to culture than those less
fortunate in natural endowments.

"To borrow a phrase which was often used in your day, we should not
consider life worth living if we had to be surrounded by a population of
ignorant, boorish, coarse, wholly uncultivated men and women, as was the
plight of the few educated in your day. Is a man satisfied, merely
because he is perfumed himself, to mingle with a malodorous crowd? Could
he take more than a very limited satisfaction, even in a palatial
apartment, if the windows on all four sides opened into stable yards?
And yet just that was the situation of those considered most fortunate
as to culture and refinement in your day. I know that the poor and
ignorant envied the rich and cultured then; but to us the latter, living
as they did, surrounded by squalor and brutishness, seem little better
off than the former. The cultured man in your age was like one up to the
neck in a nauseous bog solacing himself with a smelling bottle. You see,
perhaps, now, how we look at this question of universal high education.
No single thing is so important to every man as to have for neighbors
intelligent, companionable persons. There is nothing, therefore, which
the nation can do for him that will enhance so much his own happiness as
to educate his neighbors. When it fails to do so, the value of his own
education to him is reduced by half, and many of the tastes he has
cultivated are made positive sources of pain.

"To educate some to the highest degree, and leave the mass wholly
uncultivated, as you did, made the gap between them almost like that
between different natural species, which have no means of communication.
What could be more inhuman than this consequence of a partial enjoyment
of education! Its universal and equal enjoyment leaves, indeed, the
differences between men as to natural endowments as marked as in a state
of nature, but the level of the lowest is vastly raised. Brutishness is
eliminated. All have some inkling of the humanities, some appreciation
of the things of the mind, and an admiration for the still higher
culture they have fallen short of. They have become capable of receiving
and imparting, in various degrees, but all in some measure, the
pleasures and inspirations of a refined social life. The cultured
society of the nineteenth century --what did it consist of but here and
there a few microscopic oases in a vast, unbroken wilderness? The
proportion of individuals capable of intellectual sympathies or refined
intercourse, to the mass of their contemporaries, used to be so
infinitesimal as to be in any broad view of humanity scarcely worth
mentioning. One generation of the world to-day represents a greater
volume of intellectual life than any five centuries ever did before.

"There is still another point I should mention in stating the grounds on
which nothing less than the universality of the best education could now
be tolerated," continued Dr. Leete, "and that is, the interest of the
coming generation in having educated parents. To put the matter in a
nutshell, there are three main grounds on which our educational system
rests: first, the right of every man to the completest education the
nation can give him on his own account, as necessary to his enjoyment of
himself; second, the right of his fellow-citizens to have him educated,
as necessary to their enjoyment of his society; third, the right of the
unborn to be guaranteed an intelligent and refined parentage."

I shall not describe in detail what I saw in the schools that day.
Having taken but slight interest in educational matters in my former
life, I could offer few comparisons of interest. Next to the fact of the
universality of the higher as well as the lower education, I was most
struck with the prominence given to physical culture, and the fact that
proficiency in athletic feats and games as well as in scholarship had a
place in the rating of the youth.

"The faculty of education," Dr. Leete explained, "is held to the same
responsibility for the bodies as for the minds of its charges. The
highest possible physical, as well as mental, development of every one
is the double object of a curriculum which lasts from the age of six to
that of twenty-one."

The magnificent health of the young people in the schools impressed me
strongly. My previous observations, not only of the notable personal
endowments of the family of my host, but of the people I had seen in my
walks abroad, had already suggested the idea that there must have been
something like a general improvement in the physical standard of the
race since my day, and now, as I compared these stalwart young men and
fresh, vigorous maidens with the young people I had seen in the schools
of the nineteenth century, I was moved to impart my thought to Dr.
Leete. He listened with great interest to what I said.

"Your testimony on this point," he declared, "is invaluable. We believe
that there has been such an improvement as you speak of, but of course
it could only be a matter of theory with us. It is an incident of your
unique position that you alone in the world of to-day can speak with
authority on this point. Your opinion, when you state it publicly, will,
I assure you, make a profound sensation. For the rest it would be
strange, certainly, if the race did not show an improvement. In your
day, riches debauched one class with idleness of mind and body, while
poverty sapped the vitality of the masses by overwork, bad food, and
pestilent homes. The labor required of children, and the burdens laid on
women, enfeebled the very springs of life. Instead of these maleficent
circumstances, all now enjoy the most favorable conditions of physical
life; the young are carefully nurtured and studiously cared for; the
labor which is required of all is limited to the period of greatest
bodily vigor, and is never excessive; care for one's self and one's
family, anxiety as to livelihood, the strain of a ceaseless battle for
life--all these influences, which once did so much to wreck the minds
and bodies of men and women, are known no more. Certainly, an
improvement of the species ought to follow such a change. In certain
specific respects we know, indeed, that the improvement has taken place.
Insanity, for instance, which in the nineteenth century was so terribly
common a product of your insane mode of life, has almost disappeared,
with its alternative, suicide."
