# CHAPTER XXXV.

### THE LIBERATED PRISONER

About two o'clock that day Maximilian returned home. He was covered with
dust and powder-smoke, but there was no blood upon him. I did not see
him return; but when I entered the drawing-room I started back. There
was a stranger present. I could not long doubt as to who he was. He was
locked in the arms of Max's mother. He was a pitiful sight. A tall,
gaunt man; his short hair and stubby beard white as snow. He was
prematurely aged--his back was stooped--his pallid complexion reminded
one of plants grown in cellars; he had a dejected, timorous look, like
one who had long been at the mercy of brutal masters; his hands were
seamed and calloused with hard work; he was without a coat, and his
nether garments had curious, tiger-like stripes upon them. He was
sobbing like a child in the arms of his wife. He seemed very weak in
body and mind. Maximilian gave him a chair, and his mother sat down by
him, weeping bitterly, and holding the poor calloused hands in her own,
and patting them gently, while she murmured words of comfort and
rejoicing. The poor man looked bewildered, as if he could not quite
collect his faculties; and occasionally he would glance anxiously at the
door, as if he expected that, at any moment, his brutal masters would
enter and take him back to his tasks.

"Gabriel," said Maximilian,--and his face was flushed and
working,--"this is--or was--my father."

I took the poor hand in my own and kissed it, and spoke encouragingly to
him. And this, I thought, was once a wealthy, handsome, portly, learned
gentleman; a scholar and a philanthropist; and his only crime was that
he loved his fellow-men!

\[paragraph continues\] And upon how many such men have the prison doors
of the world closed--never to open again?

They took him away to the bath; they fed him; they put upon him the
clothes of a gentleman. He smiled in a childish way, and smoothed the
fine cloth with his hands; and then he seemed to realize, for the first
time, that he was, indeed, no longer a prisoner--that his jailers had
gone out of his life forever.

"I must go now," said Maximilian, hurriedly; "I will be back this
evening. I have a duty to perform."

He returned at nightfall. There was a terrible light in his eyes.

"I have avenged my father," he said to me, in a hoarse whisper. "Come
this way."

He took me into the library, for he would not have the women hear the
dreadful story. I shut the door. He said:

"I had made all the necessary arrangements to prevent the escape of the
Count and his accomplices. I knew that he would fly, at the first alarm,
to his yacht, which lies out in the harbor. He had ruined my father by
bribery; so I brought his own instrument to bear upon him, and bribed,
with a large sum, his confidential friend, who was in command of his
vessel, to deliver him up to me. As I had anticipated, the cunning
wretch fled to the yacht; they took him on board. Then they made him
prisoner. He was shackled and chained to the mast. He begged for his
life and liberty. He had brought a fortune with him in gold and jewels.
He offered the whole of it to his *friend*, as a bribe, for he surmised
what was coming. The faithful officer replied, as I had instructed him,
that the Count could not offer that treasure, for he himself had already
appropriated it to his own purposes. The miscreant had always had a
lively sense of the power of money for evil; he saw it now in a new
light--for he was penniless. After taking my father from the prison and
bringing him home, I arranged as to the other prisoners

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

and then went to the yacht. I introduced myself to the Count. I told him
that I had deceived his spies--that I had led a double life; that I had
joined the Brotherhood and had become one of its leading spirits, with
but two objects:--to punish him and his villainous associates and to
rescue my father. That, as they had destroyed my father for money, the
same instruments should now destroy him, through fear. That they were
all prisoners, and should die together a fearful death; but if they had
a hundred lives they could not atone for the suffering they had caused
one good and great-hearted man. They had compelled him, for years, to
work in the society of the basest of his species--at work too hard for
even a young and strong man; they had separated him from his family;
they had starved his mind and heart and body; they had beaten and
scourged him for the slightest offenses. He had suffered a thousand
deaths. It would be no equivalent to simply kill them. They should die
in prolonged agony. And as he--the Count--had always gone upon the
principle that it was right to work upon the weaknesses of others to
accomplish his purposes, I should imitate him. I should not touch him
myself.

"I then ordered the captain and his men to put him in the boat and carry
him ashore.

"He begged and pleaded and abased himself; he entreated and shrieked;
but he addressed hearts as hard as his own.

"On the river-bank were a body of my men. In the midst of them they had
the other prisoners--the corrupt judge, eight of the jurymen--four had
died since the trial--and the four lying witnesses. They were all
shackled together. A notary public was present, and they signed and
acknowledged their confessions, that they had been bribed to swear
against my father and convict him; and they even acknowledged, in their
terror, the precise sums which they had received for their dreadful
acts.

"'Spare me! spare me!' shrieked the Count, groveling on

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

the ground; 'only part of that money came from me. I was but the
instrument of the government. I was commanded to do as I did.'

"'The others have already gone to their account,' I replied, 'every man
of them. You will overtake them in a little while.'

"I ordered the prisoners to chain him to a stout post which stood in the
middle of one of the wharves. They were unshackled and did so with
alacrity; my men standing around ready to shoot them down if they
attempted to fly. The Count writhed and shrieked for help, but in a
little while he was securely fastened to the post. There was a ship
loaded with lumber lying beside the next wharf. I ordered them to bring
the lumber; they quickly piled it up in great walls around him, within
about ten feet of him; and then more and more was heaped around these
walls. The Count began to realize the death that awaited him, and his
screams were appalling. But I said to him:

"'O Count, be calm. This is not as bad as a sentence of twenty years in
the penitentiary for an honest and innocent man. And, remember, my dear
Count, how you have enjoyed yourself all these years, while my poor
father has been toiling in prison in a striped suit. Think of the roast
beef you have eaten and the wine you have consumed! And, moreover, the
death you are about to die, my dear Count, was once fashionable and
popular in the world; and many a good and holy man went up to heaven
from just such a death-bed as you shall have-a death-bed of fire and
ashes. And see, my good Count, how willingly these honest men, whom you
hired, with your damnable money, to destroy my father--see how willingly
they work to prepare your funeral pile! What a supple and pliant thing,
O Count, is human baseness. It has but one defect--it may be turned upon
ourselves! And then, O my dear Count, it shocks us and hurts our
feelings. But say your prayers, Count, say your

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

prayers. Call upon God, for He is the only one likely to listen to you
now.'

"'Here,' I said to the judge, 'put a match to the pile.'

"The miserable wretch, trembling and hoping to save his own life by his
superserviceable zeal, got down upon his knees, and lighted a match, and
puffed and blew to make the fire catch. At last it started briskly, and
in a few minutes the Count was screaming in the center of a roaring
furnace.

"I gave a preconcerted signal to my men. In the twinkling of an eye each
of the prisoners was manacled hand and foot, shrieking and roaring for
mercy.

"'It was a splendid joke, gentlemen,' I said to them, 'that you played
on my father. To send that good man to prison, and to go home with the
price of his honor and his liberty jingling in your pockets. It was a
capital joke; and you will now feel the finest point of the witticism.
In with them!'

"And high above the walls of fire they were thrown, and the briber and
the bribed--the villain and his instruments--all perished howling
together."

I listened, awestruck, to the terrible story. There was a light in Max's
eyes which showed that long brooding over the wrongs of his father and
the sight of his emaciated and wretched form had "worked like madness in
his brain," until he was, as I had feared, a monomaniac, with but one
idea--revenge.

"Max, dear Max." I said, "for Heaven's sake never let Christina or your
mother hear that dreadful story. It was a madman's act! Never think of
it again. You have wiped out the crime in blood; there let it end. And
leave these awful scenes, or you will become a maniac."

He did not answer me for a time, but looked down thoughtfully; and then
he glanced at me, furtively, and said:

"Is not revenge right? Is it not simply justice?"

"Perhaps so, in some sense," I replied; "and if you had killed those
base wretches with your own hand the world

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

could not have much blamed you. Remember, however, 'Vengeance is mine,
saith the Lord, and I will repay.' But to send them out of life by such
dreadful tortures! It is too terrible."

"But death," he said, "is nothing; it is the mere end of life--perhaps
of consciousness; and that is no atonement for years of suffering, every
day of which was full of more agony than death itself can wring from the
human heart."

"I will not argue with you, Max," I replied, "for you are wrong, and I
love you; but do you not see, when a heart, the kindest in the world,
could conceive and execute such a terrible revenge, that the condition
of the mind is abnormal? But let us change the gloomy subject. The
dreadful time has put 'tricks of desperation' in your brain. And it is
not the least of the crimes of the Oligarchy that it could thus pervert
honest and gentle natures, and turn them into savages. And that is what
it has done with millions. It has fought against goodness, and developed
wickedness."
