# CHAPTER X.

### PREPARATIONS FOR TO-NIGHT

The next morning I found Maximilian in conference with a stranger; a
heavily-built, large-jawed, uncommunicative man. As I was about to
withdraw my friend insisted that I should sit down.

"We have been making the necessary arrangements for next Monday night,"
he said. "The probabilities are great that we may be followed when we
leave the house, and traced. It will not do to go, as Rudolph suggested,
to the residence of any friend, and pass through it to another carriage.
The Oligarchy would visit a terrible vengeance on the head of the man
who so helped us to escape. I have instructed this gentleman to secure
us, through an agent, three empty houses in different parts of the city,
and he has done so; they stand in the center of blocks, and have rear
exits, opening upon other streets or alleys, at right angles with the
streets on which the houses stand. Then in these back streets he is to
have covered carriages with the fleetest horses he can obtain. Our
pursuers, thinking we are safely housed, may return to report our
whereabouts to their masters. Estella being missed the next day, the
police will visit the house, but they will find no one there to punish;
nothing but curtains over the windows."

"But," said I, "will they not follow the carriage that brought us there,
and thus identify its owner and driver, and force them to tell who
employed them?"

"Of course; I have thought of that, and provided for it. There are
members of the Brotherhood who have been brought from other cities in
disguise, and three of these will

have another carriage, which, leaving the Prince's grounds soon after we
do, will pursue our pursuers. They will be well armed and equipped with
hand-grenades of dynamite. If they perceive that the spies cannot be
shaken off, or that they propose to follow any of our carriages to their
stables, it will be their duty to swiftly overtake the pursuers, and, as
they pass them, fling the explosives under the horses' feet, disabling
or killing them. It will take the police some time to obtain other
horses, and before they can do so, all traces of us will be lost. If
necessary, our friends will not hesitate to blow up the spies as well as
the horses."

"But," I suggested, "will they not identify the man who rented the
houses?"

Maximilian laughed.

"Why," said he, "my dear Gabriel, you would make a conspirator yourself.
We will have to get you into the Brotherhood. We are too old to be
caught that way. The man who rented the houses has been brought here
from a city hundreds of miles distant; he was thoroughly disguised. As
soon as he engaged the buildings, and paid one month's rent in advance
for each, he left the city; and before to-morrow night he will be home
again, and without his disguise; and he could never be suspected or
identified as the same man. And," he added, "I do not propose that you
shall go into that lion's den unsupported. We will have twenty of the
Brotherhood, under Rudolph's management, scattered through the
household, as servants; and three hundred more will be armed to the
teeth and near at hand in the neighborhood; and if it becomes necessary
they will storm the house and burn it over the villians' heads, rather
than that you or Estella shall come to harm."

I pressed his hand warmly, and thanked him for his care of me, and of
one so dear to me.

He laughed. "That is all right," he said; "good and unselfish men are so
scarce in this world that one cannot do too

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

much for them. We must be careful lest, like the dodo and the great auk,
the breed becomes extinct."

"But," said I, "may not the Oligarchy find you out, even here?"

"No," he replied, "my identity is lost. Here I live, in my real
appearance, under a false name. But I have a house elsewhere, in which I
dwell disguised, but under my real name, and with an unreal character.
Here I am a serious, plotting conspirator; there I am a dissipated,
reckless, foolish spendthrift, of whom no man need be afraid. It chanced
that after certain events had occurred, of which I may tell you some
day, I did not return home for several years; and then I came for
revenge, with ample preparations for my own safety. I resumed my old
place in society with a new appearance and a new character. That
personage is constantly watched by spies; but he spends his time in
drunkenness and deeds of folly; and his enemies laugh and say, 'He will
never trouble us; he will be dead soon.' And so, with the real name and
the unreal appearance and character in one place, and a false name, but
the real appearance and character, in another, I lead a dual life and
thwart the cunning of my enemies, and prepare for the day of my
vengeance."

His eyes glowed with a baleful light as he spoke, and I could see that
some great injustice, "like eager droppings into milk," had soured an
otherwise loving and affectionate nature. I put my hand on his and said:

"My dear Max, your enemies are my enemies and your cause my cause, from
henceforth forever."

His face beamed with delight, as he replied:

"I may some day, my dear Gabriel, hold you to that pledge."

"Agreed," I responded; "at all times I am ready."

He gave his agent a roll of money, and with mutual courtesies they
separated.
