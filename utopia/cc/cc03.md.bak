# CHAPTER II.

### MY ADVENTURE

My Dear Heinrich:

I little supposed when I wrote you yesterday that twenty four hours
could so completely change my circumstances. Then I was a dweller in the
palatial Darwin Hotel, luxuriating in all its magnificence. Now I am
hiding in a strange house and trembling for my liberty;--but I will tell
you all.

Yesterday morning, after I had disposed by sample of our wool, and had
called upon the assayer of ores, but without finding him, to show him
the specimens of our mineral discoveries, I returned to the hotel, and
there, after obtaining directions from one of the clerks at the "Bureau
of Information," I took the elevated train to the great Central Park.

I shall not pause to describe at length the splendors of this wonderful
place; the wild beasts roaming about among the trees, apparently at
dangerous liberty, but really inclosed by fine steel wire fences, almost
invisible to the eye; the great lakes full of the different water fowl
of the world; the air thick with birds distinguished for the sweetness
of their song or the brightness of their plumage; the century-old trees,
of great size and artistically grouped; beautiful children playing upon
the greensward, accompanied by nurses and male servants; the whole scene
constituting a holiday picture. Between the trees everywhere I saw the
white and gleaming statues of the many hundreds of great men and women
who have adorned the history of this country during the last two hundred
years--poets, painters, musicians, soldiers, philanthropists, statesmen.

After feasting my eyes for some time upon this charming

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

picture of rural beauty, I left the Park. Soon after I had passed
through the outer gate,-guarded by sentinels to exclude the ragged and
wretched multitude, but who at the same time gave courteous admission to
streams of splendid carriages,--I was startled by loud cries of "Look
out there!" I turned and saw a sight which made my blood run cold. A
gray-haired, hump-backed beggar, clothed in rags, was crossing the
street in front of a pair of handsome horses, attached to a magnificent
open carriage. The burly, ill-looking flunkey who, clad in gorgeous
livery, was holding the lines, had uttered the cry of warning, but at
the same time had made no effort to check the rapid speed of his
powerful horses. In an instant the beggar was down under the hoofs of
the steeds. The flunkey laughed! I was but a few feet distant on the
side-walk, and, quick as thought, I had the horses by their heads and
pushed them back upon their haunches. At this moment the beggar, who had
been under the feet of the horses, crawled out close to the front wheels
of the carriage; and the driver, indignant that anything so contemptible
should arrest the progress of his magnificent equipage, struck him a
savage blow with his whip, as he was struggling to his feet. I saw the
whip wind around his neck; and, letting go the horses' heads, who were
now brought to a stand-still, I sprang forward, and as the whip
descended for a second blow I caught it, dragged it from the hand of the
miscreant, and with all my power laid it over him. Each blow where it
touched his flesh brought the blood, and two long red gashes appeared
instantaneously upon his face. He dropped his lines and shrieked in
terror, holding his hands up to protect his face. Fortunately a crowd
had assembled, and some poorly dressed men had seized the horses' heads,
or there would have been a run-away. As I raised my hand to lash the
brute again, a feminine shriek reached my ears, and I became aware that
there were ladies in the open barouche. My sense of politeness overcame
in an instant my rage, and I

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

stepped back, and, taking off my hat, began to apologize and explain the
cause of the difficulty. As I did so I observed that the occupants of
the carriage were two young ladies, both strikingly handsome, but
otherwise very unlike in appearance. The one nearest me, who had uttered
the shrieks, was about twenty years of age, I should think, with
aquiline features, and black eyes and hair; every detail of the face was
perfect, but there was a bold, commonplace look out of the bright eyes.
Her companion instantly arrested all my attention. It seemed to me I had
never beheld a more beautiful. and striking countenance. She was
younger, by two or three years, than her companion; her complexion was
fairer; her long golden hair fell nearly to her waist, enfolding her
like a magnificent, shining garment; her eyes were blue and large and
set far apart; and there was in them, and in the whole contour of the
face, a look of honesty and dignity, and calm intelligence, rarely
witnessed in the countenance of woman. She did not appear to be at all
alarmed; and when I told my story of the driver lashing the aged beggar,
her face lighted up, and she said, with a look that thrilled me, and in
a soft and gentle voice: "We are much obliged to you, sir; you did
perfectly right."

I was about to reply, when I felt some one tugging fiercely at my coat,
and turning around, I was surprised to find that the beggar was drawing
me away from the carriage by main force. I was astonished also at the
change in his appearance. The aspect of decrepitude had disappeared, a
green patch that I had noticed covering one of his eyes had fallen off,
and his black eyes shone with a look of command and power that was in
marked contrast with his gray hair, his crooked back, and his rags.

"Come," he said, in a hoarse whisper, "come quickly, or you will be
arrested and cast into prison."

"What for?" I asked.

"I will tell you hereafter--look!"

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

I looked around me and saw that a great crowd had collected as if by
magic, for this city of ten millions of people so swarms with
inhabitants that the slightest excitement will assemble a multitude in a
few minutes. I noticed, too, in the midst of the mob, a uniformed
policeman. The driver saw him also, and, recovering his courage, cried
out, "Arrest him--arrest him." The policeman seized me by the collar. I
observed that at that instant the beggar whispered something in his ear:
the officer's hand released its hold upon my coat. The next moment the
beggar cried out, "Back! Back! Look out! Dynamite!" The crowd crushed
back on each other in great confusion; and I felt the beggar dragging me
off, repeating his cry of warning--"Dynamite! Dynamite!"--at every step,
until the mob scattered in wild confusion, and I found myself breathless
in a small alley. "Come, come," cried my companion, "there is no time to
lose. Hurry, hurry!" We rushed along, for the manner of the beggar
inspired me with a terror I could not explain, until, after passing
through several back streets and small alleys, with which the beggar
seemed perfectly familiar, we emerged on a large street and soon took a
corner elevator up to one of the railroads in the air which I have
described. After traveling for two or three miles we exchanged to
another train, and from that to still another, threading our way
backward and forward over the top of the great city. At length, as if
the beggar thought we had gone far enough to baffle pursuit, we
descended upon a bustling business street, and paused at a corner; and
the beggar appeared to be looking out for a hack. He permitted a dozen
to pass us, however, carefully inspecting the driver of each. At last he
hailed one, and we took our seats. He gave some whispered directions to
the driver, and we dashed off.

"Throw that out of the window," he said.

I followed the direction of his eyes and saw that I still held in my
hand the gold-mounted whip which I had snatched

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

from the hand of the driver. In my excitement I had altogether forgotten
its existence, but had instinctively held on to it.

"I will send it back to the owner," I said.

"No, no; throw it away: that is enough to convict you of highway
robbery."

I started, and exclaimed:

"Nonsense; highway robbery to whip a blackguard?"

"Yes. You stop the carriage of an aristocrat; you drag a valuable whip
out of the hand of his coachman; and you carry it off. If that is not
highway robbery, what is it? Throw it away."

His manner was imperative. I dropped the whip out of the window and fell
into a brown study. I occasionally stole a glance at my strange
companion, who, with the dress of extreme poverty, and the gray hair of
old age, had such a manner of authority and such an air of promptitude
and decision.

After about a half-hour's ride we stopped at the corner of two streets
in front of a plain but respectable-looking house. It seemed to be in
the older part of the town. My companion paid the driver and dismissed
him, and, opening the door, we entered.

I need not say that I began to think this man was something more than a
beggar. But why this disguise? And who was he?
