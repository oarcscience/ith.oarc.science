### Chapter Eight

#### Pro-Municipal Work

There will be found in every progressive community societies and
organizations which represent a far higher level of public spirit and
enterprise than that possessed or displayed by such communities in their
collective capacity. It is probable that the government of a community
can never reach a higher tone or work on a higher plane than the average
sense of that community demands and enforces; and it will greatly
conduce to the well-being of any society if the efforts of its State or
municipal organizations are inspired and quickened by those of its
members whose ideals of society duty rise higher than the average. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)

And so it may be in Garden City. There will be discovered many
opportunities for public service which neither the community as a whole,
nor even a majority of its members, will at first recognize the
importance of, or see their way to embrace, and which public services it
would be useless, therefore, to expect the municipality to undertake;
but those who have the welfare of society at heart will, in the free air
of the city, be always able to experiment on their own responsibility,
and thus quicken the public conscience and enlarge the public
understanding.

The whole of the experiment which this book describes is indeed of this
character. It represents pioneer work, which will

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span> <span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

be carried out by those who have not a merely pious opinion, but an
effective belief in the economic, sanitary, and social advantages of
common ownership of land, and who, therefore, are not satisfied merely
to advocate that those advantages should be secured on the largest scale
at the national expense, but are impelled to give their views shape and
form as soon as they can see their way to join with a sufficient number
of kindred spirits. And what the whole experiment is to the nation, so
may what we term 'pro-municipal' undertakings be to the community of
Garden City or to society generally. Just as the larger experiment is
designed to lead the nation into a juster and better system of land
tenure and a better and more common-sense view of how towns should be
built, so are the various pro-municipal undertakings of Garden City
devised by those who are prepared to lead the way in enterprises
designed to further the well-being of the town, but who have not as yet
succeeded in getting their plans or schemes adopted by the Central
Council.

Philanthropic and charitable institutions, religious societies, and
educational agencies of various kinds occupy a very large part in this
group of pro-municipal or pro-national agencies, and these have been
already referred to, and their nature and purposes are well known. But
institutions which aim at the more strictly material side of well-being,
such as banks and building societies, may be found here too. Just as the
founders of the Penny Bank paved the way for the Post Office Savings
Bank, so may some of those who study carefully the experiment of
building up Garden City see how useful a bank might be, which, like the
Penny Bank, aims not so much at gain for its founders as at the
well-being of the community at large. Such a bank might arrange to pay
the whole of its net profits or all its profits over a certain fixed
rate, into the municipal exchequer, and give to the authorities of the
town the option of taking it over should they be convinced of its
utility and its general soundness.

There is another large field for pro-municipal activity in the work of
building homes for the people. The municipality would be attempting too
much if it essayed this task, at least at the outset. To do so would be
perhaps to depart too widely from the path which experience has
justified, however much might be

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

said in favour of such a course on the part of a municipal body in
command of ample funds. The municipality has, however, done much to make
the building of bright and beautiful homes for the people possible. It
has effectually provided against any overcrowding within its area, thus
solving a problem found insoluble in existing cities, and it offers
sites of ample size at an average rate of £6 per annum for ground rent
and rates. Having done so much, the municipality will pay heed to the
warning of an experienced municipal reformer, whose desire for the
extension of municipal enterprise cannot be doubted (Mr. John Burns,
M.P., L.C.C.), who has said: 'A lot of work has been thrown upon the
Works Committee of the London County Council by councillors who are so
anxious for its success that they would choke it by a burden of work.'

There are, however, other sources to which the workers may look for
means to build their own homes. They may form building societies or
induce co-operative societies, friendly societies, and trade unions to
lend them the necessary money, and to help them to organize the
requisite machinery. Granted the existence of the true social spirit,
and not its mere letter and name, and that spirit will manifest itself
in an infinite variety of ways. There are in this country—who can doubt
it?—many individuals and societies who would be ready to raise funds and
organize associations for assisting bodies of workmen secure of good
wages to build their own homes on favourable terms.

A better security the lenders could scarcely have, especially having
regard to the ridiculously small landlord's rent paid by the borrowers.
Certain it is that if the building of the homes for these workmen is
left to speculative builders of a strongly pronounced individualistic
type, and these reap golden harvests, it will be the fault, amongst
others, of those large organizations of working men which now place
their capital in banks, whence it is withdrawn by those who with it
'exploit' the very men who have placed it there. It is idle for working
men to complain of this self-imposed exploitation, and to talk of
nationalizing the entire land and capital of this country under an
executive of their own class, until they have first been through an
apprenticeship at the humbler task of organizing men and women with
their own capital in constructive work of a less ambitious character—

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

until they have assisted far more largely than they have yet done in
building up capital, not to be wasted in strikes, or employed by
capitalists in fighting strikers, but in securing homes and employment
for themselves and others on just and honourable terms. The true remedy
for capitalist oppression where it exists, is not the strike of no work,
but the strike of true work, and against this last blow the oppressor
has no weapon. If labour leaders spent half the energy in co-operative
organization that they now waste in co-operative disorganization, the
end of our present unjust system would be at hand. In Garden City such
leaders will have a fair field for the exercise of pro-municipal
functions—functions which are exercised for the municipality, though not
by it—and the formation of building societies of this type would be of
the greatest possible utility.

But would not the amount of capital required for the building of the
dwelling-houses of a town of 30,000 be enormous? Some persons with whom
I have discussed the question look at the matter thus. So many houses in
Garden City at so many hundred of pounds apiece, capital required so
much. <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) This is, of course, quite a
mistaken way of regarding the problem. Let us test the matter thus. How
many houses have been built in London within the last ten years? Shall
we say, at the very roughest of guesses 150,000, costing on an average
£300 apiece—to say nothing of shops, factories, and warehouses. Well,
that is £45,000,000. Was £45,000,000 raised for this purpose? Yes,
certainly, or the houses would not have been built. But the money was
not raised all at once, and if one could recognize the actual sovereigns
that were raised for the building of these 150,000 houses, one would
often find the very same coins turning up again and again. So in Garden
City. Before it is completed, there will be 5,500 houses at, say, £300
apiece, making £1,650,000. But this capital will not be raised all at
once, and here, far more than in London, the very same sovereigns would
be employed in building many houses. For observe, money is not lost or
consumed when it is spent. It merely changes hands. A workman of Garden
City borrows £200 from a pro-municipal building society, and builds a
house with it. That house costs

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

him £200, and the 200 sovereigns disappear so far as he is concerned,
but they become the property of the brickmakers, builders, carpenters,
plumbers, plasterers, etc., who have built his house, whence those
sovereigns would find their way into the pockets of the tradesmen and
others with whom such workmen deal, and thence would pass into the
pro-municipal bank of the town, when presently, those 200 identical
sovereigns might be drawn out and employed in building another house.
Thus there would be presented the apparent anomaly of two, and then
three, and then four or more houses, each costing £200, being built with
200 sovereigns. <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) But there is no real
anomaly about it. The coins, of course, did not build the houses in any
of the supposed cases. The coins were but the measure of value, and like
a pair of scales and weights, may be used over and over again without
any perceptible lessening of their worth. What built the houses was
really labour, skill, enterprise, working up the free gifts of nature;
and though each of the workers might have his reward weighed out to him
in coins, the cost of all buildings and works in Garden City must be
mainly determined by the skill and energy with which its labours are
directed. Still, so long as gold and silver are recognized as the medium
of exchange, it will be necessary to use them, and of great importance
to use them skilfully—for the skill with which they are used, or their
unnecessary use dispensed with, as in a banker's clearing-house, will
have a most important bearing upon the cost of the town, and upon the
annual tax levied in the shape of interest on borrowed capital. Skill
must be therefore directed to the object of so using coins that they may
quickly effect their object of measuring one value, and be set to work
to measure another—that they may be turned over as many times as
possible in the year, in order that the amount of labour measured by
each coin may be as large as possible, and thus the amount represented
by interest on the coins borrowed, though paid at the normal or usual
rate, shall bear as small a proportion as possible to the amount paid to
labour. If this is done effectively, then a saving to the community in
respect of interest as great

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

as the more easily demonstrated saving in landlord's rent may probably
be effected.

And now the reader is asked to observe how admirably, and, as it were,
automatically, a well-organized migratory movement to land held in
common lends itself to the economic use of money, and to the making of
one coin serve many purposes. Money, it is often said, is 'a drug in the
market'. Like labour itself, it seems enchanted, and thus one sees
millions in gold and silver lying idle in banks facing the very streets
where men are wandering workless and penniless. But here, on the site of
Garden City, the cry for employment on the part of those willing to work
will no more be heard in vain. Only yesterday it may have been so, but
to-day the enchanted land is awake, and is loudly calling for its
children. <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) There is no difficulty in
finding

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

work—profitable work—work that is really urgently, imperatively
needed—the building of a home-city, and, as men hasten to build up this
and the other towns which must inevitably follow its construction, the
migration to the towns—the old, crowded, chaotic slum towns of the
past—will be effectually checked, and the current of population set in
precisely the opposite direction—to the new towns, bright and fair,
wholesome and beautiful.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_18"></span>[104:1](gcot10.htm#fr_18.md) 'Only a proportion of
each in one society can have nerve enough to grasp the banner of a new
truth, and endurance enough to bear it along rugged and untrodden ways.
. . . To insist on a whole community being made at once to submit to the
reign of new practices and new ideas which have just begun to commend
themselves to the most advanced speculative intelligence of the
time—this, even if it were a possible process, would do much to make
life impracticable and to hurry on social dissolution. . . . A new
social state can never establish its ideas unless the persons who hold
them confess them openly and give them an honest and effective
adherence.' Mr. John Morley, *On Compromise*, Chap. v.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[108:1](gcot10.htm#fr_19.md) The position was so
stated by Mr. Buckingham in *National Evils and Practical Remedies*, see
Chap. X.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[109:1](gcot10.htm#fr_20.md) A similar line of
argument to this is very fully elaborated in a most able work entitled
*The Physiology of Industry*, by Mummery and Hobson (Macmillan & Co.).

<span id="fn_21"></span>[110:1](gcot10.htm#fr_21.md) Mr. A. J. Balfour,
M.P., on migration into the towns: 'There could be no doubt that when
there was agricultural distress, migration into the towns must increase,
but do not let any Member suppose that if agriculture were as prosperous
now as it was twenty years ago, or as the dreams of the greatest
dreamers of dreams would make it, you could by any possibility stop this
immigration from the country. It depends upon causes and natural laws
which no laws we can pass can permanently modify. The plain fact is,
that in a rural district there is and can be only one investment for
capital, and only one employment for labour. When prosperity in
agriculture increases, immigration into towns diminishes, no doubt: but
however prosperous agriculture may be, a normal point must be reached
when no more capital can be applied to the land, and no more labour can
be applied, and when you have reached that point it does, of necessity,
happen that if marriages occur with the frequency with which they occur
at the present time, and if families are as large as they are at the
present time, there must be an immigration from the country to the town,
from the place where there is only one kind of employment of labour,
strictly limited by the natural capacity of the soil, to another place
where there is no limit whatever to the employment of labour, except the
limit set by the amount of capital seeking investment, and the amount of
labour capable of taking advantage of that capital. If that were an
abstruse doctrine of political economy, I should be afraid to mention it
in this House, where political economy has become a bye-word and
reproach. But it is really a plain statement of a natural law which I
most earnestly advise every man to take to heart.' *Parliamentary
Debates*, 12th December 1893.
