### Chapter Five

#### Further Details of Expenditure on Garden City

'Oh! if those who rule the destinies of nations would but remember
this—if they would but think how hard it is for the very poor to have
engendered in their hearts that love of home from which all domestic
virtues spring, when they live in dense and squalid masses, where social
decency is lost, or rather never found—if they would but turn aside from
the wide thoroughfares and great houses, and strive to improve the
wretched dwellings in bye-ways, where only Poverty may walk,—many low
roofs would point more truly to the sky, than the loftiest steeple that
now rears proudly up from the midst of guilt, and crime, and horrible
disease, to mock them by its contrast. In hollow voices from Workhouse,
Hospital, and Jail, this truth is preached from day to day, and has been
proclaimed for years. It is no light matter—no outcry from the working
vulgar—no mere question of the people's health and comforts that may be
whistled down on Wednesday nights. In love of home, the love of country
has its rise; and who are the truer patriots or the better in time of
need—those who venerate the land, owning its wood, and stream, and
earth, and all that they produce, or those who love their country,
boasting not a foot of ground in all its wide domain?'—CHARLES DICKENS,
*The Old Curiosity Shop* (1841).

To make this chapter interesting to the general reader would be
difficult, perhaps impossible; but if carefully studied, it will, I
think, be found to abundantly establish one of the main propositions of
this book—that the rate-rent of a well-planned town, built on an
agricultural estate, will amply suffice for the creation and maintenance
of such municipal undertakings as are usually provided for out of rates
compulsorily levied.

The net available revenue of Garden City, after payment of interest on
debentures, and providing a sinking fund for the landed estate, has been
already estimated at £50,000 per annum (see Chapter Three, [p.
69](gcot05.htm#page_69)). Having, in the fourth chapter, given special
reasons why a given expenditure in Garden City would be unusually
productive, I will now enter into fuller details, so

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

that any criticism which this book may elicit, having something tangible
to deal with, may be the more valuable in preparing the ground for an
experiment such as is here advocated.

Besides the above expenditure, a considerable outlay would be incurred
in respect of markets, water supply, lighting, tramways, and other
revenue-yielding undertakings. But these items of expenditure are almost
invariably attended with considerable

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

profits, which go in aid of rates. No calculation, therefore, need be
made in respect of these.

I will now deal separately with most of the items in the above estimate.

(*A*) *Roads and Streets*

The first point to be observed under this head is that the cost of
making new streets to meet the growth of population is generally not
borne by the ground landlord nor defrayed out of the rates. It is
usually paid by the building-owner before the local authorities will
consent to take the road over as a free gift. It is obvious, therefore,
that the greater part of the £100,000 *might* be struck out. Experts
will also not forget that the cost of the road sites is elsewhere
provided for. In considering the question of the actual sufficiency of
the estimate, they will also remember that of the boulevards one-half
and of the streets and avenues one-third may be regarded as in the
nature of park, and the cost of laying out and maintenance of these
portions of the roads is dealt with under the head 'Parks'. They will
also note that road-making materials would probably be found near at
hand, and that, the railway relieving the streets of most of the heavy
traffic, the more expensive methods of paving need not be resorted to.
The cost, £4,000 per mile, would, however, be doubtless inadequate if
subways are constructed, as probably they ought to be. The following
consideration, however, has led me not to estimate for these. Subways
are, where useful, a source of economy. The cost of maintaining roads is
lessened, as the continual breaking-up for laying and repairing of
water, gas, and electric mains is avoided, while any waste from leaky
pipes is quickly detected, and thus the subways *pay*. Their cost
should, therefore, be debited rather to cost of water, gas, and electric
supplies, and these services are almost invariably a source of revenue
to the Company or Corporation which constructs them.

(*B*) *Country Roads*

These roads are only forty feet wide, and £1,200 a mile is ample. The
cost of sites has in this case to be defrayed out of estimate.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

(*C*) *Circular Railway and Bridges*

The cost of site is elsewhere provided for (see [p.
67](gcot05.htm#page_67)). The cost of maintenance does not, of course,
include working expenses, locomotives, etc. To cover these a charge
based on cost might be made to traders using the line. It should also be
noticed that, as in the case of roads, by showing that the expense of
this undertaking could be defrayed out of the rate-rent, I am proving
more than I undertook to prove. I am proving that the rate-rent is
sufficient to provide for landlords' rent, for such purposes as are
usually defrayed out of rent, *and also for greatly extending the area
of municipal activity*.

It may here be well to point out that this circle railway not only will
save the trader the expense of carting to and from his warehouse or
factory, but will enable him to claim a rebate from the railway company.
Section 4 of the Railway and Canal Tariff Act, 1894, enacts: 'Whenever
merchandise is received or delivered by a railway company at any siding
or branch railway not belonging to the company, and a dispute arises
between the railway company and the consignor or consignee of such
merchandise, as to any allowance or rebate from the rates charged to
such consignor or consignee, in respect that the railway company does
not provide station accommodation or perform terminal services, the
Railway and Canal Commissioners shall have jurisdiction to hear and
determine what, if any, is a just and reasonable allowance or rebate.'

(*D*) *Schools*

This estimate of £12 per school place represents what was only a few
years ago (1892) the average cost per child of the London School Board
for building, architect, and clerk of the works, and for furniture and
fittings; and no one can doubt that buildings greatly superior to those
in London could be obtained for this sum. The saving in sites has been
already dealt with, but it may be remarked that in London the cost per
child for sites has been £6 11s. 10d.

As showing how ample this estimate is, it may be observed that the cost
of schools which have been proposed to be built by a private company at
Eastbourne, 'with a view of keeping out

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

the School Board', is estimated at £2,500 for 400 places, or but little
more than half the sum per school place provided in the estimate for
Garden City.

The cost of maintenance, £3 per head, is probably sufficient, in view of
the fact that the 'expenditure per scholar in actual average attendance'
in England and Wales, as given in the Report of the Committee of Council
on Education, 1896-7, c. 8545, is £2 11s. 11½d. It must be especially
noticed, too, that the whole cost of education is, in these estimates,
assumed to be borne by Garden City, though a considerable part would be,
in the ordinary course, borne by the National Exchequer. The amount of
income per scholar in actual average attendance in England and Wales, as
given in the same report, is £1 1s. 2d. as against a rate in Garden City
of £3. So that I am again, in the case of the schools, as in the case of
roads and circle railway, proving more than I set out to prove.

(*E*) *Town Hall and Expenses of Management*

It is to be noticed that the estimates of the various undertakings are
intended to cover professional direction and supervision of architects,
engineers, teachers, etc. The £2,000 for maintenance and working
expenses under this head is, therefore, intended to include only the
salaries of town clerk and of officials other than those comprised under
special heads, together with incidental expenses.

(*F*) *Library, and* (*G*) *Museum*

The latter is usually and the former not infrequently elsewhere provided
for out of funds other than rates. So, here again, I am more than
proving my case.

(*H*) *Parks and Road Ornamentation*

This item of cost would not be incurred until the undertaking was in a
thoroughly sound financial condition, and the park space for a
considerable period might be a source of revenue as agricultural land.
Further, much of the park space would probably be left in a state of
nature. Forty acres of this park space is road ornamentation, but the
planting of trees and shrubs would not entail great expense. Again, a
considerable part of

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

the area would be reserved for cricket-fields, lawn-tennis courts, and
other playgrounds, and the clubs using public grounds might perhaps be
called upon to contribute to the expense of keeping these in order, as
is customary elsewhere.

(*I*) *Sewage Disposal*

All that need be said on this subject has been said in Chapter One, [p.
55](gcot03.htm#page_55), and Chapter Two, pp.
[61](gcot04.htm#page_61)-2.

(*K*) *Interest*

The money to construct the public works with which we have been dealing
is supposed to be borrowed at 44 per cent. The question here arises—a
question partly dealt with in Chapter Four—what is the security for
those who lend money on the 'B' debentures?

My answer is threefold.

\(1\) Those who advance money to effect any improvements on land have a
security the safety of which is in reality largely determined by the
effectiveness with which the money so advanced is spent; and, applying
this truism, I venture to say that, for effectiveness of expenditure, no
money which the investing public has been for many years asked to
subscribe for improvements of a like nature has an equal security,
whether it be measured by miles of road, acres of park, or numbers of
school children well provided for.

\(2\) Those who advance money to effect improvements on land have a
security the safety of which is largely determined by the consideration,
aye or no, are other and yet more valuable works to be simultaneously
carried out by others at their own expense, which other works are to
become a security in respect of the first-mentioned advance; and,
applying this second truism, I say that, as the money for effecting the
public improvements here described would only be asked for as and when
other improvements—factories, houses, shops, etc. (costing far more
money than the public works necessary at any given period)—were about to
be built or were in process of building, the quality of the security
would be a very high one.

\(3\) It is difficult to name a better security than that offered when
money is to be expended in converting an agricultural estate into an
urban, and this of the very best known type.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

That the scheme is in reality a 3 per cent security, and would in its
later stages become so, I entertain little doubt; but I do not forget
that, though its points of novelty are the very elements which really
make it secure, they may not make it seem so, and that those who are
merely looking out for an investment may eye it with some distrust
because of its novelty. We shall have in the first instance to look to
those who will advance money with somewhat mixed motives—public spirit,
love of enterprise, and possibly, as to some persons, with a lurking
belief that they will be able to dispose of their debentures at a
premium, as they probably will. Therefore, I put down 4½ per cent, but
if anyone's conscience prick him he may tender at 2 or 2½, or may even
advance money without interest.

(*L*) *Sinking Fund*

This sinking fund, which provides for the extinction of the debt in
thirty years, compares most favourably with that usually provided by
local bodies for works of so permanent a character. The Local Government
Board frequently allows loans to be created with a sinking fund
extending over much longer periods. It is to be remembered also that an
additional sinking fund for the landed estate has been already provided
(see Chapter Four, [p. 70](gcot06.htm#page_70)).

(*M*) *Balance available for Rates levied by Local Bodies within whose
jurisdiction the estate is situated*

It will be seen that the whole scheme of Garden City will make extremely
few demands upon the resources of outside local authorities. Roads,
sewers, schools, parks, libraries, etc., will be provided out of the
funds of the new 'municipality', and in this way the whole scheme will
come to the agriculturists at present on the estate very much like 'a
rate in aid'; for, as rates are only raised for the purpose of public
expenditure, it follows that, there being little or no fresh call upon
the rates while the number of ratepayers is greatly increased, the rate
per head must fall. I do not, however, forget that there are some
functions which such a voluntary organization as Garden City could not
take over, such as the police and the administration of the poor-law. As
to the latter, it is believed that the whole scheme will in the long run
make such rates unnecessary, as Garden City will

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

provide, at all events from the time when the estate has been fully paid
for, pensions for all its needy old citizens. Meantime and from the very
outset it is doing its full share of charitable work. It has allotted
sites of 30 acres for various institutions, and at a later stage will
doubtless be prepared to assume the whole cost of maintaining them.

With regard to police rates, it is not believed that these can be
largely increased by the coming into the town of 30,000 citizens, who,
for the most part, will be of the law-abiding class; for, there being
but one landlord, and this the community, it will not be difficult to
prevent the creation of those surroundings which make the intervention
of the police so frequently necessary. (See Chapter Seven.)

I have, I think, now fully established my contention that the rate-rent
which would be willingly offered by the tenants of Garden City, in
respect of the advantages afforded them, would be amply sufficient: (1)
to pay landlord's rent in the form of interest on debentures; (2) to
provide a sinking fund for the entire abolition of landlord's rent; and
(3) to provide for the municipal needs of the town without recourse to
any Act of Parliament for the enforcement of rates—the community
depending solely on the very large powers it possesses as a landlord.

(*N*) *Revenue-bearing Expenditure*

If the conclusion already arrived at—that the experiment advocated
affords an outlet for an extremely effective expenditure of labour and
capital—is sound in regard to objects the cost of which is usually
defrayed out of rates, that conclusion must, I think, be equally sound
in regard to tramways, lighting, water-supply, and the like, which, when
carried on by municipalities, are usually made a source of revenue, thus
relieving the rate-payer by making his rates lighter. And as I have
added nothing to the proposed revenue for any prospective profits on
such undertakings, I do not propose to make any estimate of expenditure.
