Somewhat similar in structure to Donnelly's [Cæsar's
Column](../cc/index.md), *The Iron Heel* is a novel of a grim 20th Century
future and how it came to be that way. However, London is a much better
novelist than Donnelly, and he is at the top of his form here. There are
three separate narratives in this book: the story of how a brutal
oligarchy seizes power in the United States; a love story centering on
the narrator, the wife of the revolutionary hero; and a running
commentary in the footnotes from the perspective of a post-capitalist
civilization. This is one book where it pays to read the footnotes,
which are set hundreds of years in the future; as well as tying up loose
ends, they have to explain such obsolete concepts as private property,
factory whistles, and prize fighting.

There is the usual expository section where the viewpoint of each social
strata is weighed in turn; London manages keep the interest during this
section. Then there is the obligatory revolutionary action sequence: he
evokes the failed 'Chicago Commune' uprising with style. Real persons
including Upton Sinclair and W.R.Hearst appear in the historical
narrative; these are intertwined with a cast of memorable fictional
characters.

London does not make many technological predictions; (he does, however,
predict an attack on Pearl Harbor--by Germans--as a capitalist ruse to
start a world war!). This is a novel of 'if this goes on...', one of the
best ever, rivaling Orwell's *1984* for literary and historical
significance. It also compares well with latter day science fiction
Utopia/Dystopia stories such as Ursula LeGuins' *The Dispossessed*.
