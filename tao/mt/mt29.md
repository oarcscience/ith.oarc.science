### CHAPTER XXVI.

Lightness has its roots in heaviness. Restlessness has a master in
stillness. Therefore, the Holy Man travels all day without leaving the
baggage wagon. <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105) Surrounded by
sensuous enjoyments he remains peaceful and free.

How, then, can the Lord of ten thousand chariots <span
id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_106) regard his personality as of less
importance than his royal trust? By levity he will loose his ministers;
by restlessness he will loose his throne.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The frail leaves of the woods owe their stability to the mountains in
which the trees are rooted. It is the mighty flood which is the origin
of the fleecy, fleeting clouds in the summer sky. The very conception of
"heaviness" would be impossible without the idea of "lightness." Woe to
that man whose passing moods have no foundation in a weighty soul. He
will be swept as driftwood hither and thither, and never reach port.

All movement starts from rest, and is controlled by the still. It is the
quiet river-bed which directs the course of the impetuous torrent. The
restless wind is scattered by the passive block of masonry. It is the
man whose heart is still who comes to the front as one of the world's
rulers. Restlessness in the citadel of the soul will overthrow the
loftiest prince. Even the Lord Jesus would have become tainted when he
ate with publicans and sinners had he possessed no unchanging point of
rest within. <span id="fr_107"></span>[\*](#fn_107)

"See, O see, the flashing gold  
   From a thousand suns outglancing,  
 See the starry Heavens unrolled,  
   And the skies around me dancing:  
 Yet I feel *a softer splendor*,  
   Flowing o'er my heart, like balm,  
 O how thrilling, and how tender!  
   It is Christ!—Creation's Calm."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_105"></span>[46:1](mt29.htm#fr_105) i.e. He never throws
aside his gravity.

In the eighth chapter of the first book of the Confucian Analects we
read, "Confucius remarked, If the Wise Man is not serious he will not
inspire respect, nor will his learning be solid."

<span id="fn_106"></span>[46:2](mt29.htm#fr_106) The reigning Sovereign.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[46:\*](mt29.htm#fr_107) I am indebted for
these thoughts to Victor von Straus. See his *Laò-Tsè’s Taò Te King*,
*in loc*.
