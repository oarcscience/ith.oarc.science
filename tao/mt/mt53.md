### CHAPTER L.

Birth is an exit; death an entrance. <span
id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160)

Three in ten are ways of life; three in ten are ways of death; three in
ten also of those who live move into the realm of death. <span
id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_161) Why is this? Because of their excessive
strivings after life. <span id="fr_162"></span>[3](#fn_162) It has been
said that he who thoroughly understands how to care for his life will
not need to shun the rhinoceros or the tiger; he need not fear weapons
even in the midst of a battle. The rhinoceros finds no place into which
to thrust its horn; the tiger no place into which to fix its claws; nor
the sword a place into which to flesh its point. Why is this? Because
such an one is not moved by the thought of death. <span

"So dear to heav’n is saintly chastity,  
 That when a soul is found sincerely so,  
 A thousand liveried angels lackey her,  
 Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,  
 And in clear dream, and solemn vision,  
 Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear,  
 Till oft converse with heav’nly habitants  
 Begin to cast a beam on th’ outward shape,  
 The unpolluted temple of the mind,  
 And turns it by degrees to the soul's essence,  
 Till all be made immortal."  
                                 (Milton's *Comus*.)

"When all desires that dwell in the heart cease, then the mortal becomes
immortal, and obtains Brahman." (Upanishads.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_160"></span>[85:1](mt53.htm#fr_160) "We begin our life
surrounded by the Karma of our former existences; as we have acted
during life so we leave it to enter another existence."—*Thos.
Kingsmill*, *in loc*.

A native commentator supplies the following: "When the passions come out
from a man, and he within is calm, he lives: when they enter and so lead
to action, he dies."

<span id="fn_161"></span>[85:2](mt53.htm#fr_161) The text is
enigmatical. Scholars are not agreed as to whether it should read "Three
in ten" or "Thirteen." I have tried to faithfully represent the text,
but see *Secret Doctrine* (vol. i), pp. 401-403.—2 × 6 + 1 = 13; also,
vol. ii, 440.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[85:3](mt53.htm#fr_162) Prof. Legge describes
the first three as "those who eschewed all things, both internal and
external, tending to injure health." The second three as "those who
pursued courses likely to cause disease and shorten life; the third
would be those who thought that by mysterious and abnormal courses they
could prolong life, but only injured it. Those three classes being thus
disposed of, there remains only one in ten rightly using the Tao, and he
is spoken of in the next paragraph."

<span id="fn_163"></span>[85:4](mt53.htm#fr_163) Mencius quotes the
philosopher Tsang as saying "If, on self-examination, I find that I am
not upright, shall I not be in fear even of a poor man in his loose
garments of hair clothe If, on self-examination, I find that I am
upright, I will go forward against thousands and tens of thousands."

Says Chuang-tzu: "The Sage, answered Wang-i, is a spiritual being. If
the ocean were scorched up he would not feel hot. If all the rivers were
frozen hard he would not feel cold."
