### CHAPTER LXV.

From the most ancient times those who have practised the Tao have
depended on the simplicity of the people rather than on their
adroitness.

When the people are difficult to control it is because they possess too
much worldly wisdom.

Who governs by worldly wisdom is a robber in the land; who governs
without it is a blessing to the state.

To know these two axioms is to become a model. To understand how to be a
model is indeed the mystery of energy.

Verily, deep and far-reaching is this mystery of energy. It is the
opposite of all that is visible, but it leads to universal concord.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The Christ-man seeks nothing for himself; the world-man ever cries
"mine," rather than "my neighbor." The former is simple, the latter
adroit. Wise indeed is that man who understands the "Mystery of Energy,"
the power of action which is desireless. Action which is desireless
divert; no portion of its force toward bringing fruit to its author,
hence, in the language of Paul, it is the foolish things and the weak
things which confound the wise and the mighty. (*Vid*. I. *Cor*. *i*,
27, 28.) Because men fail to comprehend this, their best efforts, like
Nebuchadnezzar's image, are part iron and part clay. No politician has
yet risen to these sublime heights, no state has yet proven superior to
the glamor of "worldly wisdom"; therefore, while seeking to cure the
ills they know, they create fresh evils, the end of which they do not
see. *Who governs by worldly wisdom is a robber in the land*.
