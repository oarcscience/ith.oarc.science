### CHAPTER XLVII.

The world may be known without going out of doors.

The heavenly way (Tao) may be seen without looking through the
window. <span id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_152.md)

The further one goes the less one knows.

Hence the Holy Man arrives without traveling; <span
id="fr_153"></span>[2](#fn_153.md) names without looking; accomplishes
without action. <span id="fr_154"></span>[3](#fn_154.md)

The knowledge of the Sage is intuitive. He requires only to concentrate
his attention on a subject to understand it. All men have intuitions,
certain facts of which they are convinced without having reasoned on
them, but most are guided by impulse, their motives arise in that which
is without, instead of from what is within. The man who is dependent on
reason, like the blind man who relies on touch, is liable to deception.
*The further he goes the less he knows*. The *Heavenly Way* is only
perceptible to the inner eye. "If therefore thine eye be single, thy
whole body shall be full of light." *Hence the Sage arrives without
traveling*. So also the "Upanishads." "Though sitting still, he walks
far; though lying down he goes everywhere." Says Alipili: "If

that which thou seekest thou findest not within thee thou wilt never
find it without thee."

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

"Truth is within ourselves; it takes no rise  
 From outward things, whate’er you may believe."

</div>

By concentration on this inner universe, by meditation on the Higher
Self, by unselfish obedience to the holy vision, *the world may be known
without going out of doors*. The unselfish, who are devoid of
self-seeking, who subordinate the finite to the Universal Will, may
follow this Divinity within wherever it leads. "If ye abide in my word,
then are ye truly my disciples; and ye shall know the truth, and the
truth shall make you free." The pure in heart, or the single-minded,
"see God."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_152"></span>[80:1](mt50.htm#fr_152.md) Su-cheh writes,
''Spirit is universal, knowing nothing of either near or far, ancient or
modern. It is thus that the Sage knows everything without going from the
door, or looking through the window. Men of the present day are limited
by matter, the spirit within them is limited by ears and eyes, thus they
are thrown into confusion by desires and by their bodies; thus mountains
and rivers become barriers; they know nothing excepting what their eyes
see, or their ears hear, and in this way even such trifles as doors and
windows obstruct them. Are you not aware that the Sage having recovered
his original nature is satisfied? Why desire to go abroad to search? The
farther you go the less you will know." See "The Voice of the Silence,"
p. 13 (note).

Wang-pi says: "All things have one ancestry; all roads meet at one
point; all thought leads to the same conclusion; all religions point to
the same goal."

<span id="fn_153"></span>[80:2](mt50.htm#fr_153.md) i.e. he knows
intuitively and does not require to go over each point step by step.

Rom. x, 6-8.
