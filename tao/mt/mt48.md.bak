### CHAPTER XLV.

The greatest attainment is as though incomplete; but its utility remains
unimpaired.

The greatest fulness is as a void; but its utility is inexhaustible.

The greatest uprightness is as crookedness; the greatest cleverness as
clumsiness; the greatest eloquence as reticence.

Motion overcomes cold; stillness conquers heat.

Purity and stillness are the world's standards. <span

Read Paul's description of the work of the great Master of humility—the
Lord Jesus. "Who, being in the form of God, counted it not a prize to be
on an equality with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
servant, being made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion
as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea,

"Nature," says Emerson, "will not have us fret and fume. She does not
like our benevolence, our learning, much better than she likes our
frauds and wars. When we come out of the caucus, or the bank, or the
Abolition convention or the Temperance meeting, or the Transcendental
Club into the fields and woods, she says to us, 'So hot? my little
sir.'" *Purity and stillness are the world's standards*.

fine perception of the greatness inseparable from goodness,
remarks—"Heaven and earth yield to the man who is pure and still."

"Purity and stillness" are according to Wu-ch’eng attributes of
non-action (or non-attachment).
