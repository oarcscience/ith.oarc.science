### CHAPTER LXII.

The Tao has of all things the most honored place. <span
id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198.md)

It is the good man's treasure, and that which protects the bad man.

Its excellent words may be displayed before all. Its noble deeds assist
all men.

Why should a man be cast aside because he is bad? <span
id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_199.md)

Hence when the sovereign has been enthroned, and the chief ministers
have been appointed, though one escorted by a team of horses, present
the jade symbol of office, it would not equal the stilling of the heart,
and entering this Tao.

What is the reason that this Tao has been held in such esteem from the
beginning? May we not say that it is because those who seek receive, and
those who are guilty escape by its (help)? <span
id="fr_200"></span>[3](#fn_200.md) Hence it becomes the most valued thing
under heaven. <span id="fr_201"></span>[4](#fn_201.md)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The noumenal is the real, the phenomenal, the reflection, and the wise
man seeks the former rather than the latter. Earth's fairest pageantries
are insignificant compared with That—her costliest gifts as dust
compared with That. Only as man harmonizes with That can he escape the
Nemesis of guilt, a harmony which is possible because God and man are
identical, differing only as the infinite differs from the finite; the
impure or differentiated from the pure or undifferentiated. Jesus is at
once a door through which God enters the generations of sin, and through
which sinners pass into the realms of the eternal.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_198"></span>[104:1](mt65.htm#fr_198.md) This is the rendering
of Dr. James Legge.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[104:2](mt65.htm#fr_199.md) "To merely regard the
external appearance of things is like standing outside the hall door,
the TAO is within, and That is the most honorable. Men fail to perceive
that all things possess It. However, the man of virtue knows that the
Tao is his, and hence it is said to be the good man's treasure.' But the
foolish and ignorant man also possesses the Tao, otherwise he would not
be able to endure. Hence it is said to be the bad man's guardian.'
Though men wander far from the Tao, the Tao never departs far from
men."—Su-cheh.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[104:3](mt65.htm#fr_200.md) This is the only place
in the Tao-teh-king where the idea of guilt occurs. The notion is
Buddhistic, rather than Taoistic or Confucian.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[104:4](mt65.htm#fr_201.md) "Men, alas, will not
seek for the root of truth. It is within themselves. If they sought it
they would find it. The Tao has neither merit nor demerit, but men
unfortunately do not understand this. If they did they would escape the
defilement of sin."—*Su-cheh*.

"The Tao (path) may not be left for an instant. If it could be left it
would not be the Tao (path)."—*The Doctrine of the Mean*.
