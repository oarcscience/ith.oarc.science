### CHAPTER LXXVIII.

Nothing is so flexible as water, yet for attacking that which is hard
nothing surpasses it. There is nothing which supplants it.

The weak overcome the strong, the soft control the hard. Every one knows
this, but no one practises it. <span id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_254)

Hence a Sage has said—'Who bears his country's reproach is hailed as the
lord of his nation's altars. Who bears his country's misfortunes is
called the Empire's chief.'

Truth, when expressed in speech, appears paradoxical. <span

Said St. Paul: "When I am weak then am I strong." "For we also are weak
with him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you."

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

"Measure thy love by loss instead of gain;  
 Not by the wine drunk, but by the wine poured forth,  
 For love's strength standeth in love's sacrifice,  
 And whoso suffers most hath most to give."

"The Tongue is an instrument yielding and pliant  
 Yet safe in the mouth it ever remains,  
 While the teeth are inflexible, hard and defiant,  
 And frequently broken to pay for their pains."—*Chinese Ode*, quoted by
Arthur Smith in his *Chinese Proverbs*.
