### CHAPTER XLVIII.

The pursuit of study brings daily increase; the pursuit of Tao daily
decrease; decrease upon decrease, until non-action is reached, whence
all action proceeds. <span id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155)

Only continued non-concern will win the Empire; where there is concern
there is an insufficiency for the task.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

As mere outwardness retreats the true inwardness is discerned. Beware
lest intellectual evolution become spiritual devolution. God has chosen
"the things that are not, that He might bring to naught the things that
are." *Study brings daily increase, the Tao daily decrease, until
non-action is reached*. The force with which men of violence seize the
Kingdom of God is not the self-assertion of the passions, but that
mystic force which does violence to the lower nature, plucks out the
right eye, or cuts off the right foot. This philosophy is not concerned
lest it suffer wrong, or be defrauded of right, knowing that *only
continued non-concern will win the Empire*.

"Surely," says Thomas à Kempis, "an humble husbandman that serveth God
is better than a proud philosopher who, neglecting himself, is occupied
in studying the course of the heavens."
