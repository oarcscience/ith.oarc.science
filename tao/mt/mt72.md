### CHAPTER LXIX.

Military commanders have a saying <span id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_228)—

I dare not act as host but only as a guest; <span
id="fr_229"></span>[2](#fn_229) rather than advance an inch I would
retire a foot. <span id="fr_230"></span>[3](#fn_230)

This is marching without moving; bearing the invisible arm; regarding
the enemy as if he were not; grasping the sword that is not. <span
id="fr_231"></span>[4](#fn_231)

There is no calamity greater than making light of the enemy; <span
id="fr_232"></span>[5](#fn_232) to make light of the enemy is to
endanger my retention of the treasures. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[6](#fn_233) Hence once the opposing forces have met
it is the pitiful who conquer. <span id="fr_234"></span>[7](#fn_234)

"Jesus, therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him
by force, to make him a king, withdrew again into the mountain himself
alone," and was thereby endowed

with a more powerful scepter than if he had accepted a visible crown.
Refusing to play the part of a host or master, he gained the kingdom and
became its lord.

Missionaries, and all who disturb the natural development of national
moral culture, tearing down and destroying where they should only build
and conserve, are acting as hosts in lands where they are uninvited
guests. The chapter is a warning that it is only those who feel the pity
of physical and moral *FORCE;* who understand the *DANGER* that is
inseparable from all attempts to present truth to the hostile, who
ultimately win in the contest.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_228"></span>[116:1](mt72.htm#fr_228) The text does not say,
as nearly every translator has made it say, "A certain commander said so
and so," but "The general policy of all great generals is thus and
thus."

<span id="fn_229"></span>[116:2](mt72.htm#fr_229) i.e. I do not dare to
act on my own initiative; before committing myself I wait to discover
the intentions of the enemy. The "enemy" is in the text spoken of as the
"host."

<span id="fn_230"></span>[116:3](mt72.htm#fr_230) The idea is that the
holder of the Tao should always be more ready to yield than to give
battle.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[116:4](mt72.htm#fr_231) Although inert he is
ever on the alert, and ready for every emergency. Cf. I *Pet*. v. 8.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[116:5](mt72.htm#fr_232) A warning against
allowing active passivity becoming careless indifference. Cf. *Eph*. vi.
13-18.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[116:6](mt72.htm#fr_233) vid. chap.
[67](mt70.htm#an_ch_67). A determination to destroy the enemy regardless
of the necessity for the act is contrary to compassion; it reveals an
absence of self-restraint.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[116:7](mt72.htm#fr_234) Angry passions and
impatient desires to join the battle are naturally aroused when the
opposing forces are lying face to face, but here, as always, it is those
who feel the pity of it all, but who are yet prepared for every
eventuality, who win the day; their very sorrow that a battle is
unavoidable, prevents them being hurried by the impetuosity of passion
into some foolish and fatal move.

There is a story told of Admiral Dewey which aptly illustrates the
military spirit which Lao-tzu is commending. The American ships were
making magnificent target practice in Manilla Bay, and the Spanish fleet
was sinking. The Americans began to cheer. "Don't shout, boys," said
Dewey. "The poor devils are dying."
