### CHAPTER LVIII.

When the government is not in evidence <span
id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_191.md) the people are honest and loyal.

When the government is meddlesome the people are in want.

Misery!—Happiness lies by its side! <span
id="fr_192"></span>[2](#fn_192.md) Happiness!—Misery lurks beneath. He who
understands the end has progressed beyond limitations.

The regular becomes the irregular; the good becomes unpropitious. This
has bewildered men from time immemorial!

Hence the Holy Man is a square which has not been cut, and whose corners
have not been planed; <span id="fr_193"></span>[3](#fn_193.md) he is
straightforward without being reckless, and bright without being
dazzling.

The chapter proceeds from the outer to the inner, from that which is
objective and manifest to that which is subjective and not so manifest.
The evils of a meddlesome government are plain, they arise from too much
emphasis being placed on externals rather than on principles. Less
manifest to the "man on the street" is the trouble which arises from
confusing happiness and misery, which are not separate

but the reverse sides of the same shield. Jesus referred all his
experiences, the success which attended his preaching, and the sorrow in
which sin involved him, equally to the Father's will. Hence the "Prince
of this World" found nothing in him.

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

"Omnes! Omnes! Let others ignore what they may,  
I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also,  
I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is—And I say there
is in fact no evil  
(Or if there is, I say it is just as important, to the land or to me as
anything else)."

</div>

Thus the poet Walt Whitman, in his "Starting from Paumanok," confirms,
in his own fashion, the teaching of our pre-Christian Chinese mystic.
Robert Browning also sings the same theme in one of his later poems

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

"Ask him—'Suppose the Gardener of Man's ground  
   Plants for a purpose, side by side with good,  
 Evil—(and that he does so—look around!  
   What does the field show?)—were it understood  
 That purposely the noxious plant was found  
   Vexing the virtuous, poison close to food.  
 If, at first stealing forth of life in stalk  
 And leaflet promise, quick his spud should balk  
 Evil from budding foliage, bearing fruit?  
 Such timely treatment of the offending root  
 Might strike the simple as wise husbandry,  
 But swift sure extirpation would scarce suit  
 Shrewder observers. Seed once sown thrives: why  
 Frustrate its product, miss the quality  
 Which sower binds himself to count upon?  
 Had seed fulfilled the destined purpose, gone  
 Unhindered up to harvest—what know I  
 But proof were gained that every growth of good  
 Sprang consequent on evil's neighborhood?'"

<span id="fn_191"></span>[98:1](mt61.htm#fr_191.md) Like the sun behind the
clouds, felt but not seen.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[98:2](mt61.htm#fr_192.md) "Calamitas virtutis
occasion." (Calamity is virtue's opportunity).—*Seneca*.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[98:3](mt61.htm#fr_193.md) The Sage is
four-square, perfect, not because he has become adjusted to the
limitations of time and space, but because he has risen above these and
is one with the Invisible.

"The peace which comes of surrendering all likes and dislikes is
possible only when the Triangle becoming Quaternary is inscribed in the
Circle, when the Perfect Man—unifying his consciousness by indrawing the
purified personality—so expands as to step beyond the limitations of the
causal body and embrace the Logos—when the Divine Man, now a perfect
square, recognizes Himself as a mode of expression of the Divine Life, a
form of the Divine Consciousness, an organ of *Iswara* and an image and
reflection of the true Self."—*Studies in the Bhagavad Gita*, by The
Dreamer. (*The Yoga of Discrimination*) p. 110.
