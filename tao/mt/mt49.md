### CHAPTER XLVI.

When the Empire is controlled by the Tao, riding horses are employed in
agriculture; when the Empire is without Tao, war horses are in every
open space. <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151.md)

There is no sin greater than covetousness; no calamity greater than
discontent; no fault greater than acquisitiveness.

Who therefore knows the contentment of content possesses unchanging
content.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

"Everywhere THAT has hands and feet, everywhere eyes, head, mouths;
all-hearing, He dwelleth in the world, enveloping all," sang the ancient
Indian poet. "The eyes of all wait upon Thee; and thou givest them their
meat in due season," chanted the Hebrew Psalmist. Yet the world is
devastated continually, and plunged into the miseries of war by man's
covetousness. What would become of the race if the ALL-FATHER, like his
children, were acquisitive—moved by desires for the personal self? How
is the Empire to be freed from that which is NOT-TAO—covetousness—and
brought under the control of THE TAO so that all shall enjoy the
"unchanging content?" Chu-hsi, the great Confucian commentator, shall
supply the answer—

"Heaven and man are not properly two, and man is separate from heaven
only by having this body. Of their seeing and hearing, their thinking
and revolving, their moving and acting, men all say—*It is from* ME.
Every one thus brings out his SELF, and his smallness becomes known. But
let the body be taken away, and all would be heaven. How can the body be
taken away? Simply by subduing and removing that self-having of the
*ego*. This is the taking it away."

<span id="fn_151"></span>[79:1](mt49.htm#fr_151.md) "In the former case
says Han Fei Tzu, there will be no work for soldiers. In the latter,
lice will swarm in the armour, and swallows build their nests in the
tents—of soldiers who return no more.'"—*Remains of Lao Tzu*.
