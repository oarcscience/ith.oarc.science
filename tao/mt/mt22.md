### CHAPTER XIX.

Abandon knowledge, discard wisdom—the people will gain a hundred fold.

Abandon the humanities, discard righteousness—the people will return to
filial love.

Abandon cleverness, discard gain—robbers and thieves will be no
more. <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72)

These three, <span id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_73) being considered not
sufficiently aesthetic, therefore many other devices <span
id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_74) were added. Better observe
simplicity, <span id="fr_75"></span>[4](#fn_75) encourage primitiveness,
lessen the number of private projects, and moderate desire. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[5](#fn_76)

is essential to progression. However good the ritual, it should be cast
aside once the life has outgrown the form. In passing from infancy to
old age, mankind proceeds from multiplicity to simplicity, from activity
to quiescence, and this natural physical law is also the path for the
soul. The desires fade, or are perhaps absorbed, as the orb of Truth
rises.

"The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God," says Paul.

"Except ye fast to the world, ye shall in no wise find the kingdom of
God," is one of the forgotten sayings of the Christ.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_72"></span>[34:1](mt22.htm#fr_72) Virtues which are exotics
and not habitats are dangerous freaks, diverting the mind from inner
realities. The teaching is eloquently set forth by J. B. of "The
Christian World." "What a remove," … he writes, "from the thing we call
'cleverness,' the element which made Jesus supreme in the hearts of his
followers! Was it by 'cleverness' that, in Ullmann's striking words,
'His mere presence passed a silent but irresistible sentence upon those
by whom he was surrounded,' Was it a mere trick of the intellect that
his look could break a strong man's hearts In this highest example we
have demonstration of the fact that the crowning endowment of humanity
is beyond and behind intellect, using that only as a tool. … We are in
an age of culture and of general knowledge grinding. More than ever
necessary is that for every teacher, but it is only a beginning. Our
qualification for any grade of spiritual office is in the incessant
cultivation of our central innermost. It is when we find our Higher
Self, our greater Ego, the infinite Ground of our being, to be more and
more filling us and making our life, that we can speak of progress."

<span id="fn_73"></span>[34:2](mt22.htm#fr_73) viz.: The three
duplicates, knowledge, wisdom; benevolence, righteousness; cleverness,
gain. Standing alone they are painted fruits which arouse expectations
but fail to satisfy hunger. Cf. Matt. xxi. 17-19.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[34:3](mt22.htm#fr_74) Once let the outer usurp
the inner, and, like uncontrolled competition in business, it will end
in bankruptcy.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[34:4](mt22.htm#fr_75) Tsaio-ju-ho observes that
primitive simplicity embraces the very essence of knowledge, wisdom,
benevolence and righteousness.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[34:5](mt22.htm#fr_76) The way of the Christ, as
of all great religious leaders, is to discourage monopoly and practice
spiritual socialism.
