### CHAPTER LXXIV.

Why use death as a deterrent, when the people have no fear of death?

Even supposing they shrank from death as from a monster, and by playing
on their terror I could slay them, should I dare? <span

There is one who inflicts sentence of death. To usurp his functions and
to kill would be to assume the role of the Master-Carpenter. There are
few who can act as master-carpenter without cutting their hands. <span

Dr. Hartmann, of Leipzig, comments as follows on this chapter in the
Lotusblüthen: "The death penalty as a deterrent measure is a legacy from
an ignorant generation. That which incites men to action cannot be
killed. The evil inclination toward crime when driven from the body by
execution is only thereby made still more generally harmful, because it
again influences others, and leads them to perform similar deeds to
those for which the execution took place. Moreover, through suffering
the wrong of execution desires for retaliation are aroused in the soul
of the executed, and in this way he is made more dangerous than before.
What is the use of destroying the tool, while the ringleader is beyond
reach? It will be easy for him to find another instrument. What is the
use of banishing the evil from the house, when it can readily find
another dwelling? Better

endeavor to reform the criminal, by bringing him to a better conception
of things, and in this way transform the evil into a good spirit."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_245"></span>[122:1](mt77.htm#fr_245.md) Mr. Thos. Kingsmill's
translation is illuminative—"With folk who have no fear of death, what
object is there in making its apprehension a deterrent? How should we
dare to apprehend and to execute people who dread death as the greatest
terror?"

<span id="fn_246"></span>[122:2](mt77.htm#fr_246.md) Cf. chap.
[30](mt33.htm#an_ch_30.md).

Cf. a saying by Confucius; he is expounding the fundamental principle of
all Chinese law, the veneration of the inferior for the superior, an
idea which bas strong affinities with the philosophy of the ancient
Greeks. "Why when governing, depend on capital punishment? Seek
righteousness and the people will be righteous. The relation between the
rulers and the ruled is like that between the wind and the grass. The
grass must bend when the wind blows across it." *Confucian Analects*,
xii, 19.
