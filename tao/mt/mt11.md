### CHAPTER VIII.

The highest goodness resembles water. Water greatly benefits all things,
but does not assert itself.

He approximates to the Tao, who abides by that which men despise.

He revolutionizes the place in which he dwells; his depth is
immeasurable; he strengthens moral qualities by what he bestows; he
augments sincerity by what he says; he evokes peace by his
administration; his transactions manifest ability; he is opportune in
all his movements.

Forasmuch as he does not assert himself he is free from blame. <span

Water adapts itself to every mold and flows into any vessel, making no
difference between the clean and the foul, the fine and the coarse. In
the words of Ruskin. "Of all inorganic substances, acting in their own
proper nature, and without assistance or combination, water is the most
wonderful." Hence it is the fittest type of the highest goodness, which
by its self-abandon and eagerness to serve, has always been the
[world’s](errata.htm#3.md) chief puzzle. "Then said I, lo! I am come: in
the roll of the Book it is written of Me, I delight to do Thy Will, O my
God; yea, Thy law is within my heart." (Ps. xl, 7.) It is

the universal solvent of man's ills. "Whosoever drinketh of the water
that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall
give him shall become in him a well of water springing up into eternal
life." (John. iv, 14.) The most wretched and the most outcast may here
find satisfaction for their needs. "And both the Pharisees and the
Scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with
them." (Luke xv, 2.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_23"></span>[14:1](mt11.htm#fr_23.md) There is a correspondence
between early Chinese thought and the beginning of Greek philosophy.
Thales, born only some thirty odd years before Lao-tzu, and who, like
him, was a seeker after Wisdom, is said to have "maintained water to be
the ground of all things," but while Thales appears to have confined his
philosophy to the conclusions that as it is water or moisture which
keeps the world alive, so there is in man and in all things a living
power which prevents them becoming mere heaps of dead atoms. Lao-tzu
goes further and draws from the non-assertion of water the inference
that the highest goodness, that which alone can transform the world,
must, like water, be born of that Power which is the child of Purity—the
purity of selflessness.

Lao-tzu's teaching is expanded with great force and beauty in a later
Taoist treatise—"History of the Great Light." (v. *Taoist Texts*, by
Balfour, pp. 84-85.)
