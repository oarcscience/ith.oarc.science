### CHAPTER XXII.

To be crooked is to be perfected; to be bent is to be straightened; to
be lowly <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md) is to be filled; to be
senile is to be renewed; to be diminished is to be able to receive; to
be increased is to be deluded. <span id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_90.md)

Therefore the Holy Man embraces unity, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_91.md) and becomes the world's model. <span
id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_92.md)

He is not self-regarding, therefore he is cognizant. <span
id="fr_93"></span>[5](#fn_93.md)

He is not egotistic, therefore he is distinguished.

He is not boastful, therefore he has merit. He is not conceited,
therefore he is superior. Inasmuch as he strives with none, there are
none in the world able to strive with him. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[6](#fn_94.md)

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

That ancient maxim—'To be crooked is to become perfected'—was it an idle
word? Verily, it includes the whole. <span id="fr_95"></span>[7](#fn_95.md)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

"Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain shall be made low;
and the crooked shall be made a straight place, and the rough places
plain." "Everyone that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that
humbleth himself shall be exalted." These familiar Bible Texts voice the
teaching of Religion in all ages, whether she appear in the garb of the
Brahman, the Buddhist, the Jew, or the Christian.

Those who have done most for their fellows have been those who have
walked most humbly before their Maker. Selflessness has been their chief
characteristic. A child is egotistic. A <span
class="smallcaps">MAN</span> is unconscious. Abraham, regarded by the
Jew, the Mohammedan and the Christian, as a saint, bowed in continual
humility before Jehovah—ordering his life according to the directions of
the Invisible. Sakyamuni left a palace to wear the beggar's robe.
Socrates followed the guidance of his daemon. It is to the humility of
Confucius that the Chinese point with the most satisfaction. Jesus came
not to be ministered unto but to minister, according to his own saying,
"Whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? Is not
he that sitteth at meat? I am in the midst of you as he that serveth."
*To be lowly is to be filled*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_89"></span>[40:1](mt25.htm#fr_89.md) The word rendered here
"lowly" means—The footsteps of an ox in which water collects; a hollow;
a puddle; a swamp.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[40:2](mt25.htm#fr_90.md) "Self-sufficiency invites
damage; humility receives benefits."—*Shu-kung*.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[40:3](mt25.htm#fr_91.md) Lit.—"The One," which
Wang-pi explains as "diminished to the uttermost." In *Esoteric
Buddhism* we read that the "supreme controlling cause" "is the same for
one man as for every man, the same for humanity as for the animal
kingdom, the same for the physical as for the astral or devachanic
planes of existence."—8th ed. Amer., p. 307.

"The more a man is one within himself and becometh of single heart, so
much the more and higher things doth he understand without labor; for
that he receiveth the light of wisdom from above."—*Of the Imitation of
Christ*.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[40:4](mt25.htm#fr_92.md) Having yielded himself to
the Tao, as Paul to the cross, "the law in his members." (*Rom*. vii.
23), or the passion elements of his nature, obey the "law in his mind;"
hence he is the "world's model."

<span id="fn_93"></span>[40:5](mt25.htm#fr_93.md) "The eye does not look at
itself, therefore it sees everything; the mirror never reflects itself,
thus it is able to reflect images. What time has any who is ever
attending to himself to give to anything else?"—*Su-cheh*.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[40:6](mt25.htm#fr_94.md) See ch.
[66](mt69.htm#an_ch_66.md).

"The unassuming are honorable and illustrious; the humble cannot be
surpassed."—*Yi-king*. (The Book of Changes.)

<span id="fn_95"></span>[41:7](mt25.htm#fr_95.md) Perfection is impossible
without a recognition of THE LAW that every cause produces its own
effects, and that no effects occur without adequate cause. To this
majestic and immutable law Nature offers unceasing sacrifice. It is
Nature's implicit submission to a Will higher than herself that secures
the accuracy of scientific investigation. In like manner individual
perfection is attainable only as there is absolute obedience to Nature's
instructions on all planes. Hence the assertion of the text that *to be
crooked*, or to be willing to bow the neck to the yoke imposed by the
might of superior Wisdom, *includes the whole*. Cp. *Isa*. i, 16.20.
