### CHAPTER XL.

The movements of the Tao are cyclical; the sufficiency of the Tao is
latency. <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_137.md)

All that is, <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_138.md) exists in being
(bhava), being in non-being. <span id="fr_139"></span>[3](#fn_139.md)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

"So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;
and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up
and grow, he knoweth not how. The earth yieldeth fruit of herself; first
the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear." "The kingdom of
heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed
in his field: which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown,
it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of
the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof." "The kingdom of
heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three
measures of meal, till it was all leavened."
