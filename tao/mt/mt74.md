### CHAPTER LXXI.

The highest attainment is to know non-knowledge. <span
id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_239) To regard ignorance as knowledge is a
disease. Only by feeling the pain of this disease do we cease to be
diseased. The perfected man, because he knows the pain of it, is free
from this disease. It is for this reason that he does not have it. <span

He who wills to do the Will, must know THAT which is beyond knowledge;
he must ascend into the regions of the supersensuous. Listen to a few of
the simpler sayings of the Master. "Resist not evil"; "Lay not up for
yourselves treasures on earth"; "Take no thought … what ye shall eat or

land us in the region where intellectual machinery is worth little more
than old iron. Nevertheless, as Lao-tzu says, ignorance of this
indicates disease, for Truth, whether a philosophy or a life, is

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

"The Somewhat which we name, but cannot know,  
 Ev’n as we name a star, and only see  
 His quenchless flashings forth, which ever show  
 And ever hide him, and which are not he."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_239"></span>[119:1](mt74.htm#fr_239) "Non-knowledge in the
sense of absolute knowledge. Everything that is absolute appears to us
as nothing because all we know we know relatively."

<span id="fn_240"></span>[119:2](mt74.htm#fr_240) "To know what it is
that you know, and to know what it is that you do not know—that is
understanding."—*Confucian Analects* ii, 17.

"If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he
ought to know,"—*Paul*. (I *Cor*. viii, 2.)
