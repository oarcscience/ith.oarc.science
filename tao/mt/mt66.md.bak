### CHAPTER LXIII.

Practice non-action. <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_202.md) Be concerned
with non-concern. <span id="fr_203"></span>[2](#fn_203.md) Taste the
flavorless. Account the small as great, and the few as many. <span
id="fr_204"></span>[3](#fn_204.md) For hatred return perfection. <span
id="fr_205"></span>[4](#fn_205.md)

Manipulate difficulties while they are easy. Take in hand great things
while they are insignificant. Every difficult thing in the world had its
origin in what was at first easy. Every great thing in the world was
once insignificant. Therefore the Holy Man makes no distinctions and
thus he is able to accomplish that which is great. <span
id="fr_206"></span>[5](#fn_206.md)

Small faith can be placed in promises lightly made. <span
id="fr_207"></span>[6](#fn_207.md)

The easier a matter is reckoned the more difficult it proves at the
last; <span id="fr_208"></span>[7](#fn_208.md) for this reason the

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Holy Man sees
difficulties in everything, and therefore he encounters no difficulties.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The man who has tasted the flavor of the flavorless, in which all
flavors are concealed, is detached and free; he regards everything as
alike great and alike small; as equally difficult and equally easy;
neither careless nor indifferent; undertaking the most difficult tasks
with ease, yet not overlooking the difficulties involved in the easiest
affairs, he completes the greatest without difficulty. Living in the
eternal, he neither cleaves to this, nor swerves from that.

This is the ideal life!

"What you do not wish others to do unto you, do not do unto them," said
Confucius. Of Buddha it is recorded that he said, "A man who foolishly
does me wrong I will return to him the protection of my ungrudging love;
the more evil comes from him, the more good shall go from me." "He who
beareth no ill-will to any being, friendly and compassionate, without
attachment and egoism, balanced in pleasure and pain, and forgiving,
ever content, harmonious, with the self controlled, resolute, with Manas
and Buddhi dedicated to Me, he, My devotee, is dear to Me," was one of
Krishna's instructions to Arjuna. In an earlier section Lao-tzu wrote "I
would return good for good. I would also return good for evil." In a
similar spirit Jesus said to His disciples "Resist not him that is evil;
but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, return to him the other
also. Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you."

The same commands confront us, no matter to what religious Teacher we
turn. By each we are told to rise above the love which is personal,
whose shadow is hate, to the love which is universal, in which there is
no room for hate; then we are bid rise still higher to the Love which is
impersonal, which, because it identifies itself with All, is a segment
of the circle which unites the divinity of man with the humanity of God,
which sees greatness in the smallest and knows no distinctions. It
promises nothing without a full sense of its responsibility. It is
prepared for every difficulty, therefore It is able to meet hatred and
misrepresentation with PERFECTION.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[106:1](mt66.htm#fr_202.md) *vide* Manual iv, p.
65 *et seq*.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[106:2](mt66.htm#fr_203.md) cf. I *Pet*. v, 7.
*Matt*. vi, 25-34.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[106:3](mt66.htm#fr_204.md) Because there is
"nothing either great or small."

<span id="fn_205"></span>[106:4](mt66.htm#fr_205.md) "For hatred return
perfection," i.e. avoid any emotion which will create in fellow-beings
"any of the emotions on the side of hate and vice." Be "as gold that
melts and becomes the purer the more it is exposed to the fire."
"Perfection" is another rendering of the Chinese character elsewhere
translated "energy." It includes all the attributes of the Tao.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[106:5](mt66.htm#fr_206.md) He recognizes no
distinctions such as important and unimportant. The text might be
rendered "Therefore the Holy Man does not attempt great things, and on
that account he is able to accomplish the greatest."

<span id="fn_207"></span>[106:6](mt66.htm#fr_207.md) "The Master said 'He
who speaks without modesty will find it difficult to make his words
good.'"—*Confucian Analects*, xiv, 21.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[106:7](mt66.htm#fr_208.md) The Empress Dowager of
China, who has for so many years ruled China, in the teeth of almost
insuperable difficulties, affords a good illustration of the truth of
this chapter. Ku-hung-ming, a bright, well educated Chinaman, who took
his M.A. in Edinburgh, thus describes the Empress on p. 13 of his
"Papers From a Viceroy's Yamen."—She is "neither anti-foreign nor
pro-foreign, neither reactionary nor progressive." This evenly balanced
mentality enabled her to hold her own amid the conflicting interests and
intrigues of the Pekingese Court.
