### CHAPTER XXXVII.

The Tao—eternally actionless and the cause of all action!

Were princes and monarchs able to acquiesce the myriad existences would
by degrees spontaneously transform. Transforming and wishing to function
I would immediately guide by the simplicity of the nameless.

The simplicity of the nameless is akin to desirableness.

Desireless and at rest the world would naturally become peaceful. <span

The charm of Calvary is the non-attachment and abstention from assertive
action of its Central Figure. Free from care for the body or the things
of the body, "desireless and at rest," the Lord Jesus became the grain
of wheat (Cf. John xii, 24) which is to-day transforming the world with
its harvests.
