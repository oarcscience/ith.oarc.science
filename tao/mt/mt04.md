"Let not him that seeketh cease from his search until he find, and when
he finds he shall wonder; wondering he shall reach the kingdom, and when
he reaches the kingdom he shall have rest."—*A logion of Jesus, recently
discovered*.

"Read not to contradict and refute, nor to believe and take for granted,
nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider."—*Lord
Bacon*.

### CHAPTER I.

The Tao which can be expressed is not the unchanging Tao <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md); the name which can be named is not the
unchanging name.

The nameless is the beginning of the Heaven Earth; <span
id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md) the mother of all things <span
id="fr_4"></span>[3](#fn_4.md) is the nameable.

Thus, while the eternal not-being <span id="fr_5"></span>[4](#fn_5.md)
leads towards the fathomless, the eternal being conducts to the
boundary. Although these two <span id="fr_6"></span>[5](#fn_6.md) have been
differently named they come from the same. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[6](#fn_7.md)

As the same they may be described as the abysmal. The abyss of the
abysmal <span id="fr_8"></span>[7](#fn_8.md) is the gate of all mystery.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

That aspect of God which is hidden in eternity, without bounds, without
limits, without beginning, must be distinguished from that side of God
which is expressed in nature and in man. The one, apparently subjective,
certainly unknowable; the other, a self-manifestation, or a going forth,
the commencement of our knowledge, as of our being. "No

man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the
bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him." Whether "the only begotten
Son" be identified with an historical person or not, the conception is
necessary to any thought of God. Without a self-revelation, the Eternal
Presence remains unknown. Hence the Indian has his avatars, the
Christian his incarnation.

Lao Tzu is strictly logical when he ascribes the origin of all phenomena
to the manifesting Deity, rather than to the Undifferentiated One, which
being changeless *could* not create.

Says Herbert Spencer: "The antithesis of subject and object, never to be
transcended while consciousness lasts, renders impossible all knowledge
of the Ultimate Reality in which subject and object are united."
(*Principles of Psychology*, i., 272.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[1:1](mt04.htm#fr_2.md) Hsü-hui-hi sagely observes
that as names always leave the essence unnamed it is certain that no
name can express the TAO.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[1:2](mt04.htm#fr_3.md) The noumenal or arûpa
world—the world of causes.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[1:3](mt04.htm#fr_4.md) The phenomenal or rûpa
world—the world of effects.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[1:4](mt04.htm#fr_5.md) Yet, as Hsü-hui-hi says, the
very term "Not-Being" is misleading, for the Tao is absolutely
inexpressible.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[1:5](mt04.htm#fr_6.md) The Tao in its two-fold
aspect.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[1:6](mt04.htm#fr_7.md) i.e. "That which is above
Being and Not-Being."—Native Commentator.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[1:7](mt04.htm#fr_8.md) Whence both Being and
Not-Being emerge.

N. B. Seek not for a name for God; for you will not find any: For
everything that is named is named by its letter so that the latter gives
the name and the former gives ear. Who then is he who hath given God a
name, "God" is not a "name," but an "opinion about God."—*Sextus*.

"There was when naught was; nay even that 'naught' was not aught of
things that are For that 'naught' is not simply the so-called ineffable;
it is beyond that, For that which is really ineffable is not named
ineffable, but is superior to every name that is used."—*Basilides*.
(vid. "Fragments of a Faith Forgotten" by G. R. S. Mead, p. 256.)
