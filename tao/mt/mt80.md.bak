### CHAPTER LXXVII.

The Divine Way is like the drawing of a bow,—it brings down the high and
exalts the low. <span id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) Where there is
superfluity it takes away, where there is deficiency it imparts. It is
the way of heaven to diminish abundance, and supplement
deficiency. <span id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_252.md)

The way of man is not so. He depletes the deficient, that he may
supplement the superfluous.

Who is able to have a superabundance for the service of the world? Only
the possessor of the Tao! Hence the Holy Man acts without priding
himself on his actions, completes his work without lingering on it;—he
has no desire to display his superiority. <span

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Man grasps all; God gives all. Man makes himself great; God is content
to be small. Man loves to surpass others; God strives that all may be
one. A Chinese commentator suggests that Heaven, because universal,
equalizes, but that man, because exceedingly parochial, differentiates.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_251"></span>[126:1](mt80.htm#fr_251.md) So Prof. Giles renders
this sentence in his *Remains of Lao-Tzu;* he adds an explanatory
note—"When the bow held vertically (as the Chinese hold it) is drawn,
the upper nock is brought down while the lower nock is brought up."

<span id="fn_252"></span>[126:2](mt80.htm#fr_252.md) Dr. Carus remarks on
this passage that "while the first sentence is almost literally like
Christ's doctrine, 'whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased,' the
second sentence is the reverse of the New Testament teaching that,
'Whoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but
whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he
hath.' Matt. xiii, 12." The difference is, however, only verbal. Christ
and Lao-Tzu both teach that the Divine Way is equality, equilibrium, and
that whatever contravenes this is wrong. Cf. *Luke* iii, 4-6.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[126:3](mt80.htm#fr_253.md) Cf. chap.
[2](mt05.htm#an_ch_02.md). Says Huai-nan-tzu: "He does not depend on the
respect of others for his power, nor upon possession for his wealth, nor
upon brute force for his strength; but is able to soar between the
firmament above and the waters below, in company with his
creator."—*Taoist Texts* by Balfour, p. 92.

"The divine Way," "The Way of Heaven" is in the Chinese "The Tao of
Heaven." So also "The way of man" in the text is in the original "The
Tao of Man."
