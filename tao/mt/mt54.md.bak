### CHAPTER LI.

What the Tao produces and its energy <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_164.md) nourishes, nature forms and natural
forces establish. On this account there is nothing that does not honor
the Tao and reverence its energy. This honor and reverence are
spontaneous, not the result of a mandate.

So the Tao produces. Its energy nourishes, increases, feeds,
establishes, matures, controls, broods over. It produces, but keeps
nothing for itself; acts, but does not depend on its action; increases,
but does not insist on having its own way. This indeed is the mystery of
energy. <span id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_165.md)

               "The lark  
Soars up and up, shivering for very joy;  
Afar the ocean sleeps; white fishing gulls  
Flit where the strand is purple with its tribe  
Of nested limpets; subject creatures seek  
Their loves in wood and plane—and God renews  
His common rapture."

</div>

Professor Drummond expresses the innerness of this chapter when he
writes—"Are we quite sure, that what we call a physical world, is, after
all a physical world? The preponderating view of science at present is
that it is not. The very term 'natural world,' we are told, is a
misnomer; that the world is a spiritual world, merely employing 'matter'
for its manifestation." "Raise the stone and there thou shalt find me,
cleave the wood and there am I." *Sayings of our Lord*. (Logion v.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_164"></span>[87:1](mt54.htm#fr_164.md) The word rendered
"energy" is again the *Teh* of chap. 38. "That which below produces the
grain, and above becomes the stars, that which circulates through heaven
and earth, is called the Divine Energy."—*Kuan-tzu* Wu-ch’eng in his
commentary refuses to distinguish between the Tao and its energy. cf.
*Eph*. iv, 6.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[87:2](mt54.htm#fr_165.md) Translated by Dr.
Edkins "Secret Energy." The original is "secret or profound Teh." Comp.
the conclusion of chap. [2](mt05.htm#an_ch_02.md).
