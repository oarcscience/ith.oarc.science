### CHAPTER XXXIV.

Supreme is the Tao! All pervasive; it can be on the left hand and on the
right.

All things depend on it for life, and it denies none.

Its purposes accomplished, it claims no credit.

It clothes and fosters <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md) all things,
but claims no lordship.

Ever desireless, it may be named 'The Indivisible.'

All things revert to it, but it claims no lordship. It may be named 'The
Supreme.'

Because to the end it does not seek supremacy; it is able to accomplish
great things. <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125.md)

Says an unknown pagan quoted by Philoponus—"All things are full of God:
on all sides hath He ears, ears that hear, can hear through rocks, and
compass earth, and pierce through man himself to hear the smallest
thought he hides within his breast."

And says a modern theologian: <span id="fr_126"></span>[\*](#fn_126.md)
"The universe is God living his life, and living it by limitation. But
beyond and behind are the infinite resources of his being."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_124"></span>[60:1](mt37.htm#fr_124.md) There is an alternative
reading—"lovingly nourishes."

<span id="fn_125"></span>[60:2](mt37.htm#fr_125.md) In many editions this
sentence refers to the Sage, and not to the Tao. Commenting on the
conclusion of the chapter Su Cheh says, "Who makes himself great is
small." See Matt. xx. 26, 28.

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

"Whither shall I go from Thy spirit?  
 Or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?  
 If I ascend into heaven, thou art there:  
 If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.  
 If I take the wings of the morning,  
 And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;  
 Even there shall Thy hand lead me,  
 And thy right hand shall hold me."  
                                       (Psa. cxxxix. 7-10.)
