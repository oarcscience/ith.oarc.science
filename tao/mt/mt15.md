### CHAPTER XII.

The five colors blind men's eyes. <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md)

The five tones deafen men's ears. <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md)

The five flavors blunt men's appetites. <span
id="fr_39"></span>[3](#fn_39.md)

Galloping and hunting derange men's minds. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[4](#fn_40.md)

Articles which are rare limit the freedom of men's actions. <span
id="fr_41"></span>[5](#fn_41.md)

On this account the holy man regards the stomach and not the eye. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[6](#fn_42.md)

He puts aside the one, that he may take the other in hand. <span

<div style="font-size: 90%">

What is born of the senses stupefies more than it stimulates. Man
realizes himself only as he polarizes his sense organs in the spiritual,
even as his spiritual faculties are polarized in the material; in other
words, as he overcomes "the terrible spirit of duality within,"
described in Rom. vii, and prayed against in the invocation, "Lead us
not into temptation," for the rainbow hues of earth blind the eyes to
the translucent glories of heaven, its harmonies drown heaven's
melodies, its

viands spoil the taste for the flavor of the "Bread of Life," and hence,
the Sage, who, in the language of Paul, is "dead unto sin, but alive
unto God," turns from the sensuous to the supersensuous, passes from the
narrow boundaries of the material to the limitless expanse of the
spiritual.

"Look not thou on beauty's charming,—  
Sit thou still when kings are arming,—  
Taste not when the wine cup glistens,—  
Speak not when the people listens,—  
Stop thine ear against the singer,—  
Prom the red gold keep thy finger,  
Vacant heart, and hand, and eye,  
Easy life and quiet die."  
                    —*Walter Scott*.

Said Thomas à Kempis in his "*The Imitation of Christ*": "Fly the tumult
of the world as much as thou canst, for we are quickly defiled and
enthralled by vanity." *The five colors blind men's eyes*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_37"></span>[21:1](mt15.htm#fr_37.md) viz.: Blue, yellow,
white, black, red. Tung-tei-ning notes that the more the eyes see the
more they desire. Cf. Eccles. i, 8.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[21:2](mt15.htm#fr_38.md) "Straus says that the
five sounds in old Chinese were, C, D, E, G, A, and that they were the
same with the five notes of old Scotch airs. The notes F and B are
avoided."—China Review, vol. xiii, p. 12.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[21:3](mt15.htm#fr_39).md) viz.: Sour, salt, sweet,
tart, bitter. Cf. Eccles. vi, 7.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[21:4](mt15.htm#fr_40.md) "Desire is limitless and
the cause of all trouble," says Tung-tei-ning. (Cp. ch. 64.)

<span id="fn_41"></span>[21:5](mt15.htm#fr_41.md) "Because," says Wang-pi,
"they lead men away from the straight path into byways full of
obstacles."

<span id="fn_42"></span>[21:6](mt15.htm#fr_42.md) "The stomach serves, the
eye demands service; therefore, the Sage discards the eye," is Wang-pi's
explanation.

Wu-ch’eng says that when the spirit becomes dyed with the colors of the
physical world, and feels impelled to investigate it, even to its
frontiers, it loses its balance. It is because it is the eye that is
chiefly the cause of this deflection that the chapter begins and ends
with a condemnation of that organ.

Su-chêh aptly remarks that while the eye covets more than it retains,
the stomach desires no more than it requires.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[21:7](mt15.htm#fr_43.md) Lit.—He withdraws from
this and accepts that. Wang-pi sums up the teaching of this seven-fold
chapter thus—"When the <span id="page_22">p. 22</span> ears, eyes, mouth
and mind are subservient to the soul, all is well; but when it is
otherwise, the spontaneity of man's nature is disturbed."

Chuang-tzu says: "A man who plays for counters will play well. If he
stake his girdle (in which he keeps his loose cash), he will be nervous;
if yellow gold, he will lose his wits. His skill is the same in each
case, but he is distracted by the value of his stake. And everyone who
attaches importance to the external becomes internally without
resource." *Chuang Tzu*, by H. A. Giles, p. 234.

"The teaching of Lau-tsze comes here, and in the 13th chapter very near
to that of Buddha."—*J. Edkins, D. D., China Review*, vol. xiii, 12,
