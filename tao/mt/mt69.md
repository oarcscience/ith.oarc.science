### CHAPTER LXVI.

That which enables the rivers and the seas to become the rulers of all
the water-courses is their ability to remain the lowest;—it is on this
account that they are the rulers of them all. <span
id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_216.md) In like manner the Holy Man, if he
wishes to direct the people must speak of himself as subject to them; if
he wishes to lead them he must put himself in the background. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[2](#fn_217.md) Hence the Sages are supreme,, but the
people are not burdened; they are in the vanguard, but the people are
not harmed. <span id="fr_218"></span>[3](#fn_218.md) For this reason the
whole Empire delights to exalt them, and no one feels annoyance. <span
id="fr_219"></span>[4](#fn_219.md) Because they do not strive there is none
who can strive with them. <span id="fr_220"></span>[5](#fn_220.md)

Mr. Disraeli's tribute to the Duke of Wellington provides an excellent
illustration of the teaching in this chapter

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

                 "Thy calm mien  
   Recalls old Rome, as much as thy high deed;  
 Duty thine only idol, and serene  
   When all are troubled; in the utmost need  
 Prescient; thy country's servant ever seen,  
   Yet sovereign of thyself whate'er may speed."  
Quoted in Sir Herbert Maxwell's "Life of Wellington."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_216"></span>[111:1](mt69.htm#fr_216.md) The same illustration
is used of the Tao in chap. [32](mt35.htm#an_ch_32.md).

<span id="fn_217"></span>[111:2](mt69.htm#fr_217.md) Comp. ch.
[7](mt10.htm#an_ch_07.md).

It is man's wisdom which prevents him from being wise; it is his desire
for lordship which keeps him from attaining power. The *postmortem* fame
of the Roman Emperor Aurelius rests on his lowliness rather than on his
"dignities." The constitutional sovereignty of today safeguards the
throne better than the sharpest tyranny of olden times. "The secret of
the Lord is with them that fear him."

Says Tung-kung-shu (B.C. 200), "When one places himself in his qualities
below others, in character he is above them; when he places them behind
those of others, in character he is before them."

Yang-hsiung (B.C. 53 A.D.) writes: "Men exalt him who humbles himself
below them; and gives the precedence to him who puts himself behind
them." (Quoted by Legge *in loc*.)

<span id="fn_218"></span>[111:3](mt69.htm#fr_218.md) i.e. They do not rebel
or disobey their superiors. Cf. chap. [60](mt63.htm#an_ch_60.md).

<span id="fn_219"></span>[111:4](mt69.htm#fr_219.md) Markgraf of Iyeyasu,
who by means of the sword transformed old feudal Japan and laid the
foundation of that country's greatness, when on his death bed sent for
his grandson and said to him: "You will one day have to govern the
Empire. Remember, the true way to govern the Empire is to have a
mercy-loving and tender heart."
