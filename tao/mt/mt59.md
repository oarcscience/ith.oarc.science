### CHAPTER LVI.

Who knows does not speak; who speaks does not know. <span
id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_184.md)

Close the doors of the senses; blunt the sharp; unravel the confused;
harmonise the dazzling; become one with the all. This is the Mystery of
Unity. <span id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_185.md) There will then neither be
love nor hate; profit nor loss; favor nor disgrace. It follows that in
the universe there is nothing nobler. <span

"The profoundest truths of spiritual experience are those which are not
intellectually ascertained but spiritually discerned, which are not
taught to us but revealed in us; and these never can be adequately put
into words. They defy definition; they transcend expression. The highest
experiences even of earthly love and hope and joy cannot be translated
into terms of common speech. As there is a life which can be expressed
only in terms of music, and another which is expressible only in terms
of art, so there is a life which is truly inexpressible. All that he who
has obtained even a glimpse of this realm can hope to do is to afford a
glimpse to others, by recalling a like experience in their life,
'comparing spiritual things with spiritual.'"—*Lyman Abbott, D. D.*

really do his work he becomes speechless about it."—*Sesame and Lilies*,
by John Ruskin, p. 149.

"But why should we expound our own views uncalled for? The danger of
self-assertion is there." *The Science of the Emotions* by Bhagavan
Das., p. 177.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[95:2](mt59.htm#fr_185.md) "Blunt your own sharp
points and you will be able to unravel the confusion of others; soften
your own glare, and you will be able to put yourself on a level with
others; then, when there is no difference between yourself and others,
when you are one with the world, you will have attained to spiritual
experiences which are inexpressible. Hence it is called the mystery of
unity."—*Wu-ch’eng*. Cf. *Matt*. vii, 1-5.
