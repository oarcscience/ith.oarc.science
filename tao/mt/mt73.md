### CHAPTER LXX.

It is very easy to comprehend my teachings and to put them into
practice. Yet there is no one in the world who is able either to
comprehend, or to practise them. <span id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_235)

There is an originating principle for speech, an authoritative law for
conduct, <span id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_236) but because this
knowledge is lacking I am unknown. <span id="fr_237"></span>[3](#fn_237)
Those who know Me are few; those who imitate Me are worthy. Hence the
Holy Man wears coarse garments, but carries a jewel in his bosom. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[4](#fn_238)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

If a man be before his time, though he stand in the midst of the sun, he
will appear to his contemporaries as one dwelling in darkness. The
"Wisdom of God" has always been a mystery, and because the "Princes of
this world" do not understand it they have in all ages "crucified the
Lord of Glory." (I Cor. ii, 7, 8.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_235"></span>[118:1](mt73.htm#fr_235) An analysis of the
atmosphere is a different affair from its inhalation. There is a
distinction between Truth and its expression. To intellectually
comprehend the words in which Truth clothes herself, is not to grasp
Truth herself. Truth can neither be written nor uttered. Truth is
Spirit, and besides Truth there is nothing. Cf. John vii, 17.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[118:2](mt73.htm#fr_236) Lit. "Words have an
ancestor; affairs a ruler."

<span id="fn_237"></span>[118:3](mt73.htm#fr_237) Confucius, Lao-tzu's
great contemporary, likewise complained that he was unknown. Cf.
Analects xiv, 37.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[118:4](mt73.htm#fr_238) The chapter reminds us
of the question of Jesus recorded in John viii, 43: "Why do ye not
understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word."
