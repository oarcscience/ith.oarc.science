### CHAPTER LXXV.

The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed
by their superiors. Because of this they suffer from famine. The people
are difficult to govern because of the officiousness of their superiors;
because of this they are difficult to govern. Men are continually <span
id="fr_247"></span>[1](#fn_247.md) dying because they lust after life;
because of this they frequently die.

It is only those with whom life is no object who truly value life. <span
id="fr_248"></span>[2](#fn_248.md)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

A warning to rulers and to ruled—The only safety of either a State or an
individual is to Seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness.
The more is grasped the less is possessed.

</div>

Huai-nan-tzu (B.C. 179) illustrates this chapter with a story: "Tzu-fei
of the kingdom of King (*the present provinces of Hunan and Hupeh*) went
to a certain place to obtain a very valuable two-edged sword. As he was
returning with his prize a terrible storm overtook the vessel, and two
scaly dragons wrapped themselves round the ship. Going to the captain
Tzu-fei said, 'If this continues how can we live?' The captain confessed
that it was the first time he had encountered such an experience,
whereupon Tzu-fei bracing himself for a conflict, bared his arm and
pulling his two-edged weapon from its sheath said, 'One may discuss
benevolence, righteousness and honor with heroes, but to waylay or
capture them is impossible. Here, in the midst of this sea I am but a
mass of rotten flesh and crumbling bones, though I lose my sword what
matters it? Is there anything at all to which I cling?' Leaping into the
waters he thrust the dragons through and cut off their heads. He thus
saved the lives of all his fellow passengers, and stilled the storm, and
for this was subsequently suitably rewarded by his prince."
