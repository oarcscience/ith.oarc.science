### CHAPTER XXXV.

Apprehend the inimitable conception, you attract the world; coming it
receives no harm, but is tranquil, peaceful, satisfied. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127)

Like transient guests, music and dainties pass away.

The Tao entering the mouth is insipid and without flavor; when looked at
it evades sight; when listened for it escapes the ear—(yet) its
operations are interminable.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Peace, prosperity, permanence of Empire, are according to the 72nd Psalm
(attributed by tradition to Solomon), dependent on the righteousness of
the King's rule—who apprehends the Inimitable, The Supreme, "The Hidden
Wisdom" (I Cor. ii, 6-30) is omnipotent, "the Alpha and the Omega," the
Ruler who directs the destinies of all. Yet THIS, which is ALL is
NO-THING.

(Cf. *The Classic of Purity*.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_127"></span>[61:1](mt38.htm#fr_127) The text may be read in
two ways and it is impossible to say which is correct. It may be
rendered as in the translation, or it may be understood thus—"Apprehend
the Inimitable Conception. Go throughout the world; go, without harm,
you will remain tranquil, peaceful, satisfied." The Chinese may be read
either way, and from the viewpoint of The Wisdom both interpretations
are equally true.
