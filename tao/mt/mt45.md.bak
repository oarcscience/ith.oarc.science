### CHAPTER XLII.

The Tao produced One. The One produced two; the two produced
three; <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) the three produced all
things.

Everything is permeated by the yin and the yang and vivified by the
immaterial breath. <span id="fr_142"></span>[2](#fn_142.md)

The above quotation would be perfectly intelligible to any Chinese
scholar without explanations. Indeed it would be difficult to convince
him that it had not been taken from his own writings.}

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

That which men hate is to be kithless, friendless and considered
unworthy, but princes and dukes thus style themselves. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[3](#fn_143.md) From this it would appear that
advantages are disadvantageous, and disadvantages are advantageous. I
teach that which others have taught.

The violent and the fierce do not live out their years.

I shall be chief among the teachers. <span

The trinitarian conception is universal. It is seen in the three-fold
character of cell growth—cell-enlargement, cell-specialization,
cell-multiplication; in the triune process year by year of birth in
spring, maturity in summer, decay in autumn; it is seen in the body,
soul and spirit of which man is composed; and in the father, mother,
offspring of the completed family life. As Zoroaster has said: "The
number 3 reigns throughout the universe, and the Monad is its
principle." It is natural therefore that Lao-tzu should give it a
prominent position in his philosophy; equally natural that he should
proceed without a break from the trinitarian process

of creation to humility. For not only is the Trinity everywhere, but
everywhere it is a sacrificing Trinity. The mineral kingdom gives its
life for the vegetable, the vegetable for the animal, while the mineral
and the vegetable are helped toward the realization of their being by
the expenditure of man's strength. So also in the Bible the Father
yields the Son, the Son does not please himself (Rom. xv, 3), and the
Spirit bears witness not to Himself, but to the other two persons of the
Trinity. Self-sacrifice is the root of life. Who seeks loses; who loses
finds. By this we perceive the advantages of the disadvantageous, and
the disadvantages of the advantageous.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_141"></span>[72:1](mt45.htm#fr_141.md) Georg von der Gablentz
observes that rendered literally this should read—

1\. (Tao) + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7. See Dr. Edkins illuminative historical notes
in The China Review, vol. xiii. p. 16. Universal Genesis starts from the
One, breaks into Three, then Five, and finally culminates in Seven, to
return into Four, Three, and One. Cf. *Secret Doctrine*, ii, 170, 658.
See also iii, 397 et al.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[72:2](mt45.htm#fr_142.md) 2. In an essay on
Tauism published in the first volume of the "China Review," Chalmers
gives the following—"There is a Trinity observable in all the
manifestations of Tau, corresponding to the three principal senses in
man, hearing, seeing, and feeling, and to sound, colour and form, in the
external world. The terms of this trinity are generally in Chinese,
*Yin*, *Yang* and *Hwo-hi*. The *Hwo-hi*—the harmonious Breath or
Spirit,—is held by Lau-tsze to be present in nature intermediate between
the *yin* and *yang;* which you must know, denotes in Chinese the two
members of 'an inevitable dualism which bisects nature.' (Emerson)
Heaven and Earth, for instance, are a duality, the greatest duality of
which we have any cognizance, but there is an intermediate Breath—we may
call it a Spirit,—shadowed forth in the spiritual nature of man, which
constitutes the third term. Thus while the Confucianists, following the
Yih-king, rest in Dualism, and materialism; the Tauist, though denying
an eternal, personal God, is a sort of Trinitarian, and the third member
of his trinity is Spirit, personal or impersonal. No numerical character
belongs to Tau, however, for Tau is *chaotic;* when the mind approaches
that, all things seem to be blended in *unity* and it remains utterly
inscrutable."

In the same essay we find the following quotation describing the
Pythagorean theory of numbers—

Unity is a male monad, begetting after the manner of a parent all the
rest of the numbers. Secondly, the *duad* is a female number, and the
same also is by arithmeticians called even. Thirdly, the *triad* is a
male number. This also has been classified by arithmeticians under the
denomination uneven. And in addition to all these is the *tetrad*, a
female number, and the same also is called even, because it is female.
Therefore all the numbers that have been derived from the genus are
four; but number is the indefinite genus, from which was constituted
according to them, the perfect number, viz. the decade. For one, two,
three, four become ten if its proper denomination be preserved
essentially for each of the numbers. Pythagoras <span id="page_73">p.
73</span> affirmed this to be a sacred quaternion source of everlasting
nature, having, as it were, roots in itself; and that from this number
all the numbers receive that originating principle. For eleven, and
twelve, and the rest partake of the origin of existence from ten. Of
this decade, the perfect number, there are termed four divisions, namely
monad, square and cube. And the connections and blendings of these are
performed, according to nature, for the generation of growth completing
the productive number. For when the square is multiplied into itself, a
biquadratic is the result. But when the square is multiplied into the
cube, the result is the product of a square and cube; and when the cube
is multiplied into the cube, the product of two cubes is the result. So
that all the numbers from which the production of existing (numbers)
arises is seven, namely monad, number, square, cube, biquadratic,
quadratic cube, cubocube." *Hippolylus*, (Ante-Nicene Christian Library,
Vol. vi. p. 32.)

<span id="fn_143"></span>[73:3](mt45.htm#fr_143.md) Indicating that any
virtue they possess lies in the unsearchable realms of the infinite
rather than on the objective plane of existence. See ch.
[39](mt42.htm#an_ch_39.md).

<span id="fn_144"></span>[73:4](mt45.htm#fr_144.md) The advantages of
weakness had been taught before Lao-tzu, but not the danger of
self-assertiveness. It is on his insistence on this that Lao-tzu bases
his claim to be a leader of the leaders. See chaps.
[9](mt12.htm#an_ch_09), [29](mt32.htm#an_ch_29.md),
[30](mt33.htm#an_ch_30), [73](mt76.htm#an_ch_73.md),
