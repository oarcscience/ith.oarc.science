### CHAPTER XLIII.

The world's weakest drives the world's strongest.

The indiscernible penetrates where there are no crevices. <span
id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145.md)

From this I perceive the advantages of non-action. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_146.md)

Few indeed in the world realize the instructions of the silence, or the
benefits of inaction. <span id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_147.md)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Those who have heard the voice which speaks in the silence, and have
learned the benefits of non-action know that no armour is so safe a
panoply as the shield of weakness, even according to that strange word
of the Apostle Peter, "Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh,
ARM yourselves also with the same mind." The Christ conquered on the
cross; His crown of thorns is a crown of crowns, and my greatest
strength lies in my power to divest myself of self. Though indiscernible
this power "penetrates where there are no crevices."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_145"></span>[75:1](mt46.htm#fr_145.md) "Without and within all
beings, immovable and also movable; by reason of His subtlety
imperceptible; at hand and far away is That." *Bhagavad Gita*.

"For wisdom is more moving than any motion; she passeth and goeth
through all things by reason of her pureness."—*Wisdom of Solomon*, vii,
24.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[75:2](mt46.htm#fr_146.md) As the indiscernible
meets with no obstacles, so the power of non-action is irresistible.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[75:3](mt46.htm#fr_147.md) Chinese history
supplies a severe, if somewhat crude example, of the doctrine of
inaction. It is stated that when Ju-shih-ki (Tang dynasty A.D. 618-905)
was on the eve of accepting an official position, his uncle called him
and said that he felt ill at ease respecting him. "What will you do,
Nephew," he asked, "if some one strikes you?" "Receive the blow in
meekness" was the reply. "If you are reviled, what then?" "I shall be
silent." "What if you are spat upon?" "I shall wipe away the spittle."
"In doing that," answered his uncle, "*you may be showing resentment to
the spitter, and that would be a wrong*."
