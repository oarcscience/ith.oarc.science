### CHAPTER XXI.

The comprehensiveness of supreme energy is its conformity to the
Tao. <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md)

The Tao considered as an entity is impalpable, indefinite. Indefinite,
impalpable, within are conceptions. Impalpable, indefinite, within are
shapes. <span id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_87.md) Profound, obscure, within is
the essence. This essence being supremely real, within is sincerity.

From the beginning until now it has not changed, <span
id="fr_88"></span>[3](#fn_88.md) and thus it has watched all the
essentials. How do I know it has been thus with all principles? By what
has just been said.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

As the gospels, filled with the presence of the Master, preserve no
notes of the disciples' sermons, so the true mystic sees God alone in
the universe. Is not the spiritual the home of the physical? Is not
conformity to the Tao the comprehensiveness of the Energy which is
supreme? "In Him we live and move and have our being." "It is His
fullness that filleth all in all." "And by Him all things consist." "But
the Lord is in his holy temple: be silent before him all the earth."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_86"></span>[39:1](mt24.htm#fr_86.md) See ch. 38.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[39:2](mt24.htm#fr_87.md) "The cosmos is
all-formed—not having forms external to itself, but changing them itself
within itself. Since, then, cosmos is made to be all-formed, what may
its maker bet For that, on the one hand, He should not be void of all
form; and, on the other hand, if He's all-formed, He will be like the
cosmos. Whereas, again, has He a single form, He will thereby be less
than cosmos. What, then, say we He is?—that we may not bring our sermon
into doubt; for naught that mind conceives of God is doubtful. He, then,
hath one *idea*, which is His own alone, which doth not fall beneath the
sight, being bodiless, and (yet) by means of bodies manifesteth all
(ideas). And marvel not that there's a bodiless idea." *The mind to
Hermes*, by G. R. S. Mead, in *The Theosophical Review*, vol. xxxiii.,
p. 52.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[39:3](mt24.htm#fr_88.md) Lit.—"Its Name has not
departed." Noumenally the Tao is eternal and unchanging; phenomenally It
has a beginning and consequently an end.
