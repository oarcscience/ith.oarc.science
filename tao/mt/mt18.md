### CHAPTER XV.

Profound indeed were the most excellent among the ancients, penetrating,
fathomless; inasmuch as they were fathomless it becomes necessary to
employ far fetched symbols when speaking of them.

Irresolute—as if fording a stream in winter.

Timid—as though fearful of their neighbors.

Grave—as if they were guests. <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54)

Elusive—like ice about to melt.

Simple—like raw material. <span id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55)

Expansive—like the space between hills.

Turbid—like muddy water. <span id="fr_56"></span>[3](#fn_56)

Who can still the turbid and make it gradually clear; or quiet the
active so that by degrees it shall become productive? Only he who keeps
this Tao, without desiring fullness. If one is not full it is possible
to be antiquated and not newly fashioned. <span

The innerness of no faith can be reached unless there is a profound
sympathy with its devotees, the public statements

often being but veils, hiding more than they reveal. This was so in
Egypt, Greece, Rome, India and Persia; even "the aborigines of Central
Australia to-day have their secret rites and doctrines revealed only to
the males of the tribe after passing the manhood tests, and rigidly
concealed, not only from the outside world, but from their own women and
children." Jesus talked in parables to the crowd, explanations were
reserved for His disciples. In the early Christian centuries truths
unspoken in the public pulpits were revealed to a *disciplina arcani*.
So also Lao-tzu is more impressed with the reticence of the ancients
than with their eloquence. Only that self-restrained silence, born of
"the peace of God, which passeth all understanding," and which seeks no
earthly "fullness," can clear turbidity and make outward activity wholly
productive without any destructive element. For such a storm is as a
calm, or the echo of distant music.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_54"></span>[26:1](mt18.htm#fr_54) Chinese etiquette
requires that a guest shall preserve due gravity in the presence of his
host, to express his consciousness that he is where he is not himself a
master, and must therefore guard himself.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[26:2](mt18.htm#fr_55) "Simplicity is the
highest quality of expression. It is that quality to which art comes in
its supreme moments. It marks the final stage of growth. It is the
rarest, as it is the most precious, result which men secure in their
self-training."

<span id="fn_56"></span>[26:3](mt18.htm#fr_56) This seven-fold
illustration marks a certain progression—1. There is uncertainty of
purpose. 2. The naturally resultant timidity of expression. 3. Yet a
consciousness of a certain kind of standing. 4. But the position allows
of no self assertion. 5. Nevertheless there is an inner center round
which the whole man focuses his strength. 6. And from this inner center
of self-consciousness there springs an all-embracing comprehensiveness.
7. This comprehensiveness because including All is as No-Thing (*Turbid,
like mudded water*.)

<span id="fn_57"></span>[26:4](mt18.htm#fr_57) All external conditions
alike. Old age as serviceable as youth; youth as fruitful as old age.
