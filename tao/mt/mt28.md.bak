### CHAPTER XXV.

There was a completed, amorphous something before the Heaven-Earth was
born. <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md) Tranquil! Boundless! Abiding
alone and changing not! Extending everywhere without risk. It may be
styled 'the world-mother.' <span id="fr_101"></span>[2](#fn_101.md)

I do not know its name, but characterize it—the Tao. Arbitrarily forcing
a name upon it I call it the Great. Great, it may be said to be
transitory. Transitory, it becomes remote. Remote, it returns. <span
id="fr_102"></span>[3](#fn_102.md)

The Tao, then, is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; a king is also
great. <span id="fr_103"></span>[4](#fn_103.md) In space there are four
that are great, and the king dwells there as one of them.

Man's standard is the earth. Earth's standard is the Heaven. Heaven's
standard is the Tao. The Tao's standard is spontaneity. <span

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lao-tzu's symbol
for perfection, has a modern apostle in that master of art critics, John
Ruskin. This is what he writes in "Sesame and Lilies":

"All good work is essentially done that way—without hesitation, without
difficulty, without boasting; and in the doers of the best there is an
inner and involuntary power which approximates literally to the instinct
of an animal. Nay, I am certain that in the most perfect human artists
reason does *not* supersede instinct, but is added to an instinct as
much more divine than that of the lower animals as the human body is
more beautiful than theirs." (III ed. p. 149.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_100"></span>[44:1](mt28.htm#fr_100.md) The Tao is neither
clear nor misty, high nor low; neither here nor there, good nor evil; as
without shape, yet as having shape, and none know whence It came. Yet It
has always existed, and the Heaven-Earth sprang from it.—Su-cheh.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[44:2](mt28.htm#fr_101.md) Lit. "The
Mother-of-all-under-heaven."—*Kundalini*.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[44:3](mt28.htm#fr_102.md) From Non-existence the
Tao comes into Existence, and returns whence It appeared. In other words
Manvantara succeeds Pralaya, and Pralaya follows Manvantara throughout
Eternity.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[44:4](mt28.htm#fr_103.md) I. *Esdras* iv, 1-12.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[44:5](mt28.htm#fr_104.md) The monarch is only
great as he is worthy of being the visible representative of the
Invisible Powers, The Four Great Ones (the Lords of Karma). This courtly
phraseology conveys a veiled warning to the reigning sovereign that
there were Those higher than he. The warning is repeated and emphasized
in less disguised language in the succeeding chapter.

"If man conform to the (requirements of) the earth he obtains all that
he needs; if the earth conform to (the laws of) heaven it becomes
fertile; if heaven conform to the Tao it becomes able to fulfill Its
functions; if the Tao conform to Spontaneity It realizes Itself. Then
that which should be square becomes square, and that which should be
round becomes round."—*Wang-pi*.
