### CHAPTER XVI.

Abstraction complete, quiescence maintained unalloyed, <span
id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) the various forms arise with one accord,
and I observe that each returns again. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59.md) All things thrive and increase, then each
returns again to the root. <span id="fr_60"></span>[3](#fn_60.md) This
return to the root is called 'stillness,' <span
id="fr_61"></span>[4](#fn_61.md) or it may be described as a return to
report that they have fulfilled their destiny. This report is called
'the unchanging rule.' <span id="fr_62"></span>[5](#fn_62.md)

Knowledge of this unchanging rule is called 'illumination.' Those who
are ignorant of it give way to abandon and to recklessness.

Knowledge of this unchanging rule leads to toleration.

Toleration leads to comprehension. <span id="fr_63"></span>[6](#fn_63.md)

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

Comprehension leads to sovereignty. <span id="fr_64"></span>[7](#fn_64.md)

Sovereignty leads to heaven-likeness.

Heaven-likeness leads to the Tao.

The Tao leads to continuity.

Though the body be no more, there is then no danger. <span

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Plato says: "When a man is always occupied with the cravings of desire
and ambition, and is eagerly striving to satisfy them, all his thoughts
must be mortal, and, as far as it is possible altogether to become such,
he must be mortal every whit, because he has cherished his mortal part.
But he who has been earnest in the love of knowledge and of true wisdom,
and has exercised his intellect more than any other part of him, must
have thoughts immortal and divine, if he attain truth, and in so far as
human nature is capable of sharing in immortality, he must be altogether
immortal; and since he is ever cherishing the divine power, and has the
divinity within him in perfect order, he will be perfectly happy." <span
id="fr_66"></span>[\*](#fn_66.md) "Knowledge of the Unchanging Rule," says
Lao-tzu, is the first step, viz., detachment from the external, even as
Nature sacrifices its objective existence to retire whence it came and
announce the purport of its forthcoming fulfilled. In the language of
one of the Upanishads, "When all the bonds of the heart are broken, then
the man becomes immortal. *Though the body be no more, there is then no
danger*."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_58"></span>[28:1](mt19.htm#fr_58.md) Su Cheh observes that
neither abstraction nor quiescence are complete unless unconscious. So
long as they are maintained with effort there can be neither absolute
abstraction nor perfect stillness.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[28:2](mt19.htm#fr_59.md) "I think that what struck
Lao Tzu was the fact that vegetable life seemed to be controlled by the
quiet and invisible root: from it everything comes forth as having
received a commission: to it there is a return, as if reporting the
fulfillment of the commission."—*J. P. Maclagan*.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[28:3](mt19.htm#fr_60.md)

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

"That each, who seems a separate whole,  
 Should move his rounds, and fusing all  
 The skirts of self again, should fall  
 Remerging in the general soul."—*Tennyson*.

</div>

<span id="fn_61"></span>[28:4](mt19.htm#fr_61.md) The word here translated,
"stillness," is the same as that rendered "quiescence" in the first
sentence, suggesting a similitude between the ideal rest of the soul and
the rest or pralaya of the vegetable kingdom.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[28:5](mt19.htm#fr_62.md) "As thousands of sparks
rise from the fire, and then again merge into the fire; as clouds of
dust rise in the air, and then rest again in the dust; as thousands of
bubbles rise in tie rivers, and melt into water again in the same way
from non-being come forth beings, and merge in Him again."—*Central
Hindu College Magazine*, May, 1902.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[28:6](mt19.htm#fr_63.md) The submergence of the
personal I into the impersonal All.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[29:7](mt19.htm#fr_64.md) Complete sway over
desire.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[29:8](mt19.htm#fr_65.md) Because no longer bound
to earth, "which time is wont to prey upon."
