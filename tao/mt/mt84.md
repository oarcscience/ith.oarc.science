### CHAPTER LXXXI.

Sincere words are not (necessarily) pleasant, nor are pleasant words
(necessarily) sincere.

The good are not (necessarily) skillful debaters, nor are skillful
debaters (necessarily) good men. <span id="fr_262"></span>[1](#fn_262)

The wise are not (necessarily) well-informed, nor are the well-informed
(necessarily) wise. <span id="fr_263"></span>[2](#fn_263)

The Holy Man does not accumulate. He works for others, yet ever has
abundance for himself; he gives to others, yet himself ever possesses
superabundance.

The divine way is advantageous, without danger; the way of the Sages is
effective without struggle. <span id="fr_264"></span>[3](#fn_264)

The book closes as it began. In the first chapter we saw the Tao
differentiate and lose itself that the universe might become, and in the
last our attention is directed to the Man in whom the Tao is
incarnate—ever active, but keeping nothing for himself.

"A man there was, though some did count him mad,  
 The more he gave away, the more he had." <span

'With plausible speech and fine manners will seldom be found moral
character.'" *Analects*.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[131:2](mt84.htm#fr_263) "Confucius remarked,
'A man who possesses moral worth will always have something to say worth
listening to; but a man who has something to say is not necessarily a
man of moral worth.'" *Analects*.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[131:3](mt84.htm#fr_264) The last sentence is
according to the rendering of Mr. T. W. Kingsmill.

*Lit*.—"Heaven's Tao benefits but injures not; the Holy Man's Tao acts
but strives not."
