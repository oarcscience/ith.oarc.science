### CHAPTER XLIV.

Fame or life, which is dearer? Life or wealth, which is more? Gain or
loss, which is worse?

Excessive love implies excessive outlay. Immoderate accumulation implies
heavy loss. <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md)

Who knows contentment meets no shame. Who knows when to stop incurs no
danger. Such long endure.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

We possess nothing more valuable than our ideals, but the only ideal
which is not immoderate is that ideal content which is content with
nothing for self; to stop short of this is to linger where danger lurks.
Mystics of all ages, irrespective of their religious profession have
realized this. A few paragraphs from a Spanish Catholic of the sixteenth
century—Saint Jean de la Croix—will illustrate Lao-tzu's thought:

“To enjoy the taste of all things, have no taste for anything.

“To know all things, learn to know nothing.

“To possess all things, resolve to possess nothing.

“To be all things, be willing to be nothing.

“To get to where you have no taste for anything, go through whatever
experiences you have no taste for.

“To learn to know nothing, go whither you are ignorant.

“To reach what you possess not, go whithersoever you own nothing.

“To be what you are not, experience what you are not.

“When you stop at anything, you cease to open yourself to the All.

“For to come to the All, you must give up the All.

“And if you should attain to owning the All, you must own it, desiring
Nothing.” <span id="fr_149"></span>[\*](#fn_149.md)

With this compare an hitherto untranslated saying by Lu Hui-neng, the
sixth and last Chinese Buddhist Patriarch: "To be able to separate one's
self from all affections is the pith of tranquillity."
