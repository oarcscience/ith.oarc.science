### CHAPTER XXVII.

Good doers leave no tracks. <span id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108) True
words have no defects. Skillful plans require no calculations. Able
closers need no locks and bars, yet none can open what they shut. <span
id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_109) Real strength wants no cords, yet none
can loose it. <span id="fr_110"></span>[3](#fn_110)

It follows that the Holy Man when helping others, works in accordance
with the unchanging goodness. Hence, He rejects none. He does the same
when helping nature to develop. Therefore, he rejects nothing. This may
be called 'obscured perception.' <span id="fr_111"></span>[4](#fn_111)

Thus the Good Man is the bad man's instructor; the bad man the Good
Man's material. Yet he does not esteem himself a teacher, <span
id="fr_112"></span>[5](#fn_112) nor does he love his material. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[6](#fn_113)

Although one may be wise, here he is deceived. <span

This is 'The Cardinal Mystery.' <span id="fr_115"></span>[7](#fn_115)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The Christ declared that his disciples were the salt of the earth, the
light of the world; but salt and light act towards all things with equal
impartiality; moreover, the salt, because one with the whole, is
unnoticed when the flavors are praised; light is indistinguishable from
the landscape which it reveals. "*Good doers leave no tracks*." It is
this universalizing of his heart which gives the Sage his power. One
with God he is one with all. The fuel dies that the flame may soar. What
would become of man if the atmospheric oxygen insisted on remaining
itself? The mother travails in pain that the child may be born. The
cross is the center of all—"the symbol, not of separatism, but of
universality."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_108"></span>[48:1](mt30.htm#fr_108) Matt. vi. 3.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[48:2](mt30.htm#fr_109) i.e. They are
independent of externals.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[48:3](mt30.htm#fr_110) The paragraph teaches
that the most forceful energies operate on the spiritual planes. Prayers
are more valuable than gold.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[48:4](mt30.htm#fr_111) In his dealings with
humanity the Sage never departs from the eternal law of the Divine
Wisdom, that every cause produces its own effect, and that no effect
occurs without an adequate cause. The idea may be illustrated by a verse
in section 99 of the Koran: "Whosoever hath wrought an ant's weight of
good shall behold it, And whosoever hath wrought an ant's weight of evil
shall behold it." (Stanley Poole's translation.)

The "perception" of the Sage is said to be obscured because it regards
the hidden Law, rather than the immediate gain or immediate loss of the
individual. The miracles of the Christ were the phenomena of his
ministry of which he thought least.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[48:5](mt30.htm#fr_112) Says Su Cheh: "Though
himself unable to forget the world, the Sage is able to let the world
forget him."

<span id="fn_113"></span>[48:6](mt30.htm#fr_113) 11e radiates power as
the sun heat. The Lord Jesus was more concerned to witness for the truth
than to save individuals.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[48:6a](mt30.htm#fr_114) Cf. chaps.
[20](mt23.htm#an_ch_20), [58](mt61.htm#an_ch_58),
[73](mt76.htm#an_ch_73).

<span id="fn_115"></span>[49:7](mt30.htm#fr_115) Huai-nan-tza
illustrates the general teaching of the chapter by two illustrations
from Chinese history. The Builder of the Great Wall could not retain the
succession to the throne in his family; whereas the descendants of the
virtuous Wu Wang swayed the scepter for thirty-four generations.

"Mystery" here reminds us of The Abyss of chap. [1](mt04.htm#an_ch_01).
