### CHAPTER LII.

Everything has its origin in the mother of all under heaven. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166.md)

To know the mother the child must be perceived; the child being born the
qualities of the mother must be maintained, to the end of life there
will be then no peril. <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_167.md)

Close the doors of the senses, and the whole of life will be without
care; open them, attend to the affairs of life and to the end
deliverance will be impossible. <span id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_168.md)

Perceive the germ,—that is enlightenment. <span
id="fr_169"></span>[4](#fn_169.md)

Maintain weakness,—that is stability. Employ the light; revert to this
enlightenment; no calamity will then be bequeathed to the body. <span
id="fr_170"></span>[5](#fn_170.md)

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

This is indeed to practice the unalterable. <span

Those who live the life of the body die, but for those who live the life
of soul

"There is no death! The stars go down  
   To rise upon some other shore,  
 And bright in heaven's jeweled crown  
   They shine for evermore."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_166"></span>[88:1](mt55.htm#fr_166.md) In all mythologies the
male stands for the Unmanifest, the female for the Manifested—the womb
which gave birth to creation. See Isis, and the goddess Moot, the
Mother, of Egypt, The Sephira of the Kabalists; Aditi of the Hindoos;
Sophia of the Gnostics; Wisdom in the Proverbs of Solomon. In all
theogonies we find the symbol of the egg, the ovum of the mystic mother.
In Christendom it survives in the "Easter Egg."

<span id="fn_167"></span>[88:2](mt55.htm#fr_167.md) Separation is necessary
for growth, but safety lies in the preservation of the consciousness of
non-separateness.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[88:3](mt55.htm#fr_168.md) The text may be
illustrated by a parable from Chuang-tzu—"There was once a man who was
afraid of his own shadow, and had a strong dislike to his oven
footprints. So he tried to escape from both; but the quicker he ran the
more footprints he made, and fast as he went his shadow kept up with
him. He thought he was going too slowly, so he ran faster and faster
without stopping, until his strength gave out and be fell dead. He did
not know that if he stayed in a shady place his shadow would have
disappeared, and that if he had only remained quiet and motionless he
would not have made any footprints. Stupid fellow that he
was."—*Chuang-tzu* by Balfour.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[88:4](mt55.htm#fr_169.md) "Injuries spring from
desires, though small in the beginning they swell to great dimensions.
Now to know that the small will become great, and to exclude it, that
may be said to be enlightenment.'—*Su-cheh*.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[88:5](mt55.htm#fr_170.md) Bodily vigor, like
mental purity, depends on what the mind relates itself to.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[89:6](mt55.htm#fr_171.md) Compare chaps.
[16](mt19.htm#an_ch_16) and [55](mt58.htm#an_ch_55.md).
