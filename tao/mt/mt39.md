### CHAPTER XXXVI.

When about to inhale it is certainly necessary to open the mouth; when
about to weaken it is certainly necessary to strengthen; when about to
discard it is certainly necessary to promote; when about to take away it
is certainly necessary to impart—this is atomic perception.

The weak overcome the strong.

Fish cannot leave the deeps.

The innerness of the government cannot be shown to the people.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

"Though He was a Son, yet (He) learned obedience by the things which He
suffered; and having been made perfect, He became unto all them that
obey Him the cause of eternal salvation." Before the Christ could weaken
the pride of the sinner and humble man's false exaltation He had to
strengthen and uplift the sinner with the knowledge that He had Himself
become for his sake "of no reputation." The intellect may fail to grasp
the full meaning of this sacrifice but the spirit knows that its safety
lies in surrendering before the surrender of God on its behalf, even as
the security of the fish lies in the yielding water.
