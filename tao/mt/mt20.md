### CHAPTER XVII.

First the supreme. Then a sense of separateness. Next preferences and
eulogies. Lastly, fear. Then scorn. <span id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67)

Hence it is plain that lack of sincerity has its origin in superficial
faith.

Cautious! They valued their words, <span id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68)
accomplished their purposes, settled their affairs, and the people all
said: 'We are spontaneous.' <span id="fr_69"></span>[3](#fn_69)

In Eden, man at first had no consciousness of himself. He was untempted
because without personal desire. It was the contemplation of the fruit
as of something which had the power of pleasing, which gave birth to the
idea of caring and striving for that phenomenal self whose reflection
finds its center in our emotions and judgments. It is the separation of
our personalities from our true individuality which arouses within us
the sense of conflict. *First the Supreme; then a sense of
separateness*. Preferences, eulogies, fear, scorn, are inevitable
results. At this stage man loses his power over nature. "Thorns and
thistles" grow apace. Duty becomes labor. The curse is pronounced—"In
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread."

How shall the *status quo ante* be attained? By retracing the false
steps. Contemplation of the True and Eternal must revive and nourish the
lost faith. The emotions must be brought under control, so that no
excess of feeling shall cause the mouth to exaggerate or distort truth.
Words must be weighed, so that there shall ever be a proper relation
between the spoken speech and the person to whom it is addressed. By
sympathetic insight, which looks at everything from the view-point

accomplished, and those affected by us helped and not hindered. Without
understanding why, the whole neighborhood will be benefited. *And the
people all said, "We are natural."*

"Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath. If any
man seemeth to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue, but
deceiveth his heart, this man's religion is vain. For in many things we
all stumble. If any stumble not in word, the same is a perfect man, able
to bridle the whole body also."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_67"></span>[30:1](mt20.htm#fr_67) The various stages of
descent into matter. Students will recall the well-known Gnostic phrase,
"the falling down of the Aeons."

<span id="fn_68"></span>[30:2](mt20.htm#fr_68) "The ancients were slow
of speech, lest in their acts they should not come up to what they said.
The wise man is slow of utterance, but diligent in action."—*Confucius*.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[30:3](mt20.htm#fr_69) Chuang-tzu aptly
describes the mass of mankind as babes who receive "the benefits of a
mother's care without troubling themselves to think to whom they are
indebted for them."
