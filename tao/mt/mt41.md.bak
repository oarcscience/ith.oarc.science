### CHAPTER XXXVIII.

Superior energy is non-action, hence it is energy. <span
id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md)

Inferior energy will not resign action; hence, it is not energy. <span
id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_130.md)

Superior energy is actionless because motiveless. <span
id="fr_131"></span>[3](#fn_131.md)

Inferior energy acts from motive.

Superior magnanimity is active but motiveless.

Superior equity is active from motive.

Superior propriety <span id="fr_132"></span>[4](#fn_132.md) is
active; <span id="fr_133"></span>[5](#fn_133.md) it bares its arm and
asserts itself when it meets with no response. <span
id="fr_134"></span>[6](#fn_134.md)

Thus as the Tao recedes there are energies; as the energies recede there
is magnanimity; as magnanimity recedes there is equity; as equity
recedes there is propriety. <span id="fr_135"></span>[7](#fn_135.md)

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

Inasmuch as propriety is the attenuation of conscientiousness it is the
origin of disorder.

The beginnings of consciousness are flowers of the Tao, but the
commencement of delusion.

Therefore the men who are great <span id="fr_136"></span>[8](#fn_136.md)
live with that which is substantial, they do not stay with that which is
superficial; they abide with realities, they do not remain with what is
showy. The one they discard, the other they hold.

The highest energy appears as inaction. To pray the Father in secret is
more effective than shouting to the unresponsive crowd. A realization of
the "mystery" of the Kingdom, and an understanding of the "riches of the
glory" of Christ in the heart is a higher experience than conscious
effort to "do all in the name of the Lord Jesus," or even than earnest
strife to produce "the fruit of the Spirit." These are excellencies
which are indispensable, but they arc lights which cast shadows; that
which is highest—superior energy—is shadowless. The higher will always
result in the lower, but all attempts to build up the lower without the
spiritual backing of the higher works as much evil as good. Rudyard
Kipling somewhere says, "Good work has nothing to do with, doesn't
belong to, the person who does it. It is put into him or her from the
outside." Jesus said the same when He declared the kingdom of God to be
composed of those who are unconscious of self—"Suffer the little
children …

such is the kingdom of heaven." "Many will say to Me in that day, Lord,
Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons,
and by thy name do many mighty works? And then will I profess unto them,
I never knew you; depart from Me, ye that work iniquity."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_129"></span>[64:1](mt41.htm#fr_129.md) In this chapter, as
elsewhere, though Lao-tzu employs conventional terms, he suggests rather
than expresses. "Unto them that are without all things are done in
parables." (Mark iv. 11.)

<span id="fn_130"></span>[64:2](mt41.htm#fr_130.md) It is the shadow of the
infinite in the finite. Superior energy is a ray from the *Name which
cannot be named;* inferior energy a ray from the *Tao which can be
expressed*. (Cp. ch. [1](mt04.htm#an_ch_01)..md) vid. *Chinese Buddhism*,
by Joseph Edkins, D.D., pp. 371-379.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[64:3](mt41.htm#fr_131.md) The old Roman
ideal—"*honestas*."

<span id="fn_132"></span>[64:4](mt41.htm#fr_132.md) Magnanimity represents
Energy in manifestation. Elsewhere the character here translated
"magnanimity" has been rendered "benevolence."

"Equity" stands for the first differentiation of manifested Energy.

"Propriety" represents a still further differentiation, e. g., when the
processes of evolution have separated the bird from the fish.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[64:5](mt41.htm#fr_133.md) Nothing is said about
the inferior qualities because the magnanimity, equity and propriety
mentioned in the text, being themselves but reflections, anything
inferior would be shadows of shadows.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[64:6](mt41.htm#fr_134.md) *Facilis descensus
Avernus*.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[64:7](mt41.htm#fr_135.md) Observe the difference
between Lao-tzu the Mystic, and Confucius the Moralist. Confucius taught
that Magnanimity and Equity were the essentials. Confucius made much of
Propriety. <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> Men, he said, would attain
perfection by pursuing these. Lao-tzu taught that these are but subtle
forms of selfishness, and therefore productive of evil, useless shells
when the life which they preserved has departed.

The whole chapter, says Dr. Paul Carus, "undoubtedly criticizes the
Confucian method of preaching ethical culture without taking into
consideration the religious emotions."—*Lao-tsze's Tao-teh-king*, p.
306.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[65:8](mt41.htm#fr_136.md) "To dwell in the wide
house of the world, to stand in the correct seat of the world, and to
walk in the great path of the world; when he obtains his desire for
office, to practice his principles for the good of the people; and when
that desire is disappointed, to practice them alone; to be above the
power of riches and honors to make dissipated, of poverty and mean
condition to make swerve from principle, and of power and force to make
bend—these characteristics constitute the great man."—*Mencius*.
(Legge's translation.)
