### CHAPTER II.

When every one in the world became conscious of the beauty of the
beautiful it turned to evil; they became conscious of the goodness of
the good and ceased to be good. <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9) Thus
not-being and being arise the one from the other. So also do the
difficult and the easy; the long and the short; the high and the low;
sounds and voices; the preceding and the following.

Therefore <span id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10) the Holy man abides by
non-attachment in his affairs, and practices a doctrine which cannot be
imparted by speech. He attends to everything in its turn and declines
nothing; produces without claiming; acts without dwelling thereon;
completes his purposes without resting in them. Inasmuch as he does this
he loses nothing. <span id="fr_11"></span>[3](#fn_11)

A lotus pond will serve as an illustration of the difference between the
holy sages and the younger members of the race. Covered with broad green
leaves and brilliant blooms, it irresistibly attracts child-souls. They
wade into the water, sink in the slime, and desperately struggle for the
fragile petals; but the sages, their elder brethren, remain quietly on
the bank,

always alert to aid any who require assistance, content to admire,
content to enjoy, without desiring to possess; yet actually owning the
flowers more truly than the struggling crowd in the slimy pond. We are
feeblest when we are grasping.

*"The Master said, 'Those who are without virtue, cannot abide long
either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of
enjoyment.'"—Confucian Analects.*

*"To dwell in the wide house of the world, to stand in the correct seat
of the world, and to walk in the great path of the world; when he
obtains his desire for office, to practice his principles for the good
of the people; and when that desire is disappointed, to practice them
alone; to be above the power of riches and honors to make dissipated, of
poverty and mean condition to make swerve from principle, and of power
and force to make bend—these characteristics constitute the great
man."—Mencius.*

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[3:1](mt05.htm#fr_9) Cf. *chap*.
[18](mt21.htm#an_ch_18) in loc.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[3:2](mt05.htm#fr_10) Because the antimonies in
the text are in the outer world of consciousness only, having no
existence in the inner world of spirit, the Sage makes no distinction.
All things are alike to him (cp. chap. [63](mt66.htm#an_ch_63)). Says
The Bhagavad Gita—''Thy business is with action only, never with its
fruits; so let not the fruit of thy action be thy motive, nor be thou to
inaction attached."

<span id="fn_11"></span>[3:3](mt05.htm#fr_11) "A pure, single, and
stable spirit is not distracted though it be employed in many works; for
that it doeth all to the honor of God, and being at rest within, seeketh
not itself in anything it doth."—*Of the Imitation of Christ* bk. 1, ch.
3.

"Balanced in pleasure and pain, self-reliant, to whom a lump of earth, a
rock and gold are alike; the same to loved and unloved, firm, the same
in censure and in praise, the same in honor and ignominy, the same to
friend and fee, abandoning all undertakings—he is said to have crossed
over the Gunas." *Bhagavad Gita*—xiv. 24, 25.
