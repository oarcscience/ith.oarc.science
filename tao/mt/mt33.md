### CHAPTER XXX.

When one uses the Tao in assisting his sovereign, he will not employ
arms to coerce the state. Such methods easily react. <span

Where military camps are established briers and thorns flourish. When
great armies have moved through the land calamities are sure to
follow. <span id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_118)

The capable are determined, but no more. They will not venture to
compel; determined, but not conceited; determined, but not boastful;
determined, but not arrogant; determined because it cannot be helped;
determined, but not forceful.

When things reach their prime, they begin to age. This cannot be said to
be the Tao. What is NOT the Tao soon ends. <span

<div style="font-size: 90%">

War is crude, unrefined cruelty; a creator of divisions, and an opponent
of the unity underlying creation; brute force and strategy are its
weapons, each a contradiction of the simplicity and purity of God; its
effects extend beyond the physical, and to those who have open ears
there come from the Unseen, echoes similar to the lament of the Great
Spirit in Hiawatha:

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">

"O my children! my poor children!  
 Listen to the words of wisdom,  
 From the lips of the Great Spirit,  
 From the Master of Life, who made you!"

"I am weary of your quarrels,  
 Weary of your wars and bloodshed, <span id="page_54">p. 54</span>  
 Weary of your prayers for vengeance,  
 Of your wranglings and divisions;  
 All your strength is in your union,  
 All your danger is in discord;  
 Therefore be at peace henceforward,  
 And as brothers live together."

</div>

Armies when contending seem to be the most commanding forces in the
universe, yet is their strength unequal to the Spiritual
Force—electricity.

</div>

<span id="fn_117"></span>[53:1](mt33.htm#fr_117) "With what measure ye
mete it shall be measured to you again."—*Luke*.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[53:2](mt33.htm#fr_118) Although the Tao Teh
King is now little read, so manifest is the Law of Retribution that this
sentence has become one of the commonest proverbs in the Chinese
colloquial.
