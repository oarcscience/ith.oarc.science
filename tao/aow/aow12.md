### IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS <span id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_249.md).

1\. Sun Tzŭ said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond
the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of
defeating the enemy.

2\. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the
opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy
himself. <span id="fr_251"></span>[2](#fn_250.md)

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span id="img_02700"></span> ![](img/02700.gif)

3\. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against
defeat, <span id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) but cannot make certain of
defeating the enemy. <span id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_252.md)

4: Hence the saying: One may *know* how to conquer without being able to
*do* it. <span id="fr_254"></span>[3](#fn_253.md)

5\. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat
the enemy means taking the offensive. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[4](#fn_254.md)

6\. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength:
attacking, a superabundance of strength.

7\. The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret
recesses of the earth; <span id="fr_256"></span>[5](#fn_255.md)

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

<span id="img_02800"></span> ![](img/02800.gif)

he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of
heaven. <span id="fr_257"></span>[1](#fn_256.md) Thus on the one hand we
have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is
complete. <span id="fr_258"></span>[2](#fn_257.md)

8\. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is
not the acme of excellence. <span id="fr_259"></span>[3](#fn_258.md)

9\. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and
the whole Empire says, "Well done!" <span
id="fr_260"></span>[4](#fn_259.md)

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span id="img_02900"></span> ![](img/02900.gif)

10\. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; <span
id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_260.md) to see sun and moon is no sign of sharp
sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear. <span
id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_261.md)

11\. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins,
but excels in winning with ease. <span id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_262.md)

12\. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor
credit for courage. <span id="fr_264"></span>[4](#fn_263.md)

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span id="img_03000"></span> ![](img/03000.gif)

13\. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. <span
id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_264.md) Making no mistakes is what establishes
the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is
already defeated. <span id="fr_266"></span>[2](#fn_265.md)

14\. Hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes
defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the
enemy. <span id="fr_267"></span>[3](#fn_266.md)

I5. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle
after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat
first fights and afterwards looks for victory. <span
id="fr_268"></span>[4](#fn_267.md)

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span id="img_03100"></span> ![](img/03100.gif)

16\. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly
adheres to method and discipline; <span id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_268.md)
thus it is in his power to control success.

17\. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement;
secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly,
Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.

18\. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to
Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances
to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances. <span
id="fr_270"></span>[2](#fn_269.md)

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

<span id="img_03200"></span> ![](img/03200.gif)

19\. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight
placed in the scale against a single grain. <span
id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_270.md)

20\. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up
waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. So much for tactical
dispositions. <span id="fr_272"></span>[2](#fn_271.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_249"></span>[26:1](aow12.htm#fr_250.md) \# is a very
comprehensive and somewhat vague term. Literally, "form," "body," it
comes to mean "appearance," "attitude" or "disposition;" and here it is
best taken as something between, or perhaps combining, "tactics" and
"disposition of troops." Ts‘ao Kung explains it as \# "marching and
countermarching on the part of the two armies with a view to discovering
each other's condition." Tu Mu says: "It is through the\# dispositions
of an army that its condition may be discovered. Conceal your
dispositions (\#), and your condition will remain secret, which leads to
victory; show your dispositions, and your condition will become patent,
which leads to defeat." Wang Hsi remarks that the good general can \#
"secure success by modifying his tactics to meet those of the enemy." In
the modern text, the title of the chapter appears as \#, which Capt.
Calthrop incorrectly translates "the order of battle."

<span id="fn_250"></span>[26:2](aow12.htm#fr_251.md) That is, of course, by
a mistake on his part. Capt. Calthrop has: "The causes of defeat come
from within; victory is born in the enemy's camp," which, though
certainly an improvement on his previous attempt, is still incorrect.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[27:1](aow12.htm#fr_252.md) "By concealing the
disposition of his troops, covering up his tracks, and taking
unremitting precautions" (Chang Yü).

<span id="fn_252"></span>[27:2](aow12.htm#fr_253.md) The original text
reads \#, which the modern text has further modified into \#. Capt.
Calthrop makes out the impossible meaning, "and further render the enemy
incapable of victory."

<span id="fn_253"></span>[27:3](aow12.htm#fr_254.md) Capt. Calthrop
translates: "The conditions necessary for victory may be present, but
they cannot always be obtained," which is more or less unintelligible.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[27:4](aow12.htm#fr_255.md) For \#, I retain the
sense which it undoubtedly bears in §§ 1–3, in spite of the fact that
the commentators are all against me. The meaning they give, "He who
cannot conquer takes the defensive," is plausible enough, but it is
highly improbable that \# should suddenly become active in this way. An
incorrect variant in the *Yü Lan* is \#.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[27:5](aow12.htm#fr_256.md) Literally, "hides
under the ninth earth," which is a metaphor indicating the utmost
secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy may not know <span
id="page_28">p. 28</span> his whereabouts. The \# of this passage have
of course no connection with the \# "Nine situations" of chap. XI.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[28:1](aow12.htm#fr_257.md) Another metaphor,
implying that he falls on his adversary like a thunderbolt, against
which there is no time to prepare. This is the opinion of most of the
commentators, though Ts‘ao Kung, followed by Tu Yu, explains \# as the
hills, rivers, and other natural features which will afford shelter or
protection to the attacked, and \# as the phases of weather which may be
turned to account by the attacking party. Capt. Calthrop's "The skilful
in attack push to the topmost heaven" conveys no meaning at all.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[28:2](aow12.htm#fr_258.md) Capt. Calthrop draws
on a fertile imagination for the following: "If these precepts be
observed, victory is certain."

<span id="fn_258"></span>[28:3](aow12.htm#fr_259.md) As Ts‘ao Kung remarks,
\# "the thing is to see the plant before it has germinated," to foresee
the event before the action has begun. Li Ch‘üan allude§ to the story of
Han Hsin who, when about to attack the vastly superior army of \# Chao,
which was strongly entrenched in the city of \# Ch‘êng-an, said to his
officers: "Gentlemen, we are going to annihilate the enemy, and shall
meet again at dinner." The officers hardly took his words seriously, and
gave a very dubious assent. But Han Hsin had already worked out in his
mind the details of a clever stratagem, whereby, as he foresaw, he was
able to capture the city and inflict a crushing defeat on his adversary.
For the full story, see \#, chap. 34, \#. Capt. Calthrop again blunders
badly with: "A victory, even if popularly proclaimed as such by the
common folk, may not be a true success."

<span id="fn_259"></span>[28:4](aow12.htm#fr_260.md) True excellence being,
as Tu Mu says: \# "To plan secretly, to move surreptitiously, <span
id="page_29">p. 29</span> to foil the enemy's intentions and baulk his
schemes, so that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of
blood." Sun Tzŭ reserves his approbation for things that

<div style="margin-left: 10%;">

   "the world's coarse thumb  
And finger fail to plumb."

</div>

<span id="fn_260"></span>[29:1](aow12.htm#fr_261.md) \# is explained as the
fur of a hare, which is finest in autumn, when it begins to grow afresh.
The phrase is a very common one in Chinese writers. Cf. Mencius, I. 1.
vii. 10, and Chuang Tzŭ, \#, *et al*.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[29:2](aow12.htm#fr_262.md) Ho Shih gives as real
instances of strength, sharp sight and quick hearing: \# Wu Huo, who
could lift a tripod weighing 250 stone; \# Li Chu, who at a distance of
a hundred paces could see objects no bigger than a mustard seed; and \#
Shih K‘uang, a blind musician who could hear the footsteps of a
mosquito.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[29:3](aow12.htm#fr_263.md) The original text,
followed by the *T‘u Shu*, has \#. But this is an alteration evidently
intended to smooth the awkwardness of \#, which means literally: "one
who, conquering, excels in easy conquering." Mei Yao-ch‘ên says: "He who
only sees the obvious, wins his battles with difficulty; he who looks
below the surface of things, wins with ease."

<span id="fn_263"></span>[29:4](aow12.htm#fr_264.md) Tu Mu explains this
very well: "Inasmuch as his victories are gained over circumstances that
have not come to light, the world at large knows nothing of them, and he
wins no reputation for wisdom; inasmuch as the hostile state submits
before there has been any bloodshed, he receives no credit for courage."

<span id="fn_264"></span>[30:1](aow12.htm#fr_265.md) Ch‘ên Hao says: "He
plans no superfluous marches, he devises no futile attacks." The
connection of ideas is thus explained by Chang Yü: "One who seeks to
conquer by sheer strength, clever though he may be at winning pitched
battles, is also liable on occasion to be vanquished whereas he who can
look into the future and discern conditions that are not yet manifest,
will never make a blunder and therefore invariably win." Li Ch‘üan
thinks that the character \# should be \# "to have doubts." But it is
better not to tamper with the text, especially when no improvement in
sense is the result.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[30:2](aow12.htm#fr_266.md) The *T‘u Shu* omits
\#. \# here = \#. Chia Lin says it is put for \# in the sense of \#; but
this is far-fetched. Capt. Calthrop altogether ignores the important
word, \#

<span id="fn_266"></span>[30:3](aow12.htm#fr_267.md) A \# "counsel of
perfection," as Tu Mu truly observes. \# need not be confined strictly
to the actual ground occupied by the troops. It includes all the
arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to increase
the safety of his army.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[30:4](aow12.htm#fr_268.md) Ho Shih thus expounds
the paradox: "In warfare, first lay plans which will ensure victory, and
then lead your army to battle; if you will not begin with stratagem but
rely on brute strength alone, victory will no longer be assured."

<span id="fn_268"></span>[31:1](aow12.htm#fr_269.md) For \# and \#, see
*supra*, I. 4 *sqq*. I think that Chang Yü is wrong in altering their
signification here, and taking them as \# and \# respectively.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[31:2](aow12.htm#fr_270.md) It is not easy to
distinguish the four terms \# very clearly. The first seems to be
surveying and measurement of the ground, which enable us to \# form an
estimate of the enemy's strength, and to \# make calculations based on
the data thus obtained; we are thus led to \# a general weighing-up, or
comparison of the enemy's chances with our own; if the latter turn the
scale, then \# victory ensues. The chief difficulty lies in \#, which
some commentators take as a calculation of *numbers*, thereby making it
nearly synonymous with \#. Perhaps \# is rather a consideration of the
enemy's general position or condition (\# or \#), while \# is the
estimate of his numerical strength. On the other hand, Tu Mu defines \#
as \#, and adds: \# "the question of relative strength having been
settled, we can bring the varied resources of cunning into play." Ho
Shih seconds this interpretation, which is weakened, however, by the
fact that \# is given as logically consequent on \#; this certainly
points to the latter being a calculation of numbers. Of Capt. Calthrop's
version the less said the better.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[32:1](aow12.htm#fr_271.md) Literally, "a
victorious army is like an \# *i* (20 oz.) weighed against a \# *shu*
(1/24 oz.); a routed army as a *shu* weighed against an *i*." The point
is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force, flushed with
victory, has over one demoralised by defeat. Legge, in his note on
Mencius, I. 2. ix. 2, makes the \# to be 24 Chinese ounces, and corrects
Chu Hsi's statement that it equalled 20 oz. only. But Li Ch‘üan of the
T‘ang dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[32:2](aow12.htm#fr_272.md) The construction here
is slightly awkward and elliptical, but the general sense is plain. The
*T‘u Shu* omits \#. A \# = 8 \# or Chinese feet.
