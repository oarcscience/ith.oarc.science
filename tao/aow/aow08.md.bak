#### BIBLIOGRAPHY.

The following are the oldest Chinese treatises on war, after Sun Tzŭ.
The notes on each have been drawn principally from the \# *Ssŭ k‘u
ch‘üan shu chien ming mu lu*, ch. 9, fol. 22 *sqq*.

1\. \# **Wu Tzŭ**, in 1 *chüan* or 6 \# chapters. By \# Wu Ch‘i (*d*.
B.C. 381). A genuine work. See *Shih Chi*, ch. 65.

2\. \# **Ssŭ-ma Fa**, in 1 *chüan* or 5 chapters. Wrongly attributed to
\# Ssŭ-ma Jang-chü of the 6th century B.C. Its date, however, must be
early, as the customs of the three ancient dynasties are constantly to
be met with in its pages. <span id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_157.md) See
*Shih Chi*, ch. 64.

The *Ssŭ K‘u Ch‘üan Shu* (ch. 99, f. 1) remarks that the oldest three
treatises on war, *Sun Tzŭ*, *Wu Tzŭ* and the *Ssŭ-ma Fa*, are,
generally speaking, only concerned with things strictly military—the art
of producing, collecting, training and drilling troops, and the correct
theory with regard to measures of expediency, laying plans, transport of
goods and the handling of soldiers <span
id="fr_159"></span>[2](#fn_158.md)—in strong contrast to later works, in
which the science of war is usually blended with metaphysics, divination
and magical arts in general.

3\. \# **Liu T‘ao**, in 6 *chüan* or 60 chapters. Attributed to \# Lü
Wang (or Lü \# Shang, also known as \# T‘ai Kung) of the 12<sup>th</sup>
century B.C. <span id="fr_160"></span>[3](#fn_159.md) But

<span id="page_li">p. li</span>

its style does not belong to the era of the Three Dynasties. <span
id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_160) \# Lu Tê-ming (550–625 A.D..md) mentions
the work, and enumerates the headings of the six sections, \#, \#, \#,
\#, \# and \#, so that the forgery cannot have been later than the Sui
dynasty.

4\. \# **Wei Liao Tzŭ**, in 5 *chüan*. Attributed Wei Liao
(4<sup>th</sup> cent. B.C.), who studied under the famous \# Kuei-ku
Tzŭ. The \#, under \#, mentions a book of Wei Liao in 31 chapters,
whereas the text we possess contains only 24. Its matter is sound enough
in the main, though the strategical devices differ considerably from
those of the Warring States period. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[2](#fn_161.md) It has been furnished with a commentary
by the well-known Sung philosopher \# Chang Tsai.

5\. \# **San Lüeh**, in 3 *chüan*. Attributed to \#, Huang-shih Kung, a
legendary personage who is said to have bestowed it on Chang Liang (*d*.
B.C. 187) in an interview on a bridge. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[3](#fn_162.md) But here again, the style is not that of
works dating from the Ch‘in or Han period. The Han Emperor Kuang Wu
\[A.D. 25–57\] apparently quotes from it in one of his proclamations;
but the passage in question may have been inserted later on, in order to
prove the genuineness of the work. We shall not be far out if we refer
it to the Northern Sung period \[420–478 A.D.\], or somewhat
earlier. <span id="fr_164"></span>[4](#fn_163.md)

<span id="page_lii">p. lii</span>

6\. \# **Li Wei Kung Wên Tui**, in 3 sections. Written in the form of a
dialogue between T‘ai Tsung and his great general \# Li Ching, it is
usually ascribed to the latter. Competent authorities consider it a
forgery, though the author was evidently well versed in the art of
war. <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_164.md)

7\. \# **Li Ching Ping Fa** (not to be confounded with the foregoing) is
a short treatise in 8 chapters, preserved in the *T‘ung Tien*, but not
published separately. This fact explains its omission from the *Ssŭ K‘u
Ch‘üan Shu*.

8\. \# **Wu Ch‘i Ching**, <span id="fr_166"></span>[2](#fn_165.md) in 1
*chüan*. Attributed to the legendary minister \# Fêng Hou, with
exegetical notes by \# Kung-sun Hung of the Han dynasty (*d*. B.C. 121),
and said to have been eulogised by the celebrated general, \# Ma Lung
(*d*. A.D. 300). Yet the earliest mention of it is in the \#. Although a
forgery, the work is well put together. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[3](#fn_166.md)

Considering the high popular estimation in which \# Chu-ko Liang has
always been held, it is not surprising to find more than one work on war
ascribed to his pen. Such are (1) the \# **Shih Liu Ts‘e** (1 *chüan*),
preserved in the \# *Yung Lo Ta Tien;* (2) \# **Chiang Yüan** (1 *ch*.);
and (3) \# **Hsin Shu** (I ch.), which steals wholesale from Sun Tzŭ.
None of these has the slightest claim to be considered genuine.

Most of the large Chinese encyclopaedias contain extensive sections
devoted to the literature of war. The following references may be found
useful:—

<div style="margin-left: 10%;">

\# **T‘ung Tien** (*circâ* 800 A.D.), ch. 148–162.

\# **T‘ai P‘ing Yü Lan** (983), ch. 270–359.

\# **Wên Hsien T‘ung K‘ao** (13<sup>th</sup> cent.), ch. 221.

\# **Yü Hai** (13<sup>th</sup> cent.), ch. 140, 141.

\# **San Ts‘ai T‘u Hui** (16<sup>th</sup> cent), \# ch. 7, 8.

\# **Kuang Po Wu Chih** (1607), ch. 31, 32.

\# **Ch‘ien Ch‘io Lei Shu** (1632), ch. 75.

\# **Yüan Chien Lei Han** (1710), ch. 206–229.

\# **Ku Chin T‘u Shu Chi Ch‘êng** (1726), section XXX, *esp*. ch. 81–90.

\# **Hsü Wên Hsien T‘ung K‘ao** (1784), ch. 121–134.

\# **Huang Ch‘ao Ching Shih Wên Pien** (1826), ch. 76, 77.

</div>

The bibliographical sections of certain historical works also deserve
mention:—

<div style="margin-left: 10%;">

\# ***Ch‘ien Han Shu***, ch. 30.

\# **Sui Shu**, ch. 32–35.

\# **Chiu T‘ang Shu**, ch. 46, 47.

\# **Sung Shih**, ch. 202–209.

\# **T‘ung Chih** (*circâ* 1150), ch. 68.

</div>

To these of course must be added the great Catalogue of the Imperial
Library:

<div style="margin-left: 10%;">

\# ***Ssŭ K‘u Ch‘üan Shu* Tsung Mu T‘i Yao** (1790), ch. 99, 100.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_157"></span>[l:1](aow08.htm#fr_158.md) \#.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[l:2](aow08.htm#fr_159.md) \#.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[l:3](aow08.htm#fr_160.md) See [p.
174](aow21.htm#page_174.md). Further details on T‘ai Kung will be found in
the *Shih Chi*, ch. 32 *ad init*. Besides the tradition which makes him
a former minister of Chou Hsin, two other accounts of him are there
given, according to which he would appear to have been first raised from
a humble private station by Wên Wang.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[li:1](aow08.htm#fr_161.md) \#.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[li:2](aow08.htm#fr_162.md) \#.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[li:3](aow08.htm#fr_163.md) See *Han Shu*, \#, ch.
40. The work is there called \#. Hence it has been confused with the
*Liu T‘ao*. The *T‘u Shu* attributes both the *Liu T‘ao* and the *San
Lüeh* to T‘ai Kung.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[li:4](aow08.htm#fr_164.md) \#. Another work said
to have been written by Huang-shih Kung, and also included in the
military section of the Imperial Catalogue, is the \# *Su Shu* in 1
*chüan*. A short ethical treatise of Taoist <span id="page_lii">p.
lii</span> savour, having no reference whatever to war, it is pronounced
a forgery from the hand of \# Chang Shang-ying (*d*. 1121), who edited
it with commentary. Correct Wylie's "Notes," new edition, p. 90, and
Courant's "Catalogue des Livres Chinois," no. 5056.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[lii:1](aow08.htm#fr_165.md) \#. We are told in
the \# that the above six works, together with Sun Tzŭ, were those
prescribed for military training in the \# period (1078–85). See \# *Yü
Hai*, ch. 140, f. 4 *r*°.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[lii:2](aow08.htm#fr_166.md) Also written \# and
\# *Wu Chi Ching*.
