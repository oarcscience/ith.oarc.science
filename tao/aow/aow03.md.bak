### INTRODUCTION

#### <span class="smallcaps">Sun Wu and his Book</span>.

Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzŭ: <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

\# Sun Tzŭ Wu was a native of the Ch‘i State. His *Art of War* brought
him to the notice of \# Ho Lu, <span id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md) King of
\# Wu. Ho Lu said to him: I have carefully perused your 13 chapters. May
I submit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight test?—Sun Tzŭ
replied: You may.—Ho Lu asked: May the test be applied to women?—The
answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements were made to bring
180 ladies out of the Palace. Sun Tzŭ divided them into two companies,
and placed one of the King's favourite concubines at the head of each.
He then bade them all take spears in their hands, and addressed them
thus: I presume you know the difference between front and back, right
hand and left hand?—The girls replied: Yes.—Sun Tzŭ went on: When I say
"Eyes front," you must look straight ahead. When I say "Left turn," you
must face towards your left hand. When I say "Right turn," you must face
towards your right hand. When I say "About turn," you must face right
round towards the back.—Again the girls assented. The words of command
having been thus explained, he set up the halberds and battle axes in
order to begin the drill. Then, to the sound of drums, he gave the order
"Right turn." But the girls only burst out laughing. Sun Tzŭ said: If
words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not
thoroughly understood, then the general is to blame.—So he started
drilling them again, and this time gave the order "Left turn," whereupon
the girls once more burst into fits of laughter. Sun Tzŭ said: If words
of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly
understood, the general is co blame. But if his orders are clear, and
the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their
officers.—So saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be
beheaded. Now the King of Wu was watching the

</div>

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

<div style="font-size: 90%">

scene from the top of a raised pavilion; and when he saw that his
favourite concubines were about to be executed, he was greatly alarmed
and hurriedly sent down the following message: We are now quite
satisfied as to our general's ability to handle troops. If We are bereft
of these two concubines, our meat and drink will lose their savour. It
is our wish that they shall not be beheaded.—Sun Tzŭ replied: Having
once received His Majesty's commission to be general of his forces,
there are certain commands of His Majesty which, acting in that
capacity, I am unable to accept.—Accordingly, he had the two leaders
beheaded, and straightway installed the pair next in order as leaders in
their place. When this had been done, the drum was sounded for the drill
once more; and the girls went through all the evolutions, turning to the
right or to the left, marching ahead or wheeling back, kneeling or
standing, with perfect accuracy and precision, not venturing to utter a
sound. Then Sun Tzŭ sent a messenger to the King saying: Your soldiers,
Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and ready for Your
Majesty's inspection. They can be put to any use that their sovereign
may desire; bid them go through fire and water, and they will not
disobey.—But the King replied: Let our general cease drilling and return
to camp. As for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the
troops.—Thereupon Sun Tzŭ said. The King is only fond of words, and
cannot translate them into deeds.—After that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzŭ was
one who knew how to handle an army, and finally appointed him general.
In the West, he defeated the Ch‘u State and forced his way into Ying,
the capital; to the north, he put fear into the States of Ch‘i and Chin,
and spread his fame abroad amongst the feudal princes. And Sun Tzŭ
shared in the might of the King.

</div>

About Sun Tzŭ himself this is all that Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien has to tell us in
this chapter. But he proceeds to give a biography of his descendant, \#
Sun Pin, born about a hundred years after his famous ancestor's death,
and also the outstanding military genius of his time. The historian
speaks of him too as Sun Tzŭ, and in his preface we read: \# "Sun Tzŭ
had his feet cut off and yet continued to discuss the art of war." <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) It seems likely, then, that "Pin" was a
nickname bestowed on him after his mutilation, unless indeed the story
was invented in order to account for the name. The crowning incident of
his career, the crushing defeat of his treacherous rival P‘ang Chüan,
will be found briefly related on p. 40.

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

To return to the elder Sun Tzŭ. He is mentioned in two other passages of
the *Shih Chi:*—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

In the third year of his reign \[512 B.C.\] Ho Lu, King of Wu, took the
field with \# Tzŭ-hsü \[*i.e.* \# Wu Yüan\] and \# Po P‘ei, and attacked
Ch‘u. He captured the town of \# Shu and slew the two prince's sons who
had formerly been generals of Wu. He was then meditating a descent on \#
Ying \[the capital\]; but the general Sun Wu said: "The army is
exhausted. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) It is not yet possible. We
must wait"… <span id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) \[After further successful
fighting,\] "in the ninth year \[506 B.C.\], King Ho Lu of Wu addressed
Wu Tzŭ-hsü and Sun Wu, saying: "Formerly, you declared that it was not
yet possible for us to enter Ying. Is the time ripe now?" The two men
replied: "Ch‘u's general, \# Tzŭ-ch‘ang, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_8.md) is grasping and covetous, and the princes of
\# T‘ang and Ts‘ai both have a grudge against him. If Your Majesty has
resolved to make a grand attack, you must win over Tang and Ts‘ai, and
then you may succeed." Ho Lu followed this advice, \[beat Ch‘u in five
pitched battles and marched into Ying\]. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[4](#fn_9.md)

</div>

This is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He does
not appear to have survived his patron, who died from the effects of a
wound in 496.

In the chapter entitled \# (the earlier portion of which M. Chavannes
believes to be a fragment of a treatise on Military Weapons), there
occurs this passage: <span id="fr_10"></span>[5](#fn_10.md)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

From this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the
other: \# Kao-fan, <span id="fr_11"></span>[6](#fn_11.md) who was employed
by the Chin State; Wang-tzŭ, <span id="fr_12"></span>[7](#fn_12.md) in the
service of Ch‘i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These men developed
and threw light upon the principles of war (\#).

</div>

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

It is obvious that Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien at least had no doubt about the reality
of Sun Wu as an historical personage; and with one exception, to be
noticed presently, he is by far the most important authority on the
period in question. It will not be necessary, therefore, to say much of
such a work as the \# *Wu Yüeh Ch‘un Ch‘iu*, which is supposed to have
been written by \# Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution is
somewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would be
of little value, based as it is on the *Shih Chi* and expanded with
romantic details. The story of Sun Tzŭ will be found, for what it is
worth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth noting are: 1) Sun
Tzŭ was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzŭ-hsü. 2) He is called a
native of Wu. <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13) 3.md) He had previously
lived a retired life, and his contemporaries were unaware of his
ability. <span id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14.md)

The following passage occurs in \# Huai-nan Tzŭ: "When sovereign and
ministers show perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzŭ
to encounter the foe." <span id="fr_15"></span>[3](#fn_15.md) Assuming that
this work is genuine (and hitherto no doubt has been cast upon it), we
have here the earliest direct reference, to Sun Tzŭ, for Huai-nan Tzŭ
died in 122 B.C., many years before the *Shih Chi* was given to the
world.

\# Liu Hsiang (B.C. 80–9) in his \# says: "The reason why Sun Wu at the
head of 30,000 men beat

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ch‘u with 200,000
is that the latter were undisciplined." <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md)

\# Têng Ming-shih in his \# (completed in 1134) informs us that the
surname was bestowed on Sun Wu's grandfather by \# Duke Ching of Ch‘i
\[547–490 B.C.\]. Sun Wu's father Sun \# Ping, rose to be a Minister of
State in Chi, and Sun Wu himself, whose style was \# Ch‘ang-ch‘ing, fled
to Wu on account of the rebellion which was being fomented by the
kindred of \# T‘ien Pao. He had three sons, of whom the second, named \#
Ming, was the father of Sun Pin. According to this account, then, Pin
was the grandson of Wu, <span id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17.md) which,
considering that Sun Pin's victory over in Wei was gained in 341 B.C.,
may be dismissed as chronologically impossible. Whence these data were
obtained by Têng Ming-shih I do not know, but of course no reliance
whatever can be placed in them.

An interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han
period is the short preface written by the great \# Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, or \#
Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun Tzŭ. I shall give it in full:—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

I have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their
advantage. <span id="fr_18"></span>[3](#fn_18.md) The *Lun Yü* says: "There
must be a sufficiency of military strength." <span
id="fr_19"></span>[4](#fn_19.md) The *Shu Ching* mention "the army" among
the "eight objects of government." <span id="fr_20"></span>[5](#fn_20.md)
The *I Ching* says: "\# 'army' indicates firmness and justice; the
experienced leader will have good fortune." <span
id="fr_21"></span>[6](#fn_21.md)

</div>

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Shih Ching* says: "The King rose majestic in his wrath, and he
marshalled his troops" <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) The Yellow
Emperor, Tang the Completer and Wu Wang all used spears and battle-axes
in order to succour their generation. The *Ssŭ-ma Fa* says: "If one man
slay another of set purpose, he himself may rightfully be slain." <span
id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md) He who relies solely on warlike measures
shall be exterminated; he who relies solely on peaceful measures shall
perish. Instances of this are Fu Ch‘ai <span
id="fr_24"></span>[3](#fn_24.md) on the one hand and Yen Wang <span
id="fr_25"></span>[4](#fn_25.md) on the other. In military matters, the
Sage's rule is normally to keep the peace, and to move his forces only
when occasion requires. He will not use armed force unless driven to it
by necessity. <span id="fr_26"></span>[5](#fn_26.md)

Many books have I read on the subject of war and fighting; but the work
composed by Sun Wu is the profoundest of them all. \[Sun Tzŭ was a
native of the Ch‘i state, his personal name was Wu. He wrote the *Art of
War* in 13 chapters for Ho Lü, King of Wu. Its principles were tested on
women, and he was subsequently made a general. He led an army westwards,
crushed the Ch‘u State and entered Ying the capital. In the north, he
kept Ch‘i and Chin in awe.. A hundred years and more after his time, Sun
Pin lived. He was a descendant of Wu\]. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[6](#fn_27.md) In his treatment of deliberation and
planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field, <span
id="fr_28"></span>[7](#fn_28.md) clearness of conception, and depth of
design, Sun

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Tzŭ stands beyond the reach of carping criticism. My contemporaries,
however, have failed to grasp the full meaning of his instructions, and
while putting into practice the smaller details in which his work
abounds, they have overlooked its essential purport. That is the motive
which has led me to outline a rough explanation of the whole.  <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md)

</div>

One thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the
13 chapters were specially composed for King Ho Lu. This is supported by
the internal evidence of I. § 15, in which it seems clear that some
ruler is addressed.

In the bibliographical section of the *Han Shu*, <span
id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30.md) there is an entry which has given rise to
much discussion: \# "The works of Sun Tzŭ of Wu in 82 *p‘ien* (or
chapters), with diagrams in 9 *chüan*." It is evident that this cannot
be merely the 13 chapters known to Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien, or those we possess
to-day. Chang Shou-chieh in his \# refers to an edition of Sun Tzŭ's \#
of which the "13 chapters" formed the first *chüan*, adding that there
were two other *chüan* besides. <span id="fr_31"></span>[3](#fn_31.md) This
has brought forth a theory, that the bulk of these 82 chapters consisted
of other writings of Sun Tzŭ—we should call them apocryphal—similar to
the \# *Wên Ta*, of which a specimen dealing with the Nine
Situations <span id="fr_32"></span>[4](#fn_32.md) is preserved in the \#
*T‘ung Tien*, and another in Ho Shih's commentary. It is suggested

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzŭ had only written the 13
chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of
question and answer between himself and the King. \# Pi I-hsün, author
of the \# *Sun Tzŭ Hsü Lu*, backs this up with a quotation from the *Wu
Yüeh Ch‘un Ch‘iu:* "The King of Wu summoned Sun Tzŭ, and asked him
questions about the art of war. Each time he set forth a chapter of his
work, the King could not find words enough to praise him." <span
id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) As he points out, if the whole work was
expounded on the same scale as in the above-mentioned fragments. the
total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md) Then the numerous other treatises
attributed to Sun Tzŭ <span id="fr_35"></span>[3](#fn_35.md) might also be
included. The fact that the *Han Chih* mentions no work of Sun Tzŭ
except the 82 *p‘ien*, whereas the Sui and T‘ang bibliographies give the
titles of others in addition to the "13 chapters," is good proof, Pi
I-hsün thinks, that all of these were contained in the 82 *p‘ien*.
Without pinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied by the *Wu
Yüeh Ch‘un Ch‘iu*, or admitting the genuineness of any of the treatises
cited by Pi I-hsün, we may see in this theory a probable solution of the
mystery. Between Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien and Pan Ku there was plenty of time for a
luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the magic name of Sun
Tzŭ, and the 82 *p‘ien* may very well represent a collected edition of
these lumped together with the original work.

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is also
possible, though less likely, that some of them existed in the time of
the earlier historian and were purposely ignored by him. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md)

Tu Mu, after Ts‘ao Kung the most important commentator on Sun Tzŭ,
composed the preface to his edition <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md)
about the middle of the ninth century. After a somewhat lengthy defence
of the military art, <span id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38.md) he comes at
last to Sun Tzŭ himself, and makes one or two very startling
assertions:—"The writings of Sun Wu," he says, "originally comprised
several hundred thousand words, but Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, the Emperor Wu Wei,
pruned away all redundancies and wrote out the essence of the whole, so
as to form a single book in 13 chapters." <span
id="fr_39"></span>[4](#fn_39.md) He goes on to remark that Ts‘ao Ts‘ao's
commentary on Sun Tzŭ leaves a certain proportion of difficulties
unexplained. This, in Tu Mu's opinion, does not necessarily imply that
he was unable to furnish a complete commentary. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[5](#fn_40.md) According to the *Wei Chih*, Ts‘ao himself
wrote a book on war in something over 100,000 words, known as the \# .
It appears to have been of such exceptional merit that he suspects Ts‘ao
to have used for it the surplus material which he had found in Sun Tzŭ.
He concludes, however, by saying: "The *Hsin Shu* is now lost, so that
the truth cannot be known for certain." <span
id="fr_41"></span>[6](#fn_41.md)

Tu Mu's conjecture seems to be based on a passage

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

in the \# "Wei Wu Ti strung together Sun Wu's Art of War," <span
id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) which in turn may have resulted from a
misunderstanding of the final words of Ts‘ao Kung's preface: \#. This,
as Sun Hsing-yen points out, <span id="fr_43"></span>[2](#fn_43.md) is only
a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, <span
id="fr_44"></span>[3](#fn_44.md) or in other words, wrote a commentary on
it. On the whole, the theory has met with very little acceptance. Thus,
the \# says: <span id="fr_45"></span>[4](#fn_45.md) "The mention of the 13
chapters in the *Shih Chi* shows that they were in existence before the
*Han Chih*, and that later accretions are not to be considered part of
the original work. Tu Mu's assertion can certainly not be taken as
proof." <span id="fr_46"></span>[5](#fn_46.md)

There is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in
the time of Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien practically as we have them now. That the work
was then well known he tells us in so many words: "Sun Tzŭ's 13 Chapters
and Wu Ch‘i's Art of War are the two books that people commonly refer to
on the subject of military matters. Both of then are widely distributed,
so I will not discuss them here." <span id="fr_47"></span>[6](#fn_47.md)
But as we go further back, serious difficulties begin to arise. The
salient fact which has to be faced is that the *Tso Chuan*, the great
contemporary record, makes no mention whatever of Sun

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wu, either as a
general or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward
circumstance, that many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story
of Sun Wu as given in the *Shih Chi*, but even show themselves frankly
sceptical as to the existence of the man at all. The most powerful
presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the following
disquisition by \# Yeh Shui-hsin: <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md)—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

It is stated in Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien's history that Sun Wu was a native of the
Ch‘i State, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lü he
crushed Ch‘u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso's
Commentary no Sun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso's Commentary
need not contain absolutely everything that other histories contain. But
Tso has not omitted to mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians
such as Ying K‘ao-shu, <span id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49.md) Ts‘ao
Kuei, <span id="fr_50"></span>[3](#fn_50.md) Chu Chih-wu <span
id="fr_51"></span>[4](#fn_51.md) and Chuan Shê-chu. <span
id="fr_52"></span>[5](#fn_52.md) In the case of Sun Wu, whose fame and
achievements were so brilliant, the omission is much more glaring.
Again, details are given, in their due order, about his contemporaries
Wu Yüan and the Minister Pei. <span id="fr_53"></span>[6](#fn_53.md) is it
credible that Sun Wu alone should have been passed over? <span
id="fr_54"></span>[7](#fn_54.md)

In point of literary style, Sun Tzŭ's work belongs to the same school as
*Kuan Tzŭ*, <span id="fr_55"></span>[8](#fn_55.md) the *Liu T‘ao*, <span
id="fr_56"></span>[9](#fn_56.md) and the Yüeh Yü, <span
id="fr_57"></span>[10](#fn_57.md) and may have

</div>

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

<div style="font-size: 90%">

been the production of some private scholar living towards the end of
the "Spring and Autumn" or the beginning of the "Warring States"
period. <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) The story that his precepts
were actually applied by the Wu State, is merely the outcome of big talk
on the part of his followers. <span id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59.md)

From the flourishing period of the Chou dynasty <span
id="fr_60"></span>[3](#fn_60.md) down to the time of the "Spring and
Autumn," all military commanders were statesmen as well, and the class
of professional generals, for conducting external campaigns, did not
then exist. It was not until the period of the "Six States" <span
id="fr_61"></span>[4](#fn_61.md) that this custom changed. Now although Wu
was an uncivilised State, is it conceivable that Tso should have left
unrecorded the fact that Sun Wu was a great general and yet held no
civil office? What we are told, therefore, about Jang-chü <span
id="fr_62"></span>[5](#fn_62.md) and Sun Wu, is not authentic matter, but
the reckless fabrication of theorising pundits. The story of Ho Lü's
experiment on the women, in particular, is utterly preposterous and
incredible. <span id="fr_63"></span>[6](#fn_63.md)

</div>

Yeh Shui-hsin represents Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien as having said that Sun Wu
crushed Ch‘u and entered Ying. This is not quite correct. No doubt the
impression left on the reader's mind is that he at least shared in these
exploits; but the actual subject of the verbs \#, \#, \# and \# is
certainly \#, as is shown by the next words: \#. <span
id="fr_64"></span>[7](#fn_64.md) The fact may or may not be significant;
but it is nowhere explicitly stated in the *Shih Chi* either that Sun
Tzŭ was general on the occasion of

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

the taking of Ying, or that he even went there at all. Moreover, as we
know that Wu Yüan and Po P‘ei both took part in the expedition, and also
that its success was largely due to the dash and enterprise of \# Fu
Kai, Ho Lu's younger brother, it is not easy to see how yet another
general could have played a very prominent part in the same campaign.

\# Ch‘ên Chên-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note: <span
id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md)—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Military writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art. But the
fact that he does not appear in the *Tso Chuan*, although he is said to
have served under Ho Lü King of Wu, makes it uncertain what period he
really belonged to. <span id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_66.md)

</div>

He also says:—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The works of Sun Wu and Wu Ch‘i may be of genuine antiquity.  <span
id="fr_67"></span>[3](#fn_67.md)

</div>

It is noticeable that both Yeh Shui-hsin and Ch‘ên Chên-sun, while
rejecting the personality of Sun Wu as he figures in Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien's
history, are inclined to accept the date traditionally assigned to the
work which passes under his name, The author of the *Hsü Lu* fails to
appreciate this distinction, and consequently his bitter attack on Ch‘ên
Chên-sun really misses its mark. He makes one or two points, however,
which certainly tell in favour of the high antiquity of our "13
chapters." "Sun Tzŭ," he says, "must have lived in the age of Ching Wang
\[519–476\], because he is frequently plagiarised in subsequent works of
the Chou, Ch‘in and Han dynasties." <span id="fr_68"></span>[4](#fn_68.md)

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The two most
shameless offenders in this respect are Wu Ch‘i and Huai-nan Tzŭ, both
of them important historical personages in their day. The former lived
only a century after the alleged date of Sun Tzŭ, and his death is known
to have taken place in 381 B.C. It was to him, according to Liu Hsiang,
that \# Tsêng Shên delivered the *Tso Chuan*, which had been entrusted
to him by its author. <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md) Now the fact
that quotations from the *Art of War*, acknowledged or otherwise, are to
be found in so many authors of different epochs, establishes a very
strong probability that there was some common source anterior to them
all,—in other words, that Sun Tzŭ's treatise was already in existence
towards the end of the 5th century B.C. Further proof of Sun Tzŭ's
antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings
attaching to a number of the words he uses. A list of these, which might
perhaps be extended, is given in the *Hsü Lu;* and though some of the
interpretations are doubtful, the main argument is hardly affected
thereby. <span id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70.md) Again, it must not be
forgotten that Yeh Shui-hsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank,
deliberately pronounces the style of the 13 chapters to

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

belong to the early part of the fifth century. Seeing that he is
actually engaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of Sun Wu
himself, we may be sure that he would not have hesitated to assign the
work to a later date had he not honestly believed the contrary. And it
is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an educated Chinaman
will carry most weight. Other internal evidence is not far to seek.
Thus, in XIII. § 1, there is an unmistakable allusion to the ancient
system of land-tenure which had [already](errata.htm#0.md) passed away by
the time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in a modified
form. <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) The only warfare Sun Tzŭ knows
is that carried on between the various feudal princes (\#), in which
armoured chariots play a large part. Their use seems to have entirely
died out before the end of the Chou dynasty. He speaks as a man of Wu, a
state which ceased to exist as early as 473 B.C. On this I shall touch
presently.

But once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier, and the chances
of its being other than a *bonâ fide* production are sensibly
diminished. The great age of forgeries did not come until long after.
That it should have been forged in the period immediately following 473
is particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to identify
himself with a lost cause. As for Yeh Shui-hsin's theory, that the
author was a literary recluse, <span id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_72.md) that
seems to me quite untenable. If one thing is more apparent than another
after reading the maxims of Sun Tzŭ, it is that their essence has been
distilled from a large store of personal observation and experience.
They reflect the mind not only of a born strategist, gifted with a rare
faculty of generalisation, but also of a practical soldier closely
acquainted with the military conditions of his time. To say nothing

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

of the fact that these sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all
the greatest captains of Chinese history, they offer a combination of
freshness and sincerity, acuteness and common sense, which quite
excludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in the study. If
we admit, then, that the 13 chapters were the genuine production of a
military man living towards the end of the "Ch‘un Ch‘iu" period, are we
not bound, in spite of the silence of the *Tso Chuan*, to accept Ssŭ-ma
Ch‘ien's account in its entirety? In view of his high repute as a sober
historian, must we not hesitate to assume that the records he drew upon
for Sun Wu's biography were false and untrustworthy? The answer, I fear,
must be in the negative. There is still one grave, if not fatal,
objection to the chronology involved in the story as told in the *Shih
Chi*, which, so far as I am aware, nobody has yet pointed out. There are
two passages in Sun Tzŭ in which he alludes to contemporary affairs. The
first is in VI. § 21:—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yüeh exceed our own in
number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I
say then that victory can be achieved.

</div>

The other is in XI. § 30:—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Asked if an army can be made to imitate the *shuai-jan*, I should
answer, Yes, For the men of Wu and the men of Yüeh are enemies; yet if
they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm,
they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps
the right.

</div>

These two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of
composition. They assign the work to the period of the struggle between
Wu and Yüeh. So much has been observed by Pi I-hsün. But what has
hitherto escaped notice is that they also seriously impair the
credibility of Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien's narrative. As we have seen above, the
first positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is
then spoken of as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu, so
that his alleged introduction to that monarch had already taken place,

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

and of course the 13 chapters must have been written earlier still. But
at that time, and for several years after, down to the capture of Ying
in 506, \# Ch‘u, and not Yüeh, was the great hereditary enemy of Wu. The
two states, Ch‘u and Wu, had been constantly at war for over half a
century, <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md) whereas the first war
between Wu and Yüeh was waged only in 510, <span
id="fr_74"></span>[2](#fn_74.md) and even then was no more than a short
interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch‘u. Now
Ch‘u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference
is that they were written at a time when Yüeh had become the prime
antagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch‘u had suffered the great humiliation
of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found useful.

The sentence quoted above from VI. § 21 hardly strikes me as one that
could have been written in the full flush of victory. It seems rather to
imply that, for the moment at least, the tide had turned against Wu, and
that she was getting the worst of the struggle. Hence we may conclude
that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which date Yüeh
does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu
died in 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been
during the period 505–496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu
having presumably been exhausted by its supreme effort against Ch‘u. On
the other hand, if we choose to disregard the tradition connecting Sun
Wu's name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the light between
496 and 494, or possibly in the period 482–473, when Yüeh was once again
becoming a very serious menace. <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md) We
may feel fairly certain that the author, whoever he may have been, was
not a man of any great eminence in his own day. On this point the
negative testimony of the *Tso Chuan* far outweighs any shred of
authority still attaching to the *Shih Chi*, if once its other facts are
discredited. Sun Hsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to explain
the omission of his name from

<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span>

the great commentary. It was Wu Tzŭ-hsü, he says, who got all the credit
of Sun Wu's exploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not
rewarded with an office in the State. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md)

How then did the Sun Tzŭ legend originate? It may be that the growing
celebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to
its author. It was felt to be only right and proper that one so well
versed in the science of war should have solid achievements to his
credit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the greatest
feat of arms in Ho Lu's reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on
all the surrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of
her power. Hence, what more natural, as time went on, than that the
acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu, should be popularly identified
with that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that his brain
conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out
by him in conjunction with Wu Yüan, <span id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77.md)
Po P‘ei and Fu Kai?

It is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of Sun
Tzŭ's life must be based almost wholly on conjecture. With this
necessary proviso, I should say that he probably entered the service of
Wu about the time of Ho Lu's accession, and gathered experience, though
only in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense
military activity which marked the first half of that prince's
reign. <span id="fr_78"></span>[3](#fn_78.md) If he rose to be a general at
all, he certainly was never on an equal footing with the three

<span id="page_xxx">p. xxx</span>

above mentioned. He was doubtless present at the investment and
occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu's sudden collapse in the following
year. Yüeh's attack at this critical juncture, when her rival was
embarrassed on every side, seems to have convinced him that this upstart
kingdom was the great enemy against whom every effort would henceforth
have to be directed. Sun Wu was thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat
down to write his famous book, which according to my reckoning must have
appeared towards the end, rather than the beginning, of Ho Lu's reign.
The story of the women may possibly have grown out of some real incident
occurring about the same time. As we hear no more of Sun Wu after this
from any source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron or to
have taken part in the death-struggle with Yüeh, which began with the
disaster at Tsui-li.

If these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony
in the fate which decreed that China's most illustrious man of peace
should be contemporary with her greatest writer on war.
