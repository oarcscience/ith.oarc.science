### PREFACE

The seventh volume of "Memoires concernant l’histoire, les sciences, les
arts, les mœurs, les usages, &c., des Chinois" <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) is devoted to the Art of War, and contains,
amongst other treatises, "Les Treize Articles de Sun-tse," translated
from the Chinese by a Jesuit Father, Joseph Amiot. Père Amiot appears to
have enjoyed no small reputation as a sinologue in his day, and the
field of his labours was certainly extensive. But his so-called
translation of Sun Tzŭ, if placed side by side with the original, is
seen at once to be little better than an imposture. It contains a great
deal that Sun Tzŭ did not write, and very little indeed of what he did.
Here is a fair specimen, taken from the opening sentences of chapter 5:—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

*De l’habileté dans le gouvernement des Troupes*. Sun-tse dit: Ayez les
noms de tous les Officiers tant généraux que subalternes; inscrivez-les
dans un catalogue à part, avec la note des talents & de la capacité de
chacun d’eux, afin de pouvoir les employer avec avantage lorsque
l’occasion en sera venue. Faites en sorte que tous ceux que vous devez
commander soient persuadés que votre principale attention est de les
préserver de tout dommage. Les troupes que vous ferez avancer contre
l’ennemi doivent être comme des pierres que vous lanceriez contre des
œufs. De vous à l’ennemi il ne doit y avoir d’autre différence que celle
du fort au foible, du vuide au plein. Attaquez à découvert, mais soyez
vainqueur en secret. Voilà en peu de mots en quoi consiste l’habileté &
toute la perfection même du gouvernement des troupes.

</div>

Throughout the nineteenth century, which saw a wonderful development in
the study of Chinese literature, no translator ventured to tackle Sun
Tzŭ, although his work was known to be highly valued in China as by far
the

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

oldest and best compendium of military science. It was not until the
year 1905 that the first English translation, by Capt. E. F. Calthrop,
R.F.A., appeared at Tokyo under the title "Sonshi" (the Japanese form of
Sun Tzŭ). <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) Unfortunately, it was
evident that the translator's knowledge of Chinese was far too scanty to
fit him to grapple with the manifold difficulties of Sun Tzŭ. He himself
plainly acknowledges that without the aid of two Japanese gentlemen "the
accompanying translation would have been impossible." We can only
wonder, then, that with their help it should have been so excessively
bad. It is not merely a question of downright blunders, from which none
can hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard passages
were wilfully distorted or slurred over. Such offences are less
pardonable. They would not be tolerated in any edition of a Greek or
Latin classic, and a similar standard of honesty ought to be insisted
upon in translations from Chinese.

From blemishes of this nature, at least, I believe that the present
translation is free. It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate
of my own powers; but I could not help feeling that Sun Tzŭ deserved a
better fate than had befallen him, and I knew that, at any rate, I could
hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors. Towards the end
of 1908, a new and revised edition of Capt. Calthrop's translation was
published in London, this time however, without any allusion to his
Japanese collaborators. My first three chapters were then already in the
printer's hands, so that the criticisms of Capt. Calthrop therein
contained must be understood as referring to his earlier edition. In the
subsequent chapters I have of course transferred my attention to the
second edition. This is on the whole an improvement on the other, though
there still remains much that cannot pass

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

muster. Some of the grosser blunders have been rectified and lacunae
filled up, but on the other hand a certain number of new mistakes
appear. The very first sentence of the introduction is startlingly
inaccurate; and later on, while mention is made of "an army of Japanese
commentators" on Sun Tzŭ (who are these, by the way?), not a word is
vouchsafed about the Chinese commentators, who nevertheless, I venture
to assert, form a much more numerous and infinitely more important
"army."

A few special features of the present volume may now be noticed. In the
first place, the text has been cut up into numbered paragraphs, both in
order to facilitate cross-reference and for the convenience of students
generally. The division follows broadly that of Sun Hsing-yen's edition;
but I have sometimes found it desirable to join two or more of his
paragraphs into one. In quoting from other works, Chinese writers seldom
give more than the bare title by way of reference, and the task of
research is apt to be seriously hampered in consequence. With a view to
obviating this difficulty so far as Sun Tzŭ is concerned, I have also
appended a complete concordance of Chinese characters, following in this
the admirable example of Legge, though an alphabetical arrangement has
been preferred to the distribution under radicals which he adopted.
Another feature borrowed from "The Chinese Classics" is the printing of
text, translation and notes on the same page; the notes, however, are
inserted, according to the Chinese method, immediately after the
passages to which they refer. From the mass of native commentary my aim
has been to extract the cream only, adding the Chinese text here and
there when it seemed to present points of literary interest. Though
constituting in itself an important branch of Chinese literature, very
little commentary of this kind has hitherto been made directly
accessible by translation. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

I may say in conclusion that, owing to the printing off of my sheets as
they were completed, the work has not had the benefit of a final
revision. On a review of the whole, without modifying the substance of
my criticisms, I might have been inclined in a few instances to temper
their asperity. Having chosen to wield a bludgeon, however, I shall not
cry out if in return I am visited with more than a rap over the
knuckles. Indeed, I have been at some pains to put a sword into the
hands of future opponents by scrupulously giving either text or
reference for every passage translated. A scathing review, even from the
pen of the Shanghai critic who despises "mere translations," would not,
I must confess, be altogether unwelcome. For, after all, the worst fate
I shall have to dread is that which befel the ingenious paradoxes of
George in *The Vicar of Wakefield*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[vii:1](aow02.htm#fr_0.md) Published at Paris in
1782.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[viii:1](aow02.htm#fr_1.md) A rather distressing
Japanese flavour pervades the work throughout. Thus, King Ho Lu
masquerades as "Katsuryo," Wu and Yüeh become "Go" and "Etsu," etc. etc.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[ix:1](aow02.htm#fr_2.md) A notable exception is to
be found in Biot's edition of the *Chou Li*.
