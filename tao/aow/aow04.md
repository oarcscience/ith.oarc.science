#### <span class="smallcaps">The Text of Sun Tzŭ</span>.

I have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzŭ's
text. The quotations that occur in early authors go to show that the "13
chapters" of which Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien speaks were essentially the same as
those now extant. We have his word for it that they were widely
circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from
discussing them on that account. <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md) Sun
Hsing-yen says in his preface:—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

During the Ch‘in and Han dynasties Sun Tzŭ's *Art of War* was in general
use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated it as a
work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for

</div>

<span id="page_xxxi">p. xxxi</span>

<div style="font-size: 90%">

the benefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first
to write a commentary on it. <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md)

</div>

As we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that
Ts‘ao Kung tampered with the text. But the text itself is often so
obscure, and the number of editions which appeared from that time onward
so great, especially during the Tang and Sung dynasties, that it would
be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed to creep in.
Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief
commentaries on Sun Tzŭ were in existence, a certain \# Chi T‘ien-pao
published a work in 15 *chüan* entitled \# "Sun Tzŭ with the collected
commentaries of ten writers." <span id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_81.md) There
was another text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of \#
Ta-hsing, <span id="fr_82"></span>[3](#fn_82.md) which also had supporters
among the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun
Hsing-yen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no
longer put into circulation. <span id="fr_83"></span>[4](#fn_83.md) Thus,
until the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, the text in sole
possession of the field was one derived from Chi T‘ien-pao's edition,
although no actual copy of that important work was known to have
[survived](errata.htm#1.md). That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzŭ which
appears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopaedia printed
in 1726, the \# *Ku Chin T‘u Shu Chi Ch‘êng*. Another copy at my
disposal of what is practically the same text, with slight variations,
is that contained in the \# "Eleven philosophers of the Chou and Ch‘in
dynasties"

<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[1758\]. And the
Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop's first edition is evidently a similar
version which has filtered through Japanese channels. So things remained
until \# Sun Hsing-yen \[1752–1818\], a distinguished antiquarian and
classical scholar, <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md) who claimed to be
an actual descendant of Sun Wu, <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_85.md)
accidentally discovered a copy of Chi T‘ien-pao's long-lost work, when
on a visit to the library of the \# Hua-yin temple. <span
id="fr_86"></span>[3](#fn_86.md) Appended to it was the \# *I Shuo* of \#
Chêng Yu-hsien, mentioned in the *T‘ung Chih*, and also believed to have
perished. <span id="fr_87"></span>[4](#fn_87.md) This is what Sun Hsing-yen
designates as the \# or \# "original edition (or text)"—a rather
misleading name, for it cannot by any means claim to set before us the
text of Sun Tzŭ in its pristine purity. Chi T‘ien-pao was a careless
compiler, <span id="fr_88"></span>[5](#fn_88.md) and appears to have been
content to reproduce the somewhat debased version current in his day,
without troubling to collate it

<span id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span>

with the earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of
Sun Tzŭ, even older than the newly discovered work, were still extant,
one buried in the *T‘ung Tien*, Tu Yu's great treatise on the
Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the *T‘ai Ping Yü Lan*
encyclopaedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though split up
into fragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal
over a number of different sections. Considering that the *Yü Lan* takes
us back to the year 983, and the *T‘ung Tien* about 200 years further
still, to the middle of the T‘ang dynasty, the value of these early
transcripts of Sun Tzŭ can hardly be overestimated. Yet the idea of
utilising them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until Sun
Hsing-yen, acting under Government instructions, undertook a thorough
recension of the text. This is his own account:—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Because of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzŭ which his
editors had handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient edition
\[of Chi T‘ien-pao\] should be used, and that the text should be revised
and corrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the Governor Pi
Kua, and Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all devoted
themselves to this study, probably surpassing me therein. Accordingly, I
have had the whole work cut on blocks as a text-book for military
men. <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md)

</div>

The three individuals here referred to had evidently been occupied on
the text of Sun Tzŭ prior to Sun Hsing-yen's commission, but we are left
in doubt as to the work they really accomplished. At any rate, the new
edition, when ultimately produced, appeared in the names of Sun
Hsing-yen and only one co-editor, \# Wu Jên-chi. They took the "original
text" as their basis, and by careful comparison with the older versions,
as well as the extant commentaries and other sources of information such
as

<span id="page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv</span>

the *I Shuo*, succeeded in restoring a very large number of doubtful
passages, and turned out, on the whole, what must be accepted as the
closest approximation we are ever likely to get to Sun Tzŭ's original
work. This is what will hereafter be denominated the "standard text."

The copy which I have used belongs to a re-issue dated 1877. It is in 6
*pên*, forming part of a well-printed set of 23 early philosophical
works in 83 *pên*. <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) It opens with a
preface by Sun Hsing-yen (largely quoted in this introduction),
vindicating the traditional view of Sun Tzŭ's life and performances, and
summing up in remarkably concise fashion the evidence in its favour.
This is followed by Ts‘ao Kung's preface to his edition, and the
biography of Sun Tzŭ from the *Shih Chi*, both translated above. Then
come, firstly, Chêng Yu-hsien's *I Shuo*, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_91.md) with author's preface, and next, a short
miscellany of historical and bibliographical information entitled \#
*Sun Tzŭ Hsü Lu*, compiled by \# Pi I-hsün. As regards the body of the
work, each separate sentence is followed by a note on the text, if
required, and then by the various commentaries appertaining to it,
arranged in chronological order. These we shall now proceed to discuss
briefly, one by one.

miles from \# T‘ung-kuan on the eastern border of Shensi. The temple in
question is still visited by those about to make the ascent of the \# or
Western Sacred Mountain. It is mentioned in the \# \[A.D. 1461\], ch.
32, f. 22, as the \# "Situated five *li* east of the district city of
Hua-yin. The temple contains the Hua-shan tablet inscribed by the T‘ang
Emperor Hsüan Tsung \[713–755\]."
