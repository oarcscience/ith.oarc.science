### THE STORM DRAGON.

<span id="12400.jpg">![](img/12400.jpg)</span>

Shen of Tai-Ts'ang was wealthy, but a brutal and inhumane man who
treated his fellow-citizens shamefully, and especially exhibited his bad
character in damaging their instruments and machines, or any utensils
which were used by workers in tilling the soil, manufacturing, fishing,
hunting, and other occupations of life.

Once when he was building a guest hall in his house, he hired Liu of a
neighboring village, well known as a skilled sculptor, to carve some
figures on pillars and beams; but when the artist had finished his work
Shen refused to pay him the stipulated sum. The sculptor remonstrated
and the dispute was finally settled by a lawsuit against Shen, who for
this reason began to scheme for revenge.

Some time later, the Buddhist Priests in a southern metropolis intended
to have the statues of five hundred Arhats carved for their temple, and
having heard of Liu's fame, invited him to compete for the task. Shen
thought his opportunity had come. So he hired a man to join Liu's party.
While on the way, this villain,

{p. 125}

following the instructions of Shen, spoiled the instruments of the
sculptor and absconded without being discovered. When Liu on his arrival
could use none of his tools he was unable to compete with the native
sculptors, whereby he lost his employment and became quite destitute.

Since Shen continued in his evil practices, his daughter-in-law warned
him that unless he reformed, heaven would certainly visit the family
with misfortune; but Shen resented her words and drove her from his home
charging her with impudence, and disobedience. Before she was more than
a mile or so away from the house, there came a sudden terrific outburst
of thunder and lightning, and she hid herself in the woods near by. Then
she saw a scarlet dragon come out of the black clouds and enter Shen's
residence. The building was completely wrecked, everything inside
destroyed and every living thing instantly killed. No member of the
family escaped, except the daughter-in-law who had been driven out.
Heaven favored her and she lived a long and prosperous life.

\[Our illustration exhibits the typical Chinese conception of thunder
and lightning. The thunder demon holds a mallet in either hand and is
surrounded by a circle of drums and flames. Lightning is represented as
a woman from whose hands flow streams of flame.

{p. 126}

The scarlet dragon is the storm sweeping over the country leaving
destruction in its wake.\]
