### (Conclusion.)

Therefore, blessed is the man who speaketh what is good, who thinketh
what is good, who practiceth what is good. If but each single day he
would persevere in these three ways of goodness,<sup>\[65\]</sup> within
three years Heaven will surely shower on him blessings. (1231-1251)

Unfortunate is the man who speaketh what is evil, who thinketh what is
evil, who practiceth what is evil. If but each single day he would
persevere in these three ways of evildoing, within three years Heaven
will surely shower on him curses. (1252-1271)

Why shall we not be diligent and comply with this? (1272-1277)
