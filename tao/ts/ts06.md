### (Blessings of the Good.)

Those who are thus, are good: people honor them; Heaven's
Reason<sup>\[24\]</sup> gives them grace<sup>\[25\]</sup>; blessings and
abundance follow them; all ill luck keeps away<sup>\[26\]</sup>; angel
spirits guard them. What

{p. 54}

ever they undertake will surely succeed, and even to spiritual
saintliness<sup>\[27\]</sup> they may aspire. (263-294)

Those who wish to attain heavenly saintliness, should perform one
thousand three hundred good deeds, and those who wish to attain to
earthly saintliness should perform three hundred good deeds. (295-316)
