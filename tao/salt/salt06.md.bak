### THE DOCTRINE OF INACTION

THE Sage occupies himself with inaction, and conveys instruction without
words. Is it not by neglecting self-interest that one will be able to
achieve it?

Purge yourself of your profound intelligence, and you can still be free
from blemish. Cherish the people and order the kingdom, and you can
still do without meddlesome action.

Who is there that can make muddy water clear? But if allowed to remain
still, it will gradually become clear of itself. Who is there that can
secure a state of absolute repose? But let time go on, and the state of
repose will gradually arise.

Be sparing of speech, and things will come right of themselves.

A violent wind does not outlast the morning; a squall of rain does not
outlast the day. Such is the course of Nature. And if Nature herself
cannot sustain her efforts long, how much less can man!

Attain complete vacuity, and sedulously preserve a state of repose.

Tao is eternally inactive, and yet it leaves nothing undone. If kings
and princes could but hold fast to this principle, all things would work

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

out their own reformation. If, having reformed, they still desired to
act, I would have them restrained by the simplicity of the Nameless Tao.
The simplicity of the Nameless Tao brings about an absence of desire.
The absence of desire gives tranquillity. And thus the Empire will
rectify itself.

The softest things in the world override the hardest. That which has no
substance enters where there is no crevice. Hence I know the advantage
of inaction.

Conveying lessons without words, reaping profit without action,--there
are few in the world who can attain to this!

Activity conquers cold, but stillness conquers heat. Purity and
stillness are the correct principles for mankind.

Without going out of doors one may know the whole world; without looking
out of the window, one may see the Way of Heaven. The further one
travels, the less one may know. Thus it is that without moving you shall
know; without looking you shall see; without doing you shall achieve.

The pursuit of book-learning brings about daily increase. The practice
of Tao brings about daily loss. Repeat this loss again and again, and
you arrive at inaction. Practise inaction, and there is nothing which
cannot be done.

The Empire has ever been won by letting things take their course. He who
must always be doing is unfit to obtain the Empire.

Keep the mouth shut, close the gateways of sense, and as long as you
live you will have no trouble. Open your lips and push your affairs,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

and you will not be safe to the end of your days.

Practise inaction, occupy yourself with doing nothing.

Desire not to desire, and you will not value things difficult to obtain.
Learn not to learn, and

you will revert to a condition which mankind in general has lost.

Leave all things to take their natural course, and do not interfere.
