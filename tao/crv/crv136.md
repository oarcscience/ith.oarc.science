### CHAPTER 80.

Lao-tze is not in favor of progress. He is bent on preaching that the
Tao can be actualized in primitive conditions as well as, if not more
easily than, in a highly complicated state of civilization. His ideal is
not the luxury of wealth and power and learnedness, but the simple life
of simple-minded people. He may even be accused of reactionary
tendencies, for he is ready to abandon the

advance made by his predecessors up to his own time and give up the
practice of writing on bamboo slips, in favor of the prehistoric mode of
keeping memoranda by knotted cords (*chieh shin*g), or as they are now
called with an American name, *quipu*, a method of assisting the memory
by threads of various dyes knotted in special ways.

Lao-tze will scarcely find followers for his proposal to revert to
primitive conditions, but even here where he is mistaken, there is a
truth at the bottom of his thought. It is the ideal of a simple life, so
much preached and so little practised in our days. Progress not only
brings new inventions but also loosens the old ideals of simplicity,
purity, honesty and faith. In place of the restful contentedness of
former ages, the new generation is filled with desires. People have
become reckless, arrogant, and luxurious. Learnedness takes the place of
wisdom, and a pretentious display of filial piety supplants spontaneous
respect for parents.
