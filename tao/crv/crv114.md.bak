### CHAPTER 38.

Justice is different from virtue and benevolence. It is the nature of
justice to act and enforce its pretensions.

True or superior virtue is here called "unvirtue" because it does not
make a

show of virtue; it does not "act virtue." A difference between virtue
and justice is that justice doling out punishments must make a show of
its power, and so "acts and makes pretensions." It is obvious that here
the Confucian conception of virtue is criticised for the reason that it
is always in evidence and is therefore inferior,--it is shoddy.

Traditionalism (*ts’ien shih*, "of times bygone the knowledge") which is
mentioned further on in this chapter is a characteristic feature of
Confucian ethics.

In former editions I took *ts’ien* in the sense of "early" or
"premature" and translated "quickwittedness"; but we must bear in mind
that we have before us a criticism of Confucian ethics with its rules of
propriety based upon a reverence for the past, clinging tenaciously to
tradition. Lao-tze says that this respect for bygone times, this
traditionalism is not commendable. It is but "the flower of reason,"
meaning thereby that it makes a display or show of virtue;

it parades morality but it does not contain the fruit.
