1\. "Favor bodes disgrace; it is like trembling.  
Rank bodes great heartache. It is like the body."

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

2\. What means "Favor bodes disgrace; it is like trembling?"

Favor humiliates. Its acquisition causes trembling, its loss causes
trembling. This is meant by "Favor bodes disgrace; it is like
trembling."

3\. What means "Rank bodes great heartache, it is like the body?"

I suffer great heartache because I have a body. When I have no body,
what heartache remains?

4\. Therefore who administers the empire as he takes care of his body
can be entrusted with the empire.
