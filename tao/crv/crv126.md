### CHAPTER 61.

This chapter contains more wisdom than it seems to possess at first
sight. The same idea is expressed in the English saying that by stooping
one conquers. It is also echoed in the New Testament where Jesus says
that he who wishes to be the master of all should be their servant. In
an empire or confederacy of states that state takes the lead which
renders the greatest service to the others. For instance Prussia took
the

lead in Germany because through its systematic administration and
well-organized army it offered protection and other advantages to the
smaller states and so served their interests. In the same way Athens
gained and lost ascendency in Greece; its downfall dates from the time
when it ceased to serve the others and began to misuse its power. Since
the loss of the thirteen American colonies England has adopted the same
maxim of serving the interests of her dependencies. This policy which
has proved successful and has repeatedly saved the British empire from
dismemberment, was pronounced by Lao-tze in plain terms two and a half
millenniums ago.
