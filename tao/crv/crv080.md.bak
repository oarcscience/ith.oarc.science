1\. If the people do not fear death, how can they be frightened by
death? If we make people fear death, and supposing <span

2\. There is always an executioner who kills. Now to take the place of
the executioner who kills is taking the place of the great carpenter who
hews. If a man takes the place of the great carpenter who hews, he will
rarely, indeed, fail to injure his hand.
