1\. One on tiptoe is not steady;  
One astride makes no advance.  
Seff-displayers are not enlightened,  
Self-asserters lack distinction, <span id="page_90">p. 90</span>  
Self-approvers have no merit,  
And self-seekers stunt their lives.

2\. Before Reason this is like surfeit of food; it is like a wen on the
body with which people are apt to be disgusted.

3\. Therefore the man of reason will not indulge in it.
