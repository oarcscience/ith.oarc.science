<P>In former editions we have translated the verb <I>shang</I> by its common meaning "to exalt," but here it is obviously a reflex verb meaning "to exalt oneself" or "to brag, to boast."</P>
<P>The word <I>fu</I> means literally "stomach"</P>

<P>or "the interior," but it may also mean "soul," for according to Chinese ideas the soul has its seat in the stomach.</P>
<P>The idea that the belly is the noblest part of the body where tender sentiments dwell was quite common among early peoples. Thus, e. g. the Hebrew <I>rakhamim</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> which originally means "entrails," is used in the sense of "compassion" and "love." In Japan that death was considered most worthy in which the first attack upon life was made upon the seat of the properly psychic faculties; therefore the victim of <I>hara-kiri</I> rips open his belly and is then beheaded by his best friend so as to shorten the pain of death.

<P>The word <I>kuh</I> might be translated (as</P>
