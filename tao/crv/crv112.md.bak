### CHAPTER 35.

The world is noisy. There is music; there are dainties to eat; there are
many distractions, and the passing stranger stops. The Tao is tasteless,
is invisible, is inaudible, but inexhaustible in its use. We have here a
trinity of the negative qualities of the Tao just as in Chapter 14.
Compare also Chapter 42.
