### CHAPTER 39.

Plato scholars will note that the famous dialogue "Parmenides,"
discussing the problem of the one and the many, may fitly be compared
with Lao-tze's exposition of the nature of oneness, the poetical portion
of which sounds like a philosophical rhapsody.

The simile that the carriage does not consist of its parts, but it a
definite combination of its parts, is also used in the Buddhist book,
"Questions of King Milinda," written several centuries after Lao-tze.

\*   \*   \*

The last line in section 7, *Ta fang wu yü* (literally, "Greatest square
has no corner") should be compared with the same sentiment in Chapter
45, *ta chih joh ch‘ü* ("greatest straightness seems curved").
