### CHAPTER 27.

In Section 4 we have adopted an entirely new interpretation. In
following a suggestion of Prof. H. A. Giles, we construe the two
characters *shan* (words 6 and 14) denoting "good" or "goodness," as
verbs in the sense to consider as good, and translate "to respect"; and
further

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

the characters *shi* (words 9 and 21) in their common meaning as
"multitudes," not as we had it in former editions (though it is not
wrong), as "educator."
