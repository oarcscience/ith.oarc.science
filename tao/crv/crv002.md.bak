# FOREWORD.

This booklet, *The Canon of Reason and Virtue*, is an extract from the
author's larger work, *Lao-Tze's Tao Teh King*, and has been published
for the purpose of making our reading public more familiar with that
grand and imposing figure *Li Er*, who was honored with the posthumous
title *Poh-Yang*, i. e., Prince Positive (representing the male or
strong principle); but whom his countrymen simply call *Lao-tze*, the
Old Philosopher.

\*   \*   \*

Sze-Ma Ch‘ien, the Herodotus of China, who lived about 136-85 B. C., has
left a short sketch of Lao-tze's life in his *Shi Ki* (Historical
Records) which is here prefixed as the most ancient and only
well-attested account to be had of the Old Philosopher.

Born in 604 B. C., Lao-tze was by about half a century the senior of
Confucius. He must have attained great fame during his life, for
Confucius is reported to have sought an interview with him. But the two
greatest sages of China did not understand each other, and they parted
mutually disappointed.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

Confucius's visit to Lao-tze has been doubted. If it is not historical
it certainly is *ben trovato*, for the contrast between these two
leaders of Chinese thought remains to the present day. The disciples of
Confucius, the so-called "literati," are tinged with their master's
agnosticism and insist on the rules of propriety as the best methods of
education, while the *Tao Sze*, the believers in the Tao, or divine
Reason, are given to philosophical speculation and religious mysticism.
The two schools are still divided, and have never effected a
conciliation of their differences that might be attained on a common
higher ground.

Chwang-tze, one of Lao-tze's disciples, who lived about 330 B. C., has
preserved another, an older and more elaborate, report of the meeting
between Confucius and the Old Philosopher. Sze-Ma Ch‘ien (163-85 B. C.)
is sometimes supposed to have derived his account from Chwang-tze, but
Chwang-tze's story bears traces of legendary elements which can not but
be regarded as fiction, and it is difficult to believe that the
historian should have taken his sober sketch from the fantastic tale of
a poet-philosopher.

The names of Lao-tze's birthplace, state, province and the locality of
his life's work might be considered as invented purposely because of
their strange significance if they were not geographically existent. In
the first

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

edition of *Lao-tze's Tao Teh King* we translated Cheu as "the State of
Plenty," and will only add that the word is made up of the characters
"mouth" and "to use," its original meaning being "to supply everywhere;
to make a circuit all around or everywhere; and plenty." The Cheu
dynasty was so called because the emperor's power reached all over the
civilized world, according to Chinese notions. In the present edition we
have preferred to translate the word Cheu by "the State of Everywhere."

It would be easy to say that the Old Philosopher was a citizen of
Everywhere, and was born in Good Man's Bend to describe his innate
character; that his home was situated in Thistle District of Bramble
Province to indicate the poverty and difficulties with which his life
was surrounded.

The plum-tree is the symbol of immortality, and the ear might signify
the man who was willing to listen. Accordingly Lao-tze's family name
*Li* (plum) seems to be as much justified as his proper name *Er* (ear).
What splendid material with which to change Lao-tze into a mythical
figure! It is as good as the life of Napoleon of whom Pérèz made a solar
hero, an Apollo, on account of his name and the several events of his
career--his final sinking in the west and disappearance on an island in
the Atlantic, the ocean of sunset. Nevertheless the historicity of
Lao-tze and

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

the authenticity of his book seem to be sufficiently well ascertained.

The historicity of Lao-tze's writing has been doubted only once, but by
so great an authority as H. A. Giles. We must, however, remember that
the greater part of the Tao Teh King is preserved in quotations in the
pre-Christian writings of Lieh-tze, Chwang-tze, and Hwai Nan-tze. (For
details see the article in reply to Professor Giles in *The Monist*, XI,
pp. 574-601.)

Lao-tze's book on Reason and Virtue first bore the title *Tao Teh*. It
was in all outward appearances a mere collection of aphoristic
utterances, but full of noble morals and deep meditation. It met the
reward which it fully deserved, having by imperial decree been raised to
the dignity of canonical authority; hence the name *King* or "canon,"
completing the title *Tao Teh King*, as now commonly used, which we
translate "Canon of Reason and Virtue."

Although Confucian philosophy has become the guiding star of the Chinese
government Lao-tze has taken a firm hold on the hearts of the people,
and in the progress of time his figure has grown in significance into
the stature of a Christ-like superhuman personality. So it happened that
later traditions added to Sze-Ma Ch‘ien's brief report various details
which became more and more fantastic. We learn that Yin Hi, the officer
of the frontier,

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

was warned beforehand by astrological science of the sage's coming. He
is further reputed to have accompanied his master into the deserts of
the west, traveling in a car drawn by black oxen.

Still later legends add to these fables the story of Lao-tze's
miraculous conception through the influence of a star, and claim that he
was the incarnation of the supreme celestial essence; that he had
repeatedly been incarnate, once in the village of the state of Tz’u.
This latter birth is represented in analogy with Buddha's nativity, for
his mother brought forth the divine child from her left side, and her
delivery took place under a tree--in Lao-tze's case it was a plum-tree.
The infant at his very birth pointed to the tree saying, "I shall take
my surname *Li* (plum) from this tree." His head was white, and his
countenance that of an aged man, whence it is said he derived his name
Lao-tze, which not only means the Old Philosopher but also the Ancient
Child. He is said to have wandered to the farthest extremities of the
earth, including the countries Ta Ts‘in (which seems to have represented
the Roman Empire) and Tu K‘ien, where he preached his doctrine and
converted the people to the truth. In China he is reported to have
helped Wu Wang, the founder of the famous Cheu dynasty, in the year 112
B. C.

Lao-tze's various disciples developed more

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

and more the mystical elements of Taoism, the practical application of
which terminated in a belief in alchemy, especially in an elixir of
life.

The Emperor Wu Ti and the emperors of the T‘ang dynasty were staunch
believers in the Old Philosopher. When in the year 666 A. D. Emperor Kao
Tsung canonized him he gave him a rank among the gods as the Great
Supreme (*T‘ai Shan*g), as the Emperor-God of the Dark First Cause. Hüan
Tsung honored him in 1013 A. D. with the title *T‘ai Shang Lao Chiün*,
the Great Exalted One, the Ancient Master.

We regret to say that the Taoism of China is a religion which, powerful
though it is, little accords with the venerable old philosopher, and
without danger of doing its priests an injustice may be branded as a
system of superstitions and superstitious practices.

The Taoist church is governed by a Taoist pope who lives in the splendor
of a palace surrounded by extensive parks near Lung Hu Shan, scarcely
less beautiful than the garden of the Vatican at Rome.

\*   \*   \*

Lao-tze's *Tao Teh King* contains so many surprising analogies with
Christian thought and sentiment, that were its pre-Christian origin not
established beyond the shadow of a doubt, one would be inclined to
discover in it traces of Christian influence. Not only

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

does the term *Tao* (word, reason) correspond quite closely to the Greek
term *Logos*, but Lao-tze preaches the ethics of requiting hatred with
goodness. He insists on the necessity of becoming like unto a little
child, of returning to primitive simplicity and purity, of non-assertion
and non-resistance, and promises that the crooked shall be straight.

The *Tao Teh King* is brief, but it is filled to the brim with
suggestive thoughts.

\*   \*   \*

Two issues of the author's translation of *Lao-Tze's Tao Teh King* have
appeared and two editions of an extract entitled *The Canon of Reason
and Virtue*. In the second issue of the first edition of *Lao-Tze's Tao
Teh King* attention has been called to misprints in the Chinese text,
and alternative readings have been proposed in an additional chapter
entitled "Emendations and Comments."

The present edition is meant to be popular and is an enlargement of *The
Canon of Reason and Virtue*. Of the larger edition entitled *Lao-Tze's
Tao Teh King*, it incorporates the main explanations and the Chinese
text which in its revised form we hope is now quite reliable. A few
variants which are important for the sense of the text have been added
in footnotes. Thus the present little volume being a combination of the
larger and the smaller editions, is practically a new work. It contains
a comprehensive introduction and

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

incorporates the results of the translator's latest labors in revising
and reconsidering the many difficult passages of the *Tao Teh King*. A
number of new interpretations flashed upon him from time to time, and
some of them will be deemed happy and probably be accepted as final.
This certainly is true of the first paragraph of Chapter 2, and also of
the second paragraph of Chapter 49.

I do not deem it necessary in this popular edition to introduce
controversies or to criticize other translations; nor do I want to
correct all the mistakes and misprints of my own former editions. I must
be satisfied with offering the best results of my labors. My ideal has
been to reproduce the original in a readable form which would be as
literal as the difference of languages permits and as intelligible to
English-speaking people as is the original to the educated native
Chinese. While linguistic obscurities have been removed as much as
possible, the sense has upon the whole not been rendered more definite
than the original or the traditional interpretation would warrant. Stock
phrases which are easily understood, such as "the ten thousand things,"
meaning the whole world or nature collectively, have been left in their
original form; but expressions which without a commentary would be
unintelligible, such as "not to depart from the baggage wagon," meaning
to preserve one's dignity (Chap. 26), have been re-

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

placed by the nearest terms that cover their meaning.

The versification of the quoted poetry is as literal as possible and as
simple as in the original. No attempt has been made to improve its
literary elegance. The translator was satisfied if he could find a rhyme
which would introduce either no change at all in the words or such an
indifferent change as would not in the least alter their sense.

The present edition contains also an introduction and comments in which
my prior explanations of Lao-tze's thought are restated in a condensed
form together with some new observations which in their appropriate
places have been incorporated.

The division into chapters as well as the chapter headings were not made
by Lao-tze but are the work of later Chinese editors.

I have sought the advice of Mr. Ng Poon Chew, editor of the *Chung Sai
Yat Po*, the Chinese daily paper of San Francisco, for the
interpretation of some difficult words, and for doubtful passages I
deemed a comparison with the Manchu translation desirable, for which
purpose I have availed myself of the assistance of Dr. Berthold Laufer
of the Field Museum of Chicago.

Prof. Paul Pelliot, of Paris, has recently published in the *T‘oung Pao*
(1912, pp. 351-430) an account of a Sanskrit translation of the Tao Teh
King made in the seventh century

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

for King Kumara of Assam, vassal to the famous Harsha Ciladitya, king of
Magadha. Unfortunately this version is lost.

\*   \*   \*

For further information on Lao-tze the reader is referred to the
author's essays *Chinese Philosophy* (Religion of Science Library No.
30), *Chinese Thought*, "The Authenticity of the *Tao Teh King*" (*The
Monist*, Vol. XI, pp. 574-601), written in reply to Prof. Herbert A.
Giles, "Medhurst's New Translation of the *Tao Teh King*" (*The Open
Court*, XX, 174), and the former more complete edition of *Lao-Tze's Tao
Teh King*.

This our larger book, entitled *Lao-Tze's Tao Teh King*, which contains
a verbatim translation of the Chinese text, has not become entirely
antiquated, but we warn students that it stands in need of a revision on
the basis of the present emendated edition.

\*   \*   \*

May this little book fulfil its mission and be a witness to the
religious spirit and philosophical depth of a foreign nation whose
habits, speech, and dress are strange to us. We are not alone in the
world; there are others who search for the truth and are groping after
it. Let us become better acquainted with them, let us greet them as
brothers, let us understand them and appreciate their ideals!
