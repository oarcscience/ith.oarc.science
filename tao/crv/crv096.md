### CHAPTER 11.

Things are shaped by carving, by taking away, by diminishing the
material. Accordingly that which is no longer there, the non-existent,
constitutes their worth. Thus it appears that the part in this case
would be greater than the whole, or to state the same truth briefly
"less is more." As Hesiod says in his Works and Days (30):

Νήπιοι οὐδ᾽ ἴσασιν ὅσῳ πλέον ἥμισυ παντός.

"Foolish they are, for they know not  
That half than the whole is much greater."
