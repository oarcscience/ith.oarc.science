### CHAPTER 2.

The first sentence reads literally, "Under the heavens \[*i. e.*, all
over the world, or everywhere\] all know \[i. e., it is obvious\], if
beauty acts beauty it is only ugliness." The verb "acts" is to be taken
in the same sense as it is used in English, viz., "making a display or
show of."

We deem our present rendering an improvement on our former version.

According to a notion of the early Christians the devil would like to
play the part of God, as Tertullian says, *Satanas affectat sacramenta
Dei*. On Lao-tze's theory the nature of the devil consists exactly in
the attempt of acting the part of God.

The close interrelation of goodness with badness and of beauty with
ugliness suggests the quotation on opposites. It sets forth the
coexistence of contrasts, and their mutual dependence is more obvious to
the Chinese than to other nations, because in their word-combinations
they use compounds of contrasts to denote what is common in both. Thus a
combination of the words "to be" and "not to be" means the struggle for
life, or the bread question; "the high and the low" means altitude;
"much and little" means quantity, etc. But what originally seems to have
been the trivial observation of a grammar-school teacher acquires a
philosophical meaning when commented upon by Lao-tze.
