### CHAPTER I.

The phrase '*yiu ming*, "having name" (or simply *ming*, "name") means
that which the definition of a name involves, and as such the term
represents the actualized types of things. However *wu ming*, "not name"
or "the Unnamable," corresponds to Plato's conception of the prototype
of things before they have been actualized. Lao-tze speaks with
reverence of the Unnamable, <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) which
closely corresponds to the "Ineffable" of Western mystics.

Namable.

\[paragraph continues\] Namable" is in Spinoza's language *natura
naturata*, while "the Unnamable" is *natura naturans*. In either system
the two are one; they are two aspects of one and the same thing which in
Lao-tze's taoism is the Tao and in Spinoza's cosmotheism is God as the
eternal substance.
