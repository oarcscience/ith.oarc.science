<P>2. Although its simplicity seems insignificant, the whole world does not dare to suppress it. If princes and kings <A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A> could keep it, the ten thousand things would of themselves pay homage. Heaven and earth would unite in dripping sweet dew, and the people with no one to command them would of themselves be righteous.</P>
<P>3. As soon as Reason creates order, it becomes namable. Whenever the namable in its turn acquires existence, one learns to know when to stop. By knowing when to stop, one avoids danger.</P>
<P>4. To illustrate Reason's relation to the world we compare it to streams and creeks in their course towards rivers and the ocean.</P>
