<P>2. "Why &#146;t is by heaven rejected,<BR>
Who has the reason detected?"</P></DIR>

<P>Therefore the holy man also regards it as difficult.</P>
<P>3. The Heavenly Reason strives not, but it is sure to conquer. It speaks not, but it is sure to respond. It summons not, but it comes of itself. It works patiently, but is sure in its designs.</P>
<P>4. Heaven's net is vast, so vast. It is wide-meshed, but it loses nothing.</P>
