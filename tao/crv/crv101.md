### CHAPTER 18.

This chapter is directed against the Confucianist morality of filial
piety, loyalty, and justice. Lao-tze is disgusted with the very words.
Where the Tao obtains there is no need of preaching justice, filial
piety and loyalty, for the [virtue](errata.htm#2.md) of the Tao is
spontaneous. The men whose hearts are bare of these virtues, parade them
in words.
