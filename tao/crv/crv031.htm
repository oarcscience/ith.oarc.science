<P>2. Alone it standeth, and it changeth not; around it moveth, and it suffereth not; yet therefore can it be the world's mother.</P>
<P>3. Its name I know not, but its nature I call Reason.</P>
<P>4. Constrained to give a name, I call it the great. The great I call the departing, and the departing I call the beyond. The beyond I call home.</P>
<P>5. The saying goes: "Reason is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and royalty also is great. [There are four things <A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A> in the world that are great, and royalty is one of them.]</P>
<P>6. Man's standard is the earth. The earth's standard is heaven. Heaven's standard is Reason. Reason's standard is intrinsic.</P>
