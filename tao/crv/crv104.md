### CHAPTER 21.

The last two lines of the quoted verse in Chapter 21 are obscure in the
original Chinese. The difficulty lies in the meaning of the word *fu*,
which means anything that is first, either in time or dignity. Literally
the eight words read:

"Its--name--not--departs; Thereby--it notes--all--the first."

The sense seems to be that the Tao is eternal, for its name never
departs. Therefore it has been in the beginning of creation. In this
sense we have translated the passage in former editions:

"Its name does not depart  
Thence lo! All things take start."

which means, "It is of all the first."

Should *fu*, however, have to be taken in the sense of excellence we
would propose either of these two readings:

"Its name does not pass hence,  
Lo! Here's all excellence!"

or, if we lay stress on the verb *yüeh*, "it beholds," we translate:

"Its name is never vanishing  
It heeds the good in everything."

Mr. Ng Poon Chew favors the idea that the character *fu* means "the
beginning."

The Manchu version follows the last interpretation. Dr. Laufer
translates: "Hence one investigates all good things,"--which seems to
mean: "Thereby we learn what in all things is good," and the concluding
sentence would read: "Whereby do I know what is good in all things?
Through IT." In other words: "Reason is the standard of excellence."

The two last words "through IT" in this chapter comprise a favorite term
of Lao-tze, and by "IT" Lao-tze means "Reason."
