chapter the sage warns us to beware of these qualities, and rather
remain tender and weak. The people should scarcely know that weapons

On the authority of Professor Giles the last section of this chapter
should read "Fishes can not be taken away from the water. The
instruments of government can not be delegated to others." Huai Nan Tze
tells a story of a sovereign who lost his throne by transferring the
power of punishment to his minister. (See Emendations and Comments to
*Lao-Tze's Tao-Teh-King*, second issue, pages xvi-xvii.)

Lao-tze regarded acquaintance with weapons as an unnatural condition
which would prove fatal to the people, just as fish must die when they
are removed from their natural element, the water.
