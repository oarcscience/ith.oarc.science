1\. "The crooked shall be straight,  
Crushed ones recuperate,  
The empty find their fill.  
The worn with strength shall thrill;  
Who little have receive,  
And who have much will grieve."

2\. Therefore

The holy man embraces unity and becomes for all the world a model.

Not self-displaying he is enlightened;

Not self -approving he is distinguished;

Not self-asserting he acquires merit;

Not self-seeking he gaineth life.

Since he does not quarrel, therefore no one in the world can quarrel
with him.

3\. The saying of the ancients: "The crooked shall be straight," is it
in any way vainly spoken? Verily, they will be straightened and return
home.
