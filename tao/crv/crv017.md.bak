1\. Thirty spokes unite in one nave and on that which is non-existent
\[on the hole in the nave\] depends the wheel's utility. Clay is moulded
into a vessel and on that which is non-existent \[on its hollowness\]
depends the vessel's utility. By cutting out doors and windows we build
a house and on that which is <span id="page_80">p. 80</span>
non-existent \[on the empty space within\] depends the house's utility.

2\. Therefore, existence renders actual but non-existence renders
useful.
