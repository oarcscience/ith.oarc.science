### CHAPTER 49.

The word *shang* means "constant, ordinary, usual, common" etc., and the
contrast requires the sense that the saint has not the heart as other
people have, which means a heart of his own.

The "one hundred families" is a Chinese term which means the people of a
district.

The second section of this chapter contains a difficulty in the text.
Its third sentence reads in the Chinese text as translated in our former
editions, "Virtue is good"; but this does not make good sense, as it is
trivial. While pondering over the meaning of these two characters the
translator discovered two versions <span id="fr_31"></span>[9](#fn_31.md)
which replace the word *teh*, "virtue," by its homophone, *teh*, "to
obtain," and it seemed quite probable that this was the original
reading. The change from *teh*, "to obtain," to *teh*, "virtue," could
naturally and at an early date have originated through a careless scribe
in a book where the word *teh*, "virtue," occurred so frequently. Once
introduced, the mistake could easily have been perpetuated in the text.

The word *teh*, "to obtain," makes good sense and might even suggest
itself as the most appropriate text emendation. On the ground of this
consideration we might prefer the reading *teh*, "to obtain,"

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

and propose to translate the passage thus:

"The good I meet with goodness, the bad I also meet with goodness; thus
I obtain goodness (i. e., I actualize virtue.) The faithful I meet with
faith, the faithless I also meet with faith; thus I obtain faith (i. e.,
I actualize faith)."

In other words, we must meet not only the good with goodness but the bad
also with goodness, if we want to actualize the ideal of goodness; and
we must meet not only the faithful with faith but the faithless also
with faith, in order to actualize the ideal of faith.

This is the obvious meaning of Lao-tze, for he here expresses his view
of the way a man can become truly good and faithful. He does not admit
any utilitarian argument and lays down the rule for a man who follows
the Tao. He can be truly good and truly faithful only if he is good and
faithful to all, whether he has to deal with the good or the not-good,
the faithful or the faithless.

The Manchu translator had before him a text which read *teh*, "virtue,"
not *teh*,

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "obtain," but he construes *teh*, "virtue," as a
genitive. If he is right, we must translate, "That is virtue's
goodness," and further down, "That is virtue's faith."

After some hesitation we have finally adopted the interpretation of the
Manchu version.
