### CHAPTER 10.

The text of the first two sentences is difficult, and we deem our
present version an improvement. <span id="fr_27"></span>[7](#fn_27.md)
Literally the beginning seems to read thus: "Being insistent in
disciplining the sense soul." Mr. Ng Poon Chew writes: "The first two
characters are verbs, there is no question as to that. The word *poh* is
commonly understood by the Chinese to be the passive half of the human
soul equivalent to *yin* in nature."

The Manchu version (as Dr. Laufer informs me) in agreement with a
Chinese quotation of this passage by Huai Nan Tze takes all these
sentences as queries.
