### CHAPTER 29.

The doctrine of "doing the not-doing" has rightly been compared to the
French principle of *laissez faire*, although the two are not the same.
Lao-tze wants to say here that "he who makes, mars"; we therefore should
not interfere but let everything take the course of its natural
development.
