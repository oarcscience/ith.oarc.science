The high it brings down, the lowly it lifts up. Those who have abundance it depleteth; those who are deficient it augmenteth.</P>
<P>2. Such is Heaven's Reason. It depleteth those who have abundance but completeth the deficient.</P>
<P>3. Man's Reason is not so. He depleteth the deficient in order to serve those who have abundance.</P>

<P>4. Where is he who would have abundance for serving the world?</P>
<P>5. Indeed, it is the holy man who acts but claims not; merit he acquires but he does not dwell upon it, and does he ever show any anxiety to display his excellence?</P>
