1\. Of great rulers the subjects do not notice the existence. To lesser
ones people are attached; they praise them. Still lesser ones people
fear, and the meanest ones people despise.

2\. For it is said:

"If your faith be insufficient, verily, you will receive no faith."

3\. How reluctantly they \[the great rulers\] considered their words!
Merit they accomplished; deeds they performed; and the hundred families
thought: "We are independent."
