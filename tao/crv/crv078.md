### 72. HOLDING ONESELF DEAR.

1\. If the people do not fear the dreadful, the great dreadful will
come, surely.

2\. Let them not deem their lives narrow. Let them not deem their lot
wearisome. When it is not deemed wearisome, then it will not be
wearisome.

3\. Therefore the holy man knows himself but does not display himself.
He <span id="page_125">p. 125</span> holds himself dear but does not
honor himself. Thus he discards the latter and chooses the former.
