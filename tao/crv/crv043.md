1\. Reason always practises non-assertion, and there is nothing that
remains undone.

2\. If princes and kings could keep Reason, the ten thousand creatures
would of themselves be reformed. While being reformed they might yet be
anxious to stir; but I would restrain them by the simplicity of the
Ineffable.

3\. "The simplicity of the unexpressed  
Will purify the heart of lust.  
Is there no lust there will be rest,  
And all the world will thus be blest."
