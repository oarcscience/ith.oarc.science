<TABLE  ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/tao20.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"></TD></TR></TABLE>1. Abandon learnedness, and you have no vexation. The "yes" compared with the "yea," how little do they differ! <A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A> But the good compared with the bad, how much do they differ!</P>
<P>2. If what the people dread cannot be made dreadless, there will be desolation, alas! and verily, there will be no end of it.</P>
<P>3. The multitudes of men are happy, so happy, as though celebrating a great feast. They are as though in springtime ascending a tower. I alone remain quiet, alas! like one that has not yet received an omen. I am like unto a babe that does not yet smile.</P>
<P>4. Forlorn am I, O so forlorn! It appears that I have no place whither I may return home.</P>
<P>5. The multitude of men all have plenty and I alone appear empty. Alas! I am a man whose heart is foolish.</P>
<P>6. Ignorant am I, O, so ignorant! Common people are bright, so bright, I alone am dull.</P>
<P>7. Common people are smart, so smart, I alone am confused, so confused.</P>
<P>8. Desolate am I, alas! like the sea. Adrift, alas! like one who has no place where to stay.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></P>
<P>9. The multitude of men all possess usefulness. I alone am awkward and a rustic too. I alone differ from others, but I prize seeking sustenance from our mother.</P>
