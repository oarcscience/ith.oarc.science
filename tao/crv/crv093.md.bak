### CHAPTER 6.

The verse quoted in this chapter seems to be the inscription over a
fountain which it was claimed never ran dry. People believed that its
source was deep and sprang from the root of heaven and earth, which
would explain that its supply was inexhaustible. In using this quotation
Lao-tze looks upon the spring as an emblem of the mysterious nature of
the Tao.

The Manchu version translates the word *ku*, valley, as a verb by
"nourishing," which makes a very good sense for the first line, thus:

"Who nourishes spirituality does not die."

<span id="page_140 ">p. 140</span>

The use of *ku* (valley) as a verb, meaning "to feed, to nourish, to
quicken," according to all dictionaries, is quite common in Chinese. But
we might as well interpret *ku* as an adjective or participle and
translate (with Couvreur): <span id="fr_25"></span>[5](#fn_25.md)

"L’esprit vivifiant ne meurt pas."

A literal translation would read thus:

"The quickening spirit never dies.  
It is called the mysterious woman.  
The mysterious woman's gate  
Is called of heaven and earth the root.  
For ever and aye it abides  
\[And\] its use is without effort."

The Manchu translator finds a physiological meaning in this chapter. Dr.
Berthold Laufer has kindly furnished me with a translation of it as
follows:

"Who nourishes the soul will not die. This is called the life of the
main artery (*Kuhen-i ergen* = Chinese *yüen p‘in*, "mysterious woman").
The door of the life of the main artery is called the root

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

of procreation and increase. As if preserved for all eternity, it is
inexhaustible in its practical application." <span
id="fr_26"></span>[6](#fn_26.md)

Dr. Laufer adds: "It is strange that the Chinese words for 'heaven and
earth' which otherwise are literally translated, are here rendered by
the verbal nouns *banjibure* and *fusembure*, the former 'creating,' the
latter 'increasing.'
