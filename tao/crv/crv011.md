1\. But for heaven and earth's humaneness, the ten thousand things are
straw dogs. But for the holy man's humaneness, the hundred families are
straw dogs.

2\. Is not the space between heaven and earth like unto a bellows? It is
empty; yet it collapses not. It moves, and more and more comes forth.
\[But\]

3\. "How soon exhausted is  
A gossip's fulsome talk!  
And should we not prefer  
On the middle path to walk?"
