# THE CH‘ING CHING CHING.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PREFATORY NOTE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

F<span class="small">AR</span> up a rocky precipice of the Horse-saddle
Mountain in Chihli, within a hundred feet or so of its inaccessible
peak, is perched a tiny temple called the Grotto of Ecstacy. There,
under a sky of burning blue, lives an old Buddhist hermit named Shih
Shan; a man of wide celebrity among the priesthood, and credited with
many marvellous accomplishments. He is now over seventy years of age. He
has a full white beard; his long hair hangs in a tangled mass, like a
shred of ragged felt, below his waist; his robe is of tattered
patchwork. For ten years he preserved absolute and unbroken silence; but
he was by no means idle during this period, for he went about collecting
funds for the repair of temples, and many are the shrines he has been
the instrument of restoring. He lives on gourds, eating the commonest
and poorest kind of rice only twice a month; his days he spends in
sitting crosslegged on the ground with closed eyes, thinking, as he told
the writer, of nothing. In spite of his close retirement he is of a most
amiable disposition, and takes a very intelligent part in conversation.
He is said to have knowledge of things passing at a distance; and such
is his sanctity that a daily miracle is performed of which he is the
subject. As it is impossible, however, to write this in plain English,
we relegate the explanation of it to the Chinese note which will be
found at the bottom of the page,<span
id="page_70_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_70_note_*.md) for the benefit of such
as may be curious about the subject.

   Towards the close of an interesting conversation with the strange
being we have described, our eyes fell upon his modest library; a small
heap of soiled and tattered books, which lay on a shrine in the centre
of the temple court. Opening one of them at random, we found it to be a
manuscript copy of the \#\#\#, a little treatise in thorough keeping
with all the features of the place—the foreign visitors excluded. The
interest of our adventure was thus very much increased. Here we had the
doctrines of vacuity, inaction, and quiescence as inculcated by the
Taoist philosophers, set forth in a book; while in the same place there
existed a living example of their efficacy—an old man who acted them out
in every particular and whose presence was a striking proof that the
<span id="page_71">p. 71</span> principles of Ancient Taoism are far
from being dead. On taking our leave of the old hermit, we cautiously
approached the subject of a bargain. "Sir," was the reply, "if you have
taken a fancy to the book, pray allow me to present you with it." A
small silver coin was, however, gracefully accepted to buy incense with,
and we departed the possessor of an occult little treatise of which the
following is a translation.

## TEXT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   *The Words of Lao Chün.* Although the Great Principle of
Nature—T<span class="small">AO</span>—has no form, it brought forth and
nourishes Heaven and Earth; though it has no passions, it causes the Sun
and Moon to revolve; though it has no name, it produces the growth and
nurture of all things. As I do not know its name, I am compelled to call
it simply T<span class="small">AO</span>. Now this Principle includes
the pure and the turbid, the active and the motionless. For instance,
Heaven is pure and Earth turbid; Heaven moves and the Earth is still.
The Masculine is pure, the feminine turbid; the Masculine is active and
the Feminine at rest. Emerging from its source and flowing on to all its
developments, it produced the visible creation. The pure is the origin
of the turbid, and the active of the motionless. If a man is able to
remain permanently pure and motionless, Heaven and Earth will both at
once come and dwell in him. Now the spirit of man loves purity, but his
passions cause disturbance. The heart of man loves rest; but his desires
draw him into motion. If he can without intermission abjure his desires,
his heart will become naturally quiescent; if he can cleanse his heart,
his spirit will become naturally pure. He may then be sure that the Six
Desires will arise no more, and that the Three Curses—lust, folly, and
wrath—will be annihilated. Therefore those who are incapable of arriving
at this state have never cleansed their hearts, or abjured their bodily
desires. If a man who is thus able to abjure his desires looks within
himself at his own heart, he will see that it is passionless; if he
looks outward, at his own body, he will regard it as though it were not
his; if he looks abroad at things around him, they will be to him as
though they did not exist. If he truly understands the nature of these
three things, he will see that they are mere emptiness; vacuity itself
he sees to be empty also. But there can be no emptiness in vacuity; for
vacuity being non-existent, the very absence of nothing thus
non-existing \[to him\], his serenity will be permanent and undisturbed;
and this immoveable tranquillity being so deep as not to admit of any
further tranquillity, how can any desires arise within him? Although the
true essence of man be constantly in relation with <span id="page_72">p.
72</span> outside matters, it must ever remain in possession of his
original nature; constantly responding to externals, he must still be
constant in quiescence; then his state of purity and rest will be
permanent. If one is able in this way to preserve his state of purity
and quiescence, he will gradually enter the ideal phase of the Principle
of Nature; and having entered this ideal phase, he may then be called
one who has obtained possession of it. Yet although he may be said to
possess the Principle of Nature, he has actually not obtained anything
at all; it is only that he is able to unravel all the mysteries
connected with living things. Those who thus fully understand may spread
this Holy Doctrine all abroad.

   *The Words of Lao Chün, Prince of the Sublime.* Scholars of eminence
never wrangle; those of low attamments love wrangling. Men of high
Virtue make nothing whatever of their virtue; those of Inferior virtue
cling to it \[as of great value\]. Those who plume themselves upon their
attainments cannot be called in possession of the two principles of
T<span class="small">AO</span> and Virtue; and the reason why all
mankind are unable to attain the ideal phase of T<span
class="small">AO</span> is to be found in their misguided hearts. Their
hearts being thus misguided, their spirits become unsettled or
perturbed; being in this state of perturbation, they follow after
worldly objects; pursuing worldly objects, they become a prey to desires
and lusts, and desires and lusts arising within them, disappointments
and trouble ensue. Now disappointments in the attainment of what they
long for lead to unruly and disordered thoughts, and the result is
bitterness and misery to both mind and body. Then they will inevitably
incur disgrace and shame; the successive births and deaths they will
have to pass through will flow on and on like ocean waves, and they will
sink for ever in a Sea of Bitterness—the ideal goal they might have
reached being lost to them eternally. Those who fully understand all
this, will obtain the True and Constant Principle of Nature of
themselves; and those who are able to understand the Principle of Nature
will be for ever in a state of purity and rest.

   *The Words of Ko Hsuän, the Immortal.* I have obtained this
Principle. Formerly I conned this book ten thousand times. It is only
men of Heaven who can learn it, and it should not be imparted to those
of inferior calibre. I received it in the first instance from the Divine
Prince of Eastern Glory; he received it from the Divine Prince of the
Golden Gate, and he from the Royal Mother of the West. The Royal Mother
imparted it to him entirely by word of mouth, not committing it to
paper; I now give it to the world, having written it down and then
transcribing it with care. Scholars of eminence who thoroughly
comprehend it will ascend on high and receive authority in Heaven; those
of medium grade who strive to put it into practice will have their name
inscribed on the <span id="page_73">p. 73</span> roll of Immortals in
the Southern Palace; while those of the lowest order who obtain it will
live long years on earth, roam through the Three Spheres of Being, and,
mounting on high, pass through the Golden Gate.

   *The Words of Tso Hsuän, the Divine Man.* Among students of the
Principle of Nature,—T<span class="small">AO</span>—he who resolutely
cons this book will secure the guardianship of multitudes of good
spirits from the Tenth Heaven; after which his soul will be placed under
the protection of the Jewelled Seal, and his body permeated with the
Elixir of Gold. Then both body and soul will become robed in
supernatural beauty, and be in perfect harmony with the subtle Principle
of Nature.

   *The Words of Cheng I, the Divine Man.* If this book be in anyone's
family, those who fully understand its meaning will not be exposed to
any adversities or obstacles; their door will be guarded by all the Holy
Ones, and their souls ascend to the Higher World, where they will be
admitted to the presence of those lofty beings who have attained to
perfect purity, and bow before them,—their merit all-sufficient, their
virtue all-complete; and where reciprocal influences will exist between
them and the Deva-princes. All who are unwearied in the study of this
book will ascend bodily to the Purple Clouds—where the Immortals live.
