# THE HSIN YIN CHING.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PREFATORY NOTE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

T<span class="small">HE</span> following brief treatise is accorded a
place in the recognised Taoist canon, though bearing marks of
comparatively modern authorship. Its very title, \#\#\#, has a savour of
Buddhism about it, and its allusions to elixirism and other empirical
practices identify it at once with the Rosicrucian development, rather
than with the original Naturalistic phase, of Taoism. But its date and
author are, I believe, alike unknown.

## TEXT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   There are three degrees of Supreme Elixir—the Spirit, the Breath, and
the Essential Vigour. Obscure and recondite! Confused and dim! Maintain
vacuity, and you will preserve the actual—accomplishing it in an instant
of time. Restore the \[ancient\] habits,<span
id="page_66_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_66_note_*.md) and chaos will be brought
into harmony; a hundred days, and the work will be achieved; then you
may silently adore the Supreme Ruler, and in twelve years' time may wing
your flight above. The wise understand this easily, but the dull find it
difficult to perform. \[Those who have attained it\] tread in the Light
of Heaven; by inhaling and exhaling, they nourish the Pure Breath; they
emerge from the Azure (Heaven) and enter the Female (Earth);<span
id="page_66_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_66_note_dagger.md) now, as it were,
annihilated, and now, as it were, existing, they never cease to all
eternity; their supports<span
id="page_66_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_66_note_ddagger.md) are strong,
their roots deep.

   Men are all possessed of Essential Vigour; this corresponds with the
Spirit, the Spirit with the Breath, and the Breath with the essential
<span id="page_67">p. 67</span> nature of the body. Those who have not
obtained their original or essential nature, all usurp their reputation.

   The Spirit is able to enter stone; the Spirit is able to fly through
solid bodies. If it enters water, it is not drowned; or fire, it is not
burned. The Spirit depends, for its birth, upon the body; the Essential
Vigour depends, for attaining its full proportions, upon the Breath.
They never lose their vitality or force, but are evergreen, like the
pine and cedar trees. The three are all one Principle. Their mystery and
beauty cannot be heard. The combination of them produces existence;
their dispersion, extinction. If the seven apertures<span
id="page_67_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_67_note_*.md) are all open, each
aperture will be bright and luminous, \[for\] the Holy Sun and Holy Moon
will pour their effulgence upon the Golden Hall.<span
id="page_67_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_67_note_dagger.md) Once obtained,
they are obtained for ever; then the body will become naturally buoyant,
the Universal Harmony will be replete, and the bones will dissolve into
the cold chrysoprasus-flower.<span
id="page_67_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_67_note_ddagger.md) If the Elixir
be obtained, supernatural intelligence will result; if it be not
obtained, there will be defeat and ruin. The Elixir, being in the centre
of the body, is neither white nor black.

   If this treatise be conned-over and observed ten thonsand times, its
beautiful and mysterious doctrine will become clear of itself.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_66">p. 66</span>

<span id="page_66_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_66_fr_*.md) This appears the
only possible meaning of the phrase \#\#\#.

<span id="page_66_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_66_fr_dagger.md) \#\#\#,
implying an emergence from Heaven and an entrance into the principle
*Yin*. Compare the theory of the \#\#\#, and the 6th chapter of Lao
Tsze. Or it may mean issuing from the unknown realms of Nothingness—"the
infinite Azure (\#\#\#) of the past"—into the embryonic stage; the
succession of such births and annihilations being without beginning or
end. But \#\#\# and \#\#\# are simply other expressions for \#\#\# and
\#\#\#.

<span id="page_66_note_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_66_fr_ddagger.md)
Literally, peduncle.

<span id="footnotes_page_67">p. 67</span>

<span id="page_67_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_67_fr_*.md) Eyes, ears,
nostrils and mouth. The seven entrances of the respective faculties.

<span id="page_67_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_67_fr_dagger.md) \#\#\#
apparently identical with \#\#\#, one of the names for the seat of
\#\#\# in the human body. See *Doolittle's Handbook*.

<span id="page_67_note_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_67_fr_ddagger.md) This is
a most puzzling sentence. It runs \#\#\#. It matters little whether
\#\#\# be rendered "to fall apart, disperse, even *dissolve*," or
whether it be translated in its common sense of "powder" \#\#\#, "will
pulverize." The chief difficulty lies with the character \#\#\#. The
phrase \#\#\# is given in the \#\#\#, with the following quotation:
\#\#\#;—\#\#\#, \#\#\#. . . . It may be however that \#\#\# is here a
verb—as the prosody would seem to demand—in which case the whole might
run "the bones will fall apart and become congealed, or crystallised,
into jade, or the chrysoprasus flower." The expression is of course
symbolical for the sublimation of the body. One rendering that has been
suggested to me is I think inadmissible; but I give it nevertheless—"the
bones will fall apart, and \[the man soar aloft upon\] the
chrysoprasus-flower;" just as Buddhists are said to ride upon the lotus.
But this would be taking too great a liberty with the text.
