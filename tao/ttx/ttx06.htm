<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That which is born in the state of Previous Existence, is born invisible&#8212;or formless; being extant in the state of Subsequent Existence, it is incorporeal. But that which is incorporeal has never really been extant; wherefore such a thing may be said to be unthinkable. The inherent nature [of man] is quiescent; then his <I>mind</I> is within him.<A NAME="page_68_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_68_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> The mind [of man] is active; then his <I>nature</I> is within him.<A NAME="page_68_fr_ddagger"></A><A HREF="#page_68_note_ddagger">&#8225;</A> When the mind prevails, the inherent nature is annihilated; when the mind is annihilated, the inherent nature becomes manifested. Resembling emptiness, without external form, it is then pure and pellucid, perfect and complete.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> is without peer; wherefore [its votary] ever maintains, interiorly, the Actual&#8212;the Existent. His unalloyed inherent nature is inactive; wherefore his mind never asserts itself externally. Self-sufficient and spontaneous, illimitable in extent [are the internal resources of such a man]! Whatever may be the circumstances of surroundings with which he is brought into contact, he ignores them all; he is not engulphed in the toils of the Six Despoilers; living in the dusty world, he is yet outside of it; he is not drawn into the transmutations of the myriad affinities. Being perfectly quiescent, he never moves; possessing perfect harmony,<A NAME="page_68_fr_sect"></A><A HREF="#page_68_note_sect">&sect;</A> he never changes. His wisdom reflects, as in a mirror, the entire Universe; his emptiness evolves inaction.</P>
