# THE TA T‘UNG CHING.<span id="page_68_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_68_note_*.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   That which is born in the state of Previous Existence, is born
invisible—or formless; being extant in the state of Subsequent
Existence, it is incorporeal. But that which is incorporeal has never
really been extant; wherefore such a thing may be said to be
unthinkable. The inherent nature \[of man\] is quiescent; then his
*mind* is within him.<span
id="page_68_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_68_note_dagger.md) The mind \[of
man\] is active; then his *nature* is within him.<span
id="page_68_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_68_note_ddagger.md) When the mind
prevails, the inherent nature is annihilated; when the mind is
annihilated, the inherent nature becomes manifested. Resembling
emptiness, without external form, it is then pure and pellucid, perfect
and complete.

   The Great T<span class="small">AO</span> is without peer; wherefore
\[its votary\] ever maintains, interiorly, the Actual—the Existent. His
unalloyed inherent nature is inactive; wherefore his mind never asserts
itself externally. Self-sufficient and spontaneous, illimitable in
extent \[are the internal resources of such a man\]! Whatever may be the
circumstances of surroundings with which he is brought into contact, he
ignores them all; he is not engulphed in the toils of the Six
Despoilers; living in the dusty world, he is yet outside of it; he is
not drawn into the transmutations of the myriad affinities. Being
perfectly quiescent, he never moves; possessing perfect harmony,<span
id="page_68_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_68_note_sect.md) he never changes.
His wisdom reflects, as in a mirror, the entire Universe; his emptiness
evolves inaction.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_68">p. 68</span>

<span id="page_68_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_68_fr_*.md) The most
superficial perusal of this essay will be found sufficient to detect the
strong Buddhist influences to which the author was subjected. Its date
is therefore probable later than the Han.

<span id="page_68_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_68_fr_dagger.md) That is,
while quiescence, which is the real nature of man, is in the ascendant,
the mind remains inactive; it does not emerge from the interior.

<span id="page_68_note_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_68_fr_ddagger.md) When the
mind bursts forth in action, the inherent nature of man, being
quiescent, takes no part in it, but remains tranquilly within.

<span id="page_68_note_sect"></span>[§](#page_68_fr_sect.md) Harmony, in
the sense that all his powers are held in *perfect equilibrium*; or,
perhaps, in harmony with \#\#\#.
