### Kih Lo, or 'Perfect Enjoyment <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)'

1\. Under the sky is perfect enjoyment to be found or not? Are there any
who can preserve themselves alive or not? If there be, what do they do?
What do they maintain? What do they avoid? What do they attend to? Where
do they resort to? Where do they keep from? What do they delight in?
What do they dislike?

What the world honours is riches, dignities, longevity, and being deemed
able. What it delights in is rest for the body, rich flavours, fine
garments, beautiful colours, and pleasant music. What it looks down on
are poverty and mean condition, short life and being deemed feeble <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md). What men consider bitter experiences are
that their bodies do not get rest and case, that their mouths do not get
food of rich flavour, that their persons are not finely clothed, that
their eyes do not see beautiful colours, and that their ears do not
listen to pleasant music. If they do not

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

get these things, they are very sorrowful, and go on to be troubled with
fears. Their thoughts are all about the body;--are they not silly?

Now the rich embitter their lives by their incessant labours; they
accumulate more wealth than they can use:--while they act thus for the
body, they make it external to themselves <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md). Those who seek for honours carry their
pursuit of them from the day into the night, full of anxiety about their
methods whether they are skilful or not:--while they act thus for the
body they treat it as if it were indifferent to them <span
id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md). The birth of man is at the same time the
birth of his sorrow; and if he live long he becomes more and more
stupid, and the longer is his anxiety that he may not die; how great is
his bitterness!--while he thus acts for his body, it is for a distant
result. Meritorious officers are regarded by the world as good; but
(their goodness) is not sufficient to keep their persons alive. I do not
know whether the goodness ascribed to them be really good or really not
good. If indeed it be considered good, it is not sufficient to preserve
their persons alive; if it be deemed not good, it is sufficient to
preserve other men alive. Hence it is said, 'When faithful remonstrances
are not listened to, (the remonstrant) should sit still, let (his ruler)
take his course, and not strive with him.' Therefore when Dze-hsü <span
id="fr_4"></span>[3](#fn_4) strove with (his ruler.md), he brought on
himself

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

the mutilation of his body. If he had not so striven, he would not have
acquired his fame:--was such (goodness) really good or was it not?

As to what the common people now do, and what they find their enjoyment
in, I do not know whether the enjoyment be really enjoyment or really
not. I see them in their pursuit of it following after all their aims as
if with the determination of death, and as if they could not stop in
their course; but what they call enjoyment would not be so to me, while
yet I do not say that there is no enjoyment in it. Is there indeed such
enjoyment, or is there not? I consider doing nothing (to obtain it) to
be the great enjoyment <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md), while
ordinarily people consider it to be a great evil. Hence it is said,
'Perfect enjoyment is to be without enjoyment; the highest praise is to
be without praise <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md).' The right and the
wrong (on this point of enjoyment) cannot indeed be determined according
to (the view of) the world; nevertheless, this doing nothing (to obtain
it) may determine the right and the wrong. Since perfect enjoyment is
(held to be) the keeping the body alive, it is only by this doing
nothing that that end is likely to be secured. Allow me to try and
explain this (more fully):--Heaven does nothing, and thence comes its
serenity; Earth does nothing, and thence comes its rest. By the union of
these two inactivities, all things are produced. How vast and
imperceptible is the process!--they seem to come from

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

nowhere! How imperceptible and vast!--there is no visible image of it!
All things in all their variety grow from this Inaction. Hence it is
said, 'Heaven and Earth do nothing, and yet there is nothing that they
do not do <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md).' But what man is there that
can attain to this inaction?

2\. When Kwang-dze's wife died, Hui-dze went to condole with him, and,
finding him squatted on the ground, drumming on the basin <span
id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8.md), and singing, said to him, 'When a wife has
lived with her husband, and brought up children, and then dies in her
old age, not to wail for her is enough. When you go on to drum on this
basin and sing, is it not an excessive (and strange) demonstration?'
Kwang-dze replied, 'It is not so. When she first died, was it possible
for me to be singular and not affected by the event? But I reflected on
the commencement of her being <span id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9.md). She had
not yet been born to life; not only had she no life, but she had no
bodily form; not only bad she no bodily form, but she had no breath.
During the intermingling of the waste and dark chaos <span
id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_9.md), there ensued a change, and there was
breath; another change, and there was the bodily form; another change,
and there came birth

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

and life. There is now a change again, and she is dead. The relation
between these things is like the procession of the four seasons from
spring to autumn, from winter to summer. There now she lies with her
face up, sleeping in the Great Chamber <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_10.md); and if I were to fall sobbing and going
on to wail for her, I should think that I did not understand what was
appointed (for all). I therefore restrained myself <span
id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_11.md)!'

3\. Mr. Deformed <span id="fr_13"></span>[3](#fn_12.md) and Mr.
One-foot <span id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_12.md) were looking at the
mound-graves of the departed in the wild of Khwän-lun, where Hwang-Tî
had entered into his rest. Suddenly a tumour began to grow on their left
wrists, which made them look distressed as if they disliked it. The
former said to the other, 'Do

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

you dread it?' 'No,' replied he, 'why should I dread it? Life is a
borrowed thing. The living frame thus borrowed is but so much dust. Life
and death are like day and night. And you and I were looking at (the
graves of) those who have undergone their change. If my change is coming
to me, why should I dislike it?'

4\. When Kwang-dze went to Khû, he saw an empty skull, bleached indeed,
but still retaining its shape. Tapping it with his horse-switch, he
asked it, saying, 'Did you, Sir, in your greed of life, fail in the
lessons of reason, and come to this? Or did you do so, in the service of
a perishing state, by the punishment of the axe? Or was it through your
evil conduct, reflecting disgrace on your parents and on your wife and
children? Or was it through your hard endurances of cold and hunger? Or
was it that you had completed your term of life?'

Having given expression to these questions, he took up the skull, and
made a pillow of it when he went to sleep. At midnight the skull
appeared to him in a dream, and said,' What you said to me was after the
fashion of an orator. All your words were about the entanglements of men
in their lifetime. There are none of those things after death. Would you
like to hear me, Sir, tell you about death?' 'I should,' said Kwang-dze,
and the skull resumed: 'In death there are not (the distinctions of)
ruler above and minister below. There are none of the phenomena of the
four seasons. Tranquil and at ease, our years are those of heaven and
earth. No king in his court has greater enjoyment than we have.'
Kwang-dze did not believe it, and said, 'If I

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

could get the Ruler of our Destiny <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_13.md)
to restore your body to life with its bones and flesh and skin, and to
give you back your father and mother, your wife and children, and all
your village acquaintances, would you wish me to do so?' The skull
stared fixedly at him, knitted its brows, and said, 'How should I cast
away the enjoyment of my royal court, and undertake again the toils of
life among mankind?'

5\. When Yen Yüan went eastwards to Khî, Confucius wore a look of
sorrow <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_14.md). Dze-kung left his mat, and
asked him, saying, 'Your humble disciple ventures to ask how it is that
the going eastwards of Hui to Khî has given you such a look of sadness.'
Confucius said, 'Your question is good. Formerly Kwan-dze <span
id="fr_17"></span>[3](#fn_15.md) used words of which I very much approve.
He said, "A small bag cannot be made to contain what is large; a short
rope cannot be used to draw water from a deep well <span
id="fr_18"></span>[3](#fn_15.md)." So it is, and man's appointed lot is
definitely determined, and his body is adapted for definite ends, so
that neither the one nor the other can be augmented or diminished. I am
afraid that Hui will talk with the marquis of Khî about the ways of
Hwang-Tî, Yâo, and Shun, and go on to relate the words of Sui-zän and
Shän Näng. The marquis will seek (for the correspondence of what he is
told) in himself; and, not finding

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

it there, will suspect the speaker; and that speaker, being suspected,
will be put to death. And have you not heard this?--Formerly a sea-bird
alighted in the suburban country of Lû <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_16.md). The marquis went out to meet it, (brought
it) to the ancestral temple, and prepared to banquet it there. The
Kiû-shâo <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_17.md) was performed to afford it
music; an ox, a sheep, and a pig were killed to supply the food. The
bird, however, looked at everything with dim eyes, and was very sad. It
did not venture to eat a single bit of flesh, nor to drink a single
cupful; and in three days it died.

'The marquis was trying to nourish the bird with what he used for
himself, and not with the nourishment proper for a bird. They who would
nourish birds as they ought to be nourished should let them perch in the
deep forests, or roam over sandy plains; float on the rivers and lakes;
feed on the eels and small fish; wing their flight in regular order and
then stop; and be free and at ease in their resting-places. It was a
distress to that bird to hear men speak; what did it care for all the
noise and hubbub made about it? If the music of the Kiû-shâo <span
id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_18.md) or the Hsien-khih <span
id="fr_22"></span>[4](#fn_19.md) were performed in the wild of the
Thung-thing <span id="fr_23"></span>[4](#fn_19.md) lake, birds would fly
away, and beasts would run off when they heard it, and fishes would dive
down to the bottom of the water; while men, when they hear it, would
come all round together,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

and look on. Fishes live and men die in the water. They are different in
constitution, and therefore differ in their likes and dislikes. Hence it
was that the ancient sages did not require (from all) the same ability,
nor demand the same performances. They gave names according to the
reality of what was done, and gave their approbation where it was
specially suitable. This was what was called the method of universal
adaptation and of sure success.'

6\. Lieh-dze (once) upon a journey took a meal by the road-side. There
he saw a skull a hundred years old, and, pulling away the bush (under
which it lay), he pointed to it and said, 'It is only you and I who know
that you are not dead, and that (aforetime) you were not alive. Do you
indeed really find (in death) the nourishment (which you like)? Do I
really find (in life my proper) enjoyment? The seeds (of things) are
multitudinous and minute. On the surface of the water they form a
membranous texture. When they reach to where the land and water join
they become the (lichens which we call the) clothes of frogs and
oysters. Coming to life on mounds and heights, they become the plantain;
and, receiving manure, appear as crows' feet. The roots of the crow's
foot become grubs, and its leaves, butterflies. This butterfly, known by
the name of hsü, is changed into an insect, and comes to life under a
furnace. Then it has the form of a moth, and is named the khü-to. The
khü-to after a thousand days becomes a bird, called the kan-yü-kû. Its
saliva becomes the sze-mî, and this again the shih-hsî (or
pickle-eater). The î-lo is produced from the pickle-eater; the
hwang-kwang from the

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

kiû-yû; the mâu-zui from the pû-khwan. The ying-hsî uniting with a
bamboo, which has long ceased to put forth sprouts, produces the
khing-ning; the khing-ning, the panther; the panther, the horse; and the
horse, the man. Man then again enters into the great Machinery (of
Evolution), from which all things come forth (at birth), and which they
enter at death <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_20.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[1:1](sbe4002.htm#fr_0.md) See vol. xxxix, pp. 149,
150.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[1:2](sbe4002.htm#fr_1.md) Of riches, dignities,
longevity, and their opposites, enough is said, while the other two
qualities are lightly passed over, and referred to only in connexion
with 'meritorious officers.' I can only understand them as in the
translation.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[2:1](sbe4002.htm#fr_2.md) If they did not do so,
they would be content when they had enough.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[2:2](sbe4002.htm#fr_3.md) Wishing to attach it more
closely to them.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[2:3](sbe4002.htm#fr_4.md) Wû Dze-hsü, the scourge
of Khû; and who perished miserably at last, when the king of Wû would no
longer listen to his remonstrances;--in about B.C. 475.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[3:1](sbe4002.htm#fr_5.md) This is the secret of the
Tâo.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[3:2](sbe4002.htm#fr_6.md) The last member of this
sentence is the reading adopted by Wû Khäng towards the conclusion of
the thirty-ninth chapter of the Tâo Teh King, instead of the common
<span id="img_00300"></span> ![](img/00300.jpg).

<span id="fn_7"></span>[4:1](sbe4002.htm#fr_7.md) Compare similar
statements in the Tâo Teh King, ch. 48, et al.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[4:2](sbe4002.htm#fr_8.md) The basin or tub, not 'a
basin.' The reference is, no doubt, to the basin of ice put down near or
under the couch on which the body was laid. I suppose that Kwang-dze was
squatting so as to have this between his legs.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[4:3](sbe4002.htm#fr_10.md) Is the writer referring
to the primal creation as we may call it, or development of things out
of the chaos, or to some analogous process at the birth of his wife?
However that be, birth and death appear to him to be merely changes of
the same kind in the perpetual process of evolution.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[5:1](sbe4002.htm#fr_11.md) Between heaven and
earth.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[5:2](sbe4002.htm#fr_12.md) Was it necessary he
should fall singing to his drumming on the basin? But I subjoin a note
here, suggested by the paragraph, which might have found, perhaps, a
more appropriate place in the notice of this Book in vol. xxxix, pp.
149, 150.

In Sir John F. Davis' 'Description of the Empire of China and its
Inhabitants (edition of 1857),' vol. ii, pp. 74-90, we have the amusing
story of 'The Philosopher and his Wife.' The philosopher is Kwang-dze,
who plays the part of a magician; and of his wife it might be said,
'Frailty, thy name is woman!' Sir John Davis says, 'The story was
translated into French by Père d'Entrecolles, and supplied the materials
of Voltaire's Zadig.' I have not met in Chinese with Father
d'Entrecolles' original. All of Zadig which can be supposed to have been
borrowed from his translator is only a few sentences. The whole story is
inconsistent with the account in paragraph 2 of the death of Kwang-dze's
wife, and with all which we learn from his writings of his character.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[5:3](sbe4002.htm#fr_14.md) We know nothing of
these parties but what we are told here. They are called Shû, meaning
'uncle,' often equivalent in China to our 'Mr.' The lesson taught by
them is that of submission to pain and death as merely phenomena in the
sphere of change. For the phraseology of their names, see Bk. III, par.
3, and Bk. IV, par. 8.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[7:1](sbe4002.htm#fr_15.md) I suppose the Tâo; but
none of the commentators, so far as I have seen, say anything about the
expression.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[7:2](sbe4002.htm#fr_16.md) Compare the long
discourse of Confucius with Yen Hui, on the latter's proposing to go to
Wei, in Bk. IV.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[7:3](sbe4002.htm#fr_18.md) Kwan Î-wû or Kwan Kung,
the chief minister of duke Hwan of Khî, whom he is supposed to have in
view in his 'small bag and short rope.'

<span id="fn_16"></span>[8:1](sbe4002.htm#fr_19.md) Perhaps another and
more ridiculous version of the story told in 'the Narratives of the
States,' II, i, art. 7.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[8:2](sbe4002.htm#fr_20.md) The name of Shun's
music;--see the Shû (in vol. iii), par. 2.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[8:3](sbe4002.htm#fr_21.md) Called also Tâ Shâo, in
Book XXXIII, par. 2.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[8:4](sbe4002.htm#fr_23.md) Hwang-Tî's music;--see
Bk. XIV, par. 3--But the genuineness of the whole paragraph is called in
question.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[10:1](sbe4002.htm#fr_24.md) A much larger
paragraph from which this must have been abbreviated, or which must have
been enlarged from this, is found in the first Book of Lieh-dze's works
(pp. 4, 5). In no Buddhist treatise is the transrotation of births more
fully, and, I must add, absurdly stated.
