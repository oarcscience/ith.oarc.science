## BOOK XXVII.

### PART III. SECTION V.

### Yü Yen, or 'Metaphorical Language <span id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_306.md).'

1\. Of my sentences nine in ten are metaphorical; of my illustrations
seven in ten are from valued writers. The rest of my words are like the
water that daily fills the cup, tempered and harmonised by the Heavenly
element in our nature <span id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_307.md).

The nine sentences in ten which are metaphorical are borrowed from
extraneous things to assist (the comprehension of) my argument. (When it
is said, for instance), 'A father does not act the part of matchmaker
for his own son,' (the meaning is that) 'it is better for another man to
praise the son than for his father to do so.' The use of such
metaphorical language is not my fault, but the fault of men (who would
not otherwise readily understand me).

Men assent to views which agree with their own, and oppose those which
do not so agree. Those which agree with their own they hold to be right,
and those which do not so agree they hold to be wrong. The seven out of
ten illustrations taken from valued writers are designed to put an end
to disputations. Those writers are the men of hoary eld, my predecessors
in time. But such as are unversed

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

in the warp and woof, the beginning and end of the subject, cannot be
set down as of venerable eld, and regarded as the predecessors of
others. If men have not that in them which fits them to precede others,
they are without the way proper to man, and they who are without the way
proper to man can only be pronounced defunct monuments of antiquity.

Words like the water that daily issues from the cup, and are harmonised
by the Heavenly Element (of our nature), may be carried on into the
region of the unlimited, and employed to the end of our years. But
without words there is an agreement (in principle). That agreement is
not effected by words, and an agreement in words is not effected by it.
Hence it is said, 'Let there be no words.' Speech does not need words.
One may speak all his life, and not have spoken a (right) word; and one
may not have spoken all his life, and yet all his life been giving
utterance to the (right) words. There is that which makes a thing
allowable, and that which makes a thing not allowable. There is that
which makes a thing right, and that which makes a thing not right. How
is a thing right? It is right because it is right. How is a thing wrong?
It is wrong because it is wrong. How is a thing allowable? It is
allowable because it is so. How is a thing not allowable? It is not
allowable because it is not so. Things indeed have what makes them
right, and what makes them allowable. There is nothing which has not its
condition of right; nothing which has not its condition of allowability.
But without the words of the (water-) cup in daily use, and harmonised
by the Heavenly Element (in our

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

nature), what one can continue long in the possession of these
characteristics?

All things are divided into their several classes, and succeed to one
another in the same way, though of different bodily forms. They begin
and end as in an unbroken ring, though how it is they do so be not
apprehended. This is what is called the Lathe of Heaven; and the Lathe
of Heaven is the Heavenly Element in our nature.

2\. Kwang-dze said to Hui-Sze, 'When Confucius was in his sixtieth year,
in that year his views changed <span id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_308.md).
What he had before held to be right, he now ended by holding to be
wrong; and he did not know whether the things which he now pronounced to
be right were not those which he had for fifty-nine years held to be
wrong.' Hui-dze replied, 'Confucius with an earnest will pursued the
acquisition of knowledge, and acted accordingly.' Kwang-dze rejoined,
'Confucius disowned such a course, and never said that it was his. He
said, "Man receives his powers from the Great Source <span
id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_309) (of his being.md), and he should restore
them to their (original) intelligence in his life. His singing should be
in accordance with the musical tubes, and his speech a model for
imitation. When profit and righteousness are set before him, and his
liking (for the latter) and dislike (of the

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

former), his approval and disapproval, are manifested, that only serves
to direct the speech of men (about him). To make men in heart submit,
and not dare to stand up in opposition to him; to establish the fixed
law for all under heaven:--ah! ah! I have not attained to that."'

3\. Zäng-dze twice took office, and on the two occasions his state of
mind was different. He said, 'While my parents were alive I took office,
and though my emolument was only three fû <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_310) (of grain.md), my mind was happy.
Afterwards when I took office, my emolument was three thousand
kung <span id="fr_355"></span>[2](#fn_311.md); but I could not share it
with my parents, and my mind was sad.' The other disciples asked
Kung-nî, saying, 'Such an one as Shän may be pronounced free from all
entanglement:--is he to be blamed for feeling as he did <span
id="fr_356"></span>[3](#fn_312.md)?' The reply was, 'But he was subject to
entanglement <span id="fr_357"></span>[4](#fn_313.md). If he had been free
from it, could he have had that sadness? He would have looked on his
three fû and three thousand kung no more than on a heron or a mosquito
passing before him.'

4\. Yen Khäng Dze-yû said to Tung-kwo, Dze-khî <span
id="fr_358"></span>[5](#fn_314), 'When I (had begun to.md) hear your
instructions, the first year, I continued a simple rustic; the second

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

year, I became docile; the third year, I comprehended (your teaching);
the fourth year, I was (plastic) as a thing; the fifth year, I made
advances; the sixth year, the spirit entered (and dwelt in me); the
seventh year, (my nature as designed by) Heaven was perfected; the
eighth year, I knew no difference between death and life; the ninth
year, I attained to the Great Mystery <span
id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_315.md).

'Life has its work to do, and death ensues, (as if) the common character
of each were a thing prescribed. Men consider that their death has its
cause; but that life from (the operation of) the Yang has no cause. But
is it really so? How does (the Yang) operate in this direction? Why does
it not operate there?

'Heaven has its places and spaces which can be calculated; (the
divisions of) the earth can be assigned by men. But how shall we search
for and find out (the conditions of the Great Mystery)? We do not know
when and how (life) will end, but how shall we conclude that it is not
determined (from without)? and as we do not know when and how it begins,
how should we conclude that it is not (so) determined?

'In regard to the issues of conduct which we deem appropriate, how
should we conclude that there are no spirits presiding over them; and
where those issues seem inappropriate, how should we conclude that there
are spirits presiding over them?'

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

5\. The penumbrae (once) asked the shadow <span
id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_316.md), saying, 'Formerly you were looking
down, and now you are looking up; formerly you had your hair tied up,
and now it is dishevelled; formerly you were sitting, and now you have
risen up; formerly you were walking, and now you have stopped:--how is
all this?' The shadow said, 'Venerable Sirs, how do you ask me about
such small matters? These things all belong to me, but I do not know how
they do so. I am (like) the shell of a cicada or the cast-off skin of a
snake <span id="fr_361"></span>[2](#fn_317.md);--like them, and yet not
like them. With light and the sun I make my appearance; with darkness
and the night I fade away. Am not I dependent on the substance from
which I am thrown? And that substance is itself dependent on something
else! When it comes, I come with it; when it goes, I go with it. When it
comes under the influence of the strong Yang, I come under the same.
Since we are both produced by that strong Yang, what occasion is there
for you to question me?'

6\. Yang Dze-kü <span id="fr_362"></span>[3](#fn_318.md) had gone South to
Phei <span id="fr_363"></span>[4](#fn_319.md), while Lâo Tan was travelling
in the west in Khin <span id="fr_364"></span>[5](#fn_320.md). (He
thereupon) asked (Lao-dze) to come to the border (of Phei), and went
himself to Liang, where be met him. Lâo-dze stood in the middle of the
way, and, looking up to heaven, said with a sigh, 'At first I thought
that you might be taught, but now I see that you cannot be.' Yang Dze-kü
made no reply;

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

and when they came to their lodging-house, he brought in water for the
master to wash his hands and rinse his mouth, along with a towel and
comb. He then took off his shoes outside the door, went forward on his
knees, and said, 'Formerly, your disciple wished to ask you, Master,
(the reason of what you said); but you were walking, and there was no
opportunity, and therefore I did not presume to speak. Now there is an
opportunity, and I beg to ask why you spoke as you did.' Lâo-dze
replied, 'Your eyes are lofty, and you stare;--who would live with you?
The purest carries himself as if he were soiled; the most virtuous seems
to feel himself defective.' Yang Dze-kü looked abashed and changed
countenance, saying, 'I receive your commands with reverence.'

When he first went to the lodging-house, the people of it met him and
went before him. The master of it carried his mat for him, and the
mistress brought the towel and comb. The lodgers left their mats, and
the cook his fire-place (as he passed them). When he went away, the
others in the house would have striven with him about (the places for)
their mats <span id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_321.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_306"></span>[142:1](sbe4011.htm#fr_350.md) See vol. xxxix, pp.
155, 156.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[142:2](sbe4011.htm#fr_351.md) See Bk. II, par.
10.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[144:1](sbe4011.htm#fr_352.md) Compare this with
the same language about Kü Po-yü in Bk. XXV, par. 8. There is no proof
to support our author's assertion that the views of Confucius underwent
any change.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[144:2](sbe4011.htm#fr_353.md) 'The Great Source
(Root)' here is generally explained by 'the Grand Beginning.' It is not
easy to say whether we are to understand an ideal condition of man
designed from the first, or the condition of every man as he is born
into the world. On the 'powers' received by man, see Mencius VI, i, 6.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[145:1](sbe4011.htm#fr_354.md) A fû = ten tâu and
four shing, or sixty-four shing, the shing at present being rather less
than an English pint.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[145:2](sbe4011.htm#fr_355.md) A hung = sixty-four
tâu; but there are various accounts of its size.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[145:3](sbe4011.htm#fr_356.md) This sentence is
difficult to construe.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[145:4](sbe4011.htm#fr_357.md) But Confucius could
not count his love for his parents an entanglement.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[145:5](sbe4011.htm#fr_358.md) We must suppose
this master to be the same as the Nan-kwo Dze-khî of Bk. II.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[146:1](sbe4011.htm#fr_359.md) In illustration of
the text here Lû Shû-kih refers to the use of Miâo (<span
id="img_14600"></span> ![](img/14600.jpg)) in the account of the term
'Spirit,' in the fifth Appendix to the Yî, par. 10, as meaning 'the
subtle (presence and operation of God) with all things.' Dze-yû's
further exposition of his attainments is difficult to understand fully.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[147:1](sbe4011.htm#fr_360.md) Compare Bk. II,
par. 11.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[147:2](sbe4011.htm#fr_361.md) Such is the reading
of Ziâo Hung.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[147:3](sbe4011.htm#fr_362.md) No doubt the Yang
Kû of Lieh-dze and Mencius.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[147:4](sbe4011.htm#fr_363.md) See in XIV, 26 b.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[147:5](sbe4011.htm#fr_364.md) In the borders of
Phei; can hardly be the great State.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[148:1](sbe4011.htm#fr_365.md) So had his arrogant
superciliousness given place to humility.
