## APPENDIX II.

### Yin Fû King, or 'Classic of the Harmony of the Seen and the Unseen.'

In the Khien-lung Catalogue of the Imperial Library, ch. 146, Part iii,
this Book occupies the first place among all Tâoist works, with three
notices, which all precede the account of Ho-shang Kung's Commentary on
the Tâo Teh King. From the work of Lâo-dze we are conducted along the
course of Tâoist literature to the year 1626, when the catalogue of what
is called 'the Tâoist Canon <span id="fr_574"></span>[1](#fn_506.md)'
appeared. Ch. 147 then returns to the Yin Fû King, and treats of nine
other works upon it, the last being the Commentary of Lî Kwang-lî, one
of the principal ministers and great scholars in the time of
Khien-lung's grandfather, known as Khang-hsî from the name of his reign.

In the first of these many notices it is said that the preface of an old
copy assigns the composition of the work to Hwang-Tî (in the 27th
century B.C.), and says that commentaries on it had been made by
Thâi-kung (12th century B.C.), Fan Lî (5th century B.C.), the Recluse of
the Kwei Valley (4th century B.C.), Kang Liang (died B.C. 189), Kû Ko
Liang (A.D. 181-234), and Lî Khwan of the Thang dynasty (about the
middle of our 8th century) <span id="fr_575"></span>[2](#fn_507.md). Some
writers, going back to the time of Hwang-Tî for the composition of our
small classic, attribute it not to that sovereign himself, but to his
teacher Kwang Khäng-dze <span id="fr_576"></span>[3](#fn_508.md);

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

and many of them hold that this Kwang Khäng-dze was an early incarnation
of Lâo-dze himself, so that the Yin Fû might well be placed before the
Tâo Teh King! Lî Hsî-yüeh is one of the scholars who adopt this view.

I will not say that under the Kâu dynasty there was no book called Yin
Fû, with a commentary ascribed to Thâi-kung <span
id="fr_577"></span>[1](#fn_509.md), for Sze-mâ Khien, in his biography of
Sû Khin (Bk. lxix), relates how that adventurer obtained 'the Yin Fû
book of Kâu,' and a passage in the 'Plans of the Warring States' tells
us that the book contained 'the schemes of Thâi-kung <span
id="fr_578"></span>[1](#fn_509.md).' However this may have been, no such
work is now extant. Of all the old commentaries on it mentioned in the
Khien-lung Catalogue, the only one remaining is the last,--that of Lî
Khwan; and the account which we have of it is not to be readily accepted
and relied on.

The story goes that in A.D. 441 Khâu Khien-kih, who had usurped the
dignity and title of Patriarch from the Kang family, deposited a copy of
the Yin Fû King in a mountain cave. There it remained for about three
centuries and a half, till it was discovered by Lî Khwan, a Tâoist
scholar, not a little damaged by its long exposure. He copied it out as
well as he could, but could not understand it, till at last, wandering
in the distant West, he met with an old woman, who made the meaning
clear to him, at the foot of mount Lî; after which he published the Text
with a Commentary, and finally died, a wanderer among the hills in quest
of the Tâo; but the place of his death was never known <span
id="fr_579"></span>[2](#fn_510.md).

The Classic, as it now exists, therefore cannot be traced higher than
our eighth century; and many critics hold that, as the commentary was
made by Lî Khwan, so the text was forged by him. All that Hsî-yüeh has
to say in reply to this is that, if the classic be the work of Lî Khwan,
then

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

he must think of him as another Kwang Khäng-dze; but this is no answer
to the charge of forgery.

As to the name of the Treatise, the force of Fû has been set forth in
vol. xxxix, p. 133, in connexion with the title of Kwang-dze's fifth
Book. The meaning which I have given of the whole is substantially that
of Li Hsî-yüeh, who says that the Yin must be understood as including
Yang, and grounds his criticism on the famous dictum in the Great
Appendix to the Yî King (vol. xvi, p. 355), 'The successive movement of
the Yin and Yang (their rest and active operation) constitutes what is
called the course (of things).' Mr. Balfour translates the title by 'The
Clue to the Unseen,' which is ingenious, but may be misleading. The
writer reasons rather from the Unseen to the Seen than from the Seen to
the Unseen.

Mr. Wylie gives his view of the object of the Treatise in these
words:--'This short Treatise, which is not entirely free from the
obscurity of Tâoist mysticism, professes to reconcile the decrees of
Heaven with the current of mundane affairs.' To what extent the Book
does this, and whether successfully or not, the reader will be able to
judge for himself from the translation which will be immediately
subjoined. Li Hsî-yüeh, looking at it simply from its practical object,
pronounces it 'hsiû lien kih Shû, a Book of culture and refining <span
id="fr_580"></span>[1a](#fn_511.md).' This language suggests the idea of a
Tâoist devotee, who has sublimated himself by the study of this Book
till he is ready to pass into the state of an Immortal. I must be
permitted to say, however, that the whole Treatise appears to me to have
come down to us in a fragmentary condition, with passages that are
incapable of any satisfactory explanation.

Ch. 1. 1. If one observes the Way of Heaven <span
id="fr_581"></span>[1](#fn_512.md), and maintains Its doings (as his
own) <span id="fr_582"></span>[2](#fn_513.md), all that he has to do is
accomplished.

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

2\. To Heaven there belong the five (mutual) foes <span
id="fr_583"></span>[1](#fn_514.md), and he who sees them (and understands
their operation) apprehends how they produce prosperity. The same five
foes are in the mind of man, and when he can set them in action after
the manner of Heaven, all space and time are at his disposal, and all
things receive their transformations from his person <span
id="fr_584"></span>[2](#fn_515.md).

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

3\. The nature of Heaven belongs (also) to Man; the mind of Man is a
spring (of power). When the Way of Heaven is established, the (Course
of) Man is thereby determined. <span id="fr_585"></span>[1](#fn_516.md)

4\. When Heaven puts forth its power of putting to death, the stars and
constellations lie hidden in darkness. When Earth puts forth its power
of putting to death, dragons and serpents appear on the dry ground. When
Man puts forth his power of putting to death, Heaven and Earth resume
their (proper course). When Heaven and Man exert their powers in
concert, all transformations have their commencements determined. <span
id="fr_586"></span>[4\_1](#fn_517.md)

5\. The nature (of man) is here clever and there stupid; and the one of
these qualities may lie hidden in the other. The abuse of the nine
apertures is (chiefly) in the three most important, which may be now in
movement and now at rest. When fire arises in wood, the evil, having
once begun, is sure to go on to the destruction of the wood. When

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

calamity arises in a state, if thereafter movement ensue, it is sure to
go to ruin.

When one conducts the work of culture and refining wisely we call him a
Sage. <span id="fr_587"></span>[5\_1](#fn_518.md)

2\. 1. For Heaven now to give life and now to take it away is the method
of the Tâo. Heaven and Earth are the despoilers of all things; all
things are the despoilers of Man; and Man is the despoiler of all
things. When the three despoilers act as they ought to do, as the three
Powers, they are at rest. Hence it is said, 'During the time of
nourishment, all the members are properly regulated; when the springs of
motion come into play, all transformations quietly take place.' <span
id="fr_588"></span>[1\_1](#fn_519.md)

2\. Men know the mysteriousness of the Spirit's (action), but they do
not know how what is not Spiritual comes to be so. The sun and moon have
their definite times, and their exact measures as

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

large and small. The service of the sages hereupon arises, and the
spiritual intelligence becomes apparent. <span
id="fr_589"></span>[2\_1](#fn_520.md)

3\. The spring by which the despoilers are moved is invisible and
unknown to all under the sky. When the superior man has got it, he
strengthens his body by it; when the small man has got it, he makes
light of his life. <span id="fr_590"></span>[3\_1](#fn_521.md)

3\. 1. The blind hear well, and the deaf see well. To derive all that is
advantageous from one source is ten times better than the employment of
a host; to do this thrice in a day and night is a myriad times
better. <span id="fr_591"></span>[1\_1](#fn_522.md)

2\. The mind is quickened (to activity) by (external) things, and dies
through (excessive pursuit of) them. The spring (of the mind's activity)
is in the eyes.

Heaven has no (special feeling of) kindness, but so it is that the
greatest kindness comes from It.

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

The crash of thunder and the blustering wind both come without
design. <span id="fr_592"></span>[2\_1](#fn_523.md)

3\. Perfect enjoyment is the overflowing satisfaction of the nature.
Perfect stillness is the entire disinterestedness of it. When Heaven
seems to be most wrapt up in Itself, Its operation is universal in its
character. <span id="fr_593"></span>[3\_1](#fn_524.md)

4\. It is by its breath that we control whatever creature we grasp. Life
is the root of death, and death is the root of life. Kindness springs
from injury, and injury springs from kindness. He who sinks himself in
water or enters amidst fire brings destruction on himself. <span
id="fr_594"></span>[4\_1](#fn_525.md)

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

5\. The stupid man by studying the phenomena and laws of heaven and
earth becomes sage; I by studying their times and productions become
intelligent. He in his stupidity is perplexed about sageness; I in my
freedom from stupidity am the same. He considers his sageness as being
an extraordinary attainment; I do not consider mine so. <span
id="fr_595"></span>[5\_1](#fn_526.md)

6\. The method of spontaneity proceeds in stillness, and so it was that
heaven, earth, and all things were produced. The method of heaven and
earth proceeds gently and gradually, and thus it is that the Yin and
Yang overcome (each other by turns). The one takes the place of the
other, and so change and transformation proceed accordingly. <span
id="fr_596"></span>[6\_1](#fn_527.md)

7\. Therefore the sages, knowing that the method of spontaneity cannot
be resisted, take action accordingly and regulate it (for the purpose of
culture). The way of perfect stillness cannot be subjected to numerical
calculations; but it would seem that there

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

is a wonderful machinery, by which all the heavenly bodies are produced,
the eight diagrams, and the sexagenary cycle; spirit-like springs of
power, and hidden ghostlinesses; the arts of the Yin and Yang in the
victories of the one over the other:--all these come brightly forward
into visibility. <span id="fr_597"></span>[7\_1](#fn_528.md)

<span id="fn_511"></span>[257:1a](sbe4020.htm#fr_580.md) Dr. Williams
explains 'hsiû lien (<span id="img_25700"></span> ![](img/25700.jpg) or
<span id="img_25701"></span> ![](img/25701.jpg))' as meaning 'becoming
religious, as a recluse or ascetic.'

<span id="fn_512"></span>[257:1](sbe4020.htm#fr_581.md) To explain 'the Way
of Heaven,' Lî Hsî-yüeh adduces the last sentence of the T. T. K., ch.
9, 'When the work is done, and one's name has become distinguished, to
withdraw into obscurity is the Way of Heaven.'

<span id="fn_513"></span>[257:2](sbe4020.htm#fr_582.md) To explain 'the
doings of Heaven,' he adduces the first paragraph of the symbolism of
the first hexagram of the Yî, 'Heaven in its motion gives the idea of
strength. In accordance with this, the superior man nerves himself to
ceaseless activity.'

<span id="fn_514"></span>[258:1](sbe4020.htm#fr_583.md) The startling name
thieves (= foes, robbers) here is understood to mean the 'five
elements,' which pervade and indeed make up the whole realm of nature,
the heaven of the text including also earth, the other term in the
binomial combination of 'heaven and earth.' According to the Tâoist
teaching, the element of Earth generates Metal, and overcomes Water;
Metal generates Water, and overcomes Wood; Water generates Wood, and
overcomes Fire; Wood generates Fire, and overcomes Earth. These elements
fight and strive together, now overcoming, now overcome, till by such
interaction a harmony of their influences arises, and production goes on
with vigour and beauty.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[258:2](sbe4020.htm#fr_584.md) It is more
difficult to give an account of the operation of the five elements in
the mind of man, though I have seen them distributed among the five
viscera, and the five virtues of Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety,
Knowledge, and Faith. Granting, however, their presence and operation in
the mind, what shall be said on the two concluding members of the
paragraph? There underlies them <span id="page_259">p. 259</span> the
doctrine of the three coordinate Powers;--Heaven, Earth, and Man, which
I have never been able to comprehend clearly.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[259:1](sbe4020.htm#fr_585.md) These short and
enigmatic sentences seem merely to affirm the general subject of the
Treatise,--the harmony between the unseen and the seen.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[259:4\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_586.md) 'The power of
putting to death here' seems merely to indicate the 'rest' which
succeeds to movement. The paragraph is intended to show us the harmony
of the Three Powers, but one only sees its meaning darkly. The language
of the third sentence about the influence of Man on Heaven and Earth
finds its explanation from the phraseology of the thwan of the
twenty-fourth hexagram of the Yî (vol. xvi, pp. 107, 108).

<span id="fn_518"></span>[260:5\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_587.md) The constitution
of man is twofold;--his mental constitution, quiet and restful, and his
physical constitution, restless and fond of movement. The nine apertures
are the eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, and the lower parts, and of these
the eyes, ears, and mouth are the most important; but they all need to
be kept in subjection and under restraint. If indulged beyond reason,
the ruin of themselves and of the mind and body to which they belong is
sure to ensue.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[260:1\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_588.md) Compare ch. I,
par. 2. The mutual contention of the five elements in nature only
conduces to the nourishment of all its parts; and so man, as one of the
three Powers, consumes only to increase his store, and throws down only
to build up.

Where the concluding quotation is taken from is not known. Of course any
quotation is inconsistent with the idea of the early origin of the
Treatise.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[261:2\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_589.md) Compare par. 10
in the fifth Appendix to the Yî King.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[261:3\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_590.md) The thing is
good in itself, but its effect will be according to the character of its
user, and of the use which is made of it.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[261:1\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_591.md) That the loss of
one sense may be in a manner compensated for by the greater cultivation
of another,--in the case especially of the two senses specified,--is a
fact; but I fail to perceive how this is illustrated by what follows in
the rest of the paragraph. The illustration is taken from the seventh of
the hexagrams in the Yî, but I have not discovered the nexus of it in
the text of that classic or in the Appendixes on the thwan or hsiang of
the hexagram.

It must be from this paragraph that the bearing of the Treatise on the
conduct of military operations has been maintained.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[262:2\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_592.md) Mr. Balfour
translates the first member here by--'The mind is produced from matter
and dies with matter; the working faculty is in the eye;' and says that
it embodies a bold denial of any future life, or the existence of
spirit, apart from matter. The meaning of the Text, however, is only
what I have given;--is moral and not metaphysical. The eye is singled
out from the three most important apertures of the body in ch. I, par.
5.

The rest of the paragraph has its parallelisms in Lâo-dze and Kwang-dze.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[262:3\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_593.md) A sequel to the
preceding paragraph. Lî Hsî-yüeh observes that the having no feeling of
kindness is equivalent to Lâo-dze's 'doing nothing.' See the T. T. K.,
ch. 35, 'The Tâo does nothing, and so there is nothing which It does not
do.'

<span id="fn_525"></span>[262:4\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_594.md) The first member
of this paragraph is very difficult to construe. Mr. Balfour gives for
it:--'The Laws affecting the animal creation reside in the Breath or
Vital Fluid.' The first character of it properly denotes 'birds.' It is
often found with another denoting 'quadrupeds;' and again it is found
alone denoting both birds and beasts. It is also interchanged with
another of the same name, denoting to <span id="page_263">p. 263</span>
seize or grasp,' in which meaning I have taken it; but the bearing of
the saying on the general meaning of the Treatise I have not
apprehended.

The next four sayings are illustrations of Lâo-dze's 'contraries' of
Tâoism. The final saying is a truism;--is it introduced here as
illustrating that whatever is done with design is contrary to the Tâo?

<span id="fn_526"></span>[263:5\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_595.md) Some scholars
have expunged this paragraph as not being genuine; it is certainly
difficult to construe and to understand.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[263:6\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_596.md) Kû Hsî praises
this paragraph as very good, and the use of the character Zin ('proceeds
gently and gradually') as exquisite. After all, what do we learn from
it? That Creation proceeded without striving or crying? And that the
same Creative Power continues to act in the same way?

<span id="fn_528"></span>[264:7\_1](sbe4020.htm#fr_597.md) I cannot say
that I fully understand this concluding paragraph of the Yin Fû King.
One thing is plain from it,--how the Yî King was pressed into the
service of the Tâoism that prevailed when it was written. I leave it
with the judgment on it, quoted by Lî Hsî-yüeh from a Lû Zhien-hsü. 'The
subject-matter of the Yin Fû and Tâo Teh is all intended to set forth
the action by contraries of the despoiling powers in nature and society.
As to finding in them directions for the government of states, the
conduct of war, and the mastery of the kingdom, with such expressions as
those about a wonderful machinery by which the heavenly bodies are
produced, the eight diagrams, the cycle, spirit-like springs, and hidden
ghostlinesses:--they all have a deep meaning, but men do not know it.
They who go to the Yin Fû for direction in war and use Lâo-dze for
guidance in government go far astray from the meaning of both.'
