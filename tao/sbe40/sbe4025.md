## APPENDIX VII.

### I.

### THE STONE TABLET IN THE TEMPLE OF LÂO-DZE. BY HSIEH TÂO-HÄNG OF THE SUI DYNASTY <span id="fr_606"></span>[1](#fn_537.md).

1\. After the Thâi Ki (or Primal Ether) commenced its action, the
earliest period of time began to be unfolded.

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

The curtain of the sky was displayed, and the sun and moon were
suspended in it; the four-cornered earth was established, and the
mountains and streams found their places in it. Then the subtle
influences (of the Ether) operated like the heaving of the breath, now
subsiding and again expanding; the work of production went on in its
seasons above and below; all things were formed as from materials, and
were matured and maintained. There were the (multitudes of the) people;
there were their rulers and superiors.

2\. As to the august sovereigns of the highest antiquity, living as in
nests on trees in summer, and in caves in winter, silently and
spirit-like they exercised their wisdom. Dwelling like quails, and
drinking (the rain and dew) like newly-hatched birds, they had their
great ceremonies like the great terms of heaven and earth, not requiring
to be regulated by the dishes and stands; and (also) their great music
corresponding to the common harmonies of heaven and earth, not needing
the guidance of bells and drums.

3\. By and by there came the loss of the Tâo, when its Characteristics
took its place. They in their turn were lost, and then came Benevolence.
Under the Sovereigns and Kings that followed, now more slowly and anon
more rapidly, the manners of the people, from being good and simple,
became bad and mean. Thereupon came the Literati and the Mohists with
their confused contentions; names and

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

rules were everywhere diffused. The 300 rules <span
id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_538.md) of ceremony could not control men's
natures; the 3000 rules <span id="fr_608"></span>[1](#fn_538.md) of
punishment were not sufficient to put a stop to their treacherous
villanies. But he who knows how to cleanse the current of a stream
begins by clearing out its source, and he who would straighten the end
of a process must commence with making its beginning correct. Is not the
Great Tâo the Grand Source and the Grand Origin of all things?

4\. The Master Lâo was conceived under the influence of a star. Whence
he received the breath (of life) we cannot fathom, but he pointed to the
(plum-) tree (under which he was born), and adopted it as his
surname <span id="fr_609"></span>[2](#fn_539.md); we do not
understand <span id="fr_610"></span>[2](#fn_539.md) whence came the musical
sounds (that were heard), but he kept his marvellous powers concealed in
the womb for more than seventy years. When he was born, the hair on his
head was already white, and he took the designation of 'The Old Boy' (or
Lâo-dze). In his person, three gateways and two (bony) pillars formed
the distinctive marks of his ears and eyes; two of the symbols for five,
and ten brilliant marks were left by the wonderful tread of his feet and
the grasp of his hands. From the time of Fû-hsî down to that of the Kâu
dynasty, in uninterrupted succession, dynasty after dynasty, his person
appeared, but with changed names. In the times of kings Wän and Wû he
discharged the duties, (first), of Curator of the Royal Library <span
id="fr_611"></span>[3](#fn_540), and (next.md), of the Recorder under the
Pillar <span id="fr_612"></span>[3](#fn_540.md). Later on in that dynasty
he filled different offices, but did

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

not change his appearance. As soon as Hsüan Nî <span
id="fr_613"></span>[1](#fn_541.md) saw him, he sighed over him as 'the
Dragon,' whose powers are difficult to be known <span
id="fr_614"></span>[2](#fn_542). Yin (Hsî), keeper of the (frontier.md)
gate, keeping his eyes directed to every quarter, recognised 'the True
Man' as he was hastening into retirement. (By Yin Hsî he was prevailed
on) to put forth his extraordinary ability, and write his Book in two
Parts <span id="fr_615"></span>[3](#fn_543.md),--to lead the nature (of
man) back to the Tâo, and celebrating the usefulness of 'doing nothing.'
The style of it is very condensed, and its reasoning deep and
far-reaching, The hexagram which is made up of the 'dragons on the
wing <span id="fr_616"></span>[4](#fn_544.md)' is not to be compared with
it in exquisite subtlety. (The Zo Kwan) which ends with the capture of
the Lin, does not match it in its brightness and obscurity. If employed
to regulate the person, the spirit becomes clear and the will is still.
If employed to govern the state, the people return to simplicity, and
become sincere and good. When one goes on to refine his body in
accordance with it, the traces of material things are rolled away from
it; in rainbow-hued robes and mounted on a stork he goes forwards and
backwards to the purple palace; on its juice of gold and wine of
jade <span id="fr_617"></span>[5](#fn_545.md) he feasts in the beautiful
and pure capital. He is lustrous as the sun and moon; his ending and
beginning are those of heaven and earth. He who crosses its stream,
drives away the dust and noise of the world; he who finds its gate,
mounts prancing up on the misty clouds. It is not for the ephemeral fly
to know the fading and luxuriance of the Tâ-khun <span
id="fr_618"></span>[6](#fn_546.md), or for a Fäng-î <span
id="fr_619"></span>[7](#fn_547.md) to fathom the depth of an Arm of the
sea. Vast indeed (is the Tâo)! words are not sufficient to describe its
excellence and powers!

5\. Kwang Kâu tells us, that, 'when Lâo Tan died,

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

Khin Shih went to condole (with his son), but after crying out three
times, immediately left the house <span
id="fr_620"></span>[1](#fn_548.md).' This was what is called the punishment
for his neglecting his Heaven (-implanted nature), and although it
appears as one of the metaphorical illustrations of the supercilious
officer, yet there is some little indication in the passage of the
reappearance of the snake after casting its exuviae <span
id="fr_621"></span>[2](#fn_549.md).

\[At this point the author leaves the subject of the Tâo and its
prophet, and enters on a long panegyric of the founder of the Sui
dynasty and his achievements. This sovereign was the emperor Wän (<span
id="img_31500"></span> ![](img/31500.jpg)) the founder of Sui (<span
id="img_31501"></span> ![](img/31501.jpg)), originally Yang Kien, a
scion of the House of Sui, a principality whose name remains in Sui-kâu,
of the department Teh-an in Hû Pei. He was certainly the ablest man in
the China of his day, and deserves a portion of the praise with which
Mr. Hsieh celebrates him after his extravagant fashion. He claimed the
throne from the year 581. While doing honour to Confucianism, he did not
neglect the other two religions in the empire, Tâoism and Buddhism; and
having caused the old temple of Lâo-dze to be repaired in grand style in
586, he commissioned Hsieh Tâo-häng to superintend the setting up in it
a commemorative Tablet of stone.

I pass over all this, which is related at great length, and proceed to
give the inscription. It occupies no fewer than 352 characters in 88
lines, each consisting of four characters. The lines are arranged in
what we may call eleven stanzas of equal length, the second, fourth,
sixth, and eighth lines of each rhyming together. There is a good deal
of art in the metrical composition. In the first six stanzas the rhyming
finals are in the even tone and one of the deflected tones alternately.
In the last five stanzas this arrangement is reversed. The rhymes in 7,
9, and 11 are deflected, and in 8 and 10 even. The measure of four
characters is the most common in the Shih King or Ancient Book of
Poetry.

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

\[paragraph continues\] It continued to be a favourite down to the Thang
dynasty, after which it fell very much into disuse. Through the many
assonances of the Chinese characters, and the attention paid to the
tones, we have in Chinese composition much of the art of rhyming, but
comparatively little of the genius of poetry.\]

### II.

#### THE INSCRIPTION.

St. 1. Back in the depths of ancient time;  
Remote, before the Tîs began;  
Four equal sides defined the earth,  
And pillars eight the heaven sustained.  
All living things in classes came,  
The valleys wide, and mighty streams.  
The Perfect Tâo, with movement wise,  
Unseen, Its work did naturally.

St. 2. Its power the elements <span id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_550.md) all
felt;  
The incipient germs of things <span id="fr_623"></span>[2](#fn_551.md)
appeared.  
Shepherd and Lord established were,  
And in their hands the ivory bonds <span
id="fr_624"></span>[3](#fn_552.md).  
The Tîs must blush before the Hwangs <span
id="fr_625"></span>[4](#fn_553.md);  
The Wangs must blush before the Tîs <span
id="fr_626"></span>[4](#fn_553.md).  
More distant grew Tâo's highest gifts,  
And simple ways more rare became.

St. 3. The still placidity was gone,  
And all the old harmonious ways.  
Men talents prized, and varnished wit;  
The laws displayed proved but a net.

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

Wine-cups and stands the board adorned,  
And shields and spears the country filled.  
The close-meshed nets the fishes scared:  
And numerous bows the birds alarmed.

St. 4. Then did the True Man <span id="fr_627"></span>[1](#fn_554.md) get
his birth,  
As 'neath the Bear the star shone down <span
id="fr_628"></span>[2](#fn_555.md).  
All dragon gifts his person graced;  
Like the stork's plumage was his hair.  
The complicated he resolved <span id="fr_629"></span>[3](#fn_556.md), the
sharp made blunt <span id="fr_630"></span>[3](#fn_556.md),  
The mean rejected, and the generous chose;  
In brightness like the sun and moon,  
And lasting as the heaven and earth <span
id="fr_631"></span>[3](#fn_556.md).

St. 5. Small to him seemed the mountains five <span
id="fr_632"></span>[4](#fn_557.md),  
And narrow seemed the regions nine <span
id="fr_633"></span>[4](#fn_557.md);  
About he went with lofty tread,  
And in short time he rambled far.  
In carriage by black oxen drawn <span id="fr_634"></span>[5](#fn_558.md),  
Around the purple air was bright.  
Grottoes then oped to him their sombre gates,  
And thence, unseen, his spirit power flowed forth.

St. 6. The village near the stream of Ko <span
id="fr_635"></span>[6](#fn_559.md)  
Traces of him will still retain <span id="fr_636"></span>[6](#fn_559.md);  
But now, as in the days of old,  
With changèd times the world is changed.

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

His stately temple fell to ruin  
His altar empty was and still;  
By the nine wells dryandras grew <span
id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_560.md),  
And the twin tablets were but heaps of stone.

St. 7. But when our emperor was called to rule,  
All spirit-like and sage was he.  
Earth's bells reverberated loud,  
And light fell on the heavenly mirror down.  
The universe in brightness shone,  
And portents all were swept away;  
(All souls), or bright or dark <span id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_561.md),
revered,  
And spirits came to take from him their law.

St. 8. From desert sands <span id="fr_639"></span>[3](#fn_562.md) and where
the great trees grow <span id="fr_640"></span>[3](#fn_562.md),  
From phoenix caves, and from the dragon woods,  
All different creatures came sincere;  
Men of all regions gave their hearts to him.  
Their largest vessels brought their gifts,  
And kings their rarest things described;  
Black clouds a thousand notes sent forth;  
And in the fragrant winds were citherns heard <span
id="fr_641"></span>[4](#fn_563.md).

St. 9. Through his transforming power, the tripods were made sure;  
And families became polite and courteous.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

Ever kept he in mind (the sage) beneath the Pillar <span
id="fr_642"></span>[1](#fn_564.md),  
Still emulous of the sovereigns most ancient <span
id="fr_643"></span>[2](#fn_565.md).  
So has he built this pure temple,  
And planned its stately structure;  
Pleasant, with hills and meadows around,  
And lofty pavilion with its distant prospect.

St. 10. Its beams are of plum-tree, its ridge-pole of cassia;  
A balustrade winds round it; many are its pillars;  
About them spreads and rolls the fragrant smoke <span
id="fr_644"></span>[3](#fn_566.md);  
Cool and pure are the breezes and mists.  
The Immortal officers come to their places <span
id="fr_645"></span>[4](#fn_567.md);  
The Plumaged guests are found in its court <span
id="fr_646"></span>[4](#fn_567.md),  
Numerous and at their ease,  
They send down blessing, bright and efficacious.

St. 11. Most spirit-like, unfathomable,  
(Tâo's) principles abide, with their symbolism attached <span
id="fr_647"></span>[5](#fn_568.md).  
Loud is Its note, but never sound emits <span
id="fr_648"></span>[6](#fn_569.md),  
Yet always it awakes the highest echoes.  
From far and near men praise It;  
In the shades, and in the realms of light, they look up for Its aid;  
Reverently have we graven and gilt this stone  
And made our lasting proclamation thereby to heaven and earth.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_537"></span>[311:1](sbe4025.htm#fr_606.md) Hsieh Tâo-häng
<span id="img_31100"></span> ![](img/31100.jpg), called also Hsüan-khing
(<span id="img_31101"></span> ![](img/31101.jpg)), was one of the most
famous scholars and able ministers of the Sui dynasty (581-618), and
also an eloquent writer. His biography is given at considerable length
in the fifty-seventh chapter of the Books of Sui.

For about 200 years after the end of the Zin dynasty, the empire had
been in a very divided and distracted state. The period is known as the
epoch of 'The Southern and Northern Dynasties,' no fewer than nine or
ten of which co-existed, none of them able to assert a universal sway
till the rise of Sui. The most powerful of them towards the end of the
time was 'The Northern Kâu,' in connexion with the Wû-khäng (<span
id="img_31102"></span> ![](img/31102.jpg)) reign of which (558-561) the
name of our Hsieh first appears. In the Wû-phing (<span
id="img_31103"></span> ![](img/31103.jpg)) reign of 'The Northern Khî
(570 ,576),' we find him member of a committee for revising the rules of
'The Five Classes of Ceremonial Observances,' and gaining distinction as
a poet.

When the emperor Wän (<span id="img_31104"></span> ![](img/31104.jpg)),
by name Yang Kien (<span id="img_31105"></span> ![](img/31105.jpg)), a
scion of the ruling House of Sui, a small principality in the present
Hû-pei, and founder of the dynasty so called, had succeeded in putting
down the various conflicting dynasties, and claimed the sovereignty of
the empire in 581, Hsieh freely yielded his allegiance to him, and was
employed in the conduct of various affairs. The important paper, of the
translation of the greater part of which a translation is here
attempted, was the outcome of one of them. Wän Tî regularly observed the
Confucian worship of God, but also kept up the ceremonies of Buddhism
and Taoism. Having repaired the dilapidated temple of Lâo-dze at his
birth-place, he required from Hsieh an inscription for the commemorative
tablet in it, the composition of which is referred to the year 586, 'the
sixth year of Sui's rule over all beneath the sky.'

Hsieh appears to have been a favourite with the emperor Wän, but when
Wän was succeeded in 605 by his son, known as Yang Tî (<span
id="img_31106"></span> ![](img/31106.jpg)),his relations with <span
id="page_312">p. 312</span> the throne became less happy. Offended by a
memorial which Hsieh presented, and the ground of offence in which we
entirely fail to perceive, the emperor ordered him to put an end to
himself. Hsieh was surprised by the sentence, and hesitated to comply
with it, on which an executioner was sent to strangle him. Thus ended
the life of Hsieh Tâo-häng in his seventieth year. His death was
regretted and resented, we are told, by the people generally. A
collection of his writings was made in seventy chapters, and was widely
read. I do not know to what extent these have been preserved; if many of
them have been lost, and the paper, here in part submitted to the
reader, were a fair specimen of the others, the loss must be pronounced
to be great. Of this paper I have had two copies before me in
translating it. One of them is in Ziâo Hung's 'Wings to Lao-dze;' the
other is in 'The Complete Works of the Ten Philosophers.' Errors of the
Text occur now in the one copy, now in the other. From the two combined
a Text, which must be exactly correct or nearly so, is made out.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[313:1](sbe4025.htm#fr_608.md) Compare vol.
xxviii, p. 323; par. 38.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[313:2](sbe4025.htm#fr_610.md) Li (<span
id="img_31300"></span> ![](img/31300.jpg)), a plum-tree. For this and
many of the other prodigies mentioned by Hsieh, see what Julien calls
'The Fabulous Legend of Lâo-dze,' and has translated in the Introduction
to his version of the Tâo The King. Others of them are found in the
Historical, or rather Legendary, Introduction in the 'Collection of
Tâoist Treatises,' edited by Lû Yü in 1877.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[313:3](sbe4025.htm#fr_612.md) The meaning of the
former of these offices may be considered as settled;--see the Dote in
Wang Kän-kâi's edition of the 'Historical Records (1870),' under the
Biography of Lâo-dze. The nature of the second office is not so clearly
ascertained. It was, I apprehend, more of a literary character than the
curatorship.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[314:1](sbe4025.htm#fr_613.md) Confucius, who was
styled after the beginning of our era for several centuries 'Duke Nî,
the Illustrious.'

<span id="fn_542"></span>[314:2](sbe4025.htm#fr_614.md) See vol. xxxix, pp.
34, 35.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[314:3](sbe4025.htm#fr_615.md) See vol. xxxix, p.
35.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[314:4](sbe4025.htm#fr_616.md) The Khien or first
of all the hexagrams of the Yî King; but the sentence is to be
understood of all the hexagrams,--of the Yî as a whole.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[314:5](sbe4025.htm#fr_617.md) Compare Pope's
line, 'The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew.'

<span id="fn_546"></span>[314:6](sbe4025.htm#fr_618.md) Vol. xxxix, p. 166.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[314:7](sbe4025.htm#fr_619.md) Vol. xxxix, p. 244.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[315:1](sbe4025.htm#fr_620.md) Vol. xxxix, p. 201.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[315:2](sbe4025.htm#fr_621.md) Referring, I
suppose, to the illustration of the fire and the faggots.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[316:1](sbe4025.htm#fr_622.md) 'The five
essences;' meaning, I think, the subtle power and operation of the five
elements.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[316:2](sbe4025.htm#fr_623.md) So Williams, under
Wei (<span id="img_31600"></span> ![](img/31600.jpg)). See also the
Khang-hsî Thesaurus under the phrase <span id="img_31601"></span>
![](img/31601.jpg).

<span id="fn_552"></span>[316:3](sbe4025.htm#fr_624.md) 'Bonds' with
written characters on them superseded the 'knotted cords' of the
primitive age. That the material of the bonds should be, as here
represented, slips of ivory, would seem to anticipate the progress of
society.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[316:4](sbe4025.htm#fr_626.md) The Hwangs (<span
id="img_31602"></span> ![](img/31602.jpg)) preceded the Tîs in the
Tâoistic genesis of history; and as being more simple were Tâoistically
superior to them; so it was with the Tîs and the Wangs or Kings.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[317:1](sbe4025.htm#fr_627.md) This of course was
Lâo-dze.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[317:2](sbe4025.htm#fr_628.md) See above, [p.
313](#page_313.md), par. 4.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[317:3](sbe4025.htm#fr_631.md) In the Tâo Teh
King, p. 50, par. 2, and p. 52, par. 1. The reading of line 7 is
different in my two authorities in the one <span id="img_31700"></span>
![](img/31700.jpg), in the other <span id="img_31701"></span>
![](img/31701.jpg) suppose the correct reading should be <span
id="img_31702"></span> ![](img/31702.jpg) and have given what I think is
the meaning.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[317:4](sbe4025.htm#fr_633.md) Two well-known
numerical categories. See Mayers's Manual, pp. 320, 321, and p. 340.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[317:5](sbe4025.htm#fr_634.md) So it was,
according to the story, that Lâo-dze drew near to the barrier gate, when
he wished to leave China.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[317:6](sbe4025.htm#fr_636.md) The Ko is a river
flowing from Ho-nan into An-hui, and falling into the Hwâi, not far from
the district city of Hwâi-yüan. It enters the one province from the
other in the small department of Po (<span id="img_31703"></span>
![](img/31703.jpg)), in which, according to a Chinese map in my
possession, Lâo-dze was born. The Khang-hsî Thesaurus also gives a
passage to the effect that the temple of his mother was hereabouts, at a
bend in the Ko.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[318:1](sbe4025.htm#fr_637.md) The nine wells, or
bubbling springs, near the village where Lao was born, are mentioned by
various writers; but I fail to see how the growth of the trees about
them indicated the ruin of his temple.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[318:2](sbe4025.htm#fr_638.md) I have introduced
the 'all souls' in this line, because of the <span
id="img_31800"></span> ![](img/31800.jpg) in the second character.
Williams defines the first character, yao as 'the effulgence of the
sun,' and of 'heavenly bodies generally;' the second (<span
id="img_31801"></span> ![](img/31801.jpg)) is well known as meaning 'the
animal soul,' and 'the dark disk of the moon.' The Thesaurus, however,
explains the two characters together as a name for the pole star (<span
id="img_31802"></span> ![](img/31802.jpg); see Analects I, i); and
perhaps I had better have followed this meaning.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[318:3](sbe4025.htm#fr_640.md) The 'desert sands'
were, no doubt, what we call 'the desert of Gobi.' The trees referred to
were 'in the extreme East.' The combination phan-mû is not described
more particularly.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[318:4](sbe4025.htm#fr_641.md) This and the three
preceding lines are not a little dark.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[319:1](sbe4025.htm#fr_642) 'The (sage.md) beneath
the Pillar' must be Lâo-dze. See above in the Introductory notice, [p.
313](#page_313.md).

<span id="fn_565"></span>[319:2](sbe4025.htm#fr_643.md) See the note on the
meaning of the epithet <span id="img_31900"></span> ![](img/31900.jpg)
vol. xxxix, p. 40.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[319:3](sbe4025.htm#fr_644.md) 'The smoke,' I
suppose, 'of the incense, and from the offerings.'

<span id="fn_567"></span>[319:4](sbe4025.htm#fr_646.md) Tâoist monks are
called 'Plumaged or Feathered Scholars (<span id="img_31901"></span>
![](img/31901.jpg)),' from the idea that by their discipline and pills,
they can emancipate themselves from the trammels of the material body,
and ascend (fly up) to heaven. Arrived there, as Immortals or Hsien
