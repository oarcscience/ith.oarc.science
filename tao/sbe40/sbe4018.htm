<P><A NAME="fn_456"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_515">235:2</A> This paragraph, after the first three characters, is found in the Zo Khwan, under the tenth and eleventh notices in the twenty-third year of duke Hsiang (B.C. 549),--part of an address to a young nobleman by the officer Min Dze-m&acirc;. The only difference in the two texts is in one character which does not affect the meaning. Thus the text of this T&acirc;oist treatise is taken from a source which cannot be regarded as T&acirc;oistic.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_457"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_516">235:3</A> This seems equivalent to 'all through space.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_458"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_517">235:4</A> The swan in the text here seems to mean 'the whole of the allotted term of life.' Further on, the same character has the special meaning of 'a period of a hundred days.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_459"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_518">236:1</A> This and other passages show how T&acirc;oism pressed astrology into its service.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_460"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_519">236:2</A> The Northern Peck or Bushel is the Chinese name of our constellation of the Great Bear, the Chariot of the Supreme Ruler.' The three pairs of stars, &#0953, &#0954; &#0955, &#0956; &#0957, &#0958, are called the upper, middle, and lower Th&acirc;i, or 'their three Eminences:' see Reeves's Names of Stars and Constellations, appended to Morrison's Dictionary, part ii, vol. i.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_461"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_520">236:3</A> The Khang-hs&icirc; Dictionary simply explains san shih as 'the name of a spirit;' but the phrase is evidently plural. The names and places of the three spirits are given, and given differently. Why should we look for anything definite and satisfactory in a notion which is merely an absurd superstition?</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_462"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_521">236:4</A> K&auml;ng-sh&auml;n is the name of the fifty-seventh term of the cycle, indicating every fifty-seventh day, or year. Here it indicates the day.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_463"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_522">236:5</A> The name of this spirit of the fire-place is given by commentators with many absurd details which need not be touched on.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_464"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_523">236:6</A> Long life is still the great quest of the T&acirc;oist.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_465"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_524">237:1</A> In its widest meaning:--Men, creatures, and all living things.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_466"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_525">237:2</A> Here are the happy issues of doing good in addition to long life;--compare the T&acirc;o Teh King, ch. 50, et al.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_467"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_528">238:1</A> Here there appears: the influence of Buddhism on the doctrine of the T&acirc;o. The Rishis of Buddhism are denoted in Chinese by Hsien Z&auml;n (<A NAME="img_23800"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/23800.jpg">), which, for want of a better term, we translate by 'Immortals.' The famous N&acirc;g&acirc;rguna, the fourteenth Buddhist patriarch, counts ten classes of these Rishis, and ascribes to them only a temporary exemption for a million years from transmigration, but Chinese Buddhists and T&acirc;oists view them as absolutely immortal, and distinguish five classes:--first, Deva Rishis, or Heavenly Hsien, residing on the seven concentric rocks round Meru; second, Purusha, or Spirit-like Hsien, roaming through the air; third, Nara, or Human Hsien, dwelling among men; fourth, Bh&ucirc;mi, or Earth Hsien, residing on earth in caves; and fifth, Preta, or Demon Hsien, roving demons. See Eitel's Handbook to Chinese Buddhism, second edition, p. 130. In this place three out of the five classes are specified, each having its own price in good deeds.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_468"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_529">238:2</A> Literally, 'those born before himself,' but generally used as a designation of teachers.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_469"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_530">239:1</A> A Confucian phrase. See the L&icirc; K&icirc;, III, v, 13.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_470"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_531">239:2</A> One is sorry not to see his way to translate here--'Assails and oppresses those who pursue the T&acirc;o and its characteristics.' Julien gives for it--'Insulter et traiter avec cruaut&eacute; ceux qui se livrent &agrave; l'&eacute;tude de la Raison et de la Vertu.' Watters <A NAME="page_240"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 240</FONT></A> has--'Insults and oppresses (those who have attained to the practice of) Truth and Virtue.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_471"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_532">240:1</A> It is a serious mistranslation of this which Mr. Balfour gives:--'returns evil for good,' as if it were the golden rule in its highest expression.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_472"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_533">240:2</A> Literally, 'separates men's bones and flesh.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_473"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_534">241:1</A> The crimes indicated here are said to have become rife under the Han dynasty, when the arts of sorcery and witchcraft were largely employed to the injury of men.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_474"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_535">243:1</A> The one illustrative story given by Julien under this clause shows clearly that I have rightly supplemented it. He translates it:--'Faire des impr&eacute;cations contre soi-m&ecirc;me et contre les autres.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_475"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_537">243:2</A> Trifling acts and villainous crimes are here mixed together.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_477"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_539">244:2</A> Many of the deeds condemned in this long paragraph have a ground of reason for their condemnation; others are merely offences against prevailing superstitions.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_478"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_540">244:3</A> The principle enunciated here is very ancient in the history of the ethical teaching of China. It appears in one of the Appendixes to the Y&icirc; King (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xvi, p. 419), 'The family that accumulates goodness is sure to have superabundant happiness; the family that accumulates evil is sure to have superabundant misery.' We know also that the same view prevailed in the time of Confucius, though the sage himself does not expressly sanction it. This Tractate does not go for the issues of Retribution beyond the present life.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_479"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_541">245:1</A> These sentences are rather weak. Nothing is said of any recompense to the parties who have been robbed. The thief is punished by the death of others, or the loss of property.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_480"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_542">245:2</A> A somewhat perplexing sentence. Julien gives for it:--'Ceux qui font p&eacute;rir des hommes innocens ressemblent &agrave; des ennemis qui &eacute;changent leurs armes et se tuent les uns les autres;' and Watters:--'Those who put others to death wrongly are like men who exchange arms and slay each other.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_481"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_543">245:3</A> Literally, 'soaked food that has been spoiled by dripping water.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_482"></A><A HREF="sbe4018.htm#fr_545">246:1</A> The effect of repentance and reformation is well set forth; but the specification of three years, as the period within which the recompense or retribution will occur, is again an indication of the weakness in this concluding paragraph.</P>
