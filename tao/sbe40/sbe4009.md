## BOOK XXV.

### PART III. SECTION III.

### Zeh-yang <span id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_242.md).

1\. Zeh-yang having travelled to Khû, Î Kieh <span
id="fr_283"></span>[2](#fn_243.md) spoke of him to the king, and then,
before the king had granted him an interview, (left him, and) returned
home. Zeh-yang went to see Wang Kwo <span
id="fr_284"></span>[3](#fn_244.md), and said to him, 'Master, why do you
not mention me to the king?' Wang Kwo replied, 'I am not so good a
person to do that as Kung-yüeh Hsiû <span
id="fr_285"></span>[4](#fn_245.md).' 'What sort of man is he?' asked the
other, and the reply was, 'In winter he spears turtles in the Kiang, and
in summer he rests in shady places on the mountain. When passers-by ask
him (what he is doing there), he says, "This is my abode." Since Î Kieh
was not able to induce the king to see you, how much less should I, who
am not equal to him, be able to do so! Î Kieh's character is this:--he
has no (real) virtue, but he has knowledge. If you do not freely yield
yourself to him, but employ him to carry on his spirit-like influence
(with you), you will certainly get upset and benighted in the region of
riches and honours. His help will not be of a virtuous character, but
will go to make your virtue

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

less;--it will be like heaping on clothes in spring as a protection
against cold, or bringing back the cold winds of winter as a protection
against heat (in summer). Now the king of Khû is of a domineering
presence and stern. He has no forgiveness for offenders, but is
merciless as a tiger. It is only a man of subtle speech, or one of
correct virtue, who can bend him from his purpose <span
id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_246.md).

'But the sagely man <span id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_247.md), when he is
left in obscurity, causes the members of his family to forget their
poverty; and, when he gets forward to a position of influence, causes
kings and dukes to forget their rank and emoluments, and transforms them
to be humble. With the inferior creatures, he shares their pleasures,
and they enjoy themselves the more; with other men, he rejoices in the
fellowship of the Tâo, and preserves it in himself. Therefore though he
may not speak, he gives them to drink of the harmony (of his spirit).
Standing in association with them, he transforms them till they become
in their feeling towards him as sons with a father. His wish is to
return to the solitude of his own mind, and this is the effect of his
occasional intercourse with them. So far-reaching is his influence on
the minds of men; and therefore I said to you. "Wait for Kung-yüeh
Hsiû.'''

2\. The sage comprehends the connexions between himself and others, and
how they all go to constitute him of one body with them, and he does not
know how it is so;--he naturally does so. In fulfilling his
constitution, as acted on and acting, he

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (simply) follows the direction of Heaven; and it
is in consequence of this that men style him (a sage). If he were
troubled about (the insufficiency of) his knowledge, what he did would
always be but small, and sometimes would be arrested altogether;--how
would he in this case be (the sage)? When (the sage) is born with all
his excellence, it is other men who see it for him. If they did not tell
him, he would not know that he was more excellent than others. And when
he knows it, he is as if he did not know it; when he hears it, he is as
if he did not hear it. His source of joy in it has no end, and men's
admiration of him has no end;--all this takes place naturally <span
id="fr_288"></span>[1](#fn_248.md). The love of the sage for others
receives its name from them. If they did not tell him of it, he would
not know that he loved them; and when he knows it, he is as if he knew
it not; when he hears it, he is as if he heard it not. His love of
others never has an end, and their rest in him has also no end:--all
this takes place naturally <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_248.md).

3\. When one sees at a distance his old country and old city, he feels a
joyous satisfaction <span id="fr_290"></span>[2](#fn_249.md). Though it be
full of mounds and an overgrowth of trees and grass, and when he enters
it he finds but a tenth part remaining, still he feels that
satisfaction. How much more when he sees what he saw, and hears what he
heard before! All this is to him like a tower eighty cubits high
exhibited in the sight of all men.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

(The sovereign) Zän-hsiang <span id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_250.md) was
possessed of that central principle round which all things revolve <span
id="fr_292"></span>[2](#fn_251.md), and by it he could follow them to their
completion. His accompanying them had neither ending nor beginning, and
was independent of impulse or time. Daily he witnessed their changes,
and himself underwent no change; and why should he not have rested in
this? If we (try to) adopt Heaven as our Master, we incapacitate
ourselves from doing so. Such endeavour brings us under the power of
things. If one acts in this way, what is to be said of him? The sage
never thinks of Heaven nor of men. He does not think of taking the
initiative, nor of anything external to himself. He moves along with his
age, and does not vary or fail. Amid all the completeness of his doings,
he is never exhausted. For those who wish to be in accord with him, what
other course is there to pursue?

When Thang got one to hold for him the reins of government, namely,
Män-yin Täng-häng <span id="fr_293"></span>[3](#fn_252.md), he employed him
as his teacher. He followed his master, but did not allow himself to be
hampered by him, and so he succeeded in following things to their
completion. The master had the name; but that name was a superfluous
addition to his laws, and the twofold character of his government was
made apparent <span id="fr_294"></span>[4](#fn_253.md). Kung-nî's 'Task
your thoughts to the utmost' was his expression of the duties of a

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

master. Yung-khäng said, 'Take the days away and there will be no year;
without what is internal there will be nothing external <span
id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_254.md).'

4\. (King) Yung <span id="fr_296"></span>[2](#fn_255.md) of Wei made a
treaty with the marquis Thien Mâu <span id="fr_297"></span>[3](#fn_256.md)
(of Khî), which the latter violated. The king was enraged, and intended
to send a man to assassinate him. When the Minister of War <span
id="fr_298"></span>[4](#fn_257.md) heard of it, he was ashamed, and said
(to the king), 'You are a ruler of 10,000 chariots, and by means of a
common man would avenge yourself on your enemy. I beg you to give me,
Yen, the command of 200,000 soldiers to attack him for you. I will take
captive his people and officers, halter (and lead off) his oxen and
horses, kindling a fire within him that shall burn to his backbone. I
will then storm his capital; and when he shall run away in terror, I
will flog his back and break his spine.' Kî-dze <span
id="fr_299"></span>[5](#fn_258.md) heard of this advice, and was ashamed of
it, and said (to the king), 'We have been raising the wall (of our
capital) to a height of eighty cubits, and the work has been completed.
If we now get it thrown down, it will be a painful toil to the convict
builders. It is now seven years

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

since our troops were called out, and this is the foundation of the
royal sway. Yen would introduce disorder;--he should not be listened
to.' Hwâ-dze <span id="fr_300"></span>[1](#fn_259.md) heard of this advice,
and, greatly disapproving of it, said (to the king), 'He who shows his
skill in saying "Attack Khî" would produce disorder; and he who shows
his skill in saying "Do not attack it" would also produce disorder. And
one who should (merely) say, "The counsellors to attack Khî and not to
attack it would both produce disorder," would himself also lead to the
same result.' The king said, 'Yes, but what am I to do?' The reply was,
'You have only to seek for (the rule of) the Tâo (on the subject).'

Hui-dze, having heard of this counsel, introduced to the king Tâi
Zin-zän <span id="fr_301"></span>[2](#fn_260.md), who said, 'There is the
creature called a snail; does your majesty know it?' 'I do.' 'On the
left horn of the snail there is a kingdom which is called Provocation,
and on the right horn another which is called Stupidity. These two
kingdoms are continually striving about their territories and fighting.
The corpses that lie on the ground amount to several myriads. The army
of one may be defeated and put to flight, but in fifteen days it will
return.' The king said, 'Pooh! that is empty talk!' The other rejoined,
'Your servant begs to show your majesty its real significance. When your
majesty thinks of space--east, west, north, and south, above and
beneath--can you set any limit to it?' 'It is illimitable,' said the
king; and his visitor went on, 'Your majesty knows

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

how to let your mind thus travel through the illimitable, and yet (as
compared with this) does it not seem insignificant whether the kingdoms
that communicate one with another exist or not?' The king replies, 'It
does so;' and Tâi Zin-zän said, finally, 'Among those kingdoms,
stretching one after another, there is this Wei; in Wei there is this
(city of) Liang <span id="fr_302"></span>[1](#fn_261.md); and in Liang
there is your majesty. Can you make any distinction between yourself,
and (the king of that kingdom of) Stupidity?' To this the king answered,
'There is no distinction,' and his visitor went out, while the king
remained disconcerted and seemed to have lost himself.

When the visitor was gone, Hui-dze came in and saw the king, who said,
'That stranger is a Great man. An (ordinary) sage is not equal to him.'
Hui-dze replied, 'If you blow into a flute, there come out its pleasant
notes; if you blow into a sword-hilt, there is nothing but a wheezing
sound. Yâo and Shun are the subjects of men's praises, but if you speak
of them before Tai Zin-zän, there will be but the wheezing sound.'

5\. Confucius, having gone to Khû, was lodging in the house of a seller
of Congee at Ant-hill. On the roof of a neighbouring house there
appeared the husband and his wife, with their servants, male and
female <span id="fr_303"></span>[2](#fn_262.md). Dze-lû said, 'What are
those people doing,

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

collected there as we see them?' Kung-nî replied, 'The man is a disciple
of the sages. He is burying himself among the people, and hiding among
the fields. Reputation has become little in his eyes, but there is no
bound to his cherished aims. Though he may speak with his mouth, he
never tells what is in his mind. Moreover, he is at variance with the
age, and his mind disdains to associate with it;--he is one who may be
said to lie hid at the bottom of the water on the dry land. Is he not a
sort of Î Liâo of Shih-nan?' Dze-lû asked leave to go and call him, but
Confucius said, 'Stop. He knows that I understand him well. He knows
that I am come to Khû, and thinks that I am sure to try and get the king
to invite him (to court). He also thinks that I am a man swift to speak.
Being such a man, he would feel ashamed to listen to the words of one of
voluble and flattering tongue, and how much more to come himself and see
his person! And why should we think that he will remain here?' Dze-lû,
however, went to see how it was, but found the house empty.

6\. The Border-warden of Khang-wû <span id="fr_304"></span>[1](#fn_263.md),
in questioning Dze-lâo <span id="fr_305"></span>[2](#fn_264.md), said, 'Let
not a ruler in the exercise of his government be (like the farmer) who
leaves the clods unbroken, nor, in regulating his people, (like one) who
recklessly plucks up the shoots. Formerly, in ploughing my corn-fields,
I left the clods unbroken, and my recompense was in the rough
unsatisfactory crops; and in weeding, I destroyed and tore up (many good
plants), and my recompense was in the scantiness of my harvests. In
subsequent

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

years I changed my methods, ploughing deeply and carefully covering up
the seed; and my harvests were rich and abundant, so that all the year I
had more than I could eat.' When Kwang-dze heard of his remarks, he
said, 'Now-a-days, most men, in attending to their bodies and regulating
their minds, correspond to the description of the Border-warden. They
hide from themselves their Heaven(-given being); they leave (all care
of) their (proper) nature; they extinguish their (proper) feelings; and
they leave their spirit to die:--abandoning themselves to what is the
general practice. Thus dealing with their nature like the farmer who is
negligent of the clods in his soil, the illegitimate results of their
likings and dislikings become their nature. The bushy sedges, reeds, and
rushes, which seem at first to spring up to support our bodies,
gradually eradicate our nature, and it becomes like a mass of running
sores, ever liable to flow out, with scabs and ulcers, discharging in
flowing matter from the internal heat. So indeed it is!'

7\. Po Kü <span id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_265.md) was studying with Lâo
Tan, and asked his leave to go and travel everywhere. Lao Tan said,
'Nay;--elsewhere it is just as here.' He repeated his request, and then
Lâo Tan said, 'Where would you go first?' 'I would begin with Khî,'
replied the disciple. Having got there, I would go to look at the
criminals (who had been executed). With my arms I would raise (one of)
them up and set him on his feet, and, taking off my court robes, I would
cover him with them, appealing at

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

the same time to Heaven and bewailing his lot, while I said <span
id="fr_307"></span>[1](#fn_266.md), "My son, my son, you have been one of
the first to suffer from the great calamities that afflict the
world <span id="fr_308"></span>[2](#fn_267)."' (Lâo Tan.md) said <span
id="fr_309"></span>[1](#fn_266), '(It is said.md), ---Do not rob. Do not
kill." (But) in the setting up of (the ideas of) glory and disgrace, we
see the cause of those evils; in the accumulation of property and
wealth, we see the causes of strife and contention. If now you set up
the things against which men fret; if you accumulate what produces
strife and contention among them; if you put their persons in such a
state of distress, that they have no rest or ease, although you may wish
that they should not come to the end of those (criminals), can your wish
be realised?

'The superior men (and rulers) of old considered that the success (of
their government) was to be found in (the state of) the people, and its
failure to be sought in themselves; that the right might be with the
people, and the wrong in themselves. Thus it was that if but a single
person lost his life, they retired and blamed themselves. Now, however,
it is not so. (Rulers) conceal what they want done, and hold those who
do not know it to be stupid; they require what is very difficult, and
condemn those who do not dare to undertake it; they impose heavy
burdens, and punish those who are unequal to them; they require men to
go far, and put them to death when they cannot accomplish the distance.
When the people know that the utmost of their

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

strength will be insufficient, they follow it up with deceit. When (the
rulers) daily exhibit much hypocrisy, how can the officers and people
not be hypocritical? Insufficiency of strength produces hypocrisy;
insufficiency of knowledge produces deception; insufficiency of means
produces robbery. But in this case against whom ought the robbery and
theft to be charged?'

8\. When Kü Po-yü was in his sixtieth year, his views became changed in
the course of it <span id="fr_310"></span>[1](#fn_268.md). He had never
before done anything but consider the views which he held to be right,
but now he came to condemn them as wrong; he did not know that what he
now called right was not what for fifty-nine years he had been calling
wrong. All things have the life (which we know), but we do not see its
root; they have their goings forth, but we do not know the door by which
they depart. Men all honour that which lies within the sphere of their
knowledge, but they do not know their dependence on what lies without
that sphere which would be their (true) knowledge:--may we not call
their case one of great perplexity? Ah! Ah! there is no escaping from
this dilemma. So it is! So it is!

9\. Kung-nî asked the Grand Historiographer <span
id="fr_311"></span>[2](#fn_269) Tâ Thâo, (along with.md) Po Khang-khien and
Khih-wei, saying, 'Duke Ling of Wei was so addicted to

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

drink, and abandoned to sensuality, that he did not attend to the
government of his state. Occupied in his pursuit of hunting with his
nets and bows, he kept aloof from the meetings of the princes. In what
was it that he showed his title to the epithet of Ling <span
id="fr_312"></span>[1](#fn_270.md)?' Tâ Thâo said, 'It was on account of
those very things.' Po Khang-khien said, 'Duke Ling had three mistresses
with whom he used to bathe in the same tub. (Once, however), when
Shih-zhiû came to him with presents from the imperial court, he made his
servants support the messenger in bearing the gifts <span
id="fr_313"></span>[2](#fn_271.md). So dissolute was he in the former case,
and when he saw a man of worth, thus reverent was he to him. It was on
this account that he was styled "Duke Ling." Khih-wei said, 'When duke
Ling died, and they divined about burying him in the old tomb of his
House, the answer was unfavourable; when they divined about burying him
on Shâ-khiû, the answer was favourable. Accordingly they dug there to
the depth of several fathoms, and found a stone coffin. Having washed
and inspected it, they discovered an inscription, which said,

"This grave will not be available for your posterity;  
Duke Ling will appropriate it for himself."

 

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

Thus that epithet of Ling had long been settled for the duke <span
id="fr_314"></span>[1](#fn_272.md). But how should those two be able to
know this

10\. Shâo Kih <span id="fr_315"></span>[2](#fn_273.md) asked Thâi-kung
Thiâo <span id="fr_316"></span>[2](#fn_273.md), saying, 'What do we mean by
"The Talk of the Hamlets and Villages?" The reply was, 'Hamlets and
Villages are formed by the union--say of ten surnames and a hundred
names, and are considered to be (the source of) manners and customs. The
differences between them are united to form their common character, and
what is common to them is separately apportioned to form the
differences. If you point to the various parts which make up the body of
a horse, you do not have the horse; but when the horse is before you,
and all its various parts stand forth (as forming the animal), you speak
of "the horse." So it is that the mounds and hills are made to be the
elevations that they are by accumulations of earth which individually
are but low. (So also rivers like) the Kiang and the Ho obtain their
greatness by the union of (other smaller) waters with them. And (in the
same way) the Great man exhibits the common sentiment of humanity by the
union in himself of all its individualities. Hence when ideas come to
him from without, though he

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

has his own decided view, he does not hold it with bigotry; and when he
gives out his own decisions, which are correct, the views of others do
not oppose them. The four seasons have their different elemental
characters, but they are not the partial gifts of Heaven, and so the
year completes its course. The five official departments have their
different duties, but the ruler does not partially employ any one of
them, and so the kingdom is governed. (The gifts of) peace and war(are
different), but the Great man does not employ the one to the prejudice
of the other, and so the character (of his administration) is perfect.
All things have their different constitutions and modes of actions, but
the Tâo (which directs them) is free from all partiality, and therefore
it has no name. Having no name, it therefore does nothing. Doing
nothing, there is nothing which it does not do.

'Each season has its ending and beginning; each age has its changes and
transformations; misery and happiness regularly alternate. Here our
views are thwarted, and yet the result may afterwards have our approval;
there we insist on our own views, and looking at things differently from
others, try to correct them, while we are in error ourselves. The case
may be compared to that of a great marsh, in which all its various
vegetation finds a place, or we may look at it as a great hill, where
trees and rocks are found on the same terrace. Such may be a description
of what is intended by "The Talk of the Hamlets and Villages."'

Shâo Kih said, 'Well, is it sufficient to call it (an expression of) the
Tâo?' Thâi-kung Thiâo said, 'It is not so. If we reckon up the number of
things,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

they are not 10,000 merely. When we speak of them as "the Myriad
Things," we simply use that large number by way of accommodation to
denominate them. In this way Heaven and Earth are the greatest of all
things that have form; the Yin and Yang are the greatest of all
elemental forces. But the Tâo is common to them. Because of their
greatness to use the Tâo or (Course) as a title and call it "the Great
Tâo" is allowable. But what comparison can be drawn between it and "the
Talk of the Hamlets and Villages?" To argue from this that it is a
sufficient expression of the Tâo, is like calling a dog and a horse by
the same name, while the difference between them is so great.'

11\. Shâo Kih said, 'Within the limits of the four cardinal points, and
the six boundaries of space, how was it that there commenced the
production of all things?' Thâi-kung Thiâo replied, 'The Yin and Yang
reflected light on each other, covered each other, and regulated each
the other; the four seasons gave place to one another, produced one
another, and brought one another to an end. Likings and dislikings, the
avoidings of this and movements towards that, then arose (in the things
thus produced), in their definite distinctness; and from this came the
separation and union of the male and female. Then were seen now security
and now insecurity, in mutual change; misery and happiness produced each
other; gentleness and urgency pressed on each other; the movements of
collection and dispersion were established:--these names and processes
can be examined, and, however minute, can be recorded. The rules
determining the order in which they follow one another, their mutual
influence

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

now acting directly and now revolving, how, when they are exhausted,
they revive, and how they end and begin again; these are the properties
belonging to things. Words can describe them and knowledge can reach to
them; but with this ends all that can be said of things. Men who study
the Tâo do not follow on when these operations end, nor try to search
out how they began:--with this all discussion of them stops.'

Shâo Kih said, 'Kî Kän <span id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_274.md) holds that
(the Tâo) forbids all action, and Kieh-dze <span
id="fr_318"></span>[1](#fn_274.md) holds that it may perhaps allow of
influence. Which of the two is correct in his statements, and which is
one-sided in his ruling?' Thâi-kung Thiâo replied, 'Cocks crow and dogs
bark;--this is what all men know. But men with the greatest wisdom
cannot describe in words whence it is that they are formed (with such
different voices), nor can they find out by thinking what they wish to
do. We may refine on this small point; till it is so minute that there
is no point to operate on, or it may become so great that there is no
embracing it. "Some one caused it;" "No one did it;" but we are thus
debating about things; and the end is that we shall find we are in
error. "Some one caused it;"--then there was a real Being. "No one did
it;"--then there was mere vacancy. To have a name and a real
existence,-that is the condition of a thing. Not to have a name, and not

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

to have real being;--that is vacancy and no thing. We may speak and we
may think about it, but the more we speak, the wider shall we be of the
mark. Birth, before it comes, cannot be prevented; death, when it has
happened, cannot be traced farther. Death and life are not far apart;
but why they have taken place cannot be seen. That some one has caused
them, or that there has been no action in the case are but speculations
of doubt. When I look for their origin, it goes back into infinity; when
I look for their end, it proceeds without termination. Infinite,
unceasing, there is no room for words about (the Tâo). To regard it as
in the category of things is the origin of the language that it is
caused or that it is the result of doing nothing; but it would end as it
began with things. The Tâo cannot have a (real) existence; if it has, it
cannot be made to appear as if it had not. The name Tâo is a metaphor,
used for the purpose of description <span
id="fr_319"></span>[1](#fn_275.md). To say that it causes or does nothing
is but to speak of one phase of things, and has nothing to do with the
Great Subject. If words were sufficient for the purpose, in a day's time
we might exhaust it; since they are not sufficient, we may speak all
day, and only exhaust (the subject of) things. The Tâo is the extreme to
which things conduct us. Neither speech nor silence is sufficient to
convey the notion of it. Neither by speech nor by silence can our
thoughts about it have their highest expression.

prior to the three Hwang or August ones.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[117:2](sbe4009.htm#fr_292.md) See the same
phraseology in Book II, par. 3.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[117:3](sbe4009.htm#fr_293.md) I have followed Lin
Hsî-hung in taking these four characters as the name of one man.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[117:4](sbe4009.htm#fr_294.md) There was a human
element in it instead of the Heavenly only; but some critics think the
text here is erroneous or defective.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[118:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_295.md) Said to have been
employed by Hwang-Tî to make the calendar.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[118:2](sbe4009.htm#fr_296.md) B.C. 370-317.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[118:3](sbe4009.htm#fr_297.md) I do not find the
name Mâu as belonging to any of the Thien rulers of Khî. The name of the
successor of Thien Ho, who has been before us, was <span
id="img_11800"></span> ![](img/11800.jpg), Wû, for which <span
id="img_11801"></span> ![](img/11801.jpg), Mâu, may be a mistake; or
'the marquis Mâu' may be a creation of our author.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[118:4](sbe4009.htm#fr_298.md) Literally, 'the
Rhinoceros' Head,' the title of 'the Minister of War' in Wei, who was at
this time a Kung-sun Yen. See the memoir of him in Sze-mâ Khien, Book
IX. of his Biographies.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[118:5](sbe4009.htm#fr_299.md) I do not know that
anything more can be said of Kî and Hwâ than that they were officers of
Wei.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[119:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_300.md) See note
 [5](#fn_258.md) on preceding page.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[119:2](sbe4009.htm#fr_301.md) Evidently a man of
considerable reach of thought.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[120:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_302.md) Liang, the capital,
came to be used also as the name of the state;--as in Mencius.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[120:2](sbe4009.htm#fr_303.md) 'They were on the
roof, 'repairing it' say some. 'They had got on the roof, to get out of
the way of Confucius,' say others. The sequel shows that this second
interpretation is correct; but we do not see how the taking to the roof
facilitated their departure from the house.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[121:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_304.md) Probably the same
as the Khang-Wû Dze in Book II, par. 9.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[121:2](sbe4009.htm#fr_305.md) See Analects IX,
vi, 4.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[122:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_306.md) We can only say of
Po Kü that he was a disciple of Lâo-dze.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[123:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_309.md) There are two <span
id="img_12300"></span> ![](img/12300.jpg) here, and the difficulty in
translating is to determine the subject of each.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[123:2](sbe4009.htm#fr_308.md) The <span
id="img_12301"></span> ![](img/12301.jpg) of the text here is taken as =
<span id="img_12302"></span> ![](img/12302.jpg).

<span id="fn_268"></span>[124:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_310.md) Confucius thought
highly of this Kü Po-yü, and they were friends (Analects, XIV, 26; XV,
6). It would seem from this paragraph that, in his sixtieth year, he
adopted the principles of Tâoism. Whether he really did so we cannot
tell. See also Book IV, par. 5.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[124:2](sbe4009.htm#fr_311.md) We must translate
here in the singular, for in the historiographer's department there were
only two officers with the title of 'Grand;' Po Khang-khien and Khih-wei
would be inferior members of it.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[125:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_312.md) Ling (<span
id="img_12500"></span> ![](img/12500.jpg)) as a posthumous epithet, has
various meanings, none of them very bad, and some of them very good.
Confucius ought to have been able to solve his question himself better
than any of the historiographers, but he propounded his doubt to them
for reasons which he, no doubt, had.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[125:2](sbe4009.htm#fr_313.md) We are not to
suppose that the royal messenger found him in the tub with his three
wives or mistresses. The two incidents mentioned illustrate two
different phases of his character, as some of the critics, and even the
text itself, clearly indicate.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[126:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_314.md) This explanation
is, of course, absurd.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[126:2](sbe4009.htm#fr_316.md) These two names are
both metaphorical, the former meaning 'Small Knowledge,' and the latter,
'The Grand Public and just Harmonizer.' Small Knowledge would look for
the Tâo in the ordinary talk of ordinary men. The other teaches him that
it is to be found in 'the Great man,' blending in himself what is 'just'
in the sentiments and practice of all men. And so it is to be found in
all the phenomena of nature, but it has itself no name, and does
nothing.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[129:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_318.md) Two masters of
schools of Tâoism. Who the former was I do not know; but Sze-mâ Khien in
the seventy-fourth Book of his Records mentions several Tâoist masters,
and among them Kieh-dze, a native of Khî, 'a student of the arts of the
Tâo and its Characteristics, as taught by Hwang-Tî and Lâo-dze, and who
also published his views on the subject.'

<span id="fn_275"></span>[130:1](sbe4009.htm#fr_319.md) A very important
statement with regard to the meaning of the name Tâo.
