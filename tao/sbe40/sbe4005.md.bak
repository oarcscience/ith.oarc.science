## BOOK XXI.

### PART II. SECTION XIV.

### Thien Dze-fang <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_85.md).

1\. Thien Dze-fang, sitting in attendance on the marquis Wän of
Wei <span id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_86), often quoted (with approbation.md)
the words of Khî Kung <span id="fr_98"></span>[3](#fn_87.md). The marquis
said, 'Is Khî Kung your preceptor?' Dze-fang replied, 'No. He only
belongs to the same neighbourhood. In speaking about the Tâo, his views
are often correct, and therefore I quote them as I do.' The marquis went
on, 'Then have you no preceptor?' 'I have.' And who is he? He is
Tung-kwo Shun-dze <span id="fr_99"></span>[4](#fn_88.md).' 'And why, my
Master, have I never heard you quote his words?' Dze-fang replied, 'He
is a man who satisfies the true (ideal of humanity) <span
id="fr_100"></span>[5](#fn_89.md); a man in appearance, but (having the
mind of) Heaven. Void of any thought of himself, he accommodates himself
to others, and nourishes the true ideal that belongs to him. With all
his purity, he is forbearing to others. Where they are without the Tâo,
he rectifies his demeanour, so that they understand it, and in
consequence their own ideas melt

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

away and disappear. How should one like me be fit to quote his words?'

When Dze-fang went out, the marquis Wän continued in a state of dumb
amazement all the day. He then called Lung Lî-khin, and said to him,
'How far removed from us is the superior man of complete virtue!
Formerly I thought the words of the sages and wise men, and the practice
of benevolence and righteousness, to be the utmost we could reach to.
Since I have heard about the preceptor of Dze-fang, my body is all
unstrung, and I do not wish to move, and my mouth is closed up, and I do
not wish to speak;--what I have learned has been only a counterfeit of
the truth <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_90.md). Yes, (the possession of
Wei) has been an entanglement to me.'

2\. Wän-po Hsüeh-dze <span id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_91.md), on his way to
Khï, stayed some time in Lû, where some persons of the state begged to
have an interview with him. He refused them, saying, 'I have heard that
the superior men of these Middle States <span
id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_92) understand the (subjects of.md) ceremony and
righteousness, but are deplorably ignorant of the minds of men. I do not
wish to see them.' He went on to Khî; and on his way back (to the
south), he again stayed in Lû, when the same persons begged as before
for an interview. He then said, 'Formerly they asked to see me, and now
again they seek an interview. They will afford me

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

some opportunity of bringing out my sentiments.' He went out accordingly
and saw the visitors, and came in again with a sigh. Next day the same
thing occurred, and his servant said to him, 'How is it that whenever
you see those visitors, you are sure to come in again sighing?' 'I told
you before,' was the reply, 'that the people of these Middle States
understand (the subjects of) ceremony and righteousness, but are
deplorably ignorant of the minds of men. Those men who have just seen
me, as they came in and went out would describe, one a circle and
another a square, and in their easy carriage would be like, one a dragon
and another a tiger. They remonstrated with me as sons (with their
fathers), and laid down the way for me as fathers (for their sons). It
was this which made me sigh.'

Kung-nî saw the man, but did not speak a word to him. Dze-lû said, 'You
have wished, Sir, to see this Wän-po Hsüeh-dze for a long time; what is
the reason that when you have seen him, you have not spoken a word?'
Kung-nî replied, 'As soon as my eyes lighted on that man, the Tâo in him
was apparent. The situation did not admit of a word being spoken.'

3\. Yen Yüan asked Kung-nî, saying, 'Master, when you pace quietly
along, I also pace along; when you go more quickly, I also do the same;
when you gallop, I also gallop; but when you race along and spurn the
dust, then I can only stand and look, and keep behind you <span
id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_93.md).' The Master said, 'Hui, what do you
mean?' The reply was, 'In saying that when you, Master, pace quietly
along, I also pace

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

along," I mean <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_94.md) that when you speak,
I also speak. By saying, "When you go more quickly, I also do the same,"
I mean I that when you reason, I also reason. By saying, "When you
gallop, I also gallop," I mean <span id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_94.md) that
when you speak of the Way, I also speak of the Way; but by saying, "When
you race along and spurn the dust, then I can only stare, and keep
behind you," I am thinking how though you do not speak, yet all men
believe you; though you are no partisan, yet all parties approve your
catholicity; and though you sound no instrument, yet people all move on
harmoniously before you, while (all the while) I do not know how all
this comes about; and this is all which my words are intended to
express <span id="fr_107"></span>[2](#fn_95.md).'

Kung-nî said, 'But you must try and search the matter out. Of all causes
for sorrow there is none so great as the death of the mind;--the death
of man's (body) is only next to it. The sun comes forth in the east, and
sets in the extreme West;--all things have their position determined by
these two points. All that have eyes and feet wait for this (sun), and
then proceed to do what they have to do. When this comes forth, they
appear in their places; when it sets, they disappear. It is so with all
things. They have that for which they wait, and (on its arrival) they
die; they have that for which they wait, and then (again) they live.
When once I receive my frame thus completed, I remain unchanged,
awaiting the consummation of my course.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

I move as acted on by things, day and night without cessation, and I do
not know when I will come to an end. Clearly I am here a completed
frame, and even one who (fancies that he) knows what is appointed cannot
determine it beforehand. I am in this way daily passing on, but all day
long I am communicating my views to you; and now, as we are shoulder to
shoulder you fail (to understand me);--is it not matter for lamentation?
You are able in a measure to set forth what I more clearly set forth;
but that is passed away, and you look for it, as if it were still
existing, just as if you were looking for a horse in the now empty place
where it was formerly exhibited for sale. You have very much forgotten
my service to you, and I have very much forgotten wherein I served you.
But nevertheless why should you account this such an evil? What you
forget is but my old self; that which cannot be forgotten remains with
me.'

4\. Confucius went to see Lâo Tan, and arrived just as he had completed
the bathing of his head, and was letting his dishevelled hair get dry.
There be was, motionless, and as if there were not another man in the
world <span id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_96.md). Confucius waited quietly;
and, when in a little time he was introduced, he said, 'Were my eyes
dazed? Is it really you? Just now, your body, Sir, was like the stump of
a rotten tree. You looked as if you had no thought of anything, as if
you had left the society of men, and were standing in the solitude (of
yourself).' Lâo Tan replied, 'I was enjoying myself in thinking about
the commencement

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

of things <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_97.md).' 'What do you mean?' 'My
mind is so cramped, that I hardly know it; my tongue is so tied that I
cannot tell it; but I will try to describe it to you as nearly as I can.
When the state of Yin was perfect, all was cold and severe; when the
state of Yang was perfect, all was turbulent and agitated. The coldness
and severity came forth from Heaven; the turbulence and agitation issued
from Earth. The two states communicating together, a harmony ensued and
things were produced. Some one regulated and controlled this, but no one
has seen his form. Decay and growth; fulness and emptiness; darkness and
light; the changes of the sun and the transformations of the
moon:--these are brought about from day to day; but no one sees the
process of production. Life has its origin from which it springs, and
death has its place from which it returns. Beginning and ending go on in
mutual contrariety without any determinable commencement, and no one
knows bow either comes to an end. If we disallow all this, who
originates and presides over all these phenomena?'

Confucius said, 'I beg to ask about your enjoyment in these thoughts.'
Lâo Tan replied, 'The

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

comprehension of this is the most admirable and the most enjoyable (of
all acquisitions). The getting of the most admirable and the exercise of
the thoughts in what is the most enjoyable, constitutes what we call the
Perfect man.' Confucius said, 'I should like to hear the method of
attaining to it.' The reply was, 'Grass-eating animals do not dislike to
change their pastures; creatures born in the water do not dislike to
change their waters. They make a small change, but do not lose what is
the great and regular requirement (of their nature); joy, anger,
sadness, and delight do not enter into their breasts (in connexion with
such events). Now the space under the sky is occupied by all things in
their unity. When they possess that unity and equally share it, then the
four limbs and hundred members of their body are but so much dust and
dirt, while death and life, their ending and beginning, are but as the
succession of day and night, which cannot disturb their enjoyment; and
how much less will they be troubled by gains and losses, by calamity and
happiness! Those who renounce the paraphernalia of rank do it as if they
were casting away so much mud; they know that they are themselves more
honourable than those paraphernalia. The honour belonging to one's self
is not lost by any change (of condition). Moreover, a myriad
transformations may take place before the end of them is reached. What
is there in all this sufficient to trouble the mind? Those who have
attained to the Tâo understand the subject.'

Confucius said, 'O Master, your virtue is equal to that of Heaven and
Earth, and still I must borrow

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (some of your) perfect words (to aid me) in the
cultivation of my mind. Who among the superior men of antiquity could
give such expression to them?' Lâo Tan replied, 'Not so. Look at the
spring, the water of which rises and overflows; it does nothing, but it
naturally acts so. So with the perfect man and his virtue;--he does not
cultivate it, and nothing evades its influence. He is like heaven which
is high of itself, like earth which is solid of itself, like the sun and
moon which shine of themselves;--what need is there to cultivate it?'

Confucius went out and reported the conversation to Yen Hui, saying, 'In
the (knowledge of the) Tâo am I any better than an animalcule in
vinegar? But for the Master's lifting the veil from me, I should not
have known the grand perfection of Heaven and Earth.'

5\. At an interview of Kwang-dze with duke Âi <span
id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_98.md) of Lû, the duke said, 'There are many of
the Learned class in Lû; but few of them can be compared with you, Sir.'
Kwang-dze replied, 'There are few Learned men in Lû.' 'Everywhere in
Lû,' rejoined the duke, 'you see men wearing the dress of the
Learned <span id="fr_111"></span>[2](#fn_99.md);--how can you say that they
are few?' 'I have heard,' said Kwang-dze, 'that those of them who wear
round caps know the times of heaven; that those who wear square shoes
know the contour of the ground; and that those who saunter about with
semicircular stones at their

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

girdle-pendents settle matters in dispute as they come before them. But
superior men who are possessed of such knowledge will not be found
wearing the dress, and it does not follow that those who wear the dress
possess the knowledge. If your Grace think otherwise, why not issue a
notification through the state, that it shall be a capital offence to
wear the dress without possessing the knowledge.' On this the duke
issued such a notification, and in five days, throughout all Lû, there
was no one who dared to wear the dress of the Learned. There was only
one old man who came and stood in it at the duke's gate. The duke
instantly called him in, and questioned him about the affairs of the
state, when he talked about a thousand points and ten thousand
divergences from them. Kwang-dze said, 'When the state of Lû can thus
produce but one man of the Learned class, can he be said to be many?'

6\. The ideas of rank and emolument did not enter the mind of Pâi-lî
Hsî <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_100.md), and so he became a
cattle-feeder, and his cattle were all in fine condition. This made duke
Mû of Khin forget the meanness of his position, and put the government
(of his state) into his hands. Neither life nor death entered into the
mind of (Shun), the Lord of Yü, and therefore he was able to influence
others <span id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_101.md).

7\. The ruler Yüan <span id="fr_114"></span>[3](#fn_102.md) of Sung wishing
to have a map

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

drawn, the masters of the pencil all came (to undertake the task).
Having received his instructions and made their bows, they stood,
licking their pencils and preparing their ink. Half their number,
however, remained outside. There was one who came late, with an air of
indifference, and did not hurry forward. When he had received his
instructions and made his bow, he did not keep standing, but proceeded
to his shed. The duke sent a man to see him, and there he was, with his
upper garment off, sitting cross-legged, and nearly naked. The ruler
said, 'He is the man; he is a true draughtsman.'

8\. King Wän was (once) looking about him at Zang <span
id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_103.md), when he saw an old man fishing <span
id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_104.md). But his fishing was no fishing. It was
not the fishing of one whose business is fishing. He was always fishing
(as if he had no object in the occupation). The king wished to raise him
to office, and put the government into his hands, but was afraid that
such a step would give dissatisfaction to his great ministers, his
uncles, and cousins. He then wished to dismiss the man altogether from
his mind, but he could not bear the thought that his people should be
without (such a) Heaven (as their Protector). On this, (next) morning,
he called together his great officers, and said to them, 'Last night, I
dreamt that I saw a good man, with a dark complexion and a

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

beard, riding on a piebald horse, one half of whose hoofs were red, who
commanded me, saying, "Lodge your government in the hands of the old man
of Zang; and perhaps the evils of your people will be cured."' The great
officers said eagerly, 'It was the king, your father.' King Wän said,
'Let us then submit the proposal to the tortoise-shell.' They replied,
'It is the order of your father. Let not your majesty think of any
other. Why divine about it?' (The king) then met the old man of, Zang,
and committed the government to him. The statutes and laws were not
changed by him; not a one-sided order (of his own) was issued; but when
the king made a survey of the kingdom after three years, he found that
the officers had destroyed the plantations (which harboured banditti),
and dispersed their occupiers, that the superintendents of the official
departments did not plume themselves on their successes, and that no
unusual grain measures were allowed within the different states <span
id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_105.md). When the officers had destroyed the
dangerous plantations and dispersed their occupants, the highest value
was set on the common interests; when the chiefs of departments did not
plume themselves on their successes, the highest value was set on the
common business; when unusual grain measures did not enter the different
states, the different princes had no jealousies. On this king Min made
the old man his Grand Preceptor, and asked him, with his own face to the
north, whether his government might be extended to all the kingdom. The
old

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

man looked perplexed and gave no reply, but with aimless look took his
leave. In the morning he had issued his orders, and at night he had gone
his way; nor was he heard of again all his life. Yen Yüan questioned
Confucius, saying, 'Was even king Wän unequal to determine his course?
What had he to do with resorting to a dream?' Kung-nî replied, 'Be
silent and do not say a word! King Win was complete in everything. What
have you to do with criticising him? He only had recourse (to the dream)
to meet a moment's difficulty.'

9\. Lieh Yü-khâu was exhibiting his archery <span
id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_106.md) to Po-hwän Wû-zän <span
id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_107.md). Having drawn the bow to its full
extent, with a cup of water placed on his elbow, he let fly. As the
arrow was discharged, another was put in its place; and as that was sent
off, a third was ready on the string. All the while he stood like a
statue. Po-hwän Wû-zän said, 'That is the shooting of an archer, but not
of one who shoots without thinking about his shooting. Let me go up with
you to the top of a high mountain, treading with you among the tottering
rocks, till we arrive at the brink of a precipice, 800 cubits deep, and
(I will then see) if you can shoot.' On this they went up a high
mountain, making their way among the tottering rocks, till they came to
the brink of a precipice 800 cubits deep. Then Wû-zän turned round and
walked backwards, till his feet were two-thirds

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

of their length outside the edge, and beckoned Yü-khâu to come forward.
He, however, had fallen prostrate on the ground, with the sweat pouring
down to his heels. Then the other said, 'The Perfect man looks up to the
azure sky above, or dives down to the yellow springs beneath, or soars
away to the eight ends of the universe, without any change coming over
his spirit or his breath. But now the trepidation of your mind appears
in your dazed eyes; your inward feeling of peril is extreme!'

10\. Kien Wû asked Sun-shû Âo <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_108.md),
saying, 'You, Sir, were thrice chief minister, and did not feel elated;
you were thrice dismissed from that position, without manifesting any
sorrow. At first I was in doubt about you, (but I am not now, since) I
see how regularly and quietly the breath comes through your nostrils.
How is it that you exercise your mind?' Sun-shû Âo replied, 'In what do
I surpass other men? When the position came to me, I thought it should
not be rejected; when it was taken away, I thought it could not be
retained. I considered that the getting or losing it did not make me
what I was, and was no occasion for any manifestation of sorrow;--that
was all. In what did I surpass other men? And moreover, I did not know
whether the honour of it belonged to the dignity, or to myself. If it
belonged to the dignity, it was nothing to me; if it belonged to me, it
had nothing

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

to do with the dignity. While occupied with these uncertainties, and
looking round in all directions, what leisure had I to take knowledge of
whether men honoured me or thought me mean?'

Kung-nî heard of all this, and said, 'The True men of old could not be
fully described by the wisest, nor be led into excess by the most
beautiful, nor be forced by the most violent robber. Neither Fû-hsî nor
Hwang-Tî could compel them to be their friends. Death and life are
indeed great considerations, but they could make no change in their
(true) self; and how much less could rank and emolument do so? Being
such, their spirits might pass over the Thâi mountain and find it no
obstacle to them <span id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_109.md); they might enter
the greatest gulphs, and not be wet by them; they might occupy the
lowest and smallest positions without being distressed by them. Theirs
was the fulness of heaven and earth; the more that they gave to others,
the more they had.'

The king of Khû and the ruler of Fan <span
id="fr_122"></span>[2](#fn_110.md) were sitting together. After a little
while, the attendants of the king said, 'Fan has been destroyed three
times.' The ruler of Fan rejoined, 'The destruction of Fan has not been
sufficient to destroy what we had that was most deserving to be
preserved.' Now,

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

if the destruction of Fan had not been sufficient to destroy that which
it had most deserving to be preserved, the preservation of Khû had not
been sufficient to preserve that in it most deserving to be preserved.
Looking at the matter from this point of view, Fan had not begun to be
destroyed, and Khû had not begun to be preserved.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[42:2](sbe4005.htm#fr_97.md) B.C. 424-387.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[42:3](sbe4005.htm#fr_98.md) Some well-known worthy
of Wei.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[42:4](sbe4005.htm#fr_99.md) A greater worthy
still. He must have lived near the outside suburban wall of the capital,
and his residence became a sort of surname.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[42:5](sbe4005.htm#fr_100.md) The Human and the
Heavenly were blended in his personality.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[43:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_101.md) So the Khang-hsî
dictionary defines the phrase;--'a wooden image made of earth,' says Lû
Shû-kih.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[43:2](sbe4005.htm#fr_102.md) A Tâoist of note from
some region in the south, perhaps from Khû, having his own share of the
Tâoistic contempt for knowledge and culture.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[43:3](sbe4005.htm#fr_103.md) Probably Lû and the
northern states grouped closely round the royal domain.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[44:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_104.md) They are both
supposed to be on horseback.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[45:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_106.md) In these three cases
the <span id="img_04500"></span> ![](img/04500.jpg) of the text should
be <span id="img_04501"></span> ![](img/04501.jpg).

<span id="fn_95"></span>[45:2](sbe4005.htm#fr_107.md) So Hui is made to
represent the master as a mental Thaumathurgist, and Confucius is made
to try to explain the whole thing to him;--but not to my mind
successfully. Still a distinction is maintained between the mind and the
body.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[46:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_108.md) He was in the
Tâoistic trance, like Nan-kwo Dze-khî, at the beginning of the second
Book.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[47:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_109.md) This 'commencement of
things' was not the equivalent of 'our creation out of nothing,' for Mo
Tan immediately supposes the existence of the primary ether in its
twofold state, as Yin and Y an g; and also of Heaven and Earth, as a
twofold Power working, under some regulation and control, yet invisible;
that is, under the Tâo. In the same way the process of beginning and
ending, growth and decay, life and death go on, no one knows how, or how
long. And the contemplation of all this is the cause of unceasing
delight to the Perfect man, the possessor of the Tâo. Death is a small
matter, merely as a change of feature; and Confucius acknowledges his
immeasurable inferiority to Lâo-dze.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[49:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_110.md) Duke Âi of Lû died in
B.C. 468, a century and more before the birth of Kwang-dze. On that, as
well as on other grounds, the paragraph cannot be genuine.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[49:2](sbe4005.htm#fr_111.md) Compare the
thirty-eighth Book of the Lî Kî, where Confucius denies that there was
any dress peculiar to the scholar.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[50:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_112.md) Pâi-lî Hsî, a
remarkable character of the seventh century B.C., who rose to be chief
minister to Mû, the earl (or duke) of Khin, the last of the five Leading
Princes of the kingdom. Mû died in B.C. 621. Mencius has much to say of
Pâi-lî Hsî.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[50:2](sbe4005.htm#fr_113.md) Shun's parents
wished to kill him; but that did not trouble his mind; his filial piety
even affected them.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[50:3](sbe4005.htm#fr_114.md) His first year as
duke of Sung was B.C. 530. The point of the story is not clear.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[51:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_115.md) Where Zang was
cannot be told.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[51:2](sbe4005.htm#fr_116.md) The old fisherman
here was, no doubt, the first marquis of Khî, after the establishment of
the dynasty of Kâu, known by various names, as Lü Shang, Thâi-kung Wang,
and Kiang Dze-yâ. He did much for the new rule, but his connexion with
kings Wän and Wû is a mass of fables. The fishing as if he were not
fishing betokened in him the aimlessness of the Tâo.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[52:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_117.md) That is, that all
combinations formed to resist and warp the course of justice had been
put an end to.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[53:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_118.md) This must be the
meaning of the <span id="img_05300"></span> ![](img/05300.jpg) 'for.'
The whole story is found in Lieh-dze, II, p. 5. From Lieh's Book VIII,
p. 2, we learn that Lieh-dze's teacher in archery was Yin Hsî, the
warden of the pass famous in the history of Lâo-dze.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[53:2](sbe4005.htm#fr_119.md) Mentioned in Book V,
par. 2.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[54:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_120.md) Sun-shû Âo;--see
Mencius VI, ii, 15. He was, no doubt, a good and able man, chief
minister to king Kwang of Khû. The legends or edifying stories about him
are many; but Kwang-dze, I think, is the author of his being thrice
raised and thrice dismissed from office.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[55:1](sbe4005.htm#fr_121.md) It is difficult to
see why this should be predicated of the ‘spirits' of the True men.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[55:2](sbe4005.htm#fr_122.md) Fan was a small
state, held at one time by descendants of the famous duke of Kâu;--see
the Zo Khwan, I, vii, 6; V, xxiv, 2. But we do not know what had been
