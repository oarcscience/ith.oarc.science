class="c_d">1891</span>\] *66,099 bytes*   <span class="c_b">The Tao te
Ching is one of the most widely read sacred texts, due to its simplicity
and depth.</span> It appeal is universal, and has been found relevant by
Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and even Quantum Physicists.
Attributed to Lao-tzu, (580-500 B.C.), it may predate him by several
centuries. The earliest known manuscripts of the Tao te Ching date to
the third century B.C.</span>

This translation is excerpted from Volume 39 of the Sacred Books of the
East.
