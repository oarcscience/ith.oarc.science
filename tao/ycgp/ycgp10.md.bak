## CHAPTER X <span class="small">THE JOYOUS LIFE OF TUAN-MU-SHU</span>

T<span class="small">UAN-MU</span>-S<span class="small">HU</span> of Wei
was descended from Tse-Kung.

   He had a patrimony of ten thousand gold pieces.

   Indifferent to the chances of life, he followed his own inclinations.

   What the heart delights in he would do and delight in: with his walls
and buildings, pavilions, verandahs, gardens, parks, ponds and lakes,
wine and food, carriages, dresses, women and attendants, he would
emulate the princes of Chi and Chu in luxury.

   Whenever his heart desired something, or his ear wished to hear
something, his eye to see or his <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> mouth
to taste, he would procure it at all costs, though the thing might only
be had in a far-off country, and not in the kingdom of Chi.

   When on a journey the mountains and rivers might be ever so difficult
and dangerous to pass, and the roads ever so long, he would still
proceed just as men walk a few steps.

   A hundred guests were entertained daily in his palace. In the
kitchens there were always fire and smoke, and the vaults of his hall
and peristyle incessantly resounded with songs and music. The remains
from his table he divided first among his clansmen. What they left was
divided among his fellow-citizens, and what these did not eat was
distributed throughout the whole kingdom.

   When Tuan-mu-Shu reached the age of sixty, and his mind and body
began to decay, he gave up his household and distributed all his
treasures, pearls and gems, carriages and dresses, concubines and female
attendants. Within a year he had disposed of his fortune, and to his
offspring he had left nothing. When he fell ill, he had no means to buy
medicines and a stone lancet, and when he died, there was not even money
for his funeral. All his countrymen who had benefited by him contributed
money to bury him, and gave back the fortune of his descendants.

   When Ch’in-ku-li<span id="page_50_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_50_note_1.md)
heard of this he said:

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

   "Tuan-mu-Shu was a fool, who brought disgrace to his ancestor."

   When Tuan-Kan-Sheng heard of it he said:

   "Tuan-mu-Shu was a wise man; his virtue was much superior to that of
his ancestors. The commonsense people were shocked at his conduct, but
it was in accord with the right doctrine. The excellent man of Wei only
adhered to propriety. They surely had not a heart like his."
