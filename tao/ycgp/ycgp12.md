## CHAPTER XII <span class="small">SELF-SACRIFICE AND SELF-AGGRANDISEMENT</span>

Y<span class="small">ANG</span> C<span class="small">HU</span> said:

   "Po-chêng-tse-kao<span id="page_52_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_52_note_1)
would not part with a hair of his body for the benefit of others. He
quitted <span id="page_53">p. 53</span> his country and became a
ploughman. The great Yü<span
id="page_53_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_53_note_1) did not profit by his own
body, which grew quite emaciated.

   "If the ancients by injuring a single hair could have rendered a
service to the world, they would not have done it; and had the universe
been offered to a single person, he would not have accepted it.

   "As nobody would damage even a hair, and nobody would do a favour to
the world, the world was in a perfect state."

   Ch’in-Tse asked Yang Chu:

   "If by pulling out a hair of your body you would aid mankind, would
you do it?"

   Yang Chu answered:

   "Mankind is surely not to be helped by a single hair."

   Ch’in-Tse said:

   "But supposing it possible, would you do it?"

   Yang Chu gave no answer.

   Thereupon Ch’in-Tse told Meng-sun-Yang, who replied:

   "I will explain the Master's meaning.

   "Supposing for tearing off a piece of your skin you were offered ten
thousand gold pieces, would you do it?"

   Ch’in-Tse said:

   "I would."

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

   Meng-sun-Yang again asked:

   "Supposing for cutting off one of your limbs you were to get a
kingdom, would you do it?"

   Ch’in-Tse was silent.

   "See now," said Meng-sun-Yang. "A hair is unimportant compared with
the skin, and the skin also is unimportant compared with a limb.

   "However, many hairs put together form skin, and many skins form a
limb. Therefore, though a hair is but one among the many molecules
composing the body, it is not to be disregarded."

   Ch’in-Tse replied:

   "I do not know how to answer you. If I were to ask Lao-tse and
Kuan-Yin,<span id="page_54_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_54_note_1) your
opinion would be found right, and so also if I were to consult great Yü
and Me-ti."

   Meng-sun-Yang upon this turned round to his disciples, and spoke of
something else.
