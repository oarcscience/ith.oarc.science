## CHAPTER V <span class="small">FALSE VIRTUES</span>

Y<span class="small">ANG</span> C<span class="small">HU</span> said:

   "Po Yi was not without desire, for being too proud of his purity of
mind, he was led to death by starvation.

   "Chan-Chi<span id="page_41_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_41_note_2.md) was not
passionless, for being too proud of his virtue he happened to reduce his
family.

   "Those who in pursuit of purity and virtue do good in a false way
resemble these men."
