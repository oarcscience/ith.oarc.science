## CHAPTER XV <span class="small">ALL THINGS PASS</span>

Y<span class="small">ANG</span> C<span class="small">HU</span> said:

   "The memory of things of highest antiquity is faded. Who recollects
them? Of the time of the three generations of Emperors<span
id="page_59_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_59_note_1.md) something is preserved,
but the rest is lost. Of the five rulers<span
id="page_59_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_59_note_2.md) something is still known,
the rest is only guessed at. Of the events during the time of the three
emperors<span id="page_59_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_59_note_3.md) some are
veiled in deep obscurity, and some are clear, yet out of a hundred
thousand not one is recollected. Of the things of our present life some
are heard, others seen, yet not one out of ten thousand is recollected.
It is impossible to calculate the number of years elapsed from remote
antiquity to the present day. Only from Fw-hsi downwards there are more
than three hundred thousand years.

   "Every trace of intelligent and stupid men, of the beautiful and
ugly, successful and unsuccesful, right and wrong, is effaced. And
whether quickly or slowly is the only point of difference.

   "If anybody cares for one hour's blame or praise <span
id="page_60">p. 60</span> so much that, by torturing his spirit and
body, he struggles for a name lasting some hundred years after his
death, can the halo of glory revive his dried bones, or give it back the
joy of living?"
