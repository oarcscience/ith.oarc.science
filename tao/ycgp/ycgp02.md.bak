## CHAPTER II <span class="small">REAL AND FALSE GREATNESS</span>

Y<span class="small">ANG</span> C<span class="small">HU</span> said:

   "Kuan Ching filled his post as a minister of Ch’i in the following
way. When his sovereign was wanton he was wanton too; when his sovereign
was prodigal he was also prodigal. He met his wishes and obeyed him;
following the right path, he made the kingdom prosper. But after the
king's death, he was only Mr. Kuan again. Nothing more.

   "But when Tien was minister of Ch’i he behaved as follows. When his
sovereign was overbearing he was condescending. When his sovereign
collected taxes he distributed money. Thus the people admired him, and
in consequence he <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> entered into the
possession of the kingdom of Ch’i. His descendants hold it to this
day.<span id="page_38_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_38_note_1.md)

   "If anybody has real greatness he is poor; if his greatness is
spurious, he is rich."

   Yang Chu said:

   "The really good man is not famous; if he be famous, he is not really
a good man, for all fame is nothing but falsehood.

   "Of old Yao and Shun pretended to yield the empire to Hsu-yu and
Shan-Chuan, but they did not lose it, and enjoyed happiness for a
hundred years.

   "Po Yo and Shu-Ch’i really abdicated on account of the Prince Ku-Chu,
and lost their kingdom at last, finally dying of starvation on the
mountain of Shou-Yang.<span

   "This is the difference between the real and false."

<span id="page_38_note_1"></span>[1](#page_38_fr_1.md) Kuan Chang died 645
<span class="small">B.C.</span> Tien became King of Ch’i 370 <span

<span id="page_38_note_2"></span>[2](#page_38_fr_2.md) The Prince of
Ku-Chu, the father of these two brothers, had appointed the younger
brother Shu-Ch’i to be his successor. The latter not wishing to deprive
his brother, and the former not desiring to act against his father's
will, both left the principality and died in poverty.
