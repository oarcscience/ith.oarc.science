## CHAPTER VII <span class="small">DUTY TO THE LIVING AND THE DEAD</span>

Y<span class="small">ANG</span> C<span class="small">HU</span> said:

   "There is an old saying, 'We must pity the living and part with the
dead.' This is a good saying.

   "Pity does not merely consist in an unusual feeling.

   "So we may give the feverish rest, satiety to the hungry, warmth to
the cold, and assistance to the miserable; but for the dead, when we
have rightly bewailed them, to what use is it to place pearls and jewels
in their mouths, or to dress them in state robes, or offer animals in
sacrifice, or to expose effigies of paper?"
