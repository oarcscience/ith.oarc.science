## CHAPTER IX <span class="small">THE HAPPY VOLUPTUARIES</span>

T<span class="small">SE</span>-C<span class="small">HAN</span> was
Minister in Cheng, and governed for three years, and governed well.<span
id="page_45_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_45_note_1.md)

   The good people complied with his injunctions, and the bad were in
awe of his prohibitory laws.

   So Cheng was governed, and the princes were afraid of it.

   Tse-Chan had an elder brother, Kung-Sun-Chow, and a younger,
Kung-Sun-Mu. The former was fond of feasting and the latter of
gallantry.

   In the house of Kung-Sun-Chow a thousand barrels of wine were stored,
and yeast in piled-up heaps.

   Within a hundred paces from the door the smell of drugs and liquor
offended people's noses.

   He was so much under the influence of wine that he ignored the
feeling of remorse, was unconscious of the safe and dangerous parts of
the path of life; what was present or wanting in his <span
id="page_46">p. 46</span> house, the near or remote degrees of
relationship,<span id="page_46_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_46_note_1.md) the
various degrees of relationship, the joy of living and the sadness of
death.

   Water, fire and swords might almost touch his person, and he would be
unaware of it.

   Within the house of Kung-Sun-Mu there was a compound of about thirty
or forty houses, which he filled with damsels of exquisite beauty. So
much was he captivated by their charms, that he neglected his relatives
and friends, broke off all family intercourse, and retiring into his
inner court turned night into day.

   Within three months he only came forth once and yet he still did not
feel contented.

   Was there a pretty girl in the neighbourhood, he would try to win her
with bribes or allurements, and only desisted with the impossibility of
obtaining his desires.

   Tse-Chan pondering over these things, stealthily betook himself to
Teng-hsi to consult him, and said:

   "I have heard that the care for one's own person has its influence on
the family, and the care taken of a family influences the state. That is
to say, starting from the nearest one reaches to what is distant. I have
taken care of my kingdom, but my own family is in disorder. Perhaps this
way is not the right one. What am I <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> to
do? what measures am I to take to save these two men?"

   Teng-hsi replied:

   "I have wondered for a long while at you. But I did not dare to speak
to you first. Why do you not always control them? Administer
exhortations based on the importance of life and nature, or admonitions
regarding the sublimity of righteousness and proper conduct."

   Tse-Chan did as Teng-hsi had advised, and taking an opportunity of
seeing his brothers said to them:

   "That in which man is superior to beasts and birds are his mental
faculties. Through them he gets righteousness and propriety, and so
glory and rank fall to his share. You are only moved by what excites
your sense, and indulge only in licentious desires, endangering your
lives and natures.

   "Hear my words. Repent in the morning, and in the evening you will
have already gained the wage that will support you."

   Chow and Mu said:

   "Long ago we knew it and made our choice.

   "Nor had we to wait for your instructions to enlighten us.

   "It is very difficult to preserve life, and easy to come by one's
death. Yet who would think of awaiting death, which comes so easily, on
account of the difficulty of preserving life?

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

   "You value proper conduct and righteousness in order to excel before
others, and you do violence to your feelings and nature in striving for
glory. That to us appears to be worse than death.

   "Our only fear is lest, wishing to gaze our fill at all the beauties
of this one life, and to exhaust all the pleasures of the present years,
the repletion of the belly should prevent us from drinking what our
palate delights in, or the slackening of our strength not allow us to
revel with pretty women.

   "We have no time to trouble about bad reputations or mental dangers.
Therefore for you to argue with us and disturb our minds merely because
you surpass others in ability to govern, and to try and allure us with
promises of glory and appointments, is indeed shameful and deplorable.

   "But we will now settle the question with you.

   "See now. If anybody knows how to regulate external things, the
things do not of necessity become regulated, and his body has still to
toil and labour. But if anybody knows how to regulate internals, the
things go on all right, and the mind obtains peace and rest.

   "Your system of regulating external things will do temporarily and
for a single kingdom, but it is not in harmony with the human heart,
while our method of regulating internals can be <span id="page_49">p.
49</span> extended to the whole universe, and there would be no more
princes and ministers.

   "We always desired to propagate this doctrine of ours, and now you
would teach us yours."

   Tse-Chan in his perplexity found no answer.

   Later on he met and informed Teng-hsi.

   Teng-hsi said:

   "You are living together with real men without knowing it.

   "Who calls you wise? Cheng has been governed by chance, and without
merit of yours."
