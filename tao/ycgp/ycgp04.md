## CHAPTER IV <span class="small">DEATH THE EQUALISER</span>

Y<span class="small">ANG</span> C<span class="small">HU</span> said:

   "That in which all beings differ is life, that in which they are all
alike is death.

   "During life there is the difference of intelligence and dullness,
honour and meanness, but in death there is the equality of rottenness
and putrefaction. Neither can be prevented. Although intelligence and
dullness, honour and meanness exist, no human power can affect them,
just as rottenness and putrefaction cannot be prevented. Human beings
cannot make life and <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> death, intelligence
and stupidity, honourableness and meanness, what they are, for all
beings live and die equally, are equally wise and stupid, honourable and
mean.

   "Some die at the age of ten, some at one hundred. The wise and
benevolent die as the cruel and imbecile.

   "In life they are known as Yao and Shun<span
id="page_41_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_41_note_1); dead they are so many
bones which cannot be distinguished. But if we hasten to enjoy our life,
we have no time to trouble about what comes after death."
