## CHAPTER XVI <span class="small">THE NATURE OF MAN</span>

Y<span class="small">ANG</span> C<span class="small">HU</span> said:

   "Men resemble heaven and earth in that they cherish five
principles.<span id="page_60_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_60_note_1.md) Of all
creatures, man is the most skilful. His nails and teeth do not suffice
to procure him maintenance and shelter. His skin and sinews do not
suffice to defend him; though running he cannot attain profit nor escape
harm, and he has neither hair nor feathers to protect him from the cold
and heat. He is thus compelled to use things to nourish his nature, to
rely on his intelligence, and not to put his confidence in brute force;
therefore intelligence is appreciated because it preserves us and brute
force despised because it encroaches upon things.

   "But I am not the owner of my own body, for I, when I am born, must
complete it, nor do I possess things, for having got them, I must part
with them again. The body is essential for birth, but things are
essential for its maintenance.

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

   "If there were a body born complete I could not possess it, and I
could not possess things not to be parted with. For possessing a body or
things would be unlawfully appropriating a body belonging to the whole
universe, and appropriating things belonging to the universe which no
sage would do.

   "He who regards as common property a body appertaining to the
universe and the things of the of the universe is a perfect man.

   "And that is the highest degree of perfection."
