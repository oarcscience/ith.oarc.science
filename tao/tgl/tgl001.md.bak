### FOREWORD

   The two articles by Dr. Evan Morgan which appeared more than ten
years ago in the Journal of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic
Society were the harbingers of this volume. The first article, in the
1922 issue, was based on the twelfth essay of Huai Nan Tzû and had the
alternative title of "The operations and manifestations of the Tao
examplified in history, or the Tao confirmed by history." Either of
these titles is a long paraphrase of the cryptic title of the original
Tao Yin. The contrast between the verbose title in Ennlish, which tries
to reveal the meaning, and the laconic prototype in Chinese, which
successfully conceals it, may be taken as an instructive introduction to
the study of ancient Taoist philosophy in the terms and according to the
norms of western philosophy. The second article, which may be found in
the 1923 Journal, discusses "The Taoist Superman"—chih jên. In these two
contributions one may enter the portals of this volume.

   In early issues of the Journal, phases of Taoism were discussed in
two papers by Dr. Edkins. In the China Review, this subject has been
discussed by Giles, Balfour, Mears and Faber. In the Sacred Books of the
East, Dr. Legge has given a translation of some Taoist texts. Up to the
present, the chief interest of these and other European scholars has
been centered in the Tao Tê Ching and in the T‛ai Shang Kan Yin P‛ien.
This is not strange; for it is only in recent years that there has been,
even among Chinese scholars, a revival of interest in other writers
belonging to the Tao Chia. In 1921, Liu Wen-tien published a new edition
of the Huai Nan Hung Lieh Chi Chieh based upon the 1788 edition of
Chuang K‛uei-chi. An able preface to Liu's book was written by Hu Shih
who in 1931 himself published a small brochure on the writings of the
Prince of Huai Nan. In 1924 Wu Ch‛ing-shih issued a small volume on the
text of the Huai Nan <span id="page_ii">p. ii</span> writings. These
recent books by Chinese writers have been chiefly occupied with textual
criticism; but Dr. Morgan's interest is in the contents. Like all
westerners his mind is analytic. He wants to know the why and the
wherefore. What is the Tao? He defines it as the Cosmic Spirit. Thence
he proceeds to discuss the response of matter to this Cosmic Spirit, the
transforming power of this Cosmic Spirit, in creation, beginning and
reality and other allied metaphysical problems. Dr. Morgan combines an
accurate knowledge of the meaning of the text with a sound understanding
of the teachings of western philosophy. The obscurities of the original
text are illuminated by his rare scholarship, and thus the reader is
able to obtain a fair concept of the ideas of the young Prince.

   These writings of the early philosophers of the Tao school are not
easy to understand. They are characterized by freedom in the expression
of ideas and by liberality of thought as contrasted with the recorded
sayings of the Ju school represented by Confucius and Mencius; but their
fundamental basis is a conception of nature, unknown to western
philosophy. In all of the philosophies which have sprung from Egypt or
Mesopotamia and been developed by Greece or Rome, the intellectual power
of man has been projected into his conception of the deity. God is
thought of as the All-Wise, the intelligent Creator of an intelligible
universe. With the early Chinese it was the physical side of man, his
power of procreation, that gave the first clue to the mystery of nature.
Male and female among themselves, and in the animal life about them,
were the source of new life; and it was only to them a natural extension
of this known principle to an unknown material world which caused them
to believe in the dual powers of nature, male and female, yin and yang.
Spontaneity is the original law of creation. Male and female follow
their own propensities, and new life is the resultant. This is a
dualistic philosophy, but it is not the dualism of mind and matter, nor
of good and evil, but of male and female. It is this fundamental <span
id="page_iii">p. iii</span> difference in conception as to the origin of
things, between the Mediterranean schools of thought and the Chinese,
that makes it so difficult, and at times almost misleading, to translate
early Taoist terms into western languages.

   The word Tao is a case in point. Dr. Morgan renders it as Cosmic
Spirit and perhaps has hit upon as a good a term as can be found. In my
Chinese Mythology I had translated it as Nature, for it is the great
force which sustains Heaven and Earth. By it the sky revolves; while the
earth remains motionless. It causes the winds to rise, the clouds to
gather, the thunder to roll and the rain to fall. All things follow this
natural bent; and, from their male and female instincts, life is
continuous. With such a conception as to Tao, shall this term be
translated Nature or Cosmic Spirit? The question need only to be asked
to call forth the answer that both show the limitations of translating
composite characters, like Tao, into an alphabetic term. Tao is Nature;
but it is more; it is Nature at work. It is also more than Cosmic
Spirit, for in it inheres the idea of a Spirit in spontaneous activity.

   Philosophic consistency in the accepted western sense cannot be
expected of these early Taoist teachings. They never remind me of Plato
or Socrates, but always of Philo Judaeus, an English translation of
whose works may be found in Bohn's Ecclesiastical Library. Philo used an
allegorical method of interpretation in his attempt to reconcile the
statements of the divinely inspired Hebrew Scriptures with the
speculations of Greek philosophers. The ideas of Plato were identified
as the angels of the Old Testament, and they are all collected into a
divine world-spirit, the logos, which, in the opinion of Philo, remained
a cosmic power without personality. This logos of Philo resembles
closely the Tao of the Prince of Huai Nan, but without the sexual
implication of the latter. This logos of Philo is very different from
the Johannine conception which approaches closely to the Chinese idea of
Wên, as a manifestation of the Tao.

   The task which Dr. Morgan set for himself has required long years of
quiet research and patient toil; but he has the reward of giving to our
western world the first adequate translation of the work of Liu An, the
unhappy and ill-fated Prince of Huai Nan.
