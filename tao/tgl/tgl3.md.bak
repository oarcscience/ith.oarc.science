   "As for the soul of man, "the bounds of the soul," said Heraclitus,
"thou could'st not by going discover though thou didst travel every
road: so deep a *logos* hath it." Logos is one of Heraclitus' chief
contributions to philosophy, a cosmic principle, actively intelligent
and thinking, and operative in man and in all nature, rational and
divine."

   "Nature tries to hide herself and eyes and ears are bad witnesses to
such as have barbarian souls", said Heraclitus. The harmony of all
things will not be obvious. But, in any case, underlying the variety of
things, is unity: and they speculated, as to what the unity is. Is water
the substance of all things, or fire, or the vaguer 'infinite'? They
extended the reign of law to all phenomena."

   "He, without toil, rules all things by his will."

From *Progress in Religion* by Dr. T. R. Glover.

DISSERTATION ON  
LIFE AND SOUL  
OR  
THE KEEPER OF LIFE

{[notes](tgln1.htm#3)\|[elucidations and analyses](tgln2.htm#3.md)}

   *The title in Chinese is ching shen \#\#\#. Ching is the breath of
life the material generation—the original endowment of the body. Shen is
the soul-life in man. It may mean body and soul, or spirit and soul.
There is implied in the words the sense of guardianship which has
suggested the alternative title of KEEPER of LIFE.*

   Of old, before the creation of Heaven and Earth, I consider there was
the void without form or shape; profound, opaque, vast, immobile,
impalpable and still: it was a nebulosity, infinite, unfathomable,
abysmal, a vasty deep without clue of class or genera. The twin and
undivided divinities were born (born together and undivided), who
superintended the way of Heaven and organized the path of the Earth.
Deep-like indeed! No end could be discerned. Great-like indeed! No limit
could be set. At a juncture, the divinities Yin and Yang were

|                        |
|------------------------|
| **Order of creation.** |

separated and the eight points of the universe were resolved: the hard
and soft being mutually united (cooperation of the Yin and Yang),
creation assumed form. The murky elements went to form reptiles: the
finer essence went to form man. Hence, spirit belongs to Heaven and the
physical belongs to Earth. When the spirit returns to the gate of Heaven
and the body seeks its origin, how can I exist? The "I" is dissolved.

   The Sage-man, therefore, learns of Heaven and follows nature. He
should not be tied by convention nor enticed <span id="page_59">p.
59</span>

|                                      |
|--------------------------------------|
| **Absence of equilibrium is death.** |

by the sophism of man. He looks to Heaven as father and Earth as mother:
on Yin and Yang as the determining principles and the four seasons as
the fundamental periodicity. Heaven is in *repose*<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](tgln1.htm#3_note_1.md) by purity. Earth is *stable*
through *tranquility*.<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](tgln1.htm#3_note_2.md)
When these are absent in creation death ensues. The imitation of these
principles is life. The Repose, being boundless, forms the dwelling of
the soul. The Unconditioned<span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](tgln1.htm#3_note_3.md) is the abode of the Tao. Hence,
should it be sought from without it will be missed within: should

|                                    |
|------------------------------------|
| **The Tao is within and without.** |

it be held as being alone within, it will be lost without, just as root
and branch, which may be taken in illustration, train from the root
outwards, the thousand branches and myriad leaves follow without
failure.<span id="fr_4"></span>[4](tgln1.htm#3_note_4.md)

   Now the soul is that which is received from Heaven: the physical form
is what is received from Earth. Hence the saying: "One begets two; two
begets three; three begets all things."<span
id="fr_5"></span>[5](tgln1.htm#3_note_5.md)

   Creation's back is Yin (it rests downward on earth); its front is
Yang (it embraces and looks up to Heaven):

|                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|
| **The body has correspondence in the cosmos.** |

the unity of the two is the harmonizing organ through which all form
attains birth. Hence the saying, "there is an embryo in a month: which
is covered with skin in the second month: in the third and fourth there
is tissue and more definite shape: in the fifth there is muscle: bone in
the sixth: it completes itself in the seventh: moves in the eighth: is
active in the ninth and there is parturition in the tenth. When the body
is perfect the Five Viscera<span
id="fr_6"></span>[6](tgln1.htm#3_note_6.md) have form. The lungs regulate
the eye, the kidneys regulate the nose, the gall the mouth, the liver
the ear. The senses are the outward and the viscera the inward
regulators. The opening and closing, the expansion and contraction,<span
id="fr_6"></span>[6](tgln1.htm#3_note_6.md) each of these has its fixed
work. Hence the head is round like the shape of the dome of Heaven: the
foot is square like the Earth.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

   Heaven has the Four Seasons, the Five Elements, the Nine Cardinal
Points and the 366 days. These find a correspondence in Man's four
limbs, five viscera, nine passages or orifices of the body and the 366
joints and branches. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, heat; and man has the
activities of giving and taking, or reciprocity of feelings, and
emotions of joy and anger. Therefore, the gall may bear correspondence
to vapour (cloud),<span id="fr_7"></span>[7](tgln1.htm#3_note_7.md) the
lungs to breath,

|                        |
|------------------------|
| **Harmony necessary.** |

the liver to wind, the kidneys to rain. The spleen corresponds to
thunder. Thus man, heaven and earth are mutually intermixed and
inter-related. The heart is the master. Therefore, the eyes and ears are
as the sun and moon. The humours of the body as the wind and rain.
Within the sun we have the bird standing on three-legs, and the
three-legged toad in the moon.<span
id="fr_8"></span>[8](tgln1.htm#3_note_8.md) Were the sun and moon to miss
their course, we should have the calamity of eclipse and loss of light.
Should the winds and rains fail, life would be destroyed and plagues
arise. Should the five stars<span
id="fr_9"></span>[9](tgln1.htm#3_note_9.md) fail in their courses the
several kingdoms would be doomed to disaster.

   The Way of Heaven and Earth is great and boundless:<span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](tgln1.htm#3_note_10.md) nevertheless it conserves
its variegated lights and avoids all waste. Eyes and ears cannot be
expected to last for ever and work without rest. How can spirit ever
speed

|                         |
|-------------------------|
| **Restraint required.** |

on, without coming to exhaustion? Therefore, the constitution (animal
energies) is man's bloom of vitality, and the five viscera his sap.
Nevertheless, when the animal energies are one with the five viscera and
do not strain, the chest and stomach will be full<span
id="fr_11"></span>[11](tgln1.htm#3_note_11.md) and there will be no
overdraft on the powers through the waste arising from desires. When the
chest and stomach are full, and there is no overdraft through

|                                              |
|----------------------------------------------|
| **The physical co-operates with the moral.** |

desires, the eyes, and ears are clear, and the seeing and hearing are
effective. When the eye and ear are clear, the seeing and hearing
effective, it may be said there is understanding. When the five viscera
conform to the leadings <span id="page_61">p. 61</span> of the heart and
do not issue in vicious humours, evil purpose is dispersed; when the
breath (Ch‛i) is not scattered and there is no aberration in action, the
spirit is exuberant. When the breath is not wasted and the spirit is
exuberant we have order: with order comes equal adjustment: with equal
adjustment comes clarity: with clarity comes spirituality of ideas: with
this spirituality nothing is

|                      |
|----------------------|
| **Economy of life.** |

invisible to the sight and nothing is unheard by the ear; nothing is
unaccomplished in action. Hence trouble and distress are not able to
enter and find a lodgement: nor can a noxious humour find an occasion of
clinging. Hence when a search is made for it (Tao) in the far distance
it is not found: when found it is in the person unconsciously; though
unperceived, it is present. Hence when the search is over a wide range
the acquirement is little: the more that is seen the less is the real
understanding.<span id="fr_12"></span>[12](tgln1.htm#3_note_12.md)

   Now the orifices are doors and windows of the spirit: breath and will
are the messengers and signals of the five viscera, i.e., the animal
life. When the eyes and ears are

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| **When desire predominates, life is confused.** |

under the allurements of colour and sound then the passions (five
viscera) are moved and not in a state of rest. When this is the case
flesh and blood sweep onward in their sensuousness unceasingly: then, in
turn, the spirit gallops forth wildly into the outward world of sense
and does not guard itself within its self-contained domain.<span
id="fr_13"></span>[13](tgln1.htm#3_note_13.md) When this condition is
reached, the coming of distress and joy, though mountainously great, is
not understood. On the contrary, were the ear and eye clear and pure
without the allurement of desires: the breath and will simple and
unalloyed, happy and contented and few in its appetites: the animal life
reposeful, not being wasted and scattered: the spirit self-possessed and
centred within the bodily frame

|                   |
|-------------------|
| **The contrary.** |

and not scattered without: when these conditions exist, it would follow
that the past ages could be known and the coming events of the <span
id="page_62">p. 62</span> future could be seen, and even more than this
could be done.<span id="fr_14"></span>[14](tgln1.htm#3_note_14.md) Hence it
is said a large exploration only gives a little knowledge. That is to
say the spirit should not be

|                                  |
|----------------------------------|
| **Four elements of corruption.** |

exercised in the extraneous. Look within. The five colours confuse the
eye, causing it to lose its clarity. The five tones derange the ear,
leading to loss of true perception. The five flavours disorganise the
palate, causing it to injure the taste, likes and dislikes confuse the
heart, causing it to lose its proper course in action. These four, i.e.
the five colours, the five sounds, the five tastes, likes and dislikes,
though they are the means by which life is carried on, yet, involve all
men in their toils. Hence the saying, appetites induce loss of spirit:
love and hate give rise to travail in the hearts of men. If they are not
quickly dominated, a daily waste of will-power follows. These are
reasons why people are unable to run the full course of life, being
overtaken by a destiny which arrests it midway, and caught untimely in
the meshes of retribution. Why so? There is excessive indulgence in the
illicit use of the senses.<span
id="fr_15"></span>[15](tgln1.htm#3_note_15.md) There is too much attention
given to the life of the senses. The full life would be attained by a
denial of the sensuous.

   There is mutual correspondence in the fluxes of Nature. Creation is
governed by unity. When this unity is comprehended there is nothing
which is not apprehended. But through ignorance of this universal unity
(The Tao) it is not possible to know any one thing.<span
id="fr_16"></span>[16](tgln1.htm#3_note_16.md) For example, I am placed in
the world and count also as a unit in it. May it not be that creation
must have me to make it complete; would it be perfect without me?
Nevertheless, I am a parcel of matter and creation is matter and I am
matter. Why name each and other? We are all one matter. Nevertheless, is
life, given me by Heaven, of any worth that it adds to the value of
creation or would my annihilation be any injury to it? Further, since
the Creator made me an ignorant clod, i.e., a man, I must submit to its
decrees. How then <span id="page_63">p. 63</span> may it be said that
the invalid who seeks a leach, desiring to prolong his life, is not
mistaken? How may it be sure that the man who seeks death by suicide is
not happy in

|                           |
|---------------------------|
| **Value of personality.** |

his attempt? It may be that life will be but slavery and death would be
a rest and surcease from toils. Life is but a vague mystery (vast
wilderness) who knows what it signifies? Shall the Creator be asked not
to give life? Shall he be asked not to give death? Desiring life yet not
striving for it, disliking death and yet not refusing it. If my
condition in life is humble, I will not despise it; if honourable, yet I
will not rejoice. Waiting on the times of Heaven (or Nature) the *True
Man* does not rush to prolong life. In life I have a seven-foot body, in
death I have a coffin-length of soil. As a living being, I add one to
the kind of those who have form: just as, in death, I sink into the
formless kind. Thus the sum of matter is not increased by my living:
even the thickness of the soil is not swelled by my death. How then
should I feel the joy of life or sorrow of death, the gain of one or
loss of the other?

   Again, the Creator's moulding and guidance of matter may be
illustrated by the potter's kneading of clay. He takes it from the soil
and having made it into a bason or dish it is still not different from
what it was in the soil, since, when the vessel is broken, it gets
dispersed and returns again to its source: and in this state it is in no
wise different in nature from a plate or bason as made. The people who
live in villages bordering on the river lead its waters to irrigate
their gardens, to which the water has no objection. The poor people
disgusted with the filthy pools around drain them into the flowing
river, but the foul water feels no exhilaration. Therefore, there is no
difference whether the water is in the river or irrigating the garden:
it is a matter of indifference to the water whether it lies in the
filthy pool or in the flowing Chiang.<span
id="fr_17"></span>[17](tgln1.htm#3_note_17.md) Therefore the Sage rests
satisfied with his position, whether high or low, and joyfully follows
his work and avocation of Sage.

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

   Grief and joy are aberrations from virtue (tê): pleasure and anger
are the excesses of man trying to follow Tao: love and hate are the
exasperations of the mind. Therefore the saying, "life is as the change
of the seasons: death is as the flux of matter." Immobile, it is
inactive with Yin (negative, all avenues are closed up): mobile, it is
active with Yang, (positive, all avenues open out). The spirit begins
pure, unadulterated, with a fund of tranquility, and undisturbed by the
friction of life, has the world at

|                         |
|-------------------------|
| **Pearl of the heart.** |

his feet in virtue. The heart is the master of the physical body and the
spirit is the pearl of the heart. When the body travels without rest
there ensues a collapse: when the spirit is ceaselessly used exhaustion
will follow. Hence the Sage esteems and respects the body and the spirit
and dares not abuse them. Think of the semi-circular seal of jade
belonging to Hsia Hou's family.<span
id="fr_18"></span>[18](tgln1.htm#3_note_18.md) It was locked in a box and
put in a safe because it was most precious. But how precious the spirit!
It is to be prized even more than the seal of Hou-Hsia. Therefore, the
Sage responding to everything with an unbiassed mind,<span
id="fr_18"></span>[18](tgln1.htm#3_note_18.md) with a mind free from
prepossession, he approaches all facts, and must investigate the law
that governs them. Spending his life in the spirit of sweet
reasonableness, unmoved by sensuous desire, necessarily he looks
thoroughly into the economy of things and so completes his life in
peaceful happiness. Hence he does not separate himself very much from
the one nor is attached overmuch to the other.<span
id="fr_19"></span>[19](tgln1.htm#3_note_19.md) He cherishes virtue, and, he

|                                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| **Mind sees things through the spirit.** |

warms himself at the fires of harmony that he may be in line with
Heaven. He is in agreement with the Tao; he is neighbour of virtue. He
does not put happiness first nor is he the first to create
distress.<span id="fr_20"></span>[20](tgln1.htm#3_note_20.md) The aura and
soul are domiciled in his home, (the body), and the Spirit guards the
vital root. Death and life make no difference to him. So the name "Most
Spiritual."

   He who is named the True Man,<span
id="fr_21"></span>[21](tgln1.htm#3_note_21.md) implies an identity <span
id="page_65">p. 65</span> of his nature with the Tao. Thoroughly
equipped he yet

|                   |
|-------------------|
| **The True Man.** |

gives the appearance of having nothing, (like an immortal). Reality is
he, yet he gives the appearance of being witless. He stands on the one
thing (The Tao) with undivided attention and has no second thing in
mind: he enriches his inner life without being governed by the
affections, such as *like* and *dislike*.<span
id="fr_22"></span>[22](tgln1.htm#3_note_22.md) Conscious of the primordial
simplicity

|                     |
|---------------------|
| **His principles.** |

of being, he does not strive (for the decorations of an outward culture)
but reverts to (pristine and unadultered) simplicity. He is concerned
with foundations, he protects the spirit that he may soar to the
circumference of the Universe. Far and wide, at pleasure, (or following
his own volition) he soars beyond this "world of dirt": and suspires in
the sphere

|               |
|---------------|
| **His acts.** |

of *wu wei*, spirit-action. How vast and wide his attainments! He
harbours no scheme of cunning in his heart: hence life and death are
both great and dignified: they are alike. Though the firmament covers
and the earth sustains all, yet he is not tied to them (but maintains an
independency): the spirit is above the fluxes.

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Life in the Spirit has the great quality of stillness.** |

True in his judgments, free from defects, by which evil could enter, he
has no controversies with life.<span
id="fr_23"></span>[23](tgln1.htm#3_note_23.md) Though the world is
empirical,<span id="fr_23"></span>[23](tgln1.htm#3_note_23.md) and tries
this and that method, one essays thas another that, but he sticks to
principles. Such an one as this is verily in harmony with his being,
depending not on the sight of the eye or the hearing of the ear or on
courage, he has his heart and purpose governed by the spirit within. The
will is concentrated on the inner life: he is permeated with and a
partner of the Tao-Unity. He lives in a state of unconciousness of his
actions, he is unaware of whither he goes: i.e., he is not uncertain how
to act, the spirit is clear

|                  |
|------------------|
| **Achievement.** |

and will guide action unerringly.<span
id="fr_24"></span>[24](tgln1.htm#3_note_24.md) He comes and goes as it were
mechanically and his actions are prompt. There is no physically prompted
action, <span id="page_66">p. 66</span> the heart is as dead ashes. All
material things are as nothing. Without learning he knows; without
seeing he sees; without doing he achieves; without immediate study he
can discuss; he responds to influence; he only moves under stress. Thus,
he moves forward without choice and

|                  |
|------------------|
| **Inner light.** |

as a result of this influence there is a flash as from light and a
shadow as of substance.<span id="fr_25"></span>[25](tgln1.htm#3_note_25.md)
With the Tao as the rule of life, he waits, in this spirit, on every
thing, in secret. He preserves the foundation of the Great Purity
entertaining none of the appetites: matter in no way seduces him. He is
impervious to the sway of the senses and free from anxieties. Were you
to heat a great lake of water it wouldn't make him feel hot: if you were
to freeze the rivers, he wouldn't feel their cold: if the thunderstorm
sundered the mountains, he wouldn't be

|                       |
|-----------------------|
| **Is master of all.** |

frightened: if raging tornadoes obscured the day he wouldn't be
perturbed. Such is the man whose heart is fixed on the Tao. The senses
have no power to disturb him. Hence the sight of a precious jade or
jewel affects him no more than an ordinary stone. An interview with the
emperor does not flurry him more than the visit of an ordinary guest. A
sight of the two beauties Mao Ch‛iang and Hsi Shih stirs him no more
than a sight of an ugly person would.

   Death and life are looked on as but a transformation: the myriad
creation is all of a kind, there is a kinship through all. Being one in
essence with the fundamental of the Great purity he moves in the realm
of the formless.

|                                    |
|------------------------------------|
| **The soul is part of the whole.** |

He does not pollute the essence, nor abuse the spirit, i.e., he does not
sully the pristine element of life nor waste the energies of the spirit.
The soul is a hving part of a whole universe, and is placed in an
environment of great clarity. Therefore he does not dream during his
sleep: the intelligence is not dimmed; the spirit maintaining its own
unity, his knowledge is not mixed with scheming concepts. The animal
spirits are not depressed nor is the spirit too buoyant. <span
id="page_67">p. 67</span> His activities and movements, from first to
last, are of a homogeneity. Closing the eyes on the world of sense, he
lives in the abstruse realms of the Tao, yet he sees as

|                     |
|---------------------|
| **House of light.** |

though he were in a house full of light. Reposing in this ideal realm
(not in the crooked ways of schemes) he takes his flight into regions of
formless space. Living in regions that could not be visualized, roaming
without a fixed location, his movements have no vestiges, his
tranquility no substance. In being, he is as one lost, living, he is as
one dead: he can go in and out through the impenetrable; the ghosts of
the dead and of the divinities are his ministers. He probes into the
unfathomable, he penetrates into the unspatial since the Tao transmits
the varied forms. The beginning and end are as a circle, so others can't
find the truth. *This is the wherefore of the spirit*. All *life hangs
together in the Tao*. This spirituality mounts aloft to the

|                                             |
|---------------------------------------------|
| **Gymnastic exercises will not get** *tao.* |

Tao. This is the peregrination of the Perfect Man. As to such motions as
breathing and blowing, inhaling and exhaling, spitting out the old,
drawing in the new breath, imitating in gymnastic the steps of the bear,
the fluttering and expanding of the wings of birds, the ablutions of the
duck, the stooping of the gibbon, the glare of the owl, the concentrated
stare of the tiger,—these motions are the means used by man to cultivate
the bodily form.<span id="fr_26"></span>[26](tgln1.htm#3_note_26.md) The
Perfect Man does not bother his mind about them. They are those things
that disarrange and confuse the mind. When the spirit in its
peregrinations does not lose its abundance of life, and when it never
deteriorates it will ever have the everlasting vernal vivifications of
matter.<span id="fr_27"></span>[27](tgln1.htm#3_note_27.md) In this unison
with the *tao*, the seasonable transformations take place in the heart.
Without disorder of time, or detriment to matter there is ample
benevolence. Moreover should some disability or disease strike the
bodily frame, or should it undergo change this would in no wise harm the
spirit. Should the earthly tenement fail the spirit is in no way <span
id="page_68">p. 68</span>

|                                     |
|-------------------------------------|
| **Body may decay soul never dies.** |

destroyed. Should a man be leprous, for instance, he still can walk and
the purpose of the mind is in no wise changed, during life. Should a
person, on the other hand, be seized with madness, his physical form is
not despoiled, but the spirit is about to take its flight and pass
beyond its bounds. No one can ever say what a madman will do next.
Though the form dies the spirit does not die, because that which can
undergo no change supplies and responds to that which

|                              |
|------------------------------|
| **The Spirit does not die.** |

is subject to change, and to the myriad fluctuations and thousand
changes which never come to an end. That which is subject to death
reverts, in turn, to the formless. That which does not change lives on
with Heaven and Earth. Wood dies because the sap has left it. But can
wood give life to itself? That which gives body to the form is not the
form itself: (it is *Ch‛i*, vitalism.) The Giver of life has never died,
but that which it begets is subject to death. That which causes the flux
of matter (Tao) does not undergo the flux, but what it changes undergoes
the change. He who makes light of the world, or thinks little of empire,
has an undivided heart and an untroubled spirit. He looks on death and
life as being of a piece. Viewing life as a minor affair, he has no
fears. Cognisant of the flux of life, the understanding is free from
perplexity and void of doubts. Seeing that the multitude looks on this
doctrine as so many idle words let me give a few examples to
substantiate it.

   The reason why people think it a matter of joy to be masters of men
is that these have all that the senses can desire, and can command all
those luxuries that minister to the comfort of the person. Lofty fabrics
and storied palaces people affect and covet: yet Yao did not decorate

|                             |
|-----------------------------|
| **Great men lived simply.** |

his house, nor carve and paint his palace columns. Rare delicacies of
unusual taste are things people like, but Yao lived on the simplest fare
and the plainest soups. Embroidered white <span id="page_69">p.
69</span> fox furs are what people covet, but Yao covered his person
with the plainest calico, and a deer skin fended off the cold. He did
not regale himself with luxuries more than others, but he superimposed
the anxieties of office on himself. Hence in transferring the empire to
Shun,<span id="fr_28"></span>[28](tgln1.htm#3_note_28.md) the act was not
simply a matter of renunciation, but truly a release from burden. This
was really to think little of the glories of empire.

   Yü travelled south inspecting the Empire, and when crossing the River
a yellow dragon shouldered the boat. The boatmen changed colour, but Yü,
smiling genially said, "I'm doing my utmost in the interest of the
people, discharging my duties in obedience to Heaven. Living, I'm but a
guest, dying I return home. Why should we be

|                      |
|----------------------|
| **and worked hard.** |

disturbed in our peace? The sight of a dragon is no more than a lizard."
Since he didn't turn colour, the dragon pressed his ears and dropping
his tail departed. Yü thought it a little matter to see monstrous
animals.

   A ghost-like witch of Cheng, telling the fortune of Hu Tzŭ Lin,
thought he couldn't live long, and mentioned the fact to Lieh Tzŭ. Lieh
Tzŭ went weeping to tell Hu Tzŭ. Hu Tzŭ replied "I hold that our
spiritual nature comes from Heaven, and our physical frame from the
Earth. Honours and wealth are not lasting, death comes on apace." Thus
we see that Hu Tzŭ looked on life and death as being but the same thing.

   Tzû Ch‛iu when he was 54 years of age had an illness which left his
body deformed. The nape of his neck was higher than his head, his jaw
was bent to his chest, his lips were distorted and his head was twisted.
He crawled one day to a well and seeing his reflection in the water,
exclained: "How wonderful! Great is the work of the Creator, who hath
fashioned me in this goodly way!" The change did not disfigure the real
form, in his view.

   We may, therefore, deduce that in Yao's view of life, the empire, or
being an emperor, was of no great consequence. <span id="page_70">p.
70</span>

|                       |
|-----------------------|
| **No fear of death.** |

Considering Yü's mind it is clear that he thought empire was a paltry
affair. Probing Hu Tzû's disquisition we can see that life and death are
but two phases of the same thing, in his estimation. From the action of
Tzŭ Ch‛iu we know that the fluxes of life are governed by identical
laws.

   Now the Perfect Man<span id="fr_29"></span>[29](tgln1.htm#3_note_29.md)
leans on a support that cannot be uprooted and travels on an
unobstructed road.<span id="fr_30"></span>[30](tgln1.htm#3_note_30.md) He
is endowed with an inexhaustible store of spiritual goods

|                           |
|---------------------------|
| **Sustained by the Tao.** |

and instructed in the methods of *"no-death"*:<span
id="fr_31"></span>[31](tgln1.htm#3_note_31.md) none of his journeys are
unsuccussful: there is no avenue not open to him. Life does not clog his
mind, nor death cloud his spirit. He guards the Heavenly dispensation in
all his activities without departing from its behests. Adversity and
happiness, loss and gain, the thousand changes and myriad fluxes of life
fail to worry him. A man of this calibre preserves his pristine spirit,
and upholds his mind. Like the cicada and snake he can throw off his
mortal coil and wander in the great Empyrean. With light or airy step
and with the greatest ease he swiftly enters the sable Heaven (out of
sight).

|                           |
|---------------------------|
| **These good men great.** |

Even the phoenix cannot keep him company in pace, much less the
(fabulous) Ch‛ih Yen.<span id="fr_32"></span>[{32}](tgln1.htm#3_note_32.md)
How can Power, Emoluments, or Position influence or shrivel such a mind.
When Yen was near death, he refused to break his faith by entering into
a treaty with Ts‛ui Chu,<span
id="fr_33"></span>[{33}](tgln1.htm#3_note_33.md) the traitorous minister,
who designed to slay the king. The threats of Ts‛ui failed to shake Yen
Tzû's loyalty. Chih Hua did not fear death in battle, and so the Prince
of Lu vainly tempted him with a great bribe to stay out of battle. Hence
we gather that Yen Tzû could act under the compulsion of goodness, but
could not be frightened by military force. Chih Hua could be arrested in
his course by the power of right, could not be moved by gain.<span
id="fr_34"></span>[{34}](tgln1.htm#3_note_34.md) The superior man will die
for right, but he cannot be detained by the thoughts of honours and
gain. He was determined to do the right and could not <span
id="page_71">p. 71</span> be disturbed by fear of death.

   These men, then, had in view nothing but righteousness.<span
id="fr_35"></span>[{35}](tgln1.htm#3_note_35.md) They were not hampered by
material things. How much

|                               |
|-------------------------------|
| *Wu-wei* **man is greatest.** |

less so can worldly allurements deceive the *Man of Wu-wei*, of
spirit-action. Yao looked not on the empire as a thing of honour (to
cling to): he therefore handed it to Shun. Kung Tzû Cha conceded the
throne, as he did not consider it the chief honour of life. Tzû Kan did
not look on the possession of the jade to be true riches, so refused the
throne—the precious jade. Wu Kuang<span
id="fr_36"></span>[{36}](tgln1.htm#3_note_36.md) would not injure
righteousness by living, so he threw himself into the whirling pool (and
died).

   From these instances it is clear that the highest honour is not that
pertaining to official position: the greatest wealth is not that which
comes from worldly riches. The Empire is the very greatest thing in the
world, yet this has been relinquished (by Yao) to another. There is
nothing dearer to a man than his body, but it was thrown into the
whirlpool. Having said this the last word is said. These are the
greatest things, and in saying this all is said.

   These instances refer to people who have not been entangled by the
world,—men with spirits free from the glamour of life who do not look
upon a throne as a thing of honour to be coveted. Thinking of these men
that stand right above us, and considering their view of life, probing
their profound meaning of Tao and its works of virtue, we cannot but
blush as we look on the conventional life we live.

   Therefore an apprehension of Hsü Yu's ideas lead us to abandon the
study of the Ching Teng and Pao t‛ao, the two classics on militarism, as
having no place in the cultured life. Yen Leng Chi Tzû refused the
throne of

|                     |
|---------------------|
| **Ideals of life.** |

Wu State (to which he was entitled), which fact coming to the ear of two
men wrangling over a bit of land led them to cease their law suit. Think
of Tzû Han who laid no store by a precious jade, which <span
id="page_72">p. 72</span> act led a party that was wrangling over a
deed, a title to some property, to be ashamed of themselves. Think of Wu
Kuang who would not be contaminated by the world. These ideals of life
filled those who lusted for gain and snatched at every means of
prolonging their span of life, with uneasiness. Hence, except those
people who have a vision of the higher life, others do not realize that
existence isn't worth lusting for: except those who have heard the great
(divine) words, others do not understand that empire is not worth
hankering after.

   Let us take an illustration of our theme. In a very rustic state of
Society people sing together to the music made by striking a crock, or
tapping an ewer, and they think this is music. They do it with gusto.
But once they have heard the tapping on the taute drum, and the ringing
of the great bell, they are surprised, and the music of the crock and
ewer fills them with shame. He who has a library of good books and
cultivates his own scholarship, yet who does not understand the real
message of life, is but a disciple of the crock and ewer. Nevertheless
he who has no lust for empire is he who is concerned with the great
music. Honourable position and great profits are what men desire: but
let them have a warranty of the gift of empire in the right hand and a
knife for cutting the throat in the left (i.e., let them think that the
venture for empire will cost life), even a stupid person will refuse the
great honour if it means death. From which we gather that life is of
more value than the possession of empire, in the estimation of all. The
Sage eats just enough to keep body

|                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|
| **Externals not of the essence of life.** |

and soul together: his clothes are just enough to cover his body. These
meet his needs; he asks for no more. If he has no empire, he feels no
deprivation to his nature. Should he possess a throne there is no
accretion to his state of contentment. The possession or absence of a
kingdom makes no difference. Suppose the Ao<span
id="fr_37"></span>[37](tgln1.htm#3_note_37.md) granary were put at the
service of a man and a river of water <span id="page_73">p. 73</span>
were given him, he would eat when hungry and drink when thirsty from
these supplies. Still he can take only a peckful of grain and a ladleful
of water into his stomach. So that when he is satiated the corn in the
granary is little less in quantity, and the water in the river is not
exhausted after he has filled his belly with it. Those who have these
supplies cannot eat more than what satiates appetite. Those

|                         |
|-------------------------|
| **Simplicity of life.** |

who are without these ample supplies do not starve: that is to say it is
just the same amount they eat and drink as those who have only a small
home consumption. Great anger indicates the bursting of the Yin element
(like ice broken in pieces), and great joy the collapse of the Yang
element. Great anxiety leads to inward decay i.e., upsets

|                           |
|---------------------------|
| **Cultivate the spirit.** |

the five viscera: great fear begets nervous tension. Expel the dust of
life, get rid of the entanglements of the world: but it would be better
still if there had been no departure from the foundation (tao). That
would be the enlightenment. It would be well if there never had been
entanglement. The eye that is single will refuse to look on the world, a
trained ear will not hear the jargon of the world: the closed mouth will
not speak: the consecrated heart will not be seduced. Abandon mere human
understanding and return to the pristine nature: cultivate the spirit
and throw away scheming methods. Thus consciousness will be as though
insensible, and life will be as though it were death. When finally a
person returns to his source, he revolves into the prenatal state,
before the transformation. Death is one with life. Just think of the
tillers of the soil carrying their tools and baskets of earth: the
saltish sweat runs down in streams, the breath comes in gasps, they pant
and heave: coming on a shady tree and resting under its ample shade they
throw down their burdens, and are glad. The dead, resting within the
shade of a cave in the mountain, have much more peace and gladness than
men find in the shade of a tree. A person suffering from cancer of the
stomach <span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

|                       |
|-----------------------|
| **No fear of death.** |

beats his breast, presses his stomach, nurses his knees, knocks his head
in anguish: he sits with his legs crouched up under him, moaning all the
night long without getting sleep. In this agony should he get a moment's
relief so that he can sleep, his waiting relatives are so glad and
rejoice. But the dead who get the long night's sleep (untroubled by the
cares of the world) find a joy greater far than the patient's momentary
joy.

   He who realizes the greatness of the universe cannot fear death. He
who has the Great Law will not be enslaved in the toils of pleasures. He
who is aware of the joys of a former existence will not be alarmed by
death. He who knows that Hsü Yu's choice (refusal of a throne) was
better than Shun's will not lust for goods that serve the purpose of
gain or the gratification of desire. A wall that is built up is inferior
to its state when lying prone. How much better then if it had never been
made into a wall! The congealed ice is in a worse state than if it

|                                                |

| **The secret of life is with the man of Tao.** |

were free. How much better then if it were never crystallized at all. To
pass from non-existence to a state of existence: to pass from a state of
existence to non-existence is a continuous round without end or
beginning. It is the great Wheel of the Law. Where it all sprouts from
is not known, i.e., the end and beginning of existence is a
mystery.<span id="fr_38"></span>[38](tgln1.htm#3_note_38.md) Who can
repress the desires except he who is versed in the inner and outer view
of life, the esoteric man. Uncircumscribed infinity is most great, and
the microcosm of the Tao is most precious. He, who comprehends this
truth of the great and precious, has the Tao at his command and has all
avenues open to him.

   A corrupt and decadent age heaps up its superficial learning to gain
honours and to win a name from the studies of others, ignorant (of the
need) to probe their own mind and the necessity of constant reversion to
original nature. They carve and decorate their nature; they hew <span
id="page_75">p. 75</span>

|                              |
|------------------------------|
| **Rites rob life of bloom.** |

their affections or character into symmetry with the conventional
precepts of life. Though, there is a desire for the Tao, men restrain it
by mere rules, they regulate their tastes by etiquette. Though they
rejoice in it, yet they curtail it with their courtesies and obeisances;
they push themselves into the grooves and rules and formalities of
custom: they demean themselves by prostrations. They must stand to rigid
attention on great ceremonies, whilst the meat may be rotting in the
larder and the wine be turning sour in the cup. The person is hampered
by ceremonies without and his originality tied by precepts within. The
concord of the inward life is gagged, the affections and nature of life
are under bondage to these conventional rules of life; the whole of
existence is burdened by such restrictions as these.<span
id="fr_39"></span>[39](tgln1.htm#3_note_39.md)

   But the man who is enlightened in the Tao is not so. He regulates his
natural passions and controls the activities of the emotions. He
nourishes them with the harmony of life and maintains them by suitable
processes. The person

|                                  |
|----------------------------------|
| **Freedom of the man in truth.** |

who delights in the Tao forgets his mean position, and he who finds rest
in virtue does not think of poverty. Whilst his nature has no illicit
desire, there is no desire that is ungratified. Whilst his heart is not
given to sensuous pleasure, there is no true joy which he doesn't
possess. He does not entangle himself with anything unprofitable to his
nature, nor disturb the equilibrium of life by anything inconvenient to
nature. Hence when such a person lets himself go and gives the reins to
his ideas his system can serve to form a pattern for the empire.

   The Confucian literateurs of the present day fail to dig into the
root of the simple and pure nature and deal fundamentally with the
culture of life, but try to restrain desires by rule when they break
out. They do not draw from the true fountain of joy but in the effort at
mending and patching they shut up the little joy that they have. <span
id="page_76">p. 76</span> This way of dealing with the genesis of
appetites and desires is just as though the source of a river were not
led into the proper and natural channel but allowed to burst

|                         |
|-------------------------|
| **Artificial methods.** |

out anywhere indiscriminately and an attempt made to stop the rushing
water by the hand. This would never succeed. Far better to deal with the
water at the source and lead it into the natural channel at the
fountain. The methods of the Confucianist in dealing with the people and
pastoring them are just like the ways used in dealing with wild
animals.<span id="fr_40"></span>[40](tgln1.htm#3_note_40.md) The rules and
etiquettes are like the fetters and shackles to restrain animals. Will
tying the legs with fetters and penning the people in enclosures
succeed? Never! Even the very best disciples of Confucius did not
succeed. Yen Hui, Chi Lou, Tzŭ Hsia, Jan Pei Niu were the expert
disciples of Confucius. Nevertheless Yen had an untimely death. Chi Lou
was mutilated in the war with Wei. Tzŭ Hsia lost the sight of his eyes
through weeping for the loss of his son. Jan Pei Niu became leprous. All
these men, great though they were, were buffeted by nature, and
labouring under the restraints of life's handicaps, failed to reach the
harmony of life. So Tseng, meeting Tzŭ Hsia, noticed that he was at one
time thin, and fat at another time, and asked him the cause. "The fact
is," Tzŭ Hsia replied, "when I went forth into the world and saw the
pleasures pertaining to riches and honours I began to desire these.
Returning again to college and listening to the doctrine of the Ancient
Kings I had pleasure in these again. Being torn in mind between these
two contending ideas I got wasted in body. The Law of the ancient kings
triumphing, I got plump again,"—i.e., by freedom from inward strife. His
mind, we may conclude, was neither satisfied with lusting for wealth and
honours, nor was he averse to thinking of extravagant pleasure: it was
only when he repressed his nature and suppressed these natural desires
in the wish to follow the teaching of the Master that he found himself.
Nevertheless though his heart was pure, <span id="page_77">p. 77</span>
and he suppressed his desires, yet the effort for self-mastery was
artificial, therefore he failed to attain the full span of life through
his inward conflict.

   On the other hand, the Perfect Man eats just as he wants: he clothes
his person as he feels necessary: he exercises his body as required: he
satisfies the desires of nature: for the rest, he has no lust for
empire: he gives up the desire for the gain of worldly goods. Placed as
he is in the vast domain of Heaven, he can roam in this endless expanse:
he ascends the regions of Heaven, he depends on the T‛ai I, the good
God: he has all Heaven and Earth in the hollow of his hand for a
plaything. Who will say that he is poor or thin and wasted?

   The Confucianist, on the contrary, is unable to extract the root of
desire from the mind, he can only restrain it. He is not able to
extirpate the source of pleasure, he only curbs it when it appears. And
to keep society from thieving and brigandage by fear of punishment is
not such a good way as to extirpate the desire for thieving from the
heart.<span id="fr_41"></span>[41](tgln1.htm#3_note_41.md)

   The people of Yüeh (Chih Kiang), when they caught a python looked on
it as the greatest delicacy. But the Chinese had a repugnance for it, it
was valueless to them. Therefore, knowing its valuelessness, the
covetous are able to renounce the lust for it: but if its use should
become known even the unavaricious would desire it. The cause for a king
bringing his kingdom to shame and destruction, injuring and abandoning
the ancestral gods, and suffering death at the hands of his enemies,
being derided by all the multitude, came from lust of gain. Chou Yü<span
id="fr_42"></span>[42](tgln1.htm#3_note_42.md) lusted for the bribe of the
Great Bell and lost his kingdom. The prince of Yu hankered after the
Tsui-Chi jade and became a captive. The sensual pleasures in which Duke
Hsien indulged created a state of anarchy for four generations. Duke
Huan loved the pleasures of the table and did not meet with a timely
burial.<span id="fr_43"></span>[43](tgln1.htm#3_note_43.md) The king of Hu
found pleasure in sensual music and the dance of women <span
id="page_78">p. 78</span> and lost his best land.

   Now these five men, if they had been satisfied with just enough to
meet the cravings of nature and had renounced every wanton excess, and
had taken their own manhood as the standard of life, unmoved by the
inducement of the senses, they would not have met with the disasters
that overtook them.

   An archer cannot hit the mark without an arrow: but he who practises
archery knows nothing of the craft of

|                             |

| **Concentrate on the tao.** |

making the tools. A charioteer cannot drive without reins: yet he who
practises the art of driving knows nothing of the making of reins.<span
id="fr_44"></span>[44](tgln1.htm#3_note_44.md)

   The man who knows that a fan is no use for him in winter, nor a fur
in summer, will understand that the flux of life is but a minute
speck.<span id="fr_45"></span>[45](tgln1.htm#3_note_45.md) Therefore, to
try and arrest the course of boiling by adding more water will not stop
it. He who knows really the root of things will take the fire from
underneath the pot: this will be effective.<span
