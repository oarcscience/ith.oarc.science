### RESPONSE OF MATTER TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE COSMIC SPIRIT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A COMPARISON.

   We may compare the Taoist view of life in one respect with that of
Socrates. Socrates maintained that he was at his best when his daimonion
was working, and his thought clearest when he was most sure of divine
guidance. Prof. Bury says that "Socrates represents his own life-work as
a sort of religious quest: he feels convinced that in devoting himself
to philosophic discussion he had done the bidding of a superhuman guide
and he goes to death rather than be untrue to his personal conviction.
Because of this he became the champion of free discussion and the
supremacy of the individual conscience over human law." And we have the
Taoist view that human enactments and the wisdom of Sages may be
abolished. Tradition binds man and therefore is inferior to
"conscience". If men followed the Tao they would never be opportunists,
but always act according to principle and right. Both had unbounded
faith in spiritual law. Mere human knowledge is of itself wholly
inadequate and uncertain. But the Tao is always full to those who have
the mind for it.

DISSERTATION ON  
THE RESPONSE OF MATTER TO THE  
MOVEMENT OF THE COSMIC SPIRIT

{[notes](tgln1.htm#5.md)}

   *The title is "Tao Ying (\#\#\#)" Tao, the Cosmic spirit. There is
the idea of 'hovering over,' 'moving on the face' of all things, and
all, in acting, give an automatic response to the tao. In examining the
good and evil of every event, we shall see the results of the
corresponding responses.*

   *The mystery of existence.*—Great Purity asked Exhaustless<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](tgln1.htm#5_note_1.md) whether he knew anything of the
Tao. Exhaustless replied he knew nothing. He also asked *Wu-wei*,<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](tgln1.htm#5_note_2.md) who replied he had some
knowledge. "And is the knowledge you have of it finite?" "Yes, it is
finite," *Wu-wei* replied. "Well, then, how much do you know about the
Tao?" "I know that such things as yieldingness, firmness, courtesy and
severity, the negative and positive, the recondite and clear are
possible through the Tao. Thus it is possible for the Tao to enwrap
Heaven and Earth, and to operate with perfect response through the whole
universe. This is the limit of my knowledge."

   Great-Purity also asked Without-Beginning,<span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](tgln1.htm#5_note_3.md) saying: "Formerly I asked
Exhaustless about the Tao, who replied he had no knowledge; and
subsequently I asked *Wu-wei* who replied that he had knowledge. We have
thus the knowledge of *Wu-wei* and the non-knowledge of Exhaustless.
Which of them is right and which is wrong?" Without-Beginning replied,
"The non-knowledge of Exhaustless is the more profound; knowledge is
superficial; non-knowledge knows the intrinsic, but knowledge only the
extrinsic; non-knowledge sees the essence, knowledge the accident."
Great-Purity was surprised, and, sighing, replied; <span
id="page_103">p. 103</span> "Thus, then, is non-knowledge the same as
knowledge? And is not-knowing the same as knowing? There is no
difference, who but knows that knowledge is non-knowledge and
non-knowledge is (really) knowledge. Isn't that so?" Without-Beginning
replied, "The Tao cannot be heard; the Tao that can be heard is not the
Tao. The Tao cannot be seen; that which can be seen is not the Tao. The
Tao cannot be spoken; were it possible to express it, then it would not
be the Tao. Who is it that can understanding the form of the formless?"
Thus Lao Tzû said: (Chap. 2)<span
id="fr_4"></span>[4](tgln1.htm#5_note_4.md)

> <span class="small">THE GOODNESS THAT IS RECOGNIZED AS SUCH BY ALL THE
> WORLD IS NOT THE GOODNESS: AND SO IT MAY BE SAID, HE WHO KNOWS DOES
> NOT SPEAK, AND HE WHO SPEAKS DOES NOT KNOW.</span>

   *A case of conscience. Silence is golden.*—Duke Pei asked Confucius
"May men use dark hints or an obscure and subtle way of speech?"
Confucius made no response. Duke Pei<span
id="fr_5"></span>[5](tgln1.htm#5_note_5.md) said, "What about a stone
thrown into the water?" Confucius replied, "The expert swimmers of Wu
and Yüeh would get to the bottom and feel it." He again enquired: "What
about the effect of throwing water into water? No trace of one, as
distinct from the other, would be found. Confucius replied, "The two
waters Chih and Sheng of Ch‛i, though mixed, would be detected as to the
tastes of each by such as I Shen." Duke Pei then said, "Such being the
case, men certainly cannot use occult language." To which Confucius
replied, "Why say it cannot be done?" Who knows the sense of words that
are spoken? He who knows what words signify does not express (his
thought) in words."<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](tgln1.htm#5_note_6.md)

   "A fisherman must enter the deep water to catch his fish; a hunter
must brave danger and enter the lair to get his prey. This is inevitable
and not a mere matter of pleasure. Hence the most perfect language<span
id="fr_7"></span>[7](tgln1.htm#5_note_7.md) does away with words, and the
perfect action consists in *Wu-wei*. He who has but a superficial
knowledge of a matter in <span id="page_104">p. 104</span> dispute, is
shallow and fails to go to the root."

   Duke Pei failed to adopt this advice (of Confucius) and died at Yu
Shih. Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 73.)

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">

<col style="width: 100%" />

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   This fits the case of Duke Pei exactly.

   *Theoretical laws are useless.*—Hui Tzû created a system of laws for
King Hui for governing the kingdom. When completed, these were shown to
all the scholars, who, without exception, praised them. They were then
presented to King Hui, who was very pleased with them and showed them to
Tsê Chien, who said they were good. King Hui said, "Since they are good
they should be put into operation." But on Chai Tsê Chien objecting to
the suggestion, the King wanted to know his reason. Tsê Chien replied
that when men carried a heavy log of wood, they ha'd and ho'd, those
behind responding to those before. This is the song they have for
stimulus in carrying heavy loads. They do not use the more classic songs
of Cheng and Wei with their high plaintive notes, simply because such
are not so fitting to the work. The rites for governing a country do not
consist of written enactments. Too much law is not good. This is as Lao
Tzu says: (Chap. 57.)

   *The art of education is to teach, "How to see."*<span
id="fr_9"></span>[9](tgln1.htm#5_note_9.md)—T‛ien Pien was expounding
certain principles of the Tao to the King of Ch‛i, and the King, in the
conversation, said, "What I am faced with are the practical policies of
the Kingdom of Ch‛i; these principles of yours are useless as means to
abolish the distresses of the land. I want to hear something definite
and practical on the art of government." T‛ien P‛ien replied that though
his words contained nothing on government, yet they could be made to
apply. And he gave this illustration. "A forest is composed of raw
timber; it has no ready-made material. Wood must be <span
id="page_105">p. 105</span> dressed accordingly to suit the need. Would
the king kindly examine the principles he had stated and adopt them to
the needs of the government of Ch‛i. The King would find them adaptable.
Though they may not abolish the embarrassments of the country, yet this
is the Tao that moves Heaven and changes the world in the evolutionary
flux. The affairs of Ch‛i are small in comparison." This episode
exemplifies Lao Tan's statement: (Chap. 14.)

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="small">THE FORM THAT IS FORMLESS<br />
THE PHENOMENA THAT HAS NO SUBSTANCE</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   The King wanted practical advice on the administration of Ch‛i, and
T‛ien P‛ien gave him general principles. Now the actual manufactured
article is of less importance than the trees of the forest, since the
one depends on the other. The forest is nothing without rain; rain is
nothing without the operations of Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang are nothing
without the essential co-operating harmony; harmony is nothing without
the Tao.

   *A word of advice to the avaricious profiteer. True
self-interest.*—When Sheng, the Duke of Pei, gained the kingdom of
Ching, and on his failing to distribute the contents of the Treasury
between the people, members of his party, after the lapse of seven days,
came in and told him, "If what is gained illicitly is not distributed to
the public, distress is sure to come. It is better to burn the
treasures, if they cannot be distributed amongst the people, so that
disaster may not befall us." Duke Pei would not listen to the advice. In
nine days Duke Shê attacked the place, and having gained entrance,
distributed the goods in the treasury amongst the multitude: he also
issued the munitions of war, in the Treasury, to the people. In
consequence of this he captured Duke Pei after investing his palace for
nineteen days. The Kingdom didn't really belong to Pei and his desire
for it may be said to be a piece of avarice. That he failed to act
generously towards the people, and serve his own true self-interest
thereby, showed that he was most stupid as well as avaricious. The <span
id="page_106">p. 106</span> niggardliness of Duke Pei was in no way
different from the love of the owl for its young.<span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](tgln1.htm#5_note_10.md) This agrees with Lao Tzu's
saying: (Chap. 9.)

> <span class="small">IT IS ENOUGH TO CARRY A FULL VESSEL; DON'T TRY TO
> ADD TO IT AND MAKE IT TO OVERFLOW.  
> TRYING TO SHARPEN A POINT ALREADY SHARP MAY MAKE IT HARD TO KEEP AN
> EDGE AT ALL.</span>

   *Character is the essential thing in a ruler. Hereditary power is
useless.*—Chao Chien Tzû adopted Hsiang Tzŭ as his heir. Tung Ngo Yu
objected on the grounds of Wu Hsü's (Hsiang Tzŭ) obscurity, holding he
was not fit to be a successor. Chien Tzŭ replied, "that his character
was such as to ensure success. He would bear indignity for the sake of
the kingdom."

   Some time after, Chih Pei when drinking with Hsiang Tzŭ slapped his
face. A minister suggested he should be put to death for this, but
Hsiang Tzŭ, the King, argued that the deceased Prince had adopted him
because he could bear personal indignity for the throne. "Do you think,"
he said, "that he put me in this place to slay people?" After the
passing of ten months Chih Pei invested Hsiang Tzŭ at Ching Yang. Hsiang
Tzŭ divided his army and attacked him on either side and routing Chih
Pei slew him and made his skull into a drinking vessel. This confirms
Lao Tzŭ's saying: (Chap. 26.)

> <span class="small">HE WHO IS CONSCIOUS OF HIS PROWESS BUT AT THE SAME
> TIME WHO MAINTAINS GENTLENESS AND PATIENCE, IS HE TO WHOM WILL FLOW
> ALL THE STREAMS OF EMPIRE.</span>

   *The inspired man is the discerning man.*—Yeh Ch‛üeh sought to know
the Tao from Pei I. Pei I replied, "If you correct your deportment, and
guard your eyes from wandering, the blessings of Heaven will come down
on you. If you preserve your knowledge, and rectify your standards the
Spirit will soon settle on your person: and virtue will abide with you.
If you exercise the Tao it will make its abode with you. Unsophisticated
as a new born calf, never asking the why or wherefore of its <span
id="page_107">p. 107</span> origin,"—but before he had finished this
sentence, Yeh Ch‛ueh seemed to have lost interest in what Pei I was
saying, so he got up and departed singing this ditty as he was going,
"His form and limbs look withered and dried up: his mind looks dead like
ashes. Truly I don't know how to deal with such a show of stupidity. I
have no mind to talk to him. What kind of a man is he really?" This just
confirms Lao Tzŭ's saying:

> <span class="small">"CAN HE WHO IS CLEAR ON EVERY MATTER BE WITHOUT
> KNOWLEDGE IN DISCERNMENT?"</span>

   *The use of the mailed fist is not the way to maintain the fruits of
victory.*—Chao Hsiang Tzû attacked Ti and overpowered him and took his
two prefectures of Yu Jen and Chung Jen. The messenger came to announce
the victory and to offer congratulations, and when Hsiang Tzû was about
to sup, it was noticed that he was of a sad countenance, which led them
to say, "People find it a matter of joy to become possessors of two
cities in a morning. So what may be the cause of the present sadness of
the Prince?" Hsiang Tzû replied to them, "The floods of the two rivers
last only three days at most. Storms of winds and rain pass over
quickly. There is no accumulated merit in our Chao family; how is it
that now, in one morning, two cities have fallen to me? Is not this
ominous of disaster?" When Confucius heard of this, he said, "The good
fortune of the family of Chao must increase. Dejection, or moderation of
spirit, is the foundation of greatness, and hilarity is the root of
decay. It isn't victory that is difficult, but the maintenance of the
fruits of victory: this is the difficulty. The worthy kings of the past
who maintained victory in this spirit, handed down their happiness to
their successors. Ch‛i, Ts‛u, Wu, Yueh gained victories in their time,
but eventually fell into decay, simply because they failed to apprehend
how to maintain victory. This can only be done by making the Tao
dominant." Confucius, for example, could manipulate the ponderous gate
of the city, but never displayed <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> his
physical strength before man. It is said that Mei-tzû (who knew no art
of war) maintained the defensive and offensive against Duke Yu P‛an and
brought him to submission, but not by military force. They knew that the
effective way of maintaining victory was by looking upon gentleness,
right not might, as the strong power, just as Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 4.)

   *Not Might but Right.*—Hui Meng had an interview with King Sung
K‛ang. He wore his characteristic way of restless feet, of humming, and
coughing, and speaking with rapidity, during the visit. The King said,
"What I admire is the achievements of valour, humanity and justice. Have
you, Sir, anything to instruct me?" Hui Meng replied, "Your servant has
a Way according to which even the shafts of the valiant will do me no
harm, neither can force, however cleverly used, succeed against me.
Great Prince have you truly a mind to try it?" The King replied, "Very
excellent! It's just what I want to hear about." Hui Meng continued,
"But the shaft that will not penetrate me, the attack that will not
succeed against me, do not seem, after all, the best. Your servant has
still a superior way; such a way that a man with courage will not dare
to use force against me: though possessing the power, he will not
venture to use it against me. This lack of daring to thrust and attack
will not be from want of will. Your servant has a way still higher than
this even. This highest form will make men naturally lose the desire to
stab and kill for the display of daring and courage. Still simple
absence of the intention of using force does not produce a mind of love
and care. So I have something still better than even this way, which
will give unfailing delight to all men and women. This best way is of
more worth than the valour of force: it is superior to these four other
ways. Is the Great King the only one not desirous of it?" King Sung
responded that he desired <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> above all
things to get this. Hui Meng replied. "This way is really no other than
the doctrines of Confucius and Mei. Kung Ch‛iu and Mei Tsê were princes,
though they had no territory: they were leaders, though without official
status. None in the country, be they men or women, but craned their
necks and stood on tip-toe that they might find and win the help of
their doctrines. You are a great King, ruling a large empire: were you
sincerely to have this ambition, every part of your kingdom would
benefit; and so you would greatly excel Confucius and Mei.

   King Sung having nothing to say in reply, Hui Meng departed. The King
said to those about him, "What a talker! My guest overcame me
thoroughly, when speaking." This way agrees with what Lao Tzu says:
(Chap. 23.)

> <span class="small">COURAGEOUS IN NOT USING FORCE IS THE WAY OF
> LIFE.</span>

   Whence we may gather that the greatest courage lies in not exercising
the might that may be at one's command.

   *The King is the conning man.*—In ancient times, Yao had nine
assistants, Shun seven, and Wu Wang had five. Yao, Shun and Wu Wang were
not experts in any one thing, like their assistants. They sat in their
offices receiving the reports of successful operations. They were,
however, masters in their estimate of the abilities of men. Now, a
runner can never beat the great horse, *Chi*, in a race: but when this
horse is hitched to a carriage, it is not able to beat a man. In the
north is a beast, which goes by the name of *Chüeh*, with front quarters
like a rat, and hind quarters like a hare. When it runs, it stumbles (as
it has short forelegs and long hindlegs); it falls when it walks. This
animal always picks out the fragrant grass for the *Chiung Chiung Chü
Hsü* and supplies it with this grass (another animal with long forelegs
and short hindlegs. It can't ascend hills). The *Chiung Chiung*,
therefore, always carries the Chüeh on its back, because of the
infirmity of its legs.

   Here we have a case of one ability throwing its disability on
another. This fits in with Lao Tzu's words: <span id="page_110">p.
110</span> (Chap. 74.)

> <span class="small">"THE INEXPERIENCED WHO WOULD DO THE WORK OF A
> MASTER-CARPENTER, STRANGE IT WOULD BE WERE HE NOT TO INJURE HIS
> HANDS."</span>

   *Everything is easy to him who has the Law.*—Po I counselled Prince
Wei Ssu (the new king) on the art of government on civil and moral
lines. The Prince said, "Mine is a small country, a country of only
1,000 chariots. I would apply your advice to such." Po I replied that Wu
Hu, the lifter of 100 catties would think nothing of lifting one catty.
This means that a small country can all the more easily carry on
government on moral and civil methods.<span
id="fr_11"></span>[{11}](tgln1.htm#5_note_11.md)

   *Tu Hê counselled Chou Chao Wen, the Prince, on how to pacify the
empire.*—After the disruption of Chou, Wen Chun asked advice of Tu Hê on
the best way to settle the country, saying, "I would earnestly learn
from you how to bring peace to Chou." Tu Hê replied. "If you cannot act
on the words of your servant, there is no possibility of pacifying Chou.
If you can put my words into practice, Chou will settle down of itself."
This is the meaning of the saying: 'Don't fight for peace. Peace will
come naturally.' The principle is expressed by Lao Tzû thus: (Chap. 28.)

> <span class="small">"THE GREAT LAW MUST NOT BE CUT UP AND TAKEN IN
> DRIBLETS. TO TELL THE PARTS OF A CARRIAGE DOES NOT MAKE A
> CARRIAGE."</span>

   *Be guided by big and generous ideas. Avoid a parsimonious
spirit.*—It was a law in Luh that, when any of their people were taken
prisoners and made slaves by the Feudal Lords, their ransom should be
paid out of the Treasury, should an opportunity offer itself to liberate
them; Tzû Kung ransomed one such captive but declined the redemption
money offered by the Treasury. Confucius told him: "Tzû, you have not
done quite right. Whenever the sage takes any matter in hand (or acts),
he supplies a principle that affects the conventions of life and the
manners <span id="page_111">p. 111</span> of society, with the result
that the effects of the teaching would be handed down to succeeding
generations. He never acts with a view to his own individual case. The
kingdom, at the present time, has but few wealthy people; the majority
are poor. To receive the cost of a ransom from the Public Treasury
should not be looked on as avaricious: it would be impossible to redeem
many under present conditions, if help from the Treasury were not
accepted. Under such circumstances, no Luh prisoners in the hands of the
Feudal Lords could be ransomed after this." This view of Confucius
showed that he was profoundly versed in the true spirit of reform and
proper principles of action, which is consonant with Lao Tzu's dictum:
(Chap. 52.)

<span class="small">"PERCEPTION OF THE GERM IS ENLIGHTENMENT."</span>

   *Militarism is baneful.*—Wei Wu Hou enquired of Li K‛e<span
id="fr_12"></span>[12](tgln1.htm#5_note_12.md) the cause of the decay of
the Wu nation. His reply was: "Wu often fought and often conquered,"
i.e., Wu was too often victorious in war. Wu Hou answered that frequent
victories in war should lead to the greatness of a country, and he could
not see how this could be the cause of decay. Li K‛ê replied, "Frequent
wars exhaust the people: frequent victories make the masters drunk with
pride. The more the pride, the more is the vitality of the people
consumed in vainglorious wars. Few are the countries that can stand such
a strain and not decay. Pride and arrogance lead to licence and anarchy,
exhausting resources and people. Thus, there come hatred and dislike,
leading to all sorts of schemes and devices (for amelioration of
hardships). The strange thing is that Wu did not succumb much earlier."
When it did fall, Fu Ch‛ai (the minister) committed suicide at Kan Sui.
Lao Tzu's words give the principle: (Chap. 9.)

> <span class="small">"TO WITHDRAW AFTER SUCCESS IS WON AND NAME
> ESTABLISHED IS A GOOD PRINCIPLE OF ACTION, AND IT IS THE LAW OF
> HEAVEN."</span>

   *The Saviour of his Country.*—Ning Yüeh<span
id="fr_13"></span>[13](tgln1.htm#5_note_13.md) desired an <span
id="page_112">p. 112</span> official post from Duke Huan of Ch‛i, but he
had no means of getting an interview with him. In the meantime he
followed the work of a merchant, and was on his way to Ch‛i, driving his
cart loaded with goods. Resting one evening outside the city gate, Duke
Huan came out to receive a guest for whom the gates were opened. The
carts round the gate were ordered to move off. The lamps and lights were
many and the retainers were numerous. Ning Yüeh saw his opportunity and,
tapping the horns of his cow, sang a ditty in high clear notes. Duke
Huan tapped the arm of his attendant, saying, "How strange! That singer
can be no ordinary person. Let him come in the train of the
carriages."<span id="fr_14"></span>[14](tgln1.htm#5_note_14.md) When Duke
Huan had returned home, his attendants waited his instructions regarding
the guest. The Duke prepared court robes for him for an interview. Ning
Yüeh talked about how to govern a country at the interview. Duke Huan
was delighted and was about to offer him a post, when the entourage
remonstrated that the guest was a man of Wei, and that Wei was not far
away. The prince had better send a man to enquire about his past record
and, if good, he could then be engaged." "Not so," replied the Duke, "if
it be found that there are some minor defects against him, we shall lose
the excellent services of a man for some slight error of his in the
past. This is how governors lose the scholars of the country. You can
always judge from what you hear: and, after hearing, there is no need of
enquiries into the past. This man is quite agreeable to me. To get just
the right men is a difficult matter. Men must be estimated at their
best."

   Duke Huan acted quite correctly in this matter. Thus Lao Tzû says:
(Chap. 25.)

> <span class="small">"HEAVEN IS GREAT; EARTH IS GREAT; THE TAO IS
> GREAT; THE KING IS ALSO GREAT. WHEN THOSE FOUR GREATNESSES EXIST
> WITHIN THE BORDERS, THE KING SHARES ONE OF THEM."<span
> id="fr_15"></span>[15](tgln1.htm#5_note_15.md)</span>

   *The man worthy to rule and be king.*—Tan Fu,<span
id="fr_16"></span>[16](tgln1.htm#5_note_16.md) the <span id="page_113">p.
113</span> great ancestor, lived in Pin. Being attacked by the Tartars,
he hid tribute of furs, cotton, silk fabrics, precious stones, which,
being refused, made him say, "What the Tartars want is land: wealth and
goods will not satisfy them." T‛ai Wang Tan Fu<span
id="fr_17"></span>[17](tgln1.htm#5_note_17.md) reasoned in this way: "To
live with the people (elder brothers) and kill their brothers, to mingle
with the fathers and slay their sons are acts I will not be a party to;
so rest you here in peace. To serve the Tartars will not be different
from serving me. Moreover I have heard it said, "Don't hurt the people
for the sake of territory." So, taking his staff, he departed. The
people clung to him, and they went forth and founded a kingdom near the
Ch‛i mountain. The great ancestor Tan Fu may be accredited with knowing
how to preserve his kind.

   Though rich and honourable, he did not injure his person by his mode
of life: though poor and lowly, he did not permit the love of gain to
entangle his person. As it is now, there are those who would look upon
it as a great calamity to lose the titles and emoluments of their
ancestors; but they regard it as a light matter to mar the bodies handed
down through long ages. Is this not a silly view of life? Listen to what
Lao Tzu says: (Chap. 13.)

> <span class="small">"THE EMPIRE CAN BE ENTRUSTED TO HIM WHO HONOURS
> HIS BODY FOR THE SAKE OF HIS COUNTRY. THE EMPIRE CAN BE COMMITTED TO
> HIM WHO LOVES HIS BODY FOR THE SAKE OF HIS COUNTRY."</span>

   *Moral strength is gained by conquest of the desires. Loss of two
worlds. True vision.*—Kung Tzû Mu of Chung Shan, talking to Chan Tzû,
said, "What is your opinion of the man whose thought and will are always
occupied in guarding his inner life or personal nature?" Shan Tzû
replied. "He has the best view of life. Thinking thus of life, he
condemns the sway of passion."

   Kung Tzû Mu said, "Though knowledge of the law may exist, what if
there is failure to subdue the desires?" To which Chan Tzû replied,
"Failure in self-conquest means submission to desire. Would you not
grieve at <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> acquiescence to the
passions? On the other hand, inability to win self-conquest and a forced
submission to the passions implies a double loss. Persons who experience
this double suffering belong to a short-lived race." Lao Tzû speaks
thus: (Chap. 55, 32.)

> <span class="small">"THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HARMONY IS CALLED THE
> CONSTANT LAW OR RULE OF LIFE. THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONSTANT LAW GIVES
> TRUE INTELLIGENCE: THE WELL-BEING OF LIFE IS CALLED HAPPINESS. THE
> MIND, USING THE FORCES OF THE FLESH, IS CALLED ANIMAL STRENGTH. SO, BY
> USING THE LIGHT AND REVERTING TO THIS ENLIGHTENMENT, NO CALAMITY WILL
> THEN BE BEQUEATHED TO THE BODY."<span
> id="fr_18"></span>[18](tgln1.htm#5_note_18.md)</span>

   *A mere knowledge of the art of government is insufficient for
ruling.*—Chuang Wang of Ts‛u consulted Chan Ho on how to govern a
country. He replied, "I am versed in the government of the person, but
not in the government of a country." Tz‛u Wang further said: "I have
come into possession of the Penates and Lares<span
id="fr_19"></span>[19](tgln1.htm#5_note_19.md) and would like to learn how
to preserve them." Chan Ho replied, "Your servant has never heard of any
country being in disorder when the person of the ruler is well-governed:
nor, on the other hand, have I ever heard that order can be had in a
nation where the personal life of the ruler is disordered. So I place
the whole responsibility (of government) on the person,—personal
renovation. I would not venture to attribute it to the art of government
itself." This is confirmed by what Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 54.)

   *There is no bloom in any stereotyped law of life.*—Duke Huan was
reading in his study, when a wheelwright, who was trimming wheels
outside, leaving his adze and awl, came near and asked the Duke what he
was reading. The Duke replied "The books of the Sages." The wheelwright
asked where these men were now, to which the Duke responded that they
were all dead. The wheelwright <span id="page_115">p. 115</span> said:
"These books are but the dregs and lees of the Sages." The Duke Huan was
angered and said, as the colour mounted his cheeks: "Do you, a workman,
venture to criticise my reading! If you can justify yourself, well:
otherwise you will be put to death." The wheelwright replied, "Of course
I can justify myself. Permit your servant to explain himself from his
own work of wheelwright. If the wedges are driven in too fast, they will
not enter (but break): if driven in too slowly, they will not be firm:
neither too slow nor too fast is an art whereby the hand and will wholly
act in concert, and in this way perfect workmanship is got. Your servant
cannot transmit this expertness to his son, nor can the son get it from
him, and so he is still working at wheels, though close on 70 years of
age. It is so with the words of the sages; the real bloom of them died
with their authors, and there is nothing but the empty lees and husks
remaining."<span id="fr_20"></span>[20](tgln1.htm#5_note_20.md) Lao Tzŭ's
words supply the principle: (Chap. 1.)

   *A wily old diplomat.*—In ancient time Han Tzŭ, the city-engineer,
being Prime Minister of Sung, spoke to the King, making the following
suggestion: "The peace and unrest of a nation, the government and the
anarchy of the people depend on the king's rewards and punishments.
Rewarding with titles and the giving of largesse is what the people
like. Let the King himself exercise this power. But the death penalty
and punishment arouse the disgust of the people. Let your servant,
therefore, discharge this function." The King of Sung replied, that it
was a good suggestion, since he would get the praise and his minister
bear the brunt of opprobrium, and he was sure that the Feudal Lords
would not scorn him for this. Nevertheless, continued the King, when the
people realized that the autocratic powers of death were in the hands of
the minister, the officers would pay him respect and the <span
id="page_116">p. 116</span> people would fear him. In less than a year,
Tzŭ Han overshadowed the king and usurped the power of government. Lao
Tzŭ says: (Chap. 36.)

   *Tradition is no law of life.*—Wang Shou carried his books and went
to see Hsü Feng at Chou. Hsü Feng observed that things should respond to
change and circumstance. Customs and practices change, and what does for
the present may be useless for a later time. Books come from words,
words come from knowledge, and knowledge changes. A library becomes dead
stock and so useless. The knowing man knows this. On hearing this, Wang
Shou burnt his books very joyfully. Thus Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 5.)

> <span class="small">"THOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE FOR WORDS TO EXPRESS THE

> DETAIL."</span>

   *Conserve and concentrate the mind.*—Tzû Pei, Mayor of the Palace,
invited Chwang Wang to a feast, which he accepted. Tzû Pei was wanting
in courtesy; and so the king did not keep the appointment. One day the
Mayor was standing in the courtyard and looking north (towards the
King), Tzû Pei said, "Ancient kings kept their appointments; do you not
really mean to go? I fear your servant has committed some fault." "I
have been told," replied the King, "that you prepared a feast for me in
the Ch‛iang T‛ai. This fairy edifice looks south on the Liao mountain,
at the foot of which are the waters of Fang Huang. On the left is the
Yangtse, on the right is the Hui river. The joy of such a scene would
make one forget death itself. Such joy is not for such an imperfect man
as myself. I would be afraid that I should never return, were I to go."
As Lao Tzû says:

> <span class="small">"NOT TO LOOK ON WHAT STIRS THE DESIRES IS THE WAY
> TO KEEP THE MIND FROM WANDERING."</span>

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

   *A discerning wife.*—Chung Erh, the son of the Duke of Tsin, in the
course of his wandering life happened to pass through Ts‛ao, the prince
of which country showed him no courtesy. However, the wife of Hsi Fu
Chi, a minister, said to her husband: "The prince is not very attentive
to the son of the Duke of Tsin. I notice that all who accompany him are
able men. When they return into power they are certain to come and
attack Ts‛ao. Why don't you pay some attention to them?" Hsi Fu Chi, in
consequence, presented them with a costly feast and sent a present of
jade. Chung Erh took the food but declined the jade. After returning to
his country, he organised an expedition against Ts‛ao and gained its
submission. He commanded the three regiments not to enter the village of
Hsi Fu Chi. We find this principle enunciated by Lao Tzu in the words:
(Chap. 39.)

   *Stoop to conquer.*—K‛ou Chien, the King of Yüeh, failed to win in
the war with Wu. He lost his country and fled. He was in distress at
K‛uei Chi. His anger blazed; his courage rose like the gushing waters of
a fountain. He had a mind to marshall his best troops and attack the
enemy. But he thought discretion the better part of valour. Instead, he
submitted to his enemy, and his wife became a serving maid. He
personally carried the musket before the King, like a common soldier.
Notwithstanding, he eventually took his master Wu a prisoner at Kan Sui.
Thus we find Lao Tzû saying: (Chap. 40.)

> <span class="small">"THE YIELDING SPIRIT WILL OVERCOME THE FIRM
> SPIRIT: THE GENTLE SPIRIT WILL TRIUMPH OVER THE AGGRESSIVE. THERE IS
> NO ONE IN THE WORLD BUT KNOWS IT; YET NO ONE IS ABLE TO PUT IT INTO
> PRACTICE."</span>

   The King of Yüeh put it into practice himself and rose to be the
autocrat of China.

   *Noblesse oblige.*—Chao Chien Tzû died, and before <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> his burial, the magistrate of Chung Mu
transferred his allegiance to Ch‛i. Five days after the burial, Hsiang
Tzû took his troops to the attack of Chung Mu: however, before his
soldiers were even posted round the place, 100 feet of the wall fell
down, whereupon Hsiang Tzû sounded the retreat and withdrew. The
commanders remonstrated with the Prince, maintaining that Heaven itself
showed its approval of their cause in punishing the crime of Chung Mu,
in that it had caused the wall to crumble of itself before them, a sure
indication that they should not retire. The prince replied in these
words: "I have heard that Hsü Hsiang used to say: 'The Superior Man
doesn't take advantage of an enemy's difficulty nor press him when he is
in danger.' Let them mend their breech and we will renew the attack."
The people of Mu, on hearing of this fine spirit, begged that they be
received back and capitulated. This episode illustrates this saying of
Lao Tzû: (Chap. 42.)

> <span class="small">"YOU HAVE ONLY NOT TO STRIVE AND NO ONE IN THE
> EMPIRE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTEND WITH YOU."</span>

   *Intuitive sagacity.*—Duke Mu of Ts‛in spoke to the horse-expert, Pei
Lu, asking him whether his son Tzû Hsing, seeing he was old himself,
could buy him a good horse. His reply was that a good horse may be
judged from its form, stand, muscles and bones: but a super-excellent
horse was not to be judged by these outward points. In looking for such
a horse, form should be lost sight of; the stand of the horse may be
indecisive or need not be particularly good, the texture may be
indifferent. A unique horse of this kind would not raise dust in
galloping nor leave a trace of its steps behind it. My son's qualities
are secondary. He may recognise a good horse, but not the unique one. I
have an assistant, however, who helps me in feeding and grooming the
horses, who is in no whit inferior to myself: his name is Chiu Fang Yin.
Please interview him." The Duke commissioned this person to buy a horse.
He returned in three <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> months with the
information that he had got a horse in Shan Ch‛iu. Duke Mu asked him
what kind of a horse it was, and he replied that it was a stallion of
yellow colour. Men were sent for it, and, when it came, it was found to
be a black mare. The Duke called Pei Yoh and said what a mess the man
whom he had recommended had made of things. He neither knew the colour
of the hair, nor the quality of the animal: neither was he aware of
whether it was a stallion or a mare. "What kind of a horse-fancier could
such an individual be?" Pei Yoh breathed deeply and heaved a sigh
saying: "Is it as bad as that! This man is a thousand times superior to
me as a connoisseur of horses. What Yin sees in a horse is its natural
endowments and not merely the outward accidents. In seeking its
vitality, he doesn't think of the flesh and bone: he looks for the
intrinsic merits, without regarding the extrinsic form. He searches for
the essentials and has no eyes for the non-essentials. He looks for what
he wants to see and pays no attention to what he doesn't want to see.
Such points as he observes are above the mere form of the horse." When
the horse was led in, it proved to be truly a horse of a thousand *li*.
This illumines the saying of Lao Tzû: (Chap. 45.)

> <span class="small">"THE LONG STRAIGHTNESS LOOKS AS THOUGH CROOKED:
> THE BIG CLEVERNESS AS THOUGH DULL."</span>

   *The maxim that necessity knows no law is alien to the true art of
government.*—Wu Ch‛i filled the office of Prime Minister of Ts‛u. Going
to Wei, he told Ch‛u I Jo that the King had overlooked his demerits and
made him Prime Minister; so he asked Ch‛u to please give an opinion on
his personal qualities as a man. Ch‛u Tzû asked, in turn, what his real
aims were; to which Wu Ch‛i replied that his policy was to lower the
power of the nobles, to equalize the scale of salaries, by lowering some
and increasing the salaries of those who had too little, to make the
armaments of the nation perfect and, by constant struggle, gain a
dominant place for his country in the <span id="page_120">p. 120</span>
empire. Ch‛u Tzû responding said: "The ancients governed best by not
making any changes in past methods and not altering the usual practices.
But since you propose doing so, let me tell you it will not be good. I
have also heard that enmity is an inversion of nature: the military is
an obnoxious instrument, on which people depend in settling their
quarrels. Strife is what men desire to eliminate. You now secretly plan
this method of brute force, and delight in the use of this hurtful
instrument. If you were to carry on those struggles, you would be acting
most banefully. Further, when you employed the Luh troops against Ch‛i,
you gained your purpose in spite of a bad cause: in like manner, you
conquered Ts‛in in the face of all right. I have heard it said, If you
keep from bringing disaster and miseries on men, you will keep yourself
from your own ruin. By ruining others, you complete your own ruin. I
firmly believe that our country's King has transgressed the laws of
Heaven and wrecked human principles often; but no disaster has,
hitherto, overtaken him, and it must be that you are the man to bring
this on. Ah: wait and see!" Wu Ch‛i became alarmed and asked if there
were a possibility of avoiding such a catastrophe. Ch‛u Tzû replied that
as the catastrophe impending over all had already taken form,<span
id="fr_22"></span>[22](tgln1.htm#5_note_22.md) it would be impossible to
avert it. All that could be done was to alleviate any deleterious
effects by generous love and sincere actions. As Lao Tzû says: (Chap.
45.)

> <span class="small">"BLUNT THE EDGE OF YOUR DESIRES; SCATTER YOUR
> TENDENCY TO STRIFE; GET THE TRUE LIGHT OF THE TAO; MAKE YOURSELF ONE
> WITH THE COMMON MAN.<span
> id="fr_21"></span>[21](tgln1.htm#5_note_21.md)</span>

   *Great is humility.*—When Tsin was going to attack Ts‛u, and when the
army was not more than 105 *li* away and still coming on, the ministers
of Ts‛u asked authority to meet the enemy and strike him. King Chuang
responded that Tsin did not attack Ts‛u, in the days of former Princes,
so it must be that he was personally guilty of something to bring on
such shame. All the ministers replied that <span id="page_121">p.
121</span> Tsin did not attack Ts‛u during the regime of past ministers,
so it must be owing to their fault that Tsin came to attack the country
now. They begged for an order to meet the attack. The King weeping
bitterly, the tears falling down his garments, rose up and made
obeisance to all the ministers.

   When the people of Ts‛in heard of this, they said, "King and
ministers are vying the one with the other, each asking to bear the
responsibility of our aggression, the King even doing homage to his
ministers." So they said, "This expedition must not be made." The army
returned. Just as Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 46.)

   *The character of a man worthy to be King.*—In the time of Duke Ching
of Sung, the planet Mars was in the heart constellation, which so
alarmed the Duke that he called the astronomer Tzŭ Wei for consultation
on the portent, who reported that the appearance of Mars signified a
judgment of Heaven, since the *heart* constellation was the celestial
arc that governed the territory of Sung.<span
id="fr_23"></span>[23](tgln1.htm#5_note_23.md) Further the Prince would
have to bear the impending calamity: nevertheless it would be possible
to shift this on to the shoulders of the Prime Minister. But the Duke
objected to this since he carried the work of government and it would be
unfortuitous for him to die. "In that case," Tzŭ Wei said: "It could be
shifted on to the people." Again the Duke objected on the plea that if
the people were to die, he would have no one over whom to rule, and it
would be preferable for him alone to die. "Let it then be transferred on
to the Seasons," said Tzŭ Wei. Once more the Duke expressed his
unwillingness to this proposal, since the livelihood of the people
depended on the Seasons; for, should the people experience a famine,
they would die. "And were I," he continued, "to risk the life of the
people to save my own, who would desire to have me as their King! My
days are finished; so <span id="page_122">p. 122</span> there's an end
of it. Don't say anything more." Tzû Wei turned to the north, making his
obeisance, said: "May I venture to congratulate your Majesty? Though
Heaven is placed high, it yet hears those below. The Prince has given
expression to the thought of a good man in his three objections. So
Heaven will surely reward the Prince threefold. To-night this planet
will move 21 *li* and the Duke will have 21 years' lease of life." In
response to the question of what assurance there was of this, Tzŭ Wei
replied: "The Prince spoke three times the words of a wise man and the
star must remove the distance I indicated. May I ask you to come outside
and see? If it doesn't deviate the distance mentioned, you may take my
life." The Duke assented. That evening the star did move away 21 *li*.
Lao Tzŭ says: (Chap. 49.)

> <span class="small">"HE WHO CAN TAKE ON HIMSELF THE ILL OMENS OF A
> NATION SHALL BE THE KING."</span>

   *Room for all.*—In olden times during the days of Chao, Kung Sung
Lung said to his disciples, "I have no use for men without talent." A
guest came along, wearing rough serge and a girdle of common hemp. He
said, at an interview: "Your servant has the talent of being able to
shout." Kung Sung looked him up and down and said to his disciples "Have
we any criers?" They replied that they had none. So the King ordered
this stranger to be entered on the register. A few days later, the
disciples went to call on Yen Wang for consultation: on coming to a
river, the ferry boat was found to be far away at the opposite bank. So
the newly-enlisted crier was ordered to vociferate his loudest. The boat
came, after he shouted once. It is written that the Sage does not
readily overlook the service of any man with ability. Just as Lao Tzû
expresses it: (Chap. 50.)

> <span class="small">"THERE IS NO MAN QUITE USELESS; THERE IS NO
> ARTICLE THAT IS WORTHLESS; THE UNITY OF THESE DIVERSE THINGS MAKE UP
> THE SUM TOTAL OF LIFE."</span>

   *Who should get the decoration?*—Tzû Fa attacked <span
id="page_123">p. 123</span> and overcome Ts‛ai. The King Hsuan went out
to meet him on his return, and gave him 100 acres of the best land for
the purposes of sacrifices. But Tzû Fa refused this grant on the grounds
that all government administration and tributes and the visits of the
Feudal Lords were the result of the King's merits. The issue of
commands, the distribution of orders and the dispersion of the enemy,
even before the army was engaged in battle, were the result of the awe
inspired by the chief commander. The victory of the army in battle was
the result of the people's effort. To take advantage of these successes,
in order to increase personal emoluments and honours, would be neither
humane nor just. Hence I refuse." This episode shows what Lao Tzû says:
(Chap. 51.)

> <span class="small">"HE HAS ACHIEVED SUCCESS BUT DOES NOT THINK OF IT:
> THE VERY FACT OF NOT DWELLING ON IT ENSURES THAT THE RENOWN SHALL
> ABIDE WITH HIM."</span>

   *A contract is more than a scrap of paper.*—Duke Wen of Tsin, in
going to attack the Yuan State, assured his ministers that the enemy
would submit in three days, and he converted them to his enterprise by
this hope. But when the three days had passed without the capitulation,
Duke Wen withdrew his troops. An officer said the place would capitulate
in a day or two, therefore let them hold on. The Prince replied that he
was fully convinced that Yuan could be taken in three days, when he made
the promise: but as he failed to capture it within the prescribed time
he had given to his ministers, he had, therefore, broken faith with them
by such a promise of taking Yuan: so he would not take it. When the
people of Yuan heard this they said: "Having such a Prince, can we
refrain from surrendering?" Which they did forthwith. The people of Wen,
hearing these things, also begged to be received. Thus Lao Tzû says:
(Chap. 52.)

> <span class="small">"HOW DEEP AND ABSTRUSE! WITHIN THE TAO THERE IS
> THE ESSENCE; THE ESSENCE IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE; IN ITS VERY CENTRE REPOSE
> SINCERITY AND GOOD FAITH."</span>

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

   *First things first.*—When Duke Kung I became Premier of Luh, the
whole country brought him presents of fish, knowing that he was fond of
it; but he refused to accept it. His pupils remonstrated with him and
wanted to know why he refused every gift of fish, seeing he was so fond
of it? He gave as his reason that he declined the presents for the very
reason that he was fond of it. Were he to accept such, he said, it would
involve his vacating the post of minister; though he liked fish, yet he
could not afford to buy it himself (out of office). But his refusal to
accept any presents of fish did away with the necessity of retiring from
office, and thus he could afford to supply himself with fish always.
Thus he was clear on altruism and egoism. Just as Lao Tzû says: (Chap.
53.)

   An elderly man of Hu Ch‛iu said to Sun Hsü Ao, "People have three
kinds of hatreds. Do you know them?" Well they are: "The scholars envy a
high noble; the king dislikes a great officer; and all dislike those
with big salaries." Sun Hsü Ao replied, "The greater my nobility, the
less is my aim: the higher my post, the lowlier my heart: the higher my
salary the more I distribute. May I escape these three hatreds, do you
think? As Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 39.)

   The man who acted as smith for Ta Ssû-ma was still beating buckles at
70 years of age without ever making a mistake in shaping even the finest
edge. The minister said to him: "Is it skill or is there some secret
about it that you can work thus?" The smith replied: "It is <span
id="page_125">p. 125</span> practice and attention. When your servant
was twenty years old, I liked to beat buckles, and paid no attention to
anything else. I never examined an article that wasn't a buckle."
Therefore in the use of this skin, it came to be second nature to him,
and by this concentrated practice he became perfect. How much more may
it be said of that which is in constant use!

   This unconscious habit is even more than *Wu-wei*, Lao Tzu says:
(Chap. 54.)

> <span class="small">"TO ACT ACCORDING TO THE TAO IS THE WAY THAT MAKES

   *Bear present indignity and wait for empire.*—Wen Wang sharpened his
virtues and cultivated his government, so that, in three years,
two-thirds of the country owned him allegiance. Chou, the emperor, was
troubled when he heard it, and said: "I really can't rise early and
retire late and mend my ways and cultivate virtue, belabouring my mind
and wearing my body with heavy toils! But if I don't do it and let him
go and think no more about him, I fear he would attack me." Ts‛un Hou Hu
said to him; "Chou Pei Ch‛ang<span
id="fr_24"></span>[24](tgln1.htm#5_note_24.md) i.e. Wen Wang, is a person
of benevolence and justice and of good judgement. His eldest son, Fa, is
a man of courage and determination. His second son, Tan, is a person of
pious and frugal habits and possesses the gift of reading the drift of
the times. But should you try to follow his example, you cannot escape
the danger of such a course; if you take no notice of him and let him go
free, you are bound to come to a bad end. Even an ugly cap must be worn
on the head. So I counsel you to check him before his schemes are
matured." Thereupon Ch‛u Shang held Wen Wang captive in Yu Li. Whereupon
San I Sheng, having a thousand ingots of silver, sought for the most
curious and precious stones in the empire. He obtained a tandem of the
tiger-marked horses, 300 pieces of black jade, 500 cowries, the dusky
leopard, the yellow *p‛i*, (bear) the blue kan (wild dog), and 2,000
pieces of the white tiger with <span id="page_126">p. 126</span> the
striped skin. Having collected these, he presented them to Chou by means
of an intermediary, the minister Fei Chung. When Chou saw the gifts, he
was delighted with them and liberated Wen Wang, killing an ox and
offering it to him as a parting gift. On his return home, Wen Wang
simulated an infatuation for building doors inlaid with jade and lofty
towers, played with girls and spent his time dilly-dallying with drums
and music; but really he was waiting his chance to fall on Chou. When
Chou heard of these infatuations, it made him say: "Chou Pei Ch‛ang has
changed his way and altered his course of life. There will be no more
disquiet for me." Chou, however, did not mend his ways, but cast the
iron man,<span id="fr_25"></span>[25](tgln1.htm#5_note_25.md) he took out
the heart of Pei Kan, and ripped out the embryo of a pregnant woman and
slew the minister who remonstrated with him. Wen Wang at length arose at
these enormities and put his plans into execution. Lao Tzû says: (Chap.
28.)

   *Kings should stand in awe of the people.*—Ch‛eng Wang sought advice
from Yen I on political matters, desiring to know how he should act so
that the authorities could gain the affection of the people. Yen I
replied in these words: "Employ them at suitable seasons:<span
id="fr_26"></span>[26](tgln1.htm#5_note_26.md) be mindful of their
interests: respect their feelings." In response the king wanted to know,
further, how these things were to be done. Yen replied, "Act with
circumspection as though you were approaching a deep pool or treading on
thin ice." In turn, the king said, "Fearful for kings then." Yen said,
"Within the whole empire, if the king acts well, the people recognise
him as their pastor: if he acts ill, they look on him as an enemy. The
servants of Hsia and Shang became the enemies of the kings, Chieh and
Chou, and transferred their allegiance to Tang and Wu. The people of Hsü
Hsia attacked their ruler and <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> allied
themselves to Shen Nung.<span
id="fr_27"></span>[27](tgln1.htm#5_note_27.md) All the world knows these
things. Kings should stand in awe." The principle is given by Lao Tzû in
these words: (Chap. 12.)

   *The principles of the Sages should be abolished, as they are the
maxims of robbers.*—The followers of Chê, when asking their chief if
thieves had any principles, received the reply that it was not possible
for them to be without such. The person who could guess where the
treasure was stored, was a superior man: the first to enter was the man
of courage: the last to leave, was the hero. In the average division of
spoils there was an element of justice. The member of the gang who knew
when to act was the man of knowledge. Where one of these five factors
was lacking no great act of plunder could be successful. Nothing in the
world could be done without these principles. From this it may be
inferred that the mind of the brigand must needs borrow the teaching of
the sages for carrying on his trade. Lao Tzŭ says: (Chap. 19.)

> <span class="small">"ABOLISH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SAGES, ABANDON

   *Use for the rough diamonds of Society.*—General Tzŭ Fa of Ts‛u liked
to look out for men of skill. He encouraged everyone who showed any
talent. Now there was a clever thief in Ts‛u who heard of this, so he
went to see the general, saying that he had heard he was on the look out
for men of skill; that his was in thieving, and as he would like to try
his skill, he offered himself as a soldier. Hearing this, the general
was in such haste to see him that he could hardly wait to put on his hat
and robes to receive him civilly. His attendants tried to dissuade him
from showing any civility to a thief. The general replied that this was
no business of theirs.

   Not long after, Ch‛i marshalled its troops to attack <span
id="page_128">p. 128</span> Ts‛u. Tzŭ Fa, the commander of the Ts‛u
army, was pressed and had to withdraw his forces three times. The best
leaders of Ts‛u had exhausted their plans and used every device, but the
army of Ch‛i still advanced and was stronger than ever. Just then the
quondam thief begged permission of the general to use his little talent.
Tzŭ Fa consented, and without asking any particulars, sent him off. So
the thief entered the camp of the Ch‛i commander and stole the curtain
of his bed, as he was sleeping, and brought it to his general. The
general thereupon sent it back by a messenger with the words that one of
his soldiers found the commander's curtains, when gathering fire sticks:
so he was returning it to the man in charge, by a messenger. The next
day, the thief soldier stole the pillow of the commander, as he was
sleeping. This again Tzŭ Fa returned in the same way. The next day he
went and abstracted the commander's hair-fastening. Tzŭ Fa once more
returned the article. When the soldiers became aware of this, they were
greatly alarmed, and the commander held a consultation with his officers
maintaining that if they didn't immediately return home, it was not
impossible that the King of Ts‛u would get the commander's head next! He
then withdrew the troops and departed. This is, as the common saying has
it, *no gift is too little, no ability too slight for the king to use*.
Just as Lao Tzŭ says: (Chap. 27.)

   *The true culture of the Tao and life.*—Yen Hui told Chung Ni
(Confucius) "I have made progress." "How so?" asked Chung Ni. He replied
"Hui<span id="fr_28"></span>[28](tgln1.htm#5_note_28.md) can forego
Etiquette and Music." Confucius said: "Good, but your progress is not
yet complete." Another day, Yen Hui saw Confucius and said: "Hui has
made progress." "In what way? asked Confucius. "I have dispensed with
*Jen* and *I*, Benevolence and Justice" answered Hui. Confucius said
"Very good, there is yet room to advance." Yet <span id="page_129">p.
129</span> another day, on seeing him again, Hui said, "I can sit
without being conscious of my body. I have reached the abstraction of
the Tao." Confucius suddenly asked, "What do you mean by sitting in a
state of abstraction?" Yen Hui replied: "Lose all sense of the physical
body: I can be detached from sentiency, and be oblivious of this outward
form and abandon knowledge: thus situated I penetrate within the
spiritual flux: passivity is what I mean by sitting in a state of
insensibility." Chung Ni replied, "Penetration into these implies a
state without *shan*, goodness, virtue: the state of spiritual
passivitity or flux implies a state without the constant principles and
maxims of the Sages. You have entered sainthood before me. I must beg to
follow after you." Lao Tzŭ says: (Chap. 10.)

> <span class="small">CLOTHED WITH ANIMAL SPIRIT AND SOUL EMBRACING THE

> BREATH IN A STATE OF YIELDINGNESS, SIMILAR TO AN INFANT CHILD, THIS IS

   *A false move.*—Duke Mu of Ts‛u mobilised his troops for a surprise
attack on Cheng. Ch‛ien Hsü disagreed with the proposal, on the grounds
that for a surprise attack to be successful, the chariots must not be
over 100 *li* away, and the infantry not over 30 *li* from the
objective; that the plans must be secret and not divulged; the soldiers'
keenness must not have lost its edge (as it would, after long marches);
the commissariat must not be depleted: the people must not be exhausted;
but all, by uniting their keen spirit and abounding strength in the
objective, attack the enemy, and overawe him. "But in the case before
us," he said, "the distance is several thousand *li*: the territories of
several Feudal Princes must be crossed to make this surprise attack.
Your servant wonders whether the King would not reconsider the plan."
But Duke Mu refusing the advice, Ch‛ien Hsu in sending forth the troops
wore mourning hemp garments, and wept.

   The army on its march had to pass through Chou <span id="page_130">p.
130</span> and was met on the east of it by a trader from Cheng Hsuan,
Kao by name, who had come, inspired by the command of the Baron of
Cheng, to welcome the weary troops of Ts‛in by an offering of 12 oxen.
The three commanders were alarmed, and deliberated, saying they had
marched several thousand *li* to a surprise attack on a people, but
before they had reached their objective, people were aware of their
purpose and so were prepared: the surprise therefore would be
impossible. The troops were withdrawn and departed.

   Just then Duke Wen of Tsin fell sick and died; but before the burial
had taken place, Hsien Chen spoke to the young king, Hsiang Kung,
saying: "My former Prince, in days gone by, was friendly with Duke Mu,
as is well known to everybody, and none of the Feudal Lords but was
aware of it. But here we find that, even ere our dead King is buried, he
(Mu) does not offer his condolences nor ask permission to pass over our
territory. This is because he sees our King is dead and despises our new
King. I beg for authority to attack him." This being granted, Hsien Chen
called up the army and, meeting the forces of Ts‛in at Yao, routed them.
He captured their three commanders and led them captive. On hearing
these tidings, Duke Mu put on sack-cloth and wailed in the temple, as he
related the events to the people. Lao Tzu says: (Chap. 71.)

> <span class="small">"TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND YET APPEAR NOT TO KNOW, IS

   *In the choice of a wife, don't be led away by the senses.*—After the
death of the queen of Ch‛i, the King desired to choose a queen-consort
from the concubines. The matter still pending, he took counsel with the
ministerial body. Duke Hsueh, wishing to fall in with the purpose of the
King, sent a present of ten ear-rings of which one pair was most
beautiful. One morning, later, <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> he
enquired of the servitors which of the maids had the beautiful pair and
advised the king to make her his consort. (He thus wished to curry
favour with the king and the new queen). The king of Ch‛i was most
delighted and heaped honours on Duke Hsueh. Thus when the master's
desires are revealed to the servant, a handle is given the servant to
control the master. Just as Lao Tzu says: (Chap. 52.)

> <span class="small">"PLUG UP THE AVENUE OF THE SENSES; CLOSE UP THE
> DOOR OF THE DESIRES. THIS WILL STOP THE CARES OF LIFE."</span>

   *Another case of Newton and the sands.*—Lu Ao,<span
id="fr_30"></span>[30](tgln1.htm#5_note_30.md) a man haughty and proud,
went touring towards the North Sea to find an arhat. Having crossed
through to the limit of the North, he entered the Hsuan Ch‛üeh mountain
and arrived at the top of the Meng Ku range. Here he met with a
scholar-like person whose eyes were deep set, his temples were covered
with jet black hair, tears stood in his eyes: he had the shoulders of a
kite; his head was generous above and receding below. He seemed full of
merriment, as he danced in the breezes. He looked at Lu Ao and appeared
ill-pleased to see him there: the arms, that were swaying in his
gyrations, he let fall and slipped behind a stone column. Lu Ao came
forward and looked at him, just as he was seated on a tortoise shell and
swallowing oysters. Lu Ao addressed him thus: "I thought I was the only
individual who had turned his back on kith and kin to get a thorough
observation of the uttermost parts of the world. As a young man I was
fond of travel, nor have I changed my habits in old age; so having
traversed the four quarters of the earth, I still had the extreme north
unvisited. To-day I find you, Sir, here! May it not be possible that we
may be friends?" The scholar-like man smilingly replied: "Hsi! you are
from China and have chosen to come to this distant spot. But you musn't
think this is very far. Here there are still the sun and moon, the
stars, too, are hung out here. Here the Yin and Yang still operate, and
the four seasons <span id="page_132">p. 132</span> come and go. These
parts compared with the unnameable places are still circumscribed. But
where I roam to the south there is the boundless waste; to the north I
stop in the profound gloom; to the west there is an illimitable vista;
on the east I go beyond the orient. In these distant regions there is no
firmament above nor earth below: there is no sound to be heard nor vista
on which to gaze; still further on, there is only the sound as of
rolling waters. Thither it is I have not been able to reach. Now Sir,
having reached this place to which you have voyaged for the first time,
you musn't think you have reached the end of the world: as a matter of
fact you are far from that. Rest here, Sir: I must go to Han Man.<span
id="fr_31"></span>[31](tgln1.htm#5_note_31.md) beyond the range of the nine
Heavens. I musn't abide here long." This strange man then lifted his
arms and pulling together his body, forthwith disappeared in the clouds.
Lu Ao, looking after him, saw him not. He stopped his chariot. Feeling
annoyed with himself and with the turn things had taken, he said:
"Compared with that person I am no more than a yellow heron or a
worthless worm of the earth; I can only crawl a few feet in a whole day,
whereas he has already sped a long way. Isn't it grievous!" Thus Chuang
Tzu says:

> <span class="small">"THE CREATURES OF A SHORT YEAR ARE INFERIOR TO
> THOSE OF A LONG YEAR. A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS INFERIOR TO GREAT
> KNOWLEDGE. THE MOTH THAT SEES THE MORNING LIGHT, DIES BEFORE A MON'TH
> COMES ROUND. THE CICADA KNOWS NEITHER AN AUTUMN NOR SPRING."</span>

   These words show clearly that there are many things we can never
know.<span id="fr_32"></span>[32](tgln1.htm#5_note_32.md)

   *Let the King cultivate a conscience in the people.*—Ch‛i Tzŭ ruled
Shan Fu for three years. Wu Ma-ch‛i, making himself incognito, went
about to see the effect of his administration. Seeing a fisherman throw
back into the stream a fish he had taken, he asked the reason why he did
so, telling him that fishermen as a rule kept the fish they had taken.
What was the reason for his not <span id="page_133">p. 133</span> doing
so? The fisherman replied that Ch‛i Tzŭ didn't wish people to capture
small fishes. That was the reason. Wu returned to Confucius and told him
this, remarking that Ch‛i Tzŭ's virtue was perfect, in that he had
induced men to act in their privacy as though a monitor stood by their
side with the warning and admonitions of severe punishment. How could he
have attained to this degree of excellence? Confucius replied: "I have
seen the statement that in government sincerity in one thing will also
appear in other things. Ch‛i Tzŭ has exercised this art in his
administration." Lao Tzû puts it in this way: (Chap. 12.)

> <span class="small">"EJECT THIS TO ACCEPT THAT, i.e. SUPPRESS THE
> PASSIONS AND FOLLOW THE TAO."</span>

   *Follow the Spirit and cultivate the habit of Wu-wei.*—The Spirit of
the water said to Shadow: "Is Luminosity a spirit?" The Shadow replied,
"Nay". The Spirit of the water said, "How do you know?" Shadow replied,
"The light passes Fu Sang,<span
id="fr_33"></span>[33](tgln1.htm#5_note_33.md) the orient, and daily
illumines the Universe. The brilliancy of the light, tinging the four
seas and the world, has no means of entering the closed door and the
stopped-up window, but spirit penetrates everywhere and floods
everything. Above, it spreads to the very borders and limits of heaven,
below it covers the earth, nourishing all creation. An image cannot be
made of it. Up and down, even to the extremities of the world and
beyond, the Spirit's energies operate. Luminosity cannot be such as
spirit." As Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 43.)

> <span class="small">"THE MOST YIELDING THING IN THE WORLD
> INTERPENETRATES THE FIRMEST."</span>

   Brilliancy<span id="fr_34"></span>[{34}](tgln1.htm#5_note_34.md) asked
Non-Being, "Have you really an existence or are you really
non-existent?" Non-Being made no reply to this.<span
id="fr_35"></span>[35](tgln1.htm#5_note_35.md) Not able to see any
objective form which he could address, he kept gazing on Non-Being's
appearance, dim and vague. He gazed, but saw no manifest form; he
listened, but discerned no sound; he clutched at it, but failed to grasp
anything; he viewed it, but could not fathom it. Brilliancy exclaimed.
"Wonderful! <span id="page_134">p. 134</span> Who can attain to this? I
can be the Invisible Spirit, but I cannot differentiate his qualities; I
can get to be nothing, but I cannot attain to the elimination of nothing
itself."<span id="fr_36"></span>[36](tgln1.htm#5_note_36.md) As Lao Tzû
says: (Chap. 43.)

> <span class="small">"SINCE THE NON-BEING ENTERS INTO THE NON-SPATIAL,
> I KNOW THEREFORE THAT WU-WEI IS PROFITABLE."</span>

   *The Supremacy of the Spirit.*—Pei Kung Sheng<span
id="fr_37"></span>[37](tgln1.htm#5_note_37.md) meditated a revolution.
After the end of an audience, he stood leaning on his lance; the point
pricked his jaw and the blood flowed, but without his being conscious of
it. When the people of Cheng heard of it, they said: "If he is
unconscious of this, what will he not be unconscious of!" This shows
that when the spirit follows ideas beyond the physical frame and the
mind is flooded with thoughts and designs, there is no attention paid to
wounds nearer home. Hence, when the mind is occupied with distant
objects, things nearer the body are foregotten. Just as Lao Tzû says:
(Chap. 47.)

> <span class="small">"BY NOT GOING OUT OF YOUR DOOR YOU MAY LEARN OF
> THE AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY. WITHOUT LOOKING OUT OF YOUR WINDOW, THE
> HEAVENLY DOCTRINE CAN BE KNOWN. THE FARTHER YOU TRAVEL IN YOUR
> RESEARCHES THE LESS YOU KNOW."</span>

   The saying is illustrated by the foregoing historical episode.

   *Forts are not the best guardians of a frontier.*—The emperor
Ts‛in,<span id="fr_38"></span>[38](tgln1.htm#5_note_38.md) anxious about
maintaining the empire he had won, assigned guardposts on the frontiers,
built the Great Wall, organized likin stations and bridges, erected
fortifications, prepared express services and appointed frontier
officials. Nevertheless Liu Pang captured the empire most easily.<span
id="fr_39"></span>[39](tgln1.htm#5_note_39.md)

   When Wu Wang punished Chou and broke his power at Mu Yeh, he
nevertheless sealed up the grave of Pi Kan (Chou's founder): he
exhibited notices of immunity and protection over the shops of the
merchants; he placed a guard at the door of Ch‛i Tzu.<span
id="fr_40"></span>[40](tgln1.htm#5_note_40.md) He offered his respects
<span id="page_135">p. 135</span> at the temple of Ch‛eng Ch‛iao; he
distributed the grain at Chu Ch‛iao; he disbursed the money-hoards at Lu
T‛ai; he broke his war drum and war staff; he unbent his bows and broke
their strings; he abandoned his palace and lived in the suburbs to show
the settlement of peace and the change of regime. He laid by the sword
and adopted the ivory tablet,<span
id="fr_41"></span>[41](tgln1.htm#5_note_41.md) to show that all enmity had
been laid aside. Whereupon the whole empire became jubilant and praised
him. The Feudal Lords brought their tributes (silk) and paid court for
34 generations, without a break. As Lao Tzŭ says: (Chap. 27.)

> <span class="small">"HE WHO CLOSES WELL, THOUGH WITHOUT BAR AND BOLT,
> YET IT CANNOT BE OPENED. HE WHO BINDS WELL, THOUGH WITHOUT ROPE AND
> CORD, YET IT CANNOT BE UNTIED."</span>

   *The mental condition that will lead to mastery.*—Yin Hsü tried to
learn driving, for three years, without success. He was extremely
troubled and thought hard on the matter. One night, in a dream, Ch‛iu
Chia (the great charioteer) appeared as his teacher. Going to call, the
following day, on his usual instructor, he was greeted with the remark,
"It isn't that I dislike instructing you; I fear it is that you are
incapable of instruction. To-day I am going to tell you the art of Ch‛iu
Chia (I can't do more)." Yin Hsü turned to go, but did the usual
courtesy saying: "Your pupil has met with great good fortune. I truly
received his instruction in a dream last night." This is what Lao Tzü
says: (Chap. 16.)

> <span class="small">"WHEN THE MIND IS CONVINCED OF THE UNREALITY OF
> VISIBLE THINGS AND HOLDS STEADFASTLY TO THIS UNDISTUBED STATE, THOUGH
> THE WHOLE CREATION IS SPREAD OUT BEFORE THE EYES, I LOOK TO THE
> MIND."<span id="fr_42"></span>[42](tgln1.htm#5_note_42.md)</span>

   *Superior Men.*—Formerly Sun Hsü Ao thrice gained the post of Prime
Minister without showing any special gratification. He also vacated the
office thrice without any compunction or manifestation of chagrin. Chi
Tzû of Yen Ling was pressed by the Wu people to become <span
id="page_136">p. 136</span> their King, but refused the honour.

   Hsü Yu declined the throne and refused to accept it.

   An Tzû made an oath to Ts‛ui Shu that he would not change his loyalty
to the old house, though he were to suffer death for it.

   All these loyal men had a vision of something beyond the present.
Their spirits were indifferent to life and death, and so they were not
to be beguiled by any material conditions or worldly goods.

   *The spirit of Self-sacrifice.*—The Ching nation had a man named Tz‛u
Fei, who gained an excalibur in the army of the Kan country. On
returning from the war, he had to cross a river. When midway, a violent
storm was raised by Yang Hou, the spirit of the water, and two scaly
dragons clutched the sides of the boat. Tz‛u Fei asked the ferrymen
whether they had ever survived another such storm. They replied it was
most unusual. So Tz‛u Fei with wide-open eyes, rolling up his sleeves
and drawing out his sword exclaimed: "A soldier may be persuaded by the
courteous way of kindness and justice, but he refuses to submit to
intimidation. You rotten and despicable creatures of the river! I
wouldn't grieve if I lost my precious sword in attacking you!" So,
jumping into the river, he slashed at the dragons and cut off their
heads. All the passengers were saved, and the wind and waves died away.
Tz‛u Fei was made a Baron of Ching, with territory. Confucius, hearing
of it, remarked, "Tz‛u Fei did well in drawing his sword at the hideous
monsters of the river." Thus Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 75.)

> <span class="small">"HE WHO ACTS, REGARDLESS OF LIFE, IS WORTHIER THAN
> THE MAN WHO PUTS LIFE BEFORE ALL."</span>

   *The man of fickle purpose is unfit to be a leader.*—Shun Yu K‛un of
Ch‛i counselled King Wu to adopt the principle of Federation. The King
accepted the advice and gave him ten fine chariots to go to Ching. When
about to depart, his men held that federation was not good enough; so he
offered the King the further advice of <span id="page_137">p. 137</span>
Imperialism.<span id="fr_43"></span>[43](tgln1.htm#5_note_43.md) Just as he
was departing with this alternative idea, the King stopped him, as he
had lost confidence in a man who had as suddenly abandoned the purpose
of federation, holding such a person incompetent to work out the
principle of imperialism, as he was unstable. Words should be based on
conviction, and business should be carried forward on fundamental
principles. When these are both lost, devices, though many, are useless.
This is the significance of the figure biting his finger cast on the
Chou tripod.<span id="fr_44"></span>[44](tgln1.htm#5_note_44.md) It showed
the mind of the ancient kings how they did not care to use forced
cleverness. Hence Sheng Tzû says, "A carpenter knows how to make a door.
If he only made one to open and not to shut, he would not know the
intention and raison d'être of a door."

   *Personality must not be hampered.*—Tien Chiu of the sect of Mei Tzû
followed the master's method. Desiring to see King Hui of Ch‛ing, he
hung up the reins of his fine carriage, vainly waiting audience. He
remained a whole year at the court without getting an interview. Some
one advised him to go and see the King of Ts‛u. This king received him
gladly and gave him credentials to go as minister to Ch‛ing. On
arriving, King Hui finding that he was duly accredited with a general's
commission, received him willingly and gave him an audience. In leaving
the palace, he sighed deeply, saying to those around him: "I stayed for
three years at Ch‛ing without an audience; never did I imagine I could
get one viâ Ts‛u." In business matters it may be said: "The near is
distant, and the distant is near." Hence the ways of the great man may
not be gauged by any routine formula. He arrives at his object in his
own way, and that is all about it, as Kuan Tzu remarks: "An owl will not
get to its destination if its wings are tied."

   The great depths of the Feng waters do not keep any dust and debris
on the surface. Throw a needle in and it is quite visible at the bottom.
It isn't the depth, but clearness that matters. Neither fish, turtle,
dragon, <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> nor snake care to appear
within. For the same reason cereals will not grow on a stone, nor do
deer and stags roam on the bare hills, since there is no cover to give
them hiding.

   *Generosity of spirit.*—Once on a time, Chao Wen Tzû asked Shu
Hsiang<span id="fr_45"></span>[45](tgln1.htm#5_note_45.md) which of the six
generals of Tsin would die first. He replied that it would be Chih of
the centre army: "because," he said, "this man in administering, carried
on his examination with harshness; he informed himself of vexatious
details; he regarded loyalty to consist in being stingy to his
underlings and reckoned that merit lay in gaining many good marks from
the government. Such a person may be likened to one stretching leather.
Pull it, and it can be made larger. Nevertheless, this is the way to
tear it. Lao Tzû says:

> <span class="small">"HE WHO ADMINISTERS IN A GENEROUS SPIRIT WILL HAVE
> A SINCERE AND SIMPLE PEOPLE: HE WHO IS PETTYFOGGING AND VEXATIOUS WILL
> HAVE A PEOPLE IN POVERTY."</span>

   *Strict justice and loyalty.*—The Duke of Ching asked T‛ai P‛u what
was the effect of his teaching? And the reply was: "It can shake the
Earth." An Tzû, the Prime Minister, went to interview the duke, and the
duke said to him, "T‛ai P‛u told me his ability could shake the Earth.
Now how can he shake the Earth?" An Tzû was silent and made no reply. He
went out and spoke to T‛ai P‛u saying, "I saw formerly the planet Kou in
the region of Fang Hsin (\#\#\#). Did it shake the earth?" T‛ai P‛u
replied, "Naturally it did." An Tzû withdrew and T‛ai P‛u went to the
Duke, saying he didn't mean to say that he could shake earth, but that
the earth was about to shake from natural causes. Tien Tzû Yang, hearing
this, said, "The perplexing silence of An Tzû arose from his desire to
shield T‛ai P‛u from death." His interview with T‛ai P‛u showed his
desire to know the truth, fearing lest the king should have deceived him
in what he had said. It may be truly said that An Tzû acted loyally to
<span id="page_139">p. 139</span> his superior and graciously towards
those under him. As Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 58.)

> <span class="small">"SQUARE IN CONDUCT WITHOUT DEFECTS, TO BE JUSTLY
> STRICT WITHOUT INJURING, STERN IN DUTY WITHOUT IN JUSTICE."</span>

   *A mistaken judgement.*—Viscount Wei Wen, at a feast he gave to his
ministers at Yang Ch‛ü (Tai Yuan), being somewhat under the influence of
liquor, sighed deeply, as he said: "I alone have no minister like to Yu
Jang." For loyalty Ch‛un Chung poured out a large cupful of liquor and
held it up to the king saying: "May it please you to drink up this 'as a
fine.'" "Why so," replied the king. "Your servant has heard it said,
that the carrying out of the requests of parents is not thought of as
filial piety. A just prince does not think of the loyalty of ministers
who carry out their duties." Now what kind of man was Yu Jang's king? He
was a defeated prince. Viscount Wen drank the cup at one gulp, saying:
"The deed of Yu Jang arose from the lack of loyal ministers of the type
of Kuan Chung and Pao Hsü." Loyalty is seen in times of anarchy. Hence
Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 18.)

|                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">"THE ANARCHY OF A NATION REVEALS LOYAL MINISTERS."</span> |

   *Do not be puffed up by knowledge.*—When Confucius was viewing the
fane of Duke Huan, in which was a vessel called Yu Chih,<span
id="fr_46"></span>[{46}](tgln1.htm#5_note_46.md)—or the leaning tube,—he
exclaimed: "How splendid that we have seen this vessel!" Turning to his
disciples, he said, "Boys, bring some water." When the vessel was half
filled, it stood upright; but when the water reached the brim, the
centre of gravity was shifted and the vessel overturned. Suddenly
Confucius changed countenance saying, "Perfect is the lesson of holding
the full vessel!" Tzû Kung, standing at his side, said, "Please tell us
more of this holding of a full vessel." "Superfluity brings its penalty.
There is danger in superabundance," said Confucius. "What do you mean by
this?" "When a thing has reached luxuriance, decay has <span
id="page_140">p. 140</span> also set in. Mirth is followed by
melancholy; the sun goes down after its zenith; a full moon wanes."

   Hence quick intelligence and a rich wisdom should be preserved by
simplicity, encyclopaedic information and wide attainments by lowliness,
martial strength and bold courage by awe, great wealth and position by
economy, universal beneficence by reserve and modesty. It was by
observing these five qualities that the empire was preserved. History
affirms that the spirit of these five principles could not be
contravened with impunity. As Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 15.)

> <span class="small">"THEY WHO ADHERE TO THIS DOCTRINE HAVE NO DESIRE
> FOR EXUBERANCE. ONLY BY NOT BEING OVERFLOWING, ONE IS ABLE TO (LIVE)
> QUIETLY AND NOT TO HAVE NOTORIETY AND THUS BE ABLE TO KEEP A STATE OF
> MODESTY WITHOUT OUTWARD OSTENTATION."</span>

   *A criticism of current methods of government which were based on
opportunism and therefore a great contrast to true government based on
the Tao.*—Wu Wang enquired of T‛ai Kung an opinion on his action in
punishing Chou, whether the world would not look on it as the murder of
a master by his servant, and whether his fears were groundless that the
example might be followed by later ages, giving rise to constant
employment of troops and the perpetuation of strifes. T‛ai Kung replied
that the king's question was most excellent, saying, in illustration,
that sportsmen were anxious lest the hit was too slight before they had
the prey: but, once they had the bag, the fear was lest the flesh had
been torn too much. Did the king therefore desire to hold the nation
securely for long, he should shut up the avenue of the senses, i.e. the
eye, ear, nose, mouth of the people.

   The Tao was useless for the people and education but an evil.<span
id="fr_47"></span>[47](tgln1.htm#5_note_47.md) When the people are all
pleased with their occupations and their desires all gratified, the cap
of the general may be changed for that of the scholar. Let the sword be
sheathed and the ivory displayed. Let the people <span id="page_141">p.
141</span> be made to be in mourning for three years so that the
population be diminished. Let the high refuse office and the masses
yield their rights, and so keep them from strifes and struggles. Let
them rejoice in social feasts and be amused with music and orchestras:
let them be awed by religion: multiply etiquettes and swell ceremonies
in profusion, so that simplicity of nature may be buried in these
artificialities: let burials be costly and mourning be protracted, in
order to weaken the family power. Let them spend freely on pearls and
ornaments: on silk tassels elaborately worked, so that they may be
impoverished. Let them dig deep trenches and build high walls to exhaust
their energies. Impoverished in family wealth, diminished in population,
their whole attention will be concerned with their poverties. Let social
reforms move on these lines and it will be possible to keep the country
without the fear of loss. As Lao Tzû says: (Chap. 37.)

> <span class="small">WHEN DESIRES RE-ENTER THE HEART, THEY SHOULD BE
> SUPPRESSED BY THE UNADORNED SUBSTANCE OF THE NAMELESS TAO.</span>
