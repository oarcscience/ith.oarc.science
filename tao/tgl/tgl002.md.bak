### PREFACE

   For some years, now, I have been, off and on, a student of the essays
of Huai Nan Tzû. Occasional papers on his work have been read before the
Royal Asiatic Society (N. C. B.) and other societies. Some who heard the
papers thought a translation of the essays was most desirable. In the
course of time this object has been kept in view, and, at long last, it
is now possible to publish, in English, eight of the twenty-one essays.

   The work of Huai Nan Tzû has always been highly esteemed by all
scholars. This is not surprising. It contains great ideals and passages
of matchless beauty. It is a work not easy of interpretation. But though
the shell is hard, the core is sweet. There are unusual words in the
composition: the ideas are often recondite and vague. There are many
things not clear in the description even of the phenomena of the visible
world; but in the description of the invisible world the conceptions are
often vague and the language necessarily not clear. To increase the
difficulty there is frequent use made of paradox, hyperbole, the
indirect and the allusive method: there is often the subtle reference
and occultive meaning.

   The theme also occupies a field of its own. Taoism is an original and
unique philosophy. To anyone unaquainted with its teaching the language
and ideas will seem strange and hard. As Huai Nan Tzû deals with the
doctrine of Lao Tan, and was a keen follower of his teaching, it is
essential for his readers to have some familiarity with the writings of
that sage. These are found in the Tao Tê Ching. Unfortunately, there are
no perspicuous translations of this important work. The best two are
those of Dr. James Legge and Mr. Spurgeon Medhurst. But often they
contain passages as vague as the original! The meaning does not shine
out from the words. The translation seems quite correct; but yet the
<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span> meaning is not quite clear.

   This leads me to venture an opinion on what a translation should be.
It should always convey a definite meaning and expressed as clearly as
possible. The translation should be as near the original as possible.
But the chief requisite is that each sentence must have a meaning
clearly expressed. Otherwise the translation is useless. It is admitted
that a paraphrase may sometimes be necessary; but if this conveys the
meaning, it will be a good translation.

   The Tao Tê Ching is hard to be understood. But a study of it is
fruitful. It is conceded that Lao Tzû was one of the most original
thinkers of China. His must have been a unique personality. He commanded
the love and loyalty of a disciple, Chuang Tzû, who came 200 years after
him, and was one of China's most celebrated scholars. He spent his
talents and life in explaining and extolling the master. How much did
this master ever write? We only know of the 5,000 words of the Tao Tê
Ching. There are critics who doubt if such a person as Lao Tan ever
existed. Those who hold such a view have to explain Chuang Tzû. That
safe and sound critic Dr. J. Legge, is firmly convinced that he was a
historical person and that the Tao Tê Ching is his work.

   It has often struck me that Lao Tan bore some similarity to Mr.
Bernard Shaw. The modern Irishman and the Chinese of a distant age have
a floating resemblance, as they possess things in common. They take a
delight in the paradoxical way of writing and in making strange
affirmations. Sometimes a doubt hovers round the mind of the reader as
to whether they expected him to believe their statements. Both like to
shock the public by a seeming absurdity of assertion. Yet all becomes
understood when one realises that the writers' great desire is to awaken
men from dead tradition to a more real life. They discharge the function
of the gadfly to which Socrates compared himself. It stings people to a
new consciousness. There <span id="page_vii">p. vii</span> is, however,
a difference of method. Mr. Shaw speaks much in the first personal
pronoun, and vigorously. It would be transgressing against a fundamental
principle of Lao Tan to do this. Suppression of self is a leading tenet
of the Taoist philosophy. The Ego is only a medium for the expression of
the Tao.

   Besides a translation of eight of the essays, there are ancillary
helps to the understanding of the work. And there are Notes and
Annotations, Elucidations, Epitomes and Analyses. Under the heading of
introduction, there are various themes discussed,—themes that have
naturally arisen out of and that have been suggested by the
subject-matter of the Dissertations. These, it is hoped, will be a help
to a better understanding of the romantic mind of a thinker whose
life-long meditations have been concerned with the profoundest subjects
that can occupy human thought, the cosmos, spirit and man. These notes
may help to solve some of the puzzling questions that are suggested by
the work, such as, the science of "do nothing and there will be nothing
undone" which will be recognised as conveying a deep truth connected
with human and Divine nature. That "the existent comes from the
non-existent" will not seem to be an irreconcilable contradiction: and
the phrase "a wide experience gives but a little knowledge" is really
not so absurd as it seems on the face of it. There are also words that
are different in meaning but which seem so much alike that it is not
easy to see the nuances suggested.

   The author has ventured to give a new translation of the word Tao,
viz., Cosmic Spirit. This seems to cover all the ideas found in the
original. However, it is necessary to say, in anticipation of legitimate
criticism, that the name has not been consistently used throughout. That
of "Tao" is often retained.

   I have not prepared a Bibliography nor a critique of the text. It is
sufficient to say that a Chinese edition of Huai Nan Tzû can be bought
in most old book shops. <span id="page_viii">p. viii</span> But the best
edition is that published by the Commercial Press and edited by Liu
Wen-tien. The introduction to this is by Dr. Hu Shih. I have taken the
work as arranged in the \#\#\#, as the basis of my translation.

   I have been under great obligation to many friends for help in
preparing the book, and I take this opportunity of expressing my
gratitude. I would like to mention Mr. Chou Yun-lou, Mr. Tu Shao-heng,
Mr. C. F. Yeh and others. Especially am I indebted to Mr. T. M. Lien, an
accomplished scholar. He has helped me in many ways. The essay on "The
Life and Times of Lao Tan" has been prepared from materials supplied by
him: also much of the matter in the elucidations and other subjects. The
diagrams are also from him, I should also like to express my gratitude
to the share my wife has had in the work. Her help has been invaluable.
I offer my hearty thanks to all these friends.
