# Tao, The Great Luminant

## Essays from the Huai Nan Tzu

### by Evan S. Morgan

##### \[Shanghai, 1933\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Huai Nan Tzu is a sprawling, encyclopedic work of Chinese thought
that was compiled late in the second century B.C.E. under the auspices
of Liu An, the prince of Huai Nan. Liu An was a great patron of the arts
and philosophy and was the paternal uncle of the Han emperor, Wu. He had
gathered many of the major lights of the Chinese literati of the time to
his court and he presented the book to his nephew as a gift upon Wu's
ascension to the imperial throne in the hopes that it would provide him
with suitable instruction upon the proper rule of the empire. Liu An,
however, and his book, were working against the swelling tide of
imperial centralization, and he was eventually put to death for his
pains.

This book, like most of the books labeled as 'Taoist', shows the great
difficulty associated with that classification. It is actually one of
the earlier examples that we have of the philosophy that became known as
'Huang-Lao', after Huang Ti, the mythical Yellow Emperor, and Lao Tzu,
the great patron of all things Taoist. Huang-Lao philosophy is usually
concerned with government and with exerting imperial control in an
almost laissez-faire fashion. It is quite practical and unequivocally
opposed to the concern with rites and 'traditions' that became known as
Confucianism, the ideology that came to dominate the Han empire soon
after Liu An's death. It is not at all quietistic, and the anarchical
philosophy of Chuang Tzu has no place in this book. The Huai Nan Tzu
also has no patience for what later became known as religious Taoism,
the eclectic assortment of legends, rituals, alchemy, and physical and
mental exercises aimed at conferring immortality upon its practicioners.

<span class="small">**Notes to the hypertext transcription:** This book
was in dire need of more thorough proofreading when it went to the
printer. There are endnotes missing and references to endnotes missing.
The spelling and punctuation is quite sketchy in many places, and I have
taken the liberty of correcting it where the correction is obvious,
matching quotation marks, changing periods to commas, replacing "d'ont"
with "don't", etc. Still, the punctuation is atrocious. The diacritical
marks on Chinese names are also very inconsistent. For example, Lao Tzu
is spelled Tzû, Tzŭ, Tzu, and Tzü in different places, sometimes even in
the same paragraph. These have been retained as they are in the book for
lack of any apparent system to restore them to and because I do not
speak or write Chinese and am reluctant to make the call on spelling.
The apostrophes in Chinese words are also used inconsistently and they
point both directions (i.e., ‘ and ’) indiscriminately. As the
orientation of the apostrophe makes no difference in Chinese orthography
(unlike Arabic), and because the OCR software does not pick up on the
difference, all of them are rendered as ‛, the character used in Legge's
works, which has the virtue of being distinguishable from quotation
marks and apostrophes.</span>
