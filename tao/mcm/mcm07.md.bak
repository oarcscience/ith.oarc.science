### ILLUSIONS

<span class="smallcaps">How</span> do I know that love of life is not a
delusion after all? How do I know but that he who dreads to die is as a
child who has lost the way and cannot find his home?

The lady Li Chi was the daughter of Ai Fêng. When the Duke of Chin first
got her, she wept until the bosom of her dress was drenched with tears.
But when she came to the royal residence, and lived with the Duke, and
ate rich food, she repented of having wept. How then do I know but that
the dead repent of having previously clung to life?

Those who dream of the banquet wake to lamentation and sorrow. Those who
dream of lamentation and sorrow wake to join the hunt. While they dream,
they do not know that they dream. Some will even interpret the very
dream they are dreaming; and only when they awake do they know it was a
dream. By and by comes the Great Awakening, and then we find out that
this life is really a great dream. Fools think they are awake now, and
flatter themselves

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

they know if they are really princes or peasants. Confucius and you are
both dreams; and I who say you are dreams,—I am but a dream myself. This
is a paradox. To-morrow a sage may arise to explain it; but that
tomorrow will not be until ten thousand generations have gone by.

Granting that you and I argue. If you beat me, and not I you, are you
necessarily right and I wrong? Or if I beat you and not you me, am I
necessarily right and you wrong? Or are we both partly right and partly
wrong? Or are we both wholly right or wholly wrong? You and I cannot
know this, and consequently the world will be in ignorance of the truth.

Who shall I employ as arbiter between us? If I employ some one who takes
your view, he will side with you. How can such a one arbitrate between
us? If I employ some one who takes my view, he will side with me. How
can such a one arbitrate between us? And if I employ some one who either
differs from or agrees with both of us, he will be equally unable to
decide between us. Since then you, and I, and man, cannot decide, must
we not depend upon Another? Such dependence is as though it were not
dependence. We are embraced in the obliterating unity of God.

Once upon a time, I, Chuang dreamt

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I was a butterfly,
fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly.
I was conscious only of following my fancies as a butterfly, and was
unconscious of my individuality as a man. Suddenly I awaked, and there I
lay, myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I
was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man.
Between a man and a butterfly there is necessarily a barrier. The
transition is called metempsychosis.
