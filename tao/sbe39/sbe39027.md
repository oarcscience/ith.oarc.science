### 20.

20\. 1. When we renounce learning we have no troubles.  
The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'--  
Small is the difference they display.  
But mark their issues, good and ill;--  
What space the gulf between shall fill?  
What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end
is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)!

2\. The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a
full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless
and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their

presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected
and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have
enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is
that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos.

Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be
benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and
confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had
nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone
seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am
different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tâo).

<span id="img_06300"></span> ![](img/06300.jpg), 'Being Different from
Ordinary Men.' The chapter sets forth the difference to external
appearance which the pursuit and observance of the Tâo produces between
its votaries and others; and Lâo-dze speaks in it as himself an example
of the former. In the last three chapters he has 'been advocating the
cause of the Tâo against the learning and philosophy of the other school
of thinkers in the country. Here he appears as having renounced
learning, and found an end to the troubles and anxieties of his own
mind; but at the expense of being misconceived and misrepresented by
others. Hence the chapter has an autobiographical character.

Having stated the fact following the renunciation of learning, he
proceeds to dwell upon the troubles of learning in the rest of par. 1.
Until the votary of learning knows everything, he has no rest. But the
instances which he adduces of this are not striking nor easily
understood. I cannot throw any light on the four lines about the 'yes'
and the 'Yea.'

Confucius (Ana. XVI, viii) specifies three things of which the superior
man stands in awe; and these and others of

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

a similar nature may have been the things which Lâo-dze had in his mind.
The nursing-mother at the end is, no doubt, the Tâo in operation, 'with
a name,' as in ch. i the mysterious virtue' of chapters 51 and 52.
