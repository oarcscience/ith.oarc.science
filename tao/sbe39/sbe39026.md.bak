### 19.

19\. 1. If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it
would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our
benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become
filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and
discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers.

2\. Those three methods (of government)  
Thought olden ways in elegance did fail  
And made these names their want of worth to veil;  
But simple views, and courses plain and true  
Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew.

Unadulterated Influence.' The chapter desires a return to the simplicity
of the Tâo, and shows how superior the result would be to that of the
more developed systems of morals and government which had superseded it.
It is closely connected with the two chapters that precede. Lâo-dze's
call for the renunciation of the methods of the sages and rulers in lieu
of his fancied paradisiacal state is repeated ad nauseam by Kwang-dze.
