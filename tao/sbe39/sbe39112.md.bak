### BOOK XXIV. HSÜ WÛ-KWEI.

This Book is named from the first three characters in it, the surname
and name of Hsü Wû-kwei, who plays the most important part in the first
two paragraphs, and does not further appear. He comes before us as a
well-known recluse of Wei, who visits the court to offer his counsels to
the marquis of the state. But whether there ever was such

a man, or whether he was only a creation of Kwang-dze, we cannot, so far
as I know, tell.

Scattered throughout the Book are the lessons so common with our author
against sagehood and knowledge, and on the quality of doing nothing and
thereby securing the doing of everything. The concluding chapter is one
of the finest descriptions in the whole Work of the Tâo and of the
Tâoistic idea of Heaven. 'There are in the Book,' says Lû Fang, 'many
dark and mysterious expressions. It is not to be read hastily; but the
more it is studied, the more flavour will there be found in it.'
