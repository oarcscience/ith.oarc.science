### BOOK XXII. KIH PEI YÛ.

With this Book the Second Part of Kwang-dze's Essays or Treatises ends.
'All the Books in it,' says Lû Shû-kih, 'show the opposition of Tâoism
to the pursuit of knowledge as enjoined in the Confucian and other
schools; and this Book may be regarded as the deepest, most vehement,
and clearest of them all.' The concluding sentences of the last
paragraph and Lâo-dze's advice to Confucius in par. 5, to 'sternly
repress his knowledge,' may be referred to as illustrating the
correctness of Lû's remark.

Book seventeenth is commonly considered to be the most eloquent of
Kwang-dze's Treatises, but this twenty-second Book is not inferior to it
in eloquence, and it is more characteristic of his method of argument.
The way in which he runs riot in the names with which he personifies the
attributes of the Tâo, is a remarkable instance of the subtle manner in
which he often brings out his ideas; and in no other Book does he set
forth more emphatically what his own idea of the Tâo was, though the
student often fails to be certain that he has exactly caught the
meaning.

The title, let it be observed, belongs only to the first paragraph. The
Kih in it must be taken in the sense of 'knowledge,' and not of
'wisdom.'
