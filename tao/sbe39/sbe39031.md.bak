### 24.

24\. He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches
his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not
shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts
himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self-conceited
has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the
standpoint of the Tâo, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the
body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tâo
do not adopt and allow them.

The chapter should be so designated. This concludes the subject of the
two previous chapters,-pursuing the course, the course of the
unemotional Tâo without vain effort or display.

The remnants of food were not used as sacrificial offerings;--see the Lî
Kî (vol. xxvii, p. 82). In what I have rendered by 'a tumour attached to
the body,' the <span id="img_06701"></span> ![](img/06701.jpg) is
probably, by a mistake, for <span id="img_06702"></span>
![](img/06702.jpg);--see a quotation by Wû Khäng from Sze-mâ Khien.
"Which all dislike' is, literally, 'Things are likely to dislike them,'
the 'things' being 'spirits and men,' as Wû explains the term.
