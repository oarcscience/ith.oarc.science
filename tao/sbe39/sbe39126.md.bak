## BOOK V.

### PART I. SECTION V.

### Teh Khung Fû, or 'The Seal of Virtue Complete <span id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_197.md).'

1\. In Lû <span id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_198.md) there was a Wang
Thâi <span id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_199.md) who had lost both his
feet <span id="fr_214"></span>[4](#fn_200.md); while his disciples who
followed and went about with him were as numerous as those of Kung-nî.
Khang Kî <span id="fr_215"></span>[5](#fn_201.md) asked Kung-nî about him,
saying, 'Though Wang Thâi is a cripple, the disciples who follow him
about divide Lû equally with you, Master. When he stands, he does not
teach them; when he sits, he does not discourse to them. But they go to
him empty, and come back full. Is there indeed such a thing as
instruction without words <span id="fr_216"></span>[6](#fn_202.md)? and
while the body is imperfect, may the mind be complete? What sort of man
is he?'

Kung-nî replied, 'This master is a sage. I have

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

only been too late in going to him. I will make him my teacher; and how
much more should those do so who are not equal to me! Why should only
the state of Lû follow him? I will lead on all under heaven with me to
do so.' Khang Kî rejoined, 'He is a man who has lost his feet, and yet
he is known as the venerable Wang <span
id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_203.md);--he must be very different from
ordinary men. What is the peculiar way in which he employs his mind?'
The reply was, 'Death and life are great considerations, but they could
work no change in him. Though heaven and earth were to be overturned and
fall, they would occasion him no loss. His judgment is fixed regarding
that in which there is no element of falsehood <span
id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_204.md); and, while other things change, he
changes not. The transformations of things are to him the developments
prescribed for them, and he keeps fast hold of the author of them <span
id="fr_219"></span>[2](#fn_204.md).'

Khang Kî said, 'What do you mean? When we look at things,' said Kung-nî,
'as they differ, we see them to be different, (as for instance) the
liver and the gall, or Khû and Yüeh; when we look at them, as they
agree, we see them all to be a unity. So it is with this (Wang Thai). He
takes no knowledge of the things for which his ears and eyes are the
appropriate organs, but his mind delights itself in the harmony of (all
excellent) qualities. He looks at the unity which belongs to things, and
does not perceive where they have suffered loss. He looks

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

on the loss of his feet as only the loss of so much earth.'

Khang Kî said, 'He is entirely occupied with his (proper) self <span
id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_205.md). By his knowledge he has discovered (the
nature of) his mind, and to that he holds as what is unchangeable <span
id="fr_221"></span>[1](#fn_205.md); but how is it that men make so much of
him?' The reply was, 'Men do not look into running water as a mirror,
but into still water;--it is only the still water that can arrest them
all, and keep them (in the contemplation of their real selves). Of
things which are what they are by the influence of the earth, it is only
the pine and cypress which are the best instances;-in winter as in
summer brightly green <span id="fr_222"></span>[2](#fn_206.md). Of those
which were what they were by the influence of Heaven <span
id="fr_223"></span>[3](#fn_207.md), the most correct examples were Yâo and
Shun; fortunate in (thus) maintaining their own life correct, and so as
to correct the lives of others.

'As a verification of the (power of) the original endowment, when it has
been preserved, take the result of fearlessness,-how the heroic spirit
of a single brave soldier has been thrown into an army of nine
hosts <span id="fr_224"></span>[4](#fn_208.md). If a man only seeking for
fame and able in this way to secure it can produce such an effect, how
much more (may we look for a greater

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

result) from one whose rule is over heaven and earth, and holds all
things in his treasury, who simply has his lodging in the six
members <span id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_209.md) of his body, whom his ears
and eyes serve but as conveying emblematic images of things, who
comprehends all his knowledge in a unity, and whose mind never dies! If
such a man were to choose a day on which he would ascend far on high,
men would (seek to) follow him there. But how should he be willing to
occupy himself with other men?'

2\. Shän-thû Kîa <span id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_210) was (another.md) man
who had lost his feet. Along with dze-khân <span
id="fr_227"></span>[3](#fn_211.md) of Käng <span
id="fr_228"></span>[3](#fn_211.md) he studied under the master Po-hwän
Wû-zän <span id="fr_229"></span>[4](#fn_212.md). Dze-khân said to him (one
day), 'If I go out first, do you remain behind; and if you go out first,
I will remain behind.' Next day they were again sitting together on the
same mat in the hall, when Dze-khân spoke the same words to him,
adding,' Now I am about to go out; will you stay behind or not?
Moreover, when you see one of official rank (like myself), you do not
try to get out of his way;-do you consider yourself equal to one of
official rank?' Shän-thû Kîa replied, 'In our Master's school is there
indeed such recognition required of official rank? You are one, Sir,
whose pleasure is in your official rank, and would therefore take
precedence of other men. I

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

have heard that when a mirror is bright, the dust does not rest on it;
when dust rests on it the mirror is not bright. When one dwells long
with a man of ability and virtue, he comes to be without error. There
now is our teacher whom you have chosen to make you greater than you
are; and when you still talk in this way, are you not in error?'
Dze-khân rejoined, 'A (shattered) object as you are, you would still
strive to make yourself out as good as Yâo! If I may form an estimate of
your virtue, might it not be sufficient to lead you to the examination
of yourself?' The other said, 'Most criminals, in describing their
offences, would make it out that they ought not to have lost (their
feet) for them; few would describe them so as to make it appear that
they should not have preserved their feet. They are only the virtuous
who know that such a calamity was unavoidable, and therefore rest in it
as what was appointed for them. When men stand before (an archer like)
Î <span id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_213.md) with his bent bow, if they are
in the middle of his field, that is the place where they should be hit;
and if they be not hit, that also was appointed. There are many with
their feet entire who laugh at me because I have lost my feet, which
makes me feel vexed and angry. But when I go to our teacher, I throw off
that feeling, and return (to a better mood);--he has washed, without my
knowing it, the other from me by (his instructions in) what is good. I
have attended him now for nineteen years, and have not known that I am
without my feet. Now, you, Sir, and I have for the object of our study
the

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

(virtue) which is internal, and not an adjunct of the body, and yet you
are continually directing your attention to my external body;--are you
not wrong in this?' Dze-khân felt uneasy, altered his manner and looks,
and said, 'You need not, Sir, say anything more about it.'

3\. In Lû there was a cripple, called Shû-shan the Toeless <span
id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_214.md), who came on his heels to see Kung-nî.
Kung-nî said to him, 'By your want of circumspection in the past, Sir,
you have incurred such a calamity;--of what use is your coming to me
now?' Toeless said, 'Through my ignorance of my proper business and
taking too little care of my body, I came to lose my feet. But now I am
come to you, still possessing what is more honourable than my feet, and
which therefore I am anxious to preserve entire. There is nothing which
Heaven does not cover, and nothing which Earth does not sustain; you,
Master, were regarded by me as doing the part of Heaven and Earth;--how
could I know that you would receive me in such a way?' Confucius
rejoined, 'I am but a poor creature. But why, my master, do you not come
inside, where I will try to tell you what I have learned?' When Toeless
had gone out, Confucius said, 'Be stimulated to effort, my disciples.
This toeless cripple is still anxious to learn to make up for the evil
of his former conduct;--how much more should those be so whose conduct
has been unchallenged!'

Mr. Toeless, however, told Lâo Tan (of the interview),

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

saying, 'Khung Khiû, I apprehend, has not yet attained to be a Perfect
man. What has he to do with keeping a crowd of disciples around him? He
is seeking to have the reputation of being an extraordinary and
marvellous man, and does not know that the Perfect man considers this to
be as handcuffs and fetters to him.' Lâo Tan said, 'Why did you not
simply lead him to see the unity of life and death, and that the
admissible and inadmissible belong to one category, so freeing him from
his fetters? Would this be possible?' Toeless said, 'It is the
punishment inflicted on him by Heaven <span
id="fr_232"></span>[1](#fn_215.md). How can he be freed from it?'

4\. Duke Âi of Lû <span id="fr_233"></span>[2](#fn_216.md) asked Kung-nî,
saying, 'There was an ugly man in Wei, called Âi-thâi Tho <span
id="fr_234"></span>[3](#fn_217.md) . His father-in-law, who lived with him,
thought so much of him that he could not be away from him. His wife,
when she saw him (ugly as he was), represented to her parents, saying,
"I had more than ten times rather be his concubine than the wife of any
other man <span id="fr_235"></span>[4](#fn_218.md)." He was never heard to
take the lead in discussion, but always seemed to be of the same opinion
with others. He had not the position of a ruler, so as to be able to
save men from death. He had no revenues, so as to be able to satisfy
men's craving for food. He was ugly enough, moreover, to scare

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

the whole world. He agreed with men instead of trying to lead them to
adopt his views; his knowledge did not go beyond his immediate
neighbourhood <span id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_219.md). And yet his
father-in-law and his wife were of one mind about him in his presence
(as I have said);--he must have been different from other men. I called
him, and saw him. Certainly he was ugly enough to scare the whole world.
He had not lived with me, however. for many months, when I was drawn to
the man; and before he had been with me a full year, I had confidence in
him. The state being without a chief minister, I (was minded) to commit
the government to him. He responded to my proposal sorrowfully, and
looked undecided as if he would fain have declined it. I was ashamed of
myself (as inferior to him), but finally gave the government into his
hands. In a little time, however, he left me and went away. I was sorry
and felt that I had sustained a loss, and as if there were no other to
share the pleasures of the kingdom with me. What sort of man was he?'

Kung-nî said, 'Once when I was sent on a mission to Khû, I saw some pigs
sucking at their dead mother. After a little they looked with rapid
glances, when they all left her, and ran away. They felt that she did
not see them, and that she was no longer like themselves. What they had
loved in their mother was not her bodily figure, but what had given
animation to her figure. When a man dies in battle, they do not at his
interment employ the usual appendages

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

of plumes <span id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_220.md): as to supplying shoes
to one who has lost his feet, there is no reason why he should care for
them;--in neither case is there the proper reason for their use'. The
members of the royal harem do not pare their nails nor pierce their
ears <span id="fr_238"></span>[2](#fn_221.md); when a man is newly married,
he remains (for a time) absent from his official duties, and unoccupied
with them <span id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_221.md). That their bodies might
be perfect was sufficient to make them thus dealt with;--how much
greater results should be expected from men whose mental gifts are
perfect! This Âi-thâi Tho was believed by men, though he did not speak a
word, and was loved by them, though he did no special service for them.
He made men appoint him to the government of their states, afraid only
that he would not accept the appointment. He must have been a man whose
powers <span id="fr_240"></span>[3](#fn_222.md) were perfect, though his
realisation of them <span id="fr_241"></span>[3](#fn_222.md) was not
manifested in his person.'

Duke Âi said, 'What is meant by saying that his powers were complete?'
Kung-nî replied, 'Death and life, preservation and ruin, failure and
success, poverty and wealth, superiority and inferiority, blame and
praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat;--these are the changes of
circumstances, the operation of our appointed lot. Day and night they
succeed to one another before us, but there is no wisdom

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

able to discover to what they owe their origination. They are not
sufficient therefore to disturb the harmony (of the nature), and are not
allowed to enter into the treasury of intelligence. To cause this
harmony and satisfaction ever to be diffused, while the feeling of
pleasure is not lost from the mind; to allow no break to arise in this
state day or night, so that it is always spring-time <span
id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_223.md) in his relations with external things;
in all his experiences to realise in his mind what is appropriate to
each season (of the year) <span id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_224.md):--these
are the characteristics of him whose powers are perfect.'

'And what do you mean by the realisation of these powers not being
manifested in the person?' (pursued further the duke). The reply was,
'There is nothing so level as the surface of a pool of still water. It
may serve as an example of what I mean. All within its circuit is
preserved (in peace), and there comes to it no agitation from without.
The virtuous efficacy is the perfect cultivation of the harmony (of the
nature). Though the realisation of this be not manifested in the person,
things cannot separate themselves (from its influence).'

Some days afterwards duke Âi told this conversation to Min-dze <span
id="fr_244"></span>[3](#fn_225.md), saying, 'Formerly it seemed to me the
work of the sovereign to stand in court with his face to the south, to
rule the kingdom, and to pay good heed to the accounts of the people
concerned, lest any should come to a (miserable) death;--this

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

\[paragraph continues\] I considered to be the sum (of his duty). Now
that I have heard that description of the Perfect man, I fear that my
idea is not the real one, and that, by employing myself too lightly, I
may cause the ruin of my state. I and Khung Khiû are not on the footing
of ruler and subject, but on that of a virtuous friendship.'

5\. A person who had no lips, whose legs were bent so that he could only
walk on his toes, and who was (otherwise) deformed <span
id="fr_245"></span>[1](#fn_226.md), addressed his counsels to duke Ling of
Wei, who was so pleased with him, that he looked on a perfectly formed
man as having a lean and small neck in comparison with him. Another who
had a large goitre like an earthenware jar <span
id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_226.md) addressed his counsels to duke Hwan of
Khî <span id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_227.md), who was so pleased with him
that he looked on a perfectly formed man as having a neck lean and small
in comparison with him <span id="fr_248"></span>[3](#fn_228.md). So it is
that when one's virtue is extraordinary, (any deficiency in) his bodily
form may be forgotten. When men do not forget what is (easily)
forgotten, and forget what is not (easily) forgotten, we have a case of
real oblivion. Therefore the sagely man has that in which his mind finds
its enjoyment, and (looks on) wisdom as (but) the shoots from an old
stump; agreements with others are to him but so much glue; kindnesses
are

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

(but the arts of) intercourse; and great skill is (but as) merchants'
wares. The sagely man lays no plans;--of what use would wisdom be to
him? He has no cutting and hacking to do;--of what use would glue be to
him? He has lost nothing; of what use would arts of intercourse be to
him? He has no goods to dispose of;--what need has he to play the
merchant? (The want of) these four things are the nourishment of (his)
Heavenly (nature); that nourishment is its Heavenly food. Since he
receives this food from Heaven, what need has he for anything of man's
(devising)? He has the bodily form of man, but not the passions and
desires of (other) men. He has the form of man, and therefore he is a
man. Being without the passions and desires of men, their approvings and
disapprovings are not to be found in him. How insignificant and small is
(the body) by which he belongs to humanity! How grand and great is he in
the unique perfection of his Heavenly (nature)!

Hui-dze said to Kwang-dze, 'Can a man indeed be without desires and
passions?' The reply was, 'He can.' 'But on what grounds do you call him
a man, who is thus without passions and desires?' Kwang-dze said, 'The
Tâo <span id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_229.md) gives him his personal
appearance (and powers); Heaven <span id="fr_250"></span>[2](#fn_230.md)
gives him his bodily form; how should we not call him a man?' Hui-dze
rejoined, 'Since you call him a man, how

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

can he be without passions and desires?' The reply was, 'You are
misunderstanding what I mean by passions and desires. What I mean when I
say that he is without these is, that this man does not by his likings
and dislikings do any inward harm to his body;--he always pursues his
course without effort, and does not (try to) increase his (store of)
life.' Hui-dze rejoined, 'If there were not that increasing of (the
amount) of life, how would he get his body <span
id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_231.md)?' Kwang-dze said, 'The Tâo gives him his
personal appearance (and powers); Heaven gives him his bodily form; and
he does not by his likings and dislikings do any internal harm to his
body. But now you, Sir, deal with your spirit as if it were something
external to you, and subject your vital powers to toil. You sing (your
ditties), leaning against a tree; you go to sleep, grasping the stump of
a rotten dryandra tree. Heaven selected for you the bodily form (of a
man), and you babble about what is strong and what is white <span
id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_232.md).'

<span id="fn_198"></span>[223:2](sbe39126.htm#fr_212.md) The native state
of Confucius, part of the present Shan-tung.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[223:3](sbe39126.htm#fr_213.md) A Tâoist of
complete virtue; but probably there was not really such a person. Our
author fabricates him according to his fashion.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[223:4](sbe39126.htm#fr_214.md) The character uh
(<span id="img_22300"></span> ![](img/22300.jpg)) does not say that he
had lost both his feet, but I suppose that such is the meaning, because
of what is said of Toeless below that 'he walked on his heels to see
Confucius.' The feet must have been amputated, or mutilated rather
(justly or unjustly), as a punishment; but Kwang-dze wished to say
nothing on that point.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[223:5](sbe39126.htm#fr_215.md) Perhaps a disciple
of Confucius;--not elsewhere mentioned as such.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[223:6](sbe39126.htm#fr_216.md) See the Tâo Teh
King, ch. 2.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[224:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_217.md) Literally, 'the
Senior;' often rendered 'Teacher.'

<span id="fn_204"></span>[224:2](sbe39126.htm#fr_219.md) 'That in which
there is no element of falsehood' is the Tâo, which also is the 'Author'
of all the changes that take place in time and space. See the
Introductory Note on the title and subject of the Book.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[225:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_221.md) Wang Thâi saw all
things in the Tâo, and the Tâo in all things. Comp. Book XI, par. 7, et
al.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[225:2](sbe39126.htm#fr_222.md) Notwithstanding
his being a cripple. He forgets that circumstance himself, and all
others forget it, constrained and won by his embodiment of the Tâo. What
follows is an illustration of this, exaggerated indeed, but not so
extravagantly as in many other passages.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[225:3](sbe39126.htm#fr_223.md) In the Tâoistic
meaning of the term.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[225:4](sbe39126.htm#fr_224.md) The royal army
consisted of six hosts; that of a great feudal prince of three. 'Nine
hosts' = a very great army.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[226:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_225.md) The arms, legs,
head, and trunk.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[226:2](sbe39126.htm#fr_226.md) Another cripple
introduced by our author to serve his purpose.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[226:3](sbe39126.htm#fr_228.md) Kung-sun Khiâo; a
good and able minister of Kang, an earldom forming part of the present
Ho-nan. He was a contemporary of Confucius, who wept when he heard of
his death in B. C. 522. He was a scion of the ruling house, which again
was a branch of the royal family of Kâu.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[226:4](sbe39126.htm#fr_229.md) A Tâoist teacher.
See XXI, par. 9; XXXII, par. 1.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[227:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_230.md) A famous archer of
antiquity in the twenty-second century B.C., or perhaps earlier.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[228:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_231.md) 'Toeless' is a
sort of nickname. Shû-shan or Shû hill was, probably, where he
dwelt:--'Toeless of Shû hill.'

<span id="fn_215"></span>[229:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_232.md) 'Heaven' here is a
synonym of Tâo. Perhaps the meaning is 'unavoidable;' it is so in the
Tâoistic order of things.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[229:2](sbe39126.htm#fr_233.md) It was in the
sixteenth year of duke Âi that Confucius died. Âi was marquis of Lû from
B.C. 494 to 468.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[229:3](sbe39126.htm#fr_234.md) The account of
Âi-thâi Tho is of course Kwang-dze's own fabrication. Âi-thâi is
understood to be descriptive of his ugliness, and Tho to be his name.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[229:4](sbe39126.htm#fr_235.md) Perhaps this was
spoken by his wife before their marriage.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[230:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_236.md) One sees dimly the
applicability of this illustration to the case in hand. What made
Âi-thâi Tho so much esteemed was his mental power, quite independent of
his ugly person.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[231:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_237.md) See the Lî Kî
VIII, i, 7; but the applicability of these two illustrations is not so
clear.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[231:2](sbe39126.htm#fr_239.md) These two have
force as in 'reasoning from the less to the greater.' With the latter of
the two compare the mosaical provision in Deuteronomy xxiv. 5.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[231:3](sbe39126.htm#fr_241.md) 'Powers' are the
capacities of the nature,--the gift of the Tâo. 'Virtue' is the
realisation or carrying out of those capacities.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[232:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_242.md) Specially the
season of complacent enjoyment.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[232:2](sbe39126.htm#fr_243.md) So, in Lin
Hsî-kung; but the meaning has to be forced out of the text.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[232:3](sbe39126.htm#fr_244.md) The disciple Min
Sun or Min Dze-Khien.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[233:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_246.md) These two men are
undoubtedly inventions of Kwang-dze. They are brought before us, not by
surnames and names, but by their several deformities.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[233:2](sbe39126.htm#fr_247.md) The first of the
five presiding chiefs; marquis of Khî from B.C. 685 to 643.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[233:3](sbe39126.htm#fr_248.md) Lin Hsî-kung
wonders whether the story of the man who was so taken with the charms of
a one-eyed courtesan, that he thought other women all had an eye too
many, was taken from this!

<span id="fn_229"></span>[234:1](sbe39126.htm#fr_249.md) Lû Shû-kih
maintains here that 'the Tâo' and 'Heaven' have the same meaning; nor
does he make any distinction between mâo (<span id="img_23400"></span>
![](img/23400.jpg)), 'the personal appearance,' and hsing (<span
