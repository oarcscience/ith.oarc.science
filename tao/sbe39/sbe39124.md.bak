## BOOK III.

### PART I. SECTION III.

### Yang Shang Kû, or 'Nourishing the Lord of Life <span id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_131.md).'

1\. There is a limit to our life, but to knowledge there is no limit.
With what is limited to pursue after what is unlimited is a perilous
thing; and when, knowing this, we still seek the increase of our
knowledge, the peril cannot be averted <span
id="fr_140"></span>[2](#fn_132.md). There should not be the practice of
what is good with any thought of the fame (which it will bring), nor of
what is evil with any approximation to the punishment (which it will
incur) <span id="fr_141"></span>[3](#fn_133.md):--an accordance with the
Central Element (of our nature) <span id="fr_142"></span>[4](#fn_134.md) is
the regular way to preserve the body, to maintain the life, to nourish
our parents, and to complete our term of years.

2\. His cook <span id="fr_143"></span>[5](#fn_135.md) was cutting up an ox
for the ruler Wän-hui <span id="fr_144"></span>[5](#fn_135.md). Whenever he
applied his hand, leaned forward with his shoulder, planted his foot,
and employed

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

the pressure of his knee, in the audible ripping off of the skin, and
slicing operation of the knife, the sounds were all in regular cadence.
Movements and sounds proceeded as in the dance of 'the Mulberry
Forest <span id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_136.md)' and the blended notes of
'the King Shâu <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_136.md).' The ruler said,
'Ah! Admirable! That your art should have become so perfect!' (Having
finished his operation), the cook laid down his knife, and replied to
the remark, 'What your servant loves is the method of the Tâo, something
in advance of any art. When I first began to cut up an ox, I saw nothing
but the (entire) carcase. After three years I ceased to see it as a
whole. Now I deal with it in a spirit-like manner, and do not look at it
with my eyes. The use of my senses is discarded, and my spirit acts as
it wills. Observing the natural lines, (my knife) slips through the
great crevices and slides through the great cavities, taking advantage
of the facilities thus presented. My art avoids the membranous
ligatures, and much more the great bones.

'A good cook changes his knife every year;--(it may have been injured)
in cutting; an ordinary cook changes his every month;--(it may have
been) broken. Now my knife has been in use for nineteen years; it has
cut up several thousand oxen, and yet its edge is as sharp as if it had
newly come from the whetstone. There are the interstices of the joints,
and the edge of the knife has no (appreciable) thickness; when that
which is so thin enters where the interstice is, how easily it moves
along! The

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

blade has more than room enough. Nevertheless, whenever I come to a
complicated joint, and see that there will be some difficulty, I proceed
anxiously and with caution, not allowing my eyes to wander from the
place, and moving my hand slowly. Then by a very slight movement of the
knife, the part is quickly separated, and drops like (a clod of) earth
to the ground. Then standing up with the knife in my hand, I look all
round, and in a leisurely manner, with an air of satisfaction, wipe it
clean, and put it in its sheath.' The ruler Wän-hui said, 'Excellent! I
have heard the words of my cook, and learned from them the nourishment
of (our) life.'

3\. When Kung-wän Hsien <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_137.md) saw the
Master of the Left, he was startled, and said, 'What sort of man is
this? How is it he has but one foot? Is it from Heaven? or from Man?'
Then he added <span id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_138.md), 'It must be from
Heaven, and not from Man. Heaven's making of this man caused him to have
but one foot. In the person of man, each foot has its marrow. By this I
know that his peculiarity is from Heaven, and not from Man. A pheasant
of the marshes has to take ten steps to pick up a mouthful of food, and
thirty steps to get a drink, but it does not seek to be nourished in a
coop. Though its spirit would (there) enjoy a royal abundance, it does
not think (such confinement) good.'

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

4\. When Lâo Tan died <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_139.md), Khin
Shih <span id="fr_150"></span>[2](#fn_140.md) went to condole (with his
son), but after crying out three times, he came out. The disciples <span
id="fr_151"></span>[3](#fn_141.md) said to him, 'Were you not a friend of
the Master?' 'I was,' he replied, and they said, 'Is it proper then to
offer your condolences merely as you have done?' He said, 'It is. At
first I thought he was the man of men, and now I do not think so. When I
entered a little ago and expressed my condolences, there were the old
men wailing as if they had lost a son, and the young men wailing as if
they had lost their mother. In his attracting and uniting them to
himself in such a way there must have been that which made them
involuntarily express their words (of condolence), and involuntarily
wail, as they were doing. And this was a hiding from himself of his
Heaven (-nature), and an excessive indulgence of his (human)
feelings;--a forgetting of what he had received (in being born); what
the ancients called the punishment due to neglecting the Heaven
(-nature) <span id="fr_152"></span>[4](#fn_142.md). When the Master
came <span id="fr_153"></span>[5](#fn_143.md), it was at the proper time;
when he went away, it was the simple sequence (of his coming). Quiet
acquiescence in what happens at its proper time, and quietly submitting
(to its ceasing) afford no occasion for grief or for joy <span
id="fr_154"></span>[6](#fn_144). The ancients described (death.md) as the
loosening of the

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

cord on which God suspended (the life) <span
id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_145.md). What we can point to are the faggots
that have been consumed; but the fire is transmitted (elsewhere), and we
know not that it is over and ended <span
id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_146.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_131"></span>[198:1](sbe39124.htm#fr_139.md) See pp. 130, 131.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[198:2](sbe39124.htm#fr_140.md) Under what is said
about knowledge here there lies the objection of Tâoists to the
Confucian pursuit of knowledge as the means for the right conduct of
life, instead of the quiet simplicity and self-suppression of their own
system.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[198:3](sbe39124.htm#fr_141.md) This is the key to
the three paragraphs that follow. But the text of it is not easily
construed. The 'doing good' and the doing evil' are to be lightly
understood.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[198:4](sbe39124.htm#fr_142.md) A name for the
Tâo.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[198:5](sbe39124.htm#fr_144.md) 'The ruler
Wän-hui' is understood to be 'king Hui of Liang (or Wei),' with the
account of an interview between whom and Mencius the works of that
philosopher commence.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[199:1](sbe39124.htm#fr_146.md) Two pieces of
music, ascribed to Khäng Thang and Hwang-Tî.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[200:1](sbe39124.htm#fr_147.md) There was a family
in Wei with the double surname Kung-wän. This would be a scion of it.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[200:2](sbe39124.htm#fr_148.md) This is Hsien
still speaking. We have to understand his reasoning ad sensum and not ad
verbum. The master of the Left had done 'evil,' so as to incur the
punishment from which be suffered; and had shown himself less wise than
a pheasant.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[201:1](sbe39124.htm#fr_149.md) Then the account
that Lâo-dze went westwards, and that nothing is known as to where he
died, must be without foundation.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[201:2](sbe39124.htm#fr_150.md) Nothing more is
known of this person.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[201:3](sbe39124.htm#fr_151.md) Probably the
disciples of Lâo-dze.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[201:4](sbe39124.htm#fr_152.md) Lâo had gone to an
excess in his 'doing good,' as if he were seeking reputation.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[201:5](sbe39124.htm#fr_153.md) Into the world.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[201:6](sbe39124.htm#fr_154.md) See Kwang-dze's
remarks and demeanour on the death of his wife, in Book XVIII.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[202:1](sbe39124.htm#fr_155.md) This short
sentence is remarkable by the use of the character Tî (<span
id="img_20200"></span> ![](img/20200.jpg)) 'God,' in it, a usage here
ascribed to the ancients.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[202:2](sbe39124.htm#fr_156.md) The concluding
sentence might stand as a short paragraph by itself. The 'faggots' are
understood to represent the body, and the 'fire' the animating spirit.
The body perishes at death as the faggots are consumed by the fire. But
the fire may be transmitted to other faggots, and so the spirit may
migrate, and be existing elsewhere.
