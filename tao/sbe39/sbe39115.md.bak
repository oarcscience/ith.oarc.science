### BOOK XXVII. YÜ YEN.

Yü Yen, 'Metaphorical Words,' stand at the commencement of the Book, and
have been adopted as its name.

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

\[paragraph continues\] They might be employed to denote its first
paragraph, but are not applicable to the Book as a whole. Nor let the
reader expect to find even here any disquisition on the nature of the
metaphor as a figure of speech. Translated literally, 'Yü Yen' are
'Lodged Words,' that is, Ideas that receive their meaning or character
from their environment, the narrative or description in which they are
deposited.

Kwang-dze wished, I suppose, to give some description of the style in
which he himself wrote:--now metaphorical, now abounding in quotations,
and throughout moulded by his Tâoistic views. This last seems to be the
meaning of his Kih Yen,--literally, 'Cup, or Goblet, Words,' that is,
words, common as the water constantly supplied in the cup, but all
moulded by the Tâoist principle, the element of and from Heaven blended
in man's constitution and that should direct and guide his conduct. The
best help in the interpretation of the paragraph is derived from a study
of the difficult second Book, as suggested in the notes.

Of the five paragraphs that follow the first, the second relates to the
change of views, which, it is said, took place in Confucius; the third,
to the change of feeling in Zäng-dze in his poverty and prosperity; the
fourth, to changes of character produced in his disciple by the
teachings of Tung-kwo Dze-khî; the fifth, to the changes in the
appearance of the shadow produced by the ever-changing substance; and
the sixth, to the change of spirit and manner produced in Yang Kû by the
stern lesson of Lâo-dze.

Various other lessons, more or less appropriate and important, are
interspersed.

Some critics argue that this Book must have originally been one with the
thirty-second, which was made into two by the insertion between its
Parts of the four spurious intervening Books, but this is uncertain and
unlikely.
