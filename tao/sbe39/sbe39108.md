### BOOK XX. SHAN MÛ.

It requires a little effort to perceive that Shan Mû, the title of this
Book, does not belong to it as a whole, but only to the first of its
nine paragraphs. That speaks of a large tree which our author once saw
on a mountain. The other paragraphs have nothing to do with mountain
trees, large or small. As the last Book might be considered to be
supplementary to 'the Nourishment of Life,' discussed in Book III, so
this is taken as having the same relation to Book IV, which treats of
'Man in the World, associated with other men.' It shows by its various
narratives, some of which are full of interest, how by a strict
observance of the principles and lessons of the Tâo a man may preserve
his life and be happy, may do the right thing and enjoy himself and
obtain the approbation of others in the various circumstances in which
he may be placed. The themes both of Books I and IV blend together in
it. Paragraph 8 has more the character of an apologue than most of
Kwang-dze's stories.
