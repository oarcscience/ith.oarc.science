### 22.

22\. 1. The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty,
full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose
(desires) are many goes astray.

2\. Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility),
and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self-display, and
therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is
distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is
acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires
superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore
no one in the world is able to strive with him.

3\. That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was
not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it.

<span id="img_06500"></span> ![](img/06500.jpg), 'The Increase granted
to Humility.' This title rightly expresses the subject-matter of the
chapter. I cannot translate the first clause otherwise than I have done.
It was an old saying, which Lâo-dze found and adopted. Whether it was
intended to embrace all the cases which are mentioned may be questioned,
but he employs it so as to make it do so.

'The emptiness' which becomes full is literally the hollowness of a
cavity in the ground which is sure to be filled by overflowing
water;--see Mencius, IV, ii, 18. 'The worn out' is explained by the
withered foliage of a tree, which comes out new and fresh in the next
spring. I have taken the first sentence of par. 2 as Wû Khäng does;--see
his commentary in loc.
