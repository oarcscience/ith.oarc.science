### 79.

79\. 1. When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a
great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of
the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)?

2\. Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand
portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the
(speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the
attributes (of the Tâo) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement,
while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions
favourable to himself.

3\. In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always
on the side of the good man.

<span id="img_12100"></span> ![](img/12100.jpg), 'Adherence to Bond or
Covenant.' The chapter shows, but by no means clearly, how he who holds
fast to the Tâo will be better off in the end than he who will rather
try to secure his own interests.

Par. 1 presents us with a case which the statements of the chapter are
intended to meet:--two disputants, one good, and the other bad; the
latter, though apparently reconciled, still retaining a grudge, and
ready to wreak his dissatisfaction, when he has an opportunity. The
<span id="img_12101"></span> ![](img/12101.jpg) = 'for,' 'for the good
of.'

Par. 2 is intended to solve the question. The terms of a contract or
agreement were inscribed on a slip of wood, which was then divided into
two; each party having one half of it. At the settlement, if the halves
perfectly fitted to each other, it was carried through. The one who had
the right in the dispute has his part of the agreement, but does not
insist on it, and is forbearing; the other insists on the conditions
being even now altered in his favour. The

characters by which this last case is expressed, are very enigmatical,
having reference to the satisfaction of the government dues of Lâo-dze's
time,--a subject into which it would take much space to go.

Par. 3 decides the question by the action of Heaven, which is only
another name for the course of the Tâo.
