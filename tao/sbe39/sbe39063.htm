<P>56. 1. He who knows (the T&acirc;o) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it.</P>
<P>2. He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.'</P>
<P>3. (Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/10001.jpg">, 'The Mysterious Excellence.' The chapter gives us a picture of the man of T&acirc;o, humble and retiring, oblivious of himself and of other men, the noblest man under heaven.</P>
<P>Par. 1 is found in Kwang-dze (XIII, 20 b), not expressly mentioned, as taken from L&acirc;o-dze, but at the end of a string of sentiments, ascribed to 'the Master,' some of them, like the two clauses here, no doubt belonging to him, and the others, probably Kwang-dze's own.</P>
<P>Par. 2 is all found in chapters 4 and 52, excepting the short clause in the conclusion.</P>
