### 5.

5\. 1. Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be
benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt
with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal
with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with.

2\. May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows?

'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power;  
'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more.  
Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see;  
Your inner being guard, and keep it free.

<span id="img_05003"></span> ![](img/05003.jpg), 'The Use of Emptiness.'
Quiet and unceasing is the operation of the Tâo, and effective is the
rule of the sage in accordance with it.

The grass-dogs in par. 1 were made of straw tied up in the shape of
dogs, and used in praying for rain; and afterwards,

when the sacrifice was over, were thrown aside and left uncared for.
Heaven and earth and the sages dealt so with all things and with the
people; but the illustration does not seem a happy one. Both Kwang-dze
and Hwâi-nan mention the grass-dogs. See especially the former, XIV, 25
a, b. In that Book there is fully developed the meaning of this chapter.
The illustration in par. 2 is better. The Chinese bellows is different
to look at from ours, but the principle is the same in the construction
of both. The par. concludes in a way that lends some countenance to the
later Tâoism's dealing with the breath.
