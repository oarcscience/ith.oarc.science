<P>70. 1. My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them.</P>
<P>2. There is an originating and all-comprehending</P>

<P>(principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/11300.jpg">, 'The Difficulty of being (rightly) Known.' The T&acirc;o comprehends and rules all L&acirc;o-dze's teaching, as the members of a clan were all in the loins of their first father (<A NAME="img_11301"></A>

L&acirc;o-dze's principle and rule or ruler was the T&acirc;o. His utterance here is very important. Compare the words of Confucius in the Analects, XIV, ch. 37, et al.</P>
<P>Par. 2 is twice quoted by Hw&acirc;i-nan, though his text is not quite the same in both cases.</P>
