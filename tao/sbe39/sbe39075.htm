<P>68. He who in (T&acirc;o's) wars has skill<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumes no martial port;<BR>
He who fights with most good will<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rage makes no resort.<BR>
He who vanquishes yet still<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps from his foes apart;<BR>
He whose hests men most fulfil<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet humbly plies his art.<BR>
Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therein is his might.'<BR>
Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they with him unite.'<BR>
Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sage of old more bright.'</P></DIR>
