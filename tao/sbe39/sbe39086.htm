<P>79. 1. When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)?</P>
<P>2. Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the T&acirc;o) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself.</P>

The one who had the right in the dispute has his part of the agreement, but does not insist on it, and is forbearing; the other insists on the conditions being even now altered in his favour.

<P>characters by which this last case is expressed, are very enigmatical, having reference to the satisfaction of the government dues of L&acirc;o-dze's time,--a subject into which it would take much space to go.</P>
