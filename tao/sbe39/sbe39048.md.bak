### 41.

41\. 1. Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tâo,
earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when
they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it.
Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh
greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to
be the Tâo.

2\. Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:--

'The Tâo, when brightest seen, seems light to lack;  
Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back;  
Its even way is like a rugged track.  
Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise;  
Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes  
And he has most whose lot the least supplies.  
Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low;  
Its solid truth seems change to undergo;  
Its largest square doth yet no corner show  
A vessel great, it is the slowest made; <span id="page_85">p.
85</span>  
Loud is its sound, but never word it said;  
A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.'

3\. The Tâo is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tâo which is
skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them
complete.

<span id="img_08500"></span> ![](img/08500.jpg), 'Sameness and
Difference.' The chapter is a sequel of the preceding, and may be taken
as an illustration of the Tâo's proceeding by contraries.

Who the sentence-makers were whose sayings are quoted we cannot tell,
but it would have been strange if Lâo-dze had not had a large store of
such sentences at his command. The fifth and sixth of those employed by
him here are found in Lieh-dze (II, 15 a), spoken by Lâo in reproving
Yang Kû, and in VII, 3 a, that heretic appears quoting an utterance of
the same kind, with the words,' according to an old saying (<span
id="img_08501"></span> ![](img/08501.jpg))'.
