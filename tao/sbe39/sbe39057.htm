<P>50. 1. Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die.</P>
<P>2. Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death.</P>
<P>3. There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death. And for what reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life.</P>
<P>4. But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or</P>
<P><A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A></P>
<P>tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death.</P>
<P><A NAME="img_09300"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09300.jpg">, 'The Value set on Life.' The chapter sets forth the T&acirc;o as an antidote against decay and death.</P>
<P>In par. 1 life is presented to us as intermediate between two non-existences. The words will suggest to many readers those in Job i. 21.</P>
<P>In pars. 2 and 3 I translate the characters <A NAME="img_09301"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09301.jpg"> by 'three in ten,' instead of by 'thirteen,' as Julien and other translators have done. The characters are susceptible of either translation according to the tone in which we read the <A NAME="img_09302"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09302.jpg">. They were construed as I have done by Wang P&icirc;; and many of the best commentators have followed in his wake. 'The ministers of life to themselves' would be those who eschewed all things, both internal and external, tending to injure health; 'the ministers of death,' those who pursued courses likely to cause disease and shorten life; the third three would be those who thought that by mysterious and abnormal courses they could prolong life, but only injured it. Those three classes being thus disposed of, there remains only one in ten rightly using the T&acirc;o, and he is spoken of in the next paragraph.</P>
<P>This par. 4 is easy of translation, and the various readings in it are unimportant, differing in this respect from those in par. 3. But the aim of the author in it is not clear. In ascribing such effects to the possession of the T&acirc;o, is he 'trifling,' as Dr. Chalmers thinks? or indulging the play of his poetical fancy? or simply saying that the T&acirc;oist will keep himself out of danger?</P>
