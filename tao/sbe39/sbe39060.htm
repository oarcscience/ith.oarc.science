<P>53. 1. If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct (a government) according to the Great T&acirc;o, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display.</P>
<P>2. The great T&acirc;o (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways.</P>
<P>3. Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and</P>

<P>ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the T&acirc;o surely!</P>

<P>In the 'I' of paragraph 1 does L&acirc;o-dze speak of himself? I think he does. W&ucirc; Kh&auml;ng understands it of 'any man,' i. e. any one in the exercise of government;--which is possible. What is peculiar to my version is the pregnant meaning given to <A NAME="img_09701"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09701.jpg">, common enough in the mouth of Confucius. I have adopted it here because of a passage in Li&ucirc; Hsiang's Shwo-w&auml;n (XX, 13 b), where L&acirc;o-dze is made to say 'Excessive is the difficulty of practising the T&acirc;o at the present time,' adding that the princes of his age would not receive it from him. On the 'Great T&acirc;o,' see chapters 25, 34, et al. From the twentieth book of Han Fei (12 b and 13 a) I conclude that he had the whole of this chapter in his copy of our King, but he broke it up, after his fashion, into fragmentary utterances, confused and confounding. He gives also some remarkable various readings, one of which (<A NAME="img_09702"></A>
