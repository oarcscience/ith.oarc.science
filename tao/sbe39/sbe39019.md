### 12.

12\. 1. Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take;  
Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make;  
The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste;  
The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste  
Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange,  
Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change.

2\. Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and
not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter,
and prefers to seek the former.

<span id="img_05501"></span> ![](img/05501.jpg), 'The Repression of the
Desires.' Government in accordance with the Tâo seeks to withdraw men
from the attractions of what is external and pleasant to the senses and
imagination, and to maintain the primitive simplicity of men's ways and
manners. Compare chap. 2. The five colours are Black, Red, Green or
Blue, White, and Yellow; the five notes are those of the imperfect
Chinese musical scale, our G, A, B, D, E; the five tastes are Salt,
Bitter, Sour, Acrid, and Sweet.

I am not sure that Wang Pî has caught exactly the author's idea in the
contrast between satisfying the belly and satisfying the eyes; but what
he says is ingenious, 'In satisfying the belly

one nourishes himself; in gratifying the eyes he makes a slave of
himself.'
