### 26.

26\. 1. Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of
movement.

2\. Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far
from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to
look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them.
How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before
the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); if
he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne.

<span id="img_06900"></span> ![](img/06900.jpg), 'The Quality of
Gravity.' Gravity and stillness are both attributes of the Tâo; and he
who cultivates it must not give way to lightness of mind, or hasty
action.

The rule for a leader not to separate from his baggage waggons is simply
the necessity of adhering to gravity. I have adopted from Han Fei the
reading of 'the wise prince' for 'the sage,' which is found in Ho-shang
Kung; and later on the reading of 'has lost his root' for his 'loses his
ministers,' though the latter is found also in Han Fei.
