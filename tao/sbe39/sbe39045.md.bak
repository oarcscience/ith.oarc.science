## PART II.

### 38.

38\. 1. (Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the
Tâo) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in
fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those
attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not
possess them (in fullest measure).

2\. (Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did
nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who)
possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be
so doing.

3\. (Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking)
to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who) possessed
the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had
need to be so doing.

4\. (Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always
seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the
arm and marched up to them.

5\. Thus it was that when the Tâo was lost, its attributes appeared;
when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence
was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the
proprieties appeared.

6\. Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good
faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

(only) a flower of the Tâo, and is the beginning of stupidity.

7\. Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews
what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is
thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other.

<span id="img_08100"></span> ![](img/08100.jpg), 'About the Attributes;'
of Tâo, that is. It is not easy to render teh here by any other English
term than 'virtue,' and yet there would be a danger of its thus
misleading us in the interpretation of the chapter.

The 'virtue' is the activity or operation of the Tâo, which is supposed
to have come out of its absoluteness. Even Han Fei so defines it
here,--'Teh is the meritorious work of the Tâo.'

In par. 5 we evidently have a résumé of the preceding paragraphs, and,
as it is historical, I translate them in the past tense; though what
took place on the early stage of the world may also be said to go on
taking place in the experience of every individual. With some
considerable hesitation I have given the subjects in those paragraphs in
the concrete, in deference to the authority of Ho-shang Kung and most
other commentators. The former says, 'By "the highest teh" is to be
understood the rulers of the greatest antiquity, without name or
designation, whose virtue was great, and could not be surpassed.' Most
ingenious, and in accordance with the Tâoistic system, is the manner in
which Wû Khäng construes the passage, and I am surprised that it has not
been generally accepted. By 'the higher teh' he understands 'the Tâo,'
that which is prior to and above the Teh (<span id="img_08101"></span>
![](img/08101.jpg)) by 'the lower teh,' benevolence, that which is after
and below the Teh; by 'the higher benevolence,' the Teh which is above
benevolence; by 'the higher righteousness,' the benevolence which is
above righteousness; and by 'the higher propriety,' the righteousness
which is above propriety. Certainly in the summation of these four
paragraphs which we have in the fifth, the

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

subjects of them would appear to have been in the mind of Lâo-dze as
thus defined by Wû.

In the remainder of the chapter he goes on to speak depreciatingly of
ceremonies and knowledge, so that the whole chapter must be understood
as descriptive of the process of decay and deterioration from the early
time in which the Tâo and its attributes swayed the societies of men.
