### BOOK XXVIII. ZANG WANG.

Zang Wang, explaining the characters as I have done,

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

fairly indicates the subject-matter of the Book. Not that we have a king
in every illustration, but the personages adduced are always men of
worth, who decline the throne, or gift, or distinction of whatever
nature, proffered to them, and feel that they have something better to
live for.

A persuasion, however, is widely spread, that this Book and the three
that follow are all spurious. The first critic of note to challenge
their genuineness was Sû Shih (better known as Sû Tung-pho, A. D.
1046-1101); and now, some of the best editors, such as Lin Hsî-kung, do
not admit them into their texts, while others who are not bold enough to
exclude them altogether, do not think it worth their while to discuss
them seriously. Hû Wän-ying, for instance, says, 'Their style is poor
and mean, and they are, without doubt, forgeries. I will not therefore
trouble myself with comments of praise or blame upon them. The reader
may accept or reject them at his pleasure.'

But something may be said for them. Sze-mâ Khien seems to have been
acquainted with them all. In his short biographical notice of Kwang-dze,
he says, 'He made the Old Fisherman, the Robber Kih, and the Cutting
Open Satchels, to defame and calumniate the disciples of Confucius.'
Khien does not indeed mention our present Book along with XXX and XXXI,
but it is less open to objection on the ground he mentions than they
are. I think if it had stood alone, it would not have been condemned.
