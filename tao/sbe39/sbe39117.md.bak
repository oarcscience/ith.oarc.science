### BOOK XXIX. TÂO KIH.

It has been seen above that Sze-mâ Khien expressly ascribes the Book
called 'the Robber Kih' to Kwang-dze. Khien refers also in another place
to Kih, adducing the facts of his history in contrast with those about
Confucius' favourite disciple Yen Hui as inexplicable on the supposition
of a just and wise Providence. We must conclude therefore that the Book
existed in Khien's time, and that he had read it. On the other hand it
has been shown that Confucius could not have been on terms

of friendship with Liû-hsiâ Kî, and all that is related of his brother
the robber wants substantiation. That such a man ever existed appears to
me very doubtful. Are we to put down the whole of the first paragraph
then as a jeu d'esprit on the part of Kwang-dze, intended to throw
ridicule on Confucius and what our author considered his pedantic ways?
It certainly does so, and we are amused to hear the sage outcrowed by
the robber.

In the other two paragraphs we have good instances of Kwang-dze's
'metaphorical expressions,' his coinage of names for his personages,
more or less ingeniously indicating their characters; but in such cases
the element of time or chronology does not enter; and it is the
anachronism of the first paragraph which constitutes its chief
difficulty.

The name of 'Robber Kih' may be said to be a coinage; and that a famous
robber was popularly indicated by the name appears from its use by
Mencius (III, ii, ch. 10, 3), to explain which the commentators have
invented the story of a robber so-called in the time of Hwang-Tî, in the
twenty-seventh century B. C.! Was there really such a legend? and did
Kwang-dze take advantage of it to apply the name to a notorious and
disreputable brother of Liû-hsiâ Kî? Still there remain the anachronisms
in the paragraph which have been pointed out. On the whole we must come
to a conclusion rather unfavourable to the genuineness of the Book. But
it must have been forged at a very early time, and we have no idea by
whom.
