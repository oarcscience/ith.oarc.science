## BOOK XIII.

### PART II. SECTION VI.

### Thien Tâo, or 'The Way of Heaven <span id="fr_519"></span>[1](#fn_471.md).'

1\. The Way of Heaven operates (unceasingly), and leaves no
accumulation <span id="fr_520"></span>[2](#fn_472) (of its influence.md) in
any particular place, so that all things are brought to perfection by
it; so does the Way of the Tîs operate, and all under the sky turn to
them (as their directors); so also does the Way of the Sages operate,
and all within the seas submit to them. Those who clearly understand
(the Way of) Heaven, who are in sympathy with (that of) the sages, and
familiar through the universe and in the four quarters (of the earth)
with the work of the Tîs and the kings, yet act spontaneously from
themselves:--with the appearance of being ignorant they are yet entirely
still.

The stillness of the sages does not belong to them as a consequence of
their skilful ability <span id="fr_521"></span>[3](#fn_473.md); all things
are not able to disturb their minds;--it is on this account that they
are still. When water is still, its clearness shows the beard and
eyebrows (of him

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

who looks into it). It is a perfect Level <span
id="fr_522"></span>[1](#fn_474.md), and the greatest artificer takes his
rule from it. Such is the clearness of still water, and how much greater
is that of the human Spirit! The still mind of the sage is the mirror of
heaven and earth, the glass of all things.

Vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and
non-action;--this is the Level of heaven and earth, and the perfection
of the Tâo and its characteristics <span
id="fr_523"></span>[2](#fn_475.md). Therefore the Tîs, Kings, and Sages
found in this their resting-place <span id="fr_524"></span>[3](#fn_476.md).
Resting here, they were vacant; from their vacancy came fullness; from
their fullness came the nice distinctions (of things). From their
vacancy came stillness; that stillness was followed by movement; their
movements were successful. From their stillness came their non-action.
Doing-nothing, they devolved the cares of office on their employés.
Doing-nothing was accompanied by the feeling of satisfaction. Where
there is that feeling of satisfaction, anxieties and troubles find no
place; and the years of life are many.

Vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and
doing-nothing are the root of all things. When this is understood, we
find such a ruler on the throne as Yâo, and such a minister as Shun.
When with this a high position is occupied, we find the attributes of
the Tîs and kings,--the sons of Heaven; with this in a low position, we
find the mysterious

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

sages, the uncrowned kings, with their ways. With this retiring (from
public life), and enjoying themselves at leisure, we find the scholars
who dwell by the rivers and seas, among the hills and forests, all
submissive to it; with this coming forward to active life and comforting
their age, their merit is great, and their fame is distinguished;--and
all the world becomes united in one.

2\. (Such men) by their stillness become sages and by their movement,
kings. Doing-nothing, they are honoured; in their plain simplicity, no
one in the world can strive with them (for the palm of) excellence. The
clear understanding of the virtue of Heaven and Earth is what is called
'The Great Root,' and 'The Great Origin;'--they who have it are in
harmony with Heaven, and so they produce all equable arrangements in the
world;--they are those who are in harmony with men. Being in harmony
with men is called the joy of men; being in harmony with Heaven is
called the joy of Heaven. Kwang-dze said, 'My Master! my Master! He
shall hash and blend all things in mass without being cruel; he shall
dispense his favours to all ages without being benevolent. He is older
than the highest antiquity, and yet is not old. He overspreads the
heavens and sustains the earth; from him is the carving of all forms
without any artful skill <span id="fr_525"></span>[1](#fn_477.md)! This is
what is called the Joy of Heaven. Hence it is said, "Those who know the
Joy of Heaven during their life, act like Heaven, and at death undergo
transformation like (other) things <span
id="fr_526"></span>[2](#fn_478.md); in their stillness

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

they possess the quality of the Yin, and in their movement they flow
abroad as the Yang. Therefore he who knows the joy of Heaven has no
murmuring against Heaven, nor any fault-finding with men; and suffers no
embarrassment from things, nor any reproof from ghosts. Hence it is
said, His movements are those of Heaven; his stillness is that of Earth;
his whole mind is fixed, and he rules over the world. The spirits of his
dead do not come to scare him; he is not worn out by their souls. His
words proceeding from his vacancy and stillness, yet reach to heaven and
earth, and show a communication with all things:--this is what is called
the joy of Heaven. This joy of Heaven forms the mind of the sage whereby
he nurtures all under the sky <span id="fr_527"></span>[1](#fn_479.md).'"'

3\. It was the Way <span id="fr_528"></span>[2](#fn_480.md) of the Tîs and
Kings to regard Heaven and Earth as their Author, the Tâo and its
characteristics as their Lord, and Doing-nothing as their constant rule.
Doing-nothing, they could use the whole world in their service and might
have done more; acting, they were not sufficient for the service
required of them by the world. Hence the men of old held non-inaction in
honour. When superiors do nothing and their inferiors also do nothing,
inferiors and superiors possess the same virtue; and when inferiors and
superiors possess the same virtue, there are none to act as ministers.
When inferiors act, and their superiors also act, then superiors and
inferiors possess the same Tâo; and when superiors and inferiors possess
the same

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Tâo, there is none to preside as Lord. But that
the superiors do nothing and yet thereby use the world in their service,
and that the inferiors, while acting, be employed in the service of the
world, is an unchangeable principle. Therefore the ancient kings who
presided over the world, though their knowledge embraced (all the
operations of) Heaven and Earth, took no thought of their own about
them; though their nice discrimination appreciated the fine fashioning
of all things, they said not a word about it; though their power
comprehended all within the seas, they did nothing themselves. Heaven
produces nothing, yet all things experience their transformations; Earth
effects no growth, yet all things receive their nurture; the Tîs and
Kings did nothing, yet all the world testified their effective services.
Hence it is said, 'There is nothing more spirit-like than Heaven; there
is nothing richer than Earth; there are none greater than the Tî s and
Kings.' Hence it is said (further), 'The attributes of the Tîs and kings
corresponded to those of Heaven and Earth.' It was thus that they
availed themselves of (the operations of) Heaven and Earth, carried all
things on unceasingly (in their courses), and employed the various
classes of men in their service.

4\. Originating belongs to those in the higher position; details (of
work) to those who are in the lower. The compendious decision belongs to
the lord; the minutiae of execution, to his ministers. The direction of
the three hosts <span id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_481.md) and their men with
the five weapons <span id="fr_530"></span>[2](#fn_482.md) is but a trifling
quality; rewards

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

and penalties with their advantages and sufferings, and the inflictions
of the five punishments <span id="fr_531"></span>[1](#fn_483.md) are but
trivial elements of instruction; ceremonies, laws, measures, and
numbers, with all the minutiae of jurisprudence <span
id="fr_532"></span>[2](#fn_484.md), are small matters in government; the
notes of bells and drums, and the display of plumes and flags are the
slightest things in music, and the various grades of the mourning
garments are the most unimportant manifestations of grief. These five
unimportant adjuncts required the operation of the excited spirit and
the employment of the arts of the mind, to bring them into use. The men
of old had them indeed, but they did not give them the first place.

The ruler precedes, and the minister follows; the father precedes, and
the son follows; the elder brother precedes, and the younger follows;
the senior precedes, and the junior follows; the male precedes, and the
female follows; the husband precedes, and the wife follows.

This precedence of the more honourable and sequence of the meaner is
seen in the (relative) action of heaven and earth, and hence the sages
took them as their pattern. The more honourable position of heaven and
the lower one of earth are equivalent to a designation of their
spirit-like and intelligent qualities. The precedence of spring and
summer and the sequence of autumn and winter mark the

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

order of the four seasons. In the transformations and growth of all
things, every bud and feature has its proper form; and in this we have
their gradual maturing and decay, the constant flow of transformation
and change. Thus since Heaven and Earth, which are most spirit-like, are
distinguished as more honourable and less, and by precedence and
sequence, how much more must we look for this in the ways of men! In the
ancestral temple it is to kinship that honour is given; in court, to
rank; in the neighbourhoods and districts, to age; in the conduct of
affairs, to wisdom; such is the order in those great ways. If we speak
of the course (to be pursued in them), and do not observe their order,
we violate their course. If we speak of the course, and do not observe
it, why do we apply that name to it?

5\. Therefore the ancients who clearly understood the great Tâo first
sought to apprehend what was meant by Heaven <span
id="fr_533"></span>[1](#fn_485.md), and the Tâo and its characteristics
came next. When this was apprehended, then came Benevolence and
Righteousness. When these were apprehended, then came the Distinction of
duties and the observance of them. This accomplished, there came objects
and their names. After objects and their names, came the employment of
men according to their qualities: on this there followed the examination
of the men and of their work. This led to the approval or disapproval of
them, which again was succeeded by the apportioning of rewards and
penalties. After this the stupid and the intelligent understood what was
required of them, and the honourable and the mean occupied their several
positions.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

The good and the able, and those inferior to them, sincerely did their
best. Their ability was distributed; the duties implied in their
official names were fulfilled. In this way did they serve their
superiors, nourish their inferiors, regulate things, and cultivate their
persons. They did not call their knowledge and schemes into requisition;
they were required to fall back upon (the method of) Heaven:--this was
what is called the Perfection of the Rule of Great Peace. Hence it is
said in the Book <span id="fr_534"></span>[1](#fn_486.md), 'There are
objects and there are their names.' Objects and their names the ancients
had; but they did not put them in the foremost place.

When the ancients spoke of the Great Tâo, it was only after four other
steps that they gave a place to 'Objects and their Names,' and after
eight steps that they gave a place to 'Rewards and Penalties.' If they
had all at once spoken of 'Objects and their Names,' they would have
shown an ignorance of what is the Root (of government); if they had all
at once spoken of 'Rewards and Penalties,' they would have shown an
ignorance of the first steps of it. Those whose words are thus an
inversion of the (proper) course, or in opposition to it, are (only fit
to be) ruled by others;-how can they rule others? To speak all at once
of 'Objects and their Names,' and of 'Rewards and Penalties,' only shows
that the speaker knows the instruments of government, but does not know
the method of it, is fit to be used as an instrument in the world, but
not fit to use others as his instruments:--he is what we call a mere
sophist, a man of one small idea.

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

Ceremonies, laws, numbers, measures, with all the minutiae of
jurisprudence, the ancients had; but it is by these that inferiors serve
their superiors; it is not by them that those superiors nourish the
world.

6\. Anciently, Shun asked Yâo, saying, 'In what way does your Majesty by
the Grace of Heaven <span id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_487.md) exercise your
mind?' The reply was, 'I simply show no arrogance towards the helpless;
I do not neglect the poor people; I grieve for those who die; I love
their infant children; and I compassionate their widows.' Shun rejoined,
'Admirable, as far as it goes; but it is not what is Great.' How then,'
asked Yâo, 'do you think I should do?' Shun replied, 'When (a sovereign)
possesses the virtue of Heaven, then when he shows himself in action, it
is in stillness. The sun and moon (simply) shine, and the four seasons
pursue their courses. So it is with the regular phenomena of day and
night, and with the movement of the clouds by which the rain is
distributed.' Yâo said, 'Then I have only been persistently troubling
myself! What you wish is to be in harmony with Heaven, while I wish to
be in harmony with men.' Now (the Way of) Heaven and Earth was much
thought of of old, and Hwang-Tî, Yâo, and Shun united in admiring it.
Hence the kings of the world of old did nothing, but tried to imitate
that Way.

7\. Confucius went to the west to deposit (some) writings in the library
of Kâu <span id="fr_536"></span>[2](#fn_488.md), when Dze-lû counselled

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

him, saying, 'I have heard that the officer in charge of this Käng <span
id="fr_537"></span>[1](#fn_489.md) Repository of Kâu was one Lâo Tan, who
has given up his office, and is living in his own house. As you, Master,
wish to deposit these writings here, why not go to him, and obtain his
help (to accomplish your object) <span id="fr_538"></span>[2](#fn_490.md).'
Confucius said, 'Good;' and he went and saw Lâo Tan, who refused his
assistance. On this he proceeded to give an abstract of the Twelve
Classics <span id="fr_539"></span>[3](#fn_491.md) to bring the other over
to his views <span id="fr_540"></span>[4](#fn_492.md). Lâo Tan, however,
interrupted him while he was speaking, and said, 'This is too vague; let
me hear the substance of them in brief'. Confucius said, 'The substance
of them is occupied with Benevolence and Righteousness.' The other said,
'Let me ask whether you consider Benevolence and Righteousness to
constitute the nature of man?' 'I do,' was the answer. 'If the superior
man be not benevolent, he will not fulfil his character; if he be not
righteous, he might as well not have been born. Benevolence and
Righteousness are truly the nature of man.' Lâo Tan continued, 'Let me
ask you what you mean by Benevolence and Righteousness.' Confucius said,
'To be in one's inmost heart in kindly sympathy

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

with all things; to love all men; and to allow no selfish
thoughts;--this is the nature of Benevolence and Righteousness.' Lâo Tan
exclaimed, 'Ah! you almost show your inferiority by such words! "To love
all men!" is not that vague and extravagant? "To be seeking to allow no
selfish thoughts!"--that is selfishness <span
id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_493.md)! If you, Master, wish men not to be
without their (proper) shepherding, think of Heaven and Earth, which
certainly pursue their invariable course; think of the sun and moon,
which surely maintain their brightness; think of the stars in the
zodiac, which preserve their order and courses; think of birds and
beasts, which do not fail to collect together in their flocks and herds;
and think of the trees, which do not fail to stand up (in their places).
Do you, Master, imitate this way and carry it into practice; hurry on,
following this course, and you will reach your end. Why must you further
be vehement in putting forward your Benevolence and Righteousness, as if
you were beating a drum, and seeking a fugitive son, (only making him
run away the more)? Ah! Master, you are introducing disorder into the
nature of man!'

8\. Shih-khäng Khî <span id="fr_542"></span>[2](#fn_494.md), having an
interview with Lâo-dze, asked him, saying, 'I heard, Master, that you
were a sage, and I came here, wishing to see you, without grudging the
length of the journey. During the stages of the hundred days, the soles
of my feet became quite callous, but I did not dare to stop and rest.
Now I perceive that you are not

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

a sage. Because there was some rice left about the holes of the rats,
you sent away your younger sister, which was unkind; when your food,
whether raw or cooked, remains before you not all consumed, you keep on
hoarding it up to any extent <span id="fr_543"></span>[1](#fn_495.md).'
Lâo-dze looked indifferent, and gave him no answer.

Next day Khî again saw Lao-dze, and said, 'Yesterday I taunted you; but
to-day I have gone back to a better mood of mind. What is the cause (of
the change) <span id="fr_544"></span>[2](#fn_496.md)?' Lâo-dze replied, 'I
consider that I have freed myself from the trammels of claiming to be
artfully knowing, spirit-like, and sage. Yesterday if you had called me
an ox, you might have done so; or if you had called me a horse, you
might have done so <span id="fr_545"></span>[3](#fn_497.md). If there be a
reality (corresponding to men's ideas), and men give it a name, which
another will not receive, he will in the sequel suffer the more. My
manner was what I constantly observe;--I did not put it on for the
occasion.'

Shih-khäng Khî sidled away out of Lâo's shadow; then he retraced his
steps, advanced forward, and asked how he should cultivate himself. The
reply was, 'Your demeanour is repelling; you stare with your eyes; your
forehead is broad and yet tapering; you bark and growl with your mouth;
your appearance is severe and pretentious; you are like a horse held by
its tether, you would move, but are restrained, and (if let go) would
start off like an

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

arrow from a bow; you examine all the minutiae of a thing; your wisdom
is artful, and yet you try to look at ease. All these are to be
considered proofs of your want of sincerity. If on the borders one were
to be found with them, he would be named a Thief.'

9\. The Master <span id="fr_546"></span>[1](#fn_498.md) said, 'The Tâo does
not exhaust itself in what is greatest, nor is it ever absent from what
is least; and therefore it is to be found complete and diffused in all
things. How wide is its universal comprehension! How deep is its
unfathomableness! The embodiment of its attributes in benevolence and
righteousness is but a small result of its spirit-like (working); but it
is only the perfect man who can determine this. The perfect man has (the
charge of) the world;--is not the charge great? and yet it is not
sufficient to embarrass him. He wields the handle of power over the
whole world, and yet it is nothing to him. His discrimination detects
everything false, and no consideration of gain moves him. He penetrates
to the truth of things, and can guard that which is fundamental. So it
is that heaven and earth are external to him, and he views all things
with indifference, and his spirit is never straitened by them. He has
comprehended the Tho, and is in harmony with its characteristics; he
pushes back benevolence and righteousness (into their proper place), and
deals with ceremonies and music as (simply) guests:--yes, the mind of
the perfect man determines all things aright.'

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

10\. What the world thinks the most valuable exhibition of the Tâo is to
be found in books. But books are only a collection of words. Words have
what is valuable in them;--what is valuable in words is the ideas they
convey. But those ideas are a sequence of something else;--and what that
something else is cannot be conveyed by words. When the world, because
of the value which it attaches to words, commits them to books, that for
which it so values them may not deserve to be valued;--because that
which it values is not what is really valuable.

Thus it is that what we look at and can see is (only) the outward form
and colour, and what we listen to and can hear is (only) names and
sounds. Alas! that men of the world should think that form and colour,
name and sound, should be sufficient to give them the real nature of the
Tâo. The form and colour, the name and sound, are certainly not
sufficient to convey its real nature; and so it is that 'the wise do not
speak and those who do speak are not wise.' How should the world know
that real nature?

Duke Hwan <span id="fr_547"></span>[1](#fn_499.md), seated above in his
hall, was (once) reading a book, and the wheelwright Phien was making a
wheel below it <span id="fr_548"></span>[2](#fn_500.md). Laying aside his
hammer and chisel, Phien went up the steps, and said, 'I venture to ask
your Grace what words you are reading?' The duke said, 'The words of the
sages.' 'Are those sages alive?' Phien continued.

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

'They are dead,' was the reply. 'Then,' said the other, 'what you, my
Ruler, are reading are only the dregs and sediments of those old men.'
The duke said, 'How should you, a wheelwright, have anything to say
about the book which I am reading? If you can explain yourself, very
well; if you cannot, you shall die!' The wheelwright said, 'Your servant
will look at the thing from the point of view of his own art. In making
a wheel, if I proceed gently, that is pleasant enough, but the
workmanship is not strong; if I proceed violently, that is toilsome and
the joinings do not fit. If the movements of my hand are neither (too)
gentle nor (too) violent, the idea in my mind is realised. But I cannot
tell (how to do this) by word of mouth; there is a knack in it. I cannot
teach the knack to my son, nor can my son learn it from me. Thus it is
that I am in my seventieth year, and am (still) making wheels in my old
age <span id="fr_549"></span>[1](#fn_501.md). But these ancients, and what
it was not possible for them to Convey, are dead and gone:--so then what
you, my Ruler, are reading is but their dregs and sediments!'

<span id="fn_475"></span>[331:2](sbe39134.htm#fr_523.md) Such are the
natural characteristics of the Tâoistic mind.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[331:3](sbe39134.htm#fr_524.md) Implying cessation
from all thought and purpose.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[332:1](sbe39134.htm#fr_525.md) Compare in Bk. VI,
pars. 13 and 7.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[332:2](sbe39134.htm#fr_526.md) They do not cease
to be, but only become transformed or changed.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[333:1](sbe39134.htm#fr_527.md) I suppose that
from 'It is said' to this is all quotation, but from what book we do not
know.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[333:2](sbe39134.htm#fr_528.md) 'The virtue,' or
attribute; = the way.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[334:1](sbe39134.htm#fr_529.md) 'Three hosts'
constituted the military force of one of the largest states.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[334:2](sbe39134.htm#fr_530.md) The bow, the club,

Bk. XXXII.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[335:1](sbe39134.htm#fr_531.md) Branding, cutting

![](img/33502.jpg).

<span id="fn_485"></span>[336:1](sbe39134.htm#fr_533.md) The meaning,
probably, is 'spontaneity.'

<span id="fn_486"></span>[337:1](sbe39134.htm#fr_534.md) We cannot tell
what book or books.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[338:1](sbe39134.htm#fr_535.md) So, in the 'Spring
and Autumn' Chronicle, the rightful reigning sovereign is ordinarily
designated, 'Heaven's King.' It is not a Tâoistic mode of speaking of
him.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[338:2](sbe39134.htm#fr_536.md) It is supposed
that Confucius, disappointed by his want of <span id="page_339">p.
339</span> success, wished to deposit the writings or books which he
prized so much in the Royal Library, that they might not be lost, and be
available for some future teacher, more fortunate than himself.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[339:1](sbe39134.htm#fr_537.md) The name of the
Royal Library (<span id="img_33900"></span> ![](img/33900.jpg));
meaning, perhaps, 'Approved.'

<span id="fn_490"></span>[339:2](sbe39134.htm#fr_538.md) That is, help him
to get his books deposited in the Library.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[339:3](sbe39134.htm#fr_539.md) Meaning, perhaps,
the 'Spring and Autumn,' containing a chronicle of twelve marquises of
Lû. We know of no collection in the time of Confucius which could be
styled the 'Twelve Classics.'

<span id="fn_492"></span>[339:4](sbe39134.htm#fr_540.md) <span
id="img_33901"></span> ![](img/33901.jpg) is to be read shui.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[340:1](sbe39134.htm#fr_541.md) The unselfishness
