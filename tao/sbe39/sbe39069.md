### 62.

62\. 1. Tâo has of all things the most honoured place.

No treasures give good men so rich a grace; Bad men it guards, and doth
their ill efface.

2\. (Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds can
raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not
abandoned by it.

3\. Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of
Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a
prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both
the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the
court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this
Tâo, which one might present on his knees.

4\. Why was it that the ancients prized this Tâo

so much? Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the
guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the
reason why all under heaven consider it the most valuable thing.

<span id="img_10600"></span> ![](img/10600.jpg), 'Practising the Tâo.'
<span id="img_10601"></span> ![](img/10601.jpg), 'The value set on the
Tâo,' would have been a more appropriate title. The chapter sets forth
that value in various manifestations of it.

Par. 1. For the meaning of <span id="img_10602"></span>
![](img/10602.jpg), see Confucian Analects, III, ch. 13.

Par. 2. I am obliged to adopt the reading of the first sentence of this
paragraph given by Hwâi-nan, <span id="img_10603"></span>
![](img/10603.jpg);--see especially his quotation of it in XVIII, 10 a,
as from a superior man, I have not found his reading anywhere else.

Par. 3 is not easily translated, or explained. See the rules on
presenting offerings at the court of a ruler or the king, in vol. xxvii
of the 'Sacred Books of the East,' p. 84, note 3, and also a narrative
in the Zo Kwan under the thirty-third year of duke Hsî.
