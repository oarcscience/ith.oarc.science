### 46.

46\. 1. When the Tâo prevails in the world, they send back their swift
horses to (draw) the dung-carts.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

When the Tâo is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the
border lands.

2\. There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity
greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than
the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an
enduring and unchanging sufficiency.

<span id="img_08900"></span> ![](img/08900.jpg), 'The Moderating of
Desire or Ambition.' The chapter shows how the practice of the Tâo must
conduce to contentment and happiness.

In translating par. 1 I have, after Wû Khäng, admitted a <span
id="img_08901"></span> ![](img/08901.jpg) after the <span
id="img_08902"></span> ![](img/08902.jpg), his chief authority for doing
so being that it is so found in a poetical piece by Kang Häng (A. D.
78-139). Kû Hsî also adopted this reading (<span id="img_08903"></span>
![](img/08903.jpg), XVIII, 7 a). In par. 2 Han Ying has a tempting
variation of <span id="img_08904"></span> ![](img/08904.jpg) for <span
id="img_08905"></span> ![](img/08905.jpg), but I have not adopted it
because the same phrase occurs elsewhere.
