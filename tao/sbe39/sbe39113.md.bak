### BOOK XXV. ZEH-YANG.

This Book is named from the first two characters in it, 'Zeh-yang,'
which again are the designation of a gentleman of Lû, called Phäng Yang,
who comes before us in Khû, seeking for an introduction to the king of
that state, with the view, we may suppose, of giving him good counsel.
Whether he ever got the introduction which he desired we do not know.
The mention of him only serves to bring in three other individuals, all
belonging to Khû, and the characters of two of them; but we hear no more
of Zeh-yang. The second and third paragraphs are, probably, sequels to
the first, but his name does not appear.

The paragraphs from 4 to 9 have more or less interest in themselves; but
it is not easy to trace in them any sequence of thought. The tenth and
eleventh are more important. The former deals with 'the Talk of the
Hamlets and Villages,' the common sentiments of men, which, correct and
just in themselves, are not to be accepted as a sufficient expression of
the Tâo; the latter sets forth how the name Tâo itself is only a
metaphorical term, used for the purpose of description; as if the Tâo
were a thing, and not capable, therefore, from its material derivation
of giving adequate expression to our highest notion of what it is.

'The Book,' says Lû Shû-kih, 'illustrates how the Great Tâo cannot be
described by any name; that men ought to

stop where they do not really know, and not try to find it in any
phenomenon, or in any event or thing. They must forget both speech and
silence, and then they may approximate to the idea of the Great Tâo.'
