## BOOK IV.

### PART I. SECTION IV.

### Zän Kien Shih, or 'Man in the World, Associated with other Men <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_147.md).'

1\. Yen Hui <span id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_148.md) went to see
Kung-nî <span id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_149.md), and asked leave to take
his departure. 'Where are you going to?' asked the Master. 'I will go to
Wei <span id="fr_160"></span>[4](#fn_150.md)' was the reply. 'And with what
object?' 'I have heard that the ruler of Wei <span
id="fr_161"></span>[5](#fn_151.md) is in the vigour of his years, and
consults none but himself as to his course. He deals with his state as
if it were a light matter, and has no perception of his errors. He
thinks lightly of his people's dying; the dead are lying all over the
country as if no smaller space could contain them; on the plains <span
id="fr_162"></span>[6](#fn_152.md) and about the marshes, they are as thick
as heaps of fuel. The people know not where to turn to. I have heard
you, Master, say, "Leave the state that is well

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

governed; go to the state where disorder prevails <span
id="fr_163"></span>[1](#fn_153.md)." At the door of a physician there are
many who are ill. I wish through what I have heard (from you) to think
out some methods (of dealing with Wei), if peradventure the evils of the
state may be cured.'

Kung-nî said, 'Alas! The risk is that you will go only to suffer in the
punishment (of yourself)! The right method (in such a case) will not
admit of any admixture. With such admixture, the one method will become
many methods. Their multiplication will embarrass you. That
embarrassment will make you anxious. However anxious you may be, you
will not save (yourself). The perfect men of old first had (what they
wanted to do) in themselves, and afterwards they found (the response to
it) in others. If what they wanted in themselves was not fixed, what
leisure had they to go and interfere with the proceedings of any
tyrannous man?

'Moreover, do you know how virtue is liable to be dissipated, and how
wisdom proceeds to display itself? Virtue is dissipated in (the pursuit
of) the name for it, and wisdom seeks to display itself in the striving
with others. In the pursuit of the name men overthrow one another;
wisdom becomes a weapon of contention. Both these things are instruments
of evil, and should not be allowed to have free course in one's conduct.
Supposing one's virtue to be great and his sincerity firm, if he do not
comprehend the spirit of those (whom he wishes to influence); and
supposing he is free from the

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

disposition to strive for reputation, if he do not comprehend their,
minds;-when in such a case he forcibly insists on benevolence and
righteousness, setting them forth in the strongest and most direct
language, before the tyrant, then he, hating (his reprover's) possession
of those excellences, will put him down as doing him injury. He who
injures others is sure to be injured by them in return. You indeed will
hardly escape being injured by the man (to whom you go) <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_154.md)

'Further, if perchance he takes pleasure in men of worth and hates those
of an opposite character, what is the use of your seeking to make
yourself out to be different (from such men about him)? Before you have
begun to announce (your views), he, as king and ruler, will take
advantage of you, and immediately contend with you for victory. Your
eyes will be dazed and full of perplexity; you will try to look pleased
with him; you will frame your words with care; your demeanour will be
conformed to his; you will confirm him in his views. In this way you
will be adding fire to fire, and water to water, increasing, as we may
express it, the evils (which you deplore). To these signs of deferring
to him at the first there will be no end. You will be in danger, seeing
he does not believe you, of making your words more strong, and you are
sure to die at the hands of such a tyrant.

'And formerly Kieh <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_154.md) killed Kwan
Lung-fäng <span id="fr_166"></span>[2](#fn_155.md), and Kâu <span
id="fr_167"></span>[3](#fn_156.md) killed the prince Pî-kan <span
id="fr_168"></span>[4](#fn_157.md). Both of

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

these cultivated their persons, bending down in sympathy with the lower
people to comfort them suffering (as they did) from their oppressors,
and on their account opposing their superiors. On this account, because
they so ordered their conduct, their rulers compassed their
destruction:--such regard had they for their own fame. (Again), Yâo
anciently attacked (the states of) Zhung-kih <span
id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_158.md) and Hsü-âo <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_158.md), and Yü attacked the ruler of Hû <span
id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_158.md). Those states were left empty, and with
no one to continue their population, the people being exterminated. They
had engaged in war without ceasing; their craving for whatever they
could get was insatiable. And this (ruler of Wei) is, like them, one who
craves after fame and greater substance;--have you not heard it? Those
sages were not able to overcome the thirst for fame and substance;--how
much less will you be able to do so! Nevertheless you must have some
ground (for the course which you wish to take); pray try and tell it to
me.'

Yen Hui said, 'May I go, doing so in uprightness and humility, using
also every endeavour to be uniform (in my plans of operation)?' 'No,
indeed!' was the reply. 'How can you do so? This man makes a
display <span id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_159.md) of being filled to
overflowing (with virtue), and has great self-conceit. His feelings are
not to be determined from his countenance. Ordinary men do not (venture
to) oppose him, and he proceeds from the way in which he affects them

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

to seek still more the satisfaction of his own mind. He may be described
as unaffected by the (small lessons of) virtue brought to bear on him
from day to day; and how much less will he be so by your great lessons?
He will be obstinate, and refuse to be converted. He may outwardly agree
with you, but inwardly there will be no self-condemnation;-how can you
(go to him in this way and be successful)?'

(Yen Hui) rejoined, 'Well then; while inwardly maintaining my
straightforward intention, I will outwardly seem to bend to him. I will
deliver (my lessons), and substantiate them by appealing to antiquity.
Inwardly maintaining my straightforward intention, I shall be a
co-worker with Heaven. When I thus speak of being a co-worker with
Heaven, it is because I know that (the sovereign, whom we style) the son
of Heaven, and myself, are equally regarded by Heaven as Its sons. And
should I then, as if my words were only my own, be seeking to find
whether men approved of them, or disapproved of them? In this way men
will pronounce me a (sincere and simple <span
id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_160).md) boy. This is what is called being a
co-worker with Heaven.

'Outwardly bending (to the ruler), I shall be a co-worker with other
men. To carry (the memorandum tablet to court) <span
id="fr_174"></span>[2](#fn_161.md), to kneel, and to bend the body
reverentially:--these are the observances of ministers. They all employ
them, and should I presume not to do so? Doing what other men do, they
would have no occasion to blame me. This

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

is what is called being a fellow-worker with other men.

'Fully declaring my sentiments and substantiating them by appealing to
antiquity, I shall be a co-worker with the ancients. Although the words
in which I convey my lessons may really be condemnatory (of the ruler),
they will be those of antiquity, and not my own. In this way, though
straightforward, I shall be free from blame. This is what is called
being a co-worker with antiquity. May I go to Wei in this way, and be
successful?' 'No indeed!' said Kung-nî. 'How can you do so? You have too
many plans of proceeding, and have not spied out (the ruler's
character). Though you firmly adhere to your plans, you may be held free
from transgression, but this will be all the result. How can you (in
this way) produce the transformation (which you desire)? All this only
shows (in you) the mind of a teacher!'

2\. Yen Hui said, 'I can go no farther; I venture to ask the method from
you.' Kung-nî replied, 'It is fasting <span
id="fr_175"></span>[1](#fn_162), (as) I will tell you. (But.md) when you
have the method, will you find it easy to practise it? He who thinks it
easy will be disapproved of by the bright Heaven.' Hui said, 'My family
is poor. For months together we have no spirituous drink, nor do we
taste the proscribed food or any strong-smelling vegetables <span
id="fr_176"></span>[2](#fn_163.md);--can this be regarded as fasting?' The
reply was, 'It is the fasting appropriate to sacrificing, but it is not
the fasting

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

of the mind.' 'I venture to ask what that fasting of the mind is,' said
Hui, and Kung-nî answered, 'Maintain a perfect unity in every movement
of your will. You will not wait for the hearing of your ears about it,
but for the hearing of your mind. You will not wait even for the hearing
of your mind, but for the hearing of the spirit <span
id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_164). Let the hearing (of the ears.md) rest with
the ears. Let the mind rest in the verification (of the rightness of
what is in the will). But the spirit is free from all pre-occupation and
so waits for (the appearance of) things. Where the (proper) course
is <span id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_165.md), there is freedom from all
pre-occupation;--such freedom is the fasting of the mind.' Hui
said <span id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_166.md), 'Before it was possible for
me to employ (this method), there I was, the Hui that I am; now, that I
can employ it, the Hui that I was has passed away. Can I be said to have
obtained this freedom from pre-occupation?' The Master replied,
'Entirely. I tell you that you can enter and be at ease in the enclosure
(where he is), and not come into collision with the reputation (which
belongs to him). If he listen to your counsels, let him hear your notes;
if he will not listen, be silent. Open no (other) door; employ no other
medicine; dwell with him (as with a. friend) in the same apartment, and
as if you had no other option, and you will not be far from success in
your object. Not to move a step is easy;--to walk without treading on
the ground is difficult. In acting after the manner of men, it is easy
to fall

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

into hypocrisy; in acting after the manner of Heaven, it is difficult to
play the hypocrite. I have heard of flying with wings; I have not heard
of flying without them. I have heard of the knowledge of the wise; I
have not heard of the knowledge of the unwise. Look at that aperture
(left in the wall);--the empty apartment is filled with light through
it. Felicitous influences rest (in the mind thus emblemed), as in their
proper resting place. Even when they do not so rest, we have what is
called (the body) seated and (the mind) galloping abroad. The
information that comes through the ears and eyes is comprehended
internally, and the knowledge of the mind becomes something
external:--(when this is the case), the spiritual intelligences will
come, and take up their dwelling with us, and how much more will other
men do so! All things thus undergo a transforming influence. This was
the hinge on which Yü and Shun moved; it was this which Fû-hsî <span
id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_167.md) and Kî-khü <span
id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_168.md) practised all their lives: how much more
should other men follow the same rule!'

3\. Dze-kâo <span id="fr_182"></span>[3](#fn_169.md), duke of Sheh, being
about to proceed on a mission to Khî, asked Kung-nî, saying, 'The king
is sending me, Kû-liang <span id="fr_183"></span>[3](#fn_169.md), on a
mission which

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

is very important. Khî will probably treat me as his commissioner with
great respect, but it will not be in a hurry (to attend to the
business). Even an ordinary man cannot be readily moved (to action), and
how much less the prince of a state! I am very full of apprehension.
You, Sir, once said to me that of all things, great or small, there were
few which, if not conducted in the proper way <span
id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_170.md), could be brought to a happy conclusion;
that, if the thing were not successful, there was sure to be the evil of
being dealt with after the manner of men <span
id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_171.md); that, if it were successful, there was
sure to be the evil of constant anxiety <span
id="fr_186"></span>[3](#fn_172.md); and that, whether it succeeded or not,
it was only the virtuous man who could secure its not being followed by
evil. In my diet I take what is coarse, and do not seek delicacies,--a
man whose cookery does not require him to be using cooling, drinks. This
morning I received my charge, and in the evening I am drinking iced
water;--am I not feeling the internal heat (and discomfort)? Such is my
state before I have actually engaged in the affair;--I am already
suffering from conflicting anxieties. And if the thing do not succeed,
(the king) is sure to deal with me after the manner of men. The evil is
twofold; as a minister, I am not able to bear the burden (of the
mission). Can

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

you, Sir, tell me something (to help me in the case)?'

Kung-nî replied, 'In all things under heaven there are two great
cautionary considerations:--the one is the requirement implanted (in the
nature) <span id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_173.md); the other is the
conviction of what is right. The love of a son for his parents is the
implanted requirement, and can never be separated from his heart; the
service of his ruler by a minister is what is right, and from its
obligation there is no escaping anywhere between heaven and earth. These
are what are called the great cautionary considerations. Therefore a son
finds his rest in serving his parents without reference to or choice of
place; and this is the height of filial duty. In the same way a subject
finds his rest in serving his ruler, without reference to or choice of
the business; and this is the fullest discharge of loyalty. When men are
simply obeying (the dictates of) their hearts, the considerations of
grief and joy are not readily set before them. They know that there is
no alternative to their acting as they do, and rest in it as what is
appointed; and this is the highest achievement of virtue. He who is in
the position of a minister or of a son has indeed to do what he cannot
but do. Occupied with the details of the business (in hand), and
forgetful of his own person, what leisure has he to think of his
pleasure in living or his dislike of death? You, my master, may well
proceed on your mission.

'But let me repeat to you what I have heard:--In

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

all intercourse (between states), if they are near to each other, there
should be mutual friendliness, verified by deeds; if they are far apart,
there must be sincere adherence to truth in their messages. Those
messages will be transmitted by internuncios. But to convey messages
which express the complacence or the dissatisfaction of the two parties
is the most difficult thing in the world. If they be those of mutual
complacence, there is sure to be an overflow of expressions of
satisfaction; if of mutual dissatisfaction, an overflow of expressions
of dislike. But all extravagance leads to reckless language, and such
language fails to command belief. When this distrust arises, woe to the
internuncio! Hence the Rules for Speech <span
id="fr_188"></span>[1](#fn_174.md) say, "Transmit the message exactly as it
stands; do not transmit it with any overflow of language; so is (the
internuncio) likely to keep himself whole."

4\. 'Moreover, skilful wrestlers begin with open trials of strength, but
always end with masked attempts (to gain the victory); as their
excitement grows excessive, they display much wonderful dexterity.
Parties drinking according to the rules at first observe good order, but
always end with disorder; as their excitement grows excessive, their fun
becomes uproarious <span id="fr_189"></span>[2](#fn_175.md). In all things
it is so. People are at first sincere, but always end with becoming
rude; at the commencement things are treated as trivial,

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

but as the end draws near, they assume great proportions. Words are
(like) the waves acted on by the wind; the real point of the matters
(discussed by them) is lost. The wind and waves are easily set in
motion; the success of the matter of which the real point is lost is
easily put in peril. Hence quarrels are occasioned by nothing so much as
by artful words and one-sided speeches. The breath comes angrily, as
when a beast, driven to death, wildly bellows forth its rage. On this
animosities arise on both sides. Hasty examination (of the case) eagerly
proceeds, and revengeful thoughts arise in their minds;-they do not know
how. Since they do not know how such thoughts arise, who knows how they
will end? Hence the Rules for Speech <span
id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_176.md) say, "Let not an internuncius depart
from his instructions. Let him not urge on a settlement. If he go beyond
the regular rules, he will complicate matters. Departing from his
instructions and urging on a settlement imperils negotiations. A good
settlement is proved by its lasting long, and a bad settlement cannot be
altered;--ought he not to be careful? "

'Further still, let your mind find its enjoyment in the circumstances of
your position; nourish the central course which you pursue, by a
reference to your unavoidable obligations. This is the highest object
for you to pursue; what else can you do to fulfil the charge (of your
father and ruler) <span id="fr_191"></span>[2](#fn_177.md). The best thing
you can do is to be prepared to sacrifice your life; and this is the
most difficult thing to do.'

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

5\. Yen Ho <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_178.md), being about to
undertake the office of Teacher of the eldest son of duke Ling of Wei,
consulted Kü Po-yü <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_179.md). 'Here,' said
he, 'is this (young) man, whose natural disposition is as bad as it
could be. If I allow him to proceed in a bad way, it will be at the
peril of our state; if I insist on his proceeding in a right way, it
will be at the peril of my own person. His wisdom is just sufficient to
know the errors of other men, but he does not know how he errs himself
What am I to do in such a case?' Kü Po-yü replied, 'Good indeed is your
question! Be on your guard; be careful; see that you keep yourself
correct! Your best plan will be, with your person to seek association
with him, and with your mind to try to be in harmony with him; and yet
there are dangers connected with both of these things. While seeking to
keep near to him, do not enter into his pursuits; while cultivating a
harmony of mind with him, do not show how superior you are to him. If in
your personal association you enter into his pursuits, you will fall
with him and be ruined, you will tumbledown with a crash. If in
maintaining a harmony with his mind, you show how different you are from
him, he will think you do so for the reputation and the name, and regard
you as a creature of evil omen <span id="fr_194"></span>[3](#fn_180.md). If
you find him to be a mere boy, be you with him as another boy; if you
find him one of those who will not have their ground marked out in the
ordinary way, do you humour

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

him in this characteristic <span id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_181.md); if you
find him to be free from lofty airs, show yourself to be the same;(ever)
leading him on so as to keep him free from faults.

'Do you not know (the fate of) the praying mantis? It angrily stretches
out its arms, to arrest the progress of the carriage, unconscious of its
inability for such a task, but showing how much it thinks of its own
powers. Be on your guard; be careful. If you cherish a boastful
confidence in your own excellence, and place yourself in collision with
him, you are likely to incur the fate (of the mantis).

'Do you not know how those who keep tigers proceed? They do not dare to
supply them with living creatures, because of the rage which their
killing of them will excite. They do not (even) dare to give them their
food whole, because of the rage which their rending of it will excite.
They watch till their hunger is appeased, (dealing with them) from their
knowledge of their natural ferocity. Tigers are different from men, but
they fawn on those who feed them, and do so in accordance with their
nature. When any of these are killed by them, it is because they have
gone against that nature.

'Those again who are fond of horses preserve their dung in baskets, and
their urine in jars. If musquitoes and gadflies light on them, and the
grooms brush them suddenly away, the horses break their bits, injure
(the ornaments on) their heads, and smash those on their breasts. The
more care that is taken of them, the more does their fondness

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

(for their attendants) disappear. Ought not caution to be exercised (in
the management of them)?'

6\. A (master) mechanic, called Shih, on his way to Khî, came to
Khü-yüan <span id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_182.md), where he saw an
oak-tree, which was used as the altar for the spirits of the land. It
was so large that an ox standing behind it could not be seen. It
measured a hundred spans round, and rose up eighty cubits on the hill
before it threw out any branches, after which there were ten or so, from
each of which a boat could be hollowed out. People came to see it in
crowds as in a market place, but the mechanic did not look round at it,
but held on his way without stopping. One of his workmen, however,
looked long and admiringly at it, and then ran on to his master, and
said to him, 'Since I followed you with my axe and bill, I have never
seen such a beautiful mass of timber as this. Why would you, Sir, not
look round at it, but went on without stopping?' 'Have done,' said Mr.
Shih, 'and do not speak about it. It is quite useless. A boat made from
its wood would sink; a coffin or shell would quickly rot; an article of
furniture would soon go to pieces; a door would be covered with the
exuding sap; a pillar would be riddled by insects; the material of it is
good for nothing, and hence it is that it has attained to so great an
age <span id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_183.md).'

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

When Mr. Shih was returning, the altar-oak appeared to him in a dream,
and said, I What other tree will you compare with me? Will you compare
me to one of your ornamental trees? There are hawthorns, pear-trees,
orange-trees, pummelo-trees, gourds and other low fruit-bearing plants.
When their fruits are ripe, they are knocked down from them, and thrown
among the dirt <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_184.md). The large branches
are broken, and the smaller are torn away. So it is that their
productive ability makes their lives bitter to them; they do not
complete their natural term of existence, but come to a premature end in
the middle of their time, bringing on themselves the destructive
treatment which they ordinarily receive. It is so with all things. I
have sought to discover how it was that I was so useless;--I had long
done so, till (the effort) nearly caused my death; and now I have
learned it:--it has been of the greatest use to me. Suppose that I had
possessed useful properties, should I have become of the great size that
I am? And moreover you and I are both things;--how should one thing thus
pass its judgment on another? how is it that you a useless man know all
this about me a useless tree?' When Mr. Shih awoke, he kept thinking
about his dream, but the workman said, 'Being so taken with its
uselessness, how is it that it yet acts here as the altar for the
spirits of the land?' 'Be still,' was the master's reply, 'and do not
say a word. It simply happened to grow here; and thus those who do not
know it do not speak ill of it as an evil thing. If it were not used as
the altar, would it be in danger of

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

being cut down? Moreover, the reason of its being preserved is different
from that of the preservation of things generally; is not your
explaining it from the sentiment which you have expressed wide of the
mark?'

7\. Nan-po Dze-khî <span id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_185.md) in rambling
about the Heights of Shang <span id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_186.md), saw a
large and extraordinary tree. The teams of a thousand chariots might be
sheltered under it, and its shade would cover them all! Dze-khî said,
'What a tree is this! It must contain an extraordinary amount of timber!
When he looked up, however, at its smaller branches, they were so
twisted and crooked that they could not be made into rafters and beams;
when he looked down to its root, its stem was divided into so many
rounded portions that neither coffin nor shell could be made from them.
He licked one of its leaves, and his mouth felt torn and wounded. The
smell of it would make a man frantic, as if intoxicated, for more than
three whole days together. 'This, indeed,' said he, 'is a tree good for
nothing, and it is thus that it has attained to such a size. Ah! and
spirit-like men acknowledge this worthlessness (and its result) <span
id="fr_201"></span>[3](#fn_187.md).'

In Sung there is the district of King-shih <span
id="fr_202"></span>[4](#fn_188.md), in which catalpae, cypresses, and
mulberry trees grow well. Those of them which are a span or two or
rather more in circumference <span id="fr_203"></span>[5](#fn_189.md) are
cut down by persons who want to make posts to which to tie their

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

monkeys; those which are three or four spans round are cut down by
persons who want beams for their lofty and famous houses; and those of
seven or eight spans are cut down by noblemen and rich merchants who
want single planks for the sides of their coffins. The trees in
consequence do not complete their natural term of life, and come to a
premature end in the middle of their growth under the axe and
bill;--this is the evil that befalls them from their supplying good
timber.

In the same way the Kieh <span id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_190) (book.md)
specifies oxen that have white foreheads, pigs that have turned-up
snouts, and men that are suffering from piles, and forbids their being
sacrificed to the Ho. The wizards know them by these peculiarities and
consider them to be inauspicious, but spirit-like men consider them on
this account to be very fortunate.

8\. There was the deformed object Shû <span
id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_191.md). His chin seemed to hide his navel; his
shoulders were higher than the crown of his head; the knot of his hair
pointed to the sky; his five viscera were all compressed into the upper
part of his body, and his two thigh bones were like ribs. By sharpening
needles and washing clothes he was able to make a living. By sifting
rice and cleaning it, he was able to support ten individuals. When the
government was calling out soldiers, this poor Shû would bare his arms
among the others; when it had any great service to be undertaken,
because of his constant ailments, none of the work was assigned to him;
when it was

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

giving out grain to the sick, he received three kung, and ten bundles of
firewood. If this poor man, so deformed in body, was still able to
support himself, and complete his term of life, how much more may they

9\. When Confucius went to Khû <span id="fr_207"></span>[2](#fn_193.md),
Khieh-yû, the madman of Khû <span id="fr_208"></span>[3](#fn_194.md), as he
was wandering about, passed by his door, and said, 'O Phoenix, O
Phoenix, how is your virtue degenerated! The future is not to be waited
for; the past is not to be sought again! When good order prevails in the
world, the sage tries to accomplish all his service; when disorder
prevails, he may preserve his life; at the present time, it is enough if
he simply escape being punished. Happiness is lighter than a feather,
but no one knows how to support it; calamity is heavier than the earth,
and yet no one knows how to avoid it. Give over! give over approaching
men with the lessons of your virtue! You are in peril! you are in peril,
hurrying on where you have marked out the ground against your advance! I
avoid publicity, I avoid publicity, that my path may not be injured. I
pursue my course, now going backwards, now crookedly, that my feet may
not be hurt <span id="fr_209"></span>[4](#fn_195.md).

'The mountain by its trees weakens itself <span
id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_196.md). The grease which ministers to the fire
fries itself The cinnamon tree can be eaten, and therefore it is cut
down. The varnish tree is useful, and therefore incisions are made in
it. All men know the advantage of being useful, but no one knows the
advantage of being useless.'

as the counts of Khû had usurped the name of king, they gave
high-sounding names to all their ministers and officers.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[216:1](sbe39125.htm#fr_195.md) Equivalent to 'Do
not cross him in his peculiarities.'

<span id="fn_182"></span>[217:1](sbe39125.htm#fr_196.md) The name of a

the locality had not been identified.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[217:2](sbe39125.htm#fr_197.md) No one has thought
it worth cutting down.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[218:1](sbe39125.htm#fr_198.md) This is the
indignity intended.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[219:1](sbe39125.htm#fr_199.md) Probably the

creations.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[221:1](sbe39125.htm#fr_206.md) The deficiency of

useless trees in the last two paragraphs, whose uselessness only proved

the south, having its capital in the present Hû-pei.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[221:3](sbe39125.htm#fr_208.md) See the Analects,
XVIII, v.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[221:4](sbe39125.htm#fr_209.md) The madman would
seem to contrast his own course with that of Confucius; but the meaning
is very uncertain, and the text cannot be discussed fully in these short
notes. There is a jingle <span id="page_222">p. 222</span> of rhyme also
in the sentence, and some critics find something like this in them:

'Ye ferns, ye thorny ferns, O injure not my way!  
To save my feet, I backward turn, or winding stray!'

<span id="fn_196"></span>[222:1](sbe39125.htm#fr_210.md) Literally, 'robs
itself;'--exhausts its moisture or productive strength.
