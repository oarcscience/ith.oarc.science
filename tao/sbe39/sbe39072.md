65\. 1. The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tâo did
so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and
ignorant.

2\. The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much

to it while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing.

3\. He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule.

Excellence.' The chapter shows the powerful and beneficent influence of
the Tâo in government, in contrast with the applications and
