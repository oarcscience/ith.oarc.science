80\. 1. In a little state with a small population, I would so order it,
that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a
hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the
people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove
elsewhere (to avoid it).

2\. Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to
ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should
have no occasion to don or use them.

3\. I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead
of the written characters).

4\. They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes
beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common
(simple) ways sources of enjoyment.

5\. There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices of
the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I
would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any
intercourse with it.

chapter sets forth what Lâo-dze conceived the ancient government of
simplicity was, and what he would have government in all time to be. He
does not use the personal pronoun 'I' as the subject of the
thrice-recurring <span id="img_12201"></span> ![](img/12201.jpg), but it
is most natural to suppose that he is himself that subject; and he
modestly supposes himself in charge of a little state and a small

population. The reader can judge for himself of the consummation that
would be arrived at;--a people rude and uninstructed, using quippos,
abstaining from war and all travelling, kept aloof from intercourse even
with their neighbours, and without the appliances of what we call
civilisation.

The text is nearly all found in Sze-mâ Khien and Kwang-dze. The first
member of par. 1, however, is very puzzling. The old Jesuit translators,
Julien, Chalmers, and V. von Strauss, all differ in their views of it.
Wû Khäng and Ziâo Hung take what I have now rendered by 'abilities,' as
meaning 'implements of agriculture,' but their view is based on a custom
of the Han dynasty, which is not remote enough for the purpose, and on
the suppression, after Wang Pî, of a <span id="img_12300"></span>
