### BOOK XXI, THIEN DZE-FANG.

Thien Dze-fang is merely the name of one of the men who appear in the
first paragraph. That he was a historical character is learned from the
'Plans of the Warring States,' XIV, art. 6, where we find him at the
court of the marquis Wän of Wei (B. C. 424-387), acting as counsellor to
that ruler. Thien was his surname; Dze-fang his designation,

and Wû-kâi his name. He has nothing to do with any of the paragraphs but
the first.

It is not easy to reduce all the narratives or stories in the Book to
one category. The fifth, seventh, and eighth, indeed, are generally
rejected as spurious, or unworthy of our author; and the sixth and ninth
are trivial, though the ninth bears all the marks of his graphic style.
Paragraphs 3 and 4 are both long and important. A common idea in them
and in 1, 2, and 10, seems to be that the presence and power of the Tâo
cannot be communicated by words, and are independent. of outward
condition and circumstances.
