### 37.

37\. 1. The Tâo in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of
doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do.

2\. If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of
themselves be transformed by them.

3\. If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would

Is free from all external aim.  
With no desire, at rest and still,  
All things go right as of their will.

Government.' This exercise should be according to the Tâo, doing without
doing, governing without government.

The subject of the third paragraph is a feudal prince or the king, and
he is spoken of in the first person, to give more vividness to the
style, unless the <span id="img_07901"></span> ![](img/07901.jpg), 'I,'
