### BOOK X. KHÜ KHIEH.

It is observed by the commentator Kwei Kän-khüan that one idea runs
through this Book:--that the most sage and wise men have ministered to
theft and robbery, and that, if there were an end of sageness and
wisdom, the world would be at rest. Between it and the previous Book
there is a general agreement in argument and object, but in this the
author expresses himself with greater vehemence, and almost goes to
excess in his denunciation of the institutions of the sages.

The reader will agree with these accounts of the Book. Kwang-dze at
times becomes weak in his attempts to establish his points. To my mind
the most interesting portions of this Book and the last one are the full
statements which we have in them of the happy state of men when the Tâo
maintained its undisputed sway in the world, and the names of many of
the early Tâoistic sovereigns. How can we suppose that anything would be
gained by a return to the condition of primitive innocence and
simplicity? The antagonism between Tâoism and Confucianism comes out in
this Book very decidedly.

The title of the Book is taken from two characters in the first clause
of the first paragraph.
