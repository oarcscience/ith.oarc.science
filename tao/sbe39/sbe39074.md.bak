### 67.

67\. 1. All the world says that, while my Tâo is great, it yet appears
to be inferior (to other systems of teaching). Now it is just its
greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other
(system), for long would its smallness have been known!

2\. But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The
first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking
from taking precedence of others.

3\. With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be
liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, 1 can become a
vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and are
all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost
place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) death.

4\. Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to
maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very)
gentleness protecting him.

Things.' This title is taken from par. 2, and suggests to us how the
early framer of these titles intended to express by them the
subject-matter of their several chapters. The three things are the three
distinguishing qualities of the possessor of the Tâo, the

three great moral qualities appearing in its followers, the qualities,
we may venture to say, of the Tâo itself. The same phrase is now the
common designation of Buddhism in China,--the Tri-ratna or Ratna-traya,
'the Precious Buddha,' 'the Precious Law,' and 'the Precious Priesthood
(or rather Monkhood) or Church;' appearing also in the 'Tri-sarana,' or
'formula of the Three Refuges,' what Dr. Eitel calls 'the most primitive
formula fidei of the early Buddhists, introduced before Southern and
Northern Buddhism separated.' I will not introduce the question of
whether Buddhism borrowed this designation from Tâoism, after its
entrance into China. It is in Buddhism the formula of a peculiar Church
or Religion; in Tâoism a rule for the character, or the conduct which
the Tâo demands from all men. 'My Tâo' in par. 1 is the reading of Wang
Pî; Ho-shang Kung's text is simply a <span id="img_11100"></span>
![](img/11100.jpg). Wang Pî's reading is now generally adopted.

The concluding sentiment of the chapter is equivalent to the saying of
Mencius (VII, ii, IV, 2), 'If the ruler of a state love benevolence, he
will have no enemy under heaven.' 'Heaven' is equivalent to 'the Tâo,
'the course of events,--Providence, as we should say.
