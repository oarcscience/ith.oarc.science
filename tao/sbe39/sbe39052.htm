<P>45. 1. Who thinks his great achievements poor<BR>
Shall find his vigour long endure.<BR>
Of greatest fulness, deemed a void,<BR>
Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide.<BR>
Do thou what's straight still crooked deem;<BR>
Thy greatest art still stupid seem,<BR>
And eloquence a stammering scream.</P></DIR>

<P>2. Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/08801.jpg">, 'Great or Overflowing Virtue.' The chapter is another illustration of the working of the T&acirc;o by contraries. According to W&ucirc; Kh&auml;ng, the action which overcomes cold is that of the Yang element in the developing primordial ether; and the stillness which overcomes heat is that of the contrary Yin element. These may have been in L&acirc;o-dze's mind, but the statements are so simple as hardly to need any comment. W&ucirc; further says that the purity and stillness are descriptive of the condition of non-action.</P>
