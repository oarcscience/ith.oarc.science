<p>When people are too ignorant to fear the things that are really fearful (greed, illusion and self-assertion), the greatest fear (of death) will soon overpower them. Do not be troubled because of the narrowness of your dwelling, do not become depressed because of the life you are compelled to live. If people cease to worry about their surroundings and their lives, their minds will become tranquil.</p>  
<p>Therefore, the perfect Sage understands himself but never exhibits himself; he cherishes but never overvalues himself. He discards ostentation and pride, but keeps understanding and mindfulness.</p>
