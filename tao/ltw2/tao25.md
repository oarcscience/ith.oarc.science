### TWENTY-FIVE

There is a primal essence that is all-inclusive and undifferentiated and
which existed before there was any appearance of heaven and earth. How
tranquil and empty it is! How self-sufficing and changeless! How
omnipresent and infinite! Yet this tranquil emptiness becomes the Mother
of all. Who knows its name? I can only characterize it and call it TAO.
Though it is quite inadequate, I will even call it the Great. But how
boundless is its Greatness! It stretches away into the far distances
(like a circle) only to return again.

How Great is TAO! But so is Heaven Great; and

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

so is earth Great; and so is the perfect Sage Great. On the earth there
are these four Greatnesses and among them is the perfect Sage. Men act
in conformity with the laws of earth; earth acts in conformity with the
laws of Heaven; Heaven acts in conformity with the laws of TAO; TAO acts
in accordance with its own self-nature.
