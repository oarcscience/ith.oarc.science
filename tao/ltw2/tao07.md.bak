### SEVEN

Heaven is eternal and earth is everlasting. The reason why heaven and
earth are eternal is because they do not live for or by themselves: that
is the reason they ever endure.

The perfect Sage, who puts his own interests behind him, is always the
leader of his people. All the time he is looking after the welfare of
his people and in doing so he preserves his own life. Is it not because
he is disinterested that his own interests are conserved?
