### THIRTY

When a minister serves a ruler after the principle of TAO, he will not
advise a resort to force of arms to become a great nation. Like returns
to like. So briars and thorns grow rank where an army camps. Bad years
of want and disorder follow a great war.

Therefore, the competent ruler, resolutely restraining his desires and
ambition, dares not resort to force. Because he is resolute, he will not
be boastful, nor haughty, nor arrogant; because he is resolute he will
act only under necessity; because he is resolute, he will have no
ambition to be powerful.

By the nature of things, when the strength of anything is fully
developed, it immediately begins to decay. This means that strength is
not in accordance

with the principle of TAO. Being not in accordance with TAO, it will
soon pass away.
