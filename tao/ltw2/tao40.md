### FORTY

To withdraw the mind from attention to outward things, to be thoughtful,
to practice meditation, is to be in conformity with TAO. To be humble
and of service to others is, also, being in conformity with TAO. Heaven
and earth, and all things are manifestations of existence, but
existence, itself, comes from non-existence. (It is to this potential
nonexistence that the mind should be directed) .
