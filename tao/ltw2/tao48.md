### FORTY-EIGHT

In regard to knowledge: the more one studies, the more he accumulates
learning; while in regard to wisdom the more one practices TAO, the more
his desires and thoughts are lessened, even to perfect emptiness of
mind, all his innate excellencies will be developed and manifested. It
is therefore necessary, if one is to keep control of his mind, to
preserve its emptiness. But as soon as one desires to control his mind,
he becomes incapable of doing so. It is by this spontaneous control of
mind that the Sage gains the world's favor.
