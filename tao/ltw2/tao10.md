### TEN

During the daytime, our senses are kept busy in activities, but if we
keep our minds concentrated, we will better preserve their
potentialities. If, in our practice of concentration, we preserve
humility and tenderness and retain our natural breathing, we will become
like a little child. If, in our practice of concentration, our minds
retain their purity, we will be kept free from faults.

If the perfect Sage truly loves his people and wishes to bring his state
into peace and order, he must practice *wu-wei*. If in our practice of
concentration our heavenly eye is suddenly opened and we gain
enlightenment thenceforth we shall be free from lust and greed. If we
attain transcendental intelligence, our minds penetrating into every
corner and into everything, then our minds will lose their
self-consciousness.

A father begets children and sustains them while they are growing,
nevertheless his children are not to be considered as his personal
property, nor is his care of them to be done for any hope of reward, nor
should his parental authority continue after they have reached manhood.
This is the profoundest virtue of TAO.
