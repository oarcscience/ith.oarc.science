### SEVENTEEN

A great ruler, first of all, ought to know the necessities and habits of
his people. Secondly, he should keep in close touch with them and praise
the meritorious ones. Thirdly, he should give reason for them to respect
his moral earnestness. Lastly, he should resort to punishment only to
bring home to them the disgracefulness of evil.

When a ruler lacks faith in his people, his people will lack faith in
him. A wise ruler is always careful in his choice of words and because
of it his people respect him and give him credit for the natural success
of his admiration.
