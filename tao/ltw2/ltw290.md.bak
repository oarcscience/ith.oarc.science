### CHAPTER III

### LOVE

ONCE more it was evening. We sat again upon the soft turf of the
mountain-side, the quietness of our mood in sympathy with the solemn
stillness of twilight. The distant mountain-ranges reposed in an
atmosphere breathing reverence and devotion--they seemed to be kneeling
beneath the heavens, beneath the slow-descending blessing of night. The
isolated trees dotted here and there about the hills stood motionless,
in a pause of silent worshipping. The rush of the sea sounded distant
and indistinct, lost in its own greatness. Peace lay over everything,
and soft sounds went up, as of prayer.

The hermit stood before me, dignified as a tree in the midst of Nature,
and awe-inspiring as the evening itself.

I had returned to question him again. For my soul found no repose apart
from him, and a mighty impulse was stirring within me. But now that I
found myself near him, I hardly dared to speak; and indeed it seemed as
though words were no longer necessary--as though everything lay, of
itself, open and clear as daylight. How goodly and simple everything
appeared that evening! Was it not my own inmost being that I recognized
in all the beauty around me? and was not the whole on the point of being
absorbed into the Eternal?

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

Nevertheless I broke in upon this train of feeling, and cleft the
peaceful silence with my voice:

"Father," I said sadly, "all your words have sunk into my mind, and my
soul is filled with the balm of them. This soul of mine is no longer my
own--no longer what I used to be. It is as though I were dead: and I
know not what is taking place within me--by day and by night--causing it
to grow so light, and clear, and vacant in my mind. Father, I know it is
Tao; it is death, and glorious resurrection; but it is not love; and
without love, Tao appears to me but a gloomy lie."

The old man looked round him at the evening scene, and smiled gently.

"What *is* love?" he asked calmly. "Are you sure about that, I wonder?"

"No, I am not sure," I answered. "I do not know anything about it, but
that is just the reason of its great blessedness. Yes, do but let me
express it! I mean: love of a Maiden, love of a woman.--I remember yet,
Father, what it was to me when I saw the maiden, and my soul knew
delight for the first time. It was like a sea, like a broad heaven, like
death. It was light--and I had been blind! It hurt, Father--my heart
beat so violently--and my eyes burned. The world was a fire, and all
things were strange, and began to live. It was a great flame flaring
from out my soul. It was so fearful, but so lovely, and so infinitely
great! Father, I think it was greater than Tao!"

"I know well what it was," said the sage. "It was Beauty, the earthly
form of the formless Tao, calling up in you the rhythm of that movement
by which you will enter into Tao. You might have experienced

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

the same at sight of a tree, a cloud, a flower. But because you are
human, living by desire, therefore to you it could only be revealed
through another human being, a woman--because, also, that form is to you
more easily understood, and more familiar. And since desire did not
allow the full upgrowth of a pure contemplation, therefore was the
rhythm within you wrought up to be wild tempest, like a storm-thrashed
sea that knows not whither it is tending. The inmost essence of the
whole emotion was not 'love,' but Tao."

But the calmness of the old sage made me impatient, and excited me to
answer roughly:

"It is easy to talk thus theoretically, but seeing that you have never
experienced it yourself, you can understand nothing of that of which you
speak!"

He looked at me steadily, and laid his hand sympathetically on my
shoulder.

"It would be cruel of you to speak thus to any one but me, young man!--I
loved, before you drew breath in this world! At that time there lived a
maiden, so wondrous to see, it was as if she were the direct-born
expression of Tao. For me she was the world, and the world lay dead
around her. I saw nothing but her, and for me there existed no such
things as trees, men, or clouds. She was more beautiful than this
evening, gentler than the lines of those distant mountains, more tender
than those hushed tree-tops; and the light of her presence was more
blessed .to see than the still shining of yonder star. I will not tell
you her story. It was more scorching than a very hell-fire--but it was
not real, and it is over now, like a storm that has passed. It seemed to
me that I must die; I longed to flee from my pain into death.--But there
came a

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

dawning in my soul, and all grew light and comprehensible. Nothing was
lost. All was yet as it had been. The beauty which I believed to have
been taken from me lived on still, spotless, in myself. For not from
this woman,--out of my soul had this beauty sprung; and this I saw
shining yet, all over the world, with an everlasting radiance, Nature
was no other than what I had fashioned to myself out of that shadowy
form of a woman. And my soul was one with Nature, and floated with a
like rhythm towards the eternal Tao."

Calmed by his calmness, I said: "She whom I loved is dead, Father--She
who culled my soul as a child culls a flower never became my wife. But I
have a wife now, a miracle of strength and goodness, a wife who is
essential to me as light and air. I do not love her as I even now love
the dead. But I know that she is a purer human being than that other.
How is it then that I do *not* love her so much? She has transformed my
wild and troubled life into a tranquil march towards death. She is
simple and true as Nature itself, and her face is dear to me as the
sunlight."

"You love her, indeed!" said the sage, "but you know not what love
means, nor loving. I will tell it you. Love is no other than the rhythm
of Tao. I have told you: you are come out of Tao, and to Tao you will
return. Whilst you are young--with your soul still enveloped in
darkness--in the shock of the first impulse within you, you know not yet
whither you are trending. You see the woman before you. You believe her
to be that towards which the rhythm is driving you. But even when the
woman is yours, and you have thrilled at the touch of her, you feel the
rhythm yet within you, unappeased, and know that

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

you must forward, ever further, if you would bring it to a standstill.
Then it is that in the soul of the man and of the woman there arises a
great sadness, and they look at one another, questioning whither they
are now bound. Gently they clasp one another by the hand, and move on
through life, swayed by the same impulse, towards the same goal. Call
this love if you will. What is a name? I call it Tao. And the souls of
those who love are like two white clouds floating softly side by side,
that vanish, wafted by the same wind, into the infinite blue of the
heavens."

"But that is not the love that I mean!" I cried. "Love is not the desire
to see the loved one absorbed into Tao; love is the longing to be always
with her; the deep yearning for the blending of the two souls in one;
the hot desire to soar, in one breath with her, into felicity! And this
always with the loved one alone--not with others, not with Nature. And,
were I absorbed into Tao, all this happiness would be for ever lost! Oh
let me stay here, in this goodly world, with my faithful companion! Here
it is so bright and homely, and Tao is still so gloomy and inscrutable
for me."

"The hot desire dies out," he answered calmly. "The body of your loved
one will wither and pass away within the cold earth. The leaves of the
trees fade in autumn, and the withered flowers droop sadly to the
ground. How can you love that so much which does not last? However, you
know, in truth, as yet, neither how you love nor what it is that you
love. The beauty of woman is but a vague reflection of the formless
beauty of Tao. The emotion it awakens, the longing to lose yourself in
her beauty, that ecstasy of feeling

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

which would lend wings for the flight of your soul with the
beloved--beyond horizon-bounds, into regions of bliss--believe me, it is
no other than the rhythm of Tao; only you know it not. You resemble
still the river which knows as yet only its shimmering banks; which has
no knowledge of the power that draws it forward; but which will one day
inevitably flow out into the great ocean. Why this striving after
happiness, after human happiness, that lasts but a moment and then
vanishes again? Chuang-Tse said truly: 'The highest happiness is no
happiness.' Is it not small and pitiable, this momentary uprising, and
downfalling, and uprising again? This wavering, weakly intention and
progress of men? Do not seek happiness in a woman. She is the joyful
revelation of Tao directed towards you. She is the purest form in the
whole of nature by which Tao is manifested. She is the gentle force that
awakens the rhythm of Tao within you. But she is only a poor creature
like yourself. And you are for her the same joyful revelation that she
is to you. Fancy not that that which you perceive in her is that Tao,
that very holiest, into which you would one day ascend! For then you
would surely reject her when you realized what she was. If you will
truly love a woman, then love her as being of the same poor nature as
yourself, and do not seek happiness with her. Whether in your love you
see this or not--her inmost being is Tao. A poet looks upon a woman,
and, swayed by the 'rhythm,' he perceives the beauty of the beloved in
all things--in the trees, the mountains, the horizon; for the beauty of
a woman is the same as that of Nature. It is the form of Tao, the great
and formless, and what your soul desires in the

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

excitement of beholding--this strange, unspeakable feeling--is nothing
but your oneness with this beauty, and with the source of this
beauty--Tao. And the like is experienced by your wife. Ye are for each
other angels, who lead one another to Tao unconsciously."

I was silent for a while, reflecting. In the soft colouring and
stillness of the evening lay a great sadness. About the horizon, where
the sun had set, there glimmered a streak of faint red light, like dying
pain.

"What is this sadness, then, in the Nature around us?" I asked. "Is
there not that in the twilight as though the whole earth were weeping
with a grievous longing? See how she mourns, with these fading hues,
these drooping tree-tops, and solemn mountains. Human eyes must fill
with tears, when this great grief of Nature looms within their sight. It
is as though she were longing for her beloved--as though
everything--seas, mountains and heavens--were full of mourning.

And the Sage replied: "It is the same pain which cries in the hearts of
men. Your own longing quivers in Nature too. The 'Heimweh' of the
evening is also the 'Heimweh' of your soul. Your soul has lost her love:
Tao, with whom she once was one; and your soul desires re-union with her
love. Absolute re-union with Tao--is not that an immense love?--to be so
absolutely one with the beloved that you are wholly hers, she wholly
yours;--a union so full and eternal that neither death nor life can ever
cleave your oneness again? So tranquil and pure that desire can no more
awaken in you--perfect blessedness being attained,

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

and a holy and permanent peace? . . . For Tao is one single, eternal,
pure infinitude of soul.

"Is that not more perfect than the love of a woman?--this poor, sad
love, each day of which reveals to you some sullying of the clear life
of the soul by dark and sanguine passion? When you are absorbed into
Tao, then only will you be completely, eternally united with the soul of
your beloved, with the souls of all men, your brothers, and with the
soul of Nature. And the few moments of blessedness fleetingly enjoyed by
all lovers upon earth are as nothing in comparison with that endless
bliss: the blending of the souls of all who love in an eternity of
perfect purity."

A horizon of blessedness opened out before my soul, wider than the vague
horizon of the sea, wider than the heavens.

"Father!" I cried in ecstasy, "can it be that everything is so holy, and
I have never known it?--I have been so filled with longing, and so
wornout with weeping; and my breast has been heavy with sobs and dread.
I have been so consumed with fear! I have trembled at the thought of
death! I have despaired of all things being good, when I saw so much
suffering around me. I have believed myself damned, by reason of the
wild passions, the bodily desires, burning within and flaming without
me--passions which, though hating them, I still was, coward-like,
condemned to serve. With what breathless horror I have realized how the
tender, flower-like body of my love must one day moulder and crumble
away in the cold, dark earth! I have believed that I should never feel
again that blessed peace at the look in her eyes, through which

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

her soul was shining. And was it Tao!--was Tao really even then always
within me, like a faithful guardian? and was it Tao that shone from her
eyes? Was Tao in everything that surrounded me? in the clouds, the trees
and the sea? Is the inmost being of earth and heaven, then, also the
inmost being of my beloved and my own soul? Is it *that* for which there
burns within me that mysterious longing which I did not understand, and
which drove me so restlessly onward? I thought it was leading me away
from the beloved and that I was ceasing to love her!--Was it really the
rhythm of Tao, then, that moved my beloved too?--the same as that in
which all nature breathes, and all suns and planets pursue their shining
course throughout eternity?--Then all is indeed made holy!--then Tao is
indeed in everything, as my soul is in Tao! Oh, Father, Father! it is
growing so light in my heart! My soul seems to foresee that which will
come one day; and the heavens above us, and the great sea, they foretell
it too! See, how reverent is the pose of these trees around us--and see
the lines of the mountains, how soft in their holy repose! All Nature is
filled with sacred awe, and my soul too thrills with ecstasy, for she
has looked upon her beloved!"

I sat there long, in silent, still forgetfulness. It was to me as though
I were one with the soul of my master and with Nature. I saw nothing and
heard nothing;--void of all desire, bereft of all will, I lay sunk in
the deepest peace. I was awakened by a soft sound close by me. A fruit
had fallen from the tree to the ground behind us. When I looked up, it
was into shimmering moonlight. The recluse was standing by me, and bent
over me kindly.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

"You have strained your spirit overmuch, my young friend!" he said
concernedly. "It is too much for you in so short a time. You have fallen
asleep from exhaustion. The sea sleeps too. See, not a furrow breaks its
even surface; motionless, dreaming, it receives the benediction of the
light. But you must awaken! It is late, your boat is ready, and your
wife awaits you at home in the town."

I answered, still half dreaming: "I would so gladly stay here. Let me
return, with my wife, and stay here for ever! I cannot go back to the
people again! Ah, Father, I shudder--I can see their scoffing faces,
their insulting glances, their disbelief, and their irreverence! How can
I retain the wondrous light and tender feeling of my soul in the midst
of that ungracious people? How can I ever so hide it under smile or
speech that they shall never detect it, nor desecrate it with their
insolent ridicule?"

Then, laying his hand earnestly upon my shoulder, he said:

"Listen carefully to what I now say to you, my friend, and above all,
*believe* me. I shall give you pain, but I cannot help it. You *must*
return to the world and your fellow-men; it cannot be otherwise. You
have spoken too much with me already; perhaps I have said somewhat too
much to you. Your further growth must be your own doing, and you must
find out everything for yourself. Be only simple of heart, and you will
discover everything without effort, like a child finding flowers. At
this moment you feel deeply and purely what I have said to you. This
present mood is one of the highest moments of your life. But you cannot
yet be strong enough to maintain it. You will

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

relapse, and spiritual feeling will turn again to words and theories.
Only by slow degrees will you grow once more to feel it purely and keep
it permanently. When that is so, then you may return hither in peace and
then you will do well to remain here;--but by that time I shall be long
dead.

"You must complete your growth in the midst of life, not outside it; for
you are not yet pure enough to rise above it. A moment ago, it is true,
you were equal even to that, but the reaction will soon set in. You may
not shun the rest of mankind; they are your equals, even though they may
not feel. so purely as you do. You can go amongst them as their comrade,
and take them by the hand; only do not let them look upon your soul, so
long as they are still so far behind you. They would not mock you from
evilmindedness, but rather out of religious persuasion, being unaware
how utterly miserable, how godless, how forsaken they are, and how far
from all those holy things by which you actually live. You must be so
strong in your conviction that nothing can hinder you. And that you will
only become after a long and bitter struggle. But out of your tears will
grow your strength, and through pain you will attain peace. Above all
remember that Tao, Poetry and Love are one and the same, although you
may seek to define it by these several vague terms;--that it is always
within you and around you;--that it never forsakes you; and that you are
safe and well cared for in this holy environment. You are surrounded
with benefits, and sheltered by a love which is eternal. Everything is
rendered holy through the primal force of Tao dwelling within it."

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

He spoke so gently and convincingly that I had no answer to give.
Willingly I allowed myself to be guided by him to the shore. My boat lay
motionless upon the smooth water, awaiting me.--

"Farewell, my young friend! Farewell!" he said, calmly and tenderly.
"Remember all that I have told you!"

But I could not leave him in such a manner. Suddenly I thought of the
loneliness of his life in this place, and tears of sympathy rose to my
eyes. I grasped his hand.

"Father, come with me!" I besought him. "My wife and I will care for
you; we will do everything for you; and when you are sick we will tend
you. Do not stay here in this loneliness, so void of all the love that
might make life sweet to you!"

He smiled gently, and shook his head as a father might at some fancy of
his child's, answering with tranquil kindness:

"You have lapsed already! Do you realize now how necessary it is for you
to remain in the midst of the every-day life? I have but this moment
told you how great is the love which surrounds me--and still you deem me
lonely here and forsaken?--Here, in Tao, I am as safe at home as a child
is with its mother. You mean it well, my friend, but you must grow
wiser, much wiser! Be not concerned for me; that is unnecessary,
grateful though I am to you for this feeling. Think of yourself just
now. And do what I say. Believe that I tell you that which is best for
you. In the boat lies something which should remind you of the days you
have spent here. Farewell!"

I bent silently over his hand and kissed it. I thought

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I felt that it
trembled with emotion; but when I looked at him again his face was calm
and cheerful as the moon in the sky.

I stepped into the boat, and the boatman took up the oars. With dextrous
strokes he drove it over the even surface of the water. I was already
some way from the land when my foot struck against some object in the
boat and I remembered that something for me was lying there. I took it
up. It was a small chest. Hastily I lifted the lid. And in the soft,
calm moonlight there gleamed with mystical radiance the wonderful
porcelain of the Kwan-Yin image, the same which the old man had
cherished so carefully, and loved so well.

There, in the lofty tranquillity of severe yet gentle lines, in all the
ethereal delicacy of the transparent porcelain, reposed the pure figure
of Kwan-Yin, shining as with spiritual radiance amidst the shimmering
petals of the lotus.

I scarcely dared believe that this holy thing had been given to me. I
seized my handkerchief, and waved with it towards the shore, to convey
to the recluse my thanks. He stood there motionless, gazing straight
before him. I waited longingly for him to wave--for one more greeting
from him--one more sign of love--but he remained immovable.

Was it I after whom he was gazing? Was he gazing at the sea? . . .

I closed the lid of the chest, and kept it near me, as though it had
been a love of his which I was bearing away. I knew now that he cared
for me; but his imperturbable serenity was too great for me--it saddened
my mood that he had never signed to me again.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

We drew further and further away; the outlines of his figure grew
fainter and fainter; at last I could see it no more.

He remained; with the dreams of his soul, in the midst of Nature--alone
in infinity--bereft of all human love--but close to the great bosom of
Tao.

I took my way back to the life amongst mankind, my brothers and
equals--in all the souls of whom dwells Tao, primordial and eternal.

The ornamental lights of the harbour gleamed already in the distance,
and the drone of the great town sounded nearer and nearer to us over the
sea.

Then I felt a great strength in me, and I ordered the boatman to row
still more quickly. I was ready. Was I not as safely and well cared for
in the great town as in the still country?--in the street as on the sea?

In everything, everywhere, dwells Poetry--Love--Tao. And the whole world
is a great sanctuary, well-devised and surely-maintained as a strong,
well-ordered house.
