### CHAPTER I

### TAO

I WAS standing in the Temple of Shien Shan on an islet in the Chinese
Sea, distant a few hours' journey from the harbour of Hā Tó.

On either side rose mountain ranges, their soft outlines interwoven
behind the island to the westward. To the eastward shimmered the endless
Ocean. High up, rock-supported, stood the Temple, in the shadow of broad
Buddha-trees.

The island is but little visited, but sometimes fisher-folk, fleeing
before the threatening typhoon, anchor there when they have no further
hope of reaching the harbour. Why the Temple exists in this lonely spot,
no one knows; but the lapse of centuries has established its holy right
to stand there. Strangers arrive but seldom, and there are only a
hundred poor inhabitants, or thereabouts, who live there simply because
their ancestors did so before them. I had gone thither in the hope of
finding some man of a serious bent of mind with whom to study. I had
explored the temples and convents of the neighborhood for more than a
year, in search of earnest-minded priests capable of telling me what I
was unable to learn from the superficial books on Chinese religion; but
I found nothing but ignorant, stupid creatures everywhere--kneeling to
idols whose symbolical significance they did not understand, and
reciting strange "Sutras"

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

not one word of which was intelligible to them. [1](ltw291.htm#xref_1.md)
And I had been obliged to draw all my information from badly translated
works that had received even worse treatment at the hands of learned
Europeans than at those of the literary Chinese whom I had consulted. At
last, however, I had heard an old Chinaman speak of "the Sage of Shien
Shan" as of one well-versed in the secrets of Heaven and Earth;
and--without cherishing any great expectations, it is true--I had
crossed the water to seek him out.

This Temple resembled many others that I had seen. Grimy priests lounged
on the steps in dirty-grey garments, and stared at me with senseless
grins. The figures of "Kwan Yin" and "Cakyamuni" and "Sam-Pao-Fu" had
been newly restored, and blazed with all imaginable crude colours that
completely marred their former beauty. The floor was covered with dirt
and dust, and pieces of orange-peel and sugar-cane were strewn about. A
thick and heavy atmosphere oppressed my breast.

Addressing one of the priests, I said:

"I have come to visit the philosopher. Does not an old hermit dwell
here, called after 'Laotzu'?"

With a wondering face he answered me:

"Laotzu lives in the top-most hut upon the cliffs. But he does not like
barbarians."

I asked him quietly:

"Will you take me to him, Bikshu, for a dollar?"

There was greed in his glance, but he shook his head, saying:

"I dare not; seek him yourself."

The other priests grinned, and offered me tea, in the hope of a tip.--

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

I left them, and climbed the rocks, reaching the top in half an hour;
and there I found a little square stone hut. I knocked at the door, and,
shortly after, heard some one draw back a bolt.

There stood the sage, looking at me.

And it was a revelation.

It seemed as though I saw a great light--a light not dazzling, but
calming.

He stood before me tall and straight as a palm-tree. His countenance was
peaceful as is a calm evening, in the hush of the trees, and the still
moonlight; his whole person breathed the majesty of nature, as simply
beautiful, as purely spontaneous, as a mountain or a cloud. His presence
radiated an atmosphere holy as the prayerful soul in the soft
after-gleam on a twilight landscape,--I felt uneasy under his deep gaze,
and saw my poor life revealed in all its pettiness. I could not speak a
word, but felt in silence his enlightening influence.

He raised his hand with a gesture like the movement of a swaying flower,
and held it out to me--heartily--frankly. He spoke, and his voice was
soft music, like the sound of the wind in the trees:

"Welcome, stranger! What do you seek of me?--old man that I am!"

"I come to seek a master," I answered humbly, "to find the path to human
goodness. I have long searched this beautiful land, but the people seem
as though they were dead, and I am as poor as ever."

"You err somewhat in this matter," said the sage. "Strive not so busily
to be so very good. Do not seek it overmuch, or you will never find the
true wisdom. Do you not know how it was that the Yellow

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Emperor [2](ltw291.htm#xref_2.md) recovered his magic pearl? I will tell
you. [3](ltw291.htm#xref_3.md)

"The Yellow Emperor once travelled round the north of the Red Sea, and
climbed to the summit of the Kuenlun mountains. On his return to the
southward he lost his magic pearl. He besought his wits to find it, but
in vain. He besought his sight to find it, but in vain. He besought his
eloquence to find it, but that was also in vain. At last he besought
Nothing, and Nothing recovered it. 'How extraordinary!' exclaimed the
Yellow Emperor, 'that Nothing should be able to recover it!' Do you
understand me, young man?"

"I think this pearl was his soul," I answered, "and that knowledge,
sight and speech do but cloud the soul rather than enlighten it; and
that it was only in the peace of perfect quietude that his soul's
consciousness was restored to the Yellow Emperor. Is it so, Master?"

"Quite right; you have felt it as it is. And do you know, too, by whom
this beautiful legend is told?"

"I am young and ignorant; I do not know."

"It is by Chuang-Tse, the disciple of Laotzu, China's greatest
philosopher. It was neither Confucius nor Mencius who spoke the purest
wisdom in this country, but Laotzu. He was the greatest, and Chuang-Tse
was his apostle. You foreigners cherish, I know, a certain well-meaning
admiration for Laotzu also, but I think but few of you know that he was
the purest human being who ever breathed.--Have you read the
'Tao-Teh-King'? and have you ever considered, I wonder, what he meant by
'Tao'?"

"I should be grateful if you would tell me Master."

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

"I think I may well instruct you, young man. It is many years since I
have had a pupil, and I see in your eyes no curiosity, but rather a pure
desire of wisdom, for the freeing of your soul. Listen
then. [4](ltw291.htm#xref_4.md)

"Tao is really nothing but that which you Westerns call 'God.' Tao is
the One; the beginning and the end. It embraces all things, and to it
all things return.

"Laotzu wrote at the commencement of his book the sign: Tao. But what he
actually meant--the Highest, the One--can have no name, can never be
expressed in any sound, just because it is The One. Equally inadequate
is your term 'God.'--Wu--Nothing--that is Tao. You do not understand
me?--Listen further! There exists, then, an absolute Reality--without
beginning, without end--which we cannot comprehend, and which therefore
must be to us as Nothing. That which we *are* able to comprehend, which
has for us a relative reality, is in truth only appearance. It is an
outgrowth, a result of absolute reality, seeing that everything emanates
from, and returns to, that reality. But things which are real to us are
not real in themselves. What we call Being is in fact Not-Being, and
just what we call Not-Being is Being in its true sense. So that we are
living in a great obscurity. What we imagine to be real is not real, and
yet emanates from the real, for the Real is the Whole. Both Being and
Not-Being are accordingly Tao. But above all never forget that 'Tao' is
merely a sound uttered by a human being, and that *the idea is
essentially inexpressible*. All things appreciable to the senses and all
cravings of the heart are unreal. Tao is the source of Heaven and Earth.
One begat Two, Two

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

begat Three, Three begat Millions. And Millions return again into One.

"If you remember this well, young man, you have passed the first gateway
on the path of Wisdom.

"You know, then, that Tao is the source of everything; of the trees, the
flowers, the birds; of the sea, the desert, and the rocks; of light and
darkness; of heat and cold; of day and night; of summer and winter, and
of your own life. Worlds and oceans evaporate in Eternity. Man rises out
of the darkness, laughs in the glimmering light, and disappears. But in
all these changes the One is manifested. Tao is in everything. Your soul
in her innermost is Tao.--

"You see the world outspread before you, young man? . . ."

With a stately gesture he pointed seawards.

The hills on either side stood fast, uncompromising, clear-set in the
atmosphere--like strong thoughts, petrified, hewn out by conscious
energy--yielding only in the distance to the tender influence of light
and air. On a very high point stood a lonely little tree, of delicate
leafage, in a high light. The evening began to fall, with tender
serenity; and a rosy glow, dreamy yet brilliant, lent to the mountains,
standing ever more sharply defined against it, an air of peaceful
joyousness. In it all was to be felt a gentle upward striving, a still
poising, as in the rarefied atmosphere of conscious piety. And the sea
crept up softly, with a still-swaying slide--with the quiet,
irresistible approach of a type of infinity. The sail of a little
vessel, gleaming softly golden, glided nearer. So tiny it looked on that
immense ocean--so fearless and lovely! All was pure--no trace of
foulness anywhere.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

And I spoke with the rare impulse of a mighty joy.

"I feel it now, O Master! That which I seek is everywhere. I had no need
to seek it in the distance; for it is quite close to me. It is
everywhere--what I seek, what I myself am, what my soul is. It is
familiar to me as my own self. It is all revelation! God is everywhere!
Tao is in everything!"

"That is so, boy, but confuse it not! In that which you see is Tao, but
Tao is not what you see. You must not think that Tao is visible to your
eyes. Tao will neither waken joy in your heart nor draw your tears. For
all your experiences and emotions are relative and not real.

"However, I will speak no more of that at present. You stand as yet but
at the first gate, and see but the first glint of dawn. It is already
much that you should realize Tao as present in everything. It will
render your life more natural and confident--for, believe me, you lie as
safe in the arms of Tao as a child in the arms of its mother. And it
will make you serious and thoughtful too, for you will feel yourself to
be in all places as holy a thing as is a good priest in his temple. No
longer will you be frightened by the changes in things, by life and
death; for you know that death, as well as life, emanates from Tao. And
it is so natural that Tao, which pervaded your life, should also after
death continually surround you.

"Look at the landscape before you! The trees, the mountains, the sea,
they are your brothers, like the air and the light. Observe how the sea
is approaching us! So spontaneously, so naturally, so purely 'because so
it must be.'--Do you see your dear sister the little tree on yonder
point, bending towards you? and the simple

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

movement of her little leaves?--Then I will speak to you of
Wu-Wei, [5](ltw291.htm#xref_5.md) of 'non-resistance,' of 'self-movement'
on the breath of your impulse as it was born out of Tao. Men would be
true men if they would but let their lives flow of themselves, as the
sea heaves, as a flower blooms, in the simple beauty of Tao. In every
man there is an impulse towards that movement which, proceeding from
Tao, would urge him back to Tao again. But men grow blind through their
own senses and lusts. They strive for pleasure, desire, hate, fame and
riches. Their movements are fierce and stormy, their progress a series
of wild uprisings and violent falls. They hold fast to all that is
unreal. They desire too many things to allow of their desiring the One.
They desire, too, to be wise and good, and what is worst of all, They
desire to know too much.

"The one remedy is: the return to the source whence they came. In us is
Tao. Tao is rest. Only by renunciation of desire--even the desire for
goodness or wisdom--can we attain rest. Oh! all this craving to know
what Tao is! And this painful struggle for . words in which to express
it and to inquire after it!--The truly wise follow the Teaching which is
wordless which remains unexpressed. [6](ltw291.htm#xref_6.md) And who shall
ever express it? Those who know it (what Tao is) tell it not; those who
tell it know it not. [7](ltw291.htm#xref_7.md) Even I shall not tell you
what Tao is. Yourself must discover it in that you free yourself from
all your passions and cravings, and live in utter spontaneity, void of
unnatural striving. Gently must Tao be approached, with a motion
reposeful as the movement of that broad ocean. That moves, not because
it chooses to move, nor because it knows that it is wise or good to
move; it moves involuntarily,

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

unconscious of movement. Thus will you also return to Tao, and when you
are returned you will know it not, for you yourself will be Tao."

He ceased speaking, and looked at me gently. His eyes shone with a quiet
light, still and even as the tint of the heavens.

"Father," I said, "what you say is beautiful as the sea, and it seems
simple as nature; but surely it is not so easy--this strifeless,
inactive absorption of man into Tao?"

"Do not confuse words one with another," he replied. "By
strifelessness--Wu-Wei--Laotzu did not mean common inaction,--not mere
idling, with closed eyes. He meant: relaxation from earthly activity,
from desire--from the craving for unreal things. But he *did* exact
activity in *real* things. He implied a powerful movement of the soul,
which must be freed from its gloomy body like a bird from its cage. He
meant a yielding to the inner motive-force which we derive from Tao and
which leads us to Tao again. And, believe me: this movement is as
natural as that of the cloud above us. . . ."

High in the blue ether over our heads were golden clouds, sailing slowly
towards the sea. They gleamed with a wonderful purity, as of a high and
holy love. Softly, softly they were floating away.

"In a little while they will be gone, vanished in the infinity of the
heavens," said the hermit, "and you will see nothing but the eternal
blue. Thus will your soul be absorbed into Tao."

"My life is full of sins," I answered; "I am heavily burdened with
darkening desires. And so are my benighted fellow-men. How can *our*
life ever--thus

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

ethereally, in its purest essence--float towards Tao? It is so heavy
with evil, it must surely sink back into the mire."

"Do not believe it, do not believe it!" he exclaimed, smiling in
gracious kindliness. "No man can annihilate Tao, and there shines in
each one of us the inextinguishable light of the soul. Do not believe
that the evilness of humanity is so great and so mighty. The eternal Tao
dwells in all; in murderers and harlots as well as in philosophers and
poets. All bear within them an indestructible treasure, and not one is
better than another. You cannot love the one in preference to the other;
you cannot bless the one and damn the other. They are as alike in
essence as two grains of sand on this rock. And not one will be banished
out of Tao eternally, for all bear Tao within them. Their sins are
illusive, having the vagueness of vapours. Their deeds are a false
seeming; and their words pass away like ephemeral dreams. They cannot be
'bad,' they cannot be 'good' either. Irresistibly they are drawn to Tao,
as yonder waterdrop to the great sea. It may last longer with some than
with others, that is all. And a few centuries--what matter they in the
face of Eternity?--Poor friend! Has your sin made you so fearful? Have
you held your sin to be mightier than Tao? Have you held the sin of men
to be mightier than Tao?--You have striven to be good overmuch, and so
have seen your own misdoing in a falsely clear light. You have desired
overmuch goodness in your fellow-men also, and therefore has their sin
unduly troubled you. But all this is a seeming. Tao is neither good nor
bad. For Tao is real. Tao alone *is*; and the life of all unreal things
is a life of

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

false contrasts and relations, which have no independent existence, and
do greatly mislead. So, above all, do not desire to be good, neither
call yourself bad. Wu-Wei--unstriving, self-impelled--that must you be.
Not bad--not good; not little--and not great; not low--and not high. And
only then will you in reality *be*, even whilst, in the ordinary sense
you are not. When once you are free from all seeming, from all craving
and lusting, then will you move of your own impulse, without so much as
knowing that you move; and this, the only true life-principle--this
free, untrammelled motion towards Tao--will be light and unconscious as
the dissolution of the little cloud above you."

I experienced a sudden sense of freedom. The feeling was not joy--not
happiness. It was rather a gentle sense of expansion--a widening of my
mental horizon.

"Father," I said, "I thank you! This revelation of Tao lends me already
an impulse which, though I cannot explain it, yet seems to bear me
gently forward.

"How wonderful is Tao! With all my wisdom--with all my knowledge, I have
never felt this before!"

"Crave not thus for wisdom!" said the philosopher. "Do not desire to
know too much--so only shall you grow to know intuitively; for the
knowledge acquired by unnatural striving only leads away from Tao.
Strive not to know all there is to know concerning the men and things
around you, nor--and this more especially--concerning their relations
and antagonisms. Above all, seek not happiness too greedily, and be not
fearful of unhappiness. For neither of these is real. Joy is not real,
nor pain either. Tao would not be

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Tao, were you able
to picture it to yourself as pain, as joy, as happiness or unhappiness;
for Tao is One Whole, and in it no discords may exist. Hear how simply
it is expressed by Chuang-Tse: 'The greatest joy is no joy.' And pain
too will have vanished for you! You must never believe pain to be a real
thing, an essential element of existence. Your pain will one day vanish
as the mists vanish from the mountains. For one day you will realize how
natural, how spontaneous are all facts of existence; and all the great
problems which have held for you mystery and darkness will become
Wu-Wei, quite simple, non-resistant, no longer a source of marvel to
you. For everything grows out of Tao, everything is a natural part of
the great system developed from a single principle.--Then nothing will
have power to trouble you nor to rejoice you more. You will laugh no
more, neither will you weep.--I see you look up doubtfully, as though
you found me too hard, too cold. Nevertheless, when you are somewhat
further advanced you will realize that *this* it means, to be in perfect
sympathy with Tao. Then, looking upon 'pain,' you will know that one day
it must disappear, because it is unreal; and looking upon 'joy,' you
will understand that it is but a primitive and shadowy joy, dependent
upon time and circumstance, and deriving its apparent existence from
contrast with pain. Looking upon a goodly man, you will find it wholly
natural that he should be as he is, and will experience a foreshadowing
of how much goodlier he will be in that day when he shall no longer
represent the 'kind' and 'good.' And upon a murderer you will look with
all calmness, with neither special love nor special hate; for he is your
fellow in Tao,

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

and all his sin is powerless to annihilate Tao within him. Then, for the
first time, when you are Wu-Wei at last--not, in the common human sense,
existing--then all will be well with you, and you will glide through
your life as quietly and naturally as the great sea before us. Naught
will ruffle your peace. Your sleep will be dreamless, and consciousness
of self will bring no care. [8](ltw291.htm#xref_8.md) You will see Tao in
all things, be one with all existence, and look round on the whole of
nature as on something with which you are intimate as with yourself. And
passing with calm acceptance through the changes of day and night,
summer and winter, life and death, you will one day enter into Tao,
where there is no more change, and whence you issued once as pure as you
now return."

"Father, what you say is clear--and compels belief. But life is still so
dear to me, and I am afraid of death; I am afraid too lest my friends
should die, or my wife, or my child! Death seems to me so black and
gloomy--and life is bright--bright--with the sun, and the green and
flowery earth!"

"That is because you fail as yet to feel the perfect naturalness of
death, which is equal in reality to that of life. You think too much of
the insignificant body, and the deep grave in which it must lie; but
that is the feeling of a prisoner about to be freed, who is troubled at
the thought of leaving the dark cell where he has lived so long. You see
death in contrast to life; and both are unreal--both are a changing and
a seeming. Your soul does not glide out of a familiar sea into an
unfamiliar ocean. That which is real in you, your soul, can never pass
away, and this fear is no part of her. You must conquer this fear for
ever; or,

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

better still, it will happen when you are older, and have lived
spontaneously, naturally, following the motions of Tao, that you will of
your own accord cease to feel it. . . . Neither will you then mourn for
those who have gone home before you; with whom you will one day be
reunited--not knowing, yourself, that you are reunited to them, because
these contrasts will no longer be apparent to you. . . .

". . . . It came to pass once upon a time that Chuang-Tse's wife died,
and the widower was found by Hui-Tse sitting calmly upon the ground,
passing the time, as was his wont, in beating upon a gong. When Hui-Tse
rallied him upon the seeming indifference of his conduct, Chuang-Tse
replied:

"Thy way of regarding things is unnatural. At first, it is true, I was
troubled--I could not be otherwise. But after some pondering I reflected
that originally she was not of this life, being not only not born, but
without form altogether; and that into this formlessness no life-germ
had as yet penetrated. That nevertheless, as in a sun-warmed furrow,
life-energy then began to stir; out of life-energy grew form, and form
became birth. To-day another change has completed itself, and she has
died. This resembles the rise and fall of the four seasons: spring,
autumn, winter, summer. She sleeps calmly in the Great House. Were I now
to weep and wail, it were to act as though the soul of all this had not
entered into me,--therefore I do it no more.'" [9](ltw291.htm#xref_9.md)

This he told in a simple, unaffected manner that showed how natural it
appeared to him. But it was not yet clear to me, and I said:

"I find this wisdom terrible; it almost makes me

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

afraid. Life would seem to me so cold and empty, were I as wise as
this."

"Life *is* cold and empty," he answered, quietly, but with no trace of
contempt in his tone;--"and men are as deceptive as life itself. There
is not one who knows himself, not one who knows his fellows; and yet
they are all alike. There is, in fact, no such thing as life; it is
unreal."

I could say no more, and stared before me into the twilight. The
mountains were sleeping peacefully in the tender, bloom-like shimmer of
vague night-mists--lying lowly, like children, beneath the broad
heavens. Below us was an indistinct twinkling of little red lights. From
the distance rose a sad monotonous song, the wail of a flute
accompanying it. In the depths of the darkness lay the sea in its
majesty and the sound of infinitude swelled far and wide.

Then there arose in me a great sadness, and my eyes filled, as with
passionate insistence I asked him: "And what of friendship, then?--and
what of love?"

He looked at me. I could not see him plainly in the darkness, but there
shone from his eyes a curious soft light, and he answered gently:

"These are the best things in life, by very far. They are one with the
first stirring of Tao within you. But one day you will know of them as
little as the stream knows of its banks when it is lost in the endless
ocean. Think not that I would teach you to banish love from your heart;
for that would be to go against Tao. Love what you love, and be not
misled by the thought that love is a hindrance which holds you in
bondage. To banish love from your heart

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

would be a mad and earthly action, and would put you further away from
Tao than you have ever been. I say only, that love will one day vanish
of itself without your knowing, and that Tao is not Love. But forget
not, that--so far as I desire it, and so far as it is good for you--I am
speaking to you of the very highest things. Were I only speaking of this
life and of men, I should say: Love is the highest of all. But for him
who is absorbed again into Tao, love is a thing past and forgotten.

"Now, it has grown late, and I would not impart too much to you at
first. You will surely desire to sleep within the Temple, and I will
prepare your couch. Come with me--and descend the mountain with all
caution!"

He lit a little light, and held out his hand to lead me. Slowly we
proceeded, step by step. He was as careful of me as though I had been
his child; he lighted my path at every steep descent, and led me gently
forward, taking heed of all my movements.

When we arrived at the foot, he showed me the little guest-chamber set
apart for mandarins, [10](ltw291.htm#xref_10.md) and fetched pillow and
covering for me.

"I thank you, Father, from my heart!" I said. "When shall I ever be able
to show my gratitude?"

He looked at me quietly, and the glance was great, like the sea. Calm he
was, and gentle as night. He smiled at me, and it was like the light
laughing upon the earth. And silently he left me.
