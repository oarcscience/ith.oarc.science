### TWENTY

Abandon your acquired learning and do not regret the loss. There is very
little difference between 'yes' and 'no', but what a vast difference
between a good man and a wicked man. There are some things (like
suffering and death) which are universally feared and which it is
natural to fear, but woe to those ignorant people who desire and grasp
after amusements and defilements (the very things that cause suffering
and death) . People are busy with enjoyments as if they were celebrating
a feast day, or as if they were flocking to the games. I, alone, am as
fresh as the morning air, as pure as a babe in its mother's arms, as
free as a homeless wanderer. Other people are admired and envied because
of their cleverness; I, alone, am neglected. Am I (because of this)
foolish at heart? No! Let them be as smart and aggressive as ever; I am
content to remain retiring and obscure. Let them continue to be as
sensible and prudent as ever; let me remain as neglected as a deaf-mute.

Nevertheless, I am as pure as the water in the ocean and as free as the
driftwood upon its bosom. Let others

have their means for acquiring wealth, I am content to be counted
foolish and inefficient. I seem to stand in contrast to common people,
empty and foolish, but I am nourished by food from Mother TAO.
