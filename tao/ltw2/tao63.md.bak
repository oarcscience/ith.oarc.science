### SIXTY-THREE

A man's first duty is to practice *wu-wei* and make use of his quiet
hours to gain enlightenment. One should early learn to find sweetness in
tasteless things; to discover greatness in small things; to be satisfied
with few things.

One should respond to hatred with kindness; he should treat little
affairs as though they were important. All the world's difficulties
arise from slight causes,

and all the world's great affairs have risen from small beginnings.

Therefore, the perfect Sage never asserts his greatness and by so doing
attains to true greatness. Rash promises are easily made, but the
simpler a thing looks, the harder it is to accomplish. This is a common
experience, therefore the perfect Sage considers everything difficult
and so to the end has no difficulties.
