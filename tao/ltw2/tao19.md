### NINETEEN

When people abandon the idea of becoming a sage and give up ambition for
worldly knowledge and learning, then their innate goodness will have a
chance to manifest itself and will develop a hundredfold. When there is
no activity of thinking to interfere, there is nothing that the mind can
not accomplish in the way of good self-development. If ideas of
benevolence

and righteousness are abandoned, then people will return naturally to
the primal virtues of filial piety and parental affection. If craftiness
and acquisitiveness are abandoned, then theft and robbery will naturally
disappear.

The reason why I refer to this is because of the deficiency of these
primal virtues in our present culture. Let us restrain our sensual
desires and egoism and return to simplicity and naturalness.
