<p>Not going out of the door, the sage has knowledge of the world. Not looking through the window, he perceives the TAO of heaven. The more one wanders about among objective things, the less he understands.</p>  
<p>Therefore, the perfect Sage does not think about worldly affairs, but he understands the significance of all things. He does not boast of his ability, but his name is world famous. He' works but without grasping and, therefore succeeds in whatever he undertakes.</p>
