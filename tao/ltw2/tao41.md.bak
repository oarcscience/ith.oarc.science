### FORTY-ONE

The superior man, as soon as he listens to TAO, earnestly practices TAO;
an average man, hearing of TAO, sometimes remembers it and sometimes
forgets it; an inferior man, hearing of TAO, ridicules it. If it were
not thus ridiculed it would not be worth following as TAO.

There is an old saying:--"Those who are illuminated by TAO are the most
obscure; those who are advanced in TAO are the most timid; those who are
indifferent to TAO are the most distinguished." The Teh of TAO resembles
a deep valley; the most innocent appears to be most ashamed; the highest
in teh appears the humblest; the most firmly established in teh appears
the most remiss; the most straightforward seems to be the most fickle;
the greatest polygon has no corners; the finest instrument is the latest
to

be perfected; the largest bell sounds rarely; the grandest phenomena are
the inconceivable phenomena of spirit.

TAO is unseen and inscrutable. Nevertheless, it is precisely this TAO
that alone can give and accomplish.
