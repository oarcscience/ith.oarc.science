### THREE

If the perfect Sage would have his people give up their rivalries, he
should not praise the competent ones. If he would have his people keep
away from robbery and theft, he should not value precious things
himself. If he would keep his mind undisturbed he should not look at
desirable things. Thus the administration of the perfect Sage is
designed to remove the desires of his people. He supplies them only with
suitable nourishment and lessens their individual ideas by strengthening
the common physical health. He ever

tries to keep his people in ignorance and desirelessness so as to
prevent the brainy ones from undertaking trouble-making activities. So
long as he governs his people by the principle of *wu-wei*
(non-assertion, or non-compulsion), things naturally arrange themselves
into social order.
