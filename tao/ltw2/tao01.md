### TAO-TEH-KING

### ONE

The TAO that can be "tao-ed" can not be the infinite TAO (that is, the
way that can be followed can not be the ultimate, pathless Way) . It is
the same with the name of things: if things are explicable, the names we
give them can not be the original Name. (That is) The course of the
universe is hidden in non-existence; existence is only the mother of its
evolution.

Since human beings are a small likeness of the great Universe, they can
only realize their Taohood by making close imitations of it. Before one
can attain the supreme perfection of Taohood, he must first realize its
inmost mystery, that is, he must enter the door of this mystery of
mysteries.

There are two ways for effecting this realization, both of which can be
followed by the human organism. One way to realize the wonderful mystery
of TAO is to put away all thoughts and desires. The other way is to
concentrate both true intention and sincere devotion. These two ways of
realization have different names but they both lead to a realization of
the mystery that we call TAO.
