### SIXTY-NINE

It is taught in books of strategy: "Never be so rash as to start a war;
at first, always be on the defense." "One should hesitate to advance an
inch but be always ready to withdraw a foot." This means that it is
better for an army to advance by craft rather than by aggressive
operations. (It means for everybody) that there is a better way of
attack than by hands, a better way of winning than by hostility, a
better way of gaining than by resort to force. There is no greater
mistake than to make light of an enemy. By-making light of an enemy many
a kingdom has been lost. When well matched armies come to conflict, the
army that regrets the hostility between them, always conquers.
