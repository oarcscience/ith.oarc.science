### SIXTY-FIVE

In the olden days, those who were well versed in the principle of TAO,
avoided teaching the people anything; instead they kept them in
ignorance. The reason why people are difficult to govern is because they
are educated. To govern a people by craftiness is a curse; to govern
them by the principle of *wu-wei* is a blessing. He who understands the
difference between these two ways of governing is a model ruler. If he
knows how to become a model ruler, he has gained profoundness of teh.

The profoundness of Teh is deep, indeed, and far reaching! Because it is
in harmony with the original nature of things, everything will be acting
according to the law of its nature.
