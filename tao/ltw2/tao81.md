### EIGHTY-ONE

Faithful words are often not pleasant; pleasant words are often not
faithful. Well informed men do not dispute; men who dispute are not well
informed. The wise man is not always learned; the learned man is not
always wise.

The perfect Sage does not keep things in possession or in memory, but
since he ever serves others he acquires the most after all. Since he
continually gives to others, he will possess the most in the end.

The TAO of Heaven always benefits and harms no one. The perfect Sage by
following TAO and serving others is never the cause of strife.
