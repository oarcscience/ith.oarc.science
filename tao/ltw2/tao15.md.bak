### FIFTEEN

In olden times those who were competent to be Masters were intelligent,
subtle, profound and spiritual. Their thoughts could not be easily
fathomed. Since their thoughts were hard to comprehend, I will try to
reveal their virtue by some explanation. They were as cautious as a man
crossing a river in winter; they were as suspicious as a man who fears
his neighbors; they were as circumspect as a guest in the presence of
his host; they were as ready to adapt themselves as ice at the point of
melting; they were as true and sound as the trunk of a perfect tree;
they were as open and broadminded as a spacious valley; their thoughts
were obscure like troubled waters.

Who can enlighten himself by slowly quieting the

troubled waters of his mind? After gaining calmness of mind by
concentration, who can gradually pass from its calmness into the
activities of life and always retain the same calmness of mind? Only
those who keep themselves from self-sufficiency and who control their
lives by the principle of TAO. Being free from self-sufficiency, their
spirit and energy will never fail, but will ever be refreshed and
renewed.
