### TWENTY-FOUR

He that stands on tiptoe can not long stand steady; he that is sitting
astride can not walk; he that is prejudiced can not become enlightened;
he that is self-assertive can not become distinguished; he that praises
himself will not be given credit by others; he that takes pride in
himself will not long be able to retain his safety and fame.

The comparison of these illustrations to TAO is like comparing offal to
food, or like comparing superficial manners with true sympathy of heart.
Even animals recognize the difference and show hatred. Therefore, one
who has attained Taohood will never manifest these egoistic qualities.
He will avoid thinking of himself and will remain humble at heart.
