### SEVENTY-THREE

Courage carried to recklessness leads to death, while courage restrained
and cautious leads to life. Of these two kinds of courage, one is
harmful and one is beneficial. Why this is so, why some things are
rejected by Heaven and some not, who can tell the reason? Therefore the
perfect Sage looks upon all things as puzzling (and does not interfere
with any).

The TAO of Heaven never seeks supremacy, yet

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

it is always supreme. It speaks not but it is perfectly responsive. It
issues no summons yet things come to it naturally. It appears to be open
and simple, but hidden from view is a profound design. Indeed, the
meshes of Heaven's net are wide, but no matter how wide or loose they
may appear nothing escapes.
