### SEVENTY-SEVEN

The TAO of Heaven resembles the stretching of a bow. The mighty it
humbles, the lowly it exalts; the overflowing it diminishes, the
insufficient it supplies.

The way of humans is not so. Humans take from the needy to further
enrich the rich. The one who can take from his over-abundance and give
to a needy world has attained Taohood. Therefore, the perfect Sage is
not sparing of his services, nor does he look upon them as meritorious,
nor does he make a display of them. Is this not so?
