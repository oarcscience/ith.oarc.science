### FIVE

Heaven and earth are not fallible and unjust like humans: they are
always impartial. They have no favorites in giving kindness to the
world: they give life to humans with the same impartiality they give
life to dogs and plants. The perfect sage is also impartial: he has no
prejudices that would lead him to like this one and dislike that one; he
treats all men as being of equal value. Moreover, there is nothing

between heaven and earth but vast space. Heaven and earth resemble a
bellows and a musical pipe: they are empty but inexhaustible; the more
one plays on them the more they give out. The babbler is constantly
being confounded but the dumb sage, constantly exercising concentration
of mind, is competent to meet every chance and circumstance.
