### SEVENTY-ONE

To recognize one's ignorance of unknowable things is mental health and
to be ignorant of knowable things is sickness. It is only by grieving
over knowable things that we are kept in mental health. The perfect Sage
is free from the mental sickness of common people, because he
understands his ignorance and grieves over it.
