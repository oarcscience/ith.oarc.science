### THIRTY-ONE

Both arms and armor are unblessed things. Not only men come to detest
them, but a curse seems to follow them. Therefore, the one who follows
the principle of TAO does not resort to arms. It is significant that in
peaceful times, the place of honor is on the left and in war times it is
on the right. For as arms are unblessed things, they are not the things
that men of good character resort to.

It is of first importance for a gentleman to preserve his serenity and
dignity; even when victorious, a good soldier does not rejoice, because
rejoicing over a victorious battle is the same as rejoicing over the
killing of men. If he rejoices over the killing of men, he will never be
victorious.

Thus, in propitious affairs, the place of honor is on the left, but in
unpropitious affairs, the right is the place of honor. In times of war,
lesser officers are on the left of the ranks, a place of honor, while
the commanding general is on the right, a place of less honor. This
means that war is considered as a funeral ceremony.

Therefore, in battle the killing of many men should be honored by
weeping and mourning, and the victor should be received as if he were
attending a funeral ceremony.
