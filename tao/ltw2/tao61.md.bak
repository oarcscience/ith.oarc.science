### SIXTY-ONE

A great state is like the current of a river; it is always flowing down
the lower valleys. There is a bond of unity, also, in a great state that
draws its people together, like the attraction of male to female.

The female wins the favor of a male by her quietude and quietude is
always submissive. Thus a great state by its service to smaller states
wins their allegiance. A smaller state by its submission to a great
state wins an influence over it. Thus one wins by condescension, and the
other by submission, and their interests are mutually conserved.

The great state likes to federate more states and have more people; the
small state to guard its safety is willing to submit to the greater and
enter its federation. Each by the same procedure gains its particular

end. So it is a good policy for a great state to lead the way by itself
first practicing humility.
