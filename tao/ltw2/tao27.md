### TWENTY-SEVEN

Good walkers need no guides; good speakers do not blame or reproach
others; good managers need no rules nor diagrams; good locksmiths are
competent to open any lock; good binders can unloose any kind of knot.

It is the same with the perfect Sage: he is always competent in giving
advice to his people, so that not one becomes an outcast. He is
competent in using things, so that nothing is useless to him. His
insight detects hidden values. Therefore the competent man is the master
of the incompetent, and the incompetent

are as hands and feet to the competent. The incompetent who does not
esteem his master and the competent who does not protect his hands and
feet, though he otherwise be intelligent, is acting foolishly. Herein
lies the value of intelligence.
