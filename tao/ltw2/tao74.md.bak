### SEVENTY-FOUR

If people do not fear death, how can they be frightened by the death
penalty? If people are afraid of death, I would seize the one who is not
afraid of death and execute him. After that who would dare to disobey?

There is always an experienced officer to execute murderers. If an
inexperienced person takes his place, it would be like an unskilled man
taking the place of a skilled carpenter at his hewing: he is very likely
to cut himself.
