### THIRTY-SIX

Before one can contract a thing, it must first be extended; before
anything can be weakened, it must first be made strong; before anything
can be wasted, it must be present; before one can take a thing by force,
someone else must give it up. This is the profound principle which
explains why the humble and yielding conquer the selfish and strong.

A fish should not be removed from its natural home in the deep pond,
neither should the authority of the nation be entrusted to anyone, not
even to the king's favorite.
