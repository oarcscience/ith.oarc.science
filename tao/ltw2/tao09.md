### NINE

To stop one's desires is far better than to be continually satisfying
them. Desire is like a knife: if it is continually being sharpened, it
will soon wear away.

There are wealthy men with mansions filled with gold and jewels, but
they must be on the watch all the time to protect them. The pride of
wealth and position brings about its own destruction. As soon as one has
gained merit and fame, he should withdraw into retirement. This is the
TAO of Heaven.
