<p>Before one can contract a thing, it must first be extended; before anything can be weakened, it must first be made strong; before anything can be wasted, it must be present; before one can take a thing by force, someone else must give it up. This is the profound principle which explains why the humble and yielding conquer the selfish and strong.</p>  
<p>A fish should not be removed from its natural home in the deep pond, neither should the authority of the nation be entrusted to anyone, not even to the king's favorite.</p>
