### FORTY-TWO

TAO is inscrutable. From TAO proceeds the one (potentiality); one
produces two (the positive and negative principles); this makes three.
From these three proceed all things. All things thus bear the imprint of
the negative *yin* behind and embrace the positive *yang* in front. The
primal principle of potentiality, as it becomes active, brings the
negative and positive together and there is manifestation.

The things that are detested by common people, namely, to be called the
forlorn, the inferior, the unworthy, are the very things that kings and
princes take for titles. These are the very things that it is a gain to
lose and a loss to gain.

I am teaching the same thing which is taught by others; others have said
that the strong and aggressive do not come to natural deaths, but I make
this saying the basis of my teaching.
