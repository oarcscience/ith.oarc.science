### TWENTY-TWO

Time will show that the humblest will attain supremacy, the dishonored
will be justified, the empty will be filled, the old will be
rejuvenated, those content with little will be rewarded with much, and
those grasping much will fall into confusion.

Therefore, the perfect Sage who keeps his mind unified and humble will
become the master of the world. As he has no prejudices, he becomes
enlightened;

as he does not assert himself, he will become exalted; as he does not
praise himself, his merit will be recognized; as he is not proud of
himself, his fame will endure; inasmuch as he does not seek supremacy,
he will have no rivals.

True, indeed, is the old saying: "The humble will be exalted." Every
one, with sincerity, should take refuge in humility.
