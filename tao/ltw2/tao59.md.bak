### FIFTY-NINE

In governing people and in worshiping heaven, nothing surpasses the teh
of self-restraint. The restraint of desire is like returning to the
original TAO. Returning to one's origin means the recovery of one's
vitality. When one has recovered his original vitality, nothing is
unmanageable. If nothing is unmanageable then he retains his original
tranquillity because he is unconscious of any limits. When he retains
this state of tranquillity he may govern the country wisely. Moreover,
when he is in a state of tranquillity, he will govern the country as a
mother takes care of her children and by so doing long retain his
usefulness. He will be like a plant having a strong stem and deep roots.
He will manifest the longevity of TAO.
