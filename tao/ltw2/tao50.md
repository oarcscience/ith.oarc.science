### FIFTY

The moon from its first appearance to full moon, is in a state of
appearing; from its fullness to its disappearance, it is in a state of
disappearing. It is just the same with the life of a man:. from babyhood
to manhood he is growing up; from manhood to old age, he is failing.
What does this signify? It means that it is only the spirit of man that
shares the longevity of heaven and earth and, of all things heaven and
earth are endowed with perennial vitality.

Thus it may be said that those who have attained mastery over their
spirit, and thus have set free this perennial vitality, when traveling
will never suffer harm from rhinoceros or tiger, or in battle without
weapons or armor, because the rhinoceros will find no place to horn him,
nor the tiger for its claws, nor will soldiers wound him. Why is this
so? Because his spirit transcends mortality.
