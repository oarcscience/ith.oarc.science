### TWENTY-EIGHT

He who realizes the foolishness of passionate action always keeps his
mind concentrated and tranquil. Just as the valleys, because of their
lowness, become the source of rivers, so the perfect Sage because of his
characteristic humility returns to the simplicity of a little child.

He who realizes the true way of conserving his spirit will take good
care of his body. Thereby he becomes an example to the world. His
original vitality will never fail, and more, will return to its origin.

He who realizes the dignity of his personality, but retains his
humility, is like the lowly valley. Being like a valley, he becomes
filled with the original vitality and reverts to his original nature.
But when he forsakes humility, he merely becomes cultivated and useful.
The perfect Sage employs these cultivated and useful men to become his
officials and chiefs. Therefore a good administrator makes no reforms
that will destroy the natural simplicity of his people.
