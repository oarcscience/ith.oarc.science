### FORTY-SEVEN

Not going out of the door, the sage has knowledge of the world. Not
looking through the window, he perceives the TAO of heaven. The more one
wanders about among objective things, the less he understands.

Therefore, the perfect Sage does not think about worldly affairs, but he
understands the significance of all things. He does not boast of his
ability, but his name is world famous. He' works but without grasping
and, therefore succeeds in whatever he undertakes.
