### ELEVEN

There are thirty spokes in a wheel, but its utility lies in the hole of
the hub. The potter forms the clay into jars, but their usefulness
depends upon the enclosed space. A carpenter builds the walls of a house
and cuts out windows and doors, but the value of the house is measured
by the space within the walls. Thus it may be said that existence is for
accommodation but non-existence is for utility.
