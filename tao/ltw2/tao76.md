### SEVENTY-SIX

When a baby is born it is tender and fragile; when it grows to be a man
and dies, it becomes hard and

stiff. It is the same with everything. Herbs and trees when young and
growing are tender and delicate, but when they become old and die, they
become rigid and hard.

Therefore, those who are stiff and unyielding belong to the domain of
death, while the tender and sympathetic belong to the realm of life.
Those who are ruthless in battle do not gain the victory. When a tree
becomes hard and rigid, it will soon decay. The large and hard are put
at the bottom, the tender and delicate are placed on top.
