### TWENTY-NINE

If anyone desires to take and remake the empire under his own reforming
plans, he will never be successful. The empire is a spiritual thing that
cannot be remade after one's own ideas and he who attempts

it will only make a failure. Even he who tries to hold it will lose it.

Under any system of holding or remaking the empire, the king must make
use of different people and things; some of whom are honorable and
precious and others are of less degree; some will be leaders and some
will be only ornamental; some will be followers and some servants. Some
people or things are strong and can be depended upon, others are fragile
and will break or must be thrown away.

Therefore, the perfect Sage does not seek to take and remake the empire.
He does not seek to enforce his own ideas upon it, but is content to
give up extravagant comforts and indulgent egoism himself and thus to
set the nation an example of returning to simplicity.
