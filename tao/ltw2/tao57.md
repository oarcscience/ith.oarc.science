### FIFTY-SEVEN

An empire is best administered by justice, an army by craft, and
influence over people is gained by noninterference. The more people
become selfish, the more the state is in disorder. The more people
become artful and cunning, the more abnormal things become. The more
laws and orders are multiplied, the more theft and violence increase.

Therefore, the perfect Sage reasons: If I practice *wu-wei*, that is,
non-interference, the people will restrain themselves naturally. If I
set an example of good behavior, people of themselves will become
tranquil and prosperous naturally.

If I have no selfish desires myself, other people will become unselfish
and simple.
