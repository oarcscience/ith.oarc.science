### SEVENTY-TWO

When people are too ignorant to fear the things that are really fearful
(greed, illusion and self-assertion), the greatest fear (of death) will
soon overpower them. Do not be troubled because of the narrowness of
your dwelling, do not become depressed because of the life you are
compelled to live. If people cease to worry about their surroundings and
their lives, their minds will become tranquil.

Therefore, the perfect Sage understands himself but never exhibits
himself; he cherishes but never overvalues himself. He discards
ostentation and pride, but keeps understanding and mindfulness.
