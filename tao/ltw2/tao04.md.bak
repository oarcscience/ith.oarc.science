### FOUR

TAO is invisible but permeates everywhere; no matter how one uses it or
how much, it is never exhausted. It is wise for us to imitate its
profoundness; that is, to keep ourselves in quiet confidence as being
the unfailing source of all things. We should hide our wits and
competencies; we should free ourselves from worldly entanglements; keep
ourselves always in humility and courtesy; becoming ever more socialized
and personally disinterested.

Should we attain all of these conditions, we would become as still and
as transparent as the pure water of a spring. Then we would not
recognize any spiritual forefather because no one would be worthy to be
our ancestor except the perfect Father, the Great TAO.
