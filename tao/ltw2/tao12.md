### TWELVE

If a man indulges his desire for looking at the five beautiful colors,
his perception of their beauty will become dull; if a man indulges a
desire for listening to the five musical tones, his perception of their
music

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

will become dulled; if he indulges a desire for the five pleasant
tastes, his perception of their deliciousness will become dull. If a man
indulges a desire for racing and hunting, he will lose his appreciation
of tranquillity and may become mad. So it is with the lure of hidden
treasure that tempts a man to do evil.

Therefore the perfect Sage aims at usefulness and is not deceived by the
illusions of sense. A man in hunger desires food to satisfy his hunger
and is little concerned by its beauty and delicacy.
