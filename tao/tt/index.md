Lieh-Tzü was major Taoist sage who lived c. 350 BCE. His writings use
stories and fables to elucidate the Taoist philosophy of cooperating
with nature; they illustrate the magical powers of the ancient sages who
were so 'in the Tao' that they were able to prolong life, walk through
solid rock, and levitate.
