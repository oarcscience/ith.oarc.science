# Introduction

The history of Taoist philosophy may be conveniently divided into three
stages: the primitive stage, the stage of development, and the stage of
degeneration. The first of these stages is only known to us through the
medium of a single semi-historical figure, the philosopher Lao Tzu,
whose birth is traditionally assigned to the year 604 B.C. Some would
place the beginnings of Taoism much earlier than this, and consequently
regard Lao Tzu rather as an expounder than as the actual founder of the
system; just as Confucianism--that is, a moral code based on filial
piety and buttressed by altruism and righteousness--may be said to have
flourished long before Confucius. The two cases, however, are somewhat
dissimilar. The teachings of Lao Tzu, as preserved in the *Tao Tê
Ching*, are not such as one can easily imagine being handed down from
generation to generation among the people at large. The principle on
which they are based is simple enough, but their application to everyday
life is surrounded by difficulties. It is hazardous to assert that any
great system of philosophy has sprung from the brain of one man; but the
assertion is probably as true of Taoism as of any other body of
speculation.

Condensed into a single phrase, the injunction of Lao {p. 10} Tzu to
mankind is, 'Follow Nature.' This is a good practical equivalent for the
Chinese expression, 'Get hold of Tao', although 'Tao' does not exactly
correspond to the word Nature, as ordinarily used by us to denote the
sum of phenomena in this ever-changing universe. It seems to me,
however, that the conception of Tao must have been reached, originally,
through this channel. Lao Tzu, interpreting the plain facts of Nature
before his eyes, concludes that behind her manifold workings there
exists an ultimate Reality which in its essence is unfathomable and
unknowable, yet manifests itself in laws of unfailing regularity. To
this Essential Principle, this Power underlying the sensible phenomena
of Nature, he gives, tentatively and with hesitation, the name of Tao,
'the Way', though fully realizing the inadequacy of any name to express
the idea of that which is beyond all power of comprehension.

A foreigner, imbued with Christian ideas, naturally feels inclined to
substitute for Tao the term by which he is accustomed to denote the
Supreme Being--God. But this is only admissible if he is prepared to use
the term 'God' in a much broader sense than we find in either the Old or
the New Testament. That which chiefly impresses the Taoist in the
operations of Nature is their absolute impersonality. The inexorable law
of cause and effect seems to him equally removed from active goodness or
benevolence on the one hand, and from active, or malevolence on the
other. This is a fact which

{p. 11}

will hardly be disputed by any intelligent observer. It is when he
begins to draw inferences from it that the Taoist parts company from the
average Christian. Believing, as he does, that the visible Universe is
but a manifestation of the invisible Power behind It, he feels justified
in arguing from the known to the unknown, and concluding that, whatever
Tao may be in itself (which is unknowable), it is certainly not what we
understand by a personal God--not a God endowed with the specific
attributes of humanity, not even (and here we find a remarkable
anticipation of Hegel) a *conscious* God. In other words, Tao transcends
the illusory and unreal distinctions on which all human systems of
morality depend, for in it all virtues and vices coalesce into One.

The Christian takes a different view altogether. He prefers to ignore
the facts which Nature shows him, or else he reads them in an arbitrary
and one-sided manner. His God, if no longer anthropomorphic, is
undeniably anthropopathic. He is a personal Deity, now loving and
merciful, now irascible and jealous, a Deity who is open to prayer and
entreaty. With qualities such as these, it is difficult to see how he
can be regarded as anything but a glorified Man. Which of these two
views--the Taoist or the Christian--it is best for mankind to hold, may
be a matter of dispute. There can be no doubt which is the more logical.

The weakness of Taoism lies in its application to the conduct of life.
Lao Tzu was not content to be a

{p. 12}

metaphysician merely, he aspired to be a practical reformer as well. It
was man's business, he thought, to model himself as closely as possible
on the great Exemplar, Tao. It follows as a matter of course that his
precepts are mostly of a negative order, and we are led straight to the
doctrine of Passivity or Inaction, which was bound to be fatally
misunderstood and perverted. Lao Tzu's teaching has reached us, if not
in its original form, yet in much of its native purity, in the *Tao Tê
Ching*. One of the most potent arguments for the high antiquity of this
marvellous little treatise is that it shows no decided trace of the
corruption which is discernible in the second of our periods,
represented for us by the writings of Lieh Tzu and Chuang Tzu. I have
called it the period of development because of the extraordinary
quickening and blossoming of the buds of Lao Tzu's thought in the supple
and imaginative minds of these two philosophers. The canker, alas! is
already at the heart of the flower; but so rich and luxuriant is the
feast of colour before us that we hardly notice it as yet.

Very little is known of our author beyond what he tells us himself. His
full name was Lieh Yü-k'ou, and it appears that he was living in the
Chêng State not long before the year 398 B.C., when the Prime Minister
Tzu Yang was killed in a revolution (see p. 101). He figures prominently
in the pages of Chuang Tzu, from whom we learn that he could 'ride upon
the wind'.\[1\] On the

{p. 13}

insufficient ground that he is not mentioned by the historian Ssu-ma
Ch'ien, a certain critic of the Sung dynasty was led to declare that
Lieh Tzu was only a fictitious personage invented by Chuang Tzu, and
that the treatise which passes under his name was a forgery of later
times. This theory is rejected by the compilers of the great Catalogue
of Ch'ien Lung's Library, who represent the cream of Chinese scholarship
in the eighteenth century.

Although Lieh Tzu's work has evidently passed through the hands of many
editors and gathered numerous accretions, there remains a considerable
nucleus which in all probability was committed to writing by Lieh Tzu's
immediate disciples, and is therefore older than the genuine parts of
Chuang Tzu. There are some obvious analogies between the two authors,
and indeed a certain amount of matter common to both; but on the whole
Lieh Tzu's book bears an unmistakable impress of its own. The geniality
of its tone contrasts with the somewhat hard brilliancy of Chuang Tzu,
and a certain kindly sympathy with the aged, the poor and the humble of
this life, not excluding the brute creation, makes itself felt
throughout. The opposition between Taoism and Confucianism is not so
sharp as we find it in Chuang Tzu, and Confucius himself is treated with
much greater respect. This alone is strong evidence in favour of the
priority of Lieh Tzu, for there is no doubt that the breach between the
two systems widened as time went on. Lieh Tzu's work is about half as
long as Chuang Tzu's, and is now divided into eight

{p. 14}

books. The seventh of these deals exclusively with the doctrine of the
egoistic philosopher Yang Chu, and has therefore been omitted altogether
from the present selection.

Nearly all the Taoist writers are fond of parables and allegorical
tales, but in none of them is this branch of literature brought to such
perfection as in Lieh Tzu, who surpasses Chuang Tzu himself as a master
of anecdote. His stories are almost invariably pithy and pointed. Many
of them evince not only a keen sense of dramatic effect, but real
insight into human nature. Others may appear fantastic and somewhat
wildly imaginative. The story of the man who issued out of solid rock
(p. 47) is a typical one of this class. It ends, however, with a streak
of ironical humour which may lead us to doubt whether Lieh Tzu himself
really believed in the possibility of transcending natural laws. His
soberer judgment appears in other passages, like the following: 'That
which has life must by the law of its being come to an end; and the end
can no more be avoided than the living creature can help having been
born. So that he who hopes to perpetuate his life or to shut out death
is deceived in his calculations.' That leaves little doubt as to the
light in which Lieh Tzu would have regarded the later Taoist
speculations on the elixir of life. Perhaps the best solution of the
problem is the theory I have already mentioned: that the 'Lieh Tzu'
which we possess now, while containing a solid and authentic core of the
Master's own teaching, has been

{p. 15}

overlaid with much of the decadent Taoism of the age that followed.

Of this third period little need be said here. It is represented in
literature by the lengthy treatise of Huai-nan Tzu, the spurious
episodes in Lieh Tzu and Chuang Tzu, and a host of minor writers, some
of whom tried to pass off their works as the genuine relics of ancient
sages. Chang Chan, an officer of the Banqueting Court under the Eastern
Chin dynasty (fourth century A.D.), is the author of the best commentary
on Lieh Tzu; extracts from it, placed between inverted commas, will be
found in the following pages. In the time of Chang Chan, although Taoism
as a philosophical system had long run its course, its development into
a national religion was only just beginning, and its subsequent
influence on literature and art is hardly to be over-estimated. It
supplied the elements of mystery, romance and colour which were needed
as a set-off against the uncompromising stiffness of the Confucian
ideal. For reviving and incorporating in itself the floating mass of
folklore and mythology which had come down from the earliest ages, as
well as for the many exquisite creations of its own fancy, it deserves
the lasting gratitude of the Chinese people.
