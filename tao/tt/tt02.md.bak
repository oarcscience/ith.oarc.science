# Editorial Note

The object of the Editor of this series is a very definite one. He
desires above all things that these books shall be the ambassadors of
good-will between East and West. He hopes that they will contribute to a
fuller knowledge of the great cultural heritage of the East, for only
through real understanding will the West be able to appreciate the
underlying Problems and aspirations of Asia to-day. He is confident that
a deeper knowledge of the great ideals and lofty philosophy of Eastern
thought will help to a revival of that true spirit of charity which
neither despises nor fears the nations of another creed and colour.
