# BOOK VII

### Causality

In the course of Lieh Tzu's instruction by Hu-ch'iu Tzu-lin, the latter
said to him: 'You must familiarize yourself with the theory of
consequents before you can talk of regulating conduct.' Lieh Tzu said:
'Will you explain what you mean by the theory of consequents?' 'Look at
your shadow,' said his Master, 'and then you will know.' Lieh turned and
looked at his shadow. When his body was bent, the shadow was crooked;
when his body was upright, the shadow was straight. Thus it appeared
that the attributes of straightness and crookedness were not inherent in
the shadow, but corresponded to certain positions of the body. Likewise,
contraction and extension are not inherent in the subject, but take
place in obedience to external causes. Holding this theory of
consequents is to be at home in the antecedent.

The Law of Causality is the foundation of all science.

Kuan Yin spoke to the Master Lieh Tzu, saying: 'If speech is sweet, the
echo will be sweet; if speech is harsh, the echo will be harsh. If the
body is long, the shadow will be long; if the body is short, the shadow
will be

{p. 97}

short. Reputation is like an echo, personal experiences like a shadow.

Hence the saying: "Heed your words, and they will meet with harmonious
response; heed your actions, and they will find agreeable accord."
Therefore, the Sage observes the origin in order to know the issue,
scrutinizes the past in order to know the future. Such is the principle
whereby he attains foreknowledge.

'The standard of conduct lies with one's own self; the testing of it
lies with other men. We are impelled to love those who love us, and to
hate those who hate us. T'ang and Wu loved the Empire, and therefore
each became King. Chieh and Chou hated the Empire, and therefore they
perished. Here we have the test applied. He who does not follow Tao when
standard and test are both clear may be likened to one who, when leaving
a house, does not go by the door, Or, when travelling abroad, does not
keep to the straight road. To seek profit in this way is surely
impossible.

'No one has ever profited himself by opposing natural law.'

'You may consider the virtues of Shen Nung and Yu. Yen, you may examine
the books of Yü, Hsia, Shang and Chou, you may weigh the utterances of
great teachers and sages, but you will find no instance of preservation
or destruction, fullness or decay, which has not obeyed this supreme
Law.'

{p. 98}

Of Causality.

Lieh Tzu learned archery and, when he was able to hit the target, he
asked the opinion of Kuan Yin Tzu on his shooting. 'Do you know *why*
you hit the target?' said Kuan Yin Tzu. 'No, I do not,' was the reply.
'Then you are not good enough yet,' rejoined Kuan Yin Tzu. Lieh Tzu
withdrew and practised for three years after which he again presented
himself. Kuan Yin Tzu asked, as before: 'Do you know *why* you hit the
target? 'Yes,' said Lieh Tzu, 'I do.' 'In that case, all is well. Hold
that knowledge fast, and do not let it slip.'

'Mental and bodily equilibrium are to be sought within oneself. Once you
know the causal process which makes you hit the target, you will be able
to determine the operation of Destiny beforehand, and when you let fly
you will make no mistake.'

The above principle does not apply only to shooting, but also to the
government of a State and to personal conduct. Therefore the Sage
investigates not the mere facts of preservation and destruction, but
rather the causes which bring them about.

\*         \*         \*

Lieh Tzu said: 'Those who excel in beauty become vain; those who excel
in strength become violent. To

{p. 99}

such, it is useless to speak of Tao. He who is not yet turning grey will
surely err if he but speak of Tao; how much less can he put it into
practice!

'No man will confide in one who shows himself aggressive. And he in whom
no man confides will remain solitary and without support.

'The arrogant and the aggressive will accept no confidences, even if
they are made. Their mental attitude to others is one of distrust, and
they keep their ears and eyes blocked. Who can render them assistance?'

'The wise man puts his trust in others: thus he reaches fullness of
years without decay, perfection of Wisdom without bewilderment. In the
government of a State, then, the hardest thing is to recognize the worth
of others, not to rely upon one's own.'

'If you succeed in recognizing worth, then the wise will think out plans
for you, and the able will act for you. By never rejecting talent from
outside, you will find the State easy to govern.'

There was once a man in Sung who carved a mulberry leaf out of jade for
his prince. It took three years to complete, and it mutated Nature so
exquisitely in its down, its glossiness, and its general configuration
from tip to stem, that, if placed in a heap of real mulberry leaves, it
could not be distinguished from them. This

{p. 100}

man was subsequently pensioned by the Sung State as a reward for his
skill. Lieh Tzu, hearing of it, said: 'If it took the Creator three
years to make a single leaf, there would be very few trees with leaves
on them. The Sage will rely not so much on human science and skill as on
the operations of Tao.'

\*         \*         \*

The Master Lieh Tzu was very poor, and his face wore a hungry look. A
certain stranger spoke about it to Tzu Yang, of Cheng. 'Lieh Yü-k'ou,'
said he, 'is a scholar in possession of Tao. Yet here he is, living in
destitution, within your Excellency's dominion. It surely cannot be that
you have no liking for scholars? Tzu Yang forthwith directed that an
official allowance of grain should be sent to him. Lieh Tzu came out to
receive the messengers, made two low bows and declined the gift,
whereupon the messengers went away, and Lieh Tzu reentered the house.
There he was confronted by his Wife, who beat her breast and cried
aloud: 'I have always understood that the wife and family of a man of
Tao live a fife of ease and pleasure. Yet now, when his Honour sends you
a present of food, on account of your starved appearance, you refuse to
accept it! I suppose you will call that "destiny"!' The Master Lieh Tzu
smiled and replied: 'The Minister did not know about me himself. His
present of grain was made on the suggestion of another. If it had been a
question of punishing me, that too would

{p. 101}

have been done at some one else's prompting. That is the reason why I
did not accept the gift.'

Later on, the masses rose in actual rebellion against Tzu Yang, and slew
him.

It is implied that Lieh Tzu's independence of spirit saved his life,
inasmuch as a pensioner would have shared the fate of his patron.

Mr Shih of Lu had two sons, one of whom was a scholar and the other a
soldier. The former found in his accomplishments the means of
ingratiating himself with the Marquis of Ch'i, who engaged him as tutor
to the young princes. The other brother proceeded to Ch'u, and won
favour with the King of that State by his military talents. The King was
so well pleased that he installed him at the head of his troops. Thus
both of them succeeded in enriching their family and shedding lustre on
their kinsfolk.

Now, a certain Mr Mêng, the neighbour of Mr Shih, also had two sons who
followed the selfsame professions but were straitened by poverty.
Envying the affluence of the Shih family, Mr Mêng called at his
neighbour's house, and wanted to know the secret of their rapid rise in
the world. The two brothers readily gave him the desired information,
whereupon the eldest son immediately set off for Ch'in, hoping that his
cultural attainments would recommend him to the King of that State. But
the King

{p. 102}

said: 'At the present moment all the feudal princes are struggling to
outbid one another in power, and the great essential is to keep up a
large army. If I tried to govern my State on the lines of benevolence
and righteousness, ruin and annihilation would be the outcome! So
saying, he had the unfortunate man castrated, and turned him away.

The second son, meanwhile, had gone to Wei, hoping that his military
knowledge would stand him in good stead. But the Marquis of Wei said to
himself--'Mine is a weak State hedged in by powerful ones.

Wei was bounded by Chin and Ch'i on the north, Lu on the east, and Chêng
on the south.

My method of preserving tranquillity is to show subservience to the
larger States and to conciliate the lesser ones. If I were to rely on
armed force, I could only expect utter destruction. I must not allow
this man to depart unscathed, or he may find his way to some other State
and be a terrible thorn in my side.' So, without more ado, he cut off
his feet and sent him back to Lu.

On their return, the whole family fell to beating their breasts in
despair, and uttered imprecations on Mr Shih. Mr Shih, however, said:
'Success consists in hitting off the right moment, while missing it
means failure. Your method was identical with ours, only the result was
different. That is not due to any flaw in the action itself, but simply
because it was not well timed. Nothing, in the

{p. 103}

ordering of this world, is either at all times right or at all times
wrong. What formerly passed current may nowadays be rejected; what is
now rejected may by and by come into use again. The fact that a thing is
in use or in disuse forms no criterion whatever of right or wrong. There
is no fixed rule for seizing opportunities, hitting off the right
moment, or adapting oneself to circumstances; it is all a matter of
native wit. If you are deficient in that, you may possess the learning
of a Confucius or the strategical gifts of a Lü Shang, and yet you will
remain poor wherever you go.

The Mêng family were now 'in a more resigned frame of mind, and their
indignation had subsided. 'Yes, you are right,' they said; 'please say
no more about it.'

\*         \*         \*

Duke Wên of Chin put an army into the field with the intention of
attacking the Duke of Wei, whereat Tzu Ch'u threw his head back and
laughed aloud. On being asked the reason of his behaviour, he replied:
'I was thinking of the experience of a neighbour of mine, who was
escorting his wife on a visit to her own family. On the way, he came
across a woman tending silkworms, who attracted him greatly, and he fell
into conversation with her. Happening to look up, what should he see but
his own wife also receiving the attentions of an admirer! It was the
recollection of this incident that made me laugh.'

{p. 104}

The Duke saw the point, and forthwith turned home with his army. Before
he got back, an invading force had already crossed his northern
frontier!

'As you behave to others, so others will behave to you. He who rides
roughshod towards the accomplishment of his own desires, in the belief
that it will not occur to others to do the like, will in all probability
find himself circumstanced as above.'

\*         \*         \*

In the Chin State, which was infested with robbers, there lived a
certain Ch'i Yung, who was able to tell a robber by his face; by
examining the expression of his eyes he could read his inmost thoughts.
The Marquis of Chin employed him in the inspection of hundreds and
thousands of robbers, and he never missed a single one. The Marquis
expressed his delight to Wên Tzu of Chao, saying: 'I have a man who,
singlehanded, is ridding my whole State of robbers. He saves me the
necessity of employing a whole staff of police.' Wên Tzu replied: 'If
your Highness relies on a detective for catching robbers, you will never
get rid of them. And what is more, Ch'i Yung is certain sooner or later
to meet with a violent end.'

Meanwhile, a band of robbers were plotting together. 'Ch'i Yung,' they
said, 'is the enemy who is trying to exterminate us.' So one day they
stole upon him in a body and murdered him. When the Marquis of Chin

{p. 105}

heard the news, he was greatly alarmed and immediately sent for Wên Tzu.
'Your prophecy has come true,' he said; 'Ch'i Yung is dead. What means
can I adopt for catching robbers now? 'in Chou,' replied Wên Tzu, 'we
have a proverb: "Search not the ocean-depths for fish: calamity comes
upon those who pry into hidden mysteries." If you want to be quit of
robbers, the best thing your Highness can do is to promote the worthy to
office. Let them instruct and enlighten their sovereign on the one hand,
and reform the masses below them on the other. if once the people
acquire a sense of shame, you will not find them turning into robbers.'

The Marquis then appointed Sui Hui to be Prime Minister, and all the
robbers fled to the Ch'in State.

A shrewd thrust at the brigand State which eventually swallowed up all
the rest. The commentator says: 'Apply cleverness to ferret out
wrongdoing, and the cunning rogue will escape. Using the gift of
intuition to expose crime only excites hatred in the wicked. That
"sagacity is an evil" is no empty saying.'

\*         \*         \*

Duke Mu of Ch'in said to Po Lo:

A famous judge of horses, of whom Chuang Tzu speaks with scant respect.
See *Musings of a Chinese Mystic*, p. 66.

'You are now advanced in years. Is there any member of your family whom
I could employ to look for horses in

{p. 106}

your stead?' Po Lo replied: 'A good horse can be picked out by its
general build and appearance. But the superlative horse--one that raises
no dust and leaves no tracks--is something evanescent and fleeting,
elusive as thin air. The talent of my sons lies on a lower plane
altogether: they can tell a good horse when they see one, but they
cannot tell a superlative horse. I have a friend, however, one Chiu-fang
Kao, a hawker of fuel and vegetables, who in things appertaining to
horses is nowise my inferior. Pray see him.'

Duke Mu did so, and subsequently despatched him on the quest for a
steed. Three months later, he returned with the news that he had found
one. 'It is now in Sha-ch'iu,' he added. 'What kind of a horse is it?'
asked the Duke. 'Oh, it is a dun-coloured mare,' was the reply. However,
on some one being sent to fetch it, the animal turned out to be a
coal-black stallion! Much displeased, the Duke sent for Po Lo. 'That
friend of yours,' he said, 'whom I commissioned to look for a horse, has
made a nice mess of it. Why, he cannot even distinguish a beast's colour
or sex! What on earth can he know about horses?' Po Lo heaved a sigh of
satisfaction. 'Has he really got as far as that?' he cried. 'Ah, then he
is worth a thousand of me put together. There is no comparison between
us. What Kao keeps in view is the spiritual mechanism. In making sure of
the essential, he forgets the homely details; intent on the inward
qualities, he loses sight of the external. He sees what he wants to see,

{p. 107}

and not what he does not want to see. He looks at the things he ought to
look at, and neglects those that need not be looked at. So clever a
judge of horses is Kao, that he has it in him to judge something better
than horses.'

When the horse arrived, it turned out indeed to be a superlative horse.

Mr Yü was a wealthy man of the Liang State.

Another name for the Wei State in the fourth century B.C.

His household was rolling in riches, and his hoards of money and silk
and other valuables were quite incalculable. It was his custom to have
banquets served, to the accompaniment of music, in a high upper hall
overlooking the main road; there he and his friends would sit drinking
their wine and amusing themselves with bouts of gambling.

One day, a party of young gallants happened to pass along the road. In
the chamber above, play was going on as usual, and a lucky throw of the
dice, which resulted in the capture of both fishes, evoked a loud burst
of merriment from the players.

The game here alluded to was played on a board with a 'river' in the
middle.

Precisely at that moment, it happened that a kite which was sailing
overhead dropped the carcass of a rat in the

{p. 108}

midst of the company outside. The young men held an angry consultation
on the spot: 'This Mr Yü,' they said, 'has been enjoying his wealth for
many a long day, and has always treated his neighbours in the most
arrogant spirit. And now, although we have never offended him, he
insults us with this dead art. If such an outrage goes unavenged, the
world will look upon us as a set of poltroons. Let us summon up our
utmost resolution, and combine with one accord to wipe him and his
family out of existence!' The whole party signified their agreement, and
when the evening of the day appointed had come, they collected, fully
armed for the attack, and exterminated every member of the family.

'Pride and extravagance lead to calamity and ruin in more ways than one.
Mr. Yü's family was destroyed, although in this particular instance he
had no thought of insulting others; nevertheless, the catastrophe was
due to an habitual lack of modesty and courtesy in his conduct.'

\*         \*         \*

In the east of China there was a man named Yüan Ching Mu, who set off on
a journey but was overcome by hunger on the way. A certain robber from
Hu-fu, of the name of Ch'iu, saw him lying there, and fetched a bowl of
rice-gruel in order to feed him. After swallowing three mouthfuls, Yüan
Ching Mu opened his eyes and murmured, 'Who are you?' 'I am a native of
Hu-fu, and my name is Ch'iu.' 'Oh misery!' cried Yüan Ching {p. 109} Mu,
'are not you the robber Ch'iu? What are you feeding me for? I am an
honest man and cannot eat your food.' So saying, he clutched the ground
with both hands, and began retching and coughing in order to bring it up
again. Not succeeding, however, he fell flat on his face and expired.

Now the man from Hu-fu was a robber, no doubt, but the food he brought
was not affected thereby. Because a man is a robber, to refuse to eat
the food he offers you, on the ground that it is tainted with crime, is
to have lost all power of discriminating between the normal and the
real.

Yang Chu's younger brother, named Pu, went out one day wearing a suit of
white clothes. It came on to ram, so that he had to change and came back
dressed in a suit of black. His dog failed to recognize him in this
garb, and rushed out at him, barking. This made Yang Pu angry, and he
was going to give the dog a beating, when Yang Chu said: 'Do not beat
him. You are no wiser than he. For, suppose your dog went away white and
came home black, do you mean to tell me that you would not think it
strange?

\*         \*         \*

Yang Chu said:, You may do good without thinking about fame, but fame
will follow in its wake. Fame

{p. 109}

makes no tryst with gain, but gain will come all the same. Gain makes no
tryst with strife, but strife will certainly ensue. Therefore the
superior man is very cautious about doing good.'

\*         \*         \*

The good people of Han-tan were in the habit, every New Year's day, of
presenting their Governor, Chien Tzu, with a number of live pigeons.
This pleased the Governor very much, and he liberally rewarded the
donors. To a stranger who asked the meaning of the custom, Chien Tzu
explained that the release of living creatures on New Year's day was the
sign of a benevolent disposition. 'But,' rejoined the stranger, 'the
people, being aware of your Excellency's whim, no doubt exert themselves
to catch as many pigeons as possible, and large numbers must get killed
in the process. If you really wish to let the birds live, the best way
would be to prohibit the people from capturing them at all. If they have
to be caught first in order to be released, the kindness does not
compensate for the cruelty.' Chien Tzu acknowledged that he was right.

\*         \*         \*

Mr T'ien, of the Ch'i State, was holding an ancestral banquet in his
hall, to which a thousand guests were bidden. As he sat in their midst,
many came up to him with presents of fish and game. Eyeing them
approvingly,

{p. 111}

he exclaimed with unction: 'How generous is Almighty God to man! He
makes the five kinds of grain to grow, and creates the finny and the
feathered tribes, especially for our benefit.' All Mr T'ien's guests
applauded this sentiment to the echo; but the twelve-year-old son of a
Mr Pao, regardless of seniority, came forward and said: 'You are wrong,
my lord. All the living creatures of the universe stand in the same
category as ourselves, and one is of no greater intrinsic value than
another. It is only by reason of size, strength or cunning that some
particular species gains the mastery, or that one preys upon another.
None of them are produced in order to subserve the uses of others. Man
catches and eats those that are fit for food, but how can it be
maintained that God creates these expressly for man's use? Mosquitoes
and gnats suck man's blood, and tigers and wolves devour his flesh; but
we do not therefore assert that God created man expressly for the
benefit of mosquitoes and gnats, or to provide food for tigers and
wolves.'

In reading these words, penned before the beginning of our era, it is
curious to reflect that only about fifty years ago Christian teleology
used solemnly to preach this very doctrine of 'design', until Darwin
arose and swept it away for ever.

\*         \*         \*

A man, having lost his axe, suspected his neighbour's son of having
taken it. Certain peculiarities in his gait, his countenance and his
speech, marked him out as the

{p. 112}

thief. In his actions, his movements, and in fact his whole demeanour,
it was plainly written that he and no other had stolen the axe. By and
by, however, while digging in a dell, the owner came across the missing
implement. The next day, when he saw his neighbour's son again, he found
no trace of guilt in his movements, his actions, or his general
demeanour.

'The man in whose mind suspicion is at work will let himself be carried
away by utterly distorted fancies, until at last he sees white as black,
and detects squareness in a circle.'

\*         \*         \*

There was once a man in the Ch'i State who had a burning lust for gold.
Rising early one morning, he dressed and put on his hat and went down to
the marketplace, where he proceeded to seize and carry off the gold from
a money-changer's shop.

An ordinary thief would have gone at night, and probably naked, after
smearing his body with oil.

He was arrested by the police, who were puzzled to know why he had
committed the theft at a time when every body was about. 'When I was
taking the gold,' he replied, 'I did not see anybody at all; what I saw
was the gold, and nothing but the gold.'
