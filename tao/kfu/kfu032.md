"The Immortal with the Iron Staff" is included by Tauist writers in the
category of the Eight Immortals. His surname was Li. He is largely
represented in Chinese legendary lore. No precise period is assigned to
his existence upon earth. His disembodied spirit entered the body of a
lame and crooked beggar, and in this shape the philosopher continued his
existence, supporting his halting footsteps with an iron staff. Hence
his name, T‘ieh Kwai.
