10.—The Lying Tiger springing at his Food.

<div style="font-size: 93%">

Standing with the feet apart as if the body would upset.

Bending and stretching each leg alternately.

Raise up the head that the breast may stretch forward,

Flatten the back and let the loins be level as a flat smooth stone.

Equalize the in-and-out-going breath by the nose.

Let the tips of the fingers rest on the ground and raise the body.

To vanquish the dragon and reduce the tiger, *i.e.*, the influence of
the genii.

To learn to obtain a true body and so protect one's health. See No. 10.
