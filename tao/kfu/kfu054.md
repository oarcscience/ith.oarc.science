*Kung-Fu, or Tauist Medical Gymnastics*, by John Dudgeon, \[1895\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. 26.—Lü Ch’un-yang’s <span id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12) Figure of
sustaining the Pulse.—To cure the hundred (all) diseases.

<div style="font-size: 93%">

Sit upright, let the two hands press the 'sun' and 'moon,' two lateral
acupuncture apertures two inches below the heart, times; circulate the
air 9 mouthfuls.

Another method is to press the knees with the two hands, twist the body
right and left, and with each turn of the body revolve the air in 14
mouthfuls.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

The Figure resembles in every respect No, 7, also No. 1 of the
Ornamental Sections.

A similar exercise is elsewhere termed—The March of the Blood Vessels.

<div style="font-size: 93%">

*Prescription*.—Uses 1 wei-ling-hsien (\#), Clematis sp., on the two
days known as *ping-ting* (\#) and *wei-sze* (\#), horary characters,
dry it in the shade, powder, pass through a sieve; 2 mace for a dose in
warm wine; avoid tea. It is well, while cutting the drug, not to hear
the sound of water. To be taken on an empty heart, and in summer there
will be no epidemics, and in autumn no ague and dysentery, and all
diseases will be banished easily and without trouble, as the title of
the Prescription intimates.

Corresponds with Amiot's No. 7 for sustaining the health.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_12"></span>[179:\*](kfu054.htm#fr_12) Lü Tsu (\#) or Yen
(\#), or Tung-pin (\#), or Ch‘un-yang (\#), for he is known by all these
names, was born 755 A.D. He was one of the most prominent of the later
patriarchs of the Tauist sect, of whose doctrines he was an ardent
votary. He was invested with the magic formulas and a sword of
supernatural powers with which he traversed the Empire, slaying dragons
and ridding the earth of divers kinds of evils during a period of
upwards of 400 years. In the 12th century, according to Mayers, temples
were erected to his honour and were dedicated to his worship under the
title Ch'un-yang, which he had adopted. Several such temples exist at
Peking. He is worshipped especially by the fraternity of doctors and
barbers. He and Ko Hsien-wêng (No. 18), each at 64 years of age, met
their teachers and embraced the Doctrine. For an account of this
patriarch, see the writer's articles on *Medical Divinities and
Divinities in Medical Temples* (Chinese Recorder, Volume 3, 1870).
