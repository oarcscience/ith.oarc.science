This is an extremely rare 19th century treatise on Chinese medicine,
particularly the practices of the Kung Fu school. This has never been
reprinted, and was scanned from a rare copy in the possession of the
University of California. Although best known for a fighting style, Kung
Fu includes a whole range of medical practices based on late Taoist
alchemy. Dudgeon describes the use of yoga-like postures, movements
similar to Tai Chi, the use of healing sounds similar to mantras, as
well as massage and other techniques. He gives specifics of compounds
used to treat a wide range of ailments in conjunction with the other
methods. Dudgeon describes Taoist deities and sages, and gives extensive
background on Chinese medical theory. This text is an invaluable look at
the esoteric medical practices of the Chinese prior to the 20th century.

*Important:* This is an historical text which includes accounts of 19th
century Chinese medical practices, presented for the purpose of
education and entertainment. Please do not attempt any of the exercises
or treatments described in this document without consulting your
physician first.

<span class="small">*Production Notes:* I had to scan this from a PDF
created by Google books, by printing out the PDF and then bulk-scanning
the pages back in. Because of the poor quality of the printing in the
original text, it is likely that there are additional errata which have
not been corrected. Several sections which were printed entirely in
small type have been presented in the default type size for purposes of
readability. Locations of untranscribed Chinese characters in the text
are indicated by a single hash sign (\#). Due to the number of diagrams
in the text, I have broken it down into files based on the number of
images per file, so as to not have to thumbnail the images. --J.B. Hare,
