*Kung-Fu, or Tauist Medical Gymnastics*, by John Dudgeon, \[1895\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

No. 7.—Han Chung-li's (\#) Method of sounding the "Heavenly Drum."—To
cure vertigo.

Sometimes called—The Vertigo-curing Tiger, or the Peach Blossom Tiger.

A similar exercise is given under the heading—The Hands beating the Wind
Residence (acupuncture aperture below the occipital protuberance)
causing Thunder.—For the cure of head-ache from inflammation of the
membranes or from wind.

<div style="font-size: 93%">

Bite the teeth, sit straight, shut the breath, use both hands and cover
the ears, beat the "Heavenly Drum" 36 times, again tap the teeth 16
times.

Adding to the Taste of the White Tiger Soup.

<div style="font-size: 93%">

*Prescription*.—Take of gypsum (roasted) 2 candareens; chih-mu (\#),
Anemorrhena asphodeloides, liquorice, of each 1 mace; pan-hsia 2
candareens; mai-tung (\#), tubers of Ophiopogon japonicus, 8 candareens;
chu-ye (\#), bamboo leaves, 5 candareens; rice a pickle. Make decoction
with 3 slices of ginger in it. (The heart will thus become as bright as
a mirror, and as clear as Heaven,—the first couplet of the poetical
stanza).

This Figure corresponds with Amiot's No. 9, which is said to be against
vertigo and dazzling, and resembles No. 1 of the Eight Sections, and is
therefore here omitted.
