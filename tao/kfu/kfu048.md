*Kung-Fu, or Tauist Medical Gymnastics*, by John Dudgeon, \[1895\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

No. 20.—The Maiden Ma (\#) rubbing (away) the Disease.—To cure
imperviousness of the air and arteries.

<div style="font-size: 93%">

Stand firmly. If it be the air and blood vessels of the left side that
are not pervious (*i.e.*, not circulating so as to reach all points),
then the right hand acts the *kung*, and the idea or thought is to be
directed to the left. If it be the right side that is impervious, the
left hand acts, and the will is to be on the right. Each side to have 5
mouthfuls of the revolving air.

Except that the hand is pointing, this Figure of Miss Ma resembles that
of Miss Ts‘ao (No. 8), who is viewing the Absolute from which is evolved
the two primordial or positive and negative essences, or male and female
principles.

Ma Ku is one of the female celebrities of Tauist fable, a sister of the
immortalized soothsayer and astrologer Wang Yuen of the Han dynasty.
