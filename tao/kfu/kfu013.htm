<p>9.&#8212;<i>For the Solar Term of the Fifth Month, named "Sprouting Seeds."</i>&#8212;[Although the figure is standing, the instruction is sitting. The sitting character [<i>tso</i>] seems, however, to indicate the passing a season in such exercises, just as <i>hsing-kung</i> (#) refers to the carrying out of the same; an expression which occurs almost invariably in the body of the instructions, while the other (#) forms the title or introduction]. The body is thrown back, both hands raised aloft as if supporting a thing, and great force is to be used with both right and left in raising up (the supposed weight) 5 &times; 7 times. Fix the breath, the remainder as usual. To cure weakness of the loins and kidneys, dryness in swallowing, heart and ribs painful, eyes yellow, thirst, body hot and thighs painful,</p>

<p>head and neck painful, face red, cough and expectoration upwards, leakage downwards (diarrh&#339;a of the lower air may mean passage of wind, emission of semen, or diarrh&#339;a), grief, fear (see Figure, below). It corresponds with Amiot's No. 5, which is against pains of the heart, leanness of exhaustion, and thirst accompanied with heat of the body.</p>
