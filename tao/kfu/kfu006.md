### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[122:\*](kfu006.htm#fr_2.md) The illustration, being
identical with the above Figure, is omitted; the pressure of the hand is
applied to the right instead of the left thigh, and the head is turned
to the left. The character used in the second is *pi* (\#), which is not
found in any of our Chinese-English Dictionaries. In the writer's
*Vocabulary of Anatomical Terms*, to be published shortly, it refers to
the region of the stomach. The part to be pressed upon in the above
Figure is *pi* (\#), the thigh, which agrees with the illustrations.
