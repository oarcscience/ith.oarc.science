No. 2.—The Venerable Prince Li playing the Lute.—To cure chronic disease
and yellow swelling.

<div style="font-size: 93%">

Sit silently with both hands on the knees, rub forcibly, let the heart
consider and wait till the air has circulated to all parts of the body,
and make it go round in 49 mouthfuls. The air will thus revolve, the
blood harmonize, and diseases vanish.

The Jujube Iron Pills.

<div style="font-size: 93%">

*Prescription*.—Take of green alum (\#) sulphate of iron? burnt, orange
peel, ts‘ang-shu, of each 2 ounces; sha-jên (\#), cardamoms, 3 mace;
dried ginger, 2 mace; chih-ch‘iöh, or chih-k‘o (\#), Aegle sepiaria
(large fruit); ping-lang (\#), Areca catechu (betel-nut); jên-shên (\#),
ginseng, root of Aralia quinquefolia (Pansax Ginseng), of each 3 mace;
powder, boil the jujubes, beat them into a pulp, mix the powder and make
into pills of which 49 form a dose morning and evening, to be taken with
rice gruel. Fish, fowl, cold and raw articles, and fatty substances are
contra-indicated.

After each Prescription, there is a stanza of poetry. The older work
consulted omits the poetry. The stanza accompanying this recipe
reads*:—*

<div style="font-size: 93%">

At first when there was chaos, there was the female principle, then
there ascended the male principle, and heaven was divided; the former
principle increased, the latter diminished, and then both harmonized;
heaven and earth then appeared, and the Great Reason, and this was the
Creation. <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7)

The Figure given in the books is that of the Founder of Tauism. He is
popularly termed Lao-tse, the Old Child; from the white appearance of
his head and the aged appearance of his face at birth. The epithet
really means the Old Master. His surname Li was derived from the name
for a plum tree, under which he was said to have been born. He was a
contemporary of Confucius. The illustration is, as described, an
attitude of meditation assumed by the Tauist and Buddhist priests.
