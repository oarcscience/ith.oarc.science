<p>In a work copiously and beautifully illustrated on Kung-fu, which apparently has been abstracted from my library but of which I made a translation and had the most striking illustrations copied and cut nearly 30 years ago, I find many of the illustrations and descriptions with unimportant variations in other and later works on the subject, some of which have already been presented to the reader. The titles of some of the kung are altered, and the positions slightly varied; the description of the exercises is very closely adhered to in all. The titles are in most cases very poetical and graphic, and are supposed to be suggested by the attitudes. To save space, incorporation has been attempted. Repetition both in letter-press and figures is sought to be avoided, and only the more striking ones are presented. These curative exercises are followed by prophylactic ones, including the Dragon and Tiger series.</p>

He derives his name, T&#8216;ai-peh, from the planet Venus, which is said to have shot down and entered the bosom of his mother. The Imperial Courtier, Ho Che-chang of the T&#8216;ang Emperor, on hearing of his remarkable talent, exclaimed&#8212;"This is indeed an Immortal banished to earth."
