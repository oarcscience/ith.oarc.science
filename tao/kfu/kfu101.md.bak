### Physiology of Kung-fu.

The general principles of this art may be briefly and clearly expressed
in the following quotation from one of their numerous works on the
subject, and from one of the prefaces written in commendation of the
system.

The Chinese acknowledge three principles or forces upon the regular
movement of which the life of man depends—the vital spirits *Ching*
(\#), or organic forces produce the animal spirits *Chi* (\#), or
forces, and from these two springs a finer sort, free from matter and
designed for intellectual operations, termed *Shen* (\#). The particles
of the vital spirits glide over one another as the parts of water;
growth and nourishment belong to them; the animal spirits put the
internal and external senses in exercise; their particles are smaller
than the vital and they move in every sense like particles of air. As it
is not possible to subsist without these forces, care must be taken no;
to dissipate them by immoderate use of the pleasures of sense, by
violent efforts of the body or by too great or too constant application
of the forces or spirits. They have besides

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

two organic principles, from the union of which man is made which
pervade all parts of the body, and upon the union of which life depends.
The one is the *yang* or vital heat, or light, the positive or male
principle; the other is the *yin*, radical moisture, darkness in nature,
the negative element or the female principle. The body is divided into
right and left, the pulse of each side governing its own side of the
body. The internal parts are divided into the five viscera and six *fu*
(or organs connected with the outer air) There are six which lodge the
radical moisture and belong to the female principle and comprehend the
heart, liver, left kidney, all situated on the left side, and the lungs,
spleen and right kidney (otherwise called the "gate of life" but by
other writers this latter expression is perhaps more correctly applied
to the vagina) on the right. Those which contain the vital heat are on
the left, the small intestines, pericardium, gall bladder and ureters;
on the right the large intestines stomach and the three divisions of the
trunk (altogether imaginary) certain relations are supposed to exist
between these as for example—between the small intestines and heart,
gall bladder and liver, ureters and left kidney, on the left side; and
large intestines and lungs, stomach and spleen, three divisions and
right kidney, on the right side. These organs contain the vital heat and
radical moisture which by means of the spirits and blood go from these
organs into all the other portions of the body. All the various members
of the body, the diseases, the materia medica etc, are all arranged
according to a well established and ancient relation between them and
the 5 elements, 5 colours, 5 tastes, 5 points of the compass, etc. Each
organ has a road or blood vessel proceeding to it and as there are 12
Chinese hours (each two of our hours) in a day, and as the blood and air
make a circuit of the entire body in 24 hours, the blood remains in each
organ two hours. There are therefore 12 roads or vessels and of course
as many pulses, one for each vessel and organ. These pulses are
subdivided into male and female according to the dual principle and this
it is evident involves three double pulses on each side and thus the
theory is elaborated. Still further divisions of the pulse on the right
and left are into superficial, deep and intermediate according if the
pressure of the finger is applied lightly, firmly or intermediately to
indicate diseases of a superficial, deep or intermediate position.
Numerous volumes in Chinese exist on the pulse alone on the skill of
which subject the Chinese pride themselves as it is the

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

pivot upon which their whole system hangs. As an example take the pulse
of the large intestines. It belongs to the male principle; is felt at
the "foot" (cubit, the 3rd pulse position at the wrist in order
reckoning from the base of the thumb backwards) on the right arm (the
small intestinal pulse is felt at the same spot on the left arm). The
blood flowing to the large intestines rises at the tips of the thumb and
index finger, unites and flows up the back of the arm to the head, then
down the face to the lungs and thence to the intestines; in the larynx
it gives off two branches which run upwards to the ear and across to the
mouth and terminate at each side of the nose. Deafness, ringing in the
ears, pain behind the ears, and in the arms are owing to the large
intestines. The blood resides in this viscus from 5 to 7 o'clock a.m.

Although the Chinese speak of blood moving forwards, they have never had
a correct notion of the heart and circulation. With them it is the air
either inside the blood or outside the vessels according to others,
which presses the blood forwards.

At first the *yin* (earthly vapour) and *yang* (heavenly air) produced
the root of man, the kidneys; and one or other of the 7 Ching (\#) <span
id="fr_24"></span>[\*](#fn_24) (emotions or passions.md) injure the
original air and so cause disease, and thus the circulating air of the
entire body gets blocked up and the blood gets coagulated in heaps and
then disease is produced; therefore in ancient times good men who
understood the Great Reason (Tao) sought out clear methods by which to
nourish the original air. Kung-fu was discovered in this way and as the
bear carries his neck firmly and the birds use their wings, so the eyes
and ears must be directed inwards and the air and blood be conducted to
the joints to nourish them, and thus what is above will flow below and
what is below will flow upwards and as the heavenly elements are
themselves strong and fixed, so man must himself try to bring his body
into the same condition, and as the heavenly bodies according to the
Divine Law are always revolving, so must the air in our bodies. The
creation of the great heaven must resemble the creation of the little
heaven

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the microcosm,
man). The head is round resembling the arch of heaven and our feet are
flat resembling the earth. (The Chinese saying is "Heaven is round,
earth is flat" and the comparison of man to the great outside world is
very common as for example because there are 360 degrees or days in the
latter, there must be 360 bones in the former) Confucius said that "all
the revolving changes do not surpass the four seasons."

In a small work by a native of Soochow named P‘an-ü-wei (\#),
*wei-sheng-i-chiu-cheng*, in the year 1858, the following prefatory
remarks on kung-fu occur*:—*

Why do some men live, others die? Why are some diseases light, others
severe? To answer these questions we must refer to the existence in
sufficient or insufficient quantity of the original vital principle. The
origin and foundation of the five viscera <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) depend upon and spring from the vital
principle. <span id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md) It is here where the yin
and yang reside, and from which these male and female principles
emanate, and whence proceeds the breath in expiration and to which it
goes in inspiration. There is no fire nor oven, and yet the body in its
furthest parts is kept quite warm; there is no water or reservoir, and
yet the five viscera are kept moist.

All men must beware of admitting depraved air, as for example, heat,
cold and such like into the five viscera and six *fu* <span
id="fr_27"></span>[3](#fn_27.md); the twelve arteries and veins, tendons,
blood and flesh, otherwise if such poisonous air should get admittance,
disease will be contracted.

The ancients used acupuncture and the moxa as remedies, afterwards they
took stones and rubbed themselves in order to cause the blood to flow;
and they also used friction to the skin and muscles with the hand to
cure disease and cause the blood and air to move. They also used a more
violent pressing and rubbing method over the affected part. They had
also a spirit-drink mode. All these methods were designed to cause
motion in the joints—to harmonize the blood and air so as to leave no
vacuum and to cause the

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

depraved air to escape and be quickly expelled, because only on its

exit will the perfect and wholesome air be revived as before, circulate
and so secure freedom from disease.

When disease is expelled great care must he taken with the *tan t‘ien*,
so that the original fire and water may coalesce and assist each other;
the spirit of man will then wax greater and stronger and the bad air
cannot enter. But one must not upon any account wait till disease has
attacked the system and is unbearable. It will then be too late. True
wisdom is to begin Kung-fu before the approach of the disease, and so
prevent it. It is true the limit of our lives is fixed, but at the same
time it is also true that by Kung-fu the body can be strengthened. This
is therefore the object of this publication. The author has consulted
the work of *Hsü-ming-feng* (\#), of *Fheng-ch‘eng* (\#) and the various
medical works. As all men have five senses <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) and four bodies, <span
id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md) so all require gymnastics, pressure and
friction. Kung-fu divides itself into external actions and internal
merit, each one chooses his own kind. The ancients divided actions into
twelve kinds and wrote in poetry the method to be followed, in order
that all might remember the rules laid down. All can do them, at all
times, and every one can understand them quickly and efficaciously.

There is no necessity here for claptrap and useless nonsense, the true
and important object is to drive away or ward off disease, and procure
long life. Belief in this plan will bring merit out of it. The doctrines
of Lau-tse, (\#) C‘hïh-sung-tse, <span id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30.md)
(\#) and Chung-li-tse <span id="fr_31"></span>[4](#fn_31) (\#.md) are not
superior to the precepts of this book. If a person can perform daily
once or twice the exercises herein prescribed, his body wilt become
strong and elastic, and no matter how many kinds of diseases he may
have, all will vanish and thus will the vital principle exist in
adequate quantity and life consequently will be prolonged. This is
surely good and on this account I have taken up my pen to write this
preface.
