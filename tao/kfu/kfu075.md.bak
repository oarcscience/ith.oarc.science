### Footnotes

<span id="fn_16"></span>[201:\*](kfu075.htm#fr_16.md) Tung Fang-shuo, 2nd
century B.C. It is related that he was the child of a miraculous
conception, and his mother removed to a place further to the eastward
from her home to give birth to her child; and hence his name. According
to common repute, he was the embodiment of the planet Venus.
