### NOTES ON KUNG-FU REGULATING THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY.

It will be observed that the cause of disease is invariably supposed to
depend upon the presence of vitiated or depraved air having stealthily
gained admittance. The air thus shut up causes obstruction. It is
sometimes termed thievish or air deflected from its proper course. The
Chinese proverb runs, avoid a draught of air as you would the point of
an arrow.—It is recommended to rub the soles of the feet until hot and
also to move each toe; this

measure being effectual in preserving and repairing the vital and animal
spirits. The middle of the sole of the foot is supposed to be the outlet
of a great many services of spirits and like mouths of rivers, the
arteries and veins end there and therefore must be kept open.—It is
advisable every time one awakes, to stretch one's self in bed, thus
facilitating the course of the spirits and circulation. One ought not to
sleep like a dead man (*i.e.*, not to lie on one's back), nor to let the
hands rest on the breast or heart, so as to avoid dreams and nightmares.
Once in bed to keep silence, to refrain from talking; the lungs are the
most tender of the viscera and consequently placed uppermost and they
serve for respiration and promotion of the voice. On taking any position
in bed, they incline to rest upon that side; by talking the lungs are
forced to raise themselves in part and by strongly heaving; shake the
other noble internal parts. The voice comes from the lungs as the sound
from a bell, if the bell be not hung, it is damaged by striking it to
make it sound. Confucius never spoke after he was in bed; he made it a
rule doubtless for this reason. The Chinese have as a rule good teeth.
The better classes use warm tea or water with which to cleanse them each
morning and after meals. It is ordered to sleep with the head and face
uncovered and with the mouth shut as it tends to keep the radical
moisture from escaping and preserves the teeth. Early loss of teeth is
caused by the air passing in and out between them; besides gross
particles are inhaled which give rise to distempers.

The *tan-t‘ien* is situated about 1½ inches below the navel and is
brought into exercise with the bow and arrow exercise. A man is said to
be strong when this is in sufficient quantity.
