9.—*For the Solar Term of the Fifth Month, named "Sprouting
Seeds."*—\[Although the figure is standing, the instruction is sitting.
The sitting character \[*tso*\] seems, however, to indicate the passing
a season in such exercises, just as *hsing-kung* (\#) refers to the
carrying out of the same; an expression which occurs almost invariably

dryness in swallowing, heart and ribs painful, eyes yellow, thirst, body
hot and thighs painful,

head and neck painful, face red, cough and expectoration upwards,
leakage downwards (diarrhœa of the lower air may mean passage of wind,
emission of semen, or diarrhœa), grief, fear (see Figure, below). It
corresponds with Amiot's No. 5, which is against pains of the heart,
leanness of exhaustion, and thirst accompanied with heat of the body.
