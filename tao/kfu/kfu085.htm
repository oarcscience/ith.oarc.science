<p>While performing the exercise must first rest the mind, cease from all thought, banish all grief, anger and suchlike and give up all the animal propensities, in order to keep and not disperse the vital essence.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  <h4 align="center">FOR THE BODY.</h4>  
<p>1.&#8212;At the time of sitting crosslegged, the heel of one foot must block up the perinaeum and not allow the vital spirits to leak out. 2.&#8212;Sit evenly, the <A HREF="errata.htm#25">knees</A> must be level with the body, the "sons of the kidney" must not rest on the seat but hang down. <i>Note</i>. Sitting high and level refers to sitting on chairs and beds. 3.&#8212;After finishing the exercise and rising, the limbs must be slowly extended, and on no account be done hastily. 4.&#8212;In sitting, the body must be level and straight, the spinal column must be perpendicular and not bent, and not lean against anything on the right or left.</p>  <h4 align="center">FOR THE HEAD.</h4>  
<p>1.&#8212;Close the ears with the hands, let the second (fore) finger fold itself on the middle one and thrum the two bones at the back of the skull with the second finger to make them sound. This is called sounding the "heavenly drum." <i>Note</i>. This is to remove the vicious air from the "wind pool" acupuncture opening in the</p>

<p>region of the mastoid. 2.&#8212;Twist the neck with the hands and glance back to the right and left and at the sametime rotate the shoulders and arms, each 24 times.&#8212;To remove the obstructed air in the stomach and spleen. 3.&#8212;Interlock the hands and grasp the back of the neck, then look upwards and let the hands wrestle with the neck. To remove pain of the shoulders and indistinctness of vision.</p>  <h4 align="center">FACE.</h4>  
<p>Rub the hands until hot, then rub the face with them, high and low, all over, no spot to be left unrubbed; then spit on the palms and rub them warm and apply them several times to the face. While rubbing, the breath, by the mouth and nose is to be closed. The aim of this exercise is to brighten the countenance. The more you rub the better the colour. This is the cure for wrinkles; with this action you will have none.</p>  <h4 align="center">EAR.</h4>  
<p>1.&#8212;Place the hands over the ears, then rub them right and left and up and down several times. This is to hear distinctly and prevent deafness. 2.&#8212;Sit level on the ground with one leg bent and the other extended. Stretch forth the arms horizontally with the hands perpendicularly towards the front as if pushing a door, and twist the head 7 times to each, side to cure ringing in the ears.</p>  <h4 align="center">EYE.</h4>  
<p>1.&#8212;When you awake, do not open the eyes, but rub the back of the thumbs until they become hot, then with them wipe the eyes 14 times; still keeping the eyes shut, rotate the eyeballs to each side 7 times. Then shut them tightly for a little while and then suddenly open them wide. This is to protect the "divine light" and to</p>  
<p><a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="green">p. 249</font></A></p>  
<p>remove for ever disease from the eye. Rubbing the thumbs hot on the palm of the hand will also do. 2.&#8212;Use the bent bone of the thumb (ungual phalanx) and press heavily on the little apertures at the sides of the eyebrows (temples) 3 &times; 9 =27 times. Again with the two hands rub above the malar bones and round the pinna of the ear 30 times. Again let the hands press upon the frontal region, beginning between the two eyebrows and proceeding backwards to the margin of the hair at the back of the head 27 times, and swallow the saliva times without number. To give clearness and brightness to the eyes and ears. 3.&#8212;Place the hands on the inner canthi of the eyes near the root of the nose; shut up the breath, and when the air has become pervious then stop. By doing this constantly objects will be seen very distinctly, obstructions in the nose will be removed, and coryza may also be cured in this way. 4.&#8212;When kneeling or sitting let the hands touch the ground and turn the head in order to take a backward glance 5 times. This is termed the "Tiger's glance." To remove the vicious wind of the thorax and kidneys. This exercise can be carried out in bed; the hands need not necessarily be placed on the ground.</p>  <h4 align="center">MOUTH.</h4>  
<p>1.&#8212;When performing the exercise, the mouth must be closed. 2.&#8212;When there is great dryness and bitterness of the mouth, the tongue rough, swallowing without saliva; pain in the <A HREF="errata.htm#26">pharynx</A>, whether in swallowing or expectorating, inability to eat, this is owing to inflammation (heat). The mouth must be opened wide, the air blown (hemmed) over a dozen times, the "heavenly drum" sounded 9 times, and the tongue must excite the saliva, blow again and then swallow. Wait till the "pure water" (saliva) is</p>  
<p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="green">p. 250</font></A></p>  
<p>produced, and the heat will be driven back and the viscera become cooled. Again if the saliva in the mouth be cold and without taste, the heart feeling as if it contained water&#8212;this is owing to cold, one must take the air and warm it, Wait till the mouth has recovered its taste, the cold is disarmed and the viscera become warm. 3. Every morning breathe out gently the, foul air from the mouth and at the sametime take in the pure air by the nose and swallow it. 4.&#8212;In sleeping shut the mouth, do not let the original constitutional air come out and the corrupt air enter.</p>  <h4 align="center">TONGUE.</h4>  
<p>Place the tongue against the roof of the mouth in order to excite the saliva and fill the mouth, then rinse the mouth 36 times and swallow it in three mouthfuls, making the gurgling sound <i>ku&nbsp;ku</i> in the pharynx. The saliva entering the abdomen will moisten the viscera.</p>  <h4 align="center">TEETH.</h4>

<p>1.&#8212;Rub the thumbs of the two hands until they become hot, then rub the nose with them 36 times, to moisten the lungs. 2.&#8212;Let the eyes look at the point of the nose and then breathe silently several times. 3.&#8212;Every evening lying prone in bed with the pillow removed, bend the legs and keep the feet upright, and inhale the pure air by the nostrils 4 times and expire by the nose 4 times. In expiration use energy, afterwards breathe gently by the nose. To cure heat of the body and pain of the back.</p>  
<p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="green">p. 251</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">HAND.</h4>  
<p>1.&#8212;Interlock the hands and support the empty void of heaven with the palms and lay them on the head 24 times, to remove the vicious air of the thorax. 2.&#8212;Let one hand be stretched forward and the other bent backward as if drawing a very tight bow equal to a resistance of 500 catties. to remove the vicious air of the arms and axill&aelig;. 3.&#8212;Clench tightly the two hands and with the fists strike the arms and thighs with them; then turn the hands backwards and strike the back each 36 times, to remove the vicious air of the four pits (the two axill&aelig; and the two groins) 4.&#8212;Hold the fists tightly, bend the elbows backwards and draw them backwards 7 times and let the bead twisted follow the hands to the right and left, to cure red boils of the body. 5.&#8212;Let the two fists with energy strike right and left the emptiness 7 times, to remove the vicious wind of the thorax.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">FEET.</h3>  
<p>1.&#8212;Sitting upright, stretch the feet. bend the bead as if worshipping and with energy let the hands grasp the soles 12 times, to remove the vicious air of the pericardium. 2.&#8212;Sitting on a high place with the feet hanging down let the heels be rotated opposite each other outwards and let the toes converge opposite each other inwards, each 24 times, to cure rheumatism of the feet. 3.&#8212;Seated cross legged take hold of the toes with one hand and rub the sole with the other until it becomes hot. In the sole there is the "bubbling fountain" aperture from which damp and wind find exit; when rubbed hot may stop; then move the toes themselves, to cure dampness and heat and increase the walking energy 4.&#8212;Kneeling on one leg, the hands supported by the bed, extend and flex the legs alternately 7 times. Change from right to left, to remove swelling,</p>  
<p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></A></p>  
<p>of the knees and ankles. 5.&#8212;Clench the fists slowly, step with the left foot to the front, pronate and supinate the left hand in front, and the right behind; in the same manner do it on the right, to remove the vicious air of the two shoulders.</p>  <h4 align="center">SHOULDER.</h4>  
<p>1. Set the shoulders with the hands in a rotatory motion, alternately right and left turning the windlass, 24 times; first rotate the left, then the right; this is termed the "Single Pulley;" then both together; this is called the "Double Pulley" 2.&#8212;Rest and harmonize the mind, rub the navel alternately with each hand 14 times then the ribs and shoulders 7 times and inspire and convey the air to the <i>tan-t&#8216;ien;</i> clench tightly the fists and lie down on one side bending the feet, to prevent nocturnal emissions.</p>  <h4 align="center">BACK.</h4>  
<p>Let the hands rest on the bed, contract (shrink) the body in a heap, bend the back, bow the vertebra column and raise it up 13 times, to remove the vicious air of the heart and liver.</p>  <h4 align="center">ABDOMEN.</h4>  
<p>1.&#8212;Rub the abdomen with the hands and walk 100 steps to cure indigestion. 2.&#8212;Close the breath and think the fire of the <i>tan-t&#8216;ien</i> up and burn the whole body.</p>  <h4 align="center">LOINS.</h4>

<p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="green">p. 253</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">KIDNEYS.</h4>  
<p>1.&#8212;Grasp with one hand the "two sons" of the inside and outside kidneys (the Chinese suppose them connected) and with the other hand rub the navel, each hand 81 times. This instruction is put into a rhyme thus:&#8212;one rub, one suspend, right and left change hands, nine times nine in number and the male principle will not go. 2.&#8212;Before sleeping sit on the bed, with the legs hanging down, open the clothes, close the breath, apply the tongue to the roof of the mouth, and direct the eyes to the "door of the vertex" (the crown of the head). Elevate and contract the "cereal road" as if to prevent defecation and with the two hands rub the two apertures called <i>Shen-&uuml;</i> of the two kidneys, each 120 times, to produce semen, strengthen the membrum virile, remove pain from the loins and prevent frequent micturition.</p>  
<p>People according to their diseases and wishes must select the proper exercises or use them as prophylactic; in general, officials and merchants not having time to perform them and considering themselves sufficiently strong are not willing to go through these exercises; if they wait till the body is enfeebled and then express their willingness, it will be too late. Such people are to be commiserated.</p>

Once in bed, lull the heart (mind) to sleep by composing it throwing aside thoughts that would banish sleep. The heart will be kept in good condition and the dissipation of the vital and animal spirits prevented, if, while in bed, we lie on either side with the knees bent a little.</P>
