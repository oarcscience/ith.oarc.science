*Kung-Fu, or Tauist Medical Gymnastics*, by John Dudgeon, \[1895\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Books on Kung-fu.

The Tauist work Tsun-sheng-pa-chien (\#), in 20 books was written by
Kau-lien-shen-fu (\#), in 1591. The first and third prefaces are by the
author, the second by Ch‘ai-ying-nan (\#). The work is divided into
eight parts; two books are occupied with the subject of Undivided
Application, four with Seasonable Regimen, from which we have taken the
Kung-fu for the year; two with Rest and Pleasure; two with Prevention of
Disease, from which we have taken the Eight Ornamental sections; three
with Eating, Drinking and Clothing; three with Amusements in retirement;
two with Efficacious Medicines and one with Examples of the Virtuous,
and the Contents form the twentieth volume. In the large list of drugs
the poppy is mentioned only once and among a list of prescriptions opium
occurs only once as an ingredient in a pill entitled The Great Golden
Elixir.

This work is well got up: There is a sameness of language and
illustration running through the works of this class. The more recent
and cheaper books have been reproduced from the older works with minor
changes and additions.

Another work called Hsing-ming-kwei-chih (\#), is by an accomplished
Tauist of the Sung dynasty called Yin-chen-jen (\#), on the Government
of the inner man. This is one of the most celebrated treatises on this
art. It is in 4 volumes and treats at large of the principles and method
of practice and is amply illustrated by plates. It was first printed in
1615 and another edition in a large and handsome style was issued about
1670. The 1st preface is by Li-p‘o, (\#), the 2nd by Chang-chi (\#), the
3rd by Tsou-yuen-piao (\#), and the 4th by Yu-t‘ung (\#), all in the
time of Kanghi.

The contents of this work are of the usual Tauist character, discourses
on the Great Reason, Birth, Life, Death, the Elixir, the Absolute, the
Yin and Yang, Refining the Heart etc. One chapter, entitled the Three
Passes, Agreeing and Opposing, begins thus:—Reason (tau) produced one;
one produced two; two produced three and three produced the myriad
things. Another chapter on the True and False or the deflected and the
perfect beginning with the great Tau producing heaven and earth; and
these, man and things, states that there are 3,600 Tauist methods; 24
sorts of the Great Elixir and 96 sorts of outside doctrines. There are
numerous side sects but only one Golden Elixir Doctrine which is the one
and only perfect way. Outside this there is no other way of becoming
immortals and Buddhas. This is real, all else is empty and false. About
sixty different sects are mentioned who prosecute their doctrines,
hoping by means of which to gain immortality, The list is said to be
inexhaustible. They are compared to looking through a tube at the
panther \[and seeing one spot only\] or like looking at heaven from the
bottom of a well the horizon in both

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

cases being contracted and limited. There is no panacea but the Golden
Elixir—the Great Reason. This is the end and there is nothing better.
Many of the sects are incidentally [referred](errata.htm#15.md) to in the
preceding kung-fu. The list though intensely interesting and instructive
is too long to reproduce here. Another work is called
*Fuh-show-tan-shu*. (\#), or The Elixir of Happiness and Longevity, in 6
vols., published in 1621. Hwato's Five Animals are drawn from the first
volume of this work entitled *An-yang-p‘ien*. (\#), a discourse of Peace
and Nourishment; the 2nd vol., is termed Yen-ling-p'ien. (\#), a
treatise on Longevity, The Medicinal kung are extracted from this
volume. The remaining four vols., are entitled respectively
Fuh-shih-p‘ien (\#), a collection on dress and food of prescriptions by
Ying-yuen; the Tsai-pu-p‘ien. (\#), by the same; the Hsuen-sien-p‘ien.
(\#) *ditto*, and on Drugs or the Ching-yao-p‘ien. (\#) by
Cheng-chi-chiao. (\#) Another work is termed Tan-ching-san-chuen. (\#),
in 6 vols., [consisting](errata.htm#16.md) of the T‘ien-hsien-chêng-li.
(\#), in two books by Pa-tse-yuen. (\#), reprinted in the year 1801. One
vol. is entitled Foh-hsien-ho-tsung. (\#), a Harmony of Buddhism and
Tauism, by Wu-shen-yang in the reign of Wan li; three vols. entitled
Wan-shou-hsien-shu. (\#), the same in import as the *yen ling p‘ien* or
Treatise on Longevity The first vol., contains the Eight Ornamental
Sections and the year's illustrations, in every respect identical with
those of the *Tsun sheng pa chien*, except that the list of diseases
which the exercise is designed to cure is very much briefer and more
reasonable. We have followed the earlier work from which this seems to
have been copied. The miscellaneous illustrations in the second vol.,
are identical with those in the *Yen ling p‘ien* noticed above. The
illustrations are inferior as works of art to the *Yen ling p‘ien* from
which apparently they have been copied. My copy is, however, a cheap
edition. The same vol. also contains Hwato's Five animals and also Chen
Hsi-i‘s right and left sleeping exercise which occurs also in the vol.,
on Prevention of Disease in the future, in the *Tsun sheng pa chien*.
The prefaces to most of these works are purely ornamental, conveying no
exact truth or of historical interest.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

Another work in one small vol., one of the smallest, cheapest and most
popular books on Kung-fu, is the Wei-sheng-yi-chin-ching, supposed to be
spurious by scholars. Several abridged editions of this book are sold
under the designation Wei-sheng-yao-shu (\#).

The first mentioned book has a preface by Sung-kwang-so (\#), written in
1875, in which he says that he is a lover of good books, that he visited
a great temple where Kung-fu was practised with advantage to the
original air and vital spirits, protecting not only against disease but
prolonging life and still more of enabling persons to become divine
sages. He had much leisure and was anxious to reprint good books,
dispense medicines and cure serious disease. People from all quarters
praised his good deeds, his own evil thoughts banished, he ate and drank
orderly and discreetly; his one desire was to obtain peace; he spent
much time and labour in searching into prescriptions for the nourishment
of the body, when he came across this book and he was rejoiced to obtain
the benefit of the two books *Hwang-ting* (\#), and *Nei-ching* (\#),
and learned the methods of the genii. He was glad at the possession of
this book and wished others with the same heart as his own, to reap the
same advantage and help them to nourish their bodies.

This is followed by a preface written by Li-ching (\#), a great military
officer of the Tang dynasty, in the second year (529 A.D.) of the second
Emperor of that dynasty. He says in the time of the after Wei (\#), in
the year T'ai-ho (\#), of the Emperor Hsiao-ming (\#), the priest Ta-mo
(\#), (Bodhidharma—the sound of the last two syllables of his Indian
name) arrived at the court of Wu-ti the first Emperor of the Liang
dynasty, where he first dwelt and afterwards removed to the Wei Kingdom,
and dwelt at a temple called Shao-lin-sze (\#). After a residence of 9
years in China (he was 69 years’ old when he arrived in the year 526,
and was the 28th of the patriarchs) he was changed (died) and was buried
at the

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

foot of the Hiung-erh mountain (\#), (between Honan [and](errata.htm#17.md)
Shensi). He left one shoe. When his monument was being repaired after
the course of years, an iron box, unlocked, but firmly fastened with
glue, was found, which on the application of heat was opened. The inside
was filled with wax and it was this that rendered its opening difficult.
Inside were two books, one termed the *Hsi-sui-ching* (\#), the other
the *I-chiu-ching* (\#). The latter had to do with the conservation of
the body. After generations saw nothing of the former, the latter was
found at Shao-lin-sze, written in the language of the country called
T‘ien-chuh (\# India). There was great difficulty in having it
translated. Each one took the best meaning out of it he could and by so
doing obtained the bypath—not the highway, the leaves and branches—not
the stem, and so lost the real method of turning genii. At present the
priests of the temple obtain advantage from the wrestling (method)
merely. One of the more intelligent argued that what Tamo left could not
be unimportant and so he went on a pilgrimage to the O-mei (\#) mountain
in Szechuen in search of one who could translate the work and there met
an Indian priest by name Pan-la-me (\#). To him he spoke of the classic
and reason for his coming. The Indian priest explained the work so far
as was possible, for the language of Buddha cannot be translated, it is
extraordinarily deep, deeper than water. He was invited to stay at the
temple and so got initiated by degrees into the details of Kungfu. In
100 days he became quite strong, in too more his entire body had
received benefit and after the third hundred days he was able for
everything and his constitution became as hard as steel, and he could
aspire to the position of a Buddha. He [accompanied](errata.htm#18.md) the
Indian priest wherever be went. One Hsü-hung met them and obtained from
them the secret method, and he gave it to a red bearded guest who gave
it to the writer of the preface, who tried the method with the best
results and so became a believer. He deeply regretted he did not obtain
the *Hsi-sui-ching* and he also felt regrets that his convictions were
not strong enough to induce him to give up all and follow the priests
and not being able to carry out this plan, he felt as if there was
something a wanting in his heart. He complains of people not having
heard of this work, so

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

he writes this preface to inform them how the work came into his hands
and hopes that through this they may truly learn of Buddha. That each
may attain to the Kungfu of Buddha is the ideal which Tamo had in his
heart in bequeathing this classic. This is an extract and in, part the
substance of the principal part of the preface. Dr. Edkins tells us that
Tamo in carrying out his mystic views, discouraged the use of the sacred
books. His highest aim was the work of the heart. He left Nanking where
the Emperor resided and went to Loyang, the modern Honanfu. For 9 years
he sat with his face to a wall, hence the epithet applied to him—"the
wall-gazing Brahman." He died of old age. Sung-yün who was sent in 518
A.D. to India for Buddhist books by the Prince of the Wei country,
returned and inspected the remains of Tamo. As he lay in his coffin, he
held one shoe in his hand. Sung-yün asked him whither he was going. To
the Western Heaven was the reply. Sung then returned home. The coffin
was afterwards opened and found empty, the shoe alone was lying there.
This shoe was preserved as a relic in the monastery but was stolen in
the T‘ang dynasty.

The succeeding preface appears in the section entitled Physiology of
Kung-fu. The concluding preface is by one Niu-kau, a military officer,
of the Sung dynasty in the 12th year of Shao-hsing the first Emperor of
the Southern Sung (1143). He was an illiterate individual, he says,
ignorant of characters. He was a follower of a
[celebrated](errata.htm#19) general named Yueh-fei (\#.md); he once met a
remarkable priest, so like a *lohan*. In his hand he had a letter which
he gave to him to give to Yueh-fei, who, he said, had divine power—was
able to stretch a bow with the resistance of 100 piculs’ weight, this
strength was given him not by Heaven but by the priest. When a youth he
was my pupil and he practised the Kung-fu most thoroughly. I asked him
to become one of my followers and adopt the doctrine of Buddha which,
however, he said, he did not believe and so left me to prosecute worldly
affairs. He had become a great officer with a great reputation—this
seems his destiny. Give him this letter and let him know the evils of
the world—that he may be in Imperial favour one day and the next day in
disgrace, suffering punishment; that the pursuit of the Buddhistic
doctrines was alone satisfying. Niu was afraid to hear the priest talk
thus—asked his name to which no reply was given. Yueh took the letter
and

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

before finishing the perusal of it he wept and said: he was my master, a
holy priest and if he had not taken care of me I should have died.
Thereupon he brought out of his breast a book and told Niu to take it.
He afterwards lost the Imperial favour; Niu-kau in order to hand down
the work, hid it in a wall in the Sung-hill (\#), that someone hereafter
finding it might propagate it, he himself being destitute of all ability
and in this way obtain some merit and be able to look Yueh-fei in the
face, *i.e.*, do something which would not only not disgrace him but be
a credit to him.

The work begins with the rules for Kung-fu in rhyme to be committed to
memory which we omit as their substance is embraced in the 8 Ornamental
Sections. Next comes a discourse in general. Then follows a chapter on
Membranes.

There are two grand methods included in Kung-fu, the internal and the
external. The internal Method has to do with the Membranes. The body is
[distinguished](errata.htm#20.md) into many parts of which the internal are
the five organs, the six viscera, the animal vigour and the spirit; the
external are the four limbs, the bones, sinews and flesh. These form one
body. The essential part of them are the blood and the animal vigour. To
invigorate these two things are therefore of the first importance in
Kung-fu. The animal vigour and spirit are immaterial but the sinews,
bones and muscles are material. The method is to discipline the material
as the assistants of the immaterial and cultivate the immaterial to aid
the material. These two are intimately related. If it is desired to
discipline the sinews, the animal vigour comes first in order, then the
membranes, and last of all the sinews which is then easy. To discipline
the membranes is difficult but to discipline the animal vigour is the
most difficult of all. The true plan is to lay the foundation in the
difficult. The important part of kung-fu is to nourish the original air
(constitution), to collect the central air, care for the perfect air,
protect the kidney air, nourish the liver air, nurse the lungs and
manage the spleen, transforming the turbid into the pure condition, to
prevent the external things or emotions as grief, desire, and suchlike
from injuring the constitution and thus enable it to become

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

tranquil, pure and even and then united its influence will be
distributed to and felt over the whole body. When it arrives at the
tendons and reaches to the membranes, the entire body is then full of
motion; when the air arrives at the place, the membranes rise and when
the air moves, the membranes are extended, so that the membranes and the
air become equally strong. If the sinews be disciplined and not the
membranes, there is nothing for the membranes to govern and *vice
versâ*, if the two are disciplined and not the air, the two do not
increase in strength, and if *vice versâ*, the air remains weak and
fails to flow to the blood vessels but reciprocally if the sinews are
strong but are not strengthened by the air and membranes, it is like
planting herbs without earth

Pan-la-mi says that disciplining the membranes comes first but in order
to do so, the discipline of the air is the lord or root of the matter.
Most people do not understand the membranes—it is not the fatty
membranes; it is the membranes of the tendons; the former is inside the
middle of the breast, the latter is outside the bones; the membranes are
the things that connect the vessels, arms and body, they protect and are
in contact with the bones and sinews of the body. Comparing the sinews
and membranes, the latter are the softer, they are harder than flesh and
are inside the flesh and outside the bones; they are the substances that
embrace the bones and support the flesh. In kung-fu the air must
traverse to the middle of the membranes, protect the bones, strengthen
and support the sinews which together form one body. This is the whole
of kung-fu.

The discourse on internal vigour embraces three laws. First, protecting
the animal vigour which includes attention to the five senses and
motives. The best way to begin is by kneading, at which time the clothes
are to be opened and the recumbent position adopted, with one palm
placed on the space between the chest and abdomen. This is what is
termed the "medium" where the animal vigour is stored and must be
protected by closing the eyes and ears, equalizing the breath of the
nose, shutting up the breath of the mouth, not overtoiling the strength
of the body, preventing desire and evil thoughts. This is thinking of
the "middle" and the road is then well regulated simply because the
animal vigour, the essence and the spirit are accumulated here. Second,

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

the absence of thought. The animal vigour, the essence and spirit and
also the blood are not independent but are under the control of motives
and follow what the motives originate. It is necessary for the motive to
agree with the palm (of the hand) when protecting the "medium;" if the
motive should jump to another part of the body, the vigour, essence and
spirit will be scattered and then it will become the external not the
internal vigour. Third, the management of a sufficient circulation. The
kneading and guarding have for their object the prevention of the
dissipation of the air which has already been collected into the one
place, the animal vigour, the essence and the blood will follow. By thus
watching over it, we keep it from escaping and kneading it for a long
time, the vigour is stored in the "medium" and prevented from running
over to other parts of the body. Vigour so accumulated, energy will also
accumulate and when the vigour is sufficient, then the energy will
circulate. This air is what Mencius had in view when he said—the
greatest and strongest is the strength of air which can fill the entire
heaven and earth—*i.e.*, air without limit. If the air is not full and
has not circulated, and the motives are scattered, it is not only the
internal but also external robustness that is devoid of strength.

Pan-la-mi held with Mencius that man's nature was originally good, that
the good was gradually covered by the evil which found admission through
the senses, the body and ideas, and clouded the understanding, so that a
partition, as it were, has come in between the individual and the
Doctrine (Tau). So Ta-mo at Shao-lin-sze remained 9 years ignorant of
mundane affairs, and by shutting out the eye and ear was enabled to tie,
as it were, his ideas which are like the monkey or the horse, so fleet
that one cannot catch them, and so the Tau is closed, but shutting up
the senses is like binding these two animals. So Ta-mo secured the true
method and left a shoe and went to the West (died) and thus became one
of the genii. Ta-mo left this true method and the *Show-chung*, (the
shutting out of the world and guarding the "medium" and so preventing
its dissipation). In this way an ignorant person can become wise and a
weak one strong and so arrive quickly at the Happy Land.

The drugs recommended for internal robustness are the following: Take of
Ye-chi-li (Tribulus terrestris.) (\#), (roasted and

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

the seeds removed) Pai-fu-ling (skin removed) Pai-shao-tao (roasted a
little with wine) Show-ti-hwang (prepared with wine) Liquorice (made
with honey) Chu-sha (vermilion, precipitated with water) of each 5
ounces; Ginseng, Pai-shu (roasted with earth) Tang kwei (prepared with
wine) Ch‘wen-hiung of each 1 ounce, powder and with honey make into
pills of 1 mace in weight. Dose: 1 to be swallowed with soup or wine.

It is said that pills made up of so many ingredients, the strength is
not one but must vary and go into different channels, so three
prescriptions are added any one of which may be taken. (1).—Take Chi-li
deprived of its pricks and made into pills with honey and take one or
two mace. (This plant is of extreme value it is said, in bringing
[donkeys](errata.htm#21) rapidly into fine condition..md)

(2).—Chu-sha, 3 candareens, washed in water and swallowed in honey
water.

(3).—Fu-ling, skin removed, powder and make into pills with honey or
take water and mix and so take, or make into a paste and dissolve in
honey water.
