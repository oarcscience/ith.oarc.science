### LIX

### TO KEEP TAO

In governing the people and in worshipping heaven nothing surpasses
moderation. To value moderation, one must form the habit early. Its
early acquisition will result in storing and accumulating vitality. By
storing and accumulating vitality nothing is impossible.

If nothing is impossible then one is ignorant of his limits. If one does
not know his limitations, one may possess the state. He who possesses
moderation is thereby lasting and enduring. It is like having deep roots
and a strong stem. This is of long life and enduring insight the Tao
(way).
