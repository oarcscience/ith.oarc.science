### IMPARTIALITY

Heaven and earth are not like humans, they are impartial. They regard
all things as insignificant, as though they were playthings made of
straw. The wise man is also impartial. To him all men are alike and
unimportant. The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows, it is
empty but does not collapse; it moves and more and more issues. A gossip
is soon empty, it is doubtful if he can be impartial.
