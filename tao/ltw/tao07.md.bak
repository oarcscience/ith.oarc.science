### VII

### HUMILITY

Heaven is eternal, earth is lasting. The reason why heaven and earth are
eternal and lasting is <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> because they do
not live for themselves; that is the reason they will ever endure.

Therefore the wise man will keep his personality out of sight and
because of so doing he will become notable. He subordinates his
personality and therefore it is preserved.

Is it not because he is disinterested, that his own interests are
conserved?
