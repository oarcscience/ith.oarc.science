### LXIX

### THE FUNCTION OF THE MYSTERIOUS

A military expert has said: I do not dare put myself forward as a host,
but always act as a guest. I hesitate to advance an inch, but am willing
to withdraw a foot.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

This is advancing by not advancing, it is winning without arms, it is
charging without hostility, it is seizing without weapons. There is no
mistake greater than making light of an enemy. By making light of an
enemy we lose our treasure.

Therefore when well-matched armies come to conflict, the one who is
conscious of his weakness conquers.
