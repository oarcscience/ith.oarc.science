### XLIX

### THE VIRTUE (TEH) OF TRUST

The wise man has no fixed heart; in the hearts of the people he finds
his own. The good he treats <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> with
goodness; the not-good he also treats with goodness, for teh is
goodness. The faithful ones he treats with good faith; the unfaithful he
also treats with good faith, for teh is good faith.

The wise man lives in the world but he lives cautiously, dealing with
the world cautiously. He universalizes his heart; the people give him
their eyes and ears, but he treats them as his children.
