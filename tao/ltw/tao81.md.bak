### LXXXI

### THE NATURE OF THE ESSENTIAL

Faithful words are often not pleasant; pleasant words are often not
faithful. Good men do not dispute; the ones who dispute are not good.
The learned men are often not the wise men, nor the wise men, the
learned. The wise man does not hoard, but ever working for others, he
will the more exceedingly acquire. Having given to others freely, he
himself will have in plenty. Tao of heaven benefits but does not injure.
The wise man's Tao leads him to act but not to quarrel.
