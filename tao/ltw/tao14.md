### XIV

### IN PRAISE OF THE PROFOUND

It is unseen because it is colorless; it is unheard because it is
soundless; when seeking to grasp it, it eludes one, because it is
incorporeal.

Because of these qualities it cannot be examined, and yet they form an
essential unity. Superficially it appears abstruse, but in its depths it
is not obscure. It has been nameless forever! It appears and then
disappears. It is what is known as the form of the formless, the image
of the imageless. It is called the transcendental, its face (or destiny)
cannot be seen in front, or its back (or origin) behind.

But by holding fast to the Tao of the ancients, the wise man may
understand the present, because he knows the origin of the past. This is
the clue to the Tao.
