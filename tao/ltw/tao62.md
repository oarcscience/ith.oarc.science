### LXII

### THE PRACTICE OF TAO

The Tao is the asylum of all things; the good man's treasure, the bad
man's last resort. With beautiful words one may sell goods but in
winning people one can accomplish more by kindness. Why should a man be
thrown away for his evil? To conserve him was the Emperor appointed and
the three ministers.

Better than being in the presence of the Emperor and riding with four
horses, is sitting and explaining this Tao.

The reason the Ancients esteemed Tao was because if sought it was
obtained, and because by it he that hath sin could be saved. Is it not
so? Therefore the world honors Tao.
