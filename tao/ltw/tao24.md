### XXIV

### TROUBLES AND MERIT

It is not natural to stand on tiptoe, or being astride one does not
walk. One who displays himself is not bright, or one who asserts himself
cannot shine. A self-approving man has no merit, nor does one who
praises himself grow.

The relation of these things (self-display, self-assertion,
self-approval) to Tao is the same as offal is to food. They are
excrescences from the system; they are detestable; Tao does not dwell in
them.
