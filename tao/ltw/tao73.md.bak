### LXXIII

### ACTION IS DANGEROUS

Courage carried to daring leads to death. Courage restrained by caution
leads to life. These two things, courage and caution, are sometimes
beneficial and sometimes harmful. Some things are rejected by heaven,
who can tell the reason? Therefore the wise man deems all acting
difficult.

The Tao of heaven does not quarrel, yet it conquers. It speaks not, yet
its response is good. It issues no summons but things come to it
naturally because its devices are good. Heaven's net is vast, indeed!
its meshes are wide but it loses nothing.
