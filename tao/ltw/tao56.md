### LVI

### THE TEH OF THE MYSTERIOUS

The one who knows does not speak; the one who speaks does not know. The
wise man shuts his mouth and closes his gates. He softens his <span
id="page_40">p. 40</span> sharpness, unravels his tangles, dims his
brilliancy, and reckons himself with the mysterious.

He is inaccessible to favor or hate; he cannot be reached by profit or
injury; he cannot be honored or humiliated. Thereby he is honored by
all.
