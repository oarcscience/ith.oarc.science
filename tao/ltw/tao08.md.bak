### VIII

### THE NATURE OF GOODNESS

True goodness is like water, in that it benefits everything and harms
nothing. Like water it ever seeks the lowest place, the place that all
others avoid. It is closely kin to the Tao.

For a dwelling it chooses the quiet meadow; for a heart the circling
eddy. In generosity it is kind; in speech it is sincere; in authority it
is order; in affairs it is ability; in movement it is rhythm.

Inasmuch as it is always peaceable it is never rebuked.
