### XXII

### INCREASE BY HUMILITY

At that time the deficient will be made perfect; the distorted will be
straightened; the empty will be filled; the worn out will be renewed;
those having little will obtain and those having much will be overcome.

Therefore the wise man, embracing unity as he does, will become the
world's model. Not pushing himself forward he will become enlightened;
not asserting himself he will become distinguished; not boasting of
himself he will acquire merit; not approving himself he will endure.
Forasmuch as he will not quarrel, the world will not quarrel with him.

Is the old saying, "The crooked shall be made straight," a false saying?
Indeed, no! They will be perfected and return rejoicing.
