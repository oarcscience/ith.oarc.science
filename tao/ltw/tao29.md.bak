### XXIX

### NOT FORCING THINGS (WU WEI)

One who desires to take and remake the Empire will fail. The Empire is a
divine thing that cannot be remade. He who attempts it will only mar it.

He who seeks to grasp it, will lose it. People differ, some lead, others
follow; some are ardent, others are formal; some are strong, others
weak; some succeed, others fail. Therefore the wise man practices
moderation; he abandons pleasure, extravagance and indulgence.
