### LXXX

### CONTENTMENT

In a small country with few people let there be officers over tens and
hundreds but not to exercise power. Let the people be not afraid of
death, nor desire to move to a distance. Then though there be ships and
carriages, they will have no occasion to use them. Though there be armor
and weapons there will be no occasion for donning them. The people can
return to <span id="page_52">p. 52</span> knotted cords for their
records, they can delight in their food, be proud of their clothes, be
content with their dwellings, rejoice in their customs.

Other states may be close neighbors, their cocks and dogs may be
mutually heard, people will come to old age and die but will have no
desire to go or come.
