### LXXIV

### OVERCOMING DELUSIONS

If the people do not fear death, how can one frighten them with death?
If we teach people to fear death, then when one rebels he can be seized
and executed; after that who will dare to rebel?

There is always an officer to execute a murderer, but if one takes the
place of the executioner, it is like taking the place of a skilled
carpenter at his hewing. If one takes the place of the skilled carpenter
he is liable to cut himself. (Therefore do not interfere with Tao.)
