### XI

### THE VALUE OF NON-EXISTENCE

Although the wheel has thirty spokes its utility lies in the emptiness
of the hub. The jar is made by kneading clay, but its usefulness
consists in its capacity. A room is made by cutting out windows and
doors through the walls, but the space the walls contain measures the
room's value.

In the same way matter is necessary to form, but the value of reality
lies in its immateriality.

(Or thus: a material body is necessary to existence, but the value of a
life is measured by its immaterial soul.)
