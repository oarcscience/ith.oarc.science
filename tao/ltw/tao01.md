# TAO TEH KING

### I

### WHAT IS THE TAO

The Tao that can be understood cannot be the primal, or cosmic, Tao,
just as an idea that can be expressed in words cannot be the infinite
idea.

And yet this ineffable Tao was the source of all spirit and matter, and
being expressed was the mother of all created things.

Therefore not to desire the things of sense is to know the freedom of
spirituality; and to desire is to learn the limitation of matter. These
two things spirit and matter, so different in nature, have the same
origin. This unity of origin is the mystery of mysteries, but it is the
gateway to spirituality.
