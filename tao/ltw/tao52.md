### LII

### RETURN TO ORIGIN

When creation began, Tao became the world's mother. When one knows one's
mother he will m turn know that he is her son. When he recognizes his
sonship, he will in turn keep to his mother and to the end of life will
be free from danger.

He who closes his mouth and shuts his sense gates will be free from
trouble to the end of life. He who opens his mouth and meddles with
affairs cannot be free from trouble even to the end of life.

To recognize one's insignificance is called enlightenment. To keep one's
sympathy is called strength. He who uses Tao's light returns to Tao's
enlightenment and does not surrender his person to perdition. This is
called practicing the eternal.
