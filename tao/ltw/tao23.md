### XXIII

### EMPTINESS AND NOT-DOING (WU WEI)

Taciturnity is natural to man. A whirlwind never outlasts the morning,
nor a violent rain the day. What is the cause? It is heaven and <span
id="page_22">p. 22</span> earth. If even heaven and earth are not
constant, much less can man be.

Therefore he who pursues his affairs in the spirit of Tao will become
Tao-like. He who pursues his affairs with teh, will become teh-like. He
who pursues his affairs with loss, identifies himself with loss.

He who identifies himself with Tao, Tao rejoices to guide. He who
identifies himself with teh, teh rejoices to reward. And he who
identifies himself with loss, loss rejoices to ruin.

If his faith fail, he will receive no reward of faith.
