### LXXV

### LOSS BY GREEDINESS

Starvation of a people comes when an official appropriates to himself
too much of the taxes. The reason a people are difficult to govern is
because the officials are too meddlesome; the people make light of death
because they are so absorbed in life's interests. The one who is not
absorbed in life is more moral than he who esteems life.
