### XXXIV

### THE PERFECTION OF TRUST

Great Tao is all pervading! It can be on both the right hand and the
left. Everything relies upon it for their existence, and it does not
fail them. It acquires merit but covets not the title. It lovingly
nourishes everything, but does not claim the rights of ownership. It has
no desires, it can be classed with the small. Everything returns to it,
yet it does not claim the right of ownership. It can be classed with the
great.

Therefore the wise man to the end will not pose as a great man, and by
so doing will express his true greatness.
