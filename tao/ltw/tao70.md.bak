### LXX

### THE DIFFICULTY OF UNDERSTANDING

My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice,
yet in all the world no one appears to understand them or to practice
them.

Words have an ancestor (a preceding idea), deeds have a master (a
preceding purpose), and just as these are often not understood, so I am
not understood.

They who understand me are very few, and on that account I am worthy of
honor. The wise man wears wool (rather than silk) and keeps his gems out
of sight.
