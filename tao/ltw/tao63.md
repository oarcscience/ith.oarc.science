### LXIII

### A CONSIDERATION OF BEGINNINGS

One should avoid assertion (wu wei) and practice inaction. One should
learn to find taste in the tasteless, to enlarge the small things, and
multiply the few. He should respond to hatred with kindness. He should
resolve a difficulty while it is easy, and manage a great thing while it
is small. Surely all the world's difficulties arose from slight causes,
and all the world's great affairs had small beginnings.

Therefore the wise man avoids to the end participation in great affairs
and by so doing establishes his greatness.

Rash promises are lacking in faith and many things that appear easy are
full of difficulties. Therefore the wise man considers every thing
difficult and so to the end he has no difficulties.
