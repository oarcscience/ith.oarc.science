### LXVII

### THREE TREASURES

All the world calls Tao great, yet it is by nature immaterial. It is
because a thing is seemingly unreal that it is great. If a man affects
to be great, how long can he conceal his mediocrity?

Tao has three treasures which he guards and cherishes. The first is
called compassion; the second is called economy; the third is called
<span id="page_46">p. 46</span> humility. A man that is compassionate
can 'be truly brave; if a man is economical he can be generous; if he is
humble he can become a useful servant.

If one discards compassion and is still brave, abandons economy and is
still generous, forsakes humility and still seeks to be serviceable, his
days are numbered. On the contrary if one is truly compassionate, in
battle he will be a conqueror and in defence he will be secure. When
even Heaven helps people it is because of compassion that she does so.
