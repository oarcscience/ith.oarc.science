### XV

### THAT WHICH REVEALS TEH

In olden times the ones who were considered worthy to be called masters
were subtle, spiritual, profound, wise. Their thoughts could not be
easily understood.

Since they were hard to understand I will try to make them clear. They
were cautious like men wading a river in winter. They were reluctant
like men who feared their neighbors. <span id="page_18">p. 18</span>
They were reserved like guests in the presence of their host. They were
elusive like ice at the point of melting. They were like unseasoned
wood. They were like a valley between high mountains. They were obscure
like troubled waters. (They were cautious because they were conscious of
the deeper meanings of life and its possibilities.)

We can clarify troubled waters by slowly quieting them. We can bring the
unconscious to life by slowly moving them. But he who has the secret of
the Tao does not desire for more. Being content, he is able to mature
without desire to be newly fashioned.
