# INTRODUCTION

I LOVE LAOTZU! That is the reason I offer another interpretative
translation, and try to print and bind it attractively. I want you to
appreciate this wise and kindly old man, and come to love him. He was
perhaps the first of scholars (6th century B.C.) to have a vision of
spiritual reality, and he tried so hard to explain it to others, only,
in the end, to wander away into the Great Unknown in pathetic
discouragement. Everything was against him; his friends misunderstood
him; others made fun of him.

Even the written characters which he must use to preserve his thought
conspired against him. They were only five thousand in all, and were ill
adapted to express mystical and abstract ideas. When these characters
are translated accurately, the translation is necessarily awkward and
obscure. Sinologues have unintentionally done him an injustice by their
very scholarship. I have tried to peer through the clumsy characters
into his heart and prayed that love for him would make me wise to
understand aright.

I hate scholarship that would deny his existence, or arrogant erudition
that says patronizingly, "Oh, yes, there doubtless was some one who
wrote some of the characteristic sonnets,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

but most of them are an accumulation through the centuries of verses
that have similar structure, and all have been changed and amended until
it is better to call the book a collection of aphorisms."

Shame on scholarship when, sharing the visions of the illuminati, they
deride them!

There are three great facts in China to-day that vouch for Laotzu.
First, the presence of Taoism,--which was suggested by his teachings,
not founded upon them. This is explained by the inability of the
scholars, who immediately followed him to understand and appreciate the
spirituality of his teachings. Second, Confucian dislike for Laotzian
ideas, which is explained by their opposition to Confucian ethics.
Third, and the greatest fact of all, is the characteristic traits of
Chinese nature, namely, passivity, submissiveness and moral concern, all
of which find an adequate cause and source in the teachings of Laotzu.

An interesting fact in regard to the thought of Laotzu is this. Although
for two thousand years he has been misunderstood and derided, to-day the
very best of scientific and philosophic thought, which gathers about
what is known as Vitalism, is in full accord with Laotzu's idea of the
Tao. Every reference that is made to-day to a Cosmic Urge, Vital
Impulse, and Creative Principle can be said of the Tao. Everything that
can be said of Plato's Ideas and Forms and of Cosmic Love as being the
creative expression of God can

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

be said of the Tao. When Christian scholars came to translate the Logos
of St. John, they were satisfied to use the word "Tao."

It is true that Laotzu's conception of the Tao was limited to a
conception of a universal, creative principle. He apparently had no
conception of personality, which the Christians ascribe to God, in
connection with it, but he ascribed so much of wisdom and benevolence to
it that his conception fell little short of personality. To Laotzu, the
Tao is the universal and eternal principle which forms and conditions
everything; it is that intangible cosmic influence which harmonizes all
things and brings them to fruition; it is the norm and standard of truth
and morality. Laotzu did more than entertain an intelligent opinion of
Tao as a creative principle; he had a devout and religious sentiment
towards it: "He loved the Tao as a son cherishes and reveres his
mother."

There are three key words in the thought of Laotzu: Tao, Teh, and Wu
Wei. They are all difficult to translate. The simple meaning of Tao is
"way," but it also has a wide variety of other meanings Dr. Paul Carus
translates it, "Reason," but apologizes for so doing. If forced to offer
a translation we would suggest Creative Principle, but much prefer to
leave it untranslated.

The character, "Teh," is usually translated "virtue." This is correct as
a mere translation of the, character, but is in, no sense adequate.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

to the content of the thought in Laotzu's mind. To him, Teh meant
precisely what is meant in the account of the healing of the woman who
touched the hem of Jesus' robe: "Jesus was conscious that *virtue* had
passed from him." Teh includes the meaning of vitality, of virility, of
beauty and the harmony that we think of as that part of life that is
abounding and joyous. The third word is the negative expression, "Wu
Wei." Translated, this means "not acting," or "non-assertion." When
Laotzu urges men to "wu wei," he is not urging them to laziness or
asceticism. He means that all men are to cherish that wise humility and
diffidence and selflessness which comes from a consciousness that the
Tao is infinitely wise and good, and that the part of human wisdom is to
hold one's self in such a restrained and receptive manner that the Tao
may find one a suitable and conforming channel for its purpose. The
title of Laotzu's book, Tao Teh King, is carelessly translated, The Way
of Virtue Classic, or The Way and Virtue Classic. This is very
inadequate. The Vitality of the Tao is very much better.

Most commentators think that Laotzu's teachings fit in especially well
with Buddhist philosophy This conclusion is arrived at by the common
interpretation of wu wei as submission that will logically end in
absorption of the spirit in Tao as Nirvana. This understanding of wu
wei, which Henri Borel shares in a measure,

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

is, we believe, incorrect, inasmuch as Laotzu consistently teaches a
*finding* of life rather than a losing of it. Laotzu's conception of Tao
as the underived Source of all things, finding expression through
spiritual Teh in universal creative activity, is very close to Plato's
doctrine of the good as the One ineffable Source of all things, whose
Ideas and Forms of Goodness, Truth and Beauty radiated outward as
spiritual logos in creative activity through Spirit, Soul and Nature to
the farthest confines of matter.

While it is true that Laotzu's teachings would find little in common
with the Old Testament anthropomorphic autocracy, and would find almost
nothing in common with the modern Ritschlean system of ethical idealism
which has for its basis a naturalistic evolution of human society by
means of philanthropy, laws, cultural civilizations, and human
governments backed by force of arms, nevertheless his teachings are
entirely in harmony with that Christian philosophy of the Logos, which
is a heritage from the Greeks, through Plato, Philo, St. Paul, Plotinus,
and Augustine, and which is the basis of the mystical faith of the
Christian saints of all ages. While Laotzu would find little in common
with the busy, impertinent activities of so-called Christian statesman
building by statecraft and war, he would find much in common with
Apostolic Christianity which held itself aloof from current politics and
refused to enter the army, content to live simply, quietly, full of
faith and humble benevolence.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

And most of all would he find himself in sympathy with the teacher of
Nazareth. At almost every Sonnet, one thinks of some corresponding
expression of Jesus, who had a very similar conception of God, but who
recognized in Him that personal element of Love which made God not only
Creative Principle but Heavenly Father.

Laotzu's vision of the virile harmony, goodness, and Spirituality of the
Tao was what Jesus saw as the Fatherhood of God, self-expressing his
love-nature endlessly in all creative effort, and, through universal
intuition, endlessly drawing his creation back to himself in grateful
and humble affection. Laotzu saw in a glass darkly what Jesus saw face
to face in all his glory, the Divine Tao, God as creative and redemptive
Love.

As you read these verses, forget the words and phrases, poor material
and poor workmanship at best, look through them for the soul of Laotzu.
It is there revealed, but so imperfectly that it is only an apparition
of a soul. But if by it, vague as it is, you come to love Laotzu, you
will catch beyond him fleeting glimpses of the splendid visions that so
possessed his soul, visions of Infinite Goodness, Humility and Beauty
radiating from the Heart of creation.

DWIGHT GODDARD.
