### LXXIX

### ENFORCING CONTRACTS

When reconciling great hatred there will some remain. How can it be made
good?

not have to enforce payment from others. They who have virtue (teh) keep
their obligations, they who have no virtue insist on their rights. Tao
of heaven has no favorites but always helps the good man.
