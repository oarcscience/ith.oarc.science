### LIII

### GAIN BY INSIGHT

Even if one has but a little knowledge he can walk in the ways of the
great Tao; it is only self-assertion that one need fear.

The great Tao (Way) is very plain, but people prefer the bypaths. When
the palace is very splendid, the fields are likely to be very weedy, and
the granaries empty. To wear ornaments and gay colors, to carry sharp
swords, to be excessive in eating and drinking, and to have wealth and
treasure in abundance is to know the pride of robbers. This is contrary
to Tao.
