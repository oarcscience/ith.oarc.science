### XXX

### BE STINGY OF WAR

When the magistrate follows Tao, he has no need to resort to force of
arms to strengthen the Empire, because his business methods alone will
show good returns.

Briars and thorns grow rank where an army camps. Bad harvests are the
sequence of a great war. The good ruler will be resolute and then stop,
he dare not take by force. One should be resolute but not boastful;
resolute but not <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> haughty; resolute but
not arrogant; resolute but yielding when it cannot be avoided; resolute
but he must not resort to violence.

By a resort to force, things flourish for a time but then decay. This is
not like the Tao and that which is not Tao-like will soon cease.
