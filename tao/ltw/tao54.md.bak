### LIV

### TO CULTIVATE INTUITION

The thing that is well planted is not easily uprooted. The thing that is
well guarded is not easily taken away. If one has sons and grandsons,
the offering of ancestral worship will not soon cease.

He who practices Tao in his person shows that his teh is real. The
family that practices it shows that their teh is abounding. The township
that practices it shows that their teh is enduring. The state that
practices it shows that their teh is prolific. The empire that practices
it reveals that teh is universal. Thereby one person becomes a test of
other persons, one family of other families, one town of other towns,
one <span id="page_39">p. 39</span> county of other counties, and one
empire of all empires.

How do I know that this test is universal? By this same Tao.
