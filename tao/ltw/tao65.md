### LXV

### THE TEH OF SIMPLICITY

In the olden days those who obeyed the spirit of Tao did not enlighten
the people but kept them simple hearted.

The reason people are difficult to govern is because of their smartness;
likewise to govern a people with guile is a curse; and to govern them
with simplicity is a blessing. He who <span id="page_45">p. 45</span>
remembers these two things is a model ruler. Always to follow this
standard and rule is teh, the profound.

Profound teh is deep indeed and far reaching. The very opposite of
common things, but by it one obtains obedient subjects.
