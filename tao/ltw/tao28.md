### XXVIII

### RETURNING TO SIMPLICITY

He who knows his manhood and understands his womanhood becomes useful
like the valleys of earth (which bring water). Being like the valleys of
earth, eternal vitality (teh) will not depart from him, he will come
again to the nature of a little child.

He who knows his innocence and recognizes his sin becomes the world's
model. Being a world's model, infinite teh will not fail, he will return
to the Absolute.

He who knows the glory of his nature and recognizes also his limitations
becomes useful like the world's valleys. Being like the world's <span
id="page_25">p. 25</span> valleys, eternal teh will not fail him, he
will revert to simplicity.

Radiating simplicity he will make of men vessels of usefulness. The wise
man then will employ them as officials and chiefs. A great
administration of such will harm no one.
