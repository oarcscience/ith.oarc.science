### LXIV

### CONSIDER THE INSIGNIFICANT

That which is at rest is easily restrained, that which has not yet
appeared is easily prevented. <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> The weak
is easily broken, the scanty is easily scattered. Consider a difficulty
before it arises, and administer affairs before they become
disorganized. A tree that it takes both arms to encircle grew from a
tiny rootlet. A pagoda of nine stories was erected by placing small
bricks. A journey of three thousand miles begins with one step. If one
tries to improve a thing, he mars it; if he seizes it, he loses it. The
wise man, therefore, not attempting to form things does not mar them,
and not grasping after things he does not lose them. The people in their
rush for business are ever approaching success but continually failing.
One must be as careful to the end as at the beginning if he is to
succeed.

Therefore the wise man desires to be free from desire, he does not value
the things that are difficult of attainment. He learns to be unlearned,
he returns to that which all others ignore. In that spirit he helps all
things toward their natural development, but dares not interfere.
