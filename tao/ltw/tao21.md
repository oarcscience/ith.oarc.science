### XXI

### THE HEART OF EMPTINESS

All the innumerable forms of teh correspond to the norm of Tao, but the
nature of the Tao's activity is infinitely abstract and illusive.
Illusive and obscure, indeed, but at its heart are <span id="page_21">p.
21</span> forms and types. Vague and illusive, indeed, but at its heart
is all being. Unfathomable and obscure, indeed, but at its heart is all
spirit, and spirit is reality. At its heart is truth.

From of old its expression is unceasing, it has been present at all
beginnings. How do I know that its nature is thus? By this same Tao.
