<p>When great men rule, subjects know little of their existence. Rulers who are less great win the affection and praise of their subjects. A common ruler is feared by his subjects, and an unworthy ruler is despised.</p>  
<p>When a ruler lacks faith, you may seek in vain for it among his subjects.</p>  
<p>How carefully a wise ruler chooses his words. He performs deeds, and accumulates merit! Under such a ruler the people think they are ruling themselves.</p>
