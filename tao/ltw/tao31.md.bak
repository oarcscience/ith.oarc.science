### XXXI

### AVOIDING WAR

Even successful arms, among all implements, are unblessed. All men come
to detest them. Therefore the one who follows Tao does not rely on them.
Arms are of all tools unblessed, they are not the implements of a wise
man. Only as a last resort does he use them.

Peace and quietude are esteemed by the wise man, and even when
victorious he does not rejoice, because rejoicing over a victory is the
same as rejoicing over the killing of men. If he rejoices over killing
men, do you think he will ever really master the Empire?

In propitious affairs the place of honor is the left, but in
unpropitious affairs we honor the right.

The strong man while at home esteems the left as the place of honor, but
when armed for war it is as though he esteems the right hand, the place
of less honor.

Thus a funeral ceremony is so arranged. The place of a subordinate army
officer is also on the left and the place of his superior officer is on
the right. The killing of men fills multitudes <span id="page_27">p.

honor the victor as if he was attending a funeral ceremony.
