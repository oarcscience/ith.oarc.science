### LXVI

### TO SUBORDINATE SELF

The reason rivers and seas are called the kings of the valley is because
they keep below them.

Therefore the wise man desiring to be above his people must in his
demeanor keep below them; wishing to benefit his people, he must ever
keep himself out of sight.

The wise man dwells above, yet the people do not feel the burden; he is
the leader and the people suffer no harm. Therefore the world rejoices
to exalt him and never wearies of him.

Because he will not quarrel with anyone, no one can quarrel with him.
