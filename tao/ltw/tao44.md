### XLIV

### PRECEPTS

Which is nearer, a name or a person? Which is more, personality or
treasure? Is it more painful to gain or to suffer loss?

Extreme indulgence certainly greatly wastes. Much hoarding certainly
invites severe loss.

A contented person is not despised. One who knows when to stop is not
endangered; he will be able therefore to continue.
