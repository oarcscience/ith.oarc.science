### XVII

### SIMPLICITY OF HABIT

When great men rule, subjects know little of their existence. Rulers who
are less great win the affection and praise of their subjects. A common
ruler is feared by his subjects, and an unworthy ruler is despised.

When a ruler lacks faith, you may seek in vain for it among his
subjects.

How carefully a wise ruler chooses his words. He performs deeds, and
accumulates merit! Under such a ruler the people think they are ruling
themselves.
