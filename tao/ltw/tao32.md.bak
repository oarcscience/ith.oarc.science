### XXXII

### THE VIRTUE (TEH) OF HOLINESS

Tao in its eternal aspect is unnamable. Its simplicity appears
insignificant, but the whole world cannot control it. If princes and
kings employ it every one of themselves will pay willing homage. Heaven
and Earth by it are harmoniously combined and drop sweet dew. People
will have no need of rulers, because of themselves they will be
righteous.

As soon as Tao expresses itself in orderly creation then it becomes
comprehensible. When one recognizes the presence of Tao he understands
where to stop. Knowing where to stop he is free from danger.

To illustrate the nature of Tao's place in the universe: Tao is like the
brooks and streams in their relation to the great rivers and the ocean.
