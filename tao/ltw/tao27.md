### XXVII

### THE FUNCTION OF SKILL

Good walkers leave no tracks, good speakers make no errors, good
counters need no abacus, <span id="page_24">p. 24</span> good wardens
have no need for bolts and locks for no one can get by them. Good
binders can dispense with rope and cord, yet none can unloose their
hold.

Therefore the wise man trusting in goodness always saves men, for there
is no outcast to him. Trusting in goodness he saves all things for there
is nothing valueless to him. This is recognizing concealed values.

Therefore the good man is the instructor of the evil man, and the evil
man is the good man's wealth. He who does not esteem his instructors or
value his wealth, though he be otherwise intelligent, becomes confused.
Herein lies the significance of spirituality.
