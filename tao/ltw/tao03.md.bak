### III

### QUIETING PEOPLE

Neglecting to praise the worthy deters people from emulating them; just
as not prizing rare treasures deters a man from becoming a thief; or
ignoring the things which awaken desire keeps the heart at rest.

Therefore the wise ruler does not suggest unnecessary things, but seeks
to satisfy the minds of his people. He seeks to allay appetites but
strengthen bones. He ever tries by keeping people in ignorance to keep
them satisfied and those who have knowledge he restrains from evil. If
he, himself, practices restraint then everything is in quietness.
