<p>The reason rivers and seas are called the kings of the valley is because they keep below them.</p>  
<p>Therefore the wise man desiring to be above his people must in his demeanor keep below them; wishing to benefit his people, he must ever keep himself out of sight.</p>  
<p>The wise man dwells above, yet the people do not feel the burden; he is the leader and the people suffer no harm. Therefore the world rejoices to exalt him and never wearies of him.</p>  
<p>Because he will not quarrel with anyone, no one can quarrel with him.</p>
