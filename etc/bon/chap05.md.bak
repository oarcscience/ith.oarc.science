CHAPTER V.  
THE SILLY SON.

<img src="images/image016.png" width="94" height="94" alt="A" />MONG the
favourite jests of all Peoples, from Iceland to Japan, from India to
England, are the droll adventures and mishaps of the silly son, who
contrives to muddle everything he is set to do. In vain does his poor
mother try to direct him in "the way he should go": she gets him a wife,
as a last resource; but a fool he is still, and a fool he will always
be. His blunders and disasters are chronicled in penny chap-books and in
nursery rhymes, of infinite variety. Who has not heard how

> Simple Simon went a-fishing  
> For to catch a whale,  
> But all the water he had got  
> Was in his mother's pail?

an adventure which recalls another nursery rhyme regarding Simon's still
more celebrated prototypes:

<span id="p.122">p.122</span>

> Three men of Gotham  
> Went to sea in a bowl;  
> If the bowl had been stronger,  
> My tale had been longer.

Then there is the prose history of *Simple Simon's Misfortunes; or, his
Wife Marjory's Outrageous Cruelty,* which tells (2) of Simon's wedding,
and how his wife Marjory scolded him for putting on his roast-meat
clothes (*i.e.,* Sunday clothes) the very next morning after he was
married; (2) how she dragged him up the chimney in a basket,
a-smoke-drying, wherein they used to dry bacon, which made him look like
a red herring; (3) how Simon lost a sack of corn as he was going to the
mill to have it ground; (4) how Simon went to market with a basket of
eggs, but broke them by the way: also how he was put into the stocks;
(5) how Simon's wife cudgelled him for not bringing her money for the
eggs; (6) how Simon lost his wife's pail and burnt the bottom of her
kettle; (7) how Simon's wife sent him to buy two pounds of soap, but
going over the bridge, he let his money fall in the river: also how a
ragman ran away with his clothes. No wonder if, after this crowning
misfortune, poor Simon "drank a bottle of sack, to poison himself, as
being weary of his life"!

Again, we have *The Unfortunate Son; or,*

<span id="p.123">p.123</span>

*a Kind Wife is worth Gold, being full of Mirth and Pastime,* which
commences thus:

> There was a man but one son had,  
> And he was all his joy;  
> But still his fortune was but bad,  
> Though he was a pretty boy.
>
> His father sent him forth one day  
> To feed a flock of sheep,  
> And half of them were stole away  
> While he lay down asleep!
>
> Next day he went with one Tom Goff  
> To reap as he was seen,  
> When he did cut his fingers off,  
> The sickle was so keen!

Another of the chap-book histories of noodles is that of *Simple John
and his Twelve Misfortunes,* an imitation of *Simple Simon;* it was
still popular amongst the rustics of Scotland fifty years ago.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The adventures of Silly Matt, the Norwegian counterpart of our typical
English booby, as related in Asbjornson's collection of Norse
folk-tales, furnish some curious examples of the transmission of popular
fictions:

The mother of Silly Matt tells him one day that he should build a bridge
across the river

<span id="p.124">p.124</span>

and take toll of every one who wished to go over it; so he sets to work
with a will, and when the bridge is finished, stands at one end--"at the
receipt of custom." Three men come up with loads of hay, and Matt
demands toll of them, so they each give him a wisp of hay. Next comes a
pedlar, with all sorts of small wares in his pack, and Matt gets from
him two needles. On his return home his mother asks him what he has got
that day. "Hay and needles," says Matt. Well! and what had he done with
the hay? "I put some of it in my mouth," quoth he, "and as it tasted
like grass, I threw it into the river." She says he ought to have spread
it on the byre-floor. "Very good," replies the dutiful Matt; "I'll
remember that next time." And what had he done with the needles? He
stuck them into the hay. "Ah," says the mother, "you should rather have
stuck them in and out of your cap, and brought them home to me." Well!
well! Matt will not forget to do so next time. The following day a man
comes to the bridge with a sack of meal and gives Matt a pound of it;
then comes a smith, who gives him a gimlet: the meal he spread on the
byre-floor, and the gimlet he stuck in and out of his cap. His mother
tells him he should have come home for a bucket to hold the meal, and
the gimlet he should have put up his sleeve. Very good!

<span id="p.125">p.125</span>

Matt will not forget next time. Another day some men come to the bridge
with kegs of brandy, of which Matt gets a pint, and pours it into his
sleeve; next comes a man driving some goats and their young ones, and
gives Matt a kid, which he treads down into a bucket. His mother says he
should have led the goat home with a cord round its neck, and put the
brandy in a pail. Next day he gets a pat of butter and drags it home
with a string. After this his mother despairs of his improvement, till
it occurs to her that he might not be such a noodle if he had a wife. So
she bids him go and see whether he cannot find some lass who will take
him for a husband. Should he meet any folk on his way, he ought to say
to them, "God's peace!" Matt accordingly sets off in quest of a wife,
and meets a she-wolf and her seven cubs. "God's peace!" says Matt, and
then returns home. When his mother learns of this, she tells him he
should have cried, "Huf! huf! you jade wolf!" Next day he goes off
again, and meeting a bridal party, he cries, "Huf! huf! you jade wolf!"
and goes back to his mother and acquaints her of this fresh adventure.
"O you great silly!" says she; "you should have said, 'Ride happily,
bride and bridegroom!'" Once more Matt sets out to seek a wife, and
seeing on the road a bear taking a ride on a horse,

<span id="p.126">p.126</span>

he exclaims joyfully, "Ride happily, bride and bridegroom!" and then
returns home. His mother, on hearing of this new piece of folly, tells
him he should have cried, "To the devil with you!" Again he sets out,
and meeting a funeral procession, he roars, "To the devil with you!" His
mother says he should have cried, "May your poor soul have mercy!" and
sends him off for the fifth time to look for a lass. On the road he sees
some gipsies busy skinning a dead dog, upon which he piously exclaims,
"May your poor soul have mercy!" His mother now goes herself to get him
a wife, finds a lass that is willing to marry him, and invites her to
dinner. She privately tells Matt how he should comport himself in the
presence of his sweetheart; he should cast an eye at her now and then.
Matt understands her instruction most literally: stealing into the
sheepfold, he plucks out the eyes of all the sheep and goats, and puts
them in his pocket. When he is seated beside his sweetheart, he casts a
"sheep's eye" at her, which hits her on the nose.\[1\]

This last incident, as we have seen, occurs in the *Talrs of the Men of
Gotham* (*ante,* p. 41), and it is also found in a Venetian

\[1\] Abridged from the story of "Silly Matt" in Sir George W. Dasent's
*Tales from the Fjeld.*

<span id="p.127">p.127</span>

story (Bernoni, *Fiabe,* No. 11), entitled "The Fool," of which the
following is the first part:

Once upon a time there was a mother who had a son with little brains.
One morning she said, "We must get up early, for we have to make bread."
So they both rose early, and began to make bread. The mother made the
loaves, but took no pains to make them the same size. Her son said to
her finally, "How small you have made this loaf, mother.'' "Oh," said
she, "it does not matter whether they are big or little, for the proverb
says, 'Large and small, all must go to mass.'" "Good! good!" said her
son. When the bread was made, instead of taking it to the baker's, the
son took it to the church, for it was the hour for mass, saying, "My
mother said that, 'large and small, all must go to mass.'" So he threw
the loaves down in the middle of the church. Then he went home to his
mother, and said, "I have done what you told me to do." "Good! Did you
take the bread to the baker's?" "O mother, if you had seen how they all
looked at me!" "You might also have cast an eye on them in return," said
his mother. "Wait; wait. I will cast an eye at them too," he exclaimed,
and went to the stable and cut out the eyes of all the animals, and
putting them in a handker-

<span id="p.128">p.128</span>

chief, went to the church; and when any man or woman looked at him, he
threw an eye at them.\[1\]

Silly Matt has a brother in Russia, according to M. Leger's *Contcs
Populaires Slaves,* published at Paris in 1882: An old man and his wife
had a son, who was about as great a noodle as could be. One day his
mother said to him, "My son, thou shouldst go about among people, to get
thyself sharpened and rubbed down a little." "Yes, mother," says he;
"I'm off this moment." So he went to the village, and saw two men
threshing pease. He ran up to them, and rubbed himself now on one and
then on the other. "No nonsense!" cried the men. "Get away." But he
continued to rub himself on them, till at last they would stand it no
longer, and beat him with their flails so lustily that he could hardly
crawl home." What art thou crying about, child?" asked his mother. He
related his misfortune. "Ah, my child," said she, "how silly thou art!
Thou shouldst have said to them, 'God aid you, good men! Do you wish me
to help you to thresh?' and then they would have given thee some pease
for thy

\[1\] Professor Crane's *Italian Popular Tales,* p. 302. This actual
throwing of eyes occurs in the folk-tales of Europe generally.

<span id="p.129">p.129</span>

trouble, and we should have had them to cook and eat." On another
occasion the noodle again went through the village, and met some people
carrying a dead man. "May God aid you, good men!" he exclaimed. "Do you
wish me to help you to thresh?" But he got himself well thrashed once
more for this ill-timed speech. When he reached home, he howled,
"They've felled me to the ground, beaten me, and plucked my beard and
hair!" and told of his new mishap. "Ah, noodle!" said his mother, "thou
shouldst have said, 'God give peace to his soul!' Thou shouldst have
taken off thy bonnet, wept, and fallen upon thy knees. They would then
have given thee meat and drink." Again he went to the village, and met a
marriage procession. So he took off his bonnet, and cried with all his
might, "God grant peace to his soul!" and then burst into tears. "What
brute is this?" said the wedding company. "We laugh and amuse ourselves,
and he laments as if he were at a funeral." So they leaped out of the
carriages, and beat him soundly on the ribs. Home he returned, crying,
"They've beaten me, thrashed me, and torn my beard and hair!" and
related what had happened. "My son," said his mother, "thou shouldst
have leaped and danced with them." The next time he went to the village
he took his bag-

<span id="p.130">p.130</span>

pipe under his arm. At the end of the street a cart-shed was on fire.
The noodle ran to the spot, and began to play on his bagpipe and to
dance and caper about, for which he was abused as before. Going back to
his mother in tears, he told her how he had fared. "My son," said she,
"thou shouldst have carried water and thrown it on the fire, like the
other folks." Three days later, when his ribs were well again, the
noodle went through the village once more, and seeing a man roasting a
little pig, he seized a vessel of water, ran up with it, and threw the
water on the fire. This time also he was beaten, and when he got home,
and told his mother of his ill-luck, she resolved never again to allow
him to go abroad; so he remains by the fireside, as great a fool as
ever.

This species of noodle is also known in Japan. He is the hero of a farce
entitled *Hone Kaha,* or Ribs and Skin, which has been done into English
by Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain, in his *Classical Poetry of the
Japanese.* The rector of a Buddhist temple tells his curate that he
feels he is now getting too old for the duties of his office, and means
to resign the benefice in his favour. Before retiring to his private
chamber, he desires the curate to let him know if any persons visit

<span id="p.131">p.131</span>

the temple, and bids him, should he be in want of information regarding
any matter, to come to him. A parishioner calls to borrow an umbrella.
The curate lends him a new one, and then goes to the rector and informs
him of this visitor. "You have donewrong,"says the rector. "You ought to
have said that you should have been happy to comply with such a small
request, but, unfortunately, the rector was walking out with it the
other day, when, at a place where four roads meet, a sudden gust of wind
blew the skin to one side and the ribs to another; we have tied the ribs
and skin together in the middle, and hung it from the ceiling. Something
like that," adds the rector, "something with an air of truth about it,
is what you should have said." Next comes another parishioner, who
wishes to borrow a horse. The curate replies with great politeness, "The
request with which you honour me is a mere trifle, but the rector took
it out with him a few days since, and coming to the junction of four
cross roads, a gust of wind blew the ribs to one side and the skin to
another, and we have tied them together, and hung them from the ceiling;
so I fear it would not suit your purpose." "It is a horse I want," said
the man. "Precisely--a horse: I am aware of it," quoth the curate, and
the man went off, not a little perplexed, after which

<span id="p.132">p.132</span>

the curate reports this new affair to the rector, who says it was to an
umbrella, not to a horse, that such a story was applicable. Should any
one come again to borrow a horse, he ought to say, "I much regret that I
cannot comply with your request. The fact is, we lately turned him out
to grass, and becoming frolicsome, he dislocated his thigh, and is now
lying, covered with straw, in a corner of the stable." "Something like
that, "adds the rector, "something with an air of truth about it, is
what you should say." A third parishioner comes to invite the rector and
the curate to a feast at his house. "For myself," says the curate, "I
promise to come; but I fear it will not be convenient for the rector to
accompany me." "I presume then," says the man, "that he has some
particular business on hand?" "No, not any particular business," answers
the curate; "but the truth is, we lately turned him out to grass, and
becoming frisky, he dislocated his thigh, and now lies in a corner of
the stable, covered with straw." "I spoke of the rector," says the
parishioner. "Yes, of the rector. I quite understand," responds the
curate, very complaisantly, upon which the man goes away, not knowing
what to make of such a strange account of the rector's condition. This
last affair puts the rector into a fury, and he cuffs his intended
successor, exclaiming,

<span id="p.133">p.133</span>

"When was I ever frisky, I should like to know?"

As great a jolterhead as any of the foregoing was the hero of a story in
Cazette's "Continuation" of the *Arabian Nights,* entitled "L'Imbécille;
ou, L'Histoire de Xailoun."\[1\] This noodle's wife said to him one
day,' "Go and buy some pease, and don't forget that it is pease you are
to buy; continually repeat 'Pease!' till you reach the market-place." So
he went off, with "Pease! pease!" always in his mouth. He passed the
corner of a street where a merchant who had pearls for sale was
proclaiming his wares in a loud voice, saying, "In the name of the
Prophet, pearls!" Xailoun's attention was at once attracted by the
display of pearls, and at the same time he was occupied in retaining the
lesson his wife had taught him, and putting his hand in

\[1\] In *Le Cabinet des Fées,* 1788 (tome xxxviii., p. 337 ff).--There
can be no such name as Xailoun in Arabic; that of the noodle's wife,
Oitba, may be intended for "Utba," Cazotte has so Frenchified the names
of the characters in his tales as to render their identification with
the Arabic originals (where he had any such) often impossible. Although
this story is not found in any known Arabian text of the *Book of the
Thousand and One Nights,* yet the incidents for the most part occur in
several Eastern story-books.

<span id="p.134">p.134</span>

the box of pearls, he cried out, "Pease! pease! The merchant, supposing
Xailoun played upon him and depreciated his pearls by wishing to make
them pass for false ones, struck him a severe blow. "Why do you strike
me?" said Xailoun. "Because you insult me," answered the merchant. "Do
you suppose I am trying to deceive people?" "No," said the noodle. "But
what must I say, then?" "If you will cry properly, say as I do, 'Pearls,
in the name of the Prophet!'" He next passed by the shop of a merchant
from whom some pearls had been stolen, and his manner of crying,
"Pearls!" etc., which was not nearly so loud as usual, appeared to the
merchant very suspicious. "The man who has stolen my pearls," thought
he, "has probably recognised me, and when he passes my shop lowers his
voice in crying the goods." Upon this suspicion he ran after Xailoun,
and stopping him, said, "Show me your pearls." The poor fool was in
great confusion, and the merchant thought he had got the thief. The
supposed seller of pearls was soon surrounded by a great crowd, and the
merchant at last discovered that he was a perfect simpleton. "Why," said
he, "do you cry that you sell pearls?" "What should I say, then?" asked
Xailoun. "It is not true," said the merchant, not listening to him. "It
is not true,"

<span id="p.135">p.135</span>

exclaimed the noodle. "Let me repeat, 'It is not true,' that I may not
forget it;" and as he went on he kept crying, "It is not true." His way
led him towards a place where a man was proclaiming, "In the name of the
Prophet, lentils!" Xailoun, induced by curiosity, went up to the man,
his mouth full of the last words he remembered, and putting his hand
into the sack, cried, "It is not true." The sturdy villager gave him a
blow that caused him to stagger, saying, "What d'ye mean by giving me
the lie about my goods, which I both sowed and reaped myself?" Quoth the
noodle, "I have only tried to say what I ought to say." "Well, then,"
rejoined the dealer, "you ought to say, as I do, 'Lentils, in the name
of the Prophet!'" So our noodle at once took up this new cry, and
proceeded on his way till he came to the bank of the river, where a
fisherman had been casting his net for hours, and had frequently changed
his place, without getting any fish. Xailoun, who was amused with every
new thing he saw, began to follow the fisherman, and, that he should not
forget his lesson, continued to repeat, "Lentils, in the name of the
Prophet!" Suddenly the fisherman made a pretence of spreading his net,
in order to wring and dry it, and having folded in his hand the rope to
which it was fastened, he took hold

<span id="p.136">p.136</span>

of the simpleton and struck him some furious blows with it, saying,
"Vile sorcerer! cease to curse my fishing." Xailoun struggled, and at
length disengaged himself. "I am no sorcerer," said he. "Well, if you
are not," answered the fisherman, "why do you cause me bad luck by your
words every time I throw my net?" "I didn't mean to bring you bad luck,"
said the noodle. "I only repeat what I was told to repeat." The
fisherman then concluded that some of his enemies, who wished to do him
an ill turn without exposing themselves, had prevailed upon this poor
fellow to come and curse his fishing, so he said, "I am sorry, brother,
for having beaten you, but you were wrong to pronounce the words you
did, thereby bringing bad luck to me, who never did you any harm." Quoth
the simpleton, "I only tried to say the words my wife told me not to
forget." "Do you know them?" "Yes." "Well, place yourself beside me, and
each time I cast my net you must say, 'In the name of the Prophet,
instead of one, seven of the greatest and best!' 'But Xailoun thought
what his wife had said was not so long as that. "Oh, yes, it was," said
the fisherman; "and take care you don't miss a single word, and I shall
give you some of the fish to take home with you." That he might not
forget, Xailoun repeated it

<span id="p.137">p.137</span>

very loud, but as he was afraid of the cord whenever he saw the
fisherman drawing in his net, he ran away as fast as he could, but still
repeating, "In the name of the Prophet, instead of one, seven of the
greatest and best!" These words he pronounced in the midst of a crowd of
people, through which the corpse of the kází (magistrate, or judge) was
being carried to the burying ground, and the mullahs who surrounded the
bier, scandalised by what they thought a horrible imprecation,
exclaimed, "How darest thou, wicked wretch, thus blaspheme? Is it not
enough that Death has taken one of the greatest men of Baghdád?" The
poor simpleton was skulking off in fear and trembling, when his sleeve
was pulled by an aged slave, who told him that he ought to say, "May
Allah preserve his body and save his soul!" So our noodle went on,
repeating this new cry till he came to a street where a dead ass was
being carted away. "May Allah preserve his body and save his soul!" he
exclaimed. "How he blasphemes!" said the folk, and they set upon him
with their fists and sticks, and gave him a sound drubbing. At length he
got clear of them, and by chance came to the house of his wife's mother,
but he only ventured to stand at the door and peep within. He was
recognised, however, and asked what he

<span id="p.138">p.138</span>

would have to eat--goat's flesh? rice?*pease?* Yes, it was pease he
wanted, and having got some, he hastened home, and after relating all
his mishaps, informed his wife, that her sister was very sick. His wife,
having prepared herself to go to her mother's house, tells the simpleton
to rock the baby should it awake and cry; feed the hen that was sitting;
if the ass was thirsty, give her to drink; shut the door, and take care
not to go to sleep, lest robbers should come and plunder the house. The
baby awakes, and Xailoun rocks it to sleep again; so far, well. The hen
seems uneasy; he concludes she is troubled with insects, like himself.
So he takes up the hen, and thinking the best way to kill the insects
was to stick a pin into them, he unluckily kills the hen. This was a
serious matter, and while he considers what he should do in the
circumstances, the ass begins to bray. "Ah," says he, "I've no time to
attend to you just now; but when I am on your back, you can carry me to
the river.'' Then he opened the door and let out the ass and her colt.
After this he sat down on the eggs, and took the baby in his arms. His
wife returning, knocks at the door. "Let me in, you fool," she cries. "I
can't, for I am nursing the baby and hatching the eggs." At length she
contrived to force open the door, and running up to her

<span id="p.139">p.139</span>

idiot of a husband, fetched him a blow that caused him to crush all the
half-hatched eggs. Luckily she had met the ass and her foal on the road,
so the amount of mischief done by her stupid spouse in her absence was
not so great, all things considered.\[1\]

The misadventures of the Arabian idiot in his expedition to purchase
pease present a close analogy to those of the typical English booby,
only the latter end tragically:

A woman sent her son one day to buy a sheep's head and pluck, and, lest
he should forget his message, he kept bawling loudly as he went along,
"Sheep's head and pluck! sheep's head and pluck!" In getting over a
stile he fell and hurt himself, and forgot what he was sent for, so he
stood a little to consider; and at last he thought he recollected

\[1\] On a similar occasion Giufà, the Sicilian brother to the Arabian
fool, did somewhat more mischief. Once his mother went to church and
told him to make some porridge for his baby-sister. Giufà made a great
pot of porridge and fed the baby with it, and burned her mouth so that
she died. Another time his mother on leaving home told him to feed the
hen that was sitting and put her back in the nest, so that the eggs
should not get cold. Giufà stuffed the hen with food so that he killed
her, and then sat on the eggs himself until his mother returned.--See
Crane's *Italian Popular Tales,* pp. 296-7.

<span id="p.140">p.140</span>

it, and began to shout, "Liver and lights and gall and all!" which he
was repeating when he came up to a man who was very sick. The man,
thinking the booby was mocking; him, laid hold of him, and after cuffing
him, bade the booby cry, "Pray God, send no more up!" So he ran along
uttering these words till he came to a field where a man was sowing
wheat, who, on hearing what he took for a curse upon his labour, seized
and thrashed him, and told him to repeat, "Pray God, send plenty more!"
So the young jolterhead at once "changed his tune," and was loudly
singing out these words when he met a funeral. The chief mourner
punished him for what he thought his fiendish wish, and bade him say,
"Pray God, send the soul to heaven!" which he was bawling when he met a
he and a she-dog going to be hanged. The good people who heard him were
greatly shocked at his seeming profanity, and striking him, strictly
charged him to cry, "A he and a she-dog going to be hanged!" On he went,
accordingly, repeating this new cry, till he met a man and a woman going
to be married. When the bridegroom heard what the booby said, he gave
him many a good thump, and bade him say, "I wish you much joy!" This he
was crying at the top of his voice when he came to a pit into which two

<span id="p.141">p.141</span>

labourers had fallen, and one of them, enraged at what he thought his
mockery of their misfortune, exerted all his strength and scrambled out,
then beat the poor simpleton, and told him to say, "The one is out; I
wish the other was!" Glad to be set free, the booby went on shouting
these words till he met with a one-eyed man, who, like the others,
taking what he was crying for a personal insult, gave him another
drubbing, and then bade him cry, "The one side gives good light, and I
wish the other did!" So he adopted this new cry, and continued his
adventurous journey till he came to a house, one side of which was on
fire. The people, hearing him bawling, "The one side gives good light,
and I wish the other did!" at once concluded that he had set the house
a-blazing; so they put him in prison, and the end was, the judge put on
the black cap and condemned him to be hanged!\[1\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the noodle is persuaded, as in the following case of a Sinhalese
wittol, by a gang of thieves to join them in a plundering expedition,
they have little reason to be pleased with him, for he does not make a

vol. iii., pp. 153-5.

<span id="p.142">p.142</span>

good "cat's-paw." The Sinhalese noodle joined some thieves, took readily
to their ways, and was always eager to accompany them on their marauding
excursions. One night they took him with them, and boring a large hole
in the wall of a house,\[1\] they sent him in, telling him to hand out
the heaviest article he could lay hands upon. He readily went in, and
seeing a large kurakkan-grinder,\[2\] thought that was the heaviest
thing in the room, and attempted to remove it. But it proved too much
for him alone, so he gently awoke a man who was sleeping in the room,
and said to him, "My friend, pray help me to remove this
kurakkan-grinder. The man immediately guessed that thieves had entered
the house, and gave the alarm. The thieves, who were waiting outside
quite expectant, rushed away, and the noodle somehow or other managed to
escape with them.

Next night they again took him along with them, and after boring a hole
in the wall of another house, sent him in with strict injunctions not to
make a noise or wake anybody. He crept in noiselessly and entered a
large

room, in which was an old woman, fast asleep by the fire, with wide-open
mouth. An earthen chattie, a wooden spoon, and a small bag of pease were
also placed by the fire The noodle first proceeded to roast some pease
in the chattie. When they were roasted to a nice brownish colour, and
emitted a very tempting smell, he thought that the old woman might also
enjoy a mouthful. He considered for a while how he might best offer some
to her. He did not wish to wake her, as he was ordered not to wake
anybody. Suddenly a bright idea struck him. Why should he not feed her?
There she was sleeping with her mouth wide open. Surely it would be no
difficult task to put some pease into her mouth. Taking some of the hot,
smoking pease into the wooden spoon, he put the contents into her mouth.
The woman awoke, screaming with all her might. The noise roused the
other inmates of the house, who came rushing to the spot to see what was
the matter. This time also the noodle managed to escape with the
thieves; but in a subsequent adventure he, as well as the thieves, came
to grief.\[1\]

The silly son of Italian popular tales is

<span id="p.144">p.144</span>

represented as being sent by his mother to sell a piece of linen which
she had woven, saying to him, "Now listen attentively to what I say:
Walk straight along the road. Don't take less than such a price for this
linen. Don't have any dealings with women who chatter. Whether you sell
it to any one you meet on the way, or carry it into the market, offer it
only to some quiet sort of body whom you may see standing apart and not
gossiping or prating, for such as they will persuade you to take some
sort of price that won't suit me at all." The booby answers, "Yes,
mamma," and goes off on his errand, keeping straight on, instead of
taking the turnings leading to villages. It happened, as he went along,
that the wife of the syndic of the next town was driving out with her
maids, and had got out of the carriage, to walk a short distance, as the
day was fine. Her maid tells her that there goes the simple son of the
poor widow by the brook. "What are you going to do, my good lad?" kindly
asks the lady. "I'm not going to tell you," says the booby, "because you
were chattering." "I see your mother has sent you to sell this linen,"
continues the lady; "I will buy it of you," and she offers to pay twice
as much as his mother had said she wanted. "Can't sell it to you,"
replies he, "for you

<span id="p.145">p.145</span>

were chattering," and he continues his journey. Farther along he comes
to a plaster statue by the roadside, so he says to himself, "Here's one
who stands apart and doesn't chatter; this is the one to sell the linen
to," then aloud, "Will you buy my linen, good friend?" The statue
maintained its usual taciturnity, and the booby concluded, as it did not
speak, it was all right, so he said, "The price is so-and-so; have the
money ready by the time I come back, as I have to go on and buy some
yarn for mother." On he went accordingly, and bought the yarn, and then
came back to the statue. Some one passing by had in the meantime taken
the linen. Finding it gone, "It's all right," says he to himself; "she's
taken it," then aloud, "Where's the money I told you to have ready?" The
statue remained silent. "If you don't give me the money, I'll hit you on
the head," he exclaimed, and raising his stick, he knocked the head off,
and found it filled with gold coin. "That's where you keep your money,
is it? All right; I can pay myself." So saying, he filled his pockets
with the coin and went home. When he handed his mother the money, and
told her of his adventure with the quiet body by the roadside, she was
afraid lest the neighbours should learn of her windfall if the booby
knew its value,

<span id="p.146">p.146</span>

so she said to him, "You've only brought me a lot of rusty nails; but
never mind: you'll know better what to do next time," and put the money
in an earthen jar. In her absence, a ragman comes to the house, and the
booby asks him, "Will you buy some rusty nails?" The man desires to see
them. "Well," quoth he on beholding the treasure, "they're not much
worth, but I'll give you twelve pauls for the lot," and having handed
over the sum, went off with his prize. When his mother comes home, the
booby tells her what a bargain he had made for the rusty nails. "Nails!"
she echoes, in consternation. "Why, you foolish thing, they were gold
coins!" "Can't help that now, mamma," he answers philosophically; "you
told me they were old rusty nails." By another lucky adventure, however,
the booby is enabled to make up his mother's loss, finding a treasure
which a party of robbers had left behind them at the foot of a tree.

The incident of a simpleton selling something to an inanimate object and
discovering a hidden treasure occurs, in different forms, in the
folk-tales of Asiatic as well as European countries. In a manuscript
text of the *Arabian Nights,* brought from Constantinople by Wortley
Montague, and now

<span id="p.147">p.147</span>

preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, a more elaborate version of
the Italian booby's adventure with the statue is found, in the "Story of
the Bang-eater and his Wife:"

In former times there lived not far from Baghdád a half-witted fellow,
who was much addicted to the use of bang. Being reduced to poverty, he
was obliged to sell his cow, which he took to the market one day, but
the animal being in such a poor condition, no one would buy it, and
after waiting till he was weary he returned homeward. On the way he
stopped to repose himself under a tree, and tied the cow to one of the
branches, while he ate some bread, and drank an infusion of his bang,
which he always carried with him. In a short time it began to operate,
so as to bereave him of the little sense he had, and his head was filled
with ridiculous reveries. While he was musing, a bird beginning to
chatter from her nest in the tree, he fancied it was a human voice, and
that some woman had offered to purchase his cow, upon which he said,
"Reverend mother of Solomon,\[1\] dost thou wish to buy my

\[1\] Ummu Sulayman. In Arabia the mother is generally addressed in this
way as a mark of respect for having borne children, and the eldest gives
the title. Our bang-eater supposed he was addressing an old woman who
had (or might have had) a son named Solomon.

<span id="p.148">p.148</span>

cow?" The bird again chattered. "Well," replied he, "what wilt thou
give? I will sell her a bargain." The bird repeated her noise. "Never
mind," said the fool, "for though thou hast forgotten to bring thy
purse, yet, as I daresay thou art an honest woman, and hast bidden me
ten dinars, I will trust thee with the cow, and call on Friday for the
money." The bird renewed her chattering; so, leaving the cow tied to a
branch of the tree, he returned home, exulting in the good bargain he
had made for the animal. When he entered the house, his wife inquired
what he had got for the cow, and he replied that he had sold her to an
honest woman, who had promised to pay him ten pieces of gold next
Friday. The wife was contented; and when Friday arrived, her noodle of a
husband having, as usual, taken a dose of bang, repaired to the tree,
and hearing the bird chattering as before, said, "Well, good mother,
hast thou brought the gold?" The bird croaked. The blockhead, supposing
the imaginary woman refused to pay him, became angry, and threw up a
stone, which frightening the bird, it flew from its nest in the tree and
alighted on a heap of ruins at some little distance. He now concluded
that the woman had desired him to take his money from the heap, into
which he accordingly dug, and found a copper

<span id="p.149">p.149</span>

vessel full of coin. This discovery convinced him he was right, and
being withal an honest fellow, he only took ten pieces; then replacing
the soil, "May Allah requite thee for thy punctuality, good mother!" he
exclaimed, and returned to his wife, to whom he gave the money,
informing her at the same time of the great treasure his friend the
imaginary old woman possessed, and where it was concealed.

The wife waited till night, when she brought away the pot of gold, which
her foolish husband observing, he said, "It is dishonest to rob one who
has paid us so punctually; and if thou dost not return it to its place,
I will inform the walí" (governor of the city). She laughed at his
simplicity, but fearing that he would execute his threat, she planned a
stratagem to render it of no avail. Going to market, she purchased some
meat and fish ready cooked, which she brought privately home, and
concealed in the house. At night, while her husband was sleeping off the
effects of his favourite narcotic, she strewed the provisions she had
brought outside the door, and then awakening him, cried out, "Dear
husband, a most wonderful thing has occurred: there has been a violent
storm while you slept, and, strange to tell, it has rained pieces of
broiled meat and fish, which

<span id="p.150">p.150</span>

now lie at the door!" The blockhead got up, and seeing the food, was
persuaded of the truth of his wife's story. The flesh and fish were
gathered up, and he partook with much glee of the miraculous treat, but
still said he would tell the walí of her having stolen the treasure of
the honest old woman.

In the morning he actually repaired to the walí, and informed him that
his wife had stolen a pot of gold, which she had still in her
possession. Upon this the walí had the woman apprehended. She denied the
accusation, and was then threatened with death. "My lord," said she,
"the power is in your hands; but I am an injured woman, as you will find
by questioning my husband, who is deranged in his intellect. Ask him
when I committed the theft." The walí did so, and the simpleton
answered, "It was the evening of that night when it rained broiled fish
and ready-cooked flesh." On hearing this, "Wretch!" exclaimed the walí
in a fury, "dost thou dare to utter falsehoods before me? Who ever saw
it rain anything but water?" "As I hope for life," replied the fool, "I
speak the truth; for my wife and myself ate of the fish and flesh which
fell from the clouds." The woman, being appealed to, denied the
assertion of her husband. The walí, now convinced that the man

<span id="p.151">p.151</span>

was crazy, released the woman, and sent her husband to the madhouse,
where he remained for some days, till his wife, pitying his condition,
contrived to get him set at liberty. She visited her husband, and
counselled him, should any one ask him if he had seen it rain fish and
flesh, to answer, "No; who ever saw it rain anything but water?" Then
she informed the keeper that he was come to his senses, and suggested he
should question him; and on the poor fellow answering properly he was
released.

In a Russian variant, an old man had three sons, one of whom was a
noodle. When the old man died, his property was shared between the
brothers, but all that the simpleton received was one ox, which he took
to the market to sell. On his way he chanced to pass an old birch-tree,
which creaked and groaned in the wind. He thinks the tree is offering to
buy his ox, and so he says, "Well, you shall have it for twenty
roubles." But the tree only creaked and creaked, and he fancied it was
asking the ox on credit. "Very good," says he. "You'll pay me tomorrow?
I'll wait till then." So he ties the ox to the tree and goes home. His
brothers question him about his ox, and he tells them he has sold it for
twenty roubles and is to get

<span id="p.152">p.152</span>

the money to-morrow, at which they laugh; he is, they think; a greater
fool than ever. Next morning he went to the birch-tree, and found the ox
was gone, for, in truth, the wolves had eaten it. He demanded his money,
but the tree only creaked and groaned, as usual. "You'll pay me
to-morrow?" he exclaimed. "That's what you said yesterday. I'll have no
more of your promises." So saying, he struck the old birch-tree with his
hatchet and sent the chips flying about. Now the tree was hollow, and it
soon split asunder from his blows; and in the hollow trunk he found a
pot full of gold, which some robbers had hidden there. Taking some of
the gold, He returns home, and shows it to his brothers, who ask him how
he got so much money. "A neighbour," he replies, "gave it to me for my
ox. But this is nothing like the whole of it. Come along, brothers, and
let us get the rest." They go, and fetch the rest of the treasure, and
on their way home they meet a diachok (one of the inferior members of
the Russian clerical body, though not one of the clergy), who asks them
what they are carrying. "Mushrooms," say the two clever brothers; but
the noodle cries, "That's not true; we're carrying money: here, look at
it." The diachok, with an exclamation, flung himself upon the gold and
began stuffing it into

<span id="p.153">p.153</span>

his pockets. At this the noodle grew angry, dealt him a blow with his
hatchet, and killed him on the spot. The brothers dragged the body to an
empty cellar, and flung it in. Later in the evening the eldest said to
the other, "This business is sure to turn out badly. When they look for
the diachok, Simpleton will be sure to tell them all about it. So we had
better hide the body in some other place, and kill a goat and bury it in
the cellar." This they did accordingly. And after several days had
passed the people asked the noodle if he had seen the diachok. "Yes," he
answered. "I killed him some time ago with my hatchet, and my brothers
carried him to the cellar." They seize upon him and compel him to go
down into the cellar and bring out the body. He gets hold of the goat's
head, and asks, "Was your diachok dark-haired?" "He was." "Had he a
beard?" "Yes." "And horns?" "What horns are you talking of?" "Well, see
for yourselves," said he, tossing up the head to them. They saw it was a
goat's head, and went away home.\[1\]

The reader cannot fail to remark the close resemblance there is between
the first parts

\[1\] See Ralston's *Russian Folk-Tales.*

<span id="p.154">p.154</span>

of the Arabian and Russian storie; and the second parts of both reappear
in many tales of the Silly Son. The goat's carcase substituted for the
dead man occurs, for instance, in the Norse story of Silly Matt; in the
Sicilian story of Giufà; in M. Rivière's *Contes Populates de la Kabylie
du Djurdjura;* and "Foolish Sachúli," in Miss Stokes' *Indian Fairy
Tales.* The incident of the pretended shower of broiled fish and flesh
is found in Campbell's *Tales of the West Highlands* (porridge and
pancakes); in Rivière's Tales of the Kabaïl (fritters); "Foolish
Sachúli" (sweetmeats); Giufà, the Sicilian Booby (figs and raisins); and
in M. Leger's *Contes Populaires Slaves,* where, curiously enough, the
trick is played by a husband upon his wife. It is perhaps worth while
reproducing the Russian story from Leger, in a somewhat abridged form,
as follows:

In tilling the ground a labourer found a treasure, and carrying it home,
said to his wife, "See! Heaven has sent us a fortune. But where can we
conceal it?" She suggested he should bury it under the floor, which he
did accordingly. Soon after this the wife went out to fetch water, and
the labourer reflected that his wife was a dreadful gossip, and by
to-morrow night all the village would know their secret. So he removed
the

<span id="p.155">p.155</span>

treasure from its hiding-place and buried it in his barn, beneath a heap
of corn. When the wife came back from the well, he said to her quite
gravely, "To-morrow we shall go to the forest to seek fish; they say
there's plenty there at present." "What! fish in the forest?" she
exclaimed. "Of course," he rejoined; "and you'll see them there." Very
early next morning he got up, and took some fish, which he had concealed
in a basket. He went to the grocer's and bought a quantity of sweet
cakes. He also caught a hare and killed it. The fish and cakes he
disposed of in different parts of the wood, and the hare he hooked on a
fishing-line, and then threw it in the river. After breakfast he took
his wife with him into the wood, which they had scarcely entered when
she found a pike, then a perch, and then a roach, on the ground. With
many exclamations of surprise, she gathered up the fish and put them in
her basket. Presently they came to a pear-tree, from the branches of
which hung sweet cakes. "See!" she cried. "Cakes on a pear-tree!" "Quite
natural," replied he: "it has rained cakes, and some have remained on
this tree; travellers have picked up the rest." Continuing their way to
the village, they passed near a stream. "Wait a little," said the
husband; "I set my line early this morning, and I'll

<span id="p.156">p.156</span>

look if anything is caught on it." He then pulled in the line, and
behold, there was a hare hooked on to it! "How extraordinary!" cries the
good wife--"a hare in the water!'' "Why," says he, "don't you know there
are hares in the water as well as rats?" "No, indeed, I knew it not."
They now returned home, and the wife set about preparing all the nice
eatables for supper. In a day or two the labourer found from the talk of
his acquaintances that his finding the treasure was no secret in the
village, and in less than a week he was summoned to the castle. "Is it
true," said the lord, "that you have found a treasure?" "It is not
true," was his reply. "But your wife has told me all." "My wife does not
know what she says--she is mad, my lord." Hereupon the woman cries, "It
is the truth, my lord; he has found a treasure and buried it beneath the
floor of our cottage." "When?" "On the eve before the day we went into
the forest to look for fish." "What do you say?" "Yes; it was on the day
that it rained cakes; we gathered a basketful of them, and coming home,
my husband fished a fine hare out of the river." My lord declared the
woman to be an idiot; nevertheless he caused his servants to search
under the labourer's cottage floor, but nothing was found there, and so
the shrewd fellow secured his treasure.

<span id="p.157">p.157</span>

The silly son figures frequently in Indian story-books; sometimes a
number of fools' exploits are strung together and ascribed to one
individual, as in the tale of "Foolish Sachúli;" but generally they are
told as separate stories. The following adventure of Sachúli is also
found, in varied form, in Beschi's *Gooroo Paramartan:* One day Sachúli
climbed up a tree, and sat on a long branch, and began cutting off the
branch between the tree and himself. A man passing by called to him,
saying, "What are you doing up there? You will be killed if you cut that
branch off." "What do you say?" asked the booby, coming down. "When
shall I die?" "How can I tell?" said the man. "Let me go." "I will not
let you go until you tell me when I shall die." At last the man, in
order to get rid of him, said, "When you find a scarlet thread on your
jacket, then you will die." After this Sachúli went to the bazaar, and
sat down by some tailors, and in throwing away shreds, a scarlet thread
fell on his clothes. "Now I shall die!" exclaimed the fool. "How do you
know that?" the tailors inquired, when he told them what the man had
said about a scarlet thread, at which they all laughed. Nevertheless,
Sachúli went and dug a grave in the jungle and lay down in it.

<span id="p.158">p.158</span>

Presently a sepoy comes along, bearing a pot of *ghi,* or clarified
butter, which he engages Sachúli to carry for him, and the noodle, of
course, lets it fall in the midst of his calculations of the uses to
which he should put the money he is promised by the sepoy.

The incident of a blockhead cutting off the branch on which he is seated
seems to be almost universal. It occurs in the jests of the typical
Turkish noodle, the Khoja Nasr-ed-Dín, and there exist German, Saxon,
and Lithuanian variants of the same story. It is also known in Ceylon,
and the following is a version from a Hindú work entitled *Bhara-taka
Dwátrinsati,* Thirty-two Tales of Mendicant Monks:

In Elákapura there lived several mendicant monks. One of them, named
Dandaka, once went, in the rainy season, into a wood in order to procure
a post for his hut. There he saw on a tree a fine branch bent down, and
he climbed the tree, sat on the branch, and began to cut it. Then there
came that way some travellers, who, seeing what he was doing, said, "O
monk, greatest of all idiots, you should not cut a branch on which you
yourself are sitting, for if you do so, when the branch breaks you will
fall down and die." After saying this the travellers went their way. The
monk, however, paid no

<span id="p.159">p.159</span>

attention to their speech, but continued to cut the branch, remaining in
the same posture, until at length the branch broke, and he tumbled down.
He then thought within himself, "Those travellers are indeed wise and
truthful, for everything has happened just as they predicted;
consequently I must be dead." So he remained on the ground as if dead;
he did not speak, nor did he stand up, nor did he even breathe. People
who came there from the neighbourhood raised him up, but he did not
stand; they endeavoured to make him speak, but could not succeed. They
then sent word to the other monks, saying, "Your associate Dandaka fell
down from a tree and died." Then came the monks in large numbers, and
when they saw that he was "dead," they lifted him up in order to carry
him to the place of cremation. Now when they had gone a short distance
they came upon a spot where the road divided itself before them. Then
said some, "We must go to the left," but others said, "It is to the
right that we must go." Thus a dispute arose among them, and they were
unable to come to any conclusion. The "dead" monk, who was borne on a
bier, said, "Friends, quarrel not among yourselves; when I was alive, I
always went by the left road." Then said some, "He always spoke the
truth; all

<span id="p.160">p.160</span>

that he ever said was nothing but the simple fact. Let us therefore take
the left road." This was agreed upon, and as they were about to proceed
towards the left some people who happened to be present said, "O ye
monks, ye are the greatest of all blockheads that ye should proceed to
burn this man while he is yet alive." They answered, "Nay, but he is
dead." Then the bystanders said, "He cannot be dead, seeing that he yet
speaks." They then set down the bier on the ground, and Dandaka
persistently declared that he was actually dead, and related to them
with the most solemn protestations the prediction of the travellers, and
how it was fulfilled. Hereupon the other monks remained quite
bewildered, unable to arrive at any decision as to whether Dandaka was
dead or alive, until at length, after a great deal of trouble, the
bystanders succeeded in convincing them that the man was not dead and in
inducing them to return to their dwelling. Dandaka also now stood up and
went his way, after having been heartily laughed at by the people.\[1\]

A diverting story in the *Facetiœ* of Poggius, entitled "Mortuus
Loqueus," from which it was reproduced in the Italian novels of

\[1\] From a paper on "Comparative Folk-lore," by W. Goonetilleke, in
*The Oritntalist,* i., p. 122.

<span id="p.161">p.161</span>

Grazzini and in our old collection *Tales and Quicke Answeres,* has a
near affinity with jests of this class, and also with the wide cycle of
stories in which a number of rogues combine to cheat a simpleton out of
his property. In the early English jest-book,\[1\] it is, in effect, as
follows:

There once dwelt in Florence a noodle called Nigniaca, upon whom a party
of young men resolved to play a practical joke. Having arranged their
plans, one of them met him early one morning, and asked him if he was
not ill. "No," says the wittol. "I am well enough." "By my faith," quoth
the joker, "but you have a pale, sickly colour," and went his way.
Presently a second of the complotters came up to him, and asked him if
he was not suffering from an ague, for he certainly looked very ill. The
poor fellow now began to think that he was really sick, and was
convinced of this when a third man in passing told him that he should be
in his bed--he had evidently not an hour to live. Hearing this, Nigniaca
stood stock-still, saying to himself, "Verily, I have some sharp ague,"
when a fourth man came and bade him go home at once, for he was a dying
man.

\[1\] *Mery Tales, Wittie Questions, and Quicke Answeres, very pleasant
to be Readde.* Imprinted at London by H. Wykes, 1567.

<span id="p.162">p.162</span>

So the simpleton begged this fourth man to help him home, which he did
very willingly, and after laying him in his bed, the other jokers came
to see him, and one of them, pretending to be a physician, felt his
pulse and declared the patient would die within an hour.\[1\] Then,
standing all about his bed, they said to each other, "Now he is sinking
fast; his speech and sight have failed him; he will soon give up the
ghost. Let us therefore close his eyes, cross his hands on his breast,
and carry him forth to be buried." The simpleton lay as still as though
he was really dead, so they laid him on a bier and carried him through
the city. A great crowd soon gathered, when it was known that they were
carrying the corpse of Nigniaca to his grave. And among the crowd was a
taverner's boy, who cried out, "What a rascal and thief

\[1\] Thus, too, Scogin and his "chamber-fellow" successively declared
to a rustic that the sheep he was driving were pigs. In Fortini's
novels, in like manner, a simpleton is persuaded that the kid he offered
for sale was a capon; and in the Spanish *El Conde Lucanor,* and the
German *Tyl Eulenspiegel,* a countryman is cheated out of a piece of
cloth. The original form of the incident is found in the *Hitopadesa,*
where three sharpers persuade a Bráhman that the goat he is carrying for
a sacrifice is a dog. This story of the Florentine noodle--or rather
Poggio's version--may have been suggested by a tale in the

<span id="p.163">p.163</span>

is dead! By the mass, he should have been hanged long ago." When the
wittol heard himself thus vilified, he lifted up his head and exclaimed,
"I wish, you scoundrel, I were alive now, as I am dead, and I would
prove thee a false liar to thy face;" upon which the jokers burst into
laughter, set down the "body" and ran away--leaving Nigniaca to explain
the whole affair to the marvelling multitude.\[1\]

We read of another silly son, in the *Kathá Manjari,* whose father said
to him one day, "My boy, you are now grown big, yet you

*Gesta Romanorum,* in which the emperor's physician is made to believe
that he had leprosy. See my *Popular Tales and Fictions,* where these
and similar stories are compared in a paper entitled "The Sharpers and
the Simpleton."

\[1\] In Powell and Magnusson's *Legends of Iceland* (Second Series, p.
627), a woman makes her husband believe that he is dressed in fine
clothes when he is naked; another persuades her husband that he is dead,
and as he is being carried to the burying-ground, he perceives the naked
man, who asserts that he is dressed, upon which he exclaims, "How I
should laugh if I were not dead!" And in a *fabliau* by Jean de Boves,
"Le Villain de Bailleul; *aliàs,* Le Femme qui fit croire à son Mari
qu'il était mort," the husband exclaims, "Rascal of a priest, you may
well thank Heaven that I am dead, else I would belabour you soundly with
my stick."--See M. Le Grand's *Fabliaux,* ed. 1781, tome v., pp. 192,
193.

<span id="p.164">p.164</span>

don't seem to have much sense. You must, however, do something for your
living. Go, therefore, to the tank, and catch fish and bring them home."
The lad accordingly went to the tank, and having caused all the
water--which was required for the irrigation of his father's fields--to
run to waste, he picked up from the mud all the fishes he could find,
and took them to his father, not a little proud of his exploit.--In the
*Kathá Sarit Ságara* it is related that a Brahman told his foolish son
one evening that he must send him to the village early on the morrow,
and thither the lad went, without asking what he was to do. Returning
home at night very tired, he said to his father, "I have been to the
village." "Yes," said the Brahman, "you went thither without an object,
and have done no good by it."--And in the Buddhist *Játakas* we find
what is probably the original of a world-wide story: A man was chopping
a felled tree, when a mosquito settled on his bald head and stung him
severely. Calling to his son, who was sitting near him, he said, "My
boy, there is a mosquito stinging my head, like the thrust of a
spear--drive it off." "Wait a bit, father." said the boy, "and I will
kill him with one blow." Then he took up an axe and stood behind his
father's back; and thinking to kill the mosquito with the axe, he only
killed his father.

<span id="p.165">p.165</span>

Among numerous variants is the story of the Sicilian booby, Giufà, who
was annoyed by the flies, and complained of them to the judge, who told
him that he was at liberty to kill a fly wherever he saw it: just then a
fly happened to alight on the judge's nose, which Giufà observing, he
immediately aimed at it so furious a blow with his fist, that he smashed
his worship's nose!

The hopelessness of attempting to impart instruction to the silly son is
farther illustrated by the story in a Sinhalese collection: A gúrú was
engaged in teaching one of his disciples, but whilst he was teaching the
youth was watching the movements of a rat which was entering its hole.
As soon as the gúrú had finished his teaching, he said, "Well, my son,
has all entered in?" to which the youth replied, "Yes, all has entered
in except the tail." And from the same work is the following choice
example of "a happy family": A priest went one day to the house of one
of his followers, and amongst other things he said, "Tell me now, which
of your four children is the best-behaved?" The father replied, "Look,
sir, at that boy who has climbed to the top of that thatched building,
and is waving aloft a firebrand. Among them all, he is the divinely
excellent one." Whereupon the priest placed his finger on his nose,

drew a deep, deep sigh, and said, "Is it indeed so? What, then, must the
other three be?"

The Turkish romance of the Forty Vazirs--the plan of which is similar to
that of the Book of Sindibád and its derivatives--furnishes us with two
stories of the same class, one of which is as follows, according to my
friend Mr. Gibb's complete translation (the first that has been made in
English), recently published:\[1\]

They have told that in bygone times there was a king, and he had a
skilful minstrel. One day a certain person gave to the latter a little
boy, that he might teach him the science of music. The boy abode a long
time by him, and though the master instructed him, he succeeded not in
learning, and the master could make nothing of him. He arranged a scale,
and said, "Whatsoever thou sayest to me, say in this scale." So
whatsoever the boy said he used to say in that scale. Now one day a
spark of fire fell on the master's turban. The boy saw it and chanted,
"O master, I see something; shall I say it or no?" and he went over the
whole scale. Then the master

Eves.* Translated from the Turkish, by E.J.W. Gibb, M.R.A.S. London: G.
Redway, 1886.

<span id="p.167">p.167</span>

chanted, "O boy, what dost thou see? Speak!" and he too went over all
that the boy had gone over. Then the turn came to the boy, and he
chanted, "O master, a spark has fallen on thy turban, and it is
burning." The master straightway tore off his turban and cast it on the
ground, and saw that it was burning. He blew out the fire on this side
and on that, and took it in his hand, and said to the boy, "What time
for chanting is this? Everything is good in its own place," and he
admonished him.\[1\]

The other story tells how a king had a stupid son, and placed him in
charge of a cunning master, learned in the sciences, who declared it
would be easy for him to teach the boy discretion, and, before
dismissing him, the king gave the sage many rich gifts. After the boy
has been long under the tuition of his learned master, the latter,
conceiving

\[1\] A variant of this is found in John Bromyard's *Summa
Prœdicantium,* A 26, 34, as follows:

Quidam sedebat juxta igneum, cujus vestem ignis intrabat. Dixit socius
suus, "Vis audire rumores?" "Ita," inquit, "bonos et non alios." Cui
alius,."Nescio nisi malos." "Ergo," inquit, "nolo audire." Et quum bis
aut ter ei hoc diceret, semper idem respondit. In fine, quum sentiret
vestem combustam, iratus ait socio, "Quare non dixisti mihi?" "Quia
(inquit) dixista quod noluisti audire rumores nisi placentes et illi non
erant tales."

<span id="p.168">p.168</span>

him to be well versed in all the sciences, takes him to the king, his
father, who says to him, "O my son, were I to hold a certain thing
hidden in my hand, couldst thou tell me what it is?" "Yes," answers the
youth. Upon this the king secretly slips the ring off his finger, and
hides it in his hand, and then asks the boy, "What have I in my hand?"
Quoth the clever youth, "O father, it first came from the hills." (The
king thinks to himself, "He knows that mines are in the hills.") "And it
is a round thing," continues he--"it must be a millstone." "Blockhead!"
exclaims the irate king, "could a millstone be hidden in a man's hand?"
Then addressing the learned man, "Take him away," he says, "and *teach*
him."

Lastly, we have a somewhat different specimen of the silly son in the
doctor's apprentice, whose attempt to imitate his master was so
ludicrously unsuccessful. He used to accompany his master on his visits
to patients, and one day the doctor said to a sick man, to whom he had
been called, "I know what is the matter with you, and it is useless to
deny it;--you have been eating beans." On their way home, the
apprentice, admiring his master's sagacity, begged to be informed how he
knew that the patient had been eating beans. "Boy," said the doctor,

<span id="p.169">p.169</span>

loftily, "I drew an inference." "An inference!" echoed this youth of
inquiring mind; "and what is an inference?" Quoth the doctor, "Listen:
when we came to the door, I observed the shells of beans lying about,
and I drew the inference that the family had had beans for dinner."
Another day it chanced that the doctor did not take his apprentice with
him when he went his rounds, and in his absence a message came for him
to visit a person who had been taken suddenly ill. "Here," thought the
apprentice, "is a chance for my putting master's last lesson into
practice;" so off he went to the sick man, and assuming as "knowing" an
air as he could, he felt his pulse, and then said to him severely,
"Don't deny it; I see by your pulse that you have been eating a horse. I
shall send you some medicine." When the doctor returned home he inquired
of his hopeful pupil, whether any person had called for him, upon which
the wittol proudly told him of his own exploit. "Eaten a horse!"
exclaimed the man of physic. "In the name of all that's wonderful, what
induced you to say such a thing?" Quoth the youth, simpering, "Why, sir,
I did as you did the other day, when we visited the old farmer--I drew
an inference." "You drew an inference, did you? And how did you draw the
inference that the man had

<span id="p.170">p.170</span>

eaten a horse?" "Why, very readily, sir; for as I entered the house I
saw a saddle hanging on the wall."\[1\]

\[1\] Under the title of "The Phisitian that bare his Paciente in honde
that he had eaten an Asse" this jest occurs in *Merry Tales and Quicke
Answeres,* and Professor Crane gives a Sicilian version in his *Italian
Popular Tales.*
