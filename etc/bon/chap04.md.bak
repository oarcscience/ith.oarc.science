CHAPTER IV.  
GOTHAMITE DROLLERIES (*continued*).

<img src="images/image013.png" width="94" height="96" alt="T" />ALES of
sharpers' tricks upon simpletons do not quite fall within the scope of
the present series of papers, but there is one, in the *Arabian
Nights*--not found, however, in our common English version of that
fascinating story-book--which deserves a place among noodle-stories,
since it is so diverting, is not very generally known, and is probably
the original of the early Italian novel of the *Monk Transformed,* which
is ascribed to Michele Colombo:

A rustic simpleton was walking homeward dragging his ass after him by
the halter, which a brace of sharpers observing, one said to his fellow,
"Come with me, and I will take the ass from that man." He then quietly
advanced to the ass, unloosed it from the halter, and gave the animal to
his companion, who went off with it, after which he put the halter over
his own head, and allowed

<span id="p.82">p.82</span>

the rustic to drag him for some little distance, until he with the ass
was fairly out of sight, when he suddenly stopped, and the man having
tugged at the halter several times without effect, looked round, and,
amazed to see a human being in place of his beast, exclaimed, "Who art
thou?" The sharper answered, "I was thy ass; but hear my story, for it
is wonderful. I had a good and pious mother, and one day I came home
intoxicated. Grieved to see me in such a state, she gently reproved me,
but I, instead of being penetrated with remorse, beat her with a stick,
whereupon she prayed to Allah, and, in answer to her supplication, lo! I
was transformed into an ass. In that shape I have continued until this
day, when my mother, as it appears, has interceded for my restoration to
human form, as before." The simpleton, believing every word of this
strange story, raised his eyes to heaven, saying, "Of a truth there is
no power but from Allah! But, pray, forgive me for having used thee as I
have done." The sharper readily granted his forgiveness, and went off to
rejoin his companion and dispose of the ass; while the simpleton
returned home, and showing his wife the bridle, told her of the
marvellous transformation which had occurred. His wife, in hopes of
propitiating Heaven, gave

<span id="p.83">p.83</span>

alms and offered up many prayers to avert evil from them, on account of
their having used a human being as an ass. At length the simpleton,
having remained idle at home for some time, went one day to the market
to purchase another ass, and on entering the place where all the animals
were fastened, he saw with astonishment his old ass offered for sale.
Putting his mouth to its ear, he whispered, "Woe to thee, unlucky!
Doubtless thou hast again been intoxicated; but, by Allah, I will never
buy thee!"

Another noodle-story, of a different class, in the *Arabian Nights,* may
be here cited in full from Sir R.F. Burton's translation of that
delightful work, privately printed for the subscribers, and it will
serve, moreover, as a fair specimen of the admirable manner in which
that ripe scholar has represented in English the quaint style of his
original:

\[Quoth one of the learned,\] I passed once by a school wherein a
schoolmaster was teaching children; so I entered, finding him a
good-looking man, and a well-dressed, when he rose to me and made me sit
with him. Then I examined him in the Koran, and in syntax and prosody,
and lexicography; and behold, he was perfect in all required of him; and
I said to him, "Allah strengthen

<span id="p.84">p.84</span>

thy purpose! Thou art indeed versed in all that is requisite."
Thereafter I frequented him a while, discovering daily some new
excellence in, him, and quoth I to myself, "This is indeed a wonder in
any dominie; for the wise are agreed upon a lack of wit in children's
teachers."\[1\] Then I separated myself from him, and sought him and
visited him only every few days, till coming to see him one day, as of
wont, I found the school shut, and made inquiry of his neighbours, who
replied, "Some one is dead in his house." So I said in my mind, "It
behoveth me to pay him a visit of condolence," and going to his house,
knocked at the door, when a slave-girl came out to me and asked, "What
dost thou want?" and I answered, "I want thy master." She replied, "He
is sitting alone mourning;" and I rejoined, "Tell him that his friend
So-and-so seeketh to console him." She went in and told him; and he
said, "Admit him." So she brought me in to him, and I found him seated
alone, and his head bound with

\[1\] This notion, that schoolmasters "lack wit," however absurd, seems
to have been entertained from ancient times, and to be still prevalent
in the East; the so-called jests of Hierokles are all at the expense of
pedants; and the Turkish typical noodle is Khoja (*i.e.,* Teacher)
Nasru-'d-Dín, some of whose "witless devices" shall be cited presently.

<span id="p.85">p.85</span>

mourning fillets. So I said to him, "Allah requite thee amply! This is a
path all must perforce tread, and it behoveth thee to take patience,"
adding, "but who is dead unto thee?" He answered, "One who was dearest
of the folk to me, and best beloved." "Perhaps thy father?" "No." "Thy
brother?" "No." "One of thy kindred?" "No." Then asked I, "What relation
was the dead to thee?" and he answered, "My lover." Quoth I to myself,
"This is the first proof to swear by of his lack of wit." So I said to
him, "Assuredly there be others than she, and fairer;" and he made
answer, "I never saw her that I might judge whether or no there be
others fairer than she." Quoth I to myself, "This is another proof
positive." Then I said to him, "And how couldst thou fall in love with
one thou hast never seen?" He replied, "Know that I was sitting one day
at the window, when, lo! there passed by a man, singing the following
distich:

> "'Umm Amr', thy boons Allah repay!  
> Give back my heart, be't where it may!'"

The schoolmaster continued, "When I heard the man humming these words as
he passed along the street, I said to myself, 'Except this Umm Amrú were
without equal in the world, the poets had not celebrated her in ode and

<span id="p.86">p.86</span>

canzon.' So I fell in love with her; but two days after, the same man
passed, singing the following couplet:

> "'Ass and Umm Amr' went their way,  
> Nor she nor ass returned for aye.'

Thereupon I knew that she was dead, and mourned for her. This was three
days ago, and I have been mourning ever since." So I left him and fared
forth, having assured myself of the weakness of the gerund-grinder's
wit.\[1\]

Here, surely, was the very Father of Folly, but what shall we say of
judges and magistrates being sometimes (represented as) equally witless?
Thus we are told, among the cases decided by a Turkish Kází, that two
men came before him one of whom complained that the other had almost bit
his ear off. The accused denied this, and declared that the fellow had
bit his own ear. After pondering the matter for some time, the judge
told them to come again two hours later. Then he went into his private
room,

\[1\] *Elf Laylawa Layla,* or, The Book of a Thousand Nights and a
Night. Translated, with Introduction, Notes on the Manners and Customs
of Moslem Men, and a Terminal Essay on the History of *The Nights,* by
R.F. Burton. Vol. v.

<span id="p.87">p.87</span>

and attempted to bring his ear and his mouth together; but all he did
was to fall backwards and break his head. Wrapping a cloth round his
head, he returned to court, and the two men coming in again presently,
he thus decided the question: "No man can bite his own ear, but in
trying to do so he may fall down and break his head.''

A Sinhalese story, which is also well known in various forms in India,
furnishes a still more remarkable example of forensic sagacity. It is
thus related by the able editor of *The Orientalist,* vol. i., p. 191:

One night some thieves broke into the house of a rich man, and carried
away all his valuables. The man complained to the justice of the peace,
who had the robbers captured, and when brought before him, inquired of
them whether they had anything to say in their defence. "Sir," said
they, "we are not to blame in this matter; the robbery was entirely due
to the mason who built the house; for the walls were so badly made, and
gave way so easily, that we were quite unable to resist the temptation
of breaking in." Orders were then given to bring the mason to the
court-house. On his arrival he was informed of the charge brought
against him. "Ah," said he, "the fault is not mine, but that of the
coolie, who made mortar

<span id="p.88">p.88</span>

badly.'' When the coolie was brought, he laid the blame on the potter,
who, he said, had sold him a cracked chattie, in which he could not
carry sufficient water to mix the mortar properly. Then the potter was
brought before the judge, and he explained that the blame should not be
laid upon him, but upon a very pretty woman, who, in a beautiful dress,
was passing at the time he was making the chattie, and had so riveted
his attention, that he forgot all about the work. When the woman
appeared, she protested that the fault was not hers, for she would not
have been in that neighbourhood at all had the goldsmith sent home her
earrings at the proper time; the charge, she argued, should properly be
brought against him. The goldsmith was brought, and as he was unable to
offer any reasonable excuse, he was condemned to be hanged. Those in the
court, however, begged the judge to spare the goldsmith's life; "for,"
said they, "he is very sick and ill-favoured, and would not make at all
a pretty spectacle." "But," said the judge, "somebody must be hanged."
Then they drew the attention of the court to the fact that there was a
fat Moorman in a shop opposite, who was a much fitter subject for an
execution, and asked that he might be hanged in the goldsmith's stead.
The learned judge, considering that this

<span id="p.89">p.89</span>

arrangement would be very satisfactory, gave judgment accordingly.

If some of the last-cited stories are not precisely Gothamite
drolleries, though all are droll enough in their way, there can be no
doubt whatever that we have a Sinhalese brother to the men of Gotham in
the following: A villager in Ceylon, whose calf had got its head into a
pot and could not get it out again, sent for a friend, celebrated for
his wisdom, to release the poor animal. The sagacious friend, taking in
the situation at a glance, cut off the calfs head, broke the pot, and
then delivered the head to the owner of the calf, saying, "What will you
do when I am dead and gone?"--And we have another Gothamite in the
Kashmiri who bought as much rice as he thought would suffice for a
year's food, and finding he had only enough for eleven months, concluded
it was better to fast the other month right off, which he did
accordingly; but he died just before the month was completed, leaving
eleven months' rice in his house.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The typical noodle of the Turks, the Khoja Nasru-'d-Dín, is said to have
been a subject of the independent prince of Karaman, at

<span id="p.90">p.90</span>

whose capital, Konya, he resided, and he is represented as a
contemporary of Tímúr (Tamerlane), in the middle of the fourteenth
century. The pleasantries which are ascribed to him are for the most
part common to all countries, but some are probably of genuine Turkish
origin. To cite a few specimens: The Khoja's wife said to him one day,
"Make me a present of a kerchief of red Yemen silk, to put on my head."
The Khoja stretched out his arms and said, "Like that? Is that large
enough?" On her replying in the affirmative he ran off to the bazaar,
with his arms still stretched out, and meeting a man on the road, he
bawled to him, "Look where you are going, O man, or you will cause me to
lose my measure!"

Another day the Khoja's wife washed his caftan and spread it upon a tree
in the garden of the house. That night the Khoja goes out, and thinks he
sees in the moonlight a man motionless upon a tree in the garden. "Give
me my bow and arrows," said he to his wife, and having received them, he
shot the caftan, piercing it through and through, and then returned into
the house. Next morning, when he discovered that it was his own caftan
he had shot at, he exclaimed, "By Allah, had I happened to be in it, I
should have killed myself!"

<span id="p.91">p.91</span>

The Ettrick Shepherd's well-known story of the two Highlanders and the
wild boar has its exact parallel in the Turkish jest-book, as follows:
One day the Khoja went with his friend Sheragh Ahmed to the den of a
wolf, in order to take the cubs. Said the Khoja to Ahmed, "Do you go in,
and I will watch without; "and Ahmed went in, to take the cubs in the
absence of the old wolf. But she came back presently, and had got
half-way into her den when the Khoja seized hold of her tail. The wolf
in her struggles cast up a great dust into the eyes of Ahmed, who called
out to the Khoja, "Hallo! what does all this dust mean?" The Khoja
replied, "If the wolf's tail breaks, you will soon know what the dust
means!"

Several of the jests closely resemble "Joe Millers" told of Irishmen,
such as this: It happened one night, after the Khoja and a guest had
lain down to sleep, that the taper went out. "O Khoja Effendi," said the
guest, "the taper is gone out. But there is a taper at your right side.
Pray bring it and let us light it." Quoth the Khoja, "You must surely be
a fool to think that I should know my right hand in the dark." And this:
A thief having stolen a piece of salted cheese from the Khoja, he ran
immediately and seated himself on the border of a fountain. Said the
people to him,

<span id="p.92">p.92</span>

"O Khoja, what have you come here to look for in such a hurry?" The
Khoja replied, "The thief will certainly come here to drink as soon as
he has eaten my salted cheese; I always do so myself."

And here is one of the Gothamite class: One evening the Khoja went to
the well to draw water, and seeing the moon reflected in the water, he
exclaimed, "The moon has fallen into the well; I must pull it out." So
he let down the rope and hook, and the hook became fastened to a stone,
whereupon he exerted all his strength, and the rope broke, and he fell
upon his back. Looking into the sky, he saw the moon, and cried out
joyfully, "Praise be to Allah! I am sorely bruised, but the moon has got
into its place again."

There is a well-worn jest of an Irishman who, being observed by a friend
to look exceedingly blank and perplexed, was asked what ailed him. He
replied that he had had a dream. "Was it a good or a bad dream?"
"Faith," said he, "it was a little of both; but I'll tell ye. I dreamt
that I was with the Pope, who was the finest gentleman in the whole
district; and after we had conversed a while, his Holiness axed me,
Would I drink? Thinks I to myself, 'Would a duck swim?' So, seeing the
whisky and the lemons and the

<span id="p.93">p.93</span>

sugar on the side-board, I said, I didn't mind if I took a drop of
punch. 'Cold or hot?' says his Holiness. 'Hot, your Holiness,' says I.
So on that he steps down to the kitchen for the boiling water, but,
bedad, before he came back, I woke straight up; and now it's distressing
me that I didn't take it cold!"

We have somewhat of a parallel to this in a Turkish jest: The Khoja
dreamt that some one gave him nine pieces of money, but he was not
content, and said, "Make it ten." Then he awoke and found his hands
empty. Instantly closing his eyes again, and holding out his hand, he
said, "I repent; give me the nine pieces."\[1\]

But the Chinese relate the very counterpart of our Irishman's story. A
confirmed drunkard dreamt that he had been presented with a cup of
excellent wine, and set it by the fire to warm,\[2\] that he should
better enjoy the flavour of it; but just as he was about to drink off
the delicious draught he awoke.

\[1\] The Khoja, however, was not such a fool as we might conclude from
the foregoing examples of his sayings and doings; for, being asked one
day what musical instrument he liked best, he answered, "I am very fond
of the music of plates and saucepans."

\[2\] In China wine is almost invariably taken hot, according to Davis,
in his work on the Chinese.

<span id="p.94">p.94</span>

"Fool that I am," he cried, "why was I not content to drink it
cold?"\[1\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Chinese seem to have as keen a sense of humour as any other people.
They tell a story, for instance, of a lady who had been recently
married, and on the third day saw her husband returning home, so she
slipped quiatly behind him and gave him a hearty kiss. The husband was
annoyed, and said she offended all propriety. "Pardon! pardon!" said
she. "I did not know it was you." Thus the excuse may sometimes be worse
than the offence. There is exquisite humour in the following
noodle-story: Two brothers were tilling the ground together. The elder,
having prepared dinner, called his brother, who replied in a loud voice,
"Wait till I have hidden my spade, and I shall at once be with you."
When he joined his elder brother, the latter mildly reproached him,
saying, "When one hides anything, one should keep silence, or at least
should not cry aloud about it, for it lays one open to be robbed."
Dinner over,

\[1\] This and the following specimens of Chinese stories of simpletons
are from "Contes et Bon Mots extraits d'un livre chinois intitulé *Siao
li Siao,* traduit par M. Stanislas Julien," (*Journal Asiatique,* torn,
iv., 1824).

<span id="p.95">p.95</span>

the younger went back to the field, and looked for his spade, but could
not find it; so he ran to his brother and *whispered* mysteriously in
his ear, "My spade is stolen!"--The passion for collecting antique
relics is thus ridiculed: A man who was fond of old curiosities, though
he knew not the true from the false, expended all his wealth in
purchasing mere imitations of the lightning-stick of Tchew-Koung, a
glazed cup of the time of the Emperor Cheun, and the mat of Confucius;
and being reduced to beggary, he carried these spurious relics about
with him, and said to the people in the streets, "Sirs, I pray you, give
me some coins struck by Taï-Koung."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indian fiction abounds in stories of simpletons, and probably the oldest
extant drolleries of the Gothamite type are found in the *Játakas,* or
Buddhist Birth-stories. Assuredly they were own brothers to our mad men
of Gotham, the Indian villagers who, being pestered by mosquitoes when
at work in the forest, bravely resolved, according to *Jútaka* 44, to
take their bows and arrows and other weapons and make war upon the
troublesome insects until they had shot dead or cut in pieces every one;
but in trying to shoot the mosquitoes they only shot, struck, and
injured

<span id="p.96">p.96</span>

one another. And nothing more foolish is recorded of the Schildburgers
than Somadeva relates, in his *Kathá Sarit Ságara,* of the simpletons
who cut down the palm-trees: Being required to furnish the king with a
certain quantity of dates, and perceiving that it was very easy to
gather the dates of a palm which had fallen down of itself, they set to
work and cut down all the date-palms in their village, and having
gathered from them their whole crop of dates, they raised them up and
planted them again, thinking they would grow. In illustration of the
apothegm that "fools who attend only to the words of an order, and do
not understand the meaning, cause much detriment," is the story of the
servants who kept the rain off the trunks: The camel of a merchant gave
way under its load on a journey. He said to his servants, "I will go and
buy another camel to carry the half of this camel's load. And you must
remain here, and take particular care that if it clouds over the rain
does not wet the leather of these trunks, which are full of clothes."
With these words the merchant left the servants by the side of the camel
and went off, and suddenly a cloud came up and began to discharge rain.
Then the fools said, "Our master told us to take care that the rain did
not touch the leather of the trunks;" and after they had

<span id="p.97">p.97</span>

made this sage reflection they dragged the clothes out of the trunks and
wrapped them round the leather. The consequence was that the rain
spoiled the clothes. Then the merchant returned, and in a rage said to
his servants, "You rascals! Talk of water! Why, the whole stock of
clothes is spoiled by the rain!" And they answered him, "You told us to
keep the rain off the leather of the trunks. What fault have we
committed?" He answered, "I told you that if the leather got wet the
clothes would be spoiled. I told you so in order to save the clothes,
not the leather."

The story of the servant who looked after the door is a farther
illustration of the same maxim. A merchant said to his foolish servant,
"Take care of the door of my shop; I am going home for a short time."
After his master was gone, the fool took the shop-door on his shoulder
and went off to see an actor perform. As he was returning his master met
him, and gave him a scolding, and he answered, "I have taken care of
this door, as you told me."

This jest had found its way into Europe three centuries ago. It is
related of Giufa, the typical Sicilian booby, and probably came to
England from Italy. This is how it is told in the *Sacke Full of Newes,*
a jest-book

<span id="p.98">p.98</span>

originally printed in the sixteenth century: "In the countrey dwelt a
Gentlewoman who had a French man dwelling with her, and he did ever use
to go to Church with her; and upon a time he and his mistresse were
going to church, and she bad him pull the doore after him and follow her
to the church; and so he took the doore betweene his armes, and lifted
it from the hooks, and followed his mistresse with it. But when she
looked behinde her and saw him bring the doore upon his back, 'Why, thou
foolish knave,' qd she, 'what wilt thou do with the door?' 'Marry,
mistresse,' qd he, 'you bad me pull the doore after me.' 'Why, fool,' qd
she, 'I did command thee that thou shouldest make fast the doore after
thee, and not bring it upon thy back after me.' But after this there was
much good sport and laughing at his simplicity and foolishnesse
therein."

In the capacity of a merchant the simpleton does very wonderful things,
and plumes himself on his sagacity, as we have already seen in the case
of the Arab and his cow. And here are a brace of similar stories: A
foolish man once went to the island of Katáha to trade, and among his
wares was a quantity of fragrant aloes-wood. After he had sold his other
goods, he could not find any one to take the aloes-wood off his hands,
for the people

<span id="p.99">p.99</span>

who live there are not acquainted with that article of commerce. Then
seeing people buying charcoal from the woodmen, he burnt his stock of
aloes-wood and reduced it to charcoal. He sold it for the price which
charcoal usually fetched, and returning home, boasted of his cleverness,
and became the laughing-stock of everybody.--Another blockhead went to
the market to sell cotton, but no one would buy it from him, because it
was not properly cleaned. In the meanwhile he saw in the bazaar a
goldsmith selling gold which he had purified by heating it, and he saw
it taken by a customer. Seeing that, he threw his cotton into the fire
in order to purify it, and it was all burned to ashes.

There must be few who have not heard of the Irishman who was hired by a
Yarmouth maltster to help in loading a ship. As the vessel was about to
sail, the Irishman cried out from the quay, "Captain, I lost your shovel
overboard, but I cut a big notch on the rail-fence, round the stern,
just where it went down, so you will find it when you come back."--A
similar story is told of an Indian simpleton. He was sailing in a ship
when he let a silver cup fall from his hand into the water. Having taken
notes of the spot by observing the eddies and other signs in the

<span id="p.100">p.100</span>

water, he said to himself, "I will bring it up from the bottom when I
return." As he was recrossing the sea, he saw the eddies and other
signs, and thinking he recognised the spot, he plunged into the water
again and again, to recover his cup, but he only got well laughed at for
his pains.

We have an amusing commentary on the maxim that "distress is sure to
come from being in the company of fools" in the following, from the
Canarese story-book entitled *Kathá Manjari:* A foolish fellow travelled
with a shopkeeper. When it became dark, the fool lay down in the road to
sleep, but the shopkeeper took shelter in a hollow tree. Presently some
thieves came along the road, and one struck his feet against the fool's
legs, upon which he exclaimed to his companions, "What is this? Is it a
piece of wood?" The fool was angry, and said, "Go away! go away! Is
there a knot, well tied, containing five annas, in the loins of a plank
in your house?" The thieves then seized him, and took away his annas. As
they were moving off, they asked if the money was good or bad, to which
the noodle replied, "Ha! ha! is it of my money you speak in that way,
and want to know whether it is good or bad? Look--there is a shopkeeper
in that tree," pointing with his finger--"show it to him." Then the
thieves

<span id="p.101">p.101</span>

went up to the shopkeeper and robbed him of two hundred pagodas.

In our next story, of the villagers who ate the buffalo, is exemplified
the fact that "fools, in the conceit of their folly, while they deny
what need not be denied, reveal what it is their interest to suppress,
in order to get themselves believed." Some villagers took a buffalo
belonging to a certain man, and killed it in an enclosure outside the
village, under a banyan tree, and dividing the flesh, ate it up. The
owner of the buffalo went and complained to the king, and he had the
villagers who had eaten the animal brought before him. The proprietor of
the buffalo said before the king, in their presence, "These men took my
buffalo under a banyan tree near the tank, and killed and ate it before
my eyes," whereupon an old fool among the villagers said, "There is no
tank or banyan tree in our village. He says what is not true; where did
we kill his buffalo or eat it?" When the man heard this, he replied,
"What! are there not a banyan tree and a tank on the east side of the
village? Moreover, you ate my buffalo on the eighth day of the lunar
month." The old fool then said, "There is no east side or eighth day in
our village." On hearing this, the king laughed, and said, to encourage
the fool, "You are a truthful person; you never say anything false;

<span id="p.102">p.102</span>

so tell me the truth: did you eat that buffalo, or did you not?" The old
fool answered, "I was born three years after my father died, and he
taught me skill in speaking. So I never say what is untrue, my king. It
is true that we ate his buffalo, but all the rest that he alleges is
false," When the king heard this, he and his courtiers could not
restrain their laughter; but he restored the price of the buffalo to the
man, and fined the villagers.

But sometimes even kings have been arrant noodles, and their credulity
quite as amusing --or amazing--as that of their subjects. Once on a time
there was a king who had a handsome daughter, and he summoned his
physicians, and said to them, "Make some preparation of salutary drugs,
which will cause my daughter to grow up quickly, so that she may be
married to a good husband." The physicians, wishing to get a living out
of this royal fool, replied, "There is a medicine which will do this,
but it can only be procured in a distant country; and while we are
sending for it, we must shut up your daughter in concealment, for this
is the treatment laid down in such cases." The king having consented,
they placed his daughter in concealment for several years, pretending
that they were engaged in procuring the medicine; and when she was grown
up, they presented her to the king, say-

<span id="p.103">p.103</span>

ing that she had been made to grow by the preparation; so the king was
highly pleased, and gave them much wealth.

Between an Indian rájá and an Indian dhobie, or washerman, there is the
greatest possible difference socially, but individually --when both are
noodles--there may be sometimes very little to choose; indeed, of the
two, all things considered, the difference, if any, is perhaps in favour
of the humble cleanser of body-clothes. A favourite story in various
parts of India, near akin to that last cited, is of a poor washerman and
his young ass. This simpleton one day, passing a school kept by a
mullah, or Muhammedan doctor of laws, heard him scolding his pupils,
exclaiming that they were still asses, although he had done so much to
make them men. The washerman thought that here was a rare chance, for he
happened to have the foal of the ass that carried his bundles of
clothes, which, since he had no child, he should get the learned mullah
to change into a boy. Thus thinking, he goes next day to the mullah, and
asks him to admit his foal into his school, in order that it should be
changed into the human form and nature. The preceptor, seeing the poor
fellow's simplicity, answered that the task was very laborious,

<span id="p.104">p.104</span>

and he must have a fee of a hundred rupis. So the washerman went home,
and soon returned leading his foal, which, with the money, he handed
over to the teacher, who told him to come again on such a day and hour,
when he should find that the change he desired had been effected. But
the washerman was so impatient that he went to the teacher several times
before the day appointed, and was informed that the foal was beginning
to learn manners, that its ears were already become very much shorter,
and, in short, that it was making satisfactory progress.

It happened, when the day came on which he was to receive his young ass
transformed into a fine, well-educated boy, the simpleton was kept busy
with his customers' clothes, but on the day following he found time to
go to the teacher, who told him it was most unfortunate he had not come
at the appointed hour, since the youth had quitted the school yesterday,
refusing to submit any longer to authority; but the teacher had just
learned that he had been made kází (or judge) in Cawnpore. At first the
washerman was disposed to be angry, but reflecting that, after all, the
business was better even than he anticipated, he thanked the preceptor
for all his care and trouble, and returned home.

<span id="p.105">p.105</span>

Having informed his wife of his good luck, they resolved to visit their
quondam young foal, and get him to make them some allowance out of his
now ample means. So, shutting up their house, they travelled to
Cawnpore, which they reached in safety. Being directed to the kází's
court, the washerman, leaving his wife outside, entered, and discovered
the kází seated in great dignity, and before him were the pleaders,
litigants, and officers of the court. He had brought a bridle in one
hand and a wisp of hay in the other; but being unable, on account of the
crowd, to approach the kází, he got tired of waiting, so, holding up the
bridle and the hay, he cried out, "Khoor! khoor! khoor!" as he used to
do in calling his donkeys, thinking this would induce the kází to come
to him. But, instead of this, he was seized by the kází's order and
locked up for creating a disturbance.

When the business of the court was over, the kází, pitying the supposed
madman, sent for him to learn the reason of his strange behaviour, and
in answer to his inquiries the simpleton said, "You don't seem to know
me, sir, nor recognise this bridle, which has been in your mouth so
often. You appear to forget that you are the foal of one of my asses,
that I got changed into a man, for the

<span id="p.106">p.106</span>

fee of a hundred rupis, by a learned mullah who transforms asses into
educated men. You forget what you were, and, I suppose, will be as
little submissive to me as you were to the mullah when you ran away from
him." All present were convulsed with laughter: such a "case" was never
heard of before. But the kází, seeing how the mullah had taken advantage
of the poor fellow's simplicity, gave him a present of a hundred rupis,
besides sufficient for the expenses of his journey home, and so
dismissed him.

A party of rogues once found as great a blockhead in a rich Indian
herdsman, to whom they said, "We have asked the daughter of a wealthy
inhabitant of the town in marriage for you, and her father has promised
to give her." He was much pleased to hear this, and gave them an ample
reward for their trouble. After a few days they came again and told him
that his marriage had taken place. Again he gave them rich presents for
their good news. Some more days having passed, they said to him, "A son
has been born to you," at which he was in ecstacies and gave them all
his remaining wealth; but the next day, when he began to lament, saying,
"I am longing to see my son," the people laughed at him on account of
his

<span id="p.107">p.107</span>

having been cheated by the rogues, as if he had acquired the stupidity
of cattle from having so much to do with them.

It is not generally known that the incident which forms the subject of
the droll Scotch song "The Barring of the Door," which also occurs in
the *Nights* of Straparola, is of Eastern origin. In an Arabian tale, a
blockhead, having married his pretty cousin, gave the customary feast to
their relations and friends. When the festivities were over, he
conducted his guests to the door, and from absence of mind neglected to
shut it before returning to his wife. "Dear cousin," said his wife to
him when they were alone, "go and shut the street door." "It would be
strange indeed," he replied, "if I did such a thing. Am I just made a
bridegroom, clothed in silk, wearing a shawl and a dagger set with
diamonds, and am I to go and shut the door? Why, my dear, you are crazy.
Go and shut it yourself." "Oh, indeed!" exclaimed the wife. "Am I,
young, robed in a dress, with lace and precious stones--am I to go and
shut the street door? No, indeed! It is you who are become crazy, and
not I. Come, let us make a bargain," she continued; "and let the first
who speaks go and fasten the door." "Agreed," said the husband, and
immediately he became mute, and the wife too

<span id="p.108">p.108</span>

was silent, while they both sat down, dressed as they were in their
nuptial attire, looking at each other and seated on opposite sofas. Thus
they remained for two hours. Some thieves happened to pass by, and
seeing the door open, entered and laid hold of whatever came to their
hands. The silent couple heard footsteps in the house, but opened not
their mouths. The thieves came into the room and saw them seated
motionless and apparently indifferent to all that might take place. They
continued their pillage, therefore, collecting together everything
valuable, and even dragging away the carpets from beneath them; they
laid hands on the noodle and his wife, taking from their persons every
article of jewellery, while they, in fear of losing the wager, said not
a word. Having thus cleared the house, the thieves departed quietly, but
the pair continued to sit, uttering not a syllable. Towards morning a
police officer came past on his tour of inspection, and seeing the door
open, walked in. After searching all the rooms and finding no person, he
entered their apartment, and inquired the meaning of what he saw.
Neither of them would condescend to reply. The officer became angry, and
ordered their heads to be cut off. The executioner's sword was about to
perform its office, when the wife cried out,

<span id="p.109">p.109</span>

"Sir, he is my husband. Do not kill him!" "Oh, oh," exclaimed the
husband, overjoyed and clapping his hands, "you have lost the wager; go
and shut the door." He then explained the whole affair to the police
officer, who shrugged his shoulders and went away.\[1\]

A party of noodles are substituted for the husband and wife in a Turkish
version of the tale, in the *History of the Forty Vazirs.* Some
bang-eaters,\[2\] while out walking, found a sequin. They said, "Let us
go to a cook, and buy food and eat." So they went and entered a cook's
shop and said, "Master, give us a sequin's worth of food." The cook
prepared all kinds of food, and loaded a porter with it; and the
bang-eaters

\[1\] In another Arabian version, the man desires his wife to moisten
some stale bread she has set before him for supper, and she refuses.
After an altercation it is agreed that the one who speaks first shall
get up and moisten the bread. A neighbour comes in, and, to his
surprise, finds the couple dumb; he kisses the wife, but the man says
nothing; he gives the man a blow, but still he says nothing; he has the
man taken before the kází, but even yet he says nothing; the kází orders
him to be hanged, and he is led off to execution, when the wife rushes
up and cries out, "Oh, save my poor husband!" "You wretch," says the
man, "go home and moisten the bread!"

\[2\] Bang is a preparation of hemp and coarse opium.

<span id="p.110">p.110</span>

took him without the city, where there was a ruined tomb, which they
entered and sat down in, and the porter deposited the food and went
away. The bang-eaters began to partake of the food, when suddenly one of
them said, "The door is open; do one of you shut it, else some other
bang-eaters will come in and annoy us: even though they be friends, they
will do the deeds of foes." One of them replied, "Go thou and shut the
door," and they fell a-quarrelling. At length one said, "Come, let us
agree that whichever of us speaks or laughs shall rise and fasten the
door." They all agreed to this proposal, and left the food and sat quite
still. Suddenly a great number of dogs came in; not one of the
bang-eaters stirred or spoke, for if one spoke he would have to rise and
shut the door, so they spoke not. The dogs made an end of the food, and
ate it all up. Just then another dog leapt in from without, but no food
remained. Now one of the bang-eaters had partaken of everything, and
some of the food remained about his mouth and on his beard. That newly
come dog licked up the particles of food that were on the bang-eater's
breast, and while he was licking up those about his mouth, he took his
lip for a piece of meat and bit it. The bang-eater did not stir, for he
said within himself, "They will tell me to

<span id="p.111">p.111</span>

shut the door." But to ease his soul he cried, "Ough!" inwardly cursing
the dog. When the other bang-eaters heard him make that noise, they
said, "Rise, fasten the door." He replied, "After loss, attention! Now
that the food is gone, and my lip is wounded, what is the use of
shutting that door?" and crying, "Woe! alas!" they each went in a
different direction.\[1\]

A similar story is known in Kashmir: Five friends chanced to meet, and
all having leisure, they decided to go to the bazaar and purchase a
sheep's head, and have a great feast in the house of one of the party,
each of whom subscribed four annas. The head was bought, but while they
were returning to the house it was remembered that there was not any
butter. On this one of the five proposed that the first of them that
should break silence by speaking should go for the butter. Now it was no
light matter to have to retrace one's steps back to the butter-shop, as
the way was long and the day was very hot. So they all five kept strict
silence. Pots were cleaned, the fire was prepared, and the head laid
thereon. Now and then one would cough, and another would groan, but
never a tongue uttered a word, though the fire was

\[1\] From Mr. E.J.W. Gibb's translation of the *Forty Vazírs* (London:
1886).

<span id="p.112">p.112</span>

fast going out, and the head was getting burnt, owing to there being no
fat or butter wherewith to grease the pot. Thus matters were when a
policeman passed by, and, attracted by the smell of cooking, looked in
at the window, and saw these five men perfectly silent and sitting
around a burnt sheep's head. Not knowing the arrangement, he supposed
that these men were either mad or were thieves, and so he inquired how
they came there, and how they obtained the head. Not a word was uttered
in reply. "Why are you squatting there in that stupid fashion?" shouted
the policeman. Still no reply. Then the policeman, full of rage that
these wretched men should thus mock at his authority, took them all off
straight to the police inspector's office. On arrival the inspector
asked them the reason of their strange behaviour, but he also got no
reply. This rather tried the patience and temper of the man of
authority, who was generally feared, and flattered, and bribed. So he
ordered one of the five to be immediately flogged. The poor fool bore it
bravely, and uttered never a sound; but when the blows repeatedly fell
on the same wounded parts, he could endure no longer, and cried out,
"Oh! oh! Why do you beat me? Enough, enough! Is it not enough that the
sheep's head has been spoiled?"

<span id="p.113">p.113</span>

His four associates now cried out, "Go to the bazaar and fetch the
butter."\[1\]

There is quite as droll a version current among the people of Ceylon, to
the following effect: A gentleman once had in his employment twenty-five
idiots. In the old times it was customary with Sinhalese high families
not to allow their servants to eat from plates, but every day they were
supplied with plantain leaves, from which they took their food. After
eating, they were accustomed to shape the leaf into the form of a cup
and drink out of it. Now in this gentleman's house the duty of providing
the leaves devolved upon the twenty-five idiots, who were scarcely fit
for any other work. One day, when they had gone into the garden to cut
the leaves, they spoke among themselves and said, "Why should we, every
one of us, trouble ourselves to fetch plantain leaves, when one only
could very easily do it? Let us therefore lie down on the ground and
sleep

\[1\] Knowles' *Dictionary of Kashmírí Proverbs and Sayings,* pp. 197-8.
The article bought by the five men is called a *hír,* which Mr. Knowles
says "is the head of any animal used for food," and a *sheep's* head
were surely fitting food for such noodles. Mr. Knowles makes it appear
that the whole affair of keeping silence was a mere jest, but we have
before seen that it is decidedly meant for a noodle-story.

<span id="p.114">p.114</span>

like dead men, and let him who first utters a sound or opens his eyes
undertake the work." It was no sooner said than done. The men lay in a
heap like so many logs. At breakfast-time that day the hungry servants
went to the kitchen for their rice, only to be disappointed. No leaves
were forthcoming on which to distribute the food, and a complaint was
made to the master that the twenty-five idiots had not returned to the
house since they went out in the morning. Search was at once made, and
they were found fast asleep in the garden. After vainly endeavouring to
rouse them, the master concluded that they were dead, and ordered his
servants to dig a deep hole and bury them. A grave was then dug, and the
idiots were, one by one, thrown into it, but still there was no noise or
motion on their part. At length, when they were all put into the grave,
and were being covered up, a tool employed by one of the servants hit
sharply by accident against the leg of one of the idiots, who then
involuntarily moaned. Thereupon all the others exclaimed, "You were the
first to utter a sound; therefore from henceforth you must take upon
yourself the duty of providing the plantain leaves."\[1\] It has already
been remarked that a literary

\[1\] *The Orientalist,* 1884, p. 136.

<span id="p.115">p.115</span>

Italian version of the Silent Couple is found in the *Nights* of
Straparola, but there are other variants orally current among the common
people in different parts of Italy. This is one from Venice: There were
once a husband and a wife. The former said one day to the latter, "Let
us have some fritters." She replied, "What shall we do for a
frying-pan?" "Go and borrow one from my godmother." "You go and get it;
it is only a little way off." "Go yourself, and I will take it back when
we are done with it." So she went and borrowed the pan, and when she
returned said to her husband, "Here is the pan, but you must carry it
back." So they cooked the fritters, and after they had eaten, the
husband said, "Now let us go to work, both of us, and the one who speaks
first shall carry back the pan." Then she began to spin, and he to draw
his thread--for he was a shoemaker--and all the time keeping silence,
except that when he drew his thread he said, "Leulerò! leulerò!" and
she, spinning, answered, "Picicì! picicì! piciciò!" And they said not
another word. Now there happened to pass that way a soldier with a
horse, and he asked a woman if there was any shoemaker in that street.
She said there was one near by, and took him to the house. The, soldier
asked the shoemaker to come

<span id="p.116">p.116</span>

and cut his horse a girth, and he would pay him. The latter made no
answer but "Leulerò! leulerò!" and his wife "Picicì! picicì! piciciò!"
Then the soldier said, "Come and cut my horse a girth, or I will cut
your head off." The shoemaker only answered, "Leulerò! leulerò!" and his
wife "Picicì! picicì! piciciò!" Then the soldier began to grow angry,
and seized his sword, and said to the shoemaker, "Either come and cut my
horse a girth, or I will cut your head off." But to no purpose. The
shoemaker did not wish to be the first one to speak, and only replied,
"Leulerò! leulerò!" and his wife "Picicì! picicì! piciciò!" Then the
soldier got mad in good earnest, seized the shoemaker's head, and was
going to cut it off. When his wife saw that, she cried out, "Ah, don't,
for mercy's sake!" "Good!" exclaimed her husband, "good! Now you go and
carry the pan back to my godmother, and I will go and cut the horse's
girth."

In a Sicilian version the man and wife fry some fish, and then set about
their respective work--shoemaking and spinning--and the one who finishes
first the piece of work begun is to eat the fish. While they are singing
and whistling at their work, a friend comes along, who knocks at the
door, but receives no answer. Then he enters and speaks to

<span id="p.117">p.117</span>

them, but still no reply. Finally, in anger, he sits down at the table,
and eats up all the fish himself.\[1\]

Thus, it will be observed, the droll incident which forms the subject of
the old Scotch song of "The Barring of the Door" is of world-wide
celebrity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gothamite stories appear to have been familiar throughout Europe during
the later Middle Ages, if we may judge from a chapter of the *Gesta
Romanorum,* in which the monkish compiler has curiously "moralised" the
actions of three noodles:

We read in the "Lives of the Fathers that an angel showed to a certain
holy man three men labouring under a triple fatuity. The first made a
faggot of wood, and because it was too heavy for him to carry, he added
to it more wood, hoping by such means to make it light. The second drew
water with great labour from a very deep well with a sieve, which he
incessantly filled. The third carried a beam in his chariot, and,
wishing to enter his house, whereof the gate was so narrow and low that
it would not admit him, he violently whipped his horse until they both
fell together into a deep well.

\[1\] Crane's *Italian Popular Tales,* pp. 284-5.

<span id="p.118">p.118</span>

Having shown this to the holy man, the angel said, "What think you of
these three men?" "That they are fools;" answered he. "Understand,
however," returned the angel, "that they represent the sinners of this
world. The first describes that kind of men who from day to day do add
new sins to the old, because they cannot bear the weight of those which
they already have. The second man represents those who do good, but do
it sinfully, and therefore it is of no benefit. And the third person is
he who would enter the kingdom of heaven with all his world of vanities,
but is cast down into hell."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And now a few more Indian and other stories of the Gothamite class to
conclude the present section. In Málava there were two Brahman brothers,
and the wealth inherited from their father was left jointly between
them. And while they were dividing that wealth they quarrelled about one
having too little and the other having too much, and they made a teacher
learned in the Vedas arbitrator, and he said to them, "You must divide
everything your father left into two halves, so that you may not quarrel
about the inequality of the division." When the two fools heard this,
they divided every single

<span id="p.119">p.119</span>

thing into two equal parts--house, beds, in fact, all their property,
including their cattle. Henry Stephens (Henri Estienne), in the
Introduction to his Apology for Herodotus,\[1\] relates some very
amusing noodle-stories, such as of him who, burning his shins before the
fire, and not having wit enough to go back from it, sent for masons to
remove the chimney; of the fool who ate the doctor's prescription,
because he was told to "take it;" of another wittol who, having seen one
spit upon iron to try whether it was hot, did likewise with his
porridge; and, best of all, he tells of a fellow who was hit on the back
with a stone as he rode upon his mule, and cursed the animal for kicking
him. This last exquisite jest has its analogue in that of the Irishman
who was riding on an ass one fine day, when the beast, by kicking at the
flies that annoyed him, got one of its hind feet

\[1\] A separate work from the *Apologie pour Herodote.* Such was the
exasperation of the French clerics at the bitter truths set forth in it,
that the author had to flee the country. An English translation,
entitled "*A World of Wonders;* or, an Introdvction to a Treatise
tovching the Conformitie of Ancient and Modern Wonders; or, a
Preparative Treatise to the 'Apologie for Herodotus,'" etc., was
published at London in 1607, folio, and at Edinburgh 1608, also folio.
The *Apologie pour Herodote* was printed at the Hague.

<span id="p.120">p.120</span>

entangled in the stirrup, whereupon the rider dismounted, saying,
"Faith, if you're going to get up, it's time I was getting down."

The poet Ovid alludes to the story of Ino persuading the women of the
country to roast the wheat before it was sown, which may have come to
India through the Greeks, since we are told in the *Kathá Sarit Ságara*
of a foolish villager who one day roasted some sesame seeds, and finding
them nice to eat, he sowed a large quantity of roasted seeds, hoping
that similar ones would come up. The story also occurs in Coelho's
*Contes Portuguezes,* and is probably of Buddhistic origin. And an
analogous story is told of an Irishman who gave his hens hot water, in
order that they should lay boiled eggs!
