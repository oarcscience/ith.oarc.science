### CHAPTER II.

#### BIBLIOGRAPHY.

THE following list of variants of *The Grateful Dead* includes only such
tales as have the fundamental traits. as sketched above, either
expressed or clearly implied, Thus *Der gute Gerhard*, for example, is
not mentioned because it has only the motive of *The Ransomed Woman*,
while one of the folk-tales from Hungary is admitted because it follows
in general outline one of the combined types to be discussed later, even
though the burial of the dead is obscured. I cite by the short titles
which will be used to indicate the stories in the subsequent discussion.
The arrangement is roughly geographical.

#### TOBIT.

In the apocryphal book of *Tobit*. According to Neubauer, *The Book of
Tobit, a Chaldee Text from a unique MS. in the Bodleian Library*, 1878,
p. xv, *Tobit* was originally written in Hebrew, although the Hebrew
text preserved was taken from Chaldee. Neubauer (p. xvii) quotes Graetz,
*Geschichte der Juden*, (2nd ed.) iv. 466, as saying that the book was
written in the time of Hadrian, and he concludes that it cannot be
earlier because it was unknown to Josephus. The correspondence with *Sir
Amadas*, and thus with *The Grateful Dead* generally, seems to have been
first noted by Simrock, p. 131 f., again by Köhler, *Germania*, iii.
203, by Stephens, p. 7, by Hippe, p. 142, etc.

#### LOPE DE VEGA.

Comedy in two parts, *Don Juan de Castro*. According to J. R. Chorley,
*Catálogo de comedias y autos de Frey Félix de Vega Carpio*, p. 5, this
play is to be found in Part xix. of the *Comedias* published in 1623
(later issues 1624, 1625, and 1627). A. Schaeffer, *Geschichte des
spanischen Nationaldramas*, 1890, i. 141, says that the second part,
called *Las aventuras de don Juan de Alarcos*, is in Part xxv. of Lope's
comedies. The entire play is edited by Hartzenbusch, *Comedias Escogidas
de Lope de Vega*, iv. 373 ff. and 395 ff. in the *Biblioteca de autores
españoles*, lii. Schaeffer, pp. 141, 142, gives a careful summary of the
play, and Köhler, *Or. und Occ.* iii. too f., gives another. The latter
is followed by Hippe, p. 151. Mentioned by Duran, *Romancero general*,
ii. 299, by Sepp, p. 686, and by Wilhelmi, pp. 45 ff. and 60.

briefly after him by Hippe, p. 151. Mentioned by Sepp, p. 686, and by
Wilhelmi, pp. 60 f. Schaeffer, *work cited*, ii. 283 f., says that a
play of this name was written by Belmonte alone in 1610, which was
revised about 1627 with the aid of Rojas and Calderon.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

#### TRANCOSO. <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25)

*Contos e historias de proveito e exemplo*, by Gonçalo Fernandez
Trancoso, Parte 2, Cont. ii., first published in 1575 and frequently
re-issued during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the edition
published at Lisbon in 1693, our tale is found on pp. 45r.-60r.; and in
that published at the same place in 1710, on pp. 110-177. Menéndez y
Pelayo, *Orígenes de la Novela* (*Nueva Biblioteca de autores españoles*
vii.), 1907, ii. lxxxvii ff., gives a bibliography, the table of
contents, and a description of the work on the basis of seventeenth
century editions; on p. xcv. he connects the tale above-mentioned with
*The Grateful Dead*. See T. Braga, *Contos tradicionaes do povo
portuguez*, 1883, ii. 63-128, who prints nineteen of the tales in
abbreviated form, but not ours.

#### NICHOLAS.

Johannes Junior (Gobius), *Scala Celi*, 1480, under Elemosina. Gobius
was born in the south of France and lived about the middle of the
fourteenth century. <span id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26) Summary by
Simrock, pp. 106-109. Mentioned by Hippe, p. 169.

#### RICHARS.

*Richars li Biaus*, ed. W. Foerster, 1874. A romance written in Picardy
or eastwards in the thirteenth century (Foerster, p. xxi). Analyzed by
Köhler, *Revue critique*, 1868, pp. 412 ff., and Hippe, p. 155. Compared
in detail with *Lion de Bourges* by Wilhelmi, pp. 46 ff.

#### LION DE BOURGES.

An Old French romance known to exist in two manuscripts, the earlier
dating from the fourteenth century, <span id="fr_27"></span>[3](#fn_27)
the later from

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

about the end of the fifteenth. <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28) It
has never been edited, but the portion which concerns us was analyzed in
detail by Wilhelmi, pp. 18-38. This summary I have made the basis of my
discussion. The romance was mentioned by P. Paris, Foerster, and Suchier
(as cited in note below), Gautier, *Les épopées françaises*, 1st ed.
1865, i. 471-493, Ebert, *Jahrbuch f. rom. und engl. Lit.* iv. 53, 54,
and Benfey, *Pantschatantra*, i. 220. A prose translation into German is
found in manuscripts of the fifteenth century, which does not differ
materially from the original. <span id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29) This
was printed in 1514, and summarized by F. H. von der Hagen,
*Gesammtabenteuer*, 1850, i. xcvii-xcix, Simrock, pp. 104-106, and
Hippe, p. 154. See E. Müller, *Überlieferung des Herpin von Burges*,
1905, who analyzes the work and treats its relations to Lion.

#### OLIVER.

*Olivier de Castille et Artus d’Algarbe*, a French prose romance
composed before 1472, according to Foulché-Delbosc (*Revue hispanique*,
ix. 592). The first and second editions were printed at Geneva, the
first in 1482, the second before 1492. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30) There exist at least three manuscripts of
the work from the fifteenth century: MS. Bibl. nat. fran. 12574 (which
attributes the romance to a David Aubert, according to Gröber,
*Grundriss der rom. Phil.* ii. 1, 1145); MS. Brussels 3861; and Univ. of
Ghent, MS. 470. The designs of the last have been reproduced, together
with a summary of the text, by Heins and Bergmans, *Olivier de
Castille*, 1896. An English translation was printed by Wynkyn de Worde
in 1518. A translation from the second French edition into Castilian was
made by Philippe Camus, which was printed thirteen times between 1499
and 1845. <span id="fr_31"></span>[4](#fn_31) The edition of 1499 has
lately been reproduced in facsimile by A. M. Huntington, *La historia de
los nobles caualleros Oliueros de castilla y artus dalgarbe*, 1902. A
German translation from the French was made by Wilhelm Ziely in 1521,
and this was translated into English by Leighton and Barrett, The
History of Oliver and Arthur, 1903. From the

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> German prose Hans
Sachs took the material for his comedy on the theme (publ. 1556). A
summary of Ziely's work is given by Frölicher, *Thüring von
Ringoltingen's* "*Melusine*," *Wilhelm Ziely's* "*Olivier und Artus*"
und "*Valentin und Orsus*," 1889, pp. 65 f., which is used by Wilhelmi,
pp. 55, 56, in his comparison of the romance with *Richars* and *Lion de
Bourges*. An Italian translation, presumably from the French, was
printed three or four times from 1552 to 1622. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32) A summary of the story is given in
*Mélanges tirés d’une grande bibliothèque*, by E. V. 1780, pp. 78 ff.,
with an incorrect note about the romance, reproduced by Hippe, pp. 155
f., with an analysis from the same source of the part of the tale
belonging to our cycle. Robert Laneham in his list of ballads and
romances, made in 1575, mentions *Olyuer of the Castl*. See Furnivall,
Captain Cox, his *Ballads and Books*, Ballad Soc. 1871, vii. xxxvii and
30.

#### JEAN DE CALAIS.

I. Mme. Angélique de Gomez, *Histoire de Jean de Calais*, 1723. Sketched
in the *Bibliothèque universelle des romans*, Dec. 1776, pp. 134 ff.
Köhler, *Germania*, iii. 204 ff., gives a summary of the work, which Mme
de Gomez stated was "tiré d’un livre qui a pour titre: *Histoire
fabuleuse de la Maison des Rois de Portugal*." A later anonymous
redaction of this *Jean de Calais* exists in prints of 1970, 1776, and
1787, and it continued to be issued in the nineteenth century.
Summarized by Hippe, pp. 156 f., and by Sepp, pp. 685 f. Mentioned by
Köhler in Gonzenbach, *Sicil. Märchen*, ii. 250.

II\. Bladé, *Contes populaires de la Gascogne*, 1886, ii. 67-90. This
and the following folk-versions of Jean deserve careful consideration
because of the interesting character of their variations.

III\. J. B. Andrews, *Folk-Lore Record*, iii. 48 ff., from Mentone. See
Liebrecht, *Engl. Stud.* v. 158, and Hippe, p. 157.

IV\. and V. J. B. Andrews, *Contes ligures, traditions de la Rivière*,
1892, pp. 111-116, no. 26, and pp. 187-192, no. 41. These two versions
differ slightly from one another, but more from the preceding.

#### WALEWEIN.

*Roman van Walewein*, ed. Jonckbloet, 1846. Analyzed by G. Paris, *Hist.
litt. de la France*, xxx. 82-84, and by W. P. Ker, *The Roman van
Walewein* (*Gawain*) in *Folk-Lore*, V. 121-127 (1894). My analysis is a
combination made from these two summaries.

#### LOTHARINGIAN.

Cosquin, *Contes populaires de Lorraine*, 1886, i. 208-212 (no. xix).
Noted by Hippe, p. 157.

#### GASCONIAN.

bien qui rira le dernier." Summarized by Köhler, *Or. und Occ.* ii. 329.
Mentioned by Hippe, p. 157, and by Groome, *Folk-Lore*, ix. 239.

#### DIANESE.

*Novella di Messer Dianese e di Messer Gigliotto*, ed. d’Ancona and
Sforza, 1868. Analyzed by Liebrecht, *Heid. Jahrbücher der Lit.* lxi.
450 (1868), by d’Ancona, *Romania*, iii. 191, (reprinted in his *Studj
di critica e storia*, 1880, p. 353), and by Hippe, p. 152. D’Ancona's
summary is from Papanti, nov. xxi. The variant is of the fourteenth
century, according to the writer of the introduction of the edition of
1868, p. 5. See also Foerster, *Richars li Biaus*, p. xxiv, and
Wilhelmi, pp. 44 and 57.

#### STELLANTE COSTANTINA.

D’Ancona, Romania, iii. 192, mentions the popular poem *Istoria
bellissima di Stellante Costantina figliuola del gran turco, la quale fu
rubata da certi cristiani che teneva in torte suo padre e fu venduta* 

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

*a un mercante di Vicenza presso Salerno, con molti intervalli e
successi, composta da Giovanni Orazio Brunetto*. I have not been able to
find this poem and do not know how closely it accords with *Dianese*.

#### STRAPAROLA I.

*Notti piacevoli*, notte xi, favola 2. Analyzed by Grimm, *Kinder- und
Hausmärchen*, 1856, iii. 289; and rather too briefly by Simrock, pp.
98-100, and Hippe, p. 153. See Benfey, *Pant.* i. 221, Köhler in
Gonzenbach, *Sicil. Märchen*, ii. 249, and Groome, *Tobit and Jack*,
*Folk-Lore*, ix. 226 f., and *Gypsy Folk-Tales*, p. 3, note.

in two manuscripts of the fifteenth

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

century, must accordingly have been composed as early as the second half
of the preceding century. It contains 778 verses in the tail-rhyme

#### JACK THE GIANT KILLER.

Found without essential difference in several chapbooks, the earliest
owned by the British Museum being entitled: *The Second Part of* \|
*Jack and the Giants*. \| *Giving a full Account of his victorious
Conquests over* \| *the North Country Giants; destroying the inchanted*
\| *Castle kept by Galligantus; dispersed the fiery Grif-* \| *fins; put
the Conjuror to Flight; and released not* \| *only many Knights and
Ladies, but likewise a Duke's* \| *Daughter, to whom he was honourably
married*. Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1711. <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34)
Other editions with the story are: *The History of Jack and the Giants*,
Aldermary Churchyard, London; same title, Bow Church Yard, London; same
title, Cowgate, Edinburgh; *The Pleasant and delightful History of Jack
and the Giants*, Nottingham, Printed for the Running Stationers, and
*The Wonderful History of Jack the Giant-Killer*, Manchester, Printed by
A. Swindells; all without date. The Newcastle edition was reprinted by
Halliwell-Phillipps in *Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales*, 1849, in
which our tale appears at pp. 67-77. Apparently the British Museum copy
dated 1711 is that owned by Halliwell-Phillipps. From his edition it has
been reprinted by Groome, *Folk-Lore*, ix. 237 f., and summarized by
Köhler, *Or. und Occ.* ii. 327 f., and Sepp, p. 685. See also Stephens,
p. 8. Hippe, p. 164, and Wilhelmi, p. 45.

#### FACTORS’ GARLAND. <span id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35)

*The Factor's Garland* or *The Turkey Factor*, a tale in English verse,
which may be regarded as a popular ballad, though by no

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

means as a primitive one. It has often been reprinted as a chapbook or
broadside. The library of Harvard University possesses copies of no less
than eight different editions (see W. C. Lane, *Catalogue of English and
American Chap-Books and Broadside Ballads in Harvard College Library*,
1905, nos. 809-815, 2420). An examination of these shows that they
differ from each other in no essential point, though they vary
considerably in statements of time. The British Museum Catalogue of
Printed Books lists seven editions, all different from those at Harvard,
with one possible exception. The popularity of the story, at one time at
least, is thus strikingly illustrated. Another variant, reported from
oral tradition, has been found in North Carolina. See the paper read by
J. B, .Henneman before the Modern Language Association of America on
Dec. 29, 1906.

#### OLD WIVES' TALE.

George Peele, *The Old Wives’ Tale* (1590), published in 1595, Ed. by
Dyce, 1828 and 1861, by Bullen, 1888, and by Gummere in Gayley's
*Representative English Comedies*, 1903, pp. 349-382. See H. Dutz for an
elaborate discussion of the connection of the play with our theme.

#### FATAL DOWRY.

printed in 1632. Ed. A. Symons, Mermaid Series, 1889, ii. 87-182.

Esq.*, 1720, vol. i.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[10:1](gd04.htm#fr_20) I have to thank the
kindness of Professor Leo Wiener for my knowledge of the content of
*Russian V.* and *VI*., which he was good enough to translate for me
from the dialect of White Russia.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[11:1](gd04.htm#fr_21) What the two Bohemian

<span id="fn_23"></span>[11:3](gd04.htm#fr_23) Hippe's first Lithuanian
tale is a variant of *The Water of Life* and will be treated in another
connection.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[13:1](gd04.htm#fr_24) Hippe speaks of "zwei
spanische Romanzen." Had he consulted the Spanish text or read Köhler's
note more attentively, he would have seen that a single story runs
through nos. 1291 and 1292 of the *Romancero*.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[14:1](gd04.htm#fr_25) My attention was called

of Professor G. T. Northup.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[14:2](gd04.htm#fr_26) See Crane, *Exempla of

xxvii, date it from the fifteenth century; Suchier, *Oeuvres poétiques
de Philippe de Beaumanoir*, 1884, p. lxxxiv, and Wilhelmi, p. 15, from
the fourteenth century.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[15:1](gd04.htm#fr_28) P. Paris, *place cited*,

<span id="fn_33"></span>[19:1](gd04.htm#fr_33) My attention was first
called to this story by the kindness of Professor A. C. L. Brown.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[24:1](gd04.htm#fr_34) An edition with an almost
identical title "Printed and sold by Larkin How, in Petticoat Lane," of
which a copy is in the Harvard College Library, does not contain our
story.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[24:2](gd04.htm#fr_35) My attention was called
to this variant by the kindness of Professor Kittredge.
