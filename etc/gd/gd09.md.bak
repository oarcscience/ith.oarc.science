### CHAPTER VII.

#### THE RELATIONS OF *THE GRATEFUL DEAD* TO THE *SPENDTHRIFT KNIGHT*, *THE TWO FRIENDS*, AND *THE THANKFUL BEASTS*.

WE have met at various points in our study with tales. in which the
motive of the hero's fateful journey was his impoverishment through
extravagance; we have seen that many variants make the division of a
child part of the agreement between the ghost and the hero; and we have
noted the appearance of the ghost in the form of a beast in a large
number of instances. The bearing of these phenomena we shall do well to
investigate before proceeding to general conclusions. Occurring as they
do in versions which have been assigned on other accounts to different
categories, are they of sufficient importance to disturb the
classification already proposed? Furthermore, what cause can be found
for their introduction? Are they in reality sporadic, or are they the
result of some determinable factor in the history of the cycle?

Eleven variants, namely, *Richars*, *Oliver*, *Lope de Vega*, *Dianese*,
*Old Swedish*, *Icelandic I.*, *Icelandic II.*, *Rittertriuwe*, *Treu
Heinrich*, and *Sir Amadas*, have more or less clearly expressed the
motive of a knight who has exhausted his patrimony and goes out to
recruit his fortunes by winning a princess in a tourney. The figure of
such a knight or adventurer is not an uncommon one in the fiction of
Europe, and scarcely requires illustration.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Of the variants
just named all except *Oliver*, *Lope de Vega*, and *Old Swedish*
actually state that the hero sets out from home on account of his
poverty. In the two former the motive of the incestuous stepmother is
introduced in place of this, and in *Old Swedish* the trait is obscured
without any substitution, implying that the hero is led merely by
ambition to undertake the tourney. On the other hand, the tourney occurs
in all save *Icelandic I.* and *II.*, which are the only folk-tales in
the list. The second of these, moreover, makes the hero a merchant
instead of a knight; but since the two come from the same island and are
in other respects rather similar, <span id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_212.md)
this is perhaps not very significant.

Looking at the matter from another point of view, we find that
*Richars*, *Lion de Bourges*, *Dianese*, *Old Swedish*, *Rittertriuwe*,
and *Sir Amadas* form a group by themselves, <span
id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_213.md) and are uncompounded with any one of the
themes with which *The Grateful Dead* is most frequently allied. Oliver
and Lope de Vega are treated under the compound with *The Ransomed
Woman*, where on account of the rescue of the hero by the ghost they
probably belong; <span id="fr_214"></span>[3](#fn_214.md) and *Icelandic
I.* and *II.* are clearly of that type. *Treu Heinrich* <span
id="fr_215"></span>[4](#fn_215.md) shows the combination of the central
theme with *The Water of Life*, and can in the nature of the case have
no direct connection with the other romance stories under consideration,
even though it belongs to a class in which *The Ransomed Woman*
sometimes appears. <span id="fr_216"></span>[5](#fn_216.md) In view of
these discrepancies of position with reference to compounds which are
clearly established, we are certainly not justified in assuming that
*The Spendthrift Knight* has had anything more than a superficial
relationship to *The Grateful Dead*. To make it a basis of
classification or to attach any

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

considerable weight to its appearance here and there would be contrary
to the only safe method of procedure, which is to follow the evidence of
events in sequence rather than isolated traits. The very fact that none
of the compounds with *The Poison Maiden* contains any such motive as
this of the knight and the tourney shows that it must be comparatively
late and really an interloper in the family.

As to the way by which it entered the cycle, one must conclude that it
was afloat in Europe before the thirteenth century, <span
id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_217.md) and furnished a very natural opening for
a tale in which a youth goes into the world to seek adventure or profit.
Were a lady to be won by the help of the ghost, it would magnify the
hero's part, if he were given an opportunity to take some very direct
share in the wooing. So in the group of which *Richars* and *Sir Amadas*
are members the new theme supplied the means of winning a lady, which
would otherwise be lacking. In *Oliver* and *Lope de Vega* it has
perhaps supplanted the ransom of a maiden, which is the trait to be
expected, if they are rightly placed among the variants of the type *The
Grateful Dead* + *The Ransomed Woman*. It will be noted that in the two
Icelandic tales, which conform closely to the type, the tourney does not
appear. There seems to be reason, therefore, for supposing that the new
material touched our central theme at least twice, combining with the
prototype of the *Amadas* group and of the Icelandic folk-stories. The
authors of *Oliver* and *Treu Heinrich* may have adopted it consciously,
and so these variants should be left out of account.

Before leaving the matter, however, it must be noted that in *Tobit* the
hero leaves home on account of the poverty of his father to seek the
help of a relative. The ever-recurring possibility of a recollection of
*Tobit* 

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

on the part of the European story-tellers <span
id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_218.md) should not be forgotten. To argue that
the suggestion of adapting *The Spendthrift Knight* was due to a
conscious or unconscious recollection of the Apocrypha would be laying
too much stress upon what can at best be nothing more than conjecture,
but there can be no harm in the surmise that such may have been the
case.

The matter of the division of his child or children by the hero to
fulfil the bargain made with his helper must next be discussed. This
occurs in twenty-five of the variants which we have considered, namely:
*Lithuanian II.*, *Transylvanian*, *Lope de Vega*, *Oliver*, *Jean de
Calais I.-X.*, *Basque II.*, *Gaelic*, *Irish I.*, *Breton I.*, *III.*,
and *VII.*, *Simrock I.*, *II.*, and *VIII.*, *Sir Amadas*, and
*Factor's Garland*. With reference to one group where the trait
appears <span id="fr_219"></span>[2](#fn_219.md) I have already spoken at
some length of *The Two Friends*, and I have referred to the
introduction of the children as they have appeared in scattered
variants. I now wish to call the reader's attention to the general
aspects of the question. What relation has the use of this trait in
versions of *The Grateful Dead* to the theme which I call *The Two
Friends*?

It must first be noted that the motive as it appears in *Amis and
Amiloun* requires <span id="fr_220"></span>[3](#fn_220.md) that the hero
slay his children for the healing of his foster-brother and sworn
friend. Now of the twenty-five variants of *The Grateful Dead* just
named only Oliver and Lope de Vega have this factor,—the others merely
state that the helper asked the hero to fulfil his bargain by giving up
his only child, <span id="fr_221"></span>[4](#fn_221.md) or giving up one
of his two children, <span id="fr_222"></span>[5](#fn_222.md) or dividing
his only child, <span id="fr_223"></span>[6](#fn_223.md) or dividing his
three children. <span id="fr_224"></span>[7](#fn_224.md)

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The query at once
suggests itself as to whether the simple division of the child or
children as part of the hero's possessions gave rise to the introduction
of the whole theme of *The Two Friends* in *Oliver* and *Lope de Vega*,
or whether the twenty-two folk-tales have merely an echo of the theme as
there found. To put the question is almost equivalent to answering it.
One sees at once that the former is the case. *Lope de Vega* derives
directly from *Oliver*, <span id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_225.md) and to the
author of that romance must be due the combination of the two themes
there presented. Reference to the earlier discussion of the
variant <span id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_226.md) will show that he was a
conscious adapter of his material.

Yet it by no means follows that the suggestion for the combination was
not present in the version of *The Grateful Dead*, which was used in
making Oliver. Indeed, it seems probable that this source or prototype
had the division of the child in somewhat the form in which it appears
in so many tales. That such was the case is likely from the fact that of
the twenty-two folk variants which refer to the child all but two are of
the type *The Grateful Dead* + *The Ransomed Woman*, to which Oliver is
approximated. Considering the alterations which the theme was likely to
suffer at the hands of a writer who was more or less consciously
combining various material in a romance, the wonder is that the type was
not more changed than it seems to have been. In point of fact, the
position of *Oliver* and its literary successors as examples of the
compound comes out more clearly <span id="fr_227"></span>[3](#fn_227.md)
through this examination of their relationship to *The Two Friends*.

As to the introduction of the child, the trait by means of which,
according to my theory, the actual combination of motives came about,
the two folk-tales of the type *The Grateful Dead* + *The Poison Maiden*
as well as *Sir* 

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Amadas*, are of
great importance. Since the great majority of the variants which have
the child belong clearly to the compound type with *The Ransomed Woman*,
it is only by reference to these three that one can say with assurance
that the modified trait indicates no vital connection with *The Two
Friends*. Yet with these in mind there can be little doubt about the
matter. The story-tellers have simply extended the division of the
hero's possessions from property and wife to child, a process perhaps
made easier by the existence of such stories as *The Child Vowed to the
Devil* <span id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_228.md) and some forms of the
*Souhaits Saint Martin*. <span id="fr_229"></span>[2](#fn_229.md) This
might have happened to any particular variant with equal facility. At
the same time, the fact that the change was made in only three cases
outside the group, which has *The Ransomed Woman* in combination, gives
that family additional solidarity.

In *Oliver*, *Lope de Vega*, and *Sir Amadas* the motive of *The
Spendthrift Knight* appears together with the change or combination just
referred to. At first sight, it might appear that there was some
essential connection between these two elements foreign to the main
theme. Such does not seem to be the case, however, when the matter is
further considered. At any rate, I am unable to discover any such link,
and am inclined to ascribe the simultaneous appearance of these two
factors to chance pure and simple. Neither one is more than a rather
late and comparatively unimportant phenomenon as far as *The Grateful
Dead* is concerned.

Not infrequently in the course of this study attention has been called
to the substitution of a beast for the helping friend of the hero, and
in a few cases to the transference of the ghost's entire rôle to an
animal. While considering matters of greater importance, it

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

seemed best to ignore this in order to avoid unnecessary confusion. The
matter is of considerable importance,. however, and must here be
considered. The question that concerns us is whether the appearance of
the beast is of any real moment in the development of the theme.

It is sufficiently clear that the well-known stories of grateful animals
and ungrateful men, which were first traced by Benfey, <span
id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_230.md) have general outlines different from
that of *The Grateful Dead*. Benfey's contention, however, that "konnte
der Gedanke von der Dankbarkeit der Thiere schon tief genug auch im
Occident einwurzeln, um auch in andere Märchen einzudringen and
vielleicht selbst sich in Bildung von verwandten zur Anschauung zu
bringen" <span id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_231.md) should be kept in mind.
This statement is truer than his later remark <span
id="fr_232"></span>[3](#fn_232.md) that fairies and other superhuman
creations of fancy are substituted for animals, instancing our theme as
such a case. To argue relationship from the entrance of either helpful
beasts, fairies, or ghosts would be dangerous unless the stories in
question had the same motive, since they are so frequently found in
folk-literature. Indeed, as I have already remarked, <span
id="fr_233"></span>[4](#fn_233.md) one is scarcely called upon to explain
the intrusion of thankful or helpful animals at any given point, in view
of the fact that the device is almost universally known. Yet if it does
not require justification, it may well be of service in the grouping of
particular variants.

It is certainly worthy of notice that in eighteen forms of *The Grateful
Dead* a beast appears. That these are of several different compound
types would show, if it were not clear from what has been said above,
that the appearance of an animal furnishes of itself no evidence of any
actual amalgamation of narrative themes. It is rather a case where one
stock figure of imagination's realm is substituted for another. The
better-known character is perhaps more likely to replace the less-known

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

than *vice versa*, but the latter event may happen if the obscurer
figure will serve to enliven the tale.

Of the twenty variants in our cycle which have a thankful beast,
*Jewish* has the simple theme; *Servian IV.* the combination with *The
Poison Maiden*; *Jean de Calais II.*, *VII.*, and *X.*, *Simrock II.*,
*III.*, *V.*, and *VIII.*, and *Oldenburgian* the combination with *The
Ransomed Woman*; and *Walewein*, *Lotharingian*, *Tuscan*, *Brazilian*,
*Basque I.*, *Breton IV.*, *V.*, and *VI.*, and *Simrock IX.* the
combination with *The Water of Life*.

Now in Jewish <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_234.md) the hero is saved
from shipwreck <span id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_235.md) by a stone, carried
home by an eagle, and there met by a white-clad man, who explains the
earlier appearances. This is mere reinforcement of the tale by
triplication, and implies nothing more than a certain vigour of
imagination on the part of the story-teller. In *Servian IV.*, <span
id="fr_236"></span>[3](#fn_236.md) where the hero spares a fish which he
has caught, there appears, on the contrary, to be actual combination
with *The Thankful Beasts* as a motive. The fish comes on the scene in
human form, and fulfils the part of the grateful dead till the very end,
when it leaps back into its element. As for the variants of the compound
type with *The Ransomed Woman* there is considerable diversity, yet all
of them have merely substitution, not combination. So in *Jean de Calais
II.*, *VII.* and *X.*, <span id="fr_237"></span>[4](#fn_237.md) which are
closely allied with other members of the group so named, the beast
appears, but in one case as a white bird, in the second as a fox, and in
the third as a crow. That this is anything more than a substitution due
to the story-teller's individuality cannot be admitted, though knowledge
of *The Thankful Beasts* as a motive is not barred out. *Simrock II.*
and *VIII.* <span id="fr_238"></span>[5](#fn_238.md) are likewise nearly
related to one another and to *Jean de* 

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Calais*, and they
have the same adventitious substitution. *Simrock V.* and *Oldenburgian*
are a similar pair, <span id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_239.md) while *Simrock
III.*, <span id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_240.md) which is otherwise allied
to *Bohemian*, cannot be shown to have any vital connection with *The
Thankful Beasts* as a motive. Of all these tales it can be said that
they show some influence from such a theme without actual combination.
Finally, all the variants of the type *The Grateful Dead* + *The Water
of Life*, which have the animal substituted, <span
id="fr_241"></span>[3](#fn_241.md) belong to a well-defined and centralized
group <span id="fr_242"></span>[4](#fn_242.md) which has had independent
existence for centuries. Here the entrance of the beast is of
considerable importance to the classification and development of the
theme.

Of the part which *The Thankful Beasts* as a motive has played in
connection with *The Grateful Dead* it must be said that, on the whole,
it has been of very secondary importance. It illustrates, as do *The
Spendthrift Knight* and *The Two Friends*, how one current theme may
touch and even influence another at several different points without
becoming embodied with it. This trait or that may be absorbed as the
motives meet, yet the two waves may go their way without mingling.
