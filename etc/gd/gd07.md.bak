### CHAPTER V.

#### THE GRATEFUL DEAD AND THE RANSOMED WOMAN.

As has already been shown, <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103.md) Simrock
regarded as an essential feature of *The Grateful Dead* the release of a
maiden from captivity by the hero. Stephens and Hippe <span
id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_104.md) saw that such was not the case. The
latter's treatment of the matter <span id="fr_105"></span>[3](#fn_105.md)
leaves little to be desired as far as it goes, save that it implies a
derivation of the compound *The Grateful Dead* + *The Ransomed Woman*
from the compound treated in the last chapter—a view which I believe
erroneous.

*The Ransomed Woman* appears as a separate tale or in combination with
other themes than *The Grateful Dead* more than once. A prolonged study
of the motive would probably yield a rich harvest of examples, though it
is sufficient for the present purpose to refer to Hippe's article as
establishing the existence of the form. His Wendish folk-tale <span
id="fr_106"></span>[4](#fn_106.md) and *Guter Gerhard*, from the latter of
which Simrock started his enquiry, are of themselves evidence
enough. <span id="fr_107"></span>[5](#fn_107.md) Neither example has
anything whatever to do with *The Grateful Dead*. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[6](#fn_108.md) The characteristics

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

of *The Ransomed Woman* will appear as we consider the compound type,
which contains folk-tales almost exclusively, as was the case with the
type studied in the previous chapter, but in most cases from Western
Europe instead of from both Asia and Europe.

Nineteen variants have *The Grateful Dead* and *The Ransomed Woman*
combined in a comparatively simple form without admixture with related
themes. These are: *Servian I.*, *Lithuanian I.*, <span
id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md) *Hungarian II.*, *Transylvanian*,
*Catalan*, *Spanish*, *Trancoso*, *Nicholas*, *Gasconian*, *Straparola
I.*, *Istrian*, *Gaelic*, *Breton III.*, <span
id="fr_110"></span>[2](#fn_110.md) *Swedish*, *Norwegian I.*, *Icelandic
I.* and *II.*, and *Simrock IV.* and *VI.*

In *Servian I.* a merchant's son, while on a journey, ransoms a company
of slaves whom he finds in the hands of freebooters. Among them is a
beautiful maiden with her nurse. He marries the lady, who proves to be
the daughter of an emperor. On a second voyage he ransoms two peasants,
who have been imprisoned for not paying their taxes to the emperor. On
his third journey he comes to his father-in-law's court, and is sent
back for his wife. He is, however, cast into the sea by a former lover
of the princess, and succeeds in getting ashore on a lonely island,
where he remains for fifteen days and fifteen nights. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[3](#fn_111.md) Then an angel in the disguise of an old
man appears to him, and, on condition of receiving half of his
possessions, brings him to court, where he is

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

reunited with his wife. After renouncing his claim, the old man explains
who he is, and disappears.

The most striking peculiarity of the variant is the loss of the burial,
for which appears rather awkwardly the ransoming of some peasants on the
hero's second voyage. That substitution has occurred is apparent,
however, both from the clumsiness of the device by which the original
trait is replaced, and from the angel in the form of an old man, who
takes the rôle of the ghost. It will be remembered that the same
substitution has already been met with in the case of *Tobit* and
*Russian II.*

In *Lithuanian I.* is found a variant which, as we shall find, is of a
common type. A king's son pays three hundred gold-pieces, all that he
possesses, to release a dead man from his creditors and have him buried.
The hero then becomes a merchant, and finds a princess on an island,
whither she has been driven by a storm. He takes her to a city, where he
makes his home, and marries her. A messenger, sent out by her father to
seek her, arrives, takes them aboard ship, and pitches the hero into the
sea in order to obtain the offered reward. He is saved by a man in a
boat, who says that he is the ghost of the dead, and instructs him how
to rejoin his bride. So everything ends happily.

The events as here related follow a very normal course, which is
repeated again and again in stories of this type: a burial, a ransom, an
act of treachery, a rescue by the ghost, and a happy reunion of the
lovers. The agreement between the hero and the ghost, which is found in
*Servian I.*, and very frequently elsewhere, is lacking, however. A
peculiarity of the variant is the change in status of the hero. He is a
prince, but becomes a merchant, thus uniting the two characters given
him in the other tales of this class.

*Hungarian II.* is in some respects more interesting than the variant
just cited. A merchant's son while in

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Turkey pays the
debts and for the burial of a mistreated corpse. After returning home,
he goes to England and rescues a French princess with her two maids, but
by his cunning saves the gold that he has agreed to pay for them. At her
bidding he goes to Paris and tells the king that she is safe. On his
return to bring her to her home, where he is to marry her, he is placed
on a desert island by a general who is enamoured of the princess. Thence
he is rescued by an old man, the ghost of the dead, who takes him to the
Continent. He goes to Paris, where he is recognised by the princess,
when he drops a ring that she has given him into a beaker. When she
comes to him in his room, he threatens to kill her if she does not go
away; but when she agrees that he has the right to do so since he has
saved her life, he says that his threat was only a test of loyalty. So
the story ends happily.

The course of events is not very different from that of *Lithuanian I.*,
since the variant has all the normal elements save the agreement between
the ghost and the hero. A peculiarity is the final scene in which the
hero tests his lady. It will be evident, I think, that this is an
obscured and modified form of the test to which the ghost elsewhere
submits the hero, a test of fidelity likewise, though different in its
nature.

In the *Transylvanian* variant, a merchant's son while on a journey pays
fifty florins, half of his capital, for the burial of a dead man. On a
second journey he pays one hundred florins, again one-half of his store,
for the ransom of a princess who has been imprisoned while out doing
charity *incognito*. She gives him a ring and sends him to the castle,
where her father turns him out of doors. He then meets an old man —the
ghost—and promises him one-half of his gains after seven years for his
help. He is then enabled to marry the princess, who recognizes him at
the castle by his ring. They

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

have two children. When the old man comes back at the end of seven
years, the hero gives up one of his children, and, after offering her
whole, is ready to divide his wife. The old man renounces his claim, and
disappears.

Every step in the narrative is here clearly marked, even to the
conditional agreement with the ghost, which so frequently is wanting.
The variant thus appears to be entirely normal as far as *The Grateful
Dead* goes, though it does not have the rescue by the ghost—an important
feature of *The Ransomed Woman*.

In *Catalan* <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) a young man on a
journey has a poor man buried at his expense, and ransoms a princess.
Later he goes to the court of her parents with a flag on which she has
embroidered her name. They recognise this, and send the youth back for
the lady. On the way he is cast into the sea by the sailors, but is
saved by the thankful dead and brought to the court again, where he
espouses the princess.

In *Spanish* <span id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_113.md) a young Venetian
merchant pays the debts of a Christian at Tunis, and has him buried. At
the house of the creditor he also buys a Christian slave girl. He takes
her back to Venice and marries her. At the wedding a sea-captain
recognizes the lady, and lures the couple aboard his ship. The young man
is cast into the sea, but by clinging to a plank reaches land, where he
lives seven months with a hermit. At the end of that time he is sent to
the coast, where he finds a ship, and is transported to Ireland. There
he is entrusted by the captain with two letters to the king. The one
says that he is a great physician, who will heal the sick princess; the
other that the plank, the hermit, and the captain who has brought him to
Ireland are one and all the ghost of the man whom he buried. The hero is
recognized at court by the princess, who has

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

been brought thither by the traitor, and has explained all to her
father.

In these tales the theme of *The Grateful Dead* is somewhat abbreviated
for the sake of the romantic features of the secondary motive. In both,
the agreement with the ghost and every trace of a division have
disappeared, though they differ in the details of the treachery by which
the lovers are separated. In the former <span
id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md) much is made of the manner by which the
hero gets a favourable reception at the court of the princess's father,
while in the latter this is suppressed. Recognition by some such means,
it will appear, is an important feature of the majority of the variants
in this section. It must be remembered, of course, that *Spanish* is a
semi-literary version, even though popular in origin.

*Trancoso*, the work of a sixteenth century Portuguese story-teller, is
even more consciously literary. It shows, besides, the tendency of the
narrative to take on a religious colouring. The son of a Lusitanian
merchant, while in Fez on a trading expedition, buys the relics of a
Christian saint. In spite of his father's anger, he does this a second
time, and is so successful in retailing the bones that he is sent out a
third time with instructions to buy as many relics as possible. On this
expedition, however, he succeeds merely in ransoming a Christian girl,
whom he takes home. At her request he carries to the King of England a
piece of linen, on which she has embroidered the story of her
adventures. He learns that she is the king's daughter, and restores her
to her father. Subsequently he wanders over Europe in despair, for he
has hoped to marry the princess, till he meets with two minstrels, who
accompany him to the English court. There he makes himself known to the
princess

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

by a song; and, by the aid of the two minstrels, he wins her hand in a
tournament. Later the two friends reveal themselves as the saints whose
bones he had rescued from the Moors.

Though this version clearly belongs in the category now under
discussion, it has certain features that can be explained only on the
supposition that Trancoso altered his source to suit his personal fancy.
The clever substitute for actual burial, the duplication of that trait
(which occurs nowhere else), the humorous touch with reference to the
hero's success in selling relics, and the appearance of the ghosts as
minstrels, are all strokes of individual invention. The wanderings of
the hero and his manner of revealing himself to the princess are
doubtless reminiscences from the popular romances of Spain, while the
tournament probably comes, as Menendez y Pelayo hints, <span
id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md) from an earlier version of our theme,
*Oliver*, which will be treated below. In spite of these peculiarities,
the ordinary features of the combined theme are not more obscured than
in the two preceding variants. The agreement, the division, and the
rescue are the only ones that disappear.

In the fourteenth century variant from *Scala Celi*, *Nicholas*, our
story is altogether transformed into a legend. The only son of a
widow <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_116.md) of Bordeaux is sent as a
merchant to a distant city with fifty pounds. He gives it all to help
rebuild a church of St. Nicholas, and returns home empty-handed. Much
later he is sent out with one hundred pounds, and buys the Sultan's
daughter. His mother disowns him, and he is supported by the embroidery
which the princess makes. With her wares he goes to a festival at
Alexandria, but, at her bidding, keeps away from the castle. When he
journeys to

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Alexandria a
second time, however, he goes to the castle and is imprisoned, as the
handiwork of the princess is recognized. She is sent for, while the hero
is released and goes home. Since he does not find the maiden there, he
returns to Alexandria with a piece of embroidery which she has sent him,
meets her, and elopes by the aid of St. Nicholas, who sends them a ship
opportunely.

Because of its legendary character the variant has been materially
transformed, but not beyond recognition. The thankful dead is replaced
by the saint throughout, so that the burial is altered into church
building, and both the agreement and the division of the gains
disappear. The various elements of *The Ransomed Woman* fare better: the
act of treachery done the hero is the only one lacking, and that perhaps
is replaced by his imprisonment in the Sultan's castle. It is remarkable
that the details of the narrative have been so little altered in spite
of its complete change of purpose.

In the *Gasconian* folk-tale Jean du Boucau, the son of a mariner, goes
to fight the corsairs. On the shore of the sea he rescues a man named
Uartia, who is pretending death to escape from his creditors. Later this
man becomes a prosperous freebooter, and is sailing with a load of
captives when met again by Jean. The latter is so shocked by his evil
deeds that he encloses him in the coffin prepared for him on the
previous occasion, and throws him into the sea. Jean then marries the
most beautiful of the captives, who is the daughter of the King of
Bilbao.

The variant is excessively rationalized, it will be observed, and most
traces of *The Grateful Dead* have disappeared. Though various
substitutions for the burial are found in each of the groups, this is
the only case that I know where the man plays ’possum to escape his
creditors. The story is likewise unique in making the hero take
vengeance on the man whom he has helped

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

earlier, and accordingly in making him rescue the maiden from the hands
of the person who is in the character of the thankful dead. The variant
has been modified by a free fancy; yet its position in the group remains
perfectly clear in spite of the loss of such traits as the agreement,
the act of treachery, the rescue of the hero, and the division of the
gains.

*Straparola I.*, one of the Italian novelist's two renderings of our
theme, is far more normal than the above, and is probably based directly
on a folk-story. Bertuccio pays one hundred ducats to free a corpse from
a robber and bury it, greatly to his mother's disgust. He goes out again
with two hundred ducats, and pays them for the ransom of the daughter of
the King of Navarre. His mother is still more angry. The princess is
taken home to Navarre by officers of the court who have been searching
for her, but first she tells Bertuccio to come to her, and to hold his
hand to his head as a sign when he hears that she is to be married. On
his way to Navarre he meets a knight who gives him a horse and clothing
on condition of his returning them, together with half of his gains. He
marries the princess, and is returning home, when he meets the knight
again and offers to give up his wife whole rather than kill her by
division. Whereupon the knight explains that he is the spirit of the
dead, and resigns his claim.

All the traits previously mentioned are here evident save the act of
treachery by which the hero comes near losing his bride. The sign
appears as a means of communication between the lovers, as in
*Transylvanian* and elsewhere. The question of division is simply a
matter of fulfilling a bargain, but it shows how easily by a slight
shift of emphasis the test of loyalty could be made the important
element.

None of the Italian folk variants, which I know, conforms to the above
closely enough to be regarded as a

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

near relative. *Istrian*, however, belongs in the same category. A youth
called Fair Brow sets out to trade with six thousand *scudi*, which he
pays to bury a debtor on the shore, for whom passers-by are giving alms.
On his return home, he tells his father that he has been robbed, and
again is sent out with six thousand *scudi*. He pays these for a maiden,
who has been stolen from the Sultan, and he is consequently disowned by
his father. After his marriage to the girl, the young couple live by the
sale of the wife's paintings. Some sailors of the Sultan see these, and
carry the lady off home. Fair Brow goes fishing with an old man whom he
meets by the sea. They are driven by a storm to Turkey, and are sold to
the Sultan as slaves, but they escape with the wife and considerable
treasure. The old man then asks for a division of the property, even of
the woman. When the hero offers him three-quarters of the wealth in
order to keep the woman, the old man declares that he is the ghost, and
disappears.

All of the essential traits, except the preliminary agreement and the
rescue of the hero, are here clearly marked. The latter is, indeed,
probably accounted for by the storm which the hero and the ghost
encounter together. The fact that the young couple live by the sale of
the wife's handiwork, and that this in some way or other leads to her
restoration to her parents or earlier connections, is an important
feature of *The Ransomed Woman*, being found clearly in the Wendish tale
as well as in many variants of the compound type.

*Gaelic* is an interesting example of the theme. Iain, the son of a
Barra widow, becomes the master of a ship and goes to Turkey, where he
pays the debts of a dead Christian and buries the corpse. He ransoms a
Christian maiden, the daughter of the King of Spain, with her servant,
on the same journey, and takes her back to England, together with much
gold. At her advice he

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

goes to Spain and attends church, where the king recognizes by his
clothing, his ring, his book, and his whistle that he has news of the
lost princess. Iain then returns to England for the maiden, whom he is
to marry. While going with her to Spain he is left on a desert island by
a general, who has secreted himself on the ship; but after a time he is
rescued by a man in a boat, to whom he promises half of his wife and of
his children, if he shall have any. In Spain the princess, who has gone
mad, recognizes him when he plays his whistle. So they are married, and
the general burned. When three sons have been born, the rescuer appears
and asks for his share; but as soon as Iain accedes he declares himself
to be the ghost, and disappears.

Apart from the dressing of the story, which is unusually good, the
variant follows the normal course. The several signs by which the hero
is recognized by the king and the princess mark the imaginative wealth
of the Celt, though the appearance of a ring, and the fact that the hero
is left on a desert island by an infatuated general, show a close
correspondence with *Hungarian II.* The introduction of the children as
part of the property to be divided is interesting, since it shows the
connecting link by which the simple compound now under consideration
passed into combination with the theme of *The Two Friends*. <span
id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md) *Gaelic*, however, clearly belongs where
it is here placed. The healing of the princess at the hero's coming
reminds one of the similar trait in *Spanish*.

*Breton III.* <span id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_118.md) is peculiar in
several ways. A young man, who had been unjustly cast off by his
parents, put himself under the protection of St. Corentin and the
Virgin. To an old woman he gave all his stock of money that she might
bury her husband and have

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

masses said for his soul. The saint and the Virgin then led the hero to
a nobleman, whose daughter he married. On a hunt he was cast into the
sea by an envious uncle of his wife, at a time when she was pregnant;
but he was brought to an island by some mysterious power and nourished
there for five years by St. Corentin. Finally an old man appeared and
took him home after he had promised half of his possessions to the
rescuer. When a year had passed, the old man came back and demanded half
of the child; but just as the mysterious stranger was about to divide
the child St. Corentin and the Virgin appeared and explained their
identity, together with that of the old man, who was the saint himself.
They told the hero, furthermore, that God was well pleased with him, and
would take his son and himself to Paradise. Father and son fell dead
immediately, while the wife went into a convent.

This tale, like *Nicholas*, has been dressed up as a legend, chiefly in
the praise of St. Corentin, with the result that the elements are
confused. The burial, however, persists, though the ransoming of the
woman has been feebly replaced by the aid of the saint and the Virgin.
The hero is cast into the sea by an avaricious uncle of the bride, again
a weakened trait. The rescue and the agreement to divide are normal in
essentials, though adorned with superfluous miracles, as is again the
conclusion of the tale. It illustrates how easily such a narrative may
be adapted, whether consciously or not, to a religious purpose. The
division of the child, which comes in question, is of precisely the same
character as in *Gaelic;* it does not imply the presence of a new
motive, though it indicates the possibility of a new combination.

*Swedish* <span id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119.md) is a somewhat
abbreviated form of the normal type. Pelle Båtsman, while on a journey,
pays

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

the debts of a dead man, and so brings repose to him; for he has been
hunted from his grave and soundly beaten every night by his creditors,
who are likewise dead. Pelle then falls in with robbers, with whom he
finds the daughter of the King of Armenia. He escapes with her, and goes
on board a ship to seek her father, but he is thrown overboard by the
envious captain. He is saved by the thankful dead and brought to
Armenia, where he marries the princess. Here the burial is peculiar in
that the dead man is harassed by creditors who are already dead. This is
a marvel, which need excite no surprise in view of the modifications of
the trait found elsewhere. The ransom in this case does not imply a
money payment, since the hero escapes from robbers with the maiden. The
way in which the hero is left behind by the master of the vessel on
which the lovers sail is a trait similar to the one in *Catalan* and
*Spanish*. The agreement between the hero and the ghost, the sign
employed by the hero, and the division of gains are all lacking; but no
new feature replaces them.

*Norwegian I.* <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md) is not very
different from the preceding tale. A man in the service of a merchant
pays all he has, while on one voyage, to bury the body of a dead man. On
his next voyage he ransoms a princess, and sets out with her for
England. On the way she is carried off by her brother and a former
suitor. The hero overtakes them and is given a ring by the lady, but is
cast into the sea by the suitor. For seven years he lives on a desert
isle, till an old man appears, tells him that it is the princess's
bridal day, carries him to England, and gives him a flask. This the hero
sends to his lady, is thus recognized, and is married. The agreement
with the ghost and the division of the woman are entirely lacking,
though the burial, the ransom, the treachery of the suitor, and the aid
of

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

the ghost [appear](errata.htm#1.md) in normal fashion. The sign enters only
as a means of communication between the lovers. The tale thus has no
very unusual traits.

*Icelandic I.* <span id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121.md) is a fuller, and,
for our purpose, more interesting variant than the last. Thorsteinn, a
king's son, who has wasted his substance, sells his kingdom and sets
forth into the world. He pays two hundred rix-dollars to free from debt
a dead man, whose grave is beaten every day by a creditor to destroy his
rest. The prince goes on, and in the castle of a giant finds a princess
hanging by the hair. He frees her, and is taking her home when he meets
Raudr, a knight to whom her hand has been promised if he can find her.
Raudr puts the prince to sea alone in a boat and carries the lady home.
Thorsteinn, however, is brought thither also by the ghost and is
recognized by the princess, when she is about to be married to the
traitor. So Raudr is punished, and Thorsteinn obtains the princess.

Here, again, the agreement, the sign, and the division do not appear,
though the version is otherwise normal. To be sure, the ransom of the
lady is replaced by a rescue, as in *Swedish*, and the beating of the
grave preserves a bit of northern superstition, which is interesting
even though not primitive as far as our tale is concerned. <span
id="fr_122"></span>[2](#fn_122.md)

*Icelandic II.* is similar to the variant just cited in several
particulars, though it has important differences. Vilhjálmur, a
merchant's son, loses his property and becomes the servant of twelve
robbers. In their den he finds a princess named Ása hanging by the hair.
He escapes with her by sea, taking along the thieves’ treasure. This he
pays to have the body of a debtor buried. To

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

the haven where this happens comes Rauður in search of the princess,
takes the couple on his ship, but puts the hero to sea in a rudderless
boat. A man appears to Vilhjálmur in a dream, saying that he is the
ghost of the man whom he has buried, and that he will bring him to land
and show him treasure. So the hero is brought to the land of the
princess and tells his story at the wedding of the traitor with the
princess. Thus the bride is won for him.

The hero, it will be observed, is a merchant instead of a prince, as in
*Icelandic I.*, and the burial of the dead is customary in form though
exceptionally placed in the narrative. Otherwise the two variants
correspond rather closely, even in such a detail as the name of the
traitor. There is the same omission of elements peculiar to *The
Grateful Dead*, the same preponderance of the secondary motive, found in
all the northern versions of this particular group. The two Icelandic
variants seem to be perfectly distinct, though they are nearly related.

The two German folk-tales which fall into this group are not very
different from one another. In *Simrock IV.* a merchant's son pays the
debts of a man who is being devoured by dogs, but does not succeed in
saving his life. He goes on, finds two maidens exposed on a rock, and
takes them home. In spite of his father's objections, he marries one of
them. He goes to sea again, wearing a ring that his wife has given him,
and carrying a flag marked with her name. Coming to the royal court of
her father, he is sent back for the princess with a minister. On his
voyage to court again he is put overboard by the minister, who hopes
thus to win the princess. However, he is cast up on an island, where the
ghost of the dead man appears to him in sleep and transports him
miraculously to court. There he is recognized by his ring and reunited
to his wife.

Details such as those concerning the burial, the rescue

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

of the lady, and the help given miraculously by the ghost mark the
independence of the variant, though they do not alter the normal course
of the narrative. As so often in this group, the agreement with the
ghost and the division are entirely lacking.

In *Simrock VI.* the variations from the normal are even slighter.
Heinrich of Hamburg buys a beautiful maiden in a foreign land. On the
sea-coast, when he is returning home with her, he pays the debts of a
corpse and has it buried. He wishes to marry the girl, but she asks that
he delay the wedding for a year and make a journey first. So she gives
him two coffers, with which he crosses the sea. By the help of a shipman
he finds his betrothed's royal father, but on his way back to fetch her
home is cast overboard by the mariner, who is the original kidnapper of
the maiden. This man gets her and carries her to the court with the hope
of marrying her. The hero is saved from the sea, however, by the ghost
of the dead man, who brings him to the garden of the princess's palace,
where he is found by his bride.

The order of the burial and the ransoming <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md) is here reversed, but the facts are
given in the ordinary form. Otherwise the variant does not differ
essentially from the preceding.

In *Transylvanian*, <span id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md) and more
clearly in *Gaelic* and *Breton III.*, <span
id="fr_125"></span>[3](#fn_125.md) a tendency has been remarked to
introduce the children of the hero as part of the gains which he is
asked to divide with the thankful ghost. In a series of tales belonging
to the general type *The Grateful Dead* + *The Ransomed Woman* this
tendency has been accentuated so far that it seems best to group them
together, because of their approach to the theme of *The Two Friends*.
Since an actual combination of this motive

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

with *The Grateful Dead* in its simple form is found in only three
variants, all of them literary, it will perhaps be best to discuss the
relationship of the main to the minor theme at this point.

*The Two Friends* is the chief motive of *Amis and Amiloun*, which in
its various forms <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126.md) is the mediaeval
epic of ideal friendship. Its essential feature, as far as the present
study is concerned, is the sacrifice of his two sons by Amis to cure the
leprosy of Amiloun. They are actually slain, but are miraculously
brought to life again by the power of God. This story, which exercised a
powerful influence on the imagination of European peoples, easily became
connected with the sacrifice of his wife by the hero of *The Grateful
Dead*.

The three variants with the simple compound, or forming a group on that
basis, are those entered in the bibliography as *Lope de Vega*,
*Calderon*, and *Oliver*.

The plot of *Oliver* runs as follows <span
id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_127.md): Oliver, the son of the King of
Castille, becomes the close friend of Arthur of Algarbe, the son of his
stepmother. When he has grown up, he flees from home because of the love
which the queen declares for him, leaving to Arthur a vial in which the
water would grow dark, were he to come into danger. He is shipwrecked
while on his way to Constantinople, but, together with another knight,
is saved miraculously by a stag, which carries them to England. Talbot,
the other knight, is ill, and asks Oliver to take him to his home at
Canterbury, where he dies. Because of debts that his parents will not
pay he cannot be buried in consecrated ground till Oliver himself

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

attends to the matter. The hero then starts for a tourney where the hand
of the king's daughter is the prize. On the way he loses his horse and
money, but is supplied anew by a mysterious knight, on condition of
receiving half of what he gets at the tourney. Here he is victor, and
after a further successful war in Ireland marries the princess, who
bears him two children. While hunting he is taken prisoner by the King
of Ireland and placed in a dungeon. Arthur, who is acting as regent in
Spain, notices that the vial has grown dark, and sets out to rescue his
brother. In Ireland he is wounded by a dragon, but is healed by a white
knight, who notices his resemblance to Oliver, and takes him to London
to solace the princess. He only escapes her embraces by the pretence of
a vow, and sets forth to deliver Oliver. On their way back he tells of
his visit at London, and so excites Oliver's jealousy, who leaves him.
At home, however, Oliver discovers his mistake, and determines to find
his brother, who, after a punitive expedition into Ireland, falls
gravely ill. Oliver learns in a dream that Arthur can only be cured by
the blood of his children, whom he slays accordingly. On his return
home, however, he finds them as well as ever. Later appears the
mysterious knight to demand his share of wife and children, as well as
of all his property. As Oliver raises his sword to divide his wife, he
is told to desist, since his loyalty is proved. The knight then explains
that he is the ghost of Talbot. Later Arthur marries Oliver's daughter,
and eventually unites the kingdoms of England, Castille, and Algarbe.

*Oliver* has certain elements not to be accounted for by the combination
of *The Two Friends* with *The Grateful Dead*. Such are the motive of
the hero's journey, for example, which allies it with the tales of
incestuous step-mothers; and the tourney in which the hero wins his
bride. Yet the burial of the dead man

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (here a knight and
a friend of the hero's) <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_128.md)
corresponds to the normal form of the episode in that Oliver pays the
creditors and the sum necessary for the man's interment. So, too, the
demand made by the ghost for half of all that has been won runs true to
the original form. The distinctive trait of *Amis and Amiloun*, at the
same time, comes out more clearly than in the case of such folk-tales as
Gaelic—the hero actually kills his little children to save the life of
his old friend and foster-brother. One factor leads me to think that the
romance and the two romantic plays are to be regarded as forms of the
general type treated in this chapter, with additions from other stories.
The ghost rescues the hero from imprisonment. A rescue of the
sort—normally after the hero has been cast into the sea or left behind
by his rival—is characteristic of *The Grateful Dead* + *The Ransomed
Woman*. In Oliver this rescue takes place, to be sure, after the
marriage instead of before, which is the normal order, yet it is a
factor of considerable importance. The romance takes a position somewhat
apart; and even though this is partly due to the literary handling which
it has undergone, it must remain doubtfully classed with the immediate
circle of variants belonging to the compound type.

The position of the play by *Lope de Vega* is involved with that of
*Oliver*. Don Juan de Castro flees to England because of the unlawful
love of his stepmother, the Princess of Galicia. His ship is wrecked on
the English coast, and the captain, Tibaldo, is cast ashore in a dying
condition. To free the latter's mind from unrest, Don Juan pays his
debts of two thousand ducats, though this is half of the hero's
possessions. He hears that the princess Clarinda is promised to anyone
of princely blood who wins an approaching tournament. While he

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

is sorrowful that he cannot enter the contest, because of his poverty,
the ghost of Tibaldo appears to him one night and promises the necessary
equipment on condition of receiving one-half the gains. The next morning
he finds everything ready and wins the princess. He is later taken
prisoner by one of the contestants through a ruse, and is carried off to
Ireland. By the ghost's advice, his stepbrother and double comes to
London and takes his place, while Don Juan is freed by force of arms and
restored to his wife. After some years, when the couple have two
children, the stepbrother falls ill of a dreadful malady, which can only
be cured, Don Juan learns in a dream, by the blood of his children. So
he slays them and gives their blood to the sick man to drink. They are
found alive by a miracle; but Don Juan is troubled, and does not find
rest till the ghost appears and tells him that the only remedy for his
affliction is to fulfil his promise of a division. The hero prepares to
divide his wife, when the ghost stops him and explains that the demand
was only a test.

As Schaeffer pointed out, <span id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md) Lope's
plot is clearly taken from Oliver, probably from the Spanish translation
issued in 1499. Indeed, the drama follows the romance with far more
fidelity than could have been expected of such an adaptation. The
various elements of the motive appear without essential alteration.

The play *El mejor amigo el muerto*, listed for convenience as
*Calderon*, has suffered, in contrast to Lope's play, from many changes.
Prince Robert of Ireland and Don Juan de Castro are wrecked on the
English coast. The former finds the sea-captain Lidoro in a dying
condition, and refuses to give him aid. Don Juan, on the other hand,
finds Lidoro's body, which a creditor keeps from interment, and pays for
his burial out of his scanty savings from the wreck. He then goes to
London,

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

where there is trouble because Queen Clarinda will not marry Prince
Robert. Don Juan is cast into prison on a false charge, his identity
being unknown to the queen, though he is recognized by Robert. He is
saved by the aid of Lidoro's ghost, nevertheless, lays siege for
Clarinda's hand, overcomes Robert, and so becomes king of England.

The correspondence of names and details makes it clear that the source
of this play is *Lope de Vega*, though the plot has been modified in
several features. In the process of adaptation all trace of *The Two
Friends* has dropped out, a fact which would make the position of the
variant difficult to ascertain, had the authors not left most of the
characters their original names. The change in the position of the
rescue of the hero from prison, indeed, gives a specious resemblance to
the normal type *The Grateful Dead* + *The Ransomed Woman*, which is
quite unjustified by the real state of the case.

All the other variants in which there is question of dividing a child,
save one, <span id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_130.md) are folk-tales; and all
of them save three <span id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131.md) clearly belong
in the category now under discussion. If they did not group themselves
in this way, I should be unwilling even to consider the possibility of
any general influence from *The Two Friends* upon these tales, since the
only trait borrowed by any of them is precisely the division. Only in
*Oliver* and *Lope de Vega* is this sacrifice made for the healing of a
friend; and we have seen in the case of *Transylvanian*, *Gaelic*, and
*Breton III.* how naturally the division of the child grows out of the
division of the wife. As the matter stands, however, the case for the
influence of *The Two Friends* is sufficiently strong to warrant the
grouping of these tales together. The general

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

relationship of the theme may be deferred to a later chapter. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_132.md)

*Lithuanian II.* <span id="fr_133"></span>[2](#fn_133.md) is a
characteristic specimen of the class of tales just referred to. A
prince, while travelling, sees a corpse gnawed by swine in a street. He
pays the man's creditors for his release and has the body buried. Later,
on the same journey, he buys two maidens, one of whom is a king's
daughter, and takes them home. After a year he goes on a second journey
with the princess's picture for a figure-head on his ship, and a ring,
which she has given him. The picture is recognized by the maiden's
father, and the prince is sent back in the company of certain nobles to
fetch her. While they are returning to her home with the princess, one
of the nobles pushes the prince overboard. He lives on an island for two
years, until a man comes to him and promises to bring him to court
before the princess marries the traitor, on condition of receiving his
first-born son. The agreement is made, and the prince wins his bride.
After a son has been born to them, the man appears and demands the
child. He is put off for fifteen years, and at the end of that time
explains that he is the ghost of the rescued dead man.

All the traits of the compound type, as it has already been analyzed,
are here apparent, save that the sacrifice of the child is substituted
for that of the wife. The variant does not demand any further comment.

We come now to the various forms of *Jean de Calais*, which make up a
little group by themselves. The ten examples of the story that I have
been able to find differ from one another sufficiently to make separate
analyses of most of them necessary.

The version by Mme. de Gomez (*I.*) runs as follows: <span
id="fr_134"></span>[3](#fn_134.md) Jean, the son of a rich merchant at
Calais, while on a journey, comes to the city of Palmanie on the island
of

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Orimanie. There he
pays the debts and secures the burial of a corpse which is being
devoured by dogs. He also ransoms two slave girls, one of whom he
marries and takes home. The woman is the daughter of the King of
Portugal. While taking her to her father's court, Jean is separated from
her by a treacherous general, but is saved by the grateful dead, and
enabled to rejoin his wife. Later the ghost, who appears in the form of
a man, demands half of their son according to the agreement of division
which they have made. When Jean gives him the child to divide, the
stranger praises his loyalty and disappears.

This story has all the characteristics of the type *The Grateful Dead* +
*The Ransomed Woman* + the demand that the hero's son be divided. In
general outline it is scarcely distinguishable from *Lithuanian II.*,
save that the hero Jean is a merchant's son instead of a prince. In
details, however, it differs considerably. For example, Jean marries one
of the captive maidens as soon as he buys her; there is no question of
signs by which the hero is recognized by his wife's father or by the
princess herself; and the ghost is less dilatory in his demands. Some of
these differences are doubtless to be accounted for through the
unfaithfulness of the rendering, which is semi-literary.

At all events, *Jean de Calais III.*, *IV.*, and *V.*, all three of
which were heard on the Riviera, have several changes from I., though
they vary from one another only in very minor matters. <span
id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_135.md) A single analysis will suffice for the
three. Jean de Calais, the son of a merchant, on his first voyage gives
all his profits to bury the corpse of a deceased debtor. On his second
he ransoms a beautiful woman (with or without a companion),

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

and lives with her in poverty because of his father's displeasure. On a
subsequent voyage he bears her portrait on the prow of the ship, where
it is seen by her father. A former suitor meets him on his return to
court with his wife (in *III.* goes with him) and throws him into the
sea either by violence or by a ruse. He is cast up on an island (in
*III.* is carried thither in a boat by the ghost in human form), whence
he is conveyed by the ghost, on condition of receiving half of his first
son, or half of what he loves best, to the court just as the princess is
to marry the traitor. By a ruse he enters the palace and is recognized.
Later the ghost appears, but stays Jean when he is about to sacrifice
his son.

*Jean de Calais VI.*, though from Brittany instead of southern France,
does not differ greatly from the above, nor from *I.* Jean buries the
dead man and ransoms two women on a single voyage, as in *I.* He is
kindly received at home in spite of his extravagance, in which the
variant differs from *III.*, *IV.*, and *V.*, and he marries one of the
maidens there. On his next voyage the King of Portugal (as in *I.* and
*III.*) recognizes his daughter's portrait and that of her maid, which
the hero has displayed on his ship. He brings his wife to the court,
after which they go back, together with a former suitor, for their
possessions. On the voyage Jean is thrown overboard, but is washed up on
an island, whither the ghost comes, announces himself immediately, and
bargains rescue for half of the hero's child. Jean is transported to
court miraculously, and there meets with the customary adventures at the
close of the tale.

The variant is chiefly peculiar, it will be remarked, in placing the
treachery of the former suitor after the marriage has been recognized by
the king, and in making the ghost announce himself at once. Jean makes
no blind bargain, a fact which detracts somewhat from the interest.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

*Jean de Calais II.* and *VII.* differ from the other forms of the story
in several ways. In the former <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136.md)
Jean is the son of a rich merchant, and has wasted much money. He is
sent out to seek his fortune on land with seven thousand pistoles, but
he pays his all for the debts and burial of a poor man. On his return,
he is commended by his father, but again falls into evil ways. Once more
he is sent forth with seven thousand pistoles, and passes the cemetery
where he buried the debtor. As he does so, a great white bird speaks
from the cross, saying that it is the soul of the dead man and will not
forget. Jean buys the two daughters of the King of Portugal from a
pirate and takes them home, where, with his complaisant father's
approval, he marries the elder. Later he journeys to Lisbon with the
portraits of the sisters, which are recognized by the king. <span
id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_137.md) He is sent back for his wife, but is
pushed overboard by a traitor, being driven on a rock in the sea, where
he is fed by the white bird. Meanwhile, the traitor goes to Calais and
remains there seven years as a suitor for the princess's hand. He is
about to be rewarded, when Jean, after promising half of what he loves
best to the white bird, is miraculously transported to Calais, whither
the King of Portugal comes at the same time. The white bird bears
witness to the hero's identity, and demands half of his child. When Jean
is about to divide the boy, however, it stops him and flies away.

Version *VII.* has certain characteristics in common with the above. It
is a Basque tale. Juan de Kalais, the son of a widow, sets off as a
merchant, but sells his cargo and ship to pay the debts of a corpse,
which is being dragged about on a dung-heap. On his return, his mother
is angry. Again he goes on a voyage, but

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

with a very poor ship, and is compelled by an English captain to ransom
a beautiful maiden with all his cargo. The hero's mother is again angry
at this seemingly bad bargain, but she does not forbid his marrying the
girl. Juan is now sent to Portugal by his wife with a portrait on a
flag, a handkerchief, and a ring. At the same time she tells him that
she has been called Marie Madeleine. When the King of Portugal sees the
portrait, he sends the hero back with a general to fetch Marie, who is
his daughter. The general pitches Juan overboard and goes for the
princess, whom he persuades to marry him after seven years. At the end
of that time, a fox comes to Juan on an island, where he has lived, and
bargains to rescue him for half of all he has at present and will have
later. The hero arrives in Portugal, is recognized by the king, tells
his story, and has the general burned. After a year the fox appears and
demands payment, but, when Juan is going to divide his child, it says
that it is the soul of the dead man whom he buried long before.

The two variants are chiefly peculiar in that they introduce a new
element into the compound,—*The Thankful Beast*. This substitution of
some beast for the ghost has been encountered twice before <span
id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_138.md) in connection with *Jewish* and *Servian
IV.*, and must receive special treatment later on. <span
id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_139.md) For the present it is sufficient to
remark the variation from all other forms of *Jean de Calais* except
*X.* <span id="fr_140"></span>[3](#fn_140.md) In both *II.* and *VII.* Jean
makes two journeys, <span id="fr_141"></span>[4](#fn_141.md) as in *III.*,
*IV.*, and *V.*, as against *I.* and *VI.* The attitude of the parent
differs widely in the two. The maiden whom the hero marries is a
Portuguese princess, which is the prevailing form of the tale. The

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

portrait is also found in each, and both state the time of Jean's exile
as seven years. *II.* differs from all the other versions in placing the
later adventures of the story at Calais rather than at the court of the
heroine's father. In *II.*, as in *VI.*, the ghost announces himself at
the first meeting, which is undoubtedly a modification of the original
story. Thus the two forms are sufficiently independent of one another,
in spite of their common use of an animal as the hero's friend.

*Jean de Calais VIII.*, though like *VI.* from a Breton source, differs
from all the other variants, chiefly in transposing the burial and the
ransom. Jean Carré, sent out by his godmother as a sea-captain, ransoms
an English princess with her maid, and marries the former. After two
years, when a son has been born to them, Jean goes on another voyage,
and adorns the stern of his vessel with portraits of his wife, the
child, and the maid, which he is begged to show while anchored at
London. He does so, and is received by the king as a son-in-law. One day
he sees a poor debtor's body dragged along the street, pays the debts,
and has it buried. He then sets out with a fleet to seek his wife, and
is cast overboard by a Jew, who is the pilot; but he is saved by a
supernatural man, who carries him to a green rock in the sea. The
princess refuses to go to England when the fleet arrives, and is wooed
by the Jew so persistently that after two years she promises him
marriage. At this juncture Jean, who has been asleep during the whole
interval, is awakened by his rescuer and carried over the sea, where the
man explains that he is the ghost of the debtor. Jean is first
recognized by his little son, the Jew is burned by the *gendarmes*, and
all ends well.

The transposition mentioned above is clearly a change due to the
individual narrator or some local predecessor, since everywhere else the
burial takes place before the

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

ransom. The mention of a Jew as traitor is also peculiar and
unreasonable, since no motive for his action appears until later, and
then incongruously. The variant is likewise defective in not having any
bargain between the ghost and the hero. In other respects it is normal
save in minor details. As in *V.*, the heroine is made an English
princess, which occurs nowhere else. On the whole the version is
picturesque, but defective.

*Jean de Calais IX.* is unique in certain features, though in most
respects normal. It is from Asturia in Spain. Juan de Calais goes out
into the world to seek his fortune with a single peseta as his store.
This he gives to bury a corpse, and proceeds. In a certain kingdom he
attracts the notice of a princess, who marries him after considerable
opposition. When the wedding is over, he takes his wife to seek his
father's blessing, but is cast off the ship by a former suitor of the
lady, her cousin. He is carried to an island by invisible hands, where
he lives until a phantom bargains to take him to court for half of what
he gets by his marriage. He arrives on the day of the princess's
wedding. He is recognized by the king, who puts to his guests a parable
of an old key found just when a new one has been made, while the suitor
flees. On the following night, when Juan is dejected at the thought of
giving up half his son, the phantom appears and releases him from his
agreement, explaining its identity.

Juan wins the gratitude of the dead man, and obtains his bride in this
version on a single journey, as in *I.* and *VI.*, but its chief
peculiarity is the manner in which he gets his wife, with the sequel
that the couple set out to seek his father instead of hers. The ransom
is replaced by a romantic but more natural wooing, while the ghost
appears somewhat unusually *in propria persona*. One of the oddest
traits in the whole version is the parable of the key, by which the king
introduces the

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

hero to the assembled guests. This will be encountered again in *Breton
VII.*

In *Jean de Calais X.*, finally, a Wallon variant, appear certain
interesting changes in the fabric. The King of Calais sent his son Jean
to America to trade, but the prince was shipwrecked on the coast of
Portugal, and there ransomed and rescued a corpse, which was being
dragged through the streets because the man had died in debt. The king
scolded his son for wasting so much money, but the next year sent him to
Portugal to trade. There he encountered brigands, who had captured the
king's daughter with her maid, and ransomed them. On returning to Calais
with his bride, he was ill received, and resolved to go back to
Portugal. A young lord of Calais accompanied them and threw Jean into
the sea, while he took the princess onward and obtained from her a
promise of marriage in a year. Happily Jean found a plank by which he
reached an island, where a crow fed him every day. At the end of a year
he promised the crow half his blood for rescue, and was taken to
Portugal by a flock of crows. There he was recognized, and the traitor
hanged. One day the crow appeared and demanded the fulfilment of the
promise. Jean was about to slay his son, when the bird explained its
identity with the ghost of the dead man.

This is the only version which makes Jean a prince; and it is curious
that the change should occur in a tale from a region not very remote
from Calais. Most of the events of the tale take place in Portugal,
however, which is an extension of the ordinary appearance of that
country as the home of the heroine. The most striking peculiarity of the
version is the home of the traitor, who is a lord of Calais instead of
Portugal. All mention of signs is lacking, which is doubtless due to the
changes just mentioned. In the matter of the appearance of the ghost as
an animal the variant allies itself with *II.* and

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *VII.*, though it
has no special likeness to them in other respects.

*Basque II.* is like *Gaelic* <span id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142.md) in
general outline. Juan Dekos is sent out with a ship to complete his
education. He pays all that he gets for his cargo to ransom and bury the
corpse of a debtor. His father is not pleased, but sends him out again.
This time he uses all his money to ransom eight slaves, seven of whom he
sends to their homes, but carries one home with him. His father is still
more angry, and casts him off; but Juan has a portrait of Marie Louise
painted for the figure-head of his ship, and sets off with her for her
own land. The lame mate pitches him overboard, and carries the lady to
her father's dwelling-place, where he is to marry her after a year and a
day. Juan is saved by an angel and placed on a rock. On Marie's
wedding-day the angel returns, and offers to take the hero to his bride
for half of the child that will be born. The angel was the soul of the
dead man. So Juan arrives in time, is recognized by a handkerchief, and
tells his story, which causes the burning of the mate. After a year the
angel comes for his half of the babe, but when Juan starts to divide it
stays his hand.

Webster, the collector of this tale, noticed <span
id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_143.md) its similarity to *Gaelic*, especially
in the name of the hero, and surmised that the Basques must have
borrowed it from the Celts in some way. The theory is tenable, though a
comparison of the two variants shows that the Basques must either have
borrowed it in a form considerably different from the Highland tale as
we have it, or have altered the details largely. The first part of the
story is entirely different; the hero goes on two voyages in *Basque
II.*, one only in *Gaelic*; the lady goes with the hero immediately in
the former, he returns for her in the latter; the treachery and the
signs are different; the

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

ghost appears as an angel instead of a human being in *Basque*; and the
promised division concerns the wife and three sons in *Gaelic*, a single
babe in *Basque*. Thus, apart from the title, there is little to
substantiate Webster's theory. The differences are certainly more
important than those between any two versions of *Jean de Calais*. In
some particulars, like the voyages and the portrait on the ship,
*Basque* is more nearly normal, while in others, like the account of the
treachery and the appearance of the ghost, *Gaelic* conforms to the
ordinary form. Certainly *Basque II.* is to be regarded as a fairly
close relative of *Lithuanian II.* and *Jean de Calais*.

In *Breton VII.* a normal form appears, though with some embroidery of
details. A merchant's son, Iouenn Kerménou, goes out with his father's
ship to trade. He pays the greater part of the proceeds of the cargo to
ransom and bury the corpse of a debtor, which dogs are devouring. On his
way home he gives the rest of his money to ransom a princess, who is
being carried to a ravaging serpent, which has to be fed with a royal
princess every seven years. He is cast off by his father when he reaches
home, but is supported by an aunt and enabled to marry his lady. After a
son has been born to them, he is sent out by an uncle on another ship,
which by his wife's counsel has the figure of himself and herself with
their child carved on the prow. He comes to her father's realm, and
after some misunderstanding is sent back with two ministers of state for
the princess. While returning with her, he is pushed overboard by the
first minister, who is an old suitor for the lady's hand, but swims
ashore on a desert island. The wife goes to court, and after three years
consents to marry the minister. All this time Iouenn lives alone on his
rock, but at the end is greeted by the ghost of the man whose body he
buried, which appears in a very

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

horrible form. On condition of giving in a year and a day half of what
he and his wife possess, he is taken to court by this being, where he is
recognized by means of a gold chain, which the princess had given him.
At the wedding feast, which takes place that day, the wife recounts a
parable of how she has found the old key of a coffer just as a new one
was ready, brings in Iouenn, and has the minister burned. At the end of
a year and a day comes the ghost, and demands half of the child (the
older one has died) that has been born to them. As the hero reluctantly
proceeds to divide the child, the ghost stops him, praises his fidelity,
and disappears.

It will be seen that this variant does not differ in essentials from
those previously summarized, though its details exactly coincide with
none of them. The order of events is normal, very like that of
*Lithuanian II.*, for example, yet it has marks of peculiarity. Chief
among these are the events connected with the ransom of the lady and the
parable by which she introduces her long lost husband to court. The
first is a trait borrowed from the *Perseus and Andromeda* motive, <span
id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_144.md) the second is the same as the riddle in
*Jean de Calais IX.* <span id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_145.md) How this
latter feature should happen to appear in these two widely separated
variants and nowhere else I am not wise enough to explain.

*Simrock I.* introduces still another complication in the way of
compounds. A merchant's son on a journey secures proper burial for a
black Turkish slave, thereby using all his money. His father is angry
with him on his return. On his second voyage he ransoms a maiden and is
cast off by his father when he reaches home. The young couple live for a
time on the proceeds from the sale of the wife's handiwork, but after a
little set off to the court of her father, who is a king. On the way

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

they meet one of the king's ships, and go aboard. The hero is cast into
the sea by the captain, but is saved by a black fellow and brought back
to the ship. Again he is cast overboard. When the princess arrives at
home, she agrees to marry whoever can paint three rooms to her liking.
The hero, meanwhile, is again saved by the black man, and in return for
the promise of his first child on its twelfth birthday he is given the
power of obtaining his wishes. After a year and a day he is taken to
court by his friend, where by wishing he paints the three rooms, the
third with the story of his life. So he is recognized. On the twelfth
birthday of his first child the black man comes to him and is offered
the boy, but instead of taking him explains his identity.

As far as *The Grateful Dead*, *The Ransomed Woman*, and the sacrifice
of the child are concerned, this follows the normal course of events,
except perhaps as to the child, of actually dividing which there is no
question. Like *Lithuanian II.*, *Jean de Calais III.*, *IV.*, *V.*, and
*X.*, *Basque II.*, and *Norwegian I.*, it makes the hero and heroine
set out for her father's court together and of their own free
will. <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146.md) The colour of the thankful
dead is a peculiar trait. Yet the element which complicates the
question, as mentioned above, is the feat by which the hero obtains his
wife. If I am not mistaken, this allies the variant on one side with
stories of the type of *The Water of Life*, where the bride is gained by
the performance of some task obviously set as impossible. The questions
involving the relations of such motives with *The Grateful Dead* will
occupy the next chapter, so that it needs simply to be mentioned at this
point.

In *Simrock II.* a miller's son goes with merchandise to England. In
London he pays all his money for the debts and the burial of a poor man.
He is again sent to England by his father, and this time he gives his

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

whole ship to ransom a beautiful maiden. When he returns with her, he is
cast off by his father, marries the girl, and lives on what she makes by
her needle. He takes a piece of her embroidery with him to England,
where it is seen by the king and queen, whose daughter has become his
wife. He is sent for her in company with a minister, who pitches him
overboard and goes on for the princess, hoping to marry her. The hero
swims ashore, in the meantime, and communicates with his wife by means
of a dove, which also feeds him. Finally a spirit conveys him to London,
after receiving the promise of half of his first child. He obtains work
in the kitchen of the castle, and sends a ring to his wife, by means of
which they are reunited. At the birth of their child he refuses to give
the spirit half, but offers the whole instead, <span
id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_147.md) whereupon ensues an explanation.

This variant is of the same type as *Jean de Calais II.* and
*VII.*, <span id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_148.md) resembling the latter more
than the former in details. The three are sufficiently unlike, however,
to make any immediate relationship quite out of the question, even did
not geography forbid. As in *Hungarian II.*, *Oliver*, *Lope de Vega*,
*Calderon*, *Jean de Calais V.* and *VIII.*, and *Norwegian I.*, the
heroine is an English princess, a point of interest, but not of much
importance.

*Simrock VIII.* differs from the above in only two points. The beginning
states that a merchant while in Turkey pays the debts and burial
expenses of a poor man. On his next voyage he buys three hundred slaves
from the Emperor of Constantinople. Three of them he keeps at his home,
one of whom he marries. The further adventures of the hero agree with
*Simrock II.* even in names and most details, except that the hero is

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

recognized at the court by dropping his ring in a cup of tea, which the
princess gives him to drink. It will be evident that the two tales are
nearly related.

Last, but not least interesting of the versions in which the child
appears, is the *Factor's Garland* or *Turkey Factor*, which must have
been almost as well known in England at one time as the form of the
story in *Jack the Giant-Killer*. It has no very remarkable features in
its outline. A young Englishman, while acting as a factor in Turkey,
pays fifty pounds to have the body of a Christian buried. A little later
he pays one hundred pounds to ransom a beautiful Christian slave, and
takes her back to his home, where he makes her his housekeeper. Later he
sets out again, and is told by the woman to wear a silk waistcoat that
she has embroidered, when he comes to the court whither he is bound. The
work is recognized by her father, the emperor, and the factor sent back
to fetch her. While returning with the princess, he is pushed overboard
in his sleep by the captain, but swims to an island, whence he is
rescued by an old man in a canoe, who bargains with him for his
first-born son when three (or thirty) months old. The hero is recognized
at court and marries the princess, while the captain dies by suicide. In
two (or three) years the old man returns, just when the couple's son is
three (or thirty) months old, and demands the child. On the hero's
yielding, he explains that he is the ghost, and disappears.

Like *Gaelic* <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_149.md) and *Simrock
VIII.*—the latter just discussed—this version makes the hero undergo his
early adventures in Turkey. Indeed, the similarity to *Gaelic*
throughout is very notable, far more so than in the case of *Basque
II.* <span id="fr_150"></span>[2](#fn_150.md) The only point in which it
differs materially is the division of property, which in *Gaelic*
concerns the wife and the three children, in the *Factor's* 

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Garland* one son
only. In this matter there is agreement between the present variant,
*Basque II.*, and *Simrock VIII.* Despite the likeness to *Gaelic*,
there is no good reason for arguing any immediate connection with that
version. They stand close to one another geographically and in content,
that is all; they cannot be proved to be more than near relatives in the
same generation.

The variants which introduce the division of the child have now all been
considered. It is necessary to turn to a few scattered specimens in
which the compound, *The Grateful Dead* + *The Ransomed Woman*, has been
joined with other material.

*Bohemian* is a curious and instructive example of the confusion which
has resulted from welding various themes together. Bolemir, a merchant's
son, is sent to sea, where he is robbed by pirates and imprisoned. He
finds means to help an old man, who gives him a magic flute, and a
princess, who gives him half of her veil and ring. By the aid of the
flute he succeeds in winning the chief's permission to leave the island
in the company of his friends. He sails with them to another island.
There, at the old man's request, he strikes him on the head and buries
him. He then goes home with the princess. On his second voyage he
displays from his mast-head a golden standard, which the princess has
made. He reaches the city of the lady's father, tells his story, and
returns for the princess with the chamberlain. While they are all
returning together, he is cast into the sea by the chamberlain, who
takes the woman to court and obtains a promise of marriage, when a
church has been built to her mind. Bolemir is saved from the sea by the
ghost of the old man, and is given a wishing ring. He turns himself into
an eagle and flies to court, into an old man and becomes a watchman at
the church. By means of his ring he builds the structure, and paints it
with the story of his life. At the wedding breakfast

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

of the princess, who cannot longer delay the bridal, he tells his story,
and so marries her.

The peculiar form of the burial in this variant will be at once evident,
though the reason for it is not clear to me. Disenchantment by
decapitation is a common phenomenon in folk-lore and romance; <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151.md) but though the blow on the head, which
the hero gives the old man in our tale, surely stands for beheading, it
is hard to see where any unspelling process comes in. It is perhaps best
to suppose the trait a confused borrowing, without much meaning as it
stands. The ransoming of the woman is closely connected with the
benefits done the old man. That it occurs on the same journey has been
shown by the variations in *Jean de Calais* to be a matter of little
consequence. With respect to the standard and the ring, by which the
hero restores his wife to her father, and later to himself, the tale is
perfectly in accord with the prevalent form of the compound type; and so
also in regard to the rescue of the hero by the ghost. No hint is given
of any agreement of division between the hero and the ghost. The chief
peculiarity of the variant, however, is the means by which the heroine
is won. The feat recalls *Simrock I.*, <span
id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152.md) even in details like the demand on the
part of the bride for mural decoration. It again shows the combination
of the present type with a theme akin to *The Water of Life*.

*Simrock III.* has several points of contact with the above. Karl, the
son of an English merchant, on his first voyage to Italy pays the debts
of a merchant who has died bankrupt. On his way home he buys two sisters
from some pirates at an inn. His father casts him off, so he marries the
older of the maidens, who tells him that she is a princess. They start
for Italy

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

together, and on the way meet an Italian prince, who is a suitor for the
wife's hand. The hero is cast overboard, but is brought to land by a
great bird, which tells him that it is the ghost of the man whom he has
buried. It directs him to go to court and give himself out as a painter.
The bird again comes to him there with a dagger in its beak, and tells
him to cut off its head. Unwillingly Karl obeys, and sees before him the
spirit of the dead man. The ghost paints the room in which they are
standing with the hero's history. So on the wedding-day of the princess
with the traitor, Karl explains the meaning of the pictures and wins his
bride again.

This Swabian story has preserved the decapitation <span
id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_153.md) in much better form than *Bohemian*,
though the reason for its introduction is still hard to understand. The
ghost is obviously released from some spell when it is beheaded, and is
thus enabled to help the hero to better advantage than before. The
episode also occurs in a more logical position than in *Bohemian*. It
replaces the more ordinary and normal test of the hero by the ghost.
Probably the introduction of it in the two cases is sporadic, though
some connection between the two is conceivable. As far as *The Grateful
Dead* and *The Ransomed Woman* proper are concerned, the variant has no
peculiarities of special importance, being of the type in which the hero
and heroine set out for court together. <span
id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_154.md) It contains, however, the feat by which
the bride is won, in the same form as in *Simrock I.* and *Bohemian*,
which is due to an alliance with the type of *The Water of Life*. Yet it
differs from them in making the ghost appear first as a bird, which
connects it with *Jean de Calais II.*, *VII.*, and *X.*, and with
*Simrock II.* and *VIII.*, variants that have the thankful beast playing
the rôle of ghost. <span id="fr_155"></span>[3](#fn_155.md)

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

*Simrock VII.*, together with some other peculiarities, again has the
feat of winning the bride, though it is a feat of another sort. Wilhelm
catches a swan-maiden, and later releases her from an enchanted mountain
by hewing trees, separating grain, and finding his wife among three
hundred women. Thus by her help he breaks the spell, and carries her
back home. Later they journey together to her father's court. On the way
Wilhelm pays the debts of a corpse, and has it buried. They meet two
officers of the king, who toss Wilhelm overboard from the ship in which
they sail, but he is saved by the ghost of the dead man and brought to
court. He is recognized by the princess, and proves his identity to her
father by means of a ring and a handkerchief.

The most salient point here is the fact that the maiden is not ransomed
at all, but instead is captured like any other swan-maiden. We have
already met with the theme of *The Swan-Maiden* in combination with *The
Grateful Dead* in simple form; <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_156.md) but
*Servian V.* has evidently nothing to do with *Simrock VII.*, since the
part played by the borrowed motive is different in each. In the former
it is introduced as the reward bestowed on the hero by the ghost, while
in the latter the swan-maiden simply replaces the ransomed maiden, as is
shown by the subsequent events of the story, which follow the normal
order as far as she is concerned. The feats by which the hero
disenchants her are essentially like those in *Bohemian*, *Simrock I.*,
and *Simrock III.*, though they are differently placed. Probably the
introduction of this new material accounts for the transposition of the
ransoming and the burial, as the latter is in other respects regular. It
is curious to observe that the process of changing about various
features, thus begun, continued in other ways, as in the matter of the
signs by which the hero is recognized by his father-in-law and his wife.
These

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

things go to show, however, that back of the variant must have existed
the compound type in a normal form.

In *Simrock V.* the thankful beast again appears, but in a less
complicated setting than in the case of *Jean de Calais II.*, *VII.*,
and *X.*, or *Simrock II.*, *III.*, and *VIII.* A widow's son on his way
home from market pays the debts of a corpse and buries it, thus using
all his money. The next time he goes to market, he gives all his
proceeds to ransom a maiden, whom he marries. She does embroidery to
gain money, and one day holds out a piece of it to the king, who is
passing. He recognizes her as his daughter, and accepts the hero as
son-in-law. The young couple start back home for the widow, but on the
way the servants cast the young man into the sea. He escapes, however,
to an island, where he is fed by an eagle. Later the eagle declares
itself to be the ghost of the dead man, and brings its benefactor to
court.

*Oldenburgian* is a similar tale. A merchant's son while on a voyage
pays thirty dollars to bury a man, and also buys a captive princess with
her maid. Though ill-received by his father on his return, he marries
the girl. Later he goes on another voyage, with his wife's portrait as
the figure-head of his ship. This is recognized by the king, who sends
him back for the princess in the company of a minister. The latter
pitches him overboard, goes on for the princess, and does not tell her
of her loss till they arrive at court. She finally consents to marry the
traitor after five years. Meanwhile, the hero lives on an island,
whither on the day appointed for the princess's bridal comes the ghost
of the dead in the form of a snow-white dove. It takes him to the court,
where he is recognized by a ring, a gift from his bride, which he drops
into a cup that she offers hint.

Of these two variants, *Oldenburgian* is much better preserved than the
Tyrolese story (*Simrock V.*). The

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

latter is dressed in a homely fashion, which probably accounts for some
of the changes, since the gap between the visits to market and the
romantic or miraculous features of the couple's later adventures was too
wide to be easily bridged. The disappointed suitor is not mentioned,
which leaves the attempt on the hero's life without motivation, and
clearly indicates some loss. <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157.md) The
trait is distinctly marked in *Oldenburgian*, as are all the other
events connected with *The Ransomed Woman*, though *Simrock V.* provides
an entirely original reason for the voyage of the young couple,—their
wish to get the hero's mother. The features concerning the rescue by the
ghost and the hero's return to court are better preserved again in
*Oldenburgian*, though both lack the agreement to divide, which is
probably obscured as elsewhere by the prominence given the rescued
woman. The most striking similarity between the two, however, lies in
the fact that the ghost first appears as a bird. This clearly shows the
existence of a type of *The Grateful Dead* + *The Ransomed Woman*, on
which *The Thankful Beasts* has had some influence.

It remains to consider the general relations of the variants discussed
in this chapter. The wide variety in detail of the incidents concerned
with the history of the hero's wife, yet the essential uniformity which
they show, would indicate clearly, for one thing, that *The Ransomed
Woman* is a motive originally quite independent of *The Grateful
Dead*,—that the type of story which is our present concern is a true
compound. It would even be possible to reconstruct the independent theme
in a form not unlike the Wendish folk-tale cited in the beginning of the
chapter. The hero, while on a journey, ransoms a princess, takes her
home, goes on another journey with some sign that attracts her father's
notice, goes back to

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

her and is cast into the sea by some man who hopes to marry her himself,
is rescued, and returns to court to claim his bride, usually by means of
a token.

The points of contact between this motive and *The Grateful Dead* would
seem to be, first, the journey which the hero undertakes at the opening
of the plot. It will be noted that in the compound he usually makes two
voyages, burying the dead on the first and ransoming the maiden on the
second, though the two are sometimes welded. The second point of
contact, I take it, was the rescue of the hero. In each story he did a
good act for which he was rewarded in some way. It has been shown that
this reward sometimes took the form of a rescue in the simple form of
*The Grateful Dead* <span id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_158.md) and in the
compound with *The Poison Maiden*. <span id="fr_159"></span>[2](#fn_159.md)
What more natural than that it should lead to another combination with a
story where the hero was saved from death? The difference in the case of
the latter, of course, would be that the agency of rescue was of little
importance. Could *Simonides* be shown to have anything more than a
literary life in mediaeval Europe, I should be inclined to think that
the rescue in that tale, even though the tale itself is not necessarily
connected with *The Grateful Dead* as we know the theme, might have had
some influence on the union. As the matter stands, however, it is
probably better to believe that the two motives were united in eastern
Europe, the one being Oriental and the other of uncertain derivation.
That each motive had a wife as part of the hero's reward must be taken
for granted, and it must have helped to combine them.

It follows from this that the compound *The Grateful Dead* + *The
Ransomed Woman* is quite independent of

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

the one discussed in the previous chapter, and could not have proceeded
from it as Hippe thought. <span id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160.md) It would
have been next to impossible for that combined type to divest itself of
the features peculiar to *The Poison Maiden*, and to absorb in their
place those of *The Ransomed Woman* without leaving some trace of the
process. Thus the existence of the compound as an independent growth is
assured. In this connection it is interesting to note that the rescue of
the hero from drowning in consequence of an act of treachery (or from an
island) occurs in all the variants of the type save four,
*Transylvanian*, *Trancoso*, *Gasconian*, and *Straparola I.*, <span
id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_161.md) but in no other version of *The Grateful
Dead* as far as I know.

From this general type developed minor varieties with traits borrowed
from *The Water of Life*, *The Thankful Beasts*, and *The Two Friends*,
or some such tale. Thus very complex variants arose. The question of the
connection which these subsidiary elements sustain to the central theme
cannot properly be discussed until they have been seen in other
combinations. The part they play in the development of the story, it is
evident, must have been a secondary one both in importance and in time.
