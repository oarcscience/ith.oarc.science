TWAS the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br />
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br />
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br />
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br />
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br />
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br />
And Mamma in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,<br />
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap;</td>

I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br />
Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br />
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br />
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,<br />
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,<br />
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny rein-deer,<br />
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br />
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br />
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br />
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;</p></td>

His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!<br />
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br />
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br />
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;</p></td>

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br />
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself,<br />
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br />
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;<br />
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br />
And fill’d all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,</p></td>
