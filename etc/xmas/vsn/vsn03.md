*A Visit from St. Nick*, by Clement C. Moore, \[1823\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS PARALLEL TEXTS

This is a parallel presentation of the three texts of the poem *A Visit
from St. Nicholas*. It will be seen that aside from minor punctuation
and spelling differences, the texts are exactly the same. The one place
where there is any real difference is the names of the last two
reindeer.—JBH.
