### ZUÑI

The pueblo-dwelling Indians, of whom the Zuñi are the chief
representatives, belong to a stage of culture that the great
civilizations of Middle and South America had come directly out of. And
as in Middle and South America, the whole form of Zuñi culture, the
whole trend of Zuñi religious thought, is conditioned by the cultivation
of maize. The story given here is taken from Cushing's "Zuñi Creation
Myth," published as a report of the Bureau of American Ethnology in
1896. Cushing's remarks on Zuñi culture which are here quoted come out
of observations which he made in the period between 1879 and 1881:

The Zuñi faith . . . is a drop of oil in water, surrounded and touched
at every point, yet in no place penetrated or changed inwardly by the
flow of alien belief that descended upon it. . . . Yet a casual visitor
to Zuñi, seeing, but unable to analyze the signs above noted, would be
led to infer quite the contrary by other and more potent signs. He would
see horses, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats, to say nothing of swine
and a few scrawny chickens. He would see peach orchards and wheat
fields, carts (and weapons now), and tools of metal; would find, too, in
queer out-of-the-way little rooms, native silversmiths plying their
primitive bellows and deftly using a few crude tools of iron and stone
to turn their scant silver coins into bright buttons, bosses, beads, and
bracelets which every well-conditioned Zuñi wears, and he would see worn
also, especially by the men, clothing of gaudy calico and other thin
products of the looms of civilization. Indeed if one did not see these
things and rate them as at first the gifts to this people of those noble
old Franciscan friars and their harder-handed, less noble Spanish
companions, infinitely more pathetic than it is would be the history of
the otherwise vain effort I have above outlined; for it is not to be
forgotten that the principal of these gifts have been of incalculable
value to the Zuñi. They have helped to preserve him, through an era of
new external conditions, from the fate that met thirty other and less
favored Pueblo tribes--annihilation by the better-armed, ceaselessly
prowling Navajo and Apache,

and for this alone, their almost sole accomplishment of lasting good to
the Zuñi, not in vain were spent and given the lives of the early
mission fathers.
