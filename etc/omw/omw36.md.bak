### APOLLO

Of Apollo the swan sings as he alights upon the banks of the eddying
River Peneios; with clear voice and to the beating of his wings the swan
sings of him. And of Apollo, the minstrel, holding the lyre in his
hands, sings first and last. He and Artemis, his sister, were the
children of Leto and Zeus. Long did Leto wander over the earth, trying
to find a place where she could give birth to her children, for Hera,
the great spouse of Zeus, was angry and withheld all help from her. At
last she came to Delos and begged of that island to grant her a place
where she might be delivered of her burthen. And Delos, that little

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

island, said, "Gladly, Lady Leto, would I give a place for the birth of
your children. I who am little and ill-spoken of by men on account of my
hard and rocky soil would be honoured greatly should their birth take
place on any lap of my lands. But I have fear, too--I fear lest your
children should become ashamed of their birth-place, and overturn me,
and thrust me down into the depths of the sea, and have the strange and
ugly creatures of the deep make their lairs on me--sea-lions haunting my
vales and not human beings. But all should be well, Goddess, if you
would take a great oath that your son shall build a temple upon my
land." Leto took an oath by Styx--the oath that the Gods take and may be
broken never--that her son should have his temple built upon the island.

 

So Leto's children were born on Delos, that little island--her twin
children, Apollo and Artemis. Although Hera withheld all help many of
the Goddesses were present at the birth. They took Apollo and washed him
in sweet water; they clothed him in white and they put a golden band
about him. And Themis, one of the elder Goddesses, gave him ambrosia and
nectar, the food of the immortal Gods.

As soon as he had tasted that divine food the infant sprang from the
arms of his nurse. He spoke, and all Delos blossomed and gleamed with
golden light. He took into his hands the bow and the lyre. Later he
received from Hephaistos a quiver of arrows. With these arrows, shot
from his silver bow, he slew Python, the huge dragon that was the
offspring of Earth. He slew Typhon, too--Typhon, the monster that had no
likeness to anything that the Gods had brought into being.

Leaving there the dead and sprawling monster, he went into the lovely
Vale of Tempe. There he saw Daphne; Earth was her mother, her father was
Peneios, the River. Her hair was unbound as she ran down the slopes of
the Mountain Ossa. She saw him standing upon a peak, his silver bow
across his shoulder, with the light striking upon his quiver. She knew
him for the most beautiful of the Olympians. But when he called to her
she fled from him, for she had vowed that no God nor no man should
possess her. She ran as a deer runs. Apollo followed her. Down the
slopes of Ossa the chase went, the God in pursuit of the maiden. Daphne
knew all the places; she was swift of foot and she thought she could
out-distance her pursuer. On she ran. But

now her breath came in pants; her heart nearly burst within her body.
She heard the words that were called out to her, "Stay, O stay! It is
not hate that makes me follow you!" She heard his breathing behind her.

Into a soft place she ran, and her feet sank into the ground. "O Mother
Earth, make it that I do not have to yield to him," she prayed. Then she
felt his breath upon her neck; she felt his hands upon her shoulders.
She swayed; she knew herself changed, and rooted in earth, and safe from
pursuit. And Apollo found himself holding the twigs and the leaves of a
laurel-tree. "Daphne, O Daphne," he cried, as he felt the blood in the
body he held flow down and become sap, as he saw the limbs, and the
flesh, and the flowing hair become branches and leaves. He mourned for
her where he stood. But as he loved Daphne as a maiden so now he loves
her as a tree. He plucked the leaves and put them around his brows. And
still Apollo wears and still he gives the laurel.
