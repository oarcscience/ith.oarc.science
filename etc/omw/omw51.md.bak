### MATH, THE SON OF MATHONWY

### I. THE TREACHERY OF GWYDION AND GILVAETHWY

To Pryderi, the son of Pwyll, the King of Annwfn sent as gift a drove of
swine. Pryderi then had rule in the South, and Math, the son of
Mathonwy, had rule in the North. To Math, the son of Mathonwy, went
Gwydion. "Lord," said Gwydion, "I have heard that there have come into
the South some animals such as were never known in this island before."
"What are they called?" "Pigs, Lord." "And what kind of animals are
they?" "They are small animals, and their flesh is better than the flesh
of oxen." "Who owneth them?" "Pryderi,

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

the son of Pwyll; they were sent him from Annwfn by Arawn, the King of
Annwfn." "And by what means may they be obtained from him?" "I know a
way by which they may be obtained. I will go as one of twelve, each of
us in the guise of a bard, and we will obtain the swine from Pryderi."
"Go forward, then," said Math, the son of Mathonwy, to Gwydion, his
sister's son.

But it was not so much to obtain the swine from Pwyll's son as to do a
wrong to Math, the son of Mathonwy, that Gwydion offered to go to where
Pryderi had his court. For Gwydion's brother had fallen deeply in love
with a maiden who was close to Math, and the only way he might obtain
her was by bringing Math, the son of Mathonwy, into war.

For it was this way with Math, the son of Mathonwy: he could not exist
unless his feet were in the lap of a maiden. Only when he was engaged in
war could he separate himself from the maiden foot-holder. Now Goewin
was the maiden who was with him at this time, and she was the fairest
maiden who was known in Arvon. Gilvaethwy, the son of Math's sister and
the brother of Gwydion, set his affections upon Goewin, and loved her so
that he knew not what he should do because of her, and therefore,
behold! his hue, and his aspect, and his spirits changed for love of
her, so that it was not easy to know him.

One day his brother Gwydion gazed steadfastly upon him. "Youth," he
said, "what aileth thee?" "Why," replied Gilvaethwy, "what seest thou in
me?" "I see," said his brother, "that thou hast lost thine aspect and
thy hue; what, therefore, aileth thee?" "My lord brother," answered
Gilvaethwy, "that which aileth me, it will not profit me that I should
show to any." "What may it be, my soul?" "Thou knowst that Math, the son
of Mathonwy, hath this property, that if men whisper together in a tone
how low soever, if the wind meet it, it becomes known to him." "Yes,"
said Gwydion. "Now hold thy peace. I know thine intent."

Then Gilvaethwy, when he found that his brother knew his intent, gave
the heaviest sigh in the world. "Be silent, and sigh not," said Gwydion
to him. "It is not thereby that thou wilt succeed. I will cause a war,"
he said, "that will separate Math, the son of Mathonwy, from his maiden
foot-holder." It was then that Gwydion went before

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Math and obtained permission from him to go seek
the swine owned by Pryderi.

Now he and Gilvaethwy departed with ten men with them, and they were all
in the guise of bards. They came to the court, and they were received
joyfully by Pryderi, the son of Pwyll, and Gwydion was placed beside
Pryderi that night.

Said Prince Pryderi, "Gladly would I hear a tale from one of your men
yonder." "Lord," said Gwydion, "we have a custom that the first night we
come to the court of a prince, the chief of song recites a tale. And
gladly will I recite one for you." So Gwydion recited, and diverted all
the court that night with tales and pleasant discourse, and he charmed
everyone, and it pleased Pryderi to talk with him. And after a while
Gwydion said to Pryderi, "Lo, now! My errand! It is to crave from thee
the animals that were sent thee from Annwfn." "Verily," said Pryderi,
"that were the easiest thing in the world to grant thee, were it not
that there is a covenant between me and my land concerning these
animals. And the covenant is that they shall not go from me till they
have produced double their number in this land." "Lord," said Gwydion
then, "give me not the swine to-night, but neither refuse them to me."
And so Pryderi, if he did not give them, did not refuse the swine to
Gwydion that night.

So Gwydion betook him to the magic arts that he knew, and he began to
work a charm. And he caused twelve steeds to appear, and twelve black
greyhounds, each of them white-breasted, and having upon them twelve
collars and twelve leashes, such as no one who saw them could believe to
be other than gold. And upon the steeds were twelve saddles, and every
part which should have been of metal was entirely of gold, and the
bridles were of the same workmanship. Then, with the steeds and the
hounds, Gwydion appeared before Pryderi.

"Lord," said he, "behold! here is a release for thee from the word thou
spakest last night concerning the swine that thou couldst neither give
them nor sell them. Thou mayst exchange them for that which is better.
And I will give thee these twelve horses, all caparisoned as they are,
with their saddles and their bridles, and these twelve greyhounds, with
their collars and their leashes as thou seest." Then Pryderi and his
council agreed to take the steeds and hounds, and let

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Gwydion take the swine. This was done. And all
that Gwydion had given was formed out of fungus.

Gwydion and Gilvaethwy and their men took their leave and went forward
swiftly with the swine. "It is needful we journey with speed," said
Gwydion. "The illusion will not last but from a certain hour to the same
hour to-morrow." They hurried on, and they came within Math's dominion,
and they made a sty for the swine; they proceeded, and they came before
Math, the son of Mathonwy. And as soon as they came before him lo! the
trumpets sounded, and the host of Pryderi was advancing into Gwynedd,
Math's dominion.

And, lo! there was the tumult of war in Gwynedd. Then Math, the son of
Mathonwy, went forth to meet Pryderi; Gwydion and Gilvaethwy went with
him. But at night Gilvaethwy and Gwydion returned; Gilvaethwy took the
couch of Math, the son of Mathonwy. And while he turned out the other
damsels from the room discourteously, he made Goewin unwillingly remain.

When these two brothers saw the day they went back to where Math, the
son of Mathonwy, was with his host. Then the battle began, and Pryderi's
host was forced to flee. Then Pryderi and Gwydion fought in single
combat. And by force of strength and fierceness, and by the magic and
charms of Gwydion, Pryderi, the son of Pwyll, was slain. Then Math, the
son of Mathonwy, went back to his court, while Gwydion and Gilvaethwy
went the circuit of his lands.

Math went within his chamber, and caused a place to be prepared for him
whereon to recline, so that be might put his feet in the maiden's lap.
"Lord," said Goewin, "seek now another to hold thy feet, for I am not
now a maiden. An attack was made unawares upon me, and by thy nephews,
Lord, the sons of thy sister, Gwydion and Gilvaethwy: unto me they did
wrong, and unto thee dishonour." "Verily," said Math, the son of
Mathonwy, "I will do the utmost in my power concerning this matter.
First I will cause thee to have compensation, and then I will have
amends made to myself. As for thee, I will take thee to be my wife, and
the possessions of my dominions will I give into thy hands."

And Gwydion and Gilvaethwy came not near the court, but stayed at the
confines of the land until it was forbidden to give them meat and drink.
Then, at last, they came before Math. "Lord," they said, "we

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

are at thy will." "By my will I would not have lost my warriors. You
cannot compensate me my shame, setting aside the death of Pryderi. But
since ye came hither at my will, I shall begin your punishment
forthwith." So said Math, the son of Mathonwy.
