### PE-LE, HAWAII'S GODDESS OF VOLCANIC FIRE

### III

Then Pe-le commanded her sisters to put on their robes of fire, and go
forth and destroy Lo-hi-au. In their robes of fire they went to where he
was; when they came to him they threw cinders upon his feet and went
away again. But Pe-le knew that they had made only a pretence of
destroying the man. The cauldron within her pit bubbled up; she called
upon her helpers, upon Lono-makua, Ku-pulupulu, Kumoku-halli,
Ku-ala-na-wao. At first they would not help her to destroy Lo-hi-au;
rather, with their own hands, did they roll the fires back into the pit.
Then did Pe-le threaten her helpers; then did Lono-makua go forth to do
her bidding.

Lo-hi-au saw the fires coming towards him, and he chanted:

All about is flame-the rock-plain rent;  
The coco-palms that tufted the plain  
Are gone, all gone, clean down to Ka-poho.  
On rushes the dragon with flaming mouth,  
Eating its way to Oma-’o-lala.  
For tinder it has the hair of the fern.  
A ghastly rain blots out the sky;  
The sooty birds of storm whirl through the vault;  
Heaven groans, a-drip, as with dragon-blood!

The fires that rolled towards them spared Hi-i-aka. Lo-hi-au, choked by
the vapour, fell down, and the lava-flow went over him.

So Hi-i-aka lost the one whom she had come to love, as she had lost her
lehua groves and her dear and lovely friend, Ho-po-e, through the rage
of her sister Pe-le, the dread Goddess. In her grief she would have
broken up the strata of the earth, and would have let the sea rise up
through and destroy the islands, if Ka-ne had not appeared before
her--Ka-ne the Earth-shaper. Ka-ne soothed her mind, and she went back
to the Pit, and sat amongst her sisters.

Once a man who was a great sorcerer came down into the Pit. "What is the
purpose of your visit?" he was asked.

"I have come to know why Lo-hi-au, my friend, has been destroyed," he
said.

"He and Hi-i-aka kissed, and the man was tapu for Pe-le," the sisters
answered.

"He tasted death at Haena. Why was he made [to](errata.htm#3.md) taste
death again in Hawaii?"

Pe-le, seated at the back of the Pit, spoke: 'What is it that you say?
That Lo-hi-au tasted death at Haena?"

"Yes. Hi-i-aka brought his soul and his body together again. Then they
sailed for Hawaii."

Then said Pe-le to her youngest sister: "Is this true? Is it true that
you found Lo-hi-au dead and that you restored him to life?"

"It is true. And it is true that not until you had destroyed my friend
Ho-po-e did I give a caress to Lo-hi-au."

So Hi-i-aka said, and Pe-le, the Woman of the Pit, became silent. Then
the sorcerer, Lo-hi-au's friend, said, "I would speak to Pe-le.

\[paragraph continues\] But which is Pe-le? I have a test. Let me hold
the hand of each of you, O Divine Women, so that I may know which of you
is the Goddess."

He took the hand of each of Pe-le's sisters, and held the hand to his
cheek. He held the hollow palm to his ear. Each hand that was given to
him had only a natural warmth when it was put to his check. Then he took
the hand of a hag whose skin was rugged and blackened, whose hair was
the colour of cinders, whose eyes were red. The hand was burning on his
cheek. From the hollow of the hand came reverberations of the sounds
made by fountains of fire. "This is Pe-le," said the man, and he bent
down and adored her.

Then Pe-le, loving this man who was Lo-hi-au's friend, and knowing that
Hi-i-aka had been faithful in her service to her, softened, and would
have Lo-hi-au brought to life again. But only one who was in far Kahiki
possessed the power to restore Lo-hi-au to life. This was Kane-milo-hai,
Pe-le's brother.

And Kane-milo-hai, coming over the waters in his shell-canoe, found
Lo-hi-au's spirit, in the form of a bird, flitting over the waters. He
took it, and he brought it to where Lo-hi-au lay. He broke up the lava
in which the body was set, and he reformed the body out of the
fragments, restoring to it the lineaments that Lo-hi-au had. Then he
brought the spirit back into the body.

And afterwards it happened that Hi-i-aka, wandering where the lehua
groves were growing again, and knowing that after dire destruction a new
world had come into existence, heard the chant:

Puna's plain takes the colour of scarlet--  
Red as heart's blood the bloom of lehua.  
The nymphs of the Pit string hearts in a wreath:  
O the pangs of the Pit, Ki-lau-ea!

\[paragraph continues\] Hi-i-aka went to where the chant came from; she
discovered Lo-hi-au restored to life once more. With him she wandered
through the land below Ki-lau-ea. Men and women were peopling the land,
and the Gods of the Pit were not now so terror-inspiring.
