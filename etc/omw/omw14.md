### JAPANESE

In distinction to Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, Shintoism is the
primitive body of beliefs of the Japanese people. The two cosmological
myths given here are from Shinto sources. The triumph of the Sun Goddess
over darkness and disorder is identified with the triumph of the
Imperial dynasty over forces that were hostile to it: the Imperial
family claim descent from the Sun Goddess.
