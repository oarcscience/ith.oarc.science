### CELTIC

Celtic mythology is known to us only in the fragments that have come
down to us through Irish (Gaelic) and Welsh (Brythonic) romances. Of the
mythology of the Continental Celts we know nothing:

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

On the Continent the Celtic tribes came in contact with the rich and
highly organised Graeco-Roman mythology, and discarded their own mythic
romance. In the British Isles Celtic mythic romance escaped the
destructive influence of Rome, was spared by Christianity, and served,
almost down to the present day, as a backbone and rallying centre to the
peasant lore about the fairies, which is substantially the old
agricultural faith, preserved in rude and crude form, and partly
reshaped by the fierce opposition or the insidious patronage of
Christianity. Gaelic peasant lore only differs from that of other parts
of Europe, because Gaeldom has preserved, in a romantic form, a portion
of the pre-Christian mythology. Thanks to the fact that this mythology
enters largely into the Arthurian romance, the literature of modern
England has retained access to the fairy realm, and has been enabled to
pluck in the old wonder-garden of unending joy fruits of imperishable
beauty. <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md)

In Ireland a learned class who took pride in preserving the relics of
the national past, wrote down histories and romances that contained
mythological material. We have these histories and romances in documents
of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Book of Leinster and the Book
of the Dun Cow: the material on which they are based is of a much
earlier period. In Wales a material less copious and more distorted,
was, between 1080 and 1260, shaped into the romances that we know in the
Mabinogion.

The Celts were known in the ancient world for their positive beliefs
concerning the survival of the soul. They appear to have had a
conception of a Happy Otherworld which was similar to that of the early
Greeks:

Although from fifteen hundred to two thousand years separate the
earliest recorded Greek and Irish utterances in a form, substantially
speaking, yet extant, yet both stand on much the same stage of
development, save that Ireland has preserved, with greater fulness and
precision, a conception out of which Homeric Greece had already emerged.
Examination of the mythologies due to other Aryan races, or rather, to
prejudge nothing, to peoples speaking Aryan tongues equally with the
Greeks and Irish, reveals the remarkable fact that Greeks and Irish
alone have preserved the early stage of the Happy Other. world
conception in any fulness. <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)

The Celtic religion appears to have been the worship of the Powers of
Life and Increase:

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

In Greece the Powers of Life and Increase, worshipped by the primitive
agriculturists, are but one element in the completed Hellenic Pantheon,
and this has been subjected to so much change, to such enlargement and
glorification, as to be well-nigh unrecognizable. In Ireland, to judge
by extant native texts, these powers must have constituted the
predominant element of the Pantheon, and cannot have departed very
widely from their primitive form. . . . In the main that mythology had
for its *dramatis personae* the agricultural Powers of Life and
Increase, in the main it was made up of stories of which the ultimate
essence and significance were agricultural. <span

The same authority offers the following conclusions on the subject of
Celtic mythology as it is revealed in the Irish romances:

The features common to Greek and Irish mythology belong to the earlier
known stage of Aryan mythical evolution, and are not the result of
influence exercised by the more upon the less advanced race. Survivals
in Greece, they represent the high-water mark of Irish pre-Christian
development; hence their greater consistency and vividness in Ireland.
Fragmentary as they may be in form and distorted as it may be by its
transmission through Christian hands, we thus owe to Ireland the
preservation of mythical conceptions and visions more archaic in
substance if far later in record than the great mythologies of Greece
and Vedic India. <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md)

The Celtic stories given here deal mainly with adventures in the Happy
Otherworld, in the Divine Land. The Voyage of Prince Bran is a typical
story. Translated by Kuno Meyer, it is published with a comment by
Alfred Nutt which is a study of Celtic mythology. The poems form the
oldest part of the story; they date back to the eighth, or possibly to
the seventh century. In the Divine Land to which Prince Bran voyages
take place the events which lead up to the birth of Etain and afterwards
to the death of King Conaire. This Divine Land is also the scene of
Pwyll's adventures in the Welsh story. Pwyll, Arawn, and Mathonwy were
originally divinities in Celtic Britain: their stories are taken from
the Welsh Mabinogion.
