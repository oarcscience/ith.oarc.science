Loki's Punishment  

# ICELANDIC

## IN THE BEGINNING: THE BUILDING OF THE WALL: MIMIR: BALDR: LOKI'S PUNISHMENT: THE CHILDREN OF LOKI: RAGNA RÖK, THE FATE OF THE GODS

### IN THE BEGINNING

In the beginning was Yawning Gap: to one side of it was the Place of Fog
and Mist; to the other side was the Place of Fire. Ginnunga Gap,
Niflheim, Muspellsheim--these were in the beginning. Yawning Gap filled
up with chill streams flowing from the Place of Fog and Mist; the heat
from the Place of Fire turned the chill streams into mist; out of the
mist was formed two beings--Ymir the ancient Giant, and the cow
Audhumla.

Ymir stayed by Audhumla and drank her milk. Giants and Giantesses came
from his feet; the race of Giants multiplied. Then another race
appeared. One day Ymir saw Audhumla breathe upon a cliff of ice and lick
with her tongue the place she breathed on. As her tongue went over and
over the place the Giant saw that a figure was being formed. It was not
like a Giant's form; it was more shapely. A head appeared in the cliff
and golden hair fell over the ice. As Ymir looked upon the being that
was being formed he hated him for his beauty.

Audhumla, the giant cow, went on licking the place where she had
breathed. At last a man completely formed stepped from the cliff. Ymir,
the ancient Giant, hated him so much that he would have slain him then
and there. But he knew that if he did this Audhumla would feed him no
more on her milk.

Buri was the name of the one who was formed in the ice-cliff. Buri,
married to one of the Giantesses, had a son. His son, Bur, married to
Bestla, daughter of the Giant Bolthorn, had three sons: they were the
first of the Aesir, the first of the Gods.

Their names were Oithin, Hönir, and Lothur. For a time they lived in
peace with Ymir and his children. Then as the children of Bur multiplied
and the children of Ymir multiplied there was war between them. The
ancient Giant was slain. So huge was Ymir that his blood when he was
slain poured out in such mighty flood that his sons

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

were all drowned in it, all except the Giant Bergelmir. He was in a boat
with his wife when the flood came; they floated away on the flood to the
place that came to be called Jotunheim; from them the race of Giants
came, and in that place the race of Giants lived.

Now Oithin and his brothers and his sons took the body of Ymir--the
vastest body that ever was--and they flung it into Yawning Gap, filling
up the great chasm with it. They dug the bones out of the body and they
piled them up into mountains; they took the teeth out and they made them
into rocks; they took the hair of Ymir and they made it into grasses and
forests of trees; out of his hollow skull they made the sky.

Oithin with his brothers and sons did more than this. They took the
sparks and the clouds of flame that blew from Muspellsheim and they made
them into the sun and moon and all the stars that are in the sky. The
sun and the moon were drawn by horses: the sun by Arvak and Alsvith, the
Early-waking One and the Fleet One. When Oithin lighted up the world
with the sun and the moon, the Giants who were born of Bergelmir and his
wife were very wroth: they found two of the fleetest and fiercest of the
mighty wolves of Jotunheim, and they set them to follow Sol and Mani,
the sun and the moon. And ever afterwards Sol and Mani were pursued by
the wolves out of Jotunheim, the place of the Giants.

Oithin, Hönir, and Lothur then made the race of men: Ask and Embla were
the names of the first pair made; the Gods made them out of the ash and
the elm-tree. Oithin gave them soul and motion, Hönir gave them sense
and feeling, Lothur gave them warmth and colour. The Gods made a world
for themselves and a world for men. Asgarth was the name of the world
they made for themselves; Mithgarth was the name of the world they made
for men. And, lest the Giants should come out of Jotunheim and destroy
Mithgarth, the Gods set as a fence around it an eyebrow of Ymir's. Out
of the flesh of Ymir Dwarfs had come. The Gods made a world for them
also: Svartalfaheim, a world that is under Mithgarth.

There was a tree that spread its branches through all the worlds and
that had its roots in three of the worlds. That tree was named
Yggdrasil. One of its roots was in Asgarth, one was in Jotunheim, and
one was in Niflheim that was the World of the Dead. The root that was

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

in Niflheim was beside a well. Therein was the dreadful serpent,
Nithogg: Nithogg gnawed for ever at the root of the World Tree, wanting
to destroy it. And Ratatosk, the squirrel, ran up and down Yggdrasil
making trouble between the eagle that was at the top of the tree and the
serpent that was below. He went to tell the serpent how the eagle was
bent upon tearing him to pieces, and he went back to tell the eagle how
the serpent planned to devour him. Beside the root of the tree in
Jotunheim was a well guarded by old Mimir the Wise. Whoever drank out of
this well would know all of the things that are to come to pass. And
beside the root that was in Asgarth was another well: the three sisters
who are the Norns guarded it, and their names were Urth, Verthandi, and
Skuld--Past, Present, and Future; they took the water of the well and
watered Yggdrasil with it that the Tree of the World might be kept green
and strong. This well was called Urda's well. Two swans were on the
water of it; they made music that the Dwellers in Asgarth often heard.
On the branches of the tree four stags grazed; they shook from their
horns the water that fell as rain in Mithgarth. And on the topmost
branch of Yggdrasil, the branch that was so high that the Gods
themselves could hardly see it, was perched the eagle that the serpent
was made to fear. Upon the beak of the eagle a hawk perched, a hawk that
saw what the eyes of the eagle could not see.

In Asgarth there were many halls: there was the one that was called
Glathsheim, built by the golden-leaved wood, Glasir: here Oithin and the
twelve who were his peers had their high seats, and here the banquets of
the Gods were held. Here Oithin, the Father of Gods and men, would seat
himself, a blue mantle upon him, and a shining helmet shaped like an
eagle upon his head. He would sit there, not eating at all, but drinking
the wine of the Gods, and taking food from the table which he gave to
Geri and Freki, the two wolves that crouched beside his seat. Then there
was Vingolf, which had high seats for Frigg, the wife of Oithin, and the
Goddesses. There was the hall Heithskjolf, that was roofed all over with
silver: from it Oithin could look out upon all the worlds. There was
Fensalir, where Frigg sat spinning with golden threads; there was
Breithablik, where Baldr the Well-beloved lived with his fair wife, the
young Nanna; there was Bilskirnir, where Thor and his wife, Sif, lived.
And there was the hall in which

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

those who were heroes amongst men lived and feasted when they had come
to Oithin after their deaths in battle: that hall was named Valhall.

Between Asgarth and Mithgarth there was a bridge that was called
Bifrost, or Rainbow. It was the strongest and the most lovely of
bridges. Upon it was a ruddy gleam that came from the light of a fire
that burned always to prevent the Giants from crossing it. Bifrost was
to break when the Giants made their way across it and the battle ensued
that was to end all things. Heimdal guarded the bridge. He never slept;
he was able to hear the grass growing on the ground and the wool of
sheep growing upon their backs. He had golden teeth. He could see before
him or around him, night or day, for hundred of miles. His dwelling was
called Himinbjorg, the Mount of Heaven. One day he would take up the
horn that was under the root of Yggdrasil--the Gjallar-horn--and blow
upon it. And the sound of the horn would tell the Gods and the Heroes
that the Giants were crossing Bifrost and the battle between the Gods
and the Giants--the battle that would mean the end of all things--was
beginning.

The Aesir had settled in Asgarth and had prevented the Giants destroying
Asgarth and Mithgarth. Other foes assailed them. The Wanes came against
them and destroyed their seats. Oithin made peace with the Wanes. He
gave hostages to them and took hostages from them: Hönir he gave to the
Wanes; Njorth he took from them as a hostage. Then there was peace
between the Aesir and the Wanes: they joined together; together they
opposed the Giants.
