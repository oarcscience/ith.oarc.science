### PERUVIAN

The two great civilizations of America, the Middle American and the
South American, appear to have had their rise about the same time, and
in each a period of decadence seems to have set in just before the
advent of the European conquerors. We have much less information about
the civilization we name Inca than the one we name Aztec. Most of what
we know about the antiquities of Peru comes from the writings of
Garcilasso de la Vega, whose father was Spanish and whose mother was
Peruvian, and who regarded himself as a descendant of the Incas and an
interpreter of their traditions. Garcilasso has been translated into
English by Sir Clements Markham, whose own books upon Peru tell us
practically all that is known about the ancient monuments, literature,
and traditions of the Incas. In the first story, I have imagined someone
like Garcilasso speaking. The second is not mythological; it is probably
a folk-tale. But the mythological survivals of the Incas are so scanty
that any story that has even a slight connection with their mythology,
and that has some portion of their imagination in it, is of interest.
"The Llama-herder and the Virgins of the Sun" is retold from a version
given by Sir Clements Markham; it was told to Fray Martin de Morua, who
was a Quichua scholar, in 1583.
