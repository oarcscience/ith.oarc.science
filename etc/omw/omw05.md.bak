### JEWISH: POST-CHRISTIAN PERIOD

The Jewish stories that have come down to us in the Haggadah are more
akin to the Persian than they are to any other stories. Their monotheism
seems to be nominal, veiling a real dualism. Thus, God creates the
Angels on the second day "lest man believe that the Angels assisted God
in the creation of the heavens and the earth." This suggestion of
rivalry is in many of the stories: God is on one side, the Angels on the
other. The Angel Samael who becomes Satan is, in his opposition to the
Most High, like Angra Mainyu in relation to Ahura Mazda. The stories
that form the Haggadah were developed between the second and the
fourteenth century of our era. They are accessible in "The Legends of
the Jews" by Louis Ginzberg. <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md)
