### THE DEATH OF CONAIRE MÓR, THE KING OF IRELAND

### II

Conaire Mór was the most splendid, noble, and beautiful king that ever
was in Ireland, and of the kings of the world he was the mildest and
gentlest. There was no defect in him whether in form, shape, or vesture;
in vision, skill, or eloquence; in knowledge, valour, or kindred. In
Ireland during his reign not a cloud veiled the sun from the middle of
spring to the middle of autumn; not a dew-drop fell from the grass till
it was past mid-day. In his reign from year's end to year's end peace
was kept with the wolves even. No man slew another; to everyone in
Ireland his fellow's voice was as sweet as the strings of harps. Ireland
had the three crowns upon her then--the crown of corn-ears, the crown of
flowers, and the crown of oak-mast.

These were the prohibitions that were laid upon Conaire Mór:

He was not to permit rapine in the land;

He was not to go out on a ninth night from Tara;

He was not to go right-handwise round Tara, nor left-handwise round
Bregia;

He was not to hunt the evil beasts of Cerna;

He was not to let three Reds go before him to the house of a Red;

He was not to let a solitary woman come into a house where he was after
sunset.

The peace of his reign was broken by Conaire's foster-brothers. Pride
and wilfulness possessed them, and they went reiving through Ireland.
Year after year, for three years, they went reiving. And

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

when all complained against them, the king said, "Let every father slay
his own son, but let my foster-brothers be spared." He permitted rapine
to be wrought, and so one of the prohibitions laid upon him was broken.
At last he withdrew his protection from his foster-brothers. They took
ships and went upon the seas. And on the seas they met Ingcel the
One-eyed, the son of the King of Britain, who was a banished man also.
With him they joined forces. They raided Britain; they destroyed a
fortress there; Ingcel's father and his seven brothers were in it and
they were slain unwittingly by the raiders.

Ingcel demanded destruction for destruction, and he had Conaire's
foster-brothers join him in a raid on Ireland. They beached their ships
and they landed, a force of fierce marauders, upon the plain of the
Liffey, south of Tara. "What mansion is it I have seen," said Ingcel to
Ferrogain, "where the light of a fire comes from the main door and
shines through the spokes of the chariot-wheels outside?" "Surely it is
the guest-house that stands on the road to Tara--the guest-house of Da
Derga," said Ferrogain. "But a guest-house is sanctuary in every
land--’tis wrong to sack a guest-house," said Lomna Dru. "Lomna, when we
made our oaths, we made no reservations as to a guest-house," said
Ingcel. "Unless the earth break under us," said Fergobar, "the
destruction of this guest-house shall be wrought. Neither old men nor
historians shall declare that I quitted the destruction until I had
accomplished it." "Rouse up, then, ye champions," cried Ingcel, the
one-eyed outlaw of Britain, "we will plunder that guest-house and
destroy it, and destroy all who are in it. A rich plunder will be ours
to carry to our ships." Ferrogain and Lomna Dru stayed back, but
Fergobar joined himself with Ingcel, and the fierce marauders marched
towards the guest-house that was called Da Derga's Hostel,

King Conaire had broken another of his prohibitions: he went beyond Tara
on a ninth night; he went to settle a dispute between two of his
thralls. Now as he returned with his household he saw the smoke of a
burning country between him and his royal house. With his cavalcade he
went another way; in going that way he went right-handwise round Tara
and left-handwise round Bregia. Strange

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

beasts rose up in front of him, and he pursued them. These were the evil
beasts of Cerna, but Conaire did not know this until the chase was over.

The king knew that he would have to lie that night outside his royal
house. He rode towards the guest-house that stood with its seven doors
open on the road to Tara. Now the name "Derga" means "Red," and Conaire
knew that he must not let three Reds ride before him to the hostel. But
even as he thought upon this he saw three clad in red and riding upon
red steeds before him on the road. He bade one from his cavalcade ride
after them and bid them turn back. But Conaire's horseman could not come
upon the red riders. He shouted to them, bidding them turn back at the
king's command. One of the riders, looking over his shoulder, shouted
back: "A gathering at a hostel; great the destruction; great the
tidings." Again Conaire's horseman cried to them to turn back for the
sake of the great reward that would be given them. Then the riders
chanted: "Weary are the steeds we ride, the steeds from the Land of the
Ever-living. Though we are living, we are dead. Great are the signs;
destruction of life; sating of ravens; feeding of crows; strife of
slaughter; wetting of sword-edges; shields with broken bosses after
sundown. Lo, my son!" Still they rode on. Conaire's horseman saw them
alight before Da Derga's Hostel, and fasten their red steeds to the
portal, and seat themselves within. The horseman rode back and told the
king that the red riders had entered before him. "More of my *geise*
have now been broken," said Conaire.

So he and his cavalcade rode on, and they entered Da Derga's Hostel.
Then were the chariots left outside the hostel, seventeen chariots with
steeds small-headed and broad-chested, each steed with a bridle of red
enamel. There were grey spears over the chariots, and those on guard
there had ivory-hilted swords by their sides and silver shields above
their elbows. At one side of the great door as guard stood the King of
Ulster's son, Cormac. He was a man of noble countenance, with clear and
sparkling eyes. His face was broad above and narrow below. He had golden
hair and a proper fillet around it; there was a brooch of silver in his
mantle, and in his hand he held a gold-hilted sword. His shield had five
golden circles upon it. At the other side of the door stood Conall
Cearnach, Conall the Victorious, most

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

famous of Ireland's warriors. Blue as gentians were his eyes; dark as a
stag-beetle were his brows. The spear that he held in his hand was as
thick as a chariot's outer yoke. He had a blood-red shield on which were
rivets of white bronze between plates of gold. Between them stood the
king's champion, MacCecht. He was a man of strong and fear. inspiring
countenance. The shaft of his lance was the weight of a plough-yoke. He
had a wooden shield covered with plates of iron, and upright in his hand
he held a spear from the iron point of which blood dripped.

Conaire sat upon the couch. The mantle that was about him was even as
the mist of a May day: diverse were the hues and semblances each moment
shown upon it. A hand's breadth of his sword was outside its scabbard,
and a man in front of the hostel might see by the light of the blade.
The colour of the king's hair was like the sheen of smelted gold. Beside
him was his little son--a small, freckled lad in a purple cloak; he had
the manners of a maiden, and he was loved by all.

The king's juggler played before them. White as mountain cotton were the
hairs on his head. He had three shields, three swords, and three apples
of gold, and he kept them rising above and falling past each other like
bees on a day of beauty. But even as the king and his son looked on, lo!
a cry came from the things in the air, and they fell down upon the
floor. Then was the head of a man cast into the hostel. Conaire saw that
it was the head of Ferrogain, his foster-brother. He took it up, and
wept over it, and even then the reivers made their attack upon the
hostel.

A woman came and stood by the door-posts of the house. Her cloak was
soiled and smelt of damp earth. Great loathing came upon the company at
the sight of that woman. The king bade her begone. "It is known," he
said, "that it is a prohibition with me not to let a solitary woman be
after sunset where I am." The woman said, "If in sooth it has befallen
the king not to have in his house room and a meal for a solitary woman,
they will be gotten apart from him." "We will have you stay," said
Conaire, "albeit another of my *geise* is broken." The woman cast her
cloak upon the floor. "To-night," she said, "the king will sleep with
me."

Then another shape was shown to Conaire. He saw a man who had

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

only one eye, one foot, and one hand. He knew him for the Swineherd of
Bove Derg, and he knew that ruin was wrought at every feast at which he
was present. And shapes more dreadful than this shape were shown him. He
saw the Daughters of Bav--even those three that are slaughtered at every
destruction. Naked and bleeding, they hung by ropes from the roof.

There issued from the hostel a band terrible to the reivers, a band of
men whose dress was of rough hair, who had girdles of ox. hide, and who
were armed with flails; each flail they wielded had chains of iron
triple-twisted. These were the giants that had been taken by Cuchulain
at the beleaguerment of Faldal. They went through the reivers, their
savage eyes shining through their thick hair. But Ingcel called out to
them, and made terms with them, and drew them to his own side. Then was
the river that flowed through the hostel turned aside. Brands were flung
upon it; the hostel burned, and there was no water to quench the
burning.

Conall Cearnach went forth with his nine companions. He made a circuit
of the hostel, going through the reivers as a hawk goes through a flock
of small birds. A piper in red was there. He played before Conall, and
led Conall away with his bewildering music. Cormac, the son of the King
of Ulster, strove against the reivers. As a ship goes through the waves
so Cormac went through the ranks of those who attacked the hostel. A
piper in red went before him, and, playing an enchanting strain, led him
from the fight.

A thirst came upon the king. There was no water to assuage it. MacCecht
took up the king's golden cup and cut his way through the ranks of the
reivers to bring water to Conaire. The king armed his household and went
forth, and he and his harpers and cup-bearers and jugglers made their
fight. But a piper in red played, and a harper cried out that the Danaan
folk were against the king, because King Eochaid had lain waste the
Danaan places in his search for the queen who had been taken from the
world. The giants who had gone over to Ingcel turned against the king's
company with their iron flails.

MacCecht, the king's champion, failed to find water to assuage Conaire's
thirst. The wells, the rivers, and the lakes of Ireland, at the bidding
of the Danaan folk, hid themselves from him. The Shannon, the Slaney,
the Bann, and the Barrow--all the great rivers--hid themselves.

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The great lakes of Ireland hid themselves from
him that night. MacCecht came upon a lone lake far from the hostel--he
came upon Loch Gara. Before it could hide itself from him he had dipped
the king's golden cup into its water. Then, carrying the water, he
returned to the hostel. He found that all its defenders were dead or had
been led away by the music of the pipers from the Land of the
Ever-living. He came up as one of the reivers was striking off the head
of King Conaire. MacCecht slew the man. Taking up his master's head, he
poured a drink into his mouth. And Conaire's head spoke to Mac Cecht,
and praised him for his valour and his devotion.

MacCecht found Conaire's son unhurt, and he bore him away from that
place of destruction, As he stood by the burning hostel he heard the red
pipers chanting to each other: "Great the tidings. Through ancient
enchantments a company has perished. Until this was accomplished we
might not return. Now we ride the horses of Donn Tetscorach, the horses
of Midir's son. Now we ride back to the Land of the Ever-living."
