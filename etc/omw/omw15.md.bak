### POLYNESIAN

The widely spread Kanaka or Maori people have a rich and remarkably
homogeneous mythology: the same divine beings figure in stories told in
most of the islands of the Pacific Ocean. "We find," writes Miss Martha
Warren Beckwith, "the same story told in New Zealand and Hawaii,
scarcely changed, even in name. <span id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) "
In one sense, practically all Polynesian stories are mythological, for,
to quote Miss Beckwith again:

Gods and men are, in fact, to the Polynesian mind, one family under
different forms, the gods having superior control over certain phenomena
. . . the supernatural blends with the natural exactly the same way as
to the Polynesian mind gods relate themselves to men, facts about one
being regarded as, even though removed to the heavens, quite as
objective as those which belong to the other, and being employed to
explain social customs and physical appearances in actual experience.

The Polynesians, like the ancient Egyptians, thought of the soul as
being double: a part of it could go wandering and be brought back, or be
taken away and restored by spells of sorcerers.

The most direct and significant statement of Polynesian myth is "Pele
and Hiiaka" by N. B. Emerson. In this narrative we have the mythical
history of the Hawaiian Fire Goddess taken down from the lips of people
for whom it was still a belief by a man who knew the people and
understood their traditions. Only a bare outline of it is given here: as
published it extends to over 200 pages; 170 mele, or dramatic poems, are
given in the course of the narrative. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) When we read this myth we realize how
separate Polynesian culture is. The Polynesian Creation Myth is from New
Zealand, and is given by Sir George Grey in his "Polynesian Mythology."
The story of Maui's attempt to win immortality for men is from the same
work. The other story about Maui is in part from New Zealand and in part
from Hawaii: it is told in my own "At the Gateways of the Day," <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) but is ultimately based on stories given
by Mr. W. D. Westervelt in his

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "Maui the Demi-god." Maui is a pan-Polynesian
hero, and stories about him are told upon nearly all the islands which
the Kanaka-Maori people reached.
