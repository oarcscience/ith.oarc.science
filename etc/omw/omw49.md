### THE VOYAGE OF BRAN TO THE LAND OF THE IMMORTALS

Prince Bran sat in his royal house. The ramparts were closed around and
no more could anyone enter it. There was a gathering of the nobles and
notables of the countryside, and Prince Bran feasted them in his hall.

A woman came and stood in the doorway of the hall. None knew how she had
come there. She was fairer than any woman that Bran or any of the nobles
or notables present had ever seen. Her garb was strange; no woman of
that part of the country had ever worn a garb such as this woman had on.
In her hand she held a branch; white blossoms were on it, and a
fragrance came from them. She held the branch towards where Bran sat on
his high seat, and as she did the woman chanted this lay to him:

Crystal and silver  
The branch that to you I show:  
’Tis from a wondrous isle--  
Distant seas close it;<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>  
Glistening around it  
The sea-horses hie them:  
Emne of many shapes,  
Of many shades, that island.

They who that island near  
Mark a stone standing:  
From it a music comes,  
Unheard-of, enchanting.  
They who that music hear  
In clear tones answer--  
Hosts sing in choruses  
To its arising.

A folk that through ages long  
Know no decaying,  
No death nor sickness, nor  
A voice raised in wailing.  
Such games they play there--  
Coracle on wave-ways  
With chariot on land contends--  
How swift the race is!

Only in Emne is  
There such a marvel--  
Treason and wounding gone  
And sorrow of parting!  
Who to that island comes,  
And hears in the dawning  
The birds, shall know all delight,  
All through the ages!

To him, down from a height,  
Will come bright-clad women,  
Laughing and full of mirth--  
Lovely their coming!  
Freshness of blossom fills  
All the isle's mazes;  
Crystals and dragon-stones  
Are dropped in its ranges!

But all my song is not  
For all who have heard me; <span id="page_154">p. 154</span>  
Only for one it is:  
Bran, now bestir you!  
Heeding the message brought,  
In this, my word,  
Seeing the branch I show,  
Leave you a crowd.

She finished her lay; she held up the branch that was in her hand so
that Bran saw the blossoms upon it and felt the fragrance that came from
the blossoms. Then she was seen no more. Nor Bran nor any of the company
that were in the hall knew how she had gone from where she had been.

When Prince Bran went abroad the next day he heard music whether he
stood still or whether he walked on. A wide space was before him, and in
it he saw neither man nor woman. He went upon a mound; he stood there
and looked towards the sea. Still he could see no one, neither man nor
woman. And yet the music was around him; it quieted all stir within him;
he sat down upon the mound, and there he slept.

And in his sleep he saw the woman who had appeared with the branch in
her hand. "Arouse thee," she said to him in his dream. "Be no longer
unheeding, no longer unready. Launch thy ship upon the sea and sail on
until thou dost come to the island I sang to thee about."

So Bran made ready his ship. Thrice nine companions he took with him,
and over each of the nine he set one of his foster-brothers. They
launched the ship from an inlet in their own territory, and they sailed
their ship into the outer sea. For two days and two nights they saw only
the waves and the monsters of the deep around them. On the third day
they saw a sight that was stranger than the sight of any of the monsters
of the deep: they saw a chariot coming across the surface of the sea.

The chariot was driven by a man of resplendent appearance; the horses
yoked to it came on as if they were galloping over the surface of a
plain. When the chariot came near the ship the man who was in it reined
his horses and spoke to those who were sailing across the sea.

And this is what that resplendent charioteer said to Bran and

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

his companions, "Manannan MacLer, the Lord of the Sea, am I who speak to
thee. I go into your land to seek a queen who will bear a son to me; his
teacher I will be, and he shall be beloved by the mortal and the
immortal folk. He shall have wisdom and be able to disclose the
mysteries without fear. He shall be a dragon before the hosts of battle,
a wolf in the forest, an antlered stag upon the plain; he shall be a
salmon of changing hues in the river, a seal in the sea, a white swan
upon the shore; Mongan he shall be named." Then Manannan chanted a lay
to Bran, bidding him sail on, and telling him that he would soon come to
the islands where the immortal folk were.

Manannan went over the waves in his chariot, and Bran and his companions
sailed on. They came to an island from which a marvellous fragrance was
blowing. They saw blossoming trees that grew to the edge of the water.
They saw women upon the island, and they saw one who was a queen amongst
them. Bran knew the queen, for she was the one who had appeared to him
in his royal house, she was the one who had borne the branch with the
blossoms. The queen cried to him from the island, "Come, Prince Bran,
and land, for thou art welcome!"

But Bran and his companions were fearful of making a landing; they would
have sailed off. Then the queen threw a ball of thread towards the ship.
Bran caught it, and the thread held to the palm of his hand. The queen
kept the other end of the thread, and she began to wind it. As she wound
it she drew Bran and his ship to the island. Then Bran and his
companions landed.

They went into the high house that was upon the island. There were
couches there--couches enough for Bran and his companions. They were
entertained there by the queen and her women. The mariners took the
queen's women for their companions, and the queen was with Bran.

On the island were all the marvels of which the queen had chanted to
Bran when she stood in the doorway of his hall. And this island was one
of fifty islands, each one of them larger than Ireland. Silver-cloud
Plain. Plain of Sports, Bountiful Land, Gentle Land, were some of the
names that these islands bore. All who were on them lived without fear
of death, without treachery, without pain of parting.

Again the queen chanted a lay of the marvels of that land. She

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

chanted it to Bran as she stood beside him outside of her own high
house:

Age-old, and yet  
It bears the white blossom,  
This tree wherein  
Birds' songs are loud.  
Hear! with the hours  
The birds change their singing--  
But always 'tis gladness--  
Welcome their strain!

Look where the yellow-maned  
Horses are speeding!  
Look where the chariots  
Are turning and wheeling!  
Silver the chariots  
On the plain yonder;  
On the plain nigh us,  
Chariots of bronze!

And from our grounds,  
Cultivated, familiar,  
No sound arises  
But is tuned for our ear.  
Splendour of colour  
Is where spread the hazes;  
Drops hair of crystal  
From the waves' manes!

And of the many-coloured  
Land, Ildatach,  
We dream when slumber  
Takes us away.  
'Tis like the cloud  
That glistens above us,  
A crown of splendour  
On beauty's brow!

So it was on the island that was named Emne. But a day came when the
first of his foster-brothers said to Bran, "In Ireland the blossoms go
off the trees, and even the leaves are blown away. The ravens come with
the storms. But I am fain to see again the land to which

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

such changes come. Thou, Bran, didst bring us here. And if one of us
only should desire it, it is right that thou shouldst bring us back to
look upon our land again."

Bran knew that it was right that he should do this--that he should let
those who desired it look upon their own land again. He spoke to the
queen; he told her that he would have to bring the mariners to within
sight of the land of Ireland. Bitterly grieved was the queen when he
told her this. But she gave him permission to go. "Let no one," she
said, "neither you nor any of your companions set foot upon the ground
of your own country. And when you have looked upon that changing land,
return; come to me here in the Land of the Ever-living." Bran told her
that he would sail only to within sight of the land, and that when he
and his companions had looked upon it, they would turn their ship back.

The ship that had brought them to the island was still within a creek
there. Nothing had changed on the ship; not a tear was in a sail, not a
splinter was off an oar. The mariners went into the ship, and they
sailed off. When they had sailed a little way an island appeared before
them. They drew near to it, and they saw upon it a multitude of folk.
All were playing games, all were merry, all were laughing. Bran sent one
of his foster-brothers upon the island. They waited for him to return
with tidings from the people.

But they waited for him in vain. For no sooner had this foster-brother
of Bran's gone upon the shore than he joined in the sports of the
multitude; when he turned his face towards his fellows on the ship they
saw that he was laughing happily. Not for all the signals they made
would he return to them. Then Bran ordered his companions to sail on,
leaving this foster-brother of his on the Island of Merriment.

They sailed on; they sailed to where the seas became misty. They sailed
on and they saw the mist around Ireland. Then they sailed to that part
of the north where Prince Bran's territory was.

And when they were able to look upon that territory, they saw a throng
of people near the shore. There was an assembly there of the people of
the countryside. The mariners shouted to the people from the ship.
"Bran, the prince of this territory, his foster-brothers, and the men
who sailed with him are here," they cried.

"We know no one of that name," the spokesman of the people said,

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

"but in our old stories Prince Bran is spoken of as one who made a
voyage overseas."

When Bran heard that said he bade the mariners turn the ship away from
the shore. But the foster-brother who had desired so greatly to see the
land of Ireland sprang from the ship and dashed through the water to the
shore. The people went to where he landed and drew him amongst them. But
even as they touched him he fell upon the shingle.

The people drew away from that man. Those who were upon the ship saw him
lying there; as they looked upon him it seemed to them that he was like
one who had been dead and buried for an age.

Then Bran spoke from the ship to the people upon the shore. He told them
all that had befallen him and his companions since they had sailed from
that place--a wondrous story it was to those who heard him tell it. And
the learned who were amongst them wrote down in Ogham the chants that
Bran had heard from the queen of the island. Then he bade the people
farewell. He sailed back over the sea with his companions, and from that
day to this there has been neither tale nor tidings of Prince Bran.
