### THE STORY OF UTA-NAPISHTIM AND OF THE DELUGE THAT DESTROYED ALL THAT WAS ON THE EARTH

Now in the Temple there were tables on which were inscribed the history
of Uta-Napishtim the Remote, of him whom the Gods had made immortal.
These tables had the very words of Uta-Napishtim upon them. And these
are the words that were written there:

"I lived in Shurippak, the city of the sun, a city that was old, and had
the Gods dwelling in it. The Gods decided in their hearts to destroy
mankind by wind and by flood, so that none would be left living. on the
earth. Anu, the Father of the Gods, was there when this thing was
thought upon, and Enlil, the Warrior of the Gods, and En-urta, the
Messenger of the Gods. But the Gods considered again, and they decided
to leave living on the earth one man and his family.

"Ea went to the place where I was. He cried to me where I slept;

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

he cried to me to come out of my house and to build a ship; he cried to
me to abandon all my possessions and to save my life.

"He told me of the dimensions of the ship I was to build; he told me of
the measures of grain I was to take on board that ship. And he commanded
that I should go before the elders and people of the city and say to
them that Enlil bore ill-will towards them and that he was set upon
destroying them. Then I said to Ea, 'Whither shall I sail when I have
built the ship?', and he said, 'To the Gods. Trust thy ship upon the
flood and be not fearful.'

"I spoke to the elders and the people of the city. They but mocked me. I
gathered my servants around me and I began the building of the ship. I
made it a hundred and twenty cubits in length; I covered it with pitch
and bitumen; I provided a strong steering-pole for it. And when the ship
was built I loaded it with grain, and took my family on board it. The
beasts of the field and of the wilderness, also the birds came on board
it; they came in pairs. When all was made ready the God Shamash appeared
before me. He signified to me that at even-tide a great flood would be
loosed upon the earth.

"A rain-flood came at even-tide. I watched the darkness coming and the
storm. Terror possessed me as I watched. I went within where my family
were and the beasts and birds were in pairs, and I bolted down the
doors; yea, I bolted down the nine parts which I had made inside the
ship. I committed the ship and all that was on board of it to the mercy
of the Gods.

"Then a black cloud came up, and out of the black cloud and the
whirlwind the Gods thundered. The Star Gods of the Southern Sky
brandished their torches. Every gleam of light was turned to darkness.
Floods descended out of the heavens. The waters attacked mankind as in a
battle. Fathers no longer saw their children; brother no longer saw
brother. The rains descended until the waters mounted to the tops of the
hills. As they mounted up, the Gods themselves were filled with fright;
they went out of their own places; they went into the high heaven of
Anu. Ishtar, the Lady of the Gods, cried out like a woman in travail.
Yea, Ishtar lamented, crying against herself for speaking of this flood
in the presence of the Gods. The Gods of the Southern Sky wailed with
her, and for six days and six nights rain fell and the wind beat down
all that was upon the land.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

"But after the seventh day the raging flood ceased; the whirlwind and
the rain-storm ceased, and the waters no longer rose. I looked over the
waters; I saw that calm had come. Calm had come, but the land had been
laid out flat, and mankind had been turned to mud. I bowed myself down;
I fell upon my face and tears flowed down my cheeks. I looked to the
four quarters of the world and all that I saw was the open sea. Then for
twelve days the ship went on. The ship rested on the mountain of Nisir
and it moved no more.

"And when, after seven days, the ship still rested, I opened an air-hole
and light fell upon my face. I let a dove fly forth. The dove came back
to the ship for there was no place for her to light. I let a swallow fly
forth. The swallow also returned. I let a raven fly forth. The raven did
not return; she saw the land come up through the sinking waters; she
ate; she pecked on the ground; she croaked, and did not come back to me.

"Then I brought out all that was on board the ship; I brought all to
where the four winds blew. I offered up a sacrifice. I poured out a
libation where I stood upon the peak of the mountain. There Ishtar, the
Lady of the Gods, appeared before me; she cursed Bel for having brought
about the flood.

"The God Bel was wroth seeing that a portion of mankind had been saved
from the flood. He raged. He cried out, 'None shall be left alive; no
man shall be left living in this destruction! But the God En-urta
pleaded with Bel for mankind, and Bel relented. Then the God Ea went to
the ship, and took me by the hand, and brought me forth and brought my
wife forth; he turned our faces towards one another and made us kneel
together. He blessed us, saying, 'Formerly Uta-Napishtim and his wife
were mortals; now let Uta-Napishtim and his wife be like the Gods
themselves, having immortal life.'"

 

The tables having been read to the end, Gilgamish said, "How may I go to
where Uta-Napishtim is, and what is the way to his dwelling? I would go
to him whom the Gods have made undying and find out from him how a man
may save himself from going down into that abyss that is Irkalla's."

His mother said, "All that we know is that the dwelling-place of
Uta-Napishtim is beyond Mount Mashu, where the sun rises and sets."

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

Thereupon Gilgamish set out for Mount Mashu. In the foothills of the
mountains he was attacked by lions; he killed many of the lions, but
others followed him almost till he had reached the top of the mountain.
And when he came nigh to the top of the mountain he saw the dread
guardians of the place where the sun rises and sets. They were the
Scorpion Men, and they were fearful even to look upon. And Gil. garnish
said when he saw them, "Would that Enkidu, my friend, were with me now,
for only with his help might I overcome the guardians here, the glance
of whose eyes makes me tremble." He went on; he came before the dread
guardians of the mountain-top, and he, even Gilgamish, bowed himself
humbly before them.

The Scorpion Men said, one to the other, "The bodies of those who come
this way we devour, but behold! the man who comes towards us has flesh
that is two-thirds flesh of the Gods. We may not devour his body." With
voices that made shake the rocks of the mountain-top they bade Gilgamish
pass by. And they cried out to him that he was entering into a region of
darkness, and that no one who had gone that way had ever come out of
that darkness.

And, lo! Even as they spoke Gilgamish went into the darkness. The sight
of the sky and the mountain was cut off from him. The darkness became
thicker and heavier as he went on; no mortal had ever gone through
darkness such as this darkness. For a space that was equal to a day and
a night, Gilgamish went on, went through a deep and deeper darkness. He
thought that the light would never come into his eyes again. And then he
came into a place where there was light. He saw bright daylight all
round him. He saw before him a garden that was filled with bright
flowers and glowing fruits.

 

This was the place and this was the garden of the Goddess Siduri-Sabitu.
In the garden was the Tree of the Gods: Siduri-Sabitu guarded it.
Gilgamish saw the Goddess. Siduri-Sabitu sat upon a throne beside the
sea. She said to him:

"Who are you who come to this Place with wasted cheeks, and with face
bowed down?

"Your heart is sad; your form is dejected, and lamentation is in your
heart! None such as you come here, to the garden in which is the Tree of
the Gods."

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

She ordered her servants to close the gate of the garden against him.
Gilgamish laid hands upon the gate and he shook it so that its
foundations rocked. He said to the Goddess, "I go to where Uta-Napishtim
the Remote is, to Uta-Napishtim, my ancestor."

She spoke to him from her throne while his hands were still upon the
gate, making its foundations rock. And he said to her, "I am Gilgamish,
and Enkidu, who was my friend, has become like the dust. The fate of my
friend lies heavily upon me, and therefore do I travel this way so that
I may speak with my ancestor, Uta-Napishtim, and be rid of my fear of
death. O Sabitu, thou who sittest by the sea, and hast charge of the
gate, speak to me, and tell me the way to the land where Uta-Napishtim
abides. Give to me a description of the way. If it be possible, I will
cross the sea to come to his country. If it be impossible to cross the
sea, I will cross over the land, even if it be a land that darkness
rests upon."

Then the Goddess Siduri-Sabitu, the guardian of the gate, knowing that
two-thirds of his flesh was as the flesh of the Gods, made answer to
Gilgamish. She said to him, "The sea that I sit beside and that thou
dost look upon is the Waters of Death. None have crossed these waters
heretofore save Shamash, the Sun God."

"I would cross these waters," Gilgamish said.

Said Siduri-Sabitu, sitting on her throne beside the sea, "There is a
Ferryman, Ur-Shanabi, who crosses this water. Find him, and may. hap he
will ferry thee across to where Uta-Napishtim is."

He waited by the sea until he saw the Ferryman, Ur-Shanabi. He went into
his boat. For fifty days and nights they voyaged across the Waters of
Death, and the Ferryman warned Gilgamish not to touch with his hand the
waters they passed over. They reached the limits of the Waters of Death;
they came to the land where Gilgamish's ancestor, Uta-Napishtim, had his
abode.

 

Uta-Napishtim the Remote walked with his wife by the waters. He saw the
boat of Ur-Shanabi coming towards him. He, astonished that another
beside Ur-Shanabi was in the boat, waited by the shore.

Gilgamish came out of the boat, and he went to the two figures that
stood by themselves. Uta-Napishtim knew his descendant, and he spoke
kindly to Gilgamish.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

Then Gilgamish told him of what had happened to him in the world of men;
he told how his friend Enkidu had been taken from him, becoming as dust,
he who had been like the panther of the desert, he who had aided him to
destroy the Bull of Heaven. "Shall not I myself also be obliged to lay
me down and never rise up to all eternity?" he cried to Uta-Napishtim.
And again he cried, "I was horribly afraid. I was afraid of death, and
therefore have I fled from my own country." But Uta-Napishtim the Remote
made answer to Gilgamish, and he said, "None may find out the day of
their death, for Mammitum, the Arranger of Destinies, has settled it,
and none knows but Mammitum."

And as Uta-Napishtim spoke Gilgamish ate and refreshed himself. Having
refreshed himself he lay in the boat and drowsiness overpowered him; he
fell into a slumber. Then Uta-Napishtim said to his wife, "Behold the
one who would find immortality; he cannot keep drowsiness away from
him." Gilgamish slept. For six days the wife of Uta-Napishtim baked
bread and laid it beside him. On the seventh day when she brought him
bread, she touched him, and Gilgamish wakened up.

Then all day he questioned Uta-Napishtim about the ways of escaping
death. Uta-Napishtim told him that at the bottom of the sea that he had
crossed, and in the middle of it, there grew a plant, and that he who
ate of it nine days after it had been gathered would escape death.
Having told him this, Uta-Napishtim told the Ferryman to make ready to
take Gilgamish back across the Waters of Death.

The Ferryman made ready; the wife of Uta-Napishtim gave Gilgamish bread
to last him for his journey across. When they came to the middle of the
sea, Gilgamish fastened stones to his feet and let himself sink down in
the water. He found the plant that grew at the bottom of the sea, and,
rejoicing, he gathered it. He went into the boat and they came to a land
under the mountain. The land was pleasant, and Gilgamish rested himself
there. Not yet had come the time for him to eat the plant he had
gathered.

A serpent smelled the plant and came to where Gilgamish was. Now
Gilgamish would bathe in the water of a pool, for he needed the
refreshment of water. He went into the pool. And while he was in the
pool the serpent came upon the plant and ate it--yea, ate all of

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

the plant. Then was Gilgamish left without that which would have given
him escape from death. He wept, and the spirit of Enkidu came before
him, and told him of the Land of the Dead and of how men fared who
entered into it.
