### HOW MA-UI STROVE TO WIN IMMORTALITY FOR ALL CREATURES

A time came when Ma-ui, returning to his home, said to his father, "Who
now can vanquish me? I have won fire for men; I have made the sun go
more slowly across the heavens; I have fished up the islands from the
bottom of the sea. What thing in the world can vanquish me?" His father
showed Ma-ui where the sky and the horizon met. Flashes were to be seen
there. "They are from the teeth of the Goblin Goddess,
Great-Hina-of-the-Night," he told Ma-ui. "She is your great ancestress.
She vanquishes all creatures, for she brings all creatures to death. She
will vanquish you, my child." Then Ma-ui said, "Let us both go to her
fearlessly; let us take the heart out of her body, and so end her power
of bringing death to all creatures." But his father would not go to
where Great-Hina-of-the-Night was.

Ma-ui called for companions, and the little birds of every kind
assembled to go with him--the robin and the lesser robin, the thrush and
the yellow-hammer and the water-wagtail. With the little birds Ma-ui
went towards where the sky and the horizon met. They went in the
evening, and as they went they saw the flashing of the teeth of the
Goblin Goddess. Her teeth were of volcanic glass. Her mouth was
wide-shaped, like the mouth of a fish. Her hair floated all around her
as sea-weed floats in the sea. Her eyes shone through the distances.

He saw her and was afraid; even great Ma-ui was made afraid by the
Goblin Goddess, Great-Hina-of-the-Night. But he remembered that he had
told his companions that he would find a way of giving everlasting life
to men and to all creatures. He thought and thought on how he could come
to her and take the heart out of her body.

She was sleeping, and Ma-ui prepared to enter her terrible open mouth
and take the heart out of her body and give her heart to all the
creatures of the earth to eat.

Then he said to the birds, "O my little companions, do not laugh, do not
make a sound, when you see me go into the mouth of this Goblin Goddess.
Laugh, make sounds if you will when you see me come out bearing the
heart of my ancestress, Great-Hina-of-the-Night." The little birds that
gathered around him, shivering, said, "Oh, our brave master, we will not
laugh, we will not make a sound. But, oh, take care of yourself,
Master."

Ma-ui twisted the string of his weapon around his waist. He stripped his
clothes off. The skin of his legs and hips was mottled like that of a
mackerel from the tattoo-marks that had been cut upon it by the chisel
of Uetonga. He stood there naked, and then he went within the jaws of
Great-Hina-of-the-Night. He passed the fearful teeth that were sharp
like volcanic glass. He went down into her stomach. He seized upon her
heart. He drew it out, and he came back as far as her jaws. He saw the
sky beyond her jaws.

A little bird that often laughed tried hard not to laugh when it saw him
go within the jaws of the Goblin Goddess. It twisted up its mouth to
prevent its laughing. And then it laughed--little Ti-waka-waka, the
water-wagtail--laughed its merry note. The Goblin Goddess opened her
eyes. She started up. She caught Ma-ui between her fearful teeth, and
she tore him across. There was darkness then, and the crying of all the
birds. Thus died Ma-ui with the Meat of Immortality in his hands. And
since his death no one has ventured near the lair of Hina-nui-te-po, the
Goblin Goddess.
