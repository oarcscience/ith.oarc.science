I have called the collection "Orpheus," naming it after the minstrel
who, according to the poet of the Argonautica, sang "how the earth, the
heaven, and the sea once mingled together in one form, after deadly
strife were separated each from the other; and how the stars and the
moon and the paths of the sun ever keep their fixed place in the sky;
and how the mountains rose, and how the resounding rivers with their
nymphs came into being, and all creeping things." <span
