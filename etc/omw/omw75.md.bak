### PE-LE, HAWAII'S GODDESS OF VOLCANIC FIRE

### I

Pe-le, the Goddess, came up out of her pit in Ki-lau-ea. No longer would
she sit on the lava-hearth below, with skin rugged and blackened, with
hair the colour of cinders, and with reddened eyes; no

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

longer would she seem a hag whom no man would turn towards. She came up
out of the pit a most lovely woman. Her many sisters were at her side,
and each of them was only less lovely than was Pe-le upon that day. They
stood each side of her because it was forbidden to come behind the
Goddess or to lay a hand upon her burning back.

Pe-le and her sisters stood on the crater's edge. Around them was the
blackened plain, but below them was Puna, with the surf breaking upon
its beach, and with its lehua groves all decked with scarlet blossoms.
This land was Pe-le's. She had made it and she had the power to destroy
it. She had power in the heavens, too, for her flames reached up to the
skies. All the Gods--even the great Gods, Ku, Ka-ne, Ka-neloa, and
Lono--were forced to follow her when she left Kahiki, the land beyond
the vastness of the ocean, and came to Hawaii. Ki-lau-ea on Hawaii's
island was the home she had chosen. And now she came out of the pit, and
she said to her many sisters, "Come, let us go down to the beach at
Puna, and bathe, and feast, and enjoy ourselves." Her sisters rejoiced,
and they went down with her to the beach.

And when they had bathed and feasted, and had sported themselves in the
water and along the beach, Pe-le went into a cavern and laid herself
down to sleep. She said to the sister who was always beside her, to the
sister who was named Hi-i-aka-of-the-fire-bloom, "Let me sleep until I
awake of my own accord. If any of you should attempt to awaken me
before, it will be death to you all. But if it has to be that one of you
must awaken me, call the youngest of our sisters,
Hi-i-aka-of-the-bosom-of-Pele, and let her bring me out of sleep." So
Pe-le said, and she lay in the cavern and slept. Her sisters said to
each other, "How strange that the havoc-maker should sleep so deeply and
without a bed-fellow!" By turns they kept watch over her as she slept in
the cavern.

But the youngest of her sisters, the little Hi-i-aka, was not by her
when she spoke before going to sleep. Little Hi-i-aka had gone to where
the groves of lehua showed their scarlet blossoms. She was enchanted
with the trees that she went amongst; she gathered the blossoms and wove
them into wreaths. And then she saw another girl gathering blossoms and
weaving them into wreaths, and she knew this other girl for the
tree-spirit, Ho-po-e. And Ho-po-e, seeing Hi-i-aka, danced for her.
These two became friends; they danced for each other, and they

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

played together, and never had Hi-i-aka, the little sister of the dread
Goddess, known a friend that was as dear and as lovely as
Ho-po-e--Ho-po-e whose life was in the grove of lehuas.

As for Pe-le, the Goddess, she slept in the cavern, and in her sleep she
heard the beating of a drum. It sounded like a drum that announces a
hula. Her spirit went from where she slept; her spirit-body followed the
sound of that drum. Over the sea her spirit-body followed that sound.
Her spirit-body went to the Island of Kauai. There she came to a hall
sacred to Laka: a hula was being performed there. As a most lovely woman
Pe-le entered that hall. All the people who were assembled for the hula
turned to look upon her. And in that hall Pe-le saw Prince Lo-hi-au.

He was seated on a dais, and his musicians were beside him. Pe-le,
advancing through the hall filled with wondering people, went to where
he was. Prince Lo-hi-au had her sit beside him; he had tables spread to
feast her. Pe-le would not eat. "And yet she must have come from a very
great distance," the people around her said, "for if a woman so
beautiful lived on this island, we would surely have heard her spoken
about." Prince Lo-hi-au would not eat either; his mind was altogether on
the beautiful woman who sat on the dais beside him.

When the hula was over he took her into his house. But although they
were beside each other on the mat, Pe-le would not permit him to caress
her. She let him have kisses, but kisses only. She said to him, "When I
bring you to Hawaii you shall possess me and I shall possess you." He
tried to grasp her and hold her, but she rose in her spirit-body and
floated away, leaving the house, leaving the island, crossing the sea,
and coming back to where her body lay in the cavern in Puna.

Prince Lo-hi-au sought wildly for the woman who had been with him; he
sought for her in the night, in the dark night of the ghosts. And
because it seemed to him that she was for ever gone, he went back into
his house, and took his loin-cloth off, and hanged himself with it from
the ridge-pole of the house. In the morning his sister and his people
came into the house and found the chieftain dead. Bitterly they bewailed
him; bitterly they cursed the woman who had been with him and who had
brought him to his death. Then

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

they wrapped the body in robes of tapa and laid it in a cavern of the
mountain-side.

In Puna, in a cavern, Pe-le's body lay, seemingly in deep sleep. For a
day and a night, and a night and a day it lay like this. None of her
sisters dared try to awaken Pe-le. But at last they became frightened by
the trance that lasted so long. They would have their youngest sister,
Hi-i-aka, awaken the Woman of the Pit. At the end of another day they
sent for her.

And Hi-i-aka saw the messenger coming for her as she stood in the grove
of lehua trees with her dear and lovely friend, Ho-po-e, beside her. She
watched the messenger coming for her, and she chanted the me-le:

From the forest-land at Papa-lau-ahi,  
To the garlands heaped at Kua-o-ka-la,  
The lehua trees are wilted,  
Scorched, burnt up--  
Consumed are they by fire--  
By the fire of the Woman of the Pit.

\[paragraph continues\] But Ho-po-e, her friend, said, "It is not true
what you chant. See! Our lehuas are neither wilted nor burnt up. If they
were I would no longer be able to see you nor to speak with you. Why,
then, do you lament? You will stay with me, and we shall gather more
blossoms for garlands." But Hi-i-aka said, "Even as I saw the messenger
who is coming to take me away from you, I saw our trees destroyed by
Pe-le's fires."

Then the messenger came to them, and told Hi-i-aka that she was to
return to where she had left her sisters. She took farewell of Ho-po-e
and went to where her sisters awaited her. They brought her within the
cavern, and they showed her Pe-le lying there, without colour, without
stir. Then Hi-i-aka, the youngest of her sisters, went to Pe-le's body
and chanted over it. And the spirit-body that had been hovering over the
prostrate body entered into it. The breath entered the lungs again;
Pe-le's bosom rose and fell; colour came into her face. Then the Woman
of the Pit stretched her body; she rose up, and she spoke to her
sisters.

They left that place; they went back into Pe-le's dwelling-place, into
the pit of Ki-lau-ea. Then, after a while, Pe-le spoke to her sisters,

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

one after the other. She said to each of them, "Will you be my messenger
and fetch our lover--yours and mine from Kauai?" None of the elder
sisters would go; each one understood how dangerous such a mission would
be. But when Pe-le spoke to Hi-i-aka, the youngest of her sisters, the
girl said, "Yes, I will go, and I will bring back the man."

Her sisters were dismayed to hear Hi-i-aka say this. The journey was
long, and for anyone who would go on the mission that Pe-le spoke of the
danger was great. Who could tell what fit of rage and hatred might come
over the Woman of the Pit--rage and hatred against the one who would be
with the man she would have for her lover? And Hi-i-aka who had agreed
to go upon such a mission was the youngest and the least experienced of
all of them. They tried to warn her against going; but they dared not
speak their thought out to her. Besides, they knew that Hi-i-aka was so
faithful to Pe-le, her chieftain and her elder sister, that she would
face every danger at her request.

Then said Pe-le to Hi-i-aka, "When you have brought our lover here, for
five days and five nights he shall be mine. After that he shall be your
lover. But until I have lifted the tapu you must not touch him, you must
not caress him, you must not give him a kiss. If you break this tapu it
shall be death to you and to Prince Lo-hi-au." Her sisters made signs to
her, and Hi-i-aka delayed her departure. She stood before Pe-le again,
and Pe-le reproached her for her dilatoriness. But now Hi-i-aka spoke to
her elder sister and chieftainess and said, "I go to bring a lover to
you while you stay at home. But, going, I make one condition. If you
must break out in fire and make raids while I am gone, raid the land
that we both own, but do not raid where the lehua groves are; do not
harm my friend Ho-po-e, whose life is in the lehua groves." She said
this, and she started on her journey. But now the length of the journey
and its dangers came before her and made her afraid. She saw herself,
alone and powerless, going upon that long way. Once again she returned
to where the Woman of the Pit sat. She asked that she be given a
companion for the journey. She asked that a portion of Pe-le's mana, or
magic power, be given her. Pe-le did not deny her this: she called upon
the Sun and the Moon, the Stars, the Wind, the Rain, the Lightning and
Thunder to give aid to

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

her sister and her messenger. And now that mana was bestowed on her,
Hi-i-aka started on the way that led across islands and over seas to the
house of the man whom her sister desired--her sister, Pe-le, the dread
Fire Goddess.
