# 11. ROGER BACON: AN APPRECIATION

IT has been said that "a prophet is not without honour, save in his own
country." Thereto might be added, "and in his own time"; for, whilst
there is continuity in time, there is also evolution, and England of
to-day, for instance, is not the same country as England of the Middle
Ages. In his own day ROGER BACON was accounted a magician, whose
heretical views called for suppression by the Church. And for many a
long day afterwards was he mainly remembered as a co-worker in the black
art with Friar BUNGAY, who together with him constructed, by the aid of
the devil and diabolical rites, a brazen head which should possess the
power of speech--the experiment only failing through the negligence of
an assistant..\[1\] Such was ROGER BACON in the memory of the later
Middle Ages and many succeeding years; he was the typical alchemist,

particulars see Sir J. E. SANDYS' essay on "Roger Bacon  
in English Literature," in Roger Bacon Essays (1914),  
referred to below.

where that term carries with it the depth of disrepute, though indeed
alchemy was for him but one, and that not the greatest, of many
interests.

Ilchester, in Somerset, claims the honour of being the place of ROGER
BACON'S birth, which interesting and important event occurred, probably,
in 1214. Young BACON studied theology, philosophy, and what then passed
under the name of "science," first at Oxford, then the centre of liberal
thought, and afterwards at Paris, in the rigid orthodoxy of whose
professors he found more to criticise than to admire. Whilst at Oxford
he joined the Franciscan Order, and at Paris he is said, though this is
probably an error, to have graduated as Doctor of Theology. During
1250-1256 we find him back in England, no doubt engaged in study and
teaching. About the latter year, however, he is said to have been
banished--on a charge of holding heterodox views and indulging in
magical practices--to Paris, where he was kept in close confinement and
forbidden to write. Mr LITTLE,\[1\] however, believes this to be an
error, based on a misreading of a passage in one of BACON'S works, and
that ROGER was not imprisoned, but stricken with sickness. At any rate
it is not improbable that some restrictions as to his writing were
placed on him by his superiors of the Franciscan Order. In 1266 BACON
received a letter from Pope CLEMENT asking him to send His Holiness his
works in writing without delay. This letter came as a most pleasant
surprise to BACON; but he had nothing of importance written, and in
great haste and excite-

and Works," to Roger Bacon Essays.

ment, therefore, he composed three works explicating his philosophy, the
Opus Majus, the Opus Minus, and the Opus Tertium, which were completed
and dispatched to the Pope by the end of the following year. This, as Mr
ROWBOTTOM remarks, is "surely one of the literary feats of history,
perhaps only surpassed by Swedenborg when he wrote six theological and
philosophical treatises in one year."\[1\]

The works appear to have been well received. We next find BACON at
Oxford writing his Compendium Studii Philosophiae, in which work he
indulged in some by no means unjust criticisms of the clergy, for which
he fell under the condemnation of his order, and was imprisoned in 1277
on a charge of teaching "suspected novelties". In those days any
knowledge of natural phenomena beyond that of the quasi-science of the
times was regarded as magic, and no doubt some of ROGER BACON'S
"suspected novelties" were of this nature; his recognition of the value
of the writings of non-Christian moralists was, no doubt, another
"suspected novelty". Appeals for his release directed to the Pope proved
fruitless, being frustrated by JEROME D'ASCOLI, General of the
Franciscan Order, who shortly afterwards succeeded to the Holy See under
the title of NICHOLAS IV. The latter died in 1292, whereupon RAYMOND
GAUFREDI, who had been elected General of the Franciscan Order, and who,
it is thought, was well disposed towards BACON, because of certain
alchemical secrets the latter had revealed to him, ordered his release.
BACON returned to Oxford, where he wrote

\[1\]B. R. ROWBOTTOM: "Roger Bacon," The Journal of the  
Alchemical Society, vol. ii. (1914), p. 77.

his last work, the Compendium Studii Theologiae. He died either in this
year or in 1294.\[1\]

It was not until the publication by Dr SAMUEL JEBB, in 1733, of the
greater part of BACON'S Opus Majus, nearly four and a half centuries
after his death, that anything like his rightful position in the history
of philosophy began to be assigned to him. But let his spirit be no
longer troubled, if it were ever troubled by neglect or slander, for the
world, and first and foremost his own country, has paid him due honour.
His septcentenary was duly celebrated in 1914 at his alma mater, Oxford,
his statue has there been raised as a memorial to his greatness, and
savants have meted out praise to him in no grudging tones.\[2\] Indeed,
a voice has here and there been heard depreciating his better-known
namesake FRANCIS,\[3\] so that the later luminary should not, standing
in the way, obscure the light of the earlier; though, for my part, I
would suggest that one need not be so one-eyed as to fail to see both
lights at once.

be of interest that the septcentenary of the discoverer of gunpowder
should have coincided with the outbreak of the greatest war under which
the world has yet groaned, even though gunpowder is no longer employed
as a military propellant.

BACON'S reference to gunpowder occurs in his Epistola de Secretis
Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae (Hamburg, 1618) a
little tract written against magic, in which he endeavours to show, and
succeeds very well in the first eight chapters, that Nature and art can
perform far more extraordinary feats than are claimed by the workers in
the black art. The last three chapters are written in an alchemical
jargon of which even one versed in the symbolic language of alchemy can
make no sense. They are evidently cryptogramic, and probably deal with
the preparation and purification of saltpetre, which had only recently
been discovered as a distinct body.\[1\] In chapter xi. there is
reference to an explosive body, which can only be gunpowder; by means of
it, says BACON, you may, "if you know the trick, produce a bright flash
and a thundering noise." He mentions two of the ingredients, saltpetre
and sulphur, but conceals the third (i.e. charcoal) under an anagram.
Claims have, indeed, been put forth for the Greek, Arab, Hindu, and
Chinese origins of gunpowder, but a close examination of the original
ancient accounts purporting to contain references to gunpowder,

\[1\]For an attempted explanation of this cryptogram, and  
evidence that BACON was the discoverer of gunpowder,

Ammunition: their Origin and Progress (1904).

shows that only incendiary and not explosive bodies are really dealt
with. But whilst ROGER BACON knew of the explosive property of a mixture
in right proportions of sulphur, charcoal, and pure saltpetre (which he
no doubt accidentally hit upon whilst experimenting with the last-named
body), he was unaware of its projective power. That discovery, so
detrimental to the happiness of man ever since, was, in all probability,
due to BERTHOLD SCHWARZ about 1330.

ROGER BACON has been credited\[1\] with many other discoveries. In the
work already referred to he allows his imagination freely to speculate
as to the wonders that might be accomplished by a scientific utilisation
of Nature's forces--marvellous things with lenses, in bringing distant
objects near and so forth, carriages propelled by mechanical means,
flying machines . . . --but in no case is the word "discovery" in any
sense applicable, for not even in the case of the telescope does BACON
describe means by which his speculations might be realised.

On the other hand, ROGER BACON has often been maligned for his beliefs
in astrology and alchemy, but, as the late Dr BRIDGES (who was quite
sceptical of the claims of both) pointed out, not to have believed in
them in BACON'S day would have been rather an evidence of mental
weakness than otherwise. What relevant facts were known supported
alchemical and astrological hypotheses. Astrology, Dr BRIDGES writes,
"conformed to the first law of Comte's

\[1\]For instance by Mr M. M. P. MUIR. See his contribution,  
on "Roger Bacon: His Relations to Alchemy and Chemistry,"  
to Roger Bacon Essays.

philosophia prima, as being the best hypothesis of which ascertained
phenomena admitted."\[1\] And in his alchemical speculations BACON was
much in advance of his contemporaries, and stated problems which are
amongst those of modern chemistry.

ROGER BACON'S greatness does not lie in the fact that he discovered
gunpowder, nor in the further fact that his speculations have been
validated by other men. His greatness lies in his secure grip of
scientific method as a combination of mathematical reasoning and
experiment. Men before him had experimented, but none seemed to have
realised the importance of the experimental method. Nor was he, of
course, by any means the first mathematician--there was a long line of
Greek and Arabian mathematicians behind him, men whose knowledge of the
science was in many cases much greater than his--or the most learned
mathematician of his day; but none realised the importance of
mathematics as an organon of scientific research as he did; and he was
assuredly the priest who joined mathematics to experiment in the bonds
of sacred matrimony. We must not, indeed, look for precise rules of
inductive reasoning in the works of this pioneer writer on scientific
method. Nor do we find really satisfactory rules of induction even in
the works of FRANCIS BACON. Moreover, the latter despised mathematics,
and it was not until in quite recent years that the scientific world
came to realise that ROGER'S method is the more fruitful-- witness the
modern revolution in chemistry produced by the adoption of mathematical
methods.

\[181\] Op. cit., p.84.

ROGER BACON, it may be said, was many centuries in advance of his time;
but it is equally true that he was the child of his time; this may
account for his defects judged by modern standards. He owed not a little
to his contemporaries: for his knowledge and high estimate of philosophy
he was largely indebted to his Oxford master GROSSETESTE (c. 1175-1253),
whilst PETER PEREGRINUS, his friend at Paris, fostered his love of
experiment, and the Arab mathematicians, whose works he knew, inclined
his mind to mathematical studies. He was violently opposed to the
scholastic views current in Paris at his time, and attacked great
thinkers like THOMAS AQUINAS (c. 1225-1274) and ALBERTUS MAGNUS
(1193-1280), as well as obscurantists, such as ALEXANDER of HALES (ob.
1245). But he himself was a scholastic philosopher, though of no servile
type, taking part in scholastic arguments. If he declared that he would
have all the works of ARISTOTLE burned, it was not because he hated the
Peripatetic's philosophy--though he could criticise as well as
appreciate at times,--but because of the rottenness of the translations
that were then used. It seems commonplace now, but it was a truly
wonderful thing then: ROGER BACON believed in accuracy, and was by no
means destitute of literary ethics. He believed in correct translation,
correct quotation, and the acknowledgment of the sources of one's
quotations--unheard-of things, almost, in those days. But even he was
not free from all the vices of his age: in spite of his insistence upon
experimental verification of the conclusions of deductive reasoning, in
one place, at least, he adopts a view concerning lenses from another
writer, of which the simplest attempt at such verification would have
revealed the falsity. For such lapses, however, we can make allowances.

Another and undeniable claim to greatness rests on ROGER BACON'S
broad-mindedness. He could actually value at their true worth the moral
philosophies of non-Christian writers--SENECA (c. 5 B.C.-A.D. 65) and AL
GHAZZALI (1058 -1111), for instance. But if he was catholic in the
original meaning of that term, he was also catholic in its restricted
sense. He was no heretic: the Pope for him was the Vicar of CHRIST, whom
he wished to see reign over the whole world, not by force of arms, but
by the assimilation of all that was worthy in that world. To his
mind--and here he was certainly a child of his age, in its best sense,
perhaps--all other sciences were handmaidens to theology, queen of them
all. All were to be subservient to her aims: the Church he called
"Catholic" was to embrace in her arms all that was worthy in the works
of "profane" writers--true prophets of God, he held, in so far as
writing worthily they unconsciously bore testimony to the truth of
Christianity,--and all that Nature might yield by patient experiment and
speculation guided by mathematics. Some minds see in this a defect in
his system, which limited his aims and outlook; others see it as the
unifying principle giving coherence to the whole. At any rate, the
Church, as we have seen, regarded his views as dangerous, and restrained
his pen for at least a considerable portion of his life.

ROGER BACON may seem egotistic in argument, but his mind was humble to
learn. He was not superstitious, but he would listen to common folk who
worked with their hands, to astrologers, and even magicians, denying
nothing which seemed to him to have some evidence in experience: if he
denied much of magical belief, it was because he found it lacking in
such evidence. He often went astray in his views; he sometimes failed to
apply his own method, and that method was, in any case, primitive and
crude. But it was the right method, in embryo at least, and ROGER BACON,
in spite of tremendous opposition, greater than that under which any man
of science may now suffer, persisted in that method to the end, calling
upon his contemporaries to adopt it as the only one which results in
right knowledge. Across the centuries--or, rather, across the gulf that
divides this world from the next--let us salute this great and noble
spirit.
