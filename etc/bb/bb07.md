# 6 THE BELIEF IN TALISMANS

THE word "talisman" is derived from the Arabic "tilsam," "a magical
image," through the plural form "tilsamen." This Arabic word is itself
probably derived from the Greek in its late meaning of "a religious
mystery" or "consecrated object". The term is often employed to
designate amulets in general, but, correctly speaking, it has a more
restricted and special significance. A talisman may be defined briefly
as an astrological or other symbol expressive of the influence and power
of one of the planets, engraved on a sympathetic stone or metal (or
inscribed on specially prepared parchment) under the auspices of this
planet.

Before proceeding to an account of the preparation of talismans proper,
it will not be out of place to notice some of the more interesting and
curious of other amulets. All sorts of substances have been employed as
charms, sometimes of a very unpleasant nature, such as dried toads.
Generally, however, amulets consist of stones, herbs, or passages from
Sacred Writings written on paper. This latter class are sometimes called
"characts," as an example of which may be mentioned the Jewish
phylacteries.

Every precious stone was supposed to exercise its own peculiar virtue;
for instance, amber was regarded as a good remedy for throat troubles,
and agate was thought to preserve from snake-bites. ELIHU RICH\[1\]
gives a very full list of stones and their supposed virtues. Each sign
of the zodiac was supposed to have its own particular stone\[2\] (as
shown in the annexed table), and hence the superstitious though not
inartistic custom of wearing one's birth-

\[1\]ELIHU RICH: The Occult Sciences (Encyclop¾dia  
Metropolitana, 1855), pp. 348 et seq.  
\[2\]With regard to these stones, however, there is much  
confusion and difference of opinion. The arrangement  
adopted in the table here given is that of CORNELIUS  
AGRIPPA (Occult Philosophy, bk. ii.). A comparatively  
recent work, esteemed by modern occultists, namely, The  
Light of Egypt, or the Science of the Soul and the Stars  
(1889), gives the following scheme:--

<span id="img_2bybe"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/2bybe.jpg)

Common superstitious opinion regarding birth-stones, as  
reflected, for example, in the "lucky birth charms" exhibited  
in the windows of the jewellers' shops, considerably diverges  
in this matter from the views of both these authorities.  
The usual scheme is as follows: --  
Jan.=Garnet.  
Feb.=Amethyst  
Mar.=Bloodstone  
Apr.=Diamond.  
May=Emerald.  
June=Agate.  
July=Ruby.  
Aug.=Sardonyx.  
Sept.=Sapphire  
Oct.=Opal.  
Nov.=Topaz  
Dec.=Turquoise.  
The bloodstone is frequently assigned either to Aries or  
Scorpio, owing to its symbolical connection with Mars;  
and the opal to Cancer, which in astrology is the  
constellation of the moon. Confusion is rendered still worse  
by the fact that the ancients whilst in some cases using the  
same names as ourselves, applied them to different stones;  
thus their "hyacinth" is our "sapphire," whilst their  
"sapphire" is our "lapis lazuli".

stone for "luck". The belief in the occult powers of certain stones is
by no means non-existent at the present day; for even in these
enlightened times there are not wanting those who fear the beautiful
opal, and put their faith in the virtues of New Zealand green-stone.

Certain herbs, culled at favourable conjunctions of the planets and worn
as amulets, were held to be very efficacious against various diseases.
Precious stones and metals were also taken internally for the same
purpose--"remedies" which in certain cases must have proved exceedingly
harmful. One theory put forward for the supposed medical value of
amulets was the Doctrine of Effluvia. This theory supposes the amulets
to give off vapours or effluvia which penetrate into the body and effect
a cure. It is, of course, true that certain herbs, etc., might, under
the heat of the body, give off such effluvia, but the theory on the
whole is manifestly absurd. The Doctrine of Signatures, which we have
already encountered in our excursions,\[1\] may also be mentioned in
this connection as a complementary and equally untenable hypothesis.

According to ELIHU RICH,\[2\] the following were the commonest Egyptian
amulets:--

1\. Those inscribed with the figure of Serapis, used to preserve against
evils inflicted by earth.  
2. Figure of Canopus, against evil by water.  
3. Figure of a hawk, against evil from the air.  
4. Figure of an asp, against evil by fire.

PARACELSUS believed there to be much occult virtue in an alloy of the
seven chief metals, which he called Electrum. Certain definite
proportions of these metals had to be taken, and each was to be added
during a favourable conjunction of the planets. From this electrum he
supposed that valuable amulets and magic mirrors could be prepared.

A curious and ancient amulet for the cure of various diseases,
particularly the ague, was a triangle formed of the letters of the word
"Abracadabra." The usual form was that shown in fig. 19, and that

\[1\]See "Medicine and magic."  
\[2\]Op. Cit., p. 343.

shown in fig. 20 was also known. The origin of this magical word is lost
in obscurity.

The belief in the horn as a powerful amulet, especially prevalent in
Italy, where is it the custom of the common people to make the sign of
the mano cornuto to avoid the consequence of the dreaded

<span id="img_3bybe"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/3bybe.jpg)

jettatore or evil eye, can be traced to the fact that the horn was the
symbol of the Goddess of the Moon. Probably the belief in the powers of
the horse-shoe\[1\] had a similar origin. Indeed, it seems likely that
not only this, but most other amulets, like talismans proper--as will
appear below,--were originally designed as appeals to gods and other
powerful spiritual beings.

\[1\]See FREDERICK T. ELWORTHY'S Horns of  
Honour (1900), especially pp. 56 et seq.

To turn our attention, however, to the art of preparing talismans
proper: I may remark at the outset that it was necessary for the
talisman to be prepared by one's own self--a task by no means easy as a
rule. Indeed, the right mental attitude of the occultist was insisted
upon as essential to the operation.

As to the various signs to be engraver on the talismans, various
authorities differ, though there are certain points connected with the
art of talismanic magic on which they all agree. It so happened that the
ancients were acquainted with seven metals and seven planets (including
the sun and moon as planets), and the days of the week are also seven.
It was concluded, therefore, that there was some occult connection
between the planets, metals, and days of the week. Each of the seven
days of the week was supposed to be under the auspices of the spirits of
one of the planets; so also was the generation in the womb of Nature of
each of the seven chief metals.

In the following table are shown these particulars in detail:--

<span id="img_4bybe"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/4bybe.jpg)

Consequently, the metal of which a talisman was to be made, and also the
time of its preparation, had to be chosen with due regard to the planet
under which it was to be prepared.\[1\] The power of such a talisman was
thought to be due to the genie of this planet--a talisman, was, in fact,
a silent evocation of an astral spirit. Examples of the belief that a
genie can be bound up in an amulet in some way are afforded

\[1\]In this connection a rather surprising discovery made by Mr W.  
GORN OLD (see his A Manual of Occultism, 1911, pp. 7 and 8)  
must be mentioned. The ancient Chaldeans appear invariably to  
have enumerated the planets in the following order: Saturn, Jupiter,  
Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon --which order was adopted by the  
mediaeval astrologers. Let us commence with the Sun in the above  
sequence, and write down every third planet; we then have--  
Sun . . . . Sunday.  
Moon . . . . Monday.  
Mars . . . . Tuesday.  
Mercury . . . . Wednesday.  
Jupiter . . . . Thursday.  
Venus . . . . Friday.  
Saturn . . . . Saturday.  
That is to say, we have the planets in the order in which they were  
supposed to rule over the days of the week. This is perhaps, not so  
surprising, because it seems probable that, each day being first  
divided into twenty-four hours, it was assumed that the planets  
ruled for one hour in turn, in the order first mentioned above. Each  
day was then named after the planet which ruled during its first hour.  
It will be found that if we start with the Sun and write down every  
twenty-fourth planet, the result is exactly the same as if we write
down  
every third. But Mr OLD points out further, doing so by means of a  
diagram which seems to be rather cumbersome that if we start with  
Saturn in the first place, and write down every fifth planet, and then  
for each planet substitute the metal over which it was supposed to
rule,  
we then have these metals arranged in descending order of atomic
weights,  
thus:--  
Saturn . . . . Lead (=207).  
Mercury . . . . Mercury (=200).  
Sun . . . . Gold (=197).  
Jupiter . . . . Tin (=119).  
Moon . . . . Silver (=108).  
Venus . . . . Copper (=64).  
Mars . . . . Iron (=56).  
Similarly we can, starting from any one of these orders, pass to the  
other two. The fact is a very surprising one, because the ancients  
could not possibly have been acquainted with the atomic weights  
of the metals, and, it is important to note, the order of the
densities  
of these metals, which might possibly have been known to them,  
is by no means the same as the order of their atomic weights.  
Whether the fact indicates a real relationship between the planets  
and the metals, or whether there is some other explanation, I am not  
prepared to say. Certainly some explanation is needed: to say that the  
fact is mere coincidence is unsatisfactory, seeing that the odds
against,  
not merely this, but any such regularity occurring by chance--as  
calculated by the mathematical theory of probability--are 119 to 1.

by the story of ALADDIN'S lamp and ring and other stories in the
Thousand and One Nights. Sometimes the talismanic signs were engraved on
precious stones, sometimes they were inscribed on parchment; in both
cases the same principle held good, the nature of the stone chosen, or
the colour of the ink employed, being that in correspondence with the
planet under whose auspices the talisman was prepared.

All the instruments employed in the art had to be specially prepared and
consecrated. Special robes had to be worn, perfumes and incense burnt,
and invocations, conjurations, etc., recited, all of which depended on
the planet ruling the operation. A description of a few typical
talismans in detail will not here be out of place.

In The Key of Solomon the King (translated by S.L.M. MATHERS, 1889)\[1\]
are described five, six, or

\[1\]The Clavicula Salomonis, or Key of Solomon the King,  
consists mainly of an elaborate ritual for the evocation of the  
various planetary spirits, in which process the use of talismans  
or pentacles plays a prominent part. It is claimed to be a work  
of white magic, but, inasmuch as it, like other old books  
making the same claim, gives descriptions of a pentacle for  
causing ruin, destruction, and death, and another for causing  
earthquakes--to give only two examples,--the distinction between  
black and white magic, which we shall no doubt encounter again  
in later excursions, appears to be somewhat arbitrary.  
Regarding the authorship of the work, Mr MATHERS, translator  
and editor of the first printed copy of the book, says, "I see no
reason  
to doubt the tradition which assigns the authorship of the 'Key' to  
King Solomon." If this view be accepted, however, it is abundantly  
evident that the Key as it stands at present (in which we find S. JOHN  
quoted, and mention made of SS. PETER and PAUL) must have  
received some considerable alterations and additions at the hands of
later  
editors. But even if we are compelled to assign the Clavicula
Salomonis  
in its present form to the fourteenth or fifteenth century, we must, I  
think, allow that it was based upon traditions of the past, and, of
course,  
the possibility remains that it might have been based upon some
earlier  
work. With regard to the antiquity of the planetary sigils, Mr MATHERS  
notes "that, among the Gnostic talismans in the British Museum, there  
is a ring of copper with the sigils of Venus, which are exactly the
same  
as those given by mediaeval writers on magic."  
In spite of the absurdity of its claims, viewed in the light of modern  
knowledge, the Clavicula Salomonis exercised a considerable influence  
in the past, and is to be regarded as one of the chief sources of
mediaeval  
ceremonial magic. Historically speaking, therefore, it is a book of no  
little importance.

seven talismans for each planet. Each of these was supposed to have its
own peculiar virtues, and many of them are stated to be of use in the
evocation of spirits. The majority of them consist of a central design
encircled by a verse of Hebrew Scripture.

<span id="img_fig21"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/fig21.jpg)

The central designs are of a varied character, generally geometrical
figures and Hebrew letters or words, or magical characters. Five of
these talismans are here portrayed, the first three described differing
from the above. The translations of the Hebrew verses, etc., given below
are due to Mr MATHERS.

The First Pentacle of the Sun.--"The Countenance of Shadda• the
Almighty, at Whose aspect all creatures obey, and the Angelic Spirits do
reverence on bended knees." About the face is the name "El Shaddai".
Around is written in Latin: "Behold His face and form by Whom all things
were made, and Whom all creatures obey" (see fig. 21).

<span id="img_fig22"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/fig22.jpg)

The Fifth Pentacle of Mars.--"Write thou this Pentacle upon virgin
parchment or paper because it is terrible unto the Demons, and at its
sight and aspect they will obey thee, for they cannot resist its
presence." The design is a Scorpion,\[1\] around which the word Hvl is
repeated. The Hebrew versicle

\[1\]In astrology the zodiacal sign of the Scorpion is the  
"night house" of the planet Mars.

is from Psalm xci. 13: "Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder, the young
lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet" (see fig. 22).

The Third Pentacle of the Moon.--"This being duly borne with thee when
upon a journey, if it be

<span id="img_fig23"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/fig23.jpg)

properly made, serveth against all attacks by night, and against every
kind of danger and peril by Water." The design consists of a hand and
sleeved forearm (this occurs on three other moon talismans), together
with the Hebrew names Aub and Vevaphel. The versicle is from Psalm xl.
13: Be pleased O IHVH to deliver me, O IHVH make haste to help me" (see
fig 23).

The Third Pentacle of Venus.--"This, if it be only shown unto any
person, serveth to attract love. Its Angel Monachiel should be invoked
in the day and hour of Venus, at one o'clock or at eight." The design
consists of two triangles joined at their apices,

<span id="img_fig24"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/fig24.jpg)

with the following names--IHVH, Adonai, Ruach, Achides, AEgalmiel,
Monachiel, and Degaliel. The versicle is from Genesis i. 28: "And the
Elohim blessed them, and the Elohim said unto them, Be ye fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it" (see fig. 24).

The Third Pentacle of Mercury.--"This serves to invoke the Spirits
subject unto Mercury; and especially those who are written in this
Pentacle." The design consists of crossed lines and magical characters
of Mercury. Around are the names of the angels, Kokaviel, Ghedoriah,
Savaniah, and Chokmahiel (see fig. 25).

<span id="img_fig25"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/fig25.jpg)

CORNELIUS AGRIPPA, in his Three Books of Occult Philosophy, describes
another interesting system of talismans. FRANCIS BARRETT'S Magus, or
Celestial Intelligencer, a well-known occult work published in the first
year of the nineteenth century, I may mention, copies AGRIPPA'S system
of talismans, without acknowledgment, almost word for word. To each of
the planets is assigned a magic square or able, i.e. a square composed
of numbers so arranged that the sum of each row or column is always the
same. For example, the table for Mars is as follows:--

<span id="img_5bybe"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/5bybe.jpg)

It will be noticed that every number from 1 up to the highest possible
occurs once, and that no number occurs twice. It will also be seen that
the sum of each row and of each column is always 65. Similar squares can
be constructed containing any square number of figures, and it is,
indeed, by no means surprising that the remarkable properties of such
"magic squares," before these were explained mathematically, gave rise
to the belief that they had some occult significance and virtue. From
the magic squares can be obtained certain numbers which are said to be
the numbers of the planets; their orderliness, we are told, reflects the
order of the heavens, and from a consideration of them the magical
properties of the planets which they represent can be arrived at. For
example, in the above table the number of rows of numbers is 5. The
total number of numbers in the table is the square of this number,
namely, 25, which is also the greatest number in the table. The sum of
any row or column is 65. And, finally, the sum of all the numbers is the
product of the number of rows (namely, 5) and the sum of any row
(namely, 65), i.e. 325. These numbers, namely, 5, 25, 65, and 325, are
the numbers of Mars. Sets of numbers for the other planets are obtained
in exactly the same manner.\[1\]

Now to each planet is assigned an Intelligence or good spirit, and an
Evil Spirit or demon; and the names of these spirits are related to
certain of the numbers of the planets. The other numbers are also
connected with holy and magical Hebrew names. AGRIPPA, and BARRETT
copying him, gives the following table of "names answering to the
numbers of Mars":--

<span id="img_6bybe"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/6bybe.jpg)

Similar tables are given for the other planets. The numbers can be
derived from the names by regarding the Hebrew letters of which they are
composed as numbers, in which case X (Aleph) to X (Teth) represent the
units 1 to 9 in order, X (Jod) to X (Tzade) the tens 10 to 90 in order,
X (Koph) to X (Tau) the hundreds 100 to 400, whilst the hundreds 500 to
900 are represented by special terminal forms of certain of the Hebrew
letters.\[2\] It is evident that

\[1\]Readers acquainted with mathematics will notice that  
if n is the number of rows in such a "magic square," the  
other numbers derived as above will be n&lt;2S,  
1/2n(n&lt;2S+1), and 1/2n&lt;2S(n&lt;2S+1). This can  
readily be proved by the laws of arithmetical progressions.  
Rather similar but more complicated and less uniform  
"magic squares" are attributed to PARACELSUS.  
\[2\]It may be noticed that this makes XXXXXX equal to  
326, one unit too much. Possibly an Aleph should be  
omitted.

<span id="img_fig26to29"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/fig26to29.jpg)

no little wasted ingenuity must have been employed in working all this
out.

Each planet has its own seal or signature, as well as the signature of
its intelligence and the signature of its demon. These signatures were
supposed to represent the characters of the planets' intelligences and
demons respectively. The signature of Mars is shown in fig. 26, that of
its intelligence in fig. 27, and that of its demon in fig. 28.

These various details were inscribed on the talismans each of which was
supposed to confer its own peculiar benefits--as follows: On one side
must be engraved the proper magic table and the astrological sign of the
planet, together with the highest planetary number, the sacred names
corresponding to the planet, and the name of the intelligence of the
planet, but not the name of its demon. On the other side must be
engraved the seals of the planet and of its intelligence, and also the
astrological sign. BARRETT says, regarding the demons:\[1\] "It is to be
understood that the intelligences are the presiding good angels that are
set over the planets; but that the spirits or daemons, with their names,
seals, or characters, are never inscribed upon any Talisman, except to
execute any evil effect, and that they are subject to the intelligences,
or good spirits; and again, when the spirits and their characters are
used, it will be more conducive to the effect to add some divine name
appropriate to that effect which we desire." Evil talismans can also be
prepared, we are informed, by using a metal antagonistic to the

\[1\]FRANCIS BARRETT: The Magus, or  
Celestial Intelligencer (1801), bk. i. p. 146.

signs engraved thereon. The complete talisman of Mars is shown in fig.
29.

ALPHONSE LOUIS CONSTANT,\[1\] a famous French occultist of the
nineteenth century, who wrote under the name of "ELIPHAS LEVI,"
describes yet another system of talismans. He says: "The Pentagram must
be always engraved on one side of the talisman, with a circle for the
Sun, a crescent for the Moon, a winged caduceus for Mercury, a sword for
Mars, a G for Venus, a crown for Jupiter, and a scythe for Saturn. The
other side of the talisman should bear the sign of Solomon, that is, the
six-pointed star formed by two interlaced triangles; in the centre there
should be placed a human figure for the sun talismans, a cup for those
of the Moon, a dog's head for those of Jupiter, a lion for those of
Mars, a dove's for those of Venus, a bull's or goat's for those of
Saturn. The names of the seven angels should be added either in Hebrew,
Arabic, or magic characters similar to those of the alphabets of
Trimethius. The two triangles of Solomon may be replaced by the double
cross of Ezekiel's wheels, this being found on a great number of ancient
pentacles. All objects of this nature, whether in metals or in precious
stones, should be carefully wrapped in silk satchels of a colour
analogous to the spirit of the planet, perfumed with the perfumes of the
corresponding day, and preserved from all impure looks and
touches."\[2\]

ELIPHAS LEVI, following PYTHAGORAS and many

\[1\] For a biographical and critical account of this  
extraordinary personage and his views, see Mr A. E.  
WAITE'S The Mysteries of Magic: a Digest of the  
writings of ELIPHAS LEVI (1897). \[2\] Op. cit.,  
p. 201.

<span id="img_fig30to31"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/fig30to31.jpg)

of the mediaeval magicians, regarded the pentagram, or five-pointed
star, as an extremely powerful pentacle. According to him, if with one
horn in the ascendant it is the sign of the microcosm--Man. With two
horns in the ascendant, however, it is the sign of the Devil, "the
accursed Goat of Mendes," and an instrument of black magic. We can,
indeed, trace some faint likeness between the pentagram and the outline
form of a man, or of a goat's head, according to whether it has one or
two horns in the ascendant respectively, which resemblances may account
for this idea. Fig. 30 shows the pentagram embellished with other
symbols according to ELIPHAS LEVI, whilst fig. 31 shows his embellished
form of the six-pointed star, or Seal of SOLOMON. This, he says, is "the
sign of the Macrocosmos, but is less powerful than the Pentagram, the
microcosmic sign," thus contradicting PYTHAGORAS, who, as we have seen,
regarded the pentagram as the sign of the Macrocosm. ELIPHAS LEVI
asserts that he attempted the evocation of the spirit of APOLLONIUS of
Tyana in London on 24th July 1854, by the aid of a pentagram and other
magical apparatus and ritual, apparently with success, if we may believe
his word. But he sensibly suggests that probably the apparition which
appeared was due to the effect of the ceremonies on his own imagination,
and comes to the conclusion that such magical experiments are injurious
to health.\[1\]

Magical rings were prepared on the same principle as were talismans.
Says CORNELIUS AGRIPPA: "The manner of making these kinds of Magical
Rings is this,

\[1\]Op. cit., pp. 446-450.

viz.: When any Star ascends fortunately, with the fortunate aspect or
conjunction of the Moon, we must take a stone and herb that is under
that Star, and make a ring of the metal that is suitable to this Star,
and in it fasten the stone, putting the herb or root under it--not
omitting the inscriptions of images, names, and characters, as also the
proper suffumigations...."\[1\] SOLOMON'S ring was supposed to have been
possessed of remarkable occult virtue. Says JOSEPHUS (c. A.D. 37-100):
"God also enabled him \[SOLOMON\] to learn that skill which expels
demons, which is a science useful and sanative to men. He composed such
incantations also by which distempers are alleviated. And he left behind
him the manner of using exorcisms, by which they drive away demons, so
that they never return; and this method of cure is of great force unto
this day; for I have seen a certain man of my own country, whose name
was Eleazar, releasing people that were demoniacal in the presence of
Vespasian, and his sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude of
his soldiers. The manner of the cure was this; he put a ring that had
under the seal a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon, to the
nostrils of the demoniac, after which he drew out the demon through his
nostrils: and when the man fell down immediately, he abjured him to
return unto him no more, making still mention of Solomon, and reciting
the incantations which he composed."\[2\]

Enough has been said already to indicate the general nature of
talismanic magic. No one could maintain otherwise than that much of it
is pure nonsense; but the subject should not, therefore, be dismissed as
valueless, or lacking significance. It is past belief that amulets and
talismans should have been believed in for so long unless they appeared
to be productive of some of the desired results, though these may have
been due to forces quite other than those which were supposed to be
operative. Indeed, it may be said that there has been no widely held
superstition which does not embody some truth, like some small specks of
gold hidden in an uninviting mass of quartz. As the poet BLAKE put it:
"Everything possible to be believ'd is an image of truth";\[1\] and the
attempt may here be made to extract the gold of truth from the quartz of
superstition concerning talismanic magic. For this purpose the various
theories regarding the supposed efficacy of talismans must be examined.

Two of these theories have already been noted, but the doctrine of
effluvia admittedly applied only to a certain class of amulets, and, I
think, need not be seriously considered. The "astral-spirit theory" (as
it may be called), in its ancient form at any rate, is equally untenable
to-day. The discoveries of new planets and new metals seem destructive
of the belief that there can be any occult connection between planets,
metals, and the days of the week, although the curious fact discovered
by Mr OLD, to which I have referred (footnote, p. 63), assuredly demands
an explanation, and a certain validity may, perhaps,

\[1\] "Proverbs of Hell" (The Marriage of Heaven  
and Hell).

be allowed to astrological symbolism. As concerns the belief in the
existence of what may be called (although the term is not a very happy
one) "discarnate spirits," however, the matter, in view of the modern
investigation of spiritistic and other abnormal psychical phenomena,
stands in a different position. There can, indeed, be little doubt that
very many of the phenomena observed at spiritistic seances come under
the category of deliberate fraud, and an even larger number, perhaps,
can be explained on the theory of the subconscious self. I think,
however, that the evidence goes to show that there is a residuum of
phenomena which can only be explained by the operation, in some way, of
discarnate intelligences.\[1\] Psychical research may be said to have
supplied the modern world with the evidence of the existence of
discarnate personalities, and of their operation on the material plane,
which the ancient world lacked. But so far as our present subject is
concerned, all the evidence obtainable goes to show that the phenomena
in question only take place in the presence of what is called "a
medium"--a person of peculiar nervous or psychical organisation. That
this is the case, moreover, appears to be the general belief of
spiritists on the subject. In the sense, then, in which "a talisman"
connotes a material object of such a nature that by its aid the powers
of discarnate intel-

\[1\] The publications of The Society for Psychical Research,  
and FREDERICK MYERS' monumental work on Human  
Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death, should be  
specially consulted. I have attempted a brief discussion of

Spirit, and the Cosmos (1910), chap. ii.

ligences may become operative on material things, we might apply the
term "talisman" to the nervous system of a medium: but then that would
be the only talisman. Consequently, even if one is prepared to admit the
whole of modern spiritistic theory, nothing is thereby gained towards a
belief in talismans, and no light is shed upon the subject.

Another theory concerning talismans which commended itself to many of
the old occult philosophers, PARACELSUS for instance, is what may be
called the "occult force" theory. This theory assumes the existence of
an occult mental force, a force capable of being exerted by the human
will, apart from its usual mode of operation by means of the body. It
was believed to be possible to concentrate this mental energy and infuse
it into some suitable medium, with the production of a talisman, which
was thus regarded as a sort of accumulator for mental energy. The theory
seems a fantastic one to modern thought, though, in view of the many
startling phenomena brought to light by psychical research, it is not
advisable to be too positive regarding the limitations of the powers of
the human mind. However, I think we shall find the element of truth in
the otherwise absurd belief in talismans by means of what may be called,
not altogether fancifully perhaps, a transcendental interpretation of
this "occult force" theory. I suggest, that is, that when a believer
makes a talisman, the transference of the occult energy is ideal, not
actual; that the power, believed to reside in the talisman itself, is
the power due to the reflex action of the believer's mind. The power of
what transcendentalists call "the imagination" cannot be denied; for
example, no one can deny that a man with a firm conviction that such a
success will be achieved by him, or such a danger avoided, will be far
more likely to gain his desire, other conditions being equal, than one
of a pessimistic turn of mind. The mere conviction itself is a factor in
success, or a factor in failure, according to its nature; and it seems
likely that herein will be found a true explanation of the effects
believed to be due to the power of the talisman.

On the other hand, however, we must beware of the exaggerations into
which certain schools of thought have fallen in their estimates of the
powers of the imagination. These exaggerations are particularly marked
in the views which are held by many nowadays with regard to
"faith-healing," although the "Christian Scientists" get out of the
difficulty--at least to their own satisfaction--by ascribing their
alleged cures to the Power of the Divine Mind, and not to the power of
the individual mind.

Of course the real question involved in this "transcendental theory of
talismans" as I may, perhaps, call it, is that of the operation of
incarnate spirit on the plane of matter. This operation takes place only
through the medium of the nervous system, and it has been
suggested,\[1\] to avoid any violation of the law of the conservation of
energy, that it is effected, not by the transference, as is sometimes
supposed, of energy from the spiritual to the material plane, but merely
by means of directive control over the expenditure of energy derived by
the body from purely

\[1\]Cf Sir OLIVER LODGE: Life and Matter (1907),  
especially chap. ix.; and W. HIBBERT, F.I.C.: Life  
and Energy (1904).

physical sources, e.g. the latent chemical energy bound up in the food
eaten and the oxygen breathed.

I am not sure that this theory really avoids the difficulty which it is
intended to obviate;\[1\] but it is at least an interesting one, and at
any rate there may be modes in which the body, under the directive
control of the spirit, may expend energy derived from the material
plane, of which we know little or nothing. We have the testimony of many
eminent authorities\[2\] to the phenomenon of the movement of physical
objects without contact at spiritistic seances. It seems to me that the
introduction of discarnate intelligences to explain this phenomenon is
somewhat gratuitous--the psychic phenomena which yield evidence of the
survival of human personality after bodily death are of a different
character. For if we suppose this particular phenomenon to be due to
discarnate spirits, we must, in view of what has been said concerning
"mediums," conclude that the movements in question are not produced by
these spirits directly, but through and by means of the nervous system
of the medium present. Evidently, therefore, the means for the
production of the phenomenon reside in the human nervous system (or, at
any rate, in the peculiar nervous system of "mediums"), and all that is
lacking is intelligence

\[1\] The subject is rather too technical to deal with here.  
I have discussed it elsewhere; see "Thermo-Dynamical  
Objections to the Mechanical Theory of Life," The  
Chemical News, vol. cxii. pp. 271 et seq. (3rd  
December 1915).

or initiative to use these means. This intelligence or initiative can
surely be as well supplied by the sub-consciousness as by a discarnate
intelligence. Consequently, it does not seem unreasonable to suppose
that equally remarkable phenomena may have been produced by the aid of
talismans in the days when these were believed in, and may be produced
to-day, if one has sufficient faith--that is to say, produced by man
when in the peculiar condition of mind brought about by the intense
belief in the power of a talisman. And here it should be noted that the
term "talisman" may be applied to any object (or doctrine) that is
believed to possess peculiar power or efficacy. In this fact, I think,
is to be found the peculiar danger of erroneous doctrines which promise
extraordinary benefits, here and now on the material plane, to such as
believe in them. Remarkable results may follow an intense belief in such
doctrines, which, whilst having no connection whatever with their
accuracy, being proportional only to the intensity with which they are
held, cannot do otherwise than confirm the believer in the validity of
his beliefs, though these may be in every way highly fantastic and
erroneous. Both the Roman Catholic, therefore, and the Buddhist may
admit many of the marvels attributed to the relics of each other's
saints; though, in denying that these marvels prove the accuracy of each
other's religious doctrines, each should remember that the same is true
of his own.

In illustration of the real power of the imagination, I may instance the
Maori superstition of the Taboo. According to the Maories, anyone who
touches a tabooed object will assuredly die, the tabooed object being a
sort of "anti-talisman". Professor FRAZER\[1\] says: "Cases have been
known of Maories dying of sheer fright on learning that they had
unwittingly eaten the remains of a chief's dinner or handled something
that belonged to him," since such objects were, ipso facto, tabooed. He
gives the following case on good authority: "A woman, having partaken of
some fine peaches from a basket, was told that they had come from a
tabooed place. Immediately the basket dropped from her hands and she
cried out in agony that the atua or godhead of the chief, whose divinity
had been thus profaned, would kill her. That happened in the afternoon,
and next day by twelve o'clock she was dead." For us the power of the
taboo does not exist; for the Maori, who implicitly believes in it, it
is a very potent reality, but this power of the taboo resides not in
external objects but in his own mind.

Dr HADDON\[2\] quotes a similar but still more remarkable story of a
young Congo negro which very strikingly shows the power of the
imagination. The young negro, "being on a journey, lodged at a friend's
house; the latter got a wild hen for his breakfast, and the young man
asked if it were a wild hen. His host answered 'No.' Then he fell on
heartily, and afterwards proceeded on his journey. After four years
these two met together again, and his old friend asked him 'if he would
eat a wild hen,' to which he answered that it was tabooed to

him. Hereat the host began immediately to laugh, inquiring of him, 'What
made him refuse it now, when he had eaten one at his table about four
years ago?' At the hearing of this the negro immediately fell
a-trembling, and suffered himself to be so far possessed with the
effects of imagination that he died in less than twenty-four hours
after."

There are, of course, many stories about amulets, etc., which cannot be
thus explained. For example, ELIHU RICH gives the following:--

"In 1568, we are told (Transl. of Salverte, p. 196) that the Prince of
Orange condemned a Spanish prisoner to be shot at Juliers. The soldiers
tied him to a tree and fired, but he was invulnerable. They then
stripped him to see what armour he wore, but they found only an amulet
bearing the figure of a lamb (the Agnus Dei, we presume). This was taken
from him, and he was then killed by the first shot. De Baros relates
that the Portuguese in like manner vainly attempted to destroy a Malay,
so long as he wore a bracelet containing a bone set in gold, which
rendered him proof against their swords. A similar marvel is related in
the travels of the veracious Marco Polo. 'In an attempt of Kublai Khan
to make a conquest of the island of Zipangu, a jealousy arose between
the two commanders of the expedition, which led to an order for putting
the whole garrison to the sword. In obedience to this order, the heads
of all were cut off excepting of eight persons, who by the efficacy of a
diabolical charm, consisting of a jewel or amulet introduced into the
right arm, between the skin and the flesh, were rendered secure from the
effects of iron, either to kill or wound. Upon this discovery being
made, they were beaten with a heavy wooden club, and presently
died.'"\[1\] I think, however, that these, and many similar stories,
must be taken cum grano salis.

In conclusion, mention must be made of a very interesting and suggestive
philosophical doctrine--the Law of Correspondences,--due in its explicit
form to the Swedish philosopher, who was both scientist and mystic,
EMANUEL SWEDENBORG. To deal in any way adequately with this important
topic is totally impossible within the confines of the present
discussion.\[2\] But, to put the matter as briefly as possible, it may
be said that SWEDENBORG maintains (and the conclusion, I think, is
valid) that all causation is from the spiritual world, physical
causation being but secondary, or apparent--that is to say, a mere
reflection, as it were, of the true process. He argues from this,
thereby supplying a philosophical basis for the unanimous belief of the
nature-mystics, that every natural object is the symbol (because the
creation) of an idea or spiritual verity in its widest sense. Thus,
there are symbols which are inherent in the nature of things, and
symbols which are not. The former are genuine, the latter merely
artificial. Writing from the transcendental point of view, ELIPHAS LEVI
says: "Ceremonies, vestments, perfumes, characters and figures being . .
. necessary to enlist the imagination in the education of the will, the
success of magical works depends upon the faithful observance of all the
rites, which are in no sense

Theory of Spirit (1912), chap. i., for a more  
adequate statement.

fantastic or arbitrary, having been transmitted to us by antiquity, and
permanently subsisting by the essential laws of analogical realisation
and of the correspondence which inevitably connects ideas and forms."80
Some scepticism, perhaps, may be permitted as to the validity of the
latter part of this statement, and the former may be qualified by the
proviso that such things are only of value in the right education of the
will, if they are, indeed, genuine, and not merely artificial, symbols.
But the writer, as I think will be admitted, has grasped the essential
point, and, to conclude our excursion, as we began it, with a
definition, I will say that the power of the talisman is the power of
the mind (or imagination) brought into activity by means of a suitable
symbol.
