# XVI. THE HORSE-SHOE AS A PHALLIC SYMBOL

It will suffice merely to allude to the theory of the phallic origin of
the superstitious use of the horse-shoe, a branch of our subject capable
of much elaboration. The horse-shoe is still the conventional figure for
the yoni (a phallic emblem) in modern Hindu temples. This theory is
discussed in "Ancient Faiths embodied in Ancient Names," by Thomas
Inman, M. D., London, 1873; and in "A Discourse on the Worship of
Priapus," by Richard Payne Knight, Esq., London, 1865.

Phallic ornaments are of great antiquity, and amulets of this character
have been found in the earliest Etruscan tombs. Specimens are also to be
seen in the various Italian museums.

The yoni symbol guards the entrances of ancient temples in Mexico and
Peru, as well as in India.

Ornate Mexican sacred stones of the horse-shoe form, relics of the
ancient Maya tribes, are classed in the National Museum at Washington,
D. C., as representative of fecundity and nature-worship; and horse-shoe
symbols are found in Aztec manuscripts relating to agriculture as signs
of abundance.

Phallic charms are seen above the entrances of houses and over
tent-doors in north Africa to avert the evil eye, and to bring health
and good fortune. Much information on this subject may be found in a
chapter on serpent and phallic worship in "Rivers of Life," by Major
General J. G. R. Forlong, London, 1883; and in an essay on "Phallism in
Ancient Religions," by C. Staniford Wake, 1888.

On a curious tablet found near a prehistoric mound in the vicinity of
the village of Cahokia, Saint Clair County, Illinois, are portrayed
human faces with bird-like profiles, diamond-shaped eyes, and low
foreheads surmounted by ornamental crowns or head-dresses. The mouths
are wide open, and in front of them are represented symbols having a
well-defined horse-shoe form. These symbols, although probably of
phallic origin, are thought to signify the principle of life residing in
the breath, just as in India the horse-shoe is an emblem of the soul.
