# III. THE LATIN WORD "SAL"

Owing to the importance of salt as a relish, its Latin name sal came to
be used metaphorically as signifying a savory mental morsel, and, in a
general sense, wit or sarcasm. It was formerly maintained by some
etymologists that this word had a threefold meaning according to its
gender. Thus, when masculine, it has the above signification, but when
feminine it means the sea, and only when neuter does it stand for common
salt. The characterization of Greece as "the salt of nations" is
attributed to Livy, and this is probably the origin of the phrase "Attic
salt," meaning delicate, refined wit. The phrase cum grano salis may
signify the grain of common sense with which one should receive a
seemingly exaggerated report. It may also mean moderation, even as salt
is used sparingly as a seasoner of food.

Among the ancients, as with ourselves, Sol and sal, the Sun and salt,
were known to be two things essential to the maintenance of life.

Soldiers, officials, and working people were paid either wholly or in
part in salt, which was in such general use for this purpose that any
sum of money paid for labor or service of whatever kind was termed a
salarium, or salary, that is, the wherewithal to obtain one's salt.

Pliny remarked that salt was essential for the complete enjoyment of
life, and in confirmation of this statement he commented on the fact
that the word sales was employed to express the pleasures of the mind,
or a keen appreciation of witty effusions, and, therefore, was
associated with the idea of good fellowship and mirth.

A certain mystic significance has been attributed to the three letters
composing the word "sal." Thus, the letter S, standing alone, represents
or suggests two circles united together, the sun and the moon. It
typifies, moreover, the union of things divine and mundane, even as salt
partakes of the attributes of each. A, alpha, signifies the beginning of
all things; while L is emblematic of something celestial and glorious. S
and L represent solar and lunar influences respectively, and the trio of
letters stand for an essential substance provided by God for the benefit
of his people. In a curious treatise on salt, originally published in
1770, the writer launches forth in impassioned style the most
extravagant encomiums upon this substance, which he avers to be the
quintessence of the earth. Salt is here characterized as a Treasure of
Nature, an Essence of Perfection, and the Paragon of Preservatives.
Moreover, whoever possesses salt thereby secures a prime factor of human
happiness among material things.

The French people employ the word "salt" metaphorically in several
common expressions. Thus, in speaking of the lack of piquancy or
pointedness in a dull sermon or address, they say, "There was no salt in
that discourse." And of the brilliant productions of a favorite author
they remark, "He has sprinkled his writings with salt by handfuls." In
like manner they use the term un epigramme salé to denote a cutting
sarcasm or raillery. Very apt also is the following definition by an old
English writer: "Salt, a pleasaunt and merrie word that maketh folks to
laugh and sometime pricketh." The expression "to salt an invoice"
signifies to increase the full market value of each article, and
corresponds to one use of the French verb saler, to overcharge, and
hence to "fleece" or "pluck." Thus the phrase Il me l'a bien salé means
"He has charged me an excessive price."
