# PREFACE

THE Study of the origin and history of popular customs and beliefs
affords an insight, otherwise unattainable, into the operations of the
human mind in early times. Superstitions, however trivial in themselves,
relics of paganism though they be, and oftentimes comparable to baneful
weeds, are now considered proper subjects for scientific research. While
the ignorant savage is a slave to many superstitious fancies which
dominate his every action, the educated man strives to be free from such
a bondage, yet recognizes as profitable the study of those same beliefs.
The heterogeneous character of the material drawn from so many sources
has rendered it difficult, if not impossible, to follow any distinctly
systematic treatment of the subject. However, the development in recent
years of a widespread interest in all branches of folk-lore warrants the
hope that any volume devoted to this subject, and representing somewhat
diligent research, may have a certain value, in spite of its
imperfections. The expert folk-lorist may find much to criticise; but
this book, treating of popular beliefs, is intended for popular reading.
It has been the writer's aim to make the chapter on the Horse-Shoe as
exhaustive as possible, as this attractive symbol of superstition does
not appear to have received hitherto the attention which it merits. This
chapter is the outgrowth of a paper read at the seventh annual meeting
of the American Folk-Lore Society, at Philadelphia, December 28, 1895,
an abstract of which appeared in the Society's Journal for December,
1896.

Extended quotations are indicated by smaller type.
