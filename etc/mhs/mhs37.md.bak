# VI. HELPING TO SALT AT TABLE

In the northern counties of England, and indeed quite generally in
Anglican communities, it is reckoned unlucky to be helped to salt at
table, and this idea has found expression in the popular couplet, "Help
me to salt, help me to sorrow." In a small volume entitled "The Rules of
Civility" (London, 1695), translated from the French, and quoted in
"Brand's Popular Antiquities," is the following passage:--

Some are so exact they think it uncivil to help anybody that sits by
them either with salt or brains. But in my judgment that is a ridiculous
scruple, and if your neighbor desires you to furnish him (with salt),
you must either take out some with your knife and lay it upon his plate,
or if they be more than one, present them with the salt that they may
furnish themselves.

In Russia there is a superstitious prejudice against helping one's
neighbor to salt at table on account of the liability to quarrels
thereby incurred. For in so doing one is thought to have the air of
implying, "Well, you have received your allowance of salt, now go away."
But if in proffering the salt one smiles amicably, all danger of a
quarrel is happily averted, and the act is wholly relieved of its
ominous character.

The simple expedient of a second help is commonly regarded as equally
effective for this purpose, but it is difficult to imagine whence was
derived the alleged potency of such an antidote, which is contrary to
the Pythagorean theory of the divine character of unity and the
diabolical attributes of the number two.

In many lands, however, it is only common courtesy to help a friend to
salt at table; but in Italy this delicate attention was formerly thought
to be a mark of undue familiarity, and, when salt was offered by one
gentleman to the wife of another, it was a sufficient cause for jealousy
and even quarrel.
