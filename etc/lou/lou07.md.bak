### CHAPTER V

### THE TREASURE OF HIS BROW

    ALTHOUGH men have often been uncertain where unicorns were to be
found, there has never been the same difficulty with regard to unicorns'
horns. These have never been plentiful and they have usually been very
dear, but they have been known. Almost any well-read or widely travelled
European of the sixteenth century would have been able to name eight or
ten whole horns kept in cathedrals, monastic houses, or kings'
treasuries, not to mention the innumerable smaller pieces to be found in
the hands of the wealthy. The study of these horns, of their
distribution, origin, and use, leads into the centre of unicorn lore.

    "Come we now", in the words of Thomas Fuller, "to the fashion and
colour of the Horn, conceiving it no considerable controversy concerning
the length and bignesse thereof, quantity not varying the kind in such
cases." It is hard to know just what Thomas Fuller, who lived
victoriously and contentiously through the English Civil Wars, may have
understood by a "considerable controversy", but this one has been long
and earnestly waged. Ctesias gives the length of the horn as one cubit
or eighteen inches, Aelian as a cubit and a half, Pliny as two cubits,
Solinus and Isidore as four feet, Cardan as three cubits, Rabelais as
six or seven feet, and Albertus Magnus as ten feet. At this point the
growth of the horn was checked, for the animal that bore it was
obviously becoming top-heavy and needed, as several sceptics pointed
out, to be "as big as a ship" merely to carry such a formidable
bow-sprit. Arabian writers showed less retraint, for Al Damiri, among
others, asserts that the unicorn, for all its great strength, is unable
to lift its head because of the great weight of its horn. Other Arabian
authorities inform us that he often carries about on this horn the
bodies of several elephants which he has "perforated". Although the
spoils went to the victor in these contests, they were frequently--as in
human affairs--quite as lethal as defeat, for Alkazuwin says that when
once the unicorn has gored the elephant he is unable to remove the
corpse from his horn, so that he either starves to death or else dies of
the putrefaction. (Here was material for a powerful pacifistic allegory,
if the Arabs had been given to such things.) The end comes when the roc,
seeing the unicorn with one or more elephants impaled upon his horn,
swoops down and bears the whole mass of flesh away as a titbit for its
young.

    Concerning the length of the alicorn, then, one could think almost
whatever one liked. The time was to come when specimens almost if not
quite as long as that described by Albertus Magnus were to be seen in
Europe, and undoubtedly the respect in which the unicorn was everywhere
held was maintained by the effort to imagine a beast to which a horn ten
feet in length would be proportionate.

    Before the sixteenth century there was general agreement among the
learned that the true horn was black, as Aelian had said, but after a
long period of vacillation the opinion that it was white or of the
colour of old ivory definitely triumphed. Less bookish persons had
thought of it as white for a long time, if we may judge from the
numerous pictures of the unicorn to be seen in mediaeval manuscripts.
Andrea Bacci recalled the assertion of Aelian and Pliny, but had to
admit that all the specimens he had seen were not black but more nearly
white. His dilemma was really distressing, for he had, on the one hand,
the Renaissance scholar's profound respect for ancient authority and, on
the other, he felt obliged to avoid saying anything that would cast a
doubt upon the genuineness of the horn, a white one, belonging to his
patron, Don Francesco di Medici. He does the best he can in saying that
"niger" does not necessarily mean pure black, but with all his learning
he cannot make the word mean anything like white. Thomas Fuller suggests
that the differences in colour may be due to age--"white when newly
taken from his head; yellow like that lately in the Tower, of some
hundred years seniority; but whether or no it will ever turn black, as
that of Aelian's and Pliny's description, let others decide." But the
most ingenious solution of these discrepancies was the view that the
true horn is white within and black outside, on account of the "bark"
that covers it, so that the same horn may be described as either black
or white according as the bark has been left on or stripped off.

    By far the strangest thing in the history of opinion about the
alicorn's appearance is the age and persistence of the belief in the
natural spiral twistings or striae. These are clearly delineated in
every picture of the unicorn that I have seen in mediaeval manuscripts,
some of which were drawn in the twelfth century. It is possible that
Aelian meant to describe them in his phrase xxxxxx xxx Kai xxxx xxxxx
for the word xxxxx may mean either "rings" or "spirals". Even the horns
of the unicorned animals shown in bas-relief on the walls of Persepolis
seem to show these twistings. There is nothing said about them, however,
in Ctesias, Pliny, Solinus, Isidore, or Physiologus; aside from the
mysterious passage in Aelian, there seems to be no ancient authority for
them whatever, and learned writers do not mention them until after the
close of the Middle Ages. Erudite Europeans were converted to the
"anfractuous spires and cochicary turnings"--to adopt Fuller's
charmingly pedantic phrase--at about the time when they admitted a
possibility that the horn might sometimes be white, but Arabian writers
had accepted them somewhat earlier. Alkazuwin says, for example, that
the unicorn has one horn on its head, sharp at the top and thick below,
with raised or convex striae outside and hollow or concave striae
within.

    Arabian notions of the inside of the alicorn are highly interesting.
Ibn Khord‰dhbeh asserts that when the horn is split longitudinally one
finds inside of it, on a black background, the white figures of a man, a
fish, and a peacock or some other bird. Algiahid, in his Book of Holy
Things, makes much the same remark, and Al Damiri affirms in more detail
that when one cuts the alicorn lengthwise there are found in it various
figures in white on black, as of peacocks, goats, birds, certain kinds
of trees, men, and other things wonderfully depicted. Horns with such
remarkable interior decorations were more prized, of course, than those
without them, and the Arabs tell us that a good one was worth over four
thousand shekels of gold and that they were used by the Chinese
mandarins on their girdles.

    This whole belief is certainly one of the most curious confusions of
art with nature. Michelangelo seems to have found it helpful to imagine
that his statue already existed in the stone block before him, so that
his task was merely to strip away the superfluous material. Arabian
travellers in the Orient could understand the work of the Chinese ivory
carvers in no other way.

    While considering the physical characteristics of alicorns we should
not neglect the abundant testimony that they are not always fixed
solidly in the skull, but that some unicorns have them "plyable", as
Arthur Golding says in speaking of the one-horned bulls of Inde, "to
what purpose they liste". There was the best authority for movable horns
in general, Aristotle having ascribed them to the Indian bull and
Solinus asserting that the Erythian ox could raise and lower its horns
at will. The same advantage was enjoyed by the Yale, whose horns
normally projected one forward and one backward, but who could switch
them about to suit the exigencies of the moment in fighting. Cosmas
Indicopleustes informs us that the rhinoceros's horn is normally so
loose that it shakes and rattles when he walks, but that when he is in a
rage it is suddenly tightened to such a degree that he can tear up rocks
and trees.

    The unicorn does not suffer in this comparison. Garcias ab Horto,
rounding the Cape of Good Hope about the year 1550, heard of an
amphibian on the eastern coast of Africa that could raise and lower its
single horn and swing it to right or left as caprice or necessity
dictated, and some years later André Thevet reported another amphibian
unicorn--it had webbed feet behind and cloven hoofs before and lived on
fish--from the Island of Molucca, with a three-foot horn that waved
about like the crest of a cock. In this connection we must not forget
the mobile horns observed by Pantagruel upon the unicorns of the Land of
Satin. Finally, a consular agent of France writes a long letter in the
middle of the nineteenth century to prove that the unicorn of the
ancients has been discovered in Central Africa, and that it has a
movable horn--"une corne unique, mobile, susceptible d'erection en ce
sense qu'elle peut recevoir de la volonté de l'animal une position
variable relativement a la surface du front".

    There is one more thing, perhaps the most instructive of all, to be
said about the physical characteristics of the alicorn. For two or three
centuries many learned men, quite as intelligent as those of their kind
to-day, measured and weighed and tasted these objects, speculated about
them, subjected them to various tests, bought and sold them for great
sums, wrote astonishingly erudite books about them--all the while
calling them "horns". Not one of these men guessed, until the
seventeenth century brought in new habits of thought, that the objects
they had before them, ninety-nine times in the hundred, were not
composed of horn at all but of ivory.

    By the year 1600 Europe and England contained at least a dozen
famous alicorns that were known to all travellers, were frequently
exhibited on state occasions to the people, and were carefully described
again and again. Most of these were kept in great churches or
monasteries. They were regarded as sacred objects, and were sometimes
used as pontifical staffs.

    Best known of all was the horn of St. Denis, near Paris, seven feet
long and weighing over thirteen pounds. This was included in the
monastery's inventory of its treasures, together with other sacred
relics, and was one of the "worthies" of Europe. Even John Evelyn speaks
of seeing it--"a faire unicorne's horn, sent by a K. of Persia, about 7
foote long". The popular belief was that it had been presented to the
monastery by André Thevet, the famous traveller, who was thought to have
had it from the King of Monomotapa with whom he was said to have gone
unicorn hunting; but this opinion was groundless, for Thevet speaks of
having seen the horn of St. Denis "en ma grand' jeunesse", he never went
unicorn hunting with the King of Monomotapa, and in fact he did not much
believe in unicorns. How this alicorn was acquired we do not know, but
it was lost during the general looting of old treasures, particularly
those of the Church, during the Revolution of 1793. It was kept in a
dark vault of the sanctuary, one end of it resting in water. We hear
that "this water is given to drink to those that go under the hollow
arch; and so soon as they have drunk they suddenly fall into a great
sweat".

    Cardan has left a careful description of the St. Denis alicorn which
he saw during a visit paid to the monastery in company with the monks'
physician. "After we had seen the sepulchres of the kings", he writes,
"and the statues and other marble ornaments, I studied very closely the
unicorn's horn hanging in the sanctuary. It was so long that I could not
touch the top of it with my hand, but its thickness was slight in
proportion to its length, for it was easily possible to surround it with
the thumb and first finger . . . . It was smooth all over, but was
marked by bands running from end to end as on a snail-shell . . . .
Nature makes nothing else that I know of like this."

    Almost equally celebrated were the two horns of St. Mark's in
Venice, said to have been taken at the fall of Constantinople in 1204 as
part of the Venetian share in the spoil. It is true that many of the
treasures of St. Mark's were thus acquired, and the two horns have long
been associated by tradition with the blind Doge Enrico Dandolo who,
although ninety-seven years of age when Constantinople was taken, is
said to have been the first man over the wall; but against this romantic
and persistent tradition stand certain awkward facts. On the silver-gilt
handle of one of these alicorns is the inscription: xxxxxx xxx xxxx
xxxxx xxxxxx. (John Palaeologus, Emperor. Alicorn good against poison.)
Now the first Emperor of the East named John in the Palaeologus dynasty
was John V, who ruled 1341-1391; the only other, ignoring the
non-dynastic John Cantacuzenus, was John VI, 1425-1448, and there are
several reasons for believing that the alicorn in question belonged to
him. For one thing, the Greek inscription upon it, although crude in
several ways, is comparatively modern in lettering. It bears on the
handle the familiar design of the double-headed eagle--probably Hittite
in origin and perhaps brought into Europe by the Crusaders--which was
adopted in the arms of the Emperor of the Romans not earlier than 1414.
Finally, this John VI made a famous visit to the West, and especially to
Venice, to seek aid for his crumbling empire, and we are told by the
chronicler Phrantzes that when he appeared in St. Mark's Basin the
Venetian galleys went out to meet him adorned with the design of the
double-headed eagle--a gracious courtesy on the part of the city that
had caused most of his distress. It seems to me more than possible that
the alicorn bearing his name was brought to Venice by him on this
occasion, although it is hard to see how it could have fallen, as it
must have done, into the hands of the wealthy jewel merchant Giorgio
Belbava. At any rate, St. Mark's Library contains a record that in 1488
this alicorn was given by the son of Belbava to Doge Barbarigo, and that
the Doge at once handed it over to the Procurators of the Cathedral, "ut
illud in Thesauris Sanctuarii in Celebritatibus portandum curarent".

    The second alicorn of St. Mark's, like the first about one metre in
length, is made of three pieces joined together. This also has a Greek
inscription, but one that gives no hint of the horn's origin, so that
one can believe, if one likes, that it was brought back by Doge Dandolo
in 1204. Both of these alicorns have been coloured with vermilion for
several inches from the points, and on this colour have been written
various devotional ejaculations in Arabic, of no present interest except
as they serve to indicate once more that the objects were regarded as
sacred. Clearly, however, the Greek and Arabic inscriptions alike would
be felt to increase the alicorn's magic power, and the phrases xxxx
xxxxx xxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx on one of them were probably intended as a
charm.

    These two alicorns are still shown to visitors as they were when the
hero of The Cloister and the Hearth saw them centuries ago, and when
properly understood they are among the most interesting relics of the
past to be seen in Europe. One's guide asserts that they were formerly
used by admirals of the Venetian fleet as batons of office, and this,
whether true or not, shows that they have long been popularly regarded
as symbols of supreme power and leadership. The spiral ridges of both
have been smoothed away to such an extent that Andrea Marini thought
them not genuine, but the grain of the ivory may still be seen to run in
counter-clockwise spirals, leaving one in no doubt as to their nature.
This smoothing was not done, as some have surmised, to improve their
appearance, but to get medicinal powder, and there exists a highly
interesting, not to say amusing, decree of the august Council of Ten:
"That the Procurators are to have the Alicorns decorated with silver
from the points to the silver-gilt handles so that the marks of former
scrapings may be concealed, and they are to prohibit any further
scrapings except in cases allowed by unanimous vote of the Council of
Ten."

    There is in the St. Mark's Treasury still another alicorn, more than
twice as long as the other two, unscraped, and without inscriptions. The
history of this one can be traced accurately for a long period, although
it is probably not so old as the others. In the year 1597 Francesco
Contarini, ambassador from Venice to the Court of France, wrote to the
Council of Ten advising the purchase from the Maréchal de Brissac of his
alicorn, held at thirty thousand ducats. Francesco argued, like a
Venetian, that in this way the Republic could get back some part of the
debt owed to it by France. Venice seems to have offered the sum
demanded, but for some reason did not get the alicorn until 1668, when
it was sold to a descendant of Francesco Contarini by the Brissac
family. In his will, dated 1684, Alessandro Contarini left it to the
Treasury of St. Mark's, adding the information that it had been taken by
the French in the sack of Turin. When given to the Treasury this alicorn
stood on a pedestal of wrought silver, which gave it the appearance of a
gigantic candle, but about the middle of the nineteenth century the
pedestal was put to other uses.

    Milan Cathedral also had its famous alicorn; the church at Raskeld
somehow acquired several; St. Paul's in London and Westminster Abbey
each had one or more before the Dissolution, when they were probably
either taken into the royal treasury or else sold to the highest
bidders. The inventory taken by order of Cromwell in 1536 of the
property owned by the tiny Church of St. Swithun at Winchester shows:
"One Rectors staf of Unicorns horn"--a proud possession indeed for one
of the smallest churches in England at a time when the alicorn was still
"worth a city". Chester Cathedral still keeps its alicorn, but I am told
by the Dean that it has been in the Chapter's possession only since the
eighteenth century.

    The long association of the unicorn with Christianity and the Church
is amusingly illustrated by an attempted act of vandalism in which the
beast fully justified the ancient belief that he could not be captured.
In a forgotten book of travels I find this passage: "Our leader having
taken a great fancy to the unicorn which stands on one side of the great
entrance to the Church of Saint John in Malta, wishing to place it as a
figure-head to his brother's yacht, he resolved to have the animal, and
his refractory crew were desired to be in attendance the next night . .
. . The rope was placed round the unicorn's neck, and all of us began,
with a true sailor-like 'one, two, three, haul!' to dislodge our victim.
It was, however, so well fastened on its pedestal that we did not
succeed."

    A feeling that the horn had some vague sanctity, due perhaps to the
symbolism of the unicorn, must certainly be assumed to explain the
possession of these objects by so many churches and monasteries and the
veneration in which they were held; but a quite different feeling lay
behind the eager quest of them by popes and kings and emperors during
the Renaissance. Andrea Bacci says that in his time--the second half of
the sixteenth century--there was not a prince in Italy, to say nothing
of those outside of it, who had not at least a piece of the horn in his
possession. He describes in detail the alicorn belonging to the Grand
Duke Francesco Medici, which he seems to have had before him while
writing his book, and others belonging to the Pope, to the Duke of
Mantua, to Ruberto Ricci of Florence, and to the King of Poland--this
last a very famous specimen. Echoing Bacci, J. F. Hubrigk asks
rhetorically: "Is there any Prince, Duke, or King in the world who has
not either seen or possessed, and regarded as among the most precious of
his possessions, a unicorn's horn?"  Such men there may have been, but
if so it was not for lack of desire but of funds.

    Among the earliest references to the alicorns of kings' treasuries
are those in the royal accounts of France. There we find recorded, for
the year 1388, the sum paid to a goldsmith "pour avoir atachie une
espreuve de lincorne et mise sur une chayenne d'argent doré et
enchaconée." This was early indeed, for the alicorn was not to reach the
height of its reputation for more than a century to come. Just eighty
years after the King of France paid for the decoration of his horn,
Edward IV of England gave a sumptuous dinner to his sister, the Princess
Margaret, on the occasion of her wedding to the Duke of Burgundy, and in
the contemporary description of the furniture prepared for the dinner we
read: "In the myddis a copeborde, in triangle of IX stagis hight. On
every corner unnycorns horns, the poyntes garnysshid, and othe thre in
other places, accomplissinge the coopborde." One of the most amusing
glimpses into remote history afforded us by unicorn lore is the
possibility that at least one of the numerous alicorns at this wedding
dinner was brought over from France by the bridegroom himself. This we
may perhaps infer from the inventory of the Dukes of Burgundy made in
1467, the year before the wedding, for there we find described: "Une
licorne garnye autour du bout, par dessoubz, d'or, a la devise de MS.,
et a la pointe garnie d'argent doré et depuis l'un des boutz jusques a
l'autre garnye de plusieurs filetz d'or." Perhaps the Duke felt even on
his wedding journey and while sitting beside his bride that he preferred
to trust his own horn, for the times were troubled and one did not know
how English alicorns might act. However this may have been, these people
were certainly much interested in the alicorn. In September of 1472
Louis de la Grantehuse came to England as ambassador to Edward IV from
the Duke of Burgundy. The highly interesting account of this visit
records that "When the masse was doon, the Kinge gave the sayde Lorde
Granthuse a Cuppe of Golde, garnished wt Perle. In the myddes of the
Cuppe ys a greate Pece of Vnicornes horne, to my estimacyon, VII ynches
compas." Somewhat after this, Commines relates that de Ballassat,
plundering the palace of Pietro de' Medici in 1495 "took, among other
things, a whole unicorn's horn worth six or seven thousand ducats, and
two large pieces of another". D'Aubigne, also, narrating the exploits of
one of his noble ruffians, says that he found in a villa he was
plundering "pour butin principal une licorne estimée a quatrevingt mille
escus".

    These, however, were the alicorns of subjects, and comparatively
humble things. The gorgeous popes of the Renaissance acquired a number
of horns by one means and another, descending when necessary even to
outright purchase, and they were accustomed to have them set with
appropriate splendour in silver and gold. In his account of how he
worsted his rival Tobbia, Benvenuto Cellini enables us to see how
carefully this work of the goldsmith was done. He says that Pope Clement
VII commanded him and Tobbia "to draw a design for setting an unicorn's
horn, the most beautiful that ever was seen, and which had cost him
seventeen thousand ducats: and as the Pope proposed making a present of
it to King Francis, he chose to have it first richly adorned with gold:
so he employed us both to draw the designs. When we had finished them we
carried them to the Pope. Tobbia's design was in the form of a
candlestick: the horn was to enter it like a candle, and at the bottom
of the candlestick he represented four little unicorn's heads--a most
simple invention. As soon as I saw it I could not contain myself so as
to avoid smiling at the oddity of the conceit. The Pope perceiving this,
said, 'Let me see that design of yours.' It was a single head of an
unicorn fitted to receive the horn. I had made the most beautiful sort
of head conceivable, for I in part drew it in the form of a horse's head
and partly in that of a hart's, adorned with the finest sort of wreaths
and other devices; insomuch that no sooner was my design seen but the
whole court gave it the preference. However, as some Milanese gentlemen
of great authority were witnesses of this contest, they said: 'Most Holy
Father, if you propose sending this noble present to France, you should
take it into consideration that the French are an undiscriminating
tasteless people and will not be sensible of the excellence of this
masterly piece of Benvenuto's. But they will be pleased with these
grotesque figures of Tobbia's, which will be sooner executed; and
Benvenuto will in the meantime finish your chalice.'" Whether for the
reasons given or not, this advice was accepted: in 1553 Pope Clement met
François I at Marseilles and there gave him the horn which had been
decorated by Tobbia, the occasion being the wedding of the Pope's niece,
Catharine de Medici, to the son of François, the later Henry II of
France.

    Temporal princes were not less eager purchasers than Pope Julius
III, who bought a horn for ninety thousand écus for the Vatican museum.
At the coronation of the Emperor Theodore Ivanovitch in Moscow, 1584, he
wore "a bejewelled robe--worth two hundred pounds, his staff imperial in
his right hand of an unicorn's horn of three and one half feet in length
beset with rich stones bought of merchants of Augsburg by the old
Emperor in 1581, and cost him seven thousand marks sterling." We hear
also that the Sultan of Turkey sent twelve alicorns as a gift to Philip
II of Spain, feeling, no doubt, that Philip needed them as much as any
man in Europe. (This story was doubted by Caspar Bartholinus, who could
not believe that even the Sultan was rich enough to own twelve horns at
a time.)

    One might write an entire book, and not a dull one, about the
alicorns of kings' treasuries; but the present book has a longer road to
travel, and I can only mention a few of the horns that have been owned
by British sovereigns.

    In 1303, while King Edward I of England was fighting far in the
North, he learned that a large part of the immense treasure which he had
hidden, before setting out, under the Chapter House at Westminster, had
been stolen. As soon as he could return to London he set on foot a
strict investigation, and the trial that followed proved the guilt of
some of the Westminster monks. Under the bed of one of the chief
culprits, the keeper of the palace gate, there was discovered a
unicorn's horn which had been stolen from the treasury, and for
centuries thereafter the skin of a fair-haired and light-complexioned
man was to be seen nailed to the place in the wall where the entrance
had been made--intended, no doubt, "to encourage the others".

    An inventory taken in 1497 of the possessions of James III of
Scotland shows: "In unicornis \[i.e. in the coins of that name\] nyne
hundreth and four score. Item a serpent toung and ane unicorne home, set
in gold. Item a covering of variand purpir taster, browdin with
thressilis and a unicorne."

    But by far the most famous of all British alicorns was the great
"Horn of Windsor" which the German traveller Hentzner saw in 1598 and
valued, if his Latin text is to be trusted, at one hundred thousand
pounds. We know exactly when and where this horn was discovered; it was
picked up on the twenty-second of July, 1577, on an island in
Frobisher's Strait, and we are told that when it reached England it was
"reserved as a jewell by the Queen's Majesty's commandment, in her
wardrobe of robes." We have also a dark hint as to what became of it,
for Thomas Fuller, speaking of it and of the Tower Horn, both of which
he had seen in his youth, remarks: "It belongs not to me to inquire what
became of them", and then somewhat later he says that a unicorn's horn
has been presented to his Majesty "to supply the place of that in the
Tower which our Civil wars have embeseled". We may infer that the Horn
of Windsor was "embeseled" at the same time.

    Fuller's words imply that the Tower Horn also belonged among the
Crown jewels, and it deserved a place there if contemporary estimates of
its value were not exaggerated. "In 1641 the Marquis de la Ferte Imbaut,
Marshal of France, saw in the Tower of London a unicorn's horn covered
with plates of silver and estimated at the enormous sum of forty
thousand pounds."  Such an estimate as this, at so late a date, must
have been due largely to the goldsmith's work, for the value of alicorns
fell away rapidly after 1625. The one belonging to Charles I and kept by
him at Somerset House was valued at only five hundred pounds, although
it was an exceptionally fine specimen. Pierre Pomet tells us that it was
seven feet long and weighed thirteen pounds, so that it equalled the
famous horn of St. Denis.

    The cost of "true unicorn's horn" (verum cornu monocerotis) in its
best period was a little over ten times its weight in gold when sold in
small pieces or in powder, but whole alicorns sometimes brought twice as
much as this. The inventory of Lorenzo the Magnificent, recently opened
to the public in the new Medici Museum at Florence, shows that the most
precious of his possessions after the famous Tazza Farnese was his
alicorn, three and one-half braccia in length and valued by
him--probably on the basis of what it cost him--at six thousand gold
florins. About the year 1560 a group of German merchants offered an
alicorn for sale in Rome and other Italian cities for ninety thousand
scudi--the scudo being then worth about four shillings--and finally sold
it to the Pope. We are told that the King of France refused one hundred
thousand icus for the horn of St. Denis, although we are not told how it
came to be in his control. A horn picked up on the coast of Wales in
1588 by a poor woman was sold for a great but unspecified sum. Edward
Topsell could say in 1607 that "the price of that which is true is
reported at this day to be of no less value than gold". The famous
alicorn belonging to the city of Dresden was valued at seventy-five
thousand thalers. Ordinarily it was kept on display, strongly protected,
in the museum which was known to the more leisured classes as the
exotikothaumatourgematatameion, and there was a strict municipal
regulation that whenever raspings were taken from it for medicinal uses
two persons of princely rank should be present in the room. Pierre Pomet
tells us that a horn given to the King of France in 1553 was said to be
worth twenty thousand pounds sterling. The Republic of Venice in 1597
offered for a whole horn the sum of thirty thousand ducats--ten times
the price of Shylock's pound of flesh--and did not get it.

    Many things in the history of commerce are less interesting than the
curve of market quotations on unicorns' horns. The means that were taken
to increase and then to maintain the price of them we can only infer
from a number of minute details, but the reasons why that price rather
swiftly declined are more open to examination. By 1734 a well-informed
writer could say that horns which formerly brought many thousands of
dollars could then be had for twenty-five; yet this same writer makes it
clear that even in his time there was still an active sale, and it is
certain that long after the wealthy had lost all interest in alicorns
the poor continued to buy them. Something of this commercial history is
indicated by the fact that the Book of Rates for the first year of Queen
Mary, 1531, gives the import duty as "cornu unicorni ye ounce 20
shillings", and that in 1664 the French duty on unicorn's horn was fifty
sous per pound.

    There is something delightfully humorous, to the modern view, in the
idea of adulterating and "faking" the unicorn's horn. The rewards of
success were enormous, and human nature was almost as prevalent in the
sixteenth century as it is to-day, so that one finds in all the more
responsible and socially minded writers upon our topic bitter complaints
about the frequency of counterfeiting, warnings that purchasers must be
constantly suspicious, and tests by which the true horn may be known
from the false. Andrea Bacci makes it clear that fraud was very common
in his time, though he thinks it can only be practised in the sale of
powdered horn and of fragments, for which, he says, various kinds of
horn and pounded stone were sold; but even this would be impossible, he
reminds his readers, if only the public would realize that the true horn
is rarer than precious stones, so that none but great princes can hope
to possess even a large piece. Bacci does not show his usual knowledge
and acumen, however, in saying that the horn cannot be imitated in the
whole piece, for there is evidence that the wicked knowledge of how this
could be done was possessed and used in his time all over Europe. Amatus
Lusitanus, following Dioscorides, says that if ivory is boiled for six
hours in a decoction of mandragora it becomes soft so that one can bend
and work it as he likes, and Cardan tells us that elephants' tusks were
often so treated. One source of the supply of alicorns is revealed by
Hector Bothius in his Histoty of Scotland, where he asserts, after a
grotesque account of walrus hunting, that the tusks of the beasts are
straightened artificially and sold in Europe as unicorns' horns. André
Thevet affirms that he has actually seen this artificial straightening
performed by clever Levantine artisans on an island in the Red Sea, a
distributing station for both East and West. Antony Deussing admits that
such fraud is possible, and he suspects that it is a good deal
practised. Andrea Marini, always a sceptic, goes so far as to imply that
even the sacred horns of St. Mark's, in his own city, are not above
suspicion. For powdered alicorn the common substitutes seem to have been
burnt horn, whalebone, various kinds of clay, the bones of dogs and of
pigs, lime-stone, and, most important of all during the later history,
stalactites and the bones of fossil animals. Edward Topsell, with all
these facts in mind, advises that alicorn be bought "out of the whole
horn if it may be done, or of greater crums, and which may describe the
figure of the home".

    Under these deplorable circumstances there was an obvious need of
tests by which the true horn might be known and counterfeits detected.
The scientist set himself once more to his ancient and endless task of
outwitting and exposing the charlatan, with the result that we may study
the nascent "experimental method", as applied to the alicomn, in
examples much earlier than Francis Bacon. In these tests we see the
fumblings of infant science: it does not ask what seem to us the
fundamental questions; for a long time the effort was not to find out
whether unicorns existed, nor yet, supposing that they did, whether the
magical properties attributed to their horns really belonged to them.
Unicorns and magical properties were assumed, so that the only question
for scientific investigation was the practical one: is this particular
horn genuine cornu monocerotis? Nevertheless, groping and childish as
these experiments seem to us, it is with them that the unicorn legend
enters its final phase. It had come through the "theological" period, to
adopt Comte's famous generalization, and through another which we may
perhaps call, by a somewhat violent wrenching of the term, the
"metaphysical"; now it slowly emerges into the "positivistic" period,
into the modern scientific world in which, after a long time and many
hesitations, it was to be forgotten. Thus the history of human thought,
so far as we have yet gone, is implicit and epitomized in the lore of
the unicorn.

    A full account of the alicorn tests would fill many pages, and I
must choose a few examples that seem typical of their respective
periods. One of the most curious passages concerning them is that given
by one David de Pomis, who describes himself with no false modesty as "a
Hebrew physician and philosopher of the Tribe of Juda, and a member of
the noble family of Pomaria which the Emperor Titus led captive from
Jerusalem to Rome." His book is at first sight somewhat bewildering. The
fact that it is written in three languages--Hebrew, Latin, and
Italian--contributes something to this effect; it is paged backward, the
indexes run backward, and the title-page stands at the end; David uses
the full-stop only when he is quite through with a topic, to mark a
period in the exact sense, and he employs the comma for all other
punctuation. All this is darkened rather than illumined for me, in the
only copy I have seen, by the numberless marginalia in the hand of Isaac
Casaubon, who improves upon his polyglot author by adding a vocabulary
in Arabic. But it is precisely in such "quaint and curious volumes of
forgotten lore" as this--how Edgar Allan Poe would have loved it!--that
we have to delve for unicorn lore, and David of the Tribe of Juda does
not disappoint one.

    "The unicorn", says he, "is a beast that has one horn in its brow,
and this horn is good against poison and pestilential fevers. But one is
to observe that there is very little of the true horn to be found, most
of that which is sold as such being either stag's horn or elephant's
tusk. The common test which consists in placing the object in water to
see whether bubbles will rise is not at all to be trusted, and
therefore, wishing to benefit the world and to expose the wicked persons
who sell worthless things at great prices, I take this occasion to
describe a true test by which one may know the genuine horn from the
false. The test is this: place the horn in a vessel of any sort of
material you like, and with it three or four live and large scorpions,
keeping the vessel covered. If you find four hours later that the
scorpions are dead, or almost lifeless, the alicorn is a good one, and
there is not money enough in the world to pay for it. Otherwise, it is
false."

    A series of alicorn tests is given by Laurens Catelan: the true
horn, when thrown into water, sends up little bubbles, "like a pearl";
the water seems to boil, though cold, and one can hear the boiling; the
horn gives out a sweet odour when burned; poisonous plants and animals,
when brought near it, burst and die; it sweats in the presence of
poison. This Catelan, we are to remember, was an eminent pharmacist of
the seventeenth century, and he had a whole "true horn" of his own, yet
he names these five tests in apparent good faith. The physician Jordanus
in his book De Pe.cte speaks of seeing a Jew enclose a spider in a
circle drawn on the floor with an alicorn, and he says that the spider
could not cross the line, and starved to death inside it. Basil
Valentine, in his Triumphal Chariot of Alchemy, specifies that the
circle should be drawn, not with the horn, but with the flesh of the
animal; and Ambroise Pare relates that the test was sometimes made by
soaking the horn in water, dipping a finger in this water, and then
drawing a circle with it on a table. This was something like the test
that John Webster had in mind in the lines:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As men, to try the precious unicorn's horn,  
Make of the powder a preservative circle,  
And in it put a spider.

</div>

These tests were not always accepted, however, by more thoughtful
writers. Atnbroise Pare, like Andrea Marini, says that he has tried all
of them and that those that cannot be explained on natural grounds do
not work. Cardan gives his own set of tests, according to which the true
horn is always striated, is extremely hard, very heavy, of the colour of
boxwood, and able to save the life of a pigeon poisoned with arsenic. In
the last of these tests we approach modern methods. It was used more and
more frequently as time went by and gradually supplanted all rivals.
Thus Andrea Bacci tells us that the Cardinal of Trent had an alicorn
richly adorned with gold and gems which he used very generously--"and I
am able to affirm that on one occasion, several signors being present,
he put it to this test: he gave arsenic to two pigeons, and then to one
of them he fed as much as it would take of powder scraped from the horn.
This one, after a few symptoms of sickness, revived and lived; the other
died in two hours." And again we read that on the 3rd of October, 1636,
the Professors and College of Physicians of Copenhagen were present at
an experiment made by a pharmacist of that city named John Woldenberg.
He gave arsenic to two doves and two kittens, and then administered
scrapings of alicorn to one of the doves and one of the kittens.
According to Ole Wurm, who was present, the test was "not entirely
unsuccessful", for the dove to which the alicorn was given survived, but
both kittens died.

    This brings us to the most interesting, the strangest, and the
central belief about the unicorn--that its horn has a mysterious
alexipharmical or prophylactic "virtue". It was supposed to be a
detector of the presence of poison. Opinions varied concerning the mode
of its operation and the causes of its power, but that power itself was
seldom questioned or subjected to intelligent investigation. The faith
in it rested upon authority, tradition, and common consent, which have
always been and are still the strongest influences governing belief;
destruction of this faith took a century and a half of time and the
gradual substitution of new habits of thought for old.

    For a clear English statement of this faith we may go to John Swan,
an unquestioning though late believer. "Monoceros", he writes, "is a
beast with one horne, called therefore by the name of an unicorne . . .
which hath naturally but one horne, and that a very rich one, which
groweth out of the middle of his forehead, being a horne of such virtue
as is in no beast's horne besides; which, while some have gone about to
deny, they have secretly blinded the eyes of the world from their full
view of the greatness of God's works. . . This horne hath many sovereign
virtues, insomuch that being put upon a table furnished with many
junkets and banqueting dishes, it will quickly descrie whether there be
any poyson or venime among them, for if there be the horne is presently
covered with a kind of sweat or dew."

    For two full centuries at least, roughly speaking from the final
decades of the fourteenth century to those of the sixteenth, this belief
was almost universal and unchallenged throughout Europe; but even in the
fourteenth century it was already ages old, for one sees at a glance
that it must be closely related to the belief reported by Aelian about
the beakers used by Indian potentates. After the sixteenth century it
lingered on, in spite of repeated attacks, almost into our own time. At
present we may focus attention upon the period of its undisputed sway.

    As one would expect, considering the constant search of mediaeval
medicine for a panacea, so remarkable an object as the alicorn was not
allowed to remain a mere detector of poisons. To the basic faith in its
supernatural properties there was added the belief that it had a more
general prophylactic power, and at length, invading the other great
department of medicine, it was widely accepted as a powerful therapeutic
agent. Before the sixteenth century closed the alicorn had an important
place in materia medica, for we learn from an accurate and scholarly
physician of the time that it was then prescribed as a cure for all
poisons, for fevers, for bites of mad dogs and scorpions, for falling
sickness, worms, fluxes, loss of memory, the plague, and prolongation of
youth. Charlatans were even known to assert that it could raise the
dead.

    One of the earliest indications that this superstition was beginning
to form in Europe is to be found in the writings of Hildegarde of Bingen
(1098-1179). A most remarkable woman--by no means a saint, though often
called so, and scarcely a "mystic", proper regard being had to her
pathological condition--Hildegarde lays strong claim to the respect of
those who can be just to brilliant reasoning based upon false premises.
The centre of her encyclopaedic interests was medicine, so that she
could scarcely have ignored the alleged virtues of the alicorn if she
had ever heard of them. I find no mention of them in her works,  but I
do find discussion of other matters closely allied. Hildegarde believed
that not the horn alone of the unicorn, but the whole animal was
medicinal: under its horn, she says, it has a piece of metal as
transparent as glass in which a man may see his face; she tells us how
to make an unguent of the yolks of eggs and powdered unicorn's liver,
which unguent is a sovereign cure for leprosy--"unless the leper in
question happens to be one whom Death is determined to have or else one
whom God will not allow to be cured". (As Hildegarde is the only woman
who has ever written anything important about the unicorn, the
suggestion of the cook-book in her "yolks of eggs and powdered unicorn's
liver" is the more welcome.) A belt made of unicorn's skin, she says,
will preserve one from fevers, and boots of the same material assure one
of sound legs and immunity from plague. All this is good to know, and it
comes with the authority of one who, as head of a large religious house,
had the health of a whole community in her keeping.

    Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), as mighty in his influence as in
learning, a cautious and even thoughtful writer considering his times,
makes little of the horn's magical virtues and thinks they should be
investigated further. Peter of Abano (c. 1250-1318), who carried on the
work of Albertus in "conciliating" the remains of Aristotelianism with
Aristotle's Arabic commentators, was a man of different stamp. Generally
regarded as a magician, he seems to have saved himself from the stake
only by an opportune death. During his exploration of Arabic lore he
acquired a firm faith in the alicorn which he transmitted to many
others, and indeed if one were asked to name a single writer to whom the
European belief might be attributed with least exaggeration, one could
not do better than to choose this Peter. The fact is, of course, that no
single writer was even largely responsible, for the belief grew up at a
time when no scholar ever expressed an original idea if he knew what he
was doing. It may well be that the Crusaders returning from the East did
more to spread the faith in the alicorn through Europe than all the
books put together, but at any rate that faith was well established
among the learned before 1350, and by the end of the same century it was
accepted by the wealthier classes of Europe and Great Britain. The poor
and ignorant were to have no practical interest in it for at least two
centuries to come.

    Detached expressions and indications of the belief are almost
innumerable. The writer known as "Dame Juliana Berners" says that "venym
is defended by the home of the Unycorne", and James I of Scotland speaks
of

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

                   the lufare unicorne  
That voidis venym with his evoure horne.

</div>

We hear that the inquisitor Torquemada always kept a piece of alicorn on
his table as a precaution against the wiles of his numerous enemies; it
was carried by Spanish and English explorers of America as
conscientiously as quinine is carried to-day by travellers in tropical
countries; Cabeza de Vaca writes that during his journey down the
Paraguay River in 1543 there were three attempts made to poison him with
arsenic, but that he foiled them all with a bottle of oil and a piece of
alicorn. When the Elizabethan adventurer, Edward Webbe, was at the point
of death from poison administered to him by "some lewd gunners"--one
sympathizes with those gunners, for they were probably worn out by the
man's outrageous lies.--"his phisitian gave him speedily Unicorne's home
to drinke", with the deplorable result that he lived on. A whole ship's
company of Englishmen was poisoned in Elizabethan days "by the roots of
Mandioca, but by a piece of Unicornes home they were preserved". It
seems probable that even Francis Bacon, reputed "father of the
experimental method", shared the belief of his time in the alicorn,
although he admits that the general confidence in it was in his day
declining. When the Apothecaries' Society of London was founded in 1617
two unicorns were chosen as the supporters of its arms, and the common
sign of the apothecary's shop, both in England and in Europe, during the
seventeenth century was the figure of a unicorn or that of its head and
horn. Laurens Catelan lists the names of a dozen foremost medical
authorities who had not only used the alicorn in their practice but had
praised it in their writings. Conrad Gesner, a zoologist of great
influence, says that the horn, especially that "ex novis insulis
allatum", works miracles against poison. Even at Venice and in the
middle of the seventeenth century there was a general belief that the
remarkable sweetness of the water in a certain well was due to bits of
alicorn that had been thrown into it years before. In 1639 James
Primerose of Hull said that the horn was still more trusted than the
bezoar-stone, although less common. But there is no need to extend this
catalogue farther in order to show that the belief in the alicorn's
magical properties was at least as general as the contemporary belief in
witchcraft. I may end it by quoting the words of one of the most learned
and witty of Englishmen. Thomas Fuller, having at one time doubted the
stories of the horn's virtue, reconsiders his doubts, and concludes
delightfully: "It is improbable that the vigour of Nature should extrude
that so specious to sight which is not also sovereign to service."

    Long before Fuller's time there were of course disbelievers abroad,
as the Reverend Edward Topsell makes clear--"A vulgar sort of Infidels
who scarcely believe any herb but such as they see in their own gardens,
or any beast but such as is in their own flocks, or any knowledge but
such as is bred in their own brains . . . so that of the true Unicorn,
because of the nobleness of his horn, they have ever been in doubt: by
which distraction it appeareth unto me that there is some secret enemy
in the inward degenerate nature of man which continually blindeth the
eyes of God his people from beholding the greatness of God his works." 
We shall have to hear from several base heretics of this kidney in their
turn, but in the meantime there is no doubt what was the orthodox
belief.

    The rapid development and spread of this belief and the
correspondingly rapid increase in the prices paid for alicorns
synchronize curiously--one cannot help thinking, significantly--with
another equally swift development, that in the art or profession of
poisoning. Working upon the few poor hints left them by ancient writers,
and urged on by the peculiar needs created by their political
institutions, the Italians of the Renaissance carried this art and
profession to wonderful heights. When every possible allowance has been
made for the exaggeration caused by contemporary fear and by the
romantic fancies of a later age, it remains clear that, during just
those two centuries in which the interest in alicorns culminated, poison
was a tool of social and political ambition very commonly used in Italy,
always to be considered and provided against, never to be ignored. We
need not believe in all the alleged crimes of the Borgias in order to
recognize in the very nature of the Italian tyrannies a direct
incitement to this basest and most cowardly form of murder, for the
violence and crime and subterfuge by which the tyrant frequently gained
his power often gave the suggestion, sometimes almost the excuse, for
the insidious violence of his taking off, and there can be no doubt
whatever that many of the noblemen of Italy lived in constant fear. The
"poison-rings", the amulets and charms against poison, the crystal cups
and the goblets of Venetian glass that have come down to us would alone
show that. Between the early years of the fourteenth century, when Peter
of Abano wrote his treatise De Venenis, and the appearance in 1586 of
Andrea Bacci's book of similar title, scores of Italian scholars and
physicians, most of them in the pay of great lords, pitted their
learning and wits against the secret skill of the poisoner. The
pharmacopceia was ransacked, ancient texts were searched, superstitions
older than civilization were revived--but nothing would serve; the dukes
and counts and captains and cardinals of Italy continued to die
suddenly, mysteriously, and, at least in one sense, prematurely. Medical
science could not then detect the nature of the poison by which a man
had died, and could not even make certain that he had been poisoned at
all; but this uncertainty did not mitigate the fear. If suspicion outran
the facts, this did not slow down the search for antidotes and
precautions.

    Francis Petrarch, who lived for many years in the palaces of
cardinals and dukes and who knew their hunted lives at first hand, left
a vivid picture of one of them at his noon-day meal to which I have
already referred. There is exaggeration in that picture, but the facts
were terrible enough. Those who think that our northern ideas of Italian
poisoning are chiefly due to misinterpretation of Machiavelli and to
diseased fancies, such as those of Webster, Tourneur, and Beddoes, may
be recommended to study the career of the Milanese poisoner Aqua
Toffana, who although she lived long after what may be called the best
period of her art, is said to have disposed of more than six hundred
persons during her half-century of practice, before she was publicly
strangled at the age of seventy. When cases of poisoning were traced to
her, she took refuge in a convent--as her only dangerous rival, the
Marquise de Brinvilliers, also did in like straits--and from that point
of vantage, the convent authorities refusing to give her up, she went on
selling her Acquetta di Napoli for twenty years more. And on every
bottle of this deadly poison--tasteless, odourless, without
colour--there was painted the image of a saint.

    French poisoning on a grand scale is usually supposed to have come,
like most of the other arts, from Italy--or such, at any rate, is the
opinion of French scholars  who trace it confidently to the advent of
Catharine de' Medici and her crowd of Italian retainers. Her family had
been remarkable even in Italy for its frequent resort to poison and for
equally frequent deaths from poisoning--one reason for the equality
being, perhaps, the fact that the family had a way of practising upon
its own members. The famous "laboratory" in the palace of Cosmo I, which
none but he ever entered, has often been supposed to have been devoted
to the manufacture of poisons. Cosmo's son, for whom Andrea Bacci wrote
his book on the unicorn, died in agony of unascertained cause, followed
in fifteen hours by his wife, and it was observed at the time that his
brother, Cardinal Ferdinand de Medici, made what seemed undignified
haste to divest himself of his robes so as to succeed him. The handsome
alicorn mounted in gold which, as we have seen, was given by Pope
Clement VII to the bridegroom's family when Catharine de' Medici married
the Dauphin, was therefore a most appropriate wedding gift, all these
things considered, for it might certainly have been taken as a graceful
intimation that Catharine was not expected to practice her family's
talents upon her husband's kin--or that, in case she did so, they might
be prepared. However this may have been, rumour was still kept busy with
her name; she was often charged with the poisoning of the Queen of
Navarre in 1572 and even with the death of her own son, the Duke of
Anjou, who died very suddenly in 1585, just after his valet had
"forgotten" to test his wine with an alicorn.

    All the arts blossomed somewhat later in France than in Italy, and
it was not until after the middle of the seventeenth century that the
Marquise de Brinvilliers, by slaying with poison, and chiefly for money,
her father, her husband, her sister, and her two brothers, threatened
Italy's "bad eminence". With better luck, or if she had not stolen out
of her convent to meet the "lover" who was really an officer of the law,
she might have gone as far as Aqua Toffana. The steady increase of
criminal poisoning led Louis XIV to establish a committee, the so-called
Chambre Ardente, which sat for three years investigating what had become
almost a major social problem. But France has never rivalled the secret
society of women, mostly young, discovered at Rome in 1659, the sole
purpose of which was to kill by poison the husbands of all the members.
These women are said to have met regularly at the house of one Hieronyma
Spara, who found the drugs and gave directions for the dosing. An
archaic touch in the story of this quaint sisterhood, which takes it
quite out of the atmosphere of our more chivalrous modern times, is that
twelve of the lot were hanged and most of the others were publicly
whipped through the streets of Rome.

    England was still more backward than France at the time of the
Renaissance. The art of poisoning was not one of those brought back by
the "Italianate Englishman", although it was among those that Roger
Ascham feared, and if it had been it would have found scant
encouragement at home. An Act of Parliament passed in 1531 made
poisoning treason, and provided that those proved guilty of it should be
boiled to death. The first person to suffer this penalty was a certain
cook named Richard Roose, convicted of trying--unsuccessfully--to poison
the Bishop of Rochester, and two other persons at least were executed in
this way at Smithfield before the Act was repealed in 1547. Even in
England, however, rumours of poisoning in high places were always flying
about. There were several such tales of attempts upon the life of
Elizabeth; James I was suspected of having poisoned Prince Henry, and
Charles I of having poisoned his father; it was thought by many that
Cromwell had done away with the Princess Elizabeth, and Cromwell himself
was supposed to have died of poison. Several of the fourteen physicians
who waited upon Charles II gave the opinion that he had been poisoned,
and many tales were current as to the culprit.

    One has no difficulty in understanding, therefore, how the demand
for the alicorn, as for several other articles used to detect the
presence of poison, was built up and maintained, and the prices paid for
alicorns no longer seem incredible when we think of them with the
history of poisoning in mind. All a man hath will he give for his life,
and it is a safe inference from what we know that more than one Italian
city already groaning under taxation had to melt its silver spoons in
order that its lord might pay some northern merchant the sum he asked
for an alicorn. The na•ve device of employing pregustators or "tasters"
which had been sufficient for the ancient Romans had to be abandoned in
a time when, according to general belief, a clever poisoner could
compound a drug that would kill in an hour, a week, or a month, as
pleasure and convenience might dictate. Belief in the poisoner's powers
reached fantastic heights. So sensible and well-trained a man as
Ambroise Pare, trusted physician to the Court of France--and, it must be
said, to Catharine de Medici herself--thought that it was possible to
kill a man by placing poison under the saddle on which he habitually
rode. Pope Clement VII, who owned several alicorns and gave away as many
more, was thought to have been killed by the odours of a poisoned torch.
Poison might be hidden in flowers, in gloves, in rings and bracelets, in
cosmetics. How could it be escaped? Almost all the old writers on
poisons and their antidotes--an important department of the "Advice to
Princes" type of literature--begin by saying that the best security a
prince can have is found in living a righteous life and in making no
enemies; but this counsel was felt to be unworldly and the practice of
it too onerous. There was no real security unless one could find a means
of detecting poison the instant it was brought near one, and upon this
task, therefore, huge erudition and great sums of money were for a long
time expended.

    Besides the alicorn, about a dozen different substances and objects
were used during the Renaissance in the halls of Italian princes and
elsewhere for the detection of poison. These were, in something like the
order of importance: the bezoar-stone, the cerastes's horn,
snake's-tongue, griffin's claw, terra sigillata, vessels of crystal and
of Venetian glass, a‘tites or eagle-stone, snake-stone or ophite, the
stone called "stellio", the toad-stone, the vulture's or raven's claw
hung over a burning candle, rhinoceros horns, walrus tusks, parrots, and
various limestone formations having the appearance of horns. Although a
consideration of these may seem a digression, it will help to clarify
the central problem of the alicorn.

    The beaoar-stone was a calculus, composed of calcium phosphate and
hair, found in the intestines of certain Oriental sheep, goats, monkeys,
and hedgehogs. Similar concretions might have been found, of course, in
European animals, but either this fact was not known or else objects
found near at hand were not valued. Hunters and plainsmen of the western
United States still believe in the magical properties of the
"mad-stone", an object of the same kind found in deer and put to similar
uses, and there seems to have been an active belief in such objects in
Peru before the Spanish conquest. Long known in the Orient and still
used there, these stones were brought to Europe in large quantities by
Portuguese traders from India and were often sold for ten times their
weight in gold. They were usually enclosed in delicately wrought baskets
of gold filigree hung on chains so that they might be dipped into wine.
There are frequent references to the bezoar owned by Queen Elizabeth and
to many others belonging to European monarchs. During the great plagues
in Lisbon bezoar-stones were hired out to sufferers for ten shillings
per day.

    The cerastes is a small poisonous serpent of the Sahara and
Mesopotamia which has two very short protuberances, vaguely like horns,
above its eyes. The belief of the ancients was that it buried itself in
the sand, leaving only these "horns" above it, and that with them it
killed instantly any creature that stepped upon it. The passage quoted
above from Petrarch illustrates the use of these horns in the late
Middle Ages and the Renaissance, when they were set in elaborate
goldsmith's work and placed on the dining-table where all might see
them, in the belief that when poison was brought near them they would
break into perspiration. The similarity between this belief and that
regarding the alicorn is obvious, and a contemporary writer has even
ventured to assert that the cerastes gave the original suggestion for
the whole unicorn legend--thus solving at a stroke to his own
satisfaction a problem which, as he accurately says, "has long perplexed
humanity".

    Albertus Magnus himself had spoken without complete incredulity of
the "virtue" of the cerastes, Peter of Abano gave it his full support,
and all later writers on poisons and antidotes echo in chorus, the
belief spreading from book to book without the slightest reference to
actual experience. The prevalence of the superstition is illustrated by
the belief that the gates of Prester John's palace were composed of
sardonyx mixed with cerastes' horns, so that no poison could be brought
through them undetected.

    Even more commonly used than the horns of the cerastes, probably
because they were more easily obtained, were snake-tongues. These
tongues were suspended, to the number of thirty or more, on elaborate
and often costly dining-table ornaments, usually in the form of golden
trees, and such languiers or "tongue-stands" are sometimes seen to-day
in museums. It was thought that these also perspired in the presence of
poison, and because of the belief that they should be kept as dry as
possible they were usually placed near the salt--and therefore near the
master of the house. In many instances, indeed, the salt-cellar itself
was covered with snake-tongues. Powdered snake-tongue was sold in all
the apothecaries' shops of Europe during the sixteenth century as an
antidote and a protection against poison.

    One of the axioms of magical belief everywhere in the world is that
an object bearing a close resemblance to another object has the "virtue"
or "property" of that other. A curious illustration of this is seen in
the use of the stone called "Glossopetra" or "tongue-stone", really the
petrified tooth of a shark. "This stone", writes Bo‘thius de Boodt, "is
so like a tongue in shape that the vulgar not only call it snake's
tongue but actually think it is that. . . Many people make much of it
for its supposed power against poisons and for keeping off the evil eye.
They say that when poison is brought near to it a sweat or dew breaks
out upon it, thus revealing the intended crime."

    This recalls the very ancient and still existing belief of the East
Indians in a stone with similar properties, sometimes vaguely called in
Europe the "Smaragdus", to be found in a serpent's head. Phiostratus
relates in his life of Apollonius that the snake-charmer lures the snake
out of its hole by incantations, lulls it to sleep, cuts off its head
with a hatchet, and then extracts the jewel. This stone or jewel is said
to contain "a thin crescent-like fibre which oscillates unceasingly in
the centre."  In other words, the fibre resembles a snake's tongue, and
the resemblance has suggested, in the first place, that it is powerful
against poison, and, in the second place, that it is to be found in the
head of a snake.

    From these stones of the Indian snake the transition is easy to the
toad-stones of Europe, commonly worn in finger-rings as amulets and
prophylactics. No doubt because of the representations made by those who
had them for sale, most of the poison-detecting agents were thought to
be very difficult to obtain unless one knew the magic formula, and just
as there was only one way of capturing unicorns so there was only one
quite correct way of securing toadstones. There were a number of books
produced in the late Middle Ages, many of them attributed to Aristotle,
which divulged these magic formulae, and in one of these books those who
wish to secure a toad-stone are instructed to "put a great or overgrown
toad (first bruised in divers places) into an earthen pot, and put this
same in an ant's hillock, and cover the same with earth, which toad at
length the ants will eat. So that the bones of the toad and stone will
be left in the pot." And the test of the toad-stone, to determine
whether it was genuine, was equally simple. "You shall know whether the
toad-stone called Crapaudine be the right and perfect stone or not. Hold
the stone before a toad so that he may see it, and if it be a right and
true stone the toad will leap toward it and make as though he would
snatch it from you, he envieth so much that a man should have the
stone."  Most of the toad-stones in actual use seem to have been
greenish-brown objects about the size of a large pea, and some were
certainly the fossilized teeth of the sting-ray. Finger-rings containing
them are still not uncommon.

    Similarly used but more difficult to obtain was the "griffin's
claw"--in reality the horn of an ibex or a buffalo. There seem to be few
exceptions to the rule that when we can trace back the history of a
griffin's claw to the time when it came into human possession we come to
a saint or some dignitary of the Church, and it is safe to assume a
belief that these claws could be secured only by some holy man who cured
a griffin of a grievous disease and claimed a claw as his fee. Such a
story, which has more than one parallel in folklore, is told of Pope
Cornelius in relation to the claw now kept at Cornelimunster on the
Inde. In the old Cottonian Library there was a claw inscribed "Griphi
unguis divo Cuthberto Dunelmensi sacer", and the supposition is that
Saint Cuthbert acquired it in the regular way. Until the French
Revolution the monastery of St. Denis had a claw which seems to have had
a similar history. All three of those mentioned, and most of those to be
seen in various parts of Germany, have been made into drinking-horns.
They were thought to act like the beakers mentioned by Ctesias and
Aelian when poisoned liquor was drunk from them.

    The old belief concerning cups of crystal and of Venetian glass,
that they would crack when poison was poured into them, is too familiar
to require more than mention. It is a well-known fact, also, that the
carbuncle or ruby--the names were commonly interchangeable in the Middle
Ages--was thought to have an unerring faculty of detecting poison. More
interesting than these was the a‘tites or eagle-stone--so-called
because, according to Pliny, it was to be found only in the eagle's
nest, and was therefore exceedingly rare. The eagle placed it there, as
she also sometimes did the amethyst, to watch over her young while she
was absent, and it was able to do this because of the great antipathy
felt toward it by all serpents. We are told that if a plate containing
poison was placed over this stone no man would be able to eat the food
upon the plate.

    Another belief which carries us far back into primitive magic is
that concerning the vulture's foot, an object that seems to have been in
common use on the dining-tables of the Middle Ages, perhaps because of
its comparative cheapness. The foot was hung in such a way that the
claws surrounded the flame of a candle, and it was supposed that
whenever poison was brought upon the table it would clutch and
extinguish the flame.

    Perhaps the most important of all these amulets and prophylactics,
considering its great age and universal dispersion, is the terra
sigillata, "stamped earth", or earth of Lemnos. This was originally a
red clay dug from a certain hill in the isle of Lemnos on the 6th of
August in every year, with appropriate ceremonies performed by priests
in honour of Diana. Dioscorides informs us that after the clay was dug
it was mixed with goat's blood and stamped with a seal bearing the image
of the goddess. When properly prepared and sent forth with this
hall-mark, the little cakes of clay, a quarter of an inch in thickness
and ranging from the diameter of a sixpence to that of a half-crown,
were regarded by the ancients, and by the people of the Middle Ages and
of the Renaissance as well, as perfect antidotes for all kinds of
poison. The clay was also made into cups, which were thought to render
harmless the most deadly drugs. This earth was one of the seventy-three
ingredients of the theriaca, altogether the most famous and the most
astonishing concoction of ancient and mediaeval pharmacy. As the
Christian centuries wore on the image of the heathen goddess was
displaced by other emblems--among them I have seen the figure of the
unicorn--and other clays, even some from England, were found to be quite
as effective as those of Lemnos; the pagan ritual and the goat's blood
were felt by all good Christians, one need hardly say, to have less than
no value; yet, with all these changes, the general faith in the
substance held on with surprising tenacity. Writers of the sixteenth
century who have only contempt for toad-stones and vultures' claws
retain a deep respect for terra sigillata. They had never known it to do
the slightest good, but it was mentioned by Dioscorides and it came out
of that ancient Greek world which was still regarded, and quite rightly,
as the source of almost all sound medical theory.

    The two substances remaining to be mentioned, the walrus tusk and
the horn of the rhinoceros, point back in the direction of the alicorn.
Among the many different objects passed off by charlatans as verum cornu
monocerotis, probably the most common was the tusk of the walrus,
usually called the "morse" or the "rohart" in old books. I have already
mentioned an amusing passage in Hector Bo‘thius about the hunting of the
walrus among the northern isles. This great fish, he says, swims about
for a long time without taking any sleep, but at last, overcome with
drowsiness, he turns to the shore, finds a convenient bush or tree,
hooks his down-curving teeth over a bough, and falls into a deep
slumber. Then the hunters approach and bind him with ropes, and after
cutting off his teeth, set him free to grow another pair. The tusks are
then straightened artificially and sold as alicorns. Again, we are told
by Dr. Giles Fletcher, writing in 1598, that the fish-tooth which is
called in Russia the Riba-Zuba is used there, and among the Persians and
Bougharians as well, to make the knife and sword-hafts used by noblemen.
"Some use the powder of it against poison, as the Unicornes horn. The
fish that weareth it is called a morse, and is caught about Pechora."
André Thevet asserts that he has actually seen the conversion of walrus
tusks into alicorns performed by charlatans of the Red Sea district, and
the shrewdest of sixteenth-century writers on the unicorn suspects that
the "horns" bought in his day are really marine in their origin.

    The walrus tusk was not regarded as a substitute for the alicorn but
as the thing itself, and the rhinoceros horn owed much of the vogue it
had in Europe to the same estimation. Andrea Marini asserts, indeed,
that the rhinoceros horn had no reputation whatever in his time except
that which it owed to the unicorn--a situation not without ironic humour
for one who realizes how much the legend of the unicorn, and especially
the belief in the magic virtues of the horn, owes to the rhinoceros. It
seems certain, however, that Marini exaggerates, and that the rhinoceros
cup was rather frequently used in Europe by those who had heard of its
Oriental reputation. Portuguese merchants would not neglect so
attractive a commodity. There is still preserved in the Copenhagen
Museum a rhinoceros beaker which Rudolph II of Germany (1575-1612) had
prepared for his own use; another was owned by the Medici family, and
another still, I believe, by the Visconti of Milan. Many more there
probably were, but one cannot distinguish them in the records because
they were one and all described as alicorns.

    The description of the furniture used at the wedding dinner given by
Edward IV for his sister and the Duke of Burgundy illustrates one method
of using the alicorn. Like the horn of the cerastes, the snake's tongue,
the a‘tites, and other objects, it was simply set upon the table, or
near it, so that any change in its appearance might be instantly seen.
We may imagine that the gaiety of mediaeval feasts was somewhat sobered
by the necessity of keeping the eyes fixed upon such objects, and that
the grisly suggestions of the vulture's claw might somewhat impede the
flow of soul, but the Middle Ages seem to have liked strong contrasts.
More commonly, and for a much longer time, the alicorn was used to touch
the food and drink before the meal began, being carried about the table
by an officer of the household detailed for that important trust. When
so employed it was called in mediaeval French "une espreuve a
lincorne",  and was generally attached to a cord or chain by which it
might be hung against the wall when not in use. References to these
espreuves are numerous in old inventories, and the descriptions of them
often indicate the use to which they were put. Thus we read in an
inventory, taken in 1416, of the Dukes of Burgundy: "Une tousche, en
quoy a esté mis une piece de lichorne, pour touschier la viande de
Monseigneur. Even the inventory of the Emperor Charles V refers to "une
touche a licorne, garnie d'or, pour faire essay"--certainly an
interesting article to find in the possession of a man who seems to have
eaten himself to death.

    One can readily imagine that there was a stateliness in this old
ceremony of testing the great man's food and drink that would cause it
to be kept up long after the belief in its magical efficacy had been
abandoned by intelligent people, and one is not surprised, therefore, to
learn that it was maintained in the Royal household of France until
1789, when the Revolution made a clean sweep of all such antiquated
customs. To what extent those who saw this ceremony performed at the end
of the eighteenth century believed in its supernatural value, and to
what extent it was for them merely a graceful ritual, interesting
because it was old, we cannot say. Most of them, probably, could not
have said themselves. The question, however, is an attractive one
because it reveals a situation common to all periods of dying
beliefs--and this is to say all periods whatsoever, "for each age is a
dream that is dying". Even here, almost at the end of its history, the
unicorn continues to illumine the ways of human thought. The ceremony of
touching the king's food and drink, in its various effects upon
different minds, was closely analogous, we may be sure, to the
celebration of the Mass or of any other Christian sacrament. By some,
that is, it would be accepted at "face value" and without question; the
more sophisticated would feel that although they themselves could not
believe in it, yet it would have a wholesome effect upon the
simple-minded and would tend to keep them in order; others would think
that it ought to be abolished because it had no foundation in fact; a
few, the most sophisticated of all, would wish to see it preserved
simply because it was old and dignified and had aesthetic charm. As we
look out across the Christian world of to-day, are not these the chief
varieties of religious opinion that we discover?

    Two hundred years before the ceremony was abandoned--with the heroic
assistance of Madame Guillotine--Chapelain, physician to Charles IX of
France, had said "that he would willingly take away that custome of
dipping a piece of Unicorn's home in the King's cup, but that he knew
that opinion to be so deeply ingrafted in the minds of men that he
feared it would scarce be impugned by reason." Many physicians, he
continued, who had themselves no belief in the alicorn felt obliged to
prescribe it because, if they did not do so and their patients died,
they never had any peace from the surviving relatives. And besides, said
he, any man who undertakes to discredit opinions that have been long
accepted puts himself in the position of an owl that shows itself in
daylight in some prominent place and is persecuted by every other kind
of bird. Chapelain and his numerous kind therefore held their tongues,
and those who think that the beliefs of the people should never be
disturbed will no doubt be charmed with the results--two hundred years
were added to the alicorn's lease of life.

    Unicorn lore provides an exact parallel also for the feeling of a
certain group, well represented in every age, that orthodox belief has a
salutary and stabilizing effect upon the public at large, tending to
make it patient of conditions that agnostics and free-thinkers might not
so quietly tolerate. There is reason to suspect that even in the
sixteenth century the more enlightened tyrants of Italy maintained the
use of the alicorn, not because they themselves had any faith in its
direct action, but rather because they wished others to have such faith,
thinking that it would tend to discourage poisoners. This assertion is
definitely made by Andrea Marini, who wrote freely in Venice, expressing
his own mind; it is strongly implied even by Andrea Bacci, who wrote
under the patronage of the Medici and therefore without any freedom
whatever. Bacci's pen was hired, and his book on the unicorn is a vivid
example of what can happen to a man of sense and learning who is pulled
one way by his respect for truth and another way by what he takes to be
his interests.

    According to Aelian, as the erudite were sure to know, the unicorn's
horn was properly used only in the form of a drinking-vessel. Here arose
a difficulty, for the alicorns of Europe were seldom more than two
inches and a half in diameter at the base, so that it was impossible to
shape satisfactory beakers from them. The difficulty was evaded by
making cups in which a few slices of the horn were inset, or slabs of it
were fitted together to form a tankard. Among the objects once belonging
to Queen Elizabeth that were given by James I to his queen was "one
little cup of unicorn's horn, with a cover of gold, set with two pointed
diamonds and three pearls pendent, being in weight 7 ounces". The King
of England gave to the Duke of Brittany in 1414: "une grande coupe d'or
. . . et y a au fons une licorne et autres choses contre venin". Such
citations might be continued indefinitely, but all that one can find
show that these cups, like the espreuves and the other objects into
which the alicorn was fashioned, belonged solely to the great and
wealthy. The unicorn maintained its aristocratic associations almost to
the end--and this not merely because of the great price of its horn, but
also because only the great fear poison. Seneca had phrased the
situation long before in one pregnant line: Venenum in auro bibitur.

    Slices of the horn were fitted into the handles of table-knives and
salt-cellars, they were shaped into "test-spoons" and sunk in the silver
of table dishes, but in all these forms the alicorn was known only to
the wealthy. Poorer men used it in powdered form and as a therapeutic.
Pharmaceutical ideas were so loose and so uncontrolled by scientific
tests that there was no difficulty whatever in this transfer from one
department of medicine to the other. Such a transfer, indeed, was
inevitable, for the set of beliefs underlying the faith in the alicorn's
supernatural properties were just such as would lead to the acceptance
of it as a valuable antidote and drug. If it was "indicated" as an
antidote against poison, then it seemed to follow that it would be
equally good against the so-called "poisonous diseases". Of these the
most important was the Plague or Pest.

    There is no more pitiful record in the world than that in the scores
of books composed during the Middle Ages on methods of avoiding and
curing the Plague. It is a record both disgusting and ludicrous, but
one's prevailing mood in reading it is that of compassion. Unicorn's
horn is certainly the most pleasing of the materia medica mentioned in
it, and it is as effective as most. I take up the Monumenta Sinoptica de
Peste Preservanda et Curanda, written long after the Middle Ages had
closed by John Collis, and published in 1631. This book names thousands
of drugs sold over the counters of England and Europe less than three
centuries ago as the best means known to science of saving the lives of
one's family and friends from the pestilence that never quite died out.
Many of these drugs are too foul to name and others too ridiculous to
believe in. Hoofs of asses and elks, horns of wild goats and of stags,
viper's flesh and Mathiolus's celebrated oil of scorpions, dust of
scorpions, powdered swallow's heart--one hardly knows whether to laugh
or to weep. For the thought will emerge as one reads that although these
people held views about materia medica which we have abandoned--quite
recently--yet they loved their children somewhat as we do ours. It was
by such means as these that they tried to keep them.

    "Noble and powerful against all poisonous and pestilential diseases
is the unicorn's horn", says a physician of the time when the Plague
took its toll of thousands every year. "Kings and princes and men of
wealth all own it, and they should preserve it for the use of future
generations. Furthermore, as I know from personal experience, it is
highly effective against poisons and all malignant evils."  Powdered
alicorn was recommended as a specific against the Plague by many of the
best physicians of Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. In the English version of Johann Schršder's important
Pbarmacop'ria Medico-Chymica we are told of the "Vertues" of the horn
that "it is Sudorifick, Alexipharmacal, and Cordial, hence it is
commended good against Poysons, infectious diseases, etc. It is also
accounted profitable in the Epelepsie of Infants. The Dose from 4 grains
to half a scruple, sometimes a whole scruple and more." According to
Andrea Bacci the proper dose is ten grains scraped from the inside of
the hornor a piece might equally well be worn as an amulet. Bacci also
says that the Cardinal of Trent, a most "public-minded" man, often gave
away filings from his alicorn "in cases of suspected poisoning,
mushrooms, fever, and pest, for the most part with excellent success".
Laurens Catelan warns his readers that the alicorn, whether in the piece
or powdered, must never be put into hot water, for this destroys all its
virtue, and Conrad Gesner is equally emphatic in saying that only fresh
powder can be used successfully. When the daughter of Henry II of France
fell ill with smallpox in 1557, Anne de Montmorency sent to her nurse a
piece of alicorn with directions that it should be "dissolved" in cold
water and drunk. The water commonly called eau do licorne and sold under
that name throughout Europe was not made in this expensive way, but
merely by standing one end of the horn in a vessel of water, as at St.
Denis. Sometimes a hole was bored through the length of the horn and
water poured through it, but in either case the water was held to be
highly beneficial and found a ready sale. In this way it was made
possible to "drink the horn". Intelligent people, however, seem to have
preferred to take their alicorn in powdered form. How intelligent these
people were may be inferred from a certain illuminating fact of medical
history: the English Royal Society of Physicians was required to issue,
at intervals, lists of the drugs to be carried by every registered
pharmacist in London, and all of the twelve or fifteen lists issued thus
officially between 1651 and 1741 named the unicorn's horn. The general
editor of the last issue including this drug was no less a person than
Sir Hans Sloane. In the edition of 1746 it was tacitly dropped. At about
the same time that the Royal Society of Physicians decided to abandon
the horn, Hogarth expressed his layman's attitude toward it by placing
it in a prominent position in the shop of the quack doctor presented in
the series Manage a la Mode.

    It must be admitted that the English Society was "not the first to
lay the old aside", for Italian and French physicians had been
protesting against the alicorn for almost two centuries before this.
Andrea Marini had ridiculed the whole belief as early as 1566;
Christofle Landré had done all that a courageous and clear thinker could
do to kill it even eight years before that; Ambroise Pare, one of the
most influential physicians of all time, attacked it repeatedly; Laurent
Joubert, another physician to the Court of France, had classed it
contemptuously with powdered pearls and potable gold;  even Pierre
Pomet, a foremost authority, had spoken of it in 1694 as entirely out of
date.  Decidedly, England did not err on the side of precipitation.

    How much responsibility for this lingering of the drug should be
attributed to the apothecaries we can only guess. One of the more
interesting phases of medical history is that of the relationships
between apothecaries and physicians. Often the two parties have been at
league, "for ech of hem made other for to winne", but quite as often
they have been at strife, and both league and strife might be
illustrated, probably, if we knew enough, from the history of the
alicorn. One cannot help thinking it significant that forty years after
Pare's Discours and almost sixty years after Marini's Falsa Opinione
dell' Alicorno, the French apothecary Catelan, who had certainly read
both of these opponents of the whole superstition, brought out his
Histoire de la Licorne, arguing with apparent conviction not only for
the real existence of the animal but for the medical value of its horn.
Considering that he was an intelligent man and a leader in his
profession, it seems fair to recall that he had alicorn powder to sell
and also that he owned a whole alicorn of which he was very
proud--though not to such a degree that he would have refused to part
with it for a suitable sum of money. All the early opponents of the
alicorn were physicians, and no apothecary spoke against it until the
time of Pierre Pomet, who had something "just as good" to offer in its
stead.

    Whatever the apothecaries of Europe may have done to foster the
belief we have been tracing, they certainly did little or nothing to
establish it, for we have seen that the belief goes back at least to the
fourth century before Christ, and it is probably much older still. This
can be said, however, only of India, and the question arises, therefore,
when and by what means the superstition came into the Western world.
Ctesias had made no such assertions about the horn of his onager as
those quoted above from European physicians concerning the alicorn.
Aeian had spoken only of the beakers made from the horn of his
"cartazon". The ancient physicians upon whose works, for the most part
grossly misunderstood, mediaeval medicine was chiefly based, had said
nothing of this marvellous drug. There is no mention of it in
Physiologus, in the patristic writers, in Isidore, or in the Bestiaries.
Hildegarde of Bingen, although she seems not to have heard that the
alicorn had any peculiar medical value, was apparently the first
European writer who thought of the unicorn as possessing magical
properties. To her, as I have pointed out, its entire body was
medicinal, as that of the rhinoceros was thought to be in India.

    From what source is Hildegarde most likely to have derived an idea
of this kind? I should say from the Arabian writers whose influence was
beginning to be felt, through the medium of Latin translation, in just
her time. The unicorn legend had an early and an elaborate development
among the Arabs, who dominated European medicine, both for good and for
ill, from the beginning of the thirteenth century to the revival of
learning, sending out successive waves of influence from the Court of
Frederick II, from Salerno, and from many centres in Spain. Adding
little to Western surgery, anatomy, or nosology, their chief
contribution lay in the field of materia medica, and even this was made
possible chiefly by their contacts, direct and indirect, with the
Orient. Indian physicians are known to have lived at the Court of Bagdad
in the time of Haroun al-Raschid, and there is evidence that they added
Oriental ideas to those that Arabic medicine owed chiefly to the Greek
tradition. Arabic influence is already discernible in Albertus Magnus
and it is controlling in Peter of Abano. Can it be a mere coincidence
that these two are among the earliest European writers who show full
knowledge of the belief in the alicorn? The probability is that this
belief, in its popular form, entered Europe with the Mohammedan invasion
of Spain, spreading from Bagdad--whither it had been taken by Indian
physicians or brought back by Arabian travellers--to Cordova, Seville,
Granada, and finally to Salerno, from whence medical theory radiated
through all of Europe.

    If this seems no more than a conjecture, it is strengthened, at
least, in the definite ascription of the whole belief, by a man who
should have known the facts, to Arabian physicians. Andrea Marini makes
the charge, with anger and contempt, that the use of the alicorn in
medicine was due to the setta de gli Arabi. We should, of course,
remember that by 1566 the "arabistes" were in low repute throughout
Europe, so that anyone who wished to condemn a medical theory would
naturally attribute it to them; but Marini's charge, if that is the
right word, is too plausible to be set aside for such reasons, and it is
supported by the not infrequent references to Arabian authorities made
by European writers on the alicorn.

    There is evidence of another kind which, although not conclusive by
itself, lends further support to the theory of an Arabian origin for
this belief. In the Italian dialects of the fourteenth century and later
the unicorn was variously called licorno, liocorno, leocorno, and
leoncorno. In French the name has always been licorne or lincorne. I
cannot accept the derivation given by Littré's Dictionnaire in which
licorne is traced to the whole Latin word unicoma. A tenable etymology
is suggested by Alfred Hoare, according to which the ordinary Romance
article was prefixed to the Latin coma "and the resulting word was
altered, perhaps under the attraction of Leone, lion". Accepting this
derivation, we may draw from it two significant deductions. It seems
clear, in the first place, that when the basic word licorno--which could
mean nothing but "the horn"--was made, the animal to which the horn
belonged was unknown. After the development of the unicorn legend the
word was applied, not very appropriately, to the animal, and it has done
this double service, both in French and Italian, ever since. We shall
find it worth remembering that, if the present argument is sound, then
"the horn" was known in Italy and was important enough to name in the
most vivid and striking way, before any animal was known or imagined to
which it could be fitted. The second deduction is that this horn must
have seemed in some way impressive to its namers, else they would not
have spoken of it with the simple definite article so as to suggest that
it was the horn par excellence.

    But these are not the only conjectures that may be based upon
etymology. Much more commonly used than any of the Italian names for the
unicorn cited above, and outlasting them all, is the word alicorno,
backed by the Portuguese alicornio. Hoare explains this form without
hesitation by saying that it is due to a prefixing of the Arabic
article. He refers, of course, to the definite article al, seen in many
English words of Arabic origin such as "algebra" and "alcohol".
Alicorno, however, is not of pure Arabic origin; it is a hybrid word.
The Arabic article has apparently been prefixed to the Romance word
licorno already formed, thus giving the word two definite articles fused
together. From these facts I think we may infer rather plausibly that
the Arabs found when they came to Europe some sort of horn sufficiently
remarkable to have attracted attention, and, secondly, that they took
enough interest in this horn and made it sufficiently their own so that
their capping of its name with an additional definite article from their
own language was generally accepted. It seems to me that these
etymological considerations, taken together with the evidence to the
same effect presented above, make a "strong case" for my theory that the
European belief in the alicorn's magical properties was of Arabian
origin.

    That belief was given considerable impetus, centuries later, by the
reports made by Portuguese traders returning from India. The Portuguese
were the chief carriers of bezoar-stones--according to contemporary
belief because the people of their nation were more afraid of poison
than others, but really because they found a huge profit in the trade.
They also brought back most of the rhinoceros horns to be found in
Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, so that they
would find it to their interest to spread and deepen the superstitions
already existing about horns. Furthermore, they had been, without
realizing the fact, in the very land where that superstition had its
largest early development and where it was still accepted most widely.
There is abundance of contemporary testimony regarding the influence of
these traders: "The men of our Portuguese nation", writes Amatus
Lusitanus, "who have penetrated the interior of India, are unable to
tell us anything about the unicorn itself, but they say that its horn is
greatly prized by the Indian kings; and also those who have practised
medicine for some time in that country and have then returned home say
that in India there is no stronger or more dependable antidote against
poison than the horn of the unicorn."

    Merely to understand how this idea may have come into Europe gives
one a little satisfaction, but one would rather know how so strange a
notion ever entered the human mind, and why, once it had found entrance,
it was not instantly thrust forth again. Questions of this kind,
involving the mental habits of men who lived thousands of years ago, one
does well to handle with the least possible suggestion of dogmatic
finality. One can only gather all the facts that seem pertinent, enter
into those facts imaginatively, strive to think as much as possible in
the way of primitive peoples, and then make his conjecture--cautiously,
tentatively, as who should say "How will this do?" But whatever the
difficulty and danger, the question lies too squarely across our way and
is too near the centre and source of unicorn lore to be evaded now.

    "Beginning doubtfully and far away", I should like to point out that
there has existed from early times and in many parts of the world a
vague notion that horns in general, almost any kind of horns, are
somehow prophylactic. For ages the most highly valued drinking vessels,
used by kings as well as cow-herds, were made of horn, and it is
possible that the belief in the medicinal value of such vessels arose in
part from what was said of the wholesomeness of their contents. I have
myself encountered in western America the idea that nothing drunk from a
cow's horn can ever harm the drinker. Lying even behind this belief
there was, and is, the almost world-wide use of horns as charms and
amulets, into which I need not go because the subject has been recently
treated with ample though somewhat too audacious scholarship. Throughout
Italy at the present time, and especially in the south, the "comb"--an
amulet representing a single horn and made of coral, silver, nickel,
bone, and other materials--is used in many ways as a charm against the
evil eye. One sees it even as a watchguard and at the end of a chain
hung round the neck and on the coat-lapel. Roman and Neapolitan
cab-drivers place it on the headgear of their horses, so suspended that
it is constantly in motion and pointing forwards; carters and carriers
hang a large single horn under their wagons; in Italian shop-windows one
often sees fifty or more of these amulets, certainly more popular than
those of any other form, exhibited for sale. Old women of the peasant
class frequently wear many of them at once, concealed beneath their
clothing. From this ancient superstition some suggestion and support,
one cannot say how much, was derived by the notion before us. For the
sake of clarity one may allow himself to say that all horns came to be
regarded as medicinal because they were vaguely associated with
beneficent supernatural powers, although in reality there was no
relationship of cause and effect but merely an overlapping. Such
overlapping and confusion is unmistakable when one looks, for example,
at the pharmacopceia of a Zulu medicine man, which consists usually of
nothing but fifteen or twenty short antelope horns tied together by
thongs. With this outfit the savage physician attacks all devils and
diseases alike, making no distinction between the one group and the
other. These horns are charms and medicines at the same time, and they
are medicines because--for one can scarcely avoid the word--they are
also charms or devil-fighters.

    The belief that all horns have medicinal value and that this value
is of a supernatural sort lasted on, demonstrably, into modern times.
André Thevet, a man of fine intelligence and wide knowledge, could say
at the end of the sixteenth century that "quand tout est diet, il ne se
trouve guere beste . . . dont la corne n'ait quelque merveilleux effect
pour la sauté des bommes."  As an example he names the pyrassouppi found
in the region of the River Plate, large as a mule and with very long
horns which the savages use to cure wounds caused by poisonous beasts
and fishes. He says also, as do many other early authorities, that if
one burns ordinary stag's horn and scatters the ashes on the ground he
will rid the place where they are scattered of all snakes.

    Thevet's mention of stag's horn brings us nearer to the centre of
our problem, for many writers about the alicorn asserted, during the
period when faith in it was breaking down, that the horn of the stag was
really quite as effective. Powdered stag's horn was commonly prescribed
to the poor as a prophylactic during the whole period of the alicorn's
popularity among the wealthier classes, and it is still used in China in
the same way.  Although all horns whatever were regarded as having
medicinal properties, those of the stag were the most important
substitute for the alicorn. Now there is no great difficulty in tracing
the process by which the stag's horn acquired this reputation, and the
knowledge gained in tracing it will provide a clue to the solution of
our main problem.

    In reading the old zoologists one finds a great deal made of
"natural enemies", and what is said of them rests upon one of the
fundamental conceptions in the mediaeval and ancient theories of nature.
Lucretius, to take the most familiar example, tries to explain the
material universe as a system of sympathies and antipathies. There was
no attempt to get behind the assumed loves and hates of primordial atoms
and of all that they composed; no one thought to inquire whether such
loves and hates actually existed; they were axiomatic. One assumed that
every object in the world had its natural friends and foes, and a main
task of science and of magic, during the long period when the two were
scarcely distinguishable, was to find out what these were, for one had
control over an object and could use it for human ends when its
sympathies and antipathies were known. This belief is familiar, yet it
is so important for the present discussion that I venture to emphasize
it by a quotation.

    "By reason of the hidden and secret properties of things", says John
Baptista Porta, "there is in all kinds of creatures a certain
compassion, as I may call it, which the Greeks call sympathy and
antipathy, but we term it, more familiarly, their consent and
disagreement. For some things are joyned together as it were in a mutual
league, and some other things are at variance and discord among
themselves; or they have something in them which is a terror and
destruction to each other, whereof there can be rendered no probable
reason: neither will any wise man seek after any other cause thereof but
only this, that it is the pleasure of Nature to see it should be so,
that she would have nothing to be without his like, and that amongst all
the secrets of Nature there is nothing but hath some hidden and special
property; and moreover, that by this their consent and disagreement, we
might gather many helps for the uses and necessities of men, for when
once we find one thing at variance with another, presently we may
conjecture, and in trial so it will prove, that one of them may be used
as a fit remedy against the harms of the other."

    This is somewhat to our purpose, but what follows is more so. Porta
reminds his readers that the lion is afraid of the cock, that the
elephant and the mouse are natural enemies--a belief which is still
remembered--and then says: "So likewise those living creatures that are
enemies to poisonous things and swallow them up without danger may show
us that such poisons \[that is the poisonous members of the
poison-eating animals\] will cure the bitings and blows of those
creatures. The Hart and the Serpent are at continual enmity: the
Serpent, as soon as he seeth the Hart, gets him into his hole, but the
Hart draws him out again with the breath of his nostrils, and devours
him. Hence it is that the fat and the blood of Harts, and the stones
that grow in their eyes, are ministered as fit remedies against the
stinging and biting of Serpents. Likewise the breath of Elephants draws
Serpents out of their dens, and they fight with dragons, and therefore
the members of Elephants, burned, drive away Serpents. So also the
crowing of a Cock affrights the Basilisk, and he fights with Serpents to
defend his hens, hence the broth of a Cock is a good remedy for the
poison of Serpents. The Stellion, which is a beast like a Lyzard, is an
enemy to the Scorpion, and therefore the Oyle of him, being purified, is
good to anoint the place which is stricken by the Scorpion. A Swine eats
up a Salamander without danger, and is good against the poison thereof."

    This idea of "sympathy" and "antipathy" is encountered everywhere in
mediaeval medicine, as it is also, of course, in the history of magic.
The Consents and Disagreements, as Porta calls them, are often
surprising. In addition to those that he mentions, the goat and the
partridge were so sympathetic that they could be prescribed as medicine
interchangeably; the ram and the elephant were so antipathetic that
elephants always ran away from rams, bellowing with terror; the panther
and the hyena were so uncongenial that the mere skin of a dead hyena
could put the panther to precipitate flight, and if the skins of the
panther and the hyena were hung upside by side the former would soon
lose all its hair.

    But we must not be drawn aside into these arcana. The pertinent fact
before us is that "the stag by nature hates all poysonous things, and
therefore either the feet or skin or the homes of a stag, nayled uppon a
doore, no Serpent will enter in."  Various parts of the stag are
accordingly medicinal, and are especially good against the poison of
snakes--either for the reason that the stag is a "natural enemy" of
snakes or because he eats them and so becomes poisonous himself. To the
modern mind these two "reasons" seem quite distinct, as they probably
were in origin, but I am not aware that any writer who believed the
superstition ever disentangled them; it was not only possible but easy
for really acute thinkers to accept both reasons at once, stressing
either as occasion served. When the medical action of the stag's horn is
explained on the principle of natural antipathy, we have to think of the
horn as extremely pure;  but when, on the other hand, the principle of
sympathy is invoked we are forced to regard it as extremely poisonous in
nature. The physicians of four centuries ago could not agree upon the
rather fundamental question whether the stag's horn and similar
substances were essentially poisonous or essentially pure, but the
members of both schools of opinion continued to administer those
substances in their medical practice with perfect confidence and
probably with good results. When a modern reader first encounters this
absurd situation he is moved to what Hobbes calls "a sudden glory" and
is tempted to exult a little over the childish fumbling past--but then
he recalls the still unresolved conflict between allopathy and
homceopathy, which is in essentials the same conflict as that waged in
the Middle Ages, and he decides not to laugh.

    Medical action by sympathy, as many of the old writers on materia
medica explain, requires that the alexipharmical or therapeutic agent
shall be of a stronger and more concentrated "virtue" than the thing or
condition to be affected, so that it will be active and the other
passive. This explains the choice of such supposedly powerful and highly
concentrated poison-cures as viper's flesh, the ingredient added to the
theriata by one of Nero's physicians. It explains, also, most of the
prophylactics and poison-detectors of the Middle Ages and Renaissance
that I have named above. The cerastes was thought to carry its poison in
its horns; these horns were therefore regarded as exceedingly poisonous,
and it was believed that they would have power over any poison less
potent and concentrated than that which they contained. Snakes were
thought to "bite" with their tongues--a belief held by most people
to-day--and therefore snake's tongue, whole or powdered, could detect
and cure poison. The vulture's entire body was considered poisonous, and
its foot particularly so; all toads were thought venomous, and the
stones in their heads, like the snake-stones of India, were held to be
concentrated venom. The poisonous nature of the eagle-stone was not so
easy to detect or explain, but the eagle does not leave this stone in
her nest to guard her young against snakes for nothing; her instinct may
be trusted.

    In all this mountain of error there was, of course, a grain of sound
and precious truth, and no one can fail to do honour to the long
struggle of thought which finally isolated the principle similia
similibus curantur. This principle, to be sure, was well understood by
the ancients and was taught by Galen, who said explicitly that certain
poisons attract poison as the magnet does iron. Aristotle pointed out 
that poisonous reptiles seem immune to poison and can eat one another
without suffering harm. Saint Ambrose says explicitly "venenim veneno
excludatur". One of the most satisfactory statements of the principle to
be found in early writers is that of Antonio Ludovico, who says that
nothing except poison can expel poison and that the antidote is not
hostile to the poisonous substance, as some suppose, but is "bound to it
by invisible chains of everlasting and indissoluble amity."

    The principle, then, was sound, and it had long been familiar, but
the applications of it are often highly diverting. Thus there was a
general belief, lasting until at least 1700, that the elk is a chronic
sufferer with vertigo and that he has been able to discover only one
thing that will give him any relief. The inconvenience of this will be
imagined when one is told that whenever he is pursued by hunters and
dogs he has to sit down and place his left hind foot in his left ear to
cure himself of dizziness before he can run away. But this infirmity of
elks was simply another proof of Emerson's dictum that "Nature is
ancillary to man" and also of the proverb: "God works in a mysterious
way his wonders to perform." The left hind hoof of the elk was
prescribed for centuries as an unfailing specific for vertigo, epilepsy,
falling sickness, mal de mer, and dipsomania, with careful directions
for distinguishing the left hind hoof from the right. Amulets of this
material are still worn in Italy as protection against the falling
sickness and the evil eye.

    Coming now to our central question, why the alicorn was supposed to
sweat in the presence of poison, we may answer, in accordance with what
we have learned from the study of stag's horn and other substances, that
it does so either because of sympathy or because of antipathy with that
poison. Explanation according to the latter principle was of course the
more natural one during the centuries when the unicorn was always
thought of as a symbol of Christ, as associated with the Virgin, and as
a type of purity, but Arabian influence, based upon Galen, seems to have
swung opinion over to the other interpretation--that, namely, according
to the principle of sympathy, which required that the alicorn be thought
of as highly poisonous.

    A clear statement of this view is made by Laurens Catelan, although
it is not original with him. Those parts of any animal, he begins by
saying, are strongest and fullest of the animal's "virtue" upon which
its life depends. In horned animals these parts are the horns. Now it is
well known--or so Catelan assumes--that horned animals have a keen
appetite for poisonous substances both animal and vegetable, and of
course the essence of these substances is drawn into their essential
members, their horns. All horns, therefore, are necessarily poisonous in
a high degree, for all the poisons that their bearers have eaten is
concentrated in them. There is no difficulty in seeing, then, why it is
that when all the poison that would ordinarily be distributed through
two horns is forced into one it is brought to a very strong focus
indeed. The alicorn is clearly one of the most poisonous substances in
the world, and with all these facts in mind, Catelan submits, no
sensible man can fail to believe the marvels related of it. The alicorn
sweats when standing near poison, he thinks, because of a desire to
mingle with its like, and when taken as a drug it overcomes and carries
off such feebler poisons as arsenic and corrosive sublimate by virtue of
its own more powerfully poisonous nature. Why it is that so deadly a
substance as this does not kill the patient instantly, how it happens
that it can be brought into contact with one's food and drink or worn at
one's neck as an amulet with impunity, Catelan and his fellows neglect
to inform us.

    This theory is too ingenious and has too much of the mark of the
clever apothecary upon it for one to accept it as a product of primitive
minds, and yet it may contain some primitive elements. Catelan's
confident assertion that the unicorn eats snakes and drinks poisoned
water implies an intimate knowledge of the animal's habits such as few
other writers have claimed, but the assertion is helpful in suggesting
that the whole mystery may rest upon a matter of diet. Even those who
think of the unicorn as essentially pure sometimes attribute his virtues
to the food he eats. Thus Hildegarde of Bingen says that once in every
year the animal goes to that land in which the juices of Paradise abound
and there seeks out the best herbs, digging them up with his hoof; from
these he derives his medicinal properties. It will be remembered that
Hildegarde thought the whole body of the unicorn medicinal, and also
that the same belief is held in India regarding the rhinoceros. Now we
learn from Linschoeten's Voyages that the horns of the rhinoceros are
valued in India according to the flora of the district from which they
come. "All Rhinocerotes", says the traveller, "are not alike good, for
there are some whose homes are sold for one, two, or three hundred
Pardawes the piece, and there are others of the same colour and
greatness that are sold but for three or four Pardawes, which the
Indians know and can discerne. The cause is that some Rhinocerotes which
are found in certain places in the countrie of Bengala have this virtue
by reason of the hearbes which that place only yeeldeth and bringeth
foorth, which in other places is not so." A belief so constant as this,
common to both schools of interpretation, may well derive from a source
far back in time.

    The explanation of the alicorn's "virtue" in terms of "sympathy" and
"antipathy" was cogent enough for ordinary minds, but it could not stand
the scrutiny of a really thoughtful man such as Andrea Marini. He
pointed out that poisons are of many kinds, some hot and some cold, some
wet and others dry, and that therefore it was absurd to say that one
substance could stand in a relation either of sympathy or of antipathy
with all of them at the same time. This contention was unanswerable, and
it had a deep influence upon later writers. Andrea Bacci, whose book on
the unicorn appeared in the same year as Marini's, was forced by it to
abandon the sympathy-antipathy explanation altogether and to fall back
upon a pseudo-Aristotelean forma and essentia which really explained
nothing. He also accepted a vague Arabian assertion that alicorn somehow
"comforts the heart", but the question as to why it sweats in the
presence of poison he confuses and avoids as much as possible, finally
leaving it unanswered.

    Such light as I have thus far been able to throw upon the mystery of
the alicorn's magical properties may be helpful in an attempt to solve
the further mystery of what I have called the unicorn's water-conning.
We are fortunate in having a description of this performance by one who
claims to have been an eye-witness. This is John of Hesse, a priest of
Utrecht, who visited the Holy Land in 1389 and had the most
extraordinary good luck in the things he saw there. "Near the field of
Helyon", he says, "there is a river called Marah, the water of which is
very bitter, into which Moses struck his staff and made the water sweet
so that the Children of Israel might drink. And even in our times, it is
said, venomous animals poison that water after the setting of the sun,
so that the good animals cannot drink of it; but in the morning, after
the sunrise, comes the unicorn and dips his horn into the stream,
driving the poison from it so that the good animals can drink there
during the day. This I have seen myself."

    One may point out in passing the strange coincidence that John of
Hesse should have seen this rare spectacle at just the spot made famous
by the miracle of Moses to which it provides so striking a parallel. For
the bitter waters of Marah in the Bible story we have here the water
poisoned at night by unclean animals; Moses and his staff are matched by
the unicorn and its horn; the Children of Israel are represented by the
clean animals waiting beside the stream. The two stories correspond in
every essential detail, so that John's statement amounts almost to a
declaration that he saw the ancient miracle re-enacted symbolically upon
the spot.--But this is one of those mysteries into which the lay mind
may not hope to pierce.

    Leaping now almost five hundred years we find a traveller of the
nineteenth century giving almost the same account of the water-conning
trait as that given by John of Hesse. "One evening," says he, "as I was
sitting among the rocks with a party of natives, the conversation turned
upon flags. A man sitting there said to a stranger, 'Why do the English
put the wyheed el win, that is the unicorn, on their flag?' and then
related the whole story of it as one well known through the length and
breadth of the land. 'The unicorn is found in a vast country south of
Abyssinia. There the animals, undisturbed by man, live after their own
laws. The water does not flow in rivers, but lives in the bosom of the
soil. When the others wish to drink, the unicorn inserts his horn into
the earth: with this he scoops a pool, satisfies his own thirst, and
leaves what he does not require to the rest. So these English have the
privilege of first discovering all things and then the rest of the world
may come after.'"

    In this late version the trait appears somewhat altered and debased:
the unicorn does not purify but merely uncovers the water--one should
observe, however, that he does this with his horn rather than with his
hoof as another animal would--and his service to other beasts is not so
much altruistic as accidental. Yet, for all these changes, the story is
recognizably the same as that told by John of Hesse and many others.

    Regarding the origin of the water-conning trait I shall make one
suggestion here and another, somewhat farther reaching, in a later
chapter. Popular beliefs about the stag have already served us well and
may do so again. This animal, it will be remembered, is devoted to a
diet of snakes, and in general he seems to thrive upon it, but
sometimes, as Pliny informs us, a snake gets on the stag's back and
bites him cruelly, whereupon he rushes to some river or fountain and
plunges into the water to rid himself of his foe.  Here we have at least
a horned animal, a snake, and water brought together. A few sentences
from the subtle and fascinating book by Antonio Ludovico from which I
have already quoted, will carry us somewhat farther. Stags are
accustomed to increase their strength, says he, upon a diet of serpents,
but when they are quite saturated with this food, and before they begin
to feel the noxious effects of the poison, they go down to the great
rivers and there submerge their bodies, leaving only their mouths above
the water. They do not drink a drop, however they may suffer with
thirst, but remain standing there until the poison is sweated in the
form of tears through their eyes, and then they leave. These tears,
hardened into balls, fall by the wayside and are gathered by the people
of the country, who value them as antidotes for poison. The barbarians
call them bezoars.

    It may seem that this story, however interesting in itself, leaves
us still a long way from the unicorn dipping its horn into the water,
but a little reflection will show, I think, that the analogy is rather
close. We have already learned that the poison in the unicorn's body is
not dispersed, as it appears to be in the stag mentioned by Ludovico,
but is concentrated in the horn--the single horn. It seems natural,
then, whenever the unicorn goes to the water to seek relief from an
excess of poison, if that is indeed his motive, that he should dip the
horn alone. Furthermore, it would follow naturally from the poisonous
quality of the horn that whatever venom there might be in the water
would be dispersed. This, at any rate, is the explanation of the
water-conning trait that Laurens Catelan seems to have had in mind, for
he says that the unicorn's well-known fierceness is caused by the great
pain he suffers constantly on account of the poison in his horn, and
that he knows no other way of obtaining relief except that of returning
to the poisoned stream by which his pain is partly caused. (There has
never been any lack of allegorical possibilities in the unicorn legend;
the difficulty is in avoiding them.)

    This is not a completely satisfying explanation of the water-conning
trait because it gives no clue to the reason why the water is poisonous
and it does not include the other animals which, in nearly all versions
of the story, wait beside the water for the unicorn's coming. With these
details unaccounted for we cannot feel that we have reached the origin
of the story, but the passages quoted do carry us as far back toward
that origin as any one in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance ever went,
and this must suffice at present. We shall encounter the water-conning
trait again, and shall be able, if not to "explain" it, at any rate to
set it high among the myths and legends that are so ancient as for ever
to defy explanation.
