# CHAPTER I

### THE PROVISIONS OF NATURE

IN the animal kingdom a dead body arouses no feelings of fear or
repulsion. In most cases it is looked upon as a generous gift of Nature,
of which the fullest advantage is to be taken, or the opportunity lost
to competition.

It is difficult to appreciate how vast a number of birds, beasts and
insects inhabit the fields and woods, and we may well ask ourselves the
question "What becomes of their dead?" In a day's search we may not find
among all the teaming wild population a single stiffened body, or one
bright eye glazed in death. Here in a clearing we may have chanced upon
some blood-stained grass, and a few scattered feathers, which gave
evidence of the hawk or carrion crow, but this is very far from
accounting for anything like the greater proportion of the short-lived
race.

Has Nature, then, her undertaker? Certainly she has. He is appropriately
known as the Necrophorus mortuorum, or more popularly as the sexton
beetle, for he is equipped with spade and all that is necessary for
"undertaking."

There is much that the human variety might learn from this humble and
industrious insect. Whilst he is dressed in a conventional garb of
black, he seeks to enliven matters by means of two broad bands of yellow
on his back. He is cheery, and when his duties are over for the day he
indulges in a little music, not perhaps entirely a matter of art for
art's sake, but like most joyous notes of nature, his immediate object
is to attract the attention of the opposite sex.

In praising the Necrophorus mortuorum, we must admit that in his work he
is not actuated by motives of disinterested philanthropy any more than
is the case with the human undertaker.

Nature is indeed far too wise to entrust any important work to the
spasmodic efforts of the well-intentioned. If she wants a job done
thoroughly, she does not grudge a reasonable wage for services rendered.

If during our lives we are often able to disguise from ourselves that we
are but superior animals, the disabilities of birth and death bring the
fact unmistakably before us.

The helplessness of a new-born babe is proverbial, but Nature has
provided it with the means of making its urgent necessities unmistakably
apparent, and she has not been less considerate to the corpse.

We must not be shocked to hear that it is by means of the olfactory
organ that the sexton beetle is made aware of the proximity of a new
"client." Once having sensed a job, he communicates the good news to his
wife, and together they fly off to the house of mourning by the shortest
possible route--for competition is keen.

Arrived at the spot, they find the corpse to be that of a recently
deceased mouse.

"Having feasted," other helpers having also arrived, the male beetle
proceeds to excavate around the body, till by a process of gradual
undermining it sinks into a considerable hollow, thus prepared for its
reception.

The work is finished by piling the earth neatly on the top.

For the purpose of excavation Nature has provided the sexton beetle with
club-shaped antennae, which are supported by strong muscles equal to the
work that they are called upon to perform. It should be stated that Mrs.
Beetle remains in possession of the body in which her eggs are laid.
Surely this is a sanitary and logical conclusion to a commonplace event,
in which everybody concerned is paid off and satisfied.

It teaches a lesson that burial is a natural method of disposing of the
dead, and it gives more than a hint, that believe what we will of the
prospects of a future life, death is only a rather misleading term for a
changed, by no means an impaired, activity.

It will be self-evident that in dealing with the larger animals, such as
bears, lions, etc., the sexton beetle, however numerous and industrious
be his kind, would be sorely taxed if he received a call from a client.
We must not, however, under-rate the extraordinary power of the insect
world when working together with a common objective.

In the jungle the greater feeds on the lesser, and the jackal and
vulture scavenge what remains.

The busy workers living in organized communities deal with their dead on
lines more akin to human necessities. Their own dead, or a chance
intruder into the ant-hill city, will be treated with system and
dispatch, and the body removed long before it has any opportunity to
prove offensive or dangerous to the community.

The ants, being carniverous, will quickly devour any beasts or insects
which may die near their nests, and if anything uneatable remains, a
squad of workers will be summoned at once to remove the offence to some
more convenient place.

The bee, having no use to make of the body, has but one idea, and that
is to expel the corpse, or so deal with it that the carefully regulated
atmosphere of the hive shall not suffer from the presence of any
poisonous fumes.

The workers of their community who are set apart for scavenging
purposes, will soon eject a body by shouldering or pushing it out of the
hive. If the intruder be a slug or snail, it may happen that it has
climbed into such a position that its bulk will render it impossible for
the bees to deal with it in the ordinary manner. In such a case the
unhappy adventurer is quickly walled up with wax in the position in
which he is found, and the tomb hermetically sealed past all fear of any
harm to the city.

At exactly what period superstition affected death and burial, it is of
course impossible to say. Perhaps it was taught to man by the sigh of
the wind in the trees, or the dramatic terrors of the
thunderstorm--however it came about, we know that the possibility of a
spirit world was an early consideration.

The valiant hunter, undismayed by fierce encounters with wild beasts and
his own kind, learned to crouch and shiver at the shadows, or, having
slain his adversary, he fled from the accusing eye and hid from the
avenging spirit. Even to-day, amongst savage tribes, it is quite common
to find the shadow of a man attacked by the witch-doctor, in the belief
that it is the soul.

We may well suppose that in such matters a very long time would elapse
before anything concrete enough to be called a religion took possession
of man's mind. Asked by a missionary what were the gods he worshipped, a
savage replied: "We know that someone walks amongst the trees at
night--but we never mention it."

This is probably the state of mind of the early inhabitants of the
earth.

With a belief in good and evil spirits inhabiting material things, we
can at once trace this influence in funeral customs, for there is hardly
a practice which has not had its origin in the old dread of haunting and
revengeful ghosts.

When the next stage is reached--a belief in a general participation in a
future life--a whole range of interesting happenings develop.

These are the foundation stones upon which our present day usages are
built, varying in accordance with all sorts of minor considerations,
such as climatic environment, etc.

Belief in a future state presupposed a material existence after death,
with corresponding material necessities. Food must be provided, weapons
and clothing, and a supply of charms with which to ward off those evil
influences which the soul might expect to encounter on its journey.

Special provision would be made for those of rank-wives and servants for
the chief, and a horse and attendant for the warrior and hunter.

This early attitude of mind was based on the supposition that death
would surely bring with it that completeness of desire too often
unsatisfied during the earthly existence.

That the ultimate state was one of happiness, seems to have been
generally taken for granted. Can we say that the symbols used by a past
generation as expressions of a state of bliss--such as crowns, harps,
streets paved with gold and gates of pearl--have not often enough been
accepted literally, and on no higher lever than the "Happy Hunting
Ground" of the American Indian?

Amongst these materialistic views we may place the idea of death as an
endless sleep or physical rest, too long denied to tired laborious
lives.

We shall have evidence enough that a literal acceptance of this figure
of physical rest and sleep in the grave represents the real aspirations
of a number of people to-day, as in a past generation.

Thus we find a conception of the soul linked in various ways to earthly
associations.

Loosed from the body, it was once supposed that the spirit quickly
returned to its old surroundings, gifted with many supernatural powers,
against which the living were unable to conceal their thoughts.

It is indeed a sad insight into the human conscience to discover what
elaborate precautions were considered necessary in order to avoid the
persecutions of the revengeful dead.
