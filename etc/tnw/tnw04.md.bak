WHAT is the meaning of the word Idealist, or Idealistic, as used by
Nobel in this Testament?

The question is not—What is Idealism? It is—what kind of books did the
Testator wish to receive this Prize?

It will be seen at once that the second of these questions is very much
easier to answer than the first. No one has ever succeeded in defining
poetry to any one else's satisfaction—a chemist might define it as the
crystal of prose—but universities and academies award prizes every year
for poems, and no difficulty is felt as to what works are eligible for
the prize. Again, an able writer named Austin once set himself to
determine the province of jurisprudence. He died leaving his work
unfinished; and the extensive fragment that remains is an endless chain
of definitions, not one of them complete. He attempts to define a law, a
right, and so on, and the more he toils, the more endless his task
becomes.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yet the Courts
never sit for a day without using the words law and right in some
practical application; and Austin was himself professor of
jurisprudence.

The difference between a legal argument and a logical one is that the
former is concerned with some practical issue, such as the disposal of a
sum of money, and is determined by the judgment of a Court. That is the
difference which Nobel has made by this bequest. This bag of gold of his
has seemed to me a talisman, trusting in which we may adventure in the
enchanted wood of words; by means of which we may conjure the demons
that infest it, and compel the sorcerer's victims to resume their
natural shape.

As well as a talisman, we are provided with a compass, by the words
which are the governing clause of the whole
[Testament](errata.htm#0.md)—"the benefit of mankind." Should we be tempted
to stray into devious paths, should we find ourselves wandering round
and round without advancing from our starting-point, we have only to
glance at this compass, and it will point us forward in the right
direction, towards the enchanted castle of the ogre.

So armed, so guided, the White Knight Errant ought to reach his bourn.

I

*Ideal*, *Idealism*, *Idealist*—these words are current in most of the
languages of America and Europe, but they are not natives of any. They
appear in the

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

same form in Swedish and in English, but they are not of Swedish nor of
English growth. They wear a look of ancient Greece, but yet they are not
genuine Greek words. Plato never heard of them; the Greek lexicon knows
them not.

They belong to a large and increasing class of words which I can best
characterise by naming them Babu.

The English in India, whether to make the task of government easier, or
in the belief that our civilisation must be better for the Hindus than
their own, have set up schools to train the natives in our ways, and, to
begin with, in our speech. There is a large class of natives called
Babus who learn very readily up to a certain point, that is to say, they
spell our words correctly, and they have some notion of what the words
mean; but English has not replaced their native speech, and hence it
fits them like a borrowed garment, and they are betrayed into awkward
and laughable mistakes in using it, which have given rise to the term
Babu English.

Now that is just the process from which a great part of Europe, and
especially England itself, has been suffering for many hundreds of
years. Our speech bewrays us to be the freedmen of Rome. Our schools are
Roman schools set up by missionaries from the Mediterranean in whose
minds it was the very aim and end of education to tame the young
barbarian of the North into an obedient provincial of the great Roman
Raj. Saint Ninian, it is candidly

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

recorded, went to convert the Picts to Christianity in the hope of
putting an end to their attacks upon their Christian neighbours. The
work of the monks has remained practically untouched ever since. Our
schools are still called grammar schools, which means Latin-grammar
schools, and Latin is the chief thing taught in them. Latin is the
official language of our universities, and by an educated man we mean a
man who has been taught Latin. The whole theory of our education still
is that the young Englishman should make-believe to be an ancient Roman.
The king who still writes himself on his coins *Britannorum Rex* is
doing homage for his crown to Pope and Caesar.

After the Normans came in aid of the monks England seemed to hang in
doubt between the Gothic and Romance dialects. The result of this is
seen in our vocabulary. We have, in a more marked degree than any other
European people, two sets of words, folk words and book words. The first
we learn at home, and use most in talking; the second we learn at
school, and use most in writing. The folk words come to us as the
wrappings of our earliest thoughts and feelings, and form, as it were,
the mind's natural skin. The book words follow after the brain has began
to harden, and are more like clothing which the mind puts on. We use
them as children who walk in wooden shoes,—not with the same sure and
elastic tread as they who go barefoot.

Let it not be thought that all this is beside the

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

question. It goes to the heart of the question. That schoolmaster's
Latin should be a Latin which would make Cicero stare and laugh is a
little evil. But that men should go through life talking to one another
in words which they only half understand is a great evil. And that
children should have their minds beaten and bent out of shape by such
words has long seemed to me the most frightful evil in the world.

There is a word which we spell quack, and our Dutch kinsfolk *kwak*.
With us it means a false pretender to knowledge; in Holland it is the
nickname for a Latin-school pupil. The little Dutch street boy in the
Middle Ages, listening outside the door of the Latin school, heard the
boys inside repeating their *hic hæc hoc*, and it sounded to him like
the gabbling of ducks.

I share the feeling of that little street boy. I also stand
[outside](errata.htm#1.md) the door of the Latin school, and listen to the
patter that goes on inside, without any reverence. I should like to
break open the door of the Latin school, and take that dusty, dog-eared
grammar-book out of the schoolmaster's hand, and put an end for ever to
that miserable gabble.

Somehow I think that the work of the Idealist will have to begin here.

II

Unhappily the priests of science have shown themselves not less prone
than other priesthoods to impose

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

on the mind of man by means of bad language. To the medieval plague of
dog-latin there has succeeded in these latter days the plague of Babu
Greek.

The apologists for this vice of science tell us that it is merely a kind
of shorthand. I am sorry I do not find that it is really quicker to
write *dolichocephal* than longhead, or *ichthyosauros* than eft.

But in any case the number of readers who carry at their tongue's end
all the words found in the extant remains of Hellenic literature is very
small. So that whatever trouble the specialist may save to himself by
writing *chaemoprosopic* for broad-faced, he causes to his readers, who
have to turn the shorthand into longhand as they go along. Hence a
modern scientific work is not truly a book. It is more and more a manual
in which the text is helped out by technical signs. It is not so much
literature as algebra.

III

Nevertheless if the use of these bastard Mediterranean words were
confined to the naming of things like rocks and plants and animals the
quarrel with them might be left to the man of letters. Words like amoeba
and neolithic are ugly and tiresome, but they are not false and
mischievous. There is even a subtle elegance in naming fossils in a
fossil tongue.

It is a very different matter when such words are

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

caught hold of to name thoughts instead of things; and when men
make-believe that they have said something in shorthand which they could
not say in longhand.

The difference cannot be illustrated better than by two words which are
peculiarly associated with the name of Nobel—*dynamite* and *idealist*.

Dynamite is the name of a mixture which Nobel made, and as long as we
have the mixture itself the name is of no consequence. The mixture might
as well have been named *strongness* or *starkhet*, or X, or *nobelite;*
even if it had been labelled by the Greek word for weakness instead of
strength it still would not have mattered. Because if we want to know
what dynamite is we need not go to the Greek lexicon; we can go to the
mixture itself.

Now that is just what we cannot do in the case of the word idealist. If
Nobel had pointed out any book, for instance Swedenborg's *Arcana
Coelestia*, or Kant's *Kritik der reinen Vernunft*, or Carlyle's *Sartor
Resartus*, as the kind of book he meant to receive the prize, we should
have had something in the nature of a mixture. As it is, "idealist"
remains the name of a thought in Nobel's mind. Instead of being able to
look past the name of the thing, we have to guess, if we can, the
thought from the name.

It is just here that the harmfulness of Babu makes itself manifest. It
is when we pass from the outer world of things to the inner world of
thoughts that we need to be most careful of the words we use;

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

it is then that the Mediterranean words are apt to serve us like
ill-made panes of glass through which the light comes crookedly; and the
spirit of man, bound in these borrowed cerements, ceases to soar and
grow.

It was not by accident that the Protestant Reformation began with the
translation of the Bible, and ended with the translation of the Mass
Book. The great reformers disagreed about many other things, but a
common instinct made them teach men to pray in their native tongue. They
reformed the churches—the pity of it is that they did not reform the
schools.

IV

The word before us, then, is not a label, the sort of word that the old
Mediterranean grammar-books call a noun. It is what they ignorantly call
an adjective; it is the expression of a feeling, like those unshapen
cries in which speech began. It is the expression of a wish; perhaps a
wish not quite distinct in the Testator's own mind; perhaps a hope
rather than a wish.

It seems to me that he may have used an indistinct word because his wish
was indistinct. He may have hoped that he could say in shorthand what he
could not say in longhand, that Babu could say what Swedish could not
say. I think, on the other hand, that if he had cast about to find a
Swedish word it

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

would have helped us to understand his wish. I think that to translate
his word would be almost to interpret it.

The mind may be likened to a tree whose roots are feelings and whose
leaves are words. Some words leave off where they begin, they are
emotions expressed in sound, like musical notes—such as the old
grammar-books call interjections. But most words have taken shape by
coming into touch with outside sounds, and with the sights and scents,
the tastes and touches, that go together with the sounds. Whether the
word thing or think comes first in history, a thought is a feeling
outlined by means of things.

In this way there is in every word a native element of feeling, or a
mark set on it by the word of sense, which cleaves to it through
whatever uses it may pass and change. The word may be abstracted and
refined away, till it appears like a balloon in the air; but still it
will be a captive balloon, attached by some root meaning, as by a cord,
to the firm earth beneath.

Philology is busy with the changes in the forms of words. Our lexicons
have long been cabinets of shells. Yet the morphology of words is but a
drudgery unless it helps us towards their physiology.—The word Idealist
is such a shell. Let us see what its outward form can tell us of the
life within.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

V

Idealist is a Babu formation from the Greek *Idea*.

*Idea*, my Greek lexicon reports, is the appearance of a thing, as
opposed to its reality. And it is unfortunately the case that some such
sense as that of opposition to reality does haunt the word Idealist, and
discredit it. No one is likely to believe that works of an apparent or
unreal tendency are of much benefit to mankind. We must dig deeper.

*Idea* can be traced to *ido*, or *eido*, (for there were more Greeks
than those who corrected Demosthenes)—meaning to look or see. It is the
Aryan word which has become in English *though*. "It is as though" means
"it looks like." And so the word idea, in its first sense, may be
rendered pretty closely by the English *look*, in such uses as—"the look
of the thing," "there is a look of his father about him."

The passage from the idea to the ideal was not made by the Greeks. But
it seems that *idea* is the Ionian form of the word which meets us in
other Greek dialects as *eidos*, and although the Greeks did not add the
important letter *l* to *Idea*, they did add it to *eidos;* and their
*eidolon* is spelt by us *idol*. What is the difference between the
ideal and the idol?

The idol is the idea embodied in wood or stone. It seems to have grown
solid by degrees. There was first the mere look, or likeness, and next
the ghost.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We catch the shade
of meaning in passing from "appearance" to "apparition." Lastly there
came the marble likeness of the ghost; as it were, the materialised
idea.

Now whatever else the ideal may be, it is not a marble image. Bacon, it
is true, uses the word idol in a sense not far removed from ideal. He
uses it as a Christian metaphor for thoughts that receive honour not
their due, as the images of Jupiter and Venus received honour due to
Christ. But if we should take ideal as meaning a thought that received
too much honour, it is clear that a work of an idealist tendency would
be harmful, rather than beneficial, to mankind. Nevertheless Bacon's
usage gives us a useful hint. The ideal is evidently a thought rather
than a statue, and to that extent it may be called a metaphorical idol.

In what, then, does it differ from an idea? The Greek lexicon has not
half done its work in telling us that *idea* meant appearance. Even in
Plato's time it had got farther than that. Aquinas, who wrote in Latin,
and translates it by the Latin *forma*, explains *idea* as being the
builder's plan of a not-yet-built house. Now my Dutch word-book renders
"idea" (as an English word) by *ontwerp*, which is to say,
out-throw—that which the mind throws out, and not what it takes in. And
in Holland a builder's plan is called an *ontwerp*. When the mind of a
great Roman theologian jumps with the common mind of a Dutch folk, we
ought to be able to take

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

the result with some security. And it is the opposite pole of the
meaning given us by the lexicon. The idea is not the appearance of a
thing already there, but rather the imagination of a thing not yet
there. It is not the look of a thing, it is a looking forward to a
thing.

Here, then, is the difference between the ideal and the idol. The ideal
is not the realisation in brick and mortar of the builder's plan, as the
idol is the realisation in marble of the sculptor's plan. The ideal is
not a house made with hands; it is a castle in the air.

VI

The word *ideal* first appears in English as an adjective. The added *l*
has much the same force in Greek and English, the force of -ly or like,
the Swedish *lik*. It is hard not to see in this like a connection with
look, such as that between *idea* and *ido*. English philology, however,
speaking by the latest of its interpreters, traces it to the old English
*lic*, meaning a body, like another Swedish *lik* (corpse). If that were
so, the ideal would be again the embodied idea, in short the idol. It
would be the house, and not the castle in the air.

Of course it is not so. It puts the cart before the horse. Philology has
made its favourite mistake of thinking the noun is older than the
adjective. The name of an outward shape is never the first form

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

of any word, unless it be a word like cuckoo, or the French word
*teuf-teuf*. We must dig deeper. When we come down to such a word as
*lick*, the Swedish *slika*, the very sound of the tongue in licking, we
cannot go much farther; and we may be sure that we have got the root of
the word, and all words naturally springing out of it. We do not need to
look in Beowulf or the Saxon Chronicle for the meaning of such a word.
English philology has gone blind through too much poring over
manuscripts. The Old English manuscripts that have come down to us are
few, and they are not very old. There are more fish in the sea than in
the fisherman's net.

The early man was a poet before he was a philologist, and perhaps it
takes a poet to understand those words of his, which were not dead
shells, but living cells, growing and changing with his growing and
changing moods. What the tongue does in licking is what the eye does in
looking, it feels-forth, reaching outward from the man. The words look
and see contain between them the whole secret of metaphysics. To look is
to search forth for what may be there; to see is to take in what the
look finds. Looking is the question, and sight the answer. Sight is
materialistic, perhaps looking may turn out to be idealistic.

If, then, the mysterious *l* does not add a body to the idea, what does
it add? It is, in its root-meaning, the same with idea. We seem to be
dealing

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

with an algebraical expression. Ideal is idea to the second power. We
might as well write it *idea*<sup>2</sup>.

The knot remains unpicked. For this powerful idea seems very much like
an idol of the mind. The writer who has given the word most currency in
English is Carlyle, and he uses it in very much that sense. He speaks of
"low ideals" as well as "high ideals," and of the "ideal of brute
strength" as a bad ideal. If there be bad ideals as well as good ideals,
a work of an idealist tendency may easily be harmful, instead of
beneficial, to mankind. The value of an ideal to mankind must depend on
something else besides its power. Even if it should be argued that this
bequest is meant for works of a fanatical tendency, yet it will not be
argued that it is for all such works, including the fanaticism of the
Dominican, and including the fanaticism of the Thug. Thus far the
science of shells has brought us.

It is time to check Philology by Lexicography.
