"*...unhappily scientology is as often mistaken for science as theology
is for worship*."--The New Word, [p. 149](tnw11.htm#page_149)

The term *Scientology* was apparently first coined in this book by Allen
Upward (1863-1926), written in 1901, five decades before L. Ron Hubbard
founded the belief system of the same name. It appears four times as a
noun and once as an adjective (on [p. 119](tnw09.htm#page_119), [p.
139](tnw10.htm#page_139), [p. 149](tnw11.htm#page_149) and [p.
156](tnw12.htm#page_156)).

Some opponents of Scientology have implied that this indicates that
Hubbard plagiarized the word. However, I'm not aware of any evidence
that Hubbard knew of this fairly obscure book. And the philosophy which
Upward expounds in *The New Word* has nothing to do with any of the
ideas of the latter-day Scientologists, as far as I can tell.

In fact, Upward uses it here as a disparaging term, to indicate a blind,
unthinking acceptance of scientific doctrine. Nor is the 'New Word' of
the title *Scientology*. Rather, the word here is *Idealist*, drawn from
Alfred Nobels' will, the starting point for Upward's essay, and as
Upward shows, a difficult concept to pin down.

Upward, who here claims to be a philologist, is critical of Latin and
Greek neologisms, while not hesitating to invent some new words of his
own besides 'Scientology': 'verihood,' 'katasynthetic,' 'interplode.' He
uses a children's book about science to deconstruct some of the vaguer
scientific concepts of the day, particularly the behavior of gas
molecules and the all-pervading ether. Ironically, an obscure Swiss
patent clerk named Einstein demolished these parts of 19th century
physics in 1906, shortly before this book finally saw print, making
Upward's critique a bit moot.

Intensely critical of everything and often uproariously funny, Upward's
book is enjoyable reading in its own right, even if it is not exactly
the Nobel prize material which he hoped for. He was apparently as
obsessed with the Nobel prize as this book intimates. As a tragic
footnote, Upward shot himself in November, 1926, upon learning that
George Bernard Shaw had won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Production notes: The New Word was originally written in 1901, and first
published in 1908 in London. The copytext used to create this etext was
a 1910 American reprint, which has a short postscript. Otherwise it is
presumably identical to the first edition. This book is long out of
print and difficult to find used. The copytext was obtained by
interlibrary loan from Santa Clara University, and is autographed by
Upward on the front end papers.
