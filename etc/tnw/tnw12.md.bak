### ELEVENTH HEAD

### THE CONJURING TRICK

*The Idealist Lexicon*.—1. *The Conjurer of Alexandria*.—2. *Pure
Assurance*.—3. *The Child's Riddle*.—4. *The Enchanted Castle*.—5. *A
work of an Idealist Tendency*.

DESCARTES likened his search for some one certain truth on which to
build, to the demand of Archimedes for a fulcrum on which to swing the
earth. I seek to tell what manner of book is worth a bag of gold, and
what I need is one firm word that will not change into some other word,
and slide and glide away.

We have now dealt with the Idealism that looks within, and the
Materialism that looks without, itself. In both cases our quarrel was in
words; but whereas Idealism was all words, we quarrelled with it
altogether; and whereas Materialism was a mixture of facts and words, we
had no quarrel with its facts. We distinguished between science and
scientology.

Such differential treatment accords with the spirit of the Will we are
construing, in which there are three bequests to science. If the
Testator's idealism be opposed to materialism, it cannot be the
materialism of the laboratory, and must be the materialism of the
lexicon.

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

Where does that opposition begin?

The last word of Materialism is not Matter, but Power. We have seen that
in many ways. We have seen the demon in the falling stone, and the man
in the going crumb. We have seen it still more clearly in the dissected
atom, which proved to be all demon, and no crumb. The abiding mystery in
the material universe is strength. Strength is, not the last word, but,
verily speaking, the first word, in the scientific lexicon. It is the
word which science has not explained, but by which she explains all
other words.

What is the first word in the idealist lexicon? What is the word that
denies Strength?

II

"A point is that which hath no parts, and no magnitude."

With these words began a book which was put into my hands, of course
without the slightest warning of what it was about, when I was twelve
years old. I need not remind any one that, like the Latin Grammar, it
was a Mediterranean book, written in Mediterranean words which I only
half understood.

The Romans did not write the book, any more than they wrote the Latin
Grammar or the Catholic Creed. In school they were themselves Babus.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dogma streamed on
Europe for two thousand years from the great lighthouse of Alexandria.

The Greeks themselves did not write the dogma; their share in it was the
editing. They were vikings who ransacked the temples of buried cities
and forgotten realms, and brought forth the hoards of knowledge into the
marketplace. They were publishers, and Alexandria was their chief
publishing house. Euclid himself was no famous geometrician, but an
immortal editor. This book of his is like a hard, bright crystal
imbedded in the human brain.

To me it came as literature, and I can still recall the pleasure with
which I read the opening pages. I thought the ancient Alexandrian the
ablest writer I had ever met with, the one who knew most surely what he
wanted to say, and said it in the surest words. Those axioms, I
remember, struck me as marvels of verihood; I was not awake to see that
they had told me nothing but that *more* is more than *less*, and *less*
is less than *more*.

I read on till I came to the place where the old conjurer, in order to
show that two three-cornered figures are a pair, makes-believe to pick
up one and set it down upon the other. When I saw that slice of pure
flatness rise through the air before my eyes, as though it were an
aeroplane, and settle down upon another slice, my mind, young as it was,
boggled at the sight. The African wizard with his magic spell had cast
me into a dream, and in my dream he had taken me by the sleeve and led
me into a

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

flat world, a world in which there was neither height nor depth, neither
up nor down, neither top nor bottom; and now, hey presto! he had jerked
me out of the flat world back into the real world in which thin pieces
of paper can be picked up and set down on the top of other pieces. I was
surprised in the same way as Alice when she saw the cat in Wonderland go
away and leave its grin behind.—How long have we all dwelt in
Wonderland, and watched other Mediterranean wizards working their famous
spell that changes the cat without changing the grin?

And now I have to see whether this hard, bright crystal can be a fulcrum
for the mind; if in the lexicon of Pure Earth-Measure there is any word
by which I can measure the Testator's word. Was not "exact" one of the
explanations of "idealist?"

II

The word Mathematics seems to mean assurance, or making sure; and that
being so we can understand why Bacon called it the handmaid of the
sciences, and why Descartes wanted to make it the maid-of-all-work.

The race of men before the Stone-cutters made sure of things by smelling
them, a habit that still breathes in our word know. It was not till men
got knives that they could cut things open, and change

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

knowledge into science. In doing so, as well as in whole groups of
words, they showed their growing trust in the eye. This turning towards
the light has its bodily counterpart in the great brain-growth towards
the eyeballs, a growth wrought partly by the chemic power of light and
thus a real bridge between chemistry and wakefulness; a growth which has
helped to shape the human skull, and so made man a child of light.

But the eye only sees in two measurements; it can see length and
breadth, but thickness it cannot see. The sense of sight is but a
daughter of the sense of touch; the eye a magic finger reaching forth
into the abyss. Again, there are two sides to making sure, and one of
them is the thing that you make sure of. Sights come and go; the sun
himself is a mere season-ticket-holder of the sky; your moon changes
like a woman's temper; that big blue cave of stars is not half so steady
as one's own cave. Only the firm earth beneath your feet is fixed. You
measure that, you go by steps, and you know where you are. It did not
need the overflowing of the Nile, nor the Egyptian Delta, to make
Geometry the mother of mathematics.

Already, when the first land surveyor measured the length of the ground
by the length of his foot or stride, he showed himself more sure of one
length than the other. But lo! another man has stepped the same length
of ground, and made it longer. One foot is not the same as another foot.
It is time

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

to measure what you measured by, and make assurance doubly sure.

In the end some unknown Andrónikos arose, and said,—Let us forget there
was ever real ground, or a real foot, or a real pair of human, or of
compass, legs, and make believe that we are measuring Pure Ground with
Pure Measures. And he called his science, or his language, Pure
Assurance.

Now here is Idealism in its nakedness. I do not mean that it is the
idealism of our Testator. I do not claim this bequest for works of a
mathematical tendency. But as it was in the mind of Plato, so this is in
the general mind, the embryo of idealism, and therefore it cannot be
passed by.

III

The first word in Euclid's definition is point. He makes-believe to
begin with that. But he can only tell me what a point is by telling me
what it is not. Every definition is a not. An outline can only be gained
in battle. The simplest definition follows the yea and nay of
electricity, as in the case of truth and verihood.

Accordingly Euclid tells me that his point has no size. And in doing so
he shows that he expects to find size in my mind already—that I know all
about size. And thus in the order of the thoughts size comes before the
point. In the language of Pure

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Assurance, Euclid
has assumed the three dimensions of space in telling me that his point
has none. Which, as he would say himself, is absurd.—There is a good
deal of absurdity in Euclid.

His aim is to make-believe that he is starting with the point. And so
instead of working down to it fairly, he pretends to create it. It is
another conjuring trick. The juggler claps down his magical dice-box
over size, and when he lifts it up, hey presto! size has vanished, and
the point is there instead. In a school-book that is unfair. The
abstraction ought to be abstracted before the schoolboy's eyes, and not
popped on him from up the conjuror's sleeve, as if it were some real
thing made of imponderable Matter. Which, to translate Euclid, is
unheard of.

I have to fall back on my humble method of asking what the words mean. I
cannot find that point means anything more than end, one end of a line,
and so I must at least know what a line is. But line, in its turn, only
means edge, the edge of a face; and face is only side, the side of a
block. Thus the words themselves lead me back into the world of size, a
world of three measurements, the real world in which I am accustomed to
live. I can now, if I am asked to do so, make-believe to forget the
block and think only of the side; to forget that and think only of the
edge; to forget that and think only of the end,—as I can to forget the
end and think of nothing. And it is by such steps that this

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

venerable quack ought to have brought his flats and lines and points
before my mind's eye, when I was twelve years old.

We have not Euclid's handwriting before us, and we know that
Mediterranean copyists sometimes take freedoms with their text. One of
Euclid's copyists seems to have felt that there was something false
about the point, and he has tried to mend matters by saying that a point
is that which has position. I am reminded rather painfully of a certain
Energy of Position which gave us some trouble a short way back. To say
that a point has position is to say that it is fixed; and you cannot fix
a point without having at least one other point to fix it by: and as
soon as you have got two points side by side you have got a line. And so
we work back by another road to the real starting-point, the point from
which the science of fanciful Earth-Measure did indeed start, namely the
solid earth.

Euclid has put the cart before the horse. Which is unheard of.

I am not ashamed to say that I have found more sense in a child's riddle
than in all Euclid's definitions—though they are also in their way a
child's riddle. It runs,—How many sides has a round plum-pudding? And
the answer is—two, an outside and an inside.

Because the science of Earth-Measure is the science of measuring shapes,
and the child's plum-pudding is the truth about shape. It is the shape
of the

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> All-Thing as well
as of the atom. It is, if I must wield these enchanted weapons, the
shape of space itself—the mind-shape. The child's plum-pudding brings
before us the unreality of all the flats that Euclid deals in, showing
us that there is no halfway house between nothing and the whole ball. I
am reminded of another famous dogma in which the thundering adjectives
roll to and fro, from One to Three, and back from Three to One. All
unawares, perhaps, the mind that gave birth to that mighty inspiration
was reasoning from One Space in Three Measures to One God in Three
Persons. If it be not the creed of Athanasius it is the creed of
Alexandria.

Perhaps the minds for whom the word One is the truest word in speech,
whether they write it Monotheism or Monism, are shallower than they
think they are.

IV

Those flats of Euclid's are eye shapes, and their power over the mind is
owing, not wholly to the early man's belief in a flat earth, but in some
measure to that enlargement of the eye nerves which makes our brain, as
it were, lopsided. We like to think in flats; our explanation is a map.
And since the world is round, the map is false, and what we gain in
clearness we lose in verihood.

Here we are at the heart of this two-thousand-year-old falsehood, these
lengths without breadths,

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

these flats without thickness, this whole denial, not merely of
strength, but of reality. The science of Pure Earthmeasure is the
science of Tidy Shapes. Whereas we know that real shapes are always ever
so little untidy; the ball is not quite round, the face is not quite
flat, the line is not quite straight, the point is not so fine as
nothing, and it is not quite fixed. As soon as Pure Assurance undertakes
to assure us of anything beyond its own purity, lo! the triangle is no
longer equilateral, and the parallel lines run together, and we have to
fall back upon the landsurveyor's chain, and use compasses of wood and
brass. Alas! is even the purity of Pure Assurance free from scandal? Do
we not hear of negligible quantities being brushed aside, as Pure
Physics brushes its scandals into the Ether? Is not the enchanted castle
of Pure Earthmeasure haunted by a restless spirit that even the wizards
cannot exorcise, a ghostly circle that will not be squared?

V

The study of Unreal measure has been called for ages a training for the
mind; as though the mind were some poor sickly plant that could not grow
upwards unless it were nailed to a dead stick. The healthy plant grows
upward in search of light, because the light draws it upward, and
because it needs and feeds on light. Pity for those that cannot bear the
light, that creep and cling to their dead stick,

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

and put forth their puny blossoms in the shade. Yet greater pity for
those that pine and are denied the light, that climb and are forbidden,
that bud and may not flower,—for the sound crucified to save the sick.

For my part, when I stand outside the Roman forcing-house, and see the
gardeners inside training the plants entrusted to their care; driving
their nails, and turning on their Alexandrian gas-jets, and shutting out
the day, I watch them with other feelings than reverence. I see the
tired heads droop in the foul air; and I want to break open the door of
the forcing-house, and draw forth the nails, and turn out the gas-jets,
and let in the light of heaven.

Once when I was in Delft I visited the house where William the Silent
was murdered by order of the Catholic King. And looking out of a window
into the courtyard I saw some flowers in pots standing in a corner over
which the shadow of the wall had crept. And while I looked a girl came
out into the courtyard, and took up the flowers, one after the other,
and moved them out of the shadow into the sunshine again. Then I said to
myself,—Lo! here I have seen the work of William the Silent: he saw the
black shadow of Spain creep over his country, and he brought his
countrymen out into the light of freedom again.

To me, while I looked, this also seemed to be a work of an idealist
tendency.
