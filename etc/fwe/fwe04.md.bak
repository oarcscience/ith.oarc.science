# 2 FESTIVALS OF DENMARK

NYTARSDAG (New Year's Day) January 1

    In towns and cities throughout Denmark the New Year marks the
beginning of one of the most important social events in the calendar.
Men and women attend church services and later call on relatives and
friends to wish them a Happy New Year. The conventional call lasts for
about a half hour and the customary refreshments consist of wine and
small cookies. The exchange of visits is carried on for about a
fortnight.

HELLIG-TRE-KONGERS-DAG (Day of the Three Holy Kings) January 6

    Hellig-Tre-Kongers-Dag, the twelfth day after Christmas, brings the
festive season to an official end. The Christmas tree is dismantled, all
greens are taken from the house and the Christmas ornaments packed away
for another year.

    This is the night when young girls traditionally play fortunetelling
games. One time-honored method for a girl to decide her fate is to walk
backward, throw a shoe over her left shoulder and pray the Holy Kings to
reveal the future. The man who subsequently appears in her dreams will
be her future husband.

FJORTENDE FEBRUAR (Fourteenth of February) February 14

    On this day school children exchange friendship tokens, which
consist of pressed snowdrops accompanied by original verses. The sender
signs the gaekkebrev, or joking letter, with a series of dots--one dot
standing for each letter in the name. When the boy who receives the
gaekkebrev guesses the sender's name correctly, the girl is expected to
reward him at Easter with a chocolate or sugar egg. If, on the contrary,
the boy fails to decipher the name, he is expected to pay the forfeit.

FASTELAVN (Shrovetide) The Monday preceding Ash Wednesday

    Fastelavn, the Monday preceding Ash Wednesday, is a general school
holiday and one of the gayest times of year for boys and girls.
Everybody celebrates the day by eating Fastelavnsboller, or Shrovetide
buns, which are as important in youthful games and customs as in festive
adult menus.

    In some places children armed with "Lenten birches," or branches
decorated with brightly colored paper flowers, rise at four or five in
the morning, enter the rooms of parents or grandparents and waken them
by beating the bedclothes with their switches. "Give buns, give buns,
give buns," the children shout, meanwhile inflicting resounding smacks
with their branches. From the mysterious depths of the covers the
"sleeping" grown-ups always produce the traditional Fastelavnsboller
(and sometimes even candy), with which the youthful tormentors
customarily are rewarded. Possibly this custom survives from ancient
times when the "Easter smacks," delivered in many lands at this season,
were regarded as part of an early spring purification rite.

    In both town and rural communities older children dress up in fancy
costumes and fantastic masks and make neighborhood rounds, singing for
buns and rattling collection boxes:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Buns up, buns down,  
Buns for me to chew!  
If no buns you give  
I'll rattle till you do!

</div>

chant the youngsters, jingling the boxes in which they collect coins for
a Fastelavn feast.

    At this season there are many parties at which children play
different kinds of bun games. A favorite stunt is to suspend a bun from
the chandelier by a string. Everybody takes turns at trying to get a
bite of the tempting morsel when the string is set in motion. The one
who succeeds gets the bun as prize.

    An old Danish Shrovetide game which adults play extensively even in
modern times, is called Sla Katten al Tonden, or "knocking the cat out
of the barrel." Often an artificial cat (originally a live one) is
enclosed in a suspended wooden barrel--decorated with paper flowers,
painted with cat pictures. Each player, armed with a wooden stick, takes
a mighty swing at the barrel. The one succeeding in smashing it is
proclaimed "Cat King" and receives a prize.

    In some Danish seaport towns the Fastelavn boat is a feature of the
season's festivities. A great boat manned by twelve seamen is placed on
a truck drawn by several horses and paraded through the streets. Horn
players sit beside the driver. A seaman carrying the national flag
announces the approach of the truck, which is followed by members of the
Seamen's Guild.

    The unique procession halts frequently during its progress through
the town. "The ship is coming! The ship is coming!" shout the townsfolk.
The musicians play and the men dance. Contributions are collected for
sick and needy seamen.

PASKE (Easter)

    After the Easter morning services the day is spent quietly at home.
For children Easter means eggs to eat and eggs for games. In South
Jutland boys and girls rise early and hunt in the garden for "hare's
nests." When found, the children shriek with joy since the hares have a
way of leaving not only dyed hens' eggs but eggs of chocolate and sugar
which sometimes are decorated with delectable pink and yellow frosting
roses. In some places children have contests with dyed eggs, which they
roll down hill. The boy or girl whose egg goes the longest distance
without breaking wins his opponent's egg and retains his own.

ANDEN PASKEDAG (Second Easter Day) The day after Easter

    This is a general holiday. Stores are closed and in the cities all
places of amusemetit, such as theatres, concert halls, clubs and
restaurants, are crowded to capacity.

VALBORGSAFTEN (Walpurgis Eve) April 30

    In Jutland, bonfires are built on the hilltops on Walpurgis Eve, for
this is the time when superstitious folk say witches and demons ride
broomsticks through the air to hold rendezvous with the Devil at the
Brocken, in the Harz. According to old belief, the lighted fires prevent
the evil spirits from stopping on their way and harming man and beast.
Be this as it may, the bonfires make a happy excuse for merrymaking on
May Day Eve. Old and young dance and sing about the fires which,
incidentally, serve to dispose of a great deal of useless trash
accumulated during the winter months.

    Customs vary from parish to parish. In most places, Saint John's or
Midsummer, rather than Watpurgis Eve, is the traditional time for
building bonfires.

STORE BEDEDAG (Great Prayer Day) The fourth Friday after Easter

    This day of prayer dates back to the time of Christian VII, when his
worldly Prime Minister, Count Johann Friedrich von Struensee, decided
upon one great day of prayer as a substitute for the many holy days
which the Church observed.

    Bells in every church announce the eve of Store Bededag. In olden
days it was customary for Copenhagen burghers to greet the spring by
putting on new clothes and strolling along the city ramparts. Then they
went home and ate varme hveder, a kind of small square wheat bread,
served piping hot. Today people still eat the traditional bread. They
still dress in spring finery but, instead of walking along the ramparts,
they promenade on the famous Langelinie, or boulevard which faces
Copenhagen's water front.

    On Store Bededag stores and places of business are closed and
special church services held.

PINSE (Pentecost, or Whitsun) The fiftieth day after Easter

    Pentecost or Whitsun is the great spring holiday. For weeks
beforehand housewives are scrubbing, scouring and putting everything to
rights. Tailors are busy, too, because Whitsun is the traditional time
for new summer clothes. Since beech trees are beginning to bud at this
season many Copenhagen residents go by bicycle to woods and forests and
gather armfuls of tender young branches. These boughs are used to
decorate the houses--in symbol of welcome to early spring.

    According to an old folk saying, "the sun dances on Pinse morning."
Townsfolk, as well as country people rise at dawn to witness this
miracle. In Copenhagen it is customary to get up early and go to
Frederiksberg hill to watch the sun rise and "see it dance." According
to custom, coffee, which is served in the garden, must be on the table
by six o'clock, although the sun is up long before that hour.

    Anden Pinsedag, or Whit Monday, is a general holiday. People make
excursions to the woods for picnics or go to rural restaurants for an
outdoor party and a good country meal, followed by dancing and singing.
Indeed, singing is an important feature of most celebrations, as this is
the day when singing society members, accompanied by wives and children,
make all kinds of rural expeditions.

SANKT HANS AFTEN (Saint John's Eve) June 23

    Midsummer Eve--the longest night in the year--is universally
celebrated with merrymaking, rejoicing and building enormous fires on
the hills. Folk dancing, speeches and singing make this night a
memorable occasion for young and old.

    Often bonfires are topped by old tar barrels or other inflammable
materials. Sometimes, also, the effigy of a witch (doubtless a pagan
symbol of Winter or Death) crowns the immense pile of wood and rubbish.
As flames mount, lighting the sky for miles about, the pre-Christian
drama of the conquest of darkness by light is unconsciously reenacted;
for on Midsummer Day the sun reaches its highest point in the heavens.

    In coast hamlets blazing fires are made along the shore, and people
going out in boats to view the bonfires sing romantic songs in honor of
the beautiful summer night.

MORTENSAFTEN (Saint Martin's Eve) November 10

    Saint Martin's Eve, coming at the season when crops are gathered and
geese are fat, is celebrated in the homes with a family dinner. Harvest
foods and roast goose, traditional to the occasion, are eaten in many
homes.

    As one informant explained, "Legend says Saint Martin was hiding in
a barn when a stupid goose gave his presence away by quacking. That's
why the bird lost his neck and we eat him on Mortensaften!"

JULEAFTEN (Christmas Eve) December 24

    Christmas, the season of good will and rejoicing, is the greatest
holiday in the Danish calendar. For weeks in advance farmers' wives turn
their houses upside down in a frenzy of floor scrubbing, brass
polishing, laying in huge supplies and baking dozens of traditional
cakes, cookies and fancy breads. On "Little Christmas Eve," December 23,
it is customary in many places to make enough apple fritters to last
over the next three days.

    Farmers are busy, too, since they must tidy up everything outdoors
as well as in the barns and stables. Horses, cows and sheep all receive
extra food and care for, according to ancient folk belief, the manger
animals stand at midnight in honor of Jesus' birth. A sheaf of grain,
tied to a pole and erected in the garden, provides holiday fare for the
wild birds. Even city apartment dwellers do not forget to tie bunches of
grain to the balconies at this season.

    In couutry places the farmer traditionally makes the sign of the
cross over ploughs and harrows and places them under cover. Should the
"Shoemaker of Jerusalem" or, as some say, the Wandering Jew, find any
unblessed or uncovered implements lying about, he would sit down and
rest, thus bringing bad luck to the farmer.

    The explanition of this Superstition is found in an old Danish
legend which says that Jesus, when carrying his heavy cross to Calvary
paused to rest at a shoemaker's door. "Go on faster, go on faster!"
ordered the shoemaker, pointing to the road. "I shall go on," replied
Jesus looking at the man, "but thou, thou shalt wander until I return."

    Folk say that for more than twenty centuries now the Shoemaker of
Jerusalem has wandered across Denmark's icy fields on Christmas Eve,
searching in vain for an unblessed plough. Should he succeed in finding
one he could stop and rest, his wanderings over forever; for then,
according to peasant tradition, the shoemaker's curse would be
transferred to the godless farmer.

    Thus far no Danish farmer has forgotten to bless his plough, nor has
he left it carelessly lying about. But on Christmas Eve as the church
bells strike twelve, people say they can hear the Wandering Jew wailing
across the heath before he disappears for another twelve months.

    At four or five on Christmas Eve the village bells start ringing
joyously and everyone goes to church. Later people return home to feast
and make merry within the family circle. Houses are gaily ornamented
with red and white candles, the Dannebrog, or Danish flag (with its
white cross on a red background) and, of course, the Christmas tree--a
young spruce with evergreen needles, the symbol of everlasting life. The
tree is always a beautiful sight with its decorations of red and white
wax papers, fancy cookies, stilning stars and little colored bags of
sweets. In addition, there are plenty of small Danish flags, bright
tinsel and delightful homemade ornaments.

    Christmas Eve Supper, usually served at six o'clock, is the high
point of the holiday. Traditionally the meal starts with risengrod, or
rice porridge, which has cinnamon on top and a big butter "eye" in the
center. The exciting feature of the risengrod is thee whole almond
inside. Whoever finds this coveted morsel in his portion receives a
prize, such as a marzipan fruit, or some other trifle. Of course, the
merriment and suspense are increased when the finder does not disclose
his luck until everyone else has consumed his last grain of rice.

    The rice pudding is followed by a wonderful array of foods, chief of
which is the roast goose, adorned with small Danish flags and stuffed
with apples and prunes. Browned potatoes, red cabbage and currant jelly
accompany the bird, while rich apple cake, fruits and nuts follow for
dessert.

    After dinner and a hearty "Tak for mad," "Thanks for the meal" to
the head of the family, old and young go to the adjoining room, join
hands, and dance about the Christmas tree.

    "It's Christmas again, Christmas again," sing the merry dancers,
"And Christmas lasts till Easter!" Then follows the rueful refrain, "It
isn't true! It isn't true! Lent comes in between!"

    Christmas carols follow. At last it is present time. Often the
youngest child hands out the gifts, which are piled beneath the tree.
After all gifts have been opened, admired and enjoyed, there are games
played for spice-cake forfeits. Before bedtime there is more
food--coffee, sandwiches and many different kinds of sweets.

     In olden times people always remembered the Jule-Nisse at
Christmas. He was the gnome said to dwell in attic or barn. He looked
after the household's welfare and was responsible for its good--or bad
luck. The Jule Nisse always received a generous portion of risengrod,
with an added helping of butter. Nowadays, alas, nobody seems to see
Jule-Nisse. He lives on, nevertheless, in all true Danish hearts, and
the brave little red-capped, grey-bearded gnome is always well
represented in Christmas cards and holiday decorations.

JULEDAG (Christmas) December 25

    Christmas is spent quietly in the homes. All day, following morning
church services, relatives and friends drop in to exchange greetings and
good wishes.

    Throughout the holiday season hospitality is offered--and
accepted--in every household. According to an old superstition, whoever
enters a house at Yuletide without partaking of the family's cheer will
"carry away the Christmas."

    Anden Juledag, Second Christmas Day, which follows Christmas is
often celebrated by country dances at the village hall, a community
Christmas tree gathering or, in towns and cities, by attendance at
theatres and concerts.

NYTARSAFTEN (New Year's Eve) December 31

    Instead of "blowing in the New Year," as was customary in the past,
young people now "smash it in" by bombarding people's doors, or "let it
in" by setting off fireworks. Once these noisy demonstrations were
intended to frighten away powers of darkness; now noise making is just
part of the New Year's Eve fun.

    For months ahead boys save up worthless earthenware. On New Year's
Eve they break it against the house doors of friends and neighbors. The
most popular man in the town or village is he who has the greatest
number of old pots and bowls smashed against his door.

    According to traditional etiquette, the master of the house rushes
out and tries to catch his noisy guests, who run away after the attack.
They do not run too quickly, however, because those who are caught are
treated with cakes, cookies or doughnuts. The young people who explode
fireworks outside the door are similarly welcomed and offered holiday
cheer.

    In many parts of West Jutland the last night of the year is
considered the time for all sorts of pranks and practical jokes, The
farmer does well, therefore, to put everything under cover and bolt the
barn door; otherwise, cart wheels may mysteriously find their way to the
well and pitchforks to the rafters!

    Just at midnight church bells peal out the passing of the year. In
towns and cities bands of gay masqueraders swarm through the streets.
Banquets, dances, dinners and gala parties are features of the evening's
entertainment. In homes throughout the land the traditional supper
includes holiday boiled cod and mustard sauce, with aquavit to drink.
The Christmas candles are lighted again. Laughter and merriment flow as
freely as aquavit for the final night of the year is a time for
relaxation and fun.
