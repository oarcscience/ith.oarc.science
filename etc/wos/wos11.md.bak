### CHAPTER VIII.

### SUMMARY.

I. IN the preceding pages we have traced THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT from
*Babylonia*, east and west, through *Persia*, *Hindûstan*, *China*,
*Mexico*, *Britain*, *Scandinavia*, *Italy*, *Illyricum*, *Thrace*,
*Greece*, *Asia Minor*, and *Phœnicia*. Again, we have observed the same
idolatry prevailing north and south, through *Scythia* on the one hand,
and *Africa* on the other. THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT WAS, THEREFORE,
UNIVERSAL. For not only did the sacred serpent enter into the symbolical
and ritual service of every religion which recognised THE SUN; but we
even find him in countries where solar worship was altogether
unknown--as in *Sarmatia*, *Scandinavia*, and the *Gold Coast of* 

<span id="page_442">p. 442</span>

*Africa*. In every known country of the ancient world the serpent formed
a prominent feature in the ordinary worship, and made no inconsiderable
figure in their Hagiographa, entering alike into legendary and
astronomical mythology.

Whence, then, did this ONLY-UNIVERSAL IDOLATRY originate? That it
*preceded* POLYTHEISM, is indicated by the attribution of the title OPS,
and the consecration of the symbolical serpent to so many of the heathen
deities. The title Ors was conferred upon Terra, Vesta, Rhea, Cybele,
Juno, Diana--and even Vulcan is called by Cicero, *Opas* <span
id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_560.md).

In Grecian mythology, the symbolical serpent was sacred to Saturn,
Jupiter, Apollo, Bacchus, Mars, Æsculapius, Rhea, Juno, Minerva, Diana,
Ceres, and Proserpine--that is, the serpent was a sacred emblem of
*nearly all the gods and goddesses* <span
id="fr_562"></span>[2](#fn_561.md).

The same remark may be extended to the Theogonies of Egypt, Hindûstan,
and Mexico--in all of which we find the serpent emblematic, not of *one*
deity, but of *many*.

<span id="page_443">p. 443</span>

What then, is the inference?--*That the serpent was the most ancient of
the heathen gods*; and that as his attributes were multiplied by
superstitious devotion, new names were invented to represent the new
personifications which, in the progress of time, dividing the unity,
destroyed the integrity of the original worship. Yet each of these
schismatic superstitions bore some faint trace of its dracontic origin,
in retaining the symbolical serpent. Some of these deifications may be
easily traced, though others are obscure and difficult.

The mystic serpent entered into the mythology of every nation;
consecrated almost every temple; symbolized almost every deity; was
imagined in the heavens, stamped upon the earth, and ruled in the realms
of everlasting sorrow. His *subtilty* raised him into an emblem of
*wisdom*; he was therefore pictured upon the aegis of Minerva, and
crowned her helmet. *The knowledge of futurity* which he displayed in
Paradise exalted him into a symbol of vaticination; he was therefore
*oracular*, and reigned at Delphi. The "*opening of the eyes*" of our
deluded first parents obtained him an altar in the temple of the god of
*healing*; he is therefore the constant

<span id="page_444">p. 444</span>

companion of Æsculapius. In the distribution of his qualities the genius
of mythology did not even gloss over his malignant attributes. The
fascination with which he intoxicated the souls of the first sinners,
depriving them at once of purity and immortality, of the image of God
and of the life of angels, was symbolically remembered and fatally
celebrated in the orgies of Bacchus, where *serpents* crowned the heads
of the Bacchantes, and the "Poculum Boni Dæmonis" circulated under the
auspices of the Ophite hierogram chased upon its rim <span
id="fr_563"></span>[1](#fn_562.md). But the most remarkable remembrance of
the power of the paradisiacal serpent is displayed in the position which
he retains in Tartarus. A *cunodracontic* Cerberus guards the gates;
*serpents* are coiled upon the chariot wheels of Proserpine; *serpents*
pave the abyss of torment; and even *serpents* constitute the caduceus
of Mercury, the talisman which he holds when he conveys the soul to
Tartarus. The image of the *serpent* is stamped upon every mythological
fable connected with the realms of Pluto. Is it not then *probable*,
that in the universal symbol of heathen

<span id="page_445">p. 445</span>

idolatry we recognize the universal object of primitive worship--THE
SERPENT OF PARADISE.

But this inference depends not on mere *symbolical worship*: for we
trace the sacred serpent, by the lamp of tradition, through the waters
of the deluge to the world which they overwhelmed. In the mythological
systems of Hindûstan and Egypt, we find him, as THE CAUSE of that awful
calamity, moving in the waters, and troubling the deep: and a
Brahminical legend indicates his existence even *before that
visitation*. In the channel of the river Ganges, in the province of
Bahar, is a remarkable rock, upon which is sculptured a figure of Veshnu
reposing upon a serpent. This serpent is fabled to have been the goddess
DEVI or ISI, who assumed the form to carry Veshnu over the deluge. The
sleep of Veshnu indicates the period between *the two worlds* <span
id="fr_564"></span>[1](#fn_563.md). May we not then infer that this legend
alludes to the existence of the sacred serpent in the world before the
flood? And further, is it not probable, since this sacred serpent is
confounded with ISI,

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (the Isis of Egypt--the Eve of Scripture <span
id="fr_565"></span>[1](#fn_564).md), that the tradition recognises THE
SERPENT OF PARADISE?

The only worship which can vie with that of the serpent in antiquity or
universality, is the adoration of the SUN. But uniformly with the
progress of the solar superstition, has advanced the sacred serpent from
Babylon to Peru. *If* the worship of THE SUN, there-fore, was the first
deviation from the truth; the worship of THE SERPENT was one of the
first innovations of *idolatry*. Whatever doubt may exist as to which
was the *first* error, little doubt can arise as to the *primitive* and
*antediluvian* character of *both*. For in the earliest heathen records
we find them inexplicably interwoven as the first of superstitions. Thus
Egyptian mythology informs us, that HELIUS (*the sun*) was the first of
the Egyptian gods; for in early history, kings and gods are generally
confounded. But Helius married OPS, *the serpent deity!* and became
father of Osiris, Isis, Typhon, Apollo, and Venus <span
id="fr_566"></span>[2](#fn_565.md): a tradition

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

which would make the superstitions coeval. This fable being reduced to
more simple terms, informs us, that the SUN, having married the SERPENT,
became, by this union, the father of *Adam and Eve*, THE EVIL SPIRIT,
*the serpent-solar deity*, and LUST; which appears to be a confusion of
scriptural truths, in which chronological order is sacrificed from the
simplification of a fable. But--*ex pede Herculem*--from the small
fragments of the truth which are here combined, we may judge of the
original dimensions of the knowledge whose ruins are thus heaped
together. We may conclude, that since *idolatry*, *lust*, *the serpent*,
and *the evil spirit*, are here said to have been synchronous with THE
FIRST MAN *and* WOMAN, the whole fable is little more than a
mythological version of the events in Paradise.

*The first sinners* and *the first sin* are well placed in the same
family with the author of all evil: and as, through the serpent, *he*
was introduced into Paradise; and through the serpent, *they* died, from
righteousness, and were born anew in sin,--THE SERPENT may well be
allegorically represented as the parent of each.

<span id="page_448">p. 448</span>

The reviver of Ophiolatreia, after the flood, must have been one of the
family of Noah; for so high can we trace its post-diluvian history.
Sanchoniathon tells us, that "SATURN, coming into the south country,
gave the whole of Egypt to THE GOD TAAUTUS for his kingdom <span
id="fr_567"></span>[1](#fn_566.md)."

Now Taautus was the inventor of post-diluvian Ophiolatreia <span
id="fr_568"></span>[2](#fn_567.md); and since Saturn was Noah, according to
every system for the interpretation of mythology, it is historically
certain that, during the lifetime of this patriarch, or shortly after
his death, THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT was revived in Egypt.

But not only in Egypt must we look for its early revival. We have traced
it in countries which never could have had intercourse with the kingdom
of Taautus, until the voyages of the Phœnicians, or the conquests of the
Romans, opened a passage for its mysteries. And then--*here*, in the
remotest regions of the earth--amidst the fastnesses of Wales and the
wilds of Wiltshire,--were found a people who adored the same god,
symbolized by the same serpent,

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

and propitiated with the same sacrifice--A HUMAN VICTIM! Who remembered
in their mythology the same primeval tradition of THE WOMAN PERSECUTED
BY THE MALIGNANT DRAGON; and blended with their fables such records of
the Fall of Man as could hardly have been devised by their own
invention, irrelative as they are to every other part of their idolatry.

Thus the veneration of the OAK (which did not conduce to any national
utility, as they never cut it down,) was totally unconnected with their
theological system, and must therefore have been handed down to them by
immemorial custom, the meaning of which had been lost in the darkness of
ages.

The same adoration of *trees*, in conjunction with serpent-worship,
prevailed in the still darker regions of Sarmatia, and among the
infinitely more degraded natives of the coast of Africa. And who can
have the hardihood to venture an assertion, that such a superstition was
the invention of one polished nation, and conveyed, by their commercial
or warlike enterprises, into countries cut off by trackless oceans or
immeasurable deserts? Who can assert, with any

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

hope of making good his hypothesis, that the Egyptian philosopher, or
Phœnician merchant, or Assyrian conqueror, instructed in the same
worship the grovelling Whidanese, the erratic Sarmatian, or the
inaccessible Briton?

The inland progress of the sacred serpent might have been conducted by
Chaldæan colonies into some of the neighbouring districts; but in ages
when the exploits of a single traveller furnished matter for fables as
numerous as they were marvellous, it is not at all likely that a
Chaldæan colony would penetrate on the one side beyond the Oural, or on
the other beyond the Himaleh mountains, in sufficient force to
revolutionize the religion of those regions. And yet in remote China,
and secluded Scandinavia, THE SAME SERPENT holds his dominion in the
sea, and his reign upon the land! But if to these distant dwellings of
the sacred dragon we add his immemorial habitation in Peru and Mexico,
the improbability that Ophiolatreia was a Chaldæan invention increases
with additional force: and if Chaldæa be deprived of the sceptre of
universal proselytism, where is the nation that can contend for the
distinction?

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

With respect to the introduction of Ophiolatreia into Britain, it is
historically certain that the Phœnicians were the only people of
antiquity who pushed their adventurous barques into these remote
latitudes: and although in some particulars the languages and religions
coincide, yet we cannot imagine that such a priesthood as THE DRUIDS
could have sprung from the slow and solitary vessels which, creeping
along the coasts of Africa and Gaul, discharged their ballast upon the
desert Cassiterides; and, unconscious of any object but that of
accumulating wealth, returned home with the tin ore of those valuable
islands. That accidental circumstances, in the lapse of ages, introduced
many innovations into the religion of the West, we can readily believe:
but to recognize in the Druids, the magi of Chaldea, the philosophers of
Egypt, or the Brahmins of Hindûstan, (except inasmuch as they are all
probably descended from the original idolatrous priesthood dispersed at
Babel,) is a refinement of conjecture which requires more substantial
proofs than have hitherto been advanced. Identity of remote origin will
satisfactorily account for identity of opinions in countries so
separated by land and

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

sea, without supposing any subsequent intercourse by colonies or
navigation.

It appears, then, that no nations were so geographically remote, or so
religiously discordant, but that one--and ONLY ONE <span
id="fr_569"></span>[1](#fn_568.md)--superstitious characteristic was common
to all: that the most civilized and the most barbarous bowed down with
the same devotion to the same engrossing deity; and that this deity
either *was*, or was *represented by*, the same SACRED SERPENT.

It appears also that in most, if not all, the civilized countries where
this serpent was worshipped, some fable or tradition which involved his
history, directly or indirectly, alluded to THE FALL OF MAN in Paradise,
in which THE SERPENT was concerned.

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

What follows, then, but that *the most ancient account* respecting the
cause and nature of this seduction must be the one from which all the
rest are derived which represent the victorious serpent,--victorious
over man in a state of innocence, and subduing his soul in a state of
sin, into the most abject veneration and adoration of himself.

This account we have in the writings of MOSES,--confessedly the most
ancient historical records which exist in the world. The writings of
MOSES, therefore, contain the true history; and the serpent of Paradise
is the prototype of the serpent of all the superstitions. From his
"*subtilty*" arose the adoption of the serpent as an emblem of
"*wisdom*;" from his *revealing* the hidden virtue of the forbidden
fruit, the use of the same reptile in *divination*; from his
conversation with Eve, the notion that the serpent was *oracular*: and,
after this, the transition from a SYMBOL, a TALISMAN, and an ORACLE, to
a GOD, was rapid and imperceptible, and would naturally have taken place
even had there been no tradition of the celestial origin of the fallen
spirit, who became the serpent-tempter.

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

II\. In reviewing the hopes and traditions of the Gentiles, we find that
they not only preserved in their mythological writings a memorial of THE
FALL, but also a strong vestige of the promise of REDEMPTION. The
"*bruising of the serpent*" was equally known in the mythologies of
Egypt, Hindûstan, Greece, Persia, Scandinavia, and Mexico. In each of
these we recognize a TRIUMPHANT GOD, and a VANQUISHED SERPENT. Neither
can this, any more than the remembrance of the fall, be a casual
coincidence. There is nothing in the belief which would *naturally*
suggest itself to the imaginations of people so remote and so
unconnected. In respect of this expectation, therefore, we may similarly
conclude, that where so many independent traditions coincide, the most
ancient must be the one from which all the rest were originally derived.
This will again bring us to the Promise of Redemption, in the curse upon
the serpent, as revealed to Adam. But it will do more:--it will teach us
IN WHAT LIGHT the first of men who fell, and to whom first it was
announced that "*the wages of sin is* DEATH," looked forward to "the
gift of God, which is ETERNAL LIFE, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST,

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

\[paragraph continues\] OUR LORD." It will teach us that neither Adam,
any more than ourselves, "looked for transitory promises;" that the
REDEMPTION, which was the object of his ardent faith, was not
*temporal*, but SPIRITUAL; that the agent of that redemption, in his
heaven-directed eye, was not *a mere man*, heir of his infirmities, his
sins, and his mortality, but "GOD MANIFEST IN THE FLESH;" and that,
*through the sufferings* of this JUST ONE, in his conflict with the evil
spirit, he expected to "*bruise the serpent's head*."

That such was the faith of Adam, *the faith of all the world declares*.
For what was this faith in respect of THE VANQUISHED SERPENT, and the
TRIUMPHANT GOD?--APOLLO slays *Python*; HERCULES, *the Hesperian
dragon*; CRISHNA, *the king of the Nagas*; and THOR, "*the serpent which
is cast into the sea*," But Apollo for his victory is doomed "*to depart
from the world* <span id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_569.md);" Hercules and
Crishna are *bitten by the serpent*; the former in the HEEL! while Thor
gains the victory *only with his life*. Yet Apollo, Hercules, Crishna,
and Thor, are all INCARNATE DEITIES!

If, therefore, the legends which represent their triumphs be derived
from the promise of

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Redemption in Paradise, the idea of their
INCARNATION must have been derived from the same source. It is evident,
therefore, that Adam, or (which is the same thing) Noah, must have
considered the promise to imply a Redemption, which would be wrought by
the sufferings of "GOD MANIFEST IN THE FLESH."

That Adam "did not look for transitory promises," is further evident
from the condition in which he was left by the Fall; which, if not
alleviated by some abiding hope, must have accelerated his death by
accumulated miseries.

To the serpent God said, "*I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
shalt bruise his heel* <span id="fr_571"></span>[1](#fn_570.md)." Darkly as
this promise may have conveyed the hope, that a hope of redemption *was*
effectually conveyed by it, we have every reason to believe, from the
mere fact that "*the days of Adam were nine hundred and thirty years,
and he died* <span id="fr_572"></span>[2](#fn_571.md)." He died at an age
to which he could not, humanly calculating, have arrived, had his life
been so wretched as the fall from innocence and the curse of God would
have made it, had that fall been irrecoverable, and

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

that curse irremovable. For when we consider that through this
protracted period, he sustained the trials of an "accursed" soil, of
children given but to be taken away, of an anxious mind and an afflicted
body,--anxiety and affliction being the necessary result of his lapse
from innocence; when we consider that his memory, however impaired, was
not destroyed, but could carry back his mind to a period of happiness
now no longer existing; and that his body, however fresh, and beautiful,
and vigorous, must one day "return to the earth as it was;"--we must be
assured that he had SOMETHING, *beyond his present hopes*, to comfort
and support him in his pilgrimage upon earth; that he had some
well-grounded and abiding faith in another existence, more suitable to
the energies, and more consoling to the necessities of the soul. The
only comfort which revelation has announced for his support, is the
promise contained in *the curse upon the serpent*; and as it would be
the extreme of absurdity to interpret this *literally*, we must look for
a figurative and spiritual interpretation. Such an interpretation has
been put upon it by Scripture; but we can arrive at the same conclusion
by independent arguments. And as such

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>

a line of reasoning is sometimes admitted by those who will "hear
neither Moses nor the prophets," neither Christ nor the evangelists, it
may not be irrelevant to the object of the present treatise, as we began
with "observations on THE FALL," to conclude with similar remarks on THE
REDEMPTION.

Sabianism." My assertion was founded upon the argument, that in some
parts of *Africa*, and in *Sarmatia*, where the living serpent was the
supreme deity, there are no traces of any dæmon-worship or Sabianism.
Whereas in *every* country where the SUN was an object of idolatry, the
SERPENT was also venerated as divine.
