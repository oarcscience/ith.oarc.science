### CHAPTER IV.

### SERPENT-WORSHIP IN AMERICA.

I. MEXICO.--Every feature in the religion of the New World, discovered
by Cortez and Pizarro, indicates an origin common to the superstitions
of Egypt and Asia. The same solar worship, the same pyramidal monuments,
and the same concomitant OPHIOLATREIA distinguish them all.

From Acosta <span id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_419.md) we learn, that "*the
temple of Vitziliputzli was built of great stones in fashion of snakes
tied one to another, and the circuit was called* '*the circuit of
snakes*,'" because the walls of the enclosure were covered with the
figures of snakes <span id="fr_421"></span>[2](#fn_420.md). This god,
Vitziliputzli, "held in his right hand a staff cut in the form of a
serpent; and the four corners of the ark, in which he was seated,
terminated each with

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

a carved representation of the head of a serpent <span
id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_421.md)."

Vitziliputzli was an azure figure, from whose sides projected the heads
of two serpents: his right hand leaned upon a staff shaped like a
serpent <span id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_422.md).

The Mexican century was represented by a circle, having the sun in the
centre, surrounded by the symbols of the years. The circumference was A
SERPENT twisted into four knots at the cardinal points <span
id="fr_424"></span>[3](#fn_423.md).

The Mexican month was divided into twenty days; the *serpent* and
*dragon* symbolized two of them. In Mexico there was also a temple
dedicated to "the god of the air;" and the door of it was formed so as
to resemble a *serpent's* mouth <span id="fr_425"></span>[4](#fn_424.md).

The Mexicans, however, were not contented with the *symbolical* worship
of the sacred serpent. Like many other nations of the Ophite

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

family, they kept *live serpents* as household gods in their private
dwellings. An intelligent traveller <span
id="fr_426"></span>[1](#fn_425.md), to whom the literary republic is much
indebted for his observations on the Mexican idolatry, informs, us, that
"the rattle-snake was an object of veneration and worship among them:"
and that "representations of this reptile, and others of its species,
are very commonly met with among the remains of their ancient idolatry."
"The finest that is known to exist is to be seen in a deserted part of
the cloister of the Dominican convent, opposite to the palace of the
inquisition. It is coiled up in an irritated, erect position, with the
jaws extended, and in the act of gorging an elegantly dressed female,
who appears in the mouth of this enormous reptile, crushed and
lacerated."

A cast of this terrific idol was brought over to England by Mr. Bullock,
and fully corroborates the reiterated assertions of the Spaniards who
first invaded Mexico, that the people of that country worshipped an idol
in the form of a serpent. Bernal Dias del Castillo, who accompanied
Cortez, was introduced by Montezuma

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

into the interior of the principal temple, the description of which he
gives in the following manner:--"When we had ascended to the summit of
the temple, we observed on the platform, as we passed, the large stones
whereon were placed the victims who were to be sacrificed. Here was a
great figure which represented a DRAGON, and much blood spilt. . . . .
Cortez then addressed Montezuma, and requested that he would do him the
favour to show us his gods. Montezuma having first consulted the
priests, led us into a tower where was a kind of saloon. Here were two
altars, highly adorned with richly-wrought timbers on the roof; and over
the altars, gigantic figures, representing fat men. The one on the right
hand was Huitzilopochtli, their war god, with a great face and terrible
eyes. This figure was entirely covered with gold and jewels, and *his
body bound with golden serpents*. Before the idol was a pan of incense,
with three hearts of human victims, which were burning, mixed with
copal. . . . . . On the left was the other great figure, with a face
like a bear. . . . . . He was the god of the infernal regions . . . . .
his body was covered with figures representing devils with tails of

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

*serpents* . . . . . . . In this place they had a drum of most enormous
size, the head of which was made of the skins of *large serpents* . . .
. . . . At a little distance from this temple stood a tower . . . . . .
at the door stood frightful idols . . . . . like *serpents* and devils;
and before them were tables and knives for sacrifice."

For this extract I am indebted to a work of Mr. Bullock, which, under
the unassuming form of a descriptive pamphlet, contains much that is
instructive, both in references and original remarks. He tells us, that
from the great serpent, above mentioned, smaller ones were modelled in
stone, and probably kept by the Mexicans as Penates. One of these he
brought over to England. Such miniature copies of their gods were
frequently taken in Egypt, and the custom prevails in other places--the
Burmese universally follow it.

Mr. Bullock brought over also from Mexico a cast of an idol, which he
calls "the goddess of war," and thus describes it:--

"This monstrous idol is, with its pedestal, twelve feet high, and four
feet wide . . . . . . Its form is partly human, and the rest composed of
rattle-snakes and the tiger. The head, enormously

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

wide, seems that of two *rattle-snakes* united; the fangs hanging out of
the mouth, on which the still palpitating hearts of the unfortunate
victims were rubbed as an act of *the most acceptable oblation*. The
body is that of a deformed human frame, and the place of arms supplied
by the heads of *rattle-snakes*, placed on square plinths, and united by
fringed ornaments. Round the waist is a girdle, which was originally
covered with gold; and beneath this, reaching nearly to the ground, and
partly covering its deformed cloven feet, a drapery entirely composed of
wreathed *rattle-snakes*, which the natives call '*a garment of
serpents*.' . . . Between the feet, descending from the body, another
wreathed *serpent* rests his head upon the ground."

We learn from Acosta <span id="fr_427"></span>[1](#fn_426.md), that the
Mexicans sacrificed human victims to the god Virachoca; and that the
head of the unhappy creature about to be sacrificed was held back in a
wooden collar wrought in form of *a snake*."

Peter Martyr  <span id="fr_428"></span>[2](#fn_427.md) also mentions a
large serpent-idol at Campeachy, made of stones and bitumen, in the act
of devouring a marble lion. An

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

engraving of this idol is given in Ogilby's America, p. 77. When first
seen by the Spaniards it was warm with the blood of human victims.

But of all the works which may be consulted upon this subject, that of
M. Aglio, on "Mexican Antiquities," is most deserving of notice. It
contains fac-similes of nearly all the Azteck paintings known to be in
Europe, together with lithographic representations of sculptures, and
other monuments of this interesting people. These paintings and
sculptures abound with evidences of Mexican Ophiolatreia, and prove that
there was scarcely a Mexican deity who was not symbolized by a serpent
or a dragon. Many deities appear holding serpents in their hands; and
small figures of priests are represented *with a snake over each head*.
This reminds us, forcibly, of the priests of the Egyptian Isis, who are
described in sculpture, with the sacred asp upon the head, and a cone in
the left hand. And to confirm the original mutual connexion of all the
serpent-worshippers throughout the world--the Mexican paintings, as well
as the Egyptian and Persian hieroglyphics, describe THE OPHITE HIEROGRAM
of the intertwined

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

serpents, in almost all its variations <span
id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_428.md). A very remarkable one occurs in M.
Allard's collection of sculptures; in which the dragons, forming it,
have each *a man's head in his mouth!* The gods of Mexico are frequently
pictured fighting with serpents and dragons; and gods, and sometimes
men, are represented *in conversation* with the same loathsome
creatures. There is scarcely, indeed, a feature in the mystery of
Ophiolatreia, which may not be recognised in the Mexican superstitions.

We perceive, therefore, that in the kingdom of Mexico the serpent was
sacred, and emblematic of *more gods than one*: an observation which may
be extended to almost every other nation which adored the symbolical
serpent. This is a remarkable and valuable fact; and it discovers in
Ophiolatreia another feature of its aboriginal character. For it proves
*the serpent* to have been a symbol of *intrinsic divinity*, and not a
mere representative of peculiar properties which belong to some gods,
and not to others.

The serpent also entered into the religion of

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

the Mexicans as a charm. Whenever a person was ill, a priest was
immediately sent for, "who, having perfumed the patient, and shaved off
his hair, hung *snake's bones about his neck* <span
id="fr_430"></span>[1](#fn_429.md)."

In Couliacan, Nunnez de Gusman found, in the year 1531, the houses
filled with "thousands of serpents mingled together." And we are told
that "the inhabitants showed great reverence to these serpents because,
as they said, *the devil often appeared to them in that form* <span
id="fr_431"></span>[2](#fn_430.md)."

 

II\. PERU.--The Peruvians are charged with the same superstition of
serpent-worship as the Mexicans. "They worshipped," says Vossius, "the
goddess Isis, and were accustomed to represent her with two serpents at
her side <span id="fr_432"></span>[3](#fn_431.md)."

Whether this image represented Isis, or some other deity, it is certain
that *actual* as well as *symbolical* Ophiolatreia prevailed in Peru.
For, "in the temple of Pachamana, near Lima, tradition states that *the
devil did speak visibly*, and gave answer by his oracles; and that
sometimes they did see *a spotted snake* <span
id="fr_433"></span>[4](#fn_432.md)."

Of this kind was the "nachash" of the

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Hebrews, and the "purple-backed snake" of the
Greeks, both used in divination. The tradition of Pachamana forcibly
reminds us of the story of the Æsculapian serpent of Epidaurus, who on
important occasions glided from his sanctuary, and showed himself to his
votaries.

In the province of Topira in Peru, the Spaniards saw a temple, in front
of which was a moat containing a vast image of "a serpent of divers
metals, with his tayle in his mouth. A man was sacrificed before it
every year <span id="fr_434"></span>[1](#fn_433.md)."

In another part of the work, from which the above information is
derived, we read that "the Peruvians *worshipped snakes, and kept them
pictured in their temples and houses* <span
id="fr_435"></span>[2](#fn_434.md)."

The worship of the serpent in Peru was eventually superseded by the
Solar Superstition of the Incas. Having suppressed it in their own
country they carried on a war of proselytism in the neighbouring states.
Tupac Yupanqui, the eleventh Inca, conquered the Chacapuyans, and killed
their deity--a *snake*." This province lay eastward of Cassamarca. He
next overcame the Huacrachuca, who also "worshipped snakes and

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

kept them always pictured in their houses and temples <span
id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_435.md)."

The people of Manta who were conquered by Huayna Capac, among other
things "worshipped serpents of prodigious bigness <span
id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_436.md)."

"Blas Valeras, an author, who in loose papers wrote of the Indies,
describes those who live in *Antis* as more brutal than the beasts
themselves; for they have neither God, nor law, nor virtue, nor have
they any idols or worship, unless sometimes when the Devil presents
himself in the form of a serpent or other animal*, they then worship and
adore him* <span id="fr_438"></span>[3](#fn_437.md)."

From these incidental notices, scattered up and down among the writings
of the Spaniards, who rather accidentally alluded to, than designedly
investigated the religion of the New World, we find that the worship of
the sacred serpent had its votaries in almost every place where man had
a domicile.

With these cursory notices, we must take leave of Spanish America--more
in astonishment that so much information, valuable to

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

literature and Christian theology, has escaped the barbarism of the
church of Rome, than in disappointment that so little of authentic
history has been preserved for our instruction.

English America being in a state of extreme rudeness when the first
settlers occupied it; and these settlers being either illiterate
themselves, or engrossed by a religion so exclusively severe as to
despise or abhor inquiry into any other; we have little or no account of
the superstitions of the native Indians upon which we can rely. I have
seen, indeed, a book, printed about that period, purporting to be an
account of the religion of the Virginians, in which these people are
represented as worshipping graven images; and, among the rest, that of a
serpent upon a pillar. But the whole work is written in a manner so
extravagantly credulous, that I did not care to preserve even the memory
of its title-page. Besides, the rude state of the arts among these
Indians could not have permitted them to arrive at such a perfection in
sculpture as is there represented. The book is to be found in Sion
College library.

A more respectable authority, however, occurs in Purchas's Pilgrims,
who, by the incidental

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

mention of a trivial circumstance, would [induce](errata.htm#2.md) us to
infer, that the worship of the serpent was not altogether unknown even
in these inhospitable wilds. *The chief priest* among the Virginians was
observed to wear on his head a sacerdotal ornament of "*snake skins tied
together by the tails* <span id="fr_439"></span>[1](#fn_438.md)."

Now this circumstance, though apparently trivial, is not to be
overlooked; for it brings to recollection an Egyptian custom which
certainly prevailed among the votaries of the sacred serpent. The
priests of Isis were, in particular, notified by the figure of an *asp*
upon their bonnets; and we sometimes see a priest represented in
sculpture with *a small serpent upon his bare head*. Again, *serpents in
the hair* were a necessary part of the ornaments of a bacchanal. A
similar ornament is observed on the heads of the priests in M. Aglio's
Mexican antiquities; and the Mexicans were certainly
serpent-worshippers. Is it not, therefore, possible, that the head-dress
of the chief priest, among the wild Virginians, may have had a similar
respect to the god of his adoration, or to the symbol of that deity?

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

The [accompanying plate](#img_30600.md), which represents an Indian of the
country N. W. of Louisiana, exhibits a priest of the Solar-Ophite
religion. The Sun and Serpent tattooed upon his breast, and pictured
upon the instrument in his hand are curious illustrations of ancient
customs. The former especially remind us of the "stigmata <span
id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_439.md)" alluded to by *Job*, and St. *Paul*,
which were borne on the body of the priests of all the old religions;
and are still used to distinguish the Brahminical sects.

There is also an obscure Canadian tradition which seems to have belonged
to the superstition of the Serpent. Whenever it thundered the natives
believed "that the Devil was endeavouring to vomit a horrible serpent,
and by straining to evacuate the same, rent the clouds and caused
thunder <span id="fr_441"></span>[2](#fn_440.md)."

Among the islands of the Southern Ocean we can hardly expect to find any
traces of this idolatry. It is curious, however, to observe that in New
Zealand there is a tradition that the serpent once spoke with a human
voice <span id="fr_442"></span>[3](#fn_441.md).

These islanders also believed, that in the interior

 

<span id="img_30600"></span>

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

of the island is an enormous Lizard, animated by an Evil Spirit, who
preys upon the human race. The Lizard worship prevails also in Africa,
and is kindred to that of the serpent.

The inhabitants of the Tonga islands also believe that "the primitive
gods sometimes come into the bodies of lizards, porpoises, and sea
snakes--and hence these animals are much respected <span
id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_442.md)."

There is a remarkable passage in Tasman's voyage to the South Seas;
which, if it does not actually *prove* the original Ophiolatreia of
these islanders, yet tends to corroborate the hypothesis. Speaking of
Rotterdam island he says, that "the inhabitants know nothing about
religion or divine worship; they have no idols, relics, or priests, but
they have nevertheless superstitions: *for I saw a man take up a water
snake which was near his boat, and put it respectfully on his head, and
then, again into the water*."

I will not insist that this, and the preceding facts are *irrefragable*
proofs of original Ophiolatreia:--but I cannot help thinking it
*possible* that such *may* be the case. The Polynesians are apparently
derived from Malaya, and the

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ophite superstition was once very prevalent in
all the neighbouring countries of Asia. But beyond this possibility I
would not press the argument. *Valeat quantum valet*.
