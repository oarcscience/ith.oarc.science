This is an early 19th century study of Ophiolatreia, or snake-worship.
Deane's primary thesis here is that ancient serpent worship was based on
memories of the Garden of Eden. He has a monomaniacal devotion to the
subject of snake worship and sees evidence of it everywhere. Deane
reviews a massive amount of data from antiquity, travelers tales, and
legend and folklore. A particularly compelling portion of the book
describes ancient megalithic temples such as the Avebury and Carnac
complexes as giant representations of snakes. One wonders what he would
have made of the ancient American mound builders, who made huge sinuous
earth sculptures in the Ohio valley.

Because he wrote before such advances such as the decipherment of
Egyptian hieroglyphics, excavations in Mesopotamia, detailed knowledge
of eastern religions in the west, and the systematic study of folklore
and anthropology, much of this information is outdated or incorrect. For
instance, many of his etymologies can't be supported by modern
historical linguistics. On the other hand, many later discoveries added
to our understanding of the special role that snakes and other reptiles
play in religion and mythology.

Modern writers from Carl Sagan to David Icke have taken the same themes
and derived interesting, if controversial theses of their own. Sagan (in
[The Dragons of
Eden](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345346297/internetsacredte).md)
wrote about the ancient relationship between mammals and reptiles which
goes back to the time of the dinosaurs. Sagan pointed out that there is
a section of our brain, which is morphologically and functionally
similar to a reptile brain, embedded in our brain stem, called the
"Reptilian Complex". He also discussed the fear of snakes which seems to
be hard-wired into our brains, and inferred that it began in the
primordial struggle for survival between reptiles and mammals. At the
other end of the spectrum,
[Icke](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0953881016/internetsacredte.md)
believes that a shapeshifting race of reptilians have dominated history
and even today are the secret rulers of our planet. Certainly, the full
account of this topic has yet to be written.
