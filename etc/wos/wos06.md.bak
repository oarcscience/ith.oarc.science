### CHAPTER III.

### SERPENT-WORSHIP IN EUROPE.

I. GREECE.--Whether the learned and ingenious Bryant <span
id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) be correct or not, in deriving the very
name of EUROPE from אור־אב (AUR-AB), the *solar serpent*, it is certain
that Ophiolatreia prevailed in this quarter of the globe at the earliest
period of idolatry <span id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_252.md).

Of the countries of Europe, Greece was first colonized by Ophites, but
at separate times, both from Egypt and Phœnicia; and it is a question of
some doubt, though perhaps of little importance, whether the leader of
the first colony, the celebrated Cadmus, was a Phœnician or an Egyptian.
Bochart has shown that Cadmus

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

was the leader of the *Canaanites* who fled before the arms of the
victorious Joshua; and Bryant has proved that he was an *Egyptian*,
identical with THOTH. But as mere names of individuals are of no
importance, when all agree that the same superstition existed
contemporaneously in the two countries, and since Thoth is declared by
Sanchoniathon to have been the father of the Phœnician as well as
Egyptian Ophiolatreia; we may endeavour, without presumption, to
reconcile the opinions of these learned authors, by assuming each to be
right in his own line of argument; and by *generalizing* the name
CADMUS, instead of appropriating it to individuals. By the word CADMUS,
therefore, we may understand the leader of the CADMONITES, whether of
Egypt or Phœnicia. There would, consequently, be as many persons of this
name, as colonies of this denomination.

The first appearance of these idolaters in Europe is mythologically
described under the fable of "Cadmus and Europa;" according to which,
the former came in search of the latter, who was his sister, and had
been carried off to Europe by Jupiter in the form of a bull.

If EUROPA be but a personification of the

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

\[paragraph continues\] SOLAR SERPENT-WORSHIP, and CADMUS a leader of
serpent-worshippers, the whole fable is easily solved.

Europa was carried by Jupiter to Crete, where she afterwards married
ASTERIUS: that is, the SOLAR SERPENT-WORSHIP was established in Crete,
and afterwards united with the worship of the HEAVENLY HOST: *Asterius*
being derived from ἀστὴρ, *a star*.

For the explanation of that portion of the fable which relates to the
BULL, the reader is referred to Bryant, Anal. vol. ii. 455, who thinks
that it bore an allusion to the god APIS of Egypt, by whose oracular
advice the migration was undertaken. A similar worship, however,
prevailed in Syria; for we find that the Phœnician Cadmus, (*Cadmus the
son of Phœnix*), when he went in search of his sister, followed a cow.
This latter colony is said to have settled in Eubœa; to which they gave
the name of their tutelary deity, AUB; for *Eubœa* is, according to
Bryant, AUB-AIA, "the land of AUB <span
id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_253.md)."

The history of Cadmus is full of fables about serpents. He slew a
dragon, planted its teeth, and hence arose armed men, who destroyed

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

each other until five only remained. These assisted him in building the
city of THEBES. One of these five builders of Thebes was named after the
serpent-god of the Phœnicians, OPHION.

Cadmus, and his wife Harmonia, finished their travels at Encheliæ in
Illyricum, where, instead of dying a natural death, they were *changed
into serpents*. This conclusion of the story throws a light upon the
whole. *The leader of these Opiates after death was deified, and adored
under the symbol of a serpent*. He became, in fact, the SERPENT-GOD of
the country, as Thoth had become the serpent-god of Egypt. Having been
the author, he became the object of the idolatry.

Besides the Cadmian colony, which settled chiefly in Bœotia, a second
irruption of Ophites is noticed in history, as coming from Egypt under
the guidance of CECROPS. These took possession of Attica, and founded
Athens, whose first name was, in consequence, CECROPIA. In this word,
also, we trace the involution of the name OB, or OPS, the serpent-god of
antiquity; and accordingly, Cecrops <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_254.md) himself is said to

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

have been of twofold form, *human* and *serpentine* <span
id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_255.md). It was also said, that from a serpent
he was changed into a man <span id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_256.md). We read
too of DRACO (Δράκων, *a dragon*) being the first king of Athens. All
these relate to the introduction of serpent-worship from Egypt into
Attica, the leader of which colony, by a fabulous metonyme, was called a
"*dragon*," or *serpent*. The *first* altar erected by Cecrops at
Athens, was to OPS, the serpent-deity <span
id="fr_258"></span>[3](#fn_257.md); a circumstance which confirms the
inference deduced by Bryant; namely, that he introduced Ophiolatreia
into Attica. Cecrops and Draco were probably the same person.

2\. The symbolical worship of the serpent was so common in Greece, that
Justin Martyr accuses the Greeks of introducing it into the mysteries of
all their gods.

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

Παρὰ παντὶ τῶν νομιζομένων παῤ ὕμῖν θεῶν Ὄφις  
σύμβολον μέγα καὶ μυστήριον ἀναγράφεται  <span
id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_258.md)

\[paragraph continues\] This was especially true in regard to the
mysteries of Bacchus. The people who assisted at them were crowned with
serpents, and carried them in their hands, brandishing them over their
heads, and shouting with great vehemence, ευια, ευια <span
id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_259.md); "which being roughly aspirated,"
remarks Clemens Alexandrinus, "will denote the female serpent <span
id="fr_261"></span>[3](#fn_260.md)." A consecrated serpent was a sign of
the Bacchic orgies <span id="fr_262"></span>[4](#fn_261.md); a very
important part of which consisted in a procession of noble virgins,
carrying in their hands golden baskets, which contained sesamum, *small
pyramids*, wool, *honey-cakes*, (having raised lumps upon them like
*navels*), grains of salt, and A SERPENT <span
id="fr_263"></span>[5](#fn_262.md).

Three ingredients in these baskets are remarkable,

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

as connected with THE WORSHIP OF THE SOLAR SERPENT.

1\. The pyramids, which were intended as representations of the sun's
rays, and are sometimes seen in the hands of priests kneeling before the
sacred serpent of Egypt <span id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_263.md). The
supplicating minister of the god offers a pyramid in his left hand,
while the right is field up in adoration. On his head is the deadly asp.

2\. *The honey-cakes marked with the sacred omphalos*. These were also
offerings made at the shrine of the sacred serpent; for we read in
Herodotus, that in the Acropolis at Athens was kept a serpent who was
considered the guardian of the city. He was fed on cakes of honey once a
month <span id="fr_265"></span>[2](#fn_264.md). The serpent of Metele was
presented with the same food or offering <span
id="fr_266"></span>[3](#fn_265.md).

Medicated cakes, in which honey was a chief ingredient, were at once the
food and the offering to the dragon of the Hesperides--

                   ------------- Sacerdos  
Hesperidum templi custos, *epulasque draconi* <span id="page_190">p.
190</span>  
*Quæ dabat*, et sacros servabat in arbore ramos,  
*Spargens humida mella*, soporiferumque papaver.  
                                      Virgil, i n. iv. 483.

A similar offering was made to Cerberus, by the prophetess who conducted
Æneas

Cui vates horrere videns jam colla *colubris*  
*Melle soporatam et medicatis frugibus offam*  
Objicit ----------  
                                         Æn. vi. 419.

\[paragraph continues\] *Honey cakes* were also carried by the initiated
into the cave of Trophonius to appease the guardian serpents <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_266.md). So that this offering was universally
peculiar to Ophiolatreia.

The honey-cake, however, when properly pre-pared, was marked with the
sacred *Omphalos*--a remarkable peculiarity on which it may be proper to
make a few observations.

The superstition of the OMPHALOS was extensively prevalent. It entered
into the religions of India and Greece, and is one of the most
figurative and obscure parts of mythology. The omphalos is a boss, upon
which is described a spiral line; but whether or not this spiral line
may have been originally designed to represent

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

*a coiled serpent*, I will not pretend to determine; though such a
meaning has been affixed to it by an ingenious writer <span
id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_267.md) upon the antiquities of New Grange in
Ireland. In describing similar lines upon some rude stones discovered at
this place, he tells us, "they appear to be the representations of
serpents coiled up, and probably were symbols of the Divine being."
"Quintus Curtius confirms this hypothesis, when he says, that the temple
of Jupiter Ammon in Africa had a rude stone, whereon was drawn a spiral
line, the symbol of the deity."

Whatever may have been the meaning of this spiral line, which Quintus
Curtius calls a *navel*, one thing is evident, that the *omphalos*,
*umbilicus*, or *navel*, was *sacred to the serpent-god*: for it not
only occurs in the mystic baskets of the Bacchic orgies, but was also
kept at DELPHI <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_268.md), "*because*," says
Pausanias, "*this was the middle of the earth*." The absurdity of this
notion at once refers us to some better reason; but absurd as it is, the
same idea seems to have

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

prevailed generally; for we read of an omphalos of the Peloponnesus at
Phlius, in Achaia: "*if it be as they say*," adds the incredulous
topographer <span id="fr_270"></span>[1](#fn_269.md).

Near the latter omphalos was a temple of BACCHUS, another of APOLLO, and
another of ISIS, to each of which deities the serpent was sacred. The
sacred omphalos, therefore, would seem to bear very much upon the
adoration of the serpent; and *it is a question* whether or not it was
originally intended to represent a *coiled serpent as symbolical of
divinity*.

The esoteric tradition of the omphalos, according to Diodorus <span
id="fr_271"></span>[2](#fn_270.md), is, that when the infant Jupiter was
nursed by the Curetes, his *navel* fell at the river Triton in Crete;
whence that territory was called *Omphalos*. But this legend is
evidently invented from the ambiguity of the word. Bryant derives
*omphalos* from OMPHIEL, "*the oracle of the sun* <span
id="fr_272"></span>[3](#fn_271.md)." Such an oracle would not be unaptly
represented by a coiled serpent, a serpent being the most popular emblem
of the sun, and also of an oracle.

3\. The third feature, and the most remarkable

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

of all, in the Bacchic orgies, was the mystic SERPENT. This was,
undoubtedly, the σύμβολον μέγα καὶ μυστήριον of the festival. The
MYSTERY of religion was, throughout the world, concealed in a *chest* or
*box*. As the Israelites had their sacred ark, every nation upon earth
had some holy receptacle for sacred things and symbols. The story of
Ericthonius is illustrative of this remark. He was the fourth king of
Athens, and his body terminated in the tails of *serpents*, instead of
human legs. He was placed by Minerva in a *basket*, which she gave to
the daughters of CECROPS, with strict injunctions not to open it. Here
we have a fable made out of the simple fact of *the mysterious basket*,
in which the sacred serpent was carried at the orgies of Bacchus. The
whole legend relates to Ophiolatreia.

In accordance with the general practice, the worshippers of Bacchus
carried in their consecrated baskets or chests, the MYSTERY of their
God, together with the offerings.

Catullus, (*Nuptiæ Pel. et Thetidis*, 256,) in describing these
Bacchanals, says:

Pars sese tortis serpentibus incingebant,  
Pars obscura cavis celebrabant orgia cistis.

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

The *contents* of the basket were, therefore, the MYSTERY; and
especially *the serpent*. Archbishop Potter says as much: "In these
consisted *the most mysterious part of the solemnity*;" but he adds,
inconsiderately, "*and therefore to amuse the common people* (!)
serpents were put into them, which sometimes crawling out of their
places, astonished the beholders <span id="fr_273"></span>[1](#fn_272.md)."
Whatever might have been the astonishment of the beholders, that of the
priests would not have been little, to have been told that their sacred
serpent, the of σύμβολον μέγα καὶ μυστήριον, was nothing more than a
device to amuse the common people.

It is observable that the Christian Ophites, who were of the school of
the Egyptian gnostics, kept their sacred serpent in a *chest*; and the
orgies of Bacchus were derived from the same source of Egyptian
gnosticism--the mysteries of Isis.

So great was the veneration of the Cretans for their Bacchic baskets,
that they frequently stamped the figures of them upon their coins. Nor
were these baskets confined to the orgies of Bacchus. They were employed
also in the mysteries of Ceres, Isis, and Osiris <span
id="fr_274"></span>[2](#fn_273.md).

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

Another custom of the Bacchantes is remarkable for its connexion with
Ophiolatreia. After the banquet, they were accustomed to carry round a
cup, which they called "the cup of the good dæmon." "Ingenti clamore
BONUM DEUM invocant venerantes Bacchum, cujus quoque in memoriam
POCULUM, sublatis mensis, circumferunt, quod poculum BONI DÆMONIS
appellant <span id="fr_275"></span>[1](#fn_274.md)."

The symbol of the "good dæmon" was a serpent, as may be proved from a
medal of the town of Dionysopolis, in Thrace. On one side of the coin
were the heads of Gordian and Serapis, on the other a *coiled
serpent* <span id="fr_276"></span>[2](#fn_275.md). Dionysopolis was named
from Dionusus, a name which was borne by the Indian Bacchus, who in his
own country was called *Deonaush*.

In the collection of the Earl of Besborough, was a beautiful antique
drinking cup cut out of a solid piece of rock crystal, on the lid of
which are two serpents, and upon the cup near the rim, the Ophite
hierogram in the form of a Medusa's head. Mr. Pownall, in the seventh
volume of the Archæologia, proves that this cup was consecrated to
religious uses; and supposes

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

that it might have been employed in drinking to the Tria Numina, after a
feast. One of the "Tria Numina" was called AGATHODÆMON. I conjecture
therefore, that this was the "poculum Boni Dæmonis," used in the
Bacchanalian mysteries.

The following lines from Martial, prove that the impress of a *serpent*
upon a cup, was a sign of consecration:

Cælatus tibi cum sit Ammiane  
*Serpens in paterâ* Myronis arte,  
Vaticana bibis!  
                           Lib. vi. Epig. 92.

The serpent entered into the symbolical worship of many others of the
Grecian deities.

Minerva was sometimes represented with a dragon; her statues by Phidias
were decorated with this emblem <span id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_276.md).
In plate, p. 85, vol. i. of Montfaucon, are several medals of Minerva;
in one of them she holds a *caduceus* in the right hand; in another, a
staff, round which a serpent is twisted; in a third, a large serpent
appears marching before her. Other medals represent her crest as
composed of a serpent. So that this was a notorious emblem of the

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

goddess of WISDOM: *so* applied, perhaps, from a legendary memorial of
"the subtilty" which the serpent displayed in Paradise; whereas, his
attribution to the god of DRUNKENNESS may be accounted for from a
traditionary recollection of the prostration of mind sustained by our
first parents, through communion with the serpent tempter.

The city of Athens was peculiarly consecrated to the goddess Minerva;
and in the Acropolis was kept a live serpent, who was generally
considered as the guardian of the place. The emperor Hadrian built a
temple at Athens to Jupiter Olympius, and "placed in it a dragon which
he caused to be brought from India <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_277.md)." Upon the walls of Athens was
sculptured a Medusa's head, whose hair was *intertwined with snakes*. In
the temple of Minerva, at Tegea, there was a similar sculpture, which
was said to have been given by the goddess herself, to preserve that
city from being taken in war <span id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_278.md). The
virtue supposed to reside in this head was of a talismanic power, to
preserve or destroy.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

The same author <span id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_279.md) who records the
preceding fact, tells us of a priestess, who, going into a sanctuary of
Minerva in the dead of the night, saw a vision of that goddess, who held
up her mantle, upon which was impressed a Medusa's head. The sight of
this fearful talisman instantaneously converted the intruder into
*stone*. The same Gorgon or Medusa's head, was on the aegis and
breastplate of the goddess <span id="fr_281"></span>[2](#fn_280.md), to
induce a terrific aspect in the field of battle. The *terror* resided in
the *snakes*; for the face of Medusa was "*mild* and *beautiful* <span
id="fr_282"></span>[3](#fn_281.md)." From some such notion of a talismanic
power, perhaps, the Argives, Athenians, and Ionians, after the taking of
Tanagra from the Lacedæmonians, erected a statue of victory in the grove
of Jupiter Olympius, on whose shield was engraved *a Medusa's
head* <span id="fr_283"></span>[4](#fn_282.md). The same symbolical figure
may be frequently seen on sepulchral urns. This general impression of a
powerful charm inherent in the Gorgon, must be attributed to some
forgotten tradition respecting the *serpents* in the hair; for all agree
that the face of Medusa was far from

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

being terrific. Some engravings of this head, preserved in Montfaucon,
explain the mystery. From these we may infer, that this celebrated
talisman was no other than the still more celebrated emblem of
consecration, the CIRCLE, WINGS, and SERPENT; whose history, use, and
probable origin we considered in the first chapter of this treatise. In
the plate in Montfaucon, above referred to <span
id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_283.md), are representations of Medusa's head,
from either side of whose forehead proceeds a WING; and TWO SERPENTS,
intersecting one another below the chin in a *nodes Herculis*, appear
*over* the forehead, looking at each other.

Take away the human face in the centre, with its remaining snaky locks,
and you have the Egyptian emblem of consecration, THE SERPENTS AND
WINGED CIRCLE; the circle being formed by the bodies of the snakes. The
Gorgon is, therefore, nothing more than THE CADUCEUS *without its
staff*.

The intimate connexion of this emblem with the serpent-worship, we have
already observed: and it is worthy of remark, that the *Argives*,

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Athenians*, and *Ionians*, who erected the
statue of victory at Tanagra with a Gorgon-shield, were descendants of
*serpent worshippers*.

This celebrated hierogram of the Ophites was painted on the shield of
Perseus, an *Argive*, who was distinguished by the device of "Medusa's
head." And Hippomedon, *an Argive also*, one of the seven chiefs before
Thebes <span id="fr_285"></span>[1](#fn_284.md), bore the same hierogram,
if 1 rightly understand these lines of Æschylus:--

Ὄφεων δὲ πλεκτάναισὶ περίδρομον κύτος  
Προσηδάφισται κοιλογάστορος κύκλου.  
                 Ἑπρὰ ἐπὶ Θήβας. 501, 502.

\[paragraph continues\] The poet is describing the devices upon the
shields of the besiegers, and the above are the "armorial bearings" of
Hippomedon. "*The hollow circumference of the concave shield was carried
towards the ground* (προσηδάφισται) *in the folds of serpents*." By
which I understand the poet to mean, that the centre of the shield was a
little raised, and *a circular cavity* ran round between it and the rim
of the shield. In this cavity

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (*towards the lower part of it*) were folded
serpents--which would accurately describe the ophite hierogram <span
id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_285.md); the raised part of the shield
representing the mystic circle or globe--for we must observe, that the
shield was "*hollow-bellied*;" i.e. *concave to the bearer*; and,
consequently, *convex* to the enemy.

The people of Argos had a tradition which indicates *their* ophite
origin also. The city was said to have "been infested with serpents,
until Apis came from Egypt and settled in it. To him they attribute the
blessing of having their country freed from this evil; but the brood
came from the very quarter from whence Apis was supposed to have come.
They were certainly Hivites from Egypt <span
id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_286.md)."

The breastplate and baldrick of Agamemnon, king of Argos, exhibited the
device of a *triple-headed serpent* <span
id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_287.md). His brother Menelaus, king of Sparta,
was similarly distinguished by a serpent upon his shield. The Spartans,
as well as the Athenians, believed in their serpentine origin, and
called themselves *ophiogenæ*.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

In Argolis, moreover, was the town of Epidaurus, famous for the temple
of Æsculapius, where that god was worshipped under the symbol of a
serpent. We read in Pausanias <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_288.md) that
live serpents were kept here, and fed regularly by servants, who laid
their food upon the floor, but dared not approach the sacred reptiles.
This must have been only through *religious* awe; for the serpents of
Epidaurus were said to be *harmless* <span
id="fr_290"></span>[2](#fn_289.md). The statue of Æsculapius at this
temple, represented him leaning upon a staff, and resting one hand upon
the head of a serpent <span id="fr_291"></span>[3](#fn_290.md). His sister,
the goddess Hygeia, was represented with a large serpent twisted about
her, and drinking out of a chalice in her hand. Sometimes it was coiled
up in her lap; at others, held in the hand <span
id="fr_292"></span>[4](#fn_291.md).

The serpent was sacred to Æsculapius and Hygeia, as a symbol of
*health*; but *how* he came to be a symbol of health is not very
satisfactorily explained. It is said by Pliny, that the flesh of this
creature is sometimes used in medicine, and that *this* was the reason
of his consecration to "health." Others again inform us, that the

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

serpent changes his skin periodically, and thus becomes an emblem of
renewed vigour in a sick man. These, however, can only be considered as
the surmises of a warm imagination <span
id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_292.md). The use of animals of the reptile kind
in medicine was not confined to the serpent; or, if it were, from whence
could *the idea itself* originate, that the serpent's flesh was
sanatory? The changing of his skin being *periodical*, can scarcely
denote recovered health, which is seldom renewed at given intervals. In
the absence of every other probable reason, we may refer this notion to
the *effect* produced upon Adam and Eve, when, at the instigation of THE
SERPENT, they "took and ate," and "*their eyes were opened*." Another
derivation has indeed been assigned, which has much plausibility
attached to it; but chronology confutes the opinion. Many authors have
believed that the erection of the brazen serpent in the wilderness by
Moses, might have given cause for the attribution of the serpent to the

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

god of health; especially as he is represented very often, under this
character, encircling a stick or pole in the hand of Æsculapius. I
acknowledge the affinity of the ideas; but being persuaded that the
Æsculapian worship was of Egyptian origin, and having already shown from
Wisdom, ch. xi. ver. 15, that the worship of the serpent prevailed in
Egypt *before* the Exodus of the Israelites, I cannot believe that an
Egyptian superstition owes its beginning to any incident in Israelitish
history.

A tradition is recorded by Pausanias <span
id="fr_294"></span>[1](#fn_293.md) of one Nicagora, the wife of Echetimus,
who conveyed the god Æsculapius to Sicyon under the form of a serpent.
The Sicyonians erected statues to him; one of which represented a woman
sitting upon a serpent. An anecdote of the deportation of Æsculapius to
Rome, similar to the preceding, is related by Livy, Ovid, Floras,
Valerius Maximus, and Aurelius Victor. From whom it appears, that a
pestilence having arisen in Rome, the oracle of Delphi advised an
embassy to Epidaurus, to fetch the god Æsculapius; Quintus Ogulnius

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

and ten others were accordingly sent with the humble supplications of
the senate and people of Rome. While they were gazing in admiration at
the superb statue of the god, a serpent, "venerable, not horrible,"
which rarely appeared but when he intended to confer some extraordinary
benefit, glided from his lurking place; and having passed through the
city, went directly to the Roman vessel, and coiled himself up in the
berth of Ogulnius. The ambassadors, "carrying the god," set sail; and
being off Antium, the serpent leaped into the sea, and swam to the
nearest temple of Apollo, and after a few days returned. But when they
entered the Tiber, he leaped upon an island, and disappeared. Here the
Romans erected a temple to him in the shape of a ship; and the plague
was stayed "with wonderful celerity."

Ovid, (*Met*. 15, 665,) gives an animated description of this embassy,
which is well worthy of attention, as illustrative of the deification of
the serpent.

Postera sidereos aurora fugaverat ignes;  
Incerti quid agant proceres, ad templa petiti  
Conveniunt operosa Dei: quaque ipse morari  
Sede velit, signis cœlestibus indicet, orant. <span id="page_206">p.
206</span>  
Vix bene desierant cùm cristis aureus altis  
In SERPENTE DEUS prænuntia sibila misit:  
Adventuque suo signumque arasque foresque  
Marmoreumque solum, fastigiaque aurea movit:  
Pectoribusque tenus mediâ sublimis in æde  
Constitit; atque oculos circumtulit igne micantes.  
Territa turba pavet, *cognovit* NUMINA custos,  
Evinctus vittâ trines albente sacerdos.  
Et "DEUS en! DEUS en! linguisque animisque favete  
Quisquis ades," dixit. "Sis, O pulcherrime, visus  
Utiliter: *populosque juves* TUA SACRA *colentes*."

The god having passed through the temple and city, arrives at the port:

Restitit hic; agmenque suum, turbæque sequentis  
Officium placido visus dimittere vultu,  
Corpus in Ausoniâ posuit rate.

When the vessel entered the Tiber, the whole city of Rome was poured out
to meet the god:

Obvia turba ruit -------------  
------------ lætoque clamore salutant.

These spirited lines alone, without any other

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

support from history, would prove the extent to which the worship of the
serpent was carried by the ancients.

The incarnation of deity in a serpent was not an uncommon event in
Grecian mythology. We read of Olympias, Nicotelea, and Aristodamia,
mothers, of Alexander, Aristomenes, and Aratus, respectively, by some
god who had changed himself into the form of a serpent <span
id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_294.md). The conversion of Jupiter and Rhea into
snakes, gave occasion to a fable respecting the origin of the Caduceus;
which is so far pertinent to our theory, that it implies the *divine
character* of those sacred serpents, which formed in that talisman the
circle and crescent.

Jupiter again metamorphosed himself into a dragon, to deceive
Proserpine. These, and all other similar fables in mythology, are
founded upon the deception of Eve by a SPIRITUAL BEING, who assumed the
form of a serpent.

Dragons were sacred to the goddess Ceres; her car was drawn by them.

They were symbolical also of the Ephesian Diana, and of Cybele, the
mother of the gods,

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

as we may see in the engravings of Montfaucon <span
id="fr_296"></span>[1](#fn_295.md).

Of all the places in Greece, Bœotia seems to have been the most
favourite residence of the Ophites. The Thebans boasted themselves to be
the descendants of the warriors who sprung from the dragon's teeth sown
by Cadmus. "The history of this country," says Bryant, "had continual
reference to serpents and dragons; they seem to have been the national
insigne at least of Thebes. Hence we find upon the tomb of Epaminondas,
the figure of a serpent, to signify that he was an Ophite or
Theban <span id="fr_297"></span>[2](#fn_296.md)." In like manner the Theban
Hercules bore upon his shield the sacred hierogram by which the warriors
of the Cadmian family were distinguished--"As he went, his adamantine
shield sounded . . . . . . . . *in a* CIRCLE TWO DRAGONS *were
suspended, lifting up their heads* <span
id="fr_298"></span>[3](#fn_297.md)."

At Thespiæ, in Bœotia, they worshipped Jupiter Saotas; the origin of
whose worship is thus related: When A DRAGON had once laid waste the
town, Jupiter directed that

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

every year a young man, chosen by lot, should be offered to THE SERPENT.
The lot fell at length on Cleostrus, when his friend, Menestratus,
having made a brazen breastplate and studded it with hooks, put it on,
and presented himself to the dragon. Thus they both perished together.
From that time the Thespians erected an altar to Jupiter Saotas <span
id="fr_299"></span>[1](#fn_298.md)."

But the most celebrated seat of Ophiolatreia in Greece was at DELPHI.
The original name of this place, according to Strabo, was PYTHO;
supposed to be so called from the serpent PYTHON, slain there by Apollo.
The connexion of such a legend with the place, and the derivation of its
original name from the serpent Python, which is thought to be the PETHEN
of the Hebrews, might well induce the learned Heinsius to conclude that
"the god Apollo was first worshipped at Delphi, under the symbol of a
serpent." Hyginus <span id="fr_300"></span>[2](#fn_299.md) says, that the
dragon Python formerly *gave oracles* in Mount Parnassus--"PYTHON, Terræ
filius, draco ingens. Hic ante Apollinem *ex oraculo* in motile Parnasso
*responsa dare* solitus erat." The same says

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ælian <span id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_300.md); and
Plutarch <span id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_301.md) affirms, that the contest
between Apollo and Python was respecting *the oracle*. Python was,
therefore, in reality, the deity of the place <span
id="fr_303"></span>[3](#fn_302.md)."

The public assemblies at Delphi were called *Pythia*. These were
doubtless, originally intended for the adoration of Python <span
id="fr_304"></span>[4](#fn_303.md). *Seven days* after the victory of
Apollo over Python, the Pythian games were instituted, on the *seventh
day* of which, an hymn called Paean was sung to Apollo in honour of his
victory <span id="fr_305"></span>[5](#fn_304.md). Hence the expression of
Hesiod--ἕβδομον ἱερὸν ἦμαρ--which so singularly corresponds with our
Sabbath.

When the priestess of Apollo delivered her oracles, she stood, or sat,
upon a *tripod*. This was a name commonly given to any sort of vessel,
seat, or table, supported upon three feet. The tripod of the Pythian
priestess was distinguished by a base emblematical of her god. It was a
*triple-headed serpent* of brass, whose body,

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

folded in circles growing wider and wider towards the ground, formed a
*conical column*. The *cone*, it should be remembered was sacred to the
solar deity. The three heads were disposed triangularly, in order to
sustain the three feet of the tripod, which was of gold. Herodotus <span
id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_305.md) tells us, that it was consecrated to
Apollo by the Greeks, out of the spoils of the Persians after the battle
of Plata a. He describes it accurately. Pausanias <span
id="fr_307"></span>[2](#fn_306.md), who mentions it also, omits the fact of
the three heads. He records a tradition of a *more ancient* tripod,
which was carried off by the Tyrinthian Hercules, but restored by the
son of Amphitryon. An engraving of the serpentine column of the Delphic
tripod may be seen in Montfaucon, vol. ii. p. 86. The golden portion of
this tripod was carried away by the Phocians when they pillaged the
temple of Delphi; an outrage which involved them in the sacred war which
terminated in their ruin. The Thebans, who were the foremost among the
avengers of Delphi, were the most notorious Ophites of antiquity.

Athena us calls this tripod, "*the tripod of* 

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

*truth* <span id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_307.md),"--a most singular
perversion of the fact upon which the oracle was founded--the
conversation of the serpent in Paradise.

According to Gibbon, the serpentine column was transported from Delphi
to Constantinople, by the founder of the latter city, and set up on a
pillar in the Hippodrome <span id="fr_309"></span>[2](#fn_308.md). He cites
Zosimus, who is also cited by Montfaucon on the same subject: but the
latter thinks that Constantine only caused a *similar* column to be
made, and did not remove the original from Delphi. It is most probable,
however, that Gibbon is right <span id="fr_310"></span>[3](#fn_309.md).

This celebrated relic of Ophiolatreia is still to be seen in the same
place, where it was set up by Constantine; but one of the serpents'
heads is mutilated. This was done by Mahomet the second, the Turkish
conqueror of Constantinople, when he entered the city. The story is thus
related by Leunclavius:--"When Mahomet came to the Atmeidan, he saw
there a stone column, on which was placed a three-headed brazen serpent.
Looking on it, he asked, '*What idol is that?*' and at the same time,
hurling his

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

iron mace with great force, knocked off the lower jaw of one of the
three serpents' heads. *Upon which, immediately, a great number of
serpents began to be seen in the city*. Whereupon some advised him to
leave that serpent alone from henceforth; since *through that image it
happened that there were no serpents in the city*. Wherefore that column
remains to this day. And although, *in consequence of the lower jaw of
the brazen serpent being struck of', some serpents do come into the
city,* YET *they do no harm to any one* <span
id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_310.md)."

This traditionary legend, preserved by Leunclavius, marks the strong
hold which Ophiolatreia must have taken upon the minds of the people of
Constantinople, so as to cause this story to be handed down to so late
an æra as the seventeenth century. Among the Greeks who resorted to
Constantinople were many idolaters of the old religion, who would
wilfully transmit any legend favourable to their own superstition.
Hence, probably, the charm mentioned above, was attached by them to the
Delphic serpent on the column in the Hippodrome; and revived (after the
partial mutilation of the figure) by their descendants, the common

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

people, who are always the last in, every country to forget or forego an
ancient superstition. Among the common people of Constantinople, there
were always many more pagans than Christians at heart. With the
Christian religion, therefore, which they professed, would be mingled
many of the pagan traditions which were attached to the monuments of
antiquity that adorned Byzantium, or were imported into Constantinople.

There is another kind of serpentine tripod, which is supposed to have
belonged to Delphi, usually represented on medals. This is a vase
supported on three brazen legs, round one of which is twined a
serpent <span id="fr_312"></span>[1](#fn_311.md).

Lucian <span id="fr_313"></span>[2](#fn_312.md) says, that "*the dragon
under the tripod spoke* <span id="fr_314"></span>[3](#fn_313.md)." This
was, very probably, the

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

popular belief, founded originally upon the historical fact to which I
have so often alluded--the speaking of the serpent in Paradise with a
human voice; and the delusion was probably kept up by the ventriloquism
of the Pythian priestess, as she sat upon the tripod, over the serpent.

That THE SERPENT was the original god of Delphi, may be further argued
from the circumstance that *live serpents were kept in the adytum of the
temple* <span id="fr_315"></span>[1](#fn_314.md). A story is related by
Diogenes Laertius, lib. v. c. 91, of a Pythian priestess, who was
accidentally killed by treading upon one of these reptiles, which
immediately stung her.

At DELOS, the next place in rank after Del-phi for an oracle of Apollo,
there was an image erected to him "*in the shape of a dragon* <span
id="fr_316"></span>[2](#fn_315.md)." Here there was likewise an oracular
fountain, called Inopus. "This word," remarks Bryant <span
id="fr_317"></span>[3](#fn_316.md), is compounded of Ain-opus.; i.e. *Fons
Pythonis*:" dedicated to the serpent-god Oph. Fountains sacred to this
deity were not uncommon.

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Maundrel mentions a place in Palestine, called
"the serpent's fountain;" and there was a celebrated stream at Colophon,
in Ionia, which communicated prophetic inspiration to the priest of
Apollo, who presided over it. Colophon, is col-oph-on; that is, "*collis
serpentis solis* <span id="fr_318"></span>[1](#fn_317.md)."

In Pausanias (lib. ix. 557) we read of a fountain near the river Ismenus
at Thebes, which was placed under the guardianship of a *dragon*. Near
this place was the spot where Cadmus slew the dragon, from whose teeth
arose the Ophiogenes, the builders of Thebes. It is probable, therefore,
that instead of being sacred to *Mars*, as Pausanias affirms, this
fountain was sacred to *the serpent-god*, called *Mars* in this place,
because of the conflict between the Ophiogenes. A conclusion the more
probable from the fact, that the Ismenian hill was dedicated to Apollo.
The whole territory was (we may say) the patrimony of Oph--all the local
legends confirm it <span id="fr_319"></span>[2](#fn_318.md).

There were many other oracles of Apollo besides those of Delphi and
Delos, but of inferior

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

celebrity and various rites. It is remarkable, however, that the names
of several of these places involve the title AUB or AB, the designation
of the serpent-god. But not desiring to lay too much stress upon
etymology, I pass them by, as I have many other places involving a
similar evidence. I cannot, however, neglect a famous oracle which was
in connexion with Delphi, and bears many internal marks of Ophiolatreia.
This was the celebrated CAVE OF TROPHONIUS, in Phocis.

That this was a dracontic oracle will, I think, appear from the
following considerations. In the grove of Trophonius, near Lebadea in
Phocis, was a cave, in which were two figures, male and female, holding
in their hands secptres encircled by *serpents*. They were said to be
the images of Æsculapius and Hygeia; but Pausanias <span
id="fr_320"></span>[1](#fn_319.md) conjectures that they belonged rather to
Trophonius the god of the place, and Hercyna, the female who discovered
the cave; for he says, "*the serpent was not more sacred to Æsculapius
than to Trophonius*." Trophonius was an oracular god, and his attributes
and name indicate the solar serpent OPH. TROPHON is,

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

most probably, TOR-OPH-ON, *the temple of the solar serpent* <span
id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_320.md). The later Greeks, with their usual
mythological confusion of places and persons, conjectured the name of
the *temple* to be that of the *god*; and so converted "Tor-oph-on" into
"Trophonius."

In corroboration of these remarks, we find that one of the builders of
the temple of Apollo, at Delpi, was *Trophonius*.

Pausanias informs us, that whoever would inquire an oracle of
Trophonius, must previously (in a small temple *near his cave*,
dedicated to THE GOOD GENIUS) sacrifice to APOLLO, SATURN, JUPITER,
JUNO, and CERES. Now it is remarkable that each of these deities had
some connexion with the mythological serpent. APOLLO was pre-eminently
the solar serpent-god; and is, therefore, *first* to be appeased.
*Apollo* I take to be no other than OPEL, (Oph-el) PYTHO-SOL, whose name
occurs so frequently in composition with the names of places as
Torophel, Opheltin, &c. SATURN was married to OPS; under which disguise
is concealed the deity OPH. JUPITER changed himself into a serpent
twice, to deceive Rhea

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

and Proserpine. The serpent Python was an emissary of JUNO, to persecute
Latona, the mother of Apollo; and the car of CERES was drawn by
serpents. Serpents also entered into the Eleusinian mysteries as
symbolical of that goddess. Thus the history of each of these deities
was, more or less, connected with the mythological serpent--*the very
deity* whom the frequenters of this oracle would be called upon to
propitiate before they entered the cave, on the supposition that
TROPHONIUS was the OPHITE GOD.

But this is not all. In the cave of Trophonius LIVE SERPENTS were kept;
and those who entered it were obliged to appease them by CAKES--which we
know were offered to the sacred serpent at Athens, and were carried in
the mysterious baskets at the Bacchanalian orgies. They were, in fact,
*sacrifices* or *offerings* to these serpents, as objects of
WORSHIP.--Another proof that the serpents were the real gods of the
place, is found in the saying, that "no one ever came out of the cave of
Trophonius *smiling*"--and why? διὰ τὴν τῶν ὄφεων ἔκπληξιν--*because of
the* STUPOR *occasioned by the* 

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

*serpents* <span id="fr_322"></span>[1](#fn_321.md)! The same expression is
employed by Plutarch, in describing the effect produced by the
Bacchanalian serpents upon the spectators of the mysteries--ἐξέπληττον
τοὺς ἄνδρας <span id="fr_323"></span>[2](#fn_322.md):--which must mean that
they inspired the beholders with *religious awe*; for it can scarcely
mean "*frightened*," because he is speaking of the processions of
Olympias, at *Pella*, where serpents were so familiar that they lived in
the dwellings of the inhabitants, among their children <span
id="fr_324"></span>[3](#fn_323.md), and therefore could, under no ordinary
circumstances, become an object of terror. Hence it was, probably, a
*religious dread* which seized the spectators, both at the orgies of
Bacchus, and in the cave of Trophonius.

But we may approach even nearer to the deduction which I would draw;
namely, that the serpents in the cave were *the real gods of the place*,
by recollecting two fables which we have before considered: the
*stupefaction* and ultimate death of the priest who intruded upon the
privacy of the dragon of Metele; and the conversion

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

of the priestess of Minerva into stone, for her presumption in entering
into the presence of that goddess uncalled. These fables would prove
that an *affection of the senses* was believed to be the result always
attending upon a *sight of the local deity*.

The serpents were therefore, probably, the original objects of divine
worship in the cave of Trophonius.

The origin of the notion of an oracular God symbolized by a serpent, we
have frequently referred to the ambiguously prophetic conversation of
THE SERPENT with Eve in paradise. The consequent affection and
depravation of her mind, and that of her husband, are not obscurely
remembered in the ἔκπληξις is of the votaries of Trophonius.

4\. The worship of the serpent prevailed equally in the Peloponnesus.
*Peloponnesus* is said to have been so called from being the "island of
the Pelopidæ," descendants of PELOPS. The emigration of this
mythological hero from Phrygia, forms an interesting epoch in Grecian
story, and relates to the passage of the SACRED SERPENT from Canaan, the
land of his first resting-place

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

after the flood. PELOPS is P’-EL-OPS, *the serpent-god* <span
id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_324.md).

We have already seen that the Argives and Spartans were Ophites, and
that from the celebrated temple of Æsculapius, at Epidaurus, the sacred
serpent was conveyed to Sicyon. In addition to these facts, we learn
from Pausanias that Antinoe, the foundress of Mantinea, was guided to
that place by a serpent, from whom the river, which was near the town,
was called Ophis <span id="fr_326"></span>[2](#fn_325.md).

The first prophet of Messene was said to have been Ophioneus; from which
we may infer, that the first colony which introduced religious rites
into Messenia was Ophite. A similar colony was established at Epidaurus
Limera, in Laconia, under the auspices of a sacred serpent brought from
Epidaurus, in Argolis <span id="fr_327"></span>[3](#fn_326.md).

Statius <span id="fr_328"></span>[4](#fn_327.md) describes a serpent, the
object of religious reverence at Nemæa:--

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

Interea campis nemoris *sacer horror* Achæi,  
Terrigenæ erigitur *serpens*------

This is the serpent which slew the child Opheltes. Statius goes on to
describe him:

           Inachio *sanctum* dixere tonanti  
Agricolæ, *cui cura loci et sylvestribus aris*  
*Pauper honos*.

The "*pauper honos*" was occasioned by the drought then raging, when the
scene described by the poet took place. It was in search of food that
the serpent sallied from the sacred grove when he saw and slew the
sleeping child.

Bryant <span id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_328.md) assures us that Opheltes,
or rather *Opheltin*, is the name of a place, and not of any person: and
that this place was nothing more nor less than an inclosure sacred to
the god OPHEL, the serpent-solar deity. Hence the legend respecting the
serpent.

It will be shown in a subsequent chapter, that such inclosures were
frequently formed *in the shape of a serpent*. If such was the form of
"*Opheltin*," the fable explains itself. It means nothing more than that
*human victims* were immolated at this shrine of OPHEL.

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

5\. The islands of the Ægean sea were entirely overrun by Ophites. They
colonized Delos, Tenos, Cos, and Seriphus, in such numbers as to mark
their abode by traditions. The oracle of Delos we have ascertained to
have been Dracontian. Tenos was called *Ophiusa* <span
id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_329.md), as also Cythnus. A coin of Cos presents
the figure of a serpent, with the word ΣΩΤΗΡ inscribed. The same figure
and inscription appear on the coins of Epidaurus <span
id="fr_331"></span>[2](#fn_330.md): and we find that there was a temple of
Æsculapius at Cos <span id="fr_332"></span>[3](#fn_331.md). *Seriphus* is,
according to Bryant, *Sar-Iph* (*petra Pythons*,) "the serpent's rock."
Here was a legend of Perseus bringing Medusa's head, and turning the
inhabitants into stone <span id="fr_333"></span>[4](#fn_332.md). The island
was called *Saxum Seriphium* by the Romans; and by Virgil,
"*serpentifera*." Natural ruggedness is not peculiar to Seriphus; it
seems to be characteristic of the greater number of the Grecian islands;
and therefore, connecting the epithet "*serpentifera*" with the legend
respecting Perseus, we may reasonably infer that a colony of Ophites
were once settled in Seriphus, and had

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

a temple there of the *dracontic kind*, whose upright columns of stone
may have given rise to the tradition that the inhabitants of the island
were petrified by the *talismanic serpents* <span
id="fr_334"></span>[1](#fn_333.md) of Perseus. Such a tradition was not
unfrequently attached to these Ophite temples. Stonehenge was thus
called "*Chorea Gigantum*;" and a Druids' circle in Cumberland, "*Long
Meg and her Daughters*," from a belief that the giants and the fairies
were respectively metamorphosed into stone, in the mazes of a dance.

Of all the islands in the neighbourhood of the' Peloponnesus, Crete was
most celebrated for its primitive Ophiolatreia. Here the Egyptians first
established those religious rites which were called by the Greeks the
mysteries of Dionusus or Bacchus. The Cretan medals were usually
impressed with the Bacchic basket, and the sacred serpent creeping in
and out. Beger has written a treatise on these coins: the following is a
description of three which he has engraved.

1\. A Bacchic basket, with the sacred serpent. On the reverse, two
serpents with their tails

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

intertwined, on each side of a *quiver*--for the Cretans were famous
archers.

2\. The Bacchic basket and serpent. On the reverse *a temple between two
serpents*. In the middle of the temple, a lighted altar.

3\. The Cretan Jupiter between two serpents.

The inhabitants of Crete are also said to have worshipped the Pythian
Apollo. They had a *Pythium*; and the inhabitants were called
*Pythians* <span id="fr_335"></span>[1](#fn_334.md).

6\. We see, then, that serpent-worship very generally prevailed through
Greece and its dependencies. Memorials of it have been preserved in many
coins and medals, and pieces of ancient sculpture; and the only reason
why we have not more records of this superstition is, that it was
superseded by the fascination of the Polytheistic idolatry, which
overwhelmed with a multitude of sculptured gods and goddesses the
traditionary remains of the original religion.

There are, however, some few reliques of sculpture which bear
interesting testimony to the worship of the serpent. Engravings of three

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

are preserved by Fabretti <span id="fr_336"></span>[1](#fn_335.md), which
are worthy of attention.

No. 1 represents a TREE encircled by a SERPENT; an altar appears in
front, and a boy on horseback is seen approaching it. The inscription
states this to be a monument dedicated by Glycon to his infant son
Euhemerus.

No. 2, an equestrian approaching an altar at the foot of a TREE, about
the branches of which a SERPENT is entwined. A priestess stands by the
altar.

No. 3. In the centre is a TREE with a SERPENT enfolding it. To the right
of the tree is a naked female, holding in her hand a chalice under the
serpent's mouth, and near her a man in the attitude of supplication to
the serpent. On the left is Charon leading Cerberus towards the tree.

These are perhaps funeral monuments, and the serpent emblematic of the
MANES of the departed, as Montfaucon would lead us to believe. But the
third sculpture (in spite of Charon) seems rather to allude to the
annual custom at Epirus of soliciting the sacred serpent for a good
harvest. The narrative is in

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ælian, Hist. Anim. lib. xi. 2, by which we learn
that the husbandmen of the country proceeded annually to the temple
where live serpents were kept, and *approached by naked priestesses*. If
the serpent received the proffered food, the omen was a good one, and
*vice versâ*.

7\. Under the head of Ophiolatreia in Greece," we may class
Ophiomancy--*divination by serpents*. This superstition was sometimes
resorted to by the Greeks, but was more common among the Romans: both of
them borrowed it from earlier nations. For, the same word in Hebrew,
Arabic, and Greek, which denotes "*divination*," denotes "*a serpent*."
"Nachash"--"alahat <span
id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_336.md)"--οἰωνίζεσθαι--have the same double
significations. The Greek word, according to Hesychius, is derived from
οἰωνὸς, a snake; "because they divined by means of a snake, which they
called οἰωνός."

This is a coincidence which implies that *Ophiomancy* was the *first*
species of divination: as it ought to have been, since Ophiolatreia was
the first species of idolatry.

A remarkable instance of Grecian Ophiomancy occurs in the divination of
Calchas at Aulis in

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Bœotia, before the confederate chiefs sailed for
the siege of Troy.

While the chieftains were assembled under a tree, having sacrificed a
hecatomb to the gods for the success of their enterprise, on a sudden a
great sign--μέγα σῆμα--appeared. A serpent gliding from the base of an
altar ascended the tree, and devouring a sparrow and her eight young
ones, came down again, and was converted into stone <span
id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_337.md). The omen was interpreted to mean a nine
years' continuance of the war, and victory in the tenth.

In mentioning this anecdote we may remark, that the scene of the
transaction was in Bœotia, one of the most celebrated *loci* of
Ophiolatreia; and that Calchas, the soothsayer, acquired the gift of
divination from APOLLO, or in other words, was a priest of the Ophite
god.

 

II\. EPIRUS.--l. Following the Ophites from Greece into Epirus, we find
that their traces, though few, are decisive. In this country, we are
informed by Ælian <span id="fr_339"></span>[2](#fn_338.md), there was a
circular grove of Apollo enclosed within a wall, where *sacred serpents*
were kept. At the great annual

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

festival, the virgin priestess approached them naked, holding in her
hand the consecrated food. If they took it readily, it was deemed an
augury of a fruitful harvest, and healthy year; if not, the contrary
omen dismissed the anxious expectants in despondence. These serpents
were said to be descended from the Python of Delphi,--a tradition which
amounts to positive proof that the original religion of Delphi was
Ophiolatreia.

2\. From Epirus the superstition passed into Illyria. It was at Encheliæ
that Cadmus and his wife were changed into serpents. A temple was
erected to them in commemoration of this event; the probable form and
dedication of which will be considered in the chapter on Ophite Temples.

Cadmus, who was the author of Ophiolatreia in Bœotia, Epirus, and
Illyria, from having been the promoter, became the object of this
idolatry. Like Thoth in Egypt, he was deified after death as the
serpent-god, whose worship he had been so zealous to establish.

3\. The superstition so generally received in Greece, passed rapidly
into Macedonia, where the inhabitants of Pella became its chief
votaries.

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Of them <span id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_339.md),
it is said that they kept domestic serpents, which were brought up among
their children, and frequently nursed together with them, by the
Macedonian mothers. The coins of Pella bore the impress of a
serpent <span id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_340.md).

The idea of *divine incarnation* in a serpent must have appeared
reasonable in that country to enable Olympias to invent the story of her
son Alexander's dracontic origin. The queen was extravagantly fond of
the Bacchanalian mysteries, at which she officiated in the character of
a Bacchans. It is said by Plutarch <span
id="fr_342"></span>[3](#fn_341.md), that she and her husband were initiated
into them at Samothrace, when very young; and that she imitated the
frantic gestures of the Edonian women in traversing the wilds of Mount
Hæmus. When Olympias celebrated the orgies of Dionusus, attendants
followed her, carrying Thyrsi encircled with serpents, having serpents
also in their hair and chaplets.

4\. The island of Samothrace was the Holy Isle of the ancients, and
celebrated for the worship of the CABIRI, the most mysterious and awful
of all the gods, whose name, even, it was

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

unlawful to pronounce lightly. The word "cabiri" is said to mean "the
mighty ones." If it mean no more we may as vainly seek to penetrate into
their hallowed abode for the illustration of our subject as the
awe-struck Greeks themselves; but while probability opens a road to
conjecture, we may be allowed to hazard one for its elucidation.

"CABIRI" is, evidently a noun in the plural number, of which the
singular is to be found in "CABIR."

Now CABIR is probably a compound word, whose component parts may be
CA-AB-IR. If so, the interpretation is easy, CA-AB-IR resolving itself
at once into CA or CHA, *domus* <span id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_342.md);
AB or AUB, *Pythonis*; IR or UR, *Lucis vel Solis*. "CABIR" will
therefore mean "*the temple of the serpent of the sun* <span
id="fr_344"></span>[2](#fn_343.md);" and "CABIRI" will bear the same
signification, either as denoting more than one such temple, or a temple
dedicated to two deities, AUB and the SUN.

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

Of the same kind I take to have been the CAABA of Mecca, which should be
written CAABIR. Here we find the chief object of idolatry to have been a
*conical stone*, which we know was an emblem of the solar god, being the
image of a sun's ray. Another temple of this dedication was at Abury in
Wiltshire, whose name, "Abury," is evidently "Abiri," or "Ab-ir,"
expressed in the plural number; the only difference <span
id="fr_345"></span>[1](#fn_344.md) being, that in the name of this place
the adjunct "ca" signifying "the temple," was dropped, and the names of
the deity alone retained--ABIR, *quasi*, "SERPENS SOLIS." This temple we
shall see hereafter was formed IN THE SHAPE OF A SERPENT. The
substitution of *gods* for *temples* was of common occurrence in
mythology, as we have seen in the case of Trophonius, where the TOR (or
temple) of OPHON was changed into TROPHONIUS (the god.) It is not
surprising, therefore, that "caabir," *the temple of Abir*, should be
changed into "Cabir," the *god*: and by natural consequence, "Cabiri"
would imply a plurality of gods of the same name.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

The above conjecture, founded primarily upon etymology, is corroborated
by FACTS.

Olympias, we have been informed by Plutarch, was initiated into the
mysteries of *Dionusus* at Samothrace. Now *Dionusus*, the Orphic
Bacchus, was symbolized by a *serpent*. This alone would be sufficient
to support our conjecture on the etymology of "Cabiri." But we learn
further, that the Orphic CURES, *the chief of the* CABIRI, assumed *a
dracontic form*; and that the Orphic CRONUS and HERCULES are also
described either as compounded of a man, a lion, and *a serpent*; or,
simply, as *a winding snake* <span id="fr_346"></span>[1](#fn_345.md). It
was a common opinion among the Greeks that *Ceres*, *Proserpine*, and
*Bacchus* were the Cabiri. To each of these deities, it is to be
observed, the serpent was sacred, and formed a prominent feature in
their mysteries.

I leave, therefore, to the candid consideration of the reader, the
probability of the derivation which has been assigned to the word
"*Cabiri*."

Between the religion of Samothrace and that of the Thracian continent,
there was a strong similarity, or rather union. The great prophet of
this common religion was Orpheus, who resided

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

chiefly at Thrace, and was to that country what Thoth was to Egypt, and
Cadmus to Greece,--the promoter of Ophiolatreia: but it was Ophiolatreia
in conjunction with the solar idolatry. It seems that the original
worship of the serpent had been already corrupted by the adoption of the
mysteries of Dionusus. Thus Dionysopolis was "the city of Dionusus;" and
consequently we find *a coiled serpent* impressed upon its coins. The
same appeared on the medals of Pantalia, another city in Thrace; upon
which Spanheim remarks, "Istud vero ex iis nummis colligas, in
Macedoniâ, *Thraciâ*, Paphlagoniâ, Ponto, Bithyniâ, Ciliciâ, et vicinis
regionibus, haud alios *locorum genios et custodes* gratiores, id genus
draconibus extitisse <span id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_346.md)."

The priestesses of the superstition of Dionusus were no longer
*Pythonesses* or *Oubs*, but *Bacchantes*: and many other innovations
mark the decline of Ophiolatreia before Orpheus succeeded (but in
succeeding lost his life) in uniting it to the sun-worship.

 

III\. ITALY.--We come now to the traces of Ophiolatreia in Italy.

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

In this country the principal colony of Ophites settled in Campania, and
were called Opici or Ophici, from the object of their idolatry, Ὀφικοὶ
ἀπὸ τῶν ὄφεων, say Stephanus Byzantinus <span
id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_347.md). The same people were called *Pitanatæ*,
as testified by Strabo <span id="fr_349"></span>[2](#fn_348.md).
"*Pitanatæ*," remarks Bryant, "is a term of the same import as *Opici*,
and relates to the votaries of *Pitan*, the serpent-deity, which was
adored by the people. Menelaus was, of old, styled *Pitanates*, as we
learn from Hesychius; and the reason of it may be known from his being a
Spartan, by which was intimated one of the *Serpentigentæ*, or Ophites.
Hence he was represented with *a serpent* on his shield <span
id="fr_350"></span>[3](#fn_349.md)." This word *Pitan* is derived from the
same root as *Python*: namely, the Hebrew פתן *serpens*, vel, *aspis*.

Many representations of warriors with the serpent on their shields, may
be seen on the Etruscan vases, discovered on the estate of Canino in
Etruria, which is supposed to have been the ancient Vitulonia <span
id="fr_351"></span>[4](#fn_350.md).

Jerome Colonna attributes the name of Opici to the people of Campania,
from a former king

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

bearing upon his standard the figure of a serpent <span
id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_351.md). But this would be the necessary
con-sequence of his being an Ophite; for the military ensigns of most
ancient nations were usually the images of the gods whom they
worshipped. Thus a brigade of infantry among the Greeks was called
πιτανάτης <span id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_352.md); and the Romans, in the
age of Marcus Aurelius, had a *dragon* standard at the head of each
cohort, ten in every legion. The legion marched under *the eagle* <span
id="fr_354"></span>[3](#fn_353.md). These dragons were not woven upon any
fabric of cloth, but were real *images* carried on poles <span
id="fr_355"></span>[4](#fn_354.md). Some say (as *Casaubon not. in Vopis.
Hist. Aug.* 231.) that the Romans borrowed the dragon standard from the
Parthians: but their vicinity to the Opici of Campania may perhaps
suggest a more probable origin. The use of them by the Parthians may
have induced the emperor Aurelius to extend them in his own army; but
this extension was perhaps rather a revival than an introduction of the
dragon ensign. They are

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

mentioned by Claudian in his Epithalamium of Honorius and Maria, v. 193.

Stent bellatrices aquilæ, sævique *dracones*.

He mentions them again in his panegyric on Ruffinus and Honorius. Some
of his lines are highly pictorial; such as:

Surgere purpureis undantes *anguibus* hastas,  
*Serpentumque* vago cœlum sævire volatu.  
                                        Ruff. lib. ii.

-------------------------hi picta *draconum*  
Colla levant, multusque tumet per nubila *serpens*,  
Iratus, stimulante noto, vivitque receptis  
Flatibus, et vario mentitur sibula tractu.  
                                                 Ibid.

Prudentius and Sidonius Apollinaris also mention them.

The bearers of these standards were called *draconarii*; and it is not
improbable that hence might have been derived our own expression of
"dragoons," to designate a certain description of cavalry, though the
original meaning of the word is altogether lost. This word we have
borrowed from the French, who received it probably from the Romans.

From Campania the Ophites passed into Latium,

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

and established the chief seat of their religion at Lanuvium. The medals
of this city bore the figure of a dragon or a large serpent; which,
according to Spanheim, would denote that this animal represented the
tutelary god of the place: an opinion which is proved correct by the
following extracts from Ælian <span id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_355.md) and
Propertius. From the former we learn, that at Lanuvium is a large and
dark grove, and near it a temple of the Argive Juno. In the same place
is a large deep cave, the den of a *great serpent*. To this grove the
virgins of Latium are taken annually to ascertain their chastity, which
is indicated by the dragon." Propertius, describing this annual custom
speaks thus:

Disce quid Esquilias hac nocte fugavit aquosas,  
   Cum vicina novis turba cucurrit agris.  
Lanuvium annosi vetus est tutela draconis;  
   Hic ubi tam rarer non perit hora moræ,  
Qua sacer abripitur cæco descensus hiatu,  
   Qua penetral, (virgo, tale iter omne cave!)  
Jejuni serpentis honos, cum pabula poscit  
   Annua, et ex ima sibila torquet humo.  
Talia demissæ pallent ad sacra puellæ:  
   Cum tenera anguino traditur ore manus. <span id="page_240">p.
240</span>  
Ille sibi admotas a virgine corripit escas;  
   Virginis in palmis ipsa canistra tremunt.  
Si fuerint castæ, redeunt in colla parentum,  
   Clamantque agricolæ "fertilis annus erit <span
id="fr_357"></span>[1](#fn_356.md)!"

\[paragraph continues\] There is great similarity between the above
scene, and that mentioned in a former part of this chapter, as taking
place annually in Epirus; and there can be no doubt that they belonged
to the same superstition.

The Ophites who settled in Campania and Lanuvium, left a colony also in
Crotona, and at Lilybæum in Sicily: for both these places were
remarkable for the dracontic medal, which generally denoted the
consecration of a city to the serpent-god <span
id="fr_358"></span>[2](#fn_357.md).

The Marsi who settled at the lake Fucinus are said by Virgil, Æn. vii.
750. to have been "charmers of serpents," which is tantamount to calling
them Ophites.

Montfaucon <span id="fr_359"></span>[3](#fn_358.md) has an engraving from a
silver medal of Lepidus, on which is a tripod:--"A serpent of vast
length raises itself over the vase, twisting his body into a great many
folds and

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

knots . . . . . . . The serpent's head *darts rays*; which seems to show
that this part of the Egyptian Theology (relating to the solar serpent)
had spread itself among the Romans; and that they represented the sun by
a serpent."

Ophiomancy prevailed among the Romans, when Ophiolatreia had decreased
through the influence of time and civilization. The accidental sight of
a serpent was sometimes esteemed a good <span
id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_359.md), and sometimes a bad omen. The death of
Tiberius Gracchus was denoted by a serpent found in his house <span
id="fr_361"></span>[2](#fn_360.md). Sylla was more fortunate in his
divination from a serpent which glided from beneath an altar, while he
was sacrificing at Nola: as also was Roscius, whose future successful
career was foretold, from his being found, when an infant, sleeping in
his cradle, enfolded by a snake. In each of these cases Haruspices were
sent for, who interpreted the omen.

A serpent was accounted among the *pedestria auspicia*, and is alluded
to by Horace, lib. iii.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

ode 27; who seems to consider it a sinister omen:--

Rumpat et serpens iter institutum,  
Si per obliquum, similis sagittæ,  
       Terruit Mannos.

Terence <span id="fr_362"></span>[1](#fn_361.md) also considers it in the
same light--

Monstra evenerunt mihi:  
Introit in ædes ater alienus canis,  
Anguis per impluvium decidit de tegulis.

The Sardinians also, as we are informed by De Lacepede, domesticated the
serpent, as an animal of auspicious omen. This notion may have reached
them either from Italy or Africa.

 

IV\. NORTHERN EUROPE.--The Romans being, comparatively, a modern people,
had not among them those strong traces of Ophiolatreia which we have
observed in Phœnicia, Egypt, and Greece. But if we now follow the
northward march of the sacred serpent from the plains of Shinar, we
shall find that he entered deeply into the mythology of the tribes who
penetrated into Europe through the Oural mountains. Of these, the
Sarmatian horde, as being nearest to the seat of their original
habitation, first claims attention.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

An unlettered race of wandering barbarians cannot be expected to have
preserved many records of their ancient religion; but to the
enterprising missionaries of the Christian faith we are indebted for
sufficient notices to assure us that THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT was
their primitive idolatry. To this conclusion we are, indeed, led by the
few fragments of tradition in the classical writers who have noticed the
religion of the remote Hyperboreans. These people were devoted to the
solar superstition <span id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_362.md), of which the
most ancient and most general symbol was the serpent. We may therefore
expect to find traces of the pure serpent-worship, also, in their
religion. They had a priestess called *Opis*, who came with another
priestess (*Argis*) to Delos, bringing offerings to Lucina, in gratitude
for the safe delivery of some distinguished females of their own
country <span id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_363.md). These, according to
Faber <span id="fr_365"></span>[3](#fn_364.md), were priestesses of OPH and
ARG (the deified personification of the ARK.) Bryant <span
id="fr_366"></span>[4](#fn_365.md) also cites a line from Callimachus,

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

which gives the name of three priestesses of the Hyperboreans, two of
whom are *Oupis* and *Evaion*. The latter word he decomposes into
*eva-on*, *serpens sol*. So that they were representatives of the two
superstitions--the simple and primitive serpent-worship, and the worship
of the solar serpent. Other obscure, though not altogether uncertain,
notices are to be found in Diodorus Siculus, Hecateus, &c. which lead to
the conclusion that the Ophite religion was once prevalent in the north
of Europe <span id="fr_367"></span>[2](#fn_367.md). These inferences are
corroborated by indisputable facts of modern discovery, which I now
proceed to detail.

1\. SARMATIA. From Ouzel <span id="fr_368"></span>[1](#fn_366.md) we learn
that the serpent was one of the earliest objects of worship in Sarmatia.
He cites Erasmus Stella *de Antiq. Borussiæ*. "For some time," says this
author, "they had no sacred rites; at length they arrived at such a
pitch of wickedness, that they worshipped *serpents and trees*." The
connexion between *serpents* and *trees* we have had occasion to notice
more than once. They

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

are united on the sepulchral monuments of the Greeks and Romans, on the
coins of Tyre, and among the Fetiches of Whidah. We shall find them, in
the same union, pervading the religion of the Hyperboreans of every
description, the superstition of the Scandinavians, and the worship of
the Druids. They are closely connected in the mythology of the Heathens
of almost every nation: and the question is not unnatural--"whence arose
this union?" The coincidences are too remarkable to be unmeaning; and I
have no hesitation in affirming my belief that THE PARADISIACAL SERPENT,
and THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE, are the prototypes of the idolatry.

The Samogitæ (Muscovites) partook of the same superstition <span
id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_368.md). They worshipped the serpent as A GOD;
and if any adversity befell them, concluded that their *domestic
serpents* (which, like the people of Pella, they kept in their houses,)
had been negligently served.

From Muscovy we may follow the same superstition into Lithuania, the
modern Poland. These people, we are informed by Guaguin <span
id="fr_370"></span>[2](#fn_369.md),

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "believed *vipers and serpents to be gods*, and
worshipped them with great veneration. Every householder, whether
citizen, husbandman, or noble, kept a serpent in his house, as a
house-hold god: and it was deemed so deadly an offence to injure or
dishonour these serpents, that they either deprived of property or of
life every one who was guilty of such a crime."

In Koch (*De cultu Serpentum*, p. 39: a valuable, though short and
superficial treatise,) we read the following passage: That these
wretched idolaters offered sacrifices to serpents, Jerome of Prague
(*teste Sylvio de Europâ*, c. 26.) saw with his own eyes . . . . . .
Every householder had a snake in a corner of his house, to which he gave
food and offered sacrifice, as he lay upon the hay. Jerome commanded all
these to be killed, and publicly burnt. Among such as were brought out
for this purpose, one was found larger than the rest, which, though
often thrown into the fire, could not be consumed."

The serpent-worship of the Lithuanians is also noticed by Cromer <span
id="fr_371"></span>[1](#fn_370.md) who charges the Prussians likewise with
the same idolatry. Guaguin relates an anecdote of a serpent worshipper

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

of Lithuania, who was persuaded to destroy his domestic god; and
subsequently losing all his bees, (by whose labour he subsisted,)
attributed the calamity to his apostacy, and relapsed into his former
superstition. The scene of this anecdote was a village near Troki, six
miles from Vilna; upon which Masius <span
id="fr_372"></span>[1](#fn_371.md) remarks, "Est quatuor a Vilna
miliaribus, Lavariski, villa regia; *in quâ a multis* ADHUC *serpentes
coluntur*."

The Lithuanians were the last of the Europeans who were converted to
Christianity; an event which did not take place until the fourteenth
century. Jagello, the last heathen duke, was baptized anno 1386 <span
id="fr_373"></span>[2](#fn_372.md).

The inhabitants of Livonia were also addicted to this gross idolatry,
and carried it to a barbarous length. It is said that they were
accustomed to sacrifice the most beautiful of their captives to their
dragon-gods <span id="fr_374"></span>[3](#fn_373.md). The same custom we
have observed to exist at Whidah.

2\. SCANDINAVIA. The second great northern

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

family of Europe, was the Scandinavian, inhabiting the country now
occupied by the Laplanders, Fins, Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes. To
these were allied the Vandals and Lombards, not only by ties of
consanguinity but religion. These were well addicted to the worship of
the serpent; and some of them retained in their traditionary mythology,
traces, not obscure, of the fall of man.

We are informed by Olaus Magnus <span id="fr_375"></span>[1](#fn_374.md),
that domestic serpents were considered as *penates* in the extreme parts
of the north of Europe; and that they were fed on cows' milk, or that of
sheep, together with the children. They played freely in the houses, and
it was an offence of the first magnitude to hurt them.

Among the Ophites of the north, the most conspicuous were the Danes, who
exhibited the sacred dragon upon their royal standard. Pontanus <span
id="fr_376"></span>[2](#fn_375.md) alluding to it, expresses himself
thus:--

Hinc rigidos Sclavos effert pernicibus alis,  
   Et loco propugnat sanguinolenta DRACO.

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

The dragon standard of the Danes was carried by their piratical
brethren, the Normans, into France; and was for many years the ensign of
the Dukes of Normandy. Du Fresne cites a charter granted to one of the
family of Bertran, to bear "the dragon standard."

But this custom, so commonly observed by the Ophites, would not have
pre-eminently distinguished the Danes as worshippers of the sacred
serpent, had there not been discovered a sacrificial vessel of their
primitive idolatry, which is at once a confirmation of their
superstition, and a key to its mysteries. It is, indeed, a most valuable
interpreter of the Celtic faith, as it respected the tradition of the
fall of man, and an eloquent index to the religion of the Druids.

This relic of idolatry is the celebrated horn found by a female peasant,
near Tundera <span id="fr_377"></span>[1](#fn_376.md), in Denmark, in the
year, 1639. It is of gold, and embossed in parallel circles, of rude
workmanship. These circular compartments are seven in number, and in
five out of the seven circles, the figure of a serpent is seen in
various attitudes.

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

Circle 1 represents a naked boy or woman kneeling. The extended arms are
held up to heaven. On each side of this figure is a large serpent in the
attitude of attack.

In the second compartment of this circle, the same naked figure appears
flying from a serpent which pursues. The third compartment represents
the serpent with his face averted from the figure, who holds up both
hands, as if in gratitude for deliverance.

Circle 2 exhibits a naked boy or woman (for the figure has no beard)
seated upon the ground, with the hands brought together, *as if in the
action of prayer to a serpent*. Another serpent is coiled behind the
figure, with his head and the upper part of his body erect. The next
compartment of this circle contains the same human figure *in
conversation* with the serpent.

The serpent appears in three others of the seven circles, but not in so
historical a form. In these it is probably a representation of the
constellation Draco, for some of the remaining figures seem to belong to
the zodiac.

It may be rash to conjecture that the first two circles allude to the
history of man in paradise, *persecuted by the serpent*, and saved

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

from his *extreme* violence: but, nevertheless, the compartment which
describes the human figure *in conversation* with its dracontic enemy,
seems to point to this event.

Koch considers the hieroglyphics as explanatory of the ancient practice
of the country, which devoted human victims to serpent-gods. "Nos exinde
conjecimus, a tenerâ ætate infantes serpentibus vovisse, superstitiosos
veteres <span id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_377.md)." Olaus Wormius is of
opinion that *the serpent* referred to the serpent-tempter and
destroyer.

But whichever be correct, (and for our theory it matters not *which*,)
it is evident that the figures have a sacred signification, either as
connected with the religious rites, superstitions, or fables of the
original possessors.

Now we know, from unquestionable authority, that not only did
Ophiolatreia prevail throughout the whole of this and the neighbouring
countries, but also that the tradition of the serpent in paradise was
preserved in the mythology of Scandinavia, with an accuracy equal to
that of the Greeks and Phœnicians. Hence it matters not, whether THE
HORN be descriptive of the fall of man, of the Ophite rites of the

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Scandinavians, or simply of the zodiac, as
delineated by the northern astronomers. For the astronomical mythology
which relates to the serpent or dragon, was entirely borrowed from the
events in Paradise, to which also may be referred the whole of the
Ophite worship.

The Vandals worshipped their principal deity under the form of a *flying
dragon*; and, like the rest of their northern brethren, kept domestic
serpents. It is said that their women also kept snakes in hollow oaks,
to whom they made offerings of milk <span
id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_378.md), and whom they adored with the most
abject humility. They prayed to them for blessings, for the health of
their husbands, and family, &c. <span
id="fr_380"></span>[2](#fn_379.md)--in a word, adored them as gods.

The Lombards also cherished the same superstition,

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

for they carried it with their victorious arms into Italy. When Barbatus
lived at Benevento, A.D. 688, he discovered that some of the
inhabitants, who were Lombards, *worshipped a golden viper* and a
*tree*, on which the skin of a wild beast was hung." He suppressed this
idolatry, and being made Bishop of Benevento, cut down the tree, and
melted the golden viper for a sacramental chalice <span
id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_381.md).

 

V. WESTERN EUROPE.

1\. BRITAIN. Our British ancestors, under the tuition of the venerable
Druids, were not only worshippers of the solar deity, symbolized by the
serpent, but held the serpent, independent of his relation to the sun,
in peculiar veneration. Cut off from all intimate intercourse with the
civilized world, partly by their remoteness <span
id="fr_383"></span>[2](#fn_382.md), and partly by their national
character <span id="fr_384"></span>[3](#fn_383.md), the Britons retained
their primitive idolatry long after it had yielded in the neighbouring
countries to the polytheistic corruptions of Greece and Egypt. In
process of time, however, the

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

gods of the Gaulish Druids penetrated into the sacred mythology of the
British, and furnished personifications for the different attributes of
the dracontic god HU. This deity was called "THE DRAGON RULER OF THE
WORLD <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_384.md)," and his car was drawn by
SERPENTS <span id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_385.md). His priests, in
accommodation with the general custom of the ministers of the Ophite
god, were called after him, ADDERS <span
id="fr_387"></span>[3](#fn_386.md).

In a poem of Taliessin, translated by Davies, in his Appendix, No. 6, is
the following enumeration of a Druid's titles:

"I am a Druid; I am an architect; I am a prophet;  
I am a SERPENT"--(*Gnadr*.)

From the word *Gnadr* is derived "adder," the name of a species of
snake. *Gnadr* was probably pronounced like "*adder*" with a nasal
aspirate.

The mythology of the Druids contained also a goddess CERIDWEN, whose car
was drawn by serpents. It is conjectured that this was Grecian CERES;
and not without reason, for the in-creasing intercourse between the
British and

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Gaulish Druids introduced into the purer
religion of the former many of the corruptions ingrafted upon that of
the latter by the Greeks and Romans. The Druids of Gaul had among them
many divinities corresponding with those of Greece and Rome. They
worshipped OGMIUS, (a compound deity between Hercules and Mercury,) and,
after him, *Apollo*, *Mars*, *Jupiter*, and *Minerva*, or deities
resembling them <span id="fr_388"></span>[1](#fn_387.md). Of these they
made images; whereas hitherto the only image in the British worship was
the great wicker idol, into which they thrust HUMAN VICTIMS designed to
be burnt as AN EXPIATORY SACRIFICE for the sins of some chieftain. The
wicker idol, though formed in the shape of a man, was perhaps rather a
sacrificial ornament than a god; emblematic of the nature of the victims
within it. The whole sacrifice was but an ignorant expression of the
primeval and universal faith in the ATONEMENT.

The following translation of a Bardic poem, descriptive of one of their
religious rites, identifies the superstition of the British Druids with
the aboriginal Ophiolatreia, as expressed in the mysteries of Isis in
Egypt. The poem is entitled,

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "The Elegy of Uther Pendragon;" that is, of
Uther, "The Dragon's Head;" and it is not a little remarkable that the
word "Draig" in the British language, signifies, at the same time, "*a
fiery serpent*, *a dragon*, and THE SUPREME GOD <span
id="fr_389"></span>[1](#fn_388.md)."

In the second part of this poem is the following description of the
sacrificial rites of Uther Pendragon.

With solemn festivity round the two lakes;  
With the lake next my side;  
With my side moving round the sanctuary;  
While the sanctuary is earnestly invoking  
THE GLIDING KING, before whom the FAIR ONE  
Retreats, upon the veil that covers the huge stones;  
Whilst THE DRAGON *moves round over*  
*The places which contain vessels*  
*Of drink offering*:  
Whilst the drink offering is in THE GOLDEN HORNS;  
Whilst the golden horns are in the hand;  
Whilst the knife is upon the chief victim;  
Sincerely I implore thee, O victorious BELI, &c. &c.

This is a most minute and interesting account of the religious rites of
the Druids, proving in clear terms their addiction to Ophiolatreia:

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

we have not only the history of "THE GLIDING KING," *who pursues* "THE
FAIR ONE," depicted upon "the veil which covers the huge stones"--a
history which reminds us most forcibly of the events in Paradise, under
a poetic garb; but we have, likewise, beneath that veil, within the
sacred circle of "the huge stones," THE GREAT DRAGON, A LIVING SERPENT,
"moving round the places which contain the vessels of drink-offering;"
or, in other words, moving round the altar stone, in the same manner as
the serpent in the Isiac mysteries passed about the sacred vessels
containing the offerings:

"Pigraque labatur circa donaria serpens <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_389.md)."

The GOLDEN HORNS, which contained the drink offerings, were very
probably of the same kind as that found in Tundera, in Denmark, and
described in a preceding page of this chapter: *a probability which
confirms the Ophiolatreia* of the DANES, argued in the same section from
historical documents. And conversely, the existence of the Danish horn
proves that in the mysteries of Druidical worship, the serpent was a
prominent character.

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

If we refer to the description of the horn of Tundera <span
id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_390.md) we shall find upon it precisely the same
impressed history which was pictured "upon the veil that covered the
huge stones." The dragon, "the gliding king," is seen in the same
attitude of pursuing a naked figure, which might be mistaken, from the
rude workmanship of the horn, for a *boy*; but which is proved by the
Bardic poem, above cited, to be a female; "the fair one," as she is, by
a figure of poetry, designated.

The god to whom these offerings were made and whose sacrifices were here
celebrated, was BELL; perhaps the BEL of the Babylonians, and the OBEL
of primitive worship; the architype

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

of APOLLO in the name and rites. To BEL, the Babylonians consecrated, as
we have seen, *a living serpent*; and *living serpents* were also
preserved in the Fane of Delphi, and in many other places where the
deity OPH or OB was worshipped. The fabulous hero himself, in whose
honour these sacrifices are celebrated, was distinguished by the title
of "The Wonderful Dragon." Every circumstance, therefore, combines to
strengthen the conclusion, that the Druids thus engaged were OPHITES of
the original stock.

The learned Celtic scholar, from whose translation the above poem is
taken, explains it in these words:--"These ceremonies are performed at a
public and solemn festival, whilst the sanctuary, or assembly of priests
and votaries, invoke the dragon king. The place of consecration is on
the sacred mound, within the stone circle and mount which represent the
world, and near the consecrated lakes <span
id="fr_393"></span>[1](#fn_392.md). At this time

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

the huge stones of the temple were covered with a veil, on which was
delineated the history of the dragon king. There seems also to have been
*a living serpent as a symbol of the god*, who is gliding from place to
place, and tasting the drink-offerings in the sacred vessels <span
id="fr_394"></span>[1](#fn_393.md)."

The sanctity of the serpent showed itself in another very curious part
of the superstition of the British Druids, namely, in that which related
to the formation and virtues of the celebrated *anguinum*, as it is
called by Pliny, or *gleinen nadroeth*, that is, *snake-stones*, as they
were called by the Britons. Sir Richard Colt Hoare

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

gives an engraving of one in his "Modern Wiltshire, Hundred of
Amesbury," p. 56. "This is a [bead](errata.htm#1.md) of imperfect
vitrification, representing two circular lines of opaque skyblue and
white, which seem to represent a snake twined round a centre which is
perforated." Many beads of this kind have been found in various parts of
the island of Great Britain. Mr. Lhwyd, the celebrated Welsh antiquary,
thus describes them in a letter to Ralph Thoresby:--"I am fully
satisfied that they were amulets of the Druids. . . . . . . I have seen
one of them that had nine small snakes upon it. . . . . . . . There are
others that have one or two or more snakes <span
id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_394.md)."

These, we are informed by the Roman naturalist, were worn about the neck
as charms, and were deemed efficacious in rendering their possessors
fortunate in every difficult emergency. He records an anecdote of a
Roman knight, who was put to death by Claudius for entering a court of
justice with an anguinum on his neck, in the belief that its virtue
would overrule the judgment in his favour.

The word *anguinum* is obviously derived from

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

*anguis*, a snake; and the formation of it is thus described by
Pliny:--"An infinite number of snakes, entwined together in the heat of
summer, roll themselves into a mass, and from the saliva of their jaws,
and the froth of their bodies, is engendered an EGG, which is called
'*anguinum*.' By the violent hissing of the serpents the egg is forced
into the air, and the Druid, destined to secure it, must catch it in his
sacred vest before it reaches the ground."

This singular superstition was still extant in Wales and Cornwall in the
time of Camden, as we find from the following passage in his Britannia,
page 815. "In most parts of Wales, throughout all Scotland, and in
Cornwall, we find it a common opinion of the vulgar, that about
Midsummer-eve it is usual for snakes to meet in company, and that by
their joining heads together and hissing, a kind of bubble is formed,
which the rest by continual hissing blow on till it passes quite through
the body, and then it immediately hardens, and resembles a glass ring,
which whoever finds will prosper in all undertakings. The rings thus
generated are called *gleinen nadroeth*; in English, *snake-stones*."
They are small glass amulets, commonly

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

half as wide as finger rings, but much thicker, and of a green colour
usually, though sometimes blue, and waved with red and white."

The anguinum continued to be venerated in Cornwall in the time of Dr.
Borlase, but the tradition of its formation was somewhat different from
the above. "The country people have a persuasion, that the snakes here
breathing upon a hazel wand, produce a stone ring of a blue colour, in
which there appears the yellow figure of a snake; and that beasts bit
and envenomed, being given some of the water to drink wherein this stone
has been infused, will perfectly recover of the poison <span
id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_395.md)."

These charms were usually called "*glains*;" and, according to
Davies <span id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_396.md), "were some blue, some
white, a third sort green, and a fourth variegated with all these
colours, but still preserving the appearance of glass. Others again were
made of earth, and only glazed over."

The "egg" of which Pliny speaks was only an envelope, the interior and
real glain being either a circle or a lunette: the latter referring

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

probably to the lunar deity, or according to Davies, to the arkite
worship, the ark being sometimes described under the form of a lunette.
These stones have been frequently found in Wales, Northamptonshire <span
id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_397.md), and in many other parts of England. Dr.
Stukeley, in his description of the Druidical temple of Abury in
Wiltshire, mentions having bought two British beads of the inhabitants,
"one large, of a light blue, and ribbed; and the other less, of a dark
blue;" which had been dug up out of one of the barrows on Hakpen Hill, a
promontory upon which rested the head of the serpent which formed the
avenues to the temple of Abury. Beads of this kind have been found in
the barrows near Stonehenge, and are probably most of them the "gleinen
nadroeth," deposited in the sepulchres of the dead as talismanic
securities; the same perhaps which had been worn by the deceased in
their lifetime.

Analogous to this is the superstition of the Malabarians, who venerate
the Pedra del Cobra, or serpent-stone, which the Brahmins persuade them
is taken from the head of the hooded serpent,

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

and, when consecrated by the priests, an effective charm against the
bite of venomous snakes.

This is the serpent-stone to which Pliny alludes, as being held in high
estimation by the eastern kings. "It must be cut out of the brain of a
living serpent, where it grows; for if the serpent die, the stone
dissolves. The natives, therefore, first charm the serpent to sleep with
herbs; and when he is lulled, make a sudden incision in his head, and
cut out the stone <span id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_398.md)."

The superstition of the anguinum prevailed also in Scandinavia, as we
learn from Olaus Magnus: "Creduntur (*sc. serpentes*) veterum relatione,
lapidem flatu suo gignere <span id="fr_400"></span>[2](#fn_399.md)."

Between the religion of the Druids and that of the Scandinavians there
was a strong similarity, though not in every respect an identity. The
same sacrificial rites to the dracontic god, and the same circular
temples, may be observed in Britain and the Scandinavian countries <span
id="fr_401"></span>[3](#fn_400.md); and a branch of the same idolatry
flourished

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

in Ireland--so extensively was Ophiolatreia spread over Europe.

Mr. Faber is of opinion that "the many stories in England of the
destruction of huge serpents, relate ultimately to the destruction of
the living serpents worshipped by the Druids." He instances the cave of
the dragon of Wharncliff in Yorkshire, as precisely similar by legendary
description to the cave of Cadmus's dragon; and remarks that the manor
of Sockburne, is still held by the tenure of exhibiting to the Bishop of
Durham a sword with which a monstrous serpent is said to have been
slain." The presentation of the sword to the *Bishop*, would seem to
imply that a *religious* service had been rendered by its former owner.
This might have been the destruction of an Ophite temple. For in most
countries the overthrow of the serpent-worshippers is allegorized into a
victory over some monstrous dragon, who infested the neighbourhood. That
the votaries of Ophiolatreia penetrated into every part of Britain, is
probable from the vestiges of some such idolatry even now to be found in
Scotland and the western isles. Several obelisks remain in the vicinity
of Aberdeen, Dundee, and Perth, upon which

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

are devices strongly indicative of Ophiolatreia. They are engraved in
Gordon's Itinerarium Septentrionale. The serpent is a frequent and
conspicuous hieroglyphic. From the Runic characters traced upon some of
these stones, it is conjectured that they were erected by the Danes.
Such might have been the case; but the Danes themselves were a sect of
Ophites, and had not the people of the country been Ophites also, they
might not have suffered these monuments to remain. Dr. Ingram pronounces
some of these stones to be Phœnician, especially one on which the figure
of a serpent is seen with the sun and moon revolving about his head. He
considers this figure to be a record of "the old serpent."

An obelisk near Dundee, is very remarkable. It is plain on every side
but one, on which is carved the representation of a man on horseback
pursuing a dragon. The tradition is that the hero lived on the skirts of
a forest where the dragon concealed himself, and preyed upon the human
race. Among other victims, he devoured the nine daughters of this
chieftain, who thereupon mounted his horse, and plunging into the
forest, attacked the monster. The dragon fled before

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

him, but was overtaken and slain upon the spot where the obelisk above
mentioned now stands to record the deed. The track through which the
dragon and his pursuer passed is called "*the den of Bal Dragon* <span
id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_401.md)."

It is possible that this story may also allude to the destruction of an
Ophite temple.

British Ophiolatreia sunk beneath the unsparing sword of the Romans. But
a symbol of the idolatry survived its overthrow; and under the form of
"the Dragon standard," not only sustained the nationality of the Welsh,
but also became the idol of the Anglo-Saxons.

The origin of this standard is curiously though apocryphally explained
by Matthew of Westminster. "The brother of the British king Aurelius
beheld a vision--a fiery meteor in the form of a great dragon, illumined
the heavens with a portentous glare. The astrologers unanimously
expounded the omen to signify that the seer would one day sit upon the
throne of Britain. Aurelius died, and his brother became king. His first
royal act was to cause the fabrication of two dragons in gold, like the
figure which the meteor assumed. One of these he placed

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

in Winchester Cathedral; the other he reserved to be carried before him
in his military expeditions. And hence the custom which the kings of
England have ever since observed--that of having the *Dragon standard*
borne before them in battle." The dragon standard was borne before
Richard in Palestine, and two noble knights disputed the honour of
carrying it. "When the king had planted his standard in the middle,"
says Hoveden, "he gave his *dragon* to be borne by Peter de Pratellis,
contrary to the claim of Robert de Trussebut, who demanded that honour
as his hereditary right."

In the hands of the standard-bearer of Henry the Third, the dragon was
avowedly the harbinger of destruction. In the Welsh campaign, "so great
was the indignation of Henry," says Knighton, "that *having raised the
dragon standard*, he ordered his troops to advance and give no quarter."
The same, says Matthew of Paris--"animating his troops the marched daily
clad in armour, and unfolding his royal ensign, *the dragon which knows
not how to spare*, he threatened extermination to the Welsh." With
similar ferocity and with the same terrific standard, he

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

marched against his rebellious barons. The dragon was always the herald
of "*no quarter*."

In camp this standard was planted in the front of the king's pavilion,
to the right of the other ensigns, and was kept unfurled day and
night <span id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_402.md).

The dragon was introduced by Henry the Seventh, as a supporter of the
royal arms. He brought it from Wales, and it is still the king's crest
as sovereign of that principality. It gave place, at the Union, to the
Unicorn of Scotland; but the heraldic dragon is as different an animal
from the poetic, as the poetic is from the religious, which last was
merely *a large serpent*.

 

2\. IRELAND.--The prevalence of the Celtic superstition in Ireland is
marked, even now, by stupendous monuments: but the Druids of this nation
assimilated themselves rather to those of Gaul than of Britain. The
chief object of their adoration was OGHAM or OGMIUS, the same as the
deity OG of Trachonitis. His images were represented as holding in their
hands the club of Hercules, surmounted by the caduceus of Mercury, the
wings of which were attached to

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

the club. The staff of the caduceus terminated in a ring.

At New Grange, in the county of Meath, has been discovered a grand
cruciform cavern, whose consecration to Mithras is indisputable. This
Persian deity was symbolized by a serpent, and is the corresponding god
to Apollo in Grecian mythology. Here were dug up three remarkable
stones, on which mystical figures, like spiral lines, or coiled
serpents, rudely carved, have been observed. "These lines," says Mr.
Beauford, who describes the cavern, "appear to be the representation of
serpents coiled up, and were probably symbols of the Divine Being <span
id="fr_404"></span>[1](#fn_403.md)." The relation of these relics to the
celebrated Omphalos we have considered in a former part of this volume,
to which, therefore, the reader is referred.

For the paucity of the remains of the ancient Ophiolatreia in Ireland,
we are perhaps indebted to the renowned St. Patrick, whose popular
legend may not, after all, be so ridiculous or so groundless as
Englishmen and Protestants are accustomed to imagine. It is said, and
believed by the lower order of Irish

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

to this day, that St. Patrick *banished all snakes* from Ireland by his
prayers. May not this imply that St. Patrick, in evangelizing that
country, overthrew the superstition of THE SERPENT-WORSHIPPERS? Such an
inference is drawn by Bryant, from similar stories of the destruction of
serpents in the Grecian Archipelago and Peloponnesus; and I see no
reason why a similar line of argument should not be adopted in regard to
the achievements of St. Patrick in Ireland. Such fables are general in
Christian countries which were ever devoted to Ophiolatreia <span
id="fr_405"></span>[1](#fn_404.md).

 

3\. GAUL.--The ancient religion of Gaul, though established by Druids,
was not so pure as that of Britain; neither did it retain so strong a
hold upon the affections of the people. There was in it more of
idolatry, and less of priestcraft; so that when the Romans subjugated
the country, the natives passed rapidly into the superstitions of their
conquerors. To render this transition the more easy, their primitive
religion had already been corrupted by the inroads of Egyptian theology;
but at what period or through what channel, is involved in mystery.

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The well-known figures of Gallic deities,
decorated with the caduceus of Hermes, are monuments of the fact. This
god was probably the Theutates of Celtic mythology, the Theuth or Thoth
of the Egyptian <span id="fr_406"></span>[1](#fn_405.md); and identical
with the Gothic Teut or Tuisto <span id="fr_407"></span>[2](#fn_406.md).
The name *Tat*, *Tath*, or *Tait*," remarks Faber, "was well known to
the ancient Irish," (whose priests we have observed were probably of the
Gallic tribe of Druids.) "By this word they designated the first day of
the month August, that being the month of harvest, and Tait being the
god who presided over agriculture. The month which among the Egyptians
corresponded with August was called by the name of the god Thoth <span
id="fr_408"></span>[3](#fn_407.md)."

This remark of Faber brings to mind the singular connexion of the sacred
serpent with *agriculture*, in the mythology of the Greeks. There we
have Ceres, the goddess of *corn*, sitting in a chariot drawn by
serpents. Triptolemus, the founder of the Eleusinian mysteries, was no
sooner instructed by Ceres in the arts of agriculture, than he was
presented with the *dracontic chariot* to carry him through the world,

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

to dispense the same blessings among mankind which he had bestowed upon
his own countrymen. And both in the Pythian temple of Epirus, and at
Lanuvium in Italy were sacred serpents to whom the *farmers* of the
vicinity resorted for an omen of a *good* or *bad harvest*.

When we consider that Thoth was the great promoter of Ophiolatreia in
Phœnicia and Egypt, the coincidence will be remarkable, as obliquely
bearing upon the great question in hand--the derivation of all mythology
relating to the serpent, from the events in Paradise.

For, independently of the connexion of the serpent-tempter with the
*tree* and its *fruit*, the memory of which has been wonderfully
preserved throughout the world, one of the immediate consequences of the
serpent's success in seducing our first parents, was *a general
deterioration of the properties of the earth* <span
id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_408.md). Hence, in the confusion of truth and
error, of which heathen mythology is almost entirely composed, would
naturally arise the opinion that the serpent was in some mysterious
manner influential upon agriculture: and the genius of superstition
would

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

very readily invest the reptile with the attribute of a god oracular to
husbandmen.

To Teutates, or Mercury, the Druids of Gaul were accustomed to immolate
human victims. There is nothing peculiar in this sacrificial observance,
except its connexion with a singular opinion which borders so closely
upon the doctrine of THE ATONEMENT, that I cannot pass it by. It is thus
expressed by Cæsar <span id="fr_410"></span>[1](#fn_409.md):--"PRO VITA
HOMINIS NISI VITA HOMINIS REDDATUR, NON POSSE ALTIER DEORUM IMMORTALIUM
NUMEN PLACARI, ARBITRANTUR." The sacrifice of human victims was at one
time universal, but in no religion has been preserved so clear a
conception of the truth. The people who entertained it must have
separated very early from the rest of the heathen, and retained their
primeval errors almost unbroken.

In the Druids, then, we behold some of the first deviators from the
faith of Noah; and the purer the druidism, the nearer the truth.

The other leading doctrines of the Druids correspond in simplicity with
this remarkable opinion: *the unity of the Godhead*, and *the
immortality of the soul*, being the foundation

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

of their creed, before it was corrupted by the polytheism of Egypt
transmitted through Phœnicia. It was in this corrupted state that the
Romans found it.

THE SOLAR-SERPENT-WORSHIP of the Persians seems to have penetrated into
Gaul; for "there is a mixed symbolic image at Arles, the principal part
of which is that of a human person clothed with a veil, on which are
wrought in relievo, the figures of the zodiac. Round this person THE
DRAGON SERPENT winds his flexile course <span
id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_410.md)." . . . . . . .

But the most curious relic of the religion of the Gauls has been
preserved in a piece of sculpture on the front of a temple at
Montmorillon in Poitou, of which Montfaucon has given us an
engraving <span id="fr_412"></span>[2](#fn_411.md). It is thus described by
this ingenious antiquary--"Over the gate of the temple are eight human
figures of rude workmanship, which are probably deities. Of these eight
there are six images of men placed in two

GAUL. 277

groups, three and three together . . . . . . . the figures terminating
the sides are women. One of them has long hair hanging down before her,
and is dressed very like the women now-a-days. She holds her hands on
her sides, and wears gloves like those now used. *That on the other end
is naked, and has TWO SERPENTS twisting round her legs, &c*. Now these
figures being all clothed, except the last mentioned, in garments
apparently of a sacerdotal character, were probably intended to
represent the habits of the priests and priestesses of the eight
principal gods of the Gauls. For we have other images of the Gallic gods
very differently habited from these. We may infer, therefore, that the
naked female, with the two serpents, was the priestess of the deity to
whom the serpent was more particularly sacred. A conclusion which is
rendered reasonable by the fact, that the Ophite deity of the Egyptians
was known to the Druids of Britain, and consequently must have been
known to those of Gaul. Our inference, thus corroborated, is still
farther illustrated by the customs prevalent at the Pythian temples of
Epirus and Lanuvium, in which the god was *a serpent*, and the
officiating priestess *naked*.

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

It is difficult to ascertain the connecting link between the several
chains of Ophiolatreia through the world; but it is probable that some
intercourse, unremembered in history, existed between the Grecian and
Gallic states at a very early period; by means of which the religions of
Egypt and Greece may have been partially transmitted to Gaul. To
strengthen such a conjecture, Cæsar informs us, that the Druids of Gaul
were acquainted with the Greek language, or at least the Greek alphabet:
publicis privatisque rationibus GRÆCIS LITERIS utuntur <span
id="fr_413"></span>[1](#fn_412.md)."

The chief seat of the Druidical religion, however, was Britain, as the
same writer assures us; to which country the young Druids of Gaul were
sent for their education <span id="fr_414"></span>[2](#fn_413.md).

 

4\. BRITANY. Connected with Gaul, if not itself a part of Gaul, is the
interesting country of Britany; a country in which the ancient religion
of the Celts found refuge when banished from almost every other by the
Roman arms. Many vestiges of Ophiolatreia are still visible among the
antiquities and customs of Britany. The

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

dragon and the serpent are favorite ornaments upon the walls of the
churches, of which that of Landevan is a curious example; as if they had
been carved by the early Christians upon the exterior of their
sanctuaries, to invite the hesitating Ophite to enter the portals of a
*consecrated* building; *serpents upon the wall* being the sign of
*consecration* <span id="fr_415"></span>[1](#fn_414.md).

But whether this was really the case or not, it is certain that the
first inhabitants of Britany were worshippers of the god BEL, whose name
may be still recognized in that of the Christian priesthood which has
succeeded to his holy places. In the Breton language the word "*Priest*"
is rendered "*Belech*," which appears to be the same as the *Balak* of
Scripture, who was the priest and king of Moab. It has been already
remarked that, in the Ophite religion, it was the general custom to name
the priesthood after the god of their adoration. Thus the priestess of
OUB was also called *Oub*; the priestess of PYTHON, *Pythia*; the
high-priest of C’NEPH, *Icnuphis*, &c. *Balak* or *Belech* may similarly
indicate a priest of BEL-THE-DRAGON. BEL and the DRAGON are always
united, and

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Balak* would bear this signification if, as
Stukeley asserts, the ancient name of a *serpent* in the Celtic language
was "*Hak*." This word is now obsolete; but an ancient casuistical
writer of Britany cited by Pelletier in his dictionary of the Breton
language, has the following passage:

     Henvell an diaoul hac an aerouant.  
i.e. "*As the devil Hac the serpent*."

Pelletier translates *hac* as if it were only the conjunction "and:" but
it may be the old word "*Hac*," a snake, which was known to the ancient
Persians, and enters into the name "Takshac," of the *serpent-tribes* of
the mountain *Tak*.

General de Penhouët, in his memoir on Ophiolatreia, lately read before
the Academy of Nantes, mentions a curious custom which prevailed in the
bourg of Sérent in the Morbihan, before the French Revolution, which
seems to have been the relic of an Ophite ceremony. This was a
procession of the villagers, in which they carried a *Gwiber* or snake,
crying as they advanced, "*Let him beware who will of the Gwiber
Draig* <span id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_415.md), *peace to Molac!*" The
tradition of the

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

neighbourhood stated that in former times, a monster lived in the woods
adjoining, who devoured infants. He was slain by a gentleman of the
place, and hence the cry, "*Peace* (or *silence*) *to Molac*." A Breton
family still bears the name of Molac with the motto "*Gric à Molac en
bon espoir*." M. de Penhouët thinks that the word *Molac* should be
rather *Moloc*; and alludes to the heathen deity of that name to whom
the idolatrous Ammonites offered their children. But he adds, that in
the immediate vicinity of Sérent, where the procession was held, is a
commune called Molac. I will not pretend to determine whether or not
Moloch, the god of the Ammonites, ever had an altar in Britany; but it
is certainly remarkable, that many Breton customs, and not a few of the
idols found in the district, have a strong resemblance to those of
Oriental countries. Thus a rock in the Morbihan is carved into a form
exactly pourtraying the head of the Egyptian Anubis. A statue of the
Syrian goddess Lilith, whose head-dress resembles that of Isis, is still
standing, almost in its primitive perfection, at the chateau of
Quinipili in the parish of Baud, and for many ages has furnished the
pattern for the caps of

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

the female peasantry of the commune: while the male portion of the
villagers, throughout lower Britany, wear round their loins a chequered
linen sash, which they call a "*turban*," inducing the conjecture that
they were of oriental descent, and upon adopting the customs of Europe,
removed their *turbans* from the head to the waist, without laying aside
their forms or names. Other indications of an eastern origin are
strongly marked among the peasantry of Lower Britany <span
id="fr_417"></span>[1](#fn_416.md). It is therefore not improbable that the
Moloch of the Ammonites might also have had an altar at Sérent.

But the most indisputable memorial of the dragon," is to be found in
those eternal columns which have stamped his image upon the plains of
Erdeven and Carnac, and display to the eyes of admiring ages the remains
of a dracontium which must once have covered a territory *at least eight
miles in length*. The description of this temple, which was certainly
one of the most stupendous in the world, I reserve for the chapter
especially dedicated to the subject of DRACONTIA. Other indications of
Ophiolatreia claim our attention which are better suited to

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

this part of our inquiry. Among these we may consider the oracle of BEL,
which has left a sufficient record of its existence in the name of the
parish in which it is situated, which is still called *Belz* or *Bels*,
being evidently a contraction of the Roman word *Belus*. This spot I
visited in August and September 1831, in company with General de
Penhouët, a gentleman of Rennes, well known for his antiquarian
knowledge and ingenious writings on the antiquities of Armorica. Among
other interesting places, he directed me to the island of St. Cado, to
THE ORACLE OF BEL. This is a small rectangular inclosure, about three
feet in length and two in height, contained by four slabs of stone. Over
it is built a chapel dedicated to St. Cado, who is said to have landed
upon this spot when he came to evangelize this part of Britany. The
chapel and oracle stand upon a small island in the river Estel, which is
joined to the main land by a causeway. The architect of this causeway,
tradition states, was no less a personage than Satan himself, who
undertook to build it at the request of St. Cado, on condition that the
should have the first living thing that passed over it--hoping, as the
saint was the only human

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

being on the island, he might himself be the unlucky passenger. By the
assistance of his *wife*, who carried many of the materials in her
apron, the Devil accomplished his task in a single night: and for his
reward received the next morning a *cat*, which the cunning saint sent
over before himself. To the chapel of St. Cado, many of the devout
peasants of the Morbihan resort in the faithful expectation of being
miraculously cured of deafness by thrusting their heads into the
consecrated hole above mentioned. The guide who conducted us was an
implicit believer in the miraculous powers of the holy corner, and
declared, upon putting in his head, that he distinctly heard a sound!
This was mere imagination--but it is probable that the purpose to which
the place was formerly devoted, namely, the oracular responses of the
priestess of Bel, may have left this superstition as a feeble record of
the once famous Oracle.

It is remarkable that St. Cado is said to have been the Christian
missionary, who, landing upon this spot, expelled from it a *colony of
serpents!* by which tradition I understand the conversion to
Christianity, of the *serpent worshippers* of Belz.

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

Similar stories are told of other Breton saints. St. Maudet established
himself in an island near Treguier which bears his name, and cleared it
in like manner of *serpents*. A St. Paul likewise settled in the Ile de
Bas, which at that time was infested by an enormous dragon. Being
solicited by the people to deliver them from this monster, "he passed
his stole under his neck, and plunged him into the sea;" and the place
of this achievement is still pointed out as "the dragon's leap." "How
are we to understand these things," ingeniously demands M. de Penhouët,
"if we do not look upon them as a transparent veil through which we
perceive the *efficacy of baptism administered to the followers of
serpent-worship, who upon their conversion were plunged into the
water* <span id="fr_418"></span>[1](#fn_417.md)?"

It is extremely probable that these and all similar traditions relate
solely to the success of the first Christian missionaries over the
votaries of the serpent. But the means by which they effected this
desirable change in the religion of the idolaters were perhaps more
politic than scriptural; more like the founders of a temporal than a
spiritual kingdom. Finding the difficulty

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

of a complete conversion, they were contented with a partial, and rather
than not gain any converts, they sacrificed the consistency and
simplicity of the Christian religion. They permitted the Ophites to
retain many of their idolatrous opinions and practices even after
baptism, considering, perhaps, that half a Christian was better than an
entire Pagan, and hoping that though the father might be only an
accommodating, the son would, in time, become a sincere believer in the
Gospel. Hence we see the *serpent*, the emblem of consecration, carved
upon the exterior of churches; such as Landevan, Dinan, and others.
Hence, also, the introduction of the SUN and the SERPENT into
ecclesiastical processions. But while they thus blended the old religion
with the new, they endeavoured to remove scandal from the Christian
congregation, by prominently exhibiting in a well-understood allegory,
the triumph of Christianity over Ophiolatreia. Thus the church of
Landevan, near Belz, which might have invited the Ophite to enter its
gates by the *serpent* carved upon its exterior wall, showed the
Christian, at its altar, a statue of St. Michael trampling under foot
"the apostate dragon." And thus, also, the

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Solar Mount of Carnac, beneath which the
dragon-temple winds his course, bears on its summit a chapel of the
Archangel, the destroyer of that dragon's spiritual prototype. There
was, therefore, much of the serpent's subtilty in the method which
undermined the serpent's kingdom.

Du Fresne, in his glossary upon the word "Draco," explains the part
which was borne by the dragon in the ecclesiastical processions of the
Church of Rome. "An effigy of a dragon is wont to be carried, by which
is designated the devil himself, or heresy, over both of which the
Church triumphs." Again, in speaking of the customs of a particular
monastery, he says, "On Palm Sunday there are two processions, in which
the standard and the *dragon* precede. Holy water and a censer without
fire; a cross and *dragon on a pole* are borne in procession. One of the
boys, however, carries a lighted candle in a lantern, that fire may be
at hand in case the light *which is in the dragon's mouth* should be
extinguished."

In these customs there are strong traces of Ophiolatreia as connected
with the worship of the sun. "The fire in the dragon's mouth,"

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

which they were so careful to keep alive, reminds us of the holy fire so
reverently cherished by the children of the sun; and "the dragon upon
the pole" recalls the standard of the Ophites in every country where
they reigned: while the whole ceremony may be considered as a lively
representation of an Ophite procession as it advanced through the
sinuous parallelitha of Carnac.

CARNAC, however, is not the only dracontium of Britany. The whole of the
department of the Morbihan may be considered as the *terra sancta* of
BEL. Fragments of serpent temples may be seen in many communes,
surrounding the great dracontium of Carnac, like village churches about
the cathedral of their diocese. Even the islands upon the coasts not
unfrequently present some striking memorial of the same prevailing
worship. An island in the Morbihan which contains the relics of a
dracontium, still commemorates, by its name, its ancient dedication. It
is called "*the Island of the Monks*," probably from having been
colonized in remote ages by the Druids who officiated in the dracontium:
for I believe there are no remains of any Christian monastery from which
it may have derived the appellation. At the western extremity

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

of the dracontium is a long barrow, one end of which being broken,
disclosed a very beautiful kistvaën. This spot is singularly called
*Penab*: i.e. "*the head* of AB:" and as there is no vestige of a house
upon the site so designated, the name of Penab must have belonged to the
temple, and indicated that part of it which, like the "Hakpen" of Abury,
was the "serpent's head."

A more minute examination of the antiquities of Britany, assisted by a
knowledge of the Breton language, would throw much light upon the
ancient religion of that interesting country, which I cannot but think,
was, at the least, a modification of that Ophiolatreia which, in almost
every region of the world, had its altars, its dragon temples, and its
human victims <span id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_418.md).

A longer stay in Britany might have enabled me to bring forward many
more proofs of its aboriginal worship of the serpent: but the temple of
Carnac, which I shall describe in a subsequent chapter, will abundantly
establish the argument

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

which I have undertaken. This temple I have minutely and thoroughly
investigated; and the plan published, both in the Archæologia, and in
this volume (in which a restoration has been attempted,) will convince
any but those against whose previously expressed theories it may
militate, that it was truly a DRACONTIUM--a temple of the SOLAR SERPENT.

*Galaxius*, "the milky." A festival called Galaxia was held to him, in
which the votaries partook of a feast of barley pulse, boiled in milk.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[258:1](wos06.htm#fr_391.md) This horn, now a
drinking cup, is said to have been originally a musical instrument: but
it will still illustrate my theory, for *horns* are supposed to have
been used by the Scalds or Runic priests to call together the
congregation to sacrifice. Such horns would probably bear upon them
devices appertaining to their religion. Horns were sometimes used for
both purposes, being furnished with a cap, and so convertible into
drinking cups <span id="fr_392"></span>[\*](#fn_391.md). The "golden horns
which contained the drink offerings" above described, might thus have
been used also as sacrificial trumpets.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[259:1](wos06.htm#fr_393.md) The scene of these
rites might have been STONEHENGE, which is said by tradition to have
been erected in honour of Uther Pendragon. The only difficulty in this
conjecture is the mention of "lakes" near the temple. But an attentive
survey of the spot has convinced me that a piece of water <span
id="page_260">p. 260</span> once existed under the hill upon which
Stonehenge stands. On the side towards Amesbury there are evident traces
of the bed of a river running north and south. Perhaps, by means of this
winding water, the stupendous stones which form the temple were conveyed
on rafts to the spot of their erection. That such means of conveyance
were used by the Druids, appears from the fact that a large stone, in
every respect like those at Stonehenge, now lies in the river Avon at
Bulford, not far from hence. It would be an interesting research to
trace the course of this apparent river-bed, and might throw much light
on the disputed question--"whence, and how came these stones to
Stonehenge?" I believe that they came from the valley of the Grey
Wethers, near Abury.
