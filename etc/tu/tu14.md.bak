### SECTION XII.

#### THE LION AND THE UNICORN.

*Subsection* 1. *The Solar Lion*.

THAT the Lion is a symbol of the Sun, and more particularly of the
diurnal Sun, is a fact familiar to the mythologist, and one which has
already been illustrated in the preceding pages; <span
id="fr_314"></span>[1](#fn_314.md) but a few further instances may suitably
here be added.

In the Kamic Hymn to Ra-Har-em-akhu, <span
id="fr_315"></span>[2](#fn_315.md) the diurnal sun on the horizon, we
read;—'Thou roarest in smiting thy foes,' <span
id="fr_316"></span>[3](#fn_316.md) the terrible roaring of flame being a
link between the sun and the lion, as an Akkadian Hymn-writer says of
Nindara, 'Lord-of-the-darkness,' *i.e.*, the Nocturnal-sun, 'Thou,
during thy action, roarest,' <span id="fr_317"></span>[4](#fn_317.md) and
as a Vedic Hymn-writer says of Agni (Ignis) that he 'roars like a
lion.' <span id="fr_318"></span>[5](#fn_318.md)

In the Inscription of Daryavush I. at El-Khargeh, the oasis of Ammon in
the Libyan desert, the great god Amen-Ra, the Invisible-god revealed in
the Sun-god, is addressed as 'the Lion of the double lions.'

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> These 'two lions,
two brothers,' 'the two Lion-gods,' are two solar phases as diurnal and
nocturnal, Har and Set, <span id="fr_319"></span>[1](#fn_319.md) Shu and
Tefnut; <span id="fr_320"></span>[2](#fn_320.md) and as there is but one
solar orb, so he is '*the* Lion of the double lions.'

In the *Funereal Ritual* the Osirian, or Soul seeking divine union and
communion with the Sun-god, prays;—

'Let me not be surpassed by the Lion-god:  
 Oh, the Lion of the Sun, who lifts his arm in the hill' <span
id="fr_321"></span>[3](#fn_321.md) \[of heaven\].

And exclaims;—

'I am the Lions. I am the Sun.  
The white lion is the phallus of the Sun.' <span
id="fr_322"></span>[4](#fn_322.md)

A remarkable amulet of the Helleniko-Kamic period, copied by
Caylus, <span id="fr_323"></span>[5](#fn_323.md) illustrates the occult
expression 'phallus of the sun,' and also shows the solar-leonine
connexion. In the centre of a circle is a closed human eye, surrounded
by various animals and representations all turned toward s it, and
placed in the following order:—On the right hand or eastern side, a
cock, a serpent, and a goose; on the north, a lizard and a thunderbolt;
on the west, a scorpion and a phallus; and on the south, a lion and a
dog. Caylus remarks feebly that 'Superstition is infinitely varied in
its details,' but makes no attempt to explain the

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

design; and indeed the combination is elaborate and extensive, and the
design inexplicable when solely regarded either on Kamic or Hellenik
principles. The single central eye is closed to show that the Sun of the
Underworld is indicated, and the Lion, type of the diurnal Sun, is
placed in the lower part of the design to show that the flaming sun of
day has sunk beneath the horizon. By the leonine sun, is his ally the
raging Dog-star, Set-Sothis, Kuôn-Seirios, Sirius, the 'Scorching.'
Conversely, the Lizard, emblem of the moisture and dews of night, and as
such slain by the Hellenik Sun-god Apollôn Sauroktonos, <span
id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_324.md) is placed in the north, that is in the
height of the nocturnal heaven. The Thunderbolt, which comes from the
sky, also appears high in heaven. To the east, his head close on the
horizon-line, stands the Cock, the solar bird of day; immediately above
him and due east is the Serpent-of-light, a solar creature in Kamic
symbolism and the creeping dawn-gleam in Hellenik. Above the Serpent is
the Goose volant, its neck stretched towards the sun and flying from
east to west. It represents the Soul of the Osirian which is said to
'cackle like a goose,' <span id="fr_325"></span>[2](#fn_325.md) to fly, and
to 'alight on the road of the west of the horizon,' flying towards the
Sun-god Uasar-Osiris. Near the western horizon ready to seize the
sinking sun is his Scorpion-daughter the Darkness. <span
id="fr_326"></span>[3](#fn_326.md) The Phallus, placed below

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

the horizon, illustrates the secret power of the sun in the renewal of
the face of the world, and is winged in order to identify it with the
solar orb.

According to M. Paul Pierret (whose opinion on the matter I do not
dispute), the leonto-kephalic Kamic goddesses represent the power of the
solar eyes. <span id="fr_327"></span>[1](#fn_327.md)

The solar Dionysos, as Pater Bromius, 'the Roarer,' sometimes appears as
leonto-kephalic in Mithraic and Gnostic symbols; <span
id="fr_328"></span>[2](#fn_328.md) and in the *Bakchai* of Euripides the
Chorus call upon him to put forth his dreadful might and to appear as a
'flaming lion' (πυριφλέγων λέων). <span id="fr_329"></span>[3](#fn_329.md)

The river Nile was regarded as an emanation from the kosmic Sun-god
Osiris, <span id="fr_330"></span>[4](#fn_330.md) and hence is called by
Homer Diipetes, <span id="fr_331"></span>[5](#fn_331.md) 'Sky-fallen,' as
descended from the solar Lion. Hence the usual type of leonto-kephalic
fountain-pipes, an idea which does not merely depend on the Sun being in
*Leo* at the time of the inundation, for the zodiacal Leo is not an
archaic Kamic constellation, and still less on the alleged
contemporaneous appearance of lions in the country. Mr. King mentions an
Etruscan example which shows 'figures in regular Babylonian costume,
worshipping before a fountain discharging itself out of a colossal

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

lion's head into a basin, a palm tree in the midst.' <span
id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_332.md) Fipeke is 'the name of an Etruscan
lion-headed monster, with water flowing from his mouth.' <span
id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_333.md) He is said to have been combated by
Herakles, perhaps as a rival sun-god. The Lion-sun draws up the waters
of the earth and sends them down again.

The Lion and Sun form the familiar national standard of Persia, and a
Persian coin given by Tavernier <span id="fr_334"></span>[3](#fn_334.md)
shows the sun horned and radiate rising over the back of a lion. In the
later period of the solar Mithras-cult 'the superior officials were
styled Lions; hence the rites themselves are often designated as
*Leontica*.' <span id="fr_335"></span>[4](#fn_335.md)

The leonto-kephalic Serpent radiate is a familiar design in Gnostic and
other gems which form that large division classed by Montfaucon under
the heading Abraxas. Sometimes seven stars, sometimes the sun and moon
are in the field. The head often has seven rays. The Lion is
occasionally shown in full; one example <span
id="fr_336"></span>[5](#fn_336.md) gives the eight-rayed solar star beneath
him, and the crescent-moon high in heaven.

Another interesting example of the Lion-sun is shown on a gem <span
id="fr_337"></span>[6](#fn_337.md) which represents the Lion, over whom is
the eight-rayed solar star, swallowing headfirst a large bee. The Bee is
a creature especially connected with the happy and peaceful earth-life
of growth and increase, and so finds a prominent place

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

in the symbolism of the great nature-goddess Artemis-Ephesia-Polymastos,
whose chief priest was. called Essên, the King-bee. <span
id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_338.md) The bee-swallowing Lion is the raging
Athamas consuming the nourishing vegetation of the earth, whose happy
voice is uplifted in the 'murmuring of innumerable bees.' <span
id="fr_339"></span>[2](#fn_339.md)

The last instance of the connexion between Sun and Lion which I shall
mention is the zodiacal *Leo*, the Akkadio-Assyrian Sign of the month
Abu, Aramaic Ab (July-August), the Akkadian name of which is *Ab
ab-gar*, 'Fire-that-makes-fire,' the period of the full sway of the
burning Athamas-Tammuz. I have treated of the original connexion between
the Sun and the Signs in a separate monograph. <span
id="fr_340"></span>[3](#fn_340.md)

*Subsection* 2. *The Contest*.

SUCH, then, being the characteristics of the mythological Lion and
Unicorn, they are, like the Lion and the Leopard, naturally
antagonistic; and their contest is the converse of that of these two
latter animals. As the Lion, fast in the cave, is gnawed to death by the
Leopard who comes round behind him, so the Unicorn when rushing at the
Lion sticks his horn fast in a mythic Tree behind which his opponent has
taken refuge, and the Lion coming round devours him whilst thus
defenceless. This incident of the

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

story, when taken in connexion with the Leopard-myth, shows that no real
animal has supplied a foundation for the belief. Spencer thus gives the
legend;—

     'Like as a Lyon whose imperial powre  
     A prowd rebellious unicorn defyes,  
     T’avoid the rash assault and wrathful stowre  
     Of his fiers foe, him to a tree applyes,  
     And when him ronning in full course he spyes,  
     He slips aside; the whiles that furious beast  
     His precious home, sought of his enemyes,  
     Strikes in the stocke, ne thence can be releast,  
But to the mighty victor yields a bounteous feast.' <span
id="fr_341"></span>[1](#fn_341.md)

Malone, commenting on the passage, 'Unicorns may be betray’d with
trees,' <span id="fr_342"></span>[2](#fn_342.md) quotes *Bussy D’Ambois*,
1607;—

'An angry unicorne in his full career  
 Charge with too swift a foot a jeweller  
 That watch’d him for the treasure of his brow,  
 And ere he could get shelter of a tree,  
 Nail him with his rich antler to the earth.'

On the passage 'Wert thou the Unicorn, pride and wrath would confound
thee, and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury,' <span
id="fr_343"></span>[3](#fn_343.md) Sir Thos. Hanmer quotes from Gesner,
*History of Animal*s, 'The Unicorn and the Lion *being enemies by
nature*, as soon as the lion sees the unicorn he betakes himself to a
tree: the unicorn in his fury, and with all the swiftness of his course,
running at him, sticks his horn fast in the tree, and then the lion
falls upon him and kills him.'

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

Schliemann gives a representation of a gold plate from Mykênê with a
design which he says 'represents a lion chasing a stag; the fore feet of
the former are in a horizontal line to show the great speed with which
he is running; he has just overtaken the stag, which sinks down before
him, and his jaws are wide open to devour it. The representation of the
stag *which has no horns*, is clumsy and indistinct.' <span
id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_344.md) This is not a correct description of the
design; the so-called stag, half of which only is shown, has a head and
neck like that of a horse, and a peculiar crest not unlike that with
which the Gryphon is at times supplied. I rather think that it has also
one short horn, and far from sinking down, or flying, as might be
implied from Schliemann's description, it awaits the lion's charge with
lowered head, and is apparently the larger animal of the two. I do not
assert that the design represents the contest of Lion and Unicorn, but
it certainly bears a great resemblance to this famous duel.

The myth is of course very easy to explain in the light of the foregoing
considerations. The Lion-sun flies from the rising Unicorn-moon and
hides behind the Tree or Grove of the Underworld; <span
id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_345.md) the Moon pursues and, sinking in her
turn, is caught in this mysterious Tree and sun-slain. So, curiously
enough, we read in a Babylonian Astrological tablet, *Sin Samsa* <span
id="fr_346"></span>[3](#fn_346.md) *la* <span
id="fr_347"></span>[4](#fn_347.md) *yu-ci-va; na-an-dhur aryai* <span
id="fr_348"></span>[5](#fn_348.md) *u akhi*. <span
id="fr_349"></span>[6](#fn_349.md)

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'The Moon the Sun
does not face; appearance of lions and hyaenas.' <span
id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_350.md) So, again;—'The Moon and Sun with one
another are seen: king to king hostility sends.' <span
id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_351.md) 'The Sun in the place where the Moon set
is fixed.' <span id="fr_352"></span>[3](#fn_352.md) So some Families who
bear the Unicorn as Arms or Crest have such mottoes as 'Tenez le droit,'
'Cassis tutissima virtus,' etc. Moonlight as involving comparative cold
and frigidity, not unnaturally connects the Moon in idea with chastity.

*Subsection* 3. *The Grove of the Underworld*.

As the Lion is caught in the straightness of a cave, so the Unicorn is
caught in a Tree; and I will first briefly notice the mythic statements
respecting this Tree and its reduplication as a Grove, and secondly
consider the meaning of the occult myth.

First, then, as to the Tree-myth: the Tree constantly comes before us in
connexion with the Unicorn in archaic art, <span
id="fr_353"></span>[4](#fn_353.md) and in addition to the foregoing
instances, I may mention a very remarkable gold signet-ring found by
Schliemann at Mykênê, <span id="fr_354"></span>[5](#fn_354.md) on which is
shown the conventional Tree 'whose stem certainly resembles that of a
palm; it has fifteen short branches on which we see no leaves, but large
clusters of a small fruit, each cluster resembling a

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

pine apple.' One savant regards it as a pine, another as a
breadfruit-tree, another as a clumsy representation of a vine; but it is
none of these, being merely the conventional Tree of the myth, which in
art has passed as far westwards as Mykênê, and is often a palm
(Euphratean type) or poplaresque (Kamic type), the two being found
jointly under Phoenician Influence. The types of the Sacred Tree of
Assyria are now very familiar to us from the works of Assyriologists and
otherwise; in some instances divinities stand or kneel on each side of
it. 'A sacred tree, an ox, a bee' <span id="fr_355"></span>[1](#fn_355.md)
were special Babylonian symbols. <span id="fr_356"></span>[2](#fn_356.md)
Thus a Babylonian Cylinder <span id="fr_357"></span>[3](#fn_357.md) gives
'Sacred Tree, Seated Figure on each side, and Serpent in background,' a
combination which links it with the Biblical Tree of Life; <span
id="fr_358"></span>[4](#fn_358.md) and an Assyrian Cylinder <span
id="fr_359"></span>[5](#fn_359.md) shows 'Sacred Tree, or Grove, with
attendant Cherubim.' A Kamic representation <span
id="fr_360"></span>[6](#fn_360.md) gives 'the cypress <span
id="fr_361"></span>[7](#fn_361.md) shades guarded by fire-breathing uraei,'
the solar-serpents of good; in these secure retreats 'the bodies of the
just await their ultimate revivification.' The symbolical trees are in
each case trees of the country where the myth originated.

Pherekydes <span id="fr_362"></span>[8](#fn_362.md) of Syros, a writer of
reputed Phoenician descent and whose works show the strongest

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Oriental
influence, says;—'Zas \[Zeus\] makes a veil large and beautiful, and
works on it Earth and Ogên, <span id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_363.md) and
the palace of Ogên;' <span id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_364.md) and this veil
which is identical with the starry peplos of Harmonia, the bride of
Kadmos 'the Easterner,' *i.e.*, the Sun, <span
id="fr_365"></span>[3](#fn_365.md) whose marriage with stellar space
completes kosmic order, the god hangs on a winged oak (ἡ ὑπόπτερος δρῦς)
M. Maury well observes on the myth, 'C’est là évidemment une image de la
voûte du firmament, souvent figurée par un voile, et auquel un arbre est
donné pour support. Il y a là une conception toute semblable à celle de
l’arbre Yggdrasil de la mythologie scandinave, dont les racines
s’étendent jusqu’au Niflheim et dont la tige s’élève dans les
cieux.' <span id="fr_366"></span>[4](#fn_366.md) At Ragnarok
'The-Twilight-of-the-gods,' the conclusion of the present state of
things, the gigantic kosmic ash-tree Yggdrasil groans, trembles, and is
set on fire; but a man and woman Lifthrasir ('Life-raiser'), and Lif
('Life') are preserved amid the general destruction in a sacred grove
called Hoddmimir's Holt, <span id="fr_367"></span>[5](#fn_367.md) which M.
Darmesteter calls the 'bois Hoddmimir équivalent du frène
Yggdrasil,' <span id="fr_368"></span>[6](#fn_368.md) a statement that is
correct in a certain sense but not absolutely. Hoddmimir signifies
'Circle-Mimir' or 'Sphere-Mimir,' that

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

is to say, the physical Mimir <span id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_369.md) or
ocean like the Midhgardhsormr (Great-sea-serpent), encircles the earth,
and when the latter is consumed Lifthrasir and Lif are safely conveyed
across ocean to the far ocean-grove, which we find in Homer;—'When thou
hast sailed in the ship across the stream Okeanos \[Hoddmimir\], where
are groves of Persephoneia \[the Queen of the Underworld\], poplars and
willows.' <span id="fr_370"></span>[2](#fn_370.md) Stesichoros, <span
id="fr_371"></span>[3](#fn_371.md) B.C. 632-552, tells how Halios (Eëlios,
Helios), Hyperiôn's son, *i.e.*, son of the Climbing Sun of morning,
like the Vedic Yama found out the way to the happy world which is in the
west; and sailed in his golden boat-cup, which he afterwards lent to his
'dedoublement' Herakles, o’er ocean to see his dear ones in the sacred
laurel <span id="fr_372"></span>[4](#fn_372.md) grove; and Mr. Ruskin,
following Pindar, <span id="fr_373"></span>[5](#fn_373.md) tells us that
the Greeks 'had sometimes a prophet to tell them of a land "where there
is sun alike by day and alike by night, where they shall need no more to
trouble the earth by strength of hands for daily bread, but the ocean
breezes blow around the blessed islands, and golden flowers burn on
their *bright trees* for evermore."' <span
id="fr_374"></span>[6](#fn_374.md) These abodes form the western Garden of
the Hesperides, where are the golden solar apples of life that resemble
the fruit shown on the Conventional Tree, and were guarded in the unseen

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

world by the 'monster serpent or dragon' of darkness which, like the
Norse Nidhoggr ('Gnawing serpent') coils around the roots of the Sacred
Tree. These sacred trees appear rudely marked on many of the whorls
found by Dr. Schliemann on the site of Troy, <span
id="fr_375"></span>[1](#fn_375.md) and the solar Dionysos as the renewer of
the life and growth of the earth, is Dendrites, <span
id="fr_376"></span>[2](#fn_376.md) 'Lord-of-the-Tree,' in accordance with
the imagery of the Hebrew poet-prophet, 'As the days of a tree are the
days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their
hands.' <span id="fr_377"></span>[3](#fn_377.md) Palm trees grew around the
sacred 'square enclosure' of Perseus at Khemi 'in the Thebaic
canton;' <span id="fr_378"></span>[4](#fn_378.md) and the circumstance
connects this Perseus with the Semitic and Persian East. <span
id="fr_379"></span>[5](#fn_379.md) The Sacred Grove with poplaresque trees
appeared in reality within the *temenos* of many Kamic temples. It is
unnecessary to add further instances.

The myth is not either specially Aryan or specially Semitic, and the
Tree represents the principle of life, whilst the whole Kosmos is
regarded as a mighty tree; but life is constantly being renewed from
sources secret and invisible to us, especially from the Underworld,
which not only represents 'the fatness of the earth beneath,' but is the
'highly mysterious cavern' where the great solar-light-bringer and
life-stimulator perpetually returns. Hence, in this unknown region which
the living tread not and where the sources of life are treasured up,
there must by

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

analogy be a Tree (the earthly symbol of life), trees. a grove, a happy
garden, a paradise, <span id="fr_380"></span>[1](#fn_380.md) 'where souls
do couch on flowers,' for man ends not at death; and in this Tree the
expiring Crescent-moon, caught by her horn, pales and dies before the
Sun as he goeth forth in his strength. All discord is 'harmony not
understood;' the apparent contest of nature is in reality but the
tranquil course of nature.

'Aye keeping their eternal track,  
   The deities of old  
Went to and fro, and there and back,  
   In boats of starry gold.' <span id="fr_381"></span>[2](#fn_381.md)

The sun is established for ever, the moon is 'a faithful witness in
heaven,' the dragon-darkness is trampled under the feet of light; <span
id="fr_382"></span>[3](#fn_382.md) nay, the scorpion of night, subdued to
peacefulness, guards the hidden sun through the hours of gloom; and man,
recognising his covenant-keeping Creator, thanks God and takes courage.

For, as is the world without, so is the world within; and the storms and
splendours of nature find

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

apt parallels in the conflicts and glories of the Soul, 'greatest of
things created.' <span id="fr_383"></span>[1](#fn_383.md) Individual
circumstances, if either distinctly happy or the reverse, tend somewhat
to confuse the mental vision; we can get but one view of a particular
prospect from one place, and we can be but in one place at a time. Yet
however we may bend and reel beneath the blast of circumstance, nay, may
'falter where we firmly trod,' still, to use the noble words of a living
sage, 'in health the mind is presently seen again—its overarching vault
bright with galaxies of immutable lights, and the warm loves and fears
that swept over us as clouds, must lose their finite character and blend
with God, to attain their own perfection. But we need not fear that we
can lose anything by the progress of the \[noble\] soul. That which is
so beautiful \[alike in nature and in man\] must be succeeded and
supplanted only by what is more beautiful, and so on for ever.'

Gilbert's picture *Fair St. George*, we read; 'Smiting the dragon with
his \[solar\] spear \[of light\], he was sorely wounded and thrown down.
Then St. George called to the Princess \[his love and bride the Dawn\]
to bind her girdle \[cf. the *Kredemnon* of Inô, sec. VIII.\] about the
dragon's neck and not to be afeared. The dragon followed as it had been
a meek beast and debonayre.' Day and night, light and darkness,
contended no longer; kosmic order was restored, and 'the raven-down of
darkness' was 'smoothed' 'till it smiled.'
