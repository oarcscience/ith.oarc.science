# THE UNICORN:

##### A MYTHOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.

### SECTION I.

#### THE HERALDIC UNICORN.

THE science of Heraldry has faithfully preserved to modern times various
phases of some of those remarkable legends, which, based upon a study of
natural phenomena, exhibit the process whereby the greater part of
mythology has come into existence. There we find the solar
Gryphon, <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0) the solar Phoenix, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) 'a demi-eagle displayed issuing from flames
of fire,' <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2) the solar Lion, and the
lunar Unicorn, which two latter noble creatures now harmoniously support
the Royal Arms. I propose in the following pages to examine the myth of
the Unicorn, the wild, white, fierce, chaste Moon, whose two horns,
unlike those of mortal creatures, are indissolubly twisted into one;

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

the creature that endlessly fights with the Lion to gain the crown
(κορυφή) or summit of heaven which neither may retain, and whose
brilliant horn drives away the darkness and evil of the night, even as
we find in the myth that 'venym is defended by the horn of an
Vnicorne.' <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3) As the Moon rules the sea
and water, <span id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4) so the horn of the Unicorn
is said to purify the streams and pools, and we are told that other
animals will not drink until this purification is made; for the Unicorn
ere he slakes his thirst, like the sinking Moon, dips his horn in water.
As the Moon, Artemis-Selenê, is the 'queen and huntress, chaste and
fair,' so is 'the maiden Unicorne' <span id="fr_5"></span>[3](#fn_5) 'in
the Classical and Middle Ages the emblem of chastity.' <span
id="fr_6"></span>[4](#fn_6) 'Their inviolable attachment to virginity,
has occasioned them to become the guardian hieroglyphic of that
virtue.' <span id="fr_7"></span>[5](#fn_7) According to Upton, quoted by
Dallaway, the Unicorn 'capitur cum arte mirabili. Puella virgo in sylva
proponitur solaque relinquitur, qui adveniens depolita omni ferocitate
casti corporis pudicitiam in virgine veneratur, caputque suum in sinu
puellae imponit, sicque soperatus deprehenditur a venatoribus et
occiditur, vel in regali palatio ad spectandum exhibetur.'

Dallaway conjectures that 'the tester or armour for horses’ heads in the
centre of which a long spike was fixed, suggested the idea of a beast so
defended

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

by nature.' With respect to this view it may suffice to remark that the
Unicorn is found on the archaic Cylinder-seals of Babylonia and
Assyria, <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8) as well as on the Horn of
Ulf, <span id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9) whereas 'the *Chanfron* with a
spike projecting from it was adopted in 1467; probably this is the
earliest date.' <span id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_10) The Testiere is
first mentioned in the time of Edward I., and '*Chanfron* or
*Champfreins*, pieces of steel or leather to cover the horse's
face,' <span id="fr_11"></span>[4](#fn_11) came into vogue about the end
of the thirteenth century. *Chanfrous* is an obsolete north-country term
meaning very fierce. <span id="fr_12"></span>[5](#fn_12)

The Lion is the only animal that appears on the shields in *The Roll of
Arms known as the Roll of King Henry III.*; the Unicorn, however,
although not found on any shield in *The Roll of Karlaverok*, is
mentioned by the herald who composed the MS. *Siege de Karlaverok*, now
in the British Museum. He says:—

The Gryphon, it may be observed, appears in the Roll as a Charge:—

Sir Harris Nicholas observes that 'the exploit which is said to have
been performed by the Earl Marshall at Constantinople in slaying a
unicorn, which probably referred to a tradition familiar at the time of
some deed of one of the Marshall family in the Holy Land,' is not
'elsewhere commemorated.' <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15)

In opposition to the opinion that the Unicorn could be captured by means
of the stratagem above mentioned, it was more generally held that, like
the Gryphon, <span id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16) 'the Unicorne is never
taken alive; and the reason being demanded, it is answered, that the
greatnesse of his mind is such, that he choseth rather to die than to be
taken alive.' <span id="fr_17"></span>[4](#fn_17) The real reason why
both Gryphon and Unicorn are safe from capture is sufficiently obvious.

Cnut is said amongst other 'naval devices,' to have 'exhibited unicorns,
centaurs, dragons, lions, dolphins, and human figures. The swift
unicorn, either Anglo-Saxon or Dane, was obliged to fly before the two
Norman leopards \[or perhaps "lions" <span
id="fr_18"></span>[5](#fn_18)\]. Hence

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

the naturalization of the emblematical unicorn in Scotland, and its
return into England under the Stuart dynasty.' <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19)

'The earliest extant example of the unicorn as a supporter in the royal
arms of Scotland, appears to be that which occurs in the royal
achievement carved above the gateway of Rothsay Castle. The Lyon king of
arms, who examined it carefully last summer, told me that this carving
appeared to him to be contemporaneous with the part of the building in
which it is inserted, which, considering the style of the architecture
and various entries in the Exchequer Rolls relative to the building of
Rothsay Castle, he was disposed to assign to the time of Robert II. or
III. \[1380-1400\]. In 1486 or 1487 two gold coins were struck, value
respectively 18*s*. and 9*s*., and called the unicorn and half-unicorn,
from the circumstance that they bore on one side the figure of a unicorn
sejant supporting the royal escutcheon. In the same reign—that of James
III.—we first find unicorn pursuivant.' <span
id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20)

The following instances (amongst many) exhibit the Unicorn as a Charge:—

The Arms of Sir John Rest, Lord Mayor of London in 1516, are Azure, on a
Fess, between 3 Crosses Milroine, Or, a Unicorn couchant, Gules. This
position of the Unicorn is very unusual. Mythologically, the bronze-red
setting Moon.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

The Family of Harling bore Argent, a Unicorn Sejant, Sable;
mythologically, the Moon in eclipse.

The Family of Musterton bore Gules, a Unicorn with dexter leg raised,
*i.e.*, tripping, Argent; mythologically, 'the Moon walking in
brightness.' <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21)

The Family of Farrington bore Sable, 3 Unicorns, Current, Argent, 1 & 1
& 1; mythologically, the wild white Moon of triple aspect, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22) flying through the dark clouds.

The Family of Shelley bore Gules, 3 Unicorn's heads couped, by 2 & 1.

The Tincture of the Unicorn is generally Argent, *i.e.*, the ordinary
colour of the Moon, Leukotheê, 'the White-goddess,' <span
id="fr_23"></span>[3](#fn_23) the Semitic Lebhânâ, the Pale-shiner, as
distinguished from the burning, golden Tammuz-Adonis, the Akkadian
Dumuzi or 'Only-son' of the diurnal heaven.' <span
id="fr_24"></span>[4](#fn_24) 'The proper colour of the moon we in
Heraldry take to be Argent, both for the weakness of the light, and also
for the distinction betwixt the blazoning of it and the Sun; and
therefore when we blazon by Planets, we name Gold *Sol*, and Silver
*Luna*.' <span id="fr_25"></span>[5](#fn_25)

One or two Crests in which the Unicorn appears are of special interest
inasmuch as most archaic ideas seem to have been unconsciously preserved
in them. Thus:—

The Crest of the Bickerstaff Family is the Sun with sable rays (*i.e.*,
the nocturnal sun), surmounted

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

by a Unicorn rampant, *i.e.*, the nightly triumph of the Moon over the
Sun. In a variant form of this device the Unicorn is statant.

The Crest of the Curteis Family is a Unicorn passant, between four
trees; mythologically, a most interesting allusion to the archaic myth
of the Grove of the Underworld. <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26)

The Heraldic Moon is either Increscent, *i.e.*, the new moon with horns
turned towards the dexter side of the shield; in Complement, *i.e.*, the
full moon; Decrescent, *i.e.*, the waning moon with horns turned towards
the sinister side of the shield; or in Detriment, *i.e.*, when
eclipsed. <span id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27) In this state it is
emblazoned Sable. The Face in the Orb <span
id="fr_28"></span>[3](#fn_28) is shown at times.

James I. introduced the (Scottish) Unicorn, argent, as the Sinister
Supporter of the Royal Arms; and Guillim describes the Arms of Charles
I. as 'supported by a *Lyon* rampand, SOL: and an *Unicorn*,
LUNA.' <span id="fr_29"></span>[4](#fn_29)
