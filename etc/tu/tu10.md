### SECTION VIII.

#### INÔ AND MELIKERTES.

IN the myth of Inô and Melikertes we see no longer opposition between
Day and Night, Sun and Moon, but kosmic harmony, the
crescent-moon-goddess with the young sun in her arms. Inô, the daughter
of Kadmos the 'Easterner,' <span id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_243.md) is
married to Athamas, 'in Ionic Tammas,' <span
id="fr_244"></span>[2](#fn_244.md) the Phoenician Tammuz, <span
id="fr_245"></span>[3](#fn_245.md) the Akkadian Dumuzi, 'the Only-son,'
*i.e.*, the solitary Sun-god, Melqarth, who goes forth to hunt
alone. <span id="fr_246"></span>[4](#fn_246.md) By him she becomes the
mother of Melikertes, the Phoenician Melqarth, or 'City-king;' his
reduplication—the sun of the next day; and when the raging
Athamas—Herakles Mainomenos—in madness slays his eldest child by Inô,
the latter with the infant Melikertes, leaps into the sea, and is
subsequently known as Leukotheê, 'the White-goddess.' The obscure name
Inô is probably a variant of Iuno, Juno, and from being a phase of Hêrê,
'the Gleaming-heaven,' she becomes the Queen-of-heaven, Lebhânâ, 'the
Pale-shiner,'

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

the White-moon-goddess, the horned Astartê, and as such she assists the
storm-tossed Odysseus with her headband (*Kredemnon*), a moon-scarf of
the lunar rays. <span id="fr_247"></span>[1](#fn_247.md) Such is 'Inô
with-beautiful-ankle,' 'the moon walking in brightness,' whose kindly
unicorn-horn drives away noxious things; the fostering mother who, like
a Juno Matuta, nurtures the young Sun-god Dionysos, who is identical
with Melqarth (Melek, Molekh), after the death of his own mother
Semelê, <span id="fr_248"></span>[2](#fn_248.md) he being the chief of 'the
precious things put forth by the moon.' Not far from the Phoenician
settlement in Kythera <span id="fr_249"></span>[3](#fn_249.md) was 'a
temple and oracle of Inô. They prophesy when asleep, since the goddess
answers those who consult her by dreams. Water, pleasant to drink, flows
from a sacred fount, and they call it the Fount of the Moon.' <span
id="fr_250"></span>[4](#fn_250.md) According to an MS. Neo-Platonik
Commentary of Olympiodoros on the *Phaidôn*, 'Inô is water, being
marine.' Here is a preservation of a faint shadow of the truth, for the
connexion between the moon and water is obvious; but the theory of
Olympiodoros that the four daughters of Kadmos represent the four
(so-called) elements, may be paralleled with the modern view of

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rolle, <span
id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) that they represent the four stages of
intoxication. <span id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_252.md) The leap of Inô with
the child into the sea was localised at the rock Molyris near
Megara, <span id="fr_253"></span>[3](#fn_253.md) whence Melikertes was said
to have been carried on a dolphin, like Apollôn Delphinios, the
Fish-sun, to Korinth, here he had a curious labyrinthine shrine. <span
id="fr_254"></span>[4](#fn_254.md)

remarks of Leukotheê that her 'name proclaims her as the open and
glaring day' (*Introd*. 217). But the Glaring-day does not fly from the
Raging-sun, or hold the Infant-sun in her arms; and is no more a
nursing, nurturing mother than Athamas is such a sire.
