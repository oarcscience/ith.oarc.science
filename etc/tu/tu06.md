### SECTION IV.

#### DEUS LUNUS.

THE moon-power, owing to the influence of the Greek Artemis-Selênê, the
Latin Diana-Luna, is generally feminine in our thoughts; but this
aspect, though also occasionally occurring elsewhere, *e.g.*, in Peru,
is really exceptional. Thus among the Germanic nations the moon is
masculine and the sun feminine. It is the daughter of Sôl, the Norse
Sun-goddess, who in the regenerated world 'shall ride on her mother's
track when the gods are dead'; <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_131.md) and
it is the god Mâni, <span id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_132.md) who at
Ragnarok, 'the-Twilight-of-the-gods,' shall be devoured by the Wolf of
darkness, Managarmr, 'Moon-swallower,' a reduplication of the terrible
wolf Fenrir. <span id="fr_133"></span>[3](#fn_133.md)

In Egypt again, 'Chons is the personification of the moon, and in this
character he is called Chonsaah or Chons the moon. His name seems to
mean

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "the chaser," or
"pursuer,"' <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134.md) the Unicorn who, as we
shall see, <span id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_135.md) chases the Lion-sun.
Another Kamic-lunar personage is Teti (Thoth), the weighing and
measuring god, lord of knowledge and writing. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_136.md) 'The crescent is found followed by the
figure of Thoth in several hieroglyphic legends, with the phonetic name
Aah.' <span id="fr_137"></span>[4](#fn_137.md)

'The Arabs to this day, consider the moon masculine, and not
feminine.' <span id="fr_138"></span>[5](#fn_138.md)

'In Sanskrit the most current names for the moon, such as Kandra, Soma,
Indu, Vidhu, are masculine. The names of the moon are frequently used in
the sense of month, and these and other names for month retain the same
gender.' <span id="fr_139"></span>[6](#fn_139.md)

In Asia Minor was widely established the cult of the Moon-god Mên, <span
id="fr_140"></span>[7](#fn_140.md) the Lunus of the Romans, who, to a great
extent suppressed his ritual.

The Babylonian and Assyrian Moon-god is Sin, <span
id="fr_141"></span>[8](#fn_141.md) whose name probably appears in Sinai.
The expression, 'From the origin of the god Sin,' was used by the
Assyrians to mark remote antiquity; because as chaos preceded order, so
night preceded day, and the enthronement of the moon as the Night-king
marks the commencement of the annals of kosmic order.

The Akkadian Moon-god, who corresponds with

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

the Semitic Sin, is Aku, 'the Seated-father,' as chief supporter of
kosmic order, styled 'the-Maker-of-brightness,' En-zuna,
'the-Lord-of-growth,' and Idu, the-Measuring-lord,' <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142.md) the Aïdês of Hesychios. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_143.md) *Idu* is the equivalent of the Assyrian
*Arkhu*, 'month,' Heb. *Yerakh*; and is expressed in archaic Babylonian
by the ideograph <span id="img_03500"></span> ![](img/03500.jpg) = the
circle, (solar or) lunar + <span id="img_03501"></span>
![](img/03501.jpg) (10 + 10 + 10), *i.e.*, the thirty days of the month.
<span id="img_03501"></span> ![](img/03501.jpg) also stands for the
Moon-god as the god-thirty. Amongst the Finns Kuu is 'the male god of
the moon,' <span id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_144.md) and exactly corresponds
with A-ku. It is singular to find also Kua as a moon-name in Central
Africa. <span id="fr_145"></span>[4](#fn_145.md)

'Among the Mbocobis of South America, the moon is a man and the sun his
wife.' <span id="fr_146"></span>[5](#fn_146.md)

Amongst the Mexicans, Metztli, the Moon, was a hero. <span
id="fr_147"></span>[6](#fn_147.md)

According to an Australian legend, 'Mityan, the Moon, was a native cat
\[male\], who fell in love with some one else's wife, and was driven
away to wander ever since.' <span id="fr_148"></span>[7](#fn_148.md)

'The Khasias of the Himalaya say that the moon \[male\] falls monthly in
love with his mother-in-law, who throws ashes in his face, whence his
spots.' <span id="fr_149"></span>[8](#fn_149.md)

Ra Vula, the Figian Moon, is male. <span id="fr_150"></span>[9](#fn_150.md)

The Ahts of Vancouver's Island regard 'the Moon as husband and the Sun
as wife.' <span id="fr_151"></span>[10](#fn_151.md)

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

In Japan 'the Moon-god was worshipped under the form of a fox.' <span
id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_152.md)

The Unicorn is represented as male, being 'maiden' with respect to
chastity. <span id="fr_153"></span>[2](#fn_153.md)
