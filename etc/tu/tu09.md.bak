### SECTION VII.

#### MEDOUSA THE GORGÔ.

FROM the Triple-moon and the Unicorn-horse-moon I pass on to the
Serpentine-full-moon, the victim of the solar Perseus, another version
of the oft-recurring story. Careful study of the Homerik Poems reveals
the intrinsically archaic nature and high antiquity of the majority of
their ideas, and in the consideration of any mythic personage a passage
in Homer, if available, almost always supplies an excellent
starting-point. It is generally, but not quite accurately stated that
'Homer knows only one Gorgo.' The passages are as follows;—

'On it \[the *aigis* of Athenaiê\] was a Gorgeian head of a dreadful
portent.' <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186.md)

'Hektôr, having the eyes of a Gorgô.' <span
id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_187.md)

'An awful-looking Gorgô' <span id="fr_188"></span>[3](#fn_188.md) was the
device upon the shield of Agamemnôn.

Odysseus fears 'lest Persephoneia from Hades should send a Gorgeian head
of a dreadful portent.' <span id="fr_189"></span>[4](#fn_189.md)

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

From these passages we gather:—

1\. That whilst there was certainly one Gorgô, there may also have been
others.

2\. That its eye constituted the chief terror of the appearance. <span
id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_190.md)

3\. That this appearance, originally portentous, <span
id="fr_191"></span>[2](#fn_191.md) became, or was considered to be,
monstrous. <span id="fr_192"></span>[3](#fn_192.md)

4\. That, though having a bright eye, it is connected with Darkness and
the Underworld. And

5\. Was used heraldically as arms upon a shield.

Fick would connect the obscure word Gorgô with the European root *garg*,
'to cry,' and compares the Sk. *garj*, 'to emit a deep sound;' <span
id="fr_193"></span>[4](#fn_193.md) but the idea of sound is so truly out of
place in the myth (a circumstance which we are bound to consider), that
I am compelled to reject this derivation. I had deemed the term as
possibly an intensive variant of *orgê*, 'natural impulse,' primarily
'swelling' (first physics, then meta-physics), as applied to the
swollen, full-faced Moon; for from Homer alone it is not very

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

difficult to gather that Gorgô = Luna. But the detail of a myth is the
true test by which to try various etymologies of the name of its
protagonist, especially when in the abstract several distinct
derivations appear to have an almost equal claim to acceptance. Now the
Gorgon-power (as will more fully appear) = Nocturnal-darkness + Moon,
not darkness merely or the moon merely. Darkness, it will be remembered,
is frequently (like Chaos) depicted in monstrous form; but especially is
it a Devourer or Swallower. <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_194.md) The
Proto-Aryan root *gar*, 'to swallow, gulp,' appears in the intensive
form *gargar*, <span id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_195.md) the Gk. variant of
which would be Gorgô, the earliest form of the word in that language.
Gorgô is 'the Swallower,' the devouring darkness which has a bright
head—the Moon, a head capable of being cut off. Hence the combined
beauty and horror (hideousness) of the Gorgô, a hideousness which does
not arise in the first instance from the lunar-serpent-rays, and hence
*the open mouth*, so marked a feature in the Gorgoneion and one not in
the least lunar. Mr. Dennis observes;—

The most remarkable type on the coins of Populonia is the Gorgoneion;
not here "the head of the fair-cheeked Medusa" <span
id="fr_196"></span>[3](#fn_196.md)—

"A woman's countenance with serpent locks,"

as it is represented by the sculptors of later Greece

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

and of Etruria; but a monstrous fiend-like visage, with snaky hair,
gnashing tusks, and tongue lolling out of

"The open mouth that seemed to containe  
 A good full peck within the utmost brim,  
 Appearing *like the mouth* of Orcus griesly grim." <span
id="fr_197"></span>[1](#fn_197.md)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> From this open
mouth issue two huge curved teeth, the lunar horns. The protruded tongue
and gnashing teeth were familiar to the author (probably Hesiod <span
id="fr_198"></span>[2](#fn_198).md) of the *Aspis Herakleous*. <span
id="fr_199"></span>[3](#fn_199.md) And this leads us to the Hesiodik phase
of the myth, according to which <span id="fr_200"></span>[4](#fn_200.md)
there are three Gorgones (= Hekatê Triformis), Medousa 'the Ruler' (=
the King or Queen-moon), Stheinô or Sthenô 'the Strong' (= the general
Nocturnal-potency), and Euryalê 'the Wide-wandering' (= the Moon
'wandering companionless' <span id="fr_201"></span>[5](#fn_201).md), a
phase which corresponds with the solar Bellerophôn in the same Aleian
Field. <span id="fr_202"></span>[6](#fn_202.md) Do not hastily charge the
intricate myth with inconsistency. The Night is dark and not-dark, lunar
and not-lunar; and so is the Gorgô; so are the Gorgones. And that the
Gorgô is one as well as three, is shown clearly by a writer as late as

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Euripides. <span
id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_203.md) The home of the Gorgones lies as of
course in or beyond the western darkness; <span
id="fr_204"></span>[2](#fn_204.md) with the Euemerism which first connected
them with Libyê <span id="fr_205"></span>[3](#fn_205.md) as a western
region, and has subsequently identified them with apes of some kind,
gorilla or ourang-oötan, I am not here concerned. An early Vase shows
the solar Herakles, who for the purpose is the equivalent of the solar
Perseus, 'killing the threefold Gorgon.' <span
id="fr_206"></span>[4](#fn_206.md)

As Hekatê is Perseis or Perseia <span id="fr_207"></span>[5](#fn_207.md)
and daughter of Perses, so Hekatos is Perseus, 'the solar hero, son of
Zeus (heaven), in the form of a gleaming golden shower, and his son
Perses is the mythic sire of the Persians, the lords of the
"sun-stricken plains" <span id="fr_208"></span>[6](#fn_208.md) of the
East.' <span id="fr_209"></span>[7](#fn_209.md) Perseus naturally engages
to attack the Gorgô as the Lion the Unicorn; and assisted by

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Athenê (the
Dawn-light) and Hermes (the Wind-power upon the clouds <span
id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_210).md), sets forth upon the perilous
expedition. The helmet of Hades ('the Unseen') renders him invisible,
*i.e.* the condition of the Nocturnal-sun as concealed in the
Underworld; and from the two Graiai <span
id="fr_211"></span>[2](#fn_211.md) he seizes the solar eye <span
id="fr_212"></span>[3](#fn_212.md) and lunar tooth, <span
id="fr_213"></span>[4](#fn_213.md) which he will not restore until they
tell him where to find the implements necessary to complete his task.
This eye and tooth the sisters are wont to hand from one to the other,
*i.e.* from morn to eve, from eve to morn. The hero having obtained the
other requisites, 'Hermes added the knife (*harpê*) with which he had
cut off the head of Argos;' <span id="fr_214"></span>[5](#fn_214.md) and
this same potency which put out the starry eyes, now puts out the lunar
eye, or, to change the imagery, cuts off the bright head of the dark
Gorgô; but the light veiled for a moment, soon reappears on the *aigis*
of the

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dawn-queen. The
Sun has done the deed—technically called the Gorgotomy—but he has to
fly, pursued by Euryalê, the Reappearing-moon; and Stheinô, whom Sir G.
W. Cox well describes as 'the eternal abyss of darkness.' <span
id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_215.md) The petrifying stare of Medousa is the
moon-glare on the darkness when the colour, sound, and motion of the
world of day have gone.

This myth alone might well form the subject of a monograph, but I can
"here only notice one other of its many incidents—the weapon of Perseus,
the *harpê*, in shape a sickle or scimetar. Now the tradition that this
was the special weapon used on the occasion, is a very ancient one, for
Pherekydes, B.C. 540, who 'according to the concurrent testimony of
antiquity was the teacher of Pythagoras,' and 'did not receive
instruction from any master but obtained his knowledge from the secret
books of the Phoenicians,' <span id="fr_216"></span>[2](#fn_216.md)
expressly names it as used by Perseus in the Gorgotomy. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[3](#fn_217.md) It is the same 'portentous sickle'
(πελώριον ἅρπην) which Kronos took in his right hand when he assailed
Ouranos, <span id="fr_218"></span>[4](#fn_218.md) for one of 'his peculiar
adjuncts is the crescent-shaped sickle, which he somewhat singularly
holds over his head in a scene where he is

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

receiving from Rhea the stone supposed to be Zeus.' <span
id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_219.md) Lastly, we find that 'the scimetar with
which Merodach \[or Bel\] is armed \[when about to fight with the
Dragon\] is shown by the cylinders and bas-reliefs to have been of the
shape of a sickle, and is therefore \[as had also occurred to me\] the
same as the *harpê* or *khereb* with which the hero Perseus was
armed.' <span id="fr_220"></span>[2](#fn_220.md) Now Bel and Merodach fight
against chaos and also against darkness, and the chief weapon of the god
who maintains nocturnal kosmic order is, as of course, the sickle-shaped
moon. Perseus, in accordance with the Principle of Reduplication above
noticed, armed with the crescent-moon cuts off the Gorgô-head or
full-moon; just as another mighty Babylonio-Akkadian divinity is
described as being armed with the sun. <span
id="fr_221"></span>[3](#fn_221.md) It is evident therefore that Perseus,
who was supposed to have slain the sea-monster at Joppa, and who in a
passage of Herodotos, difficult to explain, is said to have had a temple
and ritual in Egypt, <span id="fr_222"></span>[4](#fn_222.md) was more or
less connected with the non-Aryan East. Lenormant <span
id="fr_223"></span>[5](#fn_223.md) gives an extract from a Babylonian
Fragment of which he says, 'C’est le prototype de l’histoire de Persée
et d’Andromède;' and he thinks that Perseus may be another variant form
of the word represented by the Parsoudos of

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ktesias, and is
therefore in origin a Babylonian name. Very likely; but I do not doubt
that it is also an Aryan name, that is to say, here probably, as in many
other instances, an Aryan and a non-Aryan name, of somewhat similar
sound, have become united like a double star. The sire of
Andromedê, <span id="fr_224"></span>[1](#fn_224.md) Kepheus the Aithiop
king and son of Belos, <span id="fr_225"></span>[2](#fn_225.md) is a
personage altogether non-Aryan and Euphratean; and Hellanikos, B.C.
490-10, chief of the Greek logographers, mentions Kepheus and the
Kephenians (Ethiopians or Kushites) in connexion with Babylon. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[3](#fn_226.md)

Lastly, in the dread Gorgô, originally Darkness + Moon, then more
distinctly lunar, we have the origin of the myth of the Face in the
Moon. We know otherwise that this myth was archaic, for Epigenes of
Sikyôn, 'the most ancient writer of tragedy,' <span
id="fr_227"></span>[4](#fn_227.md) in a lost work called *The Poetry of
Orpheus*, says that the Theologer called 'the moon Gorgonian on account
of the face in it;' <span id="fr_228"></span>[5](#fn_228.md) and Serapiôn,
an Alexandrine physician of the third century B.C., thought that 'the
Face seen in the moon is the soul of the Sibylla.' <span
id="fr_229"></span>[6](#fn_229.md)

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> According to the
doctrine set forth by Plutarch, <span id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_230.md)
evil souls, on attempting to enter the tranquil lunar region, are driven
away by the dread Face in the Orb. <span id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_231.md)

With respect to Gorgonian art, Sir G. Wilkinson is of opinion that 'the
monster Medusa evidently derived its form from the common Typhonian
figure of Egypt;' <span id="fr_232"></span>[3](#fn_232.md) and M.
Clermont-Ganneau, in a most interesting work, has elaborated a theory
which connects a beautiful female Gorgon with Hathor and Tanit, and a
hideous male Gorgon with the Kamic Bes. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[4](#fn_233.md)

Speaking of Etruscan temple-tombs, Mr. Dennis observes, 'The pediments
terminate on each side in a volute, within which is a grim, grinning
face, *with prominent teeth*, a Gorgon's head, a common sepulchral
decoration.' <span id="fr_234"></span>[5](#fn_234.md) On the hollowed
bottom of the famous Etruscan bronze lamp in the Museum of Cortona is 'a
huge Gorgon's face, all horror. The visage of a fiend, *with eyes
starting from their sockets, a mouth stretched to its utmost, with
gnashing tusks*—and the whole rendered more terrible by a wreath of
serpents bristling around it.' <span id="fr_235"></span>[6](#fn_235.md)
Well may Mr. Dennis add, 'It is a libel on the fair face of Dian, to say
that this hideous visage symbolises the moon.' This difficulty I have
fully explained.

On the ceiling of a chamber in the cemetery of Perugia is 'an enormous
Gorgon's head, hewn from

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

the dark rock, with eyes upturned in horror, gleaming from the gloom,
*teeth bristling whitely in the open mouth*, wings on the temples, and
snakes knotted over the brow.' <span id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_236.md) The
Etruscans evidently fully shared in the Akkadian horror of darkness.

On the back of the late Mr. Cooper's edition of Lenormant's *Chaldean
Magic* is represented (I presume from some Chaldean original) a
Gorgoneion, apparently a black face, radiate, with wide and open
grinning mouth. This presents a remarkable combination of moon and
darkness.

Greek vases were occasionally moulded in the shape of the leg of
Gorgô. <span id="fr_237"></span>[2](#fn_237.md) A Vase in the British
Museum <span id="fr_238"></span>[3](#fn_238.md) shows a Gorgô in connexion
with Lions. She holds upon either side a lion by the fore paw; the lions
standing on their hind legs, fling back their heads. The design may of
course be mere sportive art, but it appears to be Assyrian in
origin <span id="fr_239"></span>[4](#fn_239.md) and may signify the
Gorgonian Night stationed harmoniously between two leonine Days.

Another Vase <span id="fr_240"></span>[5](#fn_240.md) shows Perseus,
wearing the *petasos* and *talaria*, plunging the *harpê*, which he
holds in his right hand, into the neck of the Gorgô, who has four wings,
two snakes on each side of her head, and two round her waist. 'Her face
has the usual Gorgon type, with curls symmetrically ranged \[an Assyrian
characteristic\], and a wide, open mouth showing the

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

teeth and tongue.' Another Vase <span id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_241.md)
shows the rare design of Perseus flying over the Libyan mountains,
pursued by Stheinô and Euryalê. 'The wild pursuit of the immortal
Gorgons seems to be the chase of Darkness after the bright Sun who, with
his golden sandals, just escapes their grasp as he soars into the
peaceful morning sky.' <span id="fr_242"></span>[2](#fn_242.md)

In Canon Spano's very interesting work, *Mnemosine Sarda ossia Ricordi e
memorie di varii Monumenti Antichi con altre rarita dell’ isola de
Sardegna* (Cagliari, 1864), several good examples of the Gorgon-type are
given, the most remarkable of which shows three Gorgon-faces radiate,
with open mouths and protruded tongues, in a circle—the lunar orb. Here
the three Gorgon sisters are connected with the one Moon.

Medousa, queen of the inhabitants near the Tritonian Lake, when opposing
the Peloponnesian army of Perseus, was slain in the night by stratagem.
Perseus admiring her beauty, cut off her head to show it to the Greeks.
Pausanias himself, however, prefers the account given by Proklos a
Karthaginian, that Medousa was one of the wild men and women of Africa
who, wandering northwards and assailing the inhabitants, was slain by
Perseus, who is said to have been assisted by Athena because the goddess
is worshipped near the Tritonian Lake. (For a notice of Athenê
Tritogenaia, and the family of the Vedic Trita, vide R. B. Jr.,
*Poseidon*, sec. xx.) Medousa having thus become a wild woman, it is
only another step to turn her into a gorilla, and this has been taken by
the learned Dr. Levezon of Berlin.

gray from their birth'—how wonderfully the myth describes the fact—can
originally have been but two.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[52:3](tu09.htm#fr_212.md) This is an instance of
the Principle of Reduplication in myths, for of course Perseus himself
is the solar eye. Similarly Herakles with his arrows attacks Helios.
These incidents are frequently the necessary results of
anthropomorphism. As Mr. F. A. Paley remarks, 'It is the unconscious
blending of two modes of representation' (*Origin of Solar Myths*, in

<span id="fn_213"></span>[52:4](tu09.htm#fr_213.md) Here the tooth is most
