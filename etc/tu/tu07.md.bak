### SECTION V.

#### THE LUNAR PHASES.

THE succession of apparent alterations in the form of the moon presents
a phenomenon so remarkable as necessarily to have attracted the
attention and careful observation of man from the earliest period. With
the Greeks the phases were named;—

I. The New Moon. *Noumênia*, which because in the same line or path with
the Sun, is called Synodos.

II\. The Young Moon. *Nea Selênê*. Time in the month, *Protê Phasis*,
'the First Appearance;' a slender crescent seen a short time after
sunset.

III\. The Increasing Crescent. *Hexagônos*, 'Six-angled,' as having run
1/6th of its course.

IV\. The Half Moon. *Hemitomos*, 'Cut-in-twain.' <span
id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154.md) Also called *Tetragônos*, as having four
equal angles in its circuit, ¼th of which it has now passed.

V. The Increasing Moon. *Amphikurtos*, 'Curved- on-each-side.' Also
called *Trigônos*, 'Triangular,' for were an equilateral triangle drawn
from its starting-point, the present position would be the apex, ⅓rd of
its course being now passed.

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

VI\. The Full Moon. *Panselênos*. Also called *Dichomênia*, the
'Month-divider.'

VII\. The Decreasing Moon. *Amphikurtos*, *Trigonos*.

VIII\. The Second Half-Moon. *Hemitomos*, etc.

IX\. The Decreasing Crescent. *Menoeidês*, 'Crescent-shaped,' Lat.
*Lunatus*.

X. The Old Moon. *Enê Selênê*. Time in the month,—*Eschatê Phasis*, 'the
Last Appearance.' A slender crescent.

The corresponding Latin names are;—

I. The New Moon. *Novilunium*, which being invisible is called *Luna
Silens*, and the time styled *Congressus cum Sole*.

II\. The Young Moon. *Nova Luna*. Period,—*Prima Phasis*.

III\. The Increasing Crescent. *Primus sextilis aspectus*.

IV\. The Half Moon. *Luna dividua, semiplena, bisecta*. *Prima
quadratura*.

V. The Increasing Moon. *Luna gibba*, 'the Humpbacked Moon.' *Luna in
triquetro*.

VI\. The Full Moon. *Plenilunium*. Also *Oppositio*, the Moon being now
opposite the Sun; *Luna totilunis, Medius mensis*.

VII\. The Decreasing Moon. *Luna gibba*.

VIII\. The Second Half Moon. *Luna dividua*, etc. *Secunda quadratura*.

TX. The Decreasing Crescent. *Corniculata, falcata, curvata in cornua*.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

X. The Old Moon. *Ultima phasis*.

The epithets *menoeides*, *corniculata*, and the like, apply to any
crescent phase of the moon. During the first half of its course the moon
is *Selênê auxanominê*, *Luna crescens*, the Waxing moon; during the
last half, *Selênê phthinousa, Luna decrescens, senescens*, the Waning
moon. As the Crescent-moon is nearest the Sun, <span
id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155.md) so it is the crescent-moon that is
represented with the young sun in its arms; <span
id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_156.md) and the crescent-moon is also the mother
of the old moon and of the full moon. This is shown in the east window
of Herringfleet Church, Suffolk, <span id="fr_157"></span>[3](#fn_157.md)
where the crescent surrounds the full invisible moon, in the circle of
which is the face of an angel. The Unicorn-goat during the first half of
its career bounds forward from the sun, at which and the earth it looks
back, and hence is regardant; during the second half of its career it
bounds back towards the sun, looking round to the point whence it has
begun to return. <span id="fr_158"></span>[4](#fn_158.md)

The lunar phases received the greatest attention from Babylonian and
Akkadian observers; but we are not yet in a position to formulate
results, as in the case of the Classical languages. Every position and
alteration was more or less portentous, the system of portents being
founded on the triple basis of (1)

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

actual natural incident, (2) anthropomorphic analogy, or (3) synchronous
occurrence. 'The left horn' and 'the right horn' of the moon are both
mentioned, but it is also described as having, like the Unicorn, a
single horn. Thus we read—*Ina ri-ib Karnu* <span
id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_159.md)<span id="img_04000"></span>
![](img/04000.jpg) *la ikh-khi-rav*. 'Owing to rain, *the Horn* was not
visible.' <span id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_160.md) Another passage states,
'Venus is in the ascendant; and (is) on *the Horn of*—' <span
id="fr_161"></span>[3](#fn_161.md) Prof. Sayce supplies 'the Sun.' Rather,
I think, 'the Moon.' Again,—'A dark cloud covered *the Horn*.' <span
id="fr_162"></span>[4](#fn_162.md) Again, 'the moon *in its horn* like the
stars is white.' <span id="fr_163"></span>[5](#fn_163.md) The Crescent-moon
is called *Karunu*, 'Horned.'

<span id="fn_154"></span>[37:1](tu07.htm#fr_154.md) Some tribes consider
this to be the act of the angry Sun, an illustration of the hostility of
Lion and Unicorn.

lviii. 5: 'The Moon the Sun overtook, and with it had lingered. (It is)
horned' (ap. Prof. Sayce in *T.S.B.A.* iii. 212).

<span id="fn_159"></span>[40:1](tu07.htm#fr_159.md) The ideograph shows the
horned cap of the early Babylonians. *Karnu*, Heb. *keren*, which
reappears in the Gk. KRoNos, for KaRNos ('There is no such being as
Κρόνος in Sanskrit.'—professor M. Müller, *Selected Essays*, 1881, vol.
i. 460), Apollôn-Karneios, etc., singularly resembles the Lat. *cornu*,
Eng. *horn*, as the Gk. *keras* does the Heb. *keren*; but Semitic and
Aryan words must not be allied without the most stringent proofs.
