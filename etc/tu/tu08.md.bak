### SECTION VI.

#### HEKATÊ.

WITH the lunar phases is closely connected the mysterious goddess,
Hekatê, 'the-Far-shooting,' whose Aryan name, like the epithets Hekatos,
Hekatebolos, Telephos, Telephassa, etc., describes 'the far-reaching
action of the solar or lunar rays.' <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_164.md) Unmentioned in the Homerik Poems, she
appears before us in the pages of Hesiod <span
id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_165.md) as an august figure, daughter of
Perses <span id="fr_166"></span>[3](#fn_166.md) and Asteria, the
star-lighted splendour of space, honoured above all by Zeus and the
other gods although a Titanic being of a race earlier than the completed
Pantheon of Olympos. Sole-begotten, a survival of the fittest, endowed
with a triple dominion in earth, sea, and heaven, she sits in the seat
of judgment beside kings, crowns whom she will with victory in war and
in the games, grants wealth and honour, is patron of riders and
mariners, and is generally Kourotrophos, 'a Nursing-mother.' This
remarkable personage, whose character seems more complicated than that
of an ordinary Aryan divinity, and who receives the

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

utmost respect from the race of Zeus to which she does not belong,
presents a striking analogy with the august Moon-god of the Euphrates
Valley, sole-begotten 'amongst the stars that have a different birth,'
wise and ancient ruler of the sea, connected with growth, with the
horse, and, as we shall see, with the Unicorn, and in some way or other
of a triple character; Hesiod gives her dominion in earth, sea, and
heaven, whilst others give her sway in heaven, earth, and underworld.
True she has received an Aryan name, and in accordance with the lunar
feelings of the Greeks, is represented as a goddess; but these
circumstances are by no means conclusive on the question of her origin.
I am unable, however, to pursue the enquiry here, suffice it to draw
attention to the parallel. The cult of the goddess appears to have
entered Greece from the direction of Thrakê. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_167.md)

The very important element of triplicity is a remarkable link between
the Euphratean Moon-god, Hekatê <span id="fr_168"></span>[2](#fn_168.md)
and the Unicorn. The Moon-god Sin, as we have seen, <span
id="fr_169"></span>[3](#fn_169.md) is represented by the three tens from
the natural circumstance that his course was completed in

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

about thirty days. This is one aspect of his triplicity, and tends to
bring his trigonic phase into greater prominence; but he was also
regarded by the Babylonians as having a threefold movement, 'one in
longitude, one in latitude, and one in an orbit,' <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md) and here is a second aspect of
triplicity. But ere men calculated the course of the moon, or considered
its real or supposed different movements, they observed the orb itself,
and noticed its three phases or forms—Crescent-moon, Half-moon, and
Full-moon. 'Cum tribus pingebatur, faciebus, inquit Cleomedes, quia
veteres tres in luna figuras observabant, bicornis scilicet lunae,
mediae et plenae.' <span id="fr_171"></span>[2](#fn_171.md) In the
*Argonautika*, <span id="fr_172"></span>[3](#fn_172.md) a poem of late
date, but to which in common with numerous other apocryphal productions
the name of Orpheus <span id="fr_173"></span>[4](#fn_173.md) has been
attached, Hekatê Triformis appears as Horse, Dog, and Snake. Sir G. W.
Cox connects the Horse with the Full-moon, the Snake with the
Waxing-moon, and the Dog with the Waning-moon; but, whilst this
connexion is anything but obvious, another view of these phases will I
think be admitted to be the correct one. And here let me call special
attention to one of the most venerable relics in England, a drawing of a
portion of which forms the Frontispiece of this Monograph, namely, the
ivory horn of Ulf

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

now in the vestry of York Minster. 'An inscription in Latin upon the
horn states that Ulphus, prince of the Western parts of Deira,
originally gave it to the church of St. Peter, together with all his
lands and revenues. Camden, in his Britannia, mentions this horn, and
quotes an ancient authority for an account of the donation of which it
served as a token. The church holds by this horn several estates of
great value, not far eastward from the city of York, and which are still
called Terrae Ulphi.' <span id="fr_174"></span>[1](#fn_174.md) And now upon
this famous Horn we find both Hekatê Triformis and the Unicorn; the
Horned-horse is palpably the Crescent-moon; the Snake or Serpent is the
emblem of the rays of light from the Full-moon, the Gorgô Medousa; <span
id="fr_175"></span>[2](#fn_175.md) and the Dog, whose head and neck only
appear, represents the Half-moon. The Dog may be also connected with the
New or Invisible-moon. Pausanias says that 'the Kolophonians sacrifice a
*black* whelp to Enodios,' <span id="fr_176"></span>[3](#fn_176.md) *i.e.*,
Hekatê, as goddess of cross-roads. The Unicorn of Ulf has the prominent
eye before noticed in unicornic representations, <span
id="fr_177"></span>[4](#fn_177.md) and which refers to the increasing moon
soon to be full. The horn, it will be observed, is fast in the Sacred
Tree, <span id="fr_178"></span>[5](#fn_178.md) and this feature of the myth
I shall have occasion subsequently <span id="fr_179"></span>[6](#fn_179.md)
to notice particularly. Suffice it

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

to remind the reader here that dark groves were sometimes sacred to
Hekatê, as *e.g.*, near Lake Avernus in Lower Italy. <span
id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_180.md) Black female lambs were also offered to
the goddess. <span id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_181.md)

It is evident that this triple-moon-phase, Unicorn-horse, Serpent and
Dog, familiar alike to the artist of the Horn and to the writer of the
*Argonautika* (not to mention others), is of a high antiquity. Hekatê
has a triple power in 'Hesiod,' the Euphratean Moon-god is equally
connected with triplicity; <span id="fr_182"></span>[3](#fn_182.md) but the
chief point in the present investigation is that the Unicorn, whom we
have seen in Babylonian art in the closest connexion with the lunar
power, is shown by this venerable Horn to be beyond all contradiction
the undoubted emblem of the crescent-moon.

Elsewhere I have observed, 'Hellenik divinities whose shapes are
grotesque, monstrous or unhuman, are invariably not indigenous. Apparent
exceptions to this canon, such, for instance, as the Horse-headed
Dêmêtêr of Phigaleia, or the Arkadian Pan, on careful examination, serve
only to confirm it.' <span id="fr_183"></span>[4](#fn_183.md) After
noticing 'the Four-faced Karthaginian Baal,'

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'the solar
Time-king in his four changing seasons,' I remarked;—

'In the Kerameikos, at a place where three ways met, stood a four-headed
Dionysiak statue, the work of the sculptor Telesarchides. It has been
frequently said that Hekatê and Hermes derive their occasional
triplicity, and other unanthropomorphic adjuncts, from presiding over
places where three roads met and the like. But although in later times
these ideas were to some extent connected, and though the statue of a
tri-kephalik or tetra-kephalik divinity might indeed with much propriety
be erected where three or four roads met; yet the previous supposed
character of the personage would occasion the act, the idea of many
heads would not spring from that of cross-roads. That the heads in
origin were quite independent of the roads, is well shown in the
instances before us, in which a *four*-headed god presided where *three*
ways met.' <span id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_184.md) Other epithets of
Hekatê, such as Trioditis, <span id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_185.md)
Triceps, Tergeminus, Trivia, etc., require no further remark; and with
the degradation of the goddess, the process by which she at length
becomes a demon-witch, culminating in the Shaksperian Hekatê, I am not
here concerned, nor in the present investigation can I refer further to
the Moon-dog.

'Alkamenes \[cir. B.C. 420\] first made for the Athenians the statue of
Hekatê with three bodies joined in one' (Paus. II. xxx. 1). There was
also a 'three-handed Hekatê' (Sir G. W. Cox, *M.A.N.* i. 370). The
statue of Alkamenes was not unanthropomorphic, but three female figures
addorsed (vide *G.D.M.* i. 420), like the example given by Montfaucon

also. The Triform Hekatê appears at times on Roman lamps (vide Birch,
