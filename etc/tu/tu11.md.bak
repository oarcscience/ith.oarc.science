### SECTION IX.

#### THE THREE-LEGGED ASS OF THE *BUNDAHIS*.

THE next phase of the Unicorn is, I think, a novel one, and will solve a
previously-felt difficulty. In the Pahlavi <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_255.md) work, the *Bundahish* or
*Bundahis*, <span id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_256.md) is a circumstantial
account of a wonderful animal called 'the Three-legged Ass,' which,
according to M. Darmesteter, <span id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_257.md) is a
personification of cloud, storm, etc.; but whilst this hypothesis can
never be demonstrated, I think on a review of the evidence the contrary
will clearly appear. The writer states;—

'Regarding the three-legged ass they say, that it stands amid the
wide-formed ocean, and its feet are three, eyes six, mouths nine, ears
two and HORN ONE, body white, food spiritual, and it is
righteous.' <span id="fr_258"></span>[4](#fn_258.md)

This puzzle to commentators now at once becomes luminous. The triform,
triquetric Moon stands amid the wide Oversea of heaven, the 'mare magnum
sine fine,' and 'its feet are three.' To what other personage or
phenomenon would this apply? To attempt to explain every detail in the
late and elaborated,

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

and possibly in part purely arbitrary, account would be very unsafe.
Suffice it if the main outline comes out quite clearly. The Ass, a wise
and sagacious animal, especially in Eastern idea, <span
id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_259.md) has six eyes or two for each of the
three phases; the Horse-Serpent-Dog-Moon has six eyes. There is some
doubt about the word translated 'mouths;' it may mean 'testes,' and, if
so, would connect the moon as usual with fertility and increase. The two
ears may be the two ends of the horn, which is that of the lunar
Unicorn. Its body is of course white—Leukotheê. From the archaic time of
the Babylonian Moon-god Sin 'it is righteous,' nay, the leader of
righteousness and of kosmic order; and as a righteous and heavenly being
its food, if it have any, must be 'spiritual.'

The description continues;—

'And two of its six eyes are in the position of eyes,' *i.e.*, in the
full face or Serpent-moon; 'two on the top of the head' on the Dog-moon,
the Half- or New-moon; 'and two in the position of the hump,' *i.e.*, in
the Unicorn-horse, the Crescent or Gibbous-moon. 'With the sharpness of
these six eyes it overcomes and destroys;' <span
id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_260.md) *i.e.*, the dread lunar face and lunar
eye which, as we have seen, drives away evil and scares wicked souls.
The eye is the chief power of the Ass, as it is of the Gorgô. The whole
extraordinary description is, on analysis, most palpably lunar.

'Of the nine mouths three are in the head, three

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

in the hump, and three in the inner part of the flanks.' <span
id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261.md) The mouths are distributed amongst the
phases in the same manner as the eyes. The hump, so far as any actual
animal supplies the imagery, will be that of the Indian ox. The
increased number may express intensity, and the mouths be more or less
Gorgonian.

'The one horn is as it were of gold and hollow. With that horn it will
vanquish and dissipate all the vile corruption due to the efforts of
noxious creatures.' <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_262.md) This is the
pure bright unicorn's horn that drives away darkness and evil, cleanses
streams and pools, and by which 'venym is defended.' <span
id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_263.md)

'When it stales in the ocean all the sea-water will become purified. . .
. If, O three-legged ass! you were not created for the water, all the
water in the sea would have perished.' <span
id="fr_264"></span>[4](#fn_264.md) The sea-and-water-ruling moon.

'Tîstar seizes the water more completely from the ocean with the
assistance of the three-legged ass.' <span
id="fr_265"></span>[5](#fn_265.md) In *Bundahis*, vii. 2, we read;—

'Every single month is the owner of one constellation; the month Tîr is
the fourth month of the year, Cancer <span
id="fr_266"></span>[6](#fn_266.md) the fourth constellation from Aries, so
it is the owner of Cancer, into which Tîstar sprang, and displayed the
characteristics of a producer of

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

rain.' Tîstar, Tistrya or Tishtrya, is Sirius, <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_267.md) who, as the stellar protagonist,
co-operates with the Moon in ruling water and regulating that humidity
which is necessary to vitality.

'Tîstar was converted into three forms, the form of a man and the form
of a horse and the form of a bull; thirty days and nights he was
distinguished in brilliance; and in each form he produced rain ten days
and nights; as the astrologers say that every constellation has three
forms.' <span id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_268.md)

In this very interesting passage we see the Triform Moon reduplicated in
a triform Sirius, himself in his glorious light a second moon. His
special period of brilliance is that of the lunar course, and like the
Moon, he takes the forms of horse and bull. <span
id="fr_269"></span>[3](#fn_269.md)

When we get as late as the formulated systems of 'the astrologers,' each
zodiacal constellation has three forms as divided into three decans, and
it appears that the extra-zodiacal constellations were also regarded in
some way as triform. These are the elaborations of previous simpler
observation, and probably originally based upon, lunar triformity. Thus
Tîstar 'the shining, majestic, the first ten nights unites himself with
a body, with the body of a youth

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

of fifteen years, a shining one, with bright eyes. The second ten
nights, Tîstar unites himself with a body, proceeding along the clear
space, with the body of a bull with golden hoofs. <span
id="fr_270"></span>[1](#fn_270.md) The third ten nights Tîstar unites
himself with a body, with the body of a horse, a shining, beautiful one,
with yellow ears, with a golden housing.' <span
id="fr_271"></span>[2](#fn_271.md) These phases, however, do not really
apply to Sirius but to Lunus, and hence their origin.

The three-legged lunar ass is found on coins and elsewhere under the
familiar form of the Triquetra, <span id="fr_272"></span>[3](#fn_272.md)
the origin of which appears thus;— <span id="fr_273"></span>[4](#fn_273.md)

<span id="img_06600"></span> ![FIG. 1. FIG. 2.](img/06600.jpg.md)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is familiar on
coins of Sicily as the national monetary type, a connexion however which
is probably merely based upon the shape of the island—Trinacria or, as
the Roman poets sometimes actually call it, Triquetra. But in the case
of the Isle of Man no such reason can be admitted as explanatory. <span
id="fr_274"></span>[5](#fn_274.md) Planché remarks;—

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

'The arms of Man are legs, or in less equivocal language, the ancient
kingdom of Man was, and the island itself is still, represented in
heraldry by three legs in armour, conjoined at the thighs. Our example
of this heraldic curiosity <span id="fr_275"></span>[1](#fn_275.md) is
particularly interesting, because the armour in which the legs are
encased is the banded mail of the thirteenth century, and therefore
presents us with the earliest appearance of the armorial coat of that
Island and Sovereignty, after it had ceased to be Norwegian, A.D. 1264.
*The origin of the bearing has yet to be discovered*.' <span
id="fr_276"></span>[2](#fn_276.md) Behold it.

On coins of the ancient Greek city of Metabon (Metapontion-Metapontum)
on the Tarentine Gulf, the three crescent legs appear in a variant phase
thus;—The dots show that the three crescents<span id="img_06700"></span>

|                          |
|--------------------------|
| ![FIG. 3](img/06700.jpg.md) |

are really identical with the central dot or full-moon. A favourite type
on coins of Metabon is the Ear-of-corn which is always, and doubtless
justly, connected with local fertility and the cult of Damater-Ceres;
but at the same time the resemblance between the Ear and the Sacred Tree
of the Euphrates Valley is very striking.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

Another coin of Metabon shows a bull's head, a type which may be
lunar. <span id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_277.md)

A triquetric ornament appears also at Troy and Mykênê. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[2](#fn_278.md)

also the wonderful suitability of nearly all truly archaic names. Far
more probably is Man the Moon Island. The Triquetra seems to make this
view almost an absolute certainty.

of sovereignty' (Sanch. i. 7). Pausanias (VI. xxiv. 5) mentions a statue
of the Moon which had horns on its head, and Taurokerôs is an Orphik
epithet of Selênê. So Porphyry states that the priestesses of Demeter
'called the moon, who presides over generation, a bull,' and adds, 'and
Taurus is the exaltation of the Moon' (*Peri tou en Odysseia tôn Nymphôn
antrou*, viii.). According to Olympiodoros (MS. *Comment*. on the
*Gorgias*), 'the ancient theologists' said that 'the Moon is drawn by
two bulls; by two, on account of her increase and diminution; by bulls,
because as these till the ground \[Not much tillage is done by bulls\],
so the Moon governs all those parts which surround the earth.'
