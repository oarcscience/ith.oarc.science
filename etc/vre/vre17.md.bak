### POSTSCRIPT

In writing my concluding lecture I had to aim so much at simplification
that I fear that my general philosophic position received so scant a
statement as hardly to be intelligible to some of my readers. I
therefore add this epilogue, which must also be so brief as possibly to
remedy but little the defect. In a later work I may be enabled to state
my position more amply and consequently more clearly.

Originality cannot be expected in a field like this, where all the
attitudes and tempers that are possible have been exhibited in
literature long ago, and where any new writer can immediately be classed
under a familiar head. If one should make a division of all thinkers
into naturalists and supernaturalists, I should undoubtedly have to go,
along with most philosophers, into the supernaturalist branch. But there
is a crasser and a more refined supernaturalism, and it is to the
refined division that most philosophers at the present day belong. If
not regular transcendental idealists, they at least obey the Kantian
direction enough to bar out ideal entities from interfering causally in
the course of phenomenal events. Refined supernaturalism is
universalistic supernaturalism; for the "crasser" variety "piecemeal"
supernaturalism would perhaps be the better name. It went with that
older theology which to-day is supposed to reign only among uneducated
people, or to be found among the few belated professors of the dualisms
which Kant is thought to have displaced. It admits miracles and
providential leadings, and finds no intellectual difficulty in mixing
the ideal and the real worlds together by interpolating influences from
the ideal region among the forces that causally determine

<span id="page_511">p. 511</span>

the real world's details. In this the refined supernaturalists think
that it muddles disparate dimensions of existence. For them the world of
the ideal has no efficient causality, and never bursts into the world of
phenomena at particular points. The ideal world, for them, is not a
world of facts, but only of the meaning of facts; it is a point of view
for judging facts. It appertains to a different "-ology," and inhabits a
different dimension of being altogether from that in which existential
propositions obtain. It cannot get down upon the flat level of
experience and interpolate itself piecemeal between distinct portions of
nature, as those who believe, for example, in divine aid coming in
response to prayer, are bound to think it must.

Notwithstanding my own inability to accept either popular Christianity
or scholastic theism, I suppose that my belief that in communion with
the Ideal new force comes into the world, and new departures are made
here below, subjects me to being classed among the supernaturalists of
the piecemeal or crasser type. Universalistic supernaturalism
surrenders, it seems to me, too easily to naturalism. It takes the facts
of physical science at their face-value, and leaves the laws of life
just as naturalism finds them, with no hope of remedy, in case their
fruits are bad.

It confines itself to sentiments about life as a whole, sentiments which
may be admiring and adoring, but which need not be so, as the existence
of systematic pessimism proves. In this universalistic way of taking the
ideal world, the essence of practical religion seems to me to evaporate.
Both instinctively and for logical reasons, I find it hard to believe
that principles can exist which make no difference in facts. <span
id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_358.md) But all facts

<span id="page_512">p. 512</span>

are particular facts, and the whole interest of the question of God's
existence seems to me to lie in the consequences for particulars which
that existence may be expected to entail. That no concrete particular of
experience should alter its complexion in consequence of a God being
there seems to me an incredible proposition, and yet it is the thesis to
which (implicitly at any rate) refined supernaturalism seems to cling.
It is only with experience en bloc, it says, that the Absolute maintains
relations. It condescends to no transactions of detail.

I am ignorant of Buddhism and speak under correction, and merely in
order the better to describe my general point of view; but as I
apprehend the Buddhistic doctrine of Karma, I agree in principle with
that. All supernaturalists admit that facts are under the judgment of
higher law; but for Buddhism as I interpret it, and for religion
generally so far as it remains unweakened by transcendentalistic
metaphysics, the word "judgment" here means no such bare academic
verdict or platonic appreciation as it means in Vedantic or modern
absolutist systems; it carries, on the contrary, *execution* with it, is
*in rebus* as well as *post rem*, and operates "causally" as partial
factor in the total fact. The universe becomes a gnosticism <span
id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_359.md) pure and simple on any other terms. But
this view that judgment and execution

<span id="page_513">p. 513</span>

go together is that of the crasser supernaturalist way of thinking, so
the present volume must on the whole be classed with the other
expressions of that creed.

I state the matter thus bluntly, because the current of thought in
academic circles runs against me, and I feel like a man who must set his
back against an open door quickly if he does not wish to see it closed
and locked. In spite of its being so shocking to the reigning
intellectual tastes, I believe that a candid consideration of piecemeal
supernaturalism and a complete discussion of all its metaphysical
bearings will show it to be the hypothesis by which the largest number
of legitimate requirements are met. That of course would be a program
for other books than this; what I now say sufficiently indicates to the
philosophic reader the place where I belong.

If asked just where the differences in fact which are due to God's
existence come in, I should have to say that in general I have no
hypothesis to offer beyond what the phenomenon of "prayerful communion,"
especially when certain kinds of incursion from the subconscious region
take part in it, immediately suggests. The appearance is that in this
phenomenon something ideal, which in one sense is part of ourselves and
in another sense is not ourselves, actually exerts an influence, raises
our centre of personal energy, and produces regenerative effects
unattainable in other ways. If, then, there be a wider world of being
than that of our every-day consciousness, if in it there be forces whose
effects on us are intermittent, if one facilitating condition of the
effects be the openness of the "subliminal" door, we have the elements
of a theory to which the phenomena of religious life lend plausibility.
I am so impressed by the importance of these phenomena that I adopt the
hypothesis which they so naturally suggest. At these places at least, I
say, it would seem as though transmundane energies, God, if you will,
produced immediate effects within

<span id="page_514">p. 514</span>

the natural world to which the rest of our experience belongs.

The difference in natural "fact" which most of us would assign as the
first difference which the existence of a God ought to make would, I
imagine, be personal immortality. Religion, in fact, for the great
majority of our own race *means* immortality, and nothing else. God is
the producer of immortality; and whoever has doubts of immortality is
written down as an atheist without farther trial. I have said nothing in
my lectures about immortality or the belief therein, for to me it seems
a secondary point. If our ideals are only cared for in "eternity," I do
not see why we might not be willing to resign their care to other hands
than ours. Yet I sympathize with the urgent impulse to be present
ourselves, and in the conflict of impulses, both of them so vague yet
both of them noble, I know not how to decide. It seems to me that it is
eminently a case for facts to testify. Facts, I think, are yet lacking
to prove "spirit-return," though I have the highest respect for the
patient labors of Messrs. Myers, Hodgson, and Hyslop, and am somewhat
impressed by their favorable conclusions. I consequently leave the
matter open, with this brief word to save the reader from a possible
perplexity as to why immortality got no mention in the body of this
book. The ideal power with which we feel ourselves in connection, the
"God" of ordinary men, is, both by ordinary men and by philosophers,
endowed with certain of those metaphysical attributes which in the
lecture on philosophy I treated with such disrespect. He is assumed as a
matter of course to be "one and only" and to be "infinite"; and the
notion of many finite gods is one which hardly any one thinks it worth
while to consider, and still less to uphold. Nevertheless, in the
interests of intellectual clearness, I feel bound to say that religious
experience, as we have studied it, cannot be cited as unequivocally
supporting the infinitist

<span id="page_515">p. 515</span>

belief. The only thing that it unequivocally testifies to is that we can
experience union with *something* larger than ourselves and in that
union find our greatest peace. Philosophy, with its passion for unity,
and mysticism with its monoideistic bent, both "pass to the limit" and
identify the something with a unique God who is the all-inclusive soul
of the world. Popular opinion, respectful to their authority, follows
the example which they set.

Meanwhile the practical needs and experiences of religion seem to me
sufficiently met by the belief that beyond each man and in a fashion
continuous with him there exists a larger power which is friendly to him
and to his ideals. All that the facts require is that the power should
be both other and larger than our conscious selves. Anything larger will
do, if only it be large enough to trust for the next step. It need not
be infinite, it need not be solitary. It might conceivably even be only
a larger and more godlike self, of which the present self would then be
but the mutilated expression, and the universe might conceivably be a
collection of such selves, of different degrees of inclusiveness, with
no absolute unity realized in it at all. <span
id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_360.md) Thus would a sort of polytheism return
upon us—a polytheism which I do not on this occasion defend, for my only
aim at present is to keep the testimony of religious experience clearly
within its proper bounds. \[Compare [p. 130](vre07.htm#page_130.md)
above.\]

Upholders of the monistic view will say to such a polytheism (which, by
the way, has always been the real religion of common people, and is so
still to-day) that unless there be one all-inclusive God, our guarantee
of security is left imperfect. In the Absolute, and in the Absolute
only, *all* is saved. If there be different gods, each caring for his
part, some portion of some of us might not be covered with divine
protection, and our religious consolation would thus

<span id="page_516">p. 516</span>

fail to be complete. It goes back to what was said on pages
[129](vre07.htm#page_129)-[131](vre07.htm#page_131.md), about the
possibility of there being portions of the universe that may
irretrievably be lost. Common sense is less sweeping in its demands than
philosophy or mysticism have been wont to be, and can suffer the notion
of this world being partly saved and partly lost. The ordinary
moralistic state of mind makes the salvation of the world conditional
upon the success with which each unit does its part. Partial and
conditional salvation is in fact a most familiar notion when taken in
the abstract, the only difficulty being to determine the details. Some
men are even disinterested enough to be willing to be in the unsaved
remnant as far as their persons go, if only they can be persuaded that
their cause will prevail—all of us are willing, whenever our
activity-excitement rises sufficiently high. I think, in fact, that a
final philosophy of religion will have to consider the pluralistic
hypothesis more seriously than it has hitherto been willing to consider
it. For practical life at any rate, the *chance* of salvation is enough.
No fact in human nature is more characteristic than its willingness to
live on a chance. The existence of the chance makes the difference, as
Edmund Gurney says, between a life of which the keynote is resignation
and a life of which the keynote is hope. <span
id="fr_361"></span>[365](#fn_361.md) But all these statements are
unsatisfactory from their brevity, and I can only say that I hope to
return to the same questions in another book.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_358"></span>[511:1](vre17.htm#fr_358.md) Transcendental
idealism, of course, insists that its ideal world makes *this*
difference, that facts *exist*. We owe it to the Absolute that we have a
world of fact at all. "A world" of fact!—that exactly is the trouble. An
entire world is the smallest unit with which the Absolute can work,
whereas to our finite minds work for the better ought to be <span
id="page_512">p. 512</span> done within this world, setting in at single
points. Our difficulties and our ideals are all piecemeal affairs, but
the Absolute can do no piecework for us; so that all the interests which
our poor souls compass raise their heads too late. We should have spoken
earlier, prayed for another world absolutely, before this world was
born. It is strange, I have heard a friend say, to see this blind corner
into which Christian thought has worked itself at last, with its God who
can raise no particular weight whatever, who can help us with no private
burden, and who is on the side of our enemies as much as he is on our
own. Odd evolution from the God of David's psalms!
