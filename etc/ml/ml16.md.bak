# CHAPTER XIII

### THE FLORAL LABYRINTH AND THE DWARF-SHRUB MAZE

THE mention of the word "maze" most frequently calls to mind a block of
tall shrubs penetrated by a puzzling branching path, which terminates in
an arbour or goal of some sort. But just as we have seen that the
horticultural maze is far from being the sole form of expression of the
idea, so we must now recognise that even in horticulture the well-known
hedge maze is not the only type of verdant labyrinth.

The dwarf box, although a favourite material for de-limiting flower beds
and edging paths, is merely a sub-ordinate or "accompanying" instrument,
so to speak, in the gardener's orchestra. Yet we do occasionally see it
employed as a soloist, executing its modest little arabesques between
the strepitant choruses of the chromatic parterres on the terrace of
some stately country home. In such cases we see a relic of the "knots"
which formed an important feature in the gardens of our forefathers.

These devices were composed of various herbs or low shrubs and great
ingenuity was displayed in their fashioning, amongst other forms being
several varieties of labyrinths. The praises of the dwarf box in this
connection were sung by John Parkinson, herbalist to Queen Elizabeth and
King James the First. In his "Paradisus" he mentions it thus: ". . .
Boxe, which lastly I chiefly and

above all other herbs commend unto you, and being a small, low, or
dwarfe kind, is called French or Dutch Boxe." This plant, he says,
"serveth very well to set out any knot or border out any beds, for
besides that it is ever greene, it being reasonable thicke set, will
easily be cut and formed into any fashion one will, according to the
nature thereof, which is to grow very slowly, and will not in a long
time rise to be of any height, but shooting forth many small branches
from the roote, will grow very thicke and yet not require so great
tending, nor so much perish as any of the former . . .," and so on, in
typical labyrinthine prose. The use of dwarf box in this way was not, of
course, a novelty in Parkinson's time. In fact it was used by the Romans
to border their paths and the flower-beds of that little garden in front
of the porticoes which went by the name of the *xystus*.

In the sixteenth century, however, the planting of dwarf shrubs and
herbs in long narrow beds twisted into various complicated figures seems
to have become very fashionable.

Where maze patterns were introduced, a simple, unicursal form was
sometimes followed, but in many instances very elaborate mazes were
executed.

In a few of our libraries are to be found copies of a curious book of
garden designs by Jan Vredeman De Vries, entitled "Hortorum
Viridariorumque Formae," published at Antwerp in 1583. In it are
represented many extraordinary and even fantastic plans for the lay-out
of gardens, including no less than nine in the form of labyrinths. Some
of the latter are designated by titles of a descriptive or of a
quasi-classic character, "La Roue," "Ionica," "Corinthia," and so forth.
We reproduce a few of these designs in Figs. [72](#img_fig072.md),
[73](#img_fig073) and [74](#img_fig074.md). Several other horticultural or
architectural books of about the same period also mention labyrinths or
figure them in their illustrations, but it is not clear, in many cases,
whether these are intended to represent garden mazes or the

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

flower-bed labyrinths that we have just mentioned. In some instances,
where the beds were occupied by shrubs, we have a sort of link between
the garden labyrinth and the hedge maze proper. An illustration in a
book of 1573 on the gardens of the Villa d’Este at Tivoli, dedicated to
Catherine de Medici by the author, Stefano Duperac, shows four
rectangular labyrinths, all of the same pattern. It is unlikely that in
such circumstances they would all have been formed of tall hedges, and
we may therefore judge them to have been of the flower-bed type or
perhaps of dwarf box.

We find a reference to the herbal labyrinth in "La Maison Rustique," by
Charles Estienne (Paris, 1573), under the heading of "Kitchen Garden
Planning":

"Et sera bon dresser a ceste fin une planche de sauge . . . encore une
de sariette, & hyssope, de cost, de basilic, aspic, baume, pouliot & une
de camomille pour faire les siéges & labyrinthes, que l’on nomme
Daedalus."

One of the best-known and most often quoted of the Tudor gardening books
is that of Thomas Hyll, or Hill, whose work "A moste Briefe and
Pleasaunt Treatyse Teachynge How to Dress, Sowe and Set a Garden" was
published in 1563. It has a captivating charm, especially in the
earlier, black-letter editions. In later editions the name of the author
appears as "Didymus Mountaine" (Didymus = Thomas, Mountaine = Hill), and
the book becomes "The Gardener's Labyrinth."

He published two figures of mazes, which we reproduce as Figs.
[75](#img_fig075) and [76](#img_fig076.md). In the 1579 edition—"The
Profitable Art of Gardening"—they are respectively placed at the heads
of different chapters, the openings of which are worth quoting:

"Here by the way (Gentle Reader) I do place two proper Mazes, the one
before this Chapter, and the other after, as proper adornments upon
pleasure to a Garden, that who so listeth, having such roomth in their
Garden, may place the one of them, which liketh them best, in

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

that voide place of the Garden that maye beste be spared for the onelye
purpose, to sporte in them at times, which

mazes being workmanly handled by the Gardner shal much beautifie them in
devising four sundry fruits to be

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

placed in each of the corners of the Maze and in the middle of it a
proper Herber decked with Roses, or else some faire tree of Rosemary, or
other fruits, at the discretion of the Gardener."

"And here, I also place the other Maze, which may be lyke ordered and
used, as I spake before, and it may eyther be set with Isope and Time,
or with winter Savery and Tyme; for these do wel endure all ye winter
through greene. And there be some which set their mazes with Lavender,
Cotton Spike, Majerome and such like. But let them be ordered in this
point, as liketh best the Gardener, and so an end. For I doe not here
set forth this, or the other Maze afore expressed, for any necessarie
commoditie in a Garden, but rather appoint eyther of them (which liketh
you best) as a beautifying unto your Garden: for that Mazes and Knots
aptly made do much set forth a garden which neverthelesse I referre to
your discretion for that not all persons be of like abilitie."

One would have expected to find some word concerning mazes in Lord
Bacon's Essay on Gardening, but, strange to say, he makes no reference
whatever to mazes or labyrinths. He abhorred topiary work. "I, for my
part," he says, "do not like images cut out in juniper or other garden
stuff—they be for children." Mazes he apparently considered unworthy
even of mention.

Hill's square maze reappears, but with a tree at the centre, in another
gardening book which achieved much popularity in the seventeenth
century, namely, "A New Orchard and Garden," by William Lawson (i 623),
afterwards published (1638, 1648, etc.), bound up with "A Way to get
Wealth," by Gervase Markham. This is a quaint little publication which
embodies amongst other things a "Table of Hard Words." "Mazes well
framed a man's height," says Lawson (ch. xvii.), may perhaps make your
friend wander in gathering of berries, till he cannot recover himself
without your help." In the division entitled "The Country Hous-Wife's
Garden" we

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

are told that "The number of Formes, Mazes and Knots is so great, and
Men are so diversly delighted that I leave every House-wife to her
selfe, expecially seeing to set downe many, had been but to fill much
Paper; yet lest I deprive her of all delight and direction, let her view
these few, choice, new Forms, and note these generally, that all Plots
are square, and all are bordered about with Privit, Rasins, Fea-berries,
Roses, Thorne, Rosemary, Bee-flowers, Isop, Sage or such like."

Let us hope that the Hous-Wife whose duty was to

<span id="img_fig077-8"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIGS. 77,

</span>

prepare and keep in order these "Choice new Forms" had plenty of time on
her hands.

The two mazes included in a tiny book amongst the Harley Manuscripts
([Figs. 77 and 78](#img_fig077-8).md) were probably intended for flower-bed
mazes. The book consists of a collection of 166 sketches of flower-beds,
"knots," etc., and probably belonged to some seventeenth-century
gardener.

These mazes, like most of the early forms, are of the "unicursal" type;
that is, they have only one path, without loops or branches. It seems
most likely that such mazes would be constructed either of flower-beds
or of some low-growing shrubs, such as box. If constructed of high
hedges the pattern would be invisible, except from

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

a superior eminence, and they would afford but a poor sort of
entertainment to the visitor, who would have nothing to do but to follow
the path until he came to a full stop, and then retrace his steps.
Nevertheless there is no doubt that some of them were made in this way.
On the other hand the flower-bed labyrinth was not necessarily
unicursal, as we may see from the plans of De Vries.

The actual form of the unicursal type of labyrinth was,

<span id="img_fig079"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG. 79.—Maze

</span>

in all the earlier designs, whether circular or square, in very close
agreement with the classic model, but in later designs monotony was
avoided by means of some ingenious modifications. One of the earliest of
these is shown in [Fig. 79](#img_fig079.md), which is copied from a very
rare book called "The Orchard and The Garden," gathered from French and
Dutch sources and published by Adam Islip in 1602. Fig. 80 shows one of
several specimens which are given in a Dutch book of about half a
century later, "Nederlantze Hesperides," by J. Commelyn (1676). It is

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

perhaps as likely, however, that these were intended as designs for a
hedge maze, or "Doolhof," as the Dutch call it.

The box-edged paths of "Queen Mary's Bower" on the island of Inchmahome,
by the Lake of Menteith, Stirlingshire, may mark the site of a former
dwarf-box labyrinth. Tradition maintains that the maze was made for Mary
Queen of Scots when she was staying there as

a child. The original maze-pattern, if such existed, is lost by reason
of the depredations of relic hunters, who for many years laid the bower
under contribution and so denuded it that it had to be entirely
replanted some fifty or sixty years ago. The box shrubs with which it
was repaired, however, are said to have been taken from the gardens of
Cardross, where they had been reared from cuttings derived from the
original bower. They have now grown to a height of several feet, and the
bower no doubt presents a very different appearance from that which it
had in the days of the ill-starred Mary.

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

It consists of a winding box-bordered walk leading to a central
thorn-bush, the whole affair being oval in out-line, about thirty yards
in circumference and surrounded by a paling. Close at hand, and enclosed
within a square stone wall, is Queen Mary's garden, containing at the
centre an old box tree which is affirmed to have been planted by the
little princess herself.

Another Scottish relic which is said to mark the site of an old terrace
maze is that near Stirling Castle, known since the fourteenth century as
the "Round Tabill" or the "King's Knot."

There is a "Queen Mary's Bower," by the way, in the gardens at Hampton
Court, but this is only a straight walk shaded by an avenue of pollarded
elms, which forms a sort of verdant tunnel. It is situated at the summit
of a bank rising above one side of the King's Privy Garden. An old tower
planted with shrubs at Chatsworth bears the same name.

We shall have occasion to refer to "bowers" again later on, in another
connection. The present mention of them forms a convenient transition
from the subject of garden labyrinths to that of *hedge mazes*.
