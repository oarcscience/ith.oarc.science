# CHAPTER VII

### THE ETRUSCAN OR ITALIAN LABYRINTH

IN addition to the Egyptian and Cretan labyrinths, a few other
structures are referred to as being in the same category, but not until
a fairly late period.

Pliny (died A.D. 79) mentions one built by Smilis of Aegina, after the
Egyptian model, on the island of Lemnos, and says that it was renowned
for the beauty of its 150 columns and that remains of it existed in his
time. He also mentions one at Samos, said to have been built by
Theodorus, and says that "all of these buildings are covered with arched
roofs of polished stone." No other details concerning these edifices
have come down to us, but Pliny quotes from Varro (116-27 B.C.) a
detailed description of a very extraordinary tomb at Clusium (the modern
Chiusi), said to be that of the great Etruscan general Lars Porsena.
This is the only Etruscan tomb described by the ancient writers, and is
mentioned by Pliny solely because it was alleged to contain a
subterranean labyrinth. It must have been a most elaborate, not to say
extravagant, monument. Even Pliny feels some qualms about accepting
responsibility for the description, and therefore makes it clear that he
is simply quoting from information received.

"It is but right that I should mention it," he says, "in order to show
that the vanity displayed by foreign princes, great though it is, has
been surpassed. But in

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

view of the exceedingly fabulous nature of the story I shall use the
words given by M. Varro himself in his account of it: 'Porsena was
buried below the city of Clusium in the place where he had built a
square monument of dressed stones. Each side was three hundred feet in
length and fifty in height, and beneath the base there was an
inextricable labyrinth, into which, if any-body entered without a clue
of thread, he could never discover his way out. Above this square
building there stand five pyramids, one at each corner and one in the
centre, seventy-five feet broad at the base and one hundred and fifty
feet high. These pyramids so taper in shape that upon the top of all of
them together there is supported a brazen globe, and upon that again a
*petasus* <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) from which bells are
suspended by chains. These make a tinkling sound when blown about by the
wind, as was done in bygone times at Dodona. Upon this globe there are
four more pyramids, each a hundred feet in height, and above them is a
platform on which are five more pyramids.' The height of the latter,
Varro is ashamed to add, but, according to the Etruscan stories, it was
equal to that of the rest of the building. What utter madness is this,
to attempt to seek glory at a great cost which can never be of use to
anyone; not to mention the drain upon the resources of the country. And
all to the end that the artist may receive the greater share of the
praise!"

There have been many discussions as to the possibility of a monument of
this nature having existed, and various reconstructions have been
attempted, notably one ([Fig. 13](#img_fig013).md), based on Varro's
account, by a celebrated French scholar of a century ago, M. Quatremère
de Quincy.

One enthusiast, a certain Father Angelo Cortenovis, even wrote a
treatise to prove that the whole contrivance was nothing more nor less
than a huge electrical machine!

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

Most writers on the subject have been inclined to look upon Varro's
description as at best a gross exaggeration, but Professor Müller gave
it as his opinion that the labyrinth described did actually exist, and
that the upper part, though no doubt highly embellished in the
description, was not the mere offspring of fancy. He thought it quite
probable that there was a square basement of regular masonry supporting
five pyramids as recounted by Varro, but that the latter described the
upper part from hearsay. He drew attention to the fact that a tomb
somewhat of this nature is still in existence on the Appian Way at
Albano, the pyramids being represented in this case by cones. It is
commonly called the Tomb of the Horatii and Curiatii.

In the early part of last century a British traveller, G. Dennis, made a
study of the antiquities of Etruria and gave particular attention to the
remarkable rock-cut labyrinths of which that province furnishes several
examples.

He pointed out that the possession of a labyrinth was the distinguishing
feature of Porsena's tomb which alone caused Pliny to mention it. The
expression "Sub Clusio" used by Pliny, he says, led subsequent writers
to infer that the subterranean passages beneath Chiusi were intended,
but such an arrangement would be at variance with the general sepulchral
practice of the Etruscans, and the tomb of Porsena must be looked for
outside the city walls. Dennis then goes on to describe the great
cemetery that had recently been discovered in the hill called Poggio
Gajella, about three miles to the north-east of Chiusi. His sketch of
the principal "storey" of this labyrinthine excavation is shown in [Fig.
14](#img_fig014.md).

Here again we may note that the design of the passages, although perhaps
puzzling to a stranger, especially with imperfect illumination, in no
respect approaches the traditional "labyrinth" pattern. That the
conventional form was not unknown to the Etruscans, however,

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

is shown by the occurrence of a design of this type on a vase found at
Tragliatella which we shall mention later.

It is, of course, possible that the tomb of Porsena was erected on the
hill above this labyrinth, but we have not much evidence on the point.
If the tomb possessed a labyrinth, no doubt the latter would have been
something of this type. Dennis also mentions various other labyrinths of
this nature in Etruria—for example, one near Volterra, "a long passage
cut in the rock, six feet wide but only three high, so that you must
travel on all-fours. From time to time the passage widens into chambers,
yet not high enough to permit you to stand upright, or it meets the
passages of similar character opening in various directions and
extending into the heart of the hill, how far no one can say. In short,
this is a perfect labyrinth in which, without a clue, one might very
soon be lost."

He also mentions one at San Pietro, Toscanella, "in the cliffs below the
Madonna dell’ Olivo, about half a mile from the town. Here a long,
sewer-like passage leads into a spacious chamber of irregular form, with
two massive columns supporting its ceiling and a rude pilaster on the
wall behind. But the peculiarity of the tomb lies in a *cuniculus* or
passage cut in the rock, just large enough for a man to creep through on
all-fours, which, entering the wall on one side after a long gyration
and sundry branchings, now blocked with earth, opens in the opposite
wall of the tomb."

These Etruscan labyrinths were all of a sepulchral character, and one is
naturally reminded of the catacombs of Rome, Paris, and Naples, to
which, however, the term "labyrinth" is not customarily applied. Strabo
uses the word in reference to a catacomb near Nauplia, which he calls
the Labyrinth of the Cyclops. In Pliny's time the word would appear to
have been used to denote a winding path following a more or less formal
design of intricate

pattern, but not necessarily connected with sepulchral purposes.

When speaking of the Labyrinth of Crete he says, "We must not compare
this to what we see traced upon our *mosaic pavements* or to the *mazes
formed in the fields* for the entertainment of children, and thus
suppose it to be a narrow path along which we may walk for many miles
together, but we must picture to ourselves an edifice with many doors
and galleries which mislead the visitor. . . ." This passage shows that
the term "labyrinth" had come to have a fairly broad significance. It
had long been used in a metaphorical sense, even as we find Plato, over
four centuries earlier, employing it to describe an elaborate argument.
We also find it applied by extension to other objects, such as traps for
fish, to judge by a certain passage in the works of Theocritus.

The only buildings to which the ancient writers applied the term,
however, were those to which we have already referred.

Of the two phrases which we have italicised in the above quotation from
Pliny, the second is of interest in connection with a matter we shall
deal with later on, whilst the former brings us to the subject of our
next chapter.
