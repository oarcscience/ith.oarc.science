# CHAPTER XVII

### STONE LABYRINTHS AND ROCK ENGRAVINGS

IN Chapter XII we noticed some of the principal suggestions which had
been made up to a few years ago as to the origin of our turf mazes, and
saw that the question was one which could not be settled by the study of
remains found in this country alone. Several interesting fans have been
brought to light in other lands since Dr. Trollope wrote the memoir
which has for so many years been accepted as the standard authority on
the subject, and we shall find that a little consideration of them will
enable us to view the question in a new light.

As long ago as 1838, Dr. E. von Baer, whilst held up by bad weather on
the uninhabited island of Wier, south of Hochland in the Gulf of
Finland, observed a curious pattern ([Fig. 124](#img_fig124).md) formed in
the ground by means of large pebbles. He also noticed several very
similar arrangements on the southern coast of the peninsula of Lappland
and presented a paper on the subject to the Academy of St. Petersburg.

In some of these figures the stones employed were small pebbles, in
other instances they were as large as a child's head, and in one case
they were so large that they required several strong men to lift them.
Some of the figures had nearly disappeared through the action of moss,
earthworms, etc.

In 1877, Dr. J. R. Aspelin, of Helsingfors, drew attention to the
existence of similar figures in Finland

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

and on the east coast of Sweden. [Fig. 125](#img_fig125.md) shows a form
found by him on an island not far from Borgo, Finland.

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He describes some
of the figures as having one "centre," others two, and others again none
at all. They are usually from ten to fifteen yards in diameter. One
large specimen, nearly twenty yards across ([Fig. 126](#img_fig126).md), at
Wisby, on

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

the Island of Gothland, is of a design very similar to the circular
labyrinth which appears on certain coins of Knossos. They were generally
found on islands or close to the sea-coast, and were known by various
names in different localities (see [p. 150](#page_150).md).

The fishermen and peasants said that they were used for children's
games, a girl standing at the centre whilst the boys raced for her along
the winding paths; but

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dr. Aspelin
pointed out that they were in any case ancient remains, and thought that
the idea might have originated in the Bronze Age.

Corresponding figures have been found in Iceland, and a somewhat similar
arrangement, consisting of concentric circles of pebbles, with sometimes
a cross at the centre, has long been known in the province of
Brandenburg, Germany.

It seems to have escaped the notice of most writers on the subject that
long before the nineteenth century these objects were described by the
Swedish antiquarian

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rudbeck, from
whose "Atlantica" (1695) we reproduce the sketch shown in [Fig.
127](#img_fig127.md).

The names given to these devices in the various localities in which they
occur are of some interest. Around the Finnish coasts the names
*Jatulintarha* (Giant's Fence) and *Pietarinleikki* (St. Peter's Game)
predominate. Around Helsingfors the figures are more frequently spoken
of as "Ruins of Jerusalem," "City of Nineveh," or "Walls of

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jericho." In the
neighbourhood of Viborg they are known as *Jätinkatu* (Giant's Street),
*Kivitarha* (Stone-fence), or *Lissabon*.

In Lappland a common term is *Babylon*; in Iceland, where the mazes are
sometimes formed of earth, the name applied is *Völundarhus* (Wieland's,
or Weyland's, House).

In Norway and Sweden they are sometimes called *Nunnentarha* (Nun's
Fence), *Jungfrudans* (Maiden's Dance), or *Rundborg* (Round Castle),
and on an island in the Kattegat the name *Trelleborg* (The Troll's, or
Giant's, Castle) is found; but more frequently they are known by

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

some name akin to our "Troy-town," such as *Trojin*, *Trojeburg*,
*Trojenborg*, or *Tröborg*. Another name sometimes associated with them
was *Steintanz* (Stone Dance). The Wisby labyrinth is named *Tröjeborg*.

<span id="img_fig128"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG. 128.—Danish

FIG. 128.—Danish Runic Stone Cross, with Labyrinth Figure.

</span>

That labyrinths of some kind were also known in olden Denmark appears
from the works of the seventeenth-century Danish antiquary Olaf Worm,
one of whose woodcuts ([Fig. 128](#img_fig128).md) shows the symbol
engraved on an ancient cross.

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

We see then that John Aubrey (see [p. 136](ml18.htm#page_136).md) was not
altogether speaking at random when he stated his belief that "we
received these Mazes from our Danish ancestors." In fact, he based his
observations on the works of the Danish and Swedish writers just
referred to.

If, as the above considerations lead us to guess, the use of
labyrinthine figures was a common feature of the northern peoples before
the Norse invasion of Britain, we may wonder whether there is any
evidence of the use of the symbol by earlier inhabitants of the same
parts; are there any indications of this nature to be found among the
relics of prehistoric man in the northern countries?

Well, there are certain remains which have been held to afford an
affirmative reply to this question. The remarkable prehistoric rock
engravings in Northumberland and the Borders, first noticed about a
hundred years ago and described in detail by Mr. G. Tate in 1864, are
very suggestive in this connection. They include many figures of a
character closely approaching that of a circular labyrinth, but no
actual design of the conventional Cretan type has been discovered. In
Figs. [129](#img_fig129) and [130](#img_fig130.md) are seen examples found
on rocks at Routing Linn and Old Bewick respectively. The engravings are
as much as three or four feet in diameter, and in many cases are
interconnected by grooves which terminate at their cup-like centres.
They often coalesce and interconnect to form mazy patterns of great
complexity. The greater number consist merely of a series of concentric
circles around a central cup, the circles in some cases being
interrupted along a radial line which is generally occupied by a
straight groove. Their origin and purpose are very obscure.

Very similar rock engravings have been found, though not in such
profusion, in other parts of Great Britain, as far north as the Orkneys,
and as far south as Devonshire, and also in the south of Ireland. In
other parts of Ireland the engravings have chiefly the shape of a simple
spiral.

There is strong suggestion of the labyrinth idea in the

elaborate series of engravings which adorn the stones of a cromlech on
the island of Gav’r Innis, off the coast of Brittany. Here the surface
of the stones is entirely covered with engraved concentric grooves,
which never cross one another, but form systems of whorls very much like
those on the skin of human finger-tips. There is, however, nothing that
can be fairly compared with the designs of the turf mazes, the stone
labyrinths or the coins of Knossos.

Amongst the remarkable assemblage of prehistoric engravings on the rocky
surfaces of the Italian Maritime Alps is one which exhibits a spiral of
five turns, with interruptions and blind branches, but the resemblance
between this isolated figure and the conventional labyrinth form is
rather too slender to support any useful deduction as to the ancestry of
the latter.

The reader may perhaps wonder whether any traces of the labyrinths have
been found in other continents, and, if so, whether any connection can
be established between them and the labyrinth cult in Europe. An
interesting discovery in this reference was made some years ago in the
shape of a figure of the Cretan Labyrinth, of circular type, roughly
engraved amid other pictographs on the wall of the ruined *Casa Grande*,
an old Indian erection in Pinal County, Arizona, U.S.A.

An exactly similar figure, with the addition of some unknown symbol
opposite its "entrance" ([Fig. 131](#img_fig131).md), was also found in a
manuscript entitled "Rudo Ensayo" (Rough Essay), written by a Spaniard
who visited the country—the home of the Pima Indians—in 1761 or 1762.
According to this manuscript the diagram was scratched in the sand by an
Indian and represented the plan of a building.

Dr. J. W. Fewkes, the Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, who
investigated the matter about fifteen years ago, states that an old
Indian living in the neighbourhood was asked whether he knew of any

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

building, or remains of one, built on such a plan. He replied in the
negative, but said the figure was commonly employed in a children's game
called *Tcuhiki*, *i.e.* the House of Tcuhu. (Tcuhu is a mythical hero,
probably identical with Gopher, who is supposed to have made the spiral
hole through which the Pima Indians came up from the underworld.) A
writer on this tribe of Indians has described another game played by
them which seems to have much in common with that mentioned above. It

is called *Tculikwikut*, and is played with rings and darts, count being
kept by means of little stones which are moved along a series of small
holes arranged in the sand in the form of a whorl, starting from a
centre called *Tcunni Ki*, "the Council House."

If it could be shown that these games were associated with the labyrinth
figure in those regions before the date of the Spanish invasion of
Mexico we should be forced to conclude either that, by an extraordinary
coincidence, the figure became evolved independently in the Old World
and the New, or that in both it had a common origin of astounding
antiquity. However, there is a probability that it was introduced to the
Indians by the early Spaniards, with whom it would have been a familiar
symbol. The only other ancient Indian pictograph of labyrinthine type so
far discovered appears to be that on a pebble found by Dr. Fewkes in
1919 in a ruin known as "Square Tower House," in Mesa Verde National

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Park. This, it
will be seen ([Fig. 132](#img_fig132).md), bears no likeness to the
conventional design, but is merely an asymmetrical meandering groove
somewhat similar in appearance to the braided designs often seen on
modish feminine apparel at the present day. Its significance is unknown.

According to a short review in *Folk Lore* in 1913, a book entitled
"Some Zulu Customs and Folk Lore," by L. H. Samuelson ("Nomleti"), 1912,
contained a description of mazes made on the ground by Zulus.
Unfortunately this book is out of print, and no copy,

</span>

strange to say, is to be found in the library of either the British
Museum or the Folk Lore Society. It would be extremely interesting to
know whether the mazes in question bear any similarity to the
traditional Cretan figure.

So far, then, evidence of a definite labyrinth cult is confined to
certain parts of Europe and the Mediterranean borders. It has, in fact,
been shown that it corresponds roughly with the areas formerly occupied
by the people that built the cromlechs. With regard to its origin and
significance, many interesting speculations have been made, some of
which we will now briefly review.
