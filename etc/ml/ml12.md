# CHAPTER IX

### CHURCH LABYRINTHS

THE consideration of labyrinths worked in Roman mosaic pavements leads
us on to a very interesting development of the subject which deserves a
chapter to itself, namely, the Labyrinth in the Church.

Probably the oldest known example of this nature is that in the ancient
basilica of *Reparatus* at Orléansville (Algeria), an edifice which is
believed to date from the fourth century A.D. In the pavement near the
north-west entrance of the church is the design shown in outline in
[Fig. 42](#img_fig042.md). It measures about 8 ft. in diameter and shows
great resemblance to the Roman pavement found at Harpham and the
tomb-mosaic at Susa. At the centre is a *jeu-de-lettres* on the words
SANCTA ECLESIA, which may be read in any direction, except diagonally,
commencing at the centre. But for the employment of these words the
labyrinth in question might well have been conceived to be a Roman relic
utilised by the builders of the church to ornament their pavement. Such
pavement-labyrinths, however, with or without central figures or other
embellishments, and of various dimensions and composition, are found in
many of the old churches of France and Italy.

They seem to have been constructed chiefly during the twelfth century,
and although several of them have been destroyed many fine examples
still remain. Some

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

are formed on the walls instead of the pavements, and in such cases are
of smaller dimensions.

On the whole, too, those in the Italian churches are much smaller than
the French specimens. On the wall of Lucca Cathedral (Fig. 43) is one of
a diameter of only 1 ft. 7½ in. It formerly enclosed at the centre a
representation of Theseus and the Minotaur, but owing to the friction of
many generations of tracing fingers this has

become effaced. Opposite the "entrance" is the inscription:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

</div>

A similar small labyrinth, with a central Theseus-Minotaur design, is to
be found on the wall of the church of San Michele Maggiore at Pavia
([Fig. 44](#img_fig044).md). It is thought to be of tenth-century
construction. This is one of the few cases where the Minotaur is
represented with a human head and a beast's body—as a sort of Centaur,
in fact. It is accompanied by the words "TESEUS INTRAVIT MONSTRUMQUE
BIFORME NECAVIT."

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

Of about the same period was the example in the church of San Savino at
Piacenza. It is described by P. M. Campi in his "Ecclesiastical History
of Piacenza" (1651), under the year A.D. 903. The signs of the Zodiac
were placed in juxtaposition to it. The accompanying legend in this case
consisted of four hexameters, to the effect that the labyrinth
represented the world we live in, broad at the entrance, but narrow at
the exit, so that he who is ensnared by the joys of this world, and
weighed down by his vices, can regain the doctrine of life only with
difficulty.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

</div>

In the Cathedral of Cremona, which, like Pavia and Piacenza, is on the
banks of the River Po, is a mutilated mosaic of early date—possibly
eighth or ninth century—showing part of an interlaced pattern which was
evidently intended to refer to the Cretan Labyrinth, as it was placed
close to two figures in fighting attitudes and armed with swords and
shields, the right-hand figure having the head of a beast and the label
"CENTAVRVS." (There was apparently little distinction between a Minotaur
and a Centaur in the minds of some mediaeval artists.)

A rather larger specimen, 5 ft. in diameter, may be seen in the church
of Sta. Maria-in-Aquiro, Rome. It is composed of bands of porphyry and
yellow and green marble, surrounding a central plate of porphyry, and is
similar in design to that at Lucca. Another church in the same city,
Sta. Maria-di-Trastavera, has a labyrinth composed of variously coloured
marbles worked in the floor.

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is 11 ft.
across and was probably constructed about 1190 A.D. (Fig. 45). It is now
somewhat mutilated, but was originally a most beautiful example. The
fact that the inner paths consist of a series of concentric rings rather
suggests that it has at some time been repaired without regard to the
original design; unless we accept the hypothesis of M. Durand that they
bore a symbolic

reference to the various degrees of beatitude by which the soul
approaches heaven, as figured by Dante. [Fig. 46](#img_fig046.md) shows
another old Italian specimen. It is nearly 11½ ft. in diameter and is to
be found in the church of San Vitale, Ravenna.

Designs of this nature were widely employed by the mediaeval church
builders in France, and, although many of them were destroyed at the
Revolution and at other times, several fine examples still exist. They
seem to have

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

been mostly built at a rather later date than those already described.
The largest now remaining is that in Chartres Cathedral ([Fig.
47](#img_fig047).md). It is formed of blue and white stones and is about 40
ft. in diameter. The French poet Bouthrays, in his "Histoire de
Chartres" (1624), describes it in a set of Latin verses. A fine sketch
of it appears in the "Album" of the thirteenth-century architect,
Villard de

<span id="img_fig048"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG.

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Honnecourt. In a
ninth-century French manuscript, formerly belonging to the Abbey of
St.-Germain-des-Prés, there is a sort of frontispiece consisting of a
labyrinth of similar type, with a funny little horned Minotaur at the
centre, seated, hands on knees, on a kind of throne.

The Chartres labyrinth formerly went by the name of "La Lieue," an
expression which would ordinarily be rendered as "the league." The
French league, however, was about 2282 yards, a much greater length than
the

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

total extent of the path in any of the existing pavement-labyrinths,
that at Chartres, for example, having a length of only about 150 yards.
Possibly the term had some etymological connection with the old Gaulish
measure *leuca*, *leuga* or *leuva*, which was 1500 paces.

In other cases the labyrinth was known as a "*Chemin de Jérusalem*"
"*daedale*," or "*meandre*," terms which need

no explanation. The centre was called "*ciel*" or "*Jérusalem*." The
labyrinth formerly in the nave of Amiens Cathedral was larger than that
at Chartres, being 42 ft. in diameter ([Fig. 48](#img_fig048).md). It was
constructed in 1288 and was destroyed in 1825. In plan it was similar to
that at the entrance to the parish church of St. Quentin ([Fig.
49](#img_fig049).md). The latter, however, is only 34½ ft. in diameter.

Rheims Cathedral formerly possessed a fine design of this class ([Fig.
50](#img_fig050).md). It was laid down in 1240 and was

composed of blue stones or marbles. It was destroyed in 1779 by order of
a certain Canon Jacquemart, who objected to the noise made by children
and others in tracing its course during the progress of divine service.

The labyrinths of Rheims, Chartres, and Amiens possessed in common a
feature which has given rise to much discussion, namely, a figure or
figures at the centre representing, it is believed, the architects of
the edifices.

That of Amiens is preserved in Amiens Museum and consists of an
octagonal grey marble slab ([Fig. 51](#img_fig051).md) with a central
cross, between the limbs of which are arranged figures representing
Bishop Evrard and the three architects, Robert de Luzarches, Thomas de
Cormont and his son Regnault, together with four angels. A long
inscription accompanied it, relating to the foundation of the Cathedral.

There is a very fine labyrinth in the chapter-house of Bayeux Cathedral
([Fig. 52](#img_fig052).md). It measures 12 ft. across and is composed of
circles of tiles ornamented with shields, griffins and fleur-de-lis,
separated by bands of small, plain, black tiles.

Sens Cathedral formerly possessed a circular labyrinth ([Fig.
53](#img_fig053).md), 30 ft. in diameter and formed of incised lines filled
in with lead, but it was destroyed in 1769. A similar specimen in
Auxerre Cathedral was demolished about 1690.

In *The Builder* for May 12, 1916, appeared a diagram accompanied by a
note from a firm of publishers who stated that they had received the
sketch from one of their travellers who was then serving on the Arras
front. "He informs us," they state, "that it is not a puzzle, but a plan
of the labyrinth under the cathedral. He found the prints in a ruin in
the vicinity, a house which appears to have been occupied by a librarian
from what he saw among the debris." The sketch in question is of an
octagonal pattern resembling that of the St. Quentin

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

labyrinth, and represents the pavement-labyrinth that formerly existed
in the now ruined cathedral, not, of course, a system of subterranean
passages, as the correspondent evidently inferred. It was about 34½ ft.
in diameter and was composed of small blue and yellow squares. The
destruction of this labyrinth cannot be debited to the account of the
aggressors in the Great War, as it was carried out during the French
Revolution.

FIG. 53.—Labyrinth in Sens Cathedral. (Gailhabaud.)  
</span>

A labyrinth of rather striking design ([Fig. 54](#img_fig054).md) was
formerly in the pavement of the old Abbey of St. Bertin, an edifice
which has long been a picturesque ruin, in the lower part of the town of
St. Omer. A description of it was first published nearly a century ago
by Emmanuel Wallet (or Vallet). Our figure, which accords with his
notes, differs slightly from that which has usually accompanied the
references of subsequent writers—many of whom, by the way, erroneously
speak of it as being in the cathedral, which is in the upper part of the
town, and at some distance from St. Bertin. Most illustrations of

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

the labyrinth in question show the path as crossing itself at one point,
an arrangement which is most unlikely to have been adopted. Wallet based
his description on a manuscript which, judging by the watermark in the
paper, he attributed to a former English student at the college in the
vicinity.

</span>

This labyrinth was apparently destroyed at about the same time as that
at Rheims, and for a similar reason.

In the cathedral there is no pavement-labyrinth, although it may
possibly have possessed one in former times, but beneath the organ, at
the west end of the nave, is a curiously engraved slab which is worth
mentioning

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

in this connection, for it represents a sort of "chemin de Jérusalem,"
though not indeed of the usual type. It shows, around a large circle,
mountains, rivers, towns, roads, and animals, together with the word
IhERVSALEM, whilst the interior of the circle is divided into three
horizontal compartments, in each of which are placed various objects
indistinguishable through wear. The slab was very

FIG. 55.—Labyrinth in Poitiers Cathedral. (Auber.)  
</span>

much worn when described by Wallet and has possibly been replaced by
now.

A queer type of labyrinth was formerly represented in the Cathedral of
Poitiers. It perished long ago, but for some time subsequently there
remained on the wall of the north aisle a sketch of it ([Fig.
55](#img_fig055).md), which, however, gave no clue to the dimensions of the
original. It will be seen that the construction is such that he who
traces the path eventually emerges—like the poet of the "Rubaiyat"—by
that same door at which he entered; he will have

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

encountered no "stops," but he may have "looped the loop" an indefinite
number of times.

In the old abbey of Toussaints, Châlons-sur-Marne, which was destroyed
in 1544, there was a series of tiles each bearing a small labyrinth of
the conventional Cretan type ([Fig. 56](ml13.htm#img_fig056.md). See plate,
[p. 74](ml13.htm#page_74).md). Pavement-tiles with labyrinths were also
found in the Abbaye de Pont l’Abbé (Finistère).

A pavement labyrinth has been described as existing in the floor of the
guard chamber of the Abbey of St. Stephen at Caen. Dawson Turner, in his
"Tour in Normandy," thus refers to it: "The floor is laid with tiles,
each near five inches square, baked almost to vitrification. Eight rows
of these tiles, running east to west, are charged with different coats
of arms, said to be those of the families who attended Duke William in
his invasion of England. The intervals between these rows are filled up
with a kind of tessellated pavement, the middle whereof represents a
maze or labyrinth, about ten feet in diameter, and so artfully contrived
that, were we to suppose a man following all the intricate meanders of
the volutes, he could not travel less than a mile before he got from one
end to the other. The remainder of the floor is inlaid with small
squares of different colours, placed alternately and formed into draught
or chess boards, for the amusement of the soldiers while on guard." The
pavement was destroyed in 1802.

It has frequently been stated that a pavement labyrinth existed in a
church at Aix near Marseilles, but probably this is due to confusion
with the Roman pavement already referred to.

The only examples recorded as having existed in Germany were situated in
two churches at Cologne, but these have long since disappeared.

In view of the widespread occurrence of these devices in mediaeval
churches it would be surprising if the idea were not sometimes utilised
by modern architects

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

attempting to reproduce the spirit of the old buildings, and in fact
this was done in the case of the prize plans submitted <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) by the English architects Clutton and Burges
for the Church of Notre-Dame de la Treille at Lille. Burges designed for
the nave a "Chemin de Jérusalem" of a wonderful pattern, the topography
of "Jerusalem" being based upon the account in the "Ecclesiastical
History" of the Venerable Bede (V. ch. 16). A good modern

</span>

example, 20 ft. square, may be seen in the pavement of Ely Cathedral,
near the west door ([Fig. 57](#img_fig057).md). It was constructed by Sir
Gilbert Scott during his restorations in 18 70. Some other modern
specimens will be mentioned presently.

As to the function and meaning of the old church labyrinths, various
opinions have been held. Some authorities have thought that they were
merely introduced as a

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

symbol of the perplexities and intricacies which beset the Christian's
path. Others considered them to typify the entangling nature of sin or
of any deviation from the rectilinear path of Christian duty. It has
often been asserted, though on what evidence is not clear, that the
larger examples were used for the performance of miniature pilgrimages
in substitution for the long and tedious journeys formerly laid upon
penitents. Some colour is lent to this supposition by the name "Chemin
de Jérusalem." In the days of the first crusades it was a common
practice for the confessor to send the peccant members of his flock
either to fight against the infidel, or, after the victory of Geoffrey
of Bouillon, to visit the Holy Sepulchre. As enthusiasm for the crusades
declined, shorter pilgrimages were substituted, usually to the shrine of
some saint, such as Our Lady of Loretto, or St. Thomas of Canterbury,
and it is quite possible that, at a time when the soul had passed out of
the crusades and the Church's authority was on the ebb, a journey on the
knees around the labyrinth's sinuosities was prescribed as an
alternative to these pilgrimages. Perhaps this type of penance was from
the first imposed on those who, through weakness or any other reason,
were unable to undertake long travels.

In the case of the wall labyrinths, of course, the journey would be less
arduous still, being performed by the index finger.

Whether such practices ever obtained or not, most writers who have had
occasion to mention church labyrinths during the past century have
adopted, more or less without question, the view that not only were the
labyrinths used in this way, but that they were in fact designed for the
purpose.

This view seems to rest chiefly on a statement by J. B. F. Géruzez in
his "Description of the City of Rheims" (1817), to the effect that the
labyrinth which formerly lay in the cathedral was in origin an object of

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

devotion, being the emblem of the interior of the Temple of Jerusalem,
but Géruzez quotes no authority for his assertion. Another explanation,
based upon the occurrence of the figures of the architects or founders
in certain of the designs, is that the labyrinth was a sort of masonic
seal, signifying that the pious aim of the builder had been to raise to
the glory of God a structure to vie with the splendours of the
traditional Labyrinth. It is also said that in some cases the "Chemins"
were used for processional purposes.

Some writers have held that the labyrinth was inserted in the church as
typifying the Christian's life or the devious course of those who yield
to temptation. Some have thought that it represented the path from the
house of Pilate to Calvary, pointing out that Chateaubriand, in his
"Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem," mentioned two hours as the period
which he took to repeat Christ's journey, and that the same time would
be taken in traversing the average pavement labyrinth on the knees.

The use of the labyrinth as a simile for the Christian's life is shown
in a stone inscription in the Museum at Lyons:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

HOC SPECVLO • SPECVLARE LEGENS • QVOD SIS MORITVRVS  
QVOD CINIS IMMOLVTVM QVOD VERMIBVS ESCA FVTVRVS  
SED TAMEN VT SEMPER VIVAS • MALE VIVERE VITA  
XPM QVESO ROGA • SIT VT IN XPO MEA VITA  
ME CAPVT APRIL’ • EX HOC RAPVIT LABERINTO  
PREBITVM • DOCEO VERSV MA\_ FVNERA QN̄TO:  
                  STEPHANVS • FECIT OC.

</div>

Whether this inscription was ever attached to a labyrinthine design is
not known.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

It is strange if, amongst all the great mass of mediaeval ecclesiastical
literature, there is actually no indication of the use or significance
of these monuments in the service of the Church; but no light appears to
be forthcoming from this source, and certainly the writings of the chief
authorities of these times give no support to any of the theories
mentioned above.

<span id="img_fig058"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG.

FIG. 58.—Labyrinth in Church at Bourn, Cambs. (W. H. M.)  
</span>

It is noteworthy that in none of the known examples do any distinctively
Christian emblems occur, and that, amongst all the myriad inscriptions,
paintings, and carvings of the early Christians, in the catacombs of
Rome and elsewhere, the labyrinth never once figures.

So far as these islands are concerned the practice of placing labyrinths
in churches does not seem to have become common.

In the "Architectural Dictionary" (1867) mention is

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

made of one formerly existing in Canterbury Cathedral, but no
particulars are given.

On the floor below the tower of the church at Bourn, Cambridgeshire, is
a maze ([Fig. 58](#img_fig058).md) worked in black and red tiles, the
centre being occupied by the font, the step of which forms the terminus
of the path. From the fact that an intermediate portion of the path is
concealed beneath the base of the font it is plain that the position of
the latter is an after-thought, and from the design of the maze, no less
than from the character of the tiles of which it is composed, the work
would appear to be of comparatively modern date. The modern specimen at
Ely has already been mentioned.

There is also a labyrinth, in this case engraved on the floor of the
church porch, at Alkborough, Lincolnshire, but this is a modern replica
of the turf maze in the locality—a point which brings us to the subject
of our next chapter.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[66:1](ml12.htm#fr_3.md) These plans, although
awarded the prize, were not adopted, the designs actually carried out
being some by a native architect who obtained tenth place in the
competition.
