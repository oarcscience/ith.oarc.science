# CHAPTER XXIII

### MISCELLANEA AND CONCLUSION

IN the *Annales Archéologiques* for 1857 it was stated that M. Bonnin,
of Evreux, had collected no less than 200 designs of mazes or
labyrinths, representative of all sorts of nations and periods, and the
editor promised to make a selection of these for reproduction as soon as
the text to accompany them should be ready. The editor of the *Annales*
incidentally referred to an early sixteenth-century painting on wood, in
the palace of the Marquis Campana, which represented the legend of
Theseus and showed a labyrinth similar to that of St. Maria in Aquiro at
Rome. This also was to have been illustrated at the same time. The
matter seems to have rested there, however, for no subsequent reference
appeared.

As an instance of the unlikely places in which the employment of
labyrinth figures for decorative or symbolic purposes are sometimes
found, we may quote an entry which occurs in an inventory of the
contents of a house at Duffus, Morayshire, dated May 25, 1708, from
which it would appear that household napery, at that time, was sometimes
patterned with the labyrinth:

<span class="small">"*In the Nurserie*. A large neprie press, wherein
there is six pair Scots holland sheits . . . three fyn towels and five
of the walls of troy."</span>

Mr. Albert Way, in his notes to Dr. Trollope's memoir on Labyrinths in
1858, after referring to the

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

popularity of mazes and "Troy-towns" in Scotland, mentions a labyrinth
incised on the stone bench in one of the window recesses of the hall at
Craigmillar Castle.

According to a Swedish publication of 1877, labyrinths have been found
in West Gothland engraved on church bells!

The hedge maze is, of course, the chief embodiment of the labyrinth idea
as a medium of amusement, but it is far from being the only form in
which the principle subserves this purpose.

We have already referred to the practice, noted in various parts of
England and Wales, of cutting "Troy-towns" in the turf. Most of us are,
moreover, familiar with the schoolboy pastime of drawing mazes on paper,
or on slates in the days before they were banished on hygienic grounds;
the object of the designer in this case differing from that of the
Troy-town constructors in that it consists of providing as difficult a
puzzle as one's ingenuity at the moment can devise, whereas the latter
merely laid out a conventional unicursal figure for the purpose of
performing a ceremonial or playing a game thereon, like the squares for
nine-men's morris or the diagram for hop-scotch.

An ingenious development of the hedge maze principle is the construction
of indoor mazes lined with mirrors, by means of which the perplexity of
the visitor is very greatly increased. Such "mirror mazes" often find a
place in fairs and exhibitions.

Another method of utilising the puzzle-maze idea, and one which
constitutes a valuable asset to the parent or nurse in charge of young
children at the sea-side, is that of scratching maze-figures on the
sands, of sufficient dimensions to enable little feet to perambulate the
paths. Figures [141](#img_fig141) and [142](#img_fig142.md) show some of
the mazes constructed on the sands of a well-known southern resort in
the summer of 1920. The examples shown were made in a quiet corner of
the beach and were "snapped" before

the children had discovered them; otherwise, although no doubt prettier
pictures would have resulted, the mazes would have been invisible.

Figure 143 shows the plan of a small temporary maze constructed by the
writer for a garden fête held in aid of local church funds in the
grounds of Mr. Kenneth Goschen, at Eastcote, Middlesex, on May 25, 1921.
It was formed of galvanised-wire netting supported on six-foot fir
stakes and thickened with elm foliage. At the entrance was displayed a
conventional labyrinth design.

slightly modified to convey the misleading suggestion that it was a key
to the maze, and below this were the following lines:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Beware the dreadful Minotaur  
That dwells within the Maze.  
The monster feasts on human gore  
And bones of those he slays.  
Then softly through the labyrinth creep  
And rouse him not to strife.  
Take one short peep, prepare to leap  
*And run to save your life!*</span>

</div>

At the goal was placed a chair facing an embowered mirror.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

Some readers may remember the publication many years ago of highly
coloured lithographs of mazes, of bizarre design, generally emanating
from the Continent and sold for a penny or twopence. An old scrap-book
seen by the writer contains some specimens of this nature, published in
Brussels. In some the "nodes" are occupied by various objects which,
according to the printed instructions, have to be visited in a given
order. One design, generously tinted in all the colours of the spectrum,
is labelled "Le Jardin Chinois," although there is nothing distinctively
Chinese about it except the absence of all <span id="img_fig144"></span>

resemblance to anything European. One may still purchase in the
toy-shops coloured labyrinths of this kind, mounted on cardboard, with
spaces at various points of the path for the accommodation of counters,
which are moved progressively in accordance with the throws of dice by
the competing players.

Some very ingenious applications of the labyrinth idea have been evolved
by modern designers of toys and games.

Perhaps the most popular toy of this nature on the market is that of the
"Pigs in Clover" type, consisting of a series of concentric interrupted
circular walls, the inner-most of which constitutes the goal into which
the player strives to roll all the marbles—usually three in number—which
are seen through the glass cover ([Fig. 144](#img_fig144).md). This toy was
patented by A. Brentano in 1889. Some skill is required to get all the
marbles into the central compartment at the same time. Another toy of
this character is seen in [Fig. 145](#img_fig145.md). It consists of a
rather complicated maze formed of ridges, between which the player

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

rolls a ball or a globule of mercury from the point marked A to that
marked B, or *vice versa*. This was patented by S. D. Nix in 1891.

A somewhat similar arrangement, but with the addition of magnetism as
the motive force, is that devised by J. M. Arnot in 1894, and shown in
[Fig. 146](#img_fig146.md). In this

<span id="img_fig145"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG. 145.—Maze

</span>

case the maze is not flat but is in the form of a shallow dome; the
balls are of iron and are rolled not by tilting the box but by moving a
magnet beneath it.

R. A. Cuthbert and W. Bevitt patented in 1889 a toy in which a ball,
called "The Man in the Maze," is rolled about inside a small closed box,
the internal partitions of which cannot be seen but are indicated on the
outside of the case. The "Man" is invisible during his journey.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

At about the same time a somewhat similar toy was brought out by J.
Proctor, in which, however, the travelling ball can be watched through
the glass top, the puzzle element in this case consisting of the use of
circular holes of two sizes for communicating between adjacent
compartments, one size being just large enough to permit of the passage
of the ball, the other just too small ([Fig. 147](#img_fig147).md)

The most complex puzzle of the kind so far produced is that patented by
H. Bridge in 1906 and shown in [Fig. 148](#img_fig148.md). The ball in this
case is made to pass through channels formed between projections of
labyrinthine pattern fixed to a base and others fixed to the transparent
top, which can be moved relatively to the base. The toy may be of a
circular pattern or rectangular. In the former case the top is rotated,
in the latter it is slid from

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

side to side. The patent also covers cases in which the toy constructed
on the "skeleton" principle, the use of

</span>

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

a ring in place of a ball, and the combination of more than two mazes.

It now remains for some inventor of Einsteinian proclivities to devise
one in several dimensions!

An interesting little study in what one might call "Labyrinth
Psychology" was carried out by an Austrian biologist in connection with
his researches on "The Evolution of Efficiency in the Animal Kingdom,"
in 1917. This was a series of experiments to test the efficiency of
animals in learning to thread a labyrinth in search of food. [Figs. 149,
150 and 151](#img_fig149-51.md) show three stages in the

education of a rat in this respect, the dotted line representing the
track followed by the animal from the entrance to the food-containing
centre of a simple form of labyrinth.

Some sort of game, known as "Labyrinthe," enjoyed a passing favour in
France in the eighteenth century. An advertisement of May 8, 1869,
referring to one offered for sale by a Parisian upholsterer named
Lechevin, describes it as "un jeu de labyrinthe a 11 cases doré d’or
moulu, avec tableau dans chaque case," but this does not tell us much
concerning the nature of the pastime.

A card game of similar name was played in this country half a century
ago; it was a kind of bezique.

In France the name "Labyrinthe" is also given to a

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

children's game in which the majority of the players hold hands so as to
form a chain of arches which are threaded by two runners called
respectively *le tisserand* and *la navette*—"the weaver" and "the
shuttle."

A visitor to the Latin Convent on the summit of Mount Carmel, Palestine,
in 1874, described a "verbal labyrinth" which he saw displayed on a
board hanging on the wall of an inner staircase. It was called "The
Labyrinth of St. Bernard," and consisted of a number of words or short
phrases arranged in a square, as shown below. By selecting the words in
the proper order five maxims are obtained "by which man may live well."
The first of these maxims, commencing with the word at the foot of the
left-hand column, is: *Noli dicere omnia quae scis quia qui dicit omnia
quae scit saepe audit quod non vult*.

The remaining four injunctions may be read by similarly utilising the
words in the bottom row with those in the second, third, fourth, and
fifth rows respectively:

LABYRINTHUS A DIVO BERNARDO

COMPOSITUS QUO BENE VIVIT HOMO

<div align="center">

|----------|------------|----------|------------|----------------|------------|

| NOLI     | OMNIA QUAE | QUIA QUI | OMNIA QUAE | SAEPE          | QUOD       |

</div>

As a sample of a verbal labyrinth this seems to be very simple and
straightforward in comparison with the average At of Parliament.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

Let us turn now, for a brief space, to a question which, although
bearing upon matters dealt with earlier in the book, has been too little
investigated to warrant more than a nodding reference in our more
serious chapters—the question of place-names.

The occurrence of a suggestive place-name is, as previously hinted, very
slender evidence by itself on which to form an opinion of the former
existence of a maze in the locality. There is always the possibility
that the name may be a corruption of some ancient word of very different
significance, perhaps the name of some person, or that it may have been
bestowed fancifully or in respect of some resemblance to another place.

In the absence of fuller information we will limit our-selves to the
bare mention of such names as convey a suggestion of possible maze
sites, merely remarking any cases in which evidence in one direction or
the other has come to notice.

The district known as Maze Pond, familiar to Londoners in the
neighbourhood of the Borough, and to which we made reference in Chapter
XV, takes its name from the ancient manor of the Maze, which was in the
holding of Sir John Burcestre in the fifteenth century. An old token
bears the inscription, "Michael Blower, at ye Maze, Southwarke." What
kind of maze, if any, formerly existed in the locality we do not know.

Maze Hill has sometimes been assumed to derive its name from a maze
which is supposed to have existed in the park of the former royal palace
of Greenwich (see p. 36), but the name was formerly spelt in a different
manner and may have quite another origin. In Hasted's "History of Kent,"
1778, it is referred to as Mease Hill, and it has been suggested that
this may have come from the Celtic word *Maes*, meaning "field." There
is a Maze Green in Hertfordshire, near Bishops Stortford. Possibly there
was formerly a turf maze in the vicinity like that on

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Saffron Walden
common, not very far away, but we have no evidence to that effect.

A few miles west of Lisburn, in Ireland, are two places named
respectively "The Maze" and "Mazetown," the former a small village in
Antrim, the latter a racing centre just over the county border in Down.

"Troy-town," as we have seen, also occurs as a place-name. In Dorset
there is one near Dorchester and another near Bere Regis. These are
alleged to be the sites of former turf mazes, of which, however, there
are no authentic records. In Kent there is one near Hastingleigh, and
the name also occurs at Rochester. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) The
latter is said to commemorate a former owner or builder of property in
that part of the town, whose name happened to be Troy. A part of Peckham
also used to be known as Troy-town.

The word "Troy" alone is also of fairly frequent occurrence, as for
instance near Stalybridge, Lancs, and near Londonderry; Troy Michell and
Troy Hall are found in Monmouthshire, and the latter name also at
Blackburn, Lancs, but such names are no more likely to have any
connection with ancient maze sites than is the flourishing city of
similar name in the United States, the probability being that in all
these cases it is the famous Troy of the Iliad that furnished the
inspiration. The name of Troy-town may in some cases have been given on
account of irregularity or intricacy of design, for the word is found in
certain local dialects as a synonym for a state of confusion, an untidy
house being said to be "just like Troy-town."

It is surely uncommon for the word "Labyrinth" itself to be found as a
place-name, but in February 1911 Captain Scott pitched his camp in an
Antarctic spot which, on account of the fantastically sinuous nature of
its surroundings, he decided to name "Labyrinth Camp."

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

We must now draw to a close.

Enough has perhaps been said to give some idea of the variety and extent
of the different ways in which the labyrinth idea has developed and in
which it has been employed, but it would obviously be wrong to assume
that the last word on the subject has now been pronounced.

As regards the early history of the idea and of the terms associated
with it we have seen that the boundaries of our knowledge are still
misty and ill-defined, a circumstance that only gives zest to the study
of the subject.

We see that our enquiry has taken us into realms far removed from
everyday experience and in which we feel the need of special training in
order to weigh the facts presented. It has given us glimpses of the
workshop of the archaeologist, the anthropologist, and the etymologist.

The study of later developments has led us into curious by-paths of art
and literature—classical, mediaeval, renaissance, and modern—and we see
that even now the labyrinth idea has not entirely ceased to exercise its
allurements or to evoke the spirit of invention.

There is still room for a good deal of research and for the possibility
of highly interesting discoveries in respect of almost every phase of
the labyrinth's past history.

With regard to its future developments, much as we should have liked to
close our review with a vindication of utilitarian interest, and
although one can never safely prophesy to what uses the ingenuity of men
may put any given principle, we could not hope to sound an expectant
note without creating an impression of fatuity. Lest this statement be
taken to mean that our enquiry has, therefore, had no practical aim, let
us hasten to repeat once more the hope expressed in our introductory
chapter to the effect that a perusal of this little book will at least
ensure a revival of interest in, and consequently the preservation of,
those few relics of rustic revelry and

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

prehistoric magic which yet remain with us in the shape of the turf
labyrinths.

As Mr. A. H. Allcroft, in his "Earthwork of England" (1908), has truly
remarked, when speaking of the Asenby maze: "It is marvellous that the
memory of such things, once prominent features of rural life, can die
out so rapidly as it does." And yet, who can deny that they are worthy
of at least as much care and interest as many of the obvious and
commonplace antiquities upon which the guide-books lavish their
encomiums?

We need not emulate the misguided enthusiasm of those who are unable to
discover a merit in a bygone practice without plunging into an
indiscriminate advocacy of its revival—an enthusiasm which inevitably
brings discredit upon its object—but let us at any rate see to it that
no more of these rare and interesting heirlooms are lost to us through
ignorance or neglect.
