# CHAPTER XIX

### THE BOWER OF "FAIR ROSAMOND"

THE story of "Fair Rosamond" and her mazy Bower, though it cannot lay
claim to that standard of authenticity which is generally required of
historical data, has for so long occupied an honoured position in the
realm of popular romance that, in a book professing to treat of mazes
from a broad point of view, we cannot dismiss it quite as briefly as we
might perhaps do in a book on English history.

"Fair Rosamond" has been stated, without very much foundation, to have
been the daughter of Walter de Clifford, and is in consequence
frequently referred to as Rosamond Clifford.

The story runs that King Henry the Second (A.D. 1133 to 1189) adopted
her as his mistress, and that, in order to conceal his illicit amours
from his Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, he conducted them within the
innermost recesses of a most complicated maze which he caused to be made
in his park at Woodstock. Rumours of her spouse's defections having
reached the ears of Queen Eleanor, that indignant lady contrived to
penetrate the labyrinth, confronted her terrified and tearful rival, and
forced her to choose between the dagger and the bowl of poison; she
drained the latter and became forthwith defunct.

Various trimmings, more or less scandalous in nature,

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

gathered around the central tale, as, for instance, that Rosamond
presented Henry with the son who was afterwards known as William
Longsword, Earl of Salisbury, but the main outline as indicated above
was handed down intact for many generations.

The poisoning incident is not mentioned in the account given by a
chronicler of that time, John Brompton, Abbot of Jervaulx (Yorks). It
seems to have been first recorded by a French scribe in the fourteenth
century.

Brompton's version, given under the year 1151 in his "Chronicon," is as
follows:

"Sane idem rex *Henricus* quanquam multis virtutibus fuerat ornatus,
aliquibus tamen viciis involutus personam regiam deturpavit. In libidine
namque pronus conjugalem modum excessit. Regina enim sua *Elianora*
jamdudum incarcerata factus est adulter manifestus, palam et impudice
puellam retinens *Rosamundam*. Huic nempe puellae spectatissimae fecerat
rex apud *Wodestoke* mirabilis architecturae cameram operi *Daedalino*
similem, ne forsan a regina facile deprehenderetur. Sed ilia cito obiit,
et apud *Godestowe* juxta *Oxoniam* in capitulo monialium in tumba
decenti est sepulta, ubi talis suprascriptio invenitur:

"*Hic facet in tumba Rosa mundi, non Rosa munda;  
Non redolet, sed olet, quae redolere solet.*"

It would appear from this account that the "bower" was a labyrinth of an
architectural kind, perhaps like that mentioned in Chapter XIV as having
been built at Ardres by Louis of Bourbourg in the previous century, not,
as popularly believed, a maze of evergreens. It will be seen, also, that
Henry did not long enjoy his clandestine delights, for Rosamond shortly
died and was buried before the high altar of the nunnery church of
Godstowe. Her death is believed to have taken place about 1176. It is
possible that she had entered the nunnery some time

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

before that. According to the contemporary annalist Roger de Hoveden her
body was removed in 1191 by Bishop Hugh of Lincoln, on moral grounds,
and was apparently re-interred in the chapter-house.

The imprisonment of Queen Eleanor, referred to by Brompton, was a
consequence of her connivance at the rebellion of her sons in 1173-74.

Ranulph Higden, who lived in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
deals with the Henry and Rosamond story in the seventh book of his
"Polychronicon," and tells us that visitors to Godstowe Abbey used to be
shown a wonderful coffer which had belonged to Rosamond. It contained
figures of birds, beasts, fishes and boxing men, which, by clockwork or
springs, were endowed with apparently spontaneous motion (Cista ejusdem
puella vix bipedalis mensura, sed mirabilis architectura ibidem
cernitur; in qua conflictus pugilem, gestus animalium, volatus avium,
saltus piscium, absque hominis impulsu conspiciuntur).

Most of the subsequent chroniclers seem to have followed Higden in their
relation of the story. By Tudor times the romantic and tragic episode
had become a favourite theme in popular lore; it was enshrined by the
Elizabethan poet Drayton in his "Epistle to Rosamond," the bower being
therein described as an arrangement of subterranean vaults. It achieved
its greatest popularity, however, in the ballad form, and was printed,
with several other "Strange Histories or Songs and Sonnets of Kinges,
Princes, Dukes, Lords, Ladyes, Knights and Gentlemen, etc.," in a
black-letter volume written or edited by Thomas Delone (or Delorney) in
1612. Two editions of the ballad were represented in the collection of
Samuel Pepys, under the title of "The Life and Death of Rosamond, King
Henry the Second's Concubine. And how she was Poysoned to Death by Queen
Elenor."

John Aubrey, in his "Remaines," 1686, tells us that his nurse used to
sing the following verses to him:

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Yea, Rosamond, fair Rosamond,  
  Her name was called so,  
To whom dame Elinor our Queene  
  Was known a deadly foe,  
The King therefore for her defence  
  Against the furious Queene  
At Woodstocke builded such a Bower  
  The like was never seen.

"Most curiously that Bower was built  
  Of stone and timber strong.  
An hundered and fifty dores  
  Did to this Bower belong,  
And they so cunningly contriv’d  
  With turnings round about  
That none but with a clew of thread  
  Could enter in or out."

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The whole ballad
will be found in the well-known "Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,"
collected by Bishop Percy and published by him in 1765.

Of a widely different nature was the version published in 1729 by Samuel
Croxall in his "Select Collection of Novels," Vol. IV. "The Loves of
King Henry II and Fair Rosamond." Here the attitude assumed is one of
learned contempt for popular credulity. "What have we in this Story,"
says Croxall, "but a Copy of Ariadne's Clue and the Cretan Labyrinth? .
. . Yet are we not to wonder that the monkish Historians should deliver
down to us a Tale of such Absurdity, when the same Chronicles tell us
that, in that King's Reign, a Dragon of marvellous Bigness was seen at
St. Osyth's in Essex, which, by its very motion, set many Houses and
Buildings on Fire."

As for the inscription on Rosamond's tomb, quoted by Brompton, our
critic is equally scornful. "The conceit," he says, "is poor and common
and, like the other Poetry of those times, depends on a certain Jingle
and Play on the Words. The sense of them has been thus expressed in
honest English Metre:"

(Whether the verse is in better taste when expressed in

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

honest English metre the reader must judge for himself.)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Rose of the World, not Rose the peerless Flow’r,  
Within this Tomb hath taken up her Bow’r.  
She scenteth now, and nothing Sweet doth smell  
Who earst was wont to savour passing well."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This rendering is
perhaps preferable to that of Stowe ("Annals," 1631), which concludes
with:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Though she were sweete, now foully doth she
stinke,  
A mirrour good for all men, that on her thinke."</span>

</div>

In any case the epitaph must be accounted a libel in one respect, for
Leland, the Antiquary to Henry VIII, records that, on the opening of
Rosamond's tomb, at the dissolution of Godstowe nunnery, the bones were
found to be encased in leather, surrounded by lead, and that "a very
swete smell came out of it."

An interesting point mentioned by Croxall is that in his time "a
delightful Bower" was still in existence at Woodstock and was shown as
the original of the story. Another reliable writer of the same period
(Thomas Hearne, 1718) makes a similar observation, but in this case it
is made clear that the remains are those of a large building, not, as we
might have inferred, those of a hedge maze or arbour. These remains,
whatever they may have been, have disappeared long since.

Woodstock Park, according to the historian Rouse of Warwick, was the
first park to be made in England. Henry the First had a palace here, but
the present great building, the masterpiece of Sir John Vanbrugh, was
built for the first Duke of Marlborough and was named after the scene of
his famous victory, Blenheim.

The traditional story of Fair Rosamond, in which she is made to figure
as a cruelly wronged and guileless damsel of impregnable virtue and the
victim of an unreasoning jealousy, formed the basis of many novels,

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

*e.g.*, "Fair Rosamond," by T. Miller ("The Parlour Library"), 1847, and
as late as 1911 it was cast into the form of a one-act tragedy by Mr.
Oliver W. F. Lodge, under the name of "The Labyrinth," and was first
performed by the Pilgrim Players on October 14 in that year. A
little-known opera by Addison deals with the same theme; it is entitled
"Rosamond" and is inscribed to the Duchess of Marlborough. The most
poignant and beautiful version of the tragedy is that given by Swinburne
in his "Rosamond" (not, of course, to be confused with his "Rosamund").

Tennyson, in his "Becket," makes that prelate rescue Rosamond from the
Queen at the crucial moment and take her to Godstowe nunnery, whence she
later escapes to intercede—ineffectually—with his murderers in
Canterbury Cathedral.

No authentic portrait of Rosamond is known to exist, but in Hampton
Court Palace, just outside Cardinal Wolsey's Room, there hangs a
half-length female portrait by an unknown painter (No. 961 \[937\]),
which is labelled Rosamond Clifford. The lady depicted, however, is
attired in a fashion which did not obtain until considerably later than
the time of Rosamond; in fact, there seems to be no justification
whatever for assuming that the picture represents the fair Rosamond at
all, except perhaps in the imagination of the artist.
