The Necronomicon originated as a fictional book in the works of H.P.
Lovecraft, and grew into an extended literary in-joke as other horror
writers organically added to the Cthulhu mythos. According to Lovecraft,
it was written by Abdul Alhazred, 'a mad Arab poet of the Yemen', in 950
A.D. in Damascus. In many of the stories written by Lovecraft and his
successors, merely reading or possessing the Necronomicon leads to
insanity ...or worse.

A collection of most of Lovecraft's stories, which due to either the
date of publication or lack of renewal have become public domain in the
United States. The following mention the *Necronomicon*:

[The Call of Cthulhu](hpl/hpl31.md)  
[The Dunwich Horror](hpl/hpl32.md)  
[The Whisperer in the Darkness, Chapter 2](hpl/hpl36.md)  
[The Whisperer in the Darkness, Chapter 7](hpl/hpl41.md)  
[The Haunter of the Dark](hpl/hpl47.md)  
[The Shadow out of Time, Chapter 3](hpl/hpl50.md)  
[The Thing on the Doorstep](hpl/hpl57.md)  
[The Book](hpl/hpl59.md)  
[The Descendant](hpl/hpl60.md)  
[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, Chapter II](hpl/hpl63.md)  

The Necronomicon was not the only book which Lovecraft dreamed up, it is
just the most famous. There is a whole list of others cited in his
works, such as the Book of Eibon, the Pnakotic Manuscripts, "the Cultes
des Goules of Comte d'Erlette, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von
Junzt, and old Ludvig Prinn's hellish De Vermis Mysteriis" ([Haunter of
the Dark](hpl/hpl47).md). He also threw in references to actual books and
authors to blur the distinction between reality and fiction, some of
which are available at this site:

[The Book of Dzayan](../atl/dzyan/dzyan.md)  
[Hermes Trismegistus](../alc/goldtrac.md)  
[the Turba Philosophorum](../alc/turba.md)  
[Olaus Wormius](../neu/ossian/oss07.md)

So is the Necronomicon real? The answer may be another question
entirely: real in what sense? The normative, majority opinion is that
the book is entirely fictional and that any other position is either
self-delusion or prevarication. And why should we even care? It is
because of the light that this issue can shed on the question of how the
*provenance* of an authentic text is determined.

The provenance of a text is a set of criteria which scholars use to
evaluate its authenticity. First of all, a text is usually referenced in
other historic texts. For instance, the Book (possibly Books) of Enoch
were mentioned in the Bible. The Gospel of Judas is mentioned in the
writings of the Early Church Fathers as a heretical text. Manuscripts of
the Book of Enoch were found in Ethiopia in the 17th century, and a
papyrus of the Gospel of Judas finally turned up in the 21st century.
However, there is no mention of a work called the Necronomicon until the
20th century. Secondly, there must be a manuscript that scholars can
examine openly and subject to tests such as carbon dating and pollen
analysis. No such manuscript of the Necronomicon has turned up, and
until one does, it must be considered fictional. Other characteristics
of an authentic text, which the Necronomicon fails to demonstrate,
include a chain of ownership, multiple manuscripts with small
variations, as well as linguistic and other internal evidence which
places its composition in a specific time and place.

Some claim that a book that people *want* to read will appear
spontaneously. It is hard to argue with circular logic of this sort.
However, perhaps this 'self-actualizing text' argument is true in one
sense. Librarians have been known to insert spurious catalog entries for
the Necronomicon, just for fun. And market demand has definitely
produced several Necronomicons to sate peoples' curiosity. *Caveat
Emptor*.

As the obsession with the Necronomicon grew over the years, a number of
books emerged to fill the demand, most notably the [Simon
Necronomicon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380751925/internetsacredte.md).
This purports to be a Sumerian grimoire, translated from a Greek
manuscript of shady provenance. Simon has recently published a
fascinating account of the publication of his Necronomicon, [Dead
Names](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006078704X/internetsacredte.md).
[The Chaosium
Necronomicon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/156882162X/internetsacredte.md)
is an anthology of fiction about the Necronomicon and several fictional
Necronomicons, including a lovingly crafted pastiche by the late science
fiction writer Lin Carter. A recent entry is Donald Tyson's
[Necronomicon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738706272/internetsacredte.md),
which is firmly rooted in Lovecraft's universe. Less satisfying is Al
Azif, which is simply a couple of hundred pages of illegible script in
an unknown language.
