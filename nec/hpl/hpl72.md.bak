# The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (The Arkham Sampler, 1948)

Three times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvelous city, and three
times was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace
above it. All golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset, with walls,
temples, colonnades and arched bridges of veined marble, silver-basined
fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens, and
wide streets marching between delicate trees and blossom-laden urns and
ivory statues in gleaming rows; while on steep northward slopes climbed
tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of
grassy cobbles. It was a fever of the gods, a fanfare of supernal
trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals. Mystery hung about it as
clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain; and as Carter stood
breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to
him the poignancy and suspense of almost-vanished memory, the pain of
lost things and the maddening need to place again what once had been an
awesome and momentous place.

He knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme; though in
what cycle or incarnation he had known it, or whether in dream or in
waking, he could not tell. Vaguely it called up glimpses of a far
forgotten first youth, when wonder and pleasure lay in all the mystery
of days, and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetic to the eager
sound of lutes and song, unclosing fiery gates toward further and
surprising marvels. But each night as he stood on that high marble
terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that
hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the bondage
of dream's tyrannous gods; for in no wise could he leave that lofty
spot, or descend the wide marmoreal fights flung endlessly down to where
those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and beckoning.

When for the third time he awakened with those flights still undescended
and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed, he prayed long and
earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood capricious above the
clouds on unknown Kadath, in the cold waste where no man treads. But the
gods made no answer and shewed no relenting, nor did they give any
favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream, and invoked them
sacrificially through the bearded priests of Nasht and Kaman-Thah, whose
cavern-temple with its pillar of flame lies not far from the gates of
the waking world. It seemed, however, that his prayers must have been
adversely heard, for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to
behold the marvellous city; as if his three glimpses from afar had been
mere accidents or oversights, and against some hidden plan or wish of
the gods.

At length, sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and
cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs, nor able sleeping or
waking to drive them from his mind, Carter resolved to go with bold
entreaty whither no man had gone before, and dare the icy deserts
through the dark to where unknown Kadath, veiled in cloud and crowned
with unimagined stars, holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the
Great Ones.

In light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame
and talked of this design to the bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah.
And the priests shook their pshent-bearing heads and vowed it would be
the death of his soul. They pointed out that the Great Ones had shown
already their wish, and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed
by insistent pleas. They reminded him, too, that not only had no man
ever been to Kadath, but no man had ever suspected in what part of space
it may lie; whether it be in the dreamlands around our own world, or in
those surrounding some unguessed companion of Fomalhaut or Aldebaran. If
in our dreamland, it might conceivably be reached, but only three human
souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious
gulfs to other dreamlands, and of that three, two had come back quite
mad. There were, in such voyages, incalculable local dangers; as well as
that shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the
ordered universe, where no dreams reach; that last amorphous blight of
nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all
infinity - the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare
speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers
beyond time amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the
thin, monotonous whine of accursed flutes; to which detestable pounding
and piping dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic Ultimate
gods, the blind, voiceless, tenebrous, mindless Other gods whose soul
and messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.

Of these things was Carter warned by the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah in
the cavern of flame, but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown
Kadath in the cold waste, wherever that might be, and to win from them
the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous sunset city. He
knew that his journey would be strange and long, and that the Great Ones
would be against it; but being old in the land of dream he counted on
many useful memories and devices to aid him. So asking a formal blessing
of the priests and thinking shrewdly on his course, he boldly descended
the seven hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper Slumber and set out
through the Enchanted Wood.

In the tunnels of that twisted wood, whose low prodigious oaks twine
groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi,
dwell the furtive and secretive Zoogs; who know many obscure secrets of
the dream world and a few of the waking world, since the wood at two
places touches the lands of men, though it would be disastrous to say
where. Certain unexplained rumours, events, and vanishments occur among
men where the Zoogs have access, and it is well that they cannot travel
far outside the world of dreams. But over the nearer parts of the dream
world they pass freely, flitting small and brown and unseen and bearing
back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the
forest they love. Most of them live in burrows, but some inhabit the
trunks of the great trees; and although they live mostly on fungi it is
muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat, either physical or
spiritual, for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who have
not come out. Carter, however, had no fear; for he was an old dreamer
and had learnt their fluttering language and made many a treaty with
them; having found through their help the splendid city of Celephais in
Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills, where reigns half the year the
great King Kuranes, a man he had known by another name in life. Kuranes
was the one soul who had been to the star-gulls and returned free from
madness.

Threading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic
trunks, Carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the Zoogs, and
listened now and then for responses. He remembered one particular
village of the creatures was in the centre of the wood, where a circle
of great mossy stones in what was once a cleaning tells of older and
more terrible dwellers long forgotten, and toward this spot he hastened.
He traced his way by the grotesque fungi, which always seem better
nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings danced
and sacrificed. Finally the great light of those thicker fungi revealed
a sinister green and grey vastness pushing up through the roof of the
forest and out of sight. This was the nearest of the great ring of
stones, and Carter knew he was close to the Zoog village. Renewing his
fluttering sound, he waited patiently; and was at last rewarded by an
impression of many eyes watching him. It was the Zoogs, for one sees
their weird eyes long before one can discern their small, slippery brown
outlines.

Out they swarmed, from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree, till the
whole dim-litten region was alive with them. Some of the wilder ones
brushed Carter unpleasantly, and one even nipped loathsomely at his ear;
but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders. The
Council of Sages, recognizing the visitor, offered a gourd of fermented
sap from a haunted tree unlike the others, which had grown from a seed
dropt down by someone on the moon; and as Carter drank it ceremoniously
a very strange colloquy began. The Zoogs did not, unfortunately, know
where the peak of Kadath lies, nor could they even say whether the cold
waste is in our dream world or in another. Rumours of the Great Ones
came equally from all points; and one might only say that they were
likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in valleys, since on
such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is above and the
clouds beneath.

Then one very ancient Zoog recalled a thing unheard-of by the others;
and said that in Ulthar, beyond the River Skai, there still lingered the
last copy of those inconceivably old Pnakotic Manuscripts made by waking
men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of dreams when
the hairy cannibal Gnophkehs overcame many-templed Olathoe and slew all
the heroes of the land of Lomar. Those manuscripts he said, told much of
the gods, and besides, in Ulthar there were men who had seen the signs
of the gods, and even one old priest who had scaled a great mountain to
behold them dancing by moonlight. He had failed, though his companion
had succeeded and perished namelessly.

So Randolph Carter thanked the Zoogs, who fluttered amicably and gave
him another gourd of moon-tree wine to take with him, and set out
through the phosphorescent wood for the other side, where the rushing
Skai flows down from the slopes of Lerion, and Hatheg and Nir and Ulthar
dot the plain. Behind him, furtive and unseen, crept several of the
curious Zoogs; for they wished to learn what might befall him, and bear
back the legend to their people. The vast oaks grew thicker as he pushed
on beyond the village, and he looked sharply for a certain spot where
they would thin somewhat, standing quite dead or dying among the
unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their
fallen brothers. There he would turn sharply aside, for at that spot a
mighty slab of stone rests on the forest floor; and those who have dared
approach it say that it bears an iron ring three feet wide. Remembering
the archaic circle of great mossy rocks, and what it was possibly set up
for, the Zoogs do not pause near that expansive slab with its huge ring;
for they realise that all which is forgotten need not necessarily be
dead, and they would not like to see the slab rise slowly and
deliberately.

Carter detoured at the proper place, and heard behind him the frightened
fluttering of some of the more timid Zoogs. He had known they would
follow him, so he was not disturbed; for one grows accustomed to the
anomalies of these prying creatures. It was twilight when he came to the
edge of the wood, and the strengthening glow told him it was the
twilight of morning. Over fertile plains rolling down to the Skai he saw
the smoke of cottage chimneys, and on every hand were the hedges and
ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful land. Once he stopped
at a farmhouse well for a cup of water, and all the dogs barked
affrightedly at the inconspicuous Zoogs that crept through the grass
behind. At another house, where people were stirring, he asked questions
about the gods, and whether they danced often upon Lerion; but the
farmer and his wile would only make the Elder Sign and tell him the way
to Nir and Ulthar.

At noon he walked through the one broad high street of Nir, which he had
once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this
direction; and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across
the Skai, into whose central piece the masons had sealed a living human
sacrifice when they built it thirteen-hundred years before. Once on the
other side, the frequent presence of cats (who all arched their backs at
the trailing Zoogs) revealed the near neighborhood of Ulthar; for in
Ulthar, according to an ancient and significant law, no man may kill a
cat. Very pleasant were the suburbs of Ulthar, with their little green
cottages and neatly fenced farms; and still pleasanter was the quaint
town itself, with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and
numberless chimney-pots and narrow hill streets where one can see old
cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough. Carter, the cats
being somewhat dispersed by the half-seen Zoogs, picked his way directly
to the modest Temple of the Elder Ones where the priests and old records
were said to be; and once within that venerable circular tower of ivied
stone - which crowns Ulthar's highest hill - he sought out the patriarch
Atal, who had been up the forbidden peak Hatheg-Kia in the stony desert
and had come down again alive.

Atal, seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the
temple, was fully three centuries old; but still very keen of mind and
memory. From him Carter learned many things about the gods, but mainly
that they are indeed only Earth's gods, ruling feebly our own dreamland
and having no power or habitation elsewhere. They might, Atal said, heed
a man's prayer if in good humour; but one must not think of climbing to
their onyx stronghold atop Kadath in the cold waste. It was lucky that
no man knew where Kadath towers, for the fruits of ascending it would be
very grave. Atal's companion Banni the Wise had been drawn screaming
into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of Hatheg-Kia. With
unknown Kadath, if ever found, matters would be much worse; for although
Earth's gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise mortal, they are
protected by the Other Gods from Outside, whom it is better not to
discuss. At least twice in the world's history the Other Gods set their
seal upon Earth's primal granite; once in antediluvian times, as guessed
from a drawing in those parts of the Pnakotic Manuscripts too ancient to
be read, and once on Hatheg-Kia when Barzai the Wise tried to see
Earth's gods dancing by moonlight. So, Atal said, it would be much
better to let all gods alone except in tactful prayers.

Carter, though disappointed by Atal's discouraging advice and by the
meagre help to be found in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Seven
Cryptical Books of Hsan, did not wholly despair. First he questioned the
old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed
terrace, thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods' aid;
but Atal could tell him nothing. Probably, Atal said, the place belonged
to his especial dream world and not to the general land of vision that
many know; and conceivably it might be on another planet. In that case
Earth's gods could not guide him if they would. But this was not likely,
since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was
something the Great Ones wished to hide from him.

Then Carter did a wicked thing, offering his guileless host so many
draughts of the moon-wine which the Zoogs had given him that the old man
became irresponsibly talkative. Robbed of his reserve, poor Atal babbled
freely of forbidden things; telling of a great image reported by
travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain Ngranek, on the
isle of Oriab in the Southern Sea, and hinting that it may be a likeness
which Earth's gods once wrought of their own features in the days when
they danced by moonlight on that mountain. And he hiccoughed likewise
that the features of that image are very strange, so that one might
easily recognize them, and that they are sure signs of the authentic
race of the gods.

Now the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to
Carter. It is known that in disguise the younger among the Great Ones
often espouse the daughters of men, so that around the borders of the
cold waste wherein stands Kadath the peasants must all bear their blood.
This being so, the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face
on Ngranek and mark the features; then, having noted them with care, to
search for such features among living men. Where they are plainest and
thickest, there must the gods dwell nearest; and whatever stony waste
lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands
Kadath.

Much of the Great Ones might be learnt in such regions, and those with
their blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker. They
might not know their parentage, for the gods so dislike to be known
among men that none can be found who has seen their faces wittingly; a
thing which Carter realized even as he sought to scale Kadath. But they
would have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows, and
would sing of far places and gardens so unlike any known even in the
dreamland that common folk would call them fools; and from all this one
could perhaps learn old secrets of Kadath, or gain hints of the
marvellous sunset city which the gods held secret. And more, one might
in certain cases seize some well-loved child of a god as hostage; or
even capture some young god himself, disguised and dwelling amongst men
with a comely peasant maiden as his bride.

Atal, however, did not know how to find Ngranek on its isle of Oriab;
and recommended that Carter follow the singing Skai under its bridges
down to the Southern Sea; where no burgess of Ulthar has ever been, but
whence the merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and
two-wheeled carts. There is a great city there, Dylath-Leen, but in
Ulthar its reputation is bad because of the black three-banked galleys
that sail to it with rubies from no clearly named shore. The traders
that come from those galleys to deal with the jewellers are human, or
nearly so, but the rowers are never beheld; and it is not thought
wholesome in Ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from
unknown places whose rowers cannot be exhibited.

By the time he had given this information Atal was very drowsy, and
Carter laid him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long
beard decorously on his chest. As he turned to go, he observed that no
suppressed fluttering followed him, and wondered why the Zoogs had
become so lax in their curious pursuit. Then he noticed all the sleek
complacent cats of Ulthar licking their chops with unusual gusto, and
recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard, in lower
parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priest's conversation. He
recalled, too, the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent
young Zoog had regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street
outside. And because he loved nothing on earth more than small black
kittens, he stooped and petted the sleek cats of Ulthar as they licked
their chops, and did not mourn because those inquisitive Zoogs would
escort him no farther.

It was sunset now, so Carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep little
street overlooking the lower town. And as he went out on the balcony of
his room and gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and cobbled ways
and the pleasant fields beyond, all mellow and magical in the slanted
light, he swore that Ulthar would be a very likely place to dwell in
always, were not the memory of a greater sunset city ever goading one
onward toward unknown perils. Then twilight fell, and the pink walls of
the plastered gables turned violet and mystic, and little yellow lights
floated up one by one from old lattice windows. And sweet bells pealed
in. the temple tower above, and the first star winked softly above the
meadows across the Skai. With the night came song, and Carter nodded as
the lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the filigreed balconies
and tesselated courts of simple Ulthar. And there might have been
sweetness even in the voices of Ulthar's many cats, but that they were
mostly heavy and silent from strange feasting. Some of them stole off to
those cryptical realms which are known only to cats and which villagers
say are on the moon's dark side, whither the cats leap from tall
housetops, but one small black kitten crept upstairs and sprang in
Carter's lap to purr and play, and curled up near his feet when he lay
down at last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed with
fragrant, drowsy herbs.

In the morning Carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for
Dylath-Leen with the spun wool of Ulthar and the cabbages of Ulthar's
busy farms. And for six days they rode with tinkling bells on the smooth
road beside the Skai; stopping some nights at the inns of little quaint
fishing towns, and on other nights camping under the stars while
snatches of boatmen's songs came from the placid river. The country was
very beautiful, with green hedges and groves and picturesque peaked
cottages and octagonal windmills.

On the seventh day a blur of smoke rose on the horizon ahead, and then
the tall black towers of Dylath-Leen, which is built mostly of basalt.
Dylath-Leen with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a
bit of the Giant's Causeway, and its streets are dark and uninviting.
There are many dismal sea-taverns near the myriad wharves, and all the
town is thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of a
few which are said to be not on earth. Carter questioned the oddly robed
men of that city about the peak of Ngranek on the isle of Oriab, and
found that they knew of it well.

Ships came from Baharna on that island, one being due to return thither
in only a month, and Ngranek is but two days' zebra-ride from that port.
But few had seen the stone face of the god, because it is on a very
difficult side of Ngranek, which overlooks only sheer crags and a valley
of sinister lava. Once the gods were angered with men on that side, and
spoke of the matter to the Other Gods.

It was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in
Dylath-Leen's sea taverns, because they mostly preferred to whisper of
the black galleys. One of them was due in a week with rubies from its
unknown shore, and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock. The mouths of
the men who came from it to trade were too wide, and the way their
turbans were humped up in two points above their foreheads was in
especially bad taste. And their shoes were the shortest and queerest
ever seen in the Six Kingdoms. But worst of all was the matter of the
unseen rowers. Those three banks of oars moved too briskly and
accurately and vigorously to be comfortable, and it was not right for a
ship to stay in port for weeks while the merchants traded, yet to give
no glimpse of its crew. It was not fair to the tavern-keepers of
Dylath-Leen, or to the grocers and butchers, either; for not a scrap of
provisions was ever sent aboard. The merchants took only gold and stout
black slaves from Parg across the river. That was all they ever took,
those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers; never
anything from the butchers and grocers, but only gold and the fat black
men of Parg whom they bought by the pound. And the odours from those
galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be
described. Only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the
hardiest denizen of the old sea-taverns bear them. Dylath-Leen would
never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable
elsewhere, but no mine in all Barth's dreamland was known to produce
their like.

Of these things Dylath-Leen's cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst
Carter waited patiently for the ship from Baharna, which might bear him
to the isle whereon carven Ngranek towers lofty and barren. Meanwhile he
did not fall to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any tales
they might have concerning Kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city
of marble walls and silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset.
Of these things, however, he learned nothing; though he once thought
that a certain old slant-eyed merchant looked queerly intelligent when
the cold waste was spoken of. This man was reputed to trade with the
horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of Leng, which no
healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar. He
was even rumoured to have dealt with that High-Priest Not To Be
Described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all
alone in a prehistoric stone monastery. That such a person might well
have had nibbling traffick with such beings as may conceivably dwell in
the cold waste was not to be doubted, but Carter soon found that it was
no use questioning him.

Then the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt wale and
the tall lighthouse, silent and alien, and with a strange stench that
the south wind drove into the town. Uneasiness rustled through the
taverns along that waterfront, and after a while the dark wide-mouthed
merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped steathily ashore to
seek the bazaars of the jewellers. Carter observed them closely, and
disliked them more the longer he looked at them. Then he saw them drive
the stout black men of Parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into
that singular galley, and wondered in what lands - or if in any lands at
all - those fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serve.

And on the third evening of that galley's stay one of the uncomfortable
merchants spoke to him, smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had
heard in the taverns of Carter's quest. He appeared to have knowledge
too secret for public telling; and although the sound of his voice was
unbearably hateful, Carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller must
not be overlooked. He bade him therefore be his guest in locked chambers
above, and drew out the last of the Zoogs' moon-wine to loosen his
tongue. The strange merchant drank heavily, but smirked unchanged by the
draught. Then he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his own, and
Carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby, grotesquely
carved in patterns too fabulous to be comprehended. He offered his wine
to his host, and though Carter took only the least sip, he felt the
dizziness of space and the fever of unimagined jungles. All the while
the guest had been smiling more and more broadly, and as Carter slipped
into blankness the last thing he saw was that dark odious face convulsed
with evil laughter and something quite unspeakable where one of the two
frontal puffs of that orange turban had become disarranged with the
shakings of that epileptic mirth.

Carter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a tent-like
awning on the deck of a ship, with the marvellous coasts of the Southern
Sea flying by in unnatural swiftness. He was not chained, but three of
the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby, and the sight of
those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench
that filtered up through the sinister hatches. He saw slip past him the
glorious lands and cities of which a fellow-dreamer of earth - a
lighthouse-keeper in ancient Kingsport - had often discoursed in the old
days, and recognized the templed terraces of Zak, abode of forgotten
dreams; the spires of infamous Thalarion, that daemon-city of a thousand
wonders where the eidolon Lathi reigns; the charnel gardens of Zura,
land of pleasures unattained, and the twin headlands of crystal, meeting
above in a resplendent arch, which guard the harbour of Sona-Nyl,
blessed land of fancy.

Past all these gorgeous lands the malodourous ship flew unwholesomely,
urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below. And before
the day was done Carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal
than the Basalt Pillars of the West, beyond which simple folk say
splendid Cathuria lies, but which wise dreamers well know are the gates
of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earth's dreamland drop
wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward
other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered
universe where the daemon sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid
pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the Other Gods, blind,
voiceless, tenebrous, and mindless, with their soul and messenger
Nyarlathotep.

Meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their
intent, though Carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who
wished to hold him from his quest. It is understood in the land of dream
that the Other Gods have many agents moving among men; and all these
agents, whether wholly human or slightly less than human, are eager to
work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the
favour of their hideous soul and messenger, the crawling chaos
Nyarlathotep. So Carter inferred that the merchants of the humped
turbans, hearing of his daring search for the Great Ones in their castle
of Kadath, had decided to take him away and deliver him to Nyarlathotep
for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a prize. What
might be the land of those merchants in our known universe or in the
eldritch spaces outside, Carter could not guess; nor could he imagine at
what hellish trysting-place they would meet the crawling chaos to give
him up and claim their reward. He knew, however, that no beings as
nearly human as these would dare approach the ultimate nighted throne of
the daemon Azathoth in the formless central void.

At the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and
glared hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some hidden
and offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates. Then they squatted
close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat that was
passed around. But when they gave Carter a portion, he found something
very terrible in the size and shape of it; so that he turned even paler
than before and cast that portion into the sea when no eye was on him.
And again he thought of those unseen rowers beneath, and of the
suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength was
derived.

It was dark when the galley passed betwixt the Basalt Pillars of the
West and the sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from
ahead. And the spray of that cataract rose to obscure the stars, and the
deck grew damp, and the vessel reeled in the surging current of the
brink. Then with a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken, and
Carter felt the terrors of nightmare as earth fell away and the great
boat shot silent and comet-like into planetary space. Never before had
he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder all
through the aether, leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass,
and sometimes feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object
excites their curiosity. These are the nameless larvae of the Other
Gods, and like them are blind and without mind, and possessed of
singular hungers and thirsts.

But that offensive galley did not aim as far as Carter had feared, for
he soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the
moon. The moon was a crescent shining larger and larger as they
approached it, and shewing its singular craters and peaks uncomfortably.
The ship made for the edge, and it soon became clear that its
destination was that secret and mysterious side which is always turned
away from earth, and which no fully human person, save perhaps the
dreamer Snireth-Ko, has ever beheld. The close aspect of the moon as the
galley drew near proved very disturbing to Carter, and he did not like
the size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and there. The dead
temples on the mountains were so placed that they could have glorified
no suitable or wholesome gods, and in the symmetries of the broken
columns there seemed to be some dark and inner meaning which did not
invite solution. And what the structure and proportions of the olden
worshippers could have been, Carter steadily refused to conjecture.

When the ship rounded the edge, and sailed over those lands unseen by
man, there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life, and
Carter saw many low, broad, round cottages in fields of grotesque
whitish fungi. He noticed that these cottages had no windows, and
thought that their shape suggested the huts of Esquimaux. Then he
glimpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea, and knew that the voyage was
once more to be by water - or at least through some liquid. The galley
struck the surface with a peculiar sound, and the odd elastic way the
waves received it was very perplexing to Carter.

They now slid along at great speed, once passing and hailing another
galley of kindred form, but generally seeing nothing but that curious
sea and a sky that was black and star-strewn even though the sun shone
scorchingly in it.

There presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast,
and Carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city. The way they
leaned and bent, the manner in which they were clustered, and the fact
that they had no windows at all, was very disturbing to the prisoner;
and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious
wine of that merchant with the humped turban. As the coast drew nearer,
and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger, he saw upon the
jagged hills many forests, some of whose trees he recognized as akin to
that solitary moon-tree in the enchanted wood of earth, from whose sap
the small brown Zoogs ferment their curious wine.

Carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves
ahead, and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest
them. For they were not men at all, or even approximately men, but great
greyish-white slippery things which could expand and contract at will,
and whose principal shape - though it often changed - was that of a sort
of toad without any eyes, but with a curious vibrating mass of short
pink tentacles on the end of its blunt, vague snout. These objects were
waddling busily about the wharves, moving bales and crates and boxes
with preternatural strength, and now and then hopping on or off some
anchored galley with long oars in their forepaws. And now and then one
would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves, which indeed were
approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who
traded in Dylath-Leen; only these herds, being without turbans or shoes
or clothing, did not seem so very human after all. Some of the slaves -
the fatter ones, whom a sort of overseer would pinch experimentally -
were unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which workers pushed into
the low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering vans.

Once a van was hitched and driven off, and the, fabulous thing which
drew it was such that Carter gasped, even after having seen the other
monstrosities of that hateful place. Now and then a small herd of slaves
dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a
galley, followed by a great crew of the slippery toad-things as
officers, navigators, and rowers. And Carter saw that the almost-human
creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude
which required no strength, such as steering and cooking, fetching and
carrying, and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where
they traded. These creatures must have been convenient on earth, for
they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and
turbaned, and could haggle in the shops of men without embarrassment or
curious explanations. But most of them, unless lean or ill-favoured,
were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries
by fabulous things. Occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated;
some very like these semi-humans, some not so similar, and some not
similar at all. And he wondered if any of the poor stout black men of
Parg were left to be unloaded and crated and shipped inland in those
obnoxious drays.

When the galley landed at a greasy-looking quay of spongy rock a
nightmare horde of toad-things wiggled out of the hatches, and two of
them seized Carter and dragged him ashore. The smell and aspect of that
city are beyond telling, and Carter held only scattered images of the
tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical
walls without windows. At length he was dragged within a low doorway and
made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness. It was, apparently, all
one to the toad-things whether it were light or dark. The odour of the
place was intolerable, and when Carter was locked into a chamber and
left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its
form and dimensions. It was circular, and about twenty feet across.

From then on time ceased to exist. At intervals food was pushed in, but
Carter would not touch it. What his fate would be, he did not know; but
he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and
messenger of infinity's Other Gods, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.
Finally, after an unguessed span of hours or days, the great stone door
swung wide again, and Carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the
red-litten streets of that fearsome city. It was night on the moon, and
all through the town were stationed slaves bearing torches.

In a detestable square a sort of procession was formed; ten of the
toad-things and twenty-four almost human torch-bearers, eleven on either
side, and one each before and behind. Carter was placed in the middle of
the line; five toad-things ahead and five behind, and one almost-human
torch-bearer on either side of him. Certain of the toad-things produced
disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made loathsome sounds. To that
hellish piping the column advanced out of the tiled streets and into
nighted plains of obscene fungi, soon commencing to climb one of the
lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the city. That on some
frightful slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling chaos waited, Carter
could not doubt; and he wished that the suspense might soon be over. The
whining of those impious flutes was shocking, and he would have given
worlds for some even half-normal sound; but these toad-things had no
voices, and the slaves did not talk.

Then through that star-specked darkness there did come a normal sound.
It rolled from the higher hills, and from all the jagged peaks around it
was caught up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus. It was the
midnight yell of the cat, and Carter knew at last that the old village
folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical realms
which are known only to cats, and to which the elders among cats repair
by stealth nocturnally, springing from high housetops. Verily, it is to
the moon's dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the hills and
converse with ancient shadows, and here amidst that column of foetid
things Carter heard their homely, friendly cry, and thought of the steep
roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of home.

Now much of the speech of cats was known to Randolph Carter, and in this
far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable. But that he
need not have done, for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax
and draw nearer, and saw swift shadows against the stars as small
graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions. The call
of the clan had been given, and before the foul procession had time even
to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous
claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it. The flutes stopped, and
there were shrieks in the night. Dying almost-humans screamed, and cats
spit and yowled and roared, but the toad-things made never a sound as
their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the
obscene fungi.

It was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted, and Carter had never
before seen so many cats. Black, grey, and white; yellow, tiger, and
mixed; common, Persian, and Marix; Thibetan, Angora, and Egyptian; all
were there in the fury of battle, and there hovered over them some trace
of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great
in the temples of Bubastis. They would leap seven strong at the throat
of an almost-human or the pink tentacled snout of a toad-thing and drag
it down savagely to the fungous plain, where myriads of their fellows
would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a
divine battle-fury. Carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave, but
was soon overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders. Then he
lay in the utter blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of
the victors, and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to
and fro over him in the fray.

At last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes, and when he opened them
again it was upon a strange scene. The great shining disc of the earth,
thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it, had risen
with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape; and across all
those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one
endless sea of cats in orderly array. Circle on circle they reached, and
two or three leaders out of the ranks were licking his face and purring
to him consolingly. Of the dead slaves and toad-things there were not
many signs, but Carter thought he saw one bone a little way off in the
open space between him and the warriors.

Carter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats, and
learned that his ancient friendship with the species was well known and
often spoken of in the places where cats congregate. He had not been
unmarked in Ulthar when he passed through, and the sleek old cats had
remembered how he patted them after they had attended to the hungry
Zoogs who looked evilly at a small black kitten. And they recalled, too,
how he had welcomed the very little kitten who came to see him at the
inn, and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the morning
before he left. The grandfather of that very little kitten was the
leader of the army now assembled, for he had seen the evil procession
from a far hill and recognized the prisoner as a sworn friend of his
kind on earth and in the land of dream.

A yowl now came from the farther peak, and the old leader paused
abruptly in his conversation. It was one of the army's outposts,
stationed on the highest of the mountains to watch the one foe which
Earth's cats fear; the very large and peculiar cats from Saturn, who for
some reason have not been oblivious of the charm of our moon's dark
side. They are leagued by treaty with the evil toad-things, and are
notoriously hostile to our earthly cats; so that at this juncture a
meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter.

After a brief consultation of generals, the cats rose and assumed a
closer formation, crowding protectingly around Carter and preparing to
take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and
its dreamland. The old field-marshal advised Carter to let himself be
borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers,
and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when
the rest landed. He also offered to deposit him in any spot he desired,
and Carter decided on the city of Dylath-Leen whence the black galley
had set out; for he wished to sail thence for Oriab and the carven crest
Ngranek, and also to warn the people of the city to have no more
traffick with black galleys, if indeed that traffick could be tactfully
and judiciously broken off. Then, upon a signal, the cats all leaped
gracefully with their friend packed securely in their midst; while in a
black cave on an unhallowed summit of the moon-mountains still vainly
waited the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.

The leap of the cats through space was very swift; and being surrounded
by his companions Carter did not see this time the great black
shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss. Before he
fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at the
inn at Dylath-Leen, and the stealthy, friendly cats were pouring out of
the window in streams. The old leader from Ulthar was the last to leave,
and as Carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by
cockcrow. When dawn came, Carter went downstairs and learned that a week
had elapsed since his capture and leaving. There was still nearly a
fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward Oriab, and during that time
he said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways.
Most of the townsfolk believed him; yet so fond were the jewellers of
great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with
the wide-mouthed merchants. If aught of evil ever befalls Dylath-Leen
through such traffick, it will not be his fault.

In about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black wale and tall
lighthouse, and Carter was glad to see that she was a barque of
wholesome men, with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey
captain in silken robes. Her cargo was the fragrant resin of Oriab's
inner groves, and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of Baharna,
and the strange little figures carved from Ngranek's ancient lava. For
this they were paid in the wool of Ulthar and the iridescent textiles of
Hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in Parg.
Carter made arrangements with the captain to go to Baharna and was told
that the voyage would take ten days. And during his week of waiting he
talked much with that captain of Ngranek, and was told that very few had
seen the carven face thereon; but that most travellers are content to
learn its legends from old people and lava-gatherers and image-makers in
Baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed
beheld it. The captain was not even sure that any person now living had
beheld that carven face, for the wrong side of Ngranek is very difficult
and barren and sinister, and there are rumours of caves near the peak
wherein dwell the night-gaunts. But the captain did not wish to say just
what a night-gaunt might be like, since such cattle are known to haunt
most persistently the dreams of those who think too often of them. Then
Carter asked that captain about unknown Kadath in the cold waste, and
the marvellous sunset city, but of these the good man could truly tell
nothing.

Carter sailed out of Dylath-Leen one early morning when the tide turned,
and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that
dismal basalt town. And for two days they sailed eastward in sight of
green coasts, and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed up
steeply with their red roofs and chimney-pots from old dreaming wharves
and beaches where nets lay drying. But on the third day they turned
sharply south where the roll of water was stronger, and soon passed from
sight of any land. On the fifth day the sailors were nervous, but the
captain apologized for their fears, saying that the ship was about to
pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a sunken city too old
for memory, and that when the water was clear one could see so many
moving shadows in that deep place that simple folk disliked it. He
admitted, moreover, that many ships had been lost in that part of the
sea; having been hailed when quite close to it, but never seen again.

That night the moon was very bright, and one could see a great way down
in the water. There was so little wind that the ship could not move
much, and the ocean was very calm. Looking over the rail Carter saw many
fathoms deep the dome of the great temple, and in front of it an avenue
of unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square. Dolphins
sported merrily in and out of the ruins, and porpoises revelled clumsily
here and there, sometimes coming to the surface and leaping clear out of
the sea. As the ship drifted on a little the floor of the ocean rose in
hills, and one could clearly mark the lines of ancient climbing streets
and the washed-down walls of myriad little houses.

Then the suburbs appeared, and finally a great lone building on a hill,
of simpler architecture than the other structures, and in much better
repair. It was dark and low and covered four sides of a square, with a
tower at each corner, a paved court in the centre, and small curious
round windows all over it. Probably it was of basalt, though weeds
draped the greater part; and such was its lonely and impressive place on
that far hill that it may have been a temple or a monastery. Some
phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of
shining, and Carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears. Then
by the watery moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the middle of
that central court, and saw that something was tied to it. And when
after getting a telescope from the captain's cabin he saw that that
bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes of Oriab, head downward and
without any eyes, he was glad that a rising breeze soon took the ship
ahead to more healthy parts of the sea.

The next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for Zar, in
the land of forgotten dreams, with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for
cargo. And on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the
isle of Oriab with Ngranek rising jagged and snow-crowned in the
distance. Oriab is a very great isle, and its port of Baharna a mighty
city. The wharves of Baharna are of porphyry, and the city rises in
great stone terraces behind them, having streets of steps that are
frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings.
There is a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with
granite gates and leads to the inland lake of Yath, on whose farther
shore are the vast clay-brick ruins of a primal city whose name is not
remembered. As the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin
beacons Thon and Thal gleamed a welcome, and in all the million windows
of Baharna's terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as
the stars peep out overhead in the dusk, till that steep and climbing
seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the stars of
heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbour.

The captain, after landing, made Carter a guest in his own small house
on the shores of Yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it; and
his wife and servants brought strange toothsome foods for the
traveller's delight. And in the days after that Carter asked for rumours
and legends of Ngranek in all the taverns and public places where
lava-gatherers and image-makers meet, but could find no one who had been
up the higher slopes or seen the carven face. Ngranek was a hard
mountain with only an accursed valley behind it, and besides, one could
never depend on the certainty that night-gaunts are altogether fabulous.
