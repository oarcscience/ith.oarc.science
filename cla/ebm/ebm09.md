Hercules Drunk.

##### ORPHIC HYMNS.

<span class="small">I shall utter to whom it is lawful; but let the
doors be closed,  
Nevertheless, against all the profane. But do thou hear,  
Oh Musæus, for I will declare what is true. . . .</span>

<span class="small">He is the One, self-proceeding; and from him all
things proceed,  
And in them he himself exerts his activity; no mortal  
Beholds Him, but he beholds all.</span>

<span class="small">There is one royal body in which all things are
enwombed,  
Fire and Water, Earth, Æther, Night and Day,  
And Counsel \[*Metis*\], the first producer, and delightful Love,—  
For all these are contained in the great body of Zeus.</span>

<span class="small">Zeus, the mighty thunderer, is first; Zeus is
last;  
Zeus is the head, Zeus the middle of all things;  
From Zeus were all things produced. He is male, he is female;  
Zeus is the depth of the earth, the height of the starry heavens;</span>

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="small">He is the breath of all things, the force of untamed
fire;  
The bottom of the sea; Sun, Moon, and Stars;  
Origin of all; King of all; One Power, one God, one Great Ruler.</span>
