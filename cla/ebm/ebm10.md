##### HYMN OF CLEANTHES.

<span class="small">Greatest of the gods, God with many names, God
ever-ruling, and ruling all things!  
Zeus, origin of Nature, governing the universe by law,  
All hail! For it is right for mortals to address thee;  
For we are thy offspring, and we alone of all  
That live and creep on earth have the power of imitative speech.  
Therefore will I praise thee, and hymn forever thy power.  
Thee the wide heaven, which surrounds the earth, obeys:  
Following where thou wilt, willingly obeying thy law.  
Thou holdest at thy service, in thy mighty hands,  
The two-edged, flaming, immortal thunderbolt,  
Before whose flash all nature trembles.  
Thou rulest in the common reason, which goes through all,  
And appears mingled in all things, great or small,  
Which filling all nature, is king of all existences.  
Nor without thee, Oh Deity, <span id="fr_135"></span>[\*](#fn_135) does
anything happen in the world,  
From the divine ethereal pole to the great ocean,  
Except only the evil preferred by the senseless wicked.  
But thou also art able to bring to order that which is chaotic,  
Giving form to what is formless, and making the discordant friendly;  
So reducing all variety to unity, and even making good out of evil.  
Thus throughout nature is one great law  
Which only the wicked seek to disobey,  
Poor fools! who long for happiness,  
But will not see nor hear the divine commands.</span>

<span class="small">\[In frenzy blind they stray away from good,  
By thirst of glory tempted, or sordid avarice,  
Or pleasures sensual and joys that fall.\]  
But do thou, Oh Zeus, all-bestower, cloud-compeller!  
Ruler of thunder! guard men from sad error.  
Father! dispel the clouds of the soul, and let us follow  
The laws of thy great and just reign!  
That we may be honored, let us honor thee again,  
Chanting thy great deeds, as is proper for mortals,  
For nothing can be better for gods or men  
Than to adore with hymns the Universal King. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_135"></span>[239:\*](ebm10.htm#fr_135) Greek, Δαιμον,
*Demon*,

<span id="fn_136"></span>[240:\*](ebm10.htm#fr_136) Rev. J. Freeman
Clarke, whose version is here copied, renders this phrase “the law
common to all.” The Greek text reads: “ἡ κοινον αει νομον εν δικῃ
ὑμνειν,”—the term νομος, *nomos*, or Law, being used for King, as Love
is for God.—A. W.
