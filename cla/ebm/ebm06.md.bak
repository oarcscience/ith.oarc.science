### ❦ SECTION II. ❦

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Dionysiacal sacred rites instituted
by Orpheus, <span id="fr_105"></span>[\*](#fn_105.md) depended on the
following arcane narration, part of which has been already related in
the preceding section, and the rest may be found in a variety of
authors. “Dionysus, or Bacchus \[Zagreus\], while he was yet a boy, was
engaged by the Titans, through the stratagems of Juno, in a variety of
sports, with which that period of

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

life is so vehemently allured; and among the rest, he was particularly
captivated with beholding his image in a mirror; during his admiration
of which, he was miserably torn in pieces by the Titans; who, not
content with this cruelty, first boiled his members in water, and
afterwards roasted them by the fire. But while they were tasting his
flesh thus dressed, Jupiter, roused by the odor, and perceiving the
cruelty of the deed, hurled his thunder at the Titans; but committed the
members of Bacchus to Apollo, his brother, that they might be properly
interred. And this being performed, Dionysus (whose heart during his
laceration was snatched away by Pallas and preserved), by a new
regeneration again emerged, and being restored to his pristine life and
integrity,

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

he afterwards filled up the number of the gods. But in the mean time,
from the exhalations arising from the ashes of the burning bodies of the
Titans, mankind were produced.” Now, in order to understand properly the
secret of this narration, it is necessary to repeat the observation
already made in the preceding chapter, “that all fables belonging to
mystic ceremonies are of the mixed kind”: and consequently the present
fable, as well as that of Proserpina, must in one part have reference to
the gods, and in the other to the human soul, as the following
exposition will abundantly evince:

In the first place, then, by Dionysus, or Bacchus, according to the
highest conception of this deity, we understand the spiritual part of
the mundane soul; for there are various processions or avatars of this
god, or Bacchuses, derived from his essence. But by the Titans we must
understand the mundane gods, of whom Bacchus is the highest; by Jupiter,
the Demiurgus, <span id="fr_106"></span>[\*](#fn_106.md) or artificer of

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

the universe; by Apollo, the deity of the Sun, who has both a mundane
and super-mundane establishment, and by whom the universe is bound in
symmetry and consent, through splendid reasons and harmonizing power;
and, lastly, by Minerva we must understand that original, intellectual,
ruling, and providential deity, who guards and preserves all middle
lives <span id="fr_107"></span>[\*](#fn_107.md) in an immutable condition,
through intelligence and a self-supporting life, and by this means
sustains them from the depredations and inroads of matter. Again, by the
infancy of Bacchus at the period of his laceration, the condition of the
intellectual nature is implied; since, according to the Orphic theology,
souls, under the government of Saturn, or Kronos, who is pure intellect
or spirituality, instead of proceeding, as now, from youth to age,
advance in a retrograde progression from age to youth. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[†](#fn_108.md) The arts employed by

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

the Titans, in order to ensnare Dionysius, are symbolical of those
apparent and divisible energies of the mundane gods, through which the
participated intellect of Bacchus becomes, as it were, torn in pieces;
and by the mirror we must understand, in the language of Proclus, the
inaptitude of the universe to receive the plenitude of intellectual
perfection; but the symbolical meaning of his laceration, through the
stratagems of Juno, and the consequent punishment of the Titans, is thus
beautifully unfolded by Olympiodorus, in his MS. Commentary on the
*Phædo* of Plato: “The form,” says he, “of that which is universal is
plucked off, torn in pieces, and scattered into generation; and Dionysus
is the *monad* of the Titans. But his laceration is said to take place
through the stratagems of Juno,

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

because this goddess is the supervising guardian of motion and
progression; <span id="fr_109"></span>[\*](#fn_109.md) and on this account,
in the *Iliad*, she perpetually rouses and excites Jupiter to
providential action about secondary concerns; and, in another respect,
Dionysus is the *ephorus* or supervising guardian of generation, because
he presides over life and death; for he is the guardian or *ephorus* of
life because of generation, and also of death because wine produces an
enthusiastic condition. We become more enthusiastic at the period of
dying, as Proclus indicates in the example of Homer who became prophetic
\[μαντικος\] at the time of his death. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[†](#fn_110.md) They likewise assert, that tragedy and
comedy are assigned to Dionysus: comedy being the play or ludicrous
representation of life; and tragedy having relation to the

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

*passions* and *death*. The comic writers, therefore, do not rightly
call in question the tragedians as not rightly representing Bacchus,
saying that such things did not happen to Bacchus. But Jupiter is said
to have hurled his thunder at the Titans; the thunder signifying a
conversion or changing: for fire naturally ascends; and hence Jupiter,
by this means, converts the Titans to his own essence.” Σπαραττεται δε
το καϑολου ειδος εν τῃ γενεσει, μονας δε Τιτανων ὁ Διονυσος.───Κατ’
επιβουλην δε της Ἡρας διοτι κινησεως εφορος ἡ ϑεος και προοδου. Διο και
συνεχως εν τῃ Ιλιασι εξανιστησιν αυτη, και διεγορει τον δια εις προνοιαν
των δευτερων. Και γενεσεως αλλως εφορος εστιν ὁ Διονυσος, διοτι και ζωης
και τελευτης. Ζωης μεν γαρ εφορος, επειδη και της γενεσεως, τελευτης δε
διοτι ενϑουσιαν ὁ οινος ποιει. Και περι την τελευτην δε
ενϑουσιαστικωτεροι γινομεϑα, ὡς

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

δηλοι ὁ παῤ Ὁμηρῳ Προκλος, μαντικος γεγονως περι την τελευτην· και την
τραγωδιαν, και την κωμωδιαν ανεισϑαι φασι τῳ Διονυσῳ. Την μεν κωμωδιαν
παιγνιον ουσαν του βιον· την δε τραγωδιαν δια τα παϑη, και την τελευτην.
Ουκ ἁρα καλως οἱ κωμικοι τοις τραγικοις εγκαλουσιν, ὡς μη Διονυσιακοις
ουσιν, λεγον τες οτι ουδεν ταυτα προς τον Διονυσον. Κεραυνοι δε τουτοις
ὁ Ζευς, του κεραυνου δηλουντος την επιστροφεν· πυργαρ επι τα ανω
κινουμενα· επιστρεφει ουν αυτους προς εαυτον. But by the members of
Dionysus being first boiled in water by the Titans, and afterward
roasted by the fire, the outgoing or distribution of intellect into
matter, and its subsequent returning from thence, is evidently implied:
for water was considered by the Egyptians, as we have already observed,
as the symbol of matter; and fire is the natural symbol of ascending.
The heart of Dionysus too, is, with the greatest propriety, said to be
preserved by Minerva; for this goddess is the guardian of life, of which
the heart is a symbol. So that this part of the fable plainly signifies,
that while intellectual or spiritual

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

life is distributed into the universe, its principle is preserved entire
by the guardian power and providence of the Divine intelligence. And as
Apollo is the source of all union and harmony, and as he is called by
Proclus, “the key-keeper of the fountain of life,” <span
id="fr_111"></span>[\*](#fn_111.md) the reason is obvious why the members
of Dionysus, which were buried by this deity, again emerged by a new
generation, and were restored to their pristine integrity and life. But
let it here be carefully observed, that renovation, when applied to the
gods, is to be considered as secretly implying the rising of their
proper light, and its consequent appearance to subordinate natures. And
that punishment, when considered as taking place about beings of a
nature superior to mankind, signifies nothing more than a secondary
providence over such beings which is of a punishing character, and which
subsists about souls that deteriorate. Hence, then, from what has been
said, we may easily collect the ultimate design of the first part of
this mystic fable; for it appears to be

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

no other than to represent the manner in which the form of the mundane
intellect is divided through the universe;—that such an intellect (and
every one which is total) remains entire during its division into parts,
and that the divided parts themselves are continually turned again to
their source, with which they become finally united. So that
illumination from the higher reason, while it proceeds into the dark and
rebounding receptacle of matter, and invests its obscurity with the
supervening ornaments of divine light, returns at the same time without
interruption to the source or principle of its descent.

Let us now consider the latter part of the fable, in which it is said
that our souls were formed from the vapors emanating from the ashes of
the burning bodies of the Titans; at the same time connecting it with
the former part of the fable, which is also applicable in a certain
degree to the condition of a partial intellect <span
id="fr_112"></span>[\*](#fn_112.md) like ours. In the first

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

Etruscan Eleusinians.

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

place, then, we are made up from *fragments* (says Olympiodorus),
because, through falling into generation, our life has proceeded into
the most distant and extreme division; and from *Titanic fragments*,
because the Titans are the ultimate artificers of things, <span
id="fr_113"></span>[\*](#fn_113.md) and stand immediately next to whatever
is constituted from them. But further, our irrational life is Titanic,
by which the rational and higher life is torn in pieces. Hence, when we
disperse the Dionysus, or intuitive intellect contained in the secret
recesses of our nature, breaking in pieces the kindred and divine form
of our essence, and which communicates, as it were, both with things
subordinate and supreme, then we become Titans (or apostates); but when
we establish ourselves in union with this Dionysiacal or kindred form,
then we become Bacchuses, or perfect guardians and keepers of our
irrational life: for Dionysus, whom in this respect we resemble, is
himself an *ephorus* or

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

guardian deity, dissolving at his pleasure the bonds by which the soul
is united to the body, since he is the cause of a parted life. But it is
necessary that the passive or feminine nature of our irrational part,
through which we are bound in body, and which is nothing more than the
resounding echo, as it were, of soul, should suffer the punishment
incurred by descent; for when the soul casts aside the \[divine\]
peculiarity of her nature, she requires her own, but at the same time a
multiform body, that she may again become in need of a common form,
which she has lost through Titanic dispersion into matter.

But in order to see the perfect resemblance between the manner in which
our souls descend and the dividing of the intuitive intellect by mundane
natures, let the reader attend to the following admirable citation from
the manuscript Commentary of Olympiodorus on the *Phædo* of Plato: “It
is necessary, first of all, for the soul to place a likeness of herself
in the body. This is to ensoul the body. Secondly, it is necessary

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

for her to sympathize with the image, as being of like idea. For every
external form or substance is wrought into an identity with its interior
substance, through an ingenerated tendency thereto. In the third place,
being situated in a divided nature, it is necessary that she should be
torn in pieces, and fall into a last separation, till, through the
action of a life of purification, she shall raise herself from the
dispersion, loose the bond of sympathy, and act as of herself without
the external image, having become established according to the
first-created life. The like things are fabled in the example. For
Dionysus or Bacchus because his image was formed in a mirror, pursued
it, and thus became distributed into everything. But Apollo collected
him and brought him up; being a deity of purification, and the true
savior of Dionysus; and on this account he is styled in the sacred
hymns, Dionusites.” Ὁτι δει πρωτον ὑποστησαι εκονα την ψυχην εαυτου εν
τῳ σωματι. Τουτο γαρ εστι ψυχωσαι το σωμα. Δευτερον δε συμπαϑειν τῳ
ειδωλῳ, κατα την ὁμοειδειαν. Παν γαρ ειδος επειγεται

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

εις την προς εαυτο ταυτοητα δια την προς εαυτο συνευσιν εμφυτον. Τριτον
εν τῳ μερισμῳ γενομενην συνδιαπασϑηναι αυτῳ, και εις τον εσχατον
εκπεσειν μερισμον. Ἑως αν δαι της καϑαρτιηκης ζωης συναγειραι μεν ἑαυτην
απο του σκορπισμου, λυση δε τον δεσμον της συμηπαϑειας, προβαλλεται δε
την ανευ του ειδωλου, καϑ’ εαυτην ἑστωσαν πρωτουργον ζωην. Ὁτι τα ὁμοια
μυϑευεται, και εν τῳ παραδειγματι. Ὁ γαρ Διονυσος, ὁτι το ειδωλον
ενεϑηκε τω εσοπτρω τουτῳ εφεσπετο. Και ὁυτως εις το παν εμερισϑη. Ὁ δε
Απολλων συναγειρει τε αυτον και αναγει, καϑαρτικος ων ϑεος, και του
Διονυσου σωτηρ ως αλῳϑως. Και δια τουτο Διονυσοτης ανυμειται. Hence, as
the same author beautifully observes, the soul revolves according to a
mystic and mundane revolution: for flying from an indivisible and
Dionysiacal life, and operating according to a Titanic and revolting
energy, she becomes bound in the body as in a prison. Hence, too, she
abides in punishment and takes care of her partial and secondary
concerns; and being purified from Titanic defilements, and collected
into one, she becomes

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

a Bacchus; that is, she passes into the proper integrity of her nature
according to the divine principle ruling on high. From all which it
evidently follows, that he who lives Dionysiacally rests from labors and
is freed from his bonds; <span id="fr_114"></span>[\*](#fn_114.md) that he
leaves his prison, or rather his apostatizing life; and that he who does
this is a philosopher purifying himself from the contaminations of his
earthly life. But farther from this account of Dionysus, we may perceive
the truth of Plato’s observation, “that the design of the Mysteries is
to lead us back to the perfection from which, as our beginning, we first
made our descent.” For in this perfection Dionysus himself subsists,
establishing perfect souls in the throne of his father; that is, in the
integrity of a life according to Jupiter. So that he who is perfect
necessarily resides with the gods, according to the design of those
deities, who are the sources of consummate perfection to the soul. And
lastly,

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

the Thyrsus itself, which was used in the Bacchic procession, as it was
a reed full of knots, is an apt symbol of the diffusion of the higher
nature into the sensible world. And agreeable to this, Olympiodorus on
the *Phædo* observes, “that the Thyrsus <span
id="fr_115"></span>[\*](#fn_115.md) is a symbol of a forming anew of the
material and parted substance from its scattered condition; and that on
this account it is a Titanic plant. This it was customary to extend
before Bacchus instead of his paternal scepter; and through this they
called him down into our partial nature. Indeed, the Titans are
Thyrsus-bearers; and Prometheus concealed fire in a Thyrus or reed;
after which he is considered as bringing celestial light into
generation, or leading the soul into the body, or calling forth the
divine illumination, the whole being ungenerated, into generated
existence. Hence Socrates calls the multitude Thyrsus-bearers
Orphically, as living according to a Titanic life.” Ὁτι ὁ ναρϑηξ
συμβολον εστι της ενυλου δημιουργιας, και μεριστης, δια

την μαλιστα διεσπαρμενην συνεχειαν, οϑεν και Τιτανικον το φυτον. Και γαρ
τῳ Διονυσῳ προτεινουσιν αυτῳ, αντι του πατρικου σκηπτρου. Και ταυτῃ
προκαλουνται αυτον εις τον μερικον. Και μεντοι, και ναρϑηκοφορουσιν οἱ
Τιτανες, και ὁ Προμηϑευς, εν ναρϑηκϊ κλεπτι το πυρ, ειτε το ουρανιον φως
εις την γενεσιν κατασπων, ειτε την ψυχην εις το σωμα προαγων, ειτε την

δε τουτο, και ὁ Σωκρατης τους πολλους καλει ναρϑηκοφορους Ορφικως, ὡς
ζωντας Τιτανικως.

And thus much for the secret meaning of the fable, which formed a
principal part of these mystic rites. Let us now proceed to consider the
signification of the symbols, which, according to Clemens Alexandrinus,
belonged to the Bacchic ceremonies; and which are comprehended in the
following Orphic verses:

> <span class="small">Κωνος, και ρομβος, και παιγνια καμπεσιγυια  
> Μηλα τε χρυσεα καλα παῤ ἑσπεριδων λιγυφωνων.</span>

That is,

> <span class="small">A wheel, a pine-nut, and the wanton plays,  
> Which move and bend the limbs in various ways:</span>

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

> <span class="small">With these th’ Hesperian golden-fruit combine,  
> Which beauteous nymphs defend of voice divine.</span>

To all which Clemens adds εσοπτρον, *esoptron, a mirror,* ποκος, *pokos,
a fleece of wool,* and αστραγαλος*, astragalos, the ankle-bone*. In the
first place, then, with respect to the wheel, since Dionysus, as we have
already explained, is the mundane intellect, and intellect is of an
elevating and convertive nature, nothing can be a more apt symbol of
intellectual action than a wheel or sphere: besides, as the laceration
and dismemberment of Dionysus signifies the going-forth of intellectual
illumination into matter, and its returning at the same time to its
source, this too will be aptly symbolized by a wheel. In the second
place, a *pine-nut, from its conical shape*, is a perspicuous symbol of
the manner in which intellectual or spiritual illumination proceeds from
its source and beginning into a material nature. “For the soul,” says
Macrobius, <span id="fr_116"></span>[\*](#fn_116.md) “proceeding from a
round figure, which is the only divine form, is extended into the form
of a cone in going forth.”

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And the same is
true symbolically of the higher intellect. And as to the wanton sports
which bend the limbs, this evidently alludes to the Titanic arts, by
which Dionysus was allured, and occultly signifies the faculties of the
mundane intellect, considered as subsisting according to an apparent and
divisible condition. But the Hesperian golden-apples signify the pure
and incorruptible nature of that intellect or Dionysus, which is
possessed by the world; for a golden-apple, according to Sallust, is a
symbol of the world; and this doubtless, both on account of its external
figure, and the incorruptible intellect which it contains, and with the
illuminations of which it is externally adorned; since gold, on account
of never being subject to rust, aptly denotes an incorruptible and
immaterial nature. The mirror, which is the next symbol, we have already
explained. And as to the fleece of wool, this is a symbol of laceration,
or distribution of intellect, or Dionysus, into matter; for the verb
σπαραττω, *sparatto, dilanio*, which is used in the relation of the
Bacchic discerption, signifies to tear in pieces

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

like wool: and hence Isidorus derives the Latin word *lana, wool*, from
*laniando*, as *vellus* from *vellendo*. Nor must it pass unobserved,
that λῆνος, in Greek, signifies wool, and ληνὸς, a wine-press. <span
id="fr_117"></span>[\*](#fn_117.md) And, indeed, the pressing of grapes is
as evident a symbol of dispersion as the tearing of wool; and this
circumstance was doubtless one principal reason why grapes were
consecrated to Bacchus: for a grape, previous to its pressure, aptly
represents that which is collected into one; and when it is pressed into
juice, it no less aptly represents the diffusion of that which was
before collected and entire. And lastly, the αστραγαλος, *astragalos*,
or *ankle-bone*, as it is principally subservient to the progressive
motion of animals, so it belongs, with great propriety, to the mystic
symbols of Bacchus; since it doubtless signifies the going forth of that
deity into the department of physical existence: for nature, or that
divisible life which subsists about the body,

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span> <span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

<span id="img_21201"></span> ![Hercules Reclining.](img/21201.png.md)  
Hercules Reclining.

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

and which is productive of seeds, immediately depends on Bacchus. And
hence we are informed by Proclus, that the sexual parts of this god are
denominated by theologists, *Diana*, who, says he, presides over the
whole of the generation into natural existence, leads forth into light
all natural reasons, and extends a prolific power from on high even to
the subterranean realms. <span id="fr_118"></span>[\*](#fn_118.md) And
hence we may perceive the reason why, in the Orphic *Hymn to Nature*,
that goddess is described as “*turning round silent traces with the*
ankle-bones *of her feet*.”

> <span class="small">Αψοφον αστραγαλοισι ποδων ιχνος ειλισσουσα.</span>

And it is highly worthy our observation that in this verse of the hymn
Nature is celebrated as Fortune, according to that description of the
goddess in which she is represented as standing with her feet on a wheel
which she continually turns round; as the following verse from the same
hymn abundantly confirms:

> <span class="small">Αεναῳ στροφαλιγγι ϑοον ῥυμα δινευουσα.</span>

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

The sense of which is, “moving with rapid motion on an eternal wheel.”
Nor ought it to seem wonderful that Nature should he celebrated as
Fortune; for Fortune in the Orphic hymn to that deity is invoked as
Diana: and the moon, as we have observed in the preceding section, is
the αυτοπτον αγαλμα φυσεως, *the self-revealing emblem of Nature;* and
indeed the apparent inconstancy of Fortune has an evident agreement with
the fluctuating condition in which the dominions of nature are
perpetually involved.

It only now remains that we explain the secret meaning of the sacred
dress with which the initiated in the Dionysiacal Mysteries were
invested, in order to the θρονισμος (*thronismos,* enthroning) taking
place; or sitting in a solemn manner on a throne, about which it was
customary for the other initiates to dance. But the particulars of this
habit are thus described in the Orphic verses preserved by
Macrobius: <span id="fr_119"></span>[\*](#fn_119.md)

> <span class="small">Ταυτα γε παντα τελειν ἱερᾳ σκηυῃ πυκασαντα,  
> Σωμα ϑεου πλαττειν εριαυγους ἡελιοιο.</span>

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

> <span class="small">Πρωτα μεν αργυφεαις εναλιγκιον ακτινεσσιν  
> Πεπλον φοινικερον (lege φοινικεον) πρυΐικελον αμφιβαλεσϑαι.  
> Αυταρ ὑπερϑε νεβροιο παναιολου εἱρυ καϑαψαι  
> Δερμα πολυστικτον ϑηρος κατα δεξιον ὡμον,  
> Αστρων δαιδαλεων μιμιμ’ ἱερου τε πολοιο.

That is,

> <span class="small">He who desires in pomp of sacred dress

> Should first a vail assume of purple bright,

> <span class="small">But Ocean’s circle, like a zone of light,

In the first place, then, let us consider why this mystic dress
belonging to Bacchus is to represent the sun. Now the reason of this
will be evident from the following observations: according to the Orphic
theology, the divine intellect of every planet is denominated a Bacchus,
who is characterized in each by a different appellation; so that the
intellect of the solar deity is called Trietericus Bacchus. And in the
second place, since the divinity of the sun, according to the arcana of
the ancient theology, has a super-mundane as well as mundane
establishment, and is wholly of an exalting or intellectual nature;
hence considered as super-mundane he must both produce and contain the
mundane intellect, or Dionysus, in his essence; for all the mundane are
contained in the super-mundane deities, by whom also they are produced.
Hence Proclus, in his elegant *Hymn to the Sun*, says:

> <span class="small">Σε κλυτον ὑμνειουσι Διωνυσσοιο τοκηα.</span>

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

That is, “they celebrate thee in hymns as the illustrious parent of
Dionysus.” And thirdly, it is through the subsistence of Dionysus in the
sun that that luminary derives its circular motion, as is evident from
the following Orphic verse, in which, speaking of the sun, it is said of
him, that

> <span class="small">────Διονυσος δ’ επεκληϑη,  
> Ουνεκα δινειται κατ’ απειρονα μακρον Ολυμπον.</span>

“He is called Dionysus, because he is carried with a circular motion
through the immensely-extended heavens.” And this with the greatest
propriety, since intellect, as we have already observed, is entirely of
a transforming and elevating nature: so that from all this, it is
sufficiently evident why the dress of Dionysus is represented as
belonging to the sun. In the second place, the vail, resembling a
mixture of fiery light, is an obvious image of the solar fire. And as to
the spotted mule-skin, <span id="fr_120"></span>[\*](#fn_120.md) which is
to represent the starry heavens, this is nothing more than an image of

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

the moon; this luminary, according to Proclus *on Hesiod*, resembling
the mixed nature of a mule; “becoming dark through her participation of
earth, and deriving her proper light from the sun.” Γης μεν εχουσα το
σκοτιζεσϑαι, ἡλιου δε το οικειον ειληχεναι φως. Ταυτη μεν ουν οικειωται
προς αυτην ἡ ἡμιονος. So that the spotted hide signifies the moon
attended with a multitude of stars: and hence, in the Orphic *Hymn to
the Moon*, that deity is celebrated “as shining surrounded with
beautiful stars”: καλοις αστροισι βρυουσα, and is likewise called
αστραρχη, *astrarché*, or “*queen of the stars*.”

In the next place, the golden zone is the circle of the Ocean, as the
last verses plainly evince. But, you will ask, what has the rising of
the sun through the ocean, from the boundaries of earth and night, to do
with the adventures of Bacchus? I answer, that it is inpossible to
devise a symbol more beautifully accommodated to the purpose: for, in
the first place, is not the ocean a proper emblem of an earthly nature,
whirling and

The Marriage of Mars and Venus.

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

stormy, and perpetually rolling without admitting any periods of repose?
And is not the sun emerging from its boisterous deeps a perspicuous
symbol of the higher spiritual nature, apparently rising from the dark
and fluctuating material receptacle, and conferring form and beauty on
the sensible universe through its light? I say apparently rising, for
though the spiritual nature always diffuses its splendor with invariable
energy, yet it is not always perceived by the subjects of its
illuminations: besides, as psychical natures can only receive partially
and at intervals the benefits of the divine irradiation; hence fables
regarding this temporal participation transfer, for the purpose of
concealment and in conformity to the phenomena, the imperfection of
subordinate natures to such as are supreme. This description, therefore,
of the rising sun, is a most beautiful symbol of the new birth of
Bacchus, which, as we have already observed, implies nothing more than
the rising of intellectual light, and its consequent manifestation to
subordinate orders of existence.

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

And thus much for the mysteries of Bacchus, which, as well as those of
Ceres, relate in one part to the descent of a partial intellect into
matter, and its condition while united with the dark tenement of the
body: but there appears to be this difference between the two, that in
the fable of Ceres and Proserpine the descent of the whole rational soul
is considered; and in that of Bacchus the scattering and going forth of
*that supreme part alone of our nature which we properly characterize by
the appellation of intellect.* <span id="fr_121"></span>[\*](#fn_121.md) In
the composition of each we may discern the same traces of exalted wisdom
and recondite theology; of a theology the most venerable for its
antiquity, and the most admirable for its excellence and reality.

I shall conclude this treatise by presenting the reader with a valuable
and most elegant hymn of Proclus <span id="fr_122"></span>[†](#fn_122.md)
to Minerva, which I have

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

discovered in the British Museum; and the existence of which appears to
have been hitherto utterly unknown. This hymn is to be found among the
Harleian Manuscripts, in a volume containing several of the *Orphic
hymns*, with which, through the ignorance of transcriber, it is
indiscriminately ranked, as well as the other four hymns of Proclus,
already printed in the *Bibliotheca Græca* of Fabricius. Unfortunately
too, it is transcribed in a character so obscure, and with such great
inaccuracy, that, notwithstanding the pains I have taken to restore the
text to its original purity, I have been obliged to omit two lines, and
part of a third, as beyond my abilities to read or amend; however, the
greatest, and doubtless the most important part, is fortunately
intelligible, which I now present to the reader’s inspection,
accompanied with some corrections, and an English paraphrased
translation. The original is highly elegant and pious, and contains one
mythological particular, which is no where else to be found. It has
likewise an evident connection with the preceding fable of Bacchus,

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

as will be obvious from the perusal; and on this account principally it
was inserted in the present discourse.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_105"></span>[187:\*](ebm06.htm#fr_105.md) Whether Orpheus was
an actual living person has been questioned by Aristotle; but Herodotus,
Pindar, and other writers, mention him. Although the Orphic system is
asserted to have come from Egypt, the internal evidence favors the
opinion that it was derived from India, and that its basis is the
Buddhistic philosophy. The Orphic associations of Greece were ascetic,
contrasting markedly with the frenzies, enthusiasm, and license of the
popular rites. The Thracians had numerous Hindu customs. The name Koré
is Sanscrit; and Zeus may be the Dyaus of Hindu story. His visit to the
chamber of Koré-Persephoneia (Parasu-pani) in the form of a dragon or
*naga*, and the horns or crescent on the head of the child, are Tartar
or Buddhistic. The <span id="page_188">p. 188</span> name Zagreus is
evidently *Chakra*, or ruler of the earth. The *Hera* who compassed his
death is *Aira*, the wife of Buddha; and the Titans are the Daityas, or
apostate tribes of India. The doctrine of metempsychosis is expressed by
the swallowing of the heart of the murdered child, so as to reabsorb his
soul, and bring him anew into existence as the son of Semelé. Indeed,
all the stories of Bacchus have Hindu characteristics; and his cultus is
a part of the serpent worship of the ancients. The evidence appears to
us unequivocal.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[189:\*](ebm06.htm#fr_106.md) Plotinus regarded
the Demiurgus, or creator, as the god of providence, thought, essence,

continually advancing to the spring of life, and the more thousands of
years they live, so much the more delightful and happy is the spring to
which they attain, and this to eternity with increments according to the
progresses and degrees of love, of charity, and of faith. Women who have
died old and worn out with age, yet have lived in faith on the Lord, in
charity toward their neighbor, and in happy conjugal love with a
husband, after a succession of years, come more and more into the flower
of youth and adolescence.”

conversant with those already extant of this incomparable man, since the
spirit and manner in both is perfectly the same.
