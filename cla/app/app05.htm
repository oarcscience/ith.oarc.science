<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Epimenides of Crete</span> (Phaestos or Cnossus): date uncertain, but he probably lived in the late sixth and early fifth centuries B.C.</p>  
<p>He was sometimes included in the list of the Seven Sages, in place of Periander. A number of epic poems were ascribed to him, giving an Orphic cosmogony; and a prose work on Cretan affairs, which was actually of later date, but was used by Diodorus.</p>  
<p>1. (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Paul</span>, <i>Epistle to Titus</i>, 1. 12: <i>One of the Cretans, their own prophet, said of them</i>): The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy stomachs. (<i>Clement says that Paul means Epimenides, Jerome that it came from the Oracles of Epimenides</i>).</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_10"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. (<i>From his Epic poems</i>): I too am of the race of the fair-tressed moon, who with a dread shudder shook off the wild lion; and strangling him in Nemea because of revered Hera, (<i>the divine strength of Heracles overcame him</i>).</p>

<p>5. (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Damascius</span>: <i>Epimenides gave the first elements as Air and Night, from which were created Tartarus, from which sprang two Titans; these having united produced the Egg, from which again another generation sprang</i>).</p>  
<p>6. (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pausanias</span>: <i>Epimenides also makes Styx the daughter of Ocean, and unites her not with Pallas but with an unknown Peiras, to whom she bore Echidna</i>).</p>  
<p>7. (<i>Epimenides says that the Harpies are the children of Ocean, and were slain near</i> (<i>Rhegium?</i>)).</p>  
<p>8. (<i>The story of Typho: in Epimenides&#146; version, Typho entered the palace while Zeus was asleep; and Zeus killed him with a thunderbolt</i>).</p>  
<p>9. (<i>Epimenides agrees with certain others that the Harpies guard the apples, but says that they are the same as the Hesperdes</i>).</p>  
<p>10. (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Plutarch</span>: <i>Epimenides said of Munychia that</i>) the Athenians would eat it up with their own teeth, if they foresaw what harm it would do to the city.</p>  
<p>11. (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Plutarch</span>: <i>Epimenides refuted the story that eagles or swans setting out from the ends of the earth met in the middle at Delphi, the so-called Omphalos</i>): There was no Omphalos, either in the centre of the earth or of the sea. If any there be, it is visible to the gods, not visible to mortals.</p>  
<p>12. (<i>Epimenides adds a fifth to the sons of Phrixus, Presb&ocirc;n by name</i>).</p>  
<p>13. (<i>Ai&ecirc;tes was a Corinthian, and his mother was Ephyra</i>).</p>  
<p>14. (<i>Endymion in heaven fell in love with Hera, and Zeus condemned him to eternal sleep</i>).</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>15. (<i>Laius married Eurycleia daughter of Ecphas, and Oedipus was her son</i>).</p>  
<p>16. (<i>The children of Zeus and Callist&ocirc; were Pan and Areas, twins</i>).</p>

<p>20. (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Diodorus</span>: '<i>I have followed the most trustworthy authorities on Cretan affairs, Epimenides the Theologian, Dosiades, Sosicrates and Laosthenes</i>').</p>  
<p>21. (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aratus</span>: '<i>Holy Goat, of whom the story goes that she suckled Zeus, and the priest-interpreters of Zeus call her Olenian</i>').</p>  
<p>22. (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aratus</span>: <i>The story that Cynosoura and Helic&ecirc; were placed in the heavens because they looked after Zeus in the Idaean cave, when the Dictaean Kour&ecirc;t&ecirc;s hid him from Cronos</i>).</p>  
<p>23. (<i>Cretan story that Zeus when hiding from Cronos changed himself and his nurses into a serpent and bears respectively, and after he had taken over the kingship, placed these forms in the Arctic Circle</i>).</p>  
<p>24. (<i>The story of Aigoker&ocirc;s: honoured because he was a foster-brother of Zeus, being with him in Crete when he fought the Titans. Aigoker&ocirc;s is believed to have discovered the horn, the sound of which put the Titans to flight. He and his mother the Goat were placed in the heavens by Zeus: because he found the horn in the sea, Aigoker&ocirc;s has a fish-tail</i>).</p>  
<p>25. (<i>The Crown was a gift of Dionysus to Ariadn&ecirc;; later he placed it in the heavens</i>).</p>
