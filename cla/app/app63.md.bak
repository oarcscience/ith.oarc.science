### 68. DÊMOCRITUS OF ABDÊRA

<span class="smallcaps">Dêmocritus</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Abdêra</span> was in his prime about 420 B.C.

A large body of written work was produced at Abdera, during and after
Democritus’ time. Thrasyllus, Roman scholar of the first century A.D.,
using the work of Alexandrian scholars, arranged these works in
tetralogies, according to their subject-matter. Ethics (Tetralogies I
and II); Natural Science (III to VI); Mathematics (VII to IX); Music (X
and XI); and Technical Works (XII and XIII). There were also a group of
treatises under the title *Causes*; a group of monographs on various
subjects, the genuineness of which is suspect; a large number of Maxims;
and a group of forged writings on magic.

The <span class="smallcaps">tetralogies of thrasyllus</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Tetralogies</span> I and II: <span
class="smallcaps">Ethics</span>.

0a. (*Title*): '*Pythagoras*.'

0b. (*Title*): '*On the Character of the Sage*.'

0c. (*Title*): '*On those in Hades*.'

1\. (*Title*): '*On Hades*.'

1a. (*On making a will: those who cannot endure to do so*) are compelled
to endure a double lot (*? die twice*).

1b. (*Title*): '*Tritogeneia*' (*taken to mean 'three fold in origin',
on the Threeness of things*).

2\. (*Title*): '*Tritogeneia*', *of the three fold character of Athene
as Wisdom*.

2a. (*Title*): '*On Courage*.'

2b. (*Title*): '*The Horn of Amaltheia*.'

2c. (*Title*): '*On Cheerfulness or Well-Being*.'

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

3\. The man who wishes to have serenity of spirit should not engage in
many activities, either private or public, nor choose activities beyond
his power and natural capacity. He must guard against this, so that when
good fortune strikes him and leads him on to excess by means of (false)
seeming, he must rate it low, and not attempt things beyond his powers.
A reasonable fullness is better than overfullness.

4\. Pleasure and absence of pleasure are the criteria of what is
profitable and what is not.

4a. (*Title*): '*Ethical Notes*.'

<span class="smallcaps">tetralogies</span> III to VI: <span
class="smallcaps">Natural Science, including Logic</span>

4b. (*Title*): '*Great World-Order*' (*usually ascribed to Leucippus*).
*Democritus is said to have plagiarised it in his 'Small World-Order'*.

4c. (*Title*): '*Small World-Order*'.

5\. (*In the 'Small World-Order', Democritus said he was*) a young man
in the old age of Anaxagoras. (*He said he wrote the book* 730 *years
after the fall of Troy, and that Anaxagoras’ views on the sun were not
original but ancient, and he ridiculed his views on the arrangement of
the universe and on Mind*).

*Titles*

5a. '*On Cosmography*.'

5b. '*On the Planets*.'

5c. '*On Nature*' *or* '*On the Nature of the Universe*'.

5d. '*On Nature*' (*Second Part*), *or 'On the Nature of Man', or 'On
Flesh'*.

5e. '*On Mind*.'

5f. '*On Perception*.'

5g. '*On Tastes*.'

5h. '*On Colours*.'

5i. '*On the Different Forms*.'

6\. One must learn by this rule that Man is severed from reality. (*From
'On the Forms'*.)

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

7\. We know nothing about anything really, but Opinion is for all
individuals an inflowing (*? of the Atoms*). (*From 'On the Forms'*.)

8\. It will be obvious that it is impossible to understand how in
reality each thing is. (*From 'On the Forms'*.)

8a. (*Title*): '*On Changes of Form*.'

8b. (*Title*): '*On Strengthening Arguments*.'

9\. Sweet exists by convention, bitter by convention, colour by
convention; atoms and Void (*alone*) exist in reality . . . We know
nothing accurately in reality, but (*only*) as it changes according to
the bodily condition, and the constitution of those things that flow
upon (*the body*) and impinge upon it.

10\. It has often been demonstrated that we do not grasp how each thing
is or is not.

10a. (*Title*): '*On Images*' or '*On Foresight*'. (?)

10b. (*Title*): '*On Logic*' or '*The Canon*'. (3 *Books*).

11\. There are two sorts of knowledge, one genuine, one bastard (*or
'obscure'*). To the latter belong all the following: sight, hearing,
smell, taste, touch. The real is separated from this. When the bastard
can do no more—neither see more minutely, nor hear, nor smell, nor
taste, nor perceive by touch—and a finer investigation is needed, then
the genuine comes in as having a tool for distinguishing more finely.
(*From 'The Canon'*).

11a. (*Title*): '*On Difficult Problems*.'

<span class="smallcaps">unclassified writings on 'causes'</span>

(*Titles*)

11b. '*Heavenly Causes*.'

Sphere*'.

of a Voyage Round the World were written by Hecataeus, Hellanicus, and
Damastes of Sigeion copying for the most part Hellanicus. Democritus and
Eudoxus followed, and some others. The ancients described the world as
round, with Greece in the centre, and Delphi the centre of Greece. But
Democritus, a man of wide experience, was the first to describe it as
rectangular, the length half the width. Dicaearchus the Peripatetic

20a. (*Title*): '*On Homer, or a Correct Diction and Vocabulary*.'

21\. Homer, having been gifted with a divine nature, built an ordered

22\. The eagle has black bones.

23\. (<span class="smallcaps">Scholiast</span> on Homer: *The Trojan
herald speaking to the Greeks says of Paris 'Would that he had perished
first!'* ('*Iliad*,' VII. 390). *Democritus thinks that he spoke this as

Greeks call the Air nowadays, said: 'Zeus considers all things and he
knows all and gives and takes away all and is King of all.'

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

31\. Medicine heals diseases of the body, wisdom frees the soul from
passions.

32\. Coition is a slight attack of apoplexy. For man gushes forth from
man, and is separated by being torn apart with a kind of blow. <span

divine, but he who chooses those of the body, chooses things human.

38\. It is noble to prevent the criminal; but if one cannot, one should
not join him in crime.

39\. One must either be good, or imitate a good man.

40\. Men find happiness neither by means of the body nor through
possessions, but through uprightness and wisdom.

41\. Refrain from crimes not through fear but through duty.

42\. It is a great thing, when one is in adversity, to think of duty.

43\. Repentance for shameful deeds is salvation in life.

44\. = 225.

45\. The wrongdoer is more unfortunate than the man wronged.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

46\. Magnanimity consists in enduring tactlessness with mildness.

47\. Well-ordered behaviour consists in obedience to the law, the ruler,
and the man wiser (*than oneself*).

48\. When inferior men censure, the good man pays no heed.

49\. It is hard to be governed by one's inferior.

50\. The man completely enslaved to wealth can never be honest.

51\. In power of persuasion, reasoning is far stronger than gold.

52\. He who tries to give intelligent advice to one who thinks he has
intelligence, is wasting his time.

53\. Many who have not learnt Reason, nevertheless live according to
reason.

53a. Many whose actions are most disgraceful practise the best
utterances.

54\. The foolish learn sense through misfortune.

55\. One should emulate the deeds and actions of virtue, not the words.

56\. Noble deeds are recognised and emulated by those of natural good
disposition.

57\. Good breeding in cattle depends on physical health, but in men on a
well-formed character.

58\. The hopes of right-thinking men are attainable, but those of the
unintelligent are impossible.

59\. Neither skill nor wisdom is attainable unless one learns.

60\. It is better to examine one's own faults than those of others.

61\. Those whose character is well-ordered have also a well-ordered
life.

62\. Virtue consists, not in avoiding wrong-doing, but in having no wish
thereto.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

63\. To pronounce praise on noble deeds is noble; for to do so over base
deeds is the work of a false deceiver.

64\. Many much-learned men have no intelligence. <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)

65\. One should practise much-sense, not much-learning. <span
id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)

66\. It is better to deliberate before action than to repent afterwards.

67\. Believe not everything, but only what is approved: the former is
foolish, the latter the act of a sensible man.

68\. The worthy and the unworthy man (*are to be known*) not only by
their actions, but also their wishes.

69\. For all men, good and true are the same; but pleasant differs for
different men.

70\. Immoderate desire is the mark of a child, not a man.

71\. Untimely pleasures produce unpleasantnesses.

72\. Violent desire for one thing blinds the soul to all others.

73\. Virtuous love consists in decorous desire for the beautiful.

74\. Accept no pleasure unless it is beneficial.

75\. It is better for fools to be ruled than to rule.

76\. For the foolish, not reason but advantage is the teacher.

77\. Fame and wealth without intelligence are dangerous possessions.

78\. To make money is not without use, but if it comes from wrong-doing,
nothing is worse.

79\. It is a bad thing to imitate the bad, and not even to wish to
imitate the good.

80\. It is shameful to be so busy over the affairs of others that one
knows nothing of one's own.

81\. Constant delay means work undone.

82\. The false and the seeming-good are those who do all in word, not in

83\. The cause of error is ignorance of the better.

84\. The man who does shameful deeds must first feel shame in his own
eyes.

85\. He who contradicts and chatters much is ill-fitted for learning
what he ought.

86\. It is greed to do all the talking and not be willing to listen.

87\. One must be on one's guard against the bad man, lest he seize his
opportunity.

88\. The envious man torments himself like an enemy.

89\. An enemy is not he who injures, but he who wishes to do so.

90\. The enmity of relatives is much worse than that of strangers.

91\. Be not suspicious towards all, but be cautious and firm.

92\. Accept favours in the foreknowledge that you will have to give a
greater return for them.

93\. When you do a favour, study the recipient first, lest he prove a
scoundrel and repay evil for good.

94\. Small favours at the right time are greatest to the recipients.

95\. Marks of honour are greatly valued by right-thinking men, who
understand why they are being honoured.

96\. The generous man is he who does not look for a return, but who does
good from choice.

97\. Many who seem friendly are not so, and those who do not seem so,
are.

98\. The friendship of one intelligent man is better than that of all
the unintelligent. <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_80.md)

99\. Life is not worth living for the man who has not even one good
friend.

100\. The man whose tested friends do not stay long with him is
bad-tempered.

101\. Many avoid their friends when they fall from wealth to poverty.

102\. In all things, equality is fair, excess and deficiency not so, in
my opinion.

103\. The man who loves nobody is, I think, loved by no one.

104\. In old age, a man is agreeable if his manner is pleasant and his
speech serious.

105\. Physical beauty is (*merely*) animal unless intelligence be
present.

106\. In prosperity it is easy to find a friend, in adversity nothing is
so difficult.

107\. Not all one's relatives are friends, but only those who agree with
us about what is advantageous.

107a. It is proper, since we are human beings, not to laugh at the
misfortunes of others, but to mourn.

108\. Good things are obtained with difficulty if one seeks; but bad
things come without our even seeking.

109\. The censorious are not well-fitted for friendship.

110\. A woman must not practise argument: this is dreadful.

111\. To be ruled by a woman is the ultimate outrage for a man.

112\. It is the mark of the divine intellect to be always calculating
something noble.

113\. Those who praise the unintelligent do (them) great harm.

114\. It is better to be praised by another than by oneself.

115\. If you do not recognise (*i.e.* *understand*) praise, believe that
you are being flattered.

154\. We are pupils of the animals in the most important things: the

155\. If a cone were cut by a plane parallel to the base, <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_81.md) what ought one to think of the surfaces
resulting from the section: are they equal or unequal? If they are
unequal, they will make the cone have many steplike indentations and
unevennesses; but if they are equal, the sections will be equal, and the
cone will appear to have the same property as a cylinder, being made up
of equal, not unequal, circles, which is most absurd.

155a. (<span class="smallcaps">Aristotle</span>: *Democritus treats the
sphere as a sort of angle when cutting it*).

156\. Naught exists just as much as Aught.

157\. Learn thoroughly the art of statesmanship, which is the greatest,

158\. Men thinking new thoughts with each day.

159\. (*Democritus said*): If the body brought a suit against the soul,
for all the pains it had endured throughout life, and the illtreatment,
and I were to be the judge of the suit, I would gladly condemn the soul,
in that it had partly ruined the body by its neglect and dissolved it
with bouts of drunkenness, and partly destroyed it and torn it in pieces
with its passion for pleasure—as if, when a tool or a vessel were in a
bad condition, I blamed the man who was using it carelessly.

160\. (*To live badly is*) not to live badly, but to spend a long time
dying.

161\. (<span class="smallcaps">Scholiast</span> on Apollonius Rhodius:
*Eclipses were called 'down-drawings' up to the time of Democritus, with
reference to the ancient belief that sorceresses could draw down the sun
and moon and so cause eclipses*).

162\. (<span class="smallcaps">Scholiast</span> on Homer, *Iliad*, XIII.
137: *Democritus uses the epic word for 'large boulder' for the
cylinder*).

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

163\. (SEXTUS: *Democritus mentions Xeniades of Corinth*).

164\. Living creatures consort with their kind, as doves with doves, and
cranes with cranes, and similarly with the rest of the animal world. So
it is with inanimate things, as one can see with the sieving of seeds
and with the pebbles on beaches. In the former, through the circulation
of the sieve, beans are separated and ranged with beans, barley-grains
with barley, and wheat with wheat; in the latter, with the motion of the
wave, oval pebbles are driven to the same place as oval, and round to
round, as if the similarity in these things had a sort of power over
them which had brought them together.

165\. I say the following about the Whole . . . Man is that which we all
know.

166\. (<span class="smallcaps">Sextus</span>: *Democritus said that*)
certain images visit men (*some beneficent, some harmful. He prayed*) to
meet with fortunate images.

167\. An eddy, of all manner of forms, is separated off from the Whole.

168\. (<span class="smallcaps">Simplicius</span>: *The Democriteans
called the atoms 'nature' . . . For they said that these were*)
scattered about.

169\. Do not try to understand everything, lest you become ignorant of
everything.

170\. Happiness, like unhappiness, is a property of the soul.

171\. Happiness does not dwell in flocks of cattle or in gold. The soul
is the dwelling-place of the (*good and evil*) genius.

172\. Those same things from which we get good can also be for us a
source of hurt, or else we can avoid the hurt. For instance, deep water
is useful for many purposes, and yet again harmful; for there is danger
of being drowned. A technique has therefore been invented: instruction
in swimming.

173\. For mankind, evil comes out of what is good, if one does not know
how to guide and drive correctly. It is not right to place such things
in the category of evil, but in that of good. It is possible also to use
what is good for an evil end <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_82.md) if one
wishes.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

174\. The cheerful man, who is impelled towards works that are just and
lawful, rejoices by day and by night, and is strong and free from care.
But the man who neglects justice, and does not do what he ought, finds
all such things disagreeable when he remembers any of them, and he is
afraid and torments himself.

175\. But the gods are the givers of all good things, both in the past
and now. They are not, however, the givers of things which are bad,
harmful or non-beneficial, either in the past or now, but men themselves
fall into these through blindness of mind and lack of sense.

176\. Chance is generous but unreliable. Nature, however, is
self-sufficient. Therefore it is victorious, by means of its smaller but
reliable (*power*) over the greater promise of hope.

177\. Neither can fine speech cover up base action, nor can good action
be injured by calumny.

178\. Worst of all things is frivolity as the educator of youth, for it
breeds those pleasures from which wickedness comes.

179\. If children are allowed not to work, <span
id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) they cannot learn letters or music or
gymnastic, nor that which above all things embraces virtue, (*namely*)
reverence. For it is precisely from these studies that reverence usually
grows.

180\. Education is an ornament for the prosperous, a refuge for the
unfortunate.

181\. The man who employs exhortation and persuasion will turn out to be
a more effective guide to virtue than he who employs law and compulsion.
For the man who is prevented by law from wrongdoing will probably do
wrong in secret, whereas the man who is led towards duty by persuasion
will probably not do anything untoward either secretly or openly.
Therefore the man who acts rightly through understanding and knowledge
becomes at the same time brave and upright.

182\. Beautiful objects are wrought by study through effort, but ugly
things are reaped automatically without toil. For

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

even one who is unwilling is sometimes so wrought upon by learning (?
*MSS. corrupt*).

183\. There is an intelligence of the young, and an un-intelligence of
the aged. It is not time that teaches wisdom, but early training and
natural endowment.

184\. Continuous association with base men increases a disposition to
crime.

185\. The hopes of the educated are better than the wealth of the
ignorant.

186\. Similarity of outlook creates friendship.

187\. It is right that men should value the soul rather than the body;
for perfection of soul corrects the inferiority of the body, but
physical strength without intelligence does nothing to improve the mind.

188\. The criterion of the advantageous and disadvantageous is enjoyment
and lack of enjoyment.

189\. The best way for a man to lead his life is to have been as
cheerful as possible and to have suffered as little as possible. This
could happen if one did not seek one's pleasures in mortal things.

190\. One must avoid even speaking of evil deeds.

191\. Cheerfulness is created for men through moderation of enjoyment
and harmoniousness of life. Things that are in excess or lacking are apt
to change and cause great disturbance in the soul. Souls which are
stirred by great divergences are neither stable nor cheerful. Therefore
one must keep one's mind on what is attainable, and be content with what
one has, paying little heed to things envied and admired, and not
dwelling on them in one's mind. Rather must you consider the lives of
those in distress, reflecting on their intense sufferings, in order that
your own possessions and condition may seem great and enviable, and you
may, by ceasing to desire more, cease to suffer in your soul. For he who
admires those who have, and who are called happy by other mortals, and
who dwells on them in his mind every hour, is constantly compelled to
undertake something new and to run the risk, through

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

his desire, of doing something irretrievable among those things which
the laws prohibit. Hence one must not seek the latter, but must be
content with the former, comparing one's own life with that of those in
worse cases, and must consider oneself fortunate, reflecting on their
sufferings, in being so much better off than they. If you keep to this
way of thinking, you will live more serenely, and will expel those
not-negligible curses in life, envy, jealousy and spite.

192\. It is easy to praise and blame what one should not, but both are
the marks of a corrupt character.

193\. It is the business of intelligence to guard against a threatened
injustice, but it is the mark of insensibility not to avenge it when it
has happened.

194\. The great pleasures come from the contemplation of noble works.

195\. . . . Images conspicuous for their dress and ornament, empty of
heart.

196\. Forgetfulness of one's own ills breeds boldness.

197\. Fools are shaped by the gifts of chance, but those who understand
these things by the gifts of wisdom.

198\. The animal needing something knows how much it needs, the man does
not.

199\. People are fools who hate life and yet wish to live through fear
of Hades.

200\. People are fools who live without enjoyment of life.

201\. People are fools who yearn for long life without pleasure in long
life.

202\. People are fools who yearn for what is absent, but neglect what
they have even when it is more valuable than what has gone.

203\. Men who shun death pursue it.

204\. Fools cannot satisfy anyone in the whole of life.

205\. Fools long for life because they fear death.

206\. Fools want to live to be old because they fear death.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

207\. One should choose not every pleasure, but only that concerned with
the beautiful.

208\. The self-control of the father is the greatest example for the
children.

209\. For a self-sufficiency in food, there is never a 'short night'.
(*i.e.* *those who have independence of means do not suffer from
insomnia*).

210\. A rich table is provided by luck, but a sufficient one by wisdom.

211\. Moderation multiplies pleasures, and increases pleasure.

212\. Sleep in the daytime signifies bodily trouble or aberration of
mind or laziness or lack of training.

213\. Courage minimises difficulties.

214\. The brave man is not only he who overcomes the enemy, but he who
is stronger than pleasures. Some men are masters of cities, but are
enslaved to women.

215\. The reward of justice is confidence of judgement and
imperturbability, but the end of injustice is the fear of disaster.

216\. Imperturbable wisdom is worth everything.

217\. They alone are dear to the gods to whom crime is hateful.

218\. Riches derived from evil activity make the disgrace more
conspicuous.

219\. The passion for wealth, unless limited by satisfaction, is far
more painful than extreme poverty; for greater passions create greater
needs.

220\. Evil gains bring loss of virtue.

221\. The hope of evil gains is the beginning of damage.

222\. The excessive accumulation of wealth for one's children is an
excuse for covetousness, which thus displays its peculiar nature.

223\. The things needed by the body are available to all without toil
and trouble. But the things which require toil

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

and trouble and which make life disagreeable are not desired by the body
but by the ill-constitution of the mind.

224\. The desire for more loses what one has, like the dog in Aesop.

225\. One should tell the truth, not speak at length.

226\. Freedom of speech is the sign of freedom; but the danger lies in
discerning the right occasion.

227\. Misers have the fate of bees: they work as if they were going to
live for ever.

228\. The children of misers, if they are reared in ignorance, are like
those dancers who leap between swords: if they miss, in their leap
downwards, a single place where they must plant their feet, they are
destroyed. But it is hard to alight upon the one spot, because only the
space for the feet is left. So too with the children of misers: if they
miss the paternal character of carefulness and thrift, they are apt to
be destroyed.

229\. Thrift and fasting are beneficial; so too is expenditure at the
right time. But to recognise this is the function of a good man.

230\. The life without festival is a long road without an inn.

231\. The right-minded man is he who is not grieved by what he has not,
but enjoys what he has.

232\. Of pleasures, those that come most rarely give the greatest
enjoyment.

233\. If one oversteps the due measure, the most pleasurable things
become most unpleasant.

234\. Men ask in their prayers for health from the gods, but do not know
that the power to attain this lies in themselves; and by doing the
opposite through lack of control, they themselves become the betrayers
of their own health to their desires.

235\. All who derive their pleasures from the stomach, overstepping due
season in eating or drinking or sexual pleasure, have pleasures that are
but brief and short-lived, (that is), only while they are eating and
drinking, but pains that are many. For this desire is always present for
the same things,

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

and when people get what they desire, the pleasure passes quickly, and
they have nothing good for themselves except a brief enjoyment; and then
again the need for the same things returns.

236\. It is hard to fight desire; but to control it is the sign of a
reasonable man. <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_84.md)

237\. All bellicosity is foolish; for in studying the disadvantage of
one's enemy, one loses sight of one's own advantage.

238\. The man who strives against the stronger ends in disgrace.

239\. Bad men, when they escape, do not keep the oaths which they make
in time of stress.

240\. Toils undertaken willingly make the endurance of those done
unwillingly easier.

241\. Continuous labour becomes easier through habit.

242\. More men become good through practice than by nature.

243\. All kinds of toil are pleasanter than rest, when men attain that
for which they labour, or know that they will attain it. But whenever
there is failure to attain, then labour is painful and hard.

244\. Do not say or do what is base, even when you are alone. Learn to
feel shame in your own eyes much more than before others.

245\. The laws would not prevent each man from living according to his
inclination, unless individuals harmed each other; for envy creates the
beginning of strife.

246\. Life in a foreign country teaches self-sufficiency; for bread and
bed are the sweetest cures for hunger and fatigue.

247\. To a wise man, the whole earth is open; for the native land of a
good soul is the whole earth.

248\. The law wishes to benefit men's life; and it is able to do so,
when they themselves wish to receive benefit; for it shows to those who
obey it their own particular virtue.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

249\. Civil war is harmful to both parties; for both to the conquerors
and the conquered, the destruction is the same.

250\. The greatest undertakings are carried through by means of concord,
including wars between City-States: there is no other way.

251\. Poverty under democracy is as much to be preferred to so-called
prosperity under an autocracy as freedom to slavery.

252\. One must give the highest importance to affairs of the State, that
it may be well run; one must not pursue quarrels contrary to right, nor
acquire a power contrary to the common good. The well-run State is the
greatest protection, and contains all in itself; when this is safe, all
is safe; when this is destroyed, all is destroyed.

253\. To good men, it is not advantageous that they should neglect their
own affairs for other things; for their private affairs suffer. But if a
man neglects public affairs, he is ill spoken of, even if he steals
nothing and does no wrong. And if he is <span
id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_85.md) negligent and does wrong, he is liable not
only to be ill-spoken of but also to suffer bodily harm. To make
mistakes is inevitable, but men find it hard to forgive.

254\. When base men enter upon office, the more unworthy they are, the
more neglectful, and they are filled with folly and recklessness.

255\. When the powerful prevail upon themselves to lend to the indigent,
and help them, and benefit them, herein at last is pity, and an end to
isolation, and friendship, and mutual aid, and harmony among the
citizens; and other blessings such as no man could enumerate.

256\. Justice is to do what should be done; injustice is to fail to do
what should be done, and to put it aside.

257\. With certain animals, the rule for killing them or not stands
thus: any that do wrong and wish to do so may be killed with impunity,
and it conduces to well-being to do so rather than not do so.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

258\. One must at all costs kill all those creatures which do hurt
contrary to justice. The man who does this has the greater share of
cheerfulness(?) and justice and courage and property(?) in every ordered
society (*than he who does not*). <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_86.md)

259\. As has been laid down (*by me*) regarding beasts and reptiles
which are inimical (*to man*), so I think one should do with regard to
human beings: one should, according to ancestral law, kill an enemy of
the State in every ordered society, unless a law forbids it. But there
are prohibitions in every State: sacred law, treaties and oaths.

260\. Anyone killing any brigand or pirate shall be exempt from penalty,
whether he do it by his own hand, or by instigation, or by vote.

261\. One must punish wrong-doers to the best of one's ability, and not
neglect it. Such conduct is just and good, but the neglect of it is
unjust and bad.

262\. Those who do what is deserving of exile or imprisonment or other
punishment must be condemned and not let off. Whoever contrary to the
law acquits a man, judging according to profit or pleasure, does wrong,
and this is bound to be on his conscience.

263\. He has the greatest share of justice and virtue who awards the
greatest offices (*honours?*) (*to the most deserving*).

264\. One must not respect the opinion of other men more than one's own;
nor must one be more ready to do wrong if no one will know than if all
will know. One must respect one's own opinion most, and this must stand
as the law of one's soul, preventing one from doing anything improper.

265\. Men remember one's mistakes rather than one's successes. This is
just; for as those who return a deposit do not deserve praise, whereas
those who do not do so deserve blame and punishment, so with the
official: he was elected not to make mistakes but to do things well.

266\. There is no means under the present constitution by which
magistrates can be prevented from wrong-doing, however good they may be.
For it is not likely for anyone else

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (*any more*) than
for oneself, that he will show himself the same man in different
circumstances. <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_87.md) But we must also make
arrangements to see that if a magistrate does no wrong, and convicts
wrong-doers, he shall not fall under the power of the latter; rather, a
law or some other means must defend the magistrate who does what is
just.

267\. Rule belongs by nature to the stronger.

268\. Fear engenders flattery, but it has no good will.

269\. Courage is the beginning of action, but Fortune is the arbiter of
the goal.

270\. Use slaves as parts of the body: each to his own function.

271\. A lover's reproach is dissolved by (*? corrupt word*).

272\. The man who is fortunate in his choice of a son-in-law gains a
son; the man unfortunate in his choice loses his daughter also.

273\. A woman is far sharper than a man in malign thoughts.

274\. An adornment for a woman is lack of garrulity. Paucity of
adornment is also beautiful.

275\. The rearing of children is full of pitfalls. Success is attended
by strife and care, failure means grief beyond all others.

276\. I do not think that one should have children. I observe in the
acquisition of children many great risks and many griefs, whereas a
harvest is rare, and even when it exists, it is thin and poor.

277\. Whoever wants to have children should, in my opinion, choose them
from the family of one of his friends. He will thus obtain a child such
as he wishes, for he can select the kind he wants. And the one that
seems fittest will be most likely to follow on his natural endowment.
The difference is that in the latter way one can take one child out of
many who is according to one's liking; but if one begets a child of
one's own, the risks are many, for one is bound to accept him as he is.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

278\. For human beings it is one of the necessities of life to have
children, arising from nature and primeval law. It is obvious in the
other animals too: they all have offspring by nature, and not for the
sake of any profit. And when they are born, the parents work and rear
each as best they can and are anxious for them while they are small, and
if anything happens to them, the parents are grieved. But for man it has
now become an established belief that there should be also some
advantage from the offspring.

279\. One should, as far as possible, divide out one's property among
one's children, at the same time watching over them to see that they do
nothing foolish when they have it in their hands. For they thus become
much more thrifty over money, and more eager to acquire it and compete
with one another. Payments made in a communal establishment do not irk
so much as those in a private one, and the income gives much less
satisfaction.

280\. It is possible without spending much of one's money to educate
one's children, and (*so*) to build round their property and their
persons a fortification and a safeguard.

281\. As among sores canker is the worst disease, so in property . . .
(*end lost*).

282\. The employment of money with sense is useful towards liberality
and justice, but with folly it is a continuous tax that maintains all
and sundry (*? reading and meaning uncertain*).

283\. Poverty and wealth are terms for lack and superfluity; so that he
who lacks is not wealthy, and he who does not lack is not poor.

284\. If your desires are not great, a little will seem much to you; for
small appetite makes poverty equivalent to wealth.

285\. One should realise that human life is weak and brief and mixed
with many cares and difficulties, in order that one may care only for
moderate possessions, and that hardship may be measured by the standard
of one's needs.

286\. He is fortunate who is happy with moderate means, unfortunate who
is unhappy with great possessions.

287\. Communal distress is harder than that of individuals; for there
remains no hope of assistance.

288\. Disease of the home and of the life comes about in the same way as
that of the body.

289\. It is unreasonableness not to submit to the necessary conditions
of life.

290\. Cast forth uncontrollable grief from your benumbed soul by means
of reason.

291\. To bear poverty well is the sign of a sensible man.

292\. The hopes of the unintelligent are senseless.

293\. Those to whom their neighbours' misfortunes give pleasure do not
understand that the blows of fate are common to all; and also they lack
cause for personal joy.

294\. The good things of youth are strength and beauty, but the flower
of age is moderation.

295\. The old man has been young; but the young man cannot know if he
will reach old age. Thus the perfected good is better than the uncertain
future.

296\. Old age is a general mutilation. It possesses everything (*i.e.*
*all the limbs and organs*), but they each lack something.

297\. Some men, not knowing about the dissolution of mortal nature, but
acting on knowledge of the suffering in life, afflict the period of life
with anxieties and fears, inventing false tales about the period after
the end of life.

298\. (<span class="smallcaps">Suidas</span>: *Democritus uses the word

*Doubtful fragment*

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

299\. (*Title*): '*The Babylonian Writings*.' (*Translation of the
Pillar of Akikaros*.)

I have travelled most extensively of all men of my time, making the most
distant inquiries, and have seen the most climes and lands, and have
heard the greatest number of learned men; and no one has ever surpassed
me in the composition of treatises with proofs, not even the so-called
Arpedonaptae of Egypt; with them I passed eighty <span

whole populace and the populace worth one. <span

303\. (*Graeco-Syrian Maxims*). Wise men when visiting a foreign land
must silently and quietly reconnoitre while they look and listen to find
out the reputation of the wise men there: what they are like, and if
they can hold their own before them while they secretly weigh their
words against their own in their minds. When they have weighed and seen
which group is

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

better than the other, then they should make known the riches of their
own wisdom, so that they may be prized for the sake of the treasure
which is their property, while they enrich others from it. But if their
knowledge is too small to allow them to dispense from it, they should
take from the others and go their way. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_73"></span>[94:1](app63.htm#fr_78.md) Some emend γνώμης to
γνώμονος ('*Gnômôn*'); Heath prefers γωνὶης ('angle'). *See Greek
Mathematics*, I, p. 178.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[94:2](app63.htm#fr_79.md) Diels: 'The Parapêgma
was a bronze or marble indicator of the days of the solar year according
to the Zodiac, together with the customary weather-signs. Beside the
days were holes in which the days of the civil month could be inserted.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[96:1](app63.htm#fr_80.md) Bird-days are those on
which migrant birds appear; bird-winds are those which bring migrant
birds.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[98:1](app63.htm#fr_82.md) These are thought to be
the work of another Democritus, who according to Suidas wrote two books
on Tactics and one on the Jews: perhaps Democritus of Mende.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[99:1](app63.htm#fr_83.md) Pun on ἀποπληξίη and
πληγή.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[99:2](app63.htm#fr_84.md) Given in a collection
called 'Maxims of Democratês'. But Stobaeus quotes as 'Maxims of
Democritus’ many of the sayings here recorded; it is therefore thought
that 'Democrates' is a corruption of 'Democritus', or perhaps a later
attribution by Byzantine scholars who had discovered the existence of
one Democrates of Aphidna in Attica, a writer on agriculture of the
fourth century B.C.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[101:1](app63.htm#fr_86.md) Cp. Heracleitus, Frg.
40.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[102:1](app63.htm#fr_87.md) Cp. Heracleitus, Frg.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[106:1](app63.htm#fr_88.md) 'By which is clearly
meant a plane indefinitely near to the base.' Heath, *Greek
Mathematics*, I, pp. 199-80.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[107:1](app63.htm#fr_89.md) The MS. reading ἀλκήν
is emended by Diels-Kranz to ἀλκῇ and translated: 'It is possible to use
what is good as a help against what is evil.'

<span id="fn_83"></span>[108:1](app63.htm#fr_90.md) It seems best to take
μὴ πονεῖν, after the intrans. ἀνιέντες, as a consecutive infinitive: 'If
children are left free so as not to work.' Kranz translates: 'If we do
not leave children free to work.'

<span id="fn_84"></span>[113:1](app63.htm#fr_91.md) Cp. Heracleitus, Frg.
85.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[114:1](app63.htm#fr_92.md) Meineke inserted the
negative μή which was accepted by Diels-Kranz.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[115:1](app63.htm#fr_93.md) For the doubtful words,
the MSS. have εὐθυμίης and κτάσεως. Various emendations have been
suggested, but none is satisfactory.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[116:1](app63.htm#fr_94.md) *i.e.* power may
corrupt even the best. Diels took τοὺς ἄρχοντας as the object of άδικεῖν
and translated: 'There is no means of protecting the magistrates from
hurt.' He then could make nothing of the next sentence, and was obliged
to assume a lacuna.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[118:1](app63.htm#fr_95.md) From a Herculanean MS.
of Demetrius of Byzantium, who wrote 'On Poetry'. He quotes an unnamed
author whom Wilamowitz took to be Democritus, because of the dialect.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[118:2](app63.htm#fr_96.md) For a discussion of
these, see *Companion*, pp. 323-5.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[119:1](app63.htm#fr_97.md) Probably a scribe's
mistake for 'five'.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[119:2](app63.htm#fr_98.md) The work of Bolus of
Mende, Ch. 78 below.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[119:3](app63.htm#fr_99.md) From the Corpus
Parisinum Profanum. Some of these are the same as genuine fragments of
Democritus; but many come from other writers, and the collection must be
regarded as unauthentic.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[119:4](app63.htm#fr_100.md) Cp. Heracleitus, Frg.
49.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[120:1](app63.htm#fr_101.md) Gomperz regarded this
as genuine.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[120:2](app63.htm#fr_102.md) Protagoras, Frg. 1.
