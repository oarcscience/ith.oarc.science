### 72. ANAXARCHUS OF ABDÊRA

<span class="smallcaps">Anaxarchus</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Abdêra</span> was in his prime about 340 B.C., and was
active throughout the reign of Alexander.

He wrote a book *On Monarchy*.

1\. Much learning can help much, but also can greatly harm him who has
it. It helps the clever man, but harms him who readily utters every word
in any company. One must know the measure of the right time, for this is
the boundary of wisdom. Those who recite a saying outside the right
time, even if their saying is wise, are reproached with folly, because
they do not mix intelligence with wisdom.

2\. (*From the work 'On Monarchy'*): It is hard to collect money, but
harder still to keep it safely.
