### 79. THE OLDER SOPHISTS: NAME AND CONCEPT

<span class="smallcaps">The Older Sophists: Name And Concept</span>.
These men were active during the latter part of the fifth and early part
of the fourth centuries B.C.

'Sophistês' originally meant 'skilled craftsman' or 'wise man'. The
specialised meaning 'professional teacher' did not come into use until
the end of the fifth century B.C., the period of the travelling
teachers. The bad sense of the word developed almost immediately;
Aristotle summed up the Sophist's art as 'the appearance, not the
reality, of wisdom', and the Sophist as one who makes money out of this
pretence.

The title was nevertheless used in Roman Imperial times for 'professor'
of rhetoric, or prose writer, without any bad meaning.
