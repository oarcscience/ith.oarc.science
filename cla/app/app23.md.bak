### 28. PARMENIDES OF ELEA

<span class="smallcaps">Parmenides</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Elea</span> was in his prime about 475 B.C.

He wrote a poem in hexameter verse, addressed to his pupil Zeno; it was
divided into three parts: the Prologue, the Way of Truth, the Way of
Opinion.

1\. The mares which carry me conveyed me as far as my desire reached,
when the goddesses who were driving had set me on the famous highway
which bears a man who has knowledge through all the cities. Along this
way I was carried; for by this way the exceedingly intelligent mares
bore me, drawing the chariot, and the maidens directed the way. The axle
in the naves gave forth a pipe-like sound as it glowed (for it was
driven round by the two whirling circles (*wheels*) at each end)
whenever the maidens, daughters of the Sun, having left the Palace of
Night, hastened their driving towards the light, having pushed back
their veils from their heads with their hands.

There (*in the Palace of Night*) are the gates of the paths of Night and
Day, and they are enclosed with a lintel above and a stone threshold
below. The gates themselves are filled with great folding doors; and of
these Justice, mighty to punish, has the interchangeable keys. The
maidens, skilfully cajoling her with soft words, persuaded her to push
back the bolted

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

bar without delay from the gates; and these, flung open, revealed a wide
gaping space, having swung their jambs, richly-wrought in bronze,
reciprocally in their sockets. This way, then, straight through them
went the maidens, driving chariot and mares along the carriage-road.

And the goddess received me kindly, and took my right hand in hers, and
thus she spoke and addressed me:

'Young man, companion of immortal charioteers, who comest by the help of
the steeds which bring thee to our dwelling: welcome!—since no evil fate
has despatched thee on thy journey by this road (for truly it is far
from the path trodden by mankind); no, it is divine command and Right.
Thou shalt inquire into everything: both the motionless heart of
well-rounded Truth, and also the opinions of mortals, in which there is
no true reliability. But nevertheless thou shalt learn these things
(opinions) also—how one should go through all the things-that-seem,
without exception, and test them. <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_21.md)

2\. Come, I will tell you—and you must accept my word when you have
heard it—the ways of inquiry which alone are to be thought: the one that
<span class="smallcaps">it is</span>, and it is not possible for <span
class="smallcaps">it not to be</span>, is the way of credibility, for it
follows Truth; the other, that <span class="smallcaps">it is not</span>,
and that <span class="smallcaps">it</span> is bound <span
class="smallcaps">not to be</span>: this I tell you is a path that
cannot be explored; for you could neither recognise that which is <span
class="smallcaps">not</span>, nor express it.

3\. For it is the same thing to think and to be. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_22.md)

4\. Observe nevertheless how things absent are securely present to the
mind; for it will not sever Being from its connection with Being,
whether it is scattered everywhere utterly throughout the universe, or
whether it is collected together.

5\. It is all the same to me from what point I begin, for I shall return
again to this same point.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

6\. One should both say and think that Being Is; for To Be is possible,
and Nothingness is not possible. This I command you to consider; for
from the latter way of search first of all I debar you. But next I debar
you from that way along which wander mortals knowing nothing,
two-headed, <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) for perplexity in their
bosoms steers their intelligence astray, and they are carried along as
deaf as they are blind, amazed, uncritical hordes, by whom To Be and Not
To Be are regarded as the same and not the same, and (*for whom*) in
everything there is a way of opposing stress. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_24.md)

7, 8. For this (*view*) can never predominate, that That Which Is Not
exists. You must debar your thought from this way of search, nor let
ordinary experience in its variety force you along this way, (*namely,
that of allowing*) the eye, sightless as it is, and the ear, full of
sound, and the tongue, to rule; but (*you must*) judge by means of the
Reason (*Logos*) the much-contested proof which is expounded by me.

There is only one other description of the way remaining, (*namely*),
that (*What Is*) Is. To this way there are very many sign-posts: that
Being has no coming-into-being and no destruction, for it is whole of
limb, without motion, and without end. And it never Was, nor Will Be,
because it Is now, a Whole all together, One, continuous; for what
creation of it will you look for? How, whence (*could it have*) sprung?
Nor shall I allow you to speak or think of it as springing from
Not-Being; for it is neither expressible nor thinkable that What-Is-Not
Is. Also, what necessity impelled it, if it did spring from Nothing, to
be produced later or earlier? Thus it must Be absolutely, or not at all.
Nor will the force of credibility ever admit that anything should come
into being, beside Being itself, out of Not-Being. So far as that is
concerned, Justice has never released (*Being*) in its fetters and set
it free either to come into being or to perish, but holds it fast. The
decision on these matters depends on the following: <span
class="smallcaps">it is</span>, or <span class="smallcaps">it is
not</span>. It is therefore decided—as is inevitable—(*that one must*)
ignore the one way as unthinkable and inexpressible (for it is no true
way) and take the other as the way of Being and Reality. How could Being
perish? How could it come into being? If it came into being, it Is Not;
and so too if it is

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

about-to-be at some future time. Thus Coming-into-Being is quenched, and
Destruction also into the unseen. <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_25.md)

Nor is Being divisible, since it is all alike. Nor is there anything
(*here or*) there which could prevent it from holding together, nor any
lesser thing, but all is full of Being. Therefore it is altogether
continuous; for Being is close to Being.

But it is motionless in the limits of mighty bonds, without beginning,
without cease, since Becoming and Destruction have been driven very far
away, and true conviction has rejected them. And remaining the same in
the same place, it rests by itself and thus remains there fixed; for
powerful Necessity holds it in the bonds of a Limit, which constrains it
round about, because it is decreed by divine law that Being shall not be
without boundary. For it is not lacking; but if it were (*spatially
infinite*), it would be lacking everything. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_26.md)

To think is the same as the thought that It Is; for you will not find
thinking without Being, in (*regard to*) which there is an expression.
For nothing else either is or shall be except Being, since Fate has tied
it down to be a whole and motionless; therefore all things that mortals
have established, believing in their truth, are just a name: Becoming
and Perishing, Being and Not-Being, and Change of position, and
alteration of bright colour.

But since there is a (*spatial*) Limit, it is complete on every side,
like the mass of a well-rounded sphere, equally balanced from its centre
in every direction; for it is not bound to be at all either greater or
less in this direction or that; nor is there Not-Being which could check
it from reaching to the same point, nor is it possible for Being to be
more in this direction, less in that, than Being, because it is an
inviolate whole. For, in all directions equal to itself, it reaches its
limits uniformly.

At this point I cease my reliable theory (*Logos*) and thought,
concerning Truth; from here onwards you must learn the opinions of
mortals, listening to the deceptive order of my words.

They have established (*the custom of*) naming two forms, one of which
ought not to be (*mentioned*): that is where they have gone astray. They
have distinguished them as opposite in

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

form, and have marked them off from another by giving them different
signs: on one side the flaming fire in the heavens, mild, very light
(*in weight*), the same as itself in every direction, and not the same
as the other. This (*other*) also is by itself and opposite: dark Night,
a dense and heavy body. This world-order I describe to you throughout as
it appears with all its phenomena, in order that no intellect of mortal
men may outstrip you. <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_27.md)

9\. But since all things are named Light and Night, and names have been
given to each class of things according to the power of one or the other
(*Light or Night*), everything is full equally of Light and invisible
Night, as both are equal, because to neither of them belongs any share
(of the other). <span id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_28.md)

10\. You shall know the nature of the heavens, and all the signs in the
heavens, and the destructive works of the pure bright torch of the sun,
and whence they came into being. And you shall learn of the wandering
works of the round-faced moon, and its nature; and you shall know also
the surrounding heaven, whence it sprang and how Necessity brought and
constrained it to hold the limits of the stars.

11\. (*I will describe*) how earth and sun and moon, and the aether
common to all, and the Milky Way in the heavens, and outermost Olympus,
and the hot power of the stars, hastened to come into being.

12\. For the narrower rings were filled with unmixed Fire, and those
next to them with Night, but between (*these*) rushes the portion of
Flame. And in the centre of these is the goddess who guides everything;
for throughout she rules over cruel Birth and Mating, sending the female
to mate with the male, and conversely again the male with the female.

13\. First of all the gods she devised Love.

14\. (*The moon*): Shining by night with a light not her own, wandering
round the earth.

15\. (*The moon*): Always gazing towards the rays of the sun.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

15a. (*Earth*): Rooted in water.

16\. For according to the mixture of much-wandering limbs which each man
has, so is the mind which is associated with mankind: for it is the same
thing which thinks, namely the constitution of the limbs in men, all and
individually; for it is excess which makes Thought.

17\. On the right, boys, on the left, girls . . . (*in the womb*).

18\. When a woman and a man mix the seeds of Love together, the power
(*of the seeds*) which shapes (*the embryo*) in the veins out of
different blood can mould well-constituted bodies only if it preserves
proportion. For if the powers war (*with each other*) when the seed is
mixed, and do not make a unity in the body formed by the mixture, they
will terribly harass the growing (*embryo*) through the twofold seed of
the (*two*) sexes.

19\. Thus, therefore, according to opinion, were these things created,
and are now, and shall hereafter from henceforth grow and then come to
an end. And for these things men have established a name as a
distinguishing mark for each.

*Doubtful*

20\. But below it (*Earth?*) is a path, dreadful, hollow, muddy; this is
the best path to lead one to the lovely grove of much-revered Aphrodite.

*Spurious*

21\. (*The moon*): Of false appearance.

22\. '*Remarkably hard to convince*'. (=<span
class="smallcaps">Plato</span>, *Parmenides*, 135A).

23\. (*The Acropolis of Boeotian Thebes was called in ancient times
'Islands of the Blest'*.)

24\. (*The Telchînes were created from the hounds of Actaeon, which were
changed into men by Zeus*).

25\. (= Empedocles, *Frg*. 28).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_21"></span>[42:1](app23.htm#fr_25.md) Reading δοκιμῶσ᾽ (=
δοκιμῶσαι) with Diels, *Vors*., Edn. 4, and not with Kranz (Wilamowitz)
δοκιμῶς (*Vors*., 5). Wilamowitz took περῶντα with τὰ δοκοῦντα, and
translated: ('Still, you shall learn these things too), how phenomena
had to be on a plausible footing, because these extend throughout
everything.' This interpretation is favoured by those who accept the
view that Parmenides left the door open for 'Opinion' in some form; it
was rejected by Diels, *Vors*. 4, Nachträge, p. xxviii, as contrary to
Parmenidean metaphysic. See *Companion*, pp. 141 *sqq*.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[42:2](app23.htm#fr_26.md) Or, reading ἔστιν: 'that
which it is possible to think is identical with that which can Be'.
(Zeller and Burnet, probably rightly).

<span id="fn_23"></span>[43:1](app23.htm#fr_27.md) *i.e.*, 'in two minds'.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[43:2](app23.htm#fr_28.md) Cp. Heracleitus, Frg. 8.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[44:1](app23.htm#fr_29.md) ἄπυστος, 'beyond
perception'; also ἄπαυστος, 'never-ending'.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[44:2](app23.htm#fr_30.md) Reading and meaning
doubtful. Diels-Kranz: 'if it lacked Limit, it would fall short of being
a Whole', but without any certainty.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[45:1](app23.htm#fr_31.md) Or, reading γνώμῃ
(Stein): 'in order that no mortal may outstrip you in intelligence'.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[45:2](app23.htm#fr_32.md) Kranz takes ἐπεὶ with
the previous line, and translates: 'For nothing is possible which does
not come under either of the two' (*i.e.* everything belongs to one or
other of the two categories Light and Night).
