### 89. THE ANONYMOUS WRITER QUOTED BY IAMBLICHUS

<span class="smallcaps">The Anonymous Writer Quoted by Iamblichus</span>

An ethico-political essay in literary Attic, believed to belong to the
time of the Peloponnesian War.

It deals with success; the factors necessary for its achievement
(natural endowment, good will, industry, an early start); how to use
success when attained; the need for self-control, which means being
superior to money but generous with soul (life); the disadvantages of
self-aggrandizement, and the advantages of obedience to law; the evil of
tyranny, which arises from lawlessness.
