### 36. IÔN OF CHIOS

<span class="smallcaps">Iôn</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Chios</span> was active between 452 and 421 B.C.

He wrote tragedies, lyrics and other poems; also a philosophical work in
prose called *Triagmos* ('*Triad*') or *Triagmoi*.

1\. The beginning of my work is: everything is Three and nothing more or
less than these three. The virtue of each thing is a Triad:
intelligence, strength, luck.

2\. (*Pythagoras ascribed some of his writings to Orpheus*).

3\. Luck, that differs greatly from Art, creates many things that are
like it.

3a. (*The twenty-fifth letter is called Agma*).

3b. (*Of men*) agreeing in their views and sharing the same libations.

4\. Thus Pherecydes, who was outstanding in manliness and reverence,
even after death has a joyful life for his soul, if the wise Pythagoras
had insight concerning all men and knew (*them*) thoroughly.

*Dubious fragment*

5\. Eleven-stringed lyre, which hast a ten-intervalled range, for a
triple melodious way of harmony, before thee the Hellenes used to play a
lyre of seven strings with (*only*) a tetrachord, creating a thin music!
