### 38. HIPPÔN OF SAMOS

<span class="smallcaps">Hippôn</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Samos</span> flourished during the middle of the fifth
century B.C. He published his views in several books; but only one

2\. (*Elegiac epitaph on himself, claiming apotheosis*).

3\. Nothing is more empty than much learning.

4\. The soul is very different from the body: it is active when the body
is inert, it sees when the body is blind and lives when the body is
dead.
