### 11. THALES OF MILÊTUS

<span class="smallcaps">Thales</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Milêtus</span> was in his prime about 585 B.C.

Whether he ever wrote a book is unknown; if he did, no genuine fragment
survives,.

1\. (*Title: 'Nautical Astronomy'*).

2\. (*There are two Hyades, one north and one south*).

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

*Late forgery*

3\. The much-discussed four substances—of which we say the chief is
Water, making it as it were the one Element—by combination and
solidification and coagulation of the substances in the universe mingle
with one another. In what way, I have already explained in Book One.

4\. (*Titles: 'On the Solstice'. 'On the Equinox'*).
