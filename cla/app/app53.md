### 58. PYTHAGOREAN SCHOOL

<span class="smallcaps">Pythagorean School</span>.

Accounts of Pythagoreanism derive mostly from Aristotle and the
Peripatetic School (Aristoxenus, Theophrastus, Eudemus), and from the
Neo-Platonists (Porphyry, Iamblichus, Proclus, Simplicius); there are
also extracts and references in the compilers (Diogenes Laertius,
Stobaeus) and the lexicographers. But these accounts are usually
referred to the Pythagorean School in general, not to any particular
member. It was a rule that discoveries were referred to Pythagoras
himself; and Pythagoras left no writings.
