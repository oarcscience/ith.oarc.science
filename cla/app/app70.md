### 75. NAUSIPHANES OF TEOS

<span class="smallcaps">Nausiphanes</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Teos</span> lived in the time of Alexander, and after.

He wrote a book called *The Tripod*, on epistemology and method. This
was said to have been the source of Epicurus’ *Canon*. It is preserved
in epitome only, by Philodemus.

1\. (*The man of science has the capacity for rhetoric, even if he does
not practise it*).

2\. (*The wise man will pursue rhetoric, because honour depends on
winning a reputation for cleverness in politics, rather than on the
over-lauded virtues.*

*The wise man is he who can persuade his hearers; this power belongs to
the man of science, its source being his knowledge of the facts, so that
he could pass on his own convictions not only to his pupils but to any
race of people. Having a knowledge of the facts, he is able to lead his
audience where he wishes, because he can tell them what is to their
advantage, which is what they wish to hear. The scientist has command of
the best diction also: not that created by vain imagination and usage,
but that based on the nature of things. He also has command of logic,
without which knowledge is impossible, and is best qualified in that art
indispensable to a statesman in a democracy or monarchy or any other
constitution, of calculation of the future from the known facts.*

*The man who employs continuous discourse will be best able to employ
the dialectic method and vice versa, because both depend on an accurate
judgement of how to lead pupils from the known to the unknown; that is,
they depend upon a knowledge of the 'right time' and 'right measure' in
speaking*).

3\. (*Nausiphanes gave 'immovability' as the goal of life, this being
the name he gave to Democritus’ 'imperturbability'*).

4\. (*Of those things which appear to exist, nothing exists more than it
does not exist*).
