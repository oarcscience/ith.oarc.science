1\. The Non-Limited is the original material of existing things;
further, the source from which existing things derive their existence is
also that to which they return at their destruction, according to
necessity; for they give justice and make reparation to one another for
their injustice, according to the arrangement of Time.

2\. This (essential nature, whatever it is, of the Non-Limited) is
everlasting and ageless.

3\. (*The Non-Limited*) is immortal and indestructible.

4\. Nozzle of the bellows.

5\. (*The Earth is like*) a stone column.
