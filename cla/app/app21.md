### 24. ALCMAEÔN OF CROTÔN

<span class="smallcaps">Alcmaeôn</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Crotôn</span> was in his prime at the beginning of the
fifth century B.C.

He wrote a book on Natural Science.

1\. Alcmaeon of Croton, son of Peirithous, said the following to
Brotinus and Leon and Bathyllus: concerning things unseen, (*as*)
concerning things mortal, the gods have certainty, whereas to us as men
conjecture (*only is possible*).

Ia. Man differs from the other (*creatures*) in that he alone
understands; the others perceive, but do not understand.

2\. Men perish because they cannot join the beginning to the end.

3\. (*In mules, the males are sterile because of the fineness and
coldness of the seed, and the females because their wombs do not open*).

4\. *Health is the* equality of rights *of the functions, wet-dry,
cold-hot, bitter-sweet and the rest; but* single rule *among them causes
disease; the single rule of either pair is deleterious. Disease* 

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

*occurs sometimes from an internal cause such as excess of heat or cold,
sometimes from an external cause such as excess or deficiency of food,
sometimes in a certain part, such as blood, marrow or brain; but these
parts also are sometimes affected by external causes, such as certain
waters or a particular site or fatigue or constraint or similar reasons.
But* health is the harmonious mixture of the qualities.

5\. It is easier to guard against an enemy than against a friend.
