### 84. PRODICUS OF CEOS

<span class="smallcaps">Prodicus</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Ceos</span> lived in the latter half of the fifth
century B.C.

He wrote on correct terminology, and was credited with a book *On
Nature*, or *On the Nature of Man*. He also wrote exercises on set
themes, meant for display, one of which, The Choice of Heracles, was
paraphrased by Xenophon in the *Memorabilia*, and mentioned by Plato in
the *Symposium*.

1\. (<span class="smallcaps">Scholiast</span> on Aristophanes, Clouds:
*The book describing the Choice of Heracles is called 'Horae'*).

2\. (<span class="smallcaps">Xenophon</span>, *Memorabilia*, II.1.21:
*The Choice of Heracles. Heracles, having come to the time when the
young choose their way of life, is confronted by two women, Virtue and
Vice, who set before him the rival claims of the way of pleasure and the
way of honourable toil*).

3\. (*Title: 'On the Nature of Things'*).

4\. (<span class="smallcaps">Galen</span>: *Prodicus in his book 'On the
Nature of Man' called the heated and as it were overcooked element in
the bodily humours the 'phlegm', and the mucous discharge which is
universally named 'phlegm' he called 'blenna', slime'*).

5\. (*Things from which benefits to human life have been derived have
come to be considered deities, such as Demeter and Dionysus*).

6\. (*Sophists are*) on the borderline between the philosopher and the
statesman.

7\. Desire when doubled is love, love when doubled is madness.

*Doubtful*

8\. (<span class="smallcaps">Ps.-Plato</span>, *Eryxias* 397D: *Prodicus
said that things were good or bad according to their users, for example,
wealth*).

9\. (<span class="smallcaps">Ps.-Plato</span>, *Axiochus* 366B:
*Prodicus teaches nothing free*).

*Spurious*

10\. Fire is the best of the perfumes.

11\. Milk is best if one draw it actually from the female.
