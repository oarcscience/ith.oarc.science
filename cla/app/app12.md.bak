### 10. THE SEVEN SAGES

<span class="smallcaps">The Seven Sages</span> lived in the latter half
of the seventh, and the early sixth, centuries B.C.

The list of the Sages varies. Only four were universally agreed upon:
Thales, Bias, Pittacus, Solon. The earliest list, which adds Cleobulus,
Myson, Chilon, is given by Plato in the *Protagoras*.

They represented the practical wisdom of Greece. Many sayings were
attributed to them, of which the best-known are: 'Know thyself', and
'Nothing too much'; these they dedicated to Apollo at Delphi.
