### 3. EPIMENIDES OF CRETE

<span class="smallcaps">Epimenides of Crete</span> (Phaestos or
Cnossus): date uncertain, but he probably lived in the late sixth and
early fifth centuries B.C.

He was sometimes included in the list of the Seven Sages, in place of
Periander. A number of epic poems were ascribed to him, giving an Orphic
cosmogony; and a prose work on Cretan affairs, which was actually of
later date, but was used by Diodorus.

1\. (<span class="smallcaps">Paul</span>, *Epistle to Titus*, 1. 12:
*One of the Cretans, their own prophet, said of them*): The Cretans are
always liars, evil beasts, lazy stomachs. (*Clement says that Paul means
Epimenides, Jerome that it came from the Oracles of Epimenides*).

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

2\. (*From his Epic poems*): I too am of the race of the fair-tressed
moon, who with a dread shudder shook off the wild lion; and strangling
him in Nemea because of revered Hera, (*the divine strength of Heracles
overcame him*).

3\. (<span class="smallcaps">Aristotle</span>, *Politics* 12521):
*Epimenides calls members of the same household*) sharers of the smoke.

4\. (<span class="smallcaps">Aristotle</span>, *Rhetoric* 1418a;
*Epimenides gave his oracles not about the future, but on things in the
past which were obscure*).

5\. (<span class="smallcaps">Damascius</span>: *Epimenides gave the
first elements as Air and Night, from which were created Tartarus, from
which sprang two Titans; these having united produced the Egg, from
which again another generation sprang*).

6\. (<span class="smallcaps">Pausanias</span>: *Epimenides also makes
Styx the daughter of Ocean, and unites her not with Pallas but with an
unknown Peiras, to whom she bore Echidna*).

7\. (*Epimenides says that the Harpies are the children of Ocean, and
were slain near* (*Rhegium?*)).

8\. (*The story of Typho: in Epimenides’ version, Typho entered the
palace while Zeus was asleep; and Zeus killed him with a thunderbolt*).

9\. (*Epimenides agrees with certain others that the Harpies guard the
apples, but says that they are the same as the Hesperdes*).

10\. (<span class="smallcaps">Plutarch</span>: *Epimenides said of
Munychia that*) the Athenians would eat it up with their own teeth, if
they foresaw what harm it would do to the city.

11\. (<span class="smallcaps">Plutarch</span>: *Epimenides refuted the
story that eagles or swans setting out from the ends of the earth met in
the middle at Delphi, the so-called Omphalos*): There was no Omphalos,
either in the centre of the earth or of the sea. If any there be, it is
visible to the gods, not visible to mortals.

12\. (*Epimenides adds a fifth to the sons of Phrixus, Presbôn by
name*).

13\. (*Aiêtes was a Corinthian, and his mother was Ephyra*).

14\. (*Endymion in heaven fell in love with Hera, and Zeus condemned him
to eternal sleep*).

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

15\. (*Laius married Eurycleia daughter of Ecphas, and Oedipus was her
son*).

16\. (*The children of Zeus and Callistô were Pan and Areas, twins*).

17\. (*Epimenides and Hesiod agree on the names of the thirteen suitors
slain by Oenomaus*).

18\. (*Rhodes is the daughter of Ocean*).

19\. (*The Eumenides are the daughters of Cronos*): From him were born
fairhaired golden Aphrodite, the immortal Fates, and the Erinyes of
changeful gifts.

20\. (<span class="smallcaps">Diodorus</span>: '*I have followed the
most trustworthy authorities on Cretan affairs, Epimenides the
Theologian, Dosiades, Sosicrates and Laosthenes*').

21\. (<span class="smallcaps">Aratus</span>: '*Holy Goat, of whom the
story goes that she suckled Zeus, and the priest-interpreters of Zeus
call her Olenian*').

22\. (<span class="smallcaps">Aratus</span>: *The story that Cynosoura
and Helicê were placed in the heavens because they looked after Zeus in
the Idaean cave, when the Dictaean Kourêtês hid him from Cronos*).

23\. (*Cretan story that Zeus when hiding from Cronos changed himself
and his nurses into a serpent and bears respectively, and after he had
taken over the kingship, placed these forms in the Arctic Circle*).

24\. (*The story of Aigokerôs: honoured because he was a foster-brother
of Zeus, being with him in Crete when he fought the Titans. Aigokerôs is
believed to have discovered the horn, the sound of which put the Titans
to flight. He and his mother the Goat were placed in the heavens by
Zeus: because he found the horn in the sea, Aigokerôs has a fish-tail*).

25\. (*The Crown was a gift of Dionysus to Ariadnê; later he placed it
in the heavens*).

*Late forgery, drawn from Neo-Pythagoreanism*.

26\. (*The Dioscuri were male and female, one called Time, as being a
Monad, the other called Nature, as being a Dyad; for from the Monad and
the Dyad, all numbers which produce life and soul have sprung*).
