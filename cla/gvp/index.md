# The Golden Verses of Pythagoras

#### And Other Pythagorean Fragments

### Selected and Arranged by Florence M. Firth

##### With an Introduction by Annie Besant

###### \[1904\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This little collection of sayings, attributed to the Greek philosopher
and mathematician Pythagoras and his followers, embody what we know
about his teachings today. Besides exhortations to live a moral, simple
and contemplative life, these pithy aphorisms allow a glimpse of a bit
of the Pythagorean schools' deeper knowledge.

[A detailed study of the Golden Verses](../ogv/index.md) by the French
esoteric writer Fabre d'Olivet is also available at this site.
