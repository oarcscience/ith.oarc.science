THE knowledge possessed by European scholars a generation ago regarding
pre-Hellenic civilization was of slight and doubtful character.
Histories of Greece devoted small space to the Heroic Age. These usually
began by stating that Greece was so called by the Romans, that it had
been anciently known as Hellas and embraced several States--Attica,
Arcadia, Achæa, Bœotia, &c.--and that the term Hellas had wider
significance than was attached to it in modern times, having been used
to denote the country of the Hellenes wherever they might happen to be
settled, so that Cyrene in North Africa and Miletus in Asia Minor, for
instance, were as essentially parts of Hellas as Arcadia or Bœotia. It
was also recognized that the Hellenes were not the earliest inhabitants

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

of Greece proper. Before these invaders entered into possession of the
country it had been divided between various "barbarous tribes",
including the Pelasgi and their congeners the Caucones and Leleges.
Thirlwall, among others, expressed the view "that the name Pelasgians
was a general one, like that of Saxons, Franks, or Alemanni, and that
each of the Pelasgian tribes had also one peculiar to itself". The
Hellenes did not exterminate the aborigines, but constituted a military
aristocracy. Aristotle was quoted to show that their original seat was
near Dodona, in Epirus, and that they first appeared in Thessaly about
1384 B.C. It was believed that the Hellenic conquerors laid the
foundation of Greek civilization.

Grote, on the other hand, declined to accept the theory that the
Pelasgians constituted the sole indigenous element in Greece. "In going
through historical Greece", he said, "we are compelled to accept the
Hellenic aggregate with its constituent elements as a primary fact to
start from. . . . By what circumstances, or out of what pre-existing
elements, the aggregate was brought together and modified, we find no
evidence entitled to credit. There are, indeed, various names affirmed
to designate the ante-Hellenic inhabitants of many parts of Greece--the
Pelasgi, the Leleges, the Kuretes, the Kaukones, the Aones, the
Temmikes, the Hyantes, the Telchines, the Bœotian Thracians, the
Teleboæ, the Ephyri, the Phlegyæ, &c. These are names belonging to
legendary, not to historical Greece-extracted out of a variety of
conflicting legends by the logographers and subsequent historians, who
strung together out of them a supposed history of the past, at a time
when the conditions of historical evidence were very little understood.
That these names designated real nations may be true but here our
knowledge

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

ends. We have no well-informed witness to tell us of their times, their
limits of residence, their acts, or their character; nor do we know how
far they are identical with or diverse from the historical Hellenes,
whom we are warranted in calling, not the first inhabitants of the
country, but the first known to us upon any tolerable evidence." The
attitude assumed by this cautious historian regarding the Pelasgians is
still defensible in these days when different archæologists apply the
term in different ways, one holding, for instance, that the Pelasgians
were the Ægeans of Mediterranean race, and another that they were a late
"wave" of pre-Hellenic conquerors. Grote insisted that all Herodotus
knew about the Pelasgians was that they occupied a few scattered and
inconsiderable townships in historical Greece and spoke a barbarous
language. <span id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102.md) He pointed out, however,
that our term "barbarian" does not express the same idea as the Hellenic
word, "which involved associations of repugnance", although derived from
it. "The Greeks", he explained, "spoke indiscriminately of the
extra-Hellenic world with all its inhabitants whatever might be the
gentleness of their character and whatever might be their degree of
civilization". All non-Hellenes were, as the Chinese put it, "foreign
devils".

Historians who were more inclined than Grote to attach weight to
folk-traditions were yet unable to gather much from those of the
Hellenes regarding their origin, except that they professed to have come
from "the East" and claimed to be descendants of an eponymous ancestor
called Hellen. The story of this patriarch and his family is given in
the Hesiodic version of the World's Ages myth. When Zeus resolved to
destroy the wicked Bronze Race by sending a great flood, he spared
Deucalion and his wife

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pyrrha, who took
refuge in an ark. According to one tradition, this couple, on praying to
Zeus, were enabled to repeople the devastated world by throwing over
their shoulders stones which were transformed into human beings. These
were "the Stone Folk". Another tradition made Deucalion the ancestor of
the whole Greek race, through his son Hellen, who had three children,
named Dorus and Æolus, the ancestors of the Dorians and Æolians, and
Xuthus, whose sons Achæus and Ion, were the progenitors of the Achæans
and Ionians.

The period that elapsed between the early settlement of the Hellenes and
the siege of Troy was called the Heroic Age, after the fourth Hesiodic
Age of the World, or the Homeric Age, during which the civilization
depicted in those great epics the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey* had full
development.

Historians parted company when they came to deal with the prehistoric
period. Thirlwall was inclined to sift historical matter from the
legends. Grote, however, was frankly sceptical. "That which I note as
Terra Incognita", he said, "is in his (Thirlwall's) view a land which
may be known up to a certain point, but the map which he draws of it
contains so few ascertained places as to differ very little from
absolute vacuity." <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103.md) Dealing with
the Trojan war, he declared that, "though literally believed,
reverentially cherished, and numbered among the gigantic phenomena of
the past by the Grecian public, it is in the eyes of modern enquiry
essentially a legend and nothing more". His answer to the question as to
whether the war ever took place was: "As the possibility of it cannot be
denied, so neither can the reality of it be affirmed". <span
id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_104.md) We who are "wise after the event" may
rail at Grote, but it must be remembered that he wrote at

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

a time when little was known regarding ancient Egypt, Babylonia, and
Assyria, except what could be derived from classical writers and
Biblical references. He, however, recognized that the myths had a
psychological if not a historical value when he wrote: "Two courses, and
two only, are open: either to pass over the myths altogether, which is
the way in which modern historians treat the old British fables, or else
to give an account of them as myths; to recognize and respect their
specific nature, and to abstain from confounding them with ordinary and
certifiable history. There are good reasons for pursuing the second
method in reference to the Grecian myths, and when so considered they
constitute an important chapter in the history of the Grecian mind, and,
indeed, in that of the human race generally." <span
id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105.md) He did not agree with those, however,
who believed that the Homeric picture of life was wholly fictitious.
Indeed, he drew, like others, upon the epics for evidence regarding
customs and manners of life in early Greek times, although he held they
contained "no historical facts".

It was generally recognized that the petty states of Greece were ruled
over by hereditary chiefs, whose power was limited by a military
aristocracy. "Piracy was an honourable occupation," as one writer put
it, "and war the delight of noble souls." Some historians added, on the
authority of Thucydides, <span id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_106.md) that the
commencement of Grecian civilization might be dated from the reign of
King Minos of Crete, who had cleared the Ægean Sea of pirates. Grote
could not, on the other hand, believe that the Minos legends had any
historical value. "Here we have", he wrote, "conjectures derived from
the analogy of the Athenian maritime empire of historical times,
substituted

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

in place of the fabulous incidents and attached to the name of
Minos." <span id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_107.md)

It should not surprise us that the so-called "doubting Thomases" among
the historians hesitated to make use of myths and legends. Grote held
that if he were to proceed with a view to detect a historical base in
the stories of Troy and Thebes, he would be compelled to deal similarly
with the myths of "Zeus in Crete, of Apollo and Artemis in Delos, of
Hermes and of Prometheus". If Achilles was to be taken seriously,
although he was of supernatural origin, what of Bellerophon, Perseus,
Theseus, and Hercules? These would also have to be "handled
objectively".

In time the exponents of the new science of Comparative Mythology, which
at its inception was based chiefly on philological evidence, attracted
much attention and impressed not a few serious students of classical
history with their theory that classical legends were renderings of
immemorial religious myths, the gods and goddesses having been
transformed into human heroes and heroines. "In Greek mythology", it was
contended, "each different aspect of nature had many different names,
because a few simple elements crystallized into many different forms.
This is why there are so many gods and goddesses." As much may be
granted, although, as is now believed, the view is somewhat narrow. But
when the theory was given practical application it led to rather too
sweeping conclusions of rather fanciful character. "Zeus", wrote one
authority, "is married to many different wives. The bright sky must look
down on many lands. His visits to different countries are thus
explained. . . . Achilles is child of the sea-goddess; so the sun often
appears to rise out of the water. His bride is torn from him, and he

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

sulks in his tent; so the sun must leave the dawn and be hidden by dark
clouds. He lends his armour to Patroclus except the spear; none other
can wield the spear of Achilles: so no other can equal the power of the
sun's rays." And so on until the absurdity concluded with: "Achilles
tramples on the dead body of Hector, but Hector is of dark powers,
though noble in himself; so a blazing sunset tramples down the darkness.
Finally, Achilles is slain by an arrow from a Trojan. He is vulnerable
only in the heel, but the arrow finds him there. So the sun is conquered
by the darkness in his turn, and disappears, a short-lived brilliant
thing."

The hero of the *Odyssey* met a similar fate. "Odysseus is the sun in
another character, as a wanderer, and his adventures describe the
general phenomena of daytime from the rising to the setting of the sun.
. . . His journey is full of strange changes, of happiness and misery,
successes and reverses, like the lights and shadows of a gloomy day."

The *Iliad*, as a narrative, was regarded with contempt. "There is
nothing noble or elevated in the gods or heroes", remarked one
solar-symbolist, who referred to himself as "one of the advanced
thinkers". "Everyone knows", he went on, with unconscious humour, "that
the *Iliad* is a poem which tells two stories: of a war between the
Greeks and Trojans to recover a Grecian woman named Helen, who had run
away from her lawful husband with a Trojan hero named Paris, and carried
a great treasure with her; also of the anger of Achilles, a Grecian
hero, and the dreadful consequences it brought upon the Grecian army
encamped upon the plains around Troy." A physical explanation of this
"petty legend" had to be sought for. Professor Max Müller declared: "The
siege of Troy is a repetition of the daily siege of the East by the
solar powers that are robbed of their

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

brightest treasures in the West". One of his critics and followers, Mr.
Cox, remarked with much justification that this was "not quite plain",
but he only added to the confusion by urging a new hypothesis. "Few will
venture to deny", he remarked, with the characteristic confidence of the
theorist, "that the stealing of the bright clouds of sunset by the dark
powers of night, the weary search for them through the long night, the
battle with the robbers, as the darkness is driven away by the advancing
chariot of the lord of light, are favourite subjects with the Vedic
poets." So was Greece robbed of its heroes and Troy swept out of
existence. "If such a war took place", Mr. Cox argued, "it must be
carried back to a time preceding the dispersion of the Aryan tribes from
their original home."

But while these and other examples of what Mr. Andrew Lang has
characterized as "scholarly stupidity" impressed not a few prominent
men, a small band of students strenuously declined to regard the Homeric
legends as products of traditional myths "based on the various phenomena
of the earth and heavens". One of these was the self-educated merchant,
Henry Schliemann, whose faith in Homer led him to make discoveries which
have thrown a flood of light on early Ægean civilization, and
incidentally shattered forever the theories of the solar mythologists.
"The Trojan War," he wrote in 1878, "has for a long time past been
regarded by many eminent scholars as a myth, of which however they
vainly endeavoured to find the origin in the Vedas. But in all antiquity
the siege and conquest of Ilium by the Greek army under Agamemnon was
considered as an undoubted historical fact, and as such it is accepted
by the great authority of Thucydides. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108.md) The tradition has

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

even retained the memory of many details of that war which have been
omitted by Homer. For my part, I have always firmly believed in the
Trojan War; my full faith in Homer and in the tradition has never been
shaken by modern criticism, and to this faith of mine I am indebted for
the discovery of Troy and its treasure." <span
id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md)

The story of Heinrich Schliemann's life is a fitting prelude to an
account of his epoch-making discoveries in Asia Minor and Greece which
"led up", as Mr. Hawes says, "to the revelations in Crete from 1900
onwards". He was born on 6th January, 1822, in the little German town of
Neu Buckow, in the duchy of Mecklenberg-Schwerin, and was scarcely
twelve months old when his father, a Protestant clergyman, removed to
Ankershagen, near Waren. At this village the future archæologist, who
was a precocious child, received impressions before he was ten years old
which influenced his whole life and prompted him to achieve renown as a
pioneer in the domain of pre-Hellenic research. Ankershagen was
enveloped in an old-world atmosphere; it was indeed an ideal "homeland",
with its antiquities, legends, and superstitions, for one of Heinrich
Schliemann's temperament and mental leanings. The summer-house in the
manse garden was reputed to be haunted by the ghost of his father's
predecessor, Pastor von Russdorf, and near at hand was a small pond out
of which each night at the stroke of twelve a spirit maid was believed
to rise up, grasping a silver cup in her hand. In the village a
ditch-surrounded mound--one of the kind called a Hunengrab, or "Hun's
grave"--had attached to it a story about a great robber who buried in it
his favourite child in a golden cradle. Legends of similar character are
told regarding "giants' graves" in these islands. Treasure was also said
to lie concealed

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

under a round tower in the local land-proprietor's garden. "My faith in
these treasures was so great", Schliemann wrote in after years, "that
whenever I heard my father complain of his poverty, I expressed my
astonishment that he did not dig up the silver bowl or the golden cradle
and so become rich." <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md)

An ancient castle also made a strong appeal to the boy's imagination. It
was supposed to have the usual long underground passage leading to
somewhere, and to be visited nightly by awesome spectres. At one time,
the legend ran, it was the abode of a notorious robber knight, Henning
Bradenkirl, who buried his treasure and committed suicide when,
revelation having been made of his designs on the life of the Duke of
Mecklenberg, his stronghold was besieged by that great nobleman. Henning
found no rest in his grave, and it was whispered among the young folks
that time and again he had thrust out one of his legs with purpose
apparently to visit the spot where his hoard was concealed. "I often
begged my father", Schliemann has told, "to excavate the tomb, in order
to see why the foot no longer grew out." This belief that there was a
kernel of truth in ancient legends caused him ultimately to search for
traces of ancient Troy, and open the graves of heroes who, according to
classic narratives, had been buried with their armour and rich
ornaments. "My firm faith in the traditions", he wrote in 1877, "made me
undertake my late excavations in the Acropolis (of Mycenæ) and led to
the discovery of the five tombs, with their immense treasures." <span
id="fr_111"></span>[2](#fn_111.md) So the boy was "father of the man".

The impecunious clergyman of Ankershagen cast over the mind of his son,
Heinrich, the romantic glamour of classic myth and legend. The nursery
stories he related

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

were not of elves and giants, but of the last days of Pompeii and
Herculaneum, which were then being excavated and greatly talked about,
and of the great deeds of Homer's heroes on the windy plain of Troy.

It was a memorable day in Heinrich's life when he received as a
Christmas present, in his eighth year, an illustrated child's history of
the world-one of those popular works which stimulate young minds with
the desire to acquire knowledge. An engraving depicted the last scene in
the siege of Troy. The "topless towers of Ilium" were wrapped in flames,
and amidst the smoke and confusion the wounded warrior Æneas was seen
taking flight, carrying his father Anchises on his broad back, and
leading by the hand his son Ascanius. From that hour the spectacle of
mighty Troy haunted the mind of the little German boy, and the Trojan
War became as familiar to him as if it had been waged on the village
green and Ankershagen, instead of Troy, had been sacked.

Heinrich failed in his attempts to impress his boy friends with glowing
versions of Homer's narrative, but he infected with his enthusiasm the
minds of two girl companions. One of these, Minna Meincke, a farmer's
daughter, promised to marry him when she grew up, and assist him to
discover the Hun robber's golden cradle, the silver cup of the pond
nymph, the treasure concealed by Henning, and to accompany him to the
land of dreams to explore the ruins of ancient Troy. Strange to relate,
half a century afterwards, not Minna, but another who became Mrs. Henry
Schliemann, actually did help her husband in his famous excavations, and
one of the results of their joint labours was the finding of the most
valuable treasure any archæologists have ever had the luck to uncover.

Heinrich's father intended to give him a classical

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

education, but fell into financial difficulties, with the result that
when the boy was fourteen he became apprenticed to a village grocer. At
nineteen he injured himself when lifting a heavy cask, and went to
Hamburg, where he secured a situation as a cabin-boy on a brig bound for
Venezuela. The vessel however, was wrecked on a sand-bank off the Island
of Texel during stormy weather, but fortunately the crew escaped in a
small boat. Heinrich afterwards secured a situation at a Hamburg
warehouse. Having a good deal of leisure time at his disposal, he
studied languages with so much success that he acquired a wonderful
knowledge of Dutch, English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese.

At twenty-four he was employed by the firm of B. H. Schroder & Co., and,
having by this time obtained a knowledge of Russian, he was sent to St.
Petersburg. He prospered there and began to trade on his own account,
dealing chiefly in indigo. At forty he found himself a millionaire. Ere
he retired, however, he studied modern and ancient Greek and Latin under
Professor Ludgwig von Muralt.

Having wound up his affairs, he began to travel extensively. For several
months he resided in China and Japan, and wrote on his return his first
book *La Chine et Le Japon*, which was published at Paris, where he
settled down to study archæology. The time was drawing nigh when he
could visit the scenes of Homeric glory, and make search for traces of
ancient Troy and the graves containing treasure. He was resolved to
realize the dream of his boyhood, which he had treasured during the
years so full of business anxieties and cares. "Father," he had once
said, when his childish eyes were fascinated by the engraving of Troy,
"if such walls once existed, they cannot possibly have been completely
destroyed;

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

vast ruins of them must still remain, but they are hidden beneath the
dust of ages." His father had shaken his head, but, to pleasure the lad,
admitted that it was possible, and then agreed that when they were able
to do so they would both search for and excavate the ruins of the famous
city.

In 1868 Schliemann paid his first visit to the scenes of his future
triumphs and wrote a book entitled *Ithaca, the Peloponnesus, and Troy*,
in which he ran counter to the theories of those contemporary scholars
who believed that Troy had existed, by locating its site, not on an
inland summit near Bunarbashi, but farther north and near the seashore
on the top of the hillock of Hissarlik. He also announced where he
believed the graves of the Atreidæ at Mycenæ could be located. For this
original treatise he received his doctor's degree at Rostock.

In the spring of 1870 Dr. Schliemann put his theories to the test by
beginning to dig at Hissarlik. At the depth of 16 feet the first wall
was laid bare, and he was then fully convinced that success would crown
his efforts. Accordingly he made preparations for excavation work on an
extensive scale. The Turkish authorities hampered him greatly, however,
and it was not until late in the following year that he could proceed
with the work. In the following year a great depth had been reached, but
although a broad trench laid bare a series of walls and a fine piece of
Greek sculpture, no definite conclusions could be reached from the
results, promising and suggestive as these were. Work was resumed early
in 1873, when the weather was so cold that "of an evening", wrote Dr.
Schliemann, "we had nothing to keep us warm except an enthusiasm for
discovering Troy". The weeks went past, and at length Fortune smiled and
the dreams of boyhood began to find rich

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

realization. One day, during the dinner hour, when no workmen were near,
Dr. Schliemann and his wife discovered a treasure hoard of gold and
diadems and daggers, silver jars and copper vessels and weapons, which
they hurriedly carried off and concealed. Its mere monetary value was
not far short of £ 1000. During the winter Dr. Schliemann wrote an
account of his discoveries which was published in book form under the
title *Trojan Antiquities*. He had cut through several successive towns
on the hillock of Hissarlik. The second city from the bottom was named
by him "Homer's Troy"; he called its largest building "Priam's Palace",
and the hoard he had discovered with his wife, "Priam's Treasure". Most
archæologists now believe, however, that the sixth city, which was much
more extensive than the second, was the capital celebrated by Homer.

Schliemann's theories were ridiculed by the "authorities" in every
country in Europe. He was a "rank outsider" and regarded with suspicion
by the theorists who were convinced that Troy could not possibly have
been situated at Hissarlik. Comic papers made fun of him as a dreamer of
vain dreams, but a few open-minded scholars were profoundly impressed
and anxious for more information. Schliemann was not discouraged either
by learned criticism or superficial ridicule. What concerned him most
was the attitude assumed by the Turkish Government, which was not
entirely free from the suspicion or blackmailing propensities.
Operations at Hissarlik had to be suspended, but the undaunted pioneer
did not waste his time. He turned his back upon Troy and was led to
Mycenæ, in Greek territory, by the ghost of Agamemnon. There and at
Tiryns his excavations resulted in the discovery of traces of a culture
similar to that found in the sixth city at Hissarlik. The results of
this archæological

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "campaign", which
was carried on during 1876-7, were published in *Mycenæ* in 1878. A
preface contributed by the late Mr. W. E. Gladstone contains several
passages which reflect the interest which was aroused throughout Europe
at the time by Schliemann's work. "When the disclosures at Tiryns and
Mycenæ were announced in England," wrote Mr. Gladstone, "my own first
impression was that of a strangely bewildered admiration, combined with
a preponderance of sceptical against believing tendencies, in regard to
the capital and dominating subject of the Tombs in the Agora. I am bound
to say that reflection and fuller knowledge have nearly turned the
scales the other way. . . . I find, upon perusing the volume of Dr.
Schliemann, that the items of evidence, which connect his discoveries
generally with the Homeric poems, are more numerous than I had surmised
from the brief outline with which he favoured us upon his visit to
England in the spring." <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md)

Tiryns, now called Palæocastron, was, according to Pausanias, named
after Tiryns, a son of Argos. It was the reputed birthplace of Hercules,
and famed for its Cyclopean walls. "The circuit wall," wrote Pausanias,
"which is the only remaining ruin, was built by the Cyclopes. It is
composed of unwrought stones, each of which is so large that a team of
mules cannot even shake the smallest one: small stones have been
interposed in order to consolidate the large blocks." <span
id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_113.md)

Mycenæ was also reputed to have been built by these giant artisans, who
numbered seven, and came from Lycia. It was probably on account of this
legend that, as Schliemann suggested, the whole of the Argolis was
referred to by Euripides as "Cyclopean land". Similarly, many ruins in
Asia Minor and Mesopotamia were credited

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

by tradition to Semiramis, while the Egyptian Sesostris was supposed to
have erected gigantic works in various localities. This habit of
accounting for ancient remains as the handiwork of mythical and
semi-mythical persons was of great antiquity and widespread character.
Fairies and elves and giants were supposed to have erected dolmens and
stone circles. Gaelic-speaking people in Lewis at the present day, for
instance, refer to the standing stones at Callernish as *Tursachan*, a
name which has been derived from the Norse word *Thurs*, a giant or
goblin. In Cumberland another circle is associated with the memory of
the mythical giantesses "Long Meg and her daughters". Several
promontories in different localities have been credited likewise to
fairy artisans who were endeavouring to bridge over an arm of the sea.
Thor, according to the Teutonic wonder-tales, formed valleys by smiting
a mountain range with his great hammer, while the "Flint Hills" were
formed by the fragments he shattered from the great flint boulder flung
towards him by a giant enemy. In Scotland numerous hillocks are referred
to as spillings from the creel of the giantess (Cailleach) who erected
mountain houses for her children. This custom of attributing not only
hills, but also buildings, to supernatural agencies has survived even
into Christian times. Not a few ruins of early chapels in these islands
have still associated with them folk-tales about fairy builders, who
accomplished their work in a single night.

Schliemann did not attach historical importance to the legends of
Hercules, who was reputed to have held sway at Tiryns for a prolonged
period. Indeed, like Max Müller, he was inclined to regard the famous
folk-hero as a sun-god. But he was convinced that the Cyclopean walls
were of great antiquity, and engaged in systematic

 

<span id="img_08800"></span> ![](img/08800.jpg)

THE LION GATE, MYCENÆ

 

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

excavations with purpose to obtain evidence which would connect the
civilization of Tiryns with that of his Homeric Troy. He found a number
of terra-cotta female idols, with exaggerated breasts, and terra-cotta
cows, which had evidently a religious significance. These he connected
with the goddess Hera. Examples of primitive pottery were also brought
to light, including hand-polished black vases and bulky jars. When he
reached the prehistoric strata he collected obsidian knives, whorls of
blue and green stone, &c. In some places he found the remains of walls
built on the rock and of water conduits of rough unhewn stones. The
stones of the ancient Cyclopean wall measured about 7 feet long and 3
feet thick in most cases, but some were of even greater dimensions.

At Mycenæ, "situated in the depth of the horse-feeding Argos", as Homer
sang, <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md) Schliemann's early
researches were more productive. Here he set out to prove his theory
that the graves of the Atreidæ were situated not outside but inside the
citadel wall. He found that the wall revealed three different methods of
construction, which he assigned to three separate periods. These are the
Cyclopean, in which large boulders were secured by small blocks; the
Polygonal, with accurately hewn joints; and the Rectangular, in which
the blocks were "dovetailed".

In the north-west corner he cleared the famous "Lion's Gate". It
measured 10 feet 8 inches in height, and was 9 feet 6 inches wide at the
top, and 10 feet 3 inches at the bottom. The great lintel, which excited
admiration, was found to be 15 feet long and 8 feet broad. At this point
the wall, constructed on the Rectangular system, is composed of stones 6
and 7 feet in length, many of which

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

are notched to fit into the corners, or jutting points, hewed in others.
This system of rough "dovetailing" is characteristic of Hittite
buildings. The Euphrates River wall at Carchemish, the oldest known
engineering construction in the world, which has been utilized by the
engineers in connection with a "Bagdad railway" bridge at this point, is
a characteristic example of the Rectangular style of architecture.

Above the great lintel of the principal entrance to the Acropolis of
Mycenæ lies the great limestone slab sculptured in relief, on which two
lions rampant, heraldically opposed, rest their forepaws on the "altar"
with its shapely pillar "crowned by a curious capital, composed of a
fillet, moulding, roll, and abacus". Similar lion and pillar groups have
been found by Professor Ramsay in Phrygia. In one instance the goddess
Cybele takes the place of the pillar. "The idea of the lions as
guardians of the gate arose", Professor Ramsay considers, "in a country
where Cybele was worshipped, and where the dead chief was believed to be
gathered to his mother, the goddess. . . . The Phrygians adapted an old
heraldic type to represent the idea. . . . In the interchange of
artistic forms and improvements in civilization which obtained between
Phrygia and the Greeks, the lion type passed into Mycenæ during the
ninth, or more probably the eighth century B.C." <span

Schliemann's guide to Mycenæ was Pausanias, who wrote <span
id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_116.md): "Amongst other remains of the wall is
the gate on which stand lions. They (the walls and the gate) are said to
be the work of the Cyclopes, who built the wall for Proteus at Tiryns.
In the ruins of Mycenæ is the fountain called Perseia, and the
subterranean buildings of

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Atreus and his
children, in which they stored their treasures. There is the sepulchre
of Atreus, and the tombs of the companions of Agamemnon, who on their
return from Ilium were killed at a banquet by Ægisthus. The identity of
the tomb of Cassandra is called in question by the Lacedæmonians of
Amyclæ. There is the tomb of Agamemnon and that of his charioteer
Eurymedon, and of Electra. Teledamus and Pelops were buried in the same
sepulchre, for it is said that Cassandra bore these twins, and that,
while as yet infants, they were slaughtered by Ægisthus together with
their parents. Hellanicus (495-411 B.C.) writes that Pylades, who was
married to Electra with the consent of Orestes, had by her two sons,
Medon and Strophius. Clytemnestra and Ægisthus were buried at a little
distance from the wall, because they were thought unworthy to have their
tombs inside of it, where Agamemnon reposed and those who were killed
together with him."

This passage had been misinterpreted by certain writers, and Schliemann
insisted, before he began to dig, that the wall referred to was not the
city wall, as they believed, but the wall of the Acropolis. The city,
besides, he argued, was in ruins in Pausanias's day (170 A.D.), and he
might not have seen the remnants of the smaller city wall. Schliemann
put his theory to proof by sinking a number of shafts, and then
undertaking extensive excavations. When he had cleared away the debris
from the Lion's Gate, some of which had been cast there when the Argives
captured the Acropolis in the fifth century B.C., he found evidence that
the city had been partially reoccupied after its fall, although Diodorus
Siculus <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md) and Strabo <span
id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_118.md) had made statements to the contrary.

Schliemann penetrated to the lower and earlier city of

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mycenæ and there
made discovery of great "beehive tombs", which were the "Treasuries" of
Pausanias.

Schliemann excavated also five shaft tombs, and believed they were those
of Agamemnon and his companions, who on their return from Troy were
murdered by Clytemnestra and her paramour Ægisthus. They were of similar
construction, and the burials appeared to him to have been simultaneous.
"The five tombs of Mycenæ, or, at least, three of them," he wrote,
"contained such enormous treasuries that they cannot but have belonged
to members of the royal family." Thousands of pounds worth of antique
valuables were discovered in these mysterious underground chambers.

An immense impression was made all over Europe on the publication of the
following characteristic telegram which Schliemann dispatched to the
King of Greece, announcing his great discovery.

"MYCENÆ, 16*th* (28*th*) *November*, 1876.

"With extreme joy I announce to Your Majesty that I have discovered the
tombs which tradition, as echoed by Pausanias, designates as the
sepulchre of Agamemnon, of Cassandra, of Eurymadon and their companions
and their comrades, all slain during the repast by Clytemnestra and her
lover Ægisthus. These tombs were surrounded by a double parallel circle
of plaques, which can only have been erected in the honour of great
personages. I have found in the sepulchres immense treasures in the way
of archaic objects of pure gold. These treasures of themselves are
enough to fill a large museum which shall be the most marvellous in the
world, and which during centuries to come will draw to Greece thousands
of visitors from every country. As I work purely for the love of
science, I make naturally no claim to these treasures,

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

which I give with the liveliest enthusiasm intact to Greece. May it be
God's will that these treasures will become the corner stone of an
immense national wealth.

"HEINRICH SCHLIEMANN."

It is not believed nowadays that Schliemann located the tombs of
Agamemnon and his followers, but happened instead on those of royal
personages who flourished in a different age. The authority of Pausanias
is not sufficient to settle the problem. When that distinguished writer
visited the ruins of Mycenæ over a thousand years had elapsed since Troy
had fallen. Agamemnon bulked prominently in folk-imagination, and was
identified with the memorials of forgotten rulers. The process involved
is a familiar one. In our own country King Arthur has similarly had
attached to his memory the deeds of mythical beings who dwelt in
Fairyland or selected high hills as their seats, while in the Highlands
as recent a hero as Prince Charlie has been associated with
hiding-places, in districts he never visited, as far north as Caithness.

But Schliemann's confident statement regarding the "tomb of Agamemnon"
need not detract from the value of the services he has rendered to
archæology. In making search for traces of the heroes of his boyhood he
achieved well-deserved renown as the pioneer who "opened to us the door
into one of the sealed chambers of the past". He has caused early Greek
history to be rewritten, and it is due to his example and triumphs that
it is now possible to present a partial reconstruction of several
thousand years of Ægean civilization.

It is indirectly to Schliemann, too, that we owe the late Mr. Andrew
Lang's famous sonnet on Homeric Unity.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

The sacred keep of Ilion is rent  
By shaft and pit; foiled waters wander slow  
Through plains where Simois and Scamander went  
To war with gods and heroes long ago.  
Not yet to tired Cassandra, lying low  
In rich Mycenæ, do the Fates relent:  
The bones of Agamemnon are a show,  
And ruined is his royal monument.

The dust and awful treasures of the Dead,  
Hath Learning scattered wide, but vainly thee,  
Homer, she meteth with her tool of lead,  
And strives to rend thy songs; too blind to see  
The crown that burns on thine immortal head  
Of indivisible supremacy.

Flushed with his Mycenæan successes, Schliemann was ready to return to
Troy in the summer of 1878. But his difficulties with the Turkish
officials delayed him. These, however, were overcome on his behalf by
another famous explorer, Sir Austen Henry Layard, of Assyrian fame, who
happened to be at the time British Ambassador at Constantinople. "I
fulfil a most agreeable duty", Schliemann wrote in his *Ilios*, "in now
thanking his Excellency publicly and most cordially for all the services
he has rendered me, without which I could never have brought my work to
a close."

While waiting for his firman from the Turkish Government, Schliemann
began operations on the Island of Ithaca, and discovered on Mount Ætos a
king's palace and nearly two hundred houses of Cyclopean construction.
Then he proceeded to Troy, where he was hampered for a time by a Turkish
commissioner. In the following year Professor Virchow joined him, and he
received visits also from other scholars of repute. In 18 80 he
published his great work *Ilios*, Dr. Dörpfeld joined him in 1882,

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

and together they operated chiefly in the city which has now been
identified with Homer's Troy. In 1884 the results of later exploration
were recorded in Schliemann's *Troja*, to which a preface was
contributed by Professor Sayce. The tireless excavator then resumed
operations at Tiryns, where an ancient palace was discovered. The work
was continued here in the following year by Dr. Dörpfeld, who wrote
several chapters in Schliemann's next book, to which a preface was
contributed by Professor F. Adler.

Schliemann next turned attention to Egypt, where he excavated with
Virchow with much success, and he desired also to operate in Crete, on
Knossos Hill, but the political conditions on the island made systematic
archæological work in that quarter an impossibility, while the Turkish
Government showed no enthusiasm regarding his proposal. It was not
considered desirable that the islanders should be reminded of the
greatness of their ancestors. He had therefore to abandon his scheme to
make search in Crete for "the original home of Mycenæan civilization."

In 1890 Dr. C. Schuchardt, Director of the Kestner Museum, in Hanover,
published his critical work on Schliemann's excavations, in which he
wrote: "Dr. Schliemann is now in his sixty-ninth year, but his activity
and love of enterprise show no signs of decay. We may still look to him
for many additions to science, and we hope to thank him for disclosing
the heroic age of Greece in the periods of its prime and of its
decadence, which may perhaps be found in Crete, the land of
Minos." <span id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119.md)

On 26th December in the same year, however, Schliemann expired suddenly
in Naples. His body was taken to Athens and buried in the Greek cemetery
near the

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ilissos, a lofty
monument being erected to his memory. "He lies", writes Mr. Sellers, "in
the land he loved so well; but the example of noble ambition and patient
research which he set before the world will long abide as a living
spirit, not only among archæologists, but among all who anywhere in the
civilized world have caught something of his devotion and enthusiasm for
classical learning and antiquity."

Among the honours conferred upon the great man during the closing years
of his life was the degree of D.C.L. of Oxford and the fellowship of
Queen's College. The Royal Institute of British Architects awarded him a
gold medal, in which he took great pride. It is of interest to note that
he was a naturalized American citizen.
