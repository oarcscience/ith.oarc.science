THE system which obtains among modern scientists, of dividing the
history of the earth into geological epochs and the pre-history of man
into cultural periods, was anticipated by the priestly theorists of
ancient civilizations, who established the doctrine of the mythical Ages
of the World. These early teachers were:, no doubt, as greatly concerned
about justifying their own pretensions and the tenets of their cults as
in gratifying the growing thirst for knowledge among the educated
classes. When they

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

undertook to reveal the process of creation and throw light on the
origin and purpose of mankind, they exalted local deities in opposition
to those regarded supreme at rival centres of culture and political
influence. Many rival systems of a national religion were thus
perpetuated. But the various city priesthoods of a particular country
found it necessary to deal also with problems of common concern. Among
other things, they had to account for the various races of whom they had
knowledge and to give divine sanction to existing social conditions; nor
could they overlook the accidental discoveries which were occasionally
made of the relics of elder and unknown peoples and the bones of extinct
animals.

These mythology-makers, of course, possessed but meagre knowledge of
their country's past, and were accordingly compelled to draw freely upon
their imaginations; but they should not be regarded on that account as
merely dreamers of dreams and inventors of miraculous stories.
Indications are forthcoming which show that they were not wholly devoid
of the scientific spirit. They were close observers of natural
phenomena, and sometimes made deductions which, considering the
narrowness of areas available to them for investigation, were not
unworthy of thinking men. It seemed perfectly reasonable to the
Babylonian and Egyptian scientists, who saw land growing from
accumulations of river-borne silt, and desert wastes rendered cultivable
by irrigation, to conclude, for instance, that water was the primary
element and the source of all that existed.

This doctrine, which holds that the Universe is derived from one
particular form of matter, has been called "Materialistic Monism".
Ultimately, when mind was exalted above matter, the belief obtained that
the inanimate forces of nature were subject to the control of

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

the supreme Mind, which was the First Cause. This later doctrine is
known as "Idealistic Monism". It was embraced by various cults in
Babylonia, India, and Egypt. In the latter country, for instance, the
great god of Memphis was addressed:

Ptah, the great, is the mind and tongue of the gods. . . .  
It (the mind) is the one which bringeth forth every successful issue. .
. .  
It was the fashioner of all gods.  
At a time when every divine word  
Came into existence by the thought of the mind  
And the command of the tongue. <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md)

In Egypt and Babylonia, where inundations of river valleys were of
periodic occurrence, and where, at rare intervals, floods of excessive
volume caused great destruction and loss of life, and even brought about
political changes, it was concluded that the old Ages were ended and new
Ages inaugurated by world-devastating deluges.

The deductions of the early scientists in northern Europe were similarly
drawn from the evidence afforded by environment, and similarly
influenced by persistent modes of thought. They saw shoals formed and
beaches overlaid by sand washed up by the sea from, as it appeared, some
sand-creating source, and conceived that on the floor of ocean there
stood a great "World Mill" propelled by giantesses, which ground the
bodies of primeval world-giants into earth meal. "'Tis said", a saga
author set forth, "that far out, off yonder ness, the Nine Maids of the
Island mill stir amain the host-cruel skerry-quern--they who in ages
past ground Hamlet's meal. The good chieftain furrows the hull's lair
with his ship's beaked prow." <span id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41.md)

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

In the *Elder Edda* the god of the mill, who appears to be identical
with Frey and the original Hamlet, is called Mundlefore, "the
handle-mover":

The Mover of the Handle is father of Moon  
And the father eke of Sun.

This "World Mill" caused the heavens to revolve round a fixed point
marked by the polar star, which was called *veraldar nagli*, the
"world-spike".

Believing that sun and moon rose from the ocean, and that therefore
light came from darkness, they concluded that winter preceded summer at
the beginning.

Untold winters ere Earth was fashioned  
    Roaring Bergelm was born;  
His father was Thrudgelm of Mighty Voice,  
    Loud-sounding Ymer his grandsire. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md)

In the north it was observed also that growth was promoted when the ice
melted, and the teachers reasoned that the first being, Ymer, came into
existence when sparks from the southland, or "poison drops from the
sea", fell upon the primeval icebergs, and caused drops of trickling
water to fertilize the clay.

From Stormy-billow sprang poison drops  
Which waxed into Jotun form.

The Babylonians, on the other hand, who were familiar with the part
played by reeds in accumulating mud and binding river-banks, taught
that-

Marduk (Merodach) laid a reed upon the face of the waters.  
He formed dust and poured it out beside the reed. . . .  
He formed mankind. <span id="fr_43"></span>[2](#fn_43.md)

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

It may be, too, that the ancient teachers, who framed creation myths and
expounded local forms of the doctrine of the World's Ages, mingled at
times with their pseudoscientific deductions and brilliant imaginings
dim and confused racial traditions of early migrations and varied
experiences in different areas of settlement. Some of these traditions
may have had origin before the dawn of the Neolithic or Late Stone Age.
As will be shown, certain customs, which are familiar to students of
ancient civilizations, were prevalent among primitive peoples in the
vast Palæolithic or Early Stone Age. With these customs may have
survived in localities legends associated with or based upon them. The
possibility remains, therefore, that in Persian mythology there are
memories not only of an area of settlement among the mountains where
severe winters were as greatly dreaded as exceptional floods in river
valleys, but even of one of the last recurring phases of the Ice Age. A
poetic narrative relates that the patriarch Yima, who afterwards became
Lord of the Dead, constructed a shelter to afford safe protection for
mankind and their domesticated animals during the "evil winter", with
its "hard, killing frost". He had been forwarned of this approaching
world-disaster by the supreme god Ahura Mazda (Ormuzd). Perhaps the
"shelter" was a southern valley to which the proto-Persians were
compelled to migrate on account of the growing severity of successive
winters and the lowering of the perpetual snow-line around
mountain-fringed plateaus they were accustomed to inhabit. It is related
in the *Avesta*, one of the Persian sacred books, that "before the
winter the land had meadows. . . . The water was wont to flow over it
and the snow to melt." A similar prolonged winter is foretold in
Icelandic mythology. According to the *Prose Edda*, which is a

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

patchwork of fragmentary legends of uncertain origin and antiquity, it
will precede the destruction of the universe by the giants of frost and
fire (lightning). "In the first place will come the winter, called
Fimbul winter, during which snow will fall from the four corners of the
world; the frosts will be very severe, the wind piercing, the weather
tempestuous, and the sun impart no gladness." <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md)

From the Voluspa poem of the *Elder Edda* we gather details of--

A Sword Age, Axe Age--shields are cloven,  
A Wind Age, Wolf Age, ere the world sinks.

Then, after describing a period of universal destruction, the soothsayer
proceeds:

I see uprising a second time  
Earth from the ocean, green anew:  
The waters fall, on high the eagle  
Flies o'er the fell and catches fish. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md)

Various accounts of universal cataclysms come from the New World.
Representative of these are the legends of the Arawaks of North Brazil
regarding periods of flood, storm, and darkness, and those of the
Mexicans, which deal with the destruction of early races by deluges
caused by several succeeding suns perishing from lack of sustenance.

The most highly developed doctrinal systems of World Ages which have
survived from antiquity are found, however, in the Mythologies of India,
Greece, and Ireland. There is more than one account in Aryo-Indian
literature of the periodic Ages called Yugas. These are embraced in
longer Ages of sufficient duration to satisfy the

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

requirements of modern geologists. Four Yugas extend over a period of
"divine years" equal to 4,320,000 years of mortals, and a thousand of
the combined Yugas comprise a "Day of Brahma", the individualized "World
Soul". The Yugas begin with the Krita or Perfect Age, which is White,
and decline from that to the Treta, which is Red, and the Dwápara, which
is Yellow, to Kali Yuga, "the Black or Iron Age".

Hesiod, in his *Work and Days*, begins the Greek system with the perfect
Golden Age, which is followed by the Silver and Bronze Ages, and the two
Ages of Heroes and Iron, which may have been local subdivisions of the
fourth Age, represented in India by Kali Yuga.

Both in India and Greece, man it will be noted, was believed to have
relapsed from a primitive state of perfection. The system found in
Ireland, which was probably imported from Gaul with the doctrine of
transmigration of souls and the custom of widow-burning or slaying,
follows, on the other hand, an evolutionary process. The first Irish
Age, that of Partholon and his race, is an Age of folly. It is followed
by Nemed's Age, which was distinguished for cruelty, and the Age of the
Fir Bolgs, in which the power of evil was supreme. Then comes the Danann
Age of benevolent deities and heroes, who are the reputed "ancestors of
the men of learning in Erin". The last Age is the Milesian, and during
it St. Patrick reached Ireland and preached Christianity.

This ancient doctrine of the World's Ages, which may be traced in Egypt
and Babylonia, where certain gods lived for periods upon earth as human.
kings, was adapted to suit the needs of different cults in different
areas of localization. In India the four great castes were each
connected with a Yuga: the Brahmans had origin in the White Age, the
Kshatriyas (military aristocrats) in the

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

Red Age, the Vaisyas (traders and agriculturists) in the Yellow Age, and
the Sudras (Dravidians and pre-Dravidians) in the Black Age. In Greece
an Age was devoted to the Trojan heroes, and in Ireland the Fir Bolgs,
Dananns, and Milesians were identified with existing racial types whom
St. Patrick found there.

One of the versions of the Indian legend of Mythical Ages is related by
the deathless sage Markandeya, who lived through all the Yugas, and was
protected during the Deluge by the child-god Narayana. The Irish account
was put into the mouth of Tuan MacCarell. He had been a contemporary of
Partholon, and afterwards existed for periods as a stag, a boar, a
vulture or eagle, and a salmon. In the end his salmon form was devoured
by the wife of King Carell, with the result that he was reborn as her
son. Another sage of this class is the famous Mágus of the Icelandic
*Bragda Mágus* saga, who renewed his youth periodically by casting his
skin. He also figures in the Charlemagne romances.

If the ancient teachers, who professed to have received revelations from
sages like the "Wandering Jew", had been acquainted with the scientific
data which is now available, their narratives of past Ages would have
described greater changes than ever they conceived of. Nor would these
be lacking either in picturesqueness or imaginative appeal. The priestly
sages would have no cause to lament with the poet:

       Do not all charms fly  
At the mere touch of cold philosophy?  
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:  
We know her woof and texture; she is given  
In the dull catalogue of common things.

Even greater and more ferocious monsters than were

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

dreamt of in their philosophy might have figured in their
wonder-compelling and fearsome legends. Instead of the composite demons
of Egypt and Babylonia, the Eur-Asian dragons, the flying serpents of
the Nile valley, and the great snakes of ocean, they could have told of
the gigantic reptiles of the Triassic and Jurassic systems, the great
mammals of the Tertiary Period, and those contemporaries of man in the
Pleistocene Age, the hairy mammoths, bulky with fat and fur, the fierce
woolly rhinoceroses, the huge cave-bears, and the immense sabre-toothed
tigers. No ancient legend of fabled monsters surpasses the modern
scientist's account of extinct gigantic fauna. Nor can the
creation-myths on Egyptian papyri, Babylonian bricks, or Indian
palm-leaf books approach in grandness and charm the dramatic story of
the four great geological Ages of the World.

The author of the Tuan MacCarell legend would in our day begin his
narrative with the dawn of the Pleistocene Age, which endured for at
least 620,000 years, and was yet much shorter than any of the four
Tertiary Ages--the Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, or Pliocene.

In the post-Pliocene, or early Pleistocene period, Tuan, let it be
supposed, awakens from magic sleep in Europe. He gazes with wonder on
forests of strange and mighty trees. Monstrous wild animals come and go.
Several resemble elephants, and the greatest of these is the long-tusked
mastodon of colossal bulk. Hippopotami snort in the rivers, on the banks
of which crouch, basking in sunshine, ponderous Dinotheriums, resembling
sea-cows, with downward-curving tusks and short trunks. Across verdurous
plains gallop herds of little horses with divided hoofs. The dreaded
sabre-toothed tiger crouches in the jungle ready to pounce upon its
prey.

Tuan, who alternately sleeps for long centuries and

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

wanders about the earth like the legendary Jew, continues his narrative.
"When next I awoke", he tells, "I found that Europe had been completely
transformed. No great forests flourished on its central plains; bare
stretches of frozen ground extended far and near. From northern Germany
to the Pole, valleys and rivers were shrouded by ice and seas were
frozen over. Great mountain-peaks towered grimly above curving glaciers
like rocky islands in a foam-white ocean. Icebergs drifted down the
Atlantic past the coast of Spain. This was the First Glacial Period.

"When next I awoke the ice was vanishing, the rivers surged from the
melting glaciers) many valleys were flooded, and vegetation flourished.
In the years that followed I saw the forests extending northward from
the Mediterranean coast, and the ocean ebbing gradually farther and
farther away, owing to the widespread elevation of land, until great
islands became uplands in vast plains, and continents linked with
continents around the world. I must describe Europe as it appeared to me
before I next fell asleep. The Mediterranean Sea was divided into two
great lakes when Italy became attached to a triangular plain which
jutted out from the north African coast. The Strait of Gibraltar was
closed, and a broad valley united Spain with Morocco. Corsica and
Sardinia formed a promontory when the Gulf of Genoa vanished, and the
Balearic Isles were mountains on a finger of land attached to western
Spain. The Baltic Sea became a shrunken inland lake, the English Channel
and the North Sea had disappeared. The British Isles were then joined to
the Continent, and the plains which enclosed them extended far westward
beyond Land's End, the western coast-line of Ireland and that of the
Scottish Hebrides, and stretched north-eastward beyond the Shetland
Isles to the coast of

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

Norway. A "land-bridge", which shrank to a narrow neck 100 miles
north-west of Cape Wrath, united Scotland and Iceland) and narrowed
again ere it met the extended coast of Greenland. The Rivers Elbe and
Rhine drained the broad valley which had been the North Sea, and were
united about 150 miles eastward from the Aberdeenshire coast after the
Rhine had received the waters of the Forth and Tay. The Conon poured
through the valley which had been the Moray Firth, and, sweeping
eastward past the Orkney and Shetland Islands, entered the sea 20 miles
westward from the mouth of the Elbe. The Seine cut through the valley of
the English Channel, and the Severn united, 100 miles westward from
Land's End, with a river flowing from a long narrow loch which divided
Ireland from Scotland, and extended southward to Carnsore Point in
Wexford.

"Over the Eur-African land-bridges came many of the great animals which
I saw during the first period of the Pleistocene Age. Attracted by the
genial temperature, even the rhinoceros came north, and with the
sabre-toothed tiger prowled on the upland plains of England, where I saw
also the giant sloth, the hippopotamus, the mastodon, the triple-toed
horse, great tortoises, the giant fallow deer, the well-armoured
glyptodon, <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) as big as an ox, and
numerous great snakes and nimble apes.

"For a long period I searched in vain for traces of mankind, but at
length I discovered a tribe of most primitive savages at Mauer, on the
banks of the River Neckar, then very broad and deep, near where
Heidelberg now stands. They hunted down the horse and the elk, and
dreaded greatly the rhinoceros and the cave-lion. Their homes were among
the branches of high trees. In aspect they were extremely repulsive:
they had low, sharply-retreating

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

foreheads, squat noses, big bulging mouths, and chinless jaws. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md) I never saw these savages except in this
First Interglacial Period.

"When next I awoke from the slumber of centuries I found that Europe had
once more been transformed. The Mediterranean Sea had snapped the
Italian land-bridge and flowed through the Dardanelles to the Black Sea;
a blue strait separated Gibraltar from Morocco. The British Islands were
entirely isolated. Roaring tides swept up and down the English Channel,
and the broad North Sea, overswept by foam-churning tempest, was dotted
over by innumerable icebergs. Each succeeding winter the ocean
encroached farther and farther inland, burying in deep sand-banks the
great trunks of forest trees, creeping up river valleys and forming
stony beaches where wild flowers had bloomed and birds had carolled and
built their nests. At length the advancing billows shaped out a rough
shore-line round the island coasts over 40 feet above their present
level. In time the land was re-elevated and the sea shrank back again.

"The snow-line of Scottish mountains crept down gradually lower and
lower, and glaciers appeared once more. Ultimately vast fields of ice
jutted across the North Sea, and the Baltic remained frozen during the
months of summer. Icebergs were stranded on Dogger Bank and drifted down
the English Channel in early summer through veils of white fog into the
Bay of Biscay and round Cape Finisterre.

"Ere I went to sleep again the ice-fields had obliterated Holland and
Belgium and crept up the Elbe valley almost to the plain of Bohemia,
where the climate was sub-arctic

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

and tundra conditions prevailed as in northern Siberia at the present
time. Scotland, Ireland, and Wales were ice-locked, and England was
covered over as far south as Essex on the east and Gloucester on the
west, except where the battling glaciers left bare patches in the middle
districts and in the East Riding of Yorkshire. This was the Second
Glacial Period. When it had reached its maximum, I wandered southward
through France, then a dreary waste, and saw herds of musk-oxen and
reindeer, lumbering woolly rhinoceroses, and fat mammoths with great
recurving tusks and shaggy red manes.

"I had sought shelter from a blinding dust-storm in a cave on a bare
hill-side, and slept there. When next I awoke and crept forth, I found
myself in a deep shady forest. It was a fragrant morning of bright
sunshine, and although it seemed to be midsummer, the sweet spring
season had not yet spent itself. The rivers at this, the dawn of the
Second Inter-glacial Period, ran broad and deep, swollen by the melting
glaciers, but they shrank gradually as weeks of heat and dryness went
past. Wide shallow lakes grew smaller each succeeding summer until they
vanished entirely, and their dark beds grew verdant with long grasses.
When I went northward I found that the British Isles were once again a
part of the Continent. The African hippopotamus snorted in the Thames,
the rhinoceros lumbered along the plains of the English Channel, and
through the forests of the North Sea valley herds of elephants ranged as
far north as the banks of the Forth. I saw many tribes of human beings.
I first met them at Chelles, on the banks of the Seine, 8 miles eastward
from the site of Paris. The Chellean men were of higher type than the
grotesque tree-dwellers of Mauer. Their dark skins bespoke their
southern origin, and they resembled certain tribes of Australian
savages. They

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

were entirely devoid of clothing. The men carried long staves, which
were sharpened to points, with which they speared fish and hunted the
little wild horse. I saw them chipping flint and shaping
"hand-axes", <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) which they used for a
variety of purposes-cutting branches from trees, skinning and dividing
animals, and weapons. They also made small flint scrapers and small
flint daggers with rough curved hefts.

"I saw these men hunting in England and in Central and Western Europe.
They crossed over to Africa by the Italian land-bridge, round the rock
of Gibraltar, and along the Palestinian coast., and they were numerous
in Persia and India. Ere I fell asleep I was transported round the
world, and saw thousands of human beings following the edible animals
over the northern land-bridge from Asia to Canada, and down the western
sea-coast to South America. Then I slumbered again.

"Long centuries went past as I slept. When next I awoke I found that
Europe had once again become changed. The sea was washing round the
shores of the British Isles, and the Italian land-bridge to Africa had
been severed. Crete was no longer a part of the main land, and the green
mountains which had towered on the well-watered valley connecting Greece
with Asia Minor were islands in the Ægean Sea. The temperature had
suffered decline. Summer was shorter and winter longer and of growing
severity. During the warm weather the southern animals wandered through
France, and, when the snow began to fall, the mammoth, the woolly
rhinoceros, and the reindeer came down from the north in search of food.
I saw new types of humanity which had

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

arrived from Asia. They mingled with Chellean men in some localities,
and in others fought with them for possession of hunting-grounds. Many
tribes were isolated in Britain when the land was lowered and the sea
advanced. There were Asiatics in Sussex, and I saw some camping on the
banks of the Ouse at Piltdown, near Uckfield. <span
id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) During the winter these people sought
shelter in caves.

"The change of climate had intensified the struggle for existence) and
sharpened the wits of men. At St. Acheul, at Amiens, in the Somme
valley, I found the flint-workers displaying increased skill and
producing several new implements which the altered conditions of life
had made necessary. Acheulian man had achieved a considerable degree of
progress in other directions. Those tribes which remained in western and
central Europe, owing to the winter season found it necessary to provide
themselves with skin clothing, but the great majority migrated to genial
climes, and these continued their old habits of life. I fell asleep at
the close of this the Second Interglacial Period, which was longer and
more genial than any of the others.

"The Third Glacial Epoch was well advanced when next I set forth a
wanderer through the valleys of Europe. It was less widespread than the
second. Two-thirds of England and about a fourth of Ireland were clear
of ice, nor was the Zuyder Zee frozen during summer. The site of Berlin,
however, was well within the glacial area, as was also that of Warsaw.
The Alpine snow-line had crept down over 3000 feet. Yet although Europe
resembled in some parts Greenland and in others North Siberia in the
present Age, I saw numerous tribes of human beings. They were of small
stature but muscular and active. Their heads were narrow but of great

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

size, and their faces, although not devoid of intelligence, were
exceedingly rugged; their big dark eyes were overshadowed by enormous
brow ridges, they had broad flattened noses, projecting mouths, and
chinless jaws. <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md) They made their homes
in caves, and in these they lit fires, round which they sat to chip
their flints and fashion their skin garments.

"I will describe what I saw when I sought shelter with a tribe of these
people at Le Moustier, in the valley of Dordogne, in south-western
France. The River Vézère then flowed go feet higher than in modern
times. I entered a cave on a damp and chilly summer day. Haunches of
venison were being roasted on a fire-place constructed of upright
stones, and near it several workmen were busily engaged chipping flints.
They constructed a greater variety of implements than the men of the
Chellean and Acheulean Periods, and showed greater skill in economizing
their material: flakes were removed at a single blow and utilized for
smaller artifacts, and when an implement was given form it was carefully
dressed with minute chipping until it became an artistic product,
exceedingly pleasing to the eye. Men took delight in their work and
rivalled one another to gain the praises of their fellows. The tailors
cut the dried skins with their sharp hand-axes. Then they squatted with
crossed legs to sew the pieces together into not unshapely garments.
They made holes, through which to thrust their dried thongs, with little
flint awls. In the evening a company of hunters returned from the chase,
dragging on a skin sledge the carcass of a musk-ox; and when they had
feasted heavily, I heard them tell of battles with the cave-bear, of
escapes from the cave-lion and the dreaded woolly rhinoceros, of the
slaying

 

<span id="img_01600"></span> ![](img/01600.jpg)

EXAMPLES OF PALÆOLITHIC ART

The objects include: handles of knives and daggers carved in ivory and
bone, line drawings of wild animals, faces of men or demons, of
animal-headed demon or deity with arms uplifted (compare Egyptian "Ka"
attitude of adoration), of wild horses on perforated "arrow
straightener", of men stalking a bison, of seal, cow, reindeer, cave
bear, &c., and perforated amulets.

 

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

of a great mammoth, and of how they guarded their food-supplies against
the ravages of prowling hyenas, gluttons, and arctic foxes. Meanwhile
the women busily engaged themselves at the mouth of the cave cutting up
the body of the musk-ox and cleaning the skin with flint scrapers. Ere
night fell, the chief announced that on the morrow they would go
eastward to hunt reindeer. I gathered that these people migrated
northward during the summer, and returned again, on the approach of cold
weather, to their southern caves. Not infrequently they had to fight
with other tribes who took possession of their winter homes.

"I went to sleep during this period, and when next I awoke I found that
the Third Inter-glacial Period had dawned. The glaciers melted and again
there were great floods in the valleys, and the ice retreated from the
lowlands of Scotland. The summers in Central Europe were exceedingly
pleasant, but never so warm as during the Chellean Age, and dust-storms
were of frequent occurrence. Forests were once again flourishing, and I
saw in the midst of them many southern animals which were migrating
farther and farther northward. During winter the mammoth and woolly
rhinoceros came as far south as Prussia. Mousterian man was able to
pursue the hunt high among the mountains, where he found caves in which
to shelter himself from wild animals by night. He returned to the
valleys when the blizzards of winter drove southward the fierce and
numerous beasts of prey he dreaded most.

"I saw new types of mankind. In the Dordogne valley were tribes of
slender-limbed human giants who were fearless warriors and mighty
huntsmen. Some were 6 feet 6 inches in height. But it was not only in
stature that they contrasted sharply with the vanishing

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mousterians, who
were rarely higher than 5 feet 3 inches. They had big long heads and
broad faces, high foreheads, deep-set brown eyes, prominent cheek-bones,
sharply curved lips, and well-formed chins. They resembled modern
Europeans more closely than any human beings I had yet met with. Their
faces, tanned by wind and sun, were alert and keen, and, although
rugged, were greatly softened when their ready smile laid bare their
white gleaming teeth. I observed that the young men showed great respect
for their elders. It was of common occurrence to see many gathered round
a cave entrance listening to the counsel of some white-haired sage. An
old man, who had achieved widespread renown as an explorer and leader of
men, lived in a cave at Cro-Magnon, and was often approached to settle
disputes and give advice regarding great undertakings; he was also
skilled as a healer of wounds and a curer of disease. These men had
greater regard for their dead than obtained among their Mousterian
predecessors. I once saw them laying to rest a slain warrior in his
family burial-grotto at Aurignac. He was clad in his skin robe. His
headdress was adorned with a string of sea-shells and round his neck was
a collar of the perforated teeth of a reindeer, the skeleton of the
salmon of wisdom was laid on his breast, and the whole body was
sprinkled with magic pigment. A fire was lit, and the warriors danced
round the grave with slow, measured steps, while a sage recited the
mighty deeds performed by the dead man. Women knelt near at hand,
wailing a chorus of sorrow. Beside the warrior they laid his weapons and
implements as well as food which had been cooked for him and water for
refreshment; then the grotto was closed up with a large slab of
limestone. Aurignacian man of Cro-Magnon type was a lover of his kind.

saw other tribes which had entered southern France at this period from
Africa. At a Grimaldi cave near Mentone I dwelt for a space with a
family of dark-skinned people with broad noses and protruding mouths.
They resembled somewhat the modern Bushmen of South Africa and were
similarly of short stature, but their heads were larger and their faces
more intelligent. Middle-aged women had enormous development of fatty
tissue; their steatopygous figures were invariably exceedingly
grotesque, but were yet greatly admired. <span

"These Aurignacian peoples worshipped the mother-goddess, and there were
among them clever artists who carved out of ivory and bone, limestone
and steatite, female figures to represent their deity. Sometimes they
depicted the slim-waisted, long-haired Cro-Magnon women, and sometimes
the woolly-haired bulging forms of Grimaldi type. In those districts
where the Bushmen-like people were the slaves of the tall huntsmen a
steatopygous woman was sometimes selected at religious ceremonies to
represent the mother-goddess.

The Aurignacian artists were wont to decorate their caverns with figures
of wild animals, which they sketched in outline with pointed flints, and
often coloured with crayons of red ochre or painted with pigment which
they carried in bone tubes. In the deep cave of Altamira, in Spain, I
saw a great picture-gallery in which various artists had exhibited their
skill. One part of the vaulted roof was covered with lifelike
representations of edible animals, including wild horses, deer, and
boars, and elsewhere I saw artistic productions of similarly high merit.
In some caves, which were constantly inhabited, were impressions of
human hands. These were intended to

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

avert the influences of the evil eye and the attacks of demons. Huntsmen
left records of their experiences in summer hunting districts by
inscribing symbols on cave walls, so that those who came nigh might know
how they were likely to fare there. They also depicted the forms of
monstrous demons that had to be propitiated.

The hunters of the Aurignacian Age were the first I saw using bows and
arrows. In preparing the arrow-shafts they utilized perforated bone
straighteners. <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) Their flint
implements were worked with skill far surpassing that of the Mousterian
Age.

"How long I slept during this period I cannot tell. When next I woke up
I found that the temperature had suffered sharp decline. Cro-Magnon man
still inhabited a great portion of southern France, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md) but I observed also other types which were
new to me. At Solutre, Saone-et-Loire, where tall and short types gave
evidence of race intermixture, I fell in with highly-skilled artisans
who shaped flint lance-heads of laurel-leaf and willow-leaf shape, and
accomplished delicate secondary flaking by pressure with bone
implements. They also made comfortable skin clothing, which they sewed
with bone needles which had perforated eyes. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[3](#fn_54.md) The winters grew gradually longer and more
severe, and the men of the Solutrean Age achieved rapid progress in
their conflict with the elements. Huntsmen favoured the horse, but slew
also the reindeer.

"The Fourth Glacial Period followed, and it was suffering decline when I
next went out to explore those districts that had seen so many changes.
I awoke at La Madelaine, on the right bank of the Vézère, which then
flowed higher

PALEOLITHIC ART: REPRESENTATIVE PAINTINGS OF BISON AND DEER, FROM THE
CAVE OF ALTAMIRA, NEAR SANTANDER, SPAIN

The bison was evidently painted during summer, after it had rubbed its
shaggy winter coat off the greater part of its body.

 

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

than at the present day. In this district the tall men of Cro-Magnon
type were less numerous than the stumpy intruders of this Magdalenian
Age, who had some resemblance to the present-day Esquimaux. Half-breeds,
however, were not uncommon. The little men had much more refined and
intelligent faces than the Mousterians; their foreheads were large and
their chins prominent, and they were clad in closely-fitting skin
garments to resist the sub-arctic climate. Like the cave-dwellers of the
Aurignacian Age, they were skilled artists and artisans. The Grimaldi
folks had migrated southward, and ivory carvings of the mother goddess
were modelled on the slim-waisted female type. Artists continued to
decorate the caves with paintings of animals, and they also engraved
their implements and weapons, and even stones and pieces of slate. The
bison and the wild horse were often depicted, but the most favoured
models were the northern animals of this cold European Age. Mammoths
were growing scarce, for men had acquired skill in trapping them, and
the artists engraved ivory charms with their bulky forms, and numerous
were their studies of reindeer grazing on snowy plains, crouched up at
bay, or panting in rapid flight to escape the dogs and arrows of the
huntsmen. The Magdalenian artists also drew the snarling cave-bear, the
double-horned and snouted head of the woolly rhinoceros, the antelope
and the chamois, and the scampering wolf with gaping jaws. Among birds
they were familiar with the goose and the swan, and, as they were
accomplished fishermen, they could carve in many characteristic
attitudes the graceful salmon and the keen-eyed seal. Many huntsmen had
the handles of their daggers fashioned to represent the animals they
were wont to stalk and slay.

"During this period flint-working declined somewhat,

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

for the fashion became prevalent of pointing lances and arrows with
ivory and bone and reindeer horn. A great inventor equipped huntsmen
with a new weapon-the barbed harpoon-and another provided for it a
thrower made from reindeer horn, so that it could be thrown farther and
directed with surer aim. A long cord was attached to the harpoon, which
was utilized to catch salmon and seals. This wonderful invention was the
means of increasing greatly the food-supply. It thus rendered the
struggle for existence less arduous, especially when the tribes
increased in number.

"Great changes took place when the Fourth Glacial Period began to
decline, and more genial conditions became prevalent. The Magdalenian
huntsmen migrated farther and farther northward as the ice area shrank
in dimensions, because the reindeer deserted those districts which
failed to yield them in sufficient abundance the lichens upon which they
fed."

In the Gaelic legend of the Irish Ages it is stated that, when Tuan
ended, "the auditors thanked him. . . . They remained a whole week
talking with him." But his modern narrative deals with problems which
are not likely to be solved I n so brief a space of time. It touches the
fringes of not a few controversies which have been waged vigorously for
a number of years, and are likely to be continued indefinitely. In this
volume, however, which deals mainly with the intellectual life of early
peoples, it is unnecessary to state in detail the various conflicting
views regarding the geological periods and the earliest traces of man in
Europe; but a brief summary of the results of modern research may be
given, so that the general reader may be familiarized with one
particular phase of the subject which is pregnant with human interest.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

In Tuan's references to early man in Europe, six stages of development,
or levels of culture, have been referred to.

These are:

1\. The Chellean, in the Second Inter-glacial Period.  
2. The Acheulian, a late phase of the Chellean.  
3. The Mousterian, in the Third Glacial Period and later.  
4. The Aurignacian, in the Third Inter-glacial Period and later.  
5. The Solutrean, in the late Third Inter-glacial Period and later.  
6. The Magdalenian, in the Fourth Glacial Period.

Some archæologists place before the Chellean, Stage 1 the Mesvinian, and
2, the Strepyan, but others regard them as earlier phases of the
Chellean. A still earlier stage, called the Mafflian, with which the
Galley Hill (Kent) skeleton and implements were associated, has been
taken down to the Strepyan Period of Chellean man. The various stages
have been subdivided into Upper, Middle, and Lower Periods.

Of late years certain scientists have sought to establish a
pre-Palæolithic Age called the Eolithic. They thus place the appearance
of man in the geological Tertiary system, not only in the Pliocene Age,
which preceded the Pleistocene, but also back through the Miocene and
Oligocene Ages to the Eocene. The Tertiary stages of culture are called
Reutelian, and are as follows:--

1\. Eocene Age, Duan (Reutelian).  
2. Oligocene Age, Fagnian (Reutelian).  
3. Miocene Age, Cantalian (Reutelian).  
4. Pliocene Age, Kentian (Reutelian).  
5. Early Pleistocene, Thames basin (Reutelian).

Then follow the Mesvinian and Strepyan phases of early Chellean culture.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

Professor James Geikie confesses he is "staggered" by the theory that
man existed in the Tertiary system of Ages. "Since the Eocene Period,
which must date back", he says, "several millions of years, the whole
mammalian fauna has undergone modifications and changes, continuous
evolution having resulted in the more or less complete transformation of
numerous types, while many others have long been extinct. And yet, if we
accept the eoliths as proofs of man's existence in Eocene and Oligocene
times, we must admit that in this case--and in this case
alone--evolution must have been at a standstill during a prodigiously
extended period. For it must be understood that the eoliths of the older
Tertiary formations cannot be distinguished from those met with in the
Miocene, Pliocene, and even Pleistocene deposits. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md)

These "eoliths" are chipped flints which were either flaked by man or by
natural causes--the movements of strata settling under pressure or the
action of water. The problem is a difficult one. "The unprejudiced",
says Professor Duckworth, "will maintain an open mind, pending the
advent of more conclusive evidence than has been adduced
hitherto." <span id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md) Professor Sollas, on the
other hand, is convinced that not a trace of unquestionable evidence of
man's existence has been found in strata admittedly older than the
Pleistocene. <span id="fr_57"></span>[3](#fn_57.md)

Estimates of the approximate duration of the Pleistocene Age vary
considerably. Geikie, following Penck, gives 620,000 years as a minimum;
Rutot confines it to 139,000 years, and thus reduces greatly the age of
his "eoliths", while Sturge estimates that a single period of it lasted
for 700,000 years. The majority of leading scientists, however, have of
late inclined to favour Penck's

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

system of dating, and to allow 400,000 years as a minimum for the
Palæolithic or Early Stone Age, which begins with the first stages of
Chellean culture. The dawn of the Neolithic, or Late Stone Age, is dated
in southern Europe and Palestine at roughly 10,000 B.C.

In the next chapter consideration will be given to those traces which
survive of the religious and magical beliefs of the Palæolithic peoples,
and it will be shown that the evidence accumulated has an important
bearing on the problems raised by Cretan and pre-Hellenic discoveries,
as well as upon the study of the myths and legends of Babylonia and
Egypt, and those of peoples less renowned but no less important from the
point of view of the student of comparative mythology.
