# INTRODUCTION

IN relating how Crete has risen into prominence as the seat of a great
and ancient civilization, one is reminded of the fairy story of
Cinderella. The archæological narrative begins with the discovery made
by Schliemann of traces of a distinctive and high pre-Hellenic culture
amidst the ruins of the Peloponnesian cities of Tiryns and Mycenæ, which
he assigned to the Homeric Age. Evidence was soon forthcoming that this
culture was not of indigenous character, but had been imported from some
unknown area after it had reached its highest development and was
beginning to show signs of decadence -a sure indication of its great
antiquity. A dramatic search followed for the centre of origin and
diffusion. The wonderful slipper had been found, but where was
Cinderella? In the end, after several claims had been urged, the last
comer was proved to be the missing princess of culture, and the last
comer was Crete. Research on that island had been long postponed on
account of the disturbed political conditions that prevailed under the
Turkish regime.

A new first chapter has since been added to the history of European
civilization. We no longer begin with Hellenic Greece, or believe that
Hellenic culture sprang full-grown into being like the fabled deity who
leapt from her parent's head. In this volume it is shown that the

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

myths and legends preserved in the works of various classical writers
regarding the sources of Grecian culture were well founded, and that the
traditions of the "Heroic Age" did not have origin in the imaginations
of poets and dramatists. But, wise as we chance to be, after the event,
we need not regard with scorn the historians of a past generation who
hesitated to sift and utilize such elusive myths as the Cretan origins
of Zeus and Demeter, and the semi-historical references to Crete, in the
works of Homer, Thucydides, and others, to find a sure basis for a
convincing narrative worthy of the name of history.

It is only within recent years that the necessary archaeological data
have been available which enables students of ancient civilization to
draw with some degree of confidence upon the abundant but confused
contents of the storehouse of folk memory.

The discovery that Crete was the birth-place of Ægean civilization,
which radiated in the pre-Hellenic times throughout Europe--"the little
leaven that leavened the whole lump"--does not, however, set a limit to
the work of research, or solve all the problems which are involved.
Although it has been demonstrated that the Cretan leaven was in
existence and at work at the dawn of the Egyptian Dynastic Age, and when
the Sumerians were achieving their earliest triumphs in the
Tigro-Euphratean valley, we are still confronted with the problem of
remote origin. The earliest settlers in Crete had, as their artifacts
demonstrate, already obtained a comparatively high degree of Neolithic
culture. Houses were built of stone as well as of wattles daubed with
clay, a sea trade was in existence, for obsidian was imported from
Melos, and a section of the community had adopted the agricultural mode
of life. Withal, beliefs were well developed and had assumed a fixity
which remained until they were merged in the

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

accumulated mass of Grecian inheritance, and suffered, as a result, for
long ages, complete loss of identity. The earliest settlement of people
at Knossos has been assigned to about 10,000 B.C., an approximate dating
which is based on the evidence of the archaeological strata.

But the earliest traces of an artistic culture in Europe belong to a
still more remote age. Although during the vast periods of the
Neolithic, or Late Stone Age, there existed savage communities, just as
happens to be the case at the present day in various parts of the world,
there were also, as in Crete, Egypt, and Babylonia, refined and
progressive peoples who were already "heirs of all the Ages"--the Ages
when ancient Europe passed through stages of climatic oscillations of
such pronounced character that the remains of mankind are found in
strata yielding alternately tropical, temperate, and Arctic flora and
fauna. The period in question, the lengthiest in the history of
civilization, is the archaeological Palæolithic, or Early Stone Age.
Towards its close, for which the minimum dating is 20,000 B.C., there
existed in Europe at least two races, whose cultures are referred to as
Aurignacian and Magdalenian. A stage called Azilian links the
Palæolithic with the Neolithic Age, and the continuity of culture from
the earliest times is now generally regarded as an established fact.

The story of Cretan civilization may constitute, as has been said, the
first chapter of European history. But the "Introduction" is derived
from the Palæolithic Age, before and during the Fourth Glacial Epoch of
the geologists.

Our introductory data are obtained from the famous Palæolithic
cave-dwellings of France and Spain, which are dealt with in Chapters I
and II. No definite traces are yet obtainable, among the scanty human
remains that

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

have been discovered, of racial types resembling those of early Egypt or
early Crete, but remarkable evidence has been forthcoming which not only
establishes the great antiquity of certain artistic motifs -of finished
artistic skill and even of certain customs that afterwards appeared on
the Island of Minos and in the Nilotic and Tigro-Euphratean areas.

The links with Crete are so close and suggestive that writers like
Angelo Mosso have expressed the belief in the Neolithic and Cretan
origin of Aurignacian and Magdalenian art. But the geologists have
established beyond a shadow of doubt that the civilization of which this
art is an eloquent expression must be assigned to the latter part of the
Pleistocene period, when the reindeer roamed through the valleys of
France.

Those ancient Palæolithic hunters were skilled artists and carvers of
bone and ivory. They painted and engraved on cave roofs the figures of
animals with a realism and freedom which were never surpassed in Greece;
they also carved ivory female figurines in the round which are worthy of
comparison with similar artistic products of Egypt, and not always to
their disadvantage.

"The resemblances", writes Mosso, "between the most ancient female
figures in France and the Neolithic figures of Crete and Egypt are very
striking." Among the rock pictures of women he sees "the girdle and the
Egyptian mode of hairdressing". Describing a Palæolithic painting, he
writes: "The women's hair flows down upon their shoulders like that of
the Minoan women; the bosom is uncovered and the breasts much developed.
The triangular shape of the heads indicates a hood or a kind of mitre.
Two of them wear a bracelet on the upper arm near the elbow, and all
have a very slender waist, with the body shaped like an hour-glass." He

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

also comments in another instance on the skirts, which were also
characteristic of Crete. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)Comparisons
between the Cretan frescoes and the Palæolithic cave-paintings of Spain
and France have likewise been made by the Abbé Breuil, Don Juan Cabre
Aguila, and other Continental archæologists.

One of the racial types which existed during the Aurignacian and
Magdalenian periods, or stages of culture, was the Cro-Magnon. It can
still be traced in Europe, especially in the French Dordogne valley, and
among the Berbers in North Africa, as Dr. Collignon has shown. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) Evidence of Cro-Magnon migration in Late
Pleistocene times has also been forthcoming from Belgium, while traces
of their burial customs have been found in Moravia and elsewhere. How
and by what route Aurignacian influence reached Crete, after the lapse
of thousands of years, we have as yet no means of knowing. It seems
reasonable to assume that this civilization did not end without leaving
heirs somewhere. The Greeks were heirs of Crete, and yet it is but quite
recently that this fact has been fully demonstrated.

Not only has the antiquity of European art been established; the
Palæolithic data which have been accumulated emphasize also the remote
beginnings of certain magical and religious beliefs and practices. The
suggestion is thus rendered plausible that some of the widespread myths
and folk-tales may be as old as the French and Spanish cave-paintings
and ivory carvings. Who will venture, for instance, to date the origin
of that far-travelled tale about the lovers who escape from the giant's
den and throw down pebbles which become mountains and twigs which create
forests, to delay their angry

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

pursuer? The late Mr. Andrew Lang has shown that it is found in Zulu,
Gaelic, Norse. Malagasy, Russian, Italian, and Japanese
folk-literatures. The author "will never", he wrote, "be known to fame",
although, among storytellers, he has achieved "the widest circulation in
the world". <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

A now popular hypothesis, first urged by Hugh Miller, is usually held to
offer a conclusive explanation for the wonderful resemblances between
certain legends collected in various parts of the world. "I have seen",
Miller wrote about eighty years ago, "in the museum of the Northern
Institution (Inverness) a very complete collection of stone battle-axes.
some of which have been formed little earlier than the last age. by the
rude natives of America and the South Sea Islands, while others, which
have been dug out of the cairns and tumuli of our own country, bear
witness to the unrecorded feuds and forgotten battle-fields of twenty
centuries ago. I was a good deal struck by the resemblance which they
bear to each other; a resemblance so complete, that the most practised
eye can hardly distinguish between the weapons of the old Scot and the
New Zealander. . . . Man in a savage state is the same animal
everywhere, and his constructive powers, whether employed in the
formation of a legendary story or of a battle-axe, seem to expatiate
almost everywhere in the same ragged track of invention. For even the
traditions of this first stage may be identified., like his weapons of
war, all the world over." <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md)

Since Miller's day experts have become so familiar with the stone
implements and weapons of primitive men that they experience no
difficulty, not only in distinguishing between the characteristic
products of various

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

countries, but also of the various ages, or stages of culture, in one
particular area. We find ourselves, however, on less sure ground when we
deal with traditional tales. Miller's hypothesis in regard to these must
still receive acceptance but with certain qualifications. It certainly
accounts for striking resemblances, although not for equally striking
differences. If it were to be urged in every instance, the work of
research would be stultified and rendered somewhat barren. "There is a
well-known tendency", as Mr. Hogarth reminds us, "to find one formula to
explain all things, and an equally notorious one to overwork the latest
formula." <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

The intensive study of the mythology of a particular civilization, like
that of Crete or Egypt, for instance, reveals marked local divergencies
which are not easily accounted for. It is an extremely risky proceeding,
therefore, when we find a fragment of a legend, or a clue to some
archaic religious custom, in a cultural centre like Crete, to undertake
the work of reconstruction by selecting something from Australia, adding
a Chinese idea, and completing the whole with contributions from Russia,
Greenland, or Mexico. We may find similar symbols in different
countries, but it does not follow that they had originally all the same
significance; similar alphabetical signs have not always the same
phonetic values. The human mind is not like a mould which produces
automatically the same shapes for the same purposes, or the same ideas
to account for the same problems, in every part of the world.

Myths are products of beliefs, and beliefs are products of experiences.
They are also pictorial records of natural phenomena. Mankind have not
had the same experiences everywhere, nor have they found the world

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

lacking in variety of contour and climate. Certain peoples, for
instance, have achieved progress in civilizations based on the
agricultural mode of life. Their beliefs have consequently been
influenced by their agricultural experiences, and their myths have been
given an agricultural significance. Before the Calendar was invented,
the farmer who profited from the experiences of his ancestors, and
handed on his knowledge to posterity, did not speak about "ploughing in
spring" and "reaping in autumn", or explain the futility of sowing seed,
say, in December and expecting crops in April. He framed instead a
system of myths which guided the agricultural operations of his kin for
long centuries. In India, which suffers at one season from great heat
and drought, he conceived the Drought Demon which imprisoned the
fertilizing waters in a mountain cave. just when the world is about to
perish, the god Indra comes to its rescue armed with his thunderbolt. He
attacks and slays the demon, exclaiming:

I am the hurler of the bolt of thunder;  
For man flow freely now the gleaming waters.

After this thunder-battle, rain descends in torrents, the withered grass
sprouts luxuriantly, and the rice harvest follows.

In Babylonia the demon is the water-monster Tiamat, who enters the
Euphrates and causes it to flood. She is slain and cut up by Merodach,
who thus sets the world in order. Then the farmer sows his seeds. In
Egypt the inundation of the Nile is brought about by Ra, who, having
undertaken to destroy his human enemies, relents and withdraws the
waters, so that seeds may be cast in the fertilized soil and the harvest
gathered in season. Pious worshippers of the deities who controlled the
forces

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

of nature were expected to perform ceremonies and offer sacrifices to
assist or propitiate them. Thus the local forms of religion were shaped
by local phenomena of which the myths are reflections.

Peoples who lived among the mountains and followed the pastoral mode of
life had different experiences from those who found their food-supply in
river valleys. In districts where the rainfall was regular and abundant
they knew nothing of India's droughts, or Egypt's floods. On the other
hand, they might have experiences of binding frost, fierce blizzards,
and snow-blocked passes, which forced them to migrate to districts where
they could winter their flocks and herds. Their myths were consequently
based on experiences and natural phenomena which contrasted sharply with
those of the Nilotic and Tigro-Euphratean peoples, with the result that
their systems of religious beliefs developed upon different lines.
Similarly, peoples who dwelt upon islands and along sea-coasts and
gathered the harvest of the deep, and forest-dwellers who lived on
fruits and trophies of the chase, formulated and perpetuated modes of
thought which were products of their particular modes of life in
different environments. It is obvious, therefore, that the mind of man
did not everywhere follow "the same rugged track of invention". In
different districts and at different periods sections of mankind
achieved independent development on sharply differentiated lines, with
the result that religious conceptions, like outstanding racial types,
had their areas of characterization.

Consideration should next be given to cultural influence resulting from
contact. The oscillations of climate which followed the last glacial
epoch caused widespread migrations of peoples. Racial types which are
still recognizable were already fixed; mankind at the dawn of

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

the Neolithic or Late Stone Age had attained full mental <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) and physical development. Races were
distributed far and wide, and settlers favoured those areas which were
suitable for their habits of life. The barriers of ice and snow which
had separated peoples for thousands of years vanished before the warm
sun, and as the various races prospered and increased they came into
contact with one another. Let us picture a pastoral tribe issuing from a
region of steppe lands and entering a valley occupied by agriculturists.
They come with a heritage of beliefs and customs as alien as their
language to those who rear crops and dwell in villages. The small
farmers regard them as demons, and go out to battle to conquer or be
conquered. If the invaders prevail, they remain in the district and in
time fuse with the conquered. Then the beliefs of the mingled peoples
are fused also. The result is a compromise between the distinctive
religions. In the valley the earlier faith secures ascendancy because
the invaders have no agricultural religion and no words even for "corn"
and "furrow" and "plough". But a portion of the conquerors follow their
old habits of life as pastoralists and hunters, and occupy the
grazing-lands round the valley and among the hills, where they find a
new Olympus for their gods. In time a pantheon is formed which embraces
the deities of conquered and conquerors.

Trade springs up between various communities and the influence of
culture flows along the trade routes. The knowledge of how to grow corn
passes from tribe to tribe. But the isolated hunters in a northern
valley who become agriculturists do not simply import implements and
seeds; those who instruct them how to till the soil instruct them also
regarding the ceremonies which are necessary to ensure growth and the
harvest.

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

So the agricultural religion of Egypt or Babylon passes through Europe
and Asia, and is adopted by peoples who mix with it their own peculiar
local practices inherited for untold generations from their remote
ancestors.

In Denmark the northern huntsman and fisherman came into contact with
the little farmers from the south, or tribes who had acquired the
southern art of agriculture. They learned to sow the seed in sorrow and
to beat their breasts when they cut the corn, and thus slew the corn
spirit, and to return rejoicing carrying the sheaves. Magical ceremonies
were considered to be as essential to agricultural success as ploughs
and reaping-hooks, Consequently they adopted the magical ceremonies that
had origin somewhere on the shores of the Mediterranean or in the Nile
valley. So we find in Denmark the myth of Scef, the child god, who comes
over the sea with the first sheaf of corn, which so closely resembles
the Babylonian myth of Tammuz, who comes as a child from the Underworld
and the Deep every new year.

The non-agricultural mountain-folk, who migrated hither and thither,
knew naught of the corn-child. They conceived of a god who shaped the
mountains with his hammer, the thunderbolt; each blow was a peal of
thunder. He also hammered the sky into shape. Meteorites which fell from
the sky were found to be of iron; it was consequently believed that the
sky was formed of iron, which became known as "the metal of heaven".
Iron was regarded as a protective charm. It was associated with the
great deity who slew demons. A mortal had only to "touch iron" to drive
demons away, for by doing so he established a magical connection between
himself and the hammer deity.

Worshippers of the mountain-god went northward and called him Thor. In
Asia Minor he was Tarku and

<span id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span>

Teshub; in India, Indra, son of Dyaus; in Greece, Zeus. Those
worshippers who reached Palestine called him Pathach (the Hebrew name),
and those who settled in Egypt knew him as Ptah, and, although
thunderstorms are rare in Egypt, the Memphites never forgot the hammer
of Ptah and the heaven of iron which he had beaten into shape. In time
Ptah acquired new attributes. As the artisan-god he was credited with
the invention of the Egyptian potter's wheel, on which he shaped the sun
and moon, and the first man and woman. He was thus localized. Yet he
ever remained distinctive among the deities of Egypt.

Tradition dies hard. Once an idea became impressed on the human mind it
remained there, and new ideas were superimposed upon it. The Egyptians
achieved great progress as thinkers and artisans, yet they dung to
beliefs and customs of savage origin. So did the Greeks, who never
forgot Cronos, the bloodthirsty god who swallowed his children and had
to be murdered by his heir. It does not follow, however, that this
tendency to conserve ancient beliefs and modes of thought was opposed to
the growth of culture, or that men and women who perpetuated them were
as ignorant and bloodthirsty as their primitive ancestors. In our own
day an individual with a university degree may dread to spill salt,
regard a black cat as lucky, and refuse to occupy a hotel bedroom
numbered 13. Motor-cars and flying-machines carry mascots, as did the
galleys of ancient Egypt, Crete, and Phœnicia. The writer has seen a
Girton girl perpetuating a religious custom of her remote ancestors by
attaching a rag to a tree that overhangs a "wishing well", and wishing
silently her wish quite as fervently as do less highly cultured members
of her sex in places as far removed as the Scottish Highlands and the
Island of Crete.

<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span>

Superstitious practices which are familiar in our everyday lives have a
long history. They have survived nearly two thousand years of Christian
influence. Who will undertake to date their origins? They may go back to
the Bronze Age, the Late Stone Age, and even to the interglacial periods
of the Palæolithic Age. The following comparative notes will serve to
illustrate the antiquity of at least one remarkable folk-belief.

In Upper Egypt discovery has been made of bodies which were buried in
hot dry sands about sixty centuries ago. Not only have the bones, skin,
hair, muscles, and eyes been preserved, but even the internal organs.
The contents of stomachs and intestines have been examined by Dr.
Netolitzky, the Russian scientist, who ascertained in this way what food
the ancient people ate. "The occasional presence of the remains of mice
in the alimentary canals of children, under circumstances which prove
that the small rodent had been eaten after being skinned, is", writes
Professor Elliot Smith, "a discovery of very great interest, for Dr.
Netolitzky informs me that the body of a mouse was the last resort of
medical practitioners in the East several millennia later as the remedy
for children *in extremis*." <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) Until
comparatively recently the liver of a mouse was in the Scottish
Highlands the "old wife's cure" for children dangerously ill. The writer
was informed regarding it in more than one locality, long before the
Egyptian discovery was made, by women who professed to have had
experience of the efficacy of the mouse cure.

The ashes of a mouse baked alive used to be a cure for rheumatism in
Suffolk. In Lincolnshire fried mice were given to children suffering
from whooping-cough and quinsy. According to Henderson <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) a whooping-cough

<span id="page_xxx">p. xxx</span>

patient in the northern counties had to be seated on a donkey, with face
towards the tail, when the mouse was being eaten. The custom of
entombing a live mouse in an ash-tree, to cure children or charm cattle
against attack, prevailed in Leicestershire. <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) A similar custom obtained in Scotland, where
the shrew-mouse was believed to paralyse a limb it chanced to creep
over. <span id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md) The traditional fear of mice
among women is of interest in this connection. Roasted mouse was, in the
north-eastern counties of Scotland, a cure for cold or sore throat.

In Egypt the mouse was associated with the lunar god Thoth, who cured
Horus when he was bitten by the scorpion, restored the sight of his eye
which was blinded by the black Set pig, and assisted in uniting the
fragments of the body of Osiris. The mouse crouches at the base of his
rod of destiny, on which he measured out the lives of men. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_10.md) In Greece the mouse was associated with
Apollo. This god was identified by the Romans with the sun, but Homer
knew him as Smintheus Apollo, "Mouse Apollo", who struck down the Greeks
with his arrows of pestilence. <span id="fr_11"></span>[4](#fn_11.md)
According to Strabo, there were many places which bore the Apollo mouse
name. <span id="fr_12"></span>[5](#fn_12.md) Mouse feasts were held at
Rhodes, Gela, Lesbos, and Crete. According to a Trojan story, the
settlement took place in Anatolia of Cretans who were advised by an
oracle to select the first place where they were attacked by the
children of the soil. At Hamaxitus, in the Troad, a swarm of mice ate
their bow-strings and the leather of their armour, and they decided to
make that place their home. <span id="fr_13"></span>[6](#fn_13.md) In India

<span id="page_xxxi">p. xxxi</span>

the mouse was associated with Rudra, to whom the poet prayed:

Give unto me of thy medicines, Rudra,  
So that my years may reach to a hundred. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)

Rudra, like Apollo, sent diseases, and was therefore able to prevent and
cure them.

The mouse feasts referred to by ancient writers may have been held to
ensure long life among those who, like the Egyptians, connected the
mouse with the moon, the source of fertility and growth and the measurer
of the days of man. The Egyptian lunar god Khonsu was the divine
physician and the love-god. All fertility deities, indeed, cured
diseases. The King of Mitanni sent the image of Ishtar to Thebes when
Pharaoh Amenhotep III was ill. Isaiah refers to the mouse-eating
practice: "They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the
gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the
abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the
Lord." <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md) When the Philistines, who
came from Crete, were stricken by a pestilence, they placed five golden
mice in the ark and sent it back to the Israelites. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md) Thus we find the Highland mouse-cure
belief going back for 6000 years and reaching to the remotest areas
settled by representatives of the Mediterranean race. Other
superstitions may be as old, or older. The ancient Egyptians, like our
own people, inherited beliefs from their savage ancestors.

The evidence summarized in this volume (Chapter II) regarding
Palæolithic customs and beliefs tends to emphasize that, while mankind
everywhere may arrive at similar conclusions under similar
circumstances, some conceptions were handed down by tradition and
distributed over wide

<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span>

areas by wandering peoples long before the dawn of the Neolithic period
in Europe and Egypt. If the mouse cure can be traced back for sixty
centuries it may well have been known for a further sixty centuries. In
Palæolithic times, at least 20,000 years ago, the spine of a fish was
laid on the corpse when it was entombed, just as the "ded" amulet, which
was the symbol of the backbone of Osiris, was laid on the neck of the
Egyptian mummy. Anthropologists have favoured the theory that the
animal-headed deities of Egypt are links between animal and
anthropomorphic deities. Animal-headed deities with arms uplifted in the
Egyptian attitude of adoration figure in Palæolithic cave-drawings. The
process of change, if such it was, must therefore have commenced
thousands of years before the Dynastic Egyptians became supreme in the
Nile valley. It used to be urged that the Phœnicians were the inventors
of alphabetic script, but linearized signs "of curiously alphabetic
aspect--at times even in groups--are seen engraved on reindeer horns or
ivory, or on the surface of the rock itself", which were the work of
Palæolithic folk in the Fourth Glacial Period. "Certain signs", says Sir
Arthur Evans, from whom we quote, "carved on a fragment of reindeer
horn, are specially interesting from the primitive anticipation that
they present of the Phœnician *alef*. . . . It is interesting to observe
that among the existing peoples of the extreme north of Europe, whose
conditions most nearly represent those of the old Reindeer folk, the
relics of pure pictography were preserved to modern times. . . . These
Lapp pictographs themselves belong to a widely diffused primitive
group--illustrated by the paintings and carvings on rocks and other
materials--which extends across the whole Fenno-Tataric region from the
White Sea to the Urals and throughout Siberia to the borders of China.

 

<span id="img__03200"></span> ![](img/_03200.jpg)

Terra-cotta Disk from Phæstos, with pictographic script which reads from
the centre outwards, but has not been deciphered. It is believed to have
come from Lycia, Asia Minor. Heads with feather head-dress similar to
that worn by the Philistines appear on the disk.

<span id="img__03201"></span> ![](img/_03201.jpg)

INSCRIBED TABLETS FOUND IN CRETE

 

<span id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span>

It was probably from an early offshoot of this great family of pictorial
signs that the elaborate characters of the Chinese writing were
ultimately evolved." Similar pictographs are found in Scandinavia,
Ireland, Brittany, Portugal, Spain, North-West Africa, the Canaries, in
the Maritime Alps, the Vosges, Dalmatia, in Transylvania, and on early
Trojan artifacts. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)

In addition to the pictographs there also passed from the Palæolithic
into the Neolithic and Bronze Ages certain burial customs, decorative
designs developed from animal drawings, the custom of shaping figurines
of the mother goddess with female characteristics emphasized, and the
bell-shaped skirt which found favour in Crete. Palæolithic pottery found
in Belgium has Neolithic characteristics. It has also been demonstrated,
as stated, that what is known as the Azilian stage of culture links the
cultures of the Early and Late Stone Ages. After the close of the Fourth
Glacial Period the early pioneers of the Mediterranean race came into
contact in Europe with the remnants of the Palæoliths and mingled with
them in localities. Among a large number of skulls taken recently from
an old Glasgow graveyard, into which an Infirmary extension intruded,
were a considerable sprinkling of Palæolithic types. The interments at
this part were made during the 18th century and the early part of the
19th century. Apparently there were descendants of the Palæoliths among
the makers of modern Glasgow.

Certain beliefs and customs and folk-tales appear also to have survived
with the peoples of the Reindeer Period, among whom they were prevalent.
And as the culture of that period (the Fourth Glacial Epoch) developed
from the cultures of the earlier periods, it is possible that some
surviving modes of thought may have obtained for

<span id="page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv</span>

40,000 years. The Chellean hand-axe of the Second Interglacial Period in
France was distributed far and wide; it travelled across the Italian
land-bridge to Africa and penetrated as far as Cape Colony; it was
imitated in Asia and passed across the Behring Straits land-bridge to
America. and reached the utmost southern limits of South America. It
never reached Australia. Perhaps Mr. Lang's "far-travelled tale" was
similarly given widespread distribution at a remote period in the
history of the human races. The culture of a particular people reached
remote corners of the globe to which descendants of its originators may
never have penetrated. We are familiar with this phenomenon even at the
present day. It should be borne in mind, therefore, that although the
mind of man may have in primitive times conceived similar ideas and
invented similar tales in various regions widely separated, the masses
of humanity on the whole have also been more prone to conserve what they
have acquired than to welcome something new. Nothing impresses the
student of comparative mythology more than the barrenness of the
primitive mind. New ideas are the exception rather than the rule.
Changes in religious ideas were forced upon ancient peoples either by
intruding aliens or by the influence exercised by physical phenomena in
new areas of settlement. Even when a change occurred the past was not
entirely cut off. Rather a fusion was effected of the new ideas with the
old.

In dealing with a mythology like that of Crete, which has not yet been
rendered articulate, for the script has still to be deciphered, we
expect to find traces of more than one stage of development in religious
ideas, and also of the ideas of settlers on the island of peoples from
different cultural centres. Certain relics suggest Egyptian influence
and others point to an intimate connection with

<span id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span>

archaic Grecian beliefs. No doubt Crete inherited much from Egypt; and
certain Greek States in which Cretan colonists settled borrowed much
from Crete. It remains to be proved, however, that the Cretans, after
settling on their island, developed on the same lines as primitive
peoples elsewhere, or even that they previously passed through the
different stages of religious culture regarding which evidence has been
gleaned from various parts of the world.

It is sometimes assumed that the religious history of the human race is
marked by well--defined layers of thought--Naturalism or Naturism,
Totemism, Animism, Demonology, Tribal Monotheism which with the fusion
of tribes leads to Polytheism, and then ultimately sole Monotheism. All
these stages may be traced in a particular area. But we must not expect
to find them everywhere. Human thought has not accumulated strata of
ideas in regular sequence, like geological or archaeological strata.
Sonic peoples, for instance, have never conceived of a personal god, or
even of distinctive animistic spirit groups. Mr. Risley has shown that
the jungle-dwellers of Chota Nagpur fear and attempt to propitiate "not
a person at all in any sense of the word. If one must state the case in
positive terms," he adds, "I should say that the idea which lies at the
root of their religion is that of Power, or rather of many Powers. . . .
Closer than this he does not seek to define the object to which he
offers his victim, or whose symbol he daubs with vermilion at the
appointed season. Some sort of Power is there, and that is enough for
him. . . . All over Chota Nagpur we find sacred groves, the abode of
equally indeterminate things, who are represented by no symbols and of
whose form and function no one can give an intelligible account. They
have not yet been clothed with individual attributes;

<span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>

they linger on as survivals of the impersonal stage of religion." <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) The Australian natives, on the other hand,
and even those who are more primitive than the Chota Nagpur
jungle-dwellers, have a god whose voice is imitated by the "bull
roarer". Palæolithic man of the Reindeer Age, as has been said, had
animal-headed deities and shaped, in ivory, figurines of the mother
goddess. In Egypt and Babylonia there were composite deities, half
animal and half human, from the earliest times of which we have
knowledge. The Chinese have deities also, but have specialized as
ancestor-worshippers. Argue as we may regarding well-defined "mental
processes", it must be recognized that religious phenomena all over the
world cannot be explained by a single hypothesis, and that we are not
justified in assuming that the same stages, or all the recognized
stages, of development can be traced everywhere. There may have been
Totemic beliefs in Crete and Greece and there may not. Until definite
proof is forthcoming that there were, the problem must remain an open
one. Similarly, we should hesitate to accept the hypotheses that
patriarchal conditions were preceded by matriarchal and that goddesses
preceded gods everywhere. In India the gods were prominent in the Vedic
period; during the post-Vedic period goddesses ceased to be vague and
became outstanding personalities as "Great Mothers". <span
id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_19.md)

This brings us to an interesting phase of Cretan religious and social
life. From the evidence afforded by idols, pictorial art, symbols, and
traditions it would appear that the goddess cult was supreme on the
island, Priestesses were as prominent as they were at Dodona. In fact,
women appear to have taken a leading part in

<span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span>

religious ceremonies, as Jeremiah found was the case in Jerusalem, where
women baked cakes which were offered to the "Queen of Heaven", the
Eastern mother-goddess. "Probably in Minoan Crete", writes Mr. Hall,
"women played a greater part than they did even in Egypt, and it may
eventually appear that religious matters, perhaps even the government of
the State itself as well, were largely controlled by women. It is
certain they must have lived on a footing of greater equality with the
men than in any other ancient civilization, and we see in the frescoes
of Knossos conclusive indications of an open and easy association of men
and women, corresponding to our idea of 'Society', at the Minoan Court
unparalleled till our own day." <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md)
Among the goddess worshippers of Sumeria women enjoyed a high social
status also. But among the Semites of the god cult this was not the
case. Women were not depicted in Assyria as in Crete. It was when
Babylonian influences entered the Assyrian Court that Queen
Sammu-ramat--the Semiramis of tradition-rose into prominence. Professor
Sayce has drawn attention to the significant fact that when the Semites
translated the Sumerian hymns they transposed "women and men"
(equivalent to our "ladies and gentlemen") into "men and women". The law
of descent by the female line which obtained in Egypt and elsewhere
among peoples of the Mediterranean race was probably a relic of customs
which had a religious significance.

The view has been strongly advocated that in all primitive communities
matriarchal conditions preceded patriarchal conditions, and goddess
worship the worship of gods. It is not now generally accepted, however:
some peoples seem to have been worshippers of male

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

deities and others of female deities from the earliest times. The fusion
of the god and goddess cults in Egypt and Babylonia and elsewhere was
probably one of the results of the fusion of peoples. In some countries,
where patriarchal peoples formed military aristocracies, they may have
ordered succession by the male line. But there is also evidence to show
that they adopted the wiser method of marrying the heiresses of estates
and thrones to win the allegiance of the masses. "Mother-right"
prevailed in Egypt, for instance, until the end. The problem involved is
too complex to be accounted for by a single hypothesis.

It would appear that the activities of the Cretan women were chiefly
confined to indoor life. As in Egypt, they were depicted by painters
with white skins, while the men were, with the exception of princes,
given red skins. Women were also more elaborately attired and bejewelled
than men.

In dealing with ancient civilizations it is of importance to take note
of burial customs. There can be little doubt that these have been ever
closely associated with religious beliefs. What are known to
archæologists as "ceremonial burials" must have been performed, it is
reasonable to suppose, with some degree of ceremony with purpose either
to promote the welfare of the deceased or to secure the protection of
the living. The Dynastic Egyptians, for instance, mummified their dead
because they believed that the soul could not continue to exist in the
Otherworld unless the body were preserved intact in the tomb. On the
other hand, the Homeric Achæans burned their dead, so that the soul
might be transferred by fire to Hades, from which it would never again
return. <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) In pre-Dynastic Egypt the

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

body was laid in a shallow grave in crouched position, with
food-vessels, implements, and weapons beside it. A similar custom
prevailed in Babylonia and throughout Europe in the Neolithic and Bronze
Ages. Dwellers on the northern sea-coast of Europe set their dead adrift
in boats, as was Balder in the Eddic legend and Sceaf in the Beowulf
poem. Others buried their dead in caves, threw them to wild beasts, or
ate them.

In some cases it would appear that the beliefs connected with burial
were suggested by local phenomena. In Upper Egypt bodies are naturally
mummified in the hot dry sands. It is possible, therefore, that the
custom of embalming the dead may have grown up among that section of the
Egyptian people whose religious beliefs were formulated in the area
where the corpse was naturally preserved. They may have been horrified
to find that bodies did not remain intact in new districts to which they
migrated. But the custom of burning the dead cannot be explained in this
way.

Burial customs may not always afford us definite clues regarding
religious beliefs. It does not follow that the pre-Dynastic Egyptians,
the Babylonian Sumerians, and the Neolithic Europeans who favoured
crouched burials had all the same ideas regarding the destiny of men, or
the same beliefs regarding the Otherworld. Different conceptions might
be prevalent in a single country. It is found that in Wales, for
instance, ideas about the future state varied considerably. Folk-lore
and mediæval poetry have references to an Underworld in which the dead
continue to live in organized communities and work and fight as they
were accustomed to do upon earth, to happy islands situated far out to
sea, to fairy dwellings below rivers and lakes where souls exist like
fairies, and to the woods of Caledonia where shades wander about as did

<span id="page_xl">p. xl</span>

the ancestors of the people who migrated from Caledonia to Wales. In one
Welsh poem the Otherworld is referred to as "the cruel prison of the
earth, the abode of death, the loveless land". <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) The Babylonian Hades was similarly gloomy
and was similarly dreaded. Ishtar descends to--

The house out of which there is no exit . . .  
The house from whose entrance the light is taken,  
The place where dust is their (the souls') nourishment and their food
mud.  
Its chiefs are like birds covered with feathers.

But in pre-Dynastic Egypt the worshippers of Osiris, like a section of
the Welsh folks, believed that the Otherworld was a land of plenty in
which corn was sowed and crops reaped in season. A similar Paradise was
believed in as far north as Scotland. It is referred to in a Perthshire
fairy story. A midwife is taken to a fairy mound to nurse a fairy child,
and is given a green fluid with which to anoint the eyes of the little
one. The fairy woman moistens the right eye of the midwife with this
fluid, and bids her look. "She looked", the narrative proceeds, and saw
several of her friends and acquaintances at work, reaping the corn and
gathering the fruit. 'This', said the fairy, 'is the punishment of evil
deeds.'" <span id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md) In ancient Egypt the fairy
would have said it was "the reward of good deeds".

Burial customs afford us no exact evidence regarding these varying
beliefs, which grew up in localities and were imported from one country
to another. In Egypt the adherents of the cults of Osiris and Ra who
believed in different Paradises mummified their dead, although, in the
one case, happiness in the after state was believed to

<span id="page_xli">p. xli</span>

be the reward of good conduct n this life, and, in the other, of those
who by performing ceremonies obtained knowledge of the formulæ which
were the "Open Sesames" required by departed souls to secure admission
to the boat of the sun.

Similarly, it does not follow that the cremation custom had the same
significance at all periods. In the *Iliad* the ghost of Patroklos
declares that he will never again return from Hades when he has received
his meed of fire. Modern Hindus burn their dead, <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) but the soul may either depart to Paradise
or continue its round through other existences on this earth. In
Sanskrit literature the fire-god, Agni, "the corpse devourer", conducts
souls to the "land of the fathers". The Persian fire-worshippers do not
cremate their dead, although they may have done so at one time, but
expose them to be devoured by wild birds. Of special interest is the
practice of the Mongolian Buriats. The bodies of those who die in autumn
and winter are piled up in a log-house in the midst of a forest. When
the cuckoo begins to call, in May, this house is set on fire and the
accumulated bodies are cremated together. Persons who die during the
summer are burned immediately. <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md) That
the Aryo-Indians had knowledge at one time of the belief involved is
suggested by a reference in the *Mahabharata*. Describing the heaven of
Yama, the sage Narada says that he saw there "all sinners among human
beings as also (those) that have died during the winter solstice". <span
id="fr_26"></span>[3](#fn_26.md) The explanation may be that there were
lucky and unlucky hours, days, and months for death as for birth. The

<span id="page_xlii">p. xlii</span>

omens at birth which foretold an individual's fate were supposed to give
indication of his manner of death. One of the Scottish midwife
prophecies runs:

Full moon, full sea,  
Great man shalt thou be,  
But ill deith shalt thou dee. <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md)

Omens at death threw light on his fate in the after life. The Buriat
custom has evidently a long history behind it. Perhaps it was originally
believed that those who died in winter were doomed to exist ever
afterwards in cold and darkness. Such a belief imported into India would
in time cease to have any significance. The new country had new terrors
which supplanted the old, and influenced the development of religious
beliefs.

Among certain peoples who did not believe, like the Achæans, the
Aryo-Indians, and others, that the soul was transferred to Paradise
through the medium of fire, burning was a punishment. Erring wives in
ancient Egyptian and Scottish folk-tales are burned at the stake. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_28.md) Similarly, witches were burned alive. Sir
Arthur Evans has brought together interesting evidence regarding "the
revival of cremation in Europe in mediæval and modern times to get rid
of vampires". <span id="fr_29"></span>[3](#fn_29.md) Bodies of persons
whose ghosts had become vampires, which attacked sleepers and sucked the
life-blood from their veins, were taken from tombs and publicly burned.
The vampires were thus prevented from doing further harm. Herodotus
tells that when Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, caused the mummy of Pharaoh
Amasis to be burned, he displeased both the Persians and the Egyptians.
"The Persians", he says, "hold fire to be a god, and never by any chance
burn

<span id="page_xliii">p. xliii</span>

their dead. Indeed, this practice is unlawful, both with them and with
the Egyptians--with them for the reason above mentioned, since they deem
it wrong to give the corpse of a man to a god; and with the Egyptians,
because they believe fire to be a live animal, which eats whatever it
can seize, and then, glutted with the food, dies with the matter which
it feeds upon. Now, to give a man's body to be devoured by beasts is in
no wise agreeable to their customs, and, indeed, this is the very reason
why they embalm their dead, namely, to prevent them from being eaten in
the grave by worms." <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md)

The evidence afforded by the Cretan burial customs is of special
significance. From the earliest times until the close of the Bronze Age
the dead were buried. Then cremation was introduced by invaders, who are
believed to have been identical with the Achæans of Homer. The new
custom had, in this instance, not only a religious but an ethnic
significance.

Like certain of the Palæolithic tribes in western Europe, the early
Cretans buried their dead in caves and rock shelters. As caves were
dwellings, this was a form of house-burial. House-tombs have been found
in Cretan as in Babylonian towns. The custom is referred to in the
Ethiopic version of the mythical life of Alexander the Great. That hero
was reputed to have "asked one of the Brahmans, saying: 'Have ye no
tombs wherein to bury any man among you who may die?' And an interpreter
made answer to him, saying: 'Man and woman and child grow up, and arrive
at maturity and become old, and when any one (of them) dieth we bury him
in the place wherein he lived; thus our graves are our houses. And our
God knoweth that we desire this more than the lust for food and meat
which all men have; this

<span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span>

is our life and manner of dwelling in the darkness of our tombs.'" <span
id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) This conversation can never have taken
place in. India, but it is of interest in so far as it reflects a belief
with which the author was familiar.

In Palæolithic times a cave was deserted after the head of the family
was buried in it. There were also, however, burial-caves. The Cro-Magnon
people, for instance, sometimes deposited whole families, or the members
of tribes, in one of these. One cave has yielded no fewer than seventeen
skeletons. Caves and rock-shelters were similarly utilized in Crete. It
became customary, however, to construct chamber-tombs, which may have
been imitations of caves. One at Aghia Triadha, near Phæstos, in
south-central Crete, is some 30 feet in diameter. The remains of no
fewer than 200 skeletons of men, women, and children were found in it.
Other chambers adjoining added fifty to this number. Family tombs of
this kind, which were entered by narrow passages, were sometimes
circular, and developed into the beehive style of tomb found in Mycenæ
and Tiryns. They date back to early Minoan times (C. 2800 B.C.). Others
were of rectangular shape, like those found near Knossos. The Cretans
also buried their dead in terracotta chests, in which the bodies Jay in
crouched position as in the pre-Dynastic graves of Egypt. These
*larnakes* or sarcophagi were probably of Egyptian origin. They have
also been found in Sicily and Italy. Sometimes the Cretan sarcophagi
were profusely decorated. Like the tombs, they contained vessels, seals,
daggers, amulets, &c.

The Cretans were worshippers of the Great Mother goddess who inhabited
the abode of the buried dead. She was the Earth Mother. Caves were
entrances to the Underworld over which she presided. In Crete,

The thin plaster covering is painted with scenes connected with the cult
of the dead. (See pages

<span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span>

where no temples were erected, votive offerings were deposited in caves,
the most famous of which were those on Mount Dicte and Mount Ida.
According to Greek legend, the mother-goddess Rhea gave birth to Zeus in
a Cretan cave. The ferocious mother-goddesses of England and Scotland,
as is shown (Chapter III), were cave-dwellers. Palæolithic artists drew
and painted their magical figures of animals in the depths of great
caves.

Demeter of the Grecian Phigalia--the Black Ceres--lived in a cave, which
is still regarded as sacred. This deity, who is believed to be a form of
the Cretan Great Mother, was also associated with stone circles.
Pausanias, writing of the town of Hermione in the Peloponnese, says that
near it "there is a circle of huge unhewn stones, and inside this circle
they perform the sacred rites of Demeter". <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md)

Stone circles, single standing-stones, and groups of stones like those
at Carnac in Brittany were erected at burial-places. Offerings were made
to the dead whose spirits had become associated with the Earth Mother.
These spirits might be summoned from their tombs to make revelations.
When Odin visited the Underworld to consult the Vala (witch or
prophetess) regarding Balder's fate--

Round he rode to a door on the eastward  
Where he knew was a witch's grave,  
He sang there spells of the dead to the Vala,  
Needs she must rise-a corpse-and answer. <span
id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_33.md)

Folk-memories of the ancient custom of summoning the spirit of the dead
still survive in rural districts. An archæologist who recently conducted
investigations at a stone circle in northern Scotland asked a ploughman
if

<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span>

he knew anything regarding it. The answer was to this effect: "It is
said that if you walk round it three times against the sun at midnight,
you will raise the devil." Our demonology is the last stage of pagan
mythology. The summoning of the devil, or the spirits of the Underworld,
was a ceremony performed for purposes of divination, or to compel the
aid of infernal beings. As only one grave is sometimes found in stone
circles, it may be that a circle was erected when a great chief, or
great priest or priestess, died, so that the ghost might be propitiated
and called up to assist his or her kinsfolk in times of need. A
patriarch or teacher would thus be worshipped after death like a god,
and especially as a guide to the spirit world. The Babylonian Gilgamesh
was a hero who first entered the cave which led to Paradise. So was the
Indian Yama; he was the first man to "find the path for many", and he
became god of the dead. Osiris, as Apuatu, was "opener of the ways", and
similarly reigned in Hades. The Cretan Minos is in the Odyssey a
lawgiver, like Osiris, of the Underworld. In Greek mythology the guide
of travellers, who conducts the soul on his last journey, is Hermes. His
name appears to be derived from *herma*, which signifies a cairn or a
standing-stone. The Thracian "square Hermes" was a pillar surmounted by
a human head--a form which is evidently a link between a standing-stone
and the statue of an anthropomorphic deity. It may be that some of the
anthropomorphic deities were simply deified ancestors, priests, or
priestesses.

The Great Mother, who was worshipped by the Cretans and other
pre-Hellenic peoples in south-eastern Europe, was the goddess of birth
and death, of fertility and fate. As the ancestress of mankind she
gathered to her abode in the Underworld the ghosts of her progeny.

<span id="page_xlvii">p. xlvii</span>

She was the source of the food-supply, which she might withhold at will
by raising storms, causing floods, or sending blight and disease. It was
important that account should be taken of her varying moods--that her
intentions should be ascertained by means of oracles, so that she might
be propitiated, or controlled by the performance of magical ceremonies.
She assumed various forms at different seasons and under different
circumstances. Now she was the earth serpent, or the serpent of the
deep--the Babylonian Tiamat--and anon the raven of death, or the dove of
fertility; she might also appear as the mountain hag followed by savage
beasts, or as a composite monster in a gloomy cavern, like the
horse-headed Demeter of Phigalia. The beautiful northern goddess of the
Greek sculptors was a poetic creation of post-Homeric times, when her
benevolent character only was remembered. Still, Rhea ever retained her
lion, which crouched beside her throne--a faint memory of her ancient
savage character.

The Achæan conquerors who burned their dead were worshippers of the sky-
and thunder-god, the Great Father. They believed that the souls of the
dead ascended to a Paradise above the clouds. Hercules burned himself on
a pyre and fled heavenwards as an eagle; the soul of the Roman Emperor
ascended from the pyre on which his image was placed, on the back of an
eagle. The eagle was the messenger of Zeus, and the god himself may have
originally been an eagle. The Zu eagle of Babylonia and the Garuda eagle
of India were ancient deities; indeed, Tammuz, in his Nin-girsu form at
Lagash was depicted as a lion-headed eagle. Cyrus claimed to be an
Achæmenian--that is, a descendant of the patriarchal Akhamanish, who was
reputed to have been protected and fed during childhood by an eagle.

<span id="page_xlviii">p. xlviii</span>

The double-headed eagle of the Hittites, which now figures in the royal
arms of Russia, was a deity of great antiquity. In Egypt one Paradise
was the Underworld of Osiris and the other the Paradise above the sky to
which Horus ascended in the form of a falcon. Babylonian mythology makes
references to the Paradises of Anu and Bel and Ishtar, to which the
patriarch Etana ascends on the back of an eagle, as well as to the
island Paradise discovered by Gilgamesh and the gloomy Underworld where
souls eat dust and drink muddy water. So do the beliefs of mingled
peoples survive in complex mythologies.

The archæological evidence of Crete and Greece shows clearly that the
cremation custom had an ethnic significance. Whence then came the
Achæans of Homer who were the cremating people, or at any rate were
identified with them in tradition? Professor Ridgeway <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) has summarized a mass of important
archæological data regarding prehistoric burial customs, and writes:
"From this rapid survey it is now clear to the reader that cremation was
not developed in the countries lying around the Mediterranean, whilst on
the other hand it was already practised in Central Europe, possibly even
in the transition period from stone to bronze. But as the Achæans
practised it at least 1000 B.C., there is a very high probability that
they had come into Greece from Central Europe, where the fair-haired
peoples were certainly burning their dead before the end of the Bronze
Age, or at least 1200 B.C." He regards with favour the view that the
ancestors of the cremating Hindus--the Aryans and Indo-Europeans of the
philologists--migrated from Europe into Asia before the Iron Age.

The theory that the Achæans were a Germanic people

 

<span id="img__04800"></span> ![](img/_04800.jpg)

VOTIVE OFFERINGS FROM THE DICTEAN CAVE

The three upper rows are bronze objects: those in the two lower, are in

(See page xlv; also Chap. XIII, pages 297-299.)

 

<span id="page_xlix">p. xlix</span>

and that the cremation custom originated in the forests of Germany has
not received wide acceptance. Account must be taken of the archaic
cremation custom of the Mongolian Buriats which has been referred to. No
trace of seasonal burnings have been found in Europe. The Achæan dead
might be cremated at any time of the year. Were the ancestors of the
Buriats in touch at some remote period with a people among whom
cremation was practised before it obtained in Central Europe?

The earliest evidence yet obtained of cremation comes from southern
France. M. Verneau, who is the authority on the burial customs of the
Palæolithic cave-dwellers of Grimaldi, has found that among the
Cro-Magnon peoples of the Third Interglacial Period ceremonial interment
by inhumation was the general rule. He found, however, a single instance
of cremation. Offerings similar to those found with buried bodies were
associated with the burned bones. Of course, we know nothing about the
beliefs regarding the destiny of the soul which obtained among the
Cro-Magnon peoples. The majority of these, it may be noted, were tall,
averaging about 5 feet 10 inches in stature. M. Verneau, however,
discovered two skeletons of alien type which he refers to as members of
"a new race".

Next in chronological order, but separated by thousands of years, come
the Early Neolithic cremating people of Palestine who dwelt in the Gezer
caves. "One of the caves", writes Professor Macalister, "had evidently
been used by this people as a place for the disposal of the dead. The
body, placed at the sill of a chimney-aperture that provided a draught,
was burnt, the remains becoming ultimately scattered and trampled over
the whole surface of the floor. From one point of view

<span id="page_l">p. l</span>

this is unfortunate: the bones were too much destroyed by the action of
the fire to make any very extensive examination of their ethnological
character possible. All we can say is that we have to deal with a
non-Semitic race, of low stature, with thick skulls, and showing
evidence of the great muscular strength that is essential to savage
life." <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) We have no knowledge of the
beliefs connected with the Neolithic cremation custom in Palestine.

Among the Australian natives the body of the dead is sometimes cremated.
The ashes are afterwards placed in a skin bag which is carried about.
Various other funerary practices, including the eating of the corpse,
have been recorded. The belief regarding the soul's destiny, among the
Australian cremators, is neither Aryo-Indian nor Achæan in character.

The cremation custom of the Bronze Age had in Europe a precise
significance as a ceremony. It was not a punishment, or a safeguard
against attack by vampires, but a process whereby the souls of the dead
were enabled to pass to another state of existence. The cremating
invaders swept westward and north and south and formed military
aristocracies. In Sweden only the wealthy people were cremated. The
evidence of British archæology shows that cremation and inhumation were
practised in some districts simultaneously, and that even one
member--perhaps the chief--of a family might be cremated while the
others were buried. Ultimately cremation died out altogether in Ancient
Britain. The earlier faith prevailed. In southern Europe, however, it
lingered on until early Christian times, as did mummification in Egypt.
The fact that the Christians were opposed to these distinctive burial
customs emphasizes that they had a religious significance.

<span id="page_li">p. li</span>

Dr. Dörpfeld <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) has urged the
hypothesis that the Achæans burned their dead only when engaged in
distant wars, and practised inhumation in the homeland. He thinks that
cremation arose from the custom of scorching bodies prior to burial for
hygienic reasons.

No traces of partial burning have been found in the pre-Dynastic graves
of Egypt, or in the vast majority of similar graves in Europe. Dr.
Dörpfeld refers, however, to charred fragments found in tombs at Mycenæ
and elsewhere in support of his theory. Here again the evidence of Crete
is of special importance. In the tombs near Knossos have been found, in
addition to food vessels, clay chafing-pans and a plaster tripod, filled
with charcoal. These may have been portable hearths intended to warm and
comfort the dead, or may, on the other hand, have been utilized in
connection with magical rites. Deposits of charcoal are often found in
Bronze Age graves throughout Europe, and it is suggested that the food
intended for the nourishment of the dead was cooked in the grave. On the
other hand, the grave fire may have been lit to charm the corpse against
the attacks of evil spirits. As a rule, the charcoal deposits are not
very considerable. That fires were associated with early burials is
suggested by the folk-belief about "death lights" which are seen before
a sudden death takes place travelling along a highway, entering a
churchyard, and passing over the spot where a grave is to be opened.
Early burials took place at night, <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md)
and the leader may have cast his torch into the open grave so that it
might be used by the dead on the journey to the Otherworld. Hermes, the
guide of souls, was at one time a god of night and dispensed sleep and
dreams.

<span id="page_lii">p. lii</span>

The Cretan portable fire-vessels were, perhaps, substitutes for torches.
Lamps are also found in graves. The few partial burnings in the graves
of Mycenæ and elsewhere may have been due to accidents at burials. Of
course, it is also possible that the individuals met their deaths in
house fires.

It will be seen from the evidence passed under review that the theory of
the Germanic origin of the cremation custom is hardly conclusive.
Evidence may yet be forthcoming that it persisted somewhere in Europe or
Asia from Palæolithic times. The evidence afforded by the Gezer
cremation cave is suggestive in this connection. As cremation had during
the Bronze Age a distinct religious significance, the theory is possible
that it was an essential tenet of a cult formed by some great
teacher-like Buddha, Zoroaster, or Mohammed, who welded together his
followers by the strongest ties which bind humanity-the ties of a
religious faith and organization. The cremating peoples were conquerors.
They achieved ascendancy over the tribes of Indo-European speech who had
been migrating into northern India for several centuries between 2000
B.C. and 1200 B.C.; they have left traces of their influence in northern
Asia to the present day among the Mongolian Buriats, whose earth and air
spirits are called *Burkans* or "masters". In Europe they appear to have
subdued a considerable part of the Danubian cultural area, and formed
there, as elsewhere, a military aristocracy. It is uncertain whether
they owed their successes to superior organization or to the use of
iron. The Aryo-Indians, in Rig-Vedic times, used a metal called *ayas*,
a word which may have denoted bronze or iron, or both. In Brahmanic
times iron was called *syama ayas*, "swarthy ayas", or simply syama and
also *karsnayasa*, "black ayas", while copper or bronze was

<span id="page_liii">p. liii</span>

known as *lohayasa*, "red ayas". <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md) The
Homeric Achæans used bronze and iron, but the earlier bands of Achæans
who drifted into southern Greece and reached Crete used bronze only,
and, it is of significance to note, did not cremate their dead.
Possibly, therefore, the late Achæans were led by the cremating
intruders of Thrace and had adopted their religious beliefs, which they
fused with their own. Geometric pottery and iron weapons were introduced
into southern Greece when cremation began to be practised there.

The fusion of the various peoples who struggled for supremacy in Greece
before and during the early Hellenic period culminated in the growth of
its historic civilization. But the influence of its earliest culture,
that of Crete, ever remained. It first entered the Peloponnesian
peninsula, and although it was overshadowed there and elsewhere during
the long period of unrest which followed the Dorian invasion, it
continued to develop in contact with alien cultures in the Anatolian
colony of Ionia, which in turn proved to be "the little leaven which
leavened the whole lump" once again.

So far, nothing has been said regarding the evidence of language, of
which so much was made by the scholars of a past generation. But can
much really be said with certainty in this connection? The idea that the
peoples of Indo-European speech were of common racial origin and
inheritors of a common stock of religious beliefs no longer obtains.
"Language is shown by experience", as Mr. Hogarth says, "to be changed
by conquest more easily than type of civilization. . . . The Turkish
conquering minority (of Asia Minor) has imposed its tongue on the
aborigines of Ionia, Lydia, Phrygia, and Cappadocia alike.

<span id="page_liv">p. liv</span>

Yet the type of civilization and the fundamental cult-beliefs of the
people are not those of the true Turks." Referring to Greece, he says
that "later Greek speech may have been fundamentally mid-European,
largely contaminated with Ægean survivals; or it may have been
fundamentally Ægean with mid-European intrusions, as our own language is
fundamentally Anglo-Saxon largely contaminated by the speech of Norman
conquerors". <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md)

The chapters which follow begin with the Palæolithic Age in Pleistocene
times, and the reader is afterwards presented with a popular account of
the archaeological discoveries in Crete and Greece which have thrown so
much light on the growth of pre-Hellenic civilization. Classical
traditions are also drawn upon, and comparisons made between Cretan and
Greek deities. Comparative evidence is provided in dealing with the
growth and significance of primitive beliefs, and various theories which
have been advocated are either indicated or summarized. As environment
has ever had a formative influence in the development of religious
beliefs and in determining the habits of life of which these are an
expression, descriptions of natural scenery in various parts of the
Ægean area are given to enable the reader to visualize the conditions of
life under which pre-Hellenic civilization grew and flourished. In the
historical narrative the chief periods of the contemporary civilizations
of Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, and the land of the Hittites are noted,
and there are frequent references to early Cretan connections along the
trade routes, by land and sea, with the remote ancestors of the peoples
of the present day in Central and Western Europe.
