### XI

<span class="margnote">CHAP XI. His visits to the Magi</span><span
class="smallcaps">And</span> in just keeping with his visits to the
Arabians were the studies he undertook among the Persians also,
according to the account given by the same author. For after forbidding
Damis, so we are told, to go to the magi, though Damis was his only
pupil and companion, he went alone to school with them at midday and
about midnight; alone in order not to have as his companion in the study
of magic one who was clearly without a taste for such things. And again
when he came to converse with Vardan the Babylonian king, it is related
that he addressed him as follows: "My system of wisdom is that of <span
class="margnote">He professed the wisdom of Pythagoras</span>Pythagoras,
a man of Samos, who taught me to worship the gods in this way and to
recognize them, whether they are seen or unseen, and to be regular in
converse with the gods." Who can possibly allow

<span id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span id="page_513">p. 513</span>

this to be true of him, seeing that Pythagoras himself has left no
scripture of the kind, nor any secret writings, such that we can even
suspect him to have had such resources at his disposal? As for his
teacher of the Pythagorean philosophy, it is testified that he was in no
way better than the Epicureans by Philostratus himself, who speaks of
him as follows: "He had as a teacher of the system of Pythagoras not a
very good man, nor one who put his philosophy into practice; for he was
the slave of his belly and his desires and modelled his life on that of
Epicurus. And this man was Euxenus of Heraclea in Pontus. But he had a
good acquaintance with the tenets of Pythagoras, just as birds have of
what they learn to say from men." <span class="margnote">He learned from
no follower of Pythagoras</span>What ridiculous nonsense to pretend that
Apollonius can have derived from this man, his gift of conversing with
the gods. But let us for the moment admit that there were other
expounders of the system from whom he may have learned, although the
author anyhow gives no hint of any such thing. Still we must ask: was
there then ever any one of these teachers that professed either to know
himself, by having learnt from Pythagoras personally, or to teach
others, how to recognize and frequent in their conversations gods,
whether seen or unseen? Why, even the famous Plato, although more than
anyone else he shared in the philosophy of Pythagoras, and Archytas too,
and Philolaus the one man who has handed down to us in writing the
conversations of Pythagoras, and any others who were disciples of the
philosopher and have handed down to his posterity his opinions and
tenets in writing,—none of these ever boasted of any such form of
wisdom. It follows then that he learnt

<span id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span id="page_515">p. 515</span>

these things not from Pythagoras, but from other sources; and with a
wilful affectation of solemnity he only labels himself with the
philosopher's name. But admitting, though it is against all probability,
that he is not lying, but telling the truth, we are still at a loss to
know, how he can pretend to have acquired this lore from the Samian
himself above mentioned, inasmuch as the latter deceased some thousand
years before him. Therefore we must reckon besides the Arabians this
teacher also who communicated to him a knowledge of the gods of so
mysterious character as he imagines this to be. If then he was of a
divine nature, it follows that the story of his teachers is a pure
fiction. On the other hand if the story was true, then the legend was
false, and the allegation in the book that he was divine is devoid of
all truth.

### XII

<span class="margnote">CHAP XII Eusebius will accept all that is
probable</span><span class="smallcaps">I have</span> no wish to enquire
curiously about the ghost of Proteus, or to ask for confirmation of it,
nor to demand proof of his ridiculous story that swans surrounded his
mother and assisted her to bring him into the world; equally little do I
ask him to produce evidence of his fairy-tale about the thunderbolt; for
as I said before he cannot anyhow claim the authority of Damis for these
particulars, inasmuch as the latter joined him much later on in the city
of Nineveh of Assyria. I am however quite ready to accept all that is
probable and has an air of truth about it, even though such details may
be somewhat exaggerated and highly-coloured out of

<span id="page_516">p. 516</span> <span id="page_517">p. 517</span>

compliment to a good man; for I could still bring myself to accept them,
as long as they are not bewilderingly wonderful and full of nonsense. I
do not therefore mind the author telling us that Apollonius was of an
ancient family and lineally descended from the first settlers, and was
rich, if it were so, beyond all other people of that region; and that
when he was young he not only had the distinguished teachers mentioned,
but, if he likes, I will allow that he became himself their teacher and
master in learning. I grant too, in addition, that he was skilful in
ordinary matters, and so was able by giving the best of advice to rid of
his malady one who had come to the temple of Asclepius in order to be
healed. For we read that he suggested to a man afflicted with dropsy a
régime of abstinence well suited to cure his disease, and in that way
restored him to health: and so far we must needs commend the youthful
Apollonius for his good sense. On another occasion he very properly
excluded from the temple a man who was notorious for his wickedness,
although he was prepared to offer the most expensive sacrifices, for he
represents the man in question as the richest and most distinguished of
all the people of his region. Nor would anyone object to his being
classed among the temperate, inasmuch as he repelled with insults a
lover who designed to corrupt his youth, and also, as the narrative
informs us, kept himself throughout pure of intercourse with women.

We can also believe the story of his keeping silence for five years in
the spirit of Pythagoras; and the way moreover in which he accomplished
this vow of silence was praiseworthy. All this and the like

<span id="page_518">p. 518</span> <span id="page_519">p. 519</span>

is merely human, and in no way incongruous with philosophy or with
truth, and I can therefore accept it, because I set a very high value
upon candour and love of truth. Nevertheless to suppose that he was a
being of superhuman nature, and then to contradict this supposition at a
moment's warning, and to forget it almost as soon as it is made—this I
regard as reprehensible and calculated to fasten a suspicion not only on
the author, but yet more on the subject of his memoir.

### XIII

<span class="margnote">CHAP. XIII Criticisms of the second book of
Philostratus</span><span class="smallcaps">These</span> particulars we
have taken from the first book of Philostratus; and let us now go on to
consider the contents of the second. The story takes him on his travels
and brings him from Persia to India. He next shows a want of good taste
by relating, as if it were a miracle, how Apollonius and his companions
saw some sort of demon, to which he gives the name of Empusa, along the
road, and of how they drove it away by dint of abuse and bad words. And
we learn that when some animals were offered them for food, he told
Damis that he was quite willing to allow him and his companions to eat
the flesh, for as far as he could see their abstinence from meat had in
no way advanced their moral development, though in his own case it was
imposed by the philosophic profession he had made in childhood. And yet
is it not incredible to anyone that he should not have hindered Damis,
as his best friend, and as the only disciple and follower of his life
that he had, and the

<span id="page_520">p. 520</span> <span id="page_521">p. 521</span>

only one whom he was trying to convert to his philosophy, that he should
not, I repeat, have tried to hinder him from consuming the flesh of
living animals, that being an unholy food according to Pythagoras, and
that instead of doing so, he should tell him for reasons inexplicable to
me that it will do no good to himself, and admit that he saw no moral
advantage in them produced by such abstinence?

### XIV

<span class="margnote">CHAP. XIV</span><span class="smallcaps">In</span>
the next place I would have you notice what sort of samples of truth are
set before us by this Philostratus to whose truthfulness Hierocles the
self-styled Lover of Truth bears witness. For we are told that when
Apollonius was among the Indians, he employed an interpreter, and
through him held the conversation with Phraotes, for that was the name
of the king of the Indians. Thus he, who just before, according to
Philostratus, had an understanding of all languages, now on the
contrary, according to the same witness, is in need of an interpreter.
And again, he who read the thoughts of men, and almost like their god
Apollo

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Understood the dumb and heard him who spake not"

</div>

has to ask, by means of an interpreter, what was the king's way of life,
and he asks him to supply him with a guide on his journey to the
Brahmans. And after an interval the other, who is king of the Indians,
and a barbarian to boot, gets rid of the interpreter, and addresses
Apollonius in Greek; and speaking in that language details to him his
education and

<span id="page_522">p. 522</span> <span id="page_523">p. 523</span>

his wealth of learning. But Apollonius none the less neglected on this
occasion to display, as he should have done, his own perfect
acquaintance with their tongue.

### XV

<span class="margnote">CHAP. XV Eusebius ridicules the prescience of
Apollonius</span><span class="smallcaps">On</span> the contrary he is
astonished to find the Indian talking Greek, as Philostratus
consistently, it would seem, with himself, tells us in his book. For how
could he be astonished thereat, unless he had regarded him as a
barbarian? And in spite of his having admired him for what he was, he
could never have expected him to talk Greek. In the sequel, as if he
were astonished at some exhibition of the miraculous and were still
unable to explain it, Apollonius says: "Tell me, O king, how you came to
have such facility in the Greek tongue? And where did you get hereabouts
the philosophy you possess? For I do not think that you can say you owe
it to teachers anyhow, for it is not likely that the Indians have any
teachers of this." Such are the wonderful utterances to which one, whose
prescience included everything, gives vent; and the king answers them by
saying that he had had teachers, and he tells him who they were, and
relates all the particulars of his own history on his father's side.

Next we are told that the Indian had to judge between certain parties
about a treasure which had been hunted up in a field, the question • at
issue being whether this field ought to be assigned to the seller or
buyer of the place. Our supreme philosopher and darling of heaven is
asked his opinion, and awards it to the purchaser, assigning his reason
in these words:

<span id="page_524">p. 524</span> <span id="page_525">p. 525</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "That the gods
would never have deprived the one of the land, if he had not been a bad
man; nor would ever have given the other riches under the soil, unless
he had been better than the seller." We must conclude then, if we are to
believe him, that men who are comfortably off and richer than their
neighbours, are to be esteemed thrice happy and beloved of the gods,
even though they should be the most shameless and abandoned of mankind;
on the other hand only the poorest, say, even a Socrates, or a Diogenes,
or the famous Pythagoras himself, or any other of the most temperate and
fairest-minded of men, are to be esteemed ill-starred wretches. For if
one follows the reasoning here used, one must allow that on its showing
the gods would never have deprived the poor, that is to say, the very
men who excel others, if judged by the standard of philosophy, even of a
bare living and of the necessities of life, unless they had been utterly
vile in character, and at the same time they have endowed those who are
abandoned in their character with a plenty even of things that were not
necessary to them, unless they proved themselves better than the others
just mentioned; from which the absurdity of the conclusion is manifest
to everyone.

### XVI

<span class="margnote">CHAP. XVI Absurdities in the third
book</span><span class="smallcaps">After</span> setting before you these
incidents out of the second book, let us pass on to the third, and
consider the stories told of the far-famed Brahmans. For here we shall
have to admit that the tales of Thule, and any other miraculous legends
ever invented

<span id="page_526">p. 526</span> <span id="page_527">p. 527</span>

by any story-tellers, turn out to be by comparison with these quite
reliable and perfectly true. It is anyhow worth our while to examine
these, because this self-styled lover of truth has not scrupled to
fasten on ourselves a charge of reckless credulity and levity of
character, while claiming for himself and for those like him an accurate
judgment, well based on an understanding of the fact. Note then the sort
of miracles on which he prides himself, when he prefers Philostratus to
our own divine evangelists, on the ground that he was not only a most
highly educated man, but most attentive to the truth.

### XVII

<span class="margnote">CHAP XVII Ridicules the tales of the
Brahmans</span><span class="smallcaps">To</span> begin with then, on the
way to the Brahmans, Philostratus introduces us to a lady who met
Apollonius, and who, from her head down to her loins, was wholly white
in colour, while the rest of her person was black. The mountains again,
as they went forward on the road to the Brahmans, were planted with
pepper trees, and the apes cultivated the same; and then there were
certain dragons of extraordinary size, from whose heads were thrown off
sparks of fire, and if you slew one of them, he says that you found
marvellous stones upon the head rivalling the gem of Gyges, as mentioned
in Plato. And all this was before they reached the hill on which the
Brahmans lived. And when they reached this, we read that they saw there
a well of sandarac, full of wonderful water, and hard by a crater of
fire, from which there arose a lead-coloured flame; and

<span id="page_528">p. 528</span> <span id="page_529">p. 529</span>

there were two jars there of black stone, the one of which contained
rain, and the other winds, from which the Brahmans supply such people of
the country as they are pleased to favour. Besides this they found among
them images of Athene Polias and of Apollo Pythius, and of Dionysus of
the Lake and of certain other Hellenic gods. And the master of them all
was named Iarchas, and they saw him sitting on a very lofty throne in a
state of pomp that was far from philosophic, but rather appropriate to a
satrap. And this throne was made of black bronze and was decorated with
golden images, such as we might of course expect philosophers to
fabricate when they take to working like base mechanics at forge and
steel, even if they do not like conjurers make their handiwork to move
by itself. But the thrones upon which the rest of them, who were
inferior teachers to him, were sitting, were, he says, of bronze, but
not incised and not so high. For I suppose they could not help bestowing
upon the teacher of so divine a philosophy the privilege of having
images and gold on his throne, just as if he were a tyrant.

### XVIII

<span class="margnote">CHAP. XVIII Prescience and pride of
Iarchas</span><span class="smallcaps">And</span> we are told that
Iarchas, the moment he saw Apollonius, addressed him by name in the
Greek tongue, and asked him for the letter which he brought from
Phraotes, for he had already received this by dint of his foreknowledge;
and by way of parading the inspired character of his prescience, he told
him before he set eyes on the epistle, that it was one letter short,
namely of a *delta*; and he began

<span id="page_530">p. 530</span> <span id="page_531">p. 531</span>

at once in a vulgar manner in that very first interview, like a man who
has got wealth for the first time and does not know how to use it, to
show off his superiority as a seer, by running off the names of
Apollonius’ father and mother, and telling him all about his family and
upbringing and education, and about his periodical voyages abroad, and
about his journey thither to himself, and about what he had done himself
or said to his companions on the road. And next this wonderful author
tells us that the Brahmans, after anointing themselves together with
Apollonius with an amber-like drug, took a bath, and then standing round
as if in chorus, struck the earth with their staves, and the earth
arched itself up and elevated them some two cubits into the air, so that
they stood there levitated up in the air itself for some considerable
length of time. And he relates that they drew down fire from the sun
without any effort on their part and whenever they chose. And the
miracle-monger adds another marvel to these, when he tells that there
were four tripods like those of Pytho which wheeled themselves forth,
moving of their own accord; and he goes so far as to compare these to
the tripods in Homer, and he says that there were set upon them
cup-bearers to serve in the banquet, four in number and made of bronze.
And in addition he tells us that the earth too strewed grass beneath
them of her own accord and unasked. And of these tripods two, he says,
ran with wine, and of the other two, the one supplied hot water and the
other cold. And the cup-bearers of bronze drew for the guests in due
mixture both the wine and the water, and pushed round the cups in a
circle, just as they are handed round in a symposium.

<span id="page_532">p. 532</span> <span id="page_533">p. 533</span>

### XIX

<span class="margnote">CHAP. XIX Credulity of Hierocles</span><span
class="smallcaps">Such</span> are the stories which Hierocles, who has,
been entrusted to administer the supreme courts of justice all over the
province, finds true and reliable after due enquiry, at the same time
that he condemns us for our excessive credulity and frivolity; and after
himself believing such things when he finds them in Philostratus, he
proceeds to brag about himself and says (I quote his very words): "Let
us anyhow observe how much better and more cautiously we accept such
things, and what opinion we hold of men gifted with such powers and
virtues."

### XX

<span class="margnote">CHAP XX Drinking bouts of the
Brahmans</span><span class="smallcaps">It</span> was after such a
symposium, according to the same Philostratus, that a king who was
sojourning in India is introduced to drink with the philosophers; and we
hear that he took occasion to insult philosophy with drunken jests, and
that he got so tipsy in their presence as to hurl defiance at the Sun
and brag about himself. All this we learn, and that Apollonius once
more, by means of an interpreter, learned his history from him and
conversed in turn with him, Iarchas interpreting between them. Surely it
may well excite our wonder that so insolent a fellow and so great a
buffoon was allowed to get drunk and show off his tipsy wit among such
great philosophers, when he was unworthy even to be present at a meeting
of philosophers, much less at the hearth of men who were equal to gods?
But what possesses me to call them the peers of gods and

<span id="page_534">p. 534</span> <span id="page_535">p. 535</span>

chaff them about their dignity? Why, when Apollonius asked them whom
they considered themselves to be, <span class="margnote">The peers the
gods.</span>"Gods," answered Iarchas; who, I suppose in his quality as
god, as little as could be in the style of philosopher, save the mark,
nay, surely betraying an equally scant respect for the dignity of the
god whom he professed himself to be, set the example of drinking to his
fellow-banqueters by stooping down over the bowl, which, as our author
is careful to tell us, supplied plenty of drink for all of them, and
refreshed itself, as do holy and mysterious well for those who fill
their pitchers from them.
