### SECTION IV

#### THE APOLLONIUS OF EARLY OPINION

<span class="smallcaps">Apollonius</span> of Tyana <span
id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1.md) was the most famous philosopher of the
Græco-Roman world of the first century, and devoted the major part of
his long life to the purification of the many cults of the Empire and to
the instruction of the ministers and priests of its religions. With the
exception of the Christ no more interesting personage appears upon the
stage of Western history in these early years. Many and various and
oft-times mutually contradictory are the opinions which have been held
about Apollonius, for the account of his life which has come down to us
is in the guise of a romantic story rather than in the form of a plain
history. And this is perhaps to some extent to be expected, for
Apollonius, besides his public teaching, had a life apart, a life into
which even his favourite disciple does

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

not enter. He journeys into the most distant lands, and is lost to the
world for years; he enters the shrines of the most sacred temples and
the inner circles of the most exclusive communities, and what he says or
does therein remains a mystery, or serves only as an opportunity for the
weaving of some fantastic story by those who did not understand.

The following study will be simply an attempt to put before the reader a
brief sketch of the problem which the records and traditions of the life
of the famous Tyanean present; but before we deal with the Life of
Apollonius, written by Flavius Philostratus at the beginning of the
third century, we must give the reader a brief account of the references
to Apollonius among the classical writers and the Church Fathers, and. a
short sketch of the literature of the subject in more recent times, and
of the varying fortunes of the war of opinion concerning his life in the
last four centuries.

First, then, with regard to the references in classical and patristic
authors. Lucian, the witty writer of the first half of the second
century, makes the subject of one of his satires the pupil of a disciple
of Apollonius, of one of those who were acquainted with "all the
tragedy" <span id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2.md) of his life. And Appuleius,
a contemporary of Lucian, classes

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Apollonius with
Moses and Zoroaster, and other famous Magi of antiquity. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3.md)

About the same period, in a work entitled Quæstiones et Responsiones ad
Orthodoxos, formerly attributed to Justin Martyr, who flourished in the
second quarter of the second century, we find the following interesting
statement:

"Question 24: If God is the maker and master of creation, how do the
consecrated objects <span id="fr_4"></span>[†](#fn_4.md) of Apollonius have
power in the \[various\] orders of that creation? For, *as we see*, they
check the fury of the waves and the power of the winds and the inroads
of vermin and attacks of wild beasts." <span id="fr_5"></span>[‡](#fn_5.md)

Dion Cassius in his history, <span id="fr_6"></span>[§](#fn_6.md) which he
wrote <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 211-222, states that Caracalla
(Emp. 211-216) honoured the memory of Apollonius with a chapel or
monument (*heroum*).

It was just at this time (216) that Philostratus composed his Life of
Apollonius, at the request of Domna Julia, Caracalla's mother, and it is
with this document principally that we shall have to deal in the sequel.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

Lampridius, who flourished about the middle of the third century,
further informs us that Alexander Severus (Emp. 222-235) placed the
statue of Apollonius in his *lararium* together with those of Christ,
Abraham, and Orpheus. <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7.md)

Vopiscus, writing in the last decade of the third century, tells us that
Aurelian (Emp. 270-275) vowed a temple to Apollonius, of whom he had
seen a vision when besieging Tyana. Vopiscus speaks of the Tyanean as "a
sage of the most wide-spread renown and authority, an ancient
philosopher, and a true friend of the Gods," nay, as a manifestation of
deity. "For what among men," exclaims the historian, "was more holy,
what more worthy of reverence, what more venerable, what more god-like
than he? He, it was, who gave life to the dead. He, it was, who did and
said so many things beyond the power of men." <span
id="fr_8"></span>[†](#fn_8.md) So enthusiastic is Vopiscus about
Apollonius, that he promises, if he lives, to write a short account of
his life in Latin, so that his deeds and words may be on the tongue of
all, for as yet the only accounts are in Greek. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[‡](#fn_9.md) Vopiscus, however, did not fulfil his
promise, but

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

we learn that about this date both Soterichus <span
id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md) and Nichomachus wrote Lives of our
philosopher, and shortly afterwards Tascius Victorianus, working on the
papers of Nichomachus, <span id="fr_11"></span>[†](#fn_11.md) also composed
a Life. None of these Lives, however, have reached us.

It was just at this period also, namely, in the last years of the third
century and the first years of the fourth, that Porphyry and Iamblichus
composed their treatises on Pythagoras and his school; both mention
Apollonius as one of their authorities, and it is probable that the
first 30 sections of Iamblichus are taken from Apollonius. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[‡](#fn_12.md)

We now come to an incident which hurled the character of Apollonius into
the arena of Christian polemics, where it has been tossed about until
the present day. Hierocles, successively governor of Palmyra, Bithynia,
and Alexandria, and a philosopher, about the year 305 wrote a criticism
on the claims of the Christians, in two books,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

called A Truthful Address to the Christians, or more shortly The
Truth-lover. He seems to have based himself for the most part on the
previous works of Celsus and Porphyry, <span
id="fr_13"></span>[\*](#fn_13.md) but introduced a new subject of
controversy by opposing the wonderful works of Apollonius to the claims
of the Christians to exclusive right in "miracles" as proof of the
divinity of their Master. In this part of his treatise Hierocles used
Philostratus’ Life of Apollonius.

To this pertinent criticism of Hierocles Eusebius of Cæsarea immediately
replied in a treatise still extant, entitled Contra Hieroclem. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[†](#fn_14.md) Eusebius admits that Apollonius was a wise
and virtuous man, but denies that there is sufficient proof that the
wonderful things ascribed to him ever took place; and even if they did
take place, they were the work of "dæmons," and not of God. The treatise
of Eusebius is interesting; he severely scrutinises the statements in
Philostratus, and shows himself possessed of a first rate critical

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

faculty. Had he only used the same faculty on the documents of the
Church, of which he was the first historian, posterity would have owed
him an eternal debt of gratitude. But Eusebius, like so many other
apologists, could only see one side; justice, when anything touching
Christianity was called into question, was a stranger to his mind, and
he would have considered it blasphemy to use his critical faculty on the
documents which relate the "miracles" of Jesus. Still the problem of
"miracle" was the same, as Hierocles pointed out, and remains the same
to this day.

After the controversy reincarnated again in the sixteenth century, and
when the hypothesis of the "Devil" as the prime-mover in all "miracles"
but those of the Church lost its hold with the progress of scientific
thought, the nature of the wonders related in the Life of Apollonius was
still so great a difficulty that it gave rise to a new hypothesis of
plagiarism. The life of Apollonius was a Pagan plagiarism of the life of
Jesus. But Eusebius and the Fathers who followed him had no suspicion of
this; they lived in times when such an assertion could have been easily
refuted. There is not a word in Philostratus to show he had any
acquaintance with the life of Jesus, and fascinating as Baur's
"tendency-writing" theory is to many, we can only say that

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

as a plagiarist of the Gospel story Philostratus is a conspicuous
failure. Philostratus writes the history of a good and wise man, a man
with a mission of teaching, clothed in the wonder stories preserved in
the memory and embellished by the imagination of fond posterity, but not
the drama of incarnate Deity as the fulfilment of world-prophecy.

Lactantius, writing about 315, also attacked the treatise of Hierocles,
who seems to have put forward some very pertinent criticisms; for the
Church Father says that he enumerates so many of their Christian inner
teachings (*intima*) that sometimes he would seem to have at one time
undergone the same training (*disciplina*). But it is in vain, says
Lactantius, that Hierocles endeavours to show that Apollonius performed
similar or even greater deeds than Jesus, for Christians do not believe
that Christ is God because he did wonderful things, but because all the
things wrought in him were those which were announced by the
prophets. <span id="fr_15"></span>[\*](#fn_15.md) And in taking this ground
Lactantius saw far more clearly than Eusebius the weakness of the proof
from "miracle."

Arnobius, the teacher of Lactantius, however, writing at the end of the
third century, before

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

the controversy, in referring to Apollonius simply classes him among
Magi, such as Zoroaster and others mentioned in the passage of Appuleius
to which we have already referred. <span id="fr_16"></span>[\*](#fn_16.md)

But even after the controversy there is a wide difference of opinion
among the Fathers, for although at the end of the fourth century John
Chrysostom with great bitterness calls Apollonius a deceiver and
evil-doer, and declares that the whole of the incidents in his life are
unqualified fiction, <span id="fr_17"></span>[†](#fn_17.md) Jerome, on the
contrary, at the very same date, takes almost a favourable view, for,
after perusing Philostratus, he writes that Apollonius found everywhere
something to learn and something whereby he might become a better
man. <span id="fr_18"></span>[‡](#fn_18.md)

At the beginning of the fifth century also Augustine, while ridiculing
any attempt at comparison between Apollonius and Jesus, says that the
character of the Tyanean was "far superior" to that ascribed to Jove, in
respect of virtue. <span id="fr_19"></span>[§](#fn_19.md)

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

About the same date also we find Isidorus of Pelusium, who died in 450,
bluntly denying that there is any truth in the claim made by "certain,"
whom he does not further specify, that Apollonius of Tyana "consecrated
many spots in many parts of the world for the safety of the
inhabitants." <span id="fr_20"></span>[\*](#fn_20.md) It is instructive to
compare the denial of Isidorus with the passage we have already quoted
from Pseudo-Justin. The writer of Questions and Answers to the Orthodox
in the second century could not dispose of the question by a blunt
denial; he had to admit it and argue the case on other grounds—namely,
the agency of the Devil. Nor can the argument of the Fathers, that
Apollonius used magic to bring about his results, while the untaught
Christians could perform healing wonders by a single word, <span
id="fr_21"></span>[†](#fn_21.md) be accepted as valid by the unprejudiced
critic, for there is no evidence to support the contention that
Apollonius employed such methods for his wonder-workings; on the
contrary, both Apollonius himself and his biographer Philostratus
strenuously repudiate the charge of magic brought against him.

On the other hand, a few years later, Sidonius Apollinaris, Bishop of
Claremont, speaks in the

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

highest terms of Apollonius. Sidonius translated the Life of Apollonius
into Latin for Leon, the councillor of King Euric, and in writing to his
friend he says: "Read the life of a man who (religion apart) resembles
you in many things; a man sought out by the rich, yet who never sought
for riches; who loved wisdom and despised gold; a man frugal in the
midst of feastings, clad in linen in the midst of those clothed in
purple, austere in the midst of luxury. . . . In fine, to speak plainly,
perchance no historian will find in ancient times a philosopher whose
life is equal to that of Apollonius." <span
id="fr_22"></span>[\*](#fn_22.md)

Thus we see that even among the Church Fathers opinions were divided;
while among the philosophers themselves the praise of Apollonius was
unstinted.

For Ammianus Marcellinus, "the last subject of Rome who composed a
profane history in the Latin language," and the friend of Julian the
philosopher-emperor, refers to the Tyanean as "that most renowned
philosopher"; <span id="fr_23"></span>[†](#fn_23.md) while a few years
later Eunapius, the pupil of Chrysanthius, one of the teachers of
Julian, writing in the last years of the fourth century, says that

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Apollonius was
more than a philosopher; he was "a middle term, as it were, between gods
and men." <span id="fr_24"></span>[\*](#fn_24.md) Not only was Apollonius
an adherent of the Pythagorean philosophy, but "he fully exemplified the
more divine and practical side in it." In fact Philostratus should have
called his biography "The Sojourning of a God among Men." <span
id="fr_25"></span>[†](#fn_25.md) This seemingly wildly exaggerated estimate
may perhaps receive explanation in the fact that Eunapius belonged to a
school which knew the nature of the attainments ascribed to Apollonius.

Indeed, "as late as the fifth century we find one Volusian, a proconsul
of Africa, descended from an old Roman family and still strongly
attached to the religion of his ancestors, almost worshipping Apollonius
of Tyana as a supernatural being." <span id="fr_26"></span>[‡](#fn_26.md)

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

Even after the downfall of philosophy we find Cassiodorus, who spent the
last years of his long life in a monastery, speaking of Apollonius as
the "renowned philosopher." <span id="fr_27"></span>[\*](#fn_27.md) So also
among Byzantine writers, the monk George Syncellus, in the eighth
century, refers several times to our philosopher, and not only without
the slightest adverse criticism, but he declares that he was the first
and most remarkable of all the illustrious people who appeared under the
Empire. <span id="fr_28"></span>[†](#fn_28.md) Tzetzes also, the critic and
grammarian, calls Apollonius "all-wise and a fore-knower of all
things." <span id="fr_29"></span>[‡](#fn_29.md)

And though the monk Xiphilinus, in the eleventh century, in a note to
his abridgment of the history of Dion Cassius, calls Apollonius a clever
juggler and magician, <span id="fr_30"></span>[§](#fn_30.md) nevertheless
Cedrenus in the same century bestows on Apollonius the not
uncomplimentary title of an "adept Pythagorean philosopher," <span
id="fr_31"></span>[\*\*](#fn_31.md) and relates several instances of the
efficacy of his powers

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

in Byzantium. In fact, if we can believe Nicetas, as late as the
thirteenth century there were at Byzantium certain bronze doors,
formerly consecrated by Apollonius, which had to be melted down because
they had become an object of superstition even for the Christians
themselves. <span id="fr_32"></span>[\*](#fn_32.md)

Had the work of Philostratus disappeared with the rest of the Lives, the
above would be all that we should have known about Apollonius. <span
id="fr_33"></span>[†](#fn_33.md) Little enough, it is true, concerning so
distinguished a character, yet ample enough to show that, with the
exception of theological prejudice, the suffrages of antiquity were all
on the side of our philosopher.
