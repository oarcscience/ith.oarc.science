### SECTION II

#### THE RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATIONS AND COMMUNITIES OF THE FIRST CENTURY

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the domain of religion it is quite
true that the state cults and national institutions throughout the
Empire were almost without exception in a parlous state, and it is to be
noticed that Apollonius devoted much time and labour to reviving and
purifying them. Indeed, their strength had long left the general
state-institutions of religion, where all was now perfunctory; but so
far from there being no religious life in the land, in proportion as the
official cultus and ancestral institutions afforded no real satisfaction
to their religious needs, the more earnestly did the people devote
themselves to private cults, and eagerly baptised themselves in all that
flood of religious enthusiasm which flowed in with ever increasing
volume from the East. Indubitably in all this fermentation there were
many excesses, according to our present notions of religious decorum,
and also grievous

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

abuses; but at the same time in it many found due satisfaction for their
religious emotions, and, if we except those cults which were distinctly
vicious, we have to a large extent before us in popular circles the
spectacle of what, in their last analysis, are similar phenomena to
those enthusiasms which in our own day may be frequently witnessed among
such sects as the Shakers or Ranters, and at the general revival
meetings of the uninstructed.

It is not, however, to be thought that the private cults and the doings
of the religious associations were all of this nature or confined to
this class; far from it. There were religious brotherhoods, communities,
and clubs—*thiasi*, *erani*, and *orgeōnes*—of all sorts and conditions.
There were also mutual benefit societies, burial clubs, and dining
companies, the prototypes of our present-day Masonic bodies, Oddfellows,
and the rest. These religious associations were not only private in the
sense that they were not maintained by the State, but also for the most
part they were private in the sense that what they did was kept secret,
and this is perhaps the main reason why we have so defective a record of
them.

Among them are to be numbered not only the lower forms of mystery-cultus
of various kinds, but also the greater ones, such as the

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Phrygian, Bacchic,
Isiac, and Mithriac Mysteries, which were spread everywhere throughout
the Empire. The famous Eleusinia were, however, still under the ægis of
the State, but though so famous were, as a state-cultus, far more
perfunctory.

It is, moreover, not to be thought that the great types of
mystery-cultus above mentioned were uniform even among themselves. There
were not only various degrees and grades within them, but also in all
probability many forms of each line of tradition, good, bad, and
indifferent. For instance, we know that it was considered *de rigueur*
for every respectable citizen of Athens to be initiated into the
Eleusinia, and therefore the tests could not have been very stringent;
whereas in the most recent work on the subject, De Apuleio Isiacorum
Mysteriorum Teste (Leyden; 1900), Dr. K. H. E. De Jong shows that in one
form of the Isiac Mysteries the candidate was invited to initiation by
means of dream; that is to say, he had to be psychically impressionable
before his acceptance.

Here, then, we have a vast intermediate ground for religious exercise
between the most popular and undisciplined forms of private cults and
the highest forms, which could only be approached through the discipline
and training of the philosophic life. The higher side of these

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

mystery-institutions aroused the enthusiasm of all that was best in
antiquity, and unstinted praise was given to one or another form of them
by the greatest thinkers and writers of Greece and Rome; so that we
cannot but think that here the instructed found that satisfaction for
their religious needs which was necessary not only for those who could
not rise into the keen air of pure reason, but also for those who had
climbed so high upon the heights of reason that they could catch a
glimpse of the other side. The official cults were notoriously unable to
give them this satisfaction, and were only tolerated by the instructed
as an aid for the people and a means of preserving the traditional life
of the city or state.

By common consent the most virtuous livers of Greece were the members of
the Pythagorean schools, both men and women. After the death of their
founder the Pythagoreans seem to have gradually blended with the Orphic
communities, and the "Orphic life" was the recognised term for a life of
purity and self-denial. We also know that the Orphics, and therefore the
Pythagoreans, were actively engaged in the reformation, or even the
entire reforming, of the Baccho-Eleusinian rites; they seem to have
brought back the pure side of the Bacchic cult with their reinstitution
or reimportation of the Iacchic

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

mysteries, and it is very evident that such stern livers and deep
thinkers could not have been contented with a low form of cult. Their
influence also spread far and wide in general Bacchic circles, so that
we find Euripides putting the following words into the mouth of a chorus
of Bacchic initiates: "Clad in white robes I speed me from the genesis
of mortal men, and never more approach the vase of death, for I have
done with eating food that ever housed a soul." <span
id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) Such words could well be put into the mouth
of a Brahman or Buddhist ascetic, eager to escape from the bonds of
Saṁsāra; and such men cannot therefore justly be classed together
indiscriminately with ribald revellers—the general mind-picture of a
Bacchic company.

But, some one may say, Euripides and the Pythagoreans and Orphics are no
evidence for the first century; whatever good there may have been in
such schools and communities, it had ceased long before. On the
contrary, the evidence is all against this objection. Philo, writing
about 25 <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>, tells us that in his day
numerous groups of men, who in all respects led this life of religion,
who abandoned their property, retired from the world and devoted
themselves entirely to the search for wisdom and the cultivation

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

of virtue, were scattered far and wide throughout the world. In his
treatise, On the Contemplative Life, he writes: "This natural class of
men is to be found in many parts of the inhabited world, both the
Grecian and non-Grecian world, sharing in the perfect good. In Egypt
there are crowds of them in every province, or nome as they call it, and
especially round Alexandria." This is a most important statement, for if
there were so many devoted to the religious life at this time, it
follows that the age was not one of unmixed depravity.

It is not, however, to be thought that these communities were all of an
exactly similar nature, or of one and the same origin, least of all that
they were all Therapeut or Essene. We have only to remember the various
lines of descent of the doctrines held by the innumerable schools
classed together as Gnostic, as sketched in my recent work, Fragments of
a Faith Forgotten, and to turn to the beautiful treatises of the
Hermetic schools, to persuade us that in the first century the striving
after the religious and philosophic life was wide-spread and various.

We are not, however, among those who believe that the origin of the
Therapeut communities of Philo and of the Essenes of Philo and Josephus
is to be traced to Orphic and Pythagorean influence. The question of
precise

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

origin is as yet beyond the power of historical research, and we are not
of those who would exaggerate one element of the mass into a universal
source. But when we remember the existence of all these so widely
scattered communities in the first century, when we study the imperfect
but important record of the very numerous schools and brotherhoods of a
like nature which came into intimate contact with Christianity in its
origins, we cannot but feel that there was the leaven of a strong
religious life working in many parts of the Empire.

Our great difficulty is that these communities, brotherhoods, and
associations kept themselves apart, and with rare exceptions left no
records of their intimate practices and beliefs, or if they left any it
has been destroyed or lost. For the most part then we have to rely upon
general indications of a very superficial character. But this imperfect
record is no justification for us to deny or ignore their existence and
the intensity of their endeavours; and a history which purports to paint
a picture of the times is utterly insufficient so long as it omits this
most vital subject from its canvas.

Among such surroundings as these Apollonius moved; but how little does
his biographer seem to have been aware of the fact? Philostratus has a
rhetorician's appreciation of a philosophical

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

court life, but no feeling for the life of religion. It is only
indirectly that the Life of Apollonius, as it is now depicted, can throw
any light on these most interesting communities, but even an occasional
side-light is precious where all is in such obscurity. Were it but
possible to enter into the living memory of Apollonius, and see with his
eyes the things he saw when he lived nineteen hundred years ago, what an
enormously interesting page of the world's history could be recovered!
He not only traversed all the countries where the new faith was taking
root, but he lived for years in most of them, and was intimately
acquainted with numbers of mystic communities in Egypt, Arabia, and
Syria. Surely he must have visited some of the earliest Christian
communities as well, must even have conversed with some of the
"disciples of the Lord"! And yet no word is breathed of this, not one
single scrap of information on these points do we glean from what is
recorded of him. Surely he must have met with Paul, if not elsewhere,
then at Rome, in 66, when he had to leave because of the edict of
banishment against the philosophers, the very year according to some
when Paul was beheaded!
