### SECTION XVII

#### THE WRITINGS OF APOLLONIUS

<span class="smallcaps">But</span> besides these letters Apollonius also
wrote a number of treatises, of which, however, only one or two
fragments have been preserved. These treatises are as follows:

*a*. The Mystic Rites or Concerning Sacrifices. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[\*](#fn_127.md) This treatise is mentioned by
Philostratus (iii. 41; iv. 19), who tells us that it set down the proper
method of sacrifice to every God, the proper hours of prayer and
offering. It was in wide circulation, and Philostratus had come across
copies of it in many temples and cities, and in the libraries of
philosophers. Several fragments of it have been preserved, <span
id="fr_128"></span>[†](#fn_128.md) the most important of which is to be
found in Eusebius, <span id="fr_129"></span>[‡](#fn_129.md) and is to this
effect: "’Tis best to make no sacrifice to God at all, no lighting of

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

a fire, no calling Him by any name that men employ for things of sense.
For God is over all, the first; and only after Him do come the other
Gods. For He doth stand in need of naught e’en from the Gods, much less
from us small men—naught that the earth brings forth, nor any life she
nurseth, or even any thing the stainless air contains. The only fitting
sacrifice to God is man's best reason, and not the word <span
id="fr_130"></span>[\*](#fn_130.md) that comes from out his mouth.

"We men should ask the best of beings through the best thing in us, for
what is good—I mean by means of mind, for mind needs no material things
to make its prayer. So then, to God, the mighty One, who’s over all, no
sacrifice should ever be lit up."

Noack <span id="fr_131"></span>[†](#fn_131.md) tells us that scholarship is
convinced of the genuineness of this fragment. This book, as we have
seen, was widely circulated and held in the highest respect, and it said
that its rules were engraved on brazen pillars at Byzantium. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[‡](#fn_132.md)

*b*. The Oracles or Concerning Divination, 4 books. Philostratus (iii.
41) seems to think that the full title was Divination of the Stars, and
says that it was based on what Apollonius had

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

learned in India; but the *kind* of divination Apollonius wrote about
was not the ordinary astrology, but something which Philostratus
considers superior to ordinary human art in such matters. He had,
however, never heard of anyone possessing a copy of this rare work.

*c*. The Life of Pythagoras. Porphyry refers to this work, <span
id="fr_133"></span>[\*](#fn_133.md) and Iamblichus quotes a long passage
from it. <span id="fr_134"></span>[†](#fn_134.md)

*d*. The Will of Apollonius, to which reference has already been made,
in treating of the sources of Philostratus (i. 3). This was written in
the Ionic dialect, and contained a summary of his doctrines.

A Hymn to Memory is also ascribed to him, and Eudocia speaks of many
other (καὶ ἄλλα πολλά) works.

We have now indicated for the reader all the information which exists
concerning our philosopher. Was Apollonius, then, a rogue, a trickster,
a charlatan, a fanatic, a misguided enthusiast, or a philosopher, a
reformer, a conscious worker, a true initiate, one of the earth's great
ones? This each must decide for himself, according to his knowledge or
his ignorance.

I for my part bless his memory, and would gladly learn from him, as now
he is.
