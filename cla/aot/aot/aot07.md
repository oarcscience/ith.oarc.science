### SECTION VI

#### THE BIOGRAPHER OF APOLLONIUS

<span class="smallcaps">Flavius Philostratus</span>, the writer of the
only Life of Apollonius which has come down to us, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[\*](#fn_53.md) was a distinguished man of letters who
lived in the last quarter of the second and the first half of the third
century (cir. 175-245 <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>). He formed
one of the circle of famous writers and thinkers gathered round the
philosopher-empress, <span id="fr_54"></span>[†](#fn_54.md) Julia Domna,
who was the guiding spirit of the Empire during the reigns of her
husband Septimius Severus and her son Caracalla. All three members of
the imperial family were students of occult science, and the age was
preeminently one in which the occult arts, good and bad, were a passion.
Thus the sceptical Gibbon, in his sketch of Severus and his famous
consort, writes:

"Like most of the Africans, Severus was

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

passionately addicted to the vain studies of magic and divination,
deeply versed in the interpretation of dreams and omens, and perfectly
acquainted with the science of judicial astrology, which in almost every
age except the present, has maintained its dominion over the mind of
man. He had lost his first wife whilst he was governor of the Lionnese
Gaul. In the choice of a second, he sought only to connect himself with
some favourite of fortune; and as soon as he had discovered that a young
lady of Emesa in Syria had *a royal nativity*, <span
id="fr_55"></span>[\*](#fn_55.md) he solicited and obtained her hand. Julia
Domna <span id="fr_56"></span>[†](#fn_56) (for that was her name.md)
deserved all that the stars could promise her. She possessed, even in an
advanced age, <span id="fr_57"></span>[‡](#fn_57.md) the attractions of
beauty, and united to a lively imagination a firmness of mind, and
strength of judgment, seldom bestowed on her sex. Her amiable qualities
never made any deep impression on the dark and jealous temper of her
husband, <span id="fr_58"></span>[§](#fn_58.md) but in her son's reign, she
administered the principal affairs of the Empire with a prudence that
supported his authority, and with a moderation that sometimes corrected

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

his wild extravagances. Julia applied herself to letters and philosophy
with some success, and with the most splendid reputation. She was the
patroness of every art, and the friend of every man of genius." <span
id="fr_59"></span>[\*](#fn_59.md)

We thus see, even from Gibbon's somewhat grudging estimate, that Domna
Julia was a woman of remarkable character, whose outer acts give
evidence of an inner purpose, and whose private life has not been
written. It was at her request that Philostratus wrote the Life of
Apollonius, and it was she who supplied him with certain MSS. that were
in her possession, as a basis; for the beautiful daughter of Bassianus,
priest of the sun at Emesa, was an ardent collector of books from every
part of the world, especially of the MSS. of philosophers and of
memoranda and biographical notes relating to the famous students of the
inner nature of things.

That Philostratus was the best man to whom to entrust so important a
task, is doubtful. It is true that he was a skilled stylist and a
practised man of letters, an art critic and an ardent antiquarian, as we
may see from his other works; but he was a sophist rather than a
philosopher, and though an enthusiastic admirer of Pythagoras and his
school, was so from a

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

distance, regarding it rather through a wonder-loving atmosphere of
curiosity and the embellishments of a lively imagination than from a
personal acquaintance with its discipline, or a practical knowledge of
those hidden forces of the soul with which its adepts dealt. We have,
therefore, to expect a sketch of the appearance of a thing by one
outside, rather than an exposition of the thing itself from one within.

The following is Philostratus’ account of the sources from which he
derived his information concerning Apollonius: <span
id="fr_60"></span>[\*](#fn_60.md)

"I have collected my materials partly from the cities which loved him,
partly from the temples whose rites and regulations he restored from
their former state of neglect, partly from what others have said about
him, and partly from his own letters. <span
id="fr_61"></span>[†](#fn_61.md) More detailed information I procured as
follows. Damis was a man of some education who formerly used to

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

live in the ancient city of Ninus. <span id="fr_62"></span>[\*](#fn_62.md)
He became a disciple of Apollonius and recorded his travels, in which he
says he himself took part, and also the views, sayings, and predictions
of his master. A member of Damis’ family brought the Empress Julia the
note-books <span id="fr_63"></span>[†](#fn_63.md) containing these memoirs,
which up to that time had not been known of. As I was one of the circle
of this princess, who was a lover and patroness of all literary
productions, she ordered me to rewrite these sketches and improve their
form of expression, for though the Ninevite expressed himself clearly,
his style was far from correct. I also have had access to a book by
Maximus <span id="fr_64"></span>[‡](#fn_64.md) of Ægæ which contained all
Apollonius’ doings at Ægæ. <span id="fr_65"></span>[§](#fn_65.md) There is
also a will written by Apollonius, from which we can learn how he almost
deified philosophy. <span id="fr_66"></span>[\*\*](#fn_66.md) As to the
four books of Mœragenes <span id="fr_67"></span>[¶](#fn_67.md) on
Apollonius they do not deserve

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

attention, for he knows nothing of most of the facts of his life" (i. 2,
3).

These are the sources to which Philostratus was indebted for his
information, sources which are unfortunately no longer accessible to us,
except perhaps a few letters. Nor did Philostratus spare any pains to
gather information on the subject, for in his concluding words (viii.
31), he tells us that he has himself travelled into most parts of the
"world" and everywhere met with the "inspired sayings" <span
id="fr_68"></span>[\*](#fn_68.md) of Apollonius, and that he was especially
well acquainted with the temple dedicated to the memory of our
philosopher at Tyana and founded at the imperial expense ("for the
emperors had judged him not unworthy of like honours with themselves"),
whose priests, it is to be presumed, had got together as much
information as they could concerning Apollonius.

A thoroughly critical analysis of the literary effort of Philostratus,
therefore, would have to take into account all of these factors, and
endeavour to assign each statement to its original source. But even then
the task of the historian would be incomplete, for it is transparently
evident that Philostratus has considerably

.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "embellished" the
narrative with numerous notes and additions of his own and with the
composition of set speeches.

Now as the ancient writers did not separate their notes from the text,
or indicate them in any distinct fashion, we have to be constantly on
our guard to detect the original sources from the glosses of the
writer. <span id="fr_69"></span>[\*](#fn_69.md) In fact Philostratus is
ever taking advantage of the mention of a name or a subject to display
his own knowledge, which is often of a most legendary and fantastic
nature. This is especially the ease in his description of Apollonius’
Indian travels. India at that time and long afterwards was considered
the "end of the world," and an infinity of the strangest "travellers’
tales" and mythological fables were in circulation concerning it. One
has only to read the accounts of the writers on India <span
id="fr_70"></span>[†](#fn_70.md) from the time of Alexander onwards to
discover the source of most of the strange incidents

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

that Philostratus records as experiences of Apollonius. To take but one
instance out of a hundred, Apollonius had to cross the Caucasus, an
indefinite name for the great system of mountain ranges that bound the
northern limits of Āryāvarta. Prometheus was chained to the Caucasus, so
every child had been told for centuries. Therefore, if Apollonius
crossed the Caucasus, he must have seen those chains. And so it was,
Philostratus assures us (ii. 3). Not only so, but he volunteers the
additional information that you could not tell of what they were made! A
perusal of Megasthenes, however, will speedily reduce the long
Philostratian account of the Indian travels of Apollonius (i. 41–iii.
58) to a very narrow compass, for page after page is simply padding,
picked up from any one of the numerous Indica to which our widely read
author had access. <span id="fr_71"></span>[\*](#fn_71.md) To judge from
such writers, Porus <span id="fr_72"></span>[†](#fn_72.md) (the Rājāh
conquered by Alexander) was the immemorial king of India. In fact, in
speaking of India or any other little-known country, a writer in these
days had to drag in all that popular legend associated with it or he
stood little chance of being listened to. He had

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

to give his narrative a "local colour," and this was especially the case
in a technical rhetorical effort like that of Philostratus.

Again, it was the fashion to insert set speeches and put them in the
mouths of well-known characters on historical occasions, good instances
of which may be seen in Thucydides and the Acts of the Apostles.
Philostratus repeatedly does this.

But it would be too long to enter into a detailed investigation of the
subject, although the writer has prepared notes on all these points, for
that would be to write a volume and not a sketch. Only a few points are
therefore set down, to warn the student to be ever on his guard to sift
out Philostratus from his sources. <span id="fr_73"></span>[\*](#fn_73.md)

But though we must be keenly alive to the importance of a thoroughly
critical attitude where definite facts of history are concerned, we
should be as keenly on our guard against judging everything from the
standpoint of modern preconceptions. There is but one religious
literature of antiquity that has ever been treated with real sympathy in
the West, and that is the Judo-Christian; in that alone have men been

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

trained to feel at home, and all in antiquity that treats of religion in
a different mode to the Jewish or Christian way, is felt to be strange,
and, if obscure or extraordinary, to be even repulsive. The sayings and
doings of the Jewish prophets, of Jesus, and of the Apostles, are
related with reverence, embellished with the greatest beauties of
diction, and illumined with the best thought of the age; while the
sayings and doings of other prophets and teachers have been for the most
part subjected to the most unsympathetic criticism, in which no attempt
is made to understand their standpoint. Had even-handed justice been
dealt out all round, the world to-day would have been richer in
sympathy, in wide-mindedness, in comprehension of nature, humanity, and
God, in brief, in soul-experience.

Therefore, in reading the Life of Apollonius let us remember that we
have to look at it through the eyes of a Greek, and not through those of
a Jew or a Protestant. The Many in their proper sphere must be for us as
authentic a manifestation of the Divine as the One or the All, for
indeed the "Gods" exist in spite of commandment and creed. The Saints
and Martyrs and Angels have seemingly taken the places of the Heroes and
Daemons and Gods, but the change of name and change of view-point among
men affect but little the unchangeable facts. To sense

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

the facts of universal religion under the ever-changing names which men
bestow upon them, and then to enter with full sympathy and comprehension
into the hopes and fears of every phase of the religious mind—to read,
as it were, the past lives of our own souls—is a most difficult task.
But until we can put ourselves understandingly in the places of others,
we can never see more than one side of the Infinite Life of God. A
student of comparative religion must not be afraid of terms; he must not
shudder when he meets with "polytheism," or draw back in horror when he
encounters "dualism," or feel an increased satisfaction when he falls in
with "monotheism"; he must not feel awe when he pronounces the name of
Yahweh and contempt when he utters the name of Zeus; he must not picture
a satyr when he reads the word "dæmon," and imagine a winged dream of
beauty when he pronounces the word "angel." For him heresy and orthodoxy
must not exist; he sees only his own soul slowly working out its own
experience, looking at life from every possible view-point, so that
haply at last he may see the whole, and having seen the whole, may
become at one with God.

To Apollonius the mere fashion of a man's faith was unessential; he was
at home in all lands, among all cults. He had a helpful word for all,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

an intimate knowledge of the particular way of each of them, which
enabled him to restore them to health. Such men are rare; the records of
such men are precious, and require the embellishments of no rhetorician.

Let us then, first of all, try to recover the outline of the early
external life and of the travels of Apollonius shorn of Philostratus’
embellishments, and then endeavour to consider the nature of his
mission, the manner of the philosophy which he so dearly loved and which
was to him his religion, and last, if possible, the way of his inner
life.

letters (but not all of them) had been in the possession of the Emperor
Hadrian (<span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 117138), and had been left
in his palace at Antium (viii. 20). This proves the great fame that
Apollonius enjoyed shortly after his disappearance from history, and
while he was still a living memory. It is to be noticed that Hadrian was
an enlightened ruler, a great traveller, a lover of religion, and an
initiate of the Eleusinian Mysteries.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[59:\*](aot07.htm#fr_69.md) Seldom is it that we
have such a clear indication, for instance, as in i. 25; "The following

<span id="fn_70"></span>[59:†](aot07.htm#fr_70.md) See E. A. Schwanbeck,
Megasthenis Indica (Bonn; 1846), and J. W. M’Crindle, Ancient India as

<span id="fn_71"></span>[60:\*](aot07.htm#fr_71.md) Another good example of
this is seen in the disquisition on elephants which Philostratus takes
from Juba's History of Libya (ii. 13 and 16).

<span id="fn_72"></span>[60:†](aot07.htm#fr_72.md) Perhaps a title, or the
king of the Purus.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[61:\*](aot07.htm#fr_73.md) Not that Philostratus
makes any disguise of his embellishments; see, for instance, ii. 17,
where he says: "Let me, however, defer what *I* have to say on the
subject of serpents, of the manner of hunting which Damis gives a
description."
