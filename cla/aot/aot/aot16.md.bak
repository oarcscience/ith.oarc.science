### SECTION XV

#### FROM HIS SAYINGS AND SERMONS

<span class="smallcaps">Apollonius</span> believed in prayer, but how
differently from the vulgar. For him the idea that the Gods could be
swayed from the path of rigid justice by the entreaties of men, was a
blasphemy; that the Gods could be made parties to our selfish hopes and
fears was to our philosopher unthinkable. One thing alone he knew, that
the Gods were the ministers of right and the rigid dispensers of just
desert. The common belief, which has persisted to our own day, that God
can be swayed from His purpose, that compacts could be made with Him or
with His ministers, was entirely abhorrent to Apollonius. Beings with
whom such pacts could be made, who could be swayed and turned, were not
Gods but less than men. And so we find Apollonius as a youth conversing
with one of the priests of Æsculapius as follows:

"Since then the Gods know all things, I think that one who enters the
temple with a

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

right conscience within him should pray thus: 'Give me, ye Gods, what is
my due!'" (i. 11).

And thus again on his long journey to India he prayed at Babylon: "God
of the sun, send thou me o'er the earth so far as e’er ’tis good for
Thee and me; and may I come to know the good, and never know the bad nor
they know me" (i. 31).

One of his most general prayers, Damis tells us, was to this effect:
"Grant me, ye Gods, to have little and need naught" (i. 34).

"When you enter the temples, for what do you pray?" asked the Pontifex
Maximus Telesinus of our philosopher. "I pray," said Apollonius, "that
righteousness may rule, the laws remain unbroken, the wise be poor and
others rich, but honestly" (iv. 40).

The belief of the philosopher in the grand ideal of having nothing and
yet possessing all things, is exemplified by his reply to the officer
who asked him how he dared enter the dominions of Babylon without
permission. "The whole earth," said Apollonius, "is mine; and it is
given me to journey through it" (i. 21).

There are many instances of sums of money being offered to Apollonius
for his services, but he invariably refused them; not only so but his
followers also refused all presents. On the occasion when King Vardan,
with true Oriental

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

generosity, offered them gifts, they turned away; whereupon Apollonius
said: "You see, my hands, though many, are all like each other." And
when the king asked Apollonius what present he would bring him back from
India, our philosopher replied: "A gift that will please you, sire. For
if my stay there should make me wiser, I shall come back to you better
than I am" (i. 41).

When they were crossing the great mountains into India a conversation is
said to have taken place between Apollonius and Damis, which presents us
with a good instance of how our philosopher ever used the incidents of
the day to inculcate the higher lessons of life. The question was
concerning the "below" and "above." Yesterday, said Damis, we were
*below* in the valley; to-day we are *above*, high on the mountains, not
far distant from heaven. So this is what you mean by "below" and
"above," said Apollonius gently. Why, of course, impatiently retorted
Damis, if I am in my right mind; what need of such useless questions?
And have you acquired a greater knowledge of the divine nature by being
nearer heaven on the tops of the mountains? continued his master. Do you
think that those who observe the heaven from the mountain heights are
any nearer the understanding of things? Truth to

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

tell, replied Damis, somewhat crestfallen, I *did* think I should come
down wiser, for I've been up a higher mountain than any of them, but I
fear I know no more than before I ascended it. Nor do other men, replied
Apollonius; "such observations make them see the heavens more blue, the
stars more large, and the sun rise from the night, things known to those
who tend the sheep and goats; but how God doth take thought for human
kind, and how He doth find pleasure in their service, and what is
virtue, righteousness, and common-sense, that neither Athos will reveal
to those who scale his summit nor yet Olympus who stirs the poet's
wonder, unless it be the soul perceive them; for should the soul when
pure and unalloyed essay such heights, I swear to thee, she wings her
flight far far beyond this lofty Caucasus" (ii. 6).

So again, when at Thermopylæ his followers were disputing as to which
was the highest ground in Greece, Mt. Œta being then in view. They
happened to be just at the foot of the hill on which the Spartans fell
overwhelmed with arrows. Climbing to the top of it Apollonius cried out:
"And I think *this* the highest ground, for those who fell here for
freedom's sake have made it high as Œta and raised it far above a
thousand of Olympuses" (iv. 23).

Another instance of how Apollonius turned

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

chance happenings to good account is the following. Once at Ephesus, in
one of the covered walks near the city, he was speaking of sharing our
goods with others, and how we ought mutually to help one another. It
chanced that a number of sparrows were sitting on a tree hard by in
perfect silence. Suddenly another sparrow flew up and began chirping, as
though it wanted to tell the others something. Whereupon the little
fellows all set to a-chirping also, and flew away after the new-comer.
Apollonius’ superstitious audience were greatly struck by this conduct
of the sparrows, and thought it was an augury of some important matter.
But the philosopher continued with his sermon. The sparrow, he said, has
invited his friends to a banquet. A boy slipped down in a lane hard by
and spilt some corn he was carrying in a bowl; he picked up most of it
and went away. The little sparrow, chancing on the scattered grains,
immediately flew off to invite his friends to the feast.

Thereon most of the crowd went off at a run to see if it were true, and
when they came back shouting and all agog with wonderment, the
philosopher continued: "Ye see what care the sparrows take of one
another, and how happy they are to share with all their goods. And yet
we men do not approve; nay, if we see a man

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

sharing his goods with other men, we call it wastefulness, extravagance,
and by such names, and dub the men to whom he gives a share, fawners and
parasites. What then is left to us except to shut us up at home like
fattening birds, and gorge our bellies in the dark until we burst with
fat?" (iv. 3).

On another occasion, at Smyrna, Apollonius, seeing a ship getting under
weigh, used the occasion for teaching the people the lesson of
co-operation. "Behold the vessel's crew!" he said. "How some have manned
the boats, some raise the anchors up and make them fast, some set the
sails to catch the wind, how others yet again look out at bow and stern.
But if a single man should fail to do a single one of these his duties,
or bungle in his seamanship, their sailing will be bad, and they will
have the storm among them. But if they strive in rivalry each with the
other, their only strife being that no man shall seem worse than his
mates, fair havens shall there be for such a ship, and all good weather
and fair voyage crowd in upon it" (iv. 9).

Again, on another occasion, at Rhodes, Damis asked him if he thought
anything greater than the famous Colossus. "I do," replied Apollonius;
"the man who walks in wisdom's guileless paths that give us health" (v.
21).

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

There is also a number of instances of witty or sarcastic answers
reported of our philosopher, and indeed, in spite of his generally grave
mood, he not unfrequently rallied his hearers, and sometimes, if we may
say so, chaffed the foolishness out of them (see especially iv. 30).

Even in times of great danger this characteristic shows itself. A good
instance is his answer to the dangerous question of Tigellinus, "What
think you of Nero?" "I think better of him than you do," retorted
Apollonius, "for you think he ought to sing, and I think he ought to
keep silence" (iv. 44).

So again his reproof to a young Croesus of the period is as witty as it
is wise. "Young sir," he said, "methinks it is not you who own your
house, but your house you" (v. 22).

Of the same style also is his answer to a glutton who boasted of his
gluttony. He copied Hercules, he said, who was as famous for the food he
ate as for his labours.

"Yes," said Apollonius, "for he was Hercules. But *you*, what virtue
have you, midden-heap? Your only claim to notice is your chance of being
burst" (iv. 23).

But to turn to more serious occasions. In answer to Vespasian's earnest
prayer, "Teach me what should a good king do," Apollonius is said to
have replied somewhat in the following words:

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

"You ask me what can not be taught. For kingship is the greatest thing
within a mortal's reach; it is not taught. Yet will I tell you what if
you will do, you will do well. Count not that wealth which is stored
up—in what is this superior to the sand haphazard heaped? nor that which
comes from men who groan beneath taxation's heavy weight—for gold that
comes from tears is base and black. You'll use wealth best of any king,
if you supply the needs of those in want and make their wealth secure
for those with many goods. Be fearful of the power to do whate’er you
please, so will you use it with more prudence. Do not lop off the ears
of corn that show beyond the rest and raise their heads—for Aristotle is
not just in this <span id="fr_115"></span>[\*](#fn_115.md)—but rather weed
their disaffection out like tares from corn, and show yourself a fear to
stirrers up of strife not in 'I punish you' but in 'I *will* do so.'
Submit yourself to law, O prince, for you will make the laws with
greater wisdom if you do not despise the law yourself. Pay reverence
more than ever to the Gods; great are the gifts you have received from
them, and for great things you pray. <span
id="fr_116"></span>[†](#fn_116.md) In what concerns the state act as a
king; in what concerns yourself, act as

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

a private man" (v. 36). And so on much in the same strain, all good
advice and showing a deep knowledge of human affairs. And if we are to
suppose that this is merely a rhetorical exercise of Philostratus and
not based on the substance of what Apollonius said, then we must have a
higher opinion of the rhetorician than the rest of his writings warrant.

There is an exceedingly interesting Socratic dialogue between
Thespesion, the abbot of the Gymnosophist community, and Apollonius on
the comparative merits of the Greek and Egyptian ways of representing
the Gods. It runs somewhat as follows:

"What! Are we to think," said Thespesion, "that the Pheidiases and
Praxiteleses went up to heaven and took impressions of the forms of the
Gods, and so made an art of them, or was it something else that set them
a-modelling?"

"Yes, something else," said Apollonius, "something pregnant with
wisdom."

"What was that? Surely you cannot say it was anything else but
imitation?"

"Imagination wrought them—a workman wiser far than imitation; for
imitation only makes what it has seen, whereas imagination makes what it
has never seen, conceiving it with reference to the thing it really is."

Imagination, says Apollonius, is one of the

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

most potent faculties, for it enables us to reach nearer to realities.
It is generally supposed that Greek sculpture was merely a glorification
of physical beauty, in itself quite unspiritual. It was an idealisation
of form and features, limbs and muscles, an empty glorification of the
physical with nothing of course really corresponding to it in the nature
of things. But Apollonius declared it brings us nearer to the real, as
Pythagoras and Plato declared before him, and as all the wiser teach. He
meant this literally, not vaguely and fantastically. He asserted that
the types and ideas of things are the only realities. He meant that
between the imperfection of the earth and the highest divine type of all
things, were grades of increasing perfection. He meant that within each
man was a form of perfection, though of course not yet absolutely
perfect. That the angel in man, his dæmon, was of God-like beauty, the
summation of all the finest features he had ever worn in his many lives
on earth. The Gods, too, belonged to the world of types, of models, of
perfections, the heaven-world. The Greek sculptors had succeeded in
getting in contact with this world, and the faculty they used was
imagination.

This idealisation of form was a worthy way to represent the Gods; but,
says Apollonius, if

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

you set up a hawk or owl or dog in your temples, to represent Hermes or
Athena or Apollo, you may dignify the animals, but you make the Gods
lose dignity.

To this Thespesion replies that the Egyptians dare not give any precise
form to the Gods; they give them merely symbols to which an occult
meaning is attached.

Yes, answers Apollonius, but the danger is that the common people
worship these symbols and get unbeautiful ideas of the Gods. The best
thing would be to have no representations at all. For the mind of the
worshipper can form and fashion for himself an image of the object of
his worship better than any art.

Quite so, retorted Thespesion, and then added mischievously: There was
an old Athenian, by-the-by—no fool—called Socrates, who swore by the dog
and goose as though they were Gods.

Yes, replied Apollonius, he was no fool. He swore by them not as being
Gods, but in order that he might not swear by the Gods (iv. 19).

This is a pleasant passage of wit, of Egyptian against Greek, but all
such set arguments must be set down to the rhetorical exercises of
Philostratus rather than to Apollonius, who taught as "one having
authority," as "from a tripod." Apollonius, a priest of universal
religion, might have pointed out the good side and the

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

bad side of both Greek and Egyptian religious art, and certainly taught
the higher way of symbolless worship, but he would not champion one
popular cult against another. In the above speech there is a distinct
prejudice against Egypt and a glorification of Greece, and this occurs
in a very marked fashion in several other speeches. Philostratus was a
champion of Greece against all comers; but Apollonius, we believe, was
wiser than his biographer.

In spite of the artificial literary dress that is given to the longer
discourses of Apollonius, they contain many noble thoughts, as we may
see from the following quotations from the conversations of our
philosopher with his friend Demetrius, who was endeavouring to dissuade
him from braving Domitian at Rome.

The law, said Apollonius, obliges us to die for liberty, and nature
ordains that we should die for our parents, our friends, or our
children. All men are bound by these duties. But a higher duty is laid
upon the sage; he must die for his principles and the truth he holds
dearer than life. It is not the law that lays this choice upon him, it
is not nature; it is the strength and courage of his own soul. Though
fire or sword threaten him, it will not overcome his resolution or force
from him the slightest falsehood; but he will guard the secrets of
others’ lives and all that

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

has been entrusted to his honour as religiously as the secrets of
initiation. And I know more than other men, for I know that of all that
I know, I know some things for the good, some for the wise, some for
myself, some for the Gods, but naught for tyrants.

Again, I think that a wise man does nothing alone or by himself; no
thought of his so secret but that he has himself as witness to it. And
whether the famous saying "know thyself" be from Apollo or from some
sage who learnt to know himself and proclaimed it as a good for all, I
think the wise man who knows himself and has his own spirit in constant
comradeship, to fight at his right hand, will neither cringe at what the
vulgar fear, nor dare to do what most men do without the slightest shame
(vii. 15).

In the above we have the true philosopher's contempt for death, and also
the calm knowledge of the initiate, of the comforter and adviser of
others to whom the secrets of their lives have been confessed, that no
tortures can ever unseal his lips. Here, too, we have the full knowledge
of what consciousness is, of the impossibility of hiding the smallest
trace of evil in the inner world; and also the dazzling brilliancy of a
higher ethic which makes the habitual conduct of the crowd appear
surprising—the "that which they do—not with shame."
