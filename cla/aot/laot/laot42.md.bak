### CHAPTER VIII

Such then was the oration which the sage had prepared beforehand, at the
end whereof I found the last words of the earlier speech, namely:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"For thou shalt not kill me, since I tell thee I am not mortal,"

</div>

<span id="page_2:356">p. 356</span> <span id="page_2:357">p. 357</span>

together with the words which preceded and led up to this quotation. But
the effect upon the despot of his quitting the court in a matter so
godlike and inexplicable was quite other than that which the many
expected; for they expected him to make a terrific uproar and institute
a hunt for the man, and to send forth proclamations over his empire to
arrest him wherever they should find him. But he did nothing of the
kind, as if he set himself to defeat man's expectations; or because he
now at last realized that as against the sage he had no resources of his
own. But whether he acted from contempt, let us conjecture from what
ensued, for he will be seen confounded with astonishment rather than
filled with contempt.

### CHAPTER IX

For he had to hear another case after that of Apollonius, an action
brought, I think, in connexion with a will by some city against a
private individual; and he had forgotten not only the names of the
parties, but also the matter at issue in the suit; for his questions
were without meaning and his answers were not relevant to the case—all
which argued the degree of astonishment and perplexity under which the
despot labored, the more so because his flatterers had persuaded him
that nothing could escape his memory.

### CHAPTER X

Such was the condition to which Apollonius reduced the despot, making
him a plaything of his

<span id="page_2:358">p. 358</span> <span id="page_2:359">p. 359</span>

philosophy who had been the terror of the Hellenes and the barbarians;
and before midday he left the court, and at dusk appeared to Demetrius
and Damis at Dicaearchia. And this accounts for his having instructed
Damis to go by land to Dicaearchia, without waiting to hear his defense.
For he had given no previous notice of his intentions, but had merely
told the man who was mostly in his intimacy to do what best accorded
with his plans.
