### CHAPTER XLI

And on the next day he called Damis and said: "My defense has to be
pleaded by me on the day appointed, so do you betake yourself in the
direction of Dicaearchia, for it is better to go by land; and when you
have saluted Demetrius, turn aside to the sea-shore where the island of
Calypso lies; for there you shall see me appear to you." "Alive," asked
Damis, "or how?" Apollonius with a smile replied: "As I myself believe,
alive, but as you will believe, risen from the dead." Accordingly he
says that he went away with much regret, for although he did not quite
despair of his master's life, yet he hardly expected him to escape
death. And on the third day he arrived at Dicaearchia, where he at once
heard news of the great storm which had raged during those days; for a
gale with rain had burst over the sea, sinking some of the ships that
were sailing thither, and driving out of their course those which were
tending to Sicily and the straits of Messina. And then he understood why
it was that Apollonius had bidden him to go by land.

### CHAPTER XLII

The events which followed are related by Damis, he says, from accounts
given by Apollonius, both to himself and Demetrius. For he relates that
there came to Rome from Messene in Arcadia a youth remarkable for his
beauty, and found there many admirers, and above all Domitian, whose
rivals even

<span id="page_2:264">p. 264</span> <span id="page_2:265">p. 265</span>

the former did not scruple to declare themselves, so strong was their
attachment. The youth however was too high-principled and respected his
honor. Now had it been gold that he scorned or possessions or horses, or
such other attractions and lures as sundry persons seek to corrupt young
people with, we had no call to praise him, for the seducer can hardly
dispense with such preparations. But he was tempted with larger honors
than all those put together who ever attracted the glances of
sovereigns, yet he disdained them all for himself. In consequence, he
was cast into prison by his own admirer's orders. He came up to
Apollonius, and made as if he would speak to him, but, being counseled
by his modesty to keep silent, did not venture to. Apollonius noticed
this and said: "You are confined here, and yet are not of an age to be a
malefactor, like ourselves who are hardened sinners." "Yes, and I shall
be put to death," said the other; "for by our latter-day laws
self-respect is honored with capital punishment." "So it was in the time
of Theseus," answered Apollonius, "for Hippolytus was murdered by his
own sire for the same reason." "And I too," said the other, " am my own
father's victim. For though I am an Arcadian from Messene, he did not
give me an Hellenic education, but sent me here to study law; and when I
had come here for that purpose the Emperor cast an evil eye on me." But
Apollonius feigned not to understand what he meant and said: "Tell me,
my boy, surely the Emperor does not imagine you have blue eyes, when you
have, as I see, black ones? Or that you have a crooked nose, whereas it
is square and regular, like that of a well executed Hermes? or has he
not made some

<span id="page_2:266">p. 266</span> <span id="page_2:267">p. 267</span>

mistake about your hair? For, methinks, it is sunny and gleaming, and
your mouth too is so regular, that whether you are silent or talking, it
is equally comely, and you carry your head freely and proudly. Surely
the Emperor must be mistaking all these traits for others, or you would
not tell me he has cast an evil eye on you." "That is just what ruined
me," said the other, "for he has condescended to favor me and instead of
sparing what he praises is prepared to insult me as a woman's lovers
might." Apollonius admired the Arcadian too much to ply him with such
question as what he thought of sleeping together, as whether it was
disgraceful or not, and others of the sort, as he noticed that he
blushed and was not decorous in his language; so he only put to him the
question: "Have you any slaves in Arcadia?" "Why yes, many," replied the
lad. "What conversation to them," said Apollonius, "do you consider
yourself as holding?" "That," he replied, "which the laws assign to me,
for I am their master." "And must slaves obey their masters or disdain
the wishes of those who are masters of their persons?" The other
discerned the drift of his question and answered: "I know indeed how
irresistible and harsh is the power of tyrants, for they are inclined to
use it to overpower even free men, but I am master of my person and
shall guard it inviolate." "How can you do that," said Apollonius, "for
you have to do with an admirer who is prepared to run amuck of your
youth, sword in hand?" "I shall simply hold out my neck, which is all
his sword requires." Whereupon Apollonius commended him, and said: "I
perceive you are an Arcadian." Moreover, he mentions this youth in one
of his letters,

<span id="page_2:268">p. 268</span> <span id="page_2:269">p. 269</span>

and gives a much more attractive account of him than I have done in the
above, and while praising him for his high principles to his
correspondent, adds that he was not put to death by the tyrant. On the
contrary, after exciting admiration by his firmness, he returned by ship
to Malea, and was held in more honor by the inhabitants of Arcadia than
the youths who among the Lacedaemonians surpass their fellows in their
endurance of the scourge.
