### CHAPTER XXXI

The conversations which Apollonius held in Olympia turned upon the most
profitable topics, such as wisdom and courage and temperance, and in a
word upon all the virtues. He discussed these from the platform of the
temple, and he astonished everyone not only by the insight he showed but
by his forms of expression. And the Lacedaemonians flocked round him and
invited him to share their hospitality at their shrine of Zeus, and made
him father of their youths at home, and legislator of their lives and
the honor of their old men. Now there was a Corinthian who felt piqued
at all this, and asked whether they were also going to celebrate a
theophany for him. "Yes," said the other, "by Castor and Pollux,
everything is ready anyhow." But Apollonius did not encourage them to
pay him such honors, for he feared they would arouse envy. And when
having crossed the mountain Taygetus, he saw a Lacedaemon hard at work
before him and all the institutions of Lycurgus in full swing, he felt
that it would be a real pleasure to converse with

<span id="page_1:420">p. 420</span> <span id="page_1:421">p. 421</span>

the authorities of the Lacedaemonians about things which they might ask
his opinion upon; so they asked him when he arrived how the gods are to
be revered, and he answered: "As your lords and masters." Secondly, they
asked him: "And how the heroes?" "As fathers," he replied. And their
third question was: "How are men to be revered?" And he answered: "Your
question is not one which any Spartan should put." They asked him also
what he thought of their laws, and he replied that they were most
excellent teachers, adding that teachers will gain fame in proportion as
their disciples are industrious. And when they asked him what advice he
had to give them about courage, he answered: "Why what else, but that
you should display it?"

### CHAPTER XXXII

And about this time it happened that a certain youth of Lacedaemon was
charged by his fellow citizens with violating the customs of his
country. For though he was descended from Callicratidas who led the navy
at the battle of Arginusae, yet he was devoted to seafaring and paid not
attention to public affairs; but, instead of doing so, would sail off to
Carthage or Sicily in the ships which he had had built. Apollonius then
hearing that he was arraigned for this conduct, thought it a pity to
desert the youth who had just fallen under the hand of justice, and said
to him: "My excellent fellow, why do you go about so full of anxiety and
with such a gloomy air?" "A public prosecution," said the other, "has

<span id="page_1:422">p. 422</span> <span id="page_1:423">p. 423</span>

been instituted against me, because I go in for seafaring and take no
part in public affairs." "And was your father or your grandfather a
mariner?" "Of course not," said the other; "they were all of them chiefs
of the gymnasium and Ephors and public guardians; Callicratidas,
however, my ancestor, was a real admiral of the fleet." "I suppose,"
said Apollonius, "you hardly mean him of Arginusae fame?" "Yes, that
fell in the naval action leading his fleet." "Then," said Apollonius,
"your ancestor's mode of death has not given you any prejudice against a
seafaring life?" "No, by Zeus," said the other, "for it is not with a
view to conducting battles by sea that I set sail." "Well, and can you
mention any rabble of people more wretched and ill-starred than
merchants and skippers? In the first place they roam from sea to sea,
looking for some market that is badly stocked; and then they sell and
are sold, associating with factors and brokers, and they subject their
own heads to the most unholy rate of interest in their hurry to get back
to the principal; and if they do well, their ship has a lucky voyage,
and they tell you a long story of how they never wrecked it either
willingly or unwillingly; but if their gains do not balance their debts,
they jump into their long boats and dash their ships on to the rocks,
and make no bones as sailors of robbing others of their substance,
pretending in the most blasphemous manner that it is an act of God. And
even if the seafaring crowd who go on voyages be not so bad as I make
them out to be; yet is there any shame worse than this, for a man who is
a citizen of Sparta and the child of forbears who of old lived in the
heart of Sparta, to secrete himself in the hold of a ship, oblivious of
Lycurgus and Iphitus, thinking of

<span id="page_1:424">p. 424</span> <span id="page_1:425">p. 425</span>

nought but of cargoes and petty bills of lading? For if he thinks of
nothing else, he might at least bear in mind that Sparta herself, so
long as she stuck to the land, enjoyed a fame reaching to heaven; but
when she began to covet the sea, she sank down and down, and was blotted
out at last, not only on the sea but on the land as well." The young man
was so overcome by these arguments, that he bowed his head to the earth
and wept, because he heard he was so degenerate from his fathers; and he
sold the ships by which he lived. And when Apollonius saw that he was
restored to his senses and inclined to embrace a career on land, he led
him before the Ephors and obtained his acquittal.

### CHAPTER XXXIII

Here is another incident that happened in Lacedaemon. A letter came from
the Emperor heaping reproaches upon the public assembly of the
Lacedaemonians, and declaring that in their license they abused liberty,
and this letter had been addressed to them at the instance of the
governor of Greece, who had maligned them. The Lacedaemonians then were
at a loss what to do, and Sparta was divided against herself over the
issue, whether in their reply to the letter they should try to appease
the Emperor's wrath or take a lofty tone towards him. Under the
circumstances they sought the counsel of Apollonius and asked him how to
pitch the tone of their letter. And he, when he saw them to be divided
on the point, came forward in their public assembly and delivered
himself of the following short and concise

<span id="page_1:426">p. 426</span> <span id="page_1:427">p. 427</span>

speech: "Palamedes discovered writing not only in order that people
might write, but also in order that they might know what they must not
write." In this way accordingly he dissuaded the Lacedaemonians from
showing themselves to be either too bold or cowardly.

### CHAPTER XXXIV

He stayed in Sparta for some time after the Olympic Festival, until the
winter was over; and at the beginning of the spring proceeded to Malea
with the intention of setting out for Rome. But while he was still
pondering this project, he had the following dream: It seemed as if a
woman both very tall and venerable in years embraced him, and asked him
to visit her before he set sail for Italy; and she said that she was the
nurse of Zeus, and she wore a wreath that held everything that is on the
earth or in the seas. He proceeded to ponder the meaning of the vision,
and came to the conclusion that he ought first to sail to Crete, which
we regard as the nurse of Zeus, because in that island Zeus was born;
although the wreath might perhaps indicate some other island. Now there
were several ships at Malea, making ready to set sail to Crete, so he
embarked upon one sufficient for his association, which is the title he
gave to his companions, and also his companions' servants, for he did
not think it right to pass over the latter. And he bent his course for
Cydonia, and sailed past that place to Knossus, where a labyrinth is
shown, which, I believe, once on a time, contained the Minotaur. As his
companions were anxious to see this he allowed them to do so,

<span id="page_1:428">p. 428</span> <span id="page_1:429">p. 429</span>

but refused himself to be a spectator of the injustice of Minos, and
continued his course to Gortyna because he longed to visit Ida. He
accordingly climbed up, and after visiting the sacred sites he passed on
to the shrine of Lebena. And this is a shrine of Asclepius, and just as
the whole of Asia flocks to Pergamon, so the whole of Crete flocked to
this shrine; and many Libyans also cross the sea to visit it, for it
faces towards the Libyan sea close to Phaestus, where the little rock
keeps out a might sea. And they say that this shrine is named that of
Lebena, because a promontory juts out from it which resembles a lion,
for here, as often, a chance arrangement of the rocks suggests an animal
form; and they tell a story about this promontory, how it was once one
of the lion which were yoked in the chariot of Rhea. Here Apollonius was
haranguing on one occasion about midday, and was addressing quite a
number of people who were worshipping at the shrine, when an earthquake
shook the whole of Crete at once, and a roar of thunder was heard to
issue not from the clouds but from the earth, and the sea receded about
seven stadia. And most of them were afraid that the sea by receding in
this way would drag the temple after it, so that they would be carried
away. But Apollonius said: "Be of good courage, for the sea has given
birth and brought forth land." And they thought that he was alluding to
the harmony of the elements, and was urging that the sea would never
wreak any violence upon the land; but after a few days some travelers
arrived from Cydoniatis and announced that on the very day on which this
portent occurred and just at the same hour of midday, an island rose out
of the sea in the

<span id="page_1:430">p. 430</span> <span id="page_1:431">p. 431</span>

firth between Thera and Crete. However, I must give up all prolixity and
hurry on to relate the conversations which he held in Rome, subsequently
to his stay in Crete.

### CHAPTER XXXV

Nero was opposed to philosophy, because he suspected its devotees to be
addicted to magic, and of being diviners in disguise; and at last the
philosopher's mantle brought its wearers before the law courts, as if it
were a mere cloak of the divining art. I will not mention other names,
but Musonius of Babylon, a man only second to Apollonius, was thrown
into prison for the crime of being a sage, and there lay in danger of
death; and he would have died for all his gaoler cared, of it had not
been for the strength of his constitution.

### CHAPTER XXXVI

Such was the condition in which philosophy stood when Apollonius was
approaching Rome; and at a distance of one hundred and twenty stadia
from its walls he met Philolaus of Cittium in the neighborhood of the
Grove of Aricia. Now Philolaus was a polished speaker, but too soft to
bear any hardships. He had quitted Rome, and was virtually a fugitive,
and any philosopher he met with he urged to take the same course. He
accordingly addressed himself to Apollonius, and urged him to give way
to circumstances, and not to proceed to Rome, where philosophy was in
such bad odor; and he related

<span id="page_1:432">p. 432</span> <span id="page_1:433">p. 433</span>

to him what had taken place there, and as he did so he kept turning his
head round, lest anybody should be listening behind him to what he said.
"And you," he said, "after attaching this band of philosophers to
yourself, a thing which will bring you into suspicion and odium, are on
your way thither, knowing nothing of the officers set over the gates by
Nero, who will arrest you and them before ever you enter or get inside."
"And what," said Apollonius, "O Philolaus, are the occupations of the
autocrat said to be?" "He drives a chariot," said the other, "in public;
and he comes forward on the boards of the Roman theaters and sings
songs, and he lives with gladiators, and hem himself fights as one and
slays his man." Apollonius therefore replied and said: "Then, my dear
fellow, do you think that there can be any better spectacle for men of
education than to see an emperor thus demeaning himself? For if in
Plato's opinion man is the sport of the gods, what a theme we have here
provided for philosophers by an emperor who makes himself the sport of
man and sets himself to delight the common herd with the spectacle of
his own shame?" "Yes, by Zeus," said Philolaus, "if you could do it with
impunity; but if you are going to be taken up and lose your life, and if
Nero is going to devour you alive before you see anything of what he
does, your interview with him will cost you dear, much dearer than it
ever cost Ulysses to visit the Cyclops in his home; though he lost many
of his comrades in his anxiety to see him, and because he yielded to the
temptation of beholding so cruel a monster." But Apollonius said: "So
you think that this ruler is less blinded than the Cyclops, if he

<span id="page_1:434">p. 434</span> <span id="page_1:435">p. 435</span>

commits such crimes?" And Philolaus answered: "Let him do what he likes,
but do you at least save these your companions."

### CHAPTER XXXVII

And these words he uttered in a loud voice and with an air of weeping;
whereupon Damis conceived a fear lest the younger men of his party
should be unmanned by the craven terrors of Philolaus. So he took aside
Apollonius and said: "This hare, with all his panicky fears, will ruin
these young men, and fill them with discouragement." But Apollonius
said: "Well, of all the blessings which have been vouchsafed to me by
the gods, often without my praying for them at all, this present one, I
may say, is the greatest that I have ever enjoyed; for chance has thrown
in my way a touchstone to test these young men, of a kind to prove most
thoroughly which of them are philosophers, and which of them prefer some
other line of conduct than that of philosopher." And in fact the
knock-kneed among them were detected in no time, for under the influence
of what Philolaus said, some of them declared that they were ill, others
that they had no provisions for the journey, others that they were
homesick, others that they had been deterred by dreams; and in the
result thirty-four companions of Apollonius were willing to accompany
him to Rome were reduced to eight. And all the rest ran away from Nero
and philosophy, both at once, and took to their heels.

<span id="page_1:436">p. 436</span> <span id="page_1:437">p. 437</span>

### CHAPTER XXXVIII

He therefore assembled those who were left, among whom were Menippus,
who had foregathered with the hobgoblin, and Dioscorides the Egyptian,
and Damis, and said to them: "I shall not scold those who have abandoned
us, but I shall rather praise you for being men like myself: nor shall I
think a man a coward because he has disappeared out of dread of Nero,
but anyone who rises superior to such fear I will hail as a philosopher,
and I will teach him all I know. I think then that we ought first of all
to pray to the gods who have suggested these different courses to you
and to them; and then we ought to solicit their direction and guidance,
for we have not any succor to rely upon apart from the gods. We must
then march forward to the city which is the mistress of so much of the
inhabited world; but how can anybody go forward thither, unless the gods
are leading him? The more so, because a tyranny has been established in
this city so harsh and cruel, that it does not suffer men to be wise.
And let not anyone think it foolish so to venture along a path which
many philosophers are fleeing from; for in the first place I do not
esteem any human agency so formidable that a wise man can ever be
terrified by it; and in the second place, I would not urge upon you the
pursuit of bravery, unless it were attended with danger. Moreover, in
traversing more of the earth than any man yet has visited, I have seen
hosts of Arabian and Indian wild beasts; but as to this wild beast,
which many call a tyrant,

<span id="page_1:438">p. 438</span> <span id="page_1:439">p. 439</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I know not either
how many heads he has, nor whether he has crooked talons and jagged
teeth. In any case, though this monster is said to be a social beast and
to inhabit the heart of cities, yet he is also much wilder and fiercer
in his disposition than animals of the mountain and forest, that whereas
you can sometimes tame and alter the character of lions and leopards by
flattering them, this one is only roused to greater cruelty than before
by those who stroke him, so that he rends and devours all alike. And
again there is no animal anyhow of which you can say that it ever
devours its own mother, but Nero is gorged with such quarry. It is true,
perhaps, that the same crime was committed in the case of Orestes and
Alcmaeon, but they had some excuse for their deeds, in that the father
of the one was murdered by his own wife, while the other's had been sold
for a necklace; this man, however, has murdered the very mother to whom
he owes his adoption by the aged emperor and his inheritance of the
empire; for he shipwrecked and so slew her close to land in a vessel
built for the express purpose of doing her to death. If, however, anyone
is disposed to dread Nero for these reasons, and is led abruptly to
forsake philosophy, conceiving that it is not safe for him to thwart his
evil temper, let him know that the quality of inspiring fear really
belongs to those who are devoted to temperance and wisdom, because they
are sure of divine succor. But let him snap his fingers at the threats
of the proud and insolent, as he would at those of drunken men; for we
regard the latter surely as daft and silly, but not as formidable. Let
us then go forward to Rome, if we are good men and true; for to Nero's
proclamations

<span id="page_1:440">p. 440</span> <span id="page_1:441">p. 441</span>

in which he banishes philosophy, we may well oppose the verse of
Sophocles:

"'For in no wise was it Zeus who made this proclamation unto me,'

nor the Muses either, nor Apollo the god of eloquence. But it may well
be that Nero himself knows this iambic line, for he is, they say,
addicted to tragedy."

This occasion reminds one of the saying of Homer, that when warriors are
knit together with reason, they become as it were a single plume and
helmet, and a single shield; and it seems to me that this very sentiment
found its application in regard to these heroes; for they were welded
together and encouraged by the words of Apollonius to die in behalf of
their philosophy, and strengthened to show themselves superior to those
who had run away.

### CHAPTER XXXIX

They accordingly approached the gates of Rome, and the sentries asked
them no questions, although they scanned their dress with some
curiosity; for the fashion of it was that of religious ascetics, and did
not in the least resemble that of beggars. And they put up at an inn
close to the gate, and were taking their supper, for it was already
eventide, when a drunken fellow with a far from harsh voice turned up as
it were for a revel; and he was one it seems who was in the habit of
going round about Rome singing Nero's songs and hired for the purpose,
and anyone who neglected to listen to him or refused to pay him for his
music, he had the right to arrest for violating Nero's

<span id="page_1:442">p. 442</span> <span id="page_1:443">p. 443</span>

majesty. And he carried a harp and all the outfit proper for a harpist,
and he also had put away in a casket a second-hand string which others
had fastened on their instruments and tuned up before him, and this he
said he had purchased off Nero's own lyre for two minas, and that he
would sell it to no one who was not a first-rate harpist and fit to
contend for the prize at Delphi. He then struck up a prelude, according
to his custom, and after performing a short hymn composed by Nero, he
added various lays, some out of the story of Orestes, and some from the
Antigone, and others from one or another of the tragedies composed by
Nero, and he proceeded to drawl out the rondos which Nero was in the
habit of murdering by his miserable writhings and modulations. As they
listened with some indifference, he proceeded to accuse them of
violating Nero's majesty and of being enemies of his divine voice; but
they paid no attention to him. Then Menippus asked Apollonius how he
appreciated these remarks, whereupon he said: "How do I appreciate them?
Why, just a I did his songs. Let us, however, O Menippus, not take too
much offence at his remarks, but let us give him something for his
performance and dismiss him to sacrifice to the Muses of Nero."

### CHAPTER XL

So ended the episode of this poor drunken fool. But at daybreak
Telesinus, one of the consuls, called Apollonius to him, and said: "What
is this dress which you wear?" And he answered: "A pure

<span id="page_1:444">p. 444</span> <span id="page_1:445">p. 445</span>

garment made from no dead matter." "And what is your wisdom?" "An
inspiration," answered Apollonius, "which teaches men how to pray and
sacrifice to the gods." "And is there anyone, my philosopher, who does
not know that already?" "Many," said the sage, "and if there is here and
there a man who understands these matters aright, he will be very much
improved by hearing from a man who is wiser than himself that, what he
knows, he knows for a certainty." When Telesinus heard this, for he was
a man fairly disposed to worship and religion, he recognized the sage
from the rumors which he had long before heard about him; and though he
did not think he need openly ask him his name, in case he wished to
conceal his identity from anyone, he nevertheless led him on to talk
afresh about religion, for he was himself an apt reasoner, and feeling
that he was addressing a sage, he asked: "What do you pray for when you
approach the altars?" "I," said Apollonius, "for my part pray that
justice may prevail, that the laws may not be broken, that the wise may
continue to be poor, but that others may be rich, as long as they are so
without fraud." "Then," said the other, "when you ask for so much, do
you think you will get it?" "Yes, by Zeus," said Apollonius, "for I
string together all my petitions in a single prayer, and when I reach
the altars this is how I pray: 'O ye gods, bestow on me whatever is
due.' If therefore I am of the number of worthy men, I shall obtain more
than I have said; but if the gods rank me among the wicked, then they
will send to me the opposite of what I ask; and I shall not blame the
gods, because for my demerit I am judged worthy of evil." Telesinus then
was greatly

<span id="page_1:446">p. 446</span> <span id="page_1:447">p. 447</span>

struck by these words, and wishing to show him a favor, he said: "You
may visit all the temples, and written instructions shall be sent by me
to the priests who minister in them to admit you and adopt your
reforms." "And supposing you did not write," said Apollonius, "would
they not admit me?" "No, by Zeus," said he, "for that is my own office
and prerogative." "I am glad," said Apollonius, "that so generous a man
as yourself holds such a high office, but I would like you to know this
much too about me: I like to live in such temples as are not too closely
shut up, and none of the gods object to my presence, for they invite me
to share their habitation. So let this liberty too be accorded to me,
inasmuch as even the barbarians always permitted it." And Telesinus
said: "The barbarians have more to be proud of in this matter than the
Romans, for I would that as much could be said of ourselves." Apollonius
accordingly lived in the temples, though he changed them and passed from
one to another; and when he was blamed for doing so, he said: "Neither
do the gods live all their time in heaven, but they take journeys to
Ethiopia, as also to Olympus and to Athos, and I think it is a pity that
the gods should go roaming around all the nations of men, and yet that
men should not be allowed to visit all the gods alike. What is more,
though masters would incur no reproach for neglecting slaves, for whom
they probably may feel a contempt because they are not good, yet the
slaves who did not devote themselves wholly to their masters, would be
destroyed by them as cursed wretches and chattels hateful to the gods."
