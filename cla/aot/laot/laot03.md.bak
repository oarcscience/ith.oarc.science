### CHAPTER I

THE votaries of Pythagoras of Samos have this story to tell of him, that
he was not an Ionian at all, but that, once on a time in Troy, he had
been Euphorbus, and that he had come to life after death, but had died
as the songs of Homer relate. And they say that he declined to wear
apparel made from dead animal products and, to guard his purity,
abstained from all flesh diet, and from the offering of animals in
sacrifice. For that he would not stain the altars with blood; nay,
rather the honey-cake and frankincense and the hymn of praise, these
they say were the offerings made to the Gods by this man, who realized
that they welcome such tribute more than they do the hecatombs and the
knife laid upon the sacrificial basket. For they say that he had of a
certainty social intercourse with the gods, and learnt from them the
conditions under which they take pleasure in men or are disgusted, and
on this intercourse he based his account of nature. For he said that,
whereas other men only make conjectures about divinity and make guesses
that

<span id="page_1:4">p. 4</span> <span id="page_1:5">p. 5</span>

contradict one another concerning it,—in his own case he said that
Apollo had come to him acknowledging that he was the god in person; and
that Athena and the Muses and other gods, whose forms and names men did
not yet know, had also consorted with him though without making such
acknowledgment. And the followers of Pythagoras accepted as law any
decisions communicated by him, and honored him as an emissary from Zeus,
but imposed, out of respect for their divine character, a ritual silence
on themselves. For many were the divine and ineffable secrets which they
had heard, but which it was difficult for any to keep who had not
previously learnt that silence also is a mode of speech.

Moreover they declare that Empedocles of Acragas had trodden this way of
wisdom when he wrote the line

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Rejoice ye, for I am unto you an immortal God, and no more mortal."

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And this also:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"For erewhile, I already became both girl and boy."

</div>

And the story that he made at Olympia a bull of pastry and sacrificed it
to the god also shows that he approved of the sentiments of Pythagoras.
And there is much else that they tell of those sages who observe the
rule of Pythagoras; but I must not now enter upon such points, but hurry
on to the work which I have set myself to complete.

<span id="page_1:6">p. 6</span> <span id="page_1:7">p. 7</span>

### CHAPTER II

FOR quite akin to theirs was the ideal which Apollonius pursued, and
more divinely than Pythagoras he wooed wisdom and soared above tyrants;
and he lived in times not long gone by nor quite of our own day, yet men
know him not because of the true wisdom, which he practiced as sage and
sanely; but one man singles out one feature for praise in him and
another another; while some, because he had interviews with the wizards
of Babylon and with the Brahmans of India, and with the nude ascetics of
Egypt, put him down as a wizard, and spread the calumny that he was a
sage of an illegitimate kind, judging of him ill. For Empedocles and
Pythagoras himself and Democritus consorted with wizards and uttered
many supernatural truths, yet never stooped to the black art; and Plato
went to Egypt and mingled with his own discourses much of what he heard
from the prophets and priests there; and though, like a painter, he laid
his own colors on to their rough sketches, yet he never passed for a
wizard, although envied above all mankind for his wisdom. For the
circumstance that Apollonius foresaw and foreknew so many things does
not in the least justify us in imputing to him this kind of wisdom; we
might as well accuse Socrates of the same, because, thanks to his
familiar spirit, he knew things beforehand, and we might also accuse
Anaxagoras because of the many things which he foretold. And indeed who
does not know the story of how Anaxagoras at Olympia in a season when
least rain falls came forward wearing a fleece into the stadium, by way
of predicting rain, and of how he

<span id="page_1:8">p. 8</span> <span id="page_1:9">p. 9</span>

foretold the fall of the house,—and truly, for it did fall; and of how
he said that day would be turned into night, and stones would be
discharged from heaven round Aegospotami, and of how his predictions
were fulfilled? Now these feats are set down to the wisdom of Anaxagoras
by the same people who would rob Apollonius of the credit of having
predicted things by dint of wisdom, and say that he achieved these
results by art of wizardry.

It seems to me then that I ought not to condone or acquiesce in the
general ignorance, but write a true account of the man, detailing the
exact times at which he said or did this or that, as also the habits and
temper of wisdom by means of which he succeeded in being considered a
supernatural and divine being.

And I have gathered my information partly from the many cities where he
was loved, and partly from the temples whose long-neglected and decayed
rites he restored, and partly from the accounts left of him by others
and partly from his own letters. For he addressed these to kings,
sophists, philosophers, to men of Elis, of Delphi, to Indians, and
Ethiopians; and in his letters he dealt with the subjects of the gods,
of customs, of moral principles, of laws, and in all these departments
he corrected the errors into which men had fallen. But the more precise
details which I have collected are as follows.

### CHAPTER III

THERE was a man, Damis, by no means stupid, who formerly dwelt in the
ancient city of Nineveh. He resorted to Apollonius in order to study
wisdom, and having shared, by his own account, his

<span id="page_1:10">p. 10</span> <span id="page_1:11">p. 11</span>

wanderings abroad, wrote an account of them. And he records his opinions
and discourses and all his prophecies. And a certain kinsmen of Damis
drew the attention of the empress Julia to the documents containing
these documents hitherto unknown. Now I belonged to the circle of the
empress, for she was a devoted admirer of all rhetorical exercises; and
she commanded me to recast and edit these essays, at the same time
paying more attention to the style and diction of them; for the man of
Nineveh had told his story clearly enough, yet somewhat awkwardly. And I
also read the book of Maximus of Aegae, which comprised all the life of
Apollonius in Aegae; and furthermore a will was composed by Apollonius,
from which one can learn how rapturous and inspired a sage he really
was. For we must not pay attention anyhow to Moeragenes, who composed
four books about Apollonius, and yet was ignorant of many circumstances
of his life. That then I combined these scattered sources together and
took trouble over my composition, I have said; but let my work, I pray,
redound to the honor of the man who is the subject of my compilation,
and also be of use to those who love learning. For assuredly, they will
here learn things of which as yet they were ignorant.

### CHAPTER IV

APOLLONIUS’ home, then, was Tyana, a Greek city amidst a population of
Cappadocians. His father was of the same name, and the family descended
from the first settlers. It excelled in wealth the surrounding families,
though the district is a rich one. To his mother, just before

<span id="page_1:12">p. 12</span> <span id="page_1:13">p. 13</span>

he was born, there came an apparition of Proteus, who changes his form
so much in Homer, in the guise of an Egyptian demon. She was in no way
frightened, but asked him what sort of child she would bear. And he
answered: "Myself." "And who are you?" she asked. "Proteus," answered
he, "the god of Egypt." Well, I need hardly explain to readers of the
poets the quality of Proteus and his reputation as regards wisdom; how
versatile he was, and for ever changing his form, and defying capture,
and how he had a reputation of knowing both past and future. And we must
bear Proteus in mind all the more, when my advancing story shows its
hero to have been more of a prophet than Proteus, and to have triumphed
over many difficulties and dangers in the moment when they beset him
most closely.

### CHAPTER V

NOW he is said to have been born in a meadow, hard by which there has
been now erected a sumptuous temple to him; and let us not pass by the
manner of his birth. For just as the hour of his birth was approaching,
his mother was warned in a dream to walk out into the meadow and pluck
the flowers; and in due course she came there and her maids attended to
the flowers, scattering themselves over the meadow, while she fell
asleep lying on the grass. Thereupon the swans who fed in the meadow set
up a dance around her as she slept, and lifting their wings, as they are
wont to do, cried out aloud all at once, for there was somewhat of a
breeze blowing in the meadow. She then leaped up at the sound of their
song and bore her child, for any

<span id="page_1:14">p. 14</span> <span id="page_1:15">p. 15</span>

sudden fright is apt to bring on a premature delivery. But the people of
the country say that just at the moment of the birth, a thunderbolt
seemed about to fall to earth and then rose up into the air and
disappeared aloft; and the gods thereby indicated, I think, the great
distinction to which the sage was to attain, and hinted in advance how
he should transcend all things upon earth and approach the gods, and
signified all the things that he would achieve.

### CHAPTER VI

NOW there is near Tyana a well sacred to Zeus, the god of paths, so they
say, and they call it the well of Asbama. Here a spring rises cold, but
bubbles up like a boiling cauldron. This water is favorable and sweet to
those who keep their paths, but to perjurers it brings hot-footed
justice; for it attacks their eyes and hands and feet, and they fall the
prey of dropsy and wasting disease; and they are not even able to go
away, but are held on the spot and bemoan themselves at the edge of the
spring, acknowledging their perjuries. The people of the country, then,
say that Apollonius was the son of this Zeus, but the sage called
himself the son of Apollonius.

### CHAPTER VII

ON reaching the age when children are taught their letters, he showed
great strength of memory and power of application; and his tongue
affected the Attic dialect, nor was his accent corrupted by the race he
lived among. All eyes were turned upon

<span id="page_1:16">p. 16</span> <span id="page_1:17">p. 17</span>

him, for he was, moreover, conspicuous for his beauty. When he reached
his fourteenth year, his father brought him to Tarsus, to Euthydemus the
teacher from Phoenicia. Now Euthydemus was a good rhetor, and began his
education; but, though he was attached to his teacher, he found the
atmosphere of the city harsh and strange and little conducive to the
philosophic life, for nowhere are men more addicted than here to luxury;
jesters and full of insolence are they all; and they attend more to
their fine linen than the Athenians did to wisdom; and a stream called
the Cydnus runs through their city, along the banks of which they sit
like so many water-fowl. Hence the words which Apollonius addresses to
them in his letter: "Be done with getting drunk upon your water." He
therefore transferred his teacher, with his father's consent, to the
town of Aegae, which was close by, where he found a peace congenial to
one who would be a philosopher, and a more serious school of study and a
temple of Asclepius, where that god reveals himself in person to men.
There he had as his companions in philosophy followers of Plato and
Chrysippus and peripatetic philosophers. And he diligently attended also
to the discourses of Epicurus, for he did not despise these either,
although it was to those of Pythagoras that he applied himself with
unspeakable wisdom and ardor. However, his teacher of the Pythagorean
system was not a very serious person, nor one who practiced in his
conduct the philosophy he taught; for he was the slave of his belly and
appetites, and modeled himself upon Epicurus. And this man was Euxenus
from the town of Heraclea in Pontus, and he knew the principles of
Pythagoras just as

<span id="page_1:18">p. 18</span> <span id="page_1:19">p. 19</span>

birds know what they learn from men; for the birds will wish you
"farewell," and say "Good day" or "Zeus help you," and such like,
without understanding what they say and without any real sympathy for
mankind, merely because they have been trained to move their tongue in a
certain manner. Apollonius, however, was like the young eagles who, as
long as they are not fully fledged, fly alongside of their parents and
are trained by them in flight, but who, as soon as they are able to rise
in the air, outsoar the parent birds, especially when they perceive the
latter to be greedy and to be flying along the ground in order to snuff
the quarry; like them Apollonius attended Euxenus as long as he was a
child and was guided by him in the path of argument, but when he reached
his sixteenth year he indulged his impulse towards the life of
Pythagoras, being fledged and winged thereto by some higher power.
Notwithstanding he did not cease to love Euxenus, nay, he persuaded his
father to present him with a villa outside the town, where there were
tender groves and fountains, and he said to him: "Now you live there
your own life, but I will live that of Pythagoras."

### CHAPTER VIII

NOW Euxenus realized that he was attached to a lofty ideal, and asked
him at what point he would begin it. Apollonius answered: "At the point
at which physicians begin, for they, by purging the bowels of their
patients prevent some from being ill at all, and heal others." And
having said this he declined to live upon a flesh diet, on the ground
that it was unclean, and also that it made the mind gross; so he partook
only of dried fruits and vegetables,

<span id="page_1:20">p. 20</span> <span id="page_1:21">p. 21</span>

for he said that all the fruits of the earth are clean. And of wine he
said that it was a clean drink because it is yielded to men by so
well-domesticated a plant as the vine; but he declared that it
endangered the mental balance and system and darkened, as with mud, the
ether which is in the soul. After then having thus purged his interior,
he took to walking without shoes by way of adornment and clad himself in
linen raiment, declining to wear any animal product; and he let his hair
grow long and lived in the Temple. And the people round about the Temple
were struck with admiration for him, and the god Asclepius one day said
to the priest that he was delighted to have Apollonius as witness of his
cures of the sick; and such was his reputation that the Cilicians
themselves and the people all around flocked to Aegae to visit him.
Hence the Cilician proverb: "Whither runnest thou? Is it to see the
stripling?" Such was the saying that arose about him, and it gained the
distinction of becoming a proverb.

### CHAPTER IX

NOW it is well that I should not pass over what happened in the Temple,
while relating the life of a man who was held in esteem even by the
gods. For an Assyrian stripling came to Asclepius, and though he was
sick, yet he lived the life of luxury, and being continually drunk, I
will not say he lived, rather he was ever dying. He suffered then from
dropsy, and finding his pleasure in drunkenness took no care to dry up
his malady. On this account then Asclepius took no care of him, and did
not visit him even

<span id="page_1:22">p. 22</span> <span id="page_1:23">p. 23</span>

in a dream. The youth grumbled at this, and thereupon the god, standing
over him, said, "If you were to consult Apollonius you would be easier."
He therefore went to Apollonius, and said: "What is there in your wisdom
that I can profit by? for Asclepius bids me consult you." And he
replied: "I can advise you of what, under the circumstances, will be
most valuable to you; for I suppose you want to get well." "Yes, by
Zeus," answered the other, "I want the health which Asclepius promises,
but never gives." "Hush," said the other, "for he gives to those who
desire it, but you do things that irritate and aggravate your disease,
for you give yourself up to luxury, and you accumulate delicate viands
upon your water-logged and worn-out stomach, and as it were, choke water
with a flood of mud." This was a clearer response, in my opinion, than
Heraclitus, in his wisdom, gave. For he said when he was visited by this
affection that what he needed was someone to substitute a drought for a
rainy weather, a very unintelligible remark, it appears to me, and by no
means clear; but the sage restored the youth to health by a clear
interpretation of the wise saw.

### CHAPTER X

ONE day he saw a flood of blood upon the altar, and there were victims
laid out upon it, Egyptian bulls that had been sacrificed and great
hogs, and some of them were being flayed and others were being cut up;
and two gold vases had been dedicated set with jewels, the rarest and
most beautiful that India can provide. So he went to the priest and
said: "What is all this; for someone is making a

<span id="page_1:24">p. 24</span> <span id="page_1:25">p. 25</span>

very handsome gift to the god?" And the priest replied: "You may rather
be surprised at a man's offering all this without having first put up a
prayer in our fane, and without having stayed with us as long as other
people do, and without having gained his health from the god, and
without obtaining all the things he came to ask for. For he appears to
have come only yesterday, yet he is sacrificing on this lavish scale.
And he declares that he will sacrifice more victims, and dedicate more
gifts, if Asclepius will hearken to him. And he is one of the richest
men in existence; at any rate he owns in Cilicia an estate bigger than
all the Cilicians together possess. And he is supplicating the god to
restore to him one of his eyes that has fallen out." But Apollonius
fixed his eyes upon the ground, as he was accustomed to do in later
life, and asked: "What is his name?" And when he heard it, he said: "It
seems to me, O Priest, that we ought not to welcome this fellow in the
Temple: for he is some ruffian who has come here, and that he is
afflicted in this way is due to some sinister reason: nay, his very
conduct in sacrificing on such a magnificent scale before he has gained
anything from the god is not that of a genuine votary, but rather of a
man who is begging himself off for the penalty of some horrible and
cruel deed." This was what Apollonius said: and Asclepius appeared to
the priest by night, and said: "Send away so and so at once with all his
possessions, and let him keep them, for he deserves to lose the other
eye as well." The priest accordingly made inquiries about the Cilician
and learned that his wife by a former marriage borne a daughter, and he
had fallen in love with the maiden and had seduced her, and was living
with her in open sin. For the

<span id="page_1:26">p. 26</span> <span id="page_1:27">p. 27</span>

mother had surprised the two in bed, and had put out both her eyes and
one of his by stabbing them with her brooch-pin.
