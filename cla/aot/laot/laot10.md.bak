### CHAPTER XXXI

MY grandfather was king, and had the same name as myself; but my father
was a private person. For he was left quite young and two of his
relations were appointed guardians in accordance with the laws of the
Indians. But they did not carry on the king's government honestly on his
behalf. No, by the Sun, but so unfairly that their subjects found their
regime oppressive and the government fell into bad repute. A conspiracy
then was formed against them by some of the magnates, who attacked them

<span id="page_1:198">p. 198</span> <span id="page_1:199">p. 199</span>

and slew them when they were sacrificing to the river Indus. The
conspirators than seized upon the reins of government and took control
of the State. Now my father's kinsmen entertained apprehensions of him,
because he was not yet sixteen years of age, so they sent him across the
Hyphasis to the king there. And he has more subjects than I have, and
his country is much more fertile than this one. This monarch wished to
adopt him, but this my father declined on the ground that he would not
struggle with fate that robbed him of his kingdom; but he besought to
allow him to take his way to the sages and become a philosopher, for he
said that this would make it easier for him to bear the reverses of his
house. The king however being anxious to restore him to his father's
kingdom, my father said: "If you see that I am become a genuine
philosopher, then restore me; but if not, let me remain as I am." The
king accordingly went in person to the sages, and said that he would lie
under great obligation to them if they would take care of a youth who
had already showed such nobility of character, and they, discerning in
him something out of the common run, were delighted to impart to him
their wisdom, and were glad to educate him when they saw how addicted he
was to learning. Now seven years afterwards the king fell sick, and at
the very moment when he was dying, he sent for my father, and appointed
him co-heir in the government with his own son, and promised his
daughter in marriage to him as she was already of marriageable age. And
my father, since he saw that the king's son was the victim of flatterers
and of wine and of such like vices, and was also full of suspicions of
himself, said to

<span id="page_1:200">p. 200</span> <span id="page_1:201">p. 201</span>

him: "Do you keep all this and swill down the whole Empire as your own;
for it is ridiculous that one who could not even gain the kingdom which
belonged to him should presume to meddle with one which does not; but
give me your sister, for this is all I want of yours." So having
obtained her in marriage he lived hard by the sage in seven fertile
village which the king bestowed upon his sister as her pin-money. I then
am the issue of this marriage, and my father after a Greek education
brought me to the sages at an age somewhat too early perhaps, for I was
only twelve at the time, but they brought me up like their own son; for
any that they admit knowing the Greek tongue they are especially fond
of, because they consider that in virtue of the similarity of his
disposition he already belongs to themselves.

### CHAPTER XXXII

AND when my parents had died, which they did almost together, the sages
bade me repair to the villages and look after my own affairs, for I was
now nineteen years of age. But, alas, my good uncle had already taken
away the villages, and didn't even leave me the few acres my father had
acquired; for he said that the whole of them belonged to his kingdom,
and that I should get more than I deserved if he spared my life. I
accordingly raised a subscription among my mother's freedmen, and kept
four retainers. And one day when I was reading the play "The Children of
Heracles," a man presented himself from my own country, bringing a
letter from a person devoted to my father, who urged me to cross

<span id="page_1:202">p. 202</span> <span id="page_1:203">p. 203</span>

the river Hydraotes and confer with him about my present kingdom; for he
said there was a good prospect of recovering it, if I did not dawdle. I
cannot but think that some god set me on reading this drama at the
moment, and I followed the omen; and having crossed the river I learnt
that one of the usurpers of the throne was dead, and that the other was
besieged in this very palace. Accordingly I hurried forward, and
proclaimed to the inhabitants of the villages through which I passed
that I was the sons of so and so, naming my father, and that I was come
to take possession of my own kingdom; but they received me with open
arms and escorted me, recognizing my resemblance to my grandfather, and
they had daggers and bows, and our numbers increased from day to day.
And when I approached the gates the population received me with such
enthusiasm that they snatched up torches off the altar of the Sun and
came before the gates and escorted me hither with many hymns in praise
of my father and grandfather. But the drone that was within they walled
up, although I protested against his being put to such death."

### CHAPTER XXXIII

HERE Apollonius interrupted and said: "You have exactly played the part
of the restored sons of Heracles in the play, and praised be the gods
who have helped so noble a man to come by his own and restored you by
their noble intervention. But tell me this about these sages: were they
not once actually subject to Alexander, and were they not brought before
him

<span id="page_1:204">p. 204</span> <span id="page_1:205">p. 205</span>

to philosophize about the heavens?" "Those were the Oxydracae," he said,
"and a race that has always been independent and well equipped for war;
and they assert that they deal in wisdom, though they know nothing of
value. But the genuine sages live between the Hyphasis and the Ganges,
in a country which Alexander never assailed; not I imagine because he
was afraid of what was in it, but, I think, because the omens warned him
against it. But if he had crossed the Hyphasis, and had been able to
take the surrounding country, he could certainly never have taken
possession of their castle in which they live, not even if he had had
ten thousand like Achilles, and thirty thousand like Ajax behind him;
for they do not do battle with those who approach them, but they repulse
them with prodigies and thunderbolts which they send forth, for they are
holy men and beloved of the gods. It is related, anyhow, that Heracles
of Egypt and Dionysus after they had overrun the Indian people with
their arms, at last attached them in company, and that they constructed
engines of war, and tried to take the place by assault; but the sages,
instead of taking the field against them, lay quiet and passive, as it
seemed to the enemy; but as soon as the latter approached they were
driven off by rockets of fire and thunderbolts which were hurled
obliquely from above and fell upon their armor. It was on that occasion,
they say, that Hercules lost his golden shield, and the sages dedicated
it as an offering, partly out of respect for Hercules’ reputation, and
partly because of the reliefs upon the shield. For in these Hercules is
represented fixing the frontier of the world at Gadira, and using

<span id="page_1:206">p. 206</span> <span id="page_1:207">p. 207</span>

the mountains for pillars, and confining the ocean within its bounds.
Thence it is clear that it was not the Theban Hercules, but the Egyptian
one, that came to Gadira, and fixed the limits of the world."

### CHAPTER XXXIV

WHILE they were thus talking, the strain of the hymn sung to the pipe
fell upon their ears, and Apollonius asked the king what was the meaning
of their cheerful ode. "The Indians," he answered, "sing their
admonitions to the king, at the moment of his going to bed; and they
pray that he may have good dreams, and rise up propitious and affable
towards his subjects." "And how," said Apollonius, "do you, O king, feel
in regard to this matter? For it is yourself I suppose that they honor
with their pipes." "I don't laugh at them," he said, "for I must allow
it because of the law, although I do not require any admonition of the
kind: for in so far as a king behaves himself with moderation and
integrity, he will bestow, I imagine, favors on himself rather than on
his subjects."

### CHAPTER XXXV

AFTER this conversation they laid themselves down to repose; but when a
new day had dawned, the king himself went to the chamber in which
Apollonius and his companions were sleeping, and gently stroking the bed
he addressed the sage, and asked him what

<span id="page_1:208">p. 208</span> <span id="page_1:209">p. 209</span>

he was thinking about. "For," he said, "I don't imagine you are asleep,
since you drink water and despise wine." Said the other: "Then you don't
think that those who drink water go to sleep?" "Yes," said the king,
"they sleep, but with a very light sleep, which just sits upon the tips
of their eyelids, as we say, but not upon their minds." "Nay with both
do they sleep," said Apollonius, "and perhaps more with the mind than
with the eyelids. For unless the mind is thoroughly composed, the eyes
will not admit of sleep either. For note how madmen are not able to go
to sleep because their mind leaps with excitement, and their thoughts
run coursing hither and thither, so that their glances are full of fury
and morbid impulse, like those of the dragons who never sleep. Since
then, O king," he went on, "we have clearly intimated the use and
function of sleep, and what it signifies for men, let us examine whether
the drinker of water need sleep less soundly than the drunkard." "Do not
quibble," said the king, "for if you put forward the case of a drunkard,
he, I admit, will not sleep at all, for his mind is in a state of revel,
and whirls him about and fills him with uproar. All, I tell you, who try
to go to sleep when in drink seem to themselves to be rushed up on the
roof, and then to be dashed down to the ground, and to fall into a
whirl, as they say happened to Ixion. Now I do not put the case of a
drunkard, but of a man who has merely drunk wine, but remains sober; I
wish to consider whether he will sleep, and how much better he will
sleep than a man who drinks no wine."

<span id="page_1:210">p. 210</span> <span id="page_1:211">p. 211</span>

### CHAPTER XXXVI

APOLLONIUS then summoned Damis, and said: "’tis a clever man with whom
we are discussing and one thoroughly trained in argument." "I see it is
so, " said Damis, "and perhaps this is what is meant by the phrase
'catching a Tartar'. But the argument excites me very much, of which he
has delivered himself; so it is time for you to wake up and finish it."
Apollonius then raised his head slightly and said: "Well I will prove,
out of your own lips and following your own argument, how much advantage
we who drink water have in that we sleep more sweetly. For you have
clearly stated and admitted that the minds of drunkards are disordered
and are in a condition of madness; for we see those who are under the
spell of drink imagining that they see two moons at once and two suns,
while those who have drunk less, even though they are quite sober, while
they entertain no such delusions as these, are yet full of exultation
and pleasure; and this fit of joy often falls upon them, even though
they have not had any good luck, and men in such a condition will plead
cases, although they never opened their lips before in a law court, and
they will tell you they are rich, although they have not a farthing in
their pockets. Now these, O king, are the affections of a madman. For
the mere pleasure of drinking disturbs their judgment, and I have known
many of them who were so firmly convinced that they were well off, that
they were unable to sleep, but leapt up in their slumbers, and this is
the meaning of the saying that 'good fortune itself is a reason for
being anxious.'

<span id="page_1:212">p. 212</span> <span id="page_1:213">p. 213</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Men have also
devised sleeping draughts, by drinking or anointing themselves with
which, people at once stretch themselves out and go to sleep as if they
were dead; but when they wake up from such sleep it is with a sort of
forgetfulness, and they imagine that they are anywhere rather than where
they are. Now these draughts are not exactly drunk, but I would rather
say that they drench the soul and body; for they do not induce any sound
or proper sleep, but the deep coma of a man half dead, or the light and
distracted sleep of men haunted by phantoms, even though they be
wholesome ones; and you will, I think, agree with me in this, unless you
are disposed to quibble rather than argue seriously. But those who drink
water, as I do see things as they really are, and they do not record in
fancy things that are not; and they were never found to be giddy, nor
full of drowsiness, or of silliness, nor unduly elated; but they are
wide awake and thoroughly rational, and always the same, whether late in
the evening or early in the morning when the market is crowded; for
these men never nod, even though they pursue their studies far into the
night. For sleep does not drive them forth, pressing down like a
slave-holder upon their necks, that are bowed down by the wine; but you
find them free and erect, and they go to bed with a clear, pure soul and
welcome sleep, and are neither buoyed up by the bubbles of their own
private luck, nor scared out of their wits by any adversity. For the
soul meets both alternatives with equal calm, if it be sober and not
overcome by either feeling; and that is why it can sleep a delightful
sleep untouched by the sorrows which startle others from their couches.

<span id="page_1:214">p. 214</span> <span id="page_1:215">p. 215</span>

### CHAPTER XXXVII

AND more than this, as a faculty of divination by means of dreams, which
is the divines and most godlike of human faculties, the soul detects the
truth all the more easily when it is not muddied by wine, but accepts
the message unstained and scans it carefully. Anyhow, the explains of
dreams and visions, those whom the poets call interpreters of dreams,
will never undertake to explain any vision to anyone without having
first asked the time when it was seen. For if it was at dawn and in the
sleep of morning tide, they calculate its meaning on the assumption that
the soul is then in a condition to divine soundly and healthily, because
by then it has cleansed itself of the stains of wine. But if the vision
was seen in the first sleep or at midnight, when the soul is still
immersed in the lees of wine and muddied thereby, they decline to make
any suggestions, and they are wise. And that the gods also are of this
opinion, and that they commit the faculty of oracular response to souls
which are sober, I will clearly show. There was, O king, a seer among
the Greeks called Amphiaros." "I know," said the other; "for you allude,
I imagine, to the son of Oecles, who was swallowed up alive by the earth
on his way back from Thebes." "This man, O king," said Apollonius,
"still divines in Attica, inducing dreams in those who consult him, and
the priests take a man who wishes to consult him, and they prevent his
eating for one day, and from drinking wine for three, in order that he
may imbibe the oracles with his soul in a condition of utter
transparency. But if wine were

<span id="page_1:216">p. 216</span> <span id="page_1:217">p. 217</span>

a good drug of sleep, then the wise Amphiaros would have bidden his
votaries to adopt the opposite regimen, and would have had them carried
into his shrine as full of wine as leather flagons. And I could mention
many oracles, held in repute by Greeks and barbarians alike, where the
priest utters his responses from the tripod after imbibing water and not
wine. So you may consider me also as a fit vehicle of the god, O king,
along with all who drink water. For we are rapt by the nymphs and are
bacchantic revelers in sobriety." "Well, then," said the king, "you must
make me too, O Apollonius, a member of your religious brotherhood." "I
would do so," said the other, "provided only you will not be esteemed
vulgar and held cheap by your subjects. For in the case of a king a
philosophy that is at once moderate and indulgent makes a good mixture,
as is seen in your own case; but an excess of rigor and severity would
seem vulgar, O king, and beneath your august station; and, what is more,
it might be construed by the envious as due to pride."

### CHAPTER XXXVIII

WHEN they had thus conversed, for by this time it was daylight, they
went out into the open. And Apollonius, understanding that the king had
to give audience to embassies and such-like said: "You then, O king,
must attend to the business of state, but let me go and devote this hour
to the Sun, for I must needs offer up to him my accustomed prayer." "And
I pray he may hear your prayer," said the king, "for he will bestow his
grace on all who find pleasure

<span id="page_1:218">p. 218</span> <span id="page_1:219">p. 219</span>

in your wisdom; but I will wait for you until you return, for I have to
decide some cases in which your presence will very greatly help me."

### CHAPTER XXXIX

APOLLONIUS then returned, when the day was already for advanced and
asked him about the cases which he had been judging; but he answered:
"Today I have not judged any, for the omens did not allow me."
Apollonius then replied and said: "It is the case then that you consult
the omens in such cases as these, just as you do when you are setting
out on a journey or a campaign." "Yes, by Zeus," he said, "for there is
a risk in this case, too, of one who is a judge straying from the right
line." Apollonius felt that what he said was true, and asked him again
what the suit was which he had to decide; "For I see," he said, "that
you have given your attention to it and are perplexed what verdict to
give." "I admit," said the king, "that I am perplexed; and that is why I
want your advice; for one man has sold to another land, in which there
lay a treasure as yet undiscovered, and some time afterwards the land,
being broken up, revealed a certain chest, which the person who sold the
land says belongs to him rather than the other, for that he would never
have sold the land, if he had known beforehand that he had a fortune
thereon; but the purchaser claims that he acquired everything that he
found in land, which thenceforth was his. And, both their contentions
are just; and I shall seem ridiculous if I order them

<span id="page_1:220">p. 220</span> <span id="page_1:221">p. 221</span>

to share the gold between them, for any old woman could settle the
matter in that way." Apollonius thereupon replied as follows: "The fact
that they are quarreling about gold shows that these two men are no
philosophers; and you will, in my opinion, give the best verdict if you
bear this in mind, that the gods attach the first importance and have
most care for those who live a life of philosophy together with moral
excellence, and only pay secondary attention to those who have committed
no faults and were never found unjust. Now they entrust to philosophers
the task of rightly discerning things divine and human as they should be
discerned, but to those who merely are of good character they give
enough to live upon, so hat they may never be rendered unjust by actual
lack of the necessaries of life. It seems then to me, O king, right to
weight these men in the balance, as it were, and to examine their
respective lives; for I cannot believe that the gods would deprive the
one even of his land, unless he was a bad man, or that they would, on
the other hand, bestow on the other even what was under the land, unless
he was better than the man who sold it." The two claimants came back the
next day, and the seller was convicted of being a ruffian who had
neglected the sacrifices, which it was his bounden duty to sacrifice to
the gods on that land <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md); but the other
was found to be a decent man and a most devout worshipper of the gods.
Accordingly, the opinion of Apollonius prevailed, and the better of the
two men quitted the court as one on whom the gods had bestowed this
boon.

<span id="page_1:222">p. 222</span> <span id="page_1:223">p. 223</span>

### CHAPTER XL

WHEN the law-suit had been thus disposed of, Apollonius approached the
Indian, and said: " This the third day, O king, that you have made me
your guest; and at dawn to-morrow I must quit your land in accordance
with the law." "But," said the other, " the law does not yet speak to
you thus, for you can remain on the morrow, since you came after
midday." "I am delighted," said Apollonius, "with your hospitality, and
indeed you seem to me to be straining the law for my sake." "Yes indeed,
and I would I could break it," said the king, "in your behalf; but tell
me this, Apollonius, did not the camels bring you from Babylon which
they say you were riding?" "They did," he said, "and Vardanes gave them
us." "Will they then be able to carry you on, after they have come
already so many stades from Babylon?" Apollonius made no answer, but
Damis said: "O king, our friend here does not understand anything about
our journey, nor about the races among which we shall find ourselves in
future; but he regards our passage into India as mere child's play,
under the impression that he will everywhere have you and Vardanes to
help him. I assure you, the true condition of the camels has not been
acknowledged to you; for they are in such an evil state that we could
carry them rather than they us, and we must have others. For if they
collapse anywhere in the wilderness of India, we," he continued, "shall
have to sit down and drive off the vultures and wolves from the camels,
and as no one will drive them off from

<span id="page_1:224">p. 224</span> <span id="page_1:225">p. 225</span>

us we shall perish too." The king answered accordingly and said: "I will
remedy this, for I will give you other camels, and you need four I
think, and the satrap ruling the Indus will send back four others to
Babylon. But I have a herd of camels on the Indus, all of them white."
"And," said Damis, "will you not also give us a guide, O king?" "Yes, of
course," he answered, "and I will give a camel to the guide and
provisions, and I will write a letter to Iarchas, the oldest of the
sages, praying him to welcome Apollonius as warmly as he did myself, and
to welcome you also as philosophers and followers of a divine man." And
forthwith the Indian gave them gold and precious stones and linen and a
thousand other such things. And Apollonius said that he had enough gold
already, because Vardanes had given it to the guide on the sly; but that
he would accept the linen robes, because they were like the cloaks worn
by the ancient and genuine inhabitants of Attica. And he took up one of
the stones and said: "O rare stone, how opportunely have I found you,
and how providentially!" detecting in it, I imagine, some secret and
divine virtue. Neither would the companions of Damis accept for
themselves the gold; nevertheless they took good handfuls of the gems,
in order to dedicate them to the gods, whenever they should regain their
own country.
