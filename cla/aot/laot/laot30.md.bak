### CHAPTER I

<span class="smallcaps">Ethiopia</span> covers the western wing of the
entire earth under the sun, just as India does the eastern wing; and at
Meroe it adjoins Egypt, and, after skirting a part of Libya Incognita,
it ends at the sea which the poets call by the name of the Ocean, that
being the name they applied to the mass of water which surrounds the
earth. This country supplies Egypt with the river Nile, which takes its
rise at the cataracts (*Catadupi*), and brings down from Ethiopia all
Egypt, the soil of which in flood-time it inundates. Now in size this
country is not worthy of comparison with India, not for that matter is
any of the continents that are famous among men; and even if you put
together all Egypt with Ethiopia, and we may regard the river as so
combining the two, we should not compare the two together with India, so
vast is the standard of comparison. However their respective rivers, the

<span id="page_2:4">p. 4</span> <span id="page_2:5">p. 5</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indus and the
Nile, resemble one another, if we consider their creatures. For they
both spread their moisture over the land in the summer season, when the
earth most wants it, and unlike all other rivers they produced the
crocodile and the river-horse; and the religious rites celebrated over
them correspond with one another, for many of the religious invocations
of the Indians are repeated in the case of the Nile. We have a proof of
the similarity of the two countries in the spices which are found in
them, also in the fact that the lion and the elephant are captured and
confined in both the one and the other. They are also the haunts of
animals not found elsewhere, and of black men -a feature not found in
other continents- and we meet in them with races of pigmies and of
people who bark in various ways instead of talking, and other wonders of
the kind. And the griffins of the Indians and the ants of the
Ethiopians, though they are dissimilar in form, yet, from what we hear,
play similar parts; for in each country they are the guardians of gold,
and devoted to the gold reefs of the two countries. But we will not
pursue these subjects; for we must resume the course of our history and
follow in the sage's footsteps.

### CHAPTER II

<span class="smallcaps">For</span> when he arrived at the confines of
Ethiopia and Egypt, and the name of the place is Sycaminus, he came
across a quantity of uncoined gold and linen and an elephant and various
roots and myrrh and spices, which are all lying without anyone to

<span id="page_2:6">p. 6</span> <span id="page_2:7">p. 7</span>

watch them at the crossways. I will explain the meaning of this, for the
same custom still survives among ourselves. It was a market place to
which the Ethiopians bring all the products of their country; and the
Egyptians in their turn take them all away and bring to the same spot
their own wares of equal value, so bartering what they have got for what
they have not. Now the inhabitants of the marches are not yet fully
black but are half-breeds in matter of color, for they are partly not so
black as the Ethiopians, yet partly more so than the Egyptians.
Apollonius, accordingly, when he realized the character of the market,
remarked: "Contrast our good Hellenes: they pretend they cannot live
unless one penny begets another and unless they can force up the price
of their goods by chaffering or holding them back; and one pretends that
he has got a daughter whom it is time to marry, and another that he has
got a son who has just reached manhood, and a third that he has to pay
his subscription to his club, and a fourth that he is having a house
built for him, and a fifth that he would be ashamed of being thought a
worse man of business than his father was before him. What a splendid
thing then it would be, if wealth were held in less honor and equality
flourished a little more and 'if the black iron were left to rust in the
ground,' for all men would agree with one another, and the whole earth
would be like one brotherhood."

### CHAPTER III

With such conversations, the occasions providing as usual the topics he
talked about, he turned his

<span id="page_2:8">p. 8</span> <span id="page_2:9">p. 9</span>

steps towards Memnon; an Egyptian showed them the way, of whom Damis
gives the following account: Timasion was the name of this stripling,
who was just emerging from boyhood, and was now in the prime of life and
strength. He had a stepmother who had fallen in love with him; and when
he rejected her overtures, she set upon him and by way of spiting him
had poisoned his father's mind against him, condescending to a lower
intrigue than ever Phaedra had done, for she accused him of being
effeminate, and of finding his pleasure in pederasts rather than in
women. He had accordingly abandoned Naucratis, for it was there that all
this happened, and was living in the neighborhood of Memphis; and he had
acquired and manned a boat of his own and was plying as a waterman on
the Nile. He then, was going down the river when he saw Apollonius
sailing up it; and he concluded that the crew consisted of wise men,
because he judged them by the cloaks they wore and the books they were
hard at work studying. So he asked them whether they would allow one who
was so passionately fond of wisdom as himself to share their voyage; and
Apollonius said: "This youth is wise, my friends, so let him be granted
his request." And he further related the story about his stepmother to
those of his companions who were nearest to him in a low tone while the
stripling was still sailing towards them. But when the ships were
alongside of one another, Timasion stepped out of his boat, and after
addressing a word or two to his pilot, about the cargo in his own boat,
he greeted the company. Apollonius then ordered him to sit down under
his eyes, and said: "You stripling of Egypt, for you seem to be one of
the natives, tell me what you have done of evil or what of good; for in
the one case you

<span id="page_2:10">p. 10</span> <span id="page_2:11">p. 11</span>

shall be forgiven by me, in consideration of your youth; but in the
other you shall reap my commendation and become a fellow-student of
philosophy with me and with these gentlemen." Then noticing that
Timasion blushed and checked his impulse to speak, and hesitated whether
to say or not what he had been going to say, he pressed his question and
repeated it, just as if he had no foreknowledge of the youth at his
command. Then Timasion plucked up courage and said: "O Heavens, how
shall I describe myself? for I am not a bad boy, and yet I do not know
whether I ought to be considered a good one, for there is no particular
merit in having abstained from wrong." But Apollonius cried: "Bravo, my
boy, you answer me just as if you were a sage from India; for this was
just the sentiment of the divine Iarchas. But tell me how you came to
form these opinions, and how long ago; for it strikes me that you have
been on your guard against some sin." The youth then began to tell them
of his stepmother's infatuation for himself, and of how he had rejected
her advances; and when he did so, there was a shout in recognition of
the divine inspiration under which Apollonius had foretold these
details. Timasion, however, caught them up and said: "Most excellent
people, what is the matter with you? for my story is one which calls as
little for your admiration, I think, as for your ridicule." But Damis
said: "It was not that we were admiring, but something else which you
don't know about yet. As for you, my boy, we praise you because you
think that you did nothing

<span id="page_2:12">p. 12</span> <span id="page_2:13">p. 13</span>

very remarkable." And Apollonius said: "Do you sacrifice to Aphrodite,
my boy?" And Timasion answered: "Yes, by Zeus, every day; for I consider
that this goddess has great influence in human and divine affairs."
Thereat Apollonius was delighted beyond measure, and cried: "Let us,
gentlemen, vote a crown to him for his continence rather than to
Hippolytus the son of Theseus, for the latter insulted Aphrodite; and
that perhaps is why he never fell a victim to the tender passion, and
why love never ran riot in his soul; but he was allotted an austere and
unbending nature. But our friend here admits that he is devoted to the
goddess, and yet did not respond to his stepmother's guilty overtures,
but went away in terror of the goddess herself, in case he were not on
his guard against another's evil passions; and the mere aversion to any
one of the gods, such as Hippolytus entertained in regard to Aphrodite,
I do not class as a form of sobriety; for it is a much greater proof of
wisdom and sobriety to speak well of the gods, especially at Athens,
where altars are set up in honor even of unknown gods." So great was the
interest which he took in Timasion. Nevertheless he called him
Hippolytus for the eyes with which he looked at his stepmother. It
seemed also that he was a young man who was particular about his person
and enhanced its charms by attention to athletic exercises.

### CHAPTER IV

Under his guidance, they say, they went on to the sacred enclosure of
Memnon, of whom Damis gives the following account. He says that he was

<span id="page_2:14">p. 14</span> <span id="page_2:15">p. 15</span>

the son of the Dawn, and that he did not meet his death in Troy, where
indeed he never went; but that he died in Ethiopia after ruling the land
for five generations. But his countrymen being the longest lived of men,
still mourn him as a mere youth and deplore his untimely death. But the
place in which his statue is set up resembles, they tell us, an ancient
market-place, such as remain in cities that were long ago inhabited, and
where we come on broken stumps and fragments of columns, and find traces
of walls as well as seats and jambs of doors, and images of Hermes, some
destroyed by the hand of man, others by that of time. Now this statue,
says Damis, was turned towards the sunrise, and was that of a youth
still unbearded; and it was made of a black stone, and the two feet were
joined together after the style in which statues were made in the time
of Daedalus; and the arms of the figure were perpendicular to the seat
pressing upon it, for though the figure was still sitting it was
represented in the very act of rising up. We hear much of this attitude
of the statue, and of the expression of its eyes, and of how the lips
seem about to speak; but they say that they had no opportunity of
admiring these effects until they saw them realized; for when the sun's
rays fell upon the statue, and this happened exactly at dawn, they could
not restrain their admiration; for the lips spoke immediately the sun's
ray touched them, and the eyes seemed to stand out and gleam against the
light as do those of men who love to bask in the sun. Then they say they
understood that the figure was of one in the act of rising and making
obeisance to the sun, in the way those do who worship the

<span id="page_2:16">p. 16</span> <span id="page_2:17">p. 17</span>

powers above standing erect. They accordingly offered a sacrifice to the
Sun of Ethiopia and to Memnon of the Dawn, for this the priests
recommended them to do, explaining that one name was derived from the
words signifying "to burn and be warm" <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) and the other from his mother. Having done
this they set out upon camels for the home of the naked philosophers.

### CHAPTER V

On the way they met a man wearing the garb of the inhabitants of
Memphis, but who was wandering about rather than wending his steps to a
fixed point; so Damis asked him who he was and why he was roving about
like that. But Timasion said: "You had better ask me, and not him; for
he will never tell you what is the matter with him, because he is
ashamed of the plight in which he finds himself; but as for me, I know
the poor man and pity him, and I will tell you all about him. For he has
slain unwittingly a certain inhabitant of Memphis, and the laws of
Memphis prescribe that a person exiled for an involuntary offense of
this kind,—and the penalty is exile,—should remain with the naked
philosophers until he has washed away the guilt of bloodshed, and then
he may return home as soon as he is pure, though he must first go to the
tomb of the slain man and sacrifice there some trifling victim. Now
until he has been received by the naked philosophers, so long he must
roam about these marches, until they take pity

<span id="page_2:18">p. 18</span> <span id="page_2:19">p. 19</span>

upon him as if he were a suppliant." Apollonius therefore put the
question to Timasion: "What do the naked philosophers think of this
particular exile?" And he answered: "I do not know anything more than
that this is the seventh month that he has remained here as a suppliant,
and that he has not yet obtained redemption." Said Apollonius: "You
don't call men wise, who refuse to purify him, and are not aware that
Philiscus whom he slew was a descendant of Thamus the Egyptian, who long
ago laid waste the country of these naked philosophers." Thereat
Timasion said in surprise: "What do you mean?" " I mean," said the
other, "my good youth, what was actually the fact; for this Thamus once
on a time was intriguing against the inhabitants of Memphis, and these
philosophers detected his plot and prevented him; and he having failed
in his enterprise retaliated by laying waste all the land upon which
they live, for by his brigandage he tyrannized the country round
Memphis. I perceive that Philiscus whom this man slew was the thirteenth
in descent from this Thamus, and was obviously an object of execration
to those whose country the latter so thoroughly ravaged at the time in
question. Where then is their wisdom? Here is a man that they ought to
crown, even if he had slain the other intentionally; and yet they refuse
to purge him of a murder which he committed involuntarily on their
behalf.". The youth then was astounded and said: "Stranger, who are
you?" And Apollonius replied: "He whom you shall find among these naked
philosophers. But as it is not allowed me by my religion to address one
who

<span id="page_2:20">p. 20</span> <span id="page_2:21">p. 21</span>

is stained with blood, I would ask you, my good boy, to encourage him,
and tell him that he will at once be purged of guilt, if he will come to
the place where I am lodging." And when the man in question came,
Apollonius went through the rites over him which Empedocles and
Pythagoras prescribe for the purification of such offenses, and told him
to return home, for that he was now pure of guilt.

### CHAPTER VI

Thence they rode out at sunrise, and arrived before midday at the
academy of the naked sages, who dwell, they relate, upon a
moderate-sized hill a little way from the bank of the Nile; and in point
of wisdom they fall short of the Indians rather more than they excel the
Egyptians. And they wear next to no clothes in the same way as people do
at Athens in the heat of summer. And in their district there are few
trees, and a certain grove of no great size to which they resort when
they meet for the transaction of common affairs; but they do not build
their shrines in one and the same place, as Indian shrines are built,
but one is in one part of the hill and another in another, all worthy of
observation, according to the accounts of the Egyptians. The Nile is the
chief object of their worship, for they regard this river as land and
water at once. They have no need, however, of hut or dwelling, because
they live in the open air directly under the heaven itself, but they
have built an hospice to accommodate strangers, and it is a portico of
no great size, about equal in length to those of Elis, beneath which the
athletes await the sound of the midday trumpet.

<span id="page_2:22">p. 22</span> <span id="page_2:23">p. 23</span>

### CHAPTER VII

At this place Damis records an action of Euphrates, which if we do not
regard it as juvenile, was anyhow unworthy of the dignity of a
philosopher. Euphrates had heard Apollonius often say that he wished to
compare the wisdom of India with that of Egypt, so he sent up to the
naked sages one Thrasybulus, a native of Naucratis, to take away our
sage's character. Thrasybulus at the same time that he pretended to have
come there in order to enjoy their society, told them that the sage of
Tyana would presently arrive, and that they would have no little trouble
with him, because he esteemed himself more highly than the sages of
India did themselves, though he extolled the latter whenever he opened
his mouth; and he added that Apollonius had contrived a thousand
pitfalls for them, and that he would not allow any sort of influence
either to the sun, or to the sky, or to the earth, but pretended to move
and juggle and rearrange these forces for whatever end he chose.

### CHAPTER VIII

Having concocted these stories the man of Naucratis went away; and they,
imagining they were true, did not indeed decline to meet Apollonius when
he arrived, but pretended that they were occupied with important
business and were so intent upon it, that they could only arrange an
interview with him if they had time, and if they were informed first of
what he wanted and of what attracted him thither.

<span id="page_2:24">p. 24</span> <span id="page_2:25">p. 25</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And a messenger
from the bade them stay and lodge in the portico, but Apollonius
remarked: "We do not want to hear about a house for ourselves, for the
climate here is such that anyone can live naked,"—an unkind reference
this to them, as it implied that they went without clothes not to show
their endurance, but because it was too to wear any. And he added: "I am
not surprised indeed at their nor yet knowing what I want, and what I am
come here for, though the Indians never asked me these questions."

### CHAPTER IX

Accordingly Apollonius lay down under one of the trees, and let his
companions who were there with him ask whatever question they pleased.
Damis took Timasion apart and asked him the question in private: "About
these naked sages, my good fellow, as you have lived with them, and in
all probability know, tell me what their wisdom comes to?" "It is,"
answered the other, "manifold an profound." "And yet," said Damis,
"their demeanor towards us does not evince any wisdom, my fine fellow;
for when they refuse to converse about wisdom with so great a man as our
master, and assume all sorts of airs against him, what can I say of them
except that they are too vain and proud." "Pride and vanity!" said the
other, "I have already come among them twice, and I never saw any such
thing about them; for they were always very modest and courteous towards
those who came to visit them. At any rate a little time ago, perhaps a
matter of fifty days, one Thrasybulus was staying here who

<span id="page_2:26">p. 26</span> <span id="page_2:27">p. 27</span>

achieved nothing remarkable in philosophy, and they received him with
open arms merely because he said he was a disciple of Euphrates." Then
Damis cried: "What's that you say, my boy? Then you saw Thrasybulus of
Naucratis in this academy of theirs?" "Yes, and what's more," answered
the other, "I conveyed him hence, when he went down the river, in my own
boat." "Now I have it, by Athena," cried Damis, in a loud tone of
indignation. "I warrant he has played us some dirty trick." Timasion
then replied: "Your master, when I asked him yesterday who he was, would
not answer me at once, but kept his name a secret; but do you, unless
this is a mystery, tell me who he is, for then I could probably help you
to find what you seek." And when he heard from Damis, that it was the
sage of Tyana, "You have put the matter," he said, "in a nutshell. For
Thrasybulus, as he descended the Nile with me, in answer to my question
what he had gone up there for, explained to me that his love for wisdom
was not genuine, and said that he had filled these naked sages with
suspicion of Apollonius, to the end that whenever he came here they
might flout him; and what his quarrel is with him I know not, but
anyhow, it is, I think, worthy of a woman or of a vulgar person to
backbite him as he has done. But I will address myself to these people
and ascertain their real disposition; for they are friendly to me." And
about eventide Timasion returned, though without telling Apollonius any
more than that he had interchanged words with them; however he told
Damis in private that they meant to come the next morning primed with
all that they had heard from Thrasybulus.

<span id="page_2:28">p. 28</span> <span id="page_2:29">p. 29</span>

### CHAPTER X

They spent that evening conversing about trifles which are not worth
recording, and then they lay down to sleep on the spot where they had
supped; but at daybreak Apollonius, after adoring the sun according to
his custom, had set himself to meditate upon some problem, when Nilus,
who was the youngest of the naked philosophers, running up to him,
exclaimed: "We are coming to you." "Quite right," said Apollonius, "for
to get to you I have made this long journey from the sea all the way
here." And with these words he followed Nilus. So after exchanging
greetings with the sages, and they met him close to the portico.
"Where," said Apollonius, "shall we hold our interview?" "Here," said
Thespesion, pointing to the grove. Now Thespesion was the eldest of the
sect, and led them in procession; and they followed him with an orderly
and leisurely step, just as the jury of the athletic sports at Olympia
follow the eldest of their number. And when they had sat down, which
they did anyhow, and without the observing their previous order, they
all fixed their eyes on Thespesion as the one who should regale them
with a discourse, which he proceeded as follows: "They say, Apollonius,
that you have visited the Pythian and Olympian festivals; for this was
reported of you here by Stratocles of Pharos, who says he met you there.
Now those who come to the Pythian festival are, they say, escorted with
the sound of pipe and song and lyre, and are honored with shows of
comedies and tragedies; and then last of all they are presented

<span id="page_2:30">p. 30</span> <span id="page_2:31">p. 31</span>

with an exhibition of games and races run by naked athletes. At the
Olympic festival, however, these superfluities are omitted as
inappropriate and unworthy of the place; and those who go to the
festival are only provided with the show of naked athletes originally
instituted by Heracles. You may see the same contrast between the wisdom
of the Indians and our own. For they, like those who invite others to
the Pythian festival, appeal to the crowd with all sorts of charms and
wizardry; but we, like the athletes of Olympia, go naked. Here earth
strews for us no couches, nor does it yield us milk or wine as if we
were bacchants, nor does the air uplift us and sustain us aloft. But the
earth beneath us is our only couch, and we live by partaking of its
natural fruits, which we would have it yield to us gladly and without
being tortured against its will. But you shall see that we are not
unable to work tricks if we like. Heigh! you tree yonder," he cried,
pointing to an elm tree, the third in the row from that under which they
were talking, "just salute the wise Apollonius, will you?" And forthwith
the tree saluted him, as it was bidden to do, in accents which were
articulate and like those of a woman. Now he wrought this sign to
discredit the Indians, and in the belief that by doing so he would wean
Apollonius of his excessive estimate of their powers; for he was always
recounting to everybody what the Indians said and did.

Then the Egyptian added these precepts: he said that it is sufficient
for the sage to abstain from eating all flesh of living animals, and
from the roving desires which mount up in the soul through the eyes, and
from envy which ends by teaching injustice to

<span id="page_2:32">p. 32</span> <span id="page_2:33">p. 33</span>

hand and will, and that truth stands not in need of miracle-mongering
and sinister arts. "For look," he said, "at the Apollo of Delphi, who
keeps the center of Hellas for the utterance of his oracles. There then,
as you probably know yourself, a person who desires a response, puts his
question briefly, and Apollo tells what he knows without any miraculous
display. And yet it would be just as easy for him to convulse the whole
mountain of Parnassus, and to alter the springs of the Castalian
fountain so that it should run with wine, and to check the river
Cephisus and stay its stream; but he reveals the bare truth without any
of this show of ostentation. Nor must we suppose that it is by his will,
that so much gold and showy offerings enter his treasury, nor that he
would care for his temple even if it were made twice as large as it
already is. For once on a time this god Apollo dwelt in quite a humble
habitation; and a little hut was constructed for him to which the bees
are said to have contributed their honeycomb and wax, and the birds
their feathers. For simplicity is the teacher of wisdom and the teacher
of truth; and you must embrace it, if you would have men think you
really wise, and forget all your legendary tales that you have acquired
among the Indians. For what need is there to beat the drum over such
simple matters as: 'Do this, or do not do it,' or 'I know it, or I do
not know it,' or 'It is this and not that'? What do you want with
thunder, nay, I would say, What do you want to be thunder-struck for?

You have seen in picture-books the representation of Heracles by
Prodicus; in it Heracles is represented as a youth, who has not yet
chosen the life he

<span id="page_2:34">p. 34</span> <span id="page_2:35">p. 35</span>

will lead; and vice and virtue stand in each side of him plucking his
garments and trying to draw him to themselves. Vice is adorned with gold
and necklaces and with purple raiment, and her cheeks are painted and
her hair delicately plaited and her eyes underlined with henna; and she
also wears golden slippers, for she is pictured strutting about in
these; but virtue in the picture resembles a woman worn out with toil,
with a pinched look; and she has chosen for her adornment rough squalor,
and she goes without shoes and in the plainest of raiment, and she would
have appeared naked if she had not too much regard for her feminine
decency. Now figure yourself, Apollonius, as standing between Indian
wisdom on one side, and our humble wisdom on the other; imagine that you
hear the one telling you how she will strew flowers under you when you
lie down to sleep, yes, and by Heaven, how she will regale you upon milk
and nourish you on honey-comb, and how she will supply you with nectar
and wings, whenever you want them; and how she will wheel in tripods,
whenever you drink, and golden thrones; and you shall have no hard work
to do, but everything will be flung unsought into your lap. But the
other discipline insists that you must lie on the bare ground in
squalor, and be seen to toil naked like ourselves; and that you must not
find dear or sweet anything which you have not won by hard work; and
that you must not be boastful, not hunt after vanities and pursue pride;
and that you must be on your guard against all dreams and visions which
lift you off the earth. If then you really make the choice of Heracles,
and steel your will resolutely, neither to dishonor truth, nor to
decline the simplicity of nature, then you may say

<span id="page_2:36">p. 36</span> <span id="page_2:37">p. 37</span>

that you have overcome many lions and have cut off the heads of many
hydras and of monsters like Geryon and Nessus, and have accomplished all
his other labors, but if you embrace the life of a strolling juggler,
you will flatter men's eyes and ears, but they will think you no wiser
than anybody else, and you will become the vanquished of any naked
philosopher of Egypt."
