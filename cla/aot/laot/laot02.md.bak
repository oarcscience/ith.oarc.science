### INTRODUCTION

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Life of Apollonius of Tyana has only
been once translated in its entirety into English, as long ago as the
year 1811, by an Irish clergyman of the name of E. Berwick. It is to be
hoped therefore that the present translation will be acceptable to the
English reading public; for there is in it much that is very good
reading, and it is lightly written. Of its author, Philostratus, we do
not know much apart from his own works, from which we may gather that he
was born in the island of Lemnos about the year 172 of our era, that he
went to Athens as a young man to study rhetoric, and later on to Rome.
Here he acquired a reputation as a sophist, and was drawn into what we
may call the salon of the literary and philosophic Empress Julia Domna,
the wife of Septimius Severus. She put into his hands certain memoirs of
Apollonius, the sage of Tyana, who had died in extreme old age nearly

<span id="page_1:viii">p. "viii"</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 100 years before
during the reign of the Emperor Nerva, and she begged him to use them
for the composition of a literary life of the sage in question. These
memoirs had been composed by a disciple and companion of Apollonius
named Damis, a native of the city of Nineveh, whose style, Philostratus
says, like that of most Syrian Greeks, was heavy and wanting in polish.
Besides these memoirs Philostratus used for his work a history of the
career of Apollonius at Aegae, written by an admirer of the name of
Maximus. He also used the many letters of Apollonius which were in
circulation. His collection of these agreed partly, but not wholly, with
those which are preserved to us and translated below. He tells us
further that the Emperor Hadrian had a collection of these letters in
his villa at Antium. Philostratus also possessed various treatises of
Apollonius which have not come down to us. Beside making use of the
written sources here enumerated Philostratus had travelled about, not
only to Tyana, where there was a temple specially dedicated to the cult
of Apollonius, but to other cities where the sage's memory was held in
honour, in order to collect such traditions of the sage as he found
still current. From these sources then the work before us was drawn, for
although Philostratus

<span id="page_1:ix">p. "ix"</span>

also knew the four books of a certain Moeragenes upon Apollonius, he
tells us he paid no attention to them, because they displayed an
ignorance of many things which concerned the sage. The learned Empress
seems never to have lived to read the work of Philostratus, for it is
not dedicated to her and cannot have been published before the year 217.

It has been argued that the work of Damis never really existed, and that
he was a mere man of straw invented by Philostratus. This view was
adopted as recently as the year 1910 by Professor Bigg, in his history
of the origins of Christianity. But it seems unnecessarily sceptical. It
is quite true that Philostratus puts into the mouth of the sage, on the
authority of Damis, conversations and ideas which, as they recur in the
Lives of the Sophists of Philostratus, can hardly have been reported by
Damis. But because he resorted to this literary trick, it by no means
follows that all the episodes which he reports on the authority of Damis
are fictitious, for many of them possess great verisimilitude and can
hardly have been invented as late as the year 217, when the life was
completed and given to the literary world. It is rather to be supposed
that Damis himself was not altogether a credible writer, but one who,
like the so-called

<span id="page_1:x">p. "x"</span>

*aretalogi* of that age, set himself to embellish the life of his
master, to exaggerate his wisdom and his supernatural powers; if so,
more than one of the striking stories told by Philostratus may have
already stood in the pages of Damis.

However this be, the evident aim of Philostratus is to rehabilitate the
reputation of Apollonius, and defend him from the charge of having been
a charlatan or wizard addicted to evil magical practices. This
accusation had been levelled against the sage during his life-time by a
rival sophist Euphrates, and not long after his death by the author
already mentioned, Moeragenes. Unfortunately the orations of Euphrates
have perished, and we know little of the work of Moeragenes. Origen, the
Christian father, in his work against Celsus, written about the year
240, informs us that he had read it, and that it attacked Apollonius as
a magician addicted to sinister practices. It is certain also that the
accusations of Euphrates were of similar tendency, and we only need to
read a very few pages of this work of Philostratus to see that his chief
interest is to prove to the world that these accusations were
ill-founded, and that Apollonius was a divinely-inspired sage and
prophet, and a reformer along Pythagorean lines of the Pagan

<span id="page_1:xi">p. "xi"</span>

religion. It is possible that some of the stories told by Byzantine
writers of Apollonius, notably by John Tzetzes, derive from Moeragenes.

The story of the life of Apollonius as narrated by Philostratus is
briefly as follows. He was born towards the beginning of the Christian
era at Tyana, in Cappadocia, and his birth was attended according to
popular tradition with miracles and portents. At the age of sixteen he
set himself to observe in the most rigid fashion the almost monastic
rule ascribed to Pythagoras, renouncing wine, rejecting the married
estate, refusing to eat any sort of flesh, and in particular condemning
the sacrifice of animals to the gods, which in the ancient world
furnished the occasion, at any rate for the poor people, of eating meat.
For we must not forget that in antiquity hardly any meat was eaten which
had not previously been consecrated by sacrifice to a god, and that
consequently the priest was the butcher of a village and the butcher the
priest. Like other votaries of the Neo-Pythagorean philosophy or
discipline, Apollonius went without shoes or only wore shoes of bark, he
allowed his hair to grow long, and never let a razor touch his chin, and
he took care to wear on his person nothing but linen, for it was
accounted by him, as by Brahmans, an impurity to allow any

<span id="page_1:xii">p. "xii"</span>

dress made of the skin of dead animals to touch the person. Before long
he set himself up as a reformer, and betaking himself to the town of
Aegae, he took up his abode in the temple of Aesculapius, where he
rapidly acquired such a reputation for sanctity that sick people flocked
to him asking him to heal them. On attaining his majority, at the death
of his father and mother, he gave up the greater part of his patrimony
to his elder brother, and what was left to his poor relations. He then
set himself to spend five years in complete silence, traversing, it
would seem, Asia Minor, in all directions, but never opening his lips.
The more than Trappist vow of silence which he thus enforced upon
himself seems to have further enhanced his reputation for holiness, and
his mere appearance on the scene was enough to hush the noise of warring
factions in the cities of Cilicia and Pamphylia. If we may believe his
biographer he professed to know all languages without ever having
learned them, to know the inmost thoughts of men, to understand the
language of birds and animals, and to have the power of predicting the
future. He also remembered his former incarnation, for he shared the
Pythagorean belief of the migrations of human souls from body to body,
both of animals and of human beings. He preached

<span id="page_1:xiii">p. "xiii"</span>

a rigid asceticism, and condemned all dancing and other diversions of
the kind; he would carry no money on his person and recommended others
to spend their money in the relief of the poorer classes. He visited
Persia and India, where he consorted with the Brahmans; he subsequently
visited Egypt, and went up the Nile in order to acquaint himself with
those precursors of the monks of the Thebaid called in those days the
Gymnosophists or naked philosophers. He visited the cataracts of the
Nile, and returning to Alexandria held long conversations with Vespasian
and Titus soon after the siege and capture of Jerusalem by the latter.
He had a few years before, in the course of a visit to Rome, incurred
the wrath of Nero, whose minister Tigellinus however was so intimidated
by him as to set him at liberty. After the death of Titus he was again
arrested, this time by the Emperor Domitian, as a fomenter of sedition,
but was apparently acquitted. He died at an advanced age in the reign of
Nerva, who befriended him; and according to popular tradition he
ascended bodily to heaven, appearing after death to certain persons who
entertained doubts about a future life.

Towards the end of the third century when the struggle between
Christianity and decadent Paganism

<span id="page_1:xiv">p. "xiv"</span>

had reached its last and bitterest stage, it occurred to some of the
enemies of the new religion to set up Apollonius, to whom temples and
shrines had been erected in various parts of Asia Minor, as a rival to
the founder of Christianity. The many miracles which were recorded of
Apollonius, and in particular his eminent power over evil spirits or
demons, made him a formidable rival in the minds of Pagans to Jesus
Christ. And a certain Hierocles, who was a provincial governor under the
Emperor Diocletian, wrote a book to show that Apollonius had been as
great a sage, as remarkable a worker of miracles, and as potent an
exorcist as Jesus Christ. His work gave great offence to the
missionaries of the Christian religion, and Eusebius the Christian
historian wrote a treatise in answer, in which he alleges that
Apollonius was a mere charlatan, and if a magician at all, then one of
very inferior powers; he also argues that if he did achieve any
remarkable results, it was thanks to the evil spirits with whom he was
in league. Eusebius is careful, however, to point out that before
Hierocles, no anti-Christian writer had thought of putting forward
Apollonius as the rival and equal of Jesus of Nazareth. It is possible
of course that Hierocles took his cue from the Emperor Alexander Severus
(A.D. 205-235), who instead of setting up

<span id="page_1:xv">p. "xv"</span>

images of the gods in his private shrine, established therein, as
objects of his veneration, statues of Alexander the Great, Orpheus,
Apollonius of Tyana, Abraham, and Christ. This story however in no way
contradicts the statement of Eusebius, and it is a pity that this
significant caution of the latter has been disregarded by Christian
writers of the last three centuries, who have almost unanimously adopted
a view that is utterly unwarrantable, namely, that Philostratus intended
his life of Apollonius as a counterblast to that of the Christian
gospel. The best scholars of the present generation are opposed to this
view, for they realise that demoniac possession was a common feature in
the ancient landscape, and that the exorcist driving demons out of
afflicted human beings by use of threats and invocations of mysterious
names was as familiar a figure in old Pagan society as he was in the
early church.

We read that wherever Apollonius travelled, he visited the temples, and
undertook to reform the cults which he there found in vogue. His reform
seems to have consisted in this, that he denounced as derogatory to the
gods the practice of sacrificing to them animal victims and tried to
persuade the priests to abandon it. In this respect he prepared the
ground for Christianity and was working along

<span id="page_1:xvi">p. "xvi"</span>

the same lines as many of the Christian missionaries. In the third
century Porphyry the philosopher and enemy of Christianity was as
zealous in his condemnation of blood-offerings, as Apollonius had been
in the first. Unquestionably the neo-Pythagorean propaganda did much to
discredit ancient paganism, and Apollonius and its other missionaries
were all unwittingly working for that ideal of bloodless sacrifice
which, after the destruction of the Jewish Temple, by an inexorable
logic imposed itself on the Christian Church.

It is well to conclude this all too brief notice of Apollonius with a
passage cited by Eusebius <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) from his
lost work concerning sacrifice. There is no good reason for doubting its
authenticity, and it is an apt summary of his religious belief:—

"In no other manner, I believe, can one exhibit a fitting respect for
the divine being, beyond any other men make sure of being singled out as
an object of his favour and good-will, than by refusing to offer to God
whom we termed First, who is One and separate from all, as subordinate
to whom we must recognise all the rest, any victim at ail; to Him we
must not kindle fire or make promise unto him of any sensible

<span id="page_1:vii">p. "vii"</span>

object whatsoever. For He needs nothing even from beings higher than
ourselves. Nor is there any plant or animal which earth sends up or
nourishes, to which some pollution is not incident. We should make use
in relation to him solely of the higher speech, I mean of that which
issues not by the lips; and from the noblest of beings we must ask for
blessings by the noblest faculty we possess, and that faculty is
intelligence, which needs no organ. On these principles then we ought
not on any account to sacrifice victims to the mighty and supreme God."

The text followed by the translator is that of C. L. Kayser, issued by
B. G. Teubner, at Leipzic in 1870.
