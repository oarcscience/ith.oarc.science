### CHAPTER XLI

SO they remained the next day as well, for Indian would not let them go,
and he gave them a letter for Iarchas, written in the following terms:—

<span id="page_1:226">p. 226</span> <span id="page_1:227">p. 227</span>

"King Phroates to Iarchas his master and to his companions, all hail!

Apollonius, wisest of men, yet accounts you still wiser than himself,
and is come to learn your lore. Send him away therefore when he knows
all that you know yourselves, assured that nothing of your teachings
will perish, for in discourse and memory he excels all men. And let him
also see the throne, on which I sat, when you, Father Iarchas, bestowed
on me the kingdom. And his followers too deserve commendation for their
devotion to such a master. Farewell to yourself and your companions."

### CHAPTER XLII

AND they rode out of Taxila, and after a journey of two days reached the
plain, in which Porus is said to have engaged Alexander: and they say
they saw gates therein that enclosed nothing, but had been erected to
carry trophies. For there was set up on them a statue of Alexander
standing in a four-poled chariot, <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) as
he looked when at Issus he confronted the satraps of Darius. And at a
short distance from one another there are said to have been built two
gates, carrying the one a statue of Porus, and the other one of
Alexander, of both, as I imagine, reconciled to one another after the
battle; for the one is in the attitude of one man greeting another, and
the other of one doing homage.

### CHAPTER XLIII

AND having crossed the river Hydraotes and passed by several tribes,
they reached the Hyphasis, and thirty stades away from this they came on
altars bearing this inscription: "To Father Ammon and Heracles his
brother, and to Athena Providence and to Zeus of Olympus and to the
Cabeiri of Samothrace and to the Indian Sun and to the Delphian Apollo."

And they say there was also a brass column dedicated, and inscribed as
follows:

"Alexander stayed his steps at this point." The altars we may suppose to
be due to Alexander who so honored the limit of his Empire; but I fancy
the Indians beyond the Hyphasis erected the column, by way of expressing
their pride at Alexander's having gone no further.
