Index of First Lines

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have such papers that grim Cato's wife  
May read, and strictest Sabines in their life.  
I will this book should laugh throughout and jest,  
And be more wicked than are all the rest,  
And sweat with wine, and with rich unguents flow,  
And sport with boys, and with the wenches too;  
Nor by periphrasis describe that thing  
That common parent whence we all do spring;  
Which sacred Numa once a prick did call.  
Yet still suppose these verses Saturnal.  
(O my Apollinaris) this my book  
Has no dissembled manners, no feign'd look.

--FLETCHER'S

Martial
