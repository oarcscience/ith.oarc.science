# Depilation by Catamites

Martial derides catamites for depilating their privy parts and buttocks.
The following version of Martial's epigram against a beau (*bellus
homo*) is given by Dr James Cranstoun in the illustrative notes to his
translation of Catullus:

Cotilus, you are a beau; yes, Cotilus, many declare it.  
  Such is the story I hear: tell me, then, what is a beau?  
Why, sir, a beau is a man who arranges his tresses in order:  
  Smelling for ever of balm, smelling of cinnamon spice:  
Singing the songs of the Nile or a-humming the ditties of Cadiz:  
  Never at rest with his arms, moving them this way or that:  
Lounging on sofas from morning to night with a bevy of ladies:  
  Aye in the ears of some girl whispering some silly tale:  
Reading a letter from Rhode or Chloe, or writing to Phyllis:  
  Shunning the sleeve of his friend lest he should ruffle his dress:  
Everyone's sweetheart he'll tell you, he swaggers the lion at parties:  
  Bets on the favourite horse, tells you his sire and his dam.  
Cotilus, what are you telling me?--this thing! is this thing a beau?  
  Cotilus, then I must say he's a contemptible thing.

Juvenal devotes his finest Satire (the second) to a forcible
denunciation of the infamous practices of these sodomites. In it he
says:

One man with a needle slanted, lengthens his eyebrows, touched with
moistened soot, and, lifting up his eyelids, paints his quivering eyes.
Another drinks from a Priapus-shaped glass, and confines his flowing
locks in a golden net, clothing himself in cerulean checks or
greenish-yellow vestments, whilst his valet swears by the Juno of his
master. A third holds a mirror, the accoutrement of pathic Otho, 'the
spoil of Auruncan Actor', in which he viewed himself, armed for battle,
when he commanded the standards to be raised.

Tertullian speaks of ustricles (from *urere*--to bum), female delipators
who made use of boiling dropax to bum the hairs on the legs and other
parts of the body of these voluptuaries. Other references to these
effeminate practices--particularly that of depilating the body-pile with
dropax or psilothrum (melted rosin in oil) or with tweezers--are made by
Persius, Ausonius, Juvenal, Martial, Suetonius, Quintilian, Julius
Capitolinus, Pliny, Aeitus, &c., &c.
