### Priapus

Credere quis possit? falcem quoque - turpe fateri -  
   de digitis fures surripuere meis.  
nec movet amissi tam me iactura pudorque,  
   quam praebent iustos altera tela metus:  
quae si perdidero, patria mutabor, et olim  
   ille tuus civis, Lampsace, Gallus ero.

Who could believe my words? 'Tis shame to confess that the sickle  
Yon thief-folk have availed e'en from my fingers to thieve.  
Nor doth its loss so much affect my mind or dishonour  
As the just, natural dread other my weapons to lose,  
Which lost shall I stand mulcted of country, and he that was erewhile  
Son of the city to thee, Lampsacus! Gaul shall become.

Who could believe ('tis a shameful confession!) that the thieves have
even purloined the sickle from my very fingers? nor do the disgrace and
loss so much affect me as the well-grounded fears of losing other
weapons. Which if I lose, I shall be expatriated; and he formerly thy
citizen, O Lampsacus, will become a Gaul.\[1\]

\[1. The word *Gallus* means one born in Gaul, and also an emasculated
priest of Cybele. Therefore, were the thieves to steal Priapus's
phallus, which was often used as a cudgel against garden robbers, he
would become a *Gallus*. Martial relates that a Tuscan soothsayer whilst
sacrificing a goat to Bacchus ordered a rustic who was assisting him to
castrate the animal. The haruspex, busily intent on cutting the goat's
throat, exposed to his assistant's view an immense hernia of his own,
which the countryman seized and cut off by mistake, thus converting the
Tuscan into a Gaul (Gallus). The priests of Cybele (who were all
castrated) were called *Galli* from Gallus, a river in Phrygia, which
turned to madness those who drank of its waters.\]
