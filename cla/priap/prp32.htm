<P>Uvis aridior puella passis,<BR>
buxo pallidior novaque cera,<BR>
collatas sibi quae suisque membris<BR>
formicas facit altiles videri,<BR>
cuius viscera non aperta Tuscus<BR>
per pellem poterit videre haruspex,<BR>
quae suco caret ut putrisque pumex,<BR>
nemo viderit hanc ut exspuentem,<BR>
quam pro sanguine pulverem scobemque<BR>
in venis medici putant habere,<BR>
ad me nocte solet venire et affert<BR>
pallorem maciemque larualem.<BR>
ductor ferreus insularis aeque et<BR>
lanternae videor fricare cornu.</P>
<P>A damsel drier than the raisin'd grape,<BR>
Warmer than boxwood or than virgin wax,<BR>
Who pismires clustering on her every limb<BR>
Maketh a bulky-corpulent folk appear;<BR>
One whose unopened bowels through her skin<BR>
The Tuscan wizard can at will prospect;<BR>
One who like rotten pounce so lacking juice<BR>
None ever saw her with a slavering lip;<BR>
One whom for blood her arteries within<BR>
To have sand or sawdust differing leeches deem--<BR>
Such one to visit me anights is wont<BR>
Bringing with ghostly leanness ghastly hue;<BR>
Whist I (like island iron-forger) seem<BR>
To rub and rasp me on a lanthorn's horn</P>
<P>Girl, more meagre than dried grapes,[1] more dusky-white than boxwood or unsullied wax; who makes the ants congregated on her body and members seem corpulent; whose bowels the Etruscan soothsayer could without opening see through the skin; who, like pumice, has no sap, insomuch as no one has seen her sputter; who, physicians think, has sand for blood, and in her veins sawdust--[this girl] is wont to come to me in the night, and approaches me, wan, attenuate and ghostlike, whilst I, as an insular iron-worker scrapes,[2] seem to be rubbing in the horn of a lantern.[3]</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This is reminiscent of an epigram by Catullus against Furius, in which he describes him as having a body more dried than horn by extreme poverty; adding, 'Sweat, saliva, mucus and nasal snivelling, all these are absent from thee. Add to this cleanliness the still greater cleanliness that thy buttocks are purer than a salt-cellar. Thou does not cack ten times in the whole of the year, and then it is harder than a bean or than pebbles, so that if thou rubbest and crumblest it in thy hands thou canst never dirty a finger.'</P>
<P>2. Islands abound in metals, hence convicts in ancient times were transported to work on them.</P>
<P>3. Here used in a jocular comparison of the girl's parts with the horn of a lantern for hardness and dryness in coition.]</P>
