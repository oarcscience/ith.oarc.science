<P>Cornix et caries vetusque bustum,<BR>
turba putida facta saeculorum,<BR>
quae forsan potuisset esse nutrix<BR>
Tithoni Priamique Nestorisque,<BR>
illis ni pueris anus fuisset,<BR>
ne desit sibi, me rogat, fututor.<BR>
quid si nunc roget, ut puella fiat?<BR>
si nummos tamen haec habet, puella est.</P>
<P>A chough, a caries, an eld-worn grave,<BR>
By lapse of crowding centuries rotten grown,<BR>
Who as a wetnurse haply may have fed<BR>
Tithonus, Priam, Nestor, and perchance<BR>
When they were little lads was ag&egrave;d crone,<BR>
Sues me for swiver she may never lack!<BR>
How if she pray me to be girl again?<BR>
Yet, if she's moneyed, she's again a girl.</P>
<P>An old crow, a thing of decay, a very sepulchre, grown rotten through the lapse of generations, who perchance might have been the wet-nurse of Tithonus, of Priam, and of Nestor, or who was an old woman maybe when they were boys, beseeches me that a futterer may not be wanting to her. How if she were now to pray that she may become a girl again? Nevertheless if she hath- money, she is a girl.[1]</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Suggesting she may obtain a lover if she will pay for him. Martial writes,<BR>
'Lesbia swears that she has never been futtered gratis. It is true: for when she<BR>
wants to futter, she is wont to pay.' And,</P>
<P>Wouldst thou be wimbled <I>gratis</I> when thou art<BR>
A wrinkled wretch deformed in every part?<BR>
O 'tis a thing more than ridiculous:<BR>
To take a man's full sum, and not pay Use!]</P>
