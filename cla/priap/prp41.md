### Priapus

Quisquis venerit huc, poeta fiat  
et versus mihi dedicet iocosos.  
qui non fecerit, inter eruditos  
ficosissimus ambulet poetas.

Whoso comes hither shall a bard become  
And to me dedicate facetious verse;  
But who thiswise doth not, 'mid learnèd poets  
Shall pace with fundament fulfilled of 'figs'.

Whoever comes hither let him become a poet and dedicate to me jocose
verses. He who does not, shall, teeming with piles,\[1\] walk amongst
learned poets.

\[1. Piles were a frequent result of sodomy. The word *ficus* means
primarily a fig, and piles were so called from their resemblance in
shape to that fruit.\]
