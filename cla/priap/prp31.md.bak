# 31

### Priapus

Donec proterva nil mei manu carpes,  
licebit ipsa sis pudicior Vesta.  
sin, haec mei te ventris arma laxabunt,  
exire ut ipse de tuo queas culo.

Long as thy wanton hand to pluck refrain  
Chaster than Vesta's self thou may'st remain  
Else thee my belly's arm shall loosen so  
Out of thy proper anus thou shalt flow.

So long as thou snatchest nothing from me with audacious hand, thou
mayst be chaster than Vesta herself. But, if thou dost, these
belly-weapons of mine will so stretch thee that thou wilt be able to
slip through thy own anus.

\[1. If on his way to drink at the fountain, the wayfarer plucked the
grapes in the orchard guarded by the god, Priapus threatened him with
irrumation. He would then require water, not only to quench his thirst,
but also to cleanse his mouth. 'Because you suck, and gargle your mouth
with water, Lesbia, you do no wrong. You take water where there is need
of it, Lesbia.' Following the example of other women, who after coition
bathe their privy parts, Lesbia rinses her mouth. The poet calls her
Lesbia because the Lesbians were given to this fantasy.\]
