### Priapus

Porro - nam quis erit modus? - Quirites,  
aut praecidite seminale membrum,  
quod totis mihi noctibus fatigant  
vicinae sine fine prurientes  
vernis passeribus salaciores,  
aut rumpar, nec habebitis Priapum.  
ipsi cernitis, effututus ut sim  
confectusque macerque pallidusque,  
qui quondam ruber et valens solebam  
fures caedere quamlibet valentes.  
defecit latus et periculosam  
cum tussi miser exspuo salivam.

Hither, Quirites! (here what limit is?)  
Either my member seminal lop ye off  
Which thro' the livelong nights for aye fatigue  
The neighbour-women rutting endlessly,  
Lewder than sparrows in the lusty spring;  
Or I shall burst and ye Priapus lose.  
How I be futtered-out yourselves espy  
Used-up, bejaded, lean and pallid grown,  
Who erstwhile ruddy, in my doughtiness wont  
To kill with poking thieves however doughty.  
My side has failed me and poor I with cough  
The perilous spittle ever must outspew.

Hither! ye Romans' Either lop off my seminal member, which the
neighbouring women, ever itching with desire, exhaust the whole night
through\[1\]--more lecherous than sparrows in the spring\[2\]--or I
shall be ruptured (for where is the limit of their lust?), nor will ye
have a Priapus. Ye see that I am spent with venery, jaded, thin and
pale, who once, ruddy and vigorous, used to thrust through the stoutest
thieves. My strength has faded me; and, wretched with coughing, I spit
out noxious saliva.\[3\]

\[1. Either the women exhausted Priapus with their mouths or by riding
upon him.

2\. Scioppius recounts having seen sparrows in spring copulate so many
times in succession that, when trying to fly away, they fell to the
ground exhausted.

3\. In connection with this epigram may be mentioned the practice of
tribadism with phalli amongst the Roman ladies. Giraldus tells us that
the Lesbian women used dildoes made of glass, ivory, gold and silken
stuffs and linen to satisfy their lechery. Suidas and Aristophanes speak
of the use by Milesian women of a leathern penis succedaneum, called
*olisbos*. Martial and Suetonius hint at the use of a snake for a
similar purpose. Petronius makes Oenothea introduce a leathern
*fascinum*, smeared with oil, pepper and crushed nettle seeds, into the
anus of Encolpius as an aphrodisiac.\]
