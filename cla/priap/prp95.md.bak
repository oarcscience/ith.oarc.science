### Priapus

### by Quintus Horatius Flaccus

Olim truncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum,  
cum faber, incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum,  
maluit esse deum. deus inde ego, furum aviumque  
maxima formido; nam fures dextra coercet  
obscaenoque ruber porrectus ab inguine palus;  
ast importunas volucres in vertice harundo  
terret fixa vetatque novis considere in hortis.  
Huc prius angustis eiecta cadavera cellis  
conservus vili portanda locabat in arca;  
hoc miserae plebi stabat commune sepulcrum,  
Pantolabo scurrae Nomentanoque nepoti:  
mille pedes in fronte, trecentos cippus in agrum  
hic dabat, heredes monumentum ne sequeretur.  
Nunc licet Esquiliis habitare salubribus atque  
aggere in aprico spatiari, quo modo tristes  
albis informem spectabant ossibus agrum;  
cum mihi non tantum furesque feraeque, suetae  
hunc vexare locum, curae sunt atque labori,  
quantum carminibus quae versant atque venenis  
humanos animos. Has nullo perdere possum  
nec prohibere modo, simul ac vaga luna decorum  
protulit os, quin ossa legant herbasque nocentis.  
Vidi egomet nigra succinctam vadere palla  
Canidiam pedibus nudis passoque capillo,  
cum Sagana maiore ululantem. Pallor utrasque  
fecerat horrendas aspectu. Scalpere terram  
unguibus et pullam divellere mordicus agnam  
coeperunt; cruor in fossam confusus, ut inde  
manis elicerent animas responsa daturas.  
Lanea et effigies erat altera cerea; maior  
lanea, quae poenis compesceret inferiorem;  
cerea suppliciter stabat servilibus, ut quae  
iam peritura modis. Hecaten vocat altera, saevam  
altera Tisiphonen; serpentes atque videres  
infernas errare canes, Lunamque rubentem,  
ne foret his testis, post magna latere sepulcra.  
Mentior at si quid, merdis caput inquiner albis  
corvorum, atque in me veniat mictum atque cacatum  
Iulius et fragilis Pediatia furque Voranus.  
Singula quid memorem,? quo pacto alterna loquentes  
umbrae cum Sagana resonarint triste et acutum,  
utque lupi barbam variae cum dente colubrae  
abdiderint furtim terris, et imagine cerea  
largior arserit ignis, et ut non testis inultus  
horruerim voces Furiarum et facta duarum:  
nam, displosa sonat quantum vesica, pepidi  
diffissa nate ficus: at illae currere in urbem;  
Canidiae dentis, altum Saganae caliendrum  
excidere atque herbas atque incantata lacertis  
vincula cum magno risuque iocoque videres.

First a wild-fig-tree trunk was I, not useful as timber,  
When the mechanic in doubt anent making me stool or Priapus  
Chose me for being a god; so a god to the thieves and the birdies  
Direst of dreads I became, my right the robbers restraining,  
Eke with a ruddy pole from parts obscenely projected,  
While th' importunate fowls affrights a reed on my head-poll  
Planted, and hinders their flock from 'lighting in newly made gardens.  
Erst to be hither borne from narrow cellules ejected  
Corpses by fellow-slaves were coffined in biers of the vilest.  
This was the common yard to ensepulchre wretched plebeians,  
Pantolabus the buffoon and Nomentanus the rake-hell.  
Frontage a thousand feet, three hundred fieldwards, a land mark  
Here assigned, lest the ground monumental follow the heir folk.  
Now 'tis salubrious made: one fives in th' Esquiliae, also  
Walks on the sunny mound, where erstwhile showed to folk sad-eyed  
Fields by bones deformed a-glistening ghostly and ghastly;  
Yet for me never was aught, or thieves or ferals accustomed  
This foul spot to behaunt, a cause of such care and such trouble  
As are the hags who by spells and poisons upset and envenom  
Spirits and minds of mankind; these nowise bring to perdition  
Nor even hinder can I; no sooner doth wandering Luna  
Show her full face than bones and ill herbs they hasten to gather.  
I with these eyes espied in sables kilted a-pacing  
Canidia, nude-foot, long hair bestrewing her shoulders,  
Howling with Sagana th' elder (and paleness had rendered the couple  
Horrid of mien); anon both the ground with their talons  
Clawing, and black-fleeced lamb with teeth a-tearing to tatters  
Either began; its gore in a ditch was spillèd, so thereby  
Ghosts might be raised from graves and answers give to their queries.  
Images too there were, this of wool, that of wax, and the greater  
Woollen that seemed with pains about to punish the lesser  
Suppliant standing in wax as one foredoomèd to perish  
After a servile way. One calls on Hecate, th' other  
Summons fell Tisiphone; then mightest thou look upon serpents  
Wriggling with Hell-sluts around, whilst Luna ruddily blushing  
Hid her behind the tall tombs lest she these doings might witness.  
Now if I false in aught be, my head bewrayed with white mutings  
Dropt by the crows and hither repair to bepiss and conskite me  
Julius, frail Pediatia and eke Voranus the robber.  
Why should I mention all and each? how chattered alternate  
With Sagana these ghosts, now sad-toned then in sharp treble.  
How too the head of a wolf with fangs of variegate adder  
Furtive they buried in earth, whereat for the waxen imago  
Fiercelier flamed the fire and how (no unavenged witness!)  
I was o'erwhelmed by the words and the deeds of these Furies
well-coupled;  
For that like bladder that bursts with a loud explosion I farted  
From my cleft buttocks of fig. Hereat they ran to the city,  
Canidia's false teeth with Sagana's towering hair-tour  
Falling aground and herbs and magical armlets on forearms  
Showed to beholder's sight with many a joke and much laughter.

Aforetimes I was the trunk of a wild fig tree, useless wood,\[1\] when
the craftsman, uncertain whether to make a bench or a Priapus, preferred
me to be the god. A god henceforth became I, to the thieves and birds
the greatest of bugbears; for my right hand checks pilferers, and a
ruddy pole thrust forth from obscene groin; while a cane to my pate
affixed alarms the pestering birds, and prevents them from flocking down
upon these recently made gardens.\[2\] Hither, of yore, corpses from
strait cells expelled, by brother-slaves were conveyed for disposal in
mean biers. This for the miserable mob stood a common sepulchre, for
Pantolabus the droll and Nomentanus the spendthrift. A thousand feet of
frontage, three hundred backwards in field a boundary stone here gave,
lest the memorial ground descend to the heirs. Now one may inhabit the
Esquiliae made salubrious, and promenade on the terrace 'neath the sun,
where but lately the saddened observed the ground distorted by white
bones; as for me, nor thieves nor wild beasts wont this place to infest
cause so much of trouble and labour as do those females who with magical
songs and with venoms do overturn the minds of folk. These in no wise to
make away with am I able nor to prevent, soon as the fleeting moon her
beauteous visage shows forth, from gathering together dry bones and
noisome herbs. With mine own eyes did I see with black garment upgirdled
Canidia, walking barefoot and dishevelled of hair, with Sagana the elder
a-screeching (and pallor had made both of horrible aspect) begin to claw
up the ground with their

\[1. The wood of a fig tree was very little used, on account of its
brittleness.

2\. Octavius, willing to correct the infection of this hill, which was a
common burying-place for all the poor of Rome, got the consent of the

magnificent house there, with very extensive gardens.\]

nails, and a black ewe-lamb with their teeth to drag piecemeal; the
blood in a ditch was poured that thence shades of the dead\[1\] might be
raised, spirits to give them responses. And a woollen\[2\] effigy there
was and another one waxen; the greater one wool which with punishments
held in check the inferior. The waxen figure submissively stood as in
servile mode now about to perish. On Hecate called this hag, on savage
Tisiphone the other; and serpents might you behold roving with
hell-begot bitches, and Luna, a-blushing lest her presence might witness
these doings, behind the tall tomb stones did hide. But if I lie in
aught, with white mutings of ravens may my head be befouled and on me to
piss and to cack may come Julius and fragile Pediatia and Voranus the
thief. Why should I set forth each thing? in what manner with alternate
utterance these spectres with Sagana gave forth sounds both doleful and
shrieking? And how the beard of a wolf with fangs of a speckled
she-serpent they hid by stealth in the loam; and for the image of wax
more greatly the flames burst up; and how, a witness not without
strength to avenge, I was whelmed by the cries and the acts of the
Furies twain? For, with sound like bursten bladder I farted, from cleft
buttocks of fig-tree wood.\[3\] Whereat they scurried off to the city;
Canidia's false teeth and Sagana's lofty head dress a-tumbling to the
ground and the herbs and the bewitched bracelets on their arms with
great laughter and joke might you see.

\[1. Black victims alone were sacrificed to the infernal gods, nor was
anything supposed more delicious to the souls of the departed than
blood. They could not foretell any future events, or answer any
questions, until they had drunk it. Ulysses was obliged to draw his
sword, to frighten them away from the blood he had poured into the
trench for Tiresias.

2\. The image of wool represented the person they were willing should
survive the other represented by that of wax. The images were made of
different materials, that their fates might be different.

3\. The heat made the wood crack with a noise which put the witches to
flight.\]
