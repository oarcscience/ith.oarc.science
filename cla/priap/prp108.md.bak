# Masturbation

'Veneri servit amica manus'--'Thy hand serves as the mistress of thy
pleasure,' writes Martial (See Epigram 33, page 59). Elsewhere he speaks
of the Phrygian slaves masturbating\[1\] themselves to overcome the
amorous feelings which the sight of their master having connection with
his wife provoked in them. Martial has many allusions\[2\] to the
subject, which is treated at some length by Forberg and Mirabeau, the
latter of whom tells us that Mercury taught the art to his son Pan, who
was distracted by the loss of his mistress, Echo, and that Pan
afterwards instructed the shepherds. Further on, Mirabeau mentions a
curious practice which he declares to be prevalent amongst the Grecian
women of modern times: that of using their feet to provoke the orgasm of
their lovers.

Pacificus Maximus says, 'Is there no boy nor girl to hear my prayers? No
one comes? then my right hand must perform the accustomed office.'
Juvenal deplores the habit amongst schoolboys of mutually

\[1. The word is generally derived from *manu stuprare*--to defile with
the hand.

2\. 'Cause thou dost kiss thy boy's soft lips with thy  
Rough chin, and with strip'd Ganymede dost he,  
Who does deny thee this? 'tis well. At least  
Frig not thyself with thy lascivious fist,  
This in light toys more than the prick offends,  
Their fingers hasten and the man up sends,  
Hence Goatish rankness, sudden hairs, a beard  
Springs forth to wond'ring mothers much admired.  
Nor do they please by day when in the bath  
They wash their skins. Nature divided hath  
The males: half to the girls born to be shown  
The other half to men: use then thy own.

--Fletcher's *Martial*\]

rendering this service to one another. Aristophanes, in the Wasps,
touches on the subject, and one of the most charming of the shorter
poems of Catullus contains an allusion--

Caeli, Lesbia nostra, Lesbia illa,  
Illa Lesbia, quam Catullus unam  
Plus quam se atque amavit omnes,  
Nunc in quadriviis et angiportis  
Glubit magnanimos Remi nepotes

O Caelius, our Lesbia, Lesbia, that Lesbia whom Catullus more than
himself and all his kin did love, now in the public streets and in
alleys husks off the magnanimous descendants of Remus.

Glubit may possibly be read as referring to irrumation, the word
'husking' being appropriate in describing either action. Plutarch says
that Chrysippus praised Diogenes for masturbating himself in the middle
of the marketplace, and for saying to the bystanders: 'Would to Heaven
that by rubbing my stomach in the same fashion, I could satisfy my
hunger.'
