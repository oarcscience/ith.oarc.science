# 23

### Priapus

Hic me custodem fecundi vilicus horti  
   mandati curam iussit habere loci.  
fur habeas poenam, licet indignere 'feram'que  
   'propter holus' dicas 'hoc ego?' 'propter holus'.

Here has the bailiff, now of this plentiful garden the guardian,  
Bidden me care for the place he to my service entrusts.  
Thief! thou shalt suffer the pain albeit crying in anger--  
'What! for a cabbage all this? This for a cabbage I bear?'

The steward has bidden me, the protector of this fertile garden, have a
care of the place committed to my charge. Thou, O thief, shalt be
punished; thou mayst be enraged, and say, 'On account of a cabbage am I
to endure this? On account of a cabbage?'\[1\]

\[1. Some read *prope*, meaning near--'Am I to be sodomised near a
cabbage?' instead of *propter*, meaning on account of. Because, it is
presumed, the thief thought a cabbage plot too open a space for such a
punishment.\]
