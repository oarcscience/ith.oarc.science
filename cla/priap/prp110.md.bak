# Braccae

The *braccae* (translated as 'hose' in Epigram 46, page 70) were a kind
of loose trousers, covering little save the pudenda, in use amongst the
Medes, Indians and Scythians. The following passage from Smollett's
curious satirical novel, *The Adventures of an Atom*, deserves quotation
*in extenso*, although somewhat lengthy--

Here I intended to insert a dissertation on trousers or trunk breeches,
called by the Greeks, *brakoi*, et *perísdomata*; by the Latins,
*braccae laxae*; by the Spaniards, *bragas anchas*; by the Italians,
*calzone largo*; by the French, *haut de chausses*; by the Saxons,
*braecce*; by the Swedes, *brackor*, by the Irish, *briechan*; by the
Celtae, *brag*, and by the Japanese, *bra-ak*. I could make some curious
discoveries touching the analogy between the *perísdomata* and *zonion
gunaikîon*, and point out the precise time at which the Grecian women
began to wear the breeches. I would have demonstrated that the *cingulum
muliebre* was originally no other than the wife's literally wearing the
husband's trousers at certain *orgia*, as a mark of dominion
transferred, *pro tempore*, to the female. I would have drawn a curious
parallel between the *zonion* of the Greek, and the *shim* or middle
cloth worn by the black ladies in Guinea. I would have proved that
breeches were not first used to defend the central parts from the
injuries of the weather, inasmuch as they were first worn by the
Orientals in a warm climate; as you may see in Persius, *Braccatis
illita medis--porticus*. I would have shown that breeches were first
brought from Asia to the northern parts of Europe by the Celtae, sprung
from the ancient Gomanaus; that trousers were worn in Scotland long
before the time of Pythagoras; and indeed we are told by Jamblychus that
Abaris, the famous Highland philosopher, contemporary and personally
acquainted with the sage of Crotona, wore long trousers. I myself can
attest the truth of that description, as I well remember the person and
habit of that learned mountaineer. I would have explained the reasons
that compelled the posterity of these mountaineers to abandon the
breeches of their forefathers, and expose their posteriors to the wind.
I would have convinced the English antiquaries that the inhabitants of
Yorkshire came originally from the Highlands of Scotland, before the
Scots had laid aside their breeches, and wore this part of dress long
after their ancestors, as well as the southern Britons, were unbreeched
by the Romans. From this distinction they acquired the name of
*Brigantes*, *quasi Bragantes*, and hence came the word to brag or boast
contemptuously; for the neighbours of the Brigantes, being at variance
with that people, used, by way of contumelious defiance, when they saw
any of them passing or repassing, to clap their hands on their
posteriors and cry *Brag-Brag*. I would have drawn a learned comparison
between the shield of Ajax and the sevenfold breeches of a Dutch
skipper. Finally, I would have promulgated the original use of
trunk-breeches, which would have led me into a discussion of the rites
of Cloacina, so differently worshipped by the southern and northern
inhabitants of this kingdom. These disquisitions would have unveiled the
mysteries that now conceal the origin, migration, superstition,
language, laws and connections of different nations-- *sed nunc non erit
his locus*. I shall only observe that Linscot and others are mistaken in
deriving the Japanese from their neighbours the Chinese; and that Dr
Kempfer is right in his conjecture, supposing them to have come from
Media immediately after the confusion of Babel. It is no wonder,
therefore, that being *Braccatorum filii*, they should retain the wide
breeches of their progenitors.
