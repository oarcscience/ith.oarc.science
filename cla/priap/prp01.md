### To Priapus

Ludens haec ego teste te, Priape,  
horto carmina digna, non libello,  
scripsi non nimium laboriose.  
nec Musas tamen, ut solent poetae,  
ad non virgineum locum vocavi.  
nam sensus mihi corque defuisset  
castas, Pierium chorum, sorores  
auso ducere mentulam ad Priapi.  
ergo quicquid id est, quod otiosus  
templi parietibus tui notavi,  
in partem accipias bonam, rogamus.

In play, Priapus (thou canst *test*ify),  
Songs, fit for garden not for book-work, I  
Wrote and none over-care applied thereto.  
No Muses dared I (like the verseful crew)  
Invite to visit such unvirginal site.  
For heart and senses did forbid me quite  
To set the choir Pïérian, chaste and fair,  
Before Priapus' tool--such deed to dare.  
Then whatsoe'er I wrote when idly gay,  
And on this Temple-wall for note I lay,  
Take in good part--such is the prayer I pray.

For pastime, and with little care, have I written these verses, thee
at*test*ing,\[1\] O Priapus--verses worthy a garden,\[2\] not a little
book! Nor have I, as poets are wont, invoked the Muses to this
unvirginal spot. For I had neither mind nor heart for the emprise, to
bring the chaste sisters, the chorus of Pïérides, to the mentule\[3\] of
Priapus. Therefore, whatever it is I have jotted in an idle hour on the
walls of thy temple, take it in good part, I pray thee.

\[1. Possibly with a punning allusion to testicles.  
2. A *double entendre* intended to be conveyed by the word 'garden'.  
3. The male member--*mentula*.\]
