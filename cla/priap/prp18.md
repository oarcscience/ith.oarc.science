### To Priapus

Hic quando Telethusa circulatrix,  
quae clunem tunica tegente nulla  
exstans altius altiusque movit,  
crisabit tibi fluctuante lumbo:  
haec sic non modo te, Priape, possit,  
privignum quoque sed movere Phaedrae.

Will ever Telethusa, posture-mime,  
Who with no tunic veiling hinder cheeks  
Higher than her vitals heaves with apter geste  
Wriggle to please thee with her wavy loins?  
So thee, Priapus, not alone she'll move  
E'en Phaedra's stepson shall her movement rouse.

Will Telethusa, the posture-dancer, who heaves up her haunches, denuded
of tunic, more gracefully and higher than her bosom,\[1\] ever, with
undulating loins,\[2\] wriggle her thighs\[3\] for thee in such wise as
not only to excite thy desires, O Priapus, but even those of the stepson
of Phaedra?

\[1. The posture alluded to is that attitude in coition in which the man
lies supine, whilst the woman mounts on him and provokes the orgasm by
her movements.

2\. In the original Latin, *flucto*, referring here to the wave-like
motion of the loins during congress.

3\. In the original Latin, *crisso*, meaning the buckings and wrigglings
of a woman's thighs and haunches during congress.\]
