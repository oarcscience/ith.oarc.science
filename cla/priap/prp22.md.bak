### Priapus

Quicumque hic violam rosamve carpet  
furtivumve holus aut inempta poma,  
defectus pueroque feminaque  
hac tentigine, quam videtis in me,  
rumpatur, precor, usque mentulaque  
nequiquam sibi pulset umbilicum.

Whoso of violets here shall pluck or rose,  
Or furtive greens or apples never bought,  
May he in want of woman or of boy  
By the same tension you in me behold  
Go burst, I ever pray, and may his yard  
Against his navel throb and rap in vain.

Whoever shall herein pluck a violet or a rose, or pilfer vegetables or
unbought apples, I pray that in the absence of both woman and boy he may
continually burst with that rigid tension which you see in me, and that
his mentule may in vain beat throbbing on his navel.
