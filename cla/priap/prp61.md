### To Priapus

Quid frustra quereris, colone, mecum,  
quod quondam bene fructuosa malus  
autumnis sterilis duobus adstem?  
non me praegravat, ut putas, senectus,  
nec sum grandine verberata dura,  
nec gemmas modo germine exeuntes  
seri frigoris ustulavit aura,  
nec venti pluviaeve siccitasve,  
quod de se quererer, malum dederunt;  
non sturnus mihi graculusve raptor  
aut cornix anus aut aquosus anser  
aut corvus nocuit siticulosus,  
sed quod carmina pessimi poetae  
ramis sustineo laboriosis.

Why, cultivator, vainly moan to me  
That I, a fruitful apple-tree whilom,  
For two autumnal seasons barren stand?  
Weighs me not down (as deemest thou) old age  
Nor am I floggèd by the hailstone hard,  
Nor yet my burgeon-gems a-budding new  
Are burnt by rigours of a wintry spring:  
Neither the winds nor rains nor yet the droughts  
Caused just complaining to the apple-tree;  
Nor me the starling or the robber 'Daw  
Or crow as crone old-grown or watery goose  
Or thirsty raven e'er endamagèd.  
No! but from bearing scribblers' rubbish verse  
On labouring branches comes mine every woe.

Why dost thou vainly complain, O husbandman, that I, once a well-fruited
apple tree, have now remained sterile throughout two autumns? 'Tis not
old age, as thou imaginest, which tells upon me; nor have I been beaten
by a violent hailstorm; nor has an unseasonable wintry blast nipped off
the blossoms just breaking forth from the stem. Neither have winds, nor
rain, nor droughts, given the apple tree any cause to murmur. The
starling, the plundering 'daw, the old crow, the water-loving goose, the
thirsty raven, none of these has injured me; but the verses of the most
execrable of poetasters which I bear on my grievously overladen
branches.
