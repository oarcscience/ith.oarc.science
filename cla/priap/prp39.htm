<P>Forma Mercurius potest placere,<BR>
forma conspiciendus est Apollo,<BR>
formosus quoque pingitur Lyaeus,<BR>
formosissimus omnium est Cupido.<BR>
me pulchra fateor carere forma,<BR>
verum mentula luculenta nostra est:<BR>
hanc mavult sibi quam deos priores,<BR>
si qua est non fatui puella cunni.</P>
<P>Form-charms in Mercury have might to please;<BR>
Form in Apollo is conspicuous charm;<BR>
Formose in picture is Lyaeus limned<BR>
And Cupid most formose of all is shown.<BR>
Freely of lovely form the lack I own;<BR>
Yet is our mentule a resplendent gem;<BR>
And this to th'erst-named gods shall aye prefer<BR>
The damsel dowered with no fatuous coynte.</P>
<P>Mercury has a pleasing form, Apollo's is eminent for its beauty; Lyaeus too is painted of comely figure; Cupid is handsomest of all. My figure is, I confess, wanting in beauty, but my mentule is, in truth, magnificent; and if there be a girl with a sensible coynte, she had rather have that for herself than all the former gods.</P>
