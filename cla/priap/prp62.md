# 62

### Priapus

Securi dormite, canes: custodiet hortum  
   cum sibi dilecta Sirius Erigone.

Sleep, O ye watchdogs! safe, while aid in guarding the garden  
Lover his leman beloved, Seirius Erigone.

Sleep dogs in safety: Sirius will watch over the garden with his beloved
Erigone.\[1\]

\[1. Sirius, the Dog Star, Erigone, the constellation Virgo. Icarus, the
father of Erigone, having been slain by some intoxicated shepherds, his
dog Maera, returning home, drew his daughter by her robe to where her
father lay. She hanged herself for grief, and the dog perished of
hunger. In compassion, Bacchus raised them to the sides, calling Icarus
by the name of Boötes; Erigone the Virgin; and Maera, Canicula, Sirius,
'the Dog Star' or Procyon.\]
