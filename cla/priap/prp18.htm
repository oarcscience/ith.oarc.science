<P>Hic quando Telethusa circulatrix,<BR>
quae clunem tunica tegente nulla<BR>
exstans altius altiusque movit,<BR>
crisabit tibi fluctuante lumbo:<BR>
haec sic non modo te, Priape, possit,<BR>
privignum quoque sed movere Phaedrae.</P>
<P>Will ever Telethusa, posture-mime,<BR>
Who with no tunic veiling hinder cheeks<BR>
Higher than her vitals heaves with apter geste<BR>
Wriggle to please thee with her wavy loins?<BR>
So thee, Priapus, not alone she'll move<BR>
E'en Phaedra's stepson shall her movement rouse.</P>
<P>Will Telethusa, the posture-dancer, who heaves up her haunches, denuded of tunic, more gracefully and higher than her bosom,[1] ever, with undulating loins,[2] wriggle her thighs[3] for thee in such wise as not only to excite thy desires, O Priapus, but even those of the stepson of Phaedra?</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The posture alluded to is that attitude in coition in which the man lies supine, whilst the woman mounts on him and provokes the orgasm by her movements.</P>
<P>2. In the original Latin, <I>flucto</I>, referring here to the wave-like motion of the loins during congress.</P>
<P>3. In the original Latin, <I>crisso</I>, meaning the buckings and wrigglings of a woman's thighs and haunches during congress.]</P>
