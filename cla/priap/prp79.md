### Priapus

At di deaeque dentibus tuis escam  
negent, amicae cunnilinge vicinae,  
per quem puella fortis ante nec mendax  
et quae solebat impigro celer passu  
ad nos venire, nunc misella landicae  
vix posse iurat ambulare prae fossis.

The Gods and Goddesses deny thy teeth  
A bait, a whetting, neighbour cunnilinge!  
Thro' whom my girl (once strong and never false,  
But with her swift untiring paces wont  
To visit us), that hapless Labdacé,  
Swears for her ditches she can hardly crawl.

But may the gods and goddesses deny nourishing food to thy teeth, O
neighbouring cunnilinge, through whom my girl, hitherto strong and not
false, and who was wont swiftly with untired step to hasten to me, now
unfortunate Labdace swears that she can scarce drag her feet along by
reason of her ditch.\[1\]
