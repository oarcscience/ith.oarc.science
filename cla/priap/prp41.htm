<P>Quisquis venerit huc, poeta fiat<BR>
et versus mihi dedicet iocosos.<BR>
qui non fecerit, inter eruditos<BR>
ficosissimus ambulet poetas.</P>
<P>Whoso comes hither shall a bard become<BR>
And to me dedicate facetious verse;<BR>
But who thiswise doth not, 'mid learn&egrave;d poets<BR>
Shall pace with fundament fulfilled of 'figs'.</P>
<P>Whoever comes hither let him become a poet and dedicate to me jocose verses. He who does not, shall, teeming with piles,[1] walk amongst learned poets.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Piles were a frequent result of sodomy. The word <I>ficus</I> means primarily a fig, and piles were so called from their resemblance in shape to that fruit.]</P>
