### Priapus

Heus tu, non bene qui manum rapacem  
mandato mihi contines ab horto,  
iam primum stator hic libidinosus  
alternis et eundo et exeundo  
porta te faciet patentiorem.  
accedent duo, qui latus tuentur,  
pulchre pensilibus peculiati;  
qui cum te male foderint iacentem,  
ad partes veniet salax asellus  
nilo deterius mutuniatus.  
quare qui sapiet, malum cavebit,  
cum tantum sciet esse mentularum.

Ho thou, which hardly thy rapacious hand  
Canst from the garden in my charge contain,  
First shall this watchman, ever lustful loon,  
Entering and exiting alternate-wise  
Widen thy portal to its fullest stretch  
Then shall the couple guarding either flank,  
Grandly provided with those pensile parts,  
After they've sorely pierced thee prostrate thrown  
Bring to the self-same part an ass-foal lewd  
Gifted with pizzle not a whit the worse.  
Then who is wise beware of working ill,  
Knowing so much of pego waits him here.

Hark ye, thou who scarcely withholdest thy greedy hand from the garden
entrusted to me. Now, first the watchman, full of lechery, with
alternate entrance and exit, shall make thy passage an open one. Then
two shall approach, who stand guard at each side, nobly provided with
pensile property. Who, when they have grievously ploughed thee,
stretched prostrate, to the same part shall come a rampant little ass,
by no means inferior in well-hung pizzle. Wherefore, he who is wise will
beware of ill-doing, when he knows that here is so much of the mentule.
