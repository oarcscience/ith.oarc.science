<P>Quicumque hic violam rosamve carpet<BR>
furtivumve holus aut inempta poma,<BR>
defectus pueroque feminaque<BR>
hac tentigine, quam videtis in me,<BR>
rumpatur, precor, usque mentulaque<BR>
nequiquam sibi pulset umbilicum.</P>
<P>Whoso of violets here shall pluck or rose,<BR>
Or furtive greens or apples never bought,<BR>
May he in want of woman or of boy<BR>
By the same tension you in me behold<BR>
Go burst, I ever pray, and may his yard<BR>
Against his navel throb and rap in vain.</P>
<P>Whoever shall herein pluck a violet or a rose, or pilfer vegetables or unbought apples, I pray that in the absence of both woman and boy he may continually burst with that rigid tension which you see in me, and that his mentule may in vain beat throbbing on his navel.</P>
