### To Priapus

### by Albus Tibullus concerning the inertia of his privy member

Quid hoc novi est? Quid ira nuntiat deum?  
Silente nocte candidus mihi puer  
tepente cum iaceret abditus sinu,  
venus fuit quieta, nec viriliter  
iners senile penis extulit caput.  
Placet, Priape, qui sub arboris coma  
soles, sacrum revincte pampino caput,  
ruber sedere cum rubente fascino?  
At, o Triphalle, saepe floribus novis  
tuas sine arte deligavimus comas,  
abegimusque voce saepe, cum tibi  
senexve corvus impigerve graculus  
sacrum feriret ore corneo caput.  
Vale nefande destitutor inguinum,  
vale Priape: debeo tibi nihil.  
Iacebis inter arva pallidus situ,  
canisque saeva susque ligneo tibi  
lutosus affricabit oblitum latus.  
At o sceleste penis, o meum malum,  
gravi piaque lege noxiam lues.  
Licet querare, nec tibi tener puer  
patebit ullus, imminente qui toro  
iuvante verset arte mobilem natem,  
puella nec iocosa te levi manu  
fovebit apprimetve lucidum femur.  
Bidens amica Romluli senis memor  
paratur, inter atra cuius inguina  
latet iacente pantice abditus specus,  
vagaque pelle tectus annuo gelu  
araneosus obsidet forem situs.  
Tibi haec paratur, ut tuum ter aut quater  
voret profunda fossa lubricum caput.  
Licebit aeger angue lentior cubes,  
tereris usque, donec (a miser! miser!)  
triplexque quadruplexque compleas specum.  
Superbia ista proderit nihil, simul  
vagum sonante merseris caput luto.  
Quid est, iners? Pigetne lentitudinis?  
Licebit hoc inultus auferas semel,  
sed ille cum redibit aureus puer,  
simul sonante senseris iter pede,  
rigente nervos excubet libidine,  
et inquietus inguina arrigat tumor,  
neque incitare cesset usque dum mihi  
venus iocosa molle ruperit latus.

What news be here? what send those angry gods?  
Whenas in silent night that snow-hued boy  
To my warm bosom claspèd lay concealed,  
Venus was dormant nor in manly guise  
My sluggard prickle raised his senile head.  
Art pleased (Priapus!) under leafy tree  
Wont with vine-tendrils sacred sconce to wreathe  
And seat thee ruddy with thy ruddled yard?  
But, O Triphallus, oft with freshest flowers  
Artlessly garlanded thy brow we crowned  
And with loud shouting often drove from thee  
What agèd Raven or what agile 'Daw  
Would peck thy holy face with horny beak.  
Farewell, Priapus! naught to thee owe I  
Farewell, forsaker damn'd of private parts!  
Pale with neglect amid the fields shalt he  
Where savage bandog shall bepiss thee or  
Wild boar shall rub thee with his ribs mud-caked.  
Accursèd Penis! Oh, by whom my pains  
Shall with sore righteous penalty be paid?  
Howe'er thou 'plain, no more shall tender boy  
Ope to thy bidding, nor on groaning bed  
His mobile buttocks writhe with aiding art:  
Nor shall the wanton damsel's legier hand  
Stroke thee, or rub on thee her lubric thigh.  
A two-fanged mistress, Romulus old remembering,  
Awaits thee; middlemost whose sable groin  
And hide time-loosened thou with coynte-rime bewrayed  
And hung in cobwebs fain shalt block the way.  
Such prize is thine who thrice and four times shalt  
Engulf thy lecherous head in fosse profound.  
Though sick or languid lie thou, still thou must  
Rasp her till wretched, wretched thou shalt fill  
Thrice or e'en fourfold times her cavernous gape;  
And naught this haughty sprite shall 'vail thee when  
Plunging thine errant head in plashing mire.  
Why lies it lazy? Doth its sloth displease thee?  
For once thou mayest weaken it unavenged;  
But when that golden boy again shall come,  
Soon as his patter on the path shalt hear,  
Grant that a restless swelling rouse my nerve  
Lustful a-sudden and upraise it high,  
Nor cease excite it and excite it more  
Till wanton Venus burst my weakened side.

What news is this? What does the anger of the gods announce? When in the
silent night a lovely boy lay with me hidden in my warm bosom, my desire
was quiescent, nor did the sluggish penis courageously raise its senile
head. Does it please thee, Priapus? who under the foliage of a tree art
wont, thy sacred head circled with the leaves and tendrils of the vine,
ruddy to sit with rubicund *fascinum*. But, O Triphallus, oft fresh
flowers with loving care have I wreathed in thy locks; and oft driven
off with my shouts an aged raven or an active jackdaw when it would have
pecked thy sacred head with its horny bill. Fare thee well, Priapus, I
owe thee naught. Farewell, impious forsaker of the privities, thou shalt
he in the glebe mouldy with neglect; a savage dog shall continually piss
upon thee, or a wild boar rub against thee his side befouled with mire.
O cursed father of the penis, to whom my calamity \[is due\], thou shalt
expiate this injury with a severe and pious atonement. Thou canst
complain: no tender lad shall yield to thee who on the groaning bed with
aiding art shall writhe his mobile buttocks. Nor shall a sportive girl
caress thee with her gentle hand, or press against thee her lubricious
thigh. A mistress with two teeth is prepared for thee, who can call to
mind the time of Romulus; and amid her gloomy loins and loose-stretched
hide, covered with frost and full of mould and cobwebs, thy privity
shall blockade the entrance. This is the one prepared for thee, that
thrice and four times her bottomless ditch may swallow up thy lubricious
head. Notwithstanding weak and languid thou liest, thou shalt shag her
again and again until, O miserable wretch, thrice and fourfold thou
fillest her cavity. And now thy pride shall avail thee naught when thou
plungest thy reeling head into the splashing mire. Why is \[my yard\]
inert? doth not its sluggishness displease thee? This once thou mayst
deprive it of vigour with impunity. But when that golden boy shall
return, at the same time that thou hearest the patter of his foot upon
the path, on a sudden let a restless swelling excite my nerves with lust
and raise my privy part; nor let it cease to incite more and more until
sportive Venus shall have spent my feeble strength.
