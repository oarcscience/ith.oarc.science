### Priapus

Huc huc, quisquis es, in dei salacis  
deverti grave ne puta sacellum.  
et si nocte fuit puella tecum,  
hac re quod metuas adire, non est.  
istuc caelitibus datur severis:  
nos vappae sumus et pusilla culti  
ruris numina, nos pudore pulso  
stamus sub Iove coleis apertis.  
ergo quilibet huc licebit intret  
nigra fornicis oblitus favilla.

Here' Here! nor dare expect (whoe'er thou be)  
To 'scape the Lecher God's fane venerand;  
And, if a damsel lay the night with thee,  
From this my presence fear not to be bann'd  
Fen as the sterner Gods of Heaven command.  
The Ne'er-do-wells and paltry gods are we  
Of rural worship and 'spite modesty  
Aye under Jove with balls a-bare we stand:  
Then enter whoso hither entry seek  
Reckless of bawdy-house's blackened reek!

Hither, hither, whoever thou art, to the venerable sanctuary of the
lecherous God, nor think to be turned away. And if a girl were with thee
in the night, 'tis no reason why thou shouldst fear to approach my
altar; though it is otherwise with the stem Gods above.\[1\] I am a
good-for-naught, a paltry rustic deity of scant culture. I stand in the
open air, my modesty thrust aside, My bollocks exposed to view.
Therefore, 'tis permitted to enter hither all who will, besmirched with
the black filth of the stews.\[2\]

\[1. The ancients thought that those defiled by carnal coition generally
were precluded from worship of the gods until they had been purified by
bathing.

2\. In the stews, they had lamps hanging, on the back part of which was
expressed, hieroglyphically, to whom they were dedicated. Many of these
lamps bore phallic emblems: I have seen one on the upper part of which
was a sculpture representing Leda in the act of coition with the swan.
The *Satyricon* of Petronius Arbiter and the *Satires* of Juvenal and
Horace all speak of the Roman brothels, which were constructed in the
form of a gallery along which were ranged, on each side like a nunnery,
a number of contiguous cells or chambers. Over the door of each of these
was posted a bill with the price and name of the tenant, who stood at
the entrance soliciting the preferences of the visitors.\]
