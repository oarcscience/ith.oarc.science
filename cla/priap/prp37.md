### The Interpretation of a Votive Offering\[1\]

Cur pictum memori sit in tabella  
membrum, quaeritis, unde procreamur?  
cum penis mihi forte laesus esset  
chirurgamque manum miser timerem,  
dis me legitimis nimisque magnis,  
ut Phoebo puta filioque Phoebi,  
curatum dare mentulam verebar.  
huic dixi: 'fer opem, Priape, parti,  
cuius tu, pater, ipse pars videris,  
qua salva sine sectione facta  
ponetur tibi picta, quam levaris,  
compar consimilisque concolorque'.  
promisit fore mentulamque movit  
pro nutu deus et rogata fecit.

Why on memorial tablet do they limn  
(You ask) the member which begets us all?  
Whenas by accident my yard was hurt  
And I (unhappy!) feared the surgeon's hand  
To such legitimate almighty gods--  
Phoebus for instance take or Phoebus' son--  
I blushed to offer for a cure my cock  
And prayed--'Priapus, an thou heal the part,  
O Sire, whose very counterpart thou seem'st  
And without hacking make it whole again,  
One linmed on tablet shall to thee be given  
Like-sized, like-coloured and alike of shape.'  
The God to promise deigning wagged his yard,  
By way of nod divine, and did my bede.

You ask why the instrument of procreation has been painted on the
memorable tablet. When by accident I had bruised my penis, and wretched
with suffering, dreaded the hand of the surgeon (moreover I was afraid
to give the cure of my mentule to the legitimate and almighty gods, such
as Phoebus, for instance, and Phoebus's son),\[2\] 'Help, O Priapus,'
quoth I, 'help thou the part whose very counterpart, O Sire, thou
seemest; and if thou shalt restore it safely to health without
amputation,\[3\] I will consecrate to thee, painted on a tablet, a very
facsimile of it, alike in size, shape and colour! 'The God promised; for
nod bobbed his mentule;\[4\] and has granted my prayer.

\[1. Pacificus Maximus addresses a similar entreaty to Priapus, when
suffering from the pox, offering, if cured, to dedicate to the god a
waxen column equal in size to that of the sufferer. Cures were sought to
such *morbi venerii* as *inflamatio coleomm* (swollen testicles),
*tubercula circa glandem* (warts on the glans penis), *cancri
carbunculi* (chancre or shanker) and a few others.

2\. Phoebus was the god of the healing art. Aesculapius was his son.

3\. Reminding one of Don Juan's healthy horror when they proposed to
circumcise him.

4\. Parodying the majestic nod of Jupiter when grating a request.\]
