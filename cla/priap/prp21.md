### Priapus

Femina si furtum faciet mihi virve puerve,  
   haec cunnum, caput hic praebeat, ille nates.

An fro' me woman shall thieve or plunder me man or a man-child,  
She shall pay me with coynte, that with his mouth, this with arse.

If a woman, man, or boy, thieve from me, let her coynte, his mouth, the
latter's buttocks, be submitted \[to my mentule\].

\[1. Cheaply purchased in the market: not grown in the donor's orchard.
The Via Sacra was a market street in Rome, in the fourth region leading
from the Forum to the Capitol. The sense of this epigram is somewhat
obscure. Priapus's master, who has suffered reverses, is making an
offering to the god, and wishes Priapus to keep up the deception apropos
his wealth by concealing from enquirers that the offering of fruit was
not from the orchard of the giver, but purchased in the public market.\]
