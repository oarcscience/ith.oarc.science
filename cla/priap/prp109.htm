<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Depilation by Catamites</H1>
<P>Martial derides catamites for depilating their privy parts and buttocks. The following version of Martial's epigram against a beau (<I>bellus homo</I>) is given by Dr James Cranstoun in the illustrative notes to his translation of Catullus:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Cotilus, you are a beau; yes, Cotilus, many declare it.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the story I hear: tell me, then, what is a beau?<BR>
Why, sir, a beau is a man who arranges his tresses in order:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smelling for ever of balm, smelling of cinnamon spice:<BR>
Singing the songs of the Nile or a-humming the ditties of Cadiz:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never at rest with his arms, moving them this way or that:<BR>
Lounging on sofas from morning to night with a bevy of ladies:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye in the ears of some girl whispering some silly tale:<BR>
Reading a letter from Rhode or Chloe, or writing to Phyllis:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shunning the sleeve of his friend lest he should ruffle his dress:<BR>
Everyone's sweetheart he'll tell you, he swaggers the lion at parties:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bets on the favourite horse, tells you his sire and his dam.<BR>
Cotilus, what are you telling me?--this thing! is this thing a beau?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cotilus, then I must say he's a contemptible thing.</P></DIR>

<P>Juvenal devotes his finest Satire (the second) to a forcible denunciation of the infamous practices of these sodomites. In it he says:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>One man with a needle slanted, lengthens his eyebrows, touched with moistened soot, and, lifting up his eyelids, paints his quivering eyes. Another drinks from a Priapus-shaped glass, and confines his flowing locks in a golden net, clothing himself in cerulean checks or greenish-yellow vestments, whilst his valet swears by the Juno of his master. A third holds a mirror, the accoutrement of pathic Otho, 'the spoil of Auruncan Actor', in which he viewed himself, armed for battle, when he commanded the standards to be raised.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Tertullian speaks of ustricles (from <I>urere</I>--to bum), female delipators who made use of boiling dropax to bum the hairs on the legs and other parts of the body of these voluptuaries. Other references to these effeminate practices--particularly that of depilating the body-pile with dropax or psilothrum (melted rosin in oil) or with tweezers--are made by Persius, Ausonius, Juvenal, Martial, Suetonius, Quintilian, Julius Capitolinus, Pliny, Aeitus, &amp;c., &amp;c.</P>
