<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">To Priapus</H3>
<P>Hic tibi, qui rostro crescentia lilia mersit,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; caeditur e tepida victima porcus hara:<BR>
ne tamen exanimum facias pecus omne, Priape,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; horti sit, facias, ianua clausa tui.</P>
<P>This, with his snout aye alert to uproot the lilies a-blowing,<BR>
Slain for thy victim 's the pig bred in the stye's tepid reek.<BR>
But, an thy will be not to murther the herd, O Priapus,<BR>
Grant of thy grace yon gate into the garden be shut.</P>
<P>This pig, which has crushed the rising lilies with his snout, is sacrificed to thee--a victim warm from the stye. But lest thou shouldst cause the whole herd to be annihilated, O Priapus, bid the gate of thy garden to be closed.[2]</P>
