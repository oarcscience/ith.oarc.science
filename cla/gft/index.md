This is Charles Kingsley's able retelling of the myths of Perseus, Jason
and the Argonauts, and Theseus for young adults, originally published
circa 1856. Kingsley is best known as the author of Water Babies.
Although this is not the first time this text has appeared on the
Internet, this is the only version with the complete set of Squire and
Mars black and white and four-color art-deco illustrations. This
includes two illustrations censored from later editions, probably
because of female nudity. This also includes the original Preface, which
was omitted from later editions. Otherwise the text, particularly the
punctuation, was proofed according to a 1901 edition.
