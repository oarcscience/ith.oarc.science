#### Section 11

11\. But how can the unextended reach over the defined extension of the
corporeal? How can it, so, maintain itself as a unity, an identity?

This is a problem often raised and reason calls vehemently for a
solution of the difficulties involved. The fact stands abundantly
evident, but there is still the need of intellectual satisfaction.

We have, of course, no slight aid to conviction, indeed the very
strongest, in the exposition of the character of that principle. It is
not like a stone, some vast block lying where it lies, covering the
space of its own extension, held within its own limits, having a fixed
quantity of mass and of assigned stone-power. It is a First Principle,
measureless, not bounded within determined size- such measurement
belongs to another order- and therefore it is all-power, nowhere under
limit. Being so, it is outside of Time.

Time in its ceaseless onward sliding produces parted interval; Eternity
stands in identity, pre-eminent, vaster by unending power than Time with
all the vastness of its seeming progress; Time is like a radial line
running out apparently to infinity but dependent upon that, its centre,
which is the pivot of all its movement; as it goes it tells of that
centre, but the centre itself is the unmoving principle of all the
movement.

Time stands, thus, in analogy with the principle which holds fast in
unchanging identity of essence: but that principle is infinite not only
in duration but also in power: this infinity of power must also have its
counterpart, a principle springing from that infinite power and
dependent upon it; this counterpart will, after its own mode, run a
course- corresponding to the course of Time- in keeping with that
stationary power which is its greater as being its source: and in this
too the source is present throughout the full extension of its lower
correspondent.

This secondary of Power, participating as far as it may in that higher,
must be identified.

Now the higher power is present integrally but, in the weakness of the
recipient material, is not discerned as every point; it is present as an
identity everywhere not in the mode of the material triangle- identical
though, in many representations, numerically multiple, but in the mode
of the immaterial, ideal triangle which is the source of the material
figures. If we are asked why the omnipresence of the immaterial triangle
does not entail that of the material figure, we answer that not all
Matter enters into the participation necessary; Matter accepts various
forms and not all Matter is apt for all form; the First Matter, for
example, does not lend itself to all but is for the First Kinds first
and for the others in due order, though these, too, are omnipresent.
