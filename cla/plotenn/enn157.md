#### Section 2

2\. Therefore we must affirm no more than these three Primals: we are
not to introduce superfluous distinctions which their nature rejects. We
are to proclaim one Intellectual-Principle unchangeably the same, in no
way subject to decline, acting in imitation, as true as its nature
allows, of the Father.

And as to our own Soul we are to hold that it stands, in part, always in
the presence of The Divine Beings, while in part it is concerned with
the things of this sphere and in part occupies a middle ground. It is
one nature in graded powers; and sometimes the Soul in its entirety is
borne along by the loftiest in itself and in the Authentic Existent;
sometimes, the less noble part is dragged down and drags the mid-soul
with it, though the law is that the Soul may never succumb entire.

The Soul's disaster falls upon it when it ceases to dwell in the perfect
Beauty- the appropriate dwelling-place of that Soul which is no part and
of which we too are no part- thence to pour forth into the frame of the
All whatsoever the All can hold of good and beauty. There that Soul
rests, free from all solicitude, not ruling by plan or policy, not
redressing, but establishing order by the marvellous efficacy of its
contemplation of the things above it.

For the measure of its absorption in that vision is the measure of its
grace and power, and what it draws from this contemplation it
communicates to the lower sphere, illuminated and illuminating always.
