<P>3. If this principle is the Authentic Existent and holds
unchanging identity, does not go forth from itself, is untouched by
any process of becoming or, as we have said, by any situation in
place, then it must be always self-gathered, never in separation,
not partly here and partly there, not giving forth from itself: any
such instability would set it in thing after thing or at least in
something other than itself: then it would no longer be 
self-gathered;
nor would it be immune, for anything within which it were 
lodged would
affect it; immune, it is not in anything. If, then, not standing
away from itself, not distributed by part, not taking the slightest
change, it is to be in many things while remaining a 
self-concentrated
entire, there is some way in which it has multipresence; it 
is at once
self-enclosed and not so: the only way is to recognise that 
while this
principle itself is not lodged in anything, all other things
participate in it- all that are apt and in the measure of their
aptitude.

<P>Thus, we either cancel all that we have affirmed and the
principles laid down, and deny the existence of any such Nature, or,
that being impossible, we return to our first position:

<P>The One, numerically identical, undistributed, an 
unbroken entire,
yet stands remote from nothing that exists by its side; but it does
not, for that, need to pour itself forth: there is no 
necessity either
that certain portions of it enter into things or again that, while
it remains self-abiding, something produced and projected from it
enter at various points into that other order. Either would imply
something of it remaining there while the emanant is elsewhere: thus
separated from what has gone forth, it would experience local
division. And would those emanants be, each in itself, whole or
part? If part, the One has lost its nature, that of an entire, as we
have already indicated; if whole, then either the whole is broken up
to coincide point for point with that in which it is become 
present or
we are admitting that an unbroken identity can be omnipresent.

<P>This is a reasoning, surely, founded on the thing itself and its
essential nature, not introducing anything foreign, anything 
belonging
to the Other Order.
