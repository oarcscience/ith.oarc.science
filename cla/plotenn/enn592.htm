<P>3. But are we to think of this Authentic Being as, itself,
present, or does it remain detached, omnipresent in the sense only
that powers from it enter everywhere?

<P>Under the theory of presence by powers, souls are described as
rays; the source remains self-locked and these are flung forth to
impinge upon particular living things.

<P>Now, in beings whose unity does not reproduce the entire 
nature of
that principle, any presence is presence of an emanant power: even
this, however, does not mean that the principle is less than
integrally present; it is not sundered from the power which it has
uttered; all is offered, but the recipient is able to take only so
much. But in Beings in which the plenitude of these powers is
manifested, there clearly the Authentic itself is present, though
still as remaining distinct; it is distinct in that, becoming the
informing principle of some definite thing, it would 
abdicate from its
standing as the total and from its uttermost self-abiding and would
belong, in some mode of accident, to another thing as well. Still it
is not the property of what may seek to join with it; it 
chooses where
it will and enters as the participant's power may allow, but it does
not become a chattel; it remains the quested and so in another sense
never passes over. There is nothing disquieting in omnipresence
after this mode where there is no appropriation: in the same
accidental way, we may reasonably put it, soul concurs with body,
but it is soul self-holding, not inbound with Matter, free 
even of the
body which it has illuminated through and through.

<P>Nor does the placelessness of Being make it surprising that it
be present universally to things of place; on the contrary, 
the wonder
would be- the more than wonder, the impossibility- if from a place
of its own it were present to other things in their place, or if
having place it were present at all- and, especially present, as we
assert, integrally.

<P>But set it outside of place, and reason tells us that it will be
present entire where it is present at all and that, present to the
total, it must be present in the same completeness to every several
unity; otherwise something of it is here and something there, and at
once it is fragmentary, it is body.

<P>How can we so dispart Being? We cannot break Life into parts; if
the total was Life, the fragment is not. But we do not thus sunder
Intelligence, one intelligence in this man, another in that? No;
such a fragment would not be Intelligence. But the Being of the
individual? Once more, if the total thing is Being, then a fragment
could not be. Are we told that in a body, a total of parts, every
member is also a body? But here we are dividing not body but a
particular quantity of body, each of those divisions being described
as body in virtue of possessing the Form or Idea that constitutes
body; and this Idea has no magnitude, is incapable of magnitude.
