<P>15. According to Plato, lots and choice play a part [in the
determination of human conditions] before the Spindle of Necessity
is turned; that once done, only the Spindle-destiny is 
valid; it fixes
the chosen conditions irretrievably since the elected
guardian-spirit becomes accessory to their accomplishment.

<P>But what is the significance of the Lots?

<P>By the Lots we are to understand birth into the conditions
actually existent in the All at the particular moment of each entry
into body, birth into such and such a physical frame, from such and
such parents, in this or that place, and generally all that in our
phraseology is the External.

<P>For Particulars and Universals alike it is established 
that to the
first of those known as the Fates, to Clotho the Spinner, must be
due the unity and as it were interweaving of all that 
exists: Lachesis
presides over the Lots: to Atropos must necessarily belong 
the conduct
of mundane events.

<P>Of men, some enter into life as fragments of the All, bound to
that which is external to themselves: they are victims of a sort of
fascination, and are hardly, or not at all, themselves: but others
mastering all this- straining, so to speak, by the head towards the
Higher, to what is outside even the Soul- preserve still the
nobility and the ancient privilege of the Soul's essential being.

<P>For certainly we cannot think of the Soul as a thing whose
nature is just a sum of impressions from outside- as if it, alone,
of all that exists, had no native character.

<P>No: much more than all else, the Soul, possessing the Idea which
belongs to a Principle, must have as its native wealth many powers
serving to the activities of its Kind. It is an 
Essential-Existent and
with this Existence must go desire and act and the tendency towards
some good.

<P>While body and soul stand one combined thing, there is a joint
nature, a definite entity having definite functions and employments;
but as soon as any Soul is detached, its employments are kept apart,
its very own: it ceases to take the body's concerns to itself: it
has vision now: body and soul stand widely apart.
