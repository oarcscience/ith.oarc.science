#### Section 5

5\. It may be objected that the Intellectual-Principle possesses its
content in an eternal conjunction so that the two make a perfect unity,
and that thus there is no Matter there.

But that argument would equally cancel the Matter present in the bodily
forms of this realm: body without shape has never existed, always body
achieved and yet always the two constituents. We discover these two-
Matter and Idea- by sheer force of our reasoning which distinguishes
continually in pursuit of the simplex, the irreducible, working on,
until it can go no further, towards the ultimate in the subject of
enquiry. And the ultimate of every partial-thing is its Matter, which,
therefore, must be all darkness since light is a Reason-Principle. The
Mind, too, as also a Reason-Principle, sees only in each particular
object the Reason-Principle lodging there; anything lying below that it
declares to lie below the light, to be therefore a thing of darkness,
just as the eye, a thing of light, seeks light and colours which are
modes of light, and dismisses all that is below the colours and hidden
by them, as belonging to the order of the darkness, which is the order
of Matter.

The dark element in the Intelligible, however, differs from that in the
sense-world: so therefore does the Matter- as much as the forming-Idea
presiding in each of the two realms. The Divine Matter, though it is the
object of determination has, of its own nature, a life defined and
intellectual; the Matter of this sphere while it does accept
determination is not living or intellective, but a dead thing decorated:
any shape it takes is an image, exactly as the Base is an image. There
on the contrary the shape is a real-existent as is the Base. Those that
ascribe Real Being to Matter must be admitted to be right as long as
they keep to the Matter of the Intelligible Realm: for the Base there is
Being, or even, taken as an entirety with the higher that accompanies
it, is illuminated Being.

But does this Base, of the Intellectual Realm, possess eternal
existence?

The solution of that question is the same as for the Ideas.

Both are engendered, in the sense that they have had a beginning, but
unengendered in that this beginning is not in Time: they have a derived
being but by an eternal derivation: they are not, like the Kosmos,
always in process but, in the character of the Supernal, have their
Being permanently. For that differentiation within the Intelligible
which produces Matter has always existed and it is this cleavage which
produces the Matter there: it is the first movement; and movement and
differentiation are convertible terms since the two things arose as one:
this motion, this cleavage, away from the first is indetermination \[=
Matter\], needing The First to its determination which it achieves by
its Return, remaining, until then, an Alienism, still lacking good;
unlit by the Supernal. It is from the Divine that all light comes, and,
until this be absorbed, no light in any recipient of light can be
authentic; any light from elsewhere is of another order than the true.
