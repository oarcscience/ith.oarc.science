#### Section 16

16\. Then Matter is simply Alienism \[the Principle of Difference\]?

No: it is merely that part of Alienism which stands in contradiction
with the Authentic Existents which are Reason-Principles. So understood,
this non-existent has a certain measure of existence; for it is
identical with Privation, which also is a thing standing in opposition
to the things that exist in Reason.

But must not Privation cease to have existence, when what has been
lacking is present at last?

By no means: the recipient of a state or character is not a state but
the Privation of the state; and that into which determination enters is
neither a determined object nor determination itself, but simply the
wholly or partly undetermined.

Still, must not the nature of this Undetermined be annulled by the entry
of Determination, especially where this is no mere attribute?

No doubt to introduce quantitative determination into an undetermined
object would annul the original state; but in the particular case, the
introduction of determination only confirms the original state, bringing
it into actuality, into full effect, as sowing brings out the natural
quality of land or as a female organism impregnated by the male is not
defeminized but becomes more decidedly of its sex; the thing becomes
more emphatically itself.

But on this reasoning must not Matter owe its evil to having in some
degree participated in good?

No: its evil is in its first lack: it was not a possessor (of some
specific character).

To lack one thing and to possess another, in something like equal
proportions, is to hold a middle state of good and evil: but whatsoever
possesses nothing and so is in destitution- and especially what is
essentially destitution- must be evil in its own Kind.

For in Matter we have no mere absence of means or of strength; it is
utter destitution- of sense, of virtue, of beauty, of pattern, of Ideal
principle, of quality. This is surely ugliness, utter disgracefulness,
unredeemed evil.

The Matter in the Intellectual Realm is an Existent, for there is
nothing previous to it except the Beyond-Existence; but what precedes
the Matter of this sphere is Existence; by its alienism in regard to the
beauty and good of Existence, Matter is therefore a non-existent.
