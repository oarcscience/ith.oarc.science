#### Section 5

5\. It is possible to reconcile all these apparent contradictions- the
divine sowing to birth, as opposed to a voluntary descent aiming at the
completion of the universe; the judgement and the cave; necessity and
free choice- in fact the necessity includes the choice-embodiment as an
evil; the Empedoclean teaching of a flight from God, a wandering away, a
sin bringing its punishment; the "solace by flight" of Heraclitus; in a
word a voluntary descent which is also voluntary.

All degeneration is no doubt involuntary, yet when it has been brought
about by an inherent tendency, that submission to the inferior may be
described as the penalty of an act.

On the other hand these experiences and actions are determined by an
external law of nature, and they are due to the movement of a being
which in abandoning its superior is running out to serve the needs of
another: hence there is no inconsistency or untruth in saying that the
soul is sent down by God; final results are always to be referred to the
starting point even across many intervening stages.

Still there is a twofold flaw: the first lies in the motive of the
Soul's descent \[its audacity, its Tolma\], and the second in the evil
it does when actually here: the first is punished by what the soul has
suffered by its descent: for the faults committed here, the lesser
penalty is to enter into body after body- and soon to return- by
judgement according to desert, the word judgement indicating a divine
ordinance; but any outrageous form of ill-doing incurs a proportionately
greater punishment administered under the surveillance of chastising
daimons.

Thus, in sum, the soul, a divine being and a dweller in the loftier
realms, has entered body; it is a god, a later phase of the divine: but,
under stress of its powers and of its tendency to bring order to its
next lower, it penetrates to this sphere in a voluntary plunge: if it
turns back quickly, all is well; it will have taken no hurt by acquiring
the knowledge of evil and coming to understand what sin is, by bringing
its forces into manifest play, by exhibiting those activities and
productions which, remaining merely potential in the unembodied, might
as well never have been even there, if destined never to come into
actuality, so that the soul itself would never have known that
suppressed and inhibited total.

The act reveals the power, a power hidden, and we might almost say
obliterated or nonexistent, unless at some moment it became effective:
in the world as it is, the richness of the outer stirs us all to the
wonder of the inner whose greatness is displayed in acts so splendid.
