#### Section 2

2\. We are obliged, therefore, at the start, both to establish the
existence of this other Kind and to examine its nature and the mode of
its Being.

Now if Matter must characteristically be undetermined, void of shape,
while in that sphere of the Highest there can be nothing that lacks
determination, nothing shapeless, there can be no Matter there. Further,
if all that order is simplex, there can be no need of Matter, whose
function is to join with some other element to form a compound: it will
be found of necessity in things of derived existence and shifting
nature- the signs which lead us to the notion of Matter- but it is
unnecessary to the primal.

And again, where could it have come from? whence did it take its being?
If it is derived, it has a source: if it is eternal, then the
Primal-Principles are more numerous than we thought, the Firsts are a
meeting-ground. Lastly, if that Matter has been entered by Idea, the
union constitutes a body; and, so, there is Body in the Supreme.
