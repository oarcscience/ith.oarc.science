<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 10</H4>

<P>10. Under detailed investigation, many other tenets of this
school- indeed we might say all- could be corrected with an
abundance of proof. But I am withheld by regard for some of our own
friends who fell in with this doctrine before joining our circle
and, strangely, still cling to it.

<P>The school, no doubt, is free-spoken enough- whether in the set
purpose of giving its opinions a plausible colour of verity or in
honest belief- but we are addressing here our own acquaintances, not
those people with whom we could make no way. We have spoken in the
hope of preventing our friends from being perturbed by a party which
brings, not proof- how could it?- but arbitrary, tyrannical 
assertion;
another style of address would be applicable to such as have the
audacity to flout the noble and true doctrines of the august
teachers of antiquity.

<P>That method we will not apply; anyone that has fully grasped the
preceding discussion will know how to meet every point in the system.

<P>Only one other tenet of theirs will be mentioned before passing
the matter; it is one which surpasses all the rest in sheer folly,
if that is the word.

<P>They first maintain that the Soul and a certain "Wisdom"
[Sophia] declined and entered this lower sphere though they leave us
in doubt of whether the movement originated in Soul or in this
Sophia of theirs, or whether the two are the same to them- then they
tell us that the other Souls came down in the descent and that these
members of Sophia took to themselves bodies, human bodies, for
example.

<P>Yet in the same breath, that very Soul which was the occasion of
descent to the others is declared not to have descended. "It knew no
decline," but merely illuminated the darkness in such a way that an
image of it was formed upon the Matter. Then, they shape an image of
that image somewhere below- through the medium of Matter or of
Materiality or whatever else of many names they choose to give it in
their frequent change of terms, invented to darken their 
doctrine- and
so they bring into being what they call the Creator or Demiurge,
then this lower is severed from his Mother [Sophia] and becomes the
author of the Kosmos down to the latest of the succession of images
constituting it.

<P>Such is the blasphemy of one of their writers.
