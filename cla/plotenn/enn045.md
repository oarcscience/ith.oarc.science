#### Section 13

13\. The characteristic activities are not hindered by outer events but

finer for dealing with the actual. When he has to handle particular
cases and things, he may not be able to put his vision into act without
searching and thinking, but the one greatest principle is ever present

a victim in the much-talked-of Bull of Phalaris. No doubt, despite all
that has been said, it is idle to pretend that this is an agreeable

in the Sage there is something else as well, The Self-Gathered which, as
long as it holds itself by main force within itself, can never be robbed
of the vision of the All-Good.
