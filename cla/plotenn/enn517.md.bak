#### Section 11

11\. But if these considerations are sound, why has Quality more than
one species? What is the ground for distinguishing between habit and
disposition, seeing that no differentia of Quality is involved in
permanence and non-permanence? A disposition of any kind is sufficient
to constitute a quality; permanence is a mere external addition. It
might however be urged that dispositions are but incomplete "forms"- if
the term may pass- habits being complete ones. But incomplete, they are
not qualities; if already qualities, the permanence is an external
addition.

How do physical powers form a distinct species? If they are classed as
qualities in virtue of being powers, power, we have seen, is not a
necessary concomitant of qualities. If, however, we hold that the
natural boxer owes his quality to a particular disposition, power is
something added and does not contribute to the quality, since power is
found in habits also.

Another point: why is natural ability to be distinguished from that
acquired by learning? Surely, if both are qualities, they cannot be
differentiae of Quality: gained by practice or given in nature, it is
the same ability; the differentia will be external to Quality; it cannot
be deduced from the Ideal Form of boxing. Whether some qualities as
distinguished from others are derived from experience is immaterial; the
source of the quality makes no difference- none, I mean, pointing to
variations and differences of Quality.

A further question would seem to be involved: If certain qualities are
derived from experience but here is a discrepancy in the manner and
source of the experience, how are they to be included in the same
species? And again, if some create the experience, others are created by
it, the term Quality as applied to both classes will be equivocal.

And what part is played by the individual form? If it constitutes the
individual's specific character, it is not a quality; if, however, it is
what makes an object beautiful or ugly after the specific form has been
determined, then it involves a Reason-Principle.

Rough and smooth, tenuous and dense may rightly be classed as qualities.
It is true that they are not determined by distances and approximations,
or in general by even or uneven dispositions, of parts; though, were
they so determined, they might well even then be qualities.

Knowledge of the meaning of "light" and "heavy" will reveal their place
in the classification. An ambiguity will however be latent in the term
"light," unless it be determined by comparative weight: it would then
implicate leanness and fineness, and involve another species distinct
from the four \[of Aristotle\].
