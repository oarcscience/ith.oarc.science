#### Section 2

2\. But the Universe outside; how is it aligned towards the Good?

The soulless by direction toward Soul: Soul towards the Good itself,
through the Intellectual-Principle.

Everything has something of the Good, by virtue of possessing a certain
degree of unity and a certain degree of Existence and by participation
in Ideal-Form: to the extent of the Unity, Being, and Form which are
present, there is a sharing in an image, for the Unity and Existence in
which there is participation are no more than images of the Ideal-Form.

With Soul it is different; the First-Soul, that which follows upon the
Intellectual-Principle, possesses a life nearer to the Verity and
through that Principle is of the nature of good; it will actually
possess the Good if it orientate itself towards the
Intellectual-Principle, since this follows immediately upon the Good.

In sum, then, life is the Good to the living, and the
Intellectual-Principle to what is intellective; so that where there is
life with intellection there is a double contact with the Good.
