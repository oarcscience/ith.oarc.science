#### Section 1

1\. We have now explained our conception of Reality \[True Being\] and
considered how far it agrees with the teaching of Plato. We have still
to investigate the opposed principle \[the principle of Becoming\].

There is the possibility that the genera posited for the Intellectual
sphere will suffice for the lower also; possibly with these genera
others will be required; again, the two series may differ entirely; or
perhaps some of the sensible genera will be identical with their
intellectual prototypes, and others different- "identical," however,
being understood to mean only analogous and in possession of a common
name, as our results will make dear.

We must begin on these lines:

The subject of our discussion is the Sensible realm: Sensible Existence
is entirely embraced by what we know as the Universe: our duty, then,
would seem to be clear enough- to take this Universe and analyse its
nature, classifying its constituent parts and arranging them by species.
Suppose that we were making a division of speech: we should reduce its
infinity to finite terms, and from the identity appearing in many
instances evolve a unity, then another and another, until we arrived at
some definite number; each such unit we should call a species if imposed
upon individuals, a genus if imposed upon species. Thus, every species
of speech- and similarly all phenomena- might be referred to a unity;
speech- or element- might be predicated of them all.

This procedure however is as we have already shown, impossible in
dealing with the subject of our present enquiry. New genera must be
sought for this Universe-genera distinct from those of the Intellectual,
inasmuch as this realm is different from that, analogous indeed but
never identical, a mere image of the higher. True, it involves the
parallel existence of Body and Soul, for the Universe is a living form:
essentially however Soul is of the Intellectual and does not enter into
the structure of what is called Sensible Being.

Remembering this fact, we must- however great the difficulty- exclude
Soul from the present investigation, just as in a census of citizens,
taken in the interests of commerce and taxation, we should ignore the
alien population. As for the experiences to which Soul is indirectly
subject in its conjunction with Body and by reason of Body's presence,
their classification must be attempted at a later stage, when we enquire
into the details of Sensible Existence.
