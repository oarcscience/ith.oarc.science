<P>1. That the Soul of every individual is one thing we deduce from
the fact that it is present entire at every point of the body- the
sign of veritable unity- not some part of it here and another part
there. In all sensitive beings the sensitive soul is an omnipresent
unity, and so in the forms of vegetal life the vegetal soul is
entire at each several point throughout the organism.

<P>Now are we to hold similarly that your soul and mine and all are
one, and that the same thing is true of the universe, the soul in
all the several forms of life being one soul, not parcelled out in
separate items, but an omnipresent identity?

<P>If the soul in me is a unity, why need that in the universe be
otherwise seeing that there is no longer any question of 
bulk or body?
And if that, too, is one soul and yours, and mine, belongs 
to it, then
yours and mine must also be one: and if, again, the soul of the
universe and mine depend from one soul, once more all must be one.

<P>What then in itself is this one soul?

<P>First we must assure ourselves of the possibility of all souls
being one as that of any given individual is.

<P>It must, no doubt, seem strange that my soul and that of any and
everybody else should be one thing only: it might mean my feelings
being felt by someone else, my goodness another's too, my desire,
his desire, all our experience shared with each other and with the
(one-souled) universe, so that the very universe itself would feel
whatever I felt.

<P>Besides how are we to reconcile this unity with the 
distinction of
reasoning soul and unreasoning, animal soul and vegetal?

<P>Yet if we reject that unity, the universe itself ceases to be
one thing and souls can no longer be included under any one 
principle.
