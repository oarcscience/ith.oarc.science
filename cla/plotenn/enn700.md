#### Section 19

19\. Stirred to the Supreme by what has been told, a man must strive to
possess it directly; then he too will see, though still unable to tell
it as he would wish.

One seeing That as it really is will lay aside all reasoning upon it and
simply state it as the self-existent; such that if it had essence that
essence would be subject to it and, so to speak, derived from it; none
that has seen would dare to talk of its "happening to be," or indeed be
able to utter word. With all his courage he would stand astounded,
unable at any venture to speak of This, with the vision everywhere
before the eyes of the soul so that, look where one may, there it is
seen unless one deliberately look away, ignoring God, thinking no more
upon Him. So we are to understand the Beyond-Essence darkly indicated by
the ancients: is not merely that He generated Essence but that He is
subject neither to Essence nor to Himself; His essence is not His
Principle; He is Principle to Essence and not for Himself did He make
it; producing it He left it outside of Himself: He had no need of being
who brought it to be. Thus His making of being is no "action in
accordance with His being."
