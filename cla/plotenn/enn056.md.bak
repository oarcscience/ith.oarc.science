#### Section 7

7\. But if we are to consider only the present and may not call in the
past to make the total, why do we not reckon so in the case of time
itself, where, in fact, we do not hesitate to add the past to the
present and call the total greater? Why not suppose a quantity of
happiness equivalent to a quantity of time? This would be no more than
taking it lap by lap to correspond with time-laps instead of choosing to
consider it as an indivisible, measurable only by the content of a given
instant.

There is no absurdity in taking count of time which has ceased to be: we
are merely counting what is past and finished, as we might count the
dead: but to treat past happiness as actually existent and as
outweighing present happiness, that is an absurdity. For Happiness must
be an achieved and existent state, whereas any time over and apart from
the present is nonexistent: all progress of time means the extinction of
all the time that has been.

Hence time is aptly described as a mimic of eternity that seeks to break
up in its fragmentary flight the permanence of its exemplar. Thus
whatever time seizes and seals to itself of what stands permanent in
eternity is annihilated- saved only in so far as in some degree it still
belongs to eternity, but wholly destroyed if it be unreservedly absorbed
into time.

If Happiness demands the possession of the good of life, it clearly has
to do with the life of Authentic-Existence for that life is the Best.
Now the life of Authentic-Existence is measurable not by time but by
eternity; and eternity is not a more or a less or a thing of any
magnitude but is the unchangeable, the indivisible, is timeless Being.

We must not muddle together Being and Non-Being, time and eternity, not
even everlasting time with the eternal; we cannot make laps and stages
of an absolute unity; all must be taken together, wheresoever and
howsoever we handle it; and it must be taken at that, not even as an
undivided block of time but as the Life of Eternity, a stretch not made
up of periods but completely rounded, outside of all notion of time.
