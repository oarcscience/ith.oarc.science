<P>8. But what are we to understand by this Zeus with the 
garden into
which, we are told, Poros or Wealth entered? And what is the garden?

<P>We have seen that the Aphrodite of the Myth is the Soul and that
Poros, Wealth, is the Reason-Principle of the Universe: we have
still to explain Zeus and his garden.

<P>We cannot take Zeus to be the Soul, which we have agreed is
represented by Aphrodite.

<P>Plato, who must be our guide in this question, speaks in the
Phaedrus of this God, Zeus, as the Great Leader- though elsewhere he
seems to rank him as one of three- but in the Philebus he speaks
more plainly when he says that there is in Zeus not only a 
royal Soul,
but also a royal Intellect.

<P>As a mighty Intellect and Soul, he must be a principle of Cause;
he must be the highest for several reasons but especially because to
be King and Leader is to be the chief cause: Zeus then is the
Intellectual Principle. Aphrodite, his daughter, issue of him,
dwelling with him, will be Soul, her very name Aphrodite [= 
the habra,
delicate] indicating the beauty and gleam and innocence and delicate
grace of the Soul.

<P>And if we take the male gods to represent the Intellectual
Powers and the female gods to be their souls- to every Intellectual
Principle its companion Soul- we are forced, thus also, to make
Aphrodite the Soul of Zeus; and the identification is confirmed by
Priests and Theologians who consider Aphrodite and Hera one and the
same and call Aphrodite's star the star of Hera.
