#### Section 3

3\. We have thus covered our main ground, but since corporeity has been
mentioned, we must consider its nature: is it the conjunction of all the
qualities or is it an Idea, or Reason-Principle, whose presence in
Matter constitutes a body?

Now if body is the compound, the thing made up of all the required
qualities plus Matter, then corporeity is nothing more than their
conjunction.

And if it is a Reason-Principle, one whose incoming constitutes the
body, then clearly this Principle contains embraced within itself all
the qualities. If this Reason-Principle is to be no mere principle of
definition exhibiting the nature of a thing but a veritable Reason
constituting the thing, then it cannot itself contain Matter but must
encircle Matter, and by being present to Matter elaborate the body: thus
the body will be Matter associated with an indwelling Reason-Principle
which will be in itself immaterial, pure Idea, even though irremoveably
attached to the body. It is not to be confounded with that other
Principle in man- treated elsewhere- which dwells in the Intellectual
World by right of being itself an Intellectual Principle.
