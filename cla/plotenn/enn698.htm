<P>17. Or consider it another way: We hold the universe, with its
content entire, to be as all would be if the design of the maker had
so willed it, elaborating it with purpose and prevision by
reasonings amounting to a Providence. All is always so and all is
always so reproduced: therefore the reason-principles of things must
lie always within the producing powers in a still more perfect form;
these beings of the divine realm must therefore be previous to
Providence and to preference; all that exists in the order of being
must lie for ever There in their Intellectual mode. If this regime
is to be called Providence it must be in the sense that before our
universe there exists, not expressed in the outer, the
Intellectual-Principle of all the All, its source and archetype.

<P>Now if there is thus an Intellectual-Principle before all
things, their founding principle, this cannot be a thing 
lying subject
to chance- multiple, no doubt, but a concordance, ordered so to
speak into oneness. Such a multiple- the co-ordination of all
particulars and consisting of all the Reason-Principles of the
universe gathered into the closest union- this cannot be a thing of
chance, a thing "happening so to be." It must be of a very different
nature, of the very contrary nature, separated from the other by all
the difference between reason and reasonless chance. And if 
the Source
is precedent even to this, it must be continuous with this reasoned
secondary so that the two be correspondent; the secondary must
participate in the prior, be an expression of its will, be a power
of it: that higher therefore [as above the ordering of reason] is
without part or interval [implied by reasoned arrangement], is a
one- all Reason-Principle, one number, a One greater than 
its product,
more powerful, having no higher or better. Thus the Supreme 
can derive
neither its being nor the quality of its being. God Himself,
therefore, is what He is, self-related, self-tending; otherwise He
becomes outward-tending, other-seeking- who cannot but be wholly
self-poised.
