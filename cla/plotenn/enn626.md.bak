#### Section 7

7\. It is inevitably necessary to think of all as contained within one
nature; one nature must hold and encompass all; there cannot be as in
the realm of sense thing apart from thing, here a sun and elsewhere
something else; all must be mutually present within a unity. This is the
very nature of the Intellectual-Principle as we may know from soul which
reproduces it and from what we call Nature under which and by which the
things of process are brought into their disjointed being while that
Nature itself remains indissolubly one.

But within the unity There, the several entities have each its own
distinct existence; the all-embracing Intellect sees what is in it, what
is within Being; it need not look out upon them since it contains them,
need not separate them since they stand for ever distinct within it.

Against doubters we cite the fact of participation; the greatness and
beauty of the Intellectual-Principle we know by the soul's longing
towards it; the longing of the rest towards soul is set up by its
likeness to its higher and to the possibility open to them of attaining
resemblance through it.

It is surely inconceivable that any living thing be beautiful failing a
Life-Absolute of a wonderful, an ineffable, beauty: this must be the
Collective Life, made up of all living things, or embracing all, forming
a unity coextensive with all, as our universe is a unity embracing all
the visible.
