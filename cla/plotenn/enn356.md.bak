#### Section 37

37\. We must not rob the universe of any factor in its being. If any of
our theorists of to-day seek to explain the action of fire- or of any
other such form, thought of as an agent- they will find themselves in
difficulties unless they recognize the act to be the object's function
in the All, and give a like explanation of other natural forces in
common use.

We do not habitually examine or in any way question the normal: we set
to doubting and working out identifications when we are confronted by
any display of power outside everyday experience: we wonder at a novelty
and we wonder at the customary when anyone brings forward some single
object and explains to our ignorance the efficacy vested in it.

Some such power, not necessarily accompanied by reason, every single
item possesses; for each has been brought into being and into shape
within a universe; each in its kind has partaken of soul through the
medium of the ensouled All, as being embraced by that definitely
constituted thing: each then is a member of an animate being which can
include nothing that is less than a full member \[and therefore a sharer
in the total of power\]- though one thing is of mightier efficacy than
another, and, especially members of the heavenly system than the objects
of earth, since they draw upon a purer nature- and these powers are
widely productive. But productivity does not comport intention in what
appears to be the source of the thing accomplished: there is efficacy,
too, where there is no will: even attention is not necessary to the
communication of power; the very transmission of soul may proceed
without either.

A living being, we know, may spring from another without any intention,
and as without loss so without consciousness in the begetter: in fact
any intention the animal exercised could be a cause of propagation only
on condition of being identical with the animal \[i.e., the theory would
make intention a propagative animal, not a mental act?\]

And, if intention is unnecessary to the propagation of life, much more
so is attention.
