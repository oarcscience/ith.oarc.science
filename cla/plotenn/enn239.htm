<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 8</H4>

<P>8. It is a general principle that, to be modified, an object
must be opposed in faculty, and in quality to the forces that enter
and act upon it.

<P>Thus where heat is present, the change comes by something that
chills, where damp by some drying agency: we say a subject 
is modified
when from warm it becomes cold, from dry wet.

<P>A further evidence is in our speaking of a fire being burned
out, when it has passed over into another element; we do not say
that the Matter has been burned out: in other words, modification
affects what is subject to dissolution; the acceptance of 
modification
is the path towards dissolution; susceptibility to modification and
susceptibility to dissolution go necessarily together. But Matter
can never be dissolved. What into? By what process?

<P>Still: Matter harbours heat, cold, qualities beyond all count;
by these it is differentiated; it holds them as if they were of its
very substance and they blend within it- since no quality is found
isolated to itself- Matter lies there as the meeting ground of all
these qualities with their changes as they act and react in 
the blend:
how, then, can it fail to be modified in keeping? The only escape
would be to declare Matter utterly and for ever apart from the
qualities it exhibits; but the very notion of Substance implies that
any and every thing present in it has some action upon it.
