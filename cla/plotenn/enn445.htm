<P>14. How, then, do we ourselves come to be speaking of it?

<P>No doubt we deal with it, but we do not state it; we have
neither knowledge nor intellection of it.

<P>But in what sense do we even deal with it when we have no hold
upon it?

<P>We do not, it is true, grasp it by knowledge, but that does not
mean that we are utterly void of it; we hold it not so as to 
state it,
but so as to be able to speak about it. And we can and do state what
it is not, while we are silent as to what it is: we are, in fact,
speaking of it in the light of its sequels; unable to state 
it, we may
still possess it.

<P>Those divinely possessed and inspired have at least the
knowledge that they hold some greater thing within them though they
cannot tell what it is; from the movements that stir them and the
utterances that come from them they perceive the power, not
themselves, that moves them: in the same way, it must be, we stand
towards the Supreme when we hold the Intellectual-Principle pure; we
know the divine Mind within, that which gives Being and all else of
that order: but we know, too, that other, know that it is none of
these, but a nobler principle than any-thing we know as Being;
fuller and greater; above reason, mind and feeling; conferring these
powers, not to be confounded with them.
