<P>34. For ourselves, while whatever in us belongs to the 
body of the
All should be yielded to its action, we ought to make sure that we
submit only within limits, realizing that the entire man is not thus
bound to it: intelligent servitors yield a part of 
themselves to their
masters but in part retain their personality, and are thus less
absolutely at beck and call, as not being slaves, not utterly
chattels.

<P>The changing configurations within the All could not fail to be
produced as they are, since the moving bodies are not of equal speed.

<P>Now the movement is guided by a Reason-Principle; the 
relations of
the living whole are altered in consequence; here in our own 
realm all
that happens reacts in sympathy to the events of that higher sphere:
it becomes, therefore, advisable to ask whether we are to think of
this realm as following upon the higher by agreement, or to
attribute to the configurations the powers underlying the events,
and whether such powers would be vested in the configurations simply
or in the relations of the particular items.

<P>It will be said that one position of one given thing has by no
means an identical effect- whether of indication or of causation- in
its relation to another and still less to any group of others, since
each several being seems to have a natural tendency [or receptivity]
of its own.

<P>The truth is that the configuration of any given group means
merely the relationship of the several parts, and, changing the
members, the relationship remains the same.

<P>But, this being so, the power will belong, not to the positions
but to the beings holding those positions?

<P>To both taken together. For as things change their relations,
and as any one thing changes place, there is a change of power.

<P>But what power? That of causation or of indication?

<P>To this double thing- the particular configuration of particular
beings- there accrues often the twofold power, that of causation and
that of indication, but sometimes only that of indication. 
Thus we are
obliged to attribute powers both to the configuration and to the
beings entering into them. In mime dancers each of the hands has its
own power, and so with all the limbs; the relative positions 
have much
power; and, for a third power, there is that of the accessories and
concomitants; underlying the action of the performers' limbs, there
are such items as the clutched fingers and the muscles and veins
following suit.
