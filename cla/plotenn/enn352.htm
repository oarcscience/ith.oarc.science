<P>33. The Circuit does not go by chance but under the
Reason-Principle of the living whole; therefore there must be a
harmony between cause and caused; there must be some order ranging
things to each other's purpose, or in due relation to each other:
every several configuration within the Circuit must be accompanied
by a change in the position and condition of things 
subordinate to it,
which thus by their varied rhythmic movement make up one total
dance-play.

<P>In our dance-plays there are outside elements contributing to
the total effect- fluting, singing, and other linked accessories-
and each of these changes in each new movement: there is no need to
dwell on these; their significance is obvious. But besides this
there is the fact that the limbs of the dancer cannot possibly keep
the same positions in every figure; they adapt themselves to 
the plan,
bending as it dictates, one lowered, another raised, one active,
another resting as the set pattern changes. The dancer's mind is on
his own purpose; his limbs are submissive to the dance-movement
which they accomplish to the end, so that the connoisseur can
explain that this or that figure is the motive for the lifting,
bending, concealment, effacing, of the various members of the body;
and in all this the executant does not choose the particular motions
for their own sake; the whole play of the entire person dictates the
necessary position to each limb and member as it serves to the plan.

<P>Now this is the mode in which the heavenly beings [the diviner
members of the All] must be held to be causes wherever they have any
action, and, when. they do not act, to indicate.

<P>Or, a better statement: the entire kosmos puts its entire life
into act, moving its major members with its own action and 
unceasingly
setting them in new positions; by the relations thus established, of
these members to each other and to the whole, and by the different
figures they make together, the minor members in turn are brought
under the system as in the movements of some one living 
being, so that
they vary according to the relations, positions, configurations: the
beings thus co-ordinated are not the causes; the cause is the
coordinating All; at the same time it is not to be thought of as
seeking to do one thing and actually doing another, for there is
nothing external to it since it is the cause by actually 
being all: on
the one side the configurations, on the other the inevitable effects
of those configurations upon a living being moving as a unit and,
again, upon a living being [an All] thus by its nature conjoined and
concomitant and, of necessity, at once subject and object to its own
activities.
