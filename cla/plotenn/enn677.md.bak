#### Section 39

39\. Since the Supreme has no interval, no self-differentiation what can
have this intuitional approach to it but itself? Therefore it quite
naturally assumes difference at the point where Intellectual-Principle
and Being are differentiated.

Intellect, to act at all, must inevitably comport difference with
identity; otherwise it could not distinguish itself from its object by
standing apart from it, nor could it ever be aware of the realm of
things whose existence demands otherness, nor could there be so much as
a duality.

Again, if the Supreme is to have intellection it cannot know only
itself; that would not be intellection, for, if it did know itself,
nothing could prevent it knowing all things; but this is impossible.
With self-intellection it would no longer be simplex; any intellection,
even in the Supreme, must be aware of something distinct; as we have
been saying, the inability to see the self as external is the negation
of intellection. That act requires a manifold-agent, object, movement
and all the other conditions of a thinking principle. Further we must
remember what has been indicated elsewhere that, since every
intellectual act in order to be what it must be requires variety, every
movement simple and the same throughout, though it may comport some form
of contact, is devoid of the intellective.

It follows that the Supreme will know neither itself nor anything else
but will hold an august repose. All the rest is later; before them all,
This was what This was; any awareness of that other would be acquired,
the shifting knowledge of the instable. Even in knowing the stable he
would be manifold, for it is not possible that, while in the act of
knowing the laters possess themselves of their object, the Supreme
should know only in some unpossessing observation.

As regards Providence, that is sufficiently saved by the fact that This
is the source from which all proceeds; the dependent he cannot know when
he has no knowledge of himself but keeps that august repose. Plato
dealing with essential Being allows it intellection but not this august
repose: intellection then belongs to Essential Being; this august repose
to the Principle in which there is no intellection. Repose, of course,
is used here for want of a fitter word; we are to understand that the
most august, the truly so, is That which transcends \[the movement of\]
Intellection.
