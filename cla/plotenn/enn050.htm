<P>1. Is it possible to think that Happiness increases with Time,
Happiness which is always taken as a present thing?

<P>The memory of former felicity may surely be ruled out of count,
for Happiness is not a thing of words, but a definite condition
which must be actually present like the very fact and act of life.
