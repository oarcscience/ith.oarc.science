<P>4. But, soul reached, why need we look higher; why not make this
The First?

<P>A main reason is that the Intellectual-Principle is at once
something other and something more powerful than Soul and that the
more powerful is in the nature of things the prior. For it is
certainly not true, as people imagine, that the soul, brought to
perfection, produces Intellect. How could that potentiality come to
actuality unless there be, first, an effective principle to 
induce the
actualization which, left to chance, might never occur?

<P>The Firsts must be supposed to exist in actuality, looking to
nothing else, self-complete. Anything incomplete must be sequent
upon these, and take its completion from the principles 
engendering it
which, like fathers, labour in the improvement of an offspring born
imperfect: the produced is a Matter to the producing principle and
is worked over by it into a shapely perfection.

<P>And if, further, soul is passible while something 
impassible there
must be or by the mere passage of time all wears away, here 
too we are
led to something above soul.

<P>Again there must be something prior to Soul because Soul 
is in the
world and there must be something outside a world in which, all
being corporeal and material, nothing has enduring reality: failing
such a prior, neither man nor the Ideas would be eternal or have
true identity.

<P>These and many other considerations establish the necessary
existence of an Intellectual-Principle prior to Soul.
