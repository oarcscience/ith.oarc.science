#### Section 36

36\. We need not carry this matter further; we turn to a question
already touched but demanding still some brief consideration.

Knowledge of The Good or contact with it, is the all-important: this- we
read- is the grand learning, the learning we are to understand, not of
looking towards it but attaining, first, some knowledge of it. We come
to this learning by analogies, by abstractions, by our understanding of
its subsequents, of all that is derived from The Good, by the upward
steps towards it. Purification has The Good for goal; so the virtues,
all right ordering, ascent within the Intellectual, settlement therein,
banqueting upon the divine- by these methods one becomes, to self and to
all else, at once seen and seer; identical with Being and
Intellectual-Principle and the entire living all, we no longer see the
Supreme as an external; we are near now, the next is That and it is
close at hand, radiant above the Intellectual.

Here, we put aside all the learning; disciplined to this pitch,
established in beauty, the quester holds knowledge still of the ground
he rests on but, suddenly, swept beyond it all by the very crest of the
wave of Intellect surging beneath, he is lifted and sees, never knowing
how; the vision floods the eyes with light, but it is not a light
showing some other object, the light is itself the vision. No longer is
there thing seen and light to show it, no longer Intellect and object of
Intellection; this is the very radiance that brought both Intellect and
Intellectual object into being for the later use and allowed them to
occupy the quester's mind. With This he himself becomes identical, with
that radiance whose Act is to engender Intellectual-Principle, not
losing in that engendering but for ever unchanged, the engendered coming
to be simply because that Supreme exists. If there were no such
principle above change, no derivative could rise.
