<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 1</H4>

<P>1. Can there be question as to whether the gods have voluntary
action? Or are we to take it that, while we may well enquire in the
case of men with their combination of powerlessness and hesitating
power, the gods must be declared omnipotent, not merely some things
but all lying at their nod? Or is power entire, freedom of action in
all things, to be reserved to one alone, of the rest some being
powerful, others powerless, others again a blend of power and
impotence?

<P>All this must come to the test: we must dare it even of 
the Firsts
and of the All-Transcendent and, if we find omnipotence 
possible, work
out how far freedom extends. The very notion of power must be
scrutinized lest in this ascription we be really making power
identical with Essential Act, and even with Act not yet achieved.

<P>But for the moment we may pass over these questions to deal with
the traditional problem of freedom of action in ourselves.

<P>To begin with, what must be intended when we assert that 
something
is in our power; what is the conception here?

<P>To establish this will help to show whether we are to ascribe
freedom to the gods and still more to God, or to refuse it, or
again, while asserting it, to question still, in regard both to the
higher and lower- the mode of its presence.

<P>What then do we mean when we speak of freedom in 
ourselves and why
do we question it?

<P>My own reading is that, moving as we do amid adverse fortunes,
compulsions, violent assaults of passion crushing the soul, feeling
ourselves mastered by these experiences, playing slave to them,
going where they lead, we have been brought by all this to doubt
whether we are anything at all and dispose of ourselves in any
particular.

<P>This would indicate that we think of our free act as one which
we execute of our own choice, in no servitude to chance or necessity
or overmastering passion, nothing thwarting our will; the 
voluntary is
conceived as an event amenable to will and occurring or not as our
will dictates. Everything will be voluntary that is produced under
no compulsion and with knowledge; our free act is what we are
masters to perform.

<P>Differing conceptually, the two conditions will often 
coincide but
sometimes will clash. Thus a man would be master to kill, but the
act will not be voluntary if in the victim he had failed to
recognise his own father. Perhaps however that ignorance is not
compatible with real freedom: for the knowledge necessary to a
voluntary act cannot be limited to certain particulars but must
cover the entire field. Why, for example, should killing be
involuntary in the failure to recognise a father and not so in the
failure to recognise the wickedness of murder? If because the killer
ought to have learned, still ignorance of the duty of 
learning and the
cause of that ignorance remain alike involuntary.
