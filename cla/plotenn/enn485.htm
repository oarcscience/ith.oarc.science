<P>8. This then is Beauty primally: it is entire and omnipresent as
an entirety; and therefore in none of its parts or members lacking
in beauty; beautiful thus beyond denial. Certainly it cannot be
anything [be, for example, Beauty] without being wholly that 
thing; it
can be nothing which it is to possess partially or in which 
it utterly
fails [and therefore it must entirely be Beauty entire].

<P>If this principle were not beautiful, what other could be? Its
prior does not deign to be beautiful; that which is the first to
manifest itself- Form and object of vision to the intellect- cannot
but be lovely to see. It is to indicate this that Plato, drawing on
something well within our observation, represents the Creator as
approving the work he has achieved: the intention is to make us feel
the lovable beauty of the autotype and of the Divine Idea; for to
admire a representation is to admire the original upon which it was
made.

<P>It is not surprising if we fail to  recognise what is passing
within us: lovers, and those in general that admire beauty here, do
not stay to reflect that it is to be traced, as of course it must
be, to the Beauty There. That the admiration of the Demiurge is to
be referred to the Ideal Exemplar is deliberately made evident by
the rest of the passage: "He admired; and determined to 
bring the work
into still closer likeness with the Exemplar": he makes us feel the
magnificent beauty of the Exemplar by telling us that the Beauty
sprung from this world is, itself, a copy from That.

<P>And indeed if the divine did not exist, the transcendently
beautiful, in a beauty beyond all thought, what could be 
lovelier than
the things we see? Certainly no reproach can rightly be brought
against this world save only that it is not That.
