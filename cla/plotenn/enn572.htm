<P>12. It follows that we must allow contrariety to Quantity:
whenever we speak of great and small, our notions acknowledge this
contrariety by evolving opposite images, as also when we 
refer to many
and few; indeed, "few" and "many" call for similar treatment to
"small" and "great."

<P>"Many," predicated of the inhabitants of a house, does duty for
"more": "few" people are said to be in the theatre instead of "less."

<P>"Many," again, necessarily involves a large numerical plurality.
This plurality can scarcely be a relative; it is simply an expansion
of number, its contrary being a contraction.

<P>The same applies to the continuous [magnitude], the notion of
which entails prolongation to a distant point.

<P>Quantity, then, appears whenever there is a progression from the
unit or the point: if either progression comes to a rapid halt, we
have respectively "few" and "small"; if it goes forward and does not
quickly cease, "many" and "great."

<P>What, we may be asked, is the limit of this progression? What,
we retort, is the limit of beauty, or of heat? Whatever limit you
impose, there is always a "hotter"; yet "hotter" is accounted a
relative, "hot" a pure quality.

<P>In sum, just as there is a Reason-Principle of Beauty, so there
must be a Reason-Principle of greatness, participation in which
makes a thing great, as the Principle of beauty makes it beautiful.

<P>To judge from these instances, there is contrariety in Quantity.
Place we may neglect as not strictly coming under the category of
Quantity; if it were admitted, "above" could only be a contrary if
there were something in the universe which was "below": as referring
to the partial, the terms "above" and "below" are used in a purely
relative sense, and must go with "right" and "left" into the
category of Relation.

<P>Syllable and discourse are only indirectly quantities or
substrates of Quantity; it is voice that is quantitative: 
but voice is
a kind of Motion; it must accordingly in any case [quantity or no
quantity] be referred to Motion, as must activity also.
