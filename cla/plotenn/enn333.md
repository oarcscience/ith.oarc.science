#### Section 14

14\. Of the corporeal thus brought into being by Nature the elemental
materials of things are its very produce, but how do animal and
vegetable forms stand to it?

Are we to think of them as containers of Nature present within them?

Light goes away and the air contains no trace of it, for light and air
remain each itself, never coalescing: is this the relation of Nature to
the formed object?

It is rather that existing between fire and the object it has warmed:
the fire withdrawn, there remains a certain warmth, distinct from that
in the fire, a property, so to speak, of the object warmed. For the
shape which Nature imparts to what it has moulded must be recognized as
a form quite distinct from Nature itself, though it remains a question
to be examined whether besides this \[specific\] form there is also an
intermediary, a link connecting it with Nature, the general principle.

The difference between Nature and the Wisdom described as dwelling in
the All has been sufficiently dealt with.
