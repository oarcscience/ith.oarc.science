#### Section 6

6\. But how and what does the Intellectual-Principle see and,
especially, how has it sprung from that which is to become the object of
its vision?

The mind demands the existence of these Beings, but it is still in
trouble over the problem endlessly debated by the most ancient
philosophers: from such a unity as we have declared The One to be, how
does anything at all come into substantial existence, any multiplicity,
dyad, or number? Why has the Primal not remained self-gathered so that
there be none of this profusion of the manifold which we observe in
existence and yet are compelled to trace to that absolute unity?

In venturing an answer, we first invoke God Himself, not in loud word
but in that way of prayer which is always within our power, leaning in
soul towards Him by aspiration, alone towards the alone. But if we seek
the vision of that great Being within the Inner Sanctuary-
self-gathered, tranquilly remote above all else- we begin by considering
the images stationed at the outer precincts, or, more exactly to the
moment, the first image that appears. How the Divine Mind comes into
being must be explained:

Everything moving has necessarily an object towards which it advances;
but since the Supreme can have no such object, we may not ascribe motion
to it: anything that comes into being after it can be produced only as a
consequence of its unfailing self-intention; and, of course, we dare not
talk of generation in time, dealing as we are with eternal Beings: where
we speak of origin in such reference, it is in the sense, merely, of
cause and subordination: origin from the Supreme must not be taken to
imply any movement in it: that would make the Being resulting from the
movement not a second principle but a third: the Movement would be the
second hypostasis.

Given this immobility in the Supreme, it can neither have yielded assent
nor uttered decree nor stirred in any way towards the existence of a
secondary.

What happened then? What are we to conceive as rising in the
neighbourhood of that immobility?

It must be a circumradiation- produced from the Supreme but from the
Supreme unaltering- and may be compared to the brilliant light
encircling the sun and ceaselessly generated from that unchanging
substance.

All existences, as long as they retain their character, produce- about
themselves, from their essence, in virtue of the power which must be in
them- some necessary, outward-facing hypostasis continuously attached to
them and representing in image the engendering archetypes: thus fire
gives out its heat; snow is cold not merely to itself; fragrant
substances are a notable instance; for, as long as they last, something
is diffused from them and perceived wherever they are present.

Again, all that is fully achieved engenders: therefore the eternally
achieved engenders eternally an eternal being. At the same time, the
offspring is always minor: what then are we to think of the All-Perfect
but that it can produce nothing less than the very greatest that is
later than itself. The greatest, later than the divine unity, must be
the Divine Mind, and it must be the second of all existence, for it is
that which sees The One on which alone it leans while the First has no
need whatever of it. The offspring of the prior to Divine Mind can be no
other than that Mind itself and thus is the loftiest being in the
universe, all else following upon it- the soul, for example, being an
utterance and act of the Intellectual-Principle as that is an utterance
and act of The One. But in soul the utterance is obscured, for soul is
an image and must look to its own original: that Principle, on the
contrary, looks to the First without mediation- thus becoming what it
is- and has that vision not as from a distance but as the immediate next
with nothing intervening, close to the One as Soul to it.

The offspring must seek and love the begetter; and especially so when
begetter and begotten are alone in their sphere; when, in addition, the
begetter is the highest good, the offspring \[inevitably seeking its
Good\] is attached by a bond of sheer necessity, separated only in being
distinct.
