#### Section 8

8\. It may be urged that the actual presence of past experiences, kept
present by Memory, gives the advantage to the man of the longer
felicity.

But, Memory of what sort of experiences?

Memory either of formerly attained wisdom and virtue- in which case we
have a better man and the argument from memory is given up- or memory of
past pleasures, as if the man that has arrived at felicity must roam far
and wide in search of gratifications and is not contented by the bliss
actually within him.

And what is there pleasant in the memory of pleasure? What is it to
recall yesterday's excellent dinner? Still more ridiculous, one of ten
years ago. So, too, of last year's morality.
