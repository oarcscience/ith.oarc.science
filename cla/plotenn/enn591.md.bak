#### Section 2

2\. Side by side exist the Authentic All and its counterpart, the
visible universe. The Authentic is contained in nothing, since nothing
existed before it; of necessity anything coming after it must, as a
first condition of existence, be contained by this All, especially since
it depends upon the Authentic and without that could have neither
stability nor movement.

We may be reminded that the universe cannot be contained in the
Authentic as in a place, where place would mean the boundaries of some
surrounding extension considered as an envelope, or some space formerly
a part of the Void and still remaining unoccupied even after the
emergence of the universe, that it can only support itself, as it were,
upon the Authentic and rest in the embrace of its omnipresence; but this
objection is merely verbal and will disappear if our meaning is grasped;
we mention it for another purpose; it goes to enforce our real assertion
that the Authentic All, at once primal and veritable, needs no place and
is in no way contained. The All, as being an integral, cannot fall short
of itself; it must ever have fulfilled its own totality, ever reached to
its own equivalence; as far as the sum of entities extends, there this
is; for this is the All.

Inevitably, also, anything other than this All that may be stationed
therein must have part in the All, merge into it, and hold by its
strength; it is not that the thing detaches a portion of the All but
that within itself it finds the All which has entered into it while
still unbrokenly self-abiding, since Being cannot lodge in non-Being,
but, if anything, non-Being within Being.

Being, then, is present to all Being; an identity cannot tear itself
asunder; the omnipresence asserted of it must be presence within the
realm of Being; that is, it must be a self-presence. And it is in no way
strange that the omnipresence should be at once self-abiding and
universal; this is merely saying omnipresence within a unity.

It is our way to limit Being to the sense-known and therefore to think
of omnipresence in terms of the concrete; in our overestimate of the
sensible, we question how that other Nature can reach over such
vastness; but our great is small, and this, small to us, is great; it
reaches integrally to every point of our universe- or, better, our
universe, moving from every side and in all its members towards this,
meets it everywhere as the omnipresent All ever stretching beyond.

The universe in all its reach can attain nothing further- that would
mean overpassing the total of Being- and therefore is content to circle
about it; not able to encompass or even to fill the All, it is content
to accept place and subordination, for thus it preserves itself in
neighbouring the higher present to it- present and yet absent;
self-holding, whatever may seek its presence.

Wherever the body of the universe may touch, there it finds this All; it
strives for no further advance, willing to revolve in that one circle,
since to it that is the All and in that movement its every part embraces
the All.

If that higher were itself in place there would be the need of seeking
that precise place by a certain right path; part of seeker must touch
part of sought, and there would be far and near. But since there is no
far and near there must be, if presence at all, presence entire. And
presence there indubitably is; this highest is present to every being of
those that, free of far and near, are of power to receive.
