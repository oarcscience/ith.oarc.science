#### Section 2

2\. By derivation from that Authentic Kosmos, one within itself, there
subsists this lower kosmos, no longer a true unity.

It is multiple, divided into various elements, thing standing apart from
thing in a new estrangement. No longer is there concord unbroken;
hostility, too, has entered as the result of difference and distance;
imperfection has inevitably introduced discord; for a part is not
self-sufficient, it must pursue something outside itself for its
fulfillment, and so it becomes the enemy to what it needs.

This Kosmos of parts has come into being not as the result of a
judgement establishing its desirability, but by the sheer necessity of a
secondary Kind.

The Intellectual Realm was not of a nature to be the ultimate of
existents. It was the First and it held great power, all there is of
power; this means that it is productive without seeking to produce; for
if effort and search were incumbent upon it, the Act would not be its
own, would not spring from its essential nature; it would be, like a
craftsman, producing by a power not inherent but acquired, mastered by
dint of study.

The Intellectual Principle, then, in its unperturbed serenity has
brought the universe into being, by communicating from its own store to
Matter: and this gift is the Reason-Form flowing from it. For the
Emanation of the Intellectual Principle is Reason, an emanation
unfailing as long as the Intellectual Principle continues to have place
among beings.

The Reason-Principle within a seed contains all the parts and qualities
concentrated in identity; there is no distinction, no jarring, no
internal hindering; then there comes a pushing out into bulk, part rises
in distinction with part, and at once the members of the organism stand
in each other's way and begin to wear each other down.

So from this, the One Intellectual Principle, and the Reason-Form
emanating from it, our Universe rises and develops part, and inevitably
are formed groups concordant and helpful in contrast with groups
discordant and combative; sometimes of choice and sometimes
incidentally, the parts maltreat each other; engendering proceeds by
destruction.

Yet: Amid all that they effect and accept, the divine Realm imposes the
one harmonious act; each utters its own voice, but all is brought into
accord, into an ordered system, for the universal purpose, by the ruling
Reason-Principle. This Universe is not Intelligence and Reason, like the
Supernal, but participant in Intelligence and Reason: it stands in need
of the harmonizing because it is the meeting ground of Necessity and
divine Reason-Necessity pulling towards the lower, towards the unreason
which is its own characteristic, while yet the Intellectual Principle
remains sovereign over it.

The Intellectual Sphere \[the Divine\] alone is Reason, and there can
never be another Sphere that is Reason and nothing else; so that, given
some other system, it cannot be as noble as that first; it cannot be
Reason: yet since such a system cannot be merely Matter, which is the
utterly unordered, it must be a mixed thing. Its two extremes are Matter
and the Divine Reason; its governing principle is Soul, presiding over
the conjunction of the two, and to be thought of not as labouring in the
task but as administering serenely by little more than an act of
presence.
