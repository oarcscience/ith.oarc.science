<P>4. But if this is the true account of the unity of soul, we must
be able to meet the problems that ensue: firstly, the difficulty of
one thing being present at the same moment in all things; and,
secondly, the difficulty of soul in body as against soul not 
embodied.

<P>We might be led to think that all soul must always inhabit body;
this would seem especially plausible in the case of the soul of the
universe, not thought of as ever leaving its body as the human soul
does: there exists, no doubt, an opinion that even the human soul,
while it must leave the body, cannot become an utterly disembodied
thing; but assuming its complete disembodiment, how comes it that
the human soul can go free of the body but the All-Soul not, though
they are one and the same?

<P>There is no such difficulty in the case of the
Intellectual-Principle; by the primal differentiation, this 
separates,
no doubt, into partial things of widely varying nature, but eternal
unity is secured by virtue of the eternal identity of that 
Essence: it
is not so easy to explain how, in the case of the soul described as
separate among bodies, such differentiated souls can remain 
one thing.

<P>A possible solution may be offered:

<P>The unit soul holds aloof, not actually falling into body; the
differentiated souls- the All-Soul, with the others- issue from the
unity while still constituting, within certain limits, an 
association.
They are one soul by the fact that they do not belong unreservedly
to any particular being; they meet, so to speak, fringe to fringe;
they strike out here and there, but are held together at the source
much as light is a divided thing upon earth, shining in this house,
and that, and yet remains uninterruptedly one identical substance.

<P>The All-Soul would always remain above, since essentially it has
nothing to do with descent or with the lower, or with any tendency
towards this sphere: the other souls would become ours [become
"partial," individual in us] because their lot is cast for this
sphere, and because they are solicited by a thing [the body] which
invites their care.

<P>The one- the lowest soul in the to the All-Soul- would correspond
to that in some great growth, silently, unlaboriously conducting the
whole; our own lowest soul might be compared to the insect life in
some rotted part of the growth- for this is the ratio of the animated
body to the universe- while the other soul in us, of one ideal nature
with the higher parts of the All-Soul, may be imaged as the gardener
concerned about the insects lodged in the tree and anxiously working
to amend what is wrong; or we may contrast a healthy man living with
the healthy and, by his thought or by his act, lending himself to the
service of those about him, with, on the other side, a sick 
man intent
upon his own care and cure, and so living for the body, body-bound.
