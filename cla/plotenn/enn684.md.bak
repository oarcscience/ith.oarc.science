#### Section 3

3\. All this calls for examination; the enquiry must bring us close to
the solution as regards the gods.

We have traced self-disposal to will, will to reasoning and, next step,
to right reasoning; perhaps to right reasoning we must add knowledge,
for however sound opinion and act may be they do not yield true freedom
when the adoption of the right course is the result of hazard or of some
presentment from the fancy with no knowledge of the foundations of that
rightness.

Taking it that the presentment of fancy is not a matter of our will and
choice, how can we think those acting at its dictation to be free
agents? Fancy strictly, in our use, takes it rise from conditions of the
body; lack of food and drink sets up presentments, and so does the
meeting of these needs; similarly with seminal abundance and other
humours of the body. We refuse to range under the principle of freedom
those whose conduct is directed by such fancy: the baser sort,
therefore, mainly so guided, cannot be credited with self-disposal or
voluntary act. Self-disposal, to us, belongs to those who, through the
activities of the Intellectual-Principle, live above the states of the
body. The spring of freedom is the activity of Intellectual-Principle,
the highest in our being; the proposals emanating thence are freedom;
such desires as are formed in the exercise of the Intellectual act
cannot be classed as involuntary; the gods, therefore, that live in this
state, living by Intellectual-Principle and by desire conformed to it,
possess freedom.
