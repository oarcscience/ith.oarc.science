<P>1. Beauty addresses itself chiefly to sight; but there 
is a beauty
for the hearing too, as in certain combinations of words and in all
kinds of music, for melodies and cadences are beautiful; and minds
that lift themselves above the realm of sense to a higher order are
aware of beauty in the conduct of life, in actions, in character, in
the pursuits of the intellect; and there is the beauty of 
the virtues.
What loftier beauty there may be, yet, our argument will bring to
light.

<P>What, then, is it that gives comeliness to material forms and
draws the ear to the sweetness perceived in sounds, and what is the
secret of the beauty there is in all that derives from Soul?

<P>Is there some One Principle from which all take their 
grace, or is
there a beauty peculiar to the embodied and another for the
bodiless? Finally, one or many, what would such a Principle be?

<P>Consider that some things, material shapes for instance, are
gracious not by anything inherent but by something 
communicated, while
others are lovely of themselves, as, for example, Virtue.

<P>The same bodies appear sometimes beautiful, sometimes 
not; so that
there is a good deal between being body and being beautiful.

<P>What, then, is this something that shows itself in certain
material forms? This is the natural beginning of our enquiry.

<P>What is it that attracts the eyes of those to whom a beautiful
object is presented, and calls them, lures them, towards it, 
and fills
them with joy at the sight? If we possess ourselves of this, we have
at once a standpoint for the wider survey.

<P>Almost everyone declares that the symmetry of parts towards each
other and towards a whole, with, besides, a certain charm of colour,
constitutes the beauty recognized by the eye, that in visible
things, as indeed in all else, universally, the beautiful thing is
essentially symmetrical, patterned.

<P>But think what this means.

<P>Only a compound can be beautiful, never anything devoid of
parts; and only a whole; the several parts will have beauty, not in
themselves, but only as working together to give a comely total. Yet
beauty in an aggregate demands beauty in details; it cannot be
constructed out of ugliness; its law must run throughout.

<P>All the loveliness of colour and even the light of the sun,
being devoid of parts and so not beautiful by symmetry, must be
ruled out of the realm of beauty. And how comes gold to be a 
beautiful
thing? And lightning by night, and the stars, why are these so fair?

<P>In sounds also the simple must be proscribed, though often in a
whole noble composition each several tone is delicious in itself.

<P>Again since the one face, constant in symmetry, appears
sometimes fair and sometimes not, can we doubt that beauty is
something more than symmetry, that symmetry itself owes its beauty
to a remoter principle?

<P>Turn to what is attractive in methods of life or in the 
expression
of thought; are we to call in symmetry here? What symmetry is to be
found in noble conduct, or excellent laws, in any form of mental
pursuit?

<P>What symmetry can there be in points of abstract thought?

<P>The symmetry of being accordant with each other? But there may
be accordance or entire identity where there is nothing but
ugliness: the proposition that honesty is merely a generous
artlessness chimes in the most perfect harmony with the proposition
that morality means weakness of will; the accordance is complete.

<P>Then again, all the virtues are a beauty of the soul, a beauty
authentic beyond any of these others; but how does symmetry enter
here? The soul, it is true, is not a simple unity, but still its
virtue cannot have the symmetry of size or of number: what 
standard of
measurement could preside over the compromise or the coalescence of
the soul's faculties or purposes?

<P>Finally, how by this theory would there be beauty in the
Intellectual-Principle, essentially the solitary?
