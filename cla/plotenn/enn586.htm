<P>26. We may now take the various specific types of Motion, such
as locomotion, and once again enquire for each one whether it is not
to be divided on the basis of direction, up, down, straight, 
circular-
a question already raised; whether the organic motion should be
distinguished from the inorganic- they are clearly not 
alike; whether,
again, organic motions should be subdivided into walking, 
swimming and
flight.

<P>Perhaps we should also distinguish, in each species, natural
from unnatural motions: this distinction would however imply that
motions have differences which are not external. It may indeed be
the case that motions create these differences and cannot exist
without them; but Nature may be supposed to be the ultimate source
of motions and differences alike.

<P>Motions may also be classed as natural, artificial and
purposive: "natural" embracing growth and decay; "artificial"
architecture and shipbuilding; "purposive" enquiry, learning,
government, and, in general, all speech and action.

<P>Again, with regard to growth, alteration and birth, the division
may proceed from the natural and unnatural, or, speaking generally,
from the characters of the moved objects.
