#### Section 2

2\. Thus there is the primally intellective and there is that in which
intellection has taken another mode; but this indicates that what
transcends the primarily intellective has no intellection; for, to have
intellection, it must become an Intellectual-Principle, and, if it is to
become that, it must possess an intellectual object and, as primarily
intellective, it must possess that intellectual object as something
within itself.

But it is not inevitable that every intellectual object should both
possess the intellective principle in itself and exercise intellection:
at that, it would be not merely object but subject as well and, besides,
being thus dual, could not be primal: further, the intellectual
principle that is to possess the intellectual object could not cohere
unless there existed an essence purely intellectual, something which,
while standing as intellectual object to the intellectual principle, is
in its own essence neither an agent nor an object of intellection. The
intellectual object points to something beyond itself \[to a
percipient\]; and the intellectual agent has its intellection in vain
unless by seizing and holding an object- since, failing that, it can
have no intellection but is consummated only when it possesses itself of
its natural term.

There must have been something standing consummate independently of any
intellectual act, something perfect in its own essence: thus that in
which this completion is inherent must exist before intellection; in
other words it has no need of intellection, having been always
self-sufficing: this, then, will have no intellectual act.

Thus we arrive at: a principle having no intellection, a principle
having intellection primarily, a principle having it secondarily.

It may be added that, supposing The First to be intellective, it thereby
possesses something \[some object, some attribute\]: at once it ceases
to be a first; it is a secondary, and not even a unity; it is a many; it
is all of which it takes intellectual possession; even though its
intellection fell solely upon its own content, it must still be a
manifold.
