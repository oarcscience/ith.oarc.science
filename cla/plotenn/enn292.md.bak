#### Section 6

6\. But how comes it that while the All-Soul has produced a kosmos, the
soul of the particular has not, though it is of the one ideal Kind and
contains, it too, all things in itself?

We have indicated that a thing may enter and dwell at the same time in
various places; this ought to be explained, and the enquiry would show
how an identity resident simultaneously here and there may, in its
separate appearances, act or react- or both- after distinct modes; but
the matter deserves to be examined in a special discussion.

To return, then: how and why has the All-Soul produced a kosmos, while
the particular souls simply administer some one part of it?

In the first place, we are not surprised when men of identical knowledge
differ greatly in effective power.

But the reason, we will be asked.

The answer might be that there is an even greater difference among these
souls, the one never having fallen away from the All-Soul, but dwelling
within it and assuming body therein, while the others received their
allotted spheres when the body was already in existence, when their
sister soul was already in rule and, as it were, had already prepared
habitations for them. Again, the reason may be that the one \[the
creative All-Soul\] looks towards the universal Intellectual-Principle
\[the exemplar of all that can be\], while the others are more occupied
with the Intellectual within themselves, that which is already of the
sphere of part; perhaps, too, these also could have created, but that
they were anticipated by that originator- the work accomplished before
them- an impediment inevitable whichsoever of the souls were first to
operate.

But it is safer to account for the creative act by nearer connection
with the over-world; the souls whose tendency is exercised within the
Supreme have the greater power; immune in that pure seat they create
securely; for the greater power takes the least hurt from the material
within which it operates; and this power remains enduringly attached to
the over-world: it creates, therefore, self gathered and the created
things gather round it; the other souls, on the contrary, themselves go
forth; that can mean only that they have deserted towards the abyss; a
main phase in them is drawn downward and pulls them with it in the
desire towards the lower.

The "secondary and tertiary souls," of which we hear, must be understood
in the sense of closer or remoter position: it is much as in ourselves
the relation to the Supreme is not identical from soul to soul; some of
us are capable of becoming Uniate, others of striving and almost
attaining, while a third rank is much less apt; it is a matter of the
degree or powers of the soul by which our expression is determined- the
first degree dominant in the one person, the second, the third \[the
merely animal life\] in others while, still, all of us contain all the
powers.
