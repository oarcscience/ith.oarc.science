#### Section 10

10\. (15) That the soul is of the family of the diviner nature, the
eternal, is clear from our demonstration that it is not material:
besides it has neither shape or colour nor is it tangible. But there are
other proofs.

Assuming that the divine and the authentically existent possesses a life
beneficent and wise, we take the next step and begin with working out
the nature of our own soul.

Let us consider a soul, not one that has appropriated the unreasoned
desires and impulses of the bodily life, or any other such emotion and
experience, but one that has cast all this aside, and as far as possible
has no commerce with the bodily. Such a soul demonstrates that all evil
is accretion, alien, and that in the purged soul the noble things are
immanent, wisdom and all else that is good, as its native store.

If this is the soul once it has returned to its self, how deny that it
is the nature we have identified with all the divine and eternal? Wisdom
and authentic virtue are divine, and could not be found in the chattel
mean and mortal: what possesses these must be divine by its very
capacity of the divine, the token of kinship and of identical substance.

Hence, too, any one of us that exhibits these qualities will differ but
little as far as soul is concerned from the Supernals; he will be less
than they only to the extent in which the soul is, in him, associated
with body.

This is so true that, if every human being were at that stage, or if a
great number lived by a soul of that degree, no one would be so
incredulous as to doubt that the soul in man is immortal. It is because
we see everywhere the spoiled souls of the great mass that it becomes
difficult to recognize their divinity and immortality.

To know the nature of a thing we must observe it in its unalloyed state,
since any addition obscures the reality. Clear, then look: or, rather,
let a man first purify himself and then observe: he will not doubt his
immortality when he sees himself thus entered into the pure, the
Intellectual. For, what he sees is an Intellectual-Principle looking on
nothing of sense, nothing of this mortality, but by its own eternity
having intellection of the eternal: he will see all things in this
Intellectual substance, himself having become an Intellectual Kosmos and
all lightsome, illuminated by the truth streaming from The Good, which
radiates truth upon all that stands within that realm of the divine.

Thus he will often feel the beauty of that word "Farewell: I am to you
an immortal God," for he has ascended to the Supreme, and is all one
strain to enter into likeness with it.

If the purification puts the human into knowledge of the highest, then,
too, the science latent within becomes manifest, the only authentic
knowing. For it is not by running hither and thither outside of itself
that the soul understands morality and right conduct: it learns them of
its own nature, in its contact with itself, in its intellectual grasp of
itself, seeing deeply impressed upon it the images of its primal state;
what was one mass of rust from long neglect it has restored to purity.

Imagine living gold: it files away all that is earthy about it, all that
kept it in self-ignorance preventing it from knowing itself as gold;
seen now unalloyed it is at once filled with admiration of its worth and
knows that it has no need of any other glory than its own, triumphant if
only it be allowed to remain purely to itself.
