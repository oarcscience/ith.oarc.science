#### Section 7

7\. Knowledge in the reasoning soul is on the one side concerned with
objects of sense, though indeed this can scarcely be called knowledge
and is better indicated as opinion or surface-knowing; it is of later
origin than the objects since it is a reflection from them: but on the
other hand there is the knowledge handling the intellectual objects and
this is the authentic knowledge; it enters the reasoning soul from the
Intellectual-Principle and has no dealing with anything in sense. Being
true knowledge it actually is everything of which it takes cognisance;
it carries as its own content the intellectual act and the intellectual
object since it carries the Intellectual-Principle which actually is the
primals and is always self-present and is in its nature an Act, never by
any want forced to seek, never acquiring or traversing the remote- for
all such experience belongs to soul- but always self-gathered, the very
Being of the collective total, not an extern creating things by the act
of knowing them.

Not by its thinking God does God come to be; not by its thinking
Movement does Movement arise. Hence it is an error to call the Ideas
intellections in the sense that, upon an intellectual act in this
Principle, one such Idea or another is made to exist or exists. No: the
object of this intellection must exist before the intellective act
\[must be the very content not the creation of the
Intellectual-Principle\]. How else could that Principle come to know it:
certainly not \[as an external\] by luck or by haphazard search.
