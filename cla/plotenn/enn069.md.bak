#### Section 9

9\. And this inner vision, what is its operation?

Newly awakened it is all too feeble to bear the ultimate splendour.
Therefore the Soul must be trained- to the habit of remarking, first,
all noble pursuits, then the works of beauty produced not by the labour
of the arts but by the virtue of men known for their goodness: lastly,
you must search the souls of those that have shaped these beautiful
forms.

But how are you to see into a virtuous soul and know its loveliness?

Withdraw into yourself and look. And if you do not find yourself
beautiful yet, act as does the creator of a statue that is to be made
beautiful: he cuts away here, he smoothes there, he makes this line
lighter, this other purer, until a lovely face has grown upon his work.
So do you also: cut away all that is excessive, straighten all that is
crooked, bring light to all that is overcast, labour to make all one
glow of beauty and never cease chiselling your statue, until there shall
shine out on you from it the godlike splendour of virtue, until you
shall see the perfect goodness surely established in the stainless
shrine.

When you know that you have become this perfect work, when you are
self-gathered in the purity of your being, nothing now remaining that
can shatter that inner unity, nothing from without clinging to the
authentic man, when you find yourself wholly true to your essential
nature, wholly that only veritable Light which is not measured by space,
not narrowed to any circumscribed form nor again diffused as a thing
void of term, but ever unmeasurable as something greater than all
measure and more than all quantity- when you perceive that you have
grown to this, you are now become very vision: now call up all your
confidence, strike forward yet a step- you need a guide no longer-
strain, and see.

This is the only eye that sees the mighty Beauty. If the eye that
adventures the vision be dimmed by vice, impure, or weak, and unable in
its cowardly blenching to see the uttermost brightness, then it sees
nothing even though another point to what lies plain to sight before it.
To any vision must be brought an eye adapted to what is to be seen, and
having some likeness to it. Never did eye see the sun unless it had
first become sunlike, and never can the soul have vision of the First
Beauty unless itself be beautiful.

Therefore, first let each become godlike and each beautiful who cares to
see God and Beauty. So, mounting, the Soul will come first to the
Intellectual-Principle and survey all the beautiful Ideas in the Supreme
and will avow that this is Beauty, that the Ideas are Beauty. For by
their efficacy comes all Beauty else, but the offspring and essence of
the Intellectual-Being. What is beyond the Intellectual-Principle we
affirm to be the nature of Good radiating Beauty before it. So that,
treating the Intellectual-Kosmos as one, the first is the Beautiful: if
we make distinction there, the Realm of Ideas constitutes the Beauty of
the Intellectual Sphere; and The Good, which lies beyond, is the
Fountain at once and Principle of Beauty: the Primal Good and the Primal
Beauty have the one dwelling-place and, thus, always, Beauty's seat is
There.
