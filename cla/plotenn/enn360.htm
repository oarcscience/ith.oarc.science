<P>41. The prayer is answered by the mere fact that part and other
part are wrought to one tone like a musical string which, plucked at
one end, vibrates at the other also. Often, too, the sounding of one
string awakens what might pass for a perception in another, 
the result
of their being in harmony and tuned to one musical scale; now, if
the vibration in a lyre affects another by virtue of the sympathy
existing between them, then certainly in the All- even though it is
constituted in contraries- there must be one melodic system; for it
contains its unisons as well, and its entire content, even to those
contraries, is a kinship.

<P>Thus, too, whatever is hurtful to man- the passionate spirit,
for example, drawn by the medium of the gall into the 
principle seated
in the liver- comes with no intention of hurt; it is simply as one
transferring fire to another might innocently burn him: no doubt,
since he actually set the other on fire he is a cause, but 
only as the
attacking fire itself is a cause, that is by the merely accidental
fact that the person to whom the fire was being brought blundered in
taking it.
