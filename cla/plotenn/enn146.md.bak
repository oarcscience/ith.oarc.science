#### Section 2

2\. But we must enquire into Quality in itself: to know its nature is
certainly the way to settle our general question.

The first point is to assure ourselves whether or not one and the same
thing may be held to be sometimes a mere qualification and sometimes a
constituent of Reality- not staying on the point that qualification
could not be constitutive of a Reality but of a qualified Reality only.

Now in a Reality possessing a determined quality, the Reality and the
fact of existence precede the qualified Reality.

What, then, in the case of fire is the Reality which precedes the
qualified Reality?

Its mere body, perhaps? If so, body being the Reality, fire is a warmed
body; and the total thing is not the Reality; and the fire has warmth as
a man might have a snub nose.

Rejecting its warmth, its glow, its lightness- all which certainly do
seem to be qualities- and its resistance, there is left only its
extension by three dimensions: in other words, its Matter is its
Reality.

But that cannot be held: surely the form is much more likely than the
Matter to be the Reality.

But is not the Form of Quality?

No, the Form is not a Quality: it is a Reason-Principle.

And the outcome of this Reason-Principle entering into the underlying
Matter, what is that?

Certainly not what is seen and burns, for that is the something in which
these qualities inhere.

We might define the burning as an Act springing from the
Reason-Principle: then the warming and lighting and other effects of
fire will be its Acts and we still have found no foothold for its
quality.

Such completions of a Reality cannot be called qualities since they are
its Acts emanating from the Reason-Principles and from the essential
powers. A quality is something persistently outside Reality; it cannot
appear as Reality in one place after having figured in another as
quality; its function is to bring in the something more after the
Reality is established, such additions as virtue, vice, ugliness,
beauty, health, a certain shape. On this last, however, it may be
remarked that triangularity and quadrangularity are not in themselves
qualities, but there is quality when a thing is triangular by having
been brought to that shape; the quality is not the triangularity but the
patterning to it. The case is the same with the arts and avocations.

Thus: Quality is a condition superadded to a Reality whose existence
does not depend upon it, whether this something more be a later
acquirement or an accompaniment from the first; it is something in whose
absence the Reality would still be complete. It will sometimes come and
go, sometimes be inextricably attached, so that there are two forms of
Quality, the moveable and the fixed.
