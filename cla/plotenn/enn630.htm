<P>11. It may be suggested that the decad is nothing more than so
many henads; admitting the one henad why should we reject the ten?
As the one is a real existence why not the rest? We are certainly
not compelled to attach that one henad to some one thing and so
deprive all the rest of the means to unity: since every existent
must be one thing, the unity is obviously common to all. This means
one principle applying to many, the principle whose existence within
itself we affirmed to be presupposed by its manifestation outside.

<P>But if a henad exists in some given object and further 
is observed
in something else, then that first henad being real, there cannot be
only one henad in existence; there must be a multiplicity of henads.

<P>Supposing that first henad alone to exist, it must obviously be
lodged either in the thing of completest Being or at all 
events in the
thing most completely a unity. If in the thing of completest Being,
then the other henads are but nominal and cannot be ranked with the
first henad, or else Number becomes a collection of unlike monads
and there are differences among monads [an impossibility]. If that
first henad is to be taken as lodged in the thing of 
completest unity,
there is the question why that most perfect unity should require the
first henad to give it unity.

<P>Since all this is impossible, then, before any particular can be
thought of as a unit, there must exist a unity bare, 
unrelated by very
essence. If in that realm also there must be a unity apart from
anything that can be called one thing, why should there not exist
another unity as well?

<P>Each particular, considered in itself, would be a manifold of
monads, totalling to a collective unity. If however Nature produces
continuously- or rather has produced once for all- not halting at
the first production but bringing a sort of continuous unity into
being, then it produces the minor numbers by the sheer fact 
of setting
an early limit to its advance: outgoing to a greater extent- not in
the sense of moving from point to point but in its inner changes- it
would produce the larger numbers; to each number so emerging it
would attach the due quantities and the appropriate thing, knowing
that without this adaptation to Number the thing could not exist or
would be a stray, something outside, at once, of both Number and
Reason.
