#### Section 1

1\. In our theory, feelings are not states; they are action upon
experience, action accompanied by judgement: the states, we hold, are
seated elsewhere; they may be referred to the vitalized body; the
judgement resides in the Soul, and is distinct from the state- for, if
it is not distinct, another judgement is demanded, one that is distinct,
and, so, we may be sent back for ever.

Still, this leaves it undecided whether in the act of judgement the
judging faculty does or does not take to itself something of its object.

If the judging faculty does actually receive an imprint, then it
partakes of the state- though what are called the Impressions may be of
quite another nature than is supposed; they may be like Thought, that is
to say they may be acts rather than states; there may be, here too,
awareness without participation.

For ourselves, it could never be in our system- or in our liking- to
bring the Soul down to participation in such modes and modifications as
the warmth and cold of material frames.

What is known as the Impressionable faculty of the soul- to pathetikon-
would need to be identified: we must satisfy ourselves as to whether
this too, like the Soul as a unity, is to be classed as immune or, on
the contrary, as precisely the only part susceptible of being affected;
this question, however, may be held over; we proceed to examine its
preliminaries.

Even in the superior phase of the Soul- that which precedes the
impressionable faculty and any sensation- how can we reconcile immunity
with the indwelling of vice, false notions, ignorance? Inviolability;
and yet likings and dislikings, the Soul enjoying, grieving, angry,
grudging, envying, desiring, never at peace but stirring and shifting
with everything that confronts it!

If the Soul were material and had magnitude, it would be difficult,
indeed quite impossible, to make it appear to be immune, unchangeable,
when any of such emotions lodge in it. And even considering it as an
Authentic Being, devoid of magnitude and necessarily indestructible, we
must be very careful how we attribute any such experiences to it or we
will find ourselves unconsciously making it subject to dissolution. If
its essence is a Number or as we hold a Reason-Principle, under neither
head could it be susceptible of feeling. We can think, only, that it
entertains unreasoned reasons and experiences unexperienced, all
transmuted from the material frames, foreign and recognized only by
parallel, so that it possesses in a kind of non-possession and knows
affection without being affected. How this can be demands enquiry.
