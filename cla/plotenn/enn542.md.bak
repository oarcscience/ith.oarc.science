#### Section 5

5\. A first point demanding consideration:

Bodies- those, for example, of animals and plants- are each a
multiplicity founded on colour and shape and magnitude, and on the forms
and arrangement of parts: yet all these elements spring from a unity.
Now this unity must be either Unity-Absolute or some unity less
thorough-going and complete, but necessarily more complete than that
which emerges, so to speak, from the body itself; this will be a unity
having more claim to reality than the unity produced from it, for
divergence from unity involves a corresponding divergence from Reality.
Since, thus, bodies take their rise from unity, but not "unity" in the
sense of the complete unity or Unity-Absolute- for this could never
yield discrete plurality- it remains that they be derived from a unity
Pluralized. But the creative principle \[in bodies\] is Soul: Soul
therefore is a pluralized unity.

We then ask whether the plurality here consists of the Reason-Principles
of the things of process. Or is this unity not something different from
the mere sum of these Principles? Certainly Soul itself is one
Reason-Principle, the chief of the Reason-Principles, and these are its
Act as it functions in accordance with its essential being; this
essential being, on the other hand, is the potentiality of the
Reason-Principles. This is the mode in which this unity is a plurality,
its plurality being revealed by the effect it has upon the external.

But, to leave the region of its effect, suppose we take it at the higher
non-effecting part of Soul; is not plurality of powers to be found in
this part also? The existence of this higher part will, we may presume,
be at once conceded.

But is this existence to be taken as identical with that of the stone?
Surely not. Being in the case of the stone is not Being pure and simple,
but stone-being: so here; Soul's being denotes not merely Being but
Soul-being.

Is then that "being" distinct from what else goes to complete the
essence \[or substance\] of Soul? Is it to be identified with Bring
\[the Absolute\], while to some differentia of Being is ascribed the
production of Soul? No doubt Soul is in a sense Being, and this is not
as a man "is" white, but from the fact of its being purely an essence:
in other words, the being it possesses it holds from no source external
to its own essence.
