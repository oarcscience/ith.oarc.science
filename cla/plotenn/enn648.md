#### Section 10

10\. But failure There? What can defensive horns serve to There? To
sufficiency as living form, to completeness. That principle must be
complete as living form, complete as Intellect, complete as life, so
that if it is not to be one thing it may be another. Its characteristic
difference is in this power of being now this, now that, so that,
summing all, it may be the completest life-form, Intelligence complete,
life in greatest fulness with each of the particulars complete in its
degree while yet, over all that multiplicity, unity reigns.

If all were one identity, the total could not contain this variety of
forms; there would be nothing but a self-sufficing unity. Like every
compound it must consist of things progressively differing in form and
safeguarded in that form. This is in the very nature of shape and
Reason-Principle; a shape, that of man let us suppose, must include a
certain number of differences of part but all dominated by a unity;
there will be the noble and the inferior, eye and finger, but all within
a unity; the part will be inferior in comparison with the total but best
in its place. The Reason-Principle, too, is at once the living form and
something else, something distinct from the being of that form. It is so
with virtue also; it contains at once the universal and the particular;
and the total is good because the universal is not differentiated.
