#### Section 11

11\. Now as to the arts and crafts and their productions:

The imitative arts- painting, sculpture, dancing, pantomimic gesturing-
are, largely, earth-based; on an earthly base; they follow models found
in sense, since they copy forms and movements and reproduce seen
symmetries; they cannot therefore be referred to that higher sphere
except indirectly, through the Reason-Principle in humanity.

On the other hand any skill which, beginning with the observation of the
symmetry of living things, grows to the symmetry of all life, will be a
portion of the Power There which observes and meditates the symmetry
reigning among all beings in the Intellectual Kosmos. Thus all music-
since its thought is upon melody and rhythm- must be the earthly
representation of the music there is in the rhythm of the Ideal Realm.

The crafts, such as building and carpentry which give us Matter in
wrought forms, may be said, in that they draw on pattern, to take their
principles from that realm and from the thinking There: but in that they
bring these down into contact with the sense-order, they are not wholly
in the Intellectual: they are founded in man. So agriculture, dealing
with material growths: so medicine watching over physical health; so the
art which aims at corporeal strength and well-being: power and
well-being mean something else There, the fearlessness and
self-sufficing quality of all that lives.

Oratory and generalship, administration and sovereignty- under any forms
in which their activities are associated with Good and when they look to
that- possess something derived thence and building up their knowledge
from the knowledge There.

Geometry, the science of the Intellectual entities, holds place There:
so, too, philosophy, whose high concern is Being.

For the arts and products of art, these observations may suffice.
