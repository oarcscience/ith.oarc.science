<P>3. We may be told that nothing prevents an identity being thus
multiple. But there must be a unity underlying the aggregate: a
manifold is impossible without a unity for its source or 
ground, or at
least, failing some unity, related or unrelated. This unity must be
numbered as first before all and can be apprehended only as solitary
and self-existent.

<P>When we recognize it, resident among the mass of things, our
business is to see it for what it is- present to the items but
essentially distinguished from them- and, while not denying it
there, to seek this underly of all no longer as it appears in those
other things but as it stands in its pure identity by itself. The
identity resident in the rest of things is no doubt close to 
authentic
identity but cannot be it; and, if the identity of unity is to be
displayed beyond itself, it must also exist within itself alone.

<P>It may be suggested that its existence takes substantial 
form only
by its being resident among outside things: but, at this, it 
is itself
no longer simplex nor could any coherence of manifolds occur. On the
one hand things could take substantial existence only if they were
in their own virtue simplex. On the other hand, failing a 
simplex, the
aggregate of multiples is itself impossible: for the simplex
individual thing could not exist if there were no simplex unity
independent of the individual, [a principle of identity] and, not
existing, much less could it enter into composition with any other
such: it becomes impossible then for the compound universe, the
aggregate of all, to exist; it would be the coming together of
things that are not, things not merely lacking an identity of their
own but utterly non-existent.

<P>Once there is any manifold, there must be a precedent 
unity: since
any intellection implies multiplicity in the intellective 
subject, the
non-multiple must be without intellection; that non-multiple will be
the First: intellection and the Intellectual-Principle must be
characteristic of beings coming later.
