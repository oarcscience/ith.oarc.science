#### Section 8

8\. These considerations, amounting to the settlement of the question,
are not countered by the phenomenon of sympathy; the response between
soul and soul is due to the mere fact that all spring from that
self-same soul \[the next to Divine Mind\] from which springs the Soul
of the All.

We have already stated that the one soul is also multiple; and we have
dealt with the different forms of relationship between part and whole:
we have investigated the different degrees existing within soul; we may
now add, briefly, that differences might be induced, also, by the bodies
with which the soul has to do, and, even more, by the character and
mental operations carried over from the conduct of the previous lives.
"The life-choice made by a soul has a correspondence"- we read- "with
its former lives."

As regards the nature of soul in general, the differences have been
defined in the passage in which we mentioned the secondary and tertiary
orders and laid down that, while all souls are all-comprehensive, each
ranks according to its operative phase- one becoming Uniate in the
achieved fact, another in knowledge, another in desire, according to the
distinct orientation by which each is, or tends to become, what it looks
upon. The very fulfillment and perfectionment attainable by souls cannot
but be different.

But, if in the total the organization in which they have their being is
compact of variety- as it must be since every Reason-Principle is a
unity of multiplicity and variety, and may be thought of as a psychic
animated organism having many shapes at its command- if this is so and
all constitutes a system in which being is not cut adrift from being, if
there is nothing chance- borne among beings as there is none even in
bodily organisms, then it follows that Number must enter into the
scheme; for, once again, Being must be stable; the members of the
Intellectual must possess identity, each numerically one; this is the
condition of individuality. Where, as in bodily masses, the Idea is not
essentially native, and the individuality is therefore in flux,
existence under ideal form can rise only out of imitation of the
Authentic Existences; these last, on the contrary, not rising out of any
such conjunction \[as the duality of Idea and dead Matter\] have their
being in that which is numerically one, that which was from the
beginning, and neither becomes what it has not been nor can cease to be
what it is.

Even supposing Real-Beings \[such as soul\] to be produced by some other
principle, they are certainly not made from Matter; or, if they were,
the creating principle must infuse into them, from within itself,
something of the nature of Real-Being; but, at this, it would itself
suffer change, as it created more or less. And, after all, why should it
thus produce at any given moment rather than remain for ever stationary?

Moreover the produced total, variable from more to less, could not be an
eternal: yet the soul, it stands agreed, is eternal.

But what becomes of the soul's infinity if it is thus fixed?

The infinity is a matter of power: there is question, not of the soul's
being divisible into an infinite number of parts, but of an infinite
possible effectiveness: it is infinity in the sense in which the Supreme
God, also, is free of all bound.

This means that it is no external limit that defines the individual
being or the extension of souls any more than of God; on the contrary
each in right of its own power is all that it chooses to be: and we are
not to think of it as going forth from itself \[losing its unity by any
partition\]: the fact is simply that the element within it, which is apt
to entrance into body, has the power of immediate projection any
whither: the soul is certainly not wrenched asunder by its presence at
once in foot and in finger. Its presence in the All is similarly
unbroken; over its entire range it exists in every several part of
everything having even vegetal life, even in a part cut off from the
main; in any possible segment it is as it is at its source. For the body
of the All is a unit, and soul is everywhere present to it as to one
thing.

When some animal rots and a multitude of others spring from it, the
Life-Principle now present is not the particular soul that was in the
larger body; that body has ceased to be receptive of soul, or there
would have been no death; what happens is that whatsoever in the product
of the decay is apt material for animal existence of one kind or another
becomes ensouled by the fact that soul is nowhere lacking, though a
recipient of soul may be. This new ensouling does not mean, however, an
increase in the number of souls: all depend from the one or, rather, all
remains one: it is as with ourselves; some elements are shed, others
grow in their place; the soul abandons the discarded and flows into the
newcoming as long as the one soul of the man holds its ground; in the
All the one soul holds its ground for ever; its distinct contents now
retain soul and now reject it, but the total of spiritual beings is
unaffected.
