#### Section 10

10\. And what will such a Principle essentially be?

The potentiality of the Universe: the potentiality whose non-existence
would mean the non-existence of all the Universe and even of the
Intellectual-Principle which is the primal Life and all Life.

This Principle on the thither side of Life is the cause of Life- for
that Manifestation of Life which is the Universe of things is not the
First Activity; it is itself poured forth, so to speak, like water from
a spring.

Imagine a spring that has no source outside itself; it gives itself to
all the rivers, yet is never exhausted by what they take, but remains
always integrally as it was; the tides that proceed from it are at one
within it before they run their several ways, yet all, in some sense,
know beforehand down what channels they will pour their streams.

Or: think of the Life coursing throughout some mighty tree while yet it
is the stationary Principle of the whole, in no sense scattered over all
that extent but, as it were, vested in the root: it is the giver of the
entire and manifold life of the tree, but remains unmoved itself, not
manifold but the Principle of that manifold life.

And this surprises no one: though it is in fact astonishing how all that
varied vitality springs from the unvarying, and how that very
manifoldness could not be unless before the multiplicity there were
something all singleness; for, the Principle is not broken into parts to
make the total; on the contrary, such partition would destroy both;
nothing would come into being if its cause, thus broken up, changed
character.

Thus we are always brought back to The One.

Every particular thing has a One of its own to which it may be traced;
the All has its One, its Prior but not yet the Absolute One; through
this we reach that Absolute One, where all such reference comes to an
end.

Now when we reach a One- the stationary Principle- in the tree, in the
animal, in Soul, in the All- we have in every case the most powerful,
the precious element: when we come to the One in the Authentically
Existent Beings- their Principle and source and potentiality- shall we
lose confidence and suspect it of being-nothing?

Certainly this Absolute is none of the things of which it is the source-
its nature is that nothing can be affirmed of it- not existence, not
essence, not life- since it is That which transcends all these. But
possess yourself of it by the very elimination of Being and you hold a
marvel. Thrusting forward to This, attaining, and resting in its
content, seek to grasp it more and more- understanding it by that
intuitive thrust alone, but knowing its greatness by the Beings that
follow upon it and exist by its power.

Another approach:

The Intellectual-Principle is a Seeing, and a Seeing which itself sees;
therefore it is a potentiality which has become effective.

This implies the distinction of Matter and Form in it- as there must be
in all actual seeing- the Matter in this case being the Intelligibles
which the Intellectual-Principle contains and sees. All actual seeing
implies duality; before the seeing takes place there is the pure unity
\[of the power of seeing\]. That unity \[of principle\] acquires duality
\[in the act of seeing\], and the duality is \[always to be traced back
to\] a unity.

Now as our sight requires the world of sense for its satisfaction and
realization, so the vision in the Intellectual-Principle demands, for
its completion, The Good.

It cannot be, itself, The Good, since then it would not need to see or
to perform any other Act; for The Good is the centre of all else, and it
is by means of The Good that every thing has Act, while the Good is in
need of nothing and therefore possesses nothing beyond itself.

Once you have uttered "The Good," add no further thought: by any
addition, and in proportion to that addition, you introduce a
deficiency.

Do not even say that it has Intellection; you would be dividing it; it
would become a duality, Intellect and the Good. The Good has no need of
the Intellectual-Principle which, on the contrary, needs it, and,
attaining it, is shaped into Goodness and becomes perfect by it: the
Form thus received, sprung from the Good, brings it to likeness with the
Good.

Thus the traces of the Good discerned upon it must be taken as
indication of the nature of that Archetype: we form a conception of its
Authentic Being from its image playing upon the Intellectual-Principle.
This image of itself, it has communicated to the Intellect that
contemplates it: thus all the striving is on the side of the Intellect,
which is the eternal striver and eternally the attainer. The Being
beyond neither strives, since it feels no lack, nor attains, since it
has no striving. And this marks it off from the Intellectual-Principle,
to which characteristically belongs the striving, the concentrated
strain towards its Form.

Yet: The Intellectual-Principle; beautiful; the most beautiful of all;
lying lapped in pure light and in clear radiance; circumscribing the
Nature of the Authentic Existents; the original of which this beautiful
world is a shadow and an image; tranquil in the fullness of glory since
in it there is nothing devoid of intellect, nothing dark or out of rule;
a living thing in a life of blessedness: this, too, must overwhelm with
awe any that has seen it, and penetrated it, to become a unit of its
Being.

But: As one that looks up to the heavens and sees the splendour of the
stars thinks of the Maker and searches, so whoever has contemplated the
Intellectual Universe and known it and wondered for it must search after
its Maker too. What Being has raised so noble a fabric? And where? And
how? Who has begotten such a child, this Intellectual-Principle, this
lovely abundance so abundantly endowed?

The Source of all this cannot be an Intellect; nor can it be an abundant
power: it must have been before Intellect and abundance were; these are
later and things of lack; abundance had to be made abundant and
Intellection needed to know.

These are very near to the un-needing, to that which has no need of
Knowing, they have abundance and intellection authentically, as being
the first to possess. But, there is that before them which neither needs
nor possesses anything, since, needing or possessing anything else, it
would not be what it is- the Good.
