#### Section 21

21\. Now what in all these objects of desire is the fundamental making
them good?

We must be bold:

Intellectual-Principle and that life are of the order of good and hold
their desirability, even they, in virtue of belonging to that order;
they have their goodness, I mean, because Life is an Activity in The
Good,- Or rather, streaming from The Good- while Intellectual-Principle
is an Activity already defined Therein; both are of radiant beauty and,
because they come Thence and lead Thither, they are sought after by the
soul-sought, that is, as things congenial though not veritably good
while yet, as belonging to that order not to be rejected; the related,
if not good, is shunned in spite of that relationship, and even remote
and ignobler things may at times prove attractive.

The intense love called forth by Life and Intellectual-Principle is due
not to what they are but to the consideration of their nature as
something apart, received from above themselves.

Material forms, containing light incorporated in them, need still a
light apart from them that their own light may be manifest; just so the
Beings of that sphere, all lightsome, need another and a lordlier light
or even they would not be visible to themselves and beyond.
