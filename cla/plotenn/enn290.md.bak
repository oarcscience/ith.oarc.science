#### Section 4

4\. But if this is the true account of the unity of soul, we must be
able to meet the problems that ensue: firstly, the difficulty of one
thing being present at the same moment in all things; and, secondly, the
difficulty of soul in body as against soul not embodied.

We might be led to think that all soul must always inhabit body; this
would seem especially plausible in the case of the soul of the universe,
not thought of as ever leaving its body as the human soul does: there
exists, no doubt, an opinion that even the human soul, while it must
leave the body, cannot become an utterly disembodied thing; but assuming
its complete disembodiment, how comes it that the human soul can go free
of the body but the All-Soul not, though they are one and the same?

There is no such difficulty in the case of the Intellectual-Principle;
by the primal differentiation, this separates, no doubt, into partial
things of widely varying nature, but eternal unity is secured by virtue
of the eternal identity of that Essence: it is not so easy to explain
how, in the case of the soul described as separate among bodies, such
differentiated souls can remain one thing.

A possible solution may be offered:

The unit soul holds aloof, not actually falling into body; the
differentiated souls- the All-Soul, with the others- issue from the
unity while still constituting, within certain limits, an association.
They are one soul by the fact that they do not belong unreservedly to
any particular being; they meet, so to speak, fringe to fringe; they
strike out here and there, but are held together at the source much as
light is a divided thing upon earth, shining in this house, and that,
and yet remains uninterruptedly one identical substance.

The All-Soul would always remain above, since essentially it has nothing
to do with descent or with the lower, or with any tendency towards this
sphere: the other souls would become ours \[become "partial," individual
in us\] because their lot is cast for this sphere, and because they are
solicited by a thing \[the body\] which invites their care.

The one- the lowest soul in the to the All-Soul- would correspond to
that in some great growth, silently, unlaboriously conducting the whole;
our own lowest soul might be compared to the insect life in some rotted
part of the growth- for this is the ratio of the animated body to the
universe- while the other soul in us, of one ideal nature with the
higher parts of the All-Soul, may be imaged as the gardener concerned
about the insects lodged in the tree and anxiously working to amend what
is wrong; or we may contrast a healthy man living with the healthy and,
by his thought or by his act, lending himself to the service of those
about him, with, on the other side, a sick man intent upon his own care
and cure, and so living for the body, body-bound.
