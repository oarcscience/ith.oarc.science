<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 18</H4>

<P>18. Are the evils in the Universe necessary because it 
is of later
origin than the Higher Sphere?

<P>Perhaps rather because without evil the All would be incomplete.
For most or even all forms of evil serve the Universe- much as the
poisonous snake has its use- though in most cases their function is
unknown. Vice itself has many useful sides: it brings about much
that is beautiful, in artistic creations for example, and it stirs
us to thoughtful living, not allowing us to drowse in security.

<P>If all this is so, then [the secret of creation is that] the
Soul of the All abides in contemplation of the Highest and Best,
ceaselessly striving towards the Intelligible Kind and towards God:
but, thus absorbing and filled full, it overflows- so to speak- and
the image it gives forth, its last utterance towards the lower, will
be the creative puissance.

<P>This ultimate phase, then, is the Maker, secondary to that
aspect of the Soul which is primarily saturated from the Divine
Intelligence. But the Creator above all is the 
Intellectual-Principle,
as giver, to the Soul that follows it, of those gifts whose traces
exist in the Third Kind.

<P>Rightly, therefore, is this Kosmos described as an image
continuously being imaged, the First and the Second Principles
immobile, the Third, too, immobile essentially, but, accidentally
and in Matter, having motion.

<P>For as long as divine Mind and Soul exist, the divine
Thought-Forms will pour forth into that phase of the Soul: as long as
there is a sun, all that streams from it will be some form of Light.

<P></P>
