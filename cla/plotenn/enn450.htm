<P>1. Anything existing after The First must necessarily arise from
that First, whether immediately or as tracing back to it through
intervenients; there must be an order of secondaries and tertiaries,
in which any second is to be referred to The First, any third to the
second.

<P>Standing before all things, there must exist a Simplex,
differing from all its sequel, self-gathered not inter-blended with
the forms that rise from it, and yet able in some mode of its own to
be present to those others: it must be authentically a unity, not
merely something elaborated into unity and so in reality no more
than unity's counterfeit; it will debar all telling and 
knowing except
that it may be described as transcending Being- for if there were
nothing outside all alliance and compromise, nothing authentically
one, there would be no Source. Untouched by multiplicity, it will be
wholly self-sufficing, an absolute First, whereas any not-first
demands its earlier, and any non-simplex needs the 
simplicities within
itself as the very foundations of its composite existence.

<P>There can be only one such being: if there were another, the two
[as indiscernible] would resolve into one, for we are not 
dealing with
two corporal entities.

<P>Our One-First is not a body: a body is not simplex and, 
as a thing
of process cannot be a First, the Source cannot be a thing of
generation: only a principle outside of body, and utterly 
untouched by
multiplicity, could be The First.

<P>Any unity, then, later than The First must be no longer simplex;
it can be no more than a unity in diversity.

<P>Whence must such a sequent arise?

<P>It must be an offspring of The First; for suppose it the product
of chance, that First ceases to be the Principle of All.

<P>But how does it arise from The First?

<P>If The First is perfect, utterly perfect above all, and is the
beginning of all power, it must be the most powerful of all that is,
and all other powers must act in some partial imitation of it. Now
other beings, coming to perfection, are observed to 
generate; they are
unable to remain self-closed; they produce: and this is true not
merely of beings endowed with will, but of growing things where
there is no will; even lifeless objects impart something of
themselves, as far as they may; fire warms, snow chills, drugs have
their own outgoing efficacy; all things to the utmost of their power
imitate the Source in some operation tending to eternity and to
service.

<P>How then could the most perfect remain self-set- the First Good,
the Power towards all, how could it grudge or be powerless to give
of itself, and how at that would it still be the Source?

<P>If things other than itself are to exist, things 
dependent upon it
for their reality, it must produce since there is no other 
source. And
further this engendering principle must be the very highest in
worth; and its immediate offspring, its secondary, must be 
the best of
all that follows.
