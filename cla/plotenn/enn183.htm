<P>8. What can this other cause be; one standing above those
treated of; one that leaves nothing causeless, that 
preserves sequence
and order in the Universe and yet allows ourselves some reality and
leaves room for prediction and augury?

<P>Soul: we must place at the crest of the world of beings, this
other Principle, not merely the Soul of the Universe but, included
in it, the Soul of the individual: this, no mean Principle, is
needed to be the bond of union in the total of things, not, itself,
a thing sprung like things from life-seeds, but a first-hand Cause,
bodiless and therefore supreme over itself, free, beyond the reach
of kosmic Cause: for, brought into body, it would not be
unrestrictedly sovereign; it would hold rank in a series.

<P>Now the environment into which this independent principle
enters, when it comes to this midpoint, will be largely led by
secondary causes [or, by chance-causes]: there will therefore be a
compromise; the action of the Soul will be in part guided by this
environment while in other matters it will be sovereign, leading the
way where it will. The nobler Soul will have the greater power; the
poorer Soul, the lesser. A soul which defers to the bodily 
temperament
cannot escape desire and rage and is abject in poverty, 
overbearing in
wealth, arbitrary in power. The soul of nobler nature holds good
against its surroundings; it is more apt to change them than to be
changed, so that often it improves the environment and, where it
must make concession, at least keeps its innocence.
