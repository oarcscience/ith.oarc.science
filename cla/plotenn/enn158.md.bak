#### Section 3

3\. Ever illuminated, receiving light unfailing, the All-Soul imparts it
to the entire series of later Being which by this light is sustained and
fostered and endowed with the fullest measure of life that each can
absorb. It may be compared with a central fire warming every receptive
body within range.

Our fire, however, is a thing of limited scope: given powers that have
no limitation and are never cut off from the Authentic Existences, how
imagine anything existing and yet failing to receive from them?

It is of the essence of things that each gives of its being to another:
without this communication, The Good would not be Good, nor the
Intellectual-Principle an Intellective Principle, nor would Soul itself
be what it is: the law is, "some life after the Primal Life, a second
where there is a first; all linked in one unbroken chain; all eternal;
divergent types being engendered only in the sense of being secondary."

In other words, things commonly described as generated have never known
a beginning: all has been and will be. Nor can anything disappear unless
where a later form is possible: without such a future there can be no
dissolution.

If we are told that there is always Matter as a possible term, we ask
why then should not Matter itself come to nothingness. If we are told it
may, then we ask why it should ever have been generated. If the answer
comes that it had its necessary place as the ultimate of the series, we
return that the necessity still holds.

With Matter left aside as wholly isolated, the Divine Beings are not
everywhere but in some bounded place, walled off, so to speak; if that
is not possible, Matter itself must receive the Divine light \[and so
cannot be annihilated\].
