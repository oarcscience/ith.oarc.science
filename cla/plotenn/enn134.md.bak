#### Section 13

13\. Are we asked to accept as the substratum some attribute or quality
present to all the elements in common?

Then, first, we must be told what precise attribute this is and, next,
how an attribute can be a substratum.

The elements are sizeless, and how conceive an attribute where there is
neither base nor bulk?

Again, if the quality possesses determination, it is not Matter the
undetermined; and anything without determination is not a quality but is
the substratum- the very Matter we are seeking.

It may be suggested that perhaps this absence of quality means simply
that, of its own nature, it has no participation in any of the set and
familiar properties, but takes quality by this very non-participation,
holding thus an absolutely individual character, marked off from
everything else, being as it were the negation of those others.
Deprivation, we will be told, comports quality: a blind man has the
quality of his lack of sight. If then- it will be urged- Matter exhibits
such a negation, surely it has a quality, all the more so, assuming any
deprivation to be a quality, in that here the deprivation is all
comprehensive.

But this notion reduces all existence to qualified things or qualities:
Quantity itself becomes a Quality and so does even Existence. Now this
cannot be: if such things as Quantity and Existence are qualified, they
are, by that very fact, not qualities: Quality is an addition to them;
we must not commit the absurdity of giving the name Quality to something
distinguishable from Quality, something therefore that is not Quality.

Is it suggested that its mere Alienism is a quality in Matter?

If this Alienism is difference-absolute \[the abstract entity\] it
possesses no Quality: absolute Quality cannot be itself a qualified
thing.

If the Alienism is to be understood as meaning only that Matter is
differentiated, then it is different not by itself \[since it is
certainly not an absolute\] but by this Difference, just as all
identical objects are so by virtue of Identicalness \[the Absolute
principle of Identity\].

An absence is neither a Quality nor a qualified entity; it is the
negation of a Quality or of something else, as noiselessness is the
negation of noise and so on. A lack is negative; Quality demands
something positive. The distinctive character of Matter is unshape, the
lack of qualification and of form; surely then it is absurd to pretend
that it has Quality in not being qualified; that is like saying that
sizelessness constitutes a certain size.

The distinctive character of Matter, then, is simply its manner of
being- not something definite inserted in it but, rather a relation
towards other things, the relation of being distinct from them.

Other things possess something besides this relation of Alienism: their
form makes each an entity. Matter may with propriety be described as
merely alien; perhaps, even, we might describe it as "The Aliens," for
the singular suggests a certain definiteness while the plural would
indicate the absence of any determination.
