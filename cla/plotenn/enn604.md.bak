#### Section 15

15\. But how did this intruder find entrance?

It had a certain aptitude and it grasped at that to which it was apt. In
its nature it was capable of soul: but what is unfitted to receive soul
entire- present entire but not for it- takes what share it may; such are
the members of the animal and vegetal order. Similarly, of a significant
sound, some forms of being take sound and significance together, others
only the sound, the blank impact.

A living thing comes into existence containing soul, present to it from
the Authentic, and by soul is inbound with Reality entire; it possesses
also a body; but this body is not a husk having no part in soul, not a
thing that earlier lay away in the soulless; the body had its aptitude
and by this draws near: now it is not body merely, but living body. By
this neighboring it is enhanced with some impress of soul- not in the
sense of a portion of soul entering into it, but that it is warmed and
lit by soul entire: at once there is the ground of desire, pleasure,
pain; the body of the living form that has come to be was certainly no
unrelated thing.

The soul, sprung from the divine, lay self-enclosed at peace, true to
its own quality; but its neighbour, in uproar through weakness, instable
of its own nature and beaten upon from without, cries, at first to
itself and afterwards upon the living total, spreading the disorder at
large. Thus, at an assembly the Elders may sit in tranquil meditation,
but an unruly populace, crying for food and casting up a host of
grievances, will bring the whole gathering into ugly turmoil; when this
sort of people hold their peace so that a word from a man of sense may
reach them, some passable order is restored and the baser part ceases to
prevail; otherwise the silence of the better allows the rabble to rule,
the distracted assembly unable to take the word from above.

This is the evil of state and of council: and this is the evil of man;
man includes an inner rabble- pleasures, desires, fears- and these
become masters when the man, the manifold, gives them play.

But one that has reduced his rabble and gone back to the Man he was,
lives to that and is that Man again, so that what he allows to the body
is allowed as to something separate.

There is the man, too, that lives partly in the one allegiance and
partly in the other; he is a blend of the good that is himself with the
evil that is alien.
