#### Section 6

6\. Souls that descend, souls that change their state- these, then, may
be said to have memory, which deals with what has come and gone; but
what subjects of remembrance can there be for souls whose lot is to
remain unchanged?

The question touches memory in the stars in general, and also in the sun
and moon and ends by dealing with the soul of the All, even by
audaciously busying itself with the memories of Zeus himself. The
enquiry entails the examination and identification of acts of
understanding and of reasoning in these beings, if such acts take place.

Now if, immune from all lack, they neither seek nor doubt, and never
learn, nothing being absent at any time from their knowledge- what
reasonings, what processes of rational investigation, can take place in
them, what acts of the understanding?

Even as regards human concerns they have no need for observation or
method; their administration of our affairs and of earth's in general
does not go so; the right ordering, which is their gift to the universe,
is effected by methods very different.

In other words, they have seen God and they do not remember?

Ah, no: it is that they see God still and always, and that, as long as
they see, they cannot tell themselves they have had the vision; such
reminiscence is for souls that have lost it.
