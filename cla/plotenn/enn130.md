#### Section 9

9\. But how can we conceive a thing having existence without having
magnitude?

We have only to think of things whose identity does not depend on their
quantity- for certainly magnitude can be distinguished from existence as
can many other forms and attributes.

In a word, every unembodied Kind must be classed as without quantity,
and Matter is unembodied.

Besides quantitativeness itself \[the Absolute-Principle\] does not
possess quantity, which belongs only to things participating in it, a
consideration which shows that Quantitativeness is an Idea-Principle. A
white object becomes white by the presence of whiteness; what makes an
organism white or of any other variety of colour is not itself a
specific colour but, so to speak, a specific Reason-Principle: in the
same way what gives an organism a certain bulk is not itself a thing of
magnitude but is Magnitude itself, the abstract Absolute, or the
Reason-Principle.

This Magnitude-Absolute, then, enters and beats the Matter out into
Magnitude?

Not at all: the Matter was not previously shrunken small: there was no
littleness or bigness: the Idea gives Magnitude exactly as it gives
every quality not previously present.
