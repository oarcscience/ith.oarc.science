<P>24. The next question is whether perception is concerned 
only with
need.

<P>The soul, isolated, has no sense-perception; sensations go with
the body; sensation itself therefore must occur by means of the body
to which the sensations are due; it must be something 
brought about by
association with the body.

<P>Thus either sensation occurs in a soul compelled to follow upon
bodily states- since every graver bodily experience reaches 
at last to
soul- or sensation is a device by which a cause is dealt with before
it becomes so great as actually to injure us or even before it has
begun to make contact.

<P>At this, sense-impressions would aim at utility. They may serve
also to knowledge, but that could be service only to some being not
living in knowledge but stupefied as the result of a 
disaster, and the
victim of a Lethe calling for constant reminding: they would be
useless to any being free from either need or forgetfulness. 
This This
reflection enlarges the enquiry: it is no longer a question of earth
alone, but of the whole star-system, all the heavens, the kosmos
entire. For it would follow that, in the sphere of things not exempt
from modification, sense-perception would occur in every part having
relation to any other part: in a whole, however- having relation
only to itself, immune, universally self-directed and 
self-possessing-
what perception could there be?

<P>Granted that the percipient must act through an organ and that
this organ must be different from the object perceived, then the
universe, as an All, can have [no sensation since it has] no organ
distinct from object: it can have self-awareness, as we have; but
sense-perception, the constant attendant of another order, it cannot
have.

<P>Our own apprehension of any bodily condition apart from 
the normal
is the sense of something intruding from without: but 
besides this, we
have the apprehension of one member by another; why then should not
the All, by means of what is stationary in it, perceive that 
region of
itself which is in movement, that is to say the earth and the
earth's content?

<P>Things of earth are certainly affected by what passes in other
regions of the All; what, then, need prevent the All from having, in
some appropriate way, the perception of those changes? In addition
to that self-contemplating vision vested in its stationary part, may
it not have a seeing power like that of an eye able to 
announce to the
All-Soul what has passed before it? Even granted that it is entirely
unaffected by its lower, why, still, should it not see like an eye,
ensouled as it is, all lightsome?

<P>Still: "eyes were not necessary to it," we read. If this meant
simply that nothing is left to be seen outside of the All, 
still there
is the inner content, and there can be nothing to prevent it seeing
what constitutes itself: if the meaning is that such 
self-vision could
serve to no use, we may think that it has vision not as a main
intention for vision's sake but as a necessary concomitant of its
characteristic nature; it is difficult to conceive why such a body
should be incapable of seeing.
