#### Section 1

1\. In our attempt to elucidate the Essence of the soul, we show it to
be neither a material fabric nor, among immaterial things, a harmony.
The theory that it is some final development, some entelechy, we pass
by, holding this to be neither true as presented nor practically
definitive.

No doubt we make a very positive statement about it when we declare it
to belong to the Intellectual Kind, to be of the divine order; but a
deeper penetration of its nature is demanded.

In that allocation we were distinguishing things as they fall under the
Intellectual or the sensible, and we placed the soul in the former
class; now, taking its membership of the Intellectual for granted, we
must investigate by another path the more specific characteristics of
its nature.

There are, we hold, things primarily apt to partition, tending by sheer
nature towards separate existence: they are things in which no part is
identical either with another part or with the whole, while, also their
part is necessarily less than the total and whole: these are magnitudes
of the realm of sense, masses, each of which has a station of its own so
that none can be identically present in entirety at more than one point
at one time.

But to that order is opposed Essence \[Real-Being\]; this is in no
degree susceptible of partition; it is unparted and impartible; interval
is foreign to it, cannot enter into our idea of it: it has no need of
place and is not, in diffusion or as an entirety, situated within any
other being: it is poised over all beings at once, and this is not in
the sense of using them as a base but in their being neither capable nor
desirous of existing independently of it; it is an essence eternally
unvaried: it is common to all that follows upon it: it is like the
circle's centre to which all the radii are attached while leaving it
unbrokenly in possession of itself, the starting point of their course
and of their essential being, the ground in which they all participate:
thus the indivisible is the principle of these divided existences and in
their very outgoing they remain enduringly in contact with that
stationary essence.

So far we have the primarily indivisible- supreme among the Intellectual
and Authentically Existent- and we have its contrary, the Kind
definitely divisible in things of sense; but there is also another Kind,
of earlier rank than the sensible yet near to it and resident within it-
an order, not, like body, primarily a thing of part, but becoming so
upon incorporation. The bodies are separate, and the ideal form which
enters them is correspondingly sundered while, still, it is present as
one whole in each of its severed parts, since amid that multiplicity in
which complete individuality has entailed complete partition, there is a
permanent identity; we may think of colour, qualities of all kinds, some
particular shape, which can be present in many unrelated objects at the
one moment, each entire and yet with no community of experience among
the various manifestations. In the case of such ideal-forms we may
affirm complete partibility.

But, on the other hand, that first utterly indivisible Kind must be
accompanied by a subsequent Essence, engendered by it and holding
indivisibility from it but, in virtue of the necessary outgo from
source, tending firmly towards the contrary, the wholly partible; this
secondary Essence will take an intermediate Place between the first
substance, the undivided, and that which is divisible in material things
and resides in them. Its presence, however, will differ in one respect
from that of colour and quantity; these, no doubt, are present
identically and entire throughout diverse material masses, but each
several manifestation of them is as distinct from every other as the
mass is from the mass.

The magnitude present in any mass is definitely one thing, yet its
identity from part to part does not imply any such community as would
entail common experience; within that identity there is diversity, for
it is a condition only, not the actual Essence.

The Essence, very near to the impartible, which we assert to belong to
the Kind we are now dealing with, is at once an Essence and an entrant
into body; upon embodiment, it experiences a partition unknown before it
thus bestowed itself.

In whatsoever bodies it occupies- even the vastest of all, that in which
the entire universe is included- it gives itself to the whole without
abdicating its unity.

This unity of an Essence is not like that of body, which is a unit by
the mode of continuous extension, the mode of distinct parts each
occupying its own space. Nor is it such a unity as we have dealt with in
the case of quality.

The nature, at once divisible and indivisible, which we affirm to be
soul has not the unity of an extended thing: it does not consist of
separate sections; its divisibility lies in its presence at every point
of the recipient, but it is indivisible as dwelling entire in the total
and entire in any part.

To have penetrated this idea is to know the greatness of the soul and
its power, the divinity and wonder of its being, as a nature
transcending the sphere of Things.

Itself devoid of mass, it is present to all mass: it exists here and yet
is There, and this not in distinct phases but with unsundered identity:
thus it is "parted and not parted," or, better, it has never known
partition, never become a parted thing, but remains a self-gathered
integral, and is "parted among bodies" merely in the sense that bodies,
in virtue of their own sundered existence, cannot receive it unless in
some partitive mode; the partition, in other words, is an occurrence in
body not in soul.
