#### Section 11

11\. Are we, then, to conclude that particular things are determined by
Necessities rooted in Nature and by the sequence of causes, and that
everything is as good as anything can be?

No: the Reason-Principle is the sovereign, making all: it wills things
as they are and, in its reasonable act, it produces even what we know as
evil: it cannot desire all to be good: an artist would not make an
animal all eyes; and in the same way, the Reason-Principle would not
make all divine; it makes Gods but also celestial spirits, the
intermediate order, then men, then the animals; all is graded
succession, and this in no spirit of grudging but in the expression of a
Reason teeming with intellectual variety.

We are like people ignorant of painting who complain that the colours
are not beautiful everywhere in the picture: but the Artist has laid on
the appropriate tint to every spot. Or we are censuring a drama because
the persons are not all heroes but include a servant and a rustic and
some scurrilous clown; yet take away the low characters and the power of
the drama is gone; these are part and parcel of it.
