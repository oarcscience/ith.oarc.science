#### Section 9

9\. This Poros, Possession, then, is the Reason-Principle of all that
exists in the Intellectual Realm and in the supreme Intellect; but being
more diffused, kneaded out as it were, it must touch Soul, be in Soul,
\[as the next lower principle\].

For, all that lies gathered in the Intellect is native to it: nothing
enters from without; but "Poros intoxicated" is some Power deriving
satisfaction outside itself: what, then, can we understand by this
member of the Supreme filled with Nectar but a Reason-Principle falling
from a loftier essence to a lower? This means that the Reason-Principle
upon "the birth of Aphrodite" left the Intellectual for the Soul,
breaking into the garden of Zeus.

A garden is a place of beauty and a glory of wealth: all the loveliness
that Zeus maintains takes its splendour from the Reason-Principle within
him; for all this beauty is the radiation of the Divine Intellect upon
the Divine Soul, which it has penetrated. What could the Garden of Zeus
indicate but the images of his Being and the splendours of his glory?
And what could these divine splendours and beauties be but the Ideas
streaming from him?

These Reason-Principles- this Poros who is the lavishness, the abundance
of Beauty- are at one and are made manifest; this is the
Nectar-drunkenness. For the Nectar of the gods can be no other than what
the god-nature essentially demands; and this is the Reason pouring down
from the divine Mind.

The Intellectual Principle possesses Itself to satiety, but there is no
"drunken" abandonment in this possession which brings nothing alien to
it. But the Reason-Principle- as its offspring, a later hypostasis- is
already a separate Being and established in another Realm, and so is
said to lie in the garden of this Zeus who is divine Mind; and this
lying in the garden takes place at the moment when, in our way of
speaking, Aphrodite enters the realm of Being.
