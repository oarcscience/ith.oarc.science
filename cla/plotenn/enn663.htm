<P>25. It is in view, probably, of this difficulty that 
Plato, in the
Philebus, makes pleasure an element in the Term; the good is not
defined as a simplex or set in Intellectual-Principle alone; while
he rightly refrains from identifying the good with the pleasant, yet
he does not allow Intellectual-Principle, foreign to pleasure, to be
The Good, since he sees no attractive power in it. He may also have
had in mind that the good, to answer to its name, must be a thing of
delight and that an object of pursuit must at least hold 
some pleasure
for those that acquire and possess it, so that where there is no joy
the good too is absent, further that pleasure, implying pursuit,
cannot pertain to the First and that therefore good cannot.

<P>All this was very well; there the enquiry was not as to 
the Primal
Good but as to ours; the good dealt with in that passage pertains to
very different beings and therefore is a different good; it is a
good falling short of that higher; it is a mingled thing; we are to
understand that good does not hold place in the One and Alone whose
being is too great and different for that.

<P>The good must, no doubt, be a thing pursued, not, however, good
because it is pursued but pursued because it is good.

<P>The solution, it would seem, lies in priority:

<P>To the lowest of things the good is its immediate higher; each
step represents the good to what stands lower so long as the
movement does not tend awry but advances continuously towards the
superior: thus there is a halt at the Ultimate, beyond which 
no ascent
is possible: that is the First Good, the authentic, the supremely
sovereign, the source of good to the rest of things.

<P>Matter would have Forming-Idea for its good, since, were it
conscious, it would welcome that; body would look to soul, without
which it could not be or endure; soul must look to virtue; still
higher stands Intellectual-Principle; above that again is the
principle we call the Primal. Each of these progressive priors must
have act upon those minors to which they are, respectively, the
good: some will confer order and place, others life, others 
wisdom and
the good life: Intellectual-Principle will draw upon the Authentic
Good which we hold to be coterminous with it, both as being an
Activity put forth from it and as even now taking light from it.
This good we will define later.
