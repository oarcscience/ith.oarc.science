#### Section 2

2\. Our first observations must be directed to what passes in the
Sensible realm for Substance. It is, we shall agree, only by analogy
that the nature manifested in bodies is designated as Substance, and by
no means because such terms as Substance or Being tally with the notion
of bodies in flux; the proper term would be Becoming.

But Becoming is not a uniform nature; bodies comprise under the single
head simples and composites, together with accidentals or consequents,
these last themselves capable of separate classification.

Alternatively, Becoming may be divided into Matter and the Form imposed
upon Matter. These may be regarded each as a separate genus, or else
both may be brought under a single category and receive alike the name
of Substance.

But what, we may ask, have Matter and Form in common? In what sense can
Matter be conceived as a genus, and what will be its species? What is
the differentia of Matter? In which genus, Matter or Form, are we to
rank the composite of both? It may be this very composite which
constitutes the Substance manifested in bodies, neither of the
components by itself answering to the conception of Body: how, then, can
we rank them in one and the same genus as the composite? How can the
elements of a thing be brought within the same genus as the thing
itself? Yet if we begin with bodies, our first-principles will be
compounds.

Why not resort to analogy? Admitted that the classification of the
Sensible cannot proceed along the identical lines marked out for the
Intellectual: is there any reason why we should not for
Intellectual-Being substitute Matter, and for Intellectual Motion
substitute Sensible Form, which is in a sense the life and consummation
of Matter? The inertia of Matter would correspond with Stability, while
the Identity and Difference of the Intellectual would find their
counterparts in the similarity and diversity which obtain in the
Sensible realm.

But, in the first place, Matter does not possess or acquire Form as its
life or its Act; Form enters it from without, and remains foreign to its
nature. Secondly, Form in the Intellectual is an Act and a motion; in
the Sensible Motion is different from Form and accidental to it: Form in
relation to Matter approximates rather to Stability than to Motion; for
by determining Matter's indetermination it confers upon it a sort of
repose.

In the higher realm Identity and Difference presuppose a unity at once
identical and different: a thing in the lower is different only by
participation in Difference and in relation to some other thing;
Identity and Difference are here predicated of the particular, which is
not, as in that realm, a posterior.

As for Stability, how can it belong to Matter, which is distorted into
every variety of mass, receiving its forms from without, and even with
the aid of these forms incapable of offspring.

This mode of division must accordingly be abandoned.
