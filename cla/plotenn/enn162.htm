<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 7</H4>

<P>7. That this world has neither beginning nor end but exists for
ever as long as the Supreme stands is certainly no novel 
teaching. And
before this school rose it had been urged that commerce with the
body is no gain to a Soul.

<P>But to treat the human Soul as a fair presentment of the Soul of
the Universe is like picking out potters and blacksmiths and making
them warrant for discrediting an entire well-ordered city.

<P>We must recognize how different is the governance 
exercised by the
All-Soul; the relation is not the same: it is not in fetters. Among
the very great number of differences it should not have been
overlooked that the We [the human Soul] lies under fetter; 
and this in
a second limitation, for the Body-Kind, already fettered within the
All-Soul, imprisons all that it grasps.

<P>But the Soul of the Universe cannot be in bond to what itself
has bound: it is sovereign and therefore immune of the lower things,
over which we on the contrary are not masters. That in it which is
directed to the Divine and Transcendent is ever unmingled, knows no
encumbering; that in it which imparts life to the body admits
nothing bodily to itself. It is the general fact that an 
inset [as the
Body], necessarily shares the conditions of its containing principle
[as the Soul], and does not communicate its own conditions where
that principle has an independent life: thus a graft will die if the
stock dies, but the stock will live on by its proper life though the
graft wither. The fire within your own self may be quenched, but the
thing, fire, will exist still; and if fire itself were annihilated
that would make no difference to the Soul, the Soul in the Supreme,
but only to the plan of the material world; and if the other
elements sufficed to maintain a Kosmos, the Soul in the Supreme
would be unconcerned.

<P>The constitution of the All is very different from that of the
single, separate forms of life: there, the established rule 
commanding
to permanence is sovereign; here things are like deserters kept to
their own place and duty by a double bond; there is no 
outlet from the
All, and therefore no need of restraining or of driving errants back
to bounds: all remains where from the beginning the Soul's nature
appointed.

<P>The natural movement within the plan will be injurious 
to anything
whose natural tendency it opposes: one group will sweep 
bravely onward
with the great total to which it is adapted; the others, not able to
comply with the larger order, are destroyed. A great choral is
moving to its concerted plan; midway in the march, a tortoise is
intercepted; unable to get away from the choral line it is trampled
under foot; but if it could only range itself within the greater
movement it too would suffer nothing.
