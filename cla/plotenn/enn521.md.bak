#### Section 15

15\. The "category of Action":

The quantum has been regarded as a single genus on the ground that
Quantity and Number are attributes of Substance and posterior to it; the
quale has been regarded as another genus because Quality is an attribute
of Substance: on the same principle it is maintained that since activity
is an attribute of Substance, Action constitutes yet another genus.

Does then the action constitute the genus, or the activity from which
the action springs, in the same way as Quality is the genus from which
the quale is derived? Perhaps activity, action and agent should all be
embraced under a single head? But, on the one hand, the action- unlike
activity- tends to comport the agent; and on the other, it signifies
being in some activity and therefore Being-in-Act \[actual as distinct
from potential Being\]. Consequently the category will be one of Act
rather than of Action.

Act moreover incontestably manifests itself in Substance, as was found
to be the case with Quality: it is connected with Substance as being a
form of motion. But Motion is a distinct genus: for, seeing that Quality
is a distinct attribute of Substance, and Quality a distinct attribute,
and Relative takes its being from the relation of one substance to
another, there can be no reason why Motion, also an attribute of
Substance, should not also constitute a distinct genus.
