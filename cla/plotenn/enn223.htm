<P>3. That Love is a Hypostasis [a "Person"] a Real-Being 
sprung from
a Real-Being- lower than the parent but authentically existent- is
beyond doubt.

<P>For the parent-Soul was a Real-Being sprung directly from the
Act of the Hypostasis that ranks before it: it had life; it was a
constituent in the Real-Being of all that authentically is- in the
Real-Being which looks, rapt, towards the very Highest. That was the
first object of its vision; it looked towards it as towards its
good, and it rejoiced in the looking; and the quality of what it saw
was such that the contemplation could not be void of effect; 
in virtue
of that rapture, of its position in regard to its object, of the
intensity of its gaze, the Soul conceived and brought forth an
offspring worthy of itself and of the vision. Thus; there is a
strenuous activity of contemplation in the Soul; there is an 
emanation
towards it from the object contemplated; and Eros is born, the Love
which is an eye filled with its vision, a seeing that bears its
image with it; Eros taking its name, probably, from the fact that
its essential being is due to this horasis, this seeing. Of course
Love, as an emotion, will take its name from Love, the 
Person, since a
Real-Being cannot but be prior to what lacks this reality. The
mental state will be designated as Love, like the Hypostasis, though
it is no more than a particular act directed towards a particular
object; but it must not be confused with the Absolute Love, 
the Divine
Being. The Eros that belongs to the supernal Soul must be of one
temper with it; it must itself look aloft as being of the 
household of
that Soul, dependent upon that Soul, its very offspring; and 
therefore
caring for nothing but the contemplation of the Gods.

<P>Once that Soul which is the primal source of light to the
heavens is recognized as an Hypostasis standing distinct and aloof
it must be admitted that Love too is distinct and aloof though not,
perhaps, so loftily celestial a being as the Soul. Our own best we
conceive as inside ourselves and yet something apart; so, we must
think of this Love- as essentially resident where the unmingling
Soul inhabits.

<P>But besides this purest Soul, there must be also a Soul of the
All: at once there is another Love- the eye with which this second
Soul looks upwards- like the supernal Eros engendered by force of
desire. This Aphrodite, the secondary Soul, is of this Universe- not
Soul unmingled alone, not Soul, the Absolute, giving birth, 
therefore,
to the Love concerned with the universal life; no, this is the Love
presiding over marriages; but it, also, has its touch of the upward
desire; and, in the degree of that striving, it stirs and leads
upwards the Souls of the young and every Soul with which it is
incorporated in so far as there is a natural tendency to remembrance
of the divine. For every Soul is striving towards The Good, even the
mingling Soul and that of particular beings, for each holds directly
from the divine Soul, and is its offspring.
