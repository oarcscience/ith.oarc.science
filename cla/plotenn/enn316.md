#### Section 30

30\. But what of the memory of mental acts: do these also fall under the
imaging faculty?

If every mental act is accompanied by an image we may well believe that
this image, fixed and like a picture of the thought, would explain how
we remember the object of knowledge once entertained. But if there is no
such necessary image, another solution must be sought. Perhaps memory
would be the reception, into the image-taking faculty, of the
Reason-Principle which accompanies the mental conception: this mental
conception- an indivisible thing, and one that never rises to the
exterior of the consciousness- lies unknown below; the Reason-Principle
the revealer, the bridge between the concept and the image-taking
faculty exhibits the concept as in a mirror; the apprehension by the
image-taking faculty would thus constitute the enduring presence of the
concept, would be our memory of it.

This explains, also, another fact: the soul is unfailingly intent upon
intellection; only when it acts upon this image-taking faculty does its
intellection become a human perception: intellection is one thing, the
perception of an intellection is another: we are continuously intuitive
but we are not unbrokenly aware: the reason is that the recipient in us
receives from both sides, absorbing not merely intellections but also
sense-perceptions.
