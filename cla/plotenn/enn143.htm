<P>5. How can we talk of it? How can it be the Matter of 
real things?

<P>It is talked of, and it serves, precisely, as a Potentiality.

<P>And, as being a Potentiality, it is not of the order of the
thing it is to become: its existence is no more than an announcement
of a future, as it were a thrust forward to what is to come into
existence.

<P>As Potentiality then, it is not any definite thing but the
potentiality of everything: being nothing in itself- beyond 
what being
Matter amounts to- it is not in actualization. For if it 
were actually
something, that actualized something would not be Matter, or at
least not Matter out and out, but merely Matter in the limited sense
in which bronze is the matter of the statue.

<P>And its Non-Being must be no mere difference from Being.

<P>Motion, for example, is different from Being, but plays about
it, springing from it and living within it: Matter is, so to speak,
the outcast of Being, it is utterly removed, irredeemably what it
was from the beginning: in origin it was Non-Being and so it remains.

<P>Nor are we to imagine that, standing away at the very beginning
from the universal circle of Beings, it was thus necessarily 
an active
Something or that it became a Something. It has never been able to
annex for itself even a visible outline from all the forms 
under which
it has sought to creep: it has always pursued something other than
itself; it was never more than a Potentiality towards its next:
where all the circle of Being ends, there only is it manifest;
discerned underneath things produced after it, it is remoter [from
Real-Being] even than they.

<P>Grasped, then, as an underlie in each order of Being, it 
can be no
actualization of either: all that is allowed to it is to be a
Potentiality, a weak and blurred phantasm, a thing incapable of a
Shape of its own.

<P>Its actuality is that of being a phantasm, the actuality of
being a falsity; and the false in actualization is the veritably
false, which again is Authentic Non-Existence.

<P>So that Matter, as the Actualization of Non-Being, is 
all the more
decidedly Non-Being, is Authentic Non-Existence.

<P>Thus, since the very reality of its Nature is situated in
Non-Being, it is in no degree the Actualization of any 
definite Being.

<P>If it is to be present at all, it cannot be an Actualization,
for then it would not be the stray from Authentic Being which it is,
the thing having its Being in Non-Beingness: for, note, in 
the case of
things whose Being is a falsity, to take away the falsity is to take
away what Being they have, and if we introduce actualization into
things whose Being and Essence is Potentiality, we destroy the
foundation of their nature since their Being is Potentiality.

<P>If Matter is to be kept as the unchanging substratum, we 
must keep
it as Matter: that means- does it not?- that we must define it as a
Potentiality and nothing more- or refute these considerations.
