#### Section 6

6\. What, then, is the achieved Sage?

One whose Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.

It does not suffice to perfect virtue to have only this Spirit
\[equivalent in all men\] as cooperator in the life: the acting force in
the Sage is the Intellective Principle \[the diviner phase of the human
Soul\] which therefore is itself his presiding spirit or is guided by a
presiding spirit of its own, no other than the very Divinity.

But this exalts the Sage above the Intellectual Principle as possessing
for presiding spirit the Prior to the Intellectual Principle: how then
does it come about that he was not, from the very beginning, all that he
now is?

The failure is due to the disturbance caused by birth- though, before
all reasoning, there exists the instinctive movement reaching out
towards its own.

On instinct which the Sage finally rectifies in every respect?

Not in every respect: the Soul is so constituted that its life-history
and its general tendency will answer not merely to its own nature but
also to the conditions among which it acts.

The presiding Spirit, as we read, conducting a Soul to the Underworld
ceases to be its guardian- except when the Soul resumes \[in its later
choice\] the former state of life.

But, meanwhile, what happens to it?

From the passage \[in the Phaedo\] which tells how it presents the Soul
to judgement we gather that after the death it resumes the form it had
before the birth, but that then, beginning again, it is present to the
Souls in their punishment during the period of their renewed life- a
time not so much of living as of expiation.

But the Souls that enter into brute bodies, are they controlled by some
thing less than this presiding Spirit? No: theirs is still a Spirit, but
an evil or a foolish one.

And the Souls that attain to the highest?

Of these higher Souls some live in the world of Sense, some above it:
and those in the world of Sense inhabit the Sun or another of the
planetary bodies; the others occupy the fixed Sphere \[above the
planetary\] holding the place they have merited through having lived
here the superior life of reason.

We must understand that, while our Souls do contain an Intellectual
Kosmos they also contain a subordination of various forms like that of
the Kosmic Soul. The world Soul is distributed so as to produce the
fixed sphere and the planetary circuits corresponding to its graded
powers: so with our Souls; they must have their provinces according to
their different powers, parallel to those of the World Soul: each must
give out its own special act; released, each will inhabit there a star
consonant with the temperament and faculty in act within and
constituting the principle of the life; and this star or the next
highest power will stand to them as God or more exactly as tutelary
spirit.

But here some further precision is needed.

Emancipated Souls, for the whole period of their sojourn there above,
have transcended the Spirit-nature and the entire fatality of birth and
all that belongs to this visible world, for they have taken up with them
that Hypostasis of the Soul in which the desire of earthly life is
vested. This Hypostasis may be described as the distributable Soul, for
it is what enters bodily forms and multiplies itself by this division
among them. But its distribution is not a matter of magnitudes; wherever
it is present, there is the same thing present entire; its unity can
always be reconstructed: when living things- animal or vegetal- produce
their constant succession of new forms, they do so in virtue of the
self-distribution of this phase of the Soul, for it must be as much
distributed among the new forms as the propagating originals are. In
some cases it communicates its force by permanent presence the life
principle in plants for instance- in other cases it withdraws after
imparting its virtue- for instance where from the putridity of dead
animal or vegetable matter a multitudinous birth is produced from one
organism.

A power corresponding to this in the All must reach down and co-operate
in the life of our world- in fact the very same power.

If the Soul returns to this Sphere it finds itself under the same Spirit
or a new, according to the life it is to live. With this Spirit it
embarks in the skiff of the universe: the "spindle of Necessity" then
takes control and appoints the seat for the voyage, the seat of the lot
in life.

The Universal circuit is like a breeze, and the voyager, still or
stirring, is carried forward by it. He has a hundred varied experiences,
fresh sights, changing circumstances, all sorts of events. The vessel
itself furnishes incident, tossing as it drives on. And the voyager also
acts of himself in virtue of that individuality which he retains because
he is on the vessel in his own person and character. Under identical
circumstances individuals answer very differently in their movements and
acts: hence it comes about that, be the occurrences and conditions of
life similar or dissimilar, the result may differ from man to man, as on
the other hand a similar result may be produced by dissimilar
conditions: this (personal answer to incident) it is that constitutes
destiny.
