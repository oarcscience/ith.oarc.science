<P>13. (18) But how does the soul enter into body from the
aloofness of the Intellectual?

<P>There is the Intellectual-Principle which remains among the
intellectual beings, living the purely intellective life; and this,
knowing no impulse or appetite, is for ever stationary in that
Realm. But immediately following upon it, there is that which has
acquired appetite and, by this accruement, has already taken a great
step outward; it has the desire of elaborating order on the model of
what it has seen in the Intellectual-Principle: pregnant by those
Beings, and in pain to the birth, it is eager to make, to create. In
this new zest it strains towards the realm of sense: thus, while
this primal soul in union with the Soul of the All transcends the
sphere administered, it is inevitably turned outward, and has added
the universe to its concern: yet in choosing to administer 
the partial
and exiling itself to enter the place in which it finds its
appropriate task, it still is not wholly and exclusively 
held by body:
it is still in possession of the unembodied; and the
Intellectual-Principle in it remains immune. As a whole it is partly
in body, partly outside: it has plunged from among the primals and
entered this sphere of tertiaries: the process has been an 
activity of
the Intellectual-Principle, which thus, while itself remaining in
its identity, operates throughout the soul to flood the universe
with beauty and penetrant order- immortal mind, eternal in its
unfailing energy, acting through immortal soul.
