<P>6. We are led thus to the question of receptivity in things of
body.

<P>An additional proof that bodies must have some substratum
different from themselves is found in the changing of the
basic-constituents into one another. Notice that the destruction of
the elements passing over is not complete- if it were we would have
a Principle of Being wrecked in Non-being- nor does an engendered
thing pass from utter non-being into Being: what happens is 
that a new
form takes the place of an old. There is, then, a stable 
element, that
which puts off one form to receive the form of the incoming entity.

<P>The same fact is clearly established by decay, a process
implying a compound object; where there is decay there is a
distinction between Matter and Form.

<P>And the reasoning which shows the destructible to be a 
compound is
borne out by practical examples of reduction: a drinking vessel is
reduced to its gold, the gold to liquid; analogy forces us to
believe that the liquid too is reducible.

<P>The basic-constituents of things must be either their 
Form-Idea or
that Primal Matter [of the Intelligible] or a compound of 
the Form and
Matter.

<P>Form-Idea, pure and simple, they cannot be: for without 
Matter how
could things stand in their mass and magnitude?

<P>Neither can they be that Primal Matter, for they are not
indestructible.

<P>They must, therefore, consist of Matter and Form-Idea- Form for
quality and shape, Matter for the base, indeterminate as being other
than Idea.
