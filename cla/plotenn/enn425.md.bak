#### Section 10

10\. We have shown the inevitability of certain convictions as to the
scheme of things:

There exists a Principle which transcends Being; this is The One, whose
nature we have sought to establish in so far as such matters lend
themselves to proof. Upon The One follows immediately the Principle
which is at once Being and the Intellectual-Principle. Third comes the
Principle, Soul.

Now just as these three exist for the system of Nature, so, we must
hold, they exist for ourselves. I am not speaking of the material order-
all that is separable- but of what lies beyond the sense realm in the
same way as the Primals are beyond all the heavens; I mean the
corresponding aspect of man, what Plato calls the Interior Man.

Thus our soul, too, is a divine thing, belonging to another order than
sense; such is all that holds the rank of soul, but \[above the
life-principle\] there is the soul perfected as containing
Intellectual-Principle with its double phase, reasoning and giving the
power to reason. The reasoning phase of the soul, needing no bodily
organ for its thinking but maintaining, in purity, its distinctive Act
that its thought may be uncontaminated- this we cannot err in placing,
separate and not mingled into body, within the first Intellectual. We
may not seek any point of space in which to seat it; it must be set
outside of all space: its distinct quality, its separateness, its
immateriality, demand that it be a thing alone, untouched by all of the
bodily order. This is why we read of the universe that the Demiurge cast
the soul around it from without- understand that phase of soul which is
permanently seated in the Intellectual- and of ourselves that the
charioteer's head reaches upwards towards the heights.

The admonition to sever soul from body is not, of course, to be
understood spatially- that separation stands made in Nature- the
reference is to holding our rank, to use of our thinking, to an attitude
of alienation from the body in the effort to lead up and attach to the
over-world, equally with the other, that phase of soul seated here and,
alone, having to do with body, creating, moulding, spending its care
upon it.
