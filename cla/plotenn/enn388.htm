<P>8. B. (10) If the soul is body and permeates the entire 
body-mass,
still even in this entire permeation the blending must be in accord
with what occurs in all cases of bodily admixing.

<P>Now: if in the admixing of bodies neither constituent can retain
its efficacy, the soul too could no longer be effective within the
bodies; it could but be latent; it will have lost that by which it
is soul, just as in an admixture of sweet and bitter the sweet
disappears: we have, thus, no soul.

<P>Two bodies [i.e., by hypothesis, the soul and the human body]
are blended, each entire through the entirety of the other; where
the one is, the other is also; each occupies an equal extension and
each the whole extension; no increase of size has been caused by the
juncture: the one body thus inblended can have left in the other
nothing undivided. This is no case of mixing in the sense of
considerable portions alternating; that would be described as
collocation; no; the incoming entity goes through the other to the
very minutest point- an impossibility, of course; the less becoming
equal to the greater; still, all is traversed throughout and divided
throughout. Now if, thus, the inblending is to occur point by point,
leaving no undivided material anywhere, the division of the body
concerned must have been a division into (geometrical) points: an
impossibility. The division is an infinite series- any material
particle may be cut in two- and the infinities are not merely
potential, they are actual.

<P>Therefore body cannot traverse anything as a whole traversing a
whole. But soul does this. It is therefore incorporeal.
