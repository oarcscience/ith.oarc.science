#### Section 29

29\. Are we, then, to refer memory to the perceptive faculty and so make
one principle of our nature the seat of both awareness and remembrance?

Now supposing the very Shade, as we were saying in the case of Hercules,
has memory, then the perceptive faculty is twofold.

\[(And if (on the same supposition) the faculty that remembers is not
the faculty that perceives, but some other thing, then the remembering
faculty is twofold.\]

And further if the perceptive faculty \[= the memory\] deals with
matters learned \[as well as with matters of observation and feeling\]
it will be the faculty for the processes of reason also: but these two
orders certainly require two separate faculties.

Must we then suppose a common faculty of apprehension \[one covering
both sense perceptions and ideas\] and assign memory in both orders to
this?

The solution might serve if there were one and the same percipient for
objects of sense and objects of the Intellectual-Kind; but if these
stand in definite duality, then, for all we can say or do, we are left
with two separate principles of memory; and, supposing each of the two
orders of soul to possess both principles, then we have four.

And, on general grounds, what compelling reason is there that the
principle by which we perceive should be the principle by which we
remember, that these two acts should be vested in the one faculty? Why
must the seat of our intellectual action be also the seat of our
remembrance of that action? The most powerful thought does not always go
with the readiest memory; people of equal perception are not equally
good at remembering; some are especially gifted in perception, others,
never swift to grasp, are strong to retain.

But, once more, admitting two distinct principles, something quite
separate remembering what sense-perception has first known- still this
something must have felt what it is required to remember?

No; we may well conceive that where there is to be memory of a
sense-perception, this perception becomes a mere presentment, and that
to this image-grasping power, a distinct thing, belongs the memory, the
retention of the object: for in this imaging faculty the perception
culminates; the impression passes away but the vision remains present to
the imagination.

By the fact of harbouring the presentment of an object that has
disappeared, the imagination is, at once, a seat of memory: where the
persistence of the image is brief, the memory is poor; people of
powerful memory are those in whom the image-holding power is firmer, not
easily allowing the record to be jostled out of its grip.

Remembrance, thus, is vested in the imaging faculty; and memory deals
with images. Its differing quality or degree from man to man, we would
explain by difference or similarity in the strength of the individual
powers, by conduct like or unlike, by bodily conditions present or
absent, producing change and disorder or not- a point this, however,
which need not detain us here.
