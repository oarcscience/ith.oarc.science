<P>17. But in what mode are these secondaries, and
Intellectual-Principle itself, within the First? They are not in the
Filling Principle; they are not in the filled since before 
that moment
it did not contain them.

<P>Giving need not comport possessing; in this order we are to
think of a giver as a greater and of a gift as a lower; this is the
meaning of origin among real Beings. First there must be an 
actualized
thing; its laters must be potentially their own priors; a first must
transcend its derivatives; the giver transcends the given, as a
superior. If therefore there is a prior to actuality, that prior
transcends Activity and so transcends Life. Our sphere containing
life, there is a Giver of Life, a principle of greater good, of
greater worth than Life; this possessed Life and had no need to look
for it to any giver in possession of Life's variety.

<P>But the Life was a vestige of that Primal not a life lived by
it; Life, then, as it looked towards That was undetermined; having
looked it had determination though That had none. Life looks to
unity and is determined by it, taking bound, limit, form. But this
form is in the shaped, the shaper had none; the limit was 
not external
as something drawn about a magnitude; the limit was that of the
multiplicity of the Life There, limitless itself as radiated from
its great Prior; the Life itself was not that of some determined
being, or it would be no more than the life of an individual. Yet it
is defined; it must then have been defined as the Life of a unity
including multiplicity; certainly too each item of the 
multiplicity is
determined, determined as multiple by the multiplicity of Life but
as a unity by the fact of limit.

<P>As what, then, is its unity determined?

<P>As Intellectual-Principle: determined Life is
Intellectual-Principle. And the multiplicity?

<P>As the multiplicity of Intellectual-Principles: all its
multiplicity resolves itself into Intellectual-Principles- on the
one hand the collective Principle, on the other the particular
Principles.

<P>But does this collective Intellectual-Principle include each of
the particular Principles as identical with itself?

<P>No: it would be thus the container of only the one thing; since
there are many Intellectual-Principles within the collective, there
must be differentiation.

<P>Once more, how does the particular Intellect come to this
differentiation?

<P>It takes its characteristic difference by becoming entirely a
unity within the collective whose totality could not be 
identical with
any particular.

<P>Thus the Life in the Supreme was the collectivity of power; the
vision taking place There was the potentiality of all;
Intellectual-Principle, thus arising, is manifested as this universe
of Being. It stands over the Beings not as itself requiring base but
that it may serve as base to the Form of the Firsts, the Formless
Form. And it takes position towards the soul, becoming a light to
the soul as itself finds its light in the First; whenever
Intellectual-Principle becomes the determinant of soul it shapes it
into Reasoning Soul, by communicating a trace of what itself has
come to possess.

<P>Thus Intellectual-Principle is a vestige of the Supreme; 
but since
the vestige is a Form going out into extension, into plurality, that
Prior, as the source of Form, must be itself without shape and Form:
if the Prior were a Form, the Intellectual-Principle itself could be
only a Reason-Principle. It was necessary that The First be utterly
without multiplicity, for otherwise it must be again referred to a
prior.
