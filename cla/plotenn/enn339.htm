<P>20. As with bodily pain and pleasure so with the bodily desires;
their origin, also, must be attributed to what thus stands midway,
to that Nature we described as the corporeal.

<P>Body undetermined cannot be imagined to give rise to appetite
and purpose, nor can pure soul be occupied about sweet and 
bitter: all
this must belong to what is specifically body but chooses to be
something else as well, and so has acquired a restless movement
unknown to the soul and by that acquisition is forced to aim at a
variety of objects, to seek, as its changing states demand, sweet or
bitter, water or warmth, with none of which it could have any
concern if it remained untouched by life.

<P>In the case of pleasure and pain we showed how upon distress
follows the knowledge of it, and that the soul, seeking to alienate
what is causing the condition, inspires a withdrawal which the
member primarily affected has itself indicated, in its own mode, by
its contraction. Similarly in the case of desire: there is the
knowledge in the sensation [the sensitive phase of the soul] and in
the next lower phase, that described as the "Nature" which 
carries the
imprint of the soul to the body; that Nature knows the fully formed
desire which is the culmination of the less formed desire in body;
sensation knows the image thence imprinted upon the Nature; and from
the moment of the sensation the soul, which alone is competent, acts
upon it, sometimes procuring, sometimes on the contrary resisting,
taking control and paying heed neither to that which originated the
desire nor to that which subsequently entertained it.

<P>But why, thus, two phases of desire; why should not the body as
a determined entity [the living total] be the sole desirer?

<P>Because there are [in man] two distinct things, this Nature and
the body, which, through it, becomes a living being: the Nature
precedes the determined body which is its creation, made and 
shaped by
it; it cannot originate the desires; they must belong to the living
body meeting the experiences of this life and seeking in its
distress to alter its state, to substitute pleasure for pain,
sufficiency for want: this Nature must be like a mother reading the
wishes of a suffering child, and seeking to set it right and to
bring it back to herself; in her search for the remedy she attaches
herself by that very concern to the sufferer's desire and makes the
child's experience her own.

<P>In sum, the living body may be said to desire of its own 
motion in
a fore-desiring with, perhaps, purpose as well; Nature desires for,
and because of, that living body; granting or withholding belongs to
another again, the higher soul.
