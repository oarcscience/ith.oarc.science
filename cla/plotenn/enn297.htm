<P>11. I think, therefore, that those ancient sages, who sought to
secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and
statues, showed insight into the nature of the All; they perceived
that, though this Soul is everywhere tractable, its presence will be
secured all the more readily when an appropriate receptacle is
elaborated, a place especially capable of receiving some portion or
phase of it, something reproducing it, or representing it, 
and serving
like a mirror to catch an image of it.

<P>It belongs to the nature of the All to make its entire content
reproduce, most felicitously, the Reason-Principles in which it
participates; every particular thing is the image within matter of a
Reason-Principle which itself images a pre-material
Reason-Principle: thus every particular entity is linked to that
Divine Being in whose likeness it is made, the divine principle
which the soul contemplated and contained in the act of each 
creation.
Such mediation and representation there must have been since it was
equally impossible for the created to be without share in 
the Supreme,
and for the Supreme to descend into the created.

<P>The Intellectual-Principle in the Supreme has ever been 
the sun of
that sphere- let us accept that as the type of the creative 
Logos- and
immediately upon it follows the Soul depending from it, stationary
Soul from stationary Intelligence. But the Soul borders also upon
the sun of this sphere, and it becomes the medium by which all is
linked to the overworld; it plays the part of an interpreter
between what emanates from that sphere down to this lower universe,
and what rises- as far as, through soul, anything can- from the
lower to the highest.

<P>Nothing, in fact, is far away from anything; things are not
remote: there is, no doubt, the aloofness of difference and 
of mingled
natures as against the unmingled; but selfhood has nothing to do
with spatial position, and in unity itself there may still be
distinction.

<P>These Beings [the Reason-Principles of this sphere] are divine
in virtue of cleaving to the Supreme, because, by the medium of the
Soul thought of as descending they remain linked with the 
Primal Soul,
and through it are veritably what they are called and possess the
vision of the Intellectual Principle, the single object of
contemplation to that soul in which they have their being.
