#### Section 12

12\. Suppose this Universe were the direct creation of the
Reason-Principle applying itself, quite unchanged, to Matter, retaining,
that is, the hostility to partition which it derives from its Prior, the
Intellectual Principle- then, this its product, so produced, would be of
supreme and unparalleled excellence. But the Reason-Principle could not
be a thing of entire identity or even of closely compact diversity; and
the mode in which it is here manifested is no matter of censure since
its function is to be all things, each single thing in some distinctive
way.

But has it not, besides itself entering Matter, brought other beings
down? Has it not for example brought Souls into Matter and, in adapting
them to its creation, twisted them against their own nature and been the
ruin of many of them? And can this be right?

The answer is that the Souls are, in a fair sense, members of this
Reason-Principle and that it has not adapted them to the creation by
perverting them, but has set them in the place here to which their
quality entitles them.
