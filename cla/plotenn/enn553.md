#### Section 16

16\. As for Relation, manifestly an offshoot, how can it be included
among primaries? Relation is of thing ranged against thing; it is not
self-pivoted, but looks outward.

Place and Date are still more remote from Being. Place denotes the
presence of one entity within another, so that it involves a duality;
but a genus must be a unity, not a composite. Besides, Place does not
exist in the higher sphere, and the present discussion is concerned with
the realm of True Being.

Whether time is There, remains to be considered. Apparently it has less
claim than even Place. If it is a measurement, and that a measurement of
Motion, we have two entities; the whole is a composite and posterior to
Motion; therefore it is not on an equal footing with Motion in our
classification.

Action and Passivity presuppose Motion; if, then, they exist in the
higher sphere, they each involve a duality; neither is a simplex.

Possession is a duality, while Situation, as signifying one thing
situated in another, is a threefold conception.
