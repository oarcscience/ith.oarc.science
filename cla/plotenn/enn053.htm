<P>4. Still the one life has known pleasure longer than the other?

<P>But pleasure cannot be fairly reckoned in with Happiness- unless
indeed by pleasure is meant the unhindered Act [of the true man], in
which case this pleasure is simply our "Happiness." And even 
pleasure,
though it exist continuously, has never anything but the present;
its past is over and done with.
