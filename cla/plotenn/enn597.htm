<P>8. The light of our world can be allocated because it 
springs from
a corporeal mass of known position, but conceive an 
immaterial entity,
independent of body as being of earlier nature than all 
body, a nature
firmly self-based or, better, without need of base: such a
principle, incorporeal, autonomous, having no source for its rising,
coming from no place, attached to no material mass, this cannot be
allotted part here and part there: that would be to give it both a
previous position and a present attachment. Finally, anything
participating in such a principle can participate only as entirety
with entirety; there can be no allotment and no partition.

<P>A principle attached to body might be exposed, at least by way
of accident, to such partition and so be definable as passive and
partible in view of its close relationship with the body of which it
is so to speak a state or a Form; but that which is not inbound with
body, which on the contrary body must seek, will of necessity go
utterly free of every bodily modification and especially of the very
possibility of partition which is entirely a phenomenon of body,
belonging to its very essence. As partibility goes with body, so
impartibility with the bodiless: what partition is possible where
there is no magnitude? If a thing of magnitude participates to any
degree in what has no magnitude, it must be by a 
participation without
division; divisibility implies magnitude.

<P>When we affirm unity in multiplicity, we do not mean that the
unity has become the multiples; we link the variety in the multiples
with the unity which we discern, undivided, in them; and the unity
must be understood as for ever distinct from them, from separate
item and from total; that unity remains true to itself, remains
itself, and so long as it remains itself cannot fail within its own
scope [and therefore does reach over the multiple], yet it is not to
be thought of as coextensive with the material universe or with any
member of the All; utterly outside of the quantitative, it cannot be
coextensive with anything.

<P>Extension is of body; what is not of body, but of the opposed
order, must be kept free of extension; but where there is no 
extension
there is no spatial distinction, nothing of the here and there which
would end its freedom of presence. Since, then, partition goes with
place- each part occupying a place of its own- how can the placeless
be parted? The unity must remain self-concentrated, immune from
part, however much the multiple aspire or attain to contact with it.
This means that any movement towards it is movement towards its
entirety, and any participation attained is participation in its
entirety. Its participants, then, link with it as with something
unparticipated, something never appropriated: thus only can it
remain intact within itself and within the multiples in which it is
manifested. And if it did not remain thus intact, it would 
cease to be
itself; any participation, then, would not be in the object of quest
but in something never quested.
