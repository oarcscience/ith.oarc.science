#### Section 2

2.... For in any one science the reduction of the total of knowledge
into its separate propositions does not shatter its unity, chipping it
into unrelated fragments; in each distinct item is talent the entire
body of the science, an integral thing in its highest Principle and its
last detail: and similarly a man must so discipline himself that the
first Principles of his Being are also his completions, are totals, that
all be pointed towards the loftiest phase of the Nature: when a man has
become this unity in the best, he is in that other realm; for it is by
this highest within himself, made his own, that he holds to the Supreme.

At no point did the All-Soul come into Being: it never arrived, for it
never knew place; what happens is that body, neighbouring with it,
participates in it: hence Plato does not place Soul in body but body in
Soul. The others, the secondary Souls, have a point of departure- they
come from the All-Soul- and they have a Place into which to descend and
in which to change to and fro, a place, therefore, from which to ascend:
but this All-Soul is for ever Above, resting in that Being in which it
holds its existence as Soul and followed, as next, by the Universe or,
at least, by all beneath the sun.

The partial Soul is illuminated by moving towards the Soul above it; for
on that path it meets Authentic Existence. Movement towards the lower is
towards non-Being: and this is the step it takes when it is set on self;
for by willing towards itself it produces its lower, an image of itself-
a non-Being- and so is wandering, as it were, into the void, stripping
itself of its own determined form. And this image, this undetermined
thing, is blank darkness, for it is utterly without reason, untouched by
the Intellectual-Principle, far removed from Authentic Being.

As long as it remains at the mid-stage it is in its own peculiar region;
but when, by a sort of inferior orientation, it looks downward, it
shapes that lower image and flings itself joyfully thither.
