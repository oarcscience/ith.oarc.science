<P>17. Why are not beauty, goodness and the virtues, together with
knowledge and intelligence, included among the primary genera?

<P>If by goodness we mean The First- what we call the Principle of
Goodness, the Principle of which we can predicate nothing, giving it
this name only because we have no other means of indicating it- then
goodness, clearly, can be the genus of nothing: this principle is
not affirmed of other things; if it were, each of these would be
Goodness itself. The truth is that it is prior to Substance, not
contained in it. If, on the contrary, we mean goodness as a quality,
no quality can be ranked among the primaries.

<P>Does this imply that the nature of Being is not good? 
Not good, to
begin with, in the sense in which The First is good, but in another
sense of the word: moreover, Being does not possess its goodness as
a quality but as a constituent.

<P>But the other genera too, we said, are constituents of Being,
and are regarded as genera because each is a common property found
in many things. If then goodness is similarly observed in every part
of Substance or Being, or in most parts, why is goodness not a
genus, and a primary genus? Because it is not found identical in all
the parts of Being, but appears in degrees, first, second and
subsequent, whether it be because one part is derived from another-
posterior from prior- or because all are posterior to the 
transcendent
Unity, different parts of Being participating in it in 
diverse degrees
corresponding to their characteristic natures.

<P>If however we must make goodness a genus as well [as a
transcendent source], it will be a posterior genus, for goodness is
posterior to Substance and posterior to what constitutes the generic
notion of Being, however unfailingly it be found associated with
Being; but the Primaries, we decided, belong to Being as such, and
go to form Substance.

<P>This indeed is why we posit that which transcends Being, since
Being and Substance cannot but be a plurality, necessarily
comprising the genera enumerated and therefore forming a 
one-and-many.

<P>It is true that we do not hesitate to speak of the goodness
inherent in Being" when we are thinking of that Act by which Being
tends, of its nature, towards the One: thus, we affirm goodness of
it in the sense that it is thereby moulded into the likeness of The
Good. But if this "goodness inherent in Being" is an Act directed
toward The Good, it is the life of Being: but this life is 
Motion, and
Motion is already one of the genera.
