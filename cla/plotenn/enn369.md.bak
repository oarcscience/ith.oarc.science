#### Section 4

4\. But there is the question of the linked light that must relate the
visual organ to its object.

Now, firstly: since the intervening air is not necessary- unless in the
purely accidental sense that air may be necessary to light- the light
that acts as intermediate in vision will be unmodified: vision depends
upon no modification whatever. This one intermediate, light, would seem
to be necessary, but, unless light is corporeal, no intervening body is
requisite: and we must remember that intervenient and borrowed light is
essential not to seeing in general but to distant vision; the question
whether light absolutely requires the presence of air we will discuss
later. For the present one matter must occupy us:

If, in the act of vision, that linked light becomes ensouled, if the
soul or mind permeates it and enters into union with it, as it does in
its more inward acts such as understanding- which is what vision really
is- then the intervening light is not a necessity: the process of seeing
will be like that of touch; the visual faculty of the soul will perceive
by the fact of having entered into the light; all that intervenes
remains unaffected, serving simply as the field over which the vision
ranges.

This brings up the question whether the sight is made active over its
field by the sheer presence of a distance spread before it, or by the
presence of a body of some kind within that distance.

If by the presence of such a body, then there will be vision though
there be no intervenient; if the intervenient is the sole attractive
agent, then we are forced to think of the visible object as being a Kind
utterly without energy, performing no act. But so inactive a body cannot
be: touch tells us that, for it does not merely announce that something
is by and is touched: it is acted upon by the object so that it reports
distinguishing qualities in it, qualities so effective that even at a
distance touch itself would register them but for the accidental that it
demands proximity.

We catch the heat of a fire just as soon as the intervening air does; no
need to wait for it to be warmed: the denser body, in fact, takes in
more warmth than the air has to give; in other words, the air transmits
the heat but is not the source of our warmth.

When on the one side, that of the object, there is the power in any
degree of an outgoing act, and on the other, that of the sight, the
capability of being acted upon, surely the object needs no medium
through which to be effective upon what it is fully equipped to affect:
this would be needing not a help but a hindrance.

Or, again, consider the Dawn: there is no need that the light first
flood the air and then come to us; the event is simultaneous to both:
often, in fact, we see \[in the distance\] when the light is not as yet
round our eyes at all but very far off, before, that is, the air has
been acted upon: here we have vision without any modified intervenient,
vision before the organ has received the light with which it is to be
linked.

It is difficult to reconcile with this theory the fact of seeing stars
or any fire by night.

If \[as by the theory of an intervenient\] the percipient mind or soul
remains within itself and needs the light only as one might need a stick
in the hand to touch something at a distance, then the perception will
be a sort of tussle: the light must be conceived as something thrusting,
something aimed at a mark, and similarly, the object, considered as an
illuminated thing, must be conceived to be resistant; for this is the
normal process in the case of contact by the agency of an intervenient.

Besides, even on this explanation, the mind must have previously been in
contact with the object in the entire absence of intervenient; only if
that has happened could contact through an intervenient bring knowledge,
a knowledge by way of memory, and, even more emphatically, by way of
reasoned comparison \[ending in identification\]: but this process of
memory and comparison is excluded by the theory of first knowledge
through the agency of a medium.

Finally, we may be told that the impinging light is modified by the
thing to be seen and so becomes able to present something perceptible
before the visual organ; but this simply brings us back to the theory of
an intervenient changed midway by the object, an explanation whose
difficulties we have already indicated.
