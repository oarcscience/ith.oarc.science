#### Section 13

13\. And the principle that reasons out these matters? Is it We or the
Soul?

We, but by the Soul.

But how "by the Soul"? Does this mean that the Soul reasons by
possession \[by contact with the matters of enquiry\]?

No; by the fact of being Soul. Its Act subsists without movement; or any
movement that can be ascribed to it must be utterly distinct from all
corporal movement and be simply the Soul's own life.

And Intellection in us is twofold: since the Soul is intellective, and
Intellection is the highest phase of life, we have Intellection both by
the characteristic Act of our Soul and by the Act of the
Intellectual-Principle upon us- for this Intellectual-Principle is part
of us no less than the Soul, and towards it we are ever rising.
