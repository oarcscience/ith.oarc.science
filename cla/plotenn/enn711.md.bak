#### Section 8

8\. Every soul that knows its history is aware, also, that its movement,
unthwarted, is not that of an outgoing line; its natural course may be
likened to that in which a circle turns not upon some external but on
its own centre, the point to which it owes its rise. The soul's movement
will be about its source; to this it will hold, poised intent towards
that unity to which all souls should move and the divine souls always
move, divine in virtue of that movement; for to be a god is to be
integral with the Supreme; what stands away is man still multiple, or
beast.

Is then this "centre" of our souls the Principle for which we are
seeking?

We must look yet further: we must admit a Principle in which all these
centres coincide: it will be a centre by analogy with the centre of the
circle we know. The soul is not a circle in the sense of the geometric
figure but in that it at once contains the Primal Nature \[as centre\]
and is contained by it \[as circumference\], that it owes its origin to
such a centre and still more that the soul, uncontaminated, is a
self-contained entity.

In our present state- part of our being weighed down by the body, as one
might have the feet under water with all the rest untouched- we bear-
ourselves aloft by that- intact part and, in that, hold through our own
centre to the centre of all the centres, just as the centres of the
great circles of a sphere coincide with that of the sphere to which all
belong. Thus we are secure.

If these circles were material and not spiritual, the link with the
centres would be local; they would lie round it where it lay at some
distant point: since the souls are of the Intellectual, and the Supreme
still loftier, we understand that contact is otherwise procured, that is
by those powers which connect Intellectual agent with Intellectual
Object; this all the more, since the Intellect grasps the Intellectual
object by the way of similarity, identity, in the sure link of kindred.
Material mass cannot blend into other material mass: unbodied beings are
not under this bodily limitation; their separation is solely that of
otherness, of differentiation; in the absence of otherness, it is
similars mutually present.

Thus the Supreme as containing no otherness is ever present with us; we
with it when we put otherness away. It is not that the Supreme reaches
out to us seeking our communion: we reach towards the Supreme; it is we
that become present. We are always before it: but we do not always look:
thus a choir, singing set in due order about the conductor, may turn
away from that centre to which all should attend: let it but face aright
and it sings with beauty, present effectively. We are ever before the
Supreme- cut off is utter dissolution; we can no longer be- but we do
not always attend: when we look, our Term is attained; this is rest;
this is the end of singing ill; effectively before Him, we lift a choral
song full of God.
