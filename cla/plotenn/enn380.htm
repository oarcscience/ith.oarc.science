<P>2. But of what nature is this sovereign principle?

<P>If material, then definitely it must fall apart; for every
material entity, at least, is something put together.

<P>If it is not material but belongs to some other Kind, that new
substance must be investigated in the same way or by some more
suitable method.

<P>But our first need is to discover into what this material form,
since such the soul is to be, can dissolve.

<P>Now: of necessity life is inherent to soul: this material
entity, then, which we call soul must have life ingrained within it;
but [being a composite as by hypothesis, material] it must be made
up of two or more bodies; that life, then, will be vested, either in
each and all of those bodies or in one of them to the 
exclusion of the
other or others; if this be not so, then there is no life present
anywhere.

<P>If any one of them contains this ingrained life, that one is the
soul. But what sort of an entity have we there; what is this body
which of its own nature possesses soul?

<P>Fire, air, water, earth, are in themselves soulless- 
whenever soul
is in any of them, that life is borrowed- and there are no 
other forms
of body than these four: even the school that believes there are has
always held them to be bodies, not souls, and to be without life.

<P>None of these, then, having life, it would be extraordinary if
life came about by bringing them together; it is impossible, in
fact, that the collocation of material entities should produce life,
or mindless entities mind.

<P>No one, moreover, would pretend that a mere chance mixing could
give such results: some regulating principle would be necessary,
some Cause directing the admixture: that guiding principle would be-
soul.

<P>Body- not merely because it is a composite, but even were it
simplex- could not exist unless there were soul in the universe, for
body owes its being to the entrance of a Reason-Principle 
into Matter,
and only from soul can a Reason-Principle come.
