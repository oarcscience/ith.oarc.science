<P>7. The contemplating of God, we might answer.

<P>But to admit its knowing God is to be compelled to admit its
self-knowing. It will know what it holds from God, what God has
given forth or may; with this knowledge, it knows itself at the
stroke, for it is itself one of those given things- in fact is all
of them. Knowing God and His power, then, it knows itself, since it
comes from Him and carries His power upon it; if, because 
here the act
of vision is identical with the object, it is unable to see God
clearly, then all the more, by the equation of seeing and 
seen, we are
driven back upon that self-seeing and self-knowing in which 
seeing and
thing seen are undistinguishably one thing.

<P>And what else is there to attribute to it?

<P>Repose, no doubt; but, to an Intellectual-Principle, 
Repose is not
an abdication from intellect; its Repose is an Act, the act of
abstention from the alien: in all forms of existence repose from the
alien leaves the characteristic activity intact, especially where
the Being is not merely potential but fully realized.

<P>In the Intellectual-Principle, the Being is an Act and in the
absence of any other object it must be self-directed; by this
self-intellection it holds its Act within itself and upon itself;
all that can emanate from it is produced by this self-centering and
self-intention; first- self-gathered, it then gives itself or gives
something in its likeness; fire must first be self-centred and be
fire, true to fire's natural Act; then it may reproduce itself
elsewhere.

<P>Once more, then; the Intellectual-Principle is a self-intent
activity, but soul has the double phase, one inner, intent upon the
Intellectual-Principle, the other outside it and facing to the
external; by the one it holds the likeness to its source; by the
other, even in its unlikeness, it still comes to likeness in this
sphere, too, by virtue of action and production; in its action it
still contemplates, and its production produces Ideal-forms- divine
intellections perfectly wrought out- so that all its creations are
representations of the divine Intellection and of the divine
Intellect, moulded upon the archetype, of which all are 
emanations and
images, the nearer more true, the very latest preserving some faint
likeness of the source.
