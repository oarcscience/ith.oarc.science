<P>14. Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights,
gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from
here and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those
other Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul. This is
probably the secret of the myth in which, after Prometheus 
had moulded
woman, the other gods heaped gifts upon her, Hephaistos "blending
the clay with moisture and bestowing the human voice and the 
form of a
goddess"; Aphrodite bringing her gifts, and the Graces theirs, and
other gods other gifts, and finally calling her by the name
[Pandora] which tells of gift and of all giving- for all have added
something to this formation brought to being by a Promethean, a
fore-thinking power. As for the rejection of Prometheus' gift by
after-thought, Epimetheus, what can this signify but that the wiser
choice is to remain in the Intellectual realm? Pandora's creator is
fettered, to signify that he is in some sense held by his own
creation; such a fettering is external and the release by Hercules
tells that there is power in Prometheus, so that he need not 
remain in
bonds.

<P>Take the myth as we may, it is certainly such an account of the
bestowal of gifts upon the kosmos as harmonizes with our explanation
of the universal system.
