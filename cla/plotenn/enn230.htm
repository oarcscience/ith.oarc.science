<P>10. "Our way of speaking"- for myths, if they are to serve their
purpose, must necessarily import time-distinctions into their
subject and will often present as separate, Powers which exist in
unity but differ in rank and faculty; they will relate the births of
the unbegotten and discriminate where all is one substance; the
truth is conveyed in the only manner possible, it is left to our
good sense to bring all together again.

<P>On this principle we have, here, Soul dwelling with the divine
Intelligence, breaking away from it, and yet again being filled to
satiety with the divine Ideas- the beautiful abounding in all
plenty, so that every splendour become manifest in it with the
images of whatever is lovely- Soul which, taken as one all, is
Aphrodite, while in it may be distinguished the Reason-Principles
summed under the names of Plenty and Possession, produced by the
downflow of the Nectar of the over realm. The splendours contained
in Soul are thought of as the garden of Zeus with reference to their
existing within Life; and Poros sleeps in this garden in the sense
of being sated and heavy with its produce. Life is eternally 
manifest,
an eternal existent among the existences, and the banqueting of the
gods means no more than that they have their Being in that vital
blessedness. And Love- "born at the banquet of the gods"- has of
necessity been eternally in existence, for it springs from the
intention of the Soul towards its Best, towards the Good; as long as
Soul has been, Love has been.

<P>Still this Love is of mixed quality. On the one hand there is in
it the lack which keeps it craving: on the other, it is not entirely
destitute; the deficient seeks more of what it has, and certainly
nothing absolutely void of good would ever go seeking the good.

<P>It is said then to spring from Poverty and Possession in 
the sense
that Lack and Aspiration and the Memory of the Ideal Principles, all
present together in the Soul, produce that Act towards The Good
which is Love. Its Mother is Poverty, since striving is for 
the needy;
and this Poverty is Matter, for Matter is the wholly poor: the very
ambition towards the good is a sign of existing 
indetermination; there
is a lack of shape and of Reason in that which must aspire 
towards the
Good, and the greater degree of effort implies the lower depth of
materiality. A thing aspiring towards the Good is an Ideal-principle
only when the striving [with attainment] will leave it still 
unchanged
in Kind: when it must take in something other than itself, its
aspiration is the presentment of Matter to the incoming power.

<P>Thus Love is at once, in some degree a thing of Matter and at
the same time a Celestial, sprung of the Soul; for Love 
lacks its Good
but, from its very birth, strives towards It.
