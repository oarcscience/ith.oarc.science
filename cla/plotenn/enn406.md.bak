#### Section 7

7\. The Kind, then, with which we are dealing is twofold, the
Intellectual against the sensible: better for the soul to dwell in the
Intellectual, but, given its proper nature, it is under compulsion to
participate in the sense-realm also. There is no grievance in its not
being, through and through, the highest; it holds mid-rank among the
authentic existences, being of divine station but at the lowest extreme
of the Intellectual and skirting the sense-known nature; thus, while it
communicates to this realm something of its own store, it absorbs in
turn whenever- instead of employing in its government only its
safeguarded phase- it plunges in an excessive zeal to the very midst of
its chosen sphere; then it abandons its status as whole soul with whole
soul, though even thus it is always able to recover itself by turning to
account the experience of what it has seen and suffered here, learning,
so, the greatness of rest in the Supreme, and more clearly discerning
the finer things by comparison with what is almost their direct
antithesis. Where the faculty is incapable of knowing without contact,
the experience of evil brings the dearer perception of Good.

The outgoing that takes place in the Intellectual-Principle is a descent
to its own downward ultimate: it cannot be a movement to the
transcendent; operating necessarily outwards from itself, wherein it may
not stay inclosed, the need and law of Nature bring it to its extreme
term, to soul- to which it entrusts all the later stages of being while
itself turns back on its course.

The soul's operation is similar: its next lower act is this universe:
its immediate higher is the contemplation of the Authentic Existences.
To individual souls such divine operation takes place only at one of
their phases and by a temporal process when from the lower in which they
reside they turn towards the noblest; but that soul, which we know as
the All-Soul, has never entered the lower activity, but, immune from
evil, has the property of knowing its lower by inspection, while it
still cleaves continuously to the beings above itself; thus its double
task becomes possible; it takes thence and, since as soul it cannot
escape touching this sphere, it gives hither.
