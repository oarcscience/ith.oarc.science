#### Section 2

2\. Are these planets to be thought of as soulless or unsouled?

Suppose them, first, to be without Soul.

In that case they can purvey only heat or cold- if cold from the stars
can be thought of- that is to say, any communication from them will
affect only our bodily nature, since all they have to communicate to us
is merely corporeal. This implies that no considerable change can be
caused in the bodies affected since emanations merely corporeal cannot
differ greatly from star to star, and must, moreover, blend upon earth
into one collective resultant: at most the differences would be such as
depend upon local position, upon nearness or farness with regard to the
centre of influence. This reasoning, of course, is as valid of any cold
emanation there may be as of the warm.

Now, what is there in such corporeal action to account for the various
classes and kinds of men, learned and illiterate, scholars as against
orators, musicians as against people of other professions? Can a power
merely physical make rich or poor? Can it bring about such conditions as
in no sense depend upon the interaction of corporeal elements? Could it,
for example, bring a man such and such a brother, father, son, or wife,
give him a stroke of good fortune at a particular moment, or make him
generalissimo or king?

Next, suppose the stars to have life and mind and to be effective by
deliberate purpose.

In that case, what have they suffered from us that they should, in free
will, do us hurt, they who are established in a divine place, themselves
divine? There is nothing in their nature of what makes men base, nor can
our weal or woe bring them the slightest good or ill.
