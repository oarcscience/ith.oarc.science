<P>4. In that realm it has also vision, through the
Intellectual-Principle, of The Good which does not so hold to itself
as not to reach the soul; what intervenes between them is 
not body and
therefore is no hindrance- and, indeed, where bodily forms do
intervene there is still access in many ways from the primal to the
tertiaries.

<P>If, on the contrary, the soul gives itself to the inferior, the
same principle of penetration comes into play, and it possesses
itself, by memory and imagination, of the thing it desired: and
hence the memory, even dealing with the highest, is not the highest.
Memory, of course, must be understood not merely of what might be
called the sense of remembrance, but so as to include a condition
induced by the past experience or vision. There is such a thing as
possessing more powerfully without consciousness than in full
knowledge; with full awareness the possession is of something quite
distinct from the self; unconscious possession runs very close to
identity, and any such approach to identification with the 
lower means
the deeper fall of the soul.

<P>If the soul, on abandoning its place in the Supreme, revives its
memories of the lower, it must have in some form possessed them even
there though the activity of the beings in that realm kept them in
abeyance: they could not be in the nature of impressions permanently
adopted- a notion which would entail absurdities- but were no more
than a potentiality realized after return. When that energy of the
Intellectual world ceases to tell upon the soul, it sees what it saw
in the earlier state before it revisited the Supreme.
