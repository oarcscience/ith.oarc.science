#### Section 14

14\. The ordinance of the Kosmos, then, is in keeping with the
Intellectual Principle. True, no reasoning went to its creation, but it
so stands that the keenest reasoning must wonder- since no reasoning
could be able to make it otherwise- at the spectacle before it, a
product which, even in the Kinds of the partial and particular Sphere,
displays the Divine Intelligence to a degree in which no arranging by
reason could express it. Every one of the ceaselessly recurrent types of
being manifests a creating Reason-Principle above all censure. No fault
is to be found unless on the assumption that everything ought to come
into being with all the perfection of those that have never known such a
coming, the Eternals. In that case, things of the Intellectual realm and
things of the realm of sense must remain one unbroken identity for ever.

In this demand for more good than exists, there is implied a failure to
recognize that the form allotted to each entity is sufficient in itself;
it is like complaining because one kind of animal lacks horns. We ought
to understand both that the Reason-Principle must extend to every
possible existent and, at the same time, that every greater must include
lesser things, that to every whole belong its parts, and that all cannot
be equality unless all part is to be absent.

This is why in the Over-World each entity is all, while here, below, the
single thing is not all \[is not the Universe but a "Self"\]. Thus too,
a man, an individual, in so far as he is a part, is not Humanity
complete: but wheresoever there is associated with the parts something
that is no part \[but a Divine, an Intellectual Being\], this makes a
whole of that in which it dwells. Man, man as partial thing, cannot be
required to have attained to the very summit of goodness: if he had, he
would have ceased to be of the partial order. Not that there is any
grudging in the whole towards the part that grows in goodness and
dignity; such an increase in value is a gain to the beauty of the whole;
the lesser grows by being made over in the likeness of the greater, by
being admitted, as it were, to something of that greatness, by sharing
in that rank, and thus even from this place of man, from man's own self,
something gleams forth, as the stars shine in the divine firmament, so
that all appears one great and lovely figure- living or wrought in the
furnaces of craftsmanship- with stars radiant not only in the ears and
on the brow but on the breasts too, and wherever else they may be
displayed in beauty.
