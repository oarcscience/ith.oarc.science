#### Section 16

16\. Those that refuse to place the Sage aloft in the Intellectual Realm
but drag him down to the accidental, dreading accident for him, have
substituted for the Sage we have in mind another person altogether; they
offer us a tolerable sort of man and they assign to him a life of
mingled good and ill, a case, after all, not easy to conceive. But
admitting the possibility of such a mixed state, it could not be
deserved to be called a life of happiness; it misses the Great, both in
the dignity of Wisdom and in the integrity of Good. The life of true
happiness is not a thing of mixture. And Plato rightly taught that he
who is to be wise and to possess happiness draws his good from the
Supreme, fixing his gaze on That, becoming like to That, living by That.

He can care for no other Term than That: all else he will attend to only
as he might change his residence, not in expectation of any increase to
his settled felicity, but simply in a reasonable attention to the
differing conditions surrounding him as he lives here or there.

He will give to the body all that he sees to be useful and possible, but
he himself remains a member of another order, not prevented from
abandoning the body, necessarily leaving it at nature's hour, he himself
always the master to decide in its regard.

Thus some part of his life considers exclusively the Soul's
satisfaction; the rest is not immediately for the Term's sake and not
for his own sake, but for the thing bound up with him, the thing which
he tends and bears with as the musician cares for his lyre, as long as
it can serve him: when the lyre fails him, he will change it, or will
give up lyre and lyring, as having another craft now, one that needs no
lyre, and then he will let it rest unregarded at his side while he sings
on without an instrument. But it was not idly that the instrument was
given him in the beginning: he has found it useful until now, many a
time.
