<P>3. But if this Reason-Principle [Nature] is in act- and produces
by the process indicated- how can it have any part in Contemplation?

<P>To begin with, since in all its production it is stationary and
intact, a Reason-Principle self-indwelling, it is in its own nature
a Contemplative act. All doing must be guided by an Idea, and will
therefore be distinct from that Idea: the Reason-Principle then, as
accompanying and guiding the work, will be distinct from the 
work; not
being action but Reason-Principle it is, necessarily, Contemplation.
Taking the Reason-Principle, the Logos, in all its phases, the
lowest and last springs from a mental act [in the higher 
Logos] and is
itself a contemplation, though only in the sense of being
contemplated, but above it stands the total Logos with its two
distinguishable phases, first, that identified not as Nature but as
All-Soul and, next, that operating in Nature and being itself the
Nature-Principle.

<P>And does this Reason-Principle, Nature, spring from a
contemplation?

<P>Wholly and solely?

<P>From self-contemplation, then? Or what are we to think? 
It derives
from a Contemplation and some contemplating Being; how are we to
suppose it to have Contemplation itself?

<P>The Contemplation springing from the reasoning faculty- that, I
mean, of planning its own content, it does not possess.

<P>But why not, since it is a phase of Life, a 
Reason-Principle and a
creative Power?

<P>Because to plan for a thing is to lack it: Nature does not lack;
it creates because it possesses. Its creative act is simply its
possession of it own characteristic Essence; now its 
Essence, since it
is a Reason-Principle, is to be at once an act of 
contemplation and an
object of contemplation. In other words, the, Nature-Principle
produces by virtue of being an act of contemplation, an object of
contemplation and a Reason-Principle; on this triple 
character depends
its creative efficacy.

<P>Thus the act of production is seen to be in Nature an act of
contemplation, for creation is the outcome of a contemplation which
never becomes anything else, which never does anything else, but
creates by simply being a contemplation.
