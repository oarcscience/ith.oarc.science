<P>11. The administration of the kosmos is to be thought of as that
of a living unit: there is the action determined by what is
external, and has to do with the parts, and there is that determined
by the internal and by the principle: thus a doctor basing his
treatment on externals and on the parts directly affected will often
be baffled and obliged to all sorts of calculation, while Nature
will act on the basis of principle and need no deliberation. 
And in so
far as the kosmos is a conducted thing, its administration and its
administrator will follow not the way of the doctor but the way of
Nature.

<P>And in the case of the universe, the administration is all the
less complicated from the fact that the soul actually circumscribes,
as parts of a living unity, all the members which it 
conducts. For all
the Kinds included in the universe are dominated by one Kind, upon
which they follow, fitted into it, developing from it, growing out
of it, just as the Kind manifested in the bough is related 
to the Kind
in the tree as a whole.

<P>What place, then, is there for reasoning, for calculation, what
place for memory, where wisdom and knowledge are eternal,
unfailingly present, effective, dominant, administering in an
identical process?

<P>The fact that the product contains diversity and difference does
not warrant the notion that the producer must be subject to
corresponding variations. On the contrary, the more varied the
product, the more certain the unchanging identity of the producer:
even in the single animal the events produced by Nature are many and
not simultaneous; there are the periods, the developments at fixed
epochs- horns, beard, maturing breasts, the acme of life, 
procreation-
but the principles which initially determined the nature of the
being are not thereby annulled; there is process of growth, but no
diversity in the initial principle. The identity underlying all the
multiplicity is confirmed by the fact that the principle
constituting the parent is exhibited unchanged, undiminished, in the
offspring. We have reason, then, for thinking that one and the same
wisdom envelops both, and that this is the unalterable wisdom of the
kosmos taken as a whole; it is manifold, diverse and yet simplex,
presiding over the most comprehensive of living beings, and 
in no wise
altered within itself by this multiplicity, but stably one
Reason-Principle, the concentrated totality of things: if it were
not thus all things, it would be a wisdom of the later and partial,
not the wisdom of the Supreme.
