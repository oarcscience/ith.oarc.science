#### Section 20

20\. Since we are not entitled to make desire the test by which to
decide on the nature and quality of the good, we may perhaps have
recourse to judgement.

We would apply the opposition of things- order, disorder; symmetry,
irregularity; health, illness; form, shapelessness; real-being, decay:
in a word continuity against dissolution. The first in each pair, no one
could doubt, belong to the concept of good and therefore whatever tends
to produce them must be ranged on the good side.

Thus virtue and Intellectual-Principle and life and soul- reasoning
soul, at least- belong to the idea of good and so therefore does all
that a reasoned life aims at.

Why not halt, then- it will be asked- at Intellectual-Principle and make
that The Good? Soul and life are traces of Intellectual-Principle; that
principle is the Term of Soul which on judgement sets itself towards
Intellectual-Principle, pronouncing right preferable to wrong and virtue
in every form to vice, and thus ranking by its choosing.

The soul aiming only at that Principle would need a further lessoning;
it must be taught that Intellectual-Principle is not the ultimate, that
not all things look to that while all do look to the good. Not all that
is outside of Intellectual-Principle seeks to attain it; what has
attained it does not halt there but looks still towards good. Besides,
Intellectual-Principle is sought upon motives of reasoning, the good
before all reason. And in any striving towards life and continuity of
existence and activity, the object is aimed at not as
Intellectual-Principle but as good, as rising from good and leading to
it: life itself is desirable only in view of good.
