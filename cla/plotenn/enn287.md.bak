#### Section 1

1\. The soul: what dubious questions concerning it admit of solution, or
where we must abide our doubt- with, at least, the gain of recognizing
the problem that confronts us- this is matter well worth attention. On
what subject can we more reasonably expend the time required by minute
discussion and investigation? Apart from much else, it is enough that
such an enquiry illuminates two grave questions: of what sphere the soul
is the principle, and whence the soul itself springs. Moreover, we will
be only obeying the ordinance of the God who bade us know ourselves.

Our general instinct to seek and learn, our longing to possess ourselves
of whatsoever is lovely in the vision will, in all reason, set us
enquiring into the nature of the instrument with which we search.

Now even in the universal Intellect \[Divine Mind\] there was duality,
so that we would expect differences of condition in things of part: how
some things rather than others come to be receptacles of the divine
beings will need to be examined; but all this we may leave aside until
we are considering the mode in which soul comes to occupy body. For the
moment we return to our argument against those who maintain our souls to
be offshoots from the soul of the universe \[parts and an identity
modally parted\].

Our opponents will probably deny the validity of our arguments against
the theory that the human soul is a mere segment of the All-Soul- the
considerations, namely, that it is of identical scope, and that it is
intellective in the same degree, supposing them, even, to admit that
equality of intellection.

They will object that parts must necessarily fall under one ideal-form
with their wholes. And they will adduce Plato as expressing their view
where, in demonstrating that the All is ensouled, he says "As our body
is a portion of the body of the All, so our soul is a portion of the
soul of the All." It is admitted on clear evidence that we are borne
along by the Circuit of the All; we will be told that- taking character
and destiny from it, strictly inbound with it- we must derive our souls,
also, from what thus bears us up, and that as within ourselves every
part absorbs from our soul so, analogically, we, standing as parts to
the universe, absorb from the Soul of the All as parts of it. They will
urge also that the dictum "The collective soul cares for all the
unensouled," carries the same implication and could be uttered only in
the belief that nothing whatever of later origin stands outside the soul
of the universe, the only soul there can be there to concern itself with
the unensouled.
