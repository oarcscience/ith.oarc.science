#### Section 3

3\. With this prologue we come to our discussion of Memory.

That the soul, or mind, having taken no imprint, yet achieves perception
of what it in no way contains need not surprise us; or rather,
surprising though it is, we cannot refuse to believe in this remarkable
power.

The Soul is the Reason-Principle of the universe, ultimate among the
Intellectual Beings- its own essential Nature is one of the Beings of
the Intellectual Realm- but it is the primal Reason-Principle of the
entire realm of sense.

Thus it has dealings with both orders- benefited and quickened by the
one, but by the other beguiled, falling before resemblances, and so led
downwards as under spell. Poised midway, it is aware of both spheres.

Of the Intellectual it is said to have intuition by memory upon
approach, for it knows them by a certain natural identity with them; its
knowledge is not attained by besetting them, so to speak, but by in a
definite degree possessing them; they are its natural vision; they are
itself in a more radiant mode, and it rises from its duller pitch to
that greater brilliance in a sort of awakening, a progress from its
latency to its act.

To the sense-order it stands in a similar nearness and to such things it
gives a radiance out of its own store and, as it were, elaborates them
to visibility: the power is always ripe and, so to say, in travail
towards them, so that, whenever it puts out its strength in the
direction of what has once been present in it, it sees that object as
present still; and the more intent its effort the more durable is the
presence. This is why, it is agreed, children have long memory; the
things presented to them are not constantly withdrawn but remain in
sight; in their case the attention is limited but not scattered: those
whose faculty and mental activity are busied upon a multitude of
subjects pass quickly over all, lingering on none.

Now, if memory were a matter of seal-impressions retained, the
multiplicity of objects would have no weakening effect on the memory.
Further, on the same hypothesis, we would have no need of thinking back
to revive remembrance; nor would we be subject to forgetting and
recalling; all would lie engraved within.

The very fact that we train ourselves to remember shows that what we get
by the process is a strengthening of the mind: just so, exercises for
feet and hands enable us to do easily acts which in no sense contained
or laid up in those members, but to which they may be fitted by
persevering effort.

How else can it be explained that we forget a thing heard once or twice
but remember what is often repeated, and that we recall a long time
afterwards what at first hearing we failed to hold?

It is no answer to say that the parts present themselves sooner than the
entire imprint- why should they too be forgotten?- \[there is no
question of parts, for\] the last hearing, or our effort to remember,
brings the thing back to us in a flash.

All these considerations testify to an evocation of that faculty of the
soul, or mind, in which remembrance is vested: the mind is strengthened,
either generally or to this particular purpose.

Observe these facts: memory follows upon attention; those who have
memorized much, by dint of their training in the use of leading
indications \[suggestive words and the like\], reach the point of being
easily able to retain without such aid: must we not conclude that the
basis of memory is the soul-power brought to full strength?

The lingering imprints of the other explanation would tell of weakness
rather than power; for to take imprint easily is to be yielding. An
impression is something received passively; the strongest memory, then,
would go with the least active nature. But what happens is the very
reverse: in no pursuit to technical exercises tend to make a man less
the master of his acts and states. It is as with sense-perception; the
advantage is not to the weak, the weak eye for example, but to that
which has the fullest power towards its exercise. In the old, it is
significant, the senses are dulled and so is the memory.

Sensation and memory, then, are not passivity but power.

And, once it is admitted that sensations are not impressions, the memory
of a sensation cannot consist in the retention of an impression that was
never made.

Yes: but if it is an active power of the mind, a fitness towards its
particular purpose, why does it not come at once- and not with delay- to
the recollection of its unchanging objects?

Simply because the power needs to be poised and prepared: in this it is
only like all the others, which have to be readied for the task to which
their power reaches, some operating very swiftly, others only after a
certain self-concentration.

Quick memory does not in general go with quick wit: the two do not fall
under the same mental faculty; runner and boxer are not often united in
one person; the dominant idea differs from man to man.

Yet there could be nothing to prevent men of superior faculty from
reading impressions on the mind; why should one thus gifted be incapable
of what would be no more than a passive taking and holding?

That memory is a power of the Soul \[not a capacity for taking imprint\]
is established at a stroke by the consideration that the soul is without
magnitude.

And- one general reflection- it is not extraordinary that everything
concerning soul should proceed in quite other ways than appears to
people who either have never enquired, or have hastily adopted delusive
analogies from the phenomena of sense, and persist in thinking of
perception and remembrance in terms of characters inscribed on plates or
tablets; the impossibilities that beset this theory escape those that
make the soul incorporeal equally with those to whom it is corporeal.
