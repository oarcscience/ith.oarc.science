#### Section 2

2\. Thus we may not look for the Intellectual objects \[the Ideas\]
outside of the Intellectual-Principle, treating them as impressions of
reality upon it: we cannot strip it of truth and so make its objects
unknowable and non-existent and in the end annul the
Intellectual-Principle itself. We must provide for knowledge and for
truth; we must secure reality; being must become knowable essentially
and not merely in that knowledge of quality which could give us a mere
image or vestige of the reality in lieu of possession, intimate
association, absorption.

The only way to this is to leave nothing out side of the veritable
Intellectual-Principle which thus has knowledge in the true knowing
\[that of identification with the object\], cannot forget, need not go
wandering in search. At once truth is there, this is the seat of the
authentic Existents, it becomes living and intellective: these are the
essentials of that most lofty Principle; and, failing them, where is its
worth, its grandeur?

Only thus \[by this inherence of the Ideas\] is it dispensed from
demonstration and from acts of faith in the truth of its knowledge: it
is its entire self, self-perspicuous: it knows a prior by recognising
its own source; it knows a sequent to that prior by its self-identity;
of the reality of this sequent, of the fact that it is present and has
authentic existence, no outer entity can bring it surer conviction.

Thus veritable truth is not accordance with an external; it is
self-accordance; it affirms and is nothing other than itself and is
nothing other; it is at once existence and self-affirmation. What
external, then, can call it to the question, and from what source of
truth could the refutation be brought? Any counter affirmation \[of
truth\] must fall into identity with the truth which first uttered
itself; brought forward as new, it has to appear before the Principle
which made the earlier statement and to show itself identical with that:
for there is no finding anything truer than the true.
