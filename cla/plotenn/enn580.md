#### Section 20

20\. We have to ascertain whether there is not to every quality a
contrary. In the case of virtue and vice, even the mean appears to be
contrary to the extremes.

But when we turn to colours, we do not find the intermediates so
related. If we regard the intermediates as blendings of the extremes, we
must not posit any contrariety other than that between black and white,
but must show that all other colours are combinations of these two.
Contrariety however demands that there be some one distinct quality in
the intermediates, though this quality may be seen to arise from a
combination.

It may further be suggested that contraries not only differ from each
other, but also entail the greatest possible difference. But "the
greatest possible difference" would seem to presuppose that
intermediates have already been established: eliminate the series, and
how will you define "the greatest possible"? Sight, we may be told, will
reveal to us that grey is nearer than black to white; and taste may be
our judge when we have hot, cold and no intermediate.

That we are accustomed to act upon these assumptions is obvious enough;
but the following considerations may perhaps commend themselves:

White and yellow are entirely different from each other- a statement
which applies to any colour whatsoever as compared with any other; they
are accordingly contrary qualities. Their contrariety is independent of
the presence of intermediates: between health and disease no
intermediate intrudes, and yet they are contraries.

It may be urged that the products of a contrariety exhibit the greatest
diversity. But "the greatest diversity" is clearly meaningless, unless
we can point to lower degrees of diversity in the means. Thus, we cannot
speak of "the greatest diversity" in reference to health and disease.
This definition of contrariety is therefore inadmissible.

Suppose that we say "great diversity" instead of "the greatest": if
"great" is equivalent to greater and implies a less, immediate
contraries will again escape us; if, on the other hand, we mean strictly
"great" and assume that every quality shows a great divergence from
every other, we must not suppose that the divergence can be measured by
a comparative.

Nonetheless, we must endeavour to find a meaning for the term
"contrary." Can we accept the principle that when things have a certain
similarity which is not generic nor in any sense due to admixture, but a
similarity residing in their forms- if the term be permitted- they
differ in degree but are not contraries; contraries being rather those
things which have no specific identity? It would be necessary to
stipulate that they belong to the same genus, Quality, in order to cover
those immediate contraries which \[apparently\] have nothing conducing
to similarity, inasmuch as there are no intermediates looking both ways,
as it were, and having a mutual similarity to each other; some
contraries are precluded by their isolation from similarity.

If these observations be sound, colours which have a common ground will
not be contraries. But there will be nothing to prevent, not indeed
every colour from being contrary to every other, but any one colour from
being contrary to any other; and similarly with tastes. This will serve
as a statement of the problem.

As for Degree \[subsisting in Quality\], it was given as our opinion
that it exists in the objects participating in Quality, though whether
it enters into qualities as such- into health and justice- was left open
to question. If indeed these qualities possess an extension quite apart
from their participants, we must actually ascribe to them degrees: but
in truth they belong to a sphere where each entity is the whole and does
not admit of degree.
