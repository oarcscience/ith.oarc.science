<P>8. Thus we come to our enquiry as to the degree of excellence
found in things of this Sphere, and how far they belong to an
ordered system or in what degree they are, at least, not evil.

<P>Now in every living being the upper parts- head, face- are the
most beautiful, the mid and lower members inferior. In the Universe
the middle and lower members are human beings; above them, 
the Heavens
and the Gods that dwell there; these Gods with the entire circling
expanse of the heavens constitute the greater part of the Kosmos:
the earth is but a central point, and may be considered as simply
one among the stars. Yet human wrong-doing is made a matter 
of wonder;
we are evidently asked to take humanity as the choice member of the
Universe, nothing wiser existent!

<P>But humanity, in reality, is poised midway between gods and
beasts, and inclines now to the one order, now to the other; some
men grow like to the divine, others to the brute, the greater number
stand neutral. But those that are corrupted to the point of
approximating to irrational animals and wild beasts pull the
mid-folk about and inflict wrong upon them; the victims are no doubt
better than the wrongdoers, but are at the mercy of their 
inferiors in
the field in which they themselves are inferior, where, that is,
they cannot be classed among the good since they have not trained
themselves in self-defence.

<P>A gang of lads, morally neglected, and in that respect 
inferior to
the intermediate class, but in good physical training, attack and
throw another set, trained neither physically nor morally, and make
off with their food and their dainty clothes. What more is called
for than a laugh?

<P>And surely even the lawgiver would be right in allowing 
the second
group to suffer this treatment, the penalty of their sloth and
self-indulgence: the gymnasium lies there before them, and they, in
laziness and luxury and listlessness, have allowed themselves to
fall like fat-loaded sheep, a prey to the wolves.

<P>But the evil-doers also have their punishment: first they pay in
that very wolfishness, in the disaster to their human quality: and
next there is laid up for them the due of their Kind: living 
ill here,
they will not get off by death; on every precedent through all the
line there waits its sequent, reasonable and natural- worse to the
bad, better to the good.

<P>This at once brings us outside the gymnasium with its fun for
boys; they must grow up, both kinds, amid their childishness and
both one day stand girt and armed. Then there is a finer spectacle
than is ever seen by those that train in the ring. But at this stage
some have not armed themselves- and the duly armed win the day.

<P>Not even a God would have the right to deal a blow for the
unwarlike: the law decrees that to come safe out of battle is for
fighting men, not for those that pray. The harvest comes home not
for praying but for tilling; healthy days are not for those that
neglect their health: we have no right to complain of the ignoble
getting the richer harvest if they are the only workers in 
the fields,
or the best.

<P>Again: it is childish, while we carry on all the affairs of our
life to our own taste and not as the Gods would have us, to expect
them to keep all well for us in spite of a life that is lived
without regard to the conditions which the Gods have prescribed for
our well-being. Yet death would be better for us than to go on
living lives condemned by the laws of the Universe. If 
things took the
contrary course, if all the modes of folly and wickedness brought no
trouble in life- then indeed we might complain of the indifference
of a Providence leaving the victory to evil.

<P>Bad men rule by the feebleness of the ruled: and this is 
just; the
triumph of weaklings would not be just.
