#### Section 5

5\. But, it will be objected, if this seeing and frequenting of the
darkness is due to the lack of good, the Soul's evil has its source in
that very lack; the darkness will be merely a secondary cause- and at
once the Principle of Evil is removed from Matter, is made anterior to
Matter.

No: Evil is not in any and every lack; it is in absolute lack. What
falls in some degree short of the Good is not Evil; considered in its
own kind it might even be perfect, but where there is utter dearth,
there we have Essential Evil, void of all share in Good; this is the
case with Matter.

Matter has not even existence whereby to have some part in Good: Being
is attributed to it by an accident of words: the truth would be that it
has Non-Being.

Mere lack brings merely Not-Goodness: Evil demands the absolute lack-
though, of course, any very considerable shortcoming makes the ultimate
fall possible and is already, in itself, an evil.

In fine we are not to think of Evil as some particular bad thing-
injustice, for example, or any other ugly trait- but as a principle
distinct from any of the particular forms in which, by the addition of
certain elements, it becomes manifest. Thus there may be wickedness in
the Soul; the forms this general wickedness is to take will be
determined by the environing Matter, by the faculties of the Soul that
operate and by the nature of their operation, whether seeing, acting, or
merely admitting impression.

But supposing things external to the Soul are to be counted Evil-
sickness, poverty and so forth- how can they be referred to the
principle we have described?

Well, sickness is excess or defect in the body, which as a material
organism rebels against order and measure; ugliness is but matter not
mastered by Ideal-Form; poverty consists in our need and lack of goods
made necessary to us by our association with Matter whose very nature is
to be one long want.

If all this be true, we cannot be, ourselves, the source of Evil, we are
not evil in ourselves; Evil was before we came to be; the Evil which
holds men down binds them against their will; and for those that have
the strength- not found in all men, it is true- there is a deliverance
from the evils that have found lodgement in the soul.

In a word since Matter belongs only to the sensible world, vice in men
is not the Absolute Evil; not all men are vicious; some overcome vice,
some, the better sort, are never attacked by it; and those who master it
win by means of that in them which is not material.
