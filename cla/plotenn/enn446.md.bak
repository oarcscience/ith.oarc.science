#### Section 15

15\. Conferring- but how? As itself possessing them or not? How can it
convey what it does not possess, and yet if it does possess how is it
simplex? And if, again, it does not, how is it the source of the
manifold?

A single, unmanifold emanation we may very well allow- how even that can
come from a pure unity may be a problem, but we may always explain it on
the analogy of the irradiation from a luminary- but a multitudinous
production raises question.

The explanation is that what comes from the Supreme cannot be identical
with it and assuredly cannot be better than it- what could be better
than The One or the utterly transcendent? The emanation, then, must be
less good, that is to say, less self-sufficing: now what must that be
which is less self-sufficing than The One? Obviously the Not-One, that
is to say, multiplicity, but a multiplicity striving towards unity; that
is to say, a One-that-is-many.

All that is not One is conserved by virtue of the One, and from the One
derives its characteristic nature: if it had not attained such unity as
is consistent with being made up of multiplicity we could not affirm its
existence: if we are able to affirm the nature of single things, this is
in virtue of the unity, the identity even, which each of them possesses.
But the all-transcendent, utterly void of multiplicity, has no mere
unity of participation but is unity's self, independent of all else, as
being that from which, by whatever means, all the rest take their degree
of unity in their standing, near or far, towards it.

In virtue of the unity manifested in its variety it exhibits, side by
side, both an all-embracing identity and the existence of the secondary:
all the variety lies in the midst of a sameness, and identity cannot be
separated from diversity since all stands as one; each item in that
content, by the fact of participating in life, is a One-many: for the
item could not make itself manifest as a One-and-all.

Only the Transcendent can be that; it is the great beginning, and the
beginning must be a really existent One, wholly and truly One, while its
sequent, poured down in some way from the One, is all, a total which has
participation in unity and whose every member is similarly all and one.

What then is the All?

The total of which the Transcendent is the Source.

But in what way is it that source? In the sense, perhaps, of sustaining
things as bestower of the unity of each single item?

That too; but also as having established them in being.

But how? As having, perhaps, contained them previously?

We have indicated that, thus, the First would be a manifold.

May we think, perhaps, that the First contained the universe as an
indistinct total whose items are elaborated to distinct existence within
the Second by the Reason-Principle there? That Second is certainly an
Activity; the Transcendent would contain only the potentiality of the
universe to come.

But the nature of this contained potentiality would have to be
explained: it cannot be that of Matter, a receptivity, for thus the
Source becomes passive- the very negation of production.

How then does it produce what it does not contain? Certainly not at
haphazard and certainly not by selection. How then?

We have observed that anything that may spring from the One must be
different from it. Differing, it is not One, since then it would be the
Source. If unity has given place to duality, from that moment there is
multiplicity; for here is variety side by side with identity, and this
imports quality and all the rest.

We may take it as proved that the emanation of the Transcendent must be
a Not-One something other than pure unity, but that it is a
multiplicity, and especially that it is such a multiplicity as is
exhibited in the sequent universe, this is a statement worthy of
deliberation: some further enquiry must be made, also, as to the
necessity of any sequel to the First.
