#### Section 7

7\. Well but can they not tell themselves that yesterday, or last year,
they moved round the earth, that they lived yesterday or at any given
moment in their lives?

Their living is eternal, and eternity is an unchanging unity. To
identify a yesterday or a last year in their movement would be like
isolating the movement of one of the feet, and finding a this or a that
and an entire series in what is a single act. The movement of the
celestial beings is one movement: it is our measuring that presents us
with many movements, and with distinct days determined by intervening
nights: There all is one day; series has no place; no yesterday, no last
year.

Still: the space traversed is different; there are the various sections
of the Zodiac: why, then, should not the soul say "I have traversed that
section and now I am in this other?" If, also, it looks down over the
concerns of men, must it not see the changes that befall them, that they
are not as they were, and, by that observation, that the beings and the
things concerned were otherwise formerly? And does not that mean memory?
