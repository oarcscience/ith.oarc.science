<P>28. We have already indicated that Activity and Passivity are to
be regarded as motions, and that it is possible to distinguish
absolute motions, actions, passions.

<P>As for the remaining so-called genera, we have shown 
that they are
reducible to those which we have posited.

<P>With regard to the relative, we have maintained that Relation
belongs to one object as compared with another, that the two objects
coexist simultaneously, and that Relation is found wherever a
substance is in such a condition as to produce it; not that the
substance is a relative, except in so far as it constitutes part of
a whole- a hand, for example, or head or cause or principle or
element.

<P>We may also adopt the ancient division of relatives into
creative principles, measures, excesses and deficiencies, and those
which in general separate objects on the basis of similarities and
differences.

<P>Our investigation into the kinds of Being is now complete.

<P></P>
