#### Section 27

27\. On other grounds also, it is indefensible not to have reserved the
high place for the true first-principle of things but to have set up in
its stead the formless, passive and lifeless, the irrational, dark and
indeterminate, and to have made this the source of Being. In this theory
God is introduced merely for the sake of appearance: deriving existence
from Matter he is a composite, a derivative, or, worse, a mere state of
Matter.

Another consideration is that, if Matter is a substrate, there must be
something outside it, which, acting on it and distinct from it, makes it
the substrate of what is poured into it. But if God is lodged in Matter
and by being involved in Matter is himself no more than a substrate, he
will no longer make Matter a substrate nor be himself a substrate in
conjunction with Matter. For of what will they be substrates, when that
which could make them substrates is eliminated? This so-called substrate
turns out to have swallowed up all that is; but a substrate must be
relative, and relative not to its content but to something which acts
upon it as upon a datum.

Again, the substrate comports a relation to that which is not substrate;
hence, to something external to it: there must, then, be something apart
from the substrate. If nothing distinct and external is considered
necessary, but the substrate itself can become everything and adopt
every character, like the versatile dancer in the pantomime, it ceases
to be a substrate: it is, essentially, everything. The mime is not a
substrate of the characters he puts on; these are in fact the
realisation of his own personality: similarly, if the Matter with which
this theory presents us comports in its own being all the realities, it
is no longer the substrate of all: on the contrary, the other things can
have no reality whatever, if they are no more than states of Matter in
the sense that the poses of the mime are states through which he passes.

Then, those other things not existing, Matter will not be a substrate,
nor will it have a place among the Existents; it will be Matter bare,
and for that reason not even Matter, since Matter is a relative. The
relative is relative to something else: it must, further, be homogeneous
with that something else: double is relative to half, but not Substance
to double.

How then can an Existent be relative to a Non-existent, except
accidentally? But the True-Existent, or Matter, is related (to what
emerges from it) as Existent to Non-Existent. For if potentiality is
that which holds the promise of existence and that promise does not
constitute Reality, the potentiality cannot be a Reality. In sum, these
very teachers who deprecate the production of Realities from
Nonrealities, themselves produce Non-reality from Reality; for to them
the universe as such is not a Reality.

But is it not a paradox that, while Matter, the Substrate, is to them an
existence, bodies should not have more claim to existence, the universe
yet more, and not merely a claim grounded on the reality of one of its
parts?

It is no less paradoxical that the living form should owe existence not
to its soul but to its Matter only, the soul being but an affection of
Matter and posterior to it. From what source then did Matter receive
ensoulment? Whence, in short, is soul's entity derived? How does it
occur that Matter sometimes turns into bodies, while another part of it
turns into Soul? Even supposing that Form might come to it from
elsewhere, that accession of Quality to Matter would account not for
Soul, but simply for organized body soulless. If, on the contrary, there
is something which both moulds Matter and produces Soul, then prior to
the produced there must be Soul the producer.
