<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 1</H4>

<P>1. Philosophy at a very early stage investigated the number and
character of the Existents. Various theories resulted: some declared
for one Existent, others for a finite number, others again for an
infinite number, while as regards the nature of the Existents- one,
numerically finite, or numerically infinite- there was a similar
disagreement. These theories, in so far as they have been adequately
examined by later workers, may be passed over here; our 
attention must
be directed upon the results of those whose examination has led them
to posit on their awn account certain well-defined genera.

<P>These thinkers rejected pure unity on the ground of the
plurality observed even in the Intellectual world; they rejected an
infinite number as not reconcilable with the facts and as defying
knowledge: considering the foundations of being to be "genera"
rather than elements strictly so called, they concluded for a finite
number. Of these "genera" some found ten, others less, 
others no doubt
more.

<P>But here again there is a divergence of views. To some the
genera are first-principles; to others they indicate only a generic
classification of the Existents themselves.

<P>Let us begin with the well-known tenfold division of the
Existents, and consider whether we are to understand ten 
genera ranged
under the common name of Being, or ten categories. That the 
term Being
has not the same sense in all ten is rightly maintained.

<P>But a graver problem confronts us at the outset: Are the 
ten found
alike in the Intellectual and in the Sensible realms? Or are 
all found
in the Sensible and some only in the Intellectual? All in the
Intellectual and some in the Sensible is manifestly impossible.

<P>At this point it would be natural to investigate which of the
ten belong to both spheres, and whether the Existents of the
Intellectual are to be ranged under one and the same genus with the
Existents in the Sensible, or whether the term "Existence" [or
Substance] is equivocal as applied to both realms. If the 
equivocation
exists, the number of genera will be increased: if there is no
equivocation, it is strange to find the one same "Existence"
applying to the primary and to the derivative Existents when there
is no common genus embracing both primal and secondary.

<P>These thinkers are however not considering the Intellectual
realm in their division, which was not intended to cover all the
Existents; the Supreme they overlooked.
