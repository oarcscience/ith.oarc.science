#### Section 10

10\. As regards Quality, the source of what we call a "quale," we must
in the first place consider what nature it possesses in accordance with
which it produces the "qualia," and whether, remaining one and the same
in virtue of that common ground, it has also differences whereby it
produces the variety of species. If there is no common ground and the
term Quality involves many connotations, there cannot be a single genus
of Quality.

What then will be the common ground in habit, disposition, passive
quality, figure, shape? In light, thick and lean?

If we hold this common ground to be a power adapting itself to the forms
of habits, dispositions and physical capacities, a power which gives the
possessor whatever capacities he has, we have no plausible explanation
of incapacities. Besides, how are figure and the shape of a given thing
to be regarded as a power?

Moreover, at this, Being will have no power qua Being but only when
Quality has been added to it; and the activities of those substances
which are activities in the highest degree, will be traceable to
Quality, although they are autonomous and owe their essential character
to powers wholly their own!

Perhaps, however, qualities are conditioned by powers which are
posterior to the substances as such \[and so do not interfere with their
essential activities\]. Boxing, for example, is not a power of man qua
man; reasoning is: therefore reasoning, on this hypothesis, is not
quality but a natural possession of the mature human being; it therefore
is called a quality only by analogy. Thus, Quality is a power which adds
the property of being qualia to substances already existent.

The differences distinguishing substances from each other are called
qualities only by analogy; they are, more strictly, Acts and
Reason-Principles, or parts of Reason-Principles, and though they may
appear merely to qualify the substance, they in fact indicate its
essence.

Qualities in the true sense- those, that is, which determine qualia-
being in accordance with our definition powers, will in virtue of this
common ground be a kind of Reason-Principle; they will also be in a
sense Forms, that is, excellences and imperfections whether of soul or
of body.

But how can they all be powers? Beauty or health of soul or body, very
well: but surely not ugliness, disease, weakness, incapacity. In a word,
is powerlessness a power?

It may be urged that these are qualities in so far as qualia are also
named after them: but may not the qualia be so called by analogy, and
not in the strict sense of the single principle? Not only may the term
be understood in the four ways \[of Aristotle\], but each of the four
may have at least a twofold significance.

In the first place, Quality is not merely a question of action and
passion, involving a simple distinction between the potentially active
\[quality\] and the passive: health, disposition and habit, disease,
strength and weakness are also classed as qualities. It follows that the
common ground is not power, but something we have still to seek.

Again, not all qualities can be regarded as Reason-Principles: chronic
disease cannot be a Reason-Principle. Perhaps, however, we must speak in
such cases of privations, restricting the term "Quantities" to
Ideal-Forms and powers. Thus we shall have, not a single genus, but
reference only to the unity of a category. Knowledge will be regarded as
a Form and a power, ignorance as a privation and powerlessness.

On the other hand, powerlessness and disease are a kind of Form; disease
and vice have many powers though looking to evil.

But how can a mere failure be a power? Doubtless the truth is that every
quality performs its own function independently of a standard; for in no
case could it produce an effect outside of its power.

Even beauty would seem to have a power of its own. Does this apply to
triangularity?

Perhaps, after all, it is not a power we must consider, but a
disposition. Thus, qualities will be determined by the forms and
characteristics of the object qualified: their common element, then,
will be Form and ideal type, imposed upon Substance and posterior to it.

But then, how do we account for the powers? We may doubtless remark that
even the natural boxer is so by being constituted in a particular way;
similarly, with the man unable to box: to generalize, the quality is a
characteristic non-essential. Whatever is seen to apply alike to Being
and to non-Being, as do heat and whiteness and colours generally, is
either different from Being- is, for example, an Act of Being- or else
is some secondary of Being, derived from it, contained in it, its image
and likeness.

But if Quality is determined by formation and characteristic and
Reason-Principle, how explain the various cases of powerlessness and
deformity? Doubtless we must think of Principles imperfectly present, as
in the case of deformity. And disease- how does that imply a
Reason-Principle? Here, no doubt, we must think of a principle
disturbed, the Principle of health.

But it is not necessary that all qualities involve a Reason-Principle;
it suffices that over and above the various kinds of disposition there
exist a common element distinct from Substance, and it is what comes
after the substance that constitutes Quality in an object.

But triangularity is a quality of that in which it is present; it is
however no longer triangularity as such, but the triangularity present
in that definite object and modified in proportion to its success in
shaping that object.
