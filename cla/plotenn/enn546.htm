<P>9. The above considerations- to which others, doubtless, might
be added- suffice to show that these five are primary 
genera. But that
they are the only primary genera, that there are no others, 
how can we
be confident of this? Why do we not add unity to them? Quantity?
Quality? Relation, and all else included by our various forerunners?

<P>As for unity: If the term is to mean a unity in which 
nothing else
is present, neither Soul nor Intellect nor anything else, this can
be predicated of nothing, and therefore cannot be a genus. If it
denotes the unity present in Being, in which case we predicate Being
of unity, this unity is not primal.

<P>Besides, unity, containing no differences, cannot 
produce species,
and not producing species, cannot be a genus. You cannot so much as
divide unity: to divide it would be to make it many. Unity, aspiring
to be a genus, becomes a plurality and annuls itself.

<P>Again, you must add to it to divide it into species; for 
there can
be no differentiae in unity as there are in Substance. The mind
accepts differences of Being, but differences within unity there
cannot be. Every differentia introduces a duality destroying the
unity; for the addition of any one thing always does away with the
previous quantity.

<P>It may be contended that the unity which is implicit in Being
and in Motion is common to all other things, and that therefore
Being and unity are inseparable. But we rejected the idea that Being
is a genus comprising all things, on the ground that these things
are not beings in the sense of the Absolute Being, but beings in
another mode: in the same way, we assert, unity is not a genus, the
Primary Unity having a character distinct from all other unities.

<P>Admitted that not everything suffices to produce a genus, it may
yet be urged that there is an Absolute or Primary Unity
corresponding to the other primaries. But if Being and unity are
identified, then since Being has already been included among the
genera, it is but a name that is introduced in unity: if, however,
they are both unity, some principle is implied: if there is anything
in addition [to this principle], unity is predicated of this added
thing; if there is nothing added, the reference is again to 
that unity
predicated of nothing. If however the unity referred to is that
which accompanies Being, we have already decided that it is not
unity in the primary sense.

<P>But is there any reason why this less complete unity should not
still possess Primary Being, seeing that even its posterior 
we rank as
Being, and "Being" in the sense of the Primary Being? The reason is
that the prior of this Being cannot itself be Being- or else, if the
prior is Being, this is not Primary Being: but the prior is unity;
[therefore unity is not Being].

<P>Furthermore, unity, abstracted from Being, has no differentiae.

<P>Again, even taking it as bound up with Being: If it is a
consequent of Being, then it is a consequent of everything, and
therefore the latest of things: but the genus takes 
priority. If it is
simultaneous with Being, it is simultaneous with everything: but a
genus is not thus simultaneous. If it is prior to Being, it is of
the nature of a Principle, and therefore will belong only to Being;
but if it serves as Principle to Being, it is not its genus: if it
is not genus to Being, it is equally not a genus of anything 
else; for
that would make Being a genus of all other things.

<P>In sum, the unity exhibited in Being on the one hand
approximates to Unity-Absolute and on the other tends to identify
itself with Being: Being is a unity in relation to the Absolute, is
Being by virtue of its sequence upon that Absolute: it is indeed
potentially a plurality, and yet it remains a unity and rejecting
division refuses thereby to become a genus.
