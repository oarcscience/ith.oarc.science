<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 1</H4>

<P>1. Are we to make True Happiness one and the same thing with
Welfare or Prosperity and therefore within the reach of the other
living beings as well as ourselves?

<P>There is certainly no reason to deny well-being to any of them
as long as their lot allows them to flourish unhindered after their
kind.

<P>Whether we make Welfare consist in pleasant conditions 
of life, or
in the accomplishment of some appropriate task, by either account it
may fall to them as to us. For certainly they may at once be
pleasantly placed and engaged about some function that lies in their
nature: take for an instance such living beings as have the gift of
music; finding themselves well-off in other ways, they sing, too, as
their nature is, and so their day is pleasant to them.

<P>And if, even, we set Happiness in some ultimate Term pursued by
inborn tendency, then on this head, too, we must allow it to animals
from the moment of their attaining this Ultimate: the nature in them
comes to a halt, having fulfilled its vital course from a 
beginning to
an end.

<P>It may be a distasteful notion, this bringing-down of 
happiness so
low as to the animal world- making it over, as then we must, even to
the vilest of them and not withholding it even from the 
plants, living
they too and having a life unfolding to a Term.

<P>But, to begin with, it is surely unsound to deny that 
good of life
to animals only because they do not appear to man to be of great
account. And as for plants, we need not necessarily allow to 
them what
we accord to the other forms of life, since they have no feeling. It
is true people might be found to declare prosperity possible to the
very plants: they have life, and life may bring good or evil; the
plants may thrive or wither, bear or be barren.

<P>No: if Pleasure be the Term, if here be the good of life, it is
impossible to deny the good of life to any order of living things;
if the Term be inner-peace, equally impossible; impossible, too, if
the good of life be to live in accordance with the purpose of nature.
