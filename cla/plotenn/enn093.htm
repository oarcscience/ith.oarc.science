<P>4. But matters are involved here which demand specific
investigation and cannot be treated as incidental merely to our
present problem. We are faced with several questions: Is the
heavenly system exposed to any such flux as would occasion 
the need of
some restoration corresponding to nourishment; or do its 
members, once
set in their due places, suffer no loss of substance, permanent by
Kind? Does it consist of fire only, or is it mainly of fire with the
other elements, as well, taken up and carried in the circuit by the
dominant Principle?

<P>Our doctrine of the immortality of the heavenly system rests on
the firmest foundation once we have cited the sovereign agent, the
soul, and considered, besides, the peculiar excellence of the bodily
substance constituting the stars, a material so pure, so entirely
the noblest, and chosen by the soul as, in all living beings, the
determining principle appropriates to itself the choicest among
their characteristic parts. No doubt Aristotle is right in 
speaking of
flame as a turmoil, fire insolently rioting; but the 
celestial fire is
equable, placid, docile to the purposes of the stars.

<P>Still, the great argument remains, the Soul, moving in its
marvellous might second only to the very loftiest Existents: 
how could
anything once placed within this Soul break away from it into
non-being? No one that understands this principle, the support of
all things, can fail to see that, sprung from God, it is a stronger
stay than any bonds.

<P>And is it conceivable that the Soul, valid to sustain for a
certain space of time, could not so sustain for ever? This 
would be to
assume that it holds things together by violence; that there is a
"natural course" at variance with what actually exists in the nature
of the universe and in these exquisitely ordered beings; and that
there is some power able to storm the established system and destroy
its ordered coherence, some kingdom or dominion that may shatter the
order founded by the Soul.

<P>Further: The Kosmos has had no beginning- the impossibility has
been shown elsewhere- and this is warrant for its continued 
existence.
Why should there be in the future a change that has not yet
occurred? The elements there are not worn away like beams 
and rafters:
they hold sound for ever, and so the All holds sound. And even
supposing these elements to be in ceaseless transmutation, 
yet the All
persists: the ground of all the change must itself be changeless.

<P>As to any alteration of purpose in the Soul we have already
shown the emptiness of that fancy: the administration of the
universe entails neither labour nor loss; and, even supposing the
possibility of annihilating all that is material, the Soul 
would be no
whit the better or the worse.
