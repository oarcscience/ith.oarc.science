#### Section 11

11\. To this end we must go back to the state we affirmed of Eternity,
unwavering Life, undivided totality, limitless, knowing no divagation,
at rest in unity and intent upon it. Time was not yet: or at least it
did not exist for the Eternal Beings, though its being was implicit in
the Idea and Principle of progressive derivation.

But from the Divine Beings thus at rest within themselves, how did this
Time first emerge?

We can scarcely call upon the Muses to recount its origin since they
were not in existence then- perhaps not even if they had been. The
engendered thing, Time, itself, can best tell us how it rose and became
manifest; something thus its story would run:

Time at first- in reality before that "first" was produced by desire of
succession- Time lay, self-concentrated, at rest within the Authentic
Existent: it was not yet Time; it was merged in the Authentic and
motionless with it. But there was an active principle there, one set on
governing itself and realizing itself \[= the All-Soul\], and it chose
to aim at something more than its present: it stirred from its rest, and
Time stirred with it. And we, stirring to a ceaseless succession, to a
next, to the discrimination of identity and the establishment of
ever-new difference, traversed a portion of the outgoing path and
produced an image of Eternity, produced Time.

For the Soul contained an unquiet faculty, always desirous of
translating elsewhere what it saw in the Authentic Realm, and it could
not bear to retain within itself all the dense fullness of its
possession.

A Seed is at rest; the nature-principle within, uncoiling outwards,
makes way towards what seems to it a large life; but by that partition
it loses; it was a unity self-gathered, and now, in going forth from
itself, it fritters its unity away; it advances into a weaker greatness.
It is so with this faculty of the Soul, when it produces the Kosmos
known to sense- the mimic of the Divine Sphere, moving not in the very
movement of the Divine but in its similitude, in an effort to reproduce
that of the Divine. To bring this Kosmos into being, the Soul first laid
aside its eternity and clothed itself with Time; this world of its
fashioning it then gave over to be a servant to Time, making it at every
point a thing of Time, setting all its progressions within the bournes
of Time. For the Kosmos moves only in Soul- the only Space within the
range of the All open to it to move in- and therefore its Movement has
always been in the Time which inheres in Soul.

Putting forth its energy in act after act, in a constant progress of
novelty, the Soul produces succession as well as act; taking up new
purposes added to the old it brings thus into being what had not existed
in that former period when its purpose was still dormant and its life
was not as it since became: the life is changed and that change carries
with it a change of Time. Time, then, is contained in differentiation of
Life; the ceaseless forward movement of Life brings with it unending
Time; and Life as it achieves its stages constitutes past Time.

Would it, then, be sound to define Time as the Life of the Soul in
movement as it passes from one stage of act or experience to another?

Yes; for Eternity, we have said, is Life in repose, unchanging,
self-identical, always endlessly complete; and there is to be an image
of Eternity-Time- such an image as this lower All presents of the Higher
Sphere. Therefore over against that higher life there must be another
life, known by the same name as the more veritable life of the Soul;
over against that movement of the Intellectual Soul there must be the
movement of some partial phase; over against that identity,
unchangeableness and stability there must be that which is not constant
in the one hold but puts forth multitudinous acts; over against that
oneness without extent or interval there must be an image of oneness, a
unity of link and succession; over against the immediately infinite and
all-comprehending, that which tends, yes, to infinity but by tending to
a perpetual futurity; over against the Whole in concentration, there
must be that which is to be a Whole by stages never final. The lesser
must always be working towards the increase of its Being, this will be
its imitation of what is immediately complete, self-realized, endless
without stage: only thus can its Being reproduce that of the Higher.

Time, however, is not to be conceived as outside of Soul; Eternity is
not outside of the Authentic Existent: nor is it to be taken as a
sequence or succession to Soul, any more than Eternity is to the Divine.
It is a thing seen upon Soul, inherent, coeval to it, as Eternity to the
Intellectual Realm.
