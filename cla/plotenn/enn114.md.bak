#### Section 12

12\. All that thus proceeds from the supernal combines into a unity and
every existing entity takes something from this blended infusion so that
the result is the thing itself plus some quality. The effluence does not
make the horse but adds something to it; for horse comes by horse, and
man by man: the sun plays its part no doubt in the shaping, but the man
has his origin in the Human-Principle. Outer things have their effect,
sometimes to hurt and sometimes to help; like a father, they often
contribute to good but sometimes also to harm; but they do not wrench
the human being from the foundations of its nature; though sometimes
Matter is the dominant, and the human principle takes the second place
so that there is a failure to achieve perfection; the Ideal has been
attenuated.
