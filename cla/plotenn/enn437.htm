<P>6. Thus we have shown that there exists that which in the
strictest sense possesses self-knowing.

<P>This self-knowing agent, perfect in the 
Intellectual-Principle, is
modified in the Soul.

<P>The difference is that, while the soul knows itself as within
something else, the Intellectual-Principle knows itself as
self-depending, knows all its nature and character, and 
knows by right
of its own being and by simple introversion. When it looks upon the
authentic existences it is looking upon itself; its vision as its
effective existence, and this efficacy is itself since the
Intellectual-Principle and the Intellectual Act are one: this is an
integral seeing itself by its entire being, not a part seeing by a
part.

<P>But has our discussion issued in an Intellectual-Principle
having a persuasive activity [furnishing us with probability]?

<P>No: it brings compulsion not persuasion; compulsion 
belongs to the
Intellectual-Principle, persuasion to the soul or mind, and 
we seem to
desire to be persuaded rather than to see the truth in the pure
intellect.

<P>As long as we were Above, collected within the Intellectual
nature, we were satisfied; we were held in the intellectual act; we
had vision because we drew all into unity- for the thinker in us was
the Intellectual-Principle telling us of itself- and the soul or
mind was motionless, assenting to that act of its prior. But now
that we are once more here- living in the secondary, the 
soul- we seek
for persuasive probabilities: it is through the image we desire to
know the archetype.

<P>Our way is to teach our soul how the Intellectual-Principle
exercises self-vision; the phase thus to be taught is that which
already touches the intellective order, that which we call the
understanding or intelligent soul, indicating by the very 
name that it
is already of itself in some degree an Intellectual-Principle or
that it holds its peculiar power through and from that 
Principle. This
phase must be brought to understand by what means it has knowledge
of the thing it sees and warrant for what it affirms: if it became
what it affirms, it would by that fact possess self-knowing. All its
vision and affirmation being in the Supreme or deriving from 
it- There
where itself also is- it will possess self-knowledge by its 
right as a
Reason-Principle, claiming its kin and bringing all into accord with
the divine imprint upon it.

<P>The soul therefore [to attain self-knowledge] has only 
to set this
image [that is to say, its highest phase] alongside the veritable
Intellectual-Principle which we have found to be identical with the
truths constituting the objects of intellection, the world of
Primals and Reality: for this Intellectual-Principle, by very
definition, cannot be outside of itself, the Intellectual Reality:
self-gathered and unalloyed, it is Intellectual-Principle through
all the range of its being- for unintelligent intelligence is not
possible- and thus it possesses of necessity self-knowing, as a
being immanent to itself and one having for function and 
essence to be
purely and solely Intellectual-Principle. This is no doer; the doer,
not self-intent but looking outward, will have knowledge, in some
kind, of the external, but, if wholly of this practical order, need
have no self-knowledge; where, on the contrary, there is no action-
and of course the pure Intellectual-Principle cannot be straining
after any absent good- the intention can be only towards the self;
at once self-knowing becomes not merely plausible but 
inevitable; what
else could living signify in a being immune from action and existing
in Intellect?
