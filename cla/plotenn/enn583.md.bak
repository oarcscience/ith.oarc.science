#### Section 23

23\. The Motion which acts upon Sensible objects enters from without,
and so shakes, drives, rouses and thrusts its participants that they may
neither rest nor preserve their identity- and all to the end that they
may be caught into that restlessness, that flustering excitability which
is but an image of Life.

We must avoid identifying Motion with the objects moved: by walking we
do not mean the feet but the activity springing from a potentiality in
the feet. Since the potentiality is invisible, we see of necessity only
the active feet- that is to say, not feet simply, as would be the case
if they were at rest, but something besides feet, something invisible
but indirectly seen as an accompaniment by the fact that we observe the
feet to be in ever-changing positions and no longer at rest. We infer
alteration, on the other hand, from the qualitative change in the thing
altered.

Where, then, does Motion reside, when there is one thing that moves and
another that passes from an inherent potentiality to actuality? In the
mover? How then will the moved, the patient, participate in the motion?
In the moved? Then why does not Motion remain in it, once having come?
It would seem that Motion must neither be separated from the active
principle nor allowed to reside in it; it must proceed from agent to
patient without so inhering in the latter as to be severed from the
former, passing from one to the other like a breath of wind.

Now, when the potentiality of Motion consists in an ability to walk, it
may be imagined as thrusting a man forward and causing him to be
continually adopting a different position; when it lies in the capacity
to heat, it heats; when the potentiality takes hold of Matter and builds
up the organism, we have growth; and when another potentiality
demolishes the structure, the result is decay, that which has the
potentiality of demolition experiencing the decay. Where the
birth-giving principle is active, we find birth; where it is impotent
and the power to destroy prevails, destruction takes place- not the
destruction of what already exists, but that which intervenes upon the
road to existence.

Health comes about in the same way- when the power which produces health
is active and predominant; sickness is the result of the opposite power
working in the opposite direction.

Thus, Motion is conditioned, not only by the objects in which it occurs,
but also by its origins and its course, and it is a distinctive mark of
Motion to be always qualified and to take its quality from the moved.
