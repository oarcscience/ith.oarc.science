<P>7. But if it is by becoming evil and inferior that the soul
produces the animal nature, the making of ox or horse was not at the
outset in its character; the reason-principle of the animal, and the
animal itself, must lie outside of the natural plan?

<P>Inferior, yes; but outside of nature, no. The thing 
There [Soul in
the Intellectual] was in some sense horse and dog from the
beginning; given the condition, it produces the higher kind; let the
condition fail, then, since produce it must, it produces what it
may: it is like a skillful craftsman competent to create all kinds
of works of art but reduced to making what is ordered and what the
aptitude of his material indicates.

<P>The power of the All-Soul, as Reason-Principle of the universe,
may be considered as laying down a pattern before the effective
separate powers go forth from it: this plan would be something like
a tentative illumining of Matter; the elaborating soul would give
minute articulation to these representations of itself; 
every separate
effective soul would become that towards which it tended, assuming
that particular form as the choral dancer adapts himself to 
the action
set down for him.

<P>But this is to anticipate: our enquiry was How there can be
sense-perception in man without the implication that the Divine
addresses itself to the realm of process. We maintained, and proved,
that the Divine does not look to this realm but that things here are
dependent upon those and represent them and that man here, 
holding his
powers from Thence, is directed Thither, so that, while sense makes
the environment of what is of sense in him, the Intellectual 
in him is
linked to the Intellectual.

<P>What we have called the perceptibles of that realm enter into
cognisance in a way of their own, since they are not material, while
the sensible sense here- so distinguished as dealing with corporeal
objects- is fainter than the perception belonging to that higher
world; the man of this sphere has sense-perception because 
existing in
a less true degree and taking only enfeebled images of things There-
perceptions here are Intellections of the dimmer order, and the
Intellections There are vivid perceptions.
