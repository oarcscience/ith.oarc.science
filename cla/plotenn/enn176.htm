<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 1</H4>

<P>1. In the two orders of things- those whose existence is that of
process and those in whom it is Authentic Being- there is a 
variety of
possible relation to Cause.

<P>Cause might conceivably underly all the entities in both 
orders or
none in either. It might underly some, only, in each order, 
the others
being causeless. It might, again, underly the Realm of Process
universally while in the Realm of Authentic Existence some 
things were
caused, others not, or all were causeless. Conceivably, on the other
hand, the Authentic Existents are all caused while in the Realm of
Process some things are caused and others not, or all are causeless.

<P>Now, to begin with the Eternal Existents:

<P>The Firsts among these, by the fact that they are Firsts, cannot
be referred to outside Causes; but all such as depend upon those
Firsts may be admitted to derive their Being from them.

<P>And in all cases the Act may be referred to the Essence [as its
cause], for their Essence consists, precisely, in giving forth an
appropriate Act.

<P>As for Things of Process- or for Eternal Existents whose Act is
not eternally invariable- we must hold that these are due to Cause;
Causelessness is quite inadmissible; we can make no place here for
unwarranted "slantings," for sudden movement of bodies apart from
any initiating power, for precipitate spurts in a soul with 
nothing to
drive it into the new course of action. Such causelessness would
bind the Soul under an even sterner compulsion, no longer master of
itself, but at the mercy of movements apart from will and cause.
Something willed- within itself or without- something desired, must
lead it to action; without motive it can have no motion.

<P>On the assumption that all happens by Cause, it is easy to
discover the nearest determinants of any particular act or state and
to trace it plainly to them.

<P>The cause of a visit to the centre of affairs will be that one
thinks it necessary to see some person or to receive a debt, or, in
a word, that one has some definite motive or impulse confirmed by a
judgement of expediency. Sometimes a condition may be referred to
the arts, the recovery of health for instance to medical science and
the doctor. Wealth has for its cause the discovery of a treasure or
the receipt of a gift, or the earning of money by manual or
intellectual labour. The child is traced to the father as its Cause
and perhaps to a chain of favourable outside circumstances such as a
particular diet or, more immediately, a special organic aptitude or
a wife apt to childbirth.

<P>And the general cause of all is Nature.
