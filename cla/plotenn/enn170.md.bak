#### Section 15

15\. There is, however, one matter which we must on no account overlook-
the effect of these teachings upon the hearers led by them into
despising the world and all that is in it.

There are two theories as to the attainment of the End of life. The one
proposes pleasure, bodily pleasure, as the term; the other pronounces
for good and virtue, the desire of which comes from God and moves, by
ways to be studied elsewhere, towards God.

Epicurus denies a Providence and recommends pleasure and its enjoyment,
all that is left to us: but the doctrine under discussion is still more
wanton; it carps at Providence and the Lord of Providence; it scorns
every law known to us; immemorial virtue and all restraint it makes into
a laughing stock, lest any loveliness be seen on earth; it cuts at the
root of all orderly living, and of the righteousness which, innate in
the moral sense, is made perfect by thought and by self-discipline: all
that would give us a noble human being is gone. What is left for them
except where the pupil by his own character betters the teaching- comes
to pleasure, self-seeking, the grudge of any share with one's fellows,
the pursuit of advantage.

Their error is that they know nothing good here: all they care for is
something else to which they will at some future time apply themselves:
yet, this world, to those that have known it once, must be the
starting-point of the pursuit: arrived here from out of the divine
nature, they must inaugurate their effort by some earthly correction.
The understanding of beauty is not given except to a nature scorning the
delight of the body, and those that have no part in well-doing can make
no step towards the Supernal.

This school, in fact, is convicted by its neglect of all mention of
virtue: any discussion of such matters is missing utterly: we are not
told what virtue is or under what different kinds it appears; there is
no word of all the numerous and noble reflections upon it that have come
down to us from the ancients; we do not learn what constitutes it or how
it is acquired, how the Soul is tended, how it is cleaned. For to say
"Look to God" is not helpful without some instruction as to what this
looking imports: it might very well be said that one can "look" and
still sacrifice no pleasure, still be the slave of impulse, repeating
the word God but held in the grip of every passion and making no effort
to master any. Virtue, advancing towards the Term and, linked with
thought, occupying a Soul makes God manifest: God on the lips, without a
good conduct of life, is a word.
