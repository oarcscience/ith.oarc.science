<P>12. Or take it another way: Since in our view this 
universe stands
to that as copy to original, the living total must exist There
beforehand; that is the realm of complete Being and everything must
exist There.

<P>The sky There must be living and therefore not bare of 
stars, here
known as the heavens- for stars are included in the very meaning of
the word. Earth too will be There, and not void but even more
intensely living and containing all that lives and moves upon our
earth and the plants obviously rooted in life; sea will be There and
all waters with the movement of their unending life and all 
the living
things of the water; air too must be a member of that universe with
the living things of air as here.

<P>The content of that living thing must surely be alive- as in
this sphere- and all that lives must of necessity be There. 
The nature
of the major parts determines that of the living forms they
comprise; by the being and content of the heaven There are
determined all the heavenly forms of life; if those lesser forms
were not There, that heaven itself would not be.

<P>To ask how those forms of life come to be There is simply asking
how that heaven came to be; it is asking whence comes life, 
whence the
All-Life, whence the All-Soul, whence collective Intellect: and the
answer is that There no indigence or impotence can exist but all
must be teeming, seething, with life. All flows, so to 
speak, from one
fount not to be thought of as one breath or warmth but rather as one
quality englobing and safeguarding all qualities- sweetness with
fragrance, wine- quality and the savours of everything that may be
tasted, all colours seen, everything known to touch, all that ear
may hear, all melodies, every rhythm.
