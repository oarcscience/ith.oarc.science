#### Section 4

4\. But is this lower extremity of our intellective phase fettered to
body for ever?

No: if we turn, this turns by the same act.

And the Soul of the All- are we to think that when it turns from this
sphere its lower phase similarly withdraws?

No: for it never accompanied that lower phase of itself; it never knew
any coming, and therefore never came down; it remains unmoved above, and
the material frame of the Universe draws close to it, and, as it were,
takes light from it, no hindrance to it, in no way troubling it, simply
lying unmoved before it.

But has the Universe, then, no sensation? "It has no Sight," we read,
since it has no eyes, and obviously it has not ears, nostrils, or
tongue. Then has it perhaps such a consciousness as we have of our own
inner conditions?

No: where all is the working out of one nature, there is nothing but
still rest; there is not even enjoyment. Sensibility is present as the
quality of growth is, unrecognized. But the Nature of the World will be
found treated elsewhere; what stands here is all that the question of
the moment demands.
