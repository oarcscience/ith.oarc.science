<P>31. But if each of the two phases of the soul, as we have said,
possesses memory, and memory is vested in the imaging faculty, there
must be two such faculties. Now that is all very well as long as the
two souls stand apart; but, when they are at one in us, what becomes
of the two faculties, and in which of them is the imaging faculty
vested?

<P>If each soul has its own imaging faculty the images must in all
cases be duplicated, since we cannot think that one faculty 
deals only
with intellectual objects, and the other with objects of sense, a
distinction which inevitably implies the co-existence in man of two
life-principles utterly unrelated.

<P>And if both orders of image act upon both orders of soul, what
difference is there in the souls; and how does the fact escape our
knowledge?

<P>The answer is that, when the two souls chime each with each, the
two imaging faculties no longer stand apart; the union is 
dominated by
the more powerful of the faculties of the soul, and thus the image
perceived is as one: the less powerful is like a shadow 
attending upon
the dominant, like a minor light merging into a greater: 
when they are
in conflict, in discord, the minor is distinctly apart, a
self-standing thing- though its isolation is not perceived, for the
simple reason that the separate being of the two souls escapes
observation.

<P>The two have run into a unity in which, yet, one is the loftier:
this loftier knows all; when it breaks from the union, it 
retains some
of the experiences of its companion, but dismisses others; thus we
accept the talk of our less valued associates, but, on a change of
company, we remember little from the first set and more from those
in whom we recognize a higher quality.
