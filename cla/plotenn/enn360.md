#### Section 41

41\. The prayer is answered by the mere fact that part and other part
are wrought to one tone like a musical string which, plucked at one end,
vibrates at the other also. Often, too, the sounding of one string
awakens what might pass for a perception in another, the result of their
being in harmony and tuned to one musical scale; now, if the vibration
in a lyre affects another by virtue of the sympathy existing between
them, then certainly in the All- even though it is constituted in
contraries- there must be one melodic system; for it contains its
unisons as well, and its entire content, even to those contraries, is a
kinship.

Thus, too, whatever is hurtful to man- the passionate spirit, for
example, drawn by the medium of the gall into the principle seated in
the liver- comes with no intention of hurt; it is simply as one
transferring fire to another might innocently burn him: no doubt, since
he actually set the other on fire he is a cause, but only as the
attacking fire itself is a cause, that is by the merely accidental fact
that the person to whom the fire was being brought blundered in taking
it.
