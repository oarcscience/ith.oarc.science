<P>17. But what of the Infinite Number we hear of; does not all
this reasoning set it under limit?

<P>And rightly so if the thing is to be a number; limitlessness and
number are in contradiction.

<P>How, then, do we come to use the term? Is it that we think of
Number as we think of an infinite line, not with the idea that any
such lire exists but that even the very greatest- that of 
the [path of
the] universe, for example- may be thought of as still greater? So
it might be with number; let it be fixed, yet we still are free to
think of its double, though not of course to produce the doubled
quantity since it is impossible to join to the actual what is no
more than a conception, a phantasm, private to ourselves.

<P>It is our view that there does exist an infinite line, among the
Intellectual Beings: for There a line would not be quantitative and
being without quantity could be numerically infinite. This however
would be in another mode than that of limitless extension. In what
mode then? In that the conception of the Absolute Line does not
include the conception of limit.

<P>But what sort of thing is the Line in the Intellectual and what
place does it hold?

<P>It is later than Number since unity is observed in it; 
it rises at
one point and traverses one course and simply lacks the quantity
that would be the measure of the distance.

<P>But where does this thing lie? Is it existent only in 
the defining
thought, so to speak?

<P>No; it is also a thing, though a thing of the Intellectual. All
that belongs to that order is at once an Intellectual and in some
degree the concrete thing. There is a position, as well as a 
manner of
being, for all configurations, for surface, for solid. And certainly
the configurations are not of our devising; for example, the
configurations of the universe are obviously antecedent to
ourselves; so it must be with all the configurations of the things
of nature; before the bodily reproductions all must exist There,
without configuration, primal configurations. For these primals are
not shapes in something; self-belonging, they are perfect without
extension; only the extended needs the external. In the sphere of
Real-Being the configuration is always a unity; it becomes discrete
either in the Living-Form or immediately before: I say "becomes
discrete" not in the sense that it takes magnitude There but that it
is broken apart for the purpose of the Living-Form and is allotted
to the bodies within that Form- for instance, to Fire There, the
Intellectual Pyramid. And because the Ideal-Form is There, 
the fire of
this sphere seeks to produce that configuration against the check of
Matter: and so of all the rest as we read in the account of the
realm of sense.

<P>But does the Life-Form contain the configurations by the 
mere fact
of its life?

<P>They are in the Intellectual-Principle previously but they also
exist in the Living-Form; if this be considered as including the
Intellectual-Principle, then they are primally in the Life-Form, but
if that Principle comes first then they are previously in 
that. And if
the Life-Form entire contains also souls, it must certainly be
subsequent to the Intellectual-Principle.

<P>No doubt there is the passage "Whatever Intellect sees in the
entire Life-Form"; thus seeing, must not the 
Intellectual-Principle be
the later?

<P>No; the seeing may imply merely that the reality comes into being
by the fact of that seeing; the Intellectual-Principle is 
not external
to the Life-Form; all is one; the Act of the Intellectual-Principle
possesses itself of bare sphere, while the Life-Form holds the
sphere as sphere of a living total.
