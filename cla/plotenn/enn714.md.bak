#### Section 11

11\. This is the purport of that rule of our Mysteries: Nothing Divulged
to the Uninitiate: the Supreme is not to be made a common story, the
holy things may not be uncovered to the stranger, to any that has not
himself attained to see. There were not two; beholder was one with
beheld; it was not a vision compassed but a unity apprehended. The man
formed by this mingling with the Supreme must- if he only remember-
carry its image impressed upon him: he is become the Unity, nothing
within him or without inducing any diversity; no movement now, no
passion, no outlooking desire, once this ascent is achieved; reasoning
is in abeyance and all Intellection and even, to dare the word, the very
self; caught away, filled with God, he has in perfect stillness attained
isolation; all the being calmed, he turns neither to this side nor to
that, not even inwards to himself; utterly resting he has become very
rest. He belongs no longer to the order of the beautiful; he has risen
beyond beauty; he has overpassed even the choir of the virtues; he is
like one who, having penetrated the inner sanctuary, leaves the temple
images behind him- though these become once more first objects of regard
when he leaves the holies; for There his converse was not with image,
not with trace, but with the very Truth in the view of which all the
rest is but of secondary concern.

There, indeed, it was scarcely vision, unless of a mode unknown; it was
a going forth from the self, a simplifying, a renunciation, a reach
towards contact and at the same time a repose, a meditation towards
adjustment. This is the only seeing of what lies within the holies: to
look otherwise is to fail.

Things here are signs; they show therefore to the wiser teachers how the
supreme God is known; the instructed priest reading the sign may enter
the holy place and make real the vision of the inaccessible.

Even those that have never found entry must admit the existence of that
invisible; they will know their source and Principle since by principle
they see principle and are linked with it, by like they have contact
with like and so they grasp all of the divine that lies within the scope
of mind. Until the seeing comes they are still craving something, that
which only the vision can give; this Term, attained only by those that
have overpassed all, is the All-Transcending.

It is not in the soul's nature to touch utter nothingness; the lowest
descent is into evil and, so far, into non-being: but to utter nothing,
never. When the soul begins again to mount, it comes not to something
alien but to its very self; thus detached, it is not in nothingness but
in itself; self-gathered it is no longer in the order of being; it is in
the Supreme.

There is thus a converse in virtue of which the essential man outgrows
Being, becomes identical with the Transcendent of Being. The self thus
lifted, we are in the likeness of the Supreme: if from that heightened
self we pass still higher- image to archetype- we have won the Term of
all our journeying. Fallen back again, we awaken the virtue within until
we know ourselves all order once more; once more we are lightened of the
burden and move by virtue towards Intellectual-Principle and through the
Wisdom in That to the Supreme.

This is the life of gods and of the godlike and blessed among men,
liberation from the alien that besets us here, a life taking no pleasure
in the things of earth, the passing of solitary to solitary.

THE END .
