<P>13. For Intellectual-Principle is not a simplex, nor is the soul
that proceeds from it: on the contrary things include variety in the
degree of their simplicity, that is to say in so far as they are not
compounds but Principles and Activities;- the activity of the lowest
is simple in the sense of being a fading-out, that of the 
First as the
total of all activity. Intellectual-Principle is moved in a movement
unfailingly true to one course, but its unity and identity are not
those of the partial; they are those of its universality; and indeed
the partial itself is not a unity but divides to infinity.

<P>We know that Intellectual-Principle has a source and advances to
some term as its ultimate; now, is the intermediate between 
source and
term to thought of as a line or as some distinct kind of body
uniform and unvaried?

<P>Where at that would be its worth? it had no change, if no
differentiation woke it into life, it would not be a Force; that
condition would in no way differ from mere absence of power and,
even calling it movement, it would still be the movement of 
a life not
all-varied but indiscriminate; now it is of necessity that life be
all-embracing, covering all the realms, and that nothing 
fail of life.
Intellectual-Principle, therefore, must move in every direction upon
all, or more precisely must ever have so moved.

<P>A simplex moving retains its character; either there is 
no change,
movement has been null, or if there has been advance it still
remains a simplex and at once there is a permanent duality: 
if the one
member of this duality is identical with the other, then it is still
as it was, there has been no advance; if one member differs from the
other, it has advanced with differentiation, and, out of a certain
identity and difference, it has produced a third unity. This
production, based on Identity and Difference, must be in its nature
identical and different; it will be not some particular different
thing but Collective Difference, as its Identity is Collective
Identity.

<P>Being, thus, at once Collective Identity and Collective
Difference, Intellectual-Principle must reach over all different
things; its very nature then is to modify into a universe. If the
realm of different things existed before it, these different things
must have modified it from the beginning; if they did not, this
Intellectual-Principle produced all, or, rather, was all.

<P>Beings could not exist save by the activity of
Intellectual-Principle; wandering down every way it produces thing
after thing, but wandering always within itself in such self-bound
wandering as authentic Intellect may know; this wandering 
permitted to
its nature is among real beings which keep pace with its 
movement; but
it is always itself; this is a stationary wandering, a wandering
within the Meadow of Truth from which it does not stray.

<P>It holds and covers the universe which it has made the space, so
to speak, of its movement, itself being also that universe which is
space to it. And this Meadow of Truth is varied so that movement
through it may be possible; suppose it not always and everywhere
varied, the failing of diversity is a failure of movement; failure
in movement would mean a failing of the Intellectual Act; halting,
it has ceased to exercise its Intellectual Act; this ceasing, it
ceases to be.

<P>The Intellectual-Principle is the Intellectual Act; its movement
is complete, filling Being complete; And the entire of Being is the
Intellectual Act entire, comprehending all life and the unfailing
succession of things. Because this Principle contains Identity and
Difference its division is ceaselessly bringing the different things
to light. Its entire movement is through life and among 
living things.
To a traveller over land, all is earth but earth abounding in
difference: so in this journey the life through which
Intellectual-Principle passes is one life but, in its ceaseless
changing, a varied life.

<P>Throughout this endless variation it maintains the one course
because it is not, itself, subject to change but on the contrary is
present as identical and unvarying Being to the rest of 
things. For if
there be no such principle of unchanging identity to things, all is
dead, activity and actuality exist nowhere. These "other things"
through which it passes are also Intellectual-Principle itself;
otherwise it is not the all-comprehending principle: if it is to be
itself, it must be all-embracing; failing that, it is not itself. If
it is complete in itself, complete because all-embracing, 
and there is
nothing which does not find place in this total, then there can be
nothing belonging to it which is not different; only by 
difference can
there be such co-operation towards a total. If it knew no otherness
but was pure identity its essential Being would be the less for that
failure to fulfil the specific nature which its completion requires.
