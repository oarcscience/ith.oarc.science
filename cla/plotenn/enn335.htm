<P>16. But if in the soul thing follows thing, if there is earlier
and later in its productions, if it engenders or creates in 
time, then
it must be looking towards the future; and if towards the 
future, then
towards the past as well?

<P>No: prior and past are in the things its produces; in itself
nothing is past; all, as we have said, is one simultaneous 
grouping of
Reason-Principles. In the engendered, dissimilarity is not
compatible with unity, though in the Reason-Principles supporting
the engendered such unity of dissimilars does occur- hand 
and foot are
in unity in the Reason-Principle [of man], but apart in the realm of
sense. Of course, even in that ideal realm there is apartness, but
in a characteristic mode, just as in a mode, there is priority.

<P>Now, apartness may be explained as simply 
differentiation: but how
account for priority unless on the assumption of some ordering
principle arranging from above, and in that disposal necessarily
affirming a serial order?

<P>There must be such a principle, or all would exist 
simultaneously;
but the indicated conclusion does not follow unless order 
and ordering
principle are distinct; if the ordering principle is Primal Order,
there is no such affirmation of series; there is simply making, the
making of this thing after that thing. The affirmation would imply
that the ordering principle looks away towards Order and therefore
is not, itself, Order.

<P>But how are Order and this orderer one and the same?

<P>Because the ordering principle is no conjoint of matter and idea
but is soul, pure idea, the power and energy second only to the
Intellectual-Principle: and because the succession is a fact of the
things themselves, inhibited as they are from this comprehensive
unity. The ordering soul remains august, a circle, as we may figure
it, in complete adaptation to its centre, widening outward, but fast
upon it still, an outspreading without interval.

<P>The total scheme may be summarized in the illustration 
of The Good
as a centre, the Intellectual-Principle as an unmoving circle, the
Soul as a circle in motion, its moving being its aspiration: the
Intellectual-Principle possesses and has ever embraced that which is
beyond being; the soul must seek it still: the sphere of the 
universe,
by its possession of the soul thus aspirant, is moved to the
aspiration which falls within its own nature; this is no more than
such power as body may have, the mode of pursuit possible where the
object pursued is debarred from entrance; it is the motion of
coiling about, with ceaseless return upon the same path- in other
words, it is circuit.
