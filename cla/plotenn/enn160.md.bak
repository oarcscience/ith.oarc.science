#### Section 5

5\. Still more unreasonably:

There are men, bound to human bodies and subject to desire, grief,
anger, who think so generously of their own faculty that they declare
themselves in contact with the Intelligible World, but deny that the sun
possesses a similar faculty less subject to influence, to disorder, to
change; they deny that it is any wiser than we, the late born, hindered
by so many cheats on the way towards truth.

Their own soul, the soul of the least of mankind, they declare
deathless, divine; but the entire heavens and the stars within the
heavens have had no communion with the Immortal Principle, though these
are far purer and lovelier than their own souls- yet they are not blind
to the order, the shapely pattern, the discipline prevailing in the
heavens, since they are the loudest in complaint of the disorder that
troubles our earth. We are to imagine the deathless Soul choosing of
design the less worthy place, and preferring to abandon the nobler to
the Soul that is to die.

Equally unreasonable is their introduction of that other Soul which they
piece together from the elements.

How could any form or degree of life come about by a blend of the
elements? Their conjunction could produce only a warm or cold or an
intermediate substance, something dry or wet or intermediate.

Besides, how could such a soul be a bond holding the four elements
together when it is a later thing and rises from them? And this element-
soul is described as possessing consciousness and will and the rest-
what can we think?

Furthermore, these teachers, in their contempt for this creation and
this earth, proclaim that another earth has been made for them into
which they are to enter when they depart. Now this new earth is the
Reason-Form \[the Logos\] of our world. Why should they desire to live
in the archetype of a world abhorrent to them?

Then again, what is the origin of that pattern world? It would appear,
from the theory, that the Maker had already declined towards the things
of this sphere before that pattern came into being.

Now let us suppose the Maker craving to construct such an Intermediate
World- though what motive could He have?- in addition to the
Intellectual world which He eternally possesses. If He made the
mid-world first, what end was it to serve?

To be a dwelling-place for Souls?

How then did they ever fall from it? It exists in vain.

If He made it later than this world- abstracting the formal-idea of this
world and leaving the Matter out- the Souls that have come to know that
intermediate sphere would have experienced enough to keep them from
entering this. If the meaning is simply that Souls exhibit the
Ideal-Form of the Universe, what is there distinctive in the teaching?
