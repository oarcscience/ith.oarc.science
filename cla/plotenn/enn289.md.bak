#### Section 3

3\. Is it a question of part in the sense that, taking one living being,
the soul in a finger might be called a part of the soul entire?

This would carry the alternative that either there is no soul outside of
body, or that- no soul being within body- the thing described as the
soul of the universe is, none the less, outside the body of the
universe. That is a point to be investigated, but for the present we
must consider what kind of soul this parallel would give us.

If the particular soul is a part of the All-Soul only in the sense that
this bestows itself upon all living things of the partial sphere, such a
self-bestowal does not imply division; on the contrary, it is the
identical soul that is present everywhere, the one complete thing,
multi-present at the one moment: there is no longer question of a soul
that is a part against a soul that is an all- especially where an
identical power is present. Even difference of function, as in eyes and
ears, cannot warrant the assertion of distinct parts concerned in each
separate act- with other parts again making allotment of faculty- all is
met by the notion of one identical thing, but a thing in which a
distinct power operates in each separate function. All the powers are
present either in seeing or in hearing; the difference in impression
received is due to the difference in the organs concerned; all the
varying impressions are our various responses to Ideal-forms that can be
taken in a variety of modes.

A further proof \[of the unity of Soul\] is that perception demands a
common gathering place; every organ has its distinct function, and is
competent only upon its own material, and must interpret each several
experience in its own fashion; the judgement upon these impressions
must, then, be vested in some one principle, a judge informed upon all
that is said and done.

But again: "Everywhere, Unity": in the variety of functions if each
"part of the soul" were as distinct as are the entrant sensations, none
of those parts could have knowledge; awareness would belong only to that
judging faculty- or, if local, every such act of awareness would stand
quite unrelated to any other. But since the soul is a rational soul, by
the very same title by which it is an All-Soul, and is called the
rational soul, in the sense of being a whole \[and so not merely
"reasoning locally"\], then what is thought of as a part must in reality
be no part but the identity of an unparted thing.
