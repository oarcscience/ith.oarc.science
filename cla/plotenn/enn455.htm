<P>3. Thus we have here one identical Principle, the 
Intellect, which
is the universe of authentic beings, the Truth: as such it is a
great god or, better, not a god among gods but the Godhead entire.
It is a god, a secondary god manifesting before there is any 
vision of
that other, the Supreme which rests over all, enthroned in
transcendence upon that splendid pediment, the Nature following
close upon it.

<P>The Supreme in its progress could never be borne forward 
upon some
soulless vehicle nor even directly upon the soul: it will be
heralded by some ineffable beauty: before the great King in his
progress there comes first the minor train, then rank by rank the
greater and more exalted, closer to the King the kinglier; next his
own honoured company until, last among all these grandeurs, suddenly
appears the Supreme Monarch himself, and all- unless indeed for
those who have contented themselves with the spectacle before his
coming and gone away- prostrate themselves and hail him.

<P>In that royal progress the King is of another order from those
that go before him, but the King in the Supreme is no ruler over
externs; he holds that most just of governances, rooted in 
nature, the
veritable kingship, for he is King of Truth, holding sway by all
reason over a dense offspring his own, a host that shares his
divinity, King over a king and over kings and even more justly
called father of Gods.

<P>[Interpolation: Zeus (Universal Soul) is in this a symbol of
him, Zeus who is not content with the contemplation of his father
(Kronos, divine Intellect) but looks to that father's father (to
Ouranos, the Transcendent) as what may be called the divine energy
working to the establishment of a real being.]
