<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 1</H4>

<P>1. "The Intellectual-Principle" [= the Divine Mind]- we read [in
the Timaeus]- "looks upon the Ideas indwelling in that Being which
is the Essentially Living [= according to Plotinus, the Intellectual
Realm], "and then"- the text proceeds- "the Creator judged that all
the content of that essentially living Being must find place in this
lower universe also."

<P>Are we meant to gather that the Ideas came into being before the
Intellectual-Principle so that it "sees them" as previously existent?

<P>The first step is to make sure whether the "Living Being" of the
text is to be distinguished from the Intellectual-Principle 
as another
thing than it.

<P>It might be argued that the Intellectual-Principle is the
Contemplator and therefore that the Living-Being contemplated is not
the Intellectual-Principle but must be described as the Intellectual
Object so that the Intellectual-Principle must possess the 
Ideal realm
as something outside of itself.

<P>But this would mean that it possesses images and not the
realities, since the realities are in the Intellectual Realm which
it contemplates: Reality- we read- is in the Authentic Existent
which contains the essential form of particular things.

<P>No: even though the Intellectual-Principle and the Intellectual
Object are distinct, they are not apart except for just that
distinction.

<P>Nothing in the statement cited is inconsistent with the 
conception
that these two constitute one substance- though, in a unity, 
admitting
that distinction, of the intellectual act [as against passivity],
without which there can be no question of an Intellectual-Principle
and an Intellectual Object: what is meant is not that the
contemplatory Being possesses its vision as in some other principle,
but that it contains the Intellectual Realm within itself.

<P>The Intelligible Object is the Intellectual-Principle itself in
its repose, unity, immobility: the Intellectual-Principle,
contemplator of that object- of the Intellectual-Principle thus in
repose is an active manifestation of the same Being, an Act which
contemplates its unmoved phase and, as thus contemplating, stands as
Intellectual-Principle to that of which it has the 
intellection: it is
Intellectual-Principle in virtue of having that intellection, and at
the same time is Intellectual Object, by assimilation.

<P>This, then, is the Being which planned to create in the lower
Universe what it saw existing in the Supreme, the four orders of
living beings.

<P>No doubt the passage: [of the Timaeus] seems to imply 
tacitly that
this planning Principle is distinct from the other two: but 
the three-
the Essentially-Living, the Intellectual-Principle and this planning
Principle will, to others, be manifestly one: the truth is that, by
a common accident, a particular trend of thought has occasioned the
discrimination.

<P>We have dealt with the first two; but the third- this Principle
which decides to work upon the objects [the Ideas] 
contemplated by the
Intellectual-Principle within the Essentially-Living, to create
them, to establish them in their partial existence- what is this
third?

<P>It is possible that in one aspect the Intellectual-Principle is
the principle of partial existence, while in another aspect 
it is not.

<P>The entities thus particularized from the unity are products of
the Intellectual-Principle which thus would be, to that extent, the
separating agent. On the other hand it remains in itself, 
indivisible;
division begins with its offspring which, of course, means 
with Souls:
and thus a Soul- with its particular Souls- may be the separative
principle.

<P>This is what is conveyed where we are told that the separation
is the work of the third Principle and begins within the 
Third: for to
this Third belongs the discursive reasoning which is no function of
the Intellectual-Principle but characteristic of its secondary, of
Soul, to which precisely, divided by its own Kind, belongs the Act
of division.
