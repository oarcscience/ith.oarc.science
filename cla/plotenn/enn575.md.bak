#### Section 15

15\. How far is it true that equality and inequality are characteristic
of Quantity?

Triangles, it is significant, are said to be similar rather than equal.
But we also refer to magnitudes as similar, and the accepted connotation
of similarity does not exclude similarity or dissimilarity in Quantity.
It may, of course, be the case that the term "similarity" has a
different sense here from that understood in reference to Quality.

Furthermore, if we are told that equality and inequality are
characteristic of Quantity, that is not to deny that similarity also may
be predicated of certain quantities. If, on the contrary, similarity and
dissimilarity are to be confined to Quality, the terms as applied to
Quantity must, as we have said, bear a different meaning.

But suppose similarity to be identical in both genera; Quantity and
Quality must then be expected to reveal other properties held in common.

May the truth be this: that similarity is predicable of Quantity only in
so far as Quantity possesses \[qualitative\] differences? But as a
general rule differences are grouped with that of which they are
differences, especially when the difference is a difference of that
thing alone. If in one case the difference completes the substance and
not in another, we inevitably class it with that which it completes, and
only consider it as independent when it is not complementary: when we
say "completes the substance," we refer not to Subtance as such but to
the differentiated substance; the particular object is to be thought of
as receiving an accession which is non-substantial.

We must not however fad to observe that we predicate equality of
triangles, rectangles, and figures generally, whether plane or solid:
this may be given as a ground for regarding equality and inequality as
characteristic of Quantity.

It remains to enquire whether similarity and dissimilarity are
characteristic of Quality.

We have spoken of Quality as combining with other entities, Matter and
Quantity, to form the complete Sensible Substance; this Substance, so
called, may be supposed to constitute the manifold world of Sense, which
is not so much an essence as a quale. Thus, for the essence of fire we
must look to the Reason-Principle; what produces the visible aspect is,
properly speaking, a quale.

Man's essence will lie in his Reason-Principle; that which is perfected
in the corporeal nature is a mere image of the Reason-Principle a quale
rather than an essence.

Consider: the visible Socrates is a man, yet we give the name of
Socrates to that likeness of him in a portrait, which consists of mere
colours, mere pigments: similarly, it is a Reason-Principle which
constitutes Socrates, but we apply the name Socrates to the Socrates we
see: in truth, however, the colours and shapes which make up the visible
Socrates are but reproductions of those in the Reason-Principle, while
this Reason-Principle itself bears a corresponding relation to the
truest Reason-Principle of Man. But we need not elaborate this point.
