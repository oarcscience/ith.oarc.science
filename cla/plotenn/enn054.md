#### Section 5

5\. We are asked to believe, then, it will be objected, that if one man
has been happy from first to last, another only at the last, and a
third, beginning with happiness, has lost it, their shares are equal?

This is straying from the question: we were comparing the happy among
themselves: now we are asked to compare the not-happy at the time when
they are out of happiness with those in actual possession of happiness.
If these last are better off, they are so as men in possession of
happiness against men without it and their advantage is always by
something in the present.
