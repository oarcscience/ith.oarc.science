<P>3. The Soul once seen to be thus precious, thus divine, you may
hold the faith that by its possession you are already nearing God:
in the strength of this power make upwards towards Him: at no great
distance you must attain: there is not much between.

<P>But over this divine, there is still a diviner: grasp the upward
neighbour of the soul, its prior and source.

<P>Soul, for all the worth we have shown to belong to it, is yet a
secondary, an image of the Intellectual-Principle: reason uttered is
an image of the reason stored within the soul, and in the same way
soul is an utterance of the Intellectual-Principle: it is even the
total of its activity, the entire stream of life sent forth by that
Principle to the production of further being; it is the forthgoing
heat of a fire which has also heat essentially inherent. But within
the Supreme we must see energy not as an overflow but in the double
aspect of integral inherence with the establishment of a new being.
Sprung, in other words, from the Intellectual-Principle, Soul is
intellective, but with an intellection operation by the method of
reasonings: for its perfecting it must look to that Divine 
Mind, which
may be thought of as a father watching over the development of his
child born imperfect in comparison with himself.

<P>Thus its substantial existence comes from the
Intellectual-Principle; and the Reason within it becomes Act 
in virtue
of its contemplation of that prior; for its thought and act are its
own intimate possession when it looks to the Supreme Intelligence;
those only are soul-acts which are of this intellective 
nature and are
determined by its own character; all that is less noble is foreign
[traceable to Matter] and is accidental to the soul in the course of
its peculiar task.

<P>In two ways, then, the Intellectual-Principle enhances the
divine quality of the soul, as father and as immanent presence;
nothing separates them but the fact that they are not one and the
same, that there is succession, that over against a recipient there
stands the ideal-form received; but this recipient, Matter to the
Supreme Intelligence, is also noble as being at once informed by
divine intellect and uncompounded.

<P>What the Intellectual-Principle must be is carried in the single
word that Soul, itself so great, is still inferior.
