#### Section 27

27\. If the earth transmits the generative soul to growing things- or
retains it while allowing a vestige of it to constitute the vegetal
principle in them- at once the earth is ensouled, as our flesh is, and
any generative power possessed by the plant world is of its bestowing:
this phase of the soul is immanent in the body of the growing thing, and
transmits to it that better element by which it differs from the broken
off part no longer a thing of growth but a mere lump of material.

But does the entire body of the earth similarly receive anything from
the soul?

Yes: for we must recognize that earthly material broken off from the
main body differs from the same remaining continuously attached; thus
stones increase as long as they are embedded, and, from the moment they
are separated, stop at the size attained.

We must conclude, then, that every part and member of the earth carries
its vestige of this principle of growth, an under-phase of that entire
principle which belongs not to this or that member but to the earth as a
whole: next in order is the nature \[the soul-phase\], concerned with
sensation, this not interfused \[like the vegetal principle\] but in
contact from above: then the higher soul and the Intellectual-Principle,
constituting together the being known as Hestia \[Earth-Mind\] and
Demeter \[Earth-Soul\]- a nomenclature indicating the human intuition of
these truths, asserted in the attribution of a divine name and nature.
