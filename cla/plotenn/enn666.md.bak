#### Section 28

28\. Now to see what all this reasoning has established:

Universally, what approaches as a good is a Form; Matter itself contains
this good which is Form: are we to conclude that, if Matter had will, it
would desire to be Form unalloyed?

No: that would be desiring its own destruction, for the good seeks to
subject everything to itself. But perhaps Matter would not wish to
remain at its own level but would prefer to attain Being and, this
acquired, to lay aside its evil.

If we are asked how the evil thing can have tendency towards the good,
we answer that we have not attributed tendency to Matter; our argument
needed the hypothesis of sensation in Matter- in so far as possible
consistently with retention of its character- and we asserted that the
entry of Form, that dream of the Good, must raise it to a nobler order.
If then Matter is Evil, there is no more to be said; if it is something
else- a wrong thing, let us say- then in the hypothesis that its essence
acquire sensation would not the appropriate upon the next or higher
plane be its good, as in the other cases? But not what is evil in Matter
would be the quester of good but that element in it \[lowest Form\]
which in it is associated with evil.

But if Matter by very essence is evil how could it choose the good?

This question implies that if Evil were self-conscious it would admire
itself: but how can the unadmirable be admired; and did we not discover
that the good must be apt to the nature?

There that question may rest. But if universally the good is Form and
the higher the ascent the more there is of Form-Soul more truly Form
than body is and phases of soul progressively of higher Form and
Intellectual-Principle standing as Form to soul collectively- then the
Good advances by the opposite of Matter and, therefore, by a cleansing
and casting away to the utmost possible at each stage: and the greatest
good must be there where all that is of Matter has disappeared. The
Principle of Good rejecting Matter entirely- or rather never having come
near it at any point or in any way- must hold itself aloft with that
Formless in which Primal Form takes its origin. But we will return to
this.
