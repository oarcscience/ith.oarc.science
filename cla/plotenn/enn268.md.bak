#### Section 3

3\. But if this Reason-Principle \[Nature\] is in act- and produces by
the process indicated- how can it have any part in Contemplation?

To begin with, since in all its production it is stationary and intact,
a Reason-Principle self-indwelling, it is in its own nature a
Contemplative act. All doing must be guided by an Idea, and will
therefore be distinct from that Idea: the Reason-Principle then, as
accompanying and guiding the work, will be distinct from the work; not
being action but Reason-Principle it is, necessarily, Contemplation.
Taking the Reason-Principle, the Logos, in all its phases, the lowest
and last springs from a mental act \[in the higher Logos\] and is itself
a contemplation, though only in the sense of being contemplated, but
above it stands the total Logos with its two distinguishable phases,
first, that identified not as Nature but as All-Soul and, next, that
operating in Nature and being itself the Nature-Principle.

And does this Reason-Principle, Nature, spring from a contemplation?

Wholly and solely?

From self-contemplation, then? Or what are we to think? It derives from
a Contemplation and some contemplating Being; how are we to suppose it
to have Contemplation itself?

The Contemplation springing from the reasoning faculty- that, I mean, of
planning its own content, it does not possess.

But why not, since it is a phase of Life, a Reason-Principle and a
creative Power?

Because to plan for a thing is to lack it: Nature does not lack; it
creates because it possesses. Its creative act is simply its possession
of it own characteristic Essence; now its Essence, since it is a
Reason-Principle, is to be at once an act of contemplation and an object
of contemplation. In other words, the, Nature-Principle produces by
virtue of being an act of contemplation, an object of contemplation and
a Reason-Principle; on this triple character depends its creative
efficacy.

Thus the act of production is seen to be in Nature an act of
contemplation, for creation is the outcome of a contemplation which
never becomes anything else, which never does anything else, but creates
by simply being a contemplation.
