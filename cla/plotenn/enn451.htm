<P>2. If the Intellectual-Principle were the engendering 
Source, then
the engendered secondary, while less perfect than the
Intellectual-Principle, would be close to it and similar to it: but
since the engendering Source is above the Intellectual-Principle,
the secondary can only be that principle.

<P>But why is the Intellectual-Principle not the generating source?

<P>Because [it is not a self-sufficing simplex]: the Act of the
Intellectual-Principle is intellection, which means that, seeing the
intellectual object towards which it has turned, it is 
consummated, so
to speak, by that object, being in itself indeterminate like sight
[a vague readiness for any and every vision] and determined by the
intellectual object. This is why it has been said that "out of the
indeterminate dyad and The One arise the Ideas and the numbers": for
the dyad is the Intellectual-Principle.

<P>Thus it is not a simplex; it is manifold; it exhibits a certain
composite quality- within the Intellectual or divine order, 
of course-
as the principle that sees the manifold. It is, further, itself
simultaneously object and agent of intellection and is on that count
also a duality: and it possesses besides another object of
intellection in the Order following upon itself.

<P>But how can the Intellectual-Principle be a product of the
Intellectual Object?

<P>In this way: the intellectual object is self-gathered
[self-compact] and is not deficient as the seeing and knowing
principle must be- deficient, mean, as needing an object- it is
therefore no unconscious thing: all its content and accompaniment
are its possession; it is self-distinguishing throughout; it is the
seat of life as of all things; it is, itself, that self-intellection
which takes place in eternal repose, that is to say, in a mode other
than that of the Intellectual-Principle.

<P>But if something comes to being within an entity which in no way
looks outside itself- and especially within a being which is the sum
of being- that entity must be the source of the new thing: stable in
its own identity, it produces; but the product is that of an 
unchanged
being: the producer is unchangeably the intellectual object, the
product is produced as the Intellectual Act, an Act taking
intellection of its source- the only object that exists for 
it- and so
becoming Intellectual-Principle, that is to say, becoming another
intellectual being, resembling its source, a reproduction 
and image of
that.

<P>But how from amid perfect rest can an Act arise?

<P>There is in everything the Act of the Essence and the Act going
out from the Essence: the first Act is the thing itself in its
realized identity, the second Act is an inevitably following outgo
from the first, an emanation distinct from the thing itself.

<P>Thus even in fire there is the warmth comported by its essential
nature and there is the warmth going instantaneously outward 
from that
characterizing heat by the fact that the fire, remaining
unchangeably fire, utters the Act native to its essential reality.

<P>So it is in the divine also: or rather we have there the earlier
form of the double act: the divine remains in its own unchanging
being, but from its perfection and from the Act included in 
its nature
there emanates the secondary or issuing Act which- as the output of
a mighty power, the mightiest there is- attains to Real Being as
second to that which stands above all Being. That 
transcendent was the
potentiality of the All; this secondary is the All made actual.

<P>And if this is all things, that must be above and outside of
all, so, must transcend real being. And again, if that secondary is
all things, and if above its multiplicity there is a unity 
not ranking
among those things, once more this unity transcends Real Being and
therefore transcends the Intellectual-Principle as well. 
There is thus
something transcending Intellectual-Principle, for we must remember
that real being is no corpse, the negation of life and of
intellection, but is in fact identical with the
Intellectual-Principle. The Intellectual-Principle is not something
taking cognisance of things as sensation deals with sense objects
existing independently of sense: on the contrary, it actually is the
things it knows: the ideas constituting them it has not borrowed:
whence could it have taken them? No: it exists here together with
the things of the universe, identical with them, making a unity with
them; and the collective knowledge [in the divine mind] of the
immaterial is the universe of things.
