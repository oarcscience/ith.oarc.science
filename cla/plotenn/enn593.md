#### Section 4

4\. But how explain beings by the side of Being, and the variety of
intelligences and of souls, when Being has the unity of omnipresent
identity and not merely that of a species, and when intellect and soul
are likewise numerically one? We certainly distinguish between the soul
of the All and the particular souls.

This seems to conflict with our view which, moreover, for all its
logical necessity, scarcely carries conviction against our mental
reluctance to the notion of unity identically omnipresent. It would
appear more plausible to suppose a partition of the All-the original
remaining undiminished- or, in a more legitimate phrase, an engendering
from the All.

Thus the Authentic would be left self-gathered, while what we think of
as the parts- the separate souls- would come into being to produce the
multiple total of the universe.

But if the Authentic Being is to be kept unattached in order to remove
the difficulty of integral omnipresence, the same considerations must
apply equally to the souls; we would have to admit that they cannot be
integrally omnipresent in the bodies they are described as occupying;
either, soul must be distributed, part to body's part, or it is lodged
entire at some one point in the body giving forth some of its powers to
the other points; and these very powers, again, present the same
difficulty.

A further objection is that some one spot in the body will hold the
soul, the others no more than a power from it.

Still, how account for the many souls, many intelligences, the beings by
the side of the Being?

No doubt the beings proceed from the Priors in the mode only of
numerical distinction and not as concrete masses, but the difficulty
remains as to how they come to constitute the plenitude of the material
universe.

This explanation by progression does not clear the problem.

We are agreed that diversity within the Authentic depends not upon
spatial separation but sheerly upon differentiation; all Being, despite
this plurality, is a unity still; "Being neighbours Being"; all holds
together; and thus the Intellectual-Principle \[which is Being and the
Beings\] remains an integral, multiple by differentiation, not by
spatial distinction.

Soul too? Souls too. That principle distributed over material masses we
hold to be in its own nature incapable of distribution; the magnitude
belongs to the masses; when this soul-principle enters into them- or
rather they into it- it is thought of as distributable only because,
within the discrimination of the corporeal, the animating force is to be
recognised at any and every point. For soul is not articulated, section
of soul to section of body; there is integral omnipresence manifesting
the unity of that principle, its veritable partlessness.

Now as in soul unity does not debar variety, so with Being and the
Beings; in that order multiplicity does not conflict with unity.
Multiplicity. This is not due to the need of flooding the universe with
life; nor is the extension of the corporeal the cause of the
multiplicity of souls; before body existed, soul was one and many; the
many souls fore-existed in the All not potentially but each effectively;
that one collective soul is no bar to the variety; the variety does not
abrogate the unity; the souls are apart without partition, present each
to all as never having been set in opposition; they are no more hedged
off by boundaries than are the multiple items of knowledge in one mind;
the one soul so exists as to include all souls; the nature of such a
principle must be utterly free of boundary.
