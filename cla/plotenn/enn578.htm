<P>18. These problems at any rate all serve to show that, while in
general it is necessary to look for differences by which to separate
things from each other, to hunt for differences of the differences
themselves is both futile and irrational. We cannot have 
substances of
substances, quantities of quantities, qualities of qualities,
differences of differences; differences must, where 
possible, be found
outside the genus, in creative powers and the like: but where no
such criteria are present, as in distinguishing dark-green from
pale-green, both being regarded as derived from white and black,
what expedient may be suggested?

<P>Sense-perception and intelligence may be trusted to indicate
diversity but not to explain it: explanation is outside the province
of sense-perception, whose function is merely to produce a variety
of information; while, as for intelligence, it works exclusively
with intuitions and never resorts to explanations to justify them;
there is in the movements of intelligence a diversity which
separates one object from another, making further differentiation
unnecessary.

<P>Do all qualities constitute differentiae, or not? Granted that
whiteness and colours in general and the qualities dependent upon
touch and taste can, even while they remain species [of Quality],
become differentiae of other things, how can grammar and music
serve as differentiae? Perhaps in the sense that minds may be
distinguished as grammatical and musical, especially if the
qualities are innate, in which case they do become specific
differentiae.

<P>It remains to decide whether there can be any differentia derived
from the genus to which the differentiated thing belongs, or whether
it must of necessity belong to another genus? The former alternative
would produce differentiae of things derived from the same genus as
the differentiae themselves- for example, qualities of qualities.
Virtue and vice are two states differing in quality: the states are
qualities, and their differentiae qualities- unless indeed it be
maintained that the state undifferentiated is not a quality, that
the differentia creates the quality.

<P>But consider the sweet as beneficial, the bitter as injurious:
then bitter and sweet are distinguished, not by Quality, but by
Relation. We might also be disposed to identify the sweet with the
thick, and the Pungent with the thin: "thick" however hardly reveals
the essence but merely the cause of sweetness- an argument which
applies equally to pungency.

<P>We must therefore reflect whether it may be taken as an 
invariable
rule that Quality is never a differentia of Quality, any more than
Substance is a differentia of Substance, or Quantity of Quantity.

<P>Surely, it may be interposed, five differs from three by two.
No: it exceeds it by two; we do not say that it differs: how could
it differ by a "two" in the "three"? We may add that neither can
Motion differ from Motion by Motion. There is, in short, no parallel
in any of the other genera.

<P>In the case of virtue and vice, whole must be compared 
with whole,
and the differentiation conducted on this basis. As for the
differentia being derived from the same genus as themselves,
namely, Quality, and from no other genus, if we proceed on the
principle that virtue is bound up with pleasure, vice with lust,
virtue again with the acquisition of food, vice with idle
extravagance, and accept these definitions as satisfactory, then
clearly we have, here too, differentiae which are not qualities.
