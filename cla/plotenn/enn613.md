#### Section 7

7\. To Real Being we go back, all that we have and are; to that we
return as from that we came. Of what is There we have direct knowledge,
not images or even impressions; and to know without image is to be; by
our part in true knowledge we are those Beings; we do not need to bring
them down into ourselves, for we are There among them. Since not only
ourselves but all other things also are those Beings, we all are they;
we are they while we are also one with all: therefore we and all things
are one.

When we look outside of that on which we depend we ignore our unity;
looking outward we see many faces; look inward and all is the one head.
If man could but be turned about by his own motion or by the happy pull
of Athene- he would see at once God and himself and the All. At first no
doubt all will not be seen as one whole, but when we find no stop at
which to declare a limit to our being we cease to rule ourselves out
from the total of reality; we reach to the All as a unity- and this not
by any stepping forward, but by the fact of being and abiding there
where the All has its being.
