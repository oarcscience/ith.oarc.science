<P>3. We will have to examine this Nature, the Intellectual, which
our reasoning identifies as the authentically existent and the
veritable essential: but first we must take another path and make
certain that such a principle does necessarily exist.

<P>Perhaps it is ridiculous to set out enquiring whether an
Intellectual-Principle has place in the total of being: but there
may be some to hesitate even as to this and certainly there will be
the question whether it is as we describe it, whether it is 
a separate
existence, whether it actually is the real beings, whether it is the
seat of the Ideas; to this we now address ourselves.

<P>All that we see, and describe as having existence, we know to be
compound; hand-wrought or compacted by nature, nothing is 
simplex. Now
the hand-wrought, with its metal or stone or wood, is not 
realized out
of these materials until the appropriate craft has produced statue,
house or bed, by imparting the particular idea from its own content.
Similarly with natural forms of being; those including several
constituents, compound bodies as we call them, may be analysed into
the materials and the Idea imposed upon the total; the human being,
for example, into soul and body; and the human body into the four
elements. Finding everything to be a compound of Matter and shaping
principle- since the Matter of the elements is of itself shapeless-
you will enquire whence this forming idea comes; and you will ask
whether in the soul we recognise a simplex or whether this also has
constituents, something representing Matter and something else- the
Intellectual-Principle in it- representing Idea, the one 
corresponding
to the shape actually on the statue, the other to the artist giving
the shape.

<P>Applying the same method to the total of things, here too we
discover the Intellectual-Principle and this we set down as
veritably the maker and creator of the All. The underly has adopted,
we see, certain shapes by which it becomes fire, water, air, earth;
and these shapes have been imposed upon it by something else. This
other is Soul which, hovering over the Four [the elements], imparts
the pattern of the Kosmos, the Ideas for which it has itself
received from the Intellectual-Principle as the soul or mind of the
craftsman draws upon his craft for the plan of his work.

<P>The Intellectual-Principle is in one phase the Form of the soul,
its shape; in another phase it is the giver of the shape- the
sculptor, possessing inherently what is given- imparting to soul
nearly the authentic reality while what body receives is but 
image and
imitation.
