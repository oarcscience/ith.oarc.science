#### Section 19

19\. Are we to rest all on pursuit and on the soul? Is it enough to put
faith in the soul's choice and call that good which the soul pursues,
never asking ourselves the motive of its choice? We marshal
demonstration as to the nature of everything else; is the good to be
dismissed as choice?

Several absurdities would be entailed. The good becomes a mere attribute
of things; objects of pursuit are many and different so that mere choice
gives no assurance that the thing chosen is the best; in fact, we cannot
know the best until we know the good.

Are we to determine the good by the respective values of things?

This is to make Idea and Reason-Principle the test: all very well; but
arrived at these, what explanation have we to give as to why Idea and
Reason-Principle themselves are good? In the lower, we recognise
goodness- in its less perfect form- by comparison with what is poorer
still; we are without a standard There where no evil exists, the Bests
holding the field alone. Reason demands to know what constitutes
goodness; those principles are good in their own nature and we are left
in perplexity because cause and fact are identical: and even though we
should state a cause, the doubt still remains until our reason claims
its rights There. But we need not abandon the search; another path may
lead to the light.
