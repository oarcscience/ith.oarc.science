<P>6. Similarly, as it seems to me, the wise of Egypt- whether in
precise knowledge or by a prompting of nature- indicated the truth
where, in their effort towards philosophical statement, they left
aside the writing-forms that take in the detail of words and
sentences- those characters that represent sounds and convey the
propositions of reasoning- and drew pictures instead, 
engraving in the
temple- inscriptions a separate image for every separate item: thus
they exhibited the mode in which the Supreme goes forth.

<P>For each manifestation of knowledge and wisdom is a distinct
image, an object in itself, an immediate unity, not as aggregate of
discursive reasoning and detailed willing. Later from this wisdom in
unity there appears, in another form of being, an image, already
less compact, which announces the original in an outward stage and
seeks the causes by which things are such that the wonder rises how
a generated world can be so excellent.

<P>For, one who knows must declare his wonder that this 
Wisdom, while
not itself containing the causes by which Being exists and takes
such excellence, yet imparts them to the entities produced in
Being's realm. This excellence whose necessity is scarcely or not at
all manifest to search, exists, if we could but find it out, before
all searching and reasoning.

<P>What I say may be considered in one chief thing, and thence
applied to all the particular entities:
