<P>35. Such in this union is the soul's temper that even the act of
Intellect, once so intimately loved, she now dismisses; Intellection
is movement and she has no wish to move; she has nothing to say of
this very Intellectual-Principle by means of which she has attained
the vision, herself made over into Intellectual-Principle 
and becoming
that principle so as to be able to take stand in that Intellectual
space. Entered there and making herself over to that, she at first
contemplates that realm, but once she sees that higher still she
leaves all else aside. Thus when a man enters a house rich in beauty
he might gaze about and admire the varied splendour before the
master appears; but, face to face with that great person- no thing
of ornament but calling for the truest attention- he would ignore
everything else and look only to the master. In this state 
of absorbed
contemplation there is no longer question of holding an object: the
vision is continuous so that seeing and seen are one thing; 
object and
act of vision have become identical; of all that until then 
filled the
eye no memory remains. And our comparison would be closer if instead
of a man appearing to the visitor who had been admiring the house it
were a god, and not a god manifesting to the eyes but one filling
the soul.

<P>Intellectual-Principle, thus, has two powers, first that of
grasping intellectively its own content, the second that of an
advancing and receiving whereby to know its transcendent; at first
it sees, later by that seeing it takes possession of
Intellectual-Principle, becoming one only thing with that: the first
seeing is that of Intellect knowing, the second that of Intellect
loving; stripped of its wisdom in the intoxication of the nectar, it
comes to love; by this excess it is made simplex and is happy; and
to be drunken is better for it than to be too staid for these revels.

<P>But is its vision parcelwise, thing here and thing there?

<P>No: reason unravelling gives process; Intellectual-Principle has
unbroken knowledge and has, moreover, an Act unattended by knowing,
a vision by another approach. In this seeing of the Supreme 
it becomes
pregnant and at once knows what has come to be within it; its
knowledge of its content is what is designated by its Intellection;
its knowing of the Supreme is the virtue of that power within it by
which, in a later [lower] stage it is to become "Intellective."

<P>As for soul, it attains that vision by- so to speak- confounding
and annulling the Intellectual-Principle within it; or rather that
Principle immanent in soul sees first and thence the vision 
penetrates
to soul and the two visions become one.

<P>The Good spreading out above them and adapting itself to that
union which it hastens to confirm is present to them as giver of a
blessed sense and sight; so high it lifts them that they are 
no longer
in space or in that realm of difference where everything is 
root,ed in
some other thing; for The Good is not in place but is the 
container of
the Intellectual place; The Good is in nothing but itself.

<P>The soul now knows no movement since the Supreme knows 
none; it is
now not even soul since the Supreme is not in life but above life;
it is no longer Intellectual-Principle, for the Supreme has not
Intellection and the likeness must be perfect; this grasping is not
even by Intellection, for the Supreme is not known Intellectively.
