#### Section 1

1\. Pleasure and distress, fear and courage, desire and aversion, where
have these affections and experiences their seat?

Clearly, either in the Soul alone, or in the Soul as employing the body,
or in some third entity deriving from both. And for this third entity,
again, there are two possible modes: it might be either a blend or a
distinct form due to the blending.

And what applies to the affections applies also to whatsoever acts,
physical or mental, spring from them.

We have, therefore, to examine discursive-reason and the ordinary mental
action upon objects of sense, and enquire whether these have the one
seat with the affections and experiences, or perhaps sometimes the one
seat, sometimes another.

And we must consider also our acts of Intellection, their mode and their
seat.

And this very examining principle, which investigates and decides in
these matters, must be brought to light.

Firstly, what is the seat of Sense-Perception? This is the obvious
beginning since the affections and experiences either are sensations of
some kind or at least never occur apart from sensation.
