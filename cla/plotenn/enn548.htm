<P>11. We are bound however to enquire under what mode unity is
contained in Being. How is what is termed the "dividing" effected-
especially the dividing of the genera Being and unity? Is it the
same division, or is it different in the two cases?

<P>First then: In what sense, precisely, is any given particular
called and known to be a unity? Secondly: Does unity as used of
Being carry the same connotation as in reference to the Absolute?

<P>Unity is not identical in all things; it has a different
significance according as it is applied to the Sensible and the
Intellectual realms- Being too, of course, comports such a 
difference-
and there is a difference in the unity affirmed among sensible
things as compared with each other; the unity is not the same in the
cases of chorus, camp, ship, house; there is a difference again as
between such discrete things and the continuous. 
Nevertheless, all are
representations of the one exemplar, some quite remote, others more
effective: the truer likeness is in the Intellectual; Soul 
is a unity,
and still more is Intellect a unity and Being a unity.

<P>When we predicate Being of a particular, do we thereby predicate
of it unity, and does the degree of its unity tally with that of its
being? Such correspondence is accidental: unity is not proportionate
to Being; less unity need not mean less Being. An army or a choir
has no less Being than a house, though less unity.

<P>It would appear, then, that the unity of a particular is related
not so much to Being as to a standard of perfection: in so far as
the particular attains perfection, so far it is a unity; and the
degree of unity depends on this attainment. The particular 
aspires not
simply to Being, but to Being-in-perfection: it is in this strain
towards their perfection that such beings as do not possess unity
strive their utmost to achieve it.

<P>Things of nature tend by their very nature to coalesce with each
other and also to unify each within itself; their movement 
is not away
from but towards each other and inwards upon themselves. Souls,
moreover, seem to desire always to pass into a unity over and above
the unity of their own substance. Unity in fact confronts them on
two sides: their origin and their goal alike are unity; from unity
they have arisen, and towards unity they strive. Unity is thus
identical with Goodness [is the universal standard of 
perfection]; for
no being ever came into existence without possessing, from that very
moment, an irresistible tendency towards unity.

<P>From natural things we turn to the artificial. Every art in all
its operation aims at whatsoever unity its capacity and its models
permit, though Being most achieves unity since it is closer at the
start.

<P>That is why in speaking of other entities we assert the 
name only,
for example man; when we say "one man," we have in mind more 
than one;
and if we affirm unity of him in any other connection, we 
regard it as
supplementary [to his essence]: but when we speak of Being as a
whole we say it is one Being without presuming that it is 
anything but
a unity; we thereby show its close association with Goodness.

<P>Thus for Being, as for the others, unity turns out to be, in
some sense, Principle and Term, not however in the same sense as for
things of the physical order- a discrepancy leading us to infer that
even in unity there are degrees of priority.

<P>How, then, do we characterize the unity [thus diverse] in Being?
Are we to think of it as a common property seen alike in all its
parts? In the first place, the point is common to lines and 
yet is not
their genus, and this unity we are considering may also be common to
numbers and not be their genus- though, we need hardly say, the
unity of Unity-Absolute is not that of the numbers, one, two and the
rest. Secondly, in Being there is nothing to prevent the existence
of prior and posterior, simple and composite: but unity, 
even if it be
identical in all the manifestations of Being, having no
differentiae can produce no species; but producing no species it
cannot be a genus.
