#### Section 21

21\. How then does the universal Intellect produce the particulars
while, in virtue of its Reason-Principle, remaining a unity? In other
words, how do the various grades of Being, as we call them, arise from
the four primaries? Here is this great, this infinite Intellect, not
given to idle utterance but to sheer intellection, all-embracing,
integral, no part, no individual: how, we ask, can it possibly be the
source of all this plurality?

Number at all events it possesses in the objects of its contemplation:
it is thus one and many, and the many are powers, wonderful powers, not
weak but, being pure, supremely great and, so to speak, full to
overflowing powers in very truth, knowing no limit, so that they are
infinite, infinity, Magnitude-Absolute.

As we survey this Magnitude with the beauty of Being within it and the
glory and light around it, all contained in Intellect, we see,
simultaneously, Quality already in bloom, and along with the continuity
of its Act we catch a glimpse of Magnitude at Rest. Then, with one, two
and three in Intellect, Magnitude appears as of three dimensions, with
Quantity entire. Quantity thus given and Quality, both merging into one
and, we may almost say, becoming one, there is at once shape. Difference
slips in to divide both Quantity and Quality, and so we have variations
in shape and differences of Quality. Identity, coming in with
Difference, creates equality, Difference meanwhile introducing into
Quantity inequality, whether in number or in magnitude: thus are
produced circles and squares, and irregular figures, with number like
and unlike, odd and even.

The life of Intellect is intelligent, and its activity \[Act\] has no
failing-point: hence it excludes none of the constituents we have
discovered within it, each one of which we now see as an intellectual
function, and all of them possessed by virtue of its distinctive power
and in the mode appropriate to Intellect.

But though Intellect possesses them all by way of thought, this is not
discursive thought: nothing it lacks that is capable of serving as
Reason-Principle, while it may itself be regarded as one great and
perfect Reason-Principle, holding all the Principles as one and
proceeding from its own Primaries, or rather having eternally proceeded,
so that "proceeding" is never true of it. It is a universal rule that
whatever reasoning discovers to exist in Nature is to be found in
Intellect apart from all ratiocination: we conclude that Being has so
created Intellect that its reasoning is after a mode similar to that of
the Principles which produce living beings; for the Reason-Principles,
prior to reasoning though they are, act invariably in the manner which
the most careful reasoning would adopt in order to attain the best
results.

What conditions, then, are we to think of as existing in that realm
which is prior to Nature and transcends the Principles of Nature? In a
sphere in which Substance is not distinct from Intellect, and neither
Being nor Intellect is of alien origin, it is obvious that Being is best
served by the domination of Intellect, so that Being is what Intellect
wills and is: thus alone can it be authentic and primary Being; for if
Being is to be in any sense derived, its derivation must be from
Intellect.

Being, thus, exhibits every shape and every quality; it is not seen as a
thing determined by some one particular quality; there could not be one
only, since the principle of Difference is there; and since Identity is
equally there, it must be simultaneously one and many. And so Being is;
such it always was: unity-with-plurality appears in all its species, as
witness all the variations of magnitude, shape and quality. Clearly
nothing may legitimately be excluded \[from Being\], for the whole must
be complete in the higher sphere which, otherwise, would not be the
whole.

Life, too, burst upon Being, or rather was inseparably bound up with it;
and thus it was that all living things of necessity came to be. Body too
was there, since Matter and Quality were present.

Everything exists forever, unfailing, involved by very existence in
eternity. Individuals have their separate entities, but are at one in
the \[total\] unity. The complex, so to speak, of them all, thus
combined, is Intellect; and Intellect, holding all existence within
itself, is a complete living being, and the essential Idea of Living
Being. In so far as Intellect submits to contemplation by its
derivative, becoming an Intelligible, it gives that derivative the right
also to be called "living being."
