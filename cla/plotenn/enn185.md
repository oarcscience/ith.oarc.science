#### Section 10

10\. To sum the results of our argument: All things and events are
foreshown and brought into being by causes; but the causation is of two
Kinds; there are results originating from the Soul and results due to
other causes, those of the environment.

In the action of our Souls all that is done of their own motion in the
light of sound reason is the Soul's work, while what is done where they
are hindered from their own action is not so much done as suffered.
Unwisdom, then, is not due to the Soul, and, in general- if we mean by
Fate a compulsion outside ourselves- an act is fated when it is contrary
to wisdom.

But all our best is of our own doing: such is our nature as long as we
remain detached. The wise and good do perform acts; their right action
is the expression of their own power: in the others it comes in the
breathing spaces when the passions are in abeyance; but it is not that
they draw this occasional wisdom from outside themselves; simply, they
are for the time being unhindered.
