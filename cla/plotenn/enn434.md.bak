#### Section 3

3\. Sense sees a man and transmits the impression to the understanding.
What does the understanding say? It has nothing to say as yet; it
accepts and waits; unless, rather, it questions within itself "Who is
this?"- someone it has met before- and then, drawing on memory, says,
"Socrates."

If it should go on to develop the impression received, it distinguishes
various elements in what the representative faculty has set before it;
supposing it to say "Socrates, if the man is good," then, while it has
spoken upon information from the senses, its total pronouncement is its
own; it contains within itself a standard of good.

But how does it thus contain the good within itself?

It is, itself, of the nature of the good and it has been strengthened
still towards the perception of all that is good by the irradiation of
the Intellectual-Principle upon it; for this pure phase of the soul
welcomes to itself the images implanted from its prior.

But why may we not distinguish this understanding phase as
Intellectual-Principle and take soul to consist of the later phases from
the sensitive downwards?

Because all the activities mentioned are within the scope of a reasoning
faculty, and reasoning is characteristically the function of soul.

Why not, however, absolve the question by assigning self-cognisance to
this phase?

Because we have allotted to soul the function of dealing- in thought and
in multiform action- with the external, and we hold that observation of
self and of the content of self must belong to Intellectual-Principle.

If any one says, "Still; what precludes the reasoning soul from
observing its own content by some special faculty?" he is no longer
posting a principle of understanding or of reasoning but, simply,
bringing in the Intellectual-Principle unalloyed.

But what precludes the Intellectual-Principle from being present,
unalloyed, within the soul? Nothing, we admit; but are we entitled
therefore to think of it as a phase of soul?

We cannot describe it as belonging to the soul though we do describe it
as our Intellectual-Principle, something distinct from the
understanding, advanced above it, and yet ours even though we cannot
include it among soul-phases: it is ours and not ours; and therefore we
use it sometimes and sometimes not, whereas we always have use of the
understanding; the Intellectual-Principle is ours when we act by it, not
ours when we neglect it.

But what is this acting by it? Does it mean that we become the
Intellectual-Principle so that our utterance is the utterance of the
Intellectual-Principle, or that we represent it?

We are not the Intellectual-Principle; we represent it in virtue of that
highest reasoning faculty which draws upon it.

Still; we perceive by means of the perceptive faculty and are,
ourselves, the percipients: may we not say the same of the intellective
act?

No: our reasoning is our own; we ourselves think the thoughts that
occupy the understanding- for this is actually the We- but the operation
of the Intellectual-Principle enters from above us as that of the
sensitive faculty from below; the We is the soul at its highest, the
mid-point between two powers, between the sensitive principle, inferior
to us, and the intellectual principle superior. We think of the
perceptive act as integral to ourselves because our sense-perception is
uninterrupted; we hesitate as to the Intellectual-Principle both because
we are not always occupied with it and because it exists apart, not a
principle inclining to us but one to which we incline when we choose to
look upwards.

The sensitive principle is our scout; the Intellectual-Principle our
King.
