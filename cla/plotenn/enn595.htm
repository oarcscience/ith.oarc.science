<P>6. But why does not one same soul enter more than one body?

<P>Because any second body must approach, if it might; but the
first has approached and received and keeps.

<P>Are we to think that this second body, in keeping its soul with
a like care, is keeping the same soul as the first?

<P>Why not: what difference is there? Merely some additions 
[from the
experiences of life, none in the soul itself].

<P>We ask further why one soul in foot and hand and not one soul in
the distinct members of the universe.

<P>Sensations no doubt differ from soul to soul but only as do the
conditions and experiences; this is difference not in the judging
principle but in the matters coming to judgement; the judge 
is one and
the same soul pronouncing upon various events, and these not its own
but belonging to a particular body; it is only as a man pronounces
simultaneously upon a pleasant sensation in his finger and a pain in
his head.

<P>But why is not the soul in one man aware, then, of the judgement
passed by another?

<P>Because it is a judgement made, not a state set up; besides, the
soul that has passed the judgement does not pronounce but simply
judges: similarly a man's sight does not report to his 
hearing, though
both have passed judgement; it is the reason above both that
reports, and this is a principle distinct from either. Often, as it
happens, reason does become aware of a verdict formed in another
reason and takes to itself an alien experience: but this has been
dealt with elsewhere.
