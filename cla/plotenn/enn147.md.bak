#### Section 3

3\. The Whiteness, therefore, in a human being is, clearly, to be
classed not as a quality but as an activity- the act of a power which
can make white; and similarly what we think of as qualities in the
Intellectual Realm should be known as activities; they are activities
which to our minds take the appearance of quality from the fact that,
differing in character among themselves, each of them is a particularity
which, so to speak, distinguishes those Realities from each other.

What, then, distinguishes Quality in the Intellectual Realm from that
here, if both are Acts?

The difference is that these \["Quality-Activities"\] in the Supreme do
not indicate the very nature of the Reality \[as do the corresponding
Activities here\] nor do they indicate variations of substance or of
\[essential\] character; they merely indicate what we think of as
Quality but in the Intellectual Realm must still be Activity.

In other words this thing, considered in its aspect as possessing the
characteristic property of Reality is by that alone recognised as no
mere Quality. But when our reason separates what is distinctive in these
\["Quality-Activities"\]- not in the sense of abolishing them but rather
as taking them to itself and making something new of them- this new
something is Quality: reason has, so to speak, appropriated a portion of
Reality, that portion manifest to it on the surface.

By this analogy, warmth, as a concomitant of the specific nature of
fire, may very well be no quality in fire but an Idea-Form belonging to
it, one of its activities, while being merely a Quality in other things
than fire: as it is manifested in any warm object, it is not a mode of
Reality but merely a trace, a shadow, an image, something that has gone
forth from its own Reality- where it was an Act- and in the warm object
is a quality.

All, then, that is accident and not Act; all but what is Idea-form of
the Reality; all that merely confers pattern; all this is Quality:
qualities are characteristics and modes other than those constituting
the substratum of a thing.

But the Archetypes of all such qualities, the foundation in which they
exist primarily, these are Activities of the Intellectual Beings.

And; one and the same thing cannot be both Quality and non-quality: the
thing void of Real-Existence is Quality; but the thing accompanying
Reality is either Form or Activity: there is no longer self-identity
when, from having its being in itself, anything comes to be in something
else with a fall from its standing as Form and Activity.

Finally, anything which is never Form but always accidental to something
else is Quality unmixed and nothing more.
