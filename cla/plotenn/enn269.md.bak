#### Section 4

4\. And Nature, asked why it brings forth its works, might answer if it
cared to listen and to speak:

"It would have been more becoming to put no question but to learn in
silence just as I myself am silent and make no habit of talking. And
what is your lesson? This; that whatsoever comes into being is my is my
vision, seen in my silence, the vision that belongs to my character who,
sprung from vision, am vision-loving and create vision by the
vision-seeing faculty within me. The mathematicians from their vision
draw their figures: but I draw nothing: I gaze and the figures of the
material world take being as if they fell from my contemplation. As with
my Mother (the All-Soul\] and the Beings that begot me so it is with me:
they are born of a Contemplation and my birth is from them, not by their
Act but by their Being; they are the loftier Reason-Principles, they
contemplate themselves and I am born."

Now what does this tell us?

It tells: that what we know as Nature is a Soul, offspring of a yet
earlier Soul of more powerful life; that it possesses, therefore, in its
repose, a vision within itself; that it has no tendency upward nor even
downward but is at peace, steadfast, in its own Essence; that, in this
immutability accompanied by what may be called Self-Consciousness, it
possesses- within the measure of its possibility- a knowledge of the
realm of subsequent things perceived in virtue of that understanding and
consciousness; and, achieving thus a resplendent and delicious
spectacle, has no further aim.

Of course, while it may be convenient to speak of "understanding" or
"perception" in the Nature-Principle, this is not in the full sense
applicable to other beings; we are applying to sleep a word borrowed
from the wake.

For the Vision on which Nature broods, inactive, is a self-intuition, a
spectacle laid before it by virtue of its unaccompanied
self-concentration and by the fact that in itself it belongs to the
order of intuition. It is a Vision silent but somewhat blurred, for
there exists another a clearer of which Nature is the image: hence all
that Nature produces is weak; the weaker act of intuition produces the
weaker object.

In the same way, human beings, when weak on the side of contemplation,
find in action their trace of vision and of reason: their spiritual
feebleness unfits them for contemplation; they are left with a void,
because they cannot adequately seize the vision; yet they long for it;
they are hurried into action as their way to the vision which they
cannot attain by intellection. They act from the desire of seeing their
action, and of making it visible and sensible to others when the result
shall prove fairly well equal to the plan. Everywhere, doing and making
will be found to be either an attenuation or a complement of
vision-attenuation if the doer was aiming only at the thing done;
complement if he is to possess something nobler to gaze upon than the
mere work produced.

Given the power to contemplate the Authentic, who would run, of choice,
after its image?

The relation of action to contemplation is indicated in the way duller
children, inapt to study and speculation, take to crafts and manual
labour.
