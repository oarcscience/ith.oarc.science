#### Section 7

7\. A preliminary observation: in looking for excellence in this thing
of mixture, the Kosmos, we cannot require all that is implied in the
excellence of the unmingled; it is folly to ask for Firsts in the
Secondary, and since this Universe contains body, we must allow for some
bodily influence upon the total and be thankful if the mingled existent
lack nothing of what its nature allowed it to receive from the Divine
Reason.

Thus, supposing we were enquiring for the finest type of the human being
as known here, we would certainly not demand that he prove identical
with Man as in the Divine Intellect; we would think it enough in the
Creator to have so brought this thing of flesh and nerve and bone under
Reason as to give grace to these corporeal elements and to have made it
possible for Reason to have contact with Matter.

Our progress towards the object of our investigation must begin from
this principle of gradation which will open to us the wonder of the
Providence and of the power by which our universe holds its being.

We begin with evil acts entirely dependent upon the Souls which
perpetrate them- the harm, for example, which perverted Souls do to the
good and to each other. Unless the foreplanning power alone is to be
charged with the vice in such Souls, we have no ground of accusation, no
claim to redress: the blame lies on the Soul exercising its choice. Even
a Soul, we have seen, must have its individual movement; it is not
abstract Spirit; the first step towards animal life has been taken and
the conduct will naturally be in keeping with that character.

It is not because the world existed that Souls are here: before the
world was, they had it in them to be of the world, to concern themselves
with it, to presuppose it, to administer it: it was in their nature to
produce it- by whatever method, whether by giving forth some emanation
while they themselves remained above, or by an actual descent, or in
both ways together, some presiding from above, others descending; some
for we are not at the moment concerned about the mode of creation but
are simply urging that, however the world was produced, no blame falls
on Providence for what exists within it.

There remains the other phase of the question- the distribution of evil
to the opposite classes of men: the good go bare while the wicked are
rich: all that human need demands, the least deserving have in
abundance; it is they that rule; peoples and states are at their
disposal. Would not all this imply that the divine power does not reach
to earth?

That it does is sufficiently established by the fact that Reason rules
in the lower things: animals and plants have their share in Reason, Soul
and Life.

Perhaps, then, it reaches to earth but is not master over all?

We answer that the universe is one living organism: as well maintain
that while human head and face are the work of nature and of the ruling
reason-principle, the rest of the frame is due to other agencies-
accident or sheer necessity- and owes its inferiority to this origin, or
to the incompetence of unaided Nature. And even granting that those less
noble members are not in themselves admirable it would still be neither
pious nor even reverent to censure the entire structure.
