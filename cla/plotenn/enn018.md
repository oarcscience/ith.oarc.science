#### Section 1

1\. Since Evil is here, "haunting this world by necessary law," and it
is the Soul's design to escape from Evil, we must escape hence.

But what is this escape?

"In attaining Likeness to God," we read. And this is explained as
"becoming just and holy, living by wisdom," the entire nature grounded
in Virtue.

But does not Likeness by way of Virtue imply Likeness to some being that
has Virtue? To what Divine Being, then, would our Likeness be? To the
Being- must we not think?- in Which, above all, such excellence seems to
inhere, that is to the Soul of the Kosmos and to the Principle ruling
within it, the Principle endowed with a wisdom most wonderful. What
could be more fitting than that we, living in this world, should become
Like to its ruler?

But, at the beginning, we are met by the doubt whether even in this
Divine-Being all the virtues find place- Moral-Balance \[Sophrosyne\],
for example; or Fortitude where there can be no danger since nothing is
alien; where there can be nothing alluring whose lack could induce the
desire of possession.

If, indeed, that aspiration towards the Intelligible which is in our
nature exists also in this Ruling-Power, then need not look elsewhere
for the source of order and of the virtues in ourselves.

But does this Power possess the Virtues?

We cannot expect to find There what are called the Civic Virtues, the
Prudence which belongs to the reasoning faculty; the Fortitude which
conducts the emotional and passionate nature; the Sophrosyne which
consists in a certain pact, in a concord between the passionate faculty
and the reason; or Rectitude which is the due application of all the
other virtues as each in turn should command or obey.

Is Likeness, then, attained, perhaps, not by these virtues of the social
order but by those greater qualities known by the same general name? And
if so do the Civic Virtues give us no help at all?

It is against reason, utterly to deny Likeness by these while admitting
it by the greater: tradition at least recognizes certain men of the
civic excellence as divine, and we must believe that these too had in
some sort attained Likeness: on both levels there is virtue for us,
though not the same virtue.

Now, if it be admitted that Likeness is possible, though by a varying
use of different virtues and though the civic virtues do not suffice,
there is no reason why we should not, by virtues peculiar to our state,
attain Likeness to a model in which virtue has no place.

But is that conceivable?

When warmth comes in to make anything warm, must there needs be
something to warm the source of the warmth?

If a fire is to warm something else, must there be a fire to warm that
fire?

Against the first illustration it may be retorted that the source of the
warmth does already contain warmth, not by an infusion but as an
essential phase of its nature, so that, if the analogy is to hold, the
argument would make Virtue something communicated to the Soul but an
essential constituent of the Principle from which the Soul attaining
Likeness absorbs it.

Against the illustration drawn from the fire, it may be urged that the
analogy would make that Principle identical with virtue, whereas we hold
it to be something higher.

The objection would be valid if what the soul takes in were one and the
same with the source, but in fact virtue is one thing, the source of
virtue quite another. The material house is not identical with the house
conceived in the intellect, and yet stands in its likeness: the material
house has distribution and order while the pure idea is not constituted
by any such elements; distribution, order, symmetry are not parts of an
idea.

So with us: it is from the Supreme that we derive order and distribution
and harmony, which are virtues in this sphere: the Existences There,
having no need of harmony, order or distribution, have nothing to do
with virtue; and, none the less, it is by our possession of virtue that
we become like to Them.

Thus much to show that the principle that we attain Likeness by virtue
in no way involves the existence of virtue in the Supreme. But we have
not merely to make a formal demonstration: we must persuade as well as
demonstrate.
