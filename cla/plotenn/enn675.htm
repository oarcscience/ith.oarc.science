<P>37. Those ascribing Intellection to the First have not supposed
him to know the lesser, the emanant- though, indeed, some 
have thought
it impossible that he should not know everything. But those denying
his knowing of the lesser have still attributed self-knowing to him,
because they find nothing nobler; we are to suppose that so he is
the more august, as if Intellection were something nobler than his
own manner of being not something whose value derives from him.

<P>But we ask in what must his grandeur lie, in his Intellection or
in himself. If in the Intellection, he has no worth or the 
less worth;
if in himself, he is perfect before the Intellection, not 
perfected by
it. We may be told that he must have Intellection because he is an
Act, not a potentiality. Now if this means that he is an essence
eternally intellective, he is represented as a duality- essence and
Intellective Act- he ceases to be a simplex; an external has been
added: it is just as the eyes are not the same as their sight,
though the two are inseparable. If on the other hand by this
actualization it is meant that he is Act and Intellection, then as
being Intellection he does not exercise it, just as movement is not
itself in motion.

<P>But do not we ourselves assert that the Beings There are essence
and Act?

<P>The Beings, yes, but they are to us manifold and differentiated:
the First we make a simplex; to us Intellection begins with the
emanant in its seeking of its essence, of itself, of its author;
bent inward for this vision and having a present thing to know,
there is every reason why it should be a principle of Intellection;
but that which, never coming into being, has no prior but is 
ever what
it is, how could that have motive to Intellection? As Plato rightly
says, it is above Intellect.

<P>An Intelligence not exercising Intellection would be
unintelligent; where the nature demands knowing, not to know is to
fail of intelligence; but where there is no function, why import one
and declare a defect because it is not performed? We might as well
complain because the Supreme does not act as a physician. He has no
task, we hold, because nothing can present itself to him to be done;
he is sufficient; he need seek nothing beyond himself, he who is
over all; to himself and to all he suffices by simply being what he
is.
