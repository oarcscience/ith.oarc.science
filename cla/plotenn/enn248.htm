<P>17. Nor can we, on the other hand, think that matter is simply
Absolute Magnitude.

<P>Magnitude is not, like Matter, a receptacle; it is an
Ideal-Principle: it is a thing standing apart to itself, not some
definite Mass. The fact is that the self-gathered content of the
Intellectual Principle or of the All-Soul, desires expansion [and
thereby engenders secondaries]: in its images- aspiring and moving
towards it and eagerly imitating its act- is vested a 
similar power of
reproducing their states in their own derivatives. The Magnitude
latent in the expansive tendency of the Image-making phase [of
Intellect or All-Soul] runs forth into the Absolute Magnitude of the
Universe; this in turn enlists into the process the spurious 
magnitude
of Matter: the content of the Supreme, thus, in virtue of its own
prior extension enables Matter- which never possesses a content- to
exhibit the appearance of Magnitude. It must be understood that
spurious Magnitude consists in the fact that a thing [Matter] not
possessing actual Magnitude strains towards it and has the extension
of that straining. All that is Real Being gives forth a reflection
of itself upon all else; every Reality, therefore, has 
Magnitude which
by this process is communicated to the Universe.

<P>The Magnitude inherent in each Ideal-Principle- that of 
a horse or
of anything else- combines with Magnitude the Absolute with 
the result
that, irradiated by that Absolute, Matter entire takes Magnitude and
every particle of it becomes a mass; in this way, by virtue 
at once of
the totality of Idea with its inherent magnitude and of each several
specific Idea, all things appear under mass; Matter takes on what we
conceive as extension; it is compelled to assume a relation 
to the All
and, gathered under this Idea and under Mass, to be all 
things- in the
degree in which the operating power can lead the really nothing to
become all.

<P>By the conditions of Manifestation, colour rises from non-colour
[= from the colourless prototype of colour in the Ideal Realm].
Quality, known by the one name with its parallel in the sphere of
Primals, rises, similarly, from non-quality: in precisely the same
mode, the Magnitude appearing upon Matter rises from non-Magnitude
or from that Primal which is known to us by the same name; so that
material things become visible through standing midway between bare
underlie and Pure Idea. All is perceptible by virtue of this 
origin in
the Intellectual Sphere but all is falsity since the base in 
which the
manifestation takes place is a non-existent.

<P>Particular entities thus attain their Magnitude through being
drawn out by the power of the Existents which mirror themselves and
make space for themselves in them. And no violence is 
required to draw
them into all the diversity of Shapes and Kinds because the 
phenomenal
All exists by Matter [by Matter's essential all-receptivity] and
because each several Idea, moreover, draws Matter its own way by the
power stored within itself, the power it holds from the Intellectual
Realm. Matter is manifested in this sphere as Mass by the 
fact that it
mirrors the Absolute Magnitude; Magnitude here is the reflection in
the mirror. The Ideas meet all of necessity in Matter [the 
Ultimate of
the emanatory progress]: and Matter, both as one total thing and in
its entire scope, must submit itself, since it is the Material of
the entire Here, not of any one determined thing: what is, in its
own character, no determined thing may become determined by 
an outside
force- though, in becoming thus determined, it does not become the
definite thing in question, for thus it would lose its own
characteristic indetermination.
