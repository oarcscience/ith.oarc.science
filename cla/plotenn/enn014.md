#### Section 11

11\. In childhood the main activity is in the Couplement and there is
but little irradiation from the higher principles of our being: but when
these higher principles act but feebly or rarely upon us their action is
directed towards the Supreme; they work upon us only when they stand at
the mid-point.

But does not the include that phase of our being which stands above the
mid-point?

It does, but on condition that we lay hold of it: our entire nature is
not ours at all times but only as we direct the mid-point upwards or
downwards, or lead some particular phase of our nature from potentiality
or native character into act.

And the animals, in what way or degree do they possess the Animate?

If there be in them, as the opinion goes, human Souls that have sinned,
then the Animating-Principle in its separable phase does not enter
directly into the brute; it is there but not there to them; they are
aware only of the image of the Soul \[only of the lower Soul\] and of
that only by being aware of the body organised and determined by that
image.

If there be no human Soul in them, the Animate is constituted for them
by a radiation from the All-Soul.
