#### Section 8

8\. But it is not, in our view, as an attribute that this freedom is
present in the First. In the light of free acts, from which we eliminate
the contraries, we recognise There self-determination, self-directed
and, failing more suitable terms, we apply to it the lesser terms
brought over from lesser things and so tell it as best we may: no words
could ever be adequate or even applicable to that from which all else-
the noble, the august- is derived. For This is principle of all, or,
more strictly, unrelated to all and, in this consideration, cannot be
made to possess such laters as even freedom and self-disposal, which in
fact indicate manifestation upon the extern- unhindered but implying the
existence of other beings whose opposition proves ineffective.

We cannot think of the First as moving towards any other; He holds his
own manner of being before any other was; even Being we withhold and
therefore all relation to beings.

Nor may we speak of any "conforming to the nature"; this again is of the
later; if the term be applicable at all in that realm it applies only to
the secondaries- primally to Essential Existence as next to this First.
And if a "nature" belongs only to things of time, this conformity to
nature does not apply even to Essential Existence. On the other hand, we
are not to deny that it is derived from Essential Existence for that
would be to take away its existence and would imply derivation from
something else.

Does this mean that the First is to be described as happening to be?

No; that would be just as false; nothing "happens" to the First; it
stands in no such relationship; happening belongs only to the multiple
where, first, existence is given and then something is added. And how
could the Source "happen to be"? There has been no coming so that you
can put it to the question "How does this come to be? What chance
brought it here, gave it being?" Chance did not yet exist; there was no
"automatic action": these imply something before themselves and occur in
the realm of process.
