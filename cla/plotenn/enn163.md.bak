#### Section 8

8\. To ask why the Soul has created the Kosmos, is to ask why there is a
Soul and why a Creator creates. The question, also, implies a beginning
in the eternal and, further, represents creation as the act of a
changeful Being who turns from this to that.

Those that so think must be instructed- if they would but bear with
correction- in the nature of the Supernals, and brought to desist from
that blasphemy of majestic powers which comes so easily to them, where
all should be reverent scruple.

Even in the administration of the Universe there is no ground for such
attack, for it affords manifest proof of the greatness of the
Intellectual Kind.

This All that has emerged into life is no amorphous structure- like
those lesser forms within it which are born night and day out of the
lavishness of its vitality- the Universe is a life organized, effective,
complex, all-comprehensive, displaying an unfathomable wisdom. How,
then, can anyone deny that it is a clear image, beautifully formed, of
the Intellectual Divinities? No doubt it is copy, not original; but that
is its very nature; it cannot be at once symbol and reality. But to say
that it is an inadequate copy is false; nothing has been left out which
a beautiful representation within the physical order could include.

Such a reproduction there must necessarily be- though not by
deliberation and contrivance- for the Intellectual could not be the last
of things, but must have a double Act, one within itself and one
outgoing; there must, then, be something later than the Divine; for only
the thing with which all power ends fails to pass downwards something of
itself. In the Supreme there flourishes a marvellous vigour, and
therefore it produces.

Since there is no Universe nobler than this, is it not clear what this
must be? A representation carrying down the features of the Intellectual
Realm is necessary; there is no other Kosmos than this; therefore this
is such a representation.

This earth of ours is full of varied life-forms and of immortal beings;
to the very heavens it is crowded. And the stars, those of the upper and
the under spheres, moving in their ordered path, fellow-travellers with
the universe, how can they be less than gods? Surely they must be
morally good: what could prevent them? All that occasions vice here
below is unknown there evil of body, perturbed and perturbing.

Knowledge, too; in their unbroken peace, what hinders them from the
intellectual grasp of the God-Head and the Intellectual Gods? What can
be imagined to give us a wisdom higher than belongs to the Supernals?
Could anyone, not fallen to utter folly, bear with such an idea?

Admitting that human Souls have descended under constraint of the
All-Soul, are we to think the constrained the nobler? Among Souls, what
commands must be higher than what obeys. And if the coming was
unconstrained, why find fault with a world you have chosen and can quit
if you dislike it?

And further, if the order of this Universe is such that we are able,
within it, to practise wisdom and to live our earthly course by the
Supernal, does not that prove it a dependency of the Divine?
