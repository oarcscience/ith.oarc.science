<P>14. Why is Quality, again, not included among the Primaries?
Because like Quantity it is a posterior, subsequent to Substance.
Primary Substance must necessarily contain Quantity and 
Quality as its
consequents; it cannot owe its subsistence to them, or require them
for its completion: that would make it posterior to Quality and
Quantity.

<P>Now in the case of composite substances- those constituted from
diverse elements- number and qualities provide a means of
differentiation: the qualities may be detached from the common core
around which they are found to group themselves. But in the primary
genera there is no distinction to be drawn between simples and
composites; the difference is between simples and those 
entities which
complete not a particular substance but Substance as such. A
particular substance may very well receive completion from Quality,
for though it already has Substance before the accession of Quality,
its particular character is external to Substance. But in Substance
itself all the elements are substantial.

<P>Nevertheless, we ventured to assert elsewhere that while the
complements of Substance are only by analogy called qualities, yet
accessions of external origin and subsequent to Substance are really
qualities; that, further, the properties which inhere in substances
are their activities [Acts], while those which are subsequent are
merely modifications [or Passions]: we now affirm that the
attributes of the particular substance are never complementary to
Substance [as such]; an accession of Substance does not come to the
substance of man qua man; he is, on the contrary, Substance in a
higher degree before he arrives at differentiation, just as he is
already "living being" before he passes into the rational species.
