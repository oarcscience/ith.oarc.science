#### Section 10

10\. Time, again, has been described as some sort of a sequence upon
Movement, but we learn nothing from this, nothing is said, until we know
what it is that produces this sequential thing: probably the cause and
not the result would turn out to be Time.

And, admitting such a thing, there would still remain the question
whether it came into being before the movement, with it, or after it;
and, whether we say before or with or after, we are speaking of order in
Time: and thus our definition is "Time is a sequence upon movement in
Time!"

Enough: Our main purpose is to show what Time is, not to refute false
definition. To traverse point by point the many opinions of our many
predecessors would mean a history rather than an identification; we have
treated the various theories as fully as is possible in a cursory
review: and, notice, that which makes Time the Measure of the
All-Movement is refuted by our entire discussion and, especially, by the
observations upon the Measurement of Movement in general, for all the
argument- except, of course, that from irregularity- applies to the All
as much as to particular Movement.

We are, thus, at the stage where we are to state what Time really is.
