#### Section 11

11\. Since there is a Soul which reasons upon the right and good- for
reasoning is an enquiry into the rightness and goodness of this rather
than that- there must exist some permanent Right, the source and
foundation of this reasoning in our soul; how, else, could any such
discussion be held? Further, since the soul's attention to these matters
is intermittent, there must be within us an Intellectual-Principle
acquainted with that Right not by momentary act but in permanent
possession. Similarly there must be also the principle of this
principle, its cause, God. This Highest cannot be divided and allotted,
must remain intangible but not bound to space, it may be present at many
points, wheresoever there is anything capable of accepting one of its
manifestations; thus a centre is an independent unity; everything within
the circle has its term at the centre; and to the centre the radii bring
each their own. Within our nature is such a centre by which we grasp and
are linked and held; and those of us are firmly in the Supreme whose
collective tendency is There.
