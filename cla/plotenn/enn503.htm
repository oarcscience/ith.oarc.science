<P>12. It should however be added that if the Idea of man exists in
the Supreme, there must exist the Idea of reasoning man and of man
with his arts and crafts; such arts as are the offspring of
intellect Must be There.

<P>It must be observed that the Ideas will be of universals; not of
Socrates but of Man: though as to man we may enquire whether the
individual may not also have place There. Under the heading of
individuality there is to be considered the repetition of the same
feature from man to man, the simian type, for example, and the
aquiline: the aquiline and the simian must be taken to be
differences in the Idea of Man as there are different types of the
animal: but Matter also has its effect in bringing about the 
degree of
aquilinity. Similarly with difference of complexion, 
determined partly
by the Reason-Principle, partly by Matter and by diversity of place.
