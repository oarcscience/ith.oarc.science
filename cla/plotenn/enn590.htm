<P>1. How are we to explain the omnipresence of the soul? Does it
depend upon the definite magnitude of the material universe coupled
with some native tendency in soul to distribute itself over material
mass, or is it a characteristic of soul apart from body?

<P>In the latter case, soul will not appear just where body 
may bring
it; body will meet soul awaiting it everywhere; wheresoever 
body finds
place, there soul lay before ever body was; the entire material mass
of the universe has been set into an existent soul.

<P>But if soul spread thus wide before material extension existed,
then as covering all space it would seem to be of itself a thing of
magnitude, and in what mode could it exist in the All before the All
was in being, before there was any All? And who can accept a soul
described as partless and massless and yet, for all that absence of
extension, extending over a universe? We may perhaps be told that,
though extended over the corporeal, it does not itself become so:
but thus to give it magnitude as an accidental attribute leaves the
problem still unsolved: precisely the same question must in 
all reason
arise: How can the soul take magnitude even in the move of accident?

<P>We cannot think of soul being diffused as a quality is, say
sweetness or colour, for while these are actual states of the masses
affected so that they show that quality at every point, none of them
has an independent existence; they are attributes of body and known
only as in body; such quality is necessarily of a definite
extension. Further, the colour at any point is independent of that
at any other; no doubt the Form, White, is the same all over, but
there is not arithmetical identity; in soul there is; it is one soul
in foot and in hand, as the facts of perception show. And yet in the
case of qualities the one is observably distributed part for part;
in the soul the identity is undistributed; what we sometimes call
distribution is simply omnipresence.

<P>Obviously, we must take hold of the question from the very
beginning in the hope of finding some clear and convincing theory as
to how soul, immaterial and without magnitude, can be thus
broad-spread, whether before material masses exist or as enveloping
them. Of course, should it appear that this omnipresence may occur
apart from material things, there is no difficulty in accepting its
occurrence within the material.
