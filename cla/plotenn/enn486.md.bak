#### Section 9

9\. Let us, then, make a mental picture of our universe: each member
shall remain what it is, distinctly apart; yet all is to form, as far as
possible, a complete unity so that whatever comes into view shall show
as if it were the surface of the orb over all, bringing immediately with
it the vision, on the one plane, of the sun and of all the stars with
earth and sea and all living things as if exhibited upon a transparent
globe.

Bring this vision actually before your sight, so that there shall be in
your mind the gleaming representation of a sphere, a picture holding
sprung, themselves, of that universe and repose or some at rest, some in
motion. Keep this sphere before you, and from it imagine another, a
sphere stripped of magnitude and of spatial differences; cast out your
inborn sense of Matter, taking care not merely to attenuate it: call on
God, maker of the sphere whose image you now hold, and pray Him to
enter. And may He come bringing His own Universe with all the Gods that
dwell in it- He who is the one God and all the gods, where each is all,
blending into a unity, distinct in powers but all one god in virtue of
that one divine power of many facets.

More truly, this is the one God who is all the gods; for, in the coming
to be of all those, this, the one, has suffered no diminishing. He and
all have one existence while each again is distinct. It is distinction
by state without interval: there is no outward form to set one here and
another there and to prevent any from being an entire identity; yet
there is no sharing of parts from one to another. Nor is each of those
divine wholes a power in fragment, a power totalling to the sum of the
measurable segments: the divine is one all-power, reaching out to
infinity, powerful to infinity; and so great is God that his very
members are infinites. What place can be named to which He does not
reach?

Great, too, is this firmament of ours and all the powers constellated
within it, but it would be greater still, unspeakably, but that there is
inbound in it something of the petty power of body; no doubt the powers
of fire and other bodily substances might themselves be thought very
great, but in fact, it is through their failure in the true power that
we see them burning, destroying, wearing things away, and slaving
towards the production of life; they destroy because they are themselves
in process of destruction, and they produce because they belong to the
realm of the produced.

The power in that other world has merely Being and Beauty of Being.
Beauty without Being could not be, nor Being voided of Beauty: abandoned
of Beauty, Being loses something of its essence. Being is desirable
because it is identical with Beauty; and Beauty is loved because it is
Being. How then can we debate which is the cause of the other, where the
nature is one? The very figment of Being needs some imposed image of
Beauty to make it passable and even to ensure its existence; it exists
to the degree in which it has taken some share in the beauty of Idea;
and the more deeply it has drawn on this, the less imperfect it is,
precisely because the nature which is essentially the beautiful has
entered into it the more intimately.
