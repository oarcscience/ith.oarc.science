#### Section 3

3\. But it leaves that conjunction; it cannot suffer that unity; it
falls in love with its own powers and possessions, and desires to stand
apart; it leans outward so to speak: then, it appears to acquire a
memory of itself.

In this self-memory a distinction is to be made; the memory dealing with
the Intellectual Realm upbears the soul, not to fall; the memory of
things here bears it downwards to this universe; the intermediate memory
dealing with the heavenly sphere holds it there too; and, in all its
memory, the thing it has in mind it is and grows to; for this
bearing-in-mind must be either intuition \[i.e., knowledge with
identity\] or representation by image: and the imaging in the case of
the is not a taking in of something but is vision and condition- so much
so, that, in its very sense- sight, it is the lower in the degree in
which it penetrates the object. Since its possession of the total of
things is not primal but secondary, it does not become all things
perfectly \[in becoming identical with the All in the Intellectual\]; it
is of the boundary order, situated between two regions, and has tendency
to both.
