<P>2. In asserting that Being is not a unity, we do not 
mean to imply
a definite number of existences; the number may well be infinite: we
mean simply that it is many as well as one, that it is, so 
to speak, a
diversified unity, a plurality in unity.

<P>It follows that either the unity so regarded is a unity of genus
under which the Existents, involving as they do plurality as well as
unity, stand as species; or that while there are more genera 
than one,
yet all are subordinate to a unity; or there may be more genera than
one, though no one genus is subordinate to any other, but all with
their own subordinates- whether these be lesser genera, or species
with individuals for their subordinates- all are elements in one
entity, and from their totality the Intellectual realm- that which
we know as Being- derives its constitution.

<P>If this last is the truth, we have here not merely genera, but
genera which are at the same time principles of Being. They 
are genera
because they have subordinates- other genera, and 
successively species
and individuals; they are also principles, since from this plurality
Being takes its rise, constituted in its entirety from these its
elements.

<P>Suppose, however, a greater number of origins which by their
mere totality comprised, without possessing any subordinates, the
whole of Being; these would be first-principles but not genera: it
would be as if one constructed the sensible world from the four
elements- fire and the others; these elements would be first
principles, but they would not be genera, unless the term "genus" is
to be used equivocally.

<P>But does this assertion of certain genera which are at the same
time first-principles imply that by combining the genera, each with
its subordinates, we find the whole of Being in the resultant
combination? But then, taken separately, their existence will not be
actual but only potential, and they will not be found in isolation.

<P>Suppose, on the other hand, we ignore the genera and combine the
particulars: what then becomes of the ignored genera? They will,
surely, exist in the purity of their own isolation, and the mixtures
will not destroy them. The question of how this result is 
achieved may
be postponed.

<P>For the moment we take it as agreed that there are genera as
distinct from principles of Being and that, on another plane,
principles [elements] are opposed to compounds. We are thus 
obliged to
show in what relation we speak of genera and why we distinguish them
instead of summing them under a unity; for otherwise we imply that
their coalescence into a unity is fortuitous, whereas it 
would be more
plausible to dispense with their separate existence.

<P>If all the genera could be species of Being, all individuals
without exception being immediately subordinate to these 
species, then
such a unification becomes feasible. But that supposition bespeaks
annihilation for the genera: the species will no longer be species;
plurality will no longer be subordinated to unity; everything must
be the unity, unless there exist some thing or things outside the
unity. The One never becomes many- as the existence of species
demands- unless there is something distinct from it: it cannot of
itself assume plurality, unless we are to think of it as being
broken into pieces like some extended body: but even so, the force
which breaks it up must be distinct from it: if it is itself 
to effect
the breaking up- or whatever form the division may take- then it is
itself previously divided.

<P>For these and many other reasons we must abstain from positing a
single genus, and especially because neither Being nor Substance can
be the predicate of any given thing. If we do predicate Being, it is
only as an accidental attribute; just as when we predicate whiteness
of a substance, we are not predicating the Absolute Whiteness.
