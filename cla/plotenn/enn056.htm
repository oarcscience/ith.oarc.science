<P>7. But if we are to consider only the present and may not call
in the past to make the total, why do we not reckon so in the case
of time itself, where, in fact, we do not hesitate to add the past
to the present and call the total greater? Why not suppose a
quantity of happiness equivalent to a quantity of time? This would
be no more than taking it lap by lap to correspond with time-laps
instead of choosing to consider it as an indivisible, measurable
only by the content of a given instant.

<P>There is no absurdity in taking count of time which has ceased
to be: we are merely counting what is past and finished, as we might
count the dead: but to treat past happiness as actually existent and
as outweighing present happiness, that is an absurdity. For
Happiness must be an achieved and existent state, whereas any time
over and apart from the present is nonexistent: all progress of time
means the extinction of all the time that has been.

<P>Hence time is aptly described as a mimic of eternity 
that seeks to
break up in its fragmentary flight the permanence of its exemplar.
Thus whatever time seizes and seals to itself of what stands 
permanent
in eternity is annihilated- saved only in so far as in some degree
it still belongs to eternity, but wholly destroyed if it be
unreservedly absorbed into time.

<P>If Happiness demands the possession of the good of life, it
clearly has to do with the life of Authentic-Existence for that life
is the Best. Now the life of Authentic-Existence is measurable not
by time but by eternity; and eternity is not a more or a less or a
thing of any magnitude but is the unchangeable, the indivisible, is
timeless Being.

<P>We must not muddle together Being and Non-Being, time and
eternity, not even everlasting time with the eternal; we cannot make
laps and stages of an absolute unity; all must be taken together,
wheresoever and howsoever we handle it; and it must be taken at
that, not even as an undivided block of time but as the Life of
Eternity, a stretch not made up of periods but completely rounded,
outside of all notion of time.
