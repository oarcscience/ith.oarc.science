<P>5. As a manifold, then, this God, the Intellectual-Principle,
exists within the Soul here, the Soul which once for all 
stands linked
a member of the divine, unless by a deliberate apostasy.

<P>Bringing itself close to the divine Intellect, becoming, as it
were, one with this, it seeks still further: What Being, now, has
engendered this God, what is the Simplex preceding this 
multiple; what
the cause at once of its existence and of its existing as a
manifold; what the source of this Number, this Quantity?

<P>Number, Quantity, is not primal: obviously before even duality,
there must stand the unity.

<P>The Dyad is a secondary; deriving from unity, it finds in unity
the determinant needed by its native indetermination: once there is
any determination, there is Number, in the sense, of course, of the
real [the archetypal] Number. And the soul is such a number or
quantity. For the Primals are not masses or magnitudes; all of that
gross order is later, real only to the sense-thought; even 
in seed the
effective reality is not the moist substance but the unseen- that is
to say Number [as the determinant of individual being] and the
Reason-Principle [of the product to be].

<P>Thus by what we call the Number and the Dyad of that 
higher realm,
we mean Reason Principles and the Intellectual-Principle: but while
the Dyad is, as regards that sphere, undetermined- 
representing, as it
were, the underly [or Matter] of The One- the later Number [or
Quantity]- that which rises from the Dyad 
[Intellectual-Principle] and
The One- is not Matter to the later existents but is their
forming-Idea, for all of them take shape, so to speak, from the
ideas rising within this. The determination of the Dyad is brought
about partly from its object- The One- and partly from itself, as is
the case with all vision in the act of sight: intellection 
[the Act of
the Dyad] is vision occupied upon The One.
