#### Section 18

18\. To pass to the consideration of beauty:

If by beauty we mean the primary Beauty, the same or similar arguments
will apply here as to goodness: and if the beauty in the Ideal-Form is,
as it were, an effulgence \[from that primary Beauty\], we may observe
that it is not identical in all participants and that an effulgence is
necessarily a posterior.

If we mean the beauty which identifies itself with Substance, this has
been covered in our treatment of Substance.

If, again, we mean beauty in relation to ourselves as spectators in whom
it produces a certain experience, this Act \[of production\] is Motion-
and none the less Motion by being directed towards Absolute Beauty.

Knowledge again, is Motion originating in the self; it is the
observation of Being- an Act, not a State: hence it too falls under
Motion, or perhaps more suitably under Stability, or even under both; if
under both, knowledge must be thought of as a complex, and if a complex,
is posterior.

Intelligence, since it connotes intelligent Being and comprises the
total of existence, cannot be one of the genera: the true Intelligence
\[or Intellect\] is Being taken with all its concomitants \[with the
other four genera\]; it is actually the sum of all the Existents: Being
on the contrary, stripped of its concomitants, may be counted as a genus
and held to an element in Intelligence.

Justice and self-control \[sophrosyne\], and virtue in general- these
are all various Acts of Intelligence: they are consequently not primary
genera; they are posterior to a genus, that is to say, they are species.
