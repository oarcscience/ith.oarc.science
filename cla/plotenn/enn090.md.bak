#### Section 1

1\. We hold that the ordered universe, in its material mass, has existed
for ever and will for ever endure: but simply to refer this perdurance
to the Will of God, however true an explanation, is utterly inadequate.

The elements of this sphere change; the living beings of earth pass
away; only the Ideal-form \[the species\] persists: possibly a similar
process obtains in the All.

The Will of God is able to cope with the ceaseless flux and escape of
body stuff by ceaselessly reintroducing the known forms in new
substances, thus ensuring perpetuity not to the particular item but to
the unity of idea: now, seeing that objects of this realm possess no
more than duration of form, why should celestial objects, and the
celestial system itself, be distinguished by duration of the particular
entity?

Let us suppose this persistence to be the result of the
all-inclusiveness of the celestial and universal- with its consequence,
the absence of any outlying matter into which change could take place or
which could break in and destroy.

This explanation would, no doubt, safeguard the integrity of the Whole,
of the All; but our sun and the individual being of the other heavenly
bodies would not on these terms be secured in perpetuity: they are
parts; no one of them is in itself the whole, the all; it would still be
probable that theirs is no more than that duration in form which belongs
to fire and such entities.

This would apply even to the entire ordered universe itself. For it is
very possible that this too, though not in process of destruction from
outside, might have only formal duration; its parts may be so wearing
each other down as to keep it in a continuous decay while, amid the
ceaseless flux of the Kind constituting its base, an outside power
ceaselessly restores the form: in this way the living All may lie under
the same conditions as man and horse and the rest man and horse
persisting but not the individual of the type.

With this, we would have no longer the distinction of one order, the
heavenly system, stable for ever, and another, the earthly, in process
of decay: all would be alike except in the point of time; the celestial
would merely be longer lasting. If, then, we accepted this duration of
type alone as a true account of the All equally with its partial
members, our difficulties would be eased- or indeed we should have no
further problem- once the Will of God were shown to be capable, under
these conditions and by such communication, of sustaining the Universe.

But if we are obliged to allow individual persistence to any definite
entity within the Kosmos then, firstly, we must show that the Divine
Will is adequate to make it so; secondly, we have to face the question,
What accounts for some things having individual persistence and others
only the persistence of type? and, thirdly, we ask how the partial
entities of the celestial system hold a real duration which would thus
appear possible to all partial things.
