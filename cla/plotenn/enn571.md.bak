#### Section 11

11\. Passing to Quantity and the quantum, we have to consider the view
which identifies them with number and magnitude on the ground that
everything quantitative is numbered among Sensible things or rated by
the extension of its substrate: we are here, of course, discussing not
Quantity in isolation, but that which causes a piece of wood to be three
yards long and gives the five in "five horses,"

Now we have often maintained that number and magnitude are to be
regarded as the only true quantities, and that Space and Time have no
right to be conceived as quantitative: Time as the measure of Motion
should be assigned to Relation, while Space, being that which
circumscribes Body, is also a relative and falls under the same
category; though continuous, it is, like Motion, not included in
Quantity.

On the other hand, why do we not find in the category of Quantity
"great" and "small"? It is some kind of Quantity which gives greatness
to the great; greatness is not a relative, though greater and smaller
are relatives, since these, like doubleness, imply an external
correlative.

What is it, then, which makes a mountain small and a grain of millet
large? Surely, in the first place, "small" is equivalent to "smaller."
It is admitted that the term is applied only to things of the same kind,
and from this admission we may infer that the mountain is "smaller"
rather than "small," and that the grain of millet is not large in any
absolute sense but large for a grain of millet. In other words, since
the comparison is between things of the same kind, the natural predicate
would be a comparative.

Again, why is not beauty classed as a relative? Beauty, unlike
greatness, we regard as absolute and as a quality; "more beautiful" is
the relative. Yet even the term "beautiful" may be attached to something
which in a given relation may appear ugly: the beauty of man, for
example, is ugliness when compared with that of the gods; "the most
beautiful of monkeys," we may quote, "is ugly in comparison with any
other type." Nonetheless, a thing is beautiful in itself; as related to
something else it is either more or less beautiful.

Similarly, an object is great in itself, and its greatness is due, not
to any external, but to its own participation in the Absolute Great.

Are we actually to eliminate the beautiful on the pretext that there is
a more beautiful? No more then must we eliminate the great because of
the greater: the greater can obviously have no existence whatever apart
from the great, just as the more beautiful can have no existence without
the beautiful.
