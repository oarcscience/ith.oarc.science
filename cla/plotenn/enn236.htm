<P>5. But why have we to call in Philosophy to make the Soul immune
if it is thus immune from the beginning?

<P>Because representations attack it at what we call the affective
phase and cause a resulting experience, a disturbance, to which
disturbance is joined the image of threatened evil: this 
amounts to an
affection and Reason seeks to extinguish it, to ban it as
destructive to the well-being of the Soul which by the mere 
absence of
such a condition is immune, the one possible cause of affection not
being present.

<P>Take it that some such affections have engendered appearances
presented before the Soul or Mind from without but taken [for
practical purposes] to be actual experiences within it- then
Philosophy's task is like that of a man who wishes to throw off the
shapes presented in dreams, and to this end recalls to waking
condition the mind that is breeding them.

<P>But what can be meant by the purification of a Soul that 
has never
been stained and by the separation of the Soul from a body 
to which it
is essentially a stranger?

<P>The purification of the Soul is simply to allow it to be 
alone; it
is pure when it keeps no company; when it looks to nothing without
itself; when it entertains no alien thoughts- be the mode or 
origin of
such notions or affections what they may, a subject on which we have
already touched- when it no longer sees in the world of image, much
less elaborates images into veritable affections. Is it not a true
purification to turn away towards the exact contrary of earthly
things?

<P>Separation, in the same way, is the condition of a soul no
longer entering into the body to lie at its mercy; it is to 
stand as a
light, set in the midst of trouble but unperturbed through all.

<P>In the particular case of the affective phase of the Soul,
purification is its awakening from the baseless visions which beset
it, the refusal to see them; its separation consists in limiting its
descent towards the lower and accepting no picture thence, and of
course in the banning for its part too of all which the higher Soul
ignores when it has arisen from the trouble storm and is no longer
bound to the flesh by the chains of sensuality and of 
multiplicity but
has subdued to itself the body and its entire surrounding so that it
holds sovereignty, tranquilly, over all.
