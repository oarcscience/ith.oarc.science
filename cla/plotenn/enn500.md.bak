#### Section 9

9\. What, then, is the content- inevitably separated by our minds- of
this one Intellectual-Principle? For there is no resource but to
represent the items in accessible form just as we study the various
articles constituting one science.

This universe is a living thing capable of including every form of life;
but its Being and its modes are derived from elsewhere; that source is
traced back to the Intellectual-Principle: it follows that the
all-embracing archetype is in the Intellectual-Principle, which,
therefore, must be an intellectual Kosmos, that indicated by Plato in
the phrase "The living existent."

Given the Reason-Principle \[the outgoing divine Idea\] of a certain
living thing and the Matter to harbour this seed-principle, the living
thing must come into being: in the same way once there exists- an
intellective Nature, all powerful, and with nothing to check it- since
nothing intervenes between it and that which is of a nature to receive
it- inevitably the higher imprints form and the lower accepts, it. The
recipient holds the Idea in division, here man, there sun, while in the
giver all remains in unity.
