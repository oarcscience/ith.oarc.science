#### Section 6

6\. The Intellectual Beings, thus, are multiple and one; in virtue of
their infinite nature their unity is a multiplicity, many in one and one
over many, a unit-plurality. They act as entire upon entire; even upon
the partial thing they act as entire; but there is the difference that
at first the partial accepts this working only partially though the
entire enters later. Thus, when Man enters into human form there exists
a particular man who, however, is still Man. From the one thing Man- man
in the Idea- material man has come to constitute many individual men:
the one identical thing is present in multiplicity, in multi-impression,
so to speak, from the one seal.

This does not mean that Man Absolute, or any Absolute, or the Universe
in the sense of a Whole, is absorbed by multiplicity; on the contrary,
the multiplicity is absorbed by the Absolute, or rather is bound up with
it. There is a difference between the mode in which a colour may be
absorbed by a substance entire and that in which the soul of the
individual is identically present in every part of the body: it is in
this latter mode that Being is omnipresent.
