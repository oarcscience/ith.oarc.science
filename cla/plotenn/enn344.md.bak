#### Section 25

25\. But the organ is not the only requisite to vision or to perception
of any kind: there must be a state of the soul inclining it towards the
sphere of sense.

Now it is the soul's character to be ever in the Intellectual sphere,
and even though it were apt to sense-perception, this could not
accompany that intention towards the highest; to ourselves when absorbed
in the Intellectual, vision and the other acts of sense are in abeyance
for the time; and, in general, any special attention blurs every other.
The desire of apprehension from part to part- a subject examining
itself- is merely curiosity even in beings of our own standing, and,
unless for some definite purpose, is waste of energy: and the desire to
apprehend something external- for the sake of a pleasant sight- is the
sign of suffering or deficiency.

Smelling, tasting flavours \[and such animal perceptions\] may perhaps
be described as mere accessories, distractions of the soul, while seeing
and hearing would belong to the sun and the other heavenly bodies as
incidentals to their being. This would not be unreasonable if seeing and
hearing are means by which they apply themselves to their function.

But if they so apply themselves, they must have memory; it is impossible
that they should have no remembrance if they are to be benefactors,
their service could not exist without memory.
