#### Section 3

3\. We will have to examine this Nature, the Intellectual, which our
reasoning identifies as the authentically existent and the veritable
essential: but first we must take another path and make certain that
such a principle does necessarily exist.

Perhaps it is ridiculous to set out enquiring whether an
Intellectual-Principle has place in the total of being: but there may be
some to hesitate even as to this and certainly there will be the
question whether it is as we describe it, whether it is a separate
existence, whether it actually is the real beings, whether it is the
seat of the Ideas; to this we now address ourselves.

All that we see, and describe as having existence, we know to be
compound; hand-wrought or compacted by nature, nothing is simplex. Now
the hand-wrought, with its metal or stone or wood, is not realized out
of these materials until the appropriate craft has produced statue,
house or bed, by imparting the particular idea from its own content.
Similarly with natural forms of being; those including several
constituents, compound bodies as we call them, may be analysed into the
materials and the Idea imposed upon the total; the human being, for
example, into soul and body; and the human body into the four elements.
Finding everything to be a compound of Matter and shaping principle-
since the Matter of the elements is of itself shapeless- you will
enquire whence this forming idea comes; and you will ask whether in the
soul we recognise a simplex or whether this also has constituents,
something representing Matter and something else- the
Intellectual-Principle in it- representing Idea, the one corresponding
to the shape actually on the statue, the other to the artist giving the
shape.

Applying the same method to the total of things, here too we discover
the Intellectual-Principle and this we set down as veritably the maker
and creator of the All. The underly has adopted, we see, certain shapes
by which it becomes fire, water, air, earth; and these shapes have been
imposed upon it by something else. This other is Soul which, hovering
over the Four \[the elements\], imparts the pattern of the Kosmos, the
Ideas for which it has itself received from the Intellectual-Principle
as the soul or mind of the craftsman draws upon his craft for the plan
of his work.

The Intellectual-Principle is in one phase the Form of the soul, its
shape; in another phase it is the giver of the shape- the sculptor,
possessing inherently what is given- imparting to soul nearly the
authentic reality while what body receives is but image and imitation.
