<P>5. Herein lies its greatness, not in mass; mass is 
limited and may
be whittled down to nothingness; in that order no such paring off is
possible- nor, if it were, could there be any falling short. Where
limitation is unthinkable, what fear can there be of absence at any
point? Nowhere can that principle fail which is the unfailing, the
everlasting, the undwindling; suppose it in flux and it must at some
time flow to its end; since it is not in flux- and, besides [as the
All], it has nowhere to flow to- it lies spread over the universe; in
fact it is the universe, too great to be held by body, giving,
therefore, to the material universe but little of itself, the little
which that participant can take.

<P>We may not make this principle the lesser, or if in the sense of
mass we do, we must not begin to mistrust the power of that less to
stretch to the greater. Of course, we have in fact no right to
affirm it less or to measure the thing of magnitude against 
that which
has none; as well talk of a doctor's skill being smaller than his
body. This greatness is not to be thought of in terms of 
quantity; the
greater and less of body have nothing to do with soul.

<P>The nature of the greatness of soul is indicated by the fact
that as the body grows, the larger mass is held by the same soul
that sufficed to the smaller; it would be in many ways absurd to
suppose a corresponding enlargement in the soul.
