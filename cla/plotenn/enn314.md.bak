#### Section 28

28\. Is memory vested in the faculty by which we perceive and learn? Or
does it reside in the faculty by which we set things before our minds as
objects of desire or of anger, the passionate faculty?

This will be maintained on the ground that there could scarcely be both
a first faculty in direct action and a second to remember what that
first experiences. It is certain that the desiring faculty is apt to be
stirred by what it has once enjoyed; the object presents itself again;
evidently, memory is at work; why else, the same object with the same
attraction?

But, at that, we might reasonably ascribe to the desiring faculty the
very perception of the desired objects and then the desire itself to the
perceptive faculty, and so on all through, and in the end conclude that
the distinctive names merely indicate the function which happens to be
uppermost.

Yet the perception is very different from faculty to faculty; certainly
it is sight and not desire that sees the object; desire is stirred
merely as a result of the seeing, by a transmission; its act is not in
the nature of an identification of an object seen; all is simply blind
response \[automatic reaction\]. Similarly with rage; sight reveals the
offender and the passion leaps; we may think of a shepherd seeing a wolf
at his flock, and a dog, seeing nothing, who springs to the scent or the
sound.

In other words the desiring faculty has had the emotion, but the trace
it keeps of the event is not a memory; it is a condition, something
passively accepted: there is another faculty that was aware of the
enjoyment and retains the memory of what has happened. This is confirmed
by the fact that many satisfactions which the desiring faculty has
enjoyed are not retained in the memory: if memory resided in the
desiring faculty, such forgetfulness could not be.
