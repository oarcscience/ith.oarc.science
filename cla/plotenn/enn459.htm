<P>7. Consider the act of ocular vision:

<P>There are two elements here; there is the form perceptible to
the sense and there is the medium by which the eye sees that form.
This medium is itself perceptible to the eye, distinct from the form
to be seen, but the cause of the seeing; it is perceived at the one
stroke in that form and on it and, hence, is not distinguished from
it, the eye being held entirely by the illuminated object. 
When on the
contrary this medium presents itself alone it is seen 
directly- though
even then actual sight demands some solid base; there must be
something besides the medium which, unless embracing some object,
eludes perception; thus the light inherent to the sun would not be
perceived but for the solidity of the mass. If it is 
objected that the
sun is light entire, this would only be a proof of our assertion: no
other visible form will contain light which must, then, have no
other property than that of visibility, and in fact all other
visible objects are something more than light alone.

<P>So it is with the act of vision in the Intellectual Principle.

<P>This vision sees, by another light, the objects 
illuminated by the
First Principle: setting itself among them, it sees veritably;
declining towards the lower Nature, that upon which the light from
above rests, it has less of that vision. Passing over the visible
and looking to the medium by which it sees, then it holds the Light
and the source of Light.

<P>But since the Intellectual-Principle is not to see this light as
something external we return to our analogy; the eye is not wholly
dependent upon an outside and alien light; there is an earlier light
within itself, a more brilliant, which it sees sometimes in a
momentary flash. At night in the darkness a gleam leaps from within
the eye: or again we make no effort to see anything; the eyelids
close; yet a light flashes before us; or we rub the eye and it sees
the light it contains. This is sight without the act, but it is the
truest seeing, for it sees light whereas its other objects were the
lit not the light.

<P>It is certainly thus that the Intellectual-Principle, hiding
itself from all the outer, withdrawing to the inmost, seeing
nothing, must have its vision- not of some other light in some other
thing but of the light within itself, unmingled, pure, suddenly
gleaming before it;
