# Porphyry: On the Life of Plotinus and the Arrangement of his Work

from *Plotinus: The Enneads* translated by Stephen MacKenna

Typed by Owlsmirror/crows -- January 2004

1\. Plotinus, the philosopher our contemporary, seemed ashamed of being
in the body.

So deeply rooted was this feeling that he could never be induced to tell
of his ancestry, his parentage, or his birthplace.

He showed, too, an unconquerable reluctance to sit to a painter of a
sculptor, and when Amelius persisted in urging him to allow of a
portrait being made he asked him, 'Is it not enough to carry about this
image in which nature has enclosed us? Do you really think I must also
consent to leave, as a desired spectacle to posterity, an image of the
image?'

In view of this determined refusal Amelius brought his friend Carterius,
the best artist of the day, to the Conferences, which were open to every
comer, and saw to it that by long observation of the philosopher he
caught his most striking personal traits. From the impressions thus
stored in mind the artist drew a first sketch; Amelius made various
suggestions towards bringing our the resemblance, and in this way,
without the knowledge of Plotinus, the genius of Carterius gave us a
lifelike portrait.

2\. Plotinus was often distressed by an intestinal complaint, but
declined clysters, pronouncing the use of such remedies unbecoming in an
elderly man: in the same way he refused such medicaments as contain any
substance taken from wild beasts or reptiles: all the more, he remarked,
since he could not approve of eating the flesh of animals reared for the
table.

He abstained from the use of the bath, contenting himself with a daily
massage at home: when the terrible epidemic carried off his masseurs he
renounced all such treatment: in a short while he contracted malign
diphtheria.

During the time I was about him there was no sign of any such malady,
but after I sailed for Sicily the condition grew acute: his intimate,
Eustochius, who was with him till his death, told me, on my return to
Rome, that he became hoarse, so that his voice quite lost its clear and
sonorous note, his sight grew dim and ulcers formed on his hands and
feet.

As he still insisted on addressing everyone by word of mouth, his
condition prompted his friends to withdraw from his society: he
therefore left Rome for Campania, retiring to a property which had
belonged to Zethos, an old friend of his at this time dead. His wants
were provided in part out of Zethos' estate, and for the rest were
furnished form Minturnae, where Castricius' property lay.

Of Plotinus' last moments Eustochius has given me an account. He himself
was staying at Puteoli and was late in arriving: when he at last came,
Plotinus said: 'I have been a long time waiting for you; I am striving
to give back the Divine in myself to the Divine in the All.' As he spoke
a snake crept under the bed on which he lay and slipped away into a hole
in the wall: at the same moment Plotinus died.

This was at the end of the second year of the reign of Claudius (A.D.
270), and, as Eustochius tells me, Plotinus was then sixty-six, I myself
was at Lilybaeum at the time, Amelius at Apamea in Syria, Castricius at
Rome; only Eustochius was by his side.

Counting sixty-six years back from the second year of Claudius, we can
fix Plotinus' birth at the thirteenth year of Severus (A.D. 204-5); but
he never disclosed the month or day. This was because he did not desire
any birthday sacrifice or feast; yet he himself sacrificed on the
traditional birthdays of Plato and of Socrates, afterwards giving a
banquet at which every member of the circle who was able was expected to
deliver an address.

3\. Despite his general reluctance to talk of his own life, some few
details he did often relate to us in the course of conversation.

Thus he told how, at the age of eight, when he was already going to
school, he still clung about his nurse and loved to bare her breasts and
take suck: one day he was told he was a 'perverted imp', and so was
shamed out of the trick.

At twenty-seven he was caught by the passion for philosophy: he was
directed to the most highly reputed professors to be found at
Alexandria; but he used to come from their lectures saddened and
discouraged. A friend to whom he opened his heart divined his
temperamental craving and suggested Ammonius, whom he had not yet tried.
Plotinus went, heard a lecture, and exclaimed to his comrade: 'This was
the man I was looking for.'

From that day he followed Ammonius continuously, and under his guidance
made such progress in philosophy that he became eager to investigate the
Persian methods and the system adopted among the Indians. It happened
that the Emperor Gordian was at that time preparing his campaign against
Persia; Plotinus joined the army and went on the expedition. He was then
thirty-eight, for he had passed eleven entire years under Ammonius. When
Gordian was killed in Mesopotamia, it was only with great difficulty
that Plotinus came off safe to Antioch.

At forty, in the reign of Philip, he settled in Rome.

Erennius, Origen, and Plotinus had made a compact not to disclose any of
the doctrines which Ammonius had revealed to them. Plotinus kept faith,
and in all his intercourse with his associates divulged nothing of
Ammonius' system. But the compact was broken, first by Erennius and then
by Origen following suit: Origen, it is true, put in writing nothing but
the treatise *On the Spirit-Beings*, and in Gallienus' reign that
entitled *The King the Sole Creator*. Plotinus himself remained a long
time without writing, but he began to base his Conferences on what he
had gathered from his studies under Ammonius. In this way, writing
nothing but constantly conferring with a certain group of associates, he
passed ten years.

He used to encourage his hearers to put questions, a liberty which, as
Amelius told me, led to a great deal of wandering and futile talk.

Amelius had entered the circle in the third year of Philip's reign, the
third, too, of Plotinus' residence in Rome, and remained about him until
the first year of Claudius, twenty-four years in all. He had come to
Plotinus after an efficient training under Lysimachus: in laborious
diligence he surpassed all his contemporaries; for example, he
transcribed and arranged nearly all the works of Numenius, and was not
far from having most of them off by heart. He also took notes of the
Conferences and wrote them out in something like a hundred treatises
which he has since presented to Hostilianus Hesychius of Apamea, his
adopted son.

4\. I myself arrived from Greece in the tenth year of Gallienus' reign,
accompanied by Antonius of Rhodes, and found Amelius an eighteen-years'
associate of Plotinus, but still lacking the courage to write anything
except for the notebooks, which had not reached their century. Plotinus,
in this tenth year of Gallienus, was about fifty-nine: when I first met
him I was thirty.

From the first year of Gallienus Plotinus had begun to write upon such
subjects as had arisen at the Conferences: when I first came to know him
in this tenth year of the reign he had composed twenty-one treatises.

They were, as I was able to establish, by no means given about freely.
In fact the distribution was still grudging and secret; those that
obtained them had passed the strictest scrutiny.

Plotinus had given no titles to these treatises; everybody headed them
for himself: I cite them here under the titles which finally prevailed,
quoting the first words of each to facilitate identification.  <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

1\. On Beauty (I.6)  
2. On the Immortality of the Soul (IV.7)  
3. On Fate (III.1)  
4. On the Essence of the Soul (IV.2)  
5. On the Intellectual-Principle, on the Ideas, and on the
Authentic-Existent (V.9)  
6. On the Descent of the Soul into Bodies (IV.8)  
7. How the Post-Primal derives from the Primal; and on The One(V.4)  
8. Whether all the Souls are One (IV.9)  
9. On the Good or the One (VI.9)  
10. ON the Three Primal Hypostases (V.1)  
11. On the Origin and Order of the Post-Primals (V.2)  
12. On the Two Orders of Matter (II.4)  
13. Various Questions (III.4)  
14. On the Circular Movement (II.2)  
15. On our Tutelary Spirit (III.4)  
16. On the Reasoned Dismissal (I.9)  
17. On Quality (II.6)  
18. Whether there are Ideas even of Particulars (V.7)  
19. On the Virtues (I.2)  
20. On Dialectic (I.3)  
21. Why the Soul is described as Intermediate between the Existent
having parts and the undisparted Existent (IV.1)

These are the twenty-one treatises which, as I have said, Plotinus had
already written, by his fifty-ninth year, when I first came to him.

5\. I had been, it is true, in Rome a little before this tenth year of
Gallienus, but at that time Plotinus was taking a summer holiday,
engaging merely in conversation with his friends. After coming to know
him I passed six years in close relation with him. Many question were
threshed out in the Conferences of those six years and, under persuasion
from Amelius and myself, he composed two treatises to establish:

22, 23. That the Authentic-Existent is universally an integral,
self-indentical Unity (VI.4,5)

In immediate succession to these he composed two more: one is entitled:

24\. That there is no Intellectual Act in the Principle which transcends
the Authentic-Existent; and on the Nature that has the Intellectual Act
Primally and that which has it Secondarily (V.6)

The other:

25\. On Potentiality and Actuality (II.5)

After these come the following twenty:

26\. On the Impassibility of the Bodiless (III.6)  
27. On the Soul, First (IV.3)  
28. On the Soul, Second (IV.4)  
29. On the Soul, Third; or, How We See (IV.5)  
30. On Contemplation (III.8)  
31. On Intellectual Beauty (V.8)  
32. That the Intelligibles are not outside the Intellectual-Principle;
and on the Good (V.5)  
33. Against the Gnostics (II.9)  
34. On Numbers (VI.6)  
35. Why Distant Objects appear Small (II.8)  
36. Whether Happiness depends upon Extension of Time (I.5)  
37. On Coalescence (II.7)  
38. How the Multitude of Ideas Exists; and on the Good (VI.7)  
39. On Free-Will (VI.8)  
40. On the World (II.1)  
41. On Sensation and Memory (IV.6)  
42. On the Kinds of Being, First (VI.6)  
43. On the Kinds of Being, Second (VI.2)  
44. On the Kinds of Being, Third (VI.3)  
45. On Eternity and Time (III.7)

Thus we have twenty-four treatises composed during the six years of my
association with him and dealing, as the titles indicate, with such
problems as happened to arise at the Conferences; add the twenty-one
composed before my arrival, and we have accounted for forty-five
treatises.

6\. The following five more Plotinus wrote and sent to me while I was
living in Sicily, where I had gone about the fifteenth year of
Gallienus:

46\. On Happiness (I.4)  
47. On Providence, First (III.2)  
48. On Providence, Second (III.3)  
49. On the Conscious Hypostases and the All-Transcending (V.3)  
50. On Love (III.5)

These five he sent me in the first year of Claudius: in the early months
of the second year, shortly before his death, I received the following
four:

51\. On Evil (I.8)  
52. Whether the Stars have Causal Operation (II.3)  
53. On the Animate (I.1)  
54. On Happiness (I.7)

Adding these nine to the forty-five of the first and second sets we have
a total of fifty-four treatises.

According to the time of writing--early manhood, vigorous prime,
worn-out constitution--so the tractates vary in power. The first
twenty-one pieces manifest a slighter capacity, the talent being not yet
matured to the fulness of nervous strength. The twenty-four produced in
the mid-period display the utmost reach of the powers, and except for
the short treatises among them, attain the highest perfection. The last
nine were written when the mental strength was already waning, and of
these the last four show less vigour even than the five preceding.

7\. Plotinus had a large following. Notable among the more zealous
students, really devoted to philosophy, was Amelius of Tuscany, whose
family name was Gentilianus. Amelius preferred to call himself Amerius,
changing L for R, because, as he explained, it suited him better to be
named from Amereia, Unification, then from Ameleia, Indifference.

The group included also one Paulinus, a doctor of Scythopolis, whom
Amelius used to call Mikkalos in allusion to his blundering habit of
mind.

Among closer personal friends was Eustochius of Alexandria, also a
doctor, who came to know Plotinus towards the end of his life, and
attended him until his death: Eutochius consecrated himself exclusively
to Plotinus' system and became a veritable philosopher.

Then there was Zoticus, at once critic and poet, who has amended the
text of Antimachus' works and is the author of an exquisite poem upon
the Atlantis story: is sight failed, and he died a little before
Plotinus, as also did Paulinus.

Another friend was Zethos, an Arabian by descent, who married a daughter
of Ammonius' friend Theodosius. Zethos, too, was a doctor. Plotinus was
deeply attached to him and was always trying to divert him from the
political career in which he stood high. Plotinus was on the most
familiar terms with him, and used to stay with him at his country place,
six miles from Minturnae, a property which had formerly belonged to
Castricius Firmus.

Castricius was excelled by none of the group in appreciation of the
finer side of life: he venerated Plotinus; he devoted himself in the
most faithful comradeship to Amelius in every need, and was in all
matters as loyal to myself as though I were his own brother.

This was another example of a politician venerating the philosopher.
There were also among Plotinus' hearers not a few members of the Senate,
amongst whom Marcellus Orontius and Sabinillus showed the greatest
assiduity in philosophical studies.

Another Senator, Rogatianus, advanced to such detachment from political
ambitions that he gave up all his property, dismissed all his slaves,
renounced every dignity, and, on the point of taking up his praetorship,
the lictors already at the door, refused to come out or to have anything
to do with the office. He even abandoned his own house, spending his
time here and there at this friends' and acquaintances', sleeping and
eating with them and taking, at that, only one meal every other day. He
had been a victim of gout, carried in a chair, but this new regime of
abstinence and abnegation restored his health: he had been unable to
stretch out his hands; he came to use them as freely as men living by
manual labour. Plotinus took a great liking to Rogatianus and frequently
praised him very highly, holding him up as a model to those aiming at
the philosophical life.

Then there was Serapion, an Alexandrian, who began life as a
professional orator and later took to the study of philosophy, but was
never able to conquer the vices of avarice and usury.

I myself, Porphyry of Tyre, was one of Plotinus' very closest friends,
and it was to me he entrusted the task of revising his writings.

8\. Such revision was necessary: Plotinus could not bear to go back on
his work even for one re-reading; and indeed the condition of his sight
would scarcely allow it: his handwriting was slovenly; he misjoined his
words; he cared nothing about spelling; his one concern was for the
idea: in these habits, to our general surprise, he remained unchanged to
the very end.

He used to work out his design mentally from first to last: when he came
to set down his ideas, he wrote out at one jet all he had stored in mind
as though he were copying from a book.

Interrupted, perhaps, by someone entering on business, he never lost
hold of his plan; he was able to meet all the demands of the
conversation and still keep his own train of thought clearly before him;
when he was fee again, he never looked over what he had previously
written--his sight, it has been mentioned, did not allow of such
re-reading--but he linked on what was to follow as if no distraction had
occurred.

Thus he was able to live at once within himself and for others; he never
relaxed from his interior attention unless in sleep; and even his sleep
was kept light be an abstemiousness that often prevented him taking as
much as a piece of bread, and by this unbroken concentration upon his
own highest nature.

9\. Several women were greatly attached to him, amongst them Gemina, in
whose house he lived, and her daughter, called Gemina, too, after the
mother, and Amphiclea, the wife Ariston, son Iamblichus; all three
devoted themselves assiduously to philosophy.

Not a few men and women of position, on the approach of death, had left
their boys and girls, with all their property, in his care, feeling that
with Plotinus for guardian the children would be in holy hands. His
house therefore was filled with lads lasses, amongst them Potamon, in
whose education he took such interest as often to hear the boy recite
verses of his own composition.

He always found time for those that came to submit returns of the
children's property, and he looked closely to the accuracy of the
accounts: 'Until the young people take to philosophy,' he used to say,
'their fortunes and revenues must be kept intact for them.' And yet all
this labour and thought over the worldly interests of so many people
never interrupted, during waking hours, his intention towards the
Supreme.

He was gentle, and always at the call of those having the slightest
acquaintance with him. After spending twenty-six years in Rome, acting,
too, as arbiter in many differences, he had never made an enemy of any
citizen.

10\. Among those making profession of Philosophy at Rome was one
Olympius, an Alexandrian, who had been for a little while a pupil of
Ammonius.

This man's jealous envy showed itself in continual insolence, and
finally he grew so bitter that he even ventured sorcery, seeking to
crush Plotinus by star-spells. But he found his experiments recoiling
upon himself, and he confessed to his associates that Plotinus possessed
'a mighty soul, so powerful, as to be able to hurl every assault back
upon those that sought his ruin'. Plotinus had felt the operation and
declared that at that moment Olympius' 'limbs were convulsed and his
body shrivelling like a money-bag pulled tight'. Olympius, perceiving on
several attempts that he was endangering himself rather than Plotinus,
desisted.

In fact Plotinus possessed by birth something more than is accorded to
other men. An Egyptian priest who had arrived in Rome and, through some
friend, had been presented to the philosopher, became desirous of
displaying his powers to him, and he offered to evoke a visible
manifestation of Plotinus' presiding spirit. Plotinus readily consented
and the evocation was made in the Temple of Isis, the only place, they
say, which the Egyptian could find pure in Rome.

At the summons a Divinity appeared, not a being of the spirit-ranks, and
the Egyptian exclaimed: 'You are singularly graced; the guiding-spirit
within you is not of the lower degree but a God.' It was not possible,
however, to interrogate or even to contemplate this God any further, for
the priest's assistant, who had been holding the birds to prevent them
flying away, strangled them, whether through jealousy or in terror. Thus
Plotinus had for indwelling spirit a Being of the more divine degree,
and he kept his own divine spirit unceasingly intent upon that inner
presence. It was this preoccupation that led him to write his treatise
upon *Our Tutelary Spirit*, an essay in the explanation of the
differences among spirit-guides.

Amelius was scrupulous in observing the day of the New-Moon and other
holy-days, and once asked Plotinus to join in some such celebration:
Plotinus refused: 'It is for those Beings to come to me, not for me to
go to them.'

What was in his mind in so lofty an utterance we could not explain to
ourselves and we dared not ask him.

11\. He had a remarkable penetration into character.

Once a valuable necklace was stolen from Chione, who was living in
honourable widowhood with her children in the same house as Plotinus:
the servants were called before him: he scrutinized them all, then
indicated one: 'This man is the thief.' The man was whipped but for some
time persisted in denial: finally, however, he confessed, and restored
the necklace.

Plotinus foretold also the future of each of the children in the
household: for instance, when questioned as to Polemon's character and
destiny he said: 'He will be amorous and short-lived': and so it proved.

I myself at one period had formed the intention of ending my life;
Plotinus discerned my purpose; he came unexpectedly to my house where I
had secluded myself, told me that my decision sprang not from reason but
from mere melancholy and advised me to leave Rome. I obeyed and left for
Sicily, which I chose because I heard that one Probus, a man of
scholarly repute, was living there not far from Lilybaeum. Thus I was
induced to abandon my first intention but was prevented from being with
Plotinus between that time and his death.

12\. The Emperor Gallienus and his wife Salonina greatly honoured and
venerated Plotinus, who thought to turn their friendly feeling to some
good purpose. In Campania there had once stood, according to tradition,
a City of Philosophers, a ruin now; Plotinus asked the Emperor to
rebuild this city and to make over the surrounding district to the
new-founded state; the population was to live under Plato's laws: the
city was to be called Platonopolis; and Plotinus undertook to settle
down there with his associates. He would have had his way without more
ado but that opposition at court, prompted by jealousy, spite, or some
such paltry motive, put an end to the plan.

13\. At the Conferences he showed the most remarkable power of going to
the heart of a subject, whether in exposition or in explanation, and his
phrasing was apt; but he made mistakes in certain words; for example, he
said 'anamnemisketai' for 'anamimnesketai'--just such errors as he
committed in his writing.

When he was speaking his intellect visibly illuminated his face: always
of winning presence, he became at these times still more engaging: a
slight moisture gathered on his forehead; he radiated benignity.

He was always as ready to entertain objections as he was powerful in
meeting them. At one time I myself kept interrogating him during three
days as to how the soul is associated with the body, and he continued
explaining; a man called Thaumasius entered in the midst of our
discussions; the visitor was more interested in the general drift of the
system than in particular points, and said he wished to hear Plotinus
expounding some theory as he would in a set treatise, but that he could
not endure Porphyry's questions and answers: Plotinus asked, 'But if we
cannot first solve the difficulties Porphyry raises what could go into
the treatise?'

14\. In style Plotinus is concise, dense with thought, terse, more
lavish of ideas than of words, most often expressing himself with a
fervid inspiration. He followed his own path rather than that of
tradition, but in his writings both the Stoic and Peripatetic doctrines
are sunk; Aristotle's Metaphysics, especially, is condensed in them, all
but entire.

He had a thorough theoretical knowledge of Geometry, Mechanics, Optics,
and Music, though it was not in his temperament to go practically into
these subjects.

At the Conferences he used to have treatises by various authors read
aloud--among the Platonists it might be Severus of Cronius, Numenius,
Gaius, or Atticus; and among the Peripatetics Aspasius, Alexander,
Adrastus, or some such writer, at the call of the moment. But it was far
from his way to follow any of these authors blindly; he took a personal,
original view, applying Ammonius' method to the investigation of every
problem.

He was quick to absorb; a few words sufficed him to make clear the
significance of some profound theory and so to pass on. After hearing
Longinus' work *On Causes* and his *Antiquary*, he remarked: 'Longinus
is a man of letters, but in no sense a philosopher.'

One day Origen came to the conference-room; Plotinus blushed deeply and
was on the point of bringing his lecture to an end; when Origen begged
him to continue, he said: 'The zest dies down when the speaker feels
that his hearers have nothing to learn from him.'

15\. Once on Plato's feast I read a poem, 'The Sacred Marriage'; my
piece abounded in mystic doctrine conveyed in veiled words and was
couched in terms of enthusiasm; someone exclaimed: 'Porphyry has gone
mad'; Plotinus said to me so that all might hear: 'You have shown
yourself at once poet, philosopher and hierophant.'

The orator Diophanes one day read a justification of the Alcibiades of
Plato's Banquet and maintained that the pupil, for the sake of
advancement in virtue, should submit to the teacher without reserve,
even to the extent of carnal commerce: Plotinus started up several times
to leave the room but forced himself to remain; on the breaking up of
the company he directed me to write a refutation. Diophanes refused to
lend me his address and I had to depend on my recollection of his
argument; but my refutation, delivered before the same audience,
delighted Plotinus so much that during the very reading he repeatedly
quoted: 'So strike and be a light to men.'

When Eubulus, the Platonic Successor, wrote from Athens, sending
treatises on some questions in Platonism. Plotinus had the writings put
into my hands with instructions to examine them and report to him upon
them.

He paid some attention to the principles of Astronomy though he did not
study the subject very deeply on the mathematical side. He went more
searchingly into Horoscopy; when once he was convinced that its results
were not to be trusted he had no hesitation in attacking the system
frequently both at the Conferences and in his writings.

16\. Many Christians of this period--amongst them sectaries who had
abandoned the old philosophy, men of the schools of Adelphius and
Aquilinus--had possessed themselves of works by Alexander of Libya, by
Philocomus, by Demostratus, and bby Lydus, and exhibited also
Revelations bearing the names of Zoroaster, Zostrianus, Nicotheus,
Allogenes, Mesus, and others of that order. Thus they fooled many,
themselves fooled first; Plato, according to them, had failed to
penetrate into the depth of Intellectual Being.

Plotinus fequently attacked their position at the Conferences and
finally wrote the treatise which I have headed *Against the Gnostics*:
he left to us of the circle the task of examining what he himself passed
over. Amelius proceeded as far as a fortieth treatise in refutation of
the book of Zostrianus: I myself have shown on many counts that the
Zoroastrian volume is spurious and modern, concocted by the sectaries in
order to pretend that the doctrines they had embraced were those of the
ancient sage.

17\. Some of the Greeks began to accuse Plotinus of appropriating the
ideas of Numenius.

Amelius, being informed of this charge by the Stoic and Platonist
Trypho, challenged it in a treatise which he entitled *The Difference
between the Doctrines of Plotinus and Numenius*. He dedicated the work
to me, under the name of Basileus (or King). This really is my name; it
is equivalent to Porphyry (Purple-robed) and translates the name I bear
in my own tongue; for I am called Malchos, like my father, and 'Malchos'
would give 'Basileus' in Greek. Longinus, in dedicating his work *On
Impulse* to Cleodamus and myself, addressed us as 'Cleodamus and
Malchus', just as Numenius translated the Latin 'Maximus' into its Greek
equivalent 'Megalos'.

Here followed Amelius' letter:

'Amelius to Basileus, with all good wishes.

'You have been, in your own phrase, pestered by the persistent assertion
that our friend's doctrine is to be traced to Numenius of Apamea.

'Now, if it were merely for those illustrious personages who spread this
charge, you may be very sure I would never utter a word in reply. It is
sufficiently clear that they are actuated solely by the famous and
astonishing facility of speech of theirs when they assert, at one
moment, that he is an idle babbler, next that he is a plagiarist, and
finally that his plagiarisms are feeble in the extreme. Clearly in all
this we have nothing but scoffing and abuse.

'But your judgement has persuaded me that we should profit by this
occasion firstly to provide ourselves with a useful memorandum of the
doctrines that have won our adhesion, and secondly to bring about a more
complete knowledge of the system--long celebrated thought it be--to the
glory of our friend, a man so great as Plotinus.

'Hence I now bring you the promised Reply, executed, as you and your
self know, in three days. You must judge it with reasonable indulgence;
this is no orderly and elaborate defence composed in step-by-step
correspondence with the written indictment: I have simply set down, as
they occurred to me, my recollections of our frequent discussions. You
will admit, also, that it is by no means easy to grasp the meaning of a
writer who (like Numenius), now credited with the opinion we also hold,
varies in the terms he uses to express the one idea.

'If I have falsified any essential of the doctrine, I trust to your good
nature to set me right: I am reminded of the phrase in the tragedy: A
busy man and far from the teachings of our master I must needs correct
and recant. Judge how much I wish to give you pleasure. Good health.'

18\. This letter seemed worth insertion as showing, not merely that some
contemporary judgement pronounced Plotinus to be parading on the
strength of Numenius' ideas, but that he was even despised as a
word-spinner.

The fact is that these people did not understand his teaching: he was
entirely free from all the inflated pomp of the professor: his lectures
had the air of conversation, and he never forced upon his hearers the
severely logical substructure of his thesis.

I myself, when I first heard him, had the same experience. It led me to
combat his doctrine in a paper in which I tried to show that the
Intelligibles exist outside of the Intellectual-Principle. He had my
work read to him by Amelius: at the end he smiled and said: 'You must
clear up these difficulties, Amelius: Porphyry doesn't understand our
position.' Amelius wrote a tract of considerable length *In answer to
Porphyry's Objections*; I wrote a reply to the reply: Amelius replied to
my reply; at my third attempt I came, though even so with difficulty, to
grasp the doctrine: then only, I was converted, wrote a recantation, and
read it before the circle. From that time on I was entrusted with
Plotinus' writings and sought to stir in the master himself the ambition
of organizing his doctrine and setting it down in more extended form.
Amelius, too, under my prompting, was encouraged in composition.

19\. Longinus' estimate of Plotinus, formed largely upon indications I
myself had given him in my letters, will be gathered from the following
extract from one of his to me. He is asking me to leave Sicily and join
him in Phoenicia, and to bring Plotinus' works with me. He says:

'And send them at your convenience or, better, bring them; for I can
never cease urging you to give the road towards us the preference over
any other. If there is no better reason--and what intellectual gain can
you anticipate form a visit to us?--at least there are old acquaintances
and the mild climate which would do you good in the weak state of health
you report. Whatever else you may be expecting, do not hope for anything
new of my own, or even for the earlier works which you tell me you have
lost; for there is a sad dearth of copyists here. I assure you it has
taken me all this time to complete my set of Plotinus, and it was done
only by calling off my scribe from all his routine work, and keeping him
steadily to this one task.

'I think that now, with what you have sent me, I have everything, though
in a very imperfect state, for the manuscript is exceeding faulty. I had
expected our friend Amelius to correct the scribal errors, but he
evidently had something better to do. The copies are quite useless to
me; I have been especially eager to examine the treatises *On the Soul*
and *On the Authentic-Existent*, and these are precisely the most
corrupted. It would be a great satisfaction to me if you would send me
faithful transcripts for collation and return--though again I suggest to
you not to send but to come in person, bringing me the correct copies of
these treatises and of any that Amelius may have passed over. All that
he brought with him I have been careful to make my own: how could I be
content not to possess myself of all the writings of a man so worthy of
the deepest veneration?

'I repeat, what I have often said in your presence and in your absence,
as on that occasion when you were at Tyre, that while much of the theory
does not convince me, yet I am filled with admiration and delight over
the general character of the work, the massive thinking of the man, the
philosophic handling of problems; in my judgement investigators must
class Plotinus' work with that holding the very highest rank.'

20\. This extended quotation from the most acute of the critics of our
day--a writer who has passed judgement on nearly all his
contemporaries--serves to show the estimate he came to set upon Plotinus
of whom, at first, misled by ignorant talk, he had held a poor opinion.

His notion, by the way, that the transcripts he acquired from Amelius
were faulty sprang from his misunderstanding of Plotinus' style and
phraseology; if there were ever any accurate copies, these were they,
faithful reproductions from the author's own manuscript.

Another passage from the work of Longinus, dealing with Amelius,
Plotinus, and other metaphysicians of the day, must be inserted here to
give a complete view of the opinion formed upon these philosophers by
the most authoritative and most searching of critics. The work was
entitled *On the End: in Answer to Plotinus and Gentilianus Amelius*. It
opens with the following preface:

'In our time, Marcellus, there have been many philosophers--especially
in our youth--for there is a strange scarcity at present. When I was a
boy, my parents' long journeys gave me the opportunity of seeing all the
better-known teachers; and in later life those that still lived became
known to me as my visits to this and that city and people brought me
where they happened to live.

'Some of these undertook the labour of developing their theories in
formal works and so have bequeathed to the future the means of profiting
by their services. Others thought they had done enough when they had
convinced their own immediate hearers of the truth of their theories..

'First of those that have written.

'Among the Platonists there are Euclides, Democritus, Proclinus the
philosopher of the Troad, and the two who still profess philosophy at
Rome, Plotinus and his friend Gentilianus Amelius. Among the Stoics
there are Themistocles and Phoibion and the two who flourished only a
little while ago, Annius and Medius. And there is the Peripatetic,
Heliodorus of Alexandria.

'For those that have not written, there are among the Platonists
Ammonius and Origen, two teachers whose lectures I myself attended
during a long period, men greatly surpassing their contemporaries in
mental power; and there are the Platonic Successors at Athens, Theodotus
and Eubulus.

'No doubt some writing of a metaphysical order stands to the credit of
this group: Origen wrote *On Spirit-Beings, Eubulus On the Philebus and
Gorgias, and the objections urged by Aristotle to Plato's Republic*; but
this is not enough to class either of them with systematic authors. This
was side-play; authorship was not in the main plan of their careers.

'Among Stoic teachers that refrained from writing we have Herminus and
Lysimachus, and the two living at Athens, Musonius and Athenaeus; among
Peripatetics, Ammonius and Ptolemaeus.

'The two last were the most accomplished scholars of their time,
Ammonius especially being unapproached in breadth of learning; but
neither produced any systematic work; we have from them merely verses
and duty-speeches; and these I cannot think to have been preserved with
their consent; they did not concern themselves about formal statement of
their doctrine, and it is not likely they would wish to be known in
after times by compositions of so trivial a nature.

'To return to the writers; some of them, like Euclides, Democritus, and
Proclinus, confined themselves to the mere compilation and transcription
of passages from earlier authorities. Others diligently worked over
various minor points in the investigations of the ancients, and put
together books dealing with the same subjects. Such were Annius, Medius,
and Phoibion, the last especially choosing to be distinguished for style
rather than for systematic thinking. In the same class must be ranked
Heliodorus; his writings contribute nothing to the organization of the
thought which he found to his hand in the teaching of earlier workers.

'Plotinus and Gentilianus Amelius alone display the true spirit of
authorship; they treat of a great number of questions and they bring a
method of their own to the treatment.

'Plotinus, it would seem, set the principles of Pythagoras and of Plato
in a clearer light than anyone before him; on the same subjects,
Numenius, Cronius, Moderatus, and Thrasyllus fall far short of him in
precision and fullness. Amelius set himself to walk in Plotinus' steps
and adopted most of Plotinus' opinions; his method, however, was diffuse
an, unlike his friend, he indulges in an extravagance of explanation.
'Only these two seem to me worth study. What profit can anyone expect
from troubling the works of any of the others to the neglect of the
originals on which they drew? They bring us nothing of their own, not
even a novel augment, much less a leading idea, and are too unconcerned
even to set side by side the most generally adopted theories or to
choose the better among them.

'My own method has been different; as for example when I replied to
Gentilianus upon Plato's treatment of Justice and in a review I
undertook of Plotinus' work *On the Ideas*. This latter was in the form
of a reply to Basileus of Tyre, my friend as theirs. He had preferred
Plotinus' system to mine and had written several works in the manner of
his master, amongst them a treatise supporting Plotinus' theory of the
Idea against that which I taught. I endeavoured, not, I think,
unsuccessfully, to show that his change of mind was mistaken.

'In these two essays I have ranged widely over the doctrines of this
school, as also in my *Letter to Amelius* which, despite the simple
title with which I contented myself, has the dimensions of a book, being
a reply to a treatise he addressed to me from Rome under the title *On
Plotinus' Philosophic Method*.'

21\. This Preface leaves no doubt of Longinus' final verdict: he ranks
Plotinus and Amelius above all authors of his time in the multitude of
questions they discuss; he credits them with an original method of
investigation: in his judgement they by no means took their system from
Numenius or gave a first place to his opinions, but followed the
Pythagorean and Platonic schools; finally he declares the writings of
Numenius, Cronius, Moderatus, and Thrasyllus greatly inferior in
precision and fullness to those of Plotinus.

Notice, by the way, that while AMelius id described as following in
Plotinus' footsteps, it is indicated that his temperamental prolixity
led him to delight in an extravagance of explanation foreign to his
master: in the reference to myself, though I was then only at the
beginning of my association with Plotinus--'Basileus of Tyre, my friend
as theirs, who has written a good deal, has taken Plotinus as his
model'--Longinus recognizes that I entirely avoided Amelius'
unphilosophical prolixity and made Plotinus' manner my standard.

Such a pronouncement upon the value of Plotinus' work, coming from so
great an authority, the first of critics then as now, must certainly
carry weight, and I may remark that if I had been able to confer with
him, during such a visit as he proposed, he would not have written to
combat doctrines which he had not thoroughly penetrated.

22\. But why talk, to use Hesiod's phrase, 'About Oak and Rock'? If we
are to accept the evidence of the wise--who could be wiser than a God?
And here the witness is the same God that said with truth:

'I have numbered the sands and taken the measure of the sea; I
understand the dumb and hear where there has been no speech.'

Apollo was consulted by Amelius, who desired to learn where Plotinus'
soul had gone. And Apollo, who uttered of Socrates that great praise,
'Of all men, Socrates the wisest'--you shall hear what a full and lofty
oracle Apollo rendered upon Plotinus.

I raise an undying song, to the memory of a gently friend, a hymn of
praise woven to the honey-sweet tones of my lyre under the touch of the
golden plectrum.

The Muses, too, I call to lift the voice with me in strains of
many-toned exultation, in passion ranging over all the modes of song:
even as of old they raised the famous chant to the glory of Aeacides in
the immortal ardours of the Homeric line.

Come, then, Sacred Chorus, let us intone with one great sound the utmost
of all song, I Phoebus, Bathychaites, singing in the midst.

Celestial! Man at first but now nearing the diviner ranks! the bonds of
human necessity are loosed for you and, strong of heart, you beat your
eager way from out the roaring tumult of the fleshly life to the shores
of that wave-washed coast free from the thronging of the guilty, thence
to take the grateful path of the sinless soul: where glows the splendour
of God, where Right is throned in the stainless place, far from the
wrong that mocks at law.

Oft-times as you strove to rise above the bitter waves of this
blood-drenched life, above the sickening whirl, toiling in the mid-most
of the rushing flood and the unimaginable turmoil, oft-times, from the
Ever-Blessed, there was shown to you the Term still close at hand:

Oft-times, when your mind thrust out awry and was like to be rapt down
unsanctioned paths, the Immortals themselves prevented, guiding you on
the straightgoing way to the celestial spheres, pouring down before you
a dense shaft of light that your eyes might see from amid the mournful
gloom.

Sleep never closed those eyes: high above the heavy murk of the mist you
held them; tossed in the welter, you still had vision; still you saw
sights many and fair not granted to all that labour in wisdom's quest.

But not that you have cast the screen aside, quitted the tomb that held
your lofty soul, you enter at once the heavenly consort: where fragrant
breezes play, where all is unison and winning tenderness and guileless
joy, and the place is lavish of the nectar-streams the unfailing Gods
bestow, with the blandishments of the Loves, and delicious airs, and
tranquil sky:

where Minos and Rhadamanthus dwell, great brethren of the golden race of
mighty Zeus; where dwell the just Aeacus, and Plato, consecrated power,
and stately Pythagoras and all else that form the Choir of Immortal
Love, that share their parentage with the most blessed spirits, there
where the heart is ever lifted in joyous festival.

O Blessed One, you have fought your many fights; now, crowned with
unfading life, your days are with the Ever-Holy.

Rejoicing Muses, let us stay our song and the subtle windings of our
dance; thus much I could but tell, to my golden lyre, of Plotinus, the
hallowed soul.

23\. Good and kindly, singularly gentle and engaging: thus the oracle
presents him, and so in fact we found him. Sleeplessly alert--Apollo
tells--pure of soul, ever striving towards the divine which he loved
with all his being, he laboured strenuously to free himself and rise
above the bitter waves of this blood-drenched life: and this is why to
Plotinus--God-like and lifting himself often, by the ways of meditation
and by the methods Plato teaches in the Banquet, to the first and
all-transcendent God--that God appeared, the God who has neither shape
nor form but sits enthroned above the Intellectual-Principle and all the
Intellectual-Sphere.

'There was shown to Plotinus the Term ever near': for the Term, the one
end, of his life was to become Uniate, to approach to the God over all:
and four times, during the period I passed with him, he achieved this
Term, by no mere latent fitness but by the ineffable Act.

To this God, I also declare, I Porphyry, that in my sixty-eighth year I
too was once admitted and I entered into Union.

We are told that often when he was leaving the way, the Gods set him on
the true path again, pouring down before him a dense shaft of light;
here we are to understand that in his writing he was overlooked and
guided by the divine powers.

'In this sleepless vision within and without,' the oracle says, 'your
eyes have beheld sights many and fair not vouchsafed to all that take
the philosophic path': contemplation in man may sometimes be more than
human, but compare it with the True-Knowing of the Gods and, wonderful
though it be, it can never plunge into the depths their divine vision
fathoms.

Thus far the Oracle recounts what Plotinus accomplished and to what
heights he attained while still in the body: emancipated from the body,
we are told how he entered the celestial circle where all is friendship,
tender delight, happiness, and loving union with God, where Minos and
Rhadamanthus and Aeacus, the sons of God, are enthroned as judges of
souls--not, however, to hold him to judgement but as welcoming him to
their consort to which are bidden spirits pleasing to the Gods--Plato,
Pythagoras, and all the people of the Choir of Immortal Love, there
where the blessed spirits have their birth-home and live in days filled
full of 'joyous festival' and made happy by the Gods.

24\. I have related Plotinus' life; something remains to tell of my
revision and arrangement of his writings. This task he himself had
imposed upon me during his lifetime and I had pledged myself to him and
to the circle to carry it out.

I judged that in the case of treatises which, like these, had been
issued without consideration of logical sequence it was best to
disregard the time-order.

Apollodorus, the Athenian, edited in ten volumes the collected works of
Epicharmus, the comedy writer; Andronicus, the Peripatetic, Classified
the works ofAristotle and of Theoophrastus according to subject,
bringing together the discussions of related topics: I have adopted a
similar plan.

I had fifty-four treatises before me: I divided them into six sets of
nine, an arrangement which pleased me by the happy combination of the
perfect number six with the nines: to each such ennead I assigned matter
of one general nature, leading off with the themes presenting the least
difficulty.

THE FIRST ENNEAD, on this method, contains the treatises of a more
ethical tendency:

1\. On the Animate and the Man.  
2. On the Virtues.  
3. On Dialectic.  
4. On Happiness.  
5. Whether Happiness depends on Extension of Time.  
6. On Beauty.  
7. On the Primal Good and Secondary forms of Good.  
8. On Evil.  
9. On the Reasoned Withdrawal from Life.

THE SECOND ENNEAD, following the more strictly ethical First, is
physical, containing the disquisitions on the world and all that belongs
to the world:

1\. On the World.  
2. On the Circular Movement.  
3. Whether the Stars have Causal Operation.  
4. On the Two Orders of Matter.  
5. On Potentiality and Actuality.  
6. On Quality and Form.  
7. On Coalescence.  
8. Why Distant Objects appear Small.  
9. Against those Declaring the Creator of the World, and the World
itself, to be Evil.

THE THIRD ENNEAD, still keeping to the World, discusses the
philosophical implications of some of its features:

1\. On Fate.  
2. The First Treatise on Providence.  
3. The Second Treatise on Providence.  
4. On Our Tutelary Spirit.  
5. On Love.  
6. On the Impassibility of the Bodiless.  
7. On Eternity and Time.  
8. On Nature, Contemplation, and The One.  
9. Various Questions.

25\. These first three Enneads constitute in my arrangement one
self-contained section.

The treatise on Our Tutelary Spirit is placed in the Third Ennead
because this Spirit is not discussed as it is in itself, and the essay
by its main content falls into the class dealing with the origin of man.
Similar reasons determined the inclusion in this set of the treatise on
Love. That on Eternity and Time is placed in this Third Ennead in virtue
of its treatment of Time: that on Nature, Contemplation, and The One,
because of the discussion of Nature contained in it.

Next to the two dealing with the world comes the FOURTH ENNEAD
containing the treatises dealing with the Soul:

1\. On the Essence of the Soul (I)  
2. On the Essence of the Soul (II)  
3. Questions referring to the Soul (I)  
4. Questions referring to the Soul (II)  
5. Questions referring to the Soul (III)  
6. On Sensation and Memory.  
7. On the Immortality of the Soul.  
8. On the Descent of the Soul into Bodies.  
9. Whether all Souls are One.

THE FIFTH ENNEAD--following upon that dealing with the Soul--contains
the treatises upon the Intellectual-Principle, each of which had also
some reference to the All-Transcending and to the Intellectual-Principle
in the Soul, and to the Ideas:

1\. On the three Primal Hypostases.  
2. On the Origin and Order of the Post-Primals.  
3. On the Conscious Hypostases and the All-Transcending.  
4. How the Post-Primal derives from the Primal, and on the One.  
5. That the Intelligibles are not outside the Intellectual-Principle,
and on the Good.  
6. That there is no Intellectual Act in the Principle which transcends
the Authentic-Existent; and on the Nature that has the Intellectual Act
Primally and that which has it Secondarily.  
7. Whether there are Ideas even of Particulars.  
8. On Intellectual Beauty.  
9. On the Intellectual-Principle, on the Ideas, and on the
Authentic-Existent.

26\. These Fourth and Fifth Enneads, again, I have arranged in the form
of one distinct section.

The last Ennead, the Sixth, constitutes one other section, so that we
have the entire work of Plotinus in three sections, the first containing
three Enneads, the second two, the third one Ennead.

The content of the third section, that is of the SIXTH ENNEAD, is as
follows:

1,2,3. On the Kinds of Being.  
4,5. That the Authentic-Existent, on and identical, is everywhere
present, integrally.  
6. On Numbers.  
7. How the Multitude of Ideas Exists; and on the Good  
8. On Free-Will and the Will of the One.  
9. On the Good, or The One.

Thus, in sum, I have arranged the fifty-four treatises, constituting
Plotinus' entire work, into six sets of nine: to some of the treatises I
have further added commentaries--irregularly, as friends asked for
enlightenment on this or that point; finally for all the treatises,
except that on Beauty, which was not to hand, I have written Summaries
which follow the chronological order: in this department of my work
besides the Summaries will be found Developments; the numbering of these
also adopts the chronological order.

Now I have only to go once more through the entire work, see to the
punctuation, and correct any verbal errors; what else has solicited my
attention, the reader will discover for himself.
