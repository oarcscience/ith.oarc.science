<P>14. But would this mean that if there were no Matter 
nothing would
exist?

<P>Precisely as in the absence of a mirror, or something of similar
power, there would be no reflection.

<P>A thing whose very nature is to be lodged in something 
else cannot
exist where the base is lacking- and it is the character of a
reflection to appear in something not itself.

<P>Of course supposing anything to desert from the Authentic
Beings, this would not need an alien base: but these Beings are not
subject to flux, and therefore any outside manifestation of them
implies something other than themselves, something offering a base
to what never enters, something which by its presence, in its
insistence, by its cry for help, in its beggardom, strives as it
were by violence to acquire and is always disappointed, so that its
poverty is enduring, its cry unceasing.

<P>This alien base exists and the myth represents it as a pauper to
exhibit its nature, to show that Matter is destitute of The Good.
The claimant does not ask for all the Giver's store, but it welcomes
whatever it can get; in other words, what appears in Matter is not
Reality.

<P>The name, too [Poverty], conveys that Matter's need is never
met. The union with Poros, Possession, is designed to show 
that Matter
does not attain to Reality, to Plenitude, but to some bare
sufficiency- in point of fact to imaging skill.

<P>It is, of course, impossible that an outside thing belonging in
any degree to Real-Being- whose Nature is to engender Real-Beings-
should utterly fail of participation in Reality: but here we have
something perplexing; we are dealing with utter Non-Being,
absolutely without part in Reality; what is this participation by
the non-participant, and how does mere neighbouring confer 
anything on
that which by its own nature is precluded from any association?

<P>The answer is that all that impinges upon this Non-Being is
flung back as from a repelling substance; we may think of an Echo
returned from a repercussive plane surface; it is precisely 
because of
the lack of retention that the phenomenon is supposed to belong to
that particular place and even to arise there.

<P>If Matter were participant and received Reality to the extent
which we are apt to imagine, it would be penetrated by a Reality
thus sucked into its constitution. But we know that the 
Entrant is not
thus absorbed: Matter remains as it was, taking nothing to itself:
it is the check to the forthwelling of Authentic Existence; it is a
ground that repels; it is a mere receptacle to the Realities as they
take their common path and here meet and mingle. It resembles those
reflecting vessels, filled with water, which are often set 
against the
sun to produce fire: the heat rays- prevented, by their contrary
within, from being absorbed- are flung out as one mass.

<P>It is in this sense and way that Matter becomes the cause of the
generated realm; the combinations within it hold together only after
some such reflective mode.
