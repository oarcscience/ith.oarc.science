#### Section 4

4\. What, then, we have to ask, is the constant element in the first
three entities? What is it that identifies them with their inherent
Substance?

Is it the capacity to serve as a base? But Matter, we maintain, serves
as the base and seat of Form: Form, thus, will be excluded from the
category of Substance. Again, the Composite is the base and seat of
attributes: hence, Form combined with Matter will be the basic ground of
Composites, or at any rate of all posteriors of the Composite- Quantity,
Quality, Motion, and the rest.

But perhaps we may think Substance validly defined as that which is not
predicated of anything else. White and black are predicated of an object
having one or other of these qualities; double presupposes something
distinct from itself- we refer not to the half, but to the length of
wood of which doubleness is affirmed. father qua father is a predicate;
knowledge is predicated of the subject in whom the knowledge exists;
space is the limit of something, time the measure of something. Fire, on
the other hand, is predicated of nothing; wood as such is predicated of
nothing; and so with man, Socrates, and the composite substance in
general.

Equally the Substantial Form is never a predicate, since it never acts
as a modification of anything. Form is not an attribute of Matter hence,
is not predicable of Matter it is simply a constituent of the
Couplement. On the other hand, the Form of a man is not different from
the man himself \[and so does not "modify" the Couplement\].

Matter, similarly, is part of a whole, and belongs to something else
only as to a whole and not as to a separate thing of which it is
predicated. White, on the contrary, essentially belongs to something
distinct from itself.

We conclude that nothing belonging to something else and predicated of
it can be Substance. Substance is that which belongs essentially to
itself, or, in so far as it is a part of the differentiated object,
serves only to complete the Composite. Each or either part of the
Composite belongs to itself, and is only affirmed of the Composite in a
special sense: only qua part of the whole is it predicated of something
else; qua individual it is never in its essential nature predicated of
an external.

It may be claimed as a common element in Matter, Form and the Couplement
that they are all substrates. But the mode in which Matter is the
substrate of Form is different from that in which Form and the
Couplement are substrates of their modifications.

And is it strictly true to say that Matter is the substrate of Form?
Form is rather the completion which Matter's nature as pure potentiality
demands.

Moreover, Form cannot be said to reside in Matter \[as in a substrate\].
When one thing combines with another to form a unity, the one does not
reside in the other; both alike are substrates of a third: thus, Man
\[the Form\] and a man \[the Composite\] are substrates of their
experiences, and are prior to their activities and consequents.

Substance, then, is that from which all other things proceed and to
which they owe their existence; it is the centre of passivity and the
source of action.
