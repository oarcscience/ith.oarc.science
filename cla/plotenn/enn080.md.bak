#### Section 6

6\. If this be so, how do we explain the teaching that evils can never
pass away but "exist of necessity," that "while evil has no place in the
divine order, it haunts mortal nature and this place for ever"?

Does this mean that heaven is clear of evil, ever moving its orderly
way, spinning on the appointed path, no injustice There or any flaw, no
wrong done by any power to any other but all true to the settled plan,
while injustice and disorder prevail on earth, designated as "the Mortal
Kind and this Place"?

Not quite so: for the precept to "flee hence" does not refer to earth
and earthly life. The flight we read of consists not in quitting earth
but in living our earth-life "with justice and piety in the light of
philosophy"; it is vice we are to flee, so that clearly to the writer
Evil is simply vice with the sequels of vice. And when the disputant in
that dialogue says that, if men could be convinced of the doctrine
advanced, there would be an end of Evil, he is answered, "That can never
be: Evil is of necessity, for there must be a contrary to good."

Still we may reasonably ask how can vice in man be a contrary to The
Good in the Supernal: for vice is the contrary to virtue and virtue is
not The Good but merely the good thing by which Matter is brought to
order.

How can there any contrary to the Absolute Good, when the absolute has
no quality?

Besides, is there any universal necessity that the existence of one of
two contraries should entail the existence of the other? Admit that the
existence of one is often accompanied by the existence of the other-
sickness and health, for example- yet there is no universal compulsion.

Perhaps, however, our author did not mean that this was universally
true; he is speaking only of The Good.

But then, if The Good is an essence, and still more, if It is that which
transcends all existence, how can It have any contrary?

That there is nothing contrary to essence is certain in the case of
particular existences- established by practical proof- but not in the
quite different case of the Universal.

But of what nature would this contrary be, the contrary to universal
existence and in general to the Primals?

To essential existence would be opposed the non-existence; to the nature
of Good, some principle and source of evil. Both these will be sources,
the one of what is good, the other of what is evil; and all within the
domain of the one principle is opposed, as contrary, to the entire
domain of the other, and this in a contrariety more violent than any
existing between secondary things.

For these last are opposed as members of one species or of one genus,
and, within that common ground, they participate in some common quality.

In the case of the Primals or Universals there is such complete
separation that what is the exact negation of one group constitutes the
very nature of the other; we have diametric contrariety if by
contrariety we mean the extreme of remoteness.

Now to the content of the divine order, the fixed quality, the
measuredness and so forth- there is opposed the content of the evil
principle, its unfixedness, measurelessness and so forth: total is
opposed to total. The existence of the one genus is a falsity,
primarily, essentially, a falseness: the other genus has
Essence-Authentic: the opposition is of truth to lie; essence is opposed
to essence.

Thus we see that it is not universally true that an Essence can have no
contrary.

In the case of fire and water we would admit contrariety if it were not
for their common element, the Matter, about which are gathered the
warmth and dryness of one and the dampness and cold of the other: if
there were only present what constitutes their distinct kinds, the
common ground being absent, there would be, here also, essence contrary
to essence.

In sum, things utterly sundered, having nothing in common, standing at
the remotest poles, are opposites in nature: the contrariety does not
depend upon quality or upon the existence of a distinct genus of beings,
but upon the utmost difference, clash in content, clash in effect.
