#### Section 22

22\. That light known, then indeed we are stirred towards those Beings
in longing and rejoicing over the radiance about them, just as earthly
love is not for the material form but for the Beauty manifested upon it.
Every one of those Beings exists for itself but becomes an object of
desire by the colour cast upon it from The Good, source of those graces
and of the love they evoke. The soul taking that outflow from the divine
is stirred; seized with a Bacchic passion, goaded by these goads, it
becomes Love. Before that, even Intellectual-Principle with all its
loveliness did not stir the soul; for that beauty is dead until it take
the light of The Good, and the soul lies supine, cold to all,
unquickened even to Intellectual-Principle there before it. But when
there enters into it a glow from the divine, it gathers strength,
awakens, spreads true wings, and however urged by its nearer environing,
speeds its buoyant way elsewhere, to something greater to its memory: so
long as there exists anything loftier than the near, its very nature
bears it upwards, lifted by the giver of that love. Beyond
Intellectual-Principle it passes but beyond The Good it cannot, for
nothing stands above That. Let it remain in Intellectual-Principle and
it sees the lovely and august, but it is not there possessed of all it
sought; the face it sees is beautiful no doubt but not of power to hold
its gaze because lacking in the radiant grace which is the bloom upon
beauty.

Even here we have to recognise that beauty is that which irradiates
symmetry rather than symmetry itself and is that which truly calls out
our love.

Why else is there more of the glory of beauty upon the living and only
some faint trace of it upon the dead, though the face yet retains all
its fulness and symmetry? Why are the most living portraits the most
beautiful, even though the others happen to be more symmetric? Why is
the living ugly more attractive than the sculptured handsome? It is that
the one is more nearly what we are looking for, and this because there
is soul there, because there is more of the Idea of The Good, because
there is some glow of the light of The Good and this illumination
awakens and lifts the soul and all that goes with it so that the whole
man is won over to goodness, and in the fullest measure stirred to life.
