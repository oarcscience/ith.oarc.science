<P>4. Another theory:

<P>The Universe is permeated by one Soul, Cause of all things and
events; every separate phenomenon as a member of a whole moves in
its place with the general movement; all the various causes spring
into action from one source: therefore, it is argued, the entire
descending claim of causes and all their interaction must follow
inevitably and so constitute a universal determination. A plant
rises from a root, and we are asked on that account to 
reason that not
only the interconnection linking the root to all the members 
and every
member to every other but the entire activity and experience of the
plant, as well, must be one organized overruling, a "destiny" of the
plant.

<P>But such an extremity of determination, a destiny so
all-pervasive, does away with the very destiny that is affirmed: it
shatters the sequence and co-operation of causes.

<P>It would be unreasonable to attribute to destiny the movement of
our limbs dictated by the mind and will: this is no case of
something outside bestowing motion while another thing accepts it
and is thus set into action; the mind itself is the prime mover.

<P>Similarly in the case of the universal system; if all that
performs act and is subject to experience constitutes one substance,
if one thing does not really produce another thing under causes
leading back continuously one to another, then it is not a truth
that all happens by causes, there is nothing but a rigid 
unity. We are
no "We": nothing is our act; our thought is not ours; our decisions
are the reasoning of something outside ourselves; we are no more
agents than our feet are kickers when we use them to kick with.

<P>No; each several thing must be a separate thing; there must be
acts and thoughts that are our own; the good and evil done by each
human being must be his own; and it is quite certain that we must
not lay any vileness to the charge of the All.
