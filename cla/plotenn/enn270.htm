<P>5. This discussion of Nature has shown us how the origin 
of things
is a Contemplation: we may now take the matter up to the higher
Soul; we find that the Contemplation pursued by this, its instinct
towards knowing and enquiring, the birth pangs set up by the 
knowledge
it attains, its teeming fullness, have caused it- in itself, all one
object of Vision- to produce another Vision [that of the Kosmos]: it
is just as a given science, complete in itself, becomes the 
source and
cause of what might be called a minor science in the student who
attains to some partial knowledge of all its divisions. But the
visible objects and the objects of intellectual contemplation of
this later creation are dim and helpless by the side of the 
content of
the Soul.

<P>The primal phase of the Soul- inhabitant of the Supreme and, by
its participation in the Supreme, filled and illuminated- remains
unchangeably There; but in virtue of that first 
participation, that of
the primal participant, a secondary phase also participates in the
Supreme, and this secondary goes forth ceaselessly as Life streaming
from Life; for energy runs through the Universe and there is no
extremity at which it dwindles out. But, travel as far as it may, it
never draws that first part of itself from the place whence the
outgoing began: if it did, it would no longer be everywhere [its
continuous Being would be broken and] it would be present at the
end, only, of its course.

<P>None the less that which goes forth cannot be equal to that
which remains.

<P>In sum, then:

<P>The Soul is to extend throughout the Universe, no spot 
void of its
energy: but, a prior is always different from its secondary, and
energy is a secondary, rising as it must from contemplation or act;
act, however, is not at this stage existent since it depends upon
contemplation: therefore the Soul, while its phases differ, must, in
all of them, remain a contemplation and what seems to be an act done
under contemplation must be in reality that weakened contemplation
of which we have spoken: the engendered must respect the Kind, but
in weaker form, dwindled in the descent.

<P>All goes softly since nothing here demands the parade of thought
or act upon external things: it is a Soul in vision and, by this
vision, creating its own subsequent- this Principle [of Nature],
itself also contemplative but in the feebler degree since it lies
further away and cannot reproduce the quality or experiences of its
prior- a Vision creates the Vision.

<P>[Such creative contemplation is not inexplicable] for no limit
exists either to contemplation or to its possible objects, and this
explains how the Soul is universal: where can this thing fail to be,
which is one identical thing in every Soul; Vision is not cabined
within the bournes of magnitude.

<P>This, of course, does not mean that the Soul is present at the
same strength in each and every place and thing- any more 
than that it
is at the same strength in each of its own phases.

<P>The Charioteer [the Leading Principle of the Soul, in 
the Phaedrus
Myth] gives the two horses [its two dissonant faculties] what he has
seen and they, taking that gift, showed that they were 
hungry for what
made that vision; there was something lacking to them: if in their
desire they acted, their action aimed at what they craved for- and
that was vision, and an object of vision.
