<P>25. There are those who lay down four categories and make a
fourfold division into Substrates, Qualities, States, and Relative
States, and find in these a common Something, and so include
everything in one genus.

<P>Against this theory there is much to be urged, but particularly
against this posing of a common Something and a single all-embracing
genus. This Something, it may be submitted, is unintelligible to
themselves, is indefinable, and does not account either for bodies
or for the bodiless. Moreover, no room is left for a differentia by
which this Something may be distinguished. Besides, this common
Something is either existent or non-existent: if existent, it must
be one or other of its [four] species;- if non-existent, the
existent is classed under the non-existent. But the objections are
countless; we must leave them for the present and consider 
the several
heads of the division.

<P>To the first genus are assigned Substrates, including Matter, to
which is given a priority over the others; so that what is ranked as
the first principle comes under the same head with things which must
be posterior to it since it is their principle.

<P>First, then: the prior is made homogeneous with the subsequent.
Now this is impossible: in this relation the subsequent owes its
existence to the prior, whereas among things belonging to one same
genus each must have, essentially, the equality implied by the
genus; for the very meaning of genus is to be predicated of the
species in respect of their essential character. And that Matter is
the basic source of all the rest of things, this school, we may
suppose, would hardly deny.

<P>Secondly: since they treat the Substrate as one thing, 
they do not
enumerate the Existents; they look instead for principles of the
Existents. There is however a difference between speaking of the
actual Existents and of their principles.

<P>If Matter is taken to be the only Existent, and all other things
as modifications of Matter, it is not legitimate to set up a single
genus to embrace both the Existent and the other things; consistency
requires that Being [Substance] be distinguished from its
modifications and that these modifications be duly classified.

<P>Even the distinction which this theory makes between Substrates
and the rest of things is questionable. The Substrate is 
[necessarily]
one thing and admits of no differentia- except perhaps in so far as
it is split up like one mass into its various parts; and yet not
even so, since the notion of Being implies continuity: it would be
better, therefore, to speak of the Substrate, in the singular.
