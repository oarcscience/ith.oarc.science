#### Section 10

10\. If all this be true, we must at once admit signification, though,
neither singly nor collectively, can we ascribe to the stars any
efficacy except in what concerns the \[material\] All and in what is of
their own function.

We must admit that the Soul before entering into birth presents itself
bearing with it something of its own, for it could never touch body
except under stress of a powerful inner impulse; we must admit some
element of chance around it from its very entry, since the moment and
conditions are determined by the kosmic circuit: and we must admit some
effective power in that circuit itself; it is co-operative, and
completes of its own act the task that belongs to the All of which
everything in the circuit takes the rank and function of a part.
