#### Section 12

12\. The pleasure demanded for the life cannot be in the enjoyments of
the licentious or in any gratifications of the body- there is no place
for these, and they stifle happiness- nor in any violent emotions- what
could so move the Sage?- it can be only such pleasure as there must be
where Good is, pleasure that does not rise from movement and is not a
thing of process, for all that is good is immediately present to the
Sage and the Sage is present to himself: his pleasure, his contentment,
stands, immovable.

Thus he is ever cheerful, the order of his life ever untroubled: his
state is fixedly happy and nothing whatever of all that is known as evil
can set it awry- given only that he is and remains a Sage.

If anyone seeks for some other kind of pleasure in the life of the Sage,
it is not the life of the Sage he is looking for.
