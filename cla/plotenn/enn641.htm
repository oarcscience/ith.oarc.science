<P>3. What then is there to prevent man having been the object of
planning There?

<P>No: all stands in that likeness, nothing to be added or taken
away; this planning and reasoning is based only on an assumption;
things are taken to be in process and this suggests planning and
reasoning; insist on the eternity of the process and 
planning falls to
the ground. There can be no planning over the eternal; that would
imply forgetfulness of a first state; further, if the second state
were better, things stood ill at first; if they stood well, so they
must remain.

<P>Only in conjunction with their causes are things good; even in
this sphere a thing is good in virtue of being complete; form means
that the thing is complete, the Matter duly controlled; this control
means that nothing has been left crude; but something is so left if
anything belonging to the shape be missing-eye, or other 
part. Thus to
state cause is to state the thing complete. Why eyes or eyebrows?
For completion: if you say "For preservation," you affirm an
indwelling safeguard of the essence, something contributory to the
being: the essence, then, preceded the safeguard and the cause was
inbound with the essence; distinct, this cause is in its 
nature a part
of the essence.

<P>All parts, thus, exist in regard to each other: the essence is
all-embracing, complete, entire; the excellency is inbound with the
cause and embraced by it; the being, the essence, the cause, all are
one.

<P>But, at this, sense-perception- even in its particular modes- is
involved in the Idea by eternal necessity, in virtue of the
completeness of the Idea; Intellectual-Principle, as all-inclusive,
contains in itself all by which we are brought, later, to recognise
this perfection in its nature; the cause, There, was one total,
all-inclusive; thus Man in the Intellectual was not purely
intellect, sense-perception being an addition made upon his 
entry into
birth: all this would seem to imply a tendance in that great 
Principle
towards the lower, towards this sphere.

<P>But how could that Principle have such perception, be aware of
things of sense? Surely it is untenable on the one hand that
sense-perception should exist There, from eternity, and on the other
that only upon the debasement of the soul should there be
sense-perception here and the accomplishment in this realm of the
Act of what was always a power in that?
