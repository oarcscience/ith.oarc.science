#### Section 1

1\. Are we to think that a being knowing itself must contain diversity,
that self-knowledge can be affirmed only when some one phase of the self
perceives other phases, and that therefore an absolutely simplex entity
would be equally incapable of introversion and of self-awareness?

No: a being that has no parts or phases may have this consciousness; in
fact there would be no real self-knowing in an entity presented as
knowing itself in virtue of being a compound- some single element in it
perceiving other elements- as we may know our own form and entire bodily
organism by sense-perception: such knowing does not cover the whole
field; the knowing element has not had the required cognisance at once
of its associates and of itself; this is not the self-knower asked for;
it is merely something that knows something else.

Either we must exhibit the self-knowing of an uncompounded being- and
show how that is possible- or abandon the belief that any being can
possess veritable self-cognition.

To abandon the belief is not possible in view of the many absurdities
thus entailed.

It would be already absurd enough to deny this power to the soul or
mind, but the very height of absurdity to deny it to the nature of the
Intellectual-Principle, presented thus as knowing the rest of things but
not attaining to knowledge, or even awareness, of itself.

It is the province of sense and in some degree of understanding and
judgement, but not of the Intellectual-Principle, to handle the
external, though whether the Intellectual-Principle holds the knowledge
of these things is a question to be examined, but it is obvious that the
Intellectual-Principle must have knowledge of the Intellectual objects.
Now, can it know those objects alone or must it not simultaneously know
itself, the being whose function it is to know just those things? Can it
have self-knowledge in the sense \[dismissed above as inadequate\] of
knowing its content while it ignores itself? Can it be aware of knowing
its members and yet remain in ignorance of its own knowing self? Self
and content must be simultaneously present: the method and degree of
this knowledge we must now consider.
