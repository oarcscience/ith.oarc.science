#### Section 1

1\. Seen from a distance, objects appear reduced and close together,
however far apart they be: within easy range, their sizes and the
distances that separate them are observed correctly.

Distant objects show in this reduction because they must be drawn
together for vision and the light must be concentrated to suit the size
of the pupil; besides, as we are placed farther and farther away from
the material mass under observation, it is more and more the bare form
that reaches us, stripped, so to speak, of magnitude as of all other
quality.

Or it may be that we appreciate the magnitude of an object by observing
the salience and recession of its several parts, so that to perceive its
true size we must have it close at hand.

Or again, it may be that magnitude is known incidentally \[as a
deduction\] from the observation of colour. With an object at hand we
know how much space is covered by the colour; at a distance, only that
something is coloured, for the parts, quantitatively distinct among
themselves, do not give us the precise knowledge of that quantity, the
colours themselves reaching us only in a blurred impression.

What wonder, then, if size be like sound- reduced when the form reaches
us but faintly- for in sound the hearing is concerned only about the
form; magnitude is not discerned except incidentally.

Well, in hearing magnitude is known incidentally; but how? Touch conveys
a direct impression of a visible object; what gives us the same direct
impression of an object of hearing?

The magnitude of a sound is known not by actual quantity but by degree
of impact, by intensity- and this in no indirect knowledge; the ear
appreciates a certain degree of force, exactly as the palate perceives
by no indirect knowledge, a certain degree of sweetness. But the true
magnitude of a sound is its extension; this the hearing may define to
itself incidentally by deduction from the degree of intensity but not to
the point of precision. The intensity is merely the definite effect at a
particular spot; the magnitude is a matter of totality, the sum of space
occupied.

Still the colours seen from a distance are faint; but they are not small
as the masses are.

True; but there is the common fact of diminution. There is colour with
its diminution, faintness; there is magnitude with its diminution,
smallness; and magnitude follows colour diminishing stage by stage with
it.

But, the phenomenon is more easily explained by the example of things of
wide variety. Take mountains dotted with houses, woods and other
land-marks; the observation of each detail gives us the means of
calculating, by the single objects noted, the total extent covered: but,
where no such detail of form reaches us, our vision, which deals with
detail, has not the means towards the knowledge of the whole by
measurement of any one clearly discerned magnitude. This applies even to
objects of vision close at hand: where there is variety and the eye
sweeps over all at one glance so that the forms are not all caught, the
total appears the less in proportion to the detail which has escaped the
eye; observe each single point and then you can estimate the volume
precisely. Again, magnitudes of one colour and unbroken form trick the
sense of quantity: the vision can no longer estimate by the particular;
it slips away, not finding the stand-by of the difference between part
and part.

It was the detail that prevented a near object deceiving our sense of
magnitude: in the case of the distant object, because the eye does not
pass stage by stage through the stretch of intervening space so as to
note its forms, therefore it cannot report the magnitude of that space.
