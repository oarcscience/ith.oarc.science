<P>10. (15) That the soul is of the family of the diviner 
nature, the
eternal, is clear from our demonstration that it is not material:
besides it has neither shape or colour nor is it tangible. But there
are other proofs.

<P>Assuming that the divine and the authentically existent
possesses a life beneficent and wise, we take the next step and
begin with working out the nature of our own soul.

<P>Let us consider a soul, not one that has appropriated the
unreasoned desires and impulses of the bodily life, or any other
such emotion and experience, but one that has cast all this 
aside, and
as far as possible has no commerce with the bodily. Such a soul
demonstrates that all evil is accretion, alien, and that in 
the purged
soul the noble things are immanent, wisdom and all else that is
good, as its native store.

<P>If this is the soul once it has returned to its self, how deny
that it is the nature we have identified with all the divine and
eternal? Wisdom and authentic virtue are divine, and could not be
found in the chattel mean and mortal: what possesses these must be
divine by its very capacity of the divine, the token of 
kinship and of
identical substance.

<P>Hence, too, any one of us that exhibits these qualities will
differ but little as far as soul is concerned from the Supernals; he
will be less than they only to the extent in which the soul is, in
him, associated with body.

<P>This is so true that, if every human being were at that stage,
or if a great number lived by a soul of that degree, no one would be
so incredulous as to doubt that the soul in man is immortal. It is
because we see everywhere the spoiled souls of the great mass that
it becomes difficult to recognize their divinity and immortality.

<P>To know the nature of a thing we must observe it in its
unalloyed state, since any addition obscures the reality. Clear,
then look: or, rather, let a man first purify himself and then
observe: he will not doubt his immortality when he sees himself thus
entered into the pure, the Intellectual. For, what he sees is an
Intellectual-Principle looking on nothing of sense, nothing of this
mortality, but by its own eternity having intellection of 
the eternal:
he will see all things in this Intellectual substance, himself
having become an Intellectual Kosmos and all lightsome, 
illuminated by
the truth streaming from The Good, which radiates truth upon all
that stands within that realm of the divine.

<P>Thus he will often feel the beauty of that word 
"Farewell: I am to
you an immortal God," for he has ascended to the Supreme, and is all
one strain to enter into likeness with it.

<P>If the purification puts the human into knowledge of the
highest, then, too, the science latent within becomes manifest, the
only authentic knowing. For it is not by running hither and thither
outside of itself that the soul understands morality and right
conduct: it learns them of its own nature, in its contact 
with itself,
in its intellectual grasp of itself, seeing deeply impressed upon it
the images of its primal state; what was one mass of rust from long
neglect it has restored to purity.

<P>Imagine living gold: it files away all that is earthy about it,
all that kept it in self-ignorance preventing it from knowing itself
as gold; seen now unalloyed it is at once filled with admiration of
its worth and knows that it has no need of any other glory than its
own, triumphant if only it be allowed to remain purely to itself.
