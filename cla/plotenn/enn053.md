#### Section 4

4\. Still the one life has known pleasure longer than the other?

But pleasure cannot be fairly reckoned in with Happiness- unless indeed
by pleasure is meant the unhindered Act \[of the true man\], in which
case this pleasure is simply our "Happiness." And even pleasure, though
it exist continuously, has never anything but the present; its past is
over and done with.
