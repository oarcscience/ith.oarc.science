<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 14</H4>

<P>14. There is, thus, a Nature comprehending in the 
Intellectual all
that exists, and this Principle must be the source of all. But how,
seeing that the veritable source must be a unity, simplex utterly?

<P>The mode by which from the unity arises the multiple, 
how all this
universe comes to be, why the Intellectual-Principle is all 
and whence
it springs, these matters demand another approach.

<P>But on the question as to whether the repulsive and the products
of putridity have also their Idea- whether there is an Idea of filth
and mud- it is to be observed that all that the 
Intellectual-Principle
derived from The First is of the noblest; in those Ideas the base is
not included: these repulsive things point not to the
Intellectual-Principle but to the Soul which, drawing upon the
Intellectual-Principle, takes from Matter certain other things, and
among them these.

<P>But all this will be more clearly brought out, when we 
turn to the
problem of the production of multiplicity from unity. Compounds, we
shall see- as owing existence to hazard and not to the
Intellectual-Principle, having been fused into objects of sense by
their own impulse- are not to be included under Ideas.

<P>The products of putrefaction are to be traced to the Soul's
inability to bring some other thing to being- something in the order
of nature, which, else, it would- but producing where it may. In the
matter of the arts and crafts, all that are to be traced to the
needs of human nature are laid up in the Absolute Man.

<P>And before the particular Soul there is another Soul, a 
universal,
and, before that, an Absolute-Soul, which is the Life existing in
the Intellectual-Principle before Soul came to be and therefore
rightly called [as the Life in the Divine] the Absolute-Soul.
