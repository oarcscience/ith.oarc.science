#### Section 12

12\. It should however be added that if the Idea of man exists in the
Supreme, there must exist the Idea of reasoning man and of man with his
arts and crafts; such arts as are the offspring of intellect Must be
There.

It must be observed that the Ideas will be of universals; not of
Socrates but of Man: though as to man we may enquire whether the
individual may not also have place There. Under the heading of
individuality there is to be considered the repetition of the same
feature from man to man, the simian type, for example, and the aquiline:
the aquiline and the simian must be taken to be differences in the Idea
of Man as there are different types of the animal: but Matter also has
its effect in bringing about the degree of aquilinity. Similarly with
difference of complexion, determined partly by the Reason-Principle,
partly by Matter and by diversity of place.
