#### Section 17

17\. We may be told that neither Act nor Motion requires a genus for
itself, but that both revert to Relation, Act belonging to the
potentially active, Motion to the potentially motive. Our reply is that
Relation produces relatives as such, and not the mere reference to an
external standard; given the existence of a thing, whether attributive
or relative, it holds its essential character prior to any relationship:
so then must Act and Motion, and even such an attribute as habit; they
are not prevented from being prior to any relationship they may occupy,
or from being conceivable in themselves. Otherwise, everything will be
relative; for anything you think of- even Soul- bears some relationship
to something else.

But, to return to activity proper and the action, is there any reason
why these should be referred to Relation? They must in every instance be
either Motion or Act.

If however activity is referred to Relation and the action made a
distinct genus, why is not Motion referred to Relation and the movement
made a distinct genus? Why not bisect the unity, Motion, and so make
Action and Passion two species of the one thing, ceasing to consider
Action and Passion as two genera?
