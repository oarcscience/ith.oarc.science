#### Section 1

1\. What is our answer?

All events and things, good and evil alike, are included under the
Universal Reason-Principle of which they are parts- strictly "included"
for this Universal Idea does not engender them but encompasses them.

The Reason-Principles are acts or expressions of a Universal Soul; its
parts \[i.e., events good and evil\] are expressions of these Soulparts.

This unity, Soul, has different parts; the Reason-Principles,
correspondingly, will also have their parts, and so, too, will the
ultimates of the system, all that they bring into being.

The Souls are in harmony with each other and so, too, are their acts and
effects; but it is harmony in the sense of a resultant unity built out
of contraries. All things, as they rise from a unity, come back to unity
by a sheer need of nature; differences unfold themselves, contraries are
produced, but all is drawn into one organized system by the unity at the
source.

The principle may be illustrated from the different classes of animal
life: there is one genus, horse, though horses among themselves fight
and bite and show malice and angry envy: so all the others within the
unity of their Kind; and so humanity.

All these types, again, can be ranged under the one Kind, that of living
things; objects without life can be thought of under their specific
types and then be resumed under the one Kind of the "non-living"; if we
choose to go further yet, living and non-living may be included under
the one Kind, "Beings," and, further still, under the Source of Being.

Having attached all to this source, we turn to move down again in
continuous division: we see the Unity fissuring, as it reaches out into
Universality, and yet embracing all in one system so that with all its
differentiation it is one multiple living thing- an organism in which
each member executes the function of its own nature while it still has
its being in that One Whole; fire burns; horse does horse work; men
give, each the appropriate act of the peculiar personal quality- and
upon the several particular Kinds to which each belongs follow the acts,
and the good or evil of the life.
