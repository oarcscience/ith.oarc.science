#### Section 15

15\. But there is a difficulty affecting this entire settlement:
Eternity is characteristic of the Intellectual-Principle, time of the
soul- for we hold that time has its substantial being in the activity of
the soul, and springs from soul- and, since time is a thing of division
and comports a past, it would seem that the activity producing it must
also be a thing of division, and that its attention to that past must
imply that even the All-Soul has memory? We repeat, identity belongs to
the eternal, time must be the medium of diversity; otherwise there is
nothing to distinguish them, especially since we deny that the
activities of the soul can themselves experience change.

Can we escape by the theory that, while human souls- receptive of
change, even to the change of imperfection and lack- are in time, yet
the Soul of the All, as the author of time, is itself timeless? But if
it is not in time, what causes it to engender time rather than eternity?

The answer must be that the realm it engenders is not that of eternal
things but a realm of things enveloped in time: it is just as the souls
\[under, or included in, the All-Soul\] are not in time, but some of
their experiences and productions are. For a soul is eternal, and is
before time; and what is in time is of a lower order than time itself:
time is folded around what is in time exactly as- we read- it is folded
about what is in place and in number.
