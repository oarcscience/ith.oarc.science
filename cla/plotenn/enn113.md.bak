#### Section 11

11\. And we must remember that what comes from the supernals does not
enter into the recipients as it left the source; fire, for instance,
will be duller; the loving instinct will degenerate and issue in ugly
forms of the passion; the vital energy in a subject not so balanced as
to display the mean of manly courage, will come out as either ferocity
or faint-heartedness; and ambition... in love...; and the instinct
towards good sets up the pursuit of semblant beauty; intellectual power
at its lowest produces the extreme of wickedness, for wickedness is a
miscalculating effort towards Intelligence.

Any such quality, modified at best from its supreme form, deteriorates
again within itself: things of any kind that approach from above,
altered by merely leaving their source change further still by their
blending with bodies, with Matter, with each other.
