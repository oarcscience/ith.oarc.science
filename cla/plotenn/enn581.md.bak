#### Section 21

21\. The claim of Motion to be established as a genus will depend upon
three conditions: first, that it cannot rightly be referred to any other
genus; second, that nothing higher than itself can be predicated of it
in respect of its essence; third, that by assuming differences it will
produce species. These conditions satisfied, we may consider the nature
of the genus to which we shall refer it.

Clearly it cannot be identified with either the Substance or the Quality
of the things which possess it. It cannot, further, be consigned to
Action, for Passivity also comprises a variety of motions; nor again to
Passivity itself, because many motions are actions: on the contrary,
actions and passions are to be referred to Motion.

Furthermore, it cannot lay claim to the category of Relation on the mere
ground that it has an attributive and not a self-centred existence: on
this ground, Quality too would find itself in that same category; for
Quality is an attribute and contained in an external: and the same is
true of Quantity.

If we are agreed that Quality and Quantity, though attributive, are real
entities, and on the basis of this reality distinguishable as Quality
and Quantity respectively: then, on the same principle, since Motion,
though an attribute has a reality prior to its attribution, it is
incumbent upon us to discover the intrinsic nature of this reality. We
must never be content to regard as a relative something which exists
prior to its attribution, but only that which is engendered by Relation
and has no existence apart from the relation to which it owes its name:
the double, strictly so called, takes birth and actuality in
juxtaposition with a yard's length, and by this very process of being
juxtaposed with a correlative acquires the name and exhibits the fact of
being double.

What, then, is that entity, called Motion, which, though attributive,
has an independent reality, which makes its attribution possible- the
entity corresponding to Quality, Quantity and Substance?

But first, perhaps, we should make sure that there is nothing prior to
Motion and predicated of it as its genus.

Change may be suggested as a prior. But, in the first place, either it
is identical with Motion, or else, if change be claimed as a genus, it
will stand distinct from the genera so far considered: secondly, Motion
will evidently take rank as a species and have some other species
opposed to it- becoming, say- which will be regarded as a change but not
as a motion.

What, then, is the ground for denying that becoming is a motion? The
fact, perhaps, that what comes to be does not yet exist, whereas Motion
has no dealings with the non-existent. But, on that ground, becoming
will not be a change either. If however it be alleged that becoming is
merely a type of alteration or growth since it takes place when things
alter and grow, the antecedents of becoming are being confused with
becoming itself. Yet becoming, entailing as it does these antecedents,
must necessarily be a distinct species; for the event and process of
becoming cannot be identified with merely passive alteration, like
turning hot or white: it is possible for the antecedents to take place
without becoming as such being accomplished, except in so far as the
actual alteration \[implied in the antecedents\] has "come to be";
where, however, an animal or a vegetal life is concerned, becoming \[or
birth\] takes place only upon its acquisition of a Form.

The contrary might be maintained: that change is more plausibly ranked
as a species than is Motion, because change signifies merely the
substitution of one thing for another, whereas Motion involves also the
removal of a thing from the place to which it belongs, as is shown by
locomotion. Even rejecting this distinction, we must accept as types of
Motion knowledge and musical performance- in short, changes of
condition: thus, alteration will come to be regarded as a species of
Motion- namely, motion displacing.
