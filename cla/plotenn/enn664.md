#### Section 26

26\. Any conscious being, if the good come to him, will know the good
and affirm his possession of it.

But what if one be deceived?

In that case there must be some resemblance to account for the error:
the good will be the original which the delusion counterfeited and
whenever the true presents itself we turn from the spurious.

All the striving, all the pain, show that to everything something is a
good: the lifeless finds its share in something outside itself; where
there is life the longing for good sets up pursuit; the very dead are
cared for and mourned for by the living; the living plan for their own
good. The witness of attainment is betterment, cleaving to state,
satisfaction, settlement, suspension of pursuit. Here pleasure shows
itself inadequate; its choice does not hold; repeated, it is no longer
the same; it demands endless novelty. The good, worthy of the name, can
be no such tasting of the casual; anyone that takes this kind of thing
for the good goes empty, carrying away nothing but an emotion which the
good might have produced. No one could be content to take his pleasure
thus in an emotion over a thing not possessed any more than over a child
not there; I cannot think that those setting their good in bodily
satisfactions find table-pleasure without the meal, or love-pleasure
without intercourse with their chosen, or any pleasure where nothing is
done.
