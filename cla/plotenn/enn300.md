#### Section 14

14\. Thus it comes about that this kosmos, lit with many lights,
gleaming in its souls, receives still further graces, gifts from here
and from there, from the gods of the Supreme, and from those other
Intellectual-Principles whose nature it is to ensoul. This is probably
the secret of the myth in which, after Prometheus had moulded woman, the
other gods heaped gifts upon her, Hephaistos "blending the clay with
moisture and bestowing the human voice and the form of a goddess";
Aphrodite bringing her gifts, and the Graces theirs, and other gods
other gifts, and finally calling her by the name \[Pandora\] which tells
of gift and of all giving- for all have added something to this
formation brought to being by a Promethean, a fore-thinking power. As
for the rejection of Prometheus' gift by after-thought, Epimetheus, what
can this signify but that the wiser choice is to remain in the
Intellectual realm? Pandora's creator is fettered, to signify that he is
in some sense held by his own creation; such a fettering is external and
the release by Hercules tells that there is power in Prometheus, so that
he need not remain in bonds.

Take the myth as we may, it is certainly such an account of the bestowal
of gifts upon the kosmos as harmonizes with our explanation of the
universal system.
