#### Section 9

9\. We admit, then, a Necessity in all that is brought about by this
compromise between evil and accidental circumstance: what room was there
for anything else than the thing that is? Given all the causes, all must
happen beyond aye or nay- that is, all the external and whatever may be
due to the sidereal circuit- therefore when the Soul has been modified
by outer forces and acts under that pressure so that what it does is no
more than an unreflecting acceptance of stimulus, neither the act nor
the state can be described as voluntary: so, too, when even from within
itself, it falls at times below its best and ignores the true, the
highest, laws of action.

But when our Soul holds to its Reason-Principle, to the guide, pure and
detached and native to itself, only then can we speak of personal
operation, of voluntary act. Things so done may truly be described as
our doing, for they have no other source; they are the issue of the
unmingled Soul, a Principle that is a First, a leader, a sovereign not
subject to the errors of ignorance, not to be overthrown by the tyranny
of the desires which, where they can break in, drive and drag, so as to
allow of no act of ours, but mere answer to stimulus.
