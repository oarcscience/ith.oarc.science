#### Section 13

13\. Further, they must explain in what sense they hold that Matter
tends to slip away from its form \[the Idea\]. Can we conceive it
stealing out from stones and rocks or whatever else envelops it?

And of course they cannot pretend that Matter in some cases rebels and
sometimes not. For if once it makes away of its own will, why should it
not always escape? If it is fixed despite itself, it must be enveloped
by some Ideal-Form for good and all. This, however, leaves still the
question why a given portion of Matter does not remain constant to any
one given form: the reason lies mainly in the fact that the Ideas are
constantly passing into it.

In what sense, then, is it said to elude form?

By very nature and for ever?

But does not this precisely mean that it never ceases to be itself, in
other words that its one form is an invincible formlessness? In no other
sense has Plato's dictum any value to those that invoke it.

Matter \[we read\] is "the receptacle and nurse of all generation."

Now if Matter is such a receptacle and nurse, all generation is distinct
from it; and since all the changeable lies in the realm of generation,
Matter, existing before all generation, must exist before all change.

"Receptacle" and "nurse"; then it "retains its identity; it is not
subject to modification. Similarly if it is" \[as again we read\] "the
ground on which individual things appear and disappear," and so, too, if
it is a "place, a base." Where Plato describes and identifies it as "a
ground to the ideas" he is not attributing any state to it; he is
probing after its distinctive manner of being.

And what is that?

This which we think of as a Nature-Kind cannot be included among
Existents but must utterly rebel from the Essence of Real Beings and be
therefore wholly something other than they- for they are
Reason-Principles and possess Authentic Existence- it must inevitably,
by virtue of that difference, retain its integrity to the point of being
permanently closed against them and, more, of rejecting close
participation in any image of them.

Only on these terms can it be completely different: once it took any
Idea to hearth and home, it would become a new thing, for it would cease
to be the thing apart, the ground of all else, the receptacle of
absolutely any and every form. If there is to be a ceaseless coming into
it and going out from it, itself must be unmoved and immune in all the
come and go. The entrant Idea will enter as an image, the untrue
entering the untruth.

But, at least, in a true entry?

No: How could there be a true entry into that which, by being falsity,
is banned from ever touching truth?

Is this then a pseudo-entry into a pseudo-entity- something merely
brought near, as faces enter the mirror, there to remain just as long as
the people look into it?

Yes: if we eliminated the Authentic Existents from this Sphere nothing
of all now seen in sense would appear one moment longer.

Here the mirror itself is seen, for it is itself an Ideal-Form of a Kind
\[has some degree of Real Being\]; but bare Matter, which is no Idea, is
not a visible thing; if it were, it would have been visible in its own
character before anything else appeared upon it. The condition of Matter
may be illustrated by that of air penetrated by light and remaining,
even so, unseen because it is invisible whatever happens.

The reflections in the mirror are not taken to be real, all the less
since the appliance on which they appear is seen and remains while the
images disappear, but Matter is not seen either with the images or
without them. But suppose the reflections on the mirror remaining and
the mirror itself not seen, we would never doubt the solid reality of
all that appears.

If, then, there is, really, something in a mirror, we may suppose
objects of sense to be in Matter in precisely that way: if in the mirror
there is nothing, if there is only a seeming of something, then we may
judge that in Matter there is the same delusion and that the seeming is
to be traced to the Substantial-Existence of the Real-Beings, that
Substantial-Existence in which the Authentic has the real participation
while only an unreal participation can belong to the unauthentic since
their condition must differ from that which they would know if the parts
were reversed, if the Authentic Existents were not and they were.
