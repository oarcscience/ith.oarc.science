<P>14. Of the corporeal thus brought into being by Nature the
elemental materials of things are its very produce, but how do
animal and vegetable forms stand to it?

<P>Are we to think of them as containers of Nature present within
them?

<P>Light goes away and the air contains no trace of it, for 
light and
air remain each itself, never coalescing: is this the relation of
Nature to the formed object?

<P>It is rather that existing between fire and the object it has
warmed: the fire withdrawn, there remains a certain warmth, distinct
from that in the fire, a property, so to speak, of the object
warmed. For the shape which Nature imparts to what it has 
moulded must
be recognized as a form quite distinct from Nature itself, though it
remains a question to be examined whether besides this 
[specific] form
there is also an intermediary, a link connecting it with Nature, the
general principle.

<P>The difference between Nature and the Wisdom described 
as dwelling
in the All has been sufficiently dealt with.
