#### Section 16

16\. We have, of course, already seen that a secondary must follow upon
the First, and that this is a power immeasurably fruitful; and we
indicated that this truth is confirmed by the entire order of things
since there is nothing, not even in the lowest ranks, void of the power
of generating. We have now to add that, since things engendered tend
downwards and not upwards and, especially, move towards multiplicity,
the first principle of all must be less a manifold than any.

That which engenders the world of sense cannot itself be a sense-world;
it must be the Intellect and the Intellectual world; similarly, the
prior which engenders the Intellectual-Principle and the Intellectual
world cannot be either, but must be something of less multiplicity. The
manifold does not rise from the manifold: the intellectual multiplicity
has its source in what is not manifold; by the mere fact of being
manifold, the thing is not the first principle: we must look to
something earlier.

All must be grouped under a unity which, as standing outside of all
multiplicity and outside of any ordinary simplicity, is the veritably
and essentially simplex.

Still, how can a Reason-Principle \[the Intellectual\],
characteristically a manifold, a total, derive from what is obviously no
Reason-Principle?

But how, failing such origin in the simplex, could we escape \[what
cannot be accepted\] the derivation of a Reason-Principle from a
Reason-Principle?

And how does the secondarily good \[the imaged Good\] derive from The
Good, the Absolute? What does it hold from the Absolute Good to entitle
it to the name?

Similarity to the prior is not enough, it does not help towards
goodness; we demand similarity only to an actually existent Good: the
goodness must depend upon derivation from a Prior of such a nature that
the similarity is desirable because that Prior is good, just as the
similarity would be undesirable if the Prior were not good.

Does the similarity with the Prior consist, then, in a voluntary resting
upon it?

It is rather that, finding its condition satisfying, it seeks nothing:
the similarity depends upon the all-sufficiency of what it possesses;
its existence is agreeable because all is present to it, and present in
such a way as not to be even different from it \[Intellectual-Principle
is Being\].

All life belongs to it, life brilliant and perfect; thus all in it is at
once life-principle and Intellectual-Principle, nothing in it aloof from
either life or intellect: it is therefore self-sufficing and seeks
nothing: and if it seeks nothing this is because it has in itself what,
lacking, it must seek. It has, therefore, its Good within itself, either
by being of that order- in what we have called its life and intellect-
or in some other quality or character going to produce these.

If this \[secondary principle\] were The Good \[The Absolute\], nothing
could transcend these things, life and intellect: but, given the
existence of something higher, this Intellectual-Principle must possess
a life directed towards that Transcendent, dependent upon it, deriving
its being from it, living towards it as towards its source. The First,
then, must transcend this principle of life and intellect which directs
thither both the life in itself, a copy of the Reality of the First, and
the intellect in itself which is again a copy, though of what original
there we cannot know.
