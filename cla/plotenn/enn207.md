#### Section 2

2\. Circumstances are not sovereign over the good of life, for they are
themselves moulded by their priors and come in as members of a sequence.
The Leading-Principle holds all the threads while the minor agents, the
individuals, serve according to their own capacities, as in a war the
generalissimo lays down the plan and his subordinates do their best to
its furtherance. The Universe has been ordered by a Providence that may
be compared to a general; he has considered operations, conditions and
such practical needs as food and drink, arms and engines of war; all the
problem of reconciling these complex elements has been worked out
beforehand so as to make it probable that the final event may be
success. The entire scheme emerges from the general's mind with a
certain plausible promise, though it cannot cover the enemy's
operations, and there is no power over the disposition of the enemy's
forces: but where the mighty general is in question whose power extends
over all that is, what can pass unordered, what can fail to fit into the
plan?
