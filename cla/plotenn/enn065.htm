<P>5. These Lovers, then, lovers of the beauty outside of 
sense, must
be made to declare themselves.

<P>What do you feel in presence of the grace you discern in
actions, in manners, in sound morality, in all the works and 
fruits of
virtue, in the beauty of souls? When you see that you yourselves are
beautiful within, what do you feel? What is this Dionysiac
exultation that thrills through your being, this straining upwards
of all your Soul, this longing to break away from the body and live
sunken within the veritable self?

<P>These are no other than the emotions of Souls under the spell of
love.

<P>But what is it that awakens all this passion? No shape, 
no colour,
no grandeur of mass: all is for a Soul, something whose beauty rests
upon no colour, for the moral wisdom the Soul enshrines and all the
other hueless splendour of the virtues. It is that you find in
yourself, or admire in another, loftiness of spirit; righteousness
of life; disciplined purity; courage of the majestic face; gravity;
modesty that goes fearless and tranquil and passionless; and,
shining down upon all, the light of god-like Intellection.

<P>All these noble qualities are to be reverenced and loved, no
doubt, but what entitles them to be called beautiful?

<P>They exist: they manifest themselves to us: anyone that sees
them must admit that they have reality of Being; and is not
Real-Being, really beautiful?

<P>But we have not yet shown by what property in them they have
wrought the Soul to loveliness: what is this grace, this splendour
as of Light, resting upon all the virtues?

<P>Let us take the contrary, the ugliness of the Soul, and set that
against its beauty: to understand, at once, what this ugliness is
and how it comes to appear in the Soul will certainly open our way
before us.

<P>Let us then suppose an ugly Soul, dissolute, unrighteous:
teeming with all the lusts; torn by internal discord; beset by the
fears of its cowardice and the envies of its pettiness; thinking, in
the little thought it has, only of the perish able and the base;
perverse in all its the friend of unclean pleasures; living the life
of abandonment to bodily sensation and delighting in its deformity.

<P>What must we think but that all this shame is something that has
gathered about the Soul, some foreign bane outraging it, soiling it,
so that, encumbered with all manner of turpitude, it has no longer a
clean activity or a clean sensation, but commands only a life
smouldering dully under the crust of evil; that, sunk in manifold
death, it no longer sees what a Soul should see, may no 
longer rest in
its own being, dragged ever as it is towards the outer, the 
lower, the
dark?

<P>An unclean thing, I dare to say; flickering hither and thither
at the call of objects of sense, deeply infected with the taint of
body, occupied always in Matter, and absorbing Matter into itself;
in its commerce with the Ignoble it has trafficked away for an alien
nature its own essential Idea.

<P>If a man has been immersed in filth or daubed with mud his
native comeliness disappears and all that is seen is the foul stuff
besmearing him: his ugly condition is due to alien matter that has
encrusted him, and if he is to win back his grace it must be his
business to scour and purify himself and make himself what he was.

<P>So, we may justly say, a Soul becomes ugly- by something foisted
upon it, by sinking itself into the alien, by a fall, a descent into
body, into Matter. The dishonour of the Soul is in its ceasing to be
clean and apart. Gold is degraded when it is mixed with earthy
particles; if these be worked out, the gold is left and is
beautiful, isolated from all that is foreign, gold with gold alone.
And so the Soul; let it be but cleared of the desires that 
come by its
too intimate converse with the body, emancipated from all the
passions, purged of all that embodiment has thrust upon it, 
withdrawn,
a solitary, to itself again- in that moment the ugliness that came
only from the alien is stripped away.
