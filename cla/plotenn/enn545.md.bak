#### Section 8

8\. We cannot indeed escape positing these three, Being, Motion,
Stability, once it is the fact that the Intellect discerns them as
separates; and if it thinks of them at all, it posits them by that very
thinking; if they are thought, they exist. Things whose existence is
bound up with Matter have no being in the Intellect: these three
principles are however free of Matter; and in that which goes free of
Matter to be thought is to be.

We are in the presence of Intellect undefiled. Fix it firmly, but not
with the eyes of the body. You are looking upon the hearth of Reality,
within it a sleepless light: you see how it holds to itself, and how it
puts apart things that were together, how it lives a life that endures
and keeps a thought acting not upon any future but upon that which
already is, upon an eternal present- a thought self-centred, bearing on
nothing outside of itself.

Now in the Act of Intellect there are energy and motion; in its
self-intellection Substance and Being. In virtue of its Being it thinks,
and it thinks of itself as Being, and of that as Being, upon which it
is, so to speak, pivoted. Not that its Act self-directed ranks as
Substance, but Being stands as the goal and origin of that Act, the
object of its contemplation though not the contemplation itself: and yet
this Act too involves Being, which is its motive and its term. By the
fact that its Being is actual and not merely potential, Intellect
bridges the dualism \[of agent and patient\] and abjures separation: it
identifies itself with Being and Being with itself.

Being, the most firmly set of all things, that in virtue of which all
other things receive Stability, possesses this Stability not as from
without but as springing within, as inherent. Stability is the goal of
intellection, a Stability which had no beginning, and the state from
which intellection was impelled was Stability, though Stability gave it
no impulsion; for Motion neither starts from Motion nor ends in Motion.
Again, the Form-Idea has Stability, since it is the goal of Intellect:
intellection is the Form's Motion.

Thus all the Existents are one, at once Motion and Stability; Motion and
Stability are genera all-pervading, and every subsequent is a particular
being, a particular stability and a particular motion.

We have caught the radiance of Being, and beheld it in its three
manifestations: Being, revealed by the Being within ourselves; the
Motion of Being, revealed by the motion within ourselves; and its
Stability revealed by ours. We accommodate our being, motion, stability
to those \[of the Archetypal\], unable however to draw any distinction
but finding ourselves in the presence of entities inseparable and, as it
were, interfused. We have, however, in a sense, set them a little apart,
holding them down and viewing them in isolation; and thus we have
observed Being, Stability, Motion- these three, of which each is a unity
to itself; in so doing, have we not regarded them as being different
from each other? By this posing of three entities, each a unity, we
have, surely, found Being to contain Difference.

Again, inasmuch as we restore them to an all-embracing unity,
identifying all with unity, do we not see in this amalgamation Identity
emerging as a Real Existent?

Thus, in addition to the other three \[Being, Motion, Stability\], we
are obliged to posit the further two, Identity and Difference, so that
we have in all five genera. In so doing, we shall not withhold Identity
and Difference from the subsequents of the Intellectual order; the thing
of Sense has, it is clear, a particular identity and a particular
difference, but Identity and Difference have the generic status
independently of the particular.

They will, moreover, be primary genera, because nothing can be
predicated of them as denoting their essential nature. Nothing, of
course we mean, but Being; but this Being is not their genus, since they
cannot be identified with any particular being as such. Similarly, Being
will not stand as genus to Motion or Stability, for these also are not
its species. Beings \[or Existents\] comprise not merely what are to be
regarded as species of the genus Being, but also participants in Being.
On the other hand, Being does not participate in the other four
principles as its genera: they are not prior to Being; they do not even
attain to its level.
