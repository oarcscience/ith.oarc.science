<P>25. Now comes the question, equally calling for an 
answer, whether
those souls that have quitted the places of earth retain memory of
their lives- all souls or some, of all things, or of some 
things, and,
again, for ever or merely for some period not very long after their
withdrawal.

<P>A true investigation of this matter requires us to 
establish first
what a remembering principle must be- I do not mean what memory is,
but in what order of beings it can occur. The nature of memory has
been indicated, laboured even, elsewhere; we still must try to
understand more clearly what characteristics are present where
memory exists.

<P>Now a memory has to do with something brought into ken from
without, something learned or something experienced; the
Memory-Principle, therefore, cannot belong to such beings as are
immune from experience and from time.

<P>No memory, therefore, can be ascribed to any divine being, or to
the Authentic-Existent or the Intellectual-Principle: these are
intangibly immune; time does not approach them; they possess
eternity centred around Being; they know nothing of past and
sequent; all is an unbroken state of identity, not receptive of
change. Now a being rooted in unchanging identity cannot entertain
memory, since it has not and never had a state differing from any
previous state, or any new intellection following upon a former one,
so as to be aware of contrast between a present perception and one
remembered from before.

<P>But what prevents such a being [from possessing memory in the
sense of] perceiving, without variation in itself, such outside
changes as, for example, the kosmic periods?

<P>Simply the fact that following the changes of the 
revolving kosmos
it would have perception of earlier and later: intuition and memory
are distinct.

<P>We cannot hold its self-intellections to be acts of memory; this
is no question of something entering from without, to be grasped and
held in fear of an escape; if its intellections could slip away from
it [as a memory might] its very Essence [as the Hypostasis 
of inherent
Intellection] would be in peril.

<P>For the same reason memory, in the current sense, cannot be
attributed to the soul in connection with the ideas inherent in its
essence: these it holds not as a memory but as a possession, though,
by its very entrance into this sphere, they are no longer 
the mainstay
of its Act.

<P>The Soul-action which is to be observed seems to have induced
the Ancients to ascribe memory, and "Recollection," [the Platonic
Anamnesis] to souls bringing into outward manifestation the 
ideas they
contain: we see at once that the memory here indicated is another
kind; it is a memory outside of time.

<P>But, perhaps, this is treating too summarily a matter which
demands minute investigation. It might be doubted whether that
recollection, that memory, really belongs to the highest soul and
not rather to another, a dimmer, or even to the Couplement, the
Living-Being. And if to that dimmer soul, when and how has it come
to be present; if to the Couplement, again when and how?

<P>We are driven thus to enquire into these several points: in
which of the constituents of our nature is memory vested- 
the question
with which we started- if in the soul, then in what power or part;
if in the Animate or Couplement- which has been supposed, 
similarly to
be the seat of sensation- then by what mode it is present, and how
we are to define the Couplement; finally whether sensation and
intellectual acts may be ascribed to one and the same agent, or
imply two distinct principles.
