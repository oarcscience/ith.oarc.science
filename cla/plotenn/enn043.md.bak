#### Section 11

11\. We shall perhaps be told that in such a state the man is no longer
alive: we answer that these people show themselves equally unable to
understand his inner life and his happiness.

If this does not satisfy them, we must ask them to keep in mind a living
Sage and, under these terms, to enquire whether the man is in happiness:
they must not whittle away his life and then ask whether he has the
happy life; they must not take away man and then look for the happiness
of a man: once they allow that the Sage lives within, they must not seek
him among the outer activities, still less look to the outer world for
the object of his desires. To consider the outer world to be a field to
his desire, to fancy the Sage desiring any good external, would be to
deny Substantial-Existence to happiness; for the Sage would like to see
all men prosperous and no evil befalling anyone; but though it prove
otherwise, he is still content.

If it be admitted that such a desire would be against reason, since evil
cannot cease to be, there is no escape from agreeing with us that the
Sage's will is set always and only inward.
