#### Section 14

14\. (19) As for the souls of the other living beings, fallen to the
degree of entering brute bodies, these too must be immortal. And if
there is in the animal world any other phase of soul, its only possible
origin, since it is the life-giver, is, still, that one principle of
life: so too with the soul in the vegetal order.

All have sprung from one source, all have life as their own, all are
incorporeal, indivisible, all are real-beings.

If we are told that man's soul being tripartite must as a compound
entity be dissolved, our answer shall be that pure souls upon their
emancipation will put away all that has fastened to them at birth, all
that increment which the others will long retain.

But even that inferior phase thus laid aside will not be destroyed as
long as its source continues to exist, for nothing from the realm of
real being shall pass away.
