<P>4. Does each individual Soul, then, contain within itself such a
Love in essence and substantial reality?

<P>Since not only the pure All-Soul but also that of the Universe
contain such a Love, it would be difficult to explain why 
our personal
Soul should not. It must be so, even, with all that has life.

<P>This indwelling love is no other than the Spirit which, as we
are told, walks with every being, the affection dominant in each
several nature. It implants the characteristic desire; the
particular Soul, strained towards its own natural objects, brings
forth its own Eros, the guiding spirit realizing its worth and the
quality of its Being.

<P>As the All-Soul contains the Universal Love, so must the single
Soul be allowed its own single Love: and as closely as the 
single Soul
holds to the All-Soul, never cut off but embraced within it, the two
together constituting one principle of life, so the single separate
Love holds to the All-Love. Similarly, the individual love keeps
with the individual Soul as that other, the great Love, goes with
the All-Soul; and the Love within the All permeates it throughout so
that the one Love becomes many, showing itself where it 
chooses at any
moment of the Universe, taking definite shape in these its partial
phases and revealing itself at its will.

<P>In the same way we must conceive many Aphrodites in the All,
Spirits entering it together with Love, all emanating from an
Aphrodite of the All, a train of particular Aphrodites dependent
upon the first, and each with the particular Love in attendance:
this multiplicity cannot be denied, if Soul be the mother of 
Love, and
Aphrodite mean Soul, and Love be an act of a Soul seeking good.

<P>This Love, then, leader of particular Souls to The Good, is
twofold: the Love in the loftier Soul would be a god ever linking
the Soul to the divine; the Love in the mingling Soul will be a
celestial spirit.
