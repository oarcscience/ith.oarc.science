<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 9</H4>

<P>9. It remains then to consider whether Being by its distinction
produced Number or Number produced that distinction. It is certain
that either Number was the cause of Being, movement, rest, identity
and difference, or these the cause of Number.

<P>The first question is whether Number can exist in and of 
itself or
is dependent upon things- Two being something observed in two
things, Three in three; and so of the arithmetical One, for if this
could exist apart from numbered objects it could exist also 
before the
divisions of Being.

<P>But could it precede Being itself?

<P>For the present we must take it that Being precedes 
Number, is its
source. But if One means one being and the duality two beings, then
unity precedes Being, and Number precedes the Beings.

<P>Mentally, to our approach? Yes: and in reality of existence as
well.

<P>Let us consider: When we think of the existence and the fine
appearance of a man as forming one thing, that unity is certainly
thought of as subsequent to a precedent duality; when we 
group a horse
with a dog, the duality is obviously the subsequent. But 
think of that
which brings man or horse or dog into being or produces them, with
full intention, from where they lie latent within itself: 
the producer
must say "I begin with a first, I pass on to a second; that 
makes two;
counting myself there are three." Of course there was no such
numbering even of Beings for their production, since the due number
was known from the very beginning; but this consideration serves to
show that all Number precedes the very Beings themselves.

<P>But if Number thus preceded the Beings, then it is not included
among them?

<P>The truth is that it existed within the Authentic Being 
but not as
applying to it, for Being was still unparted; the potentiality of
Number existed and so produced the division within Being, put in
travail with multiplicity; Number must be either the substance of
Being or its Activity; the Life-Form as such and the
Intellectual-Principle must be Number. Clearly Being is to 
be, thought
of as Number Collective, while the Beings are Number unfolded: the
Intellectual-Principle is Number moving within itself, while the
Living-Form is Number container of the universe. Even Being is the
outcome of the Unity, and, since the prior is unity, the secondary
must be Number.

<P>Hence it is that the Forms have been described as Henads and
Numbers. This is the authentic Number; the other, the 
"monadic" is its
image. The Authentic is that made manifest in the Forms and 
helping to
bring them to be; primally it is the Number in the Authentic Being,
inherent to it and preceding the Beings, serving to them as root,
fount, first principle.

<P>For the Unity is source to Being; Being's Being is 
stayed upon the
Unity as its safeguard from dissolution; the Unity cannot rest upon
Being which at that would be a unity before possessing unity; and so
with the decad before possessing decadhood.
