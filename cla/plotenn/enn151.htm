<P>3. We have thus covered our main ground, but since corporeity has
been mentioned, we must consider its nature: is it the conjunction
of all the qualities or is it an Idea, or Reason-Principle, whose
presence in Matter constitutes a body?

<P>Now if body is the compound, the thing made up of all 
the required
qualities plus Matter, then corporeity is nothing more than their
conjunction.

<P>And if it is a Reason-Principle, one whose incoming constitutes
the body, then clearly this Principle contains embraced within
itself all the qualities. If this Reason-Principle is to be no mere
principle of definition exhibiting the nature of a thing but a
veritable Reason constituting the thing, then it cannot 
itself contain
Matter but must encircle Matter, and by being present to Matter
elaborate the body: thus the body will be Matter associated with an
indwelling Reason-Principle which will be in itself immaterial, pure
Idea, even though irremoveably attached to the body. It is not to be
confounded with that other Principle in man- treated elsewhere-
which dwells in the Intellectual World by right of being itself an
Intellectual Principle.
