#### Section 1

1\. All human beings from birth onward live to the realm of sense more
than to the Intellectual.

Forced of necessity to attend first to the material, some of them elect
to abide by that order and, their life throughout, make its concerns
their first and their last; the sweet and the bitter of sense are their
good and evil; they feel they have done all if they live along pursuing
the one and barring the doors to the other. And those of them that
pretend to reasoning have adopted this as their philosophy; they are
like the heavier birds which have incorporated much from the earth and
are so weighted down that they cannot fly high for all the wings Nature
has given them.

Others do indeed lift themselves a little above the earth; the better in
their soul urges them from the pleasant to the nobler, but they are not
of power to see the highest and so, in despair of any surer ground, they
fall back in virtue's name, upon those actions and options of the lower
from which they sought to escape.

But there is a third order- those godlike men who, in their mightier
power, in the keenness of their sight, have clear vision of the
splendour above and rise to it from among the cloud and fog of earth and
hold firmly to that other world, looking beyond all here, delighted in
the place of reality, their native land, like a man returning after long
wanderings to the pleasant ways of his own country.
