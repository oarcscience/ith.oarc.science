<P>14. The Academy and the Lyceum are places, and parts of Place,
just as "above," "below," "here" are species or parts of Place; the
difference is of minuter delimitation.

<P>If then "above," "below," "the middle" are places- Delphi, for
example, is the middle [of the earth]- and "near-the-middle" 
is also a
place- Athens, and of course the Lyceum and the other places usually
cited, are near the middle- what need have we to go further and seek
beyond Place, admitting as we do that we refer in every instance to
a place?

<P>If, however, we have in mind the presence of one thing 
in another,
we are not speaking of a single entity, we are not 
expressing a single
notion.

<P>Another consideration: when we say that a man is here, we
present a relation of the man to that in which he is, a relation of
the container to the contained. Why then do we not class as 
a relative
whatever may be produced from this relation?

<P>Besides, how does "here" differ from "at Athens"? The
demonstrative "here" admittedly signifies place; so, then, does "at
Athens": "at Athens" therefore belongs to the category of Place.

<P>Again, if "at Athens" means "is at Athens," then the "is" as
well as the place belongs to the predicate; but this cannot be
right: we do not regard "is a quality" as predicate, but "a quality."

<P>Furthermore, if "in time," "in place" are to be ranged under a
category other than that applying to time and place, why not a
separate category for "in a vessel"? Why not distinct categories for
"in Matter," "in a subject," "a part in a whole," "a whole in its
parts," "a genus in its species," "a species in a genus"? We are
certainly on the way to a goodly number of categories.
