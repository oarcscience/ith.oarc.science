#### Section 6

6\. What then, in sum, is to be thought of Love and of his "birth" as we
are told of it?

Clearly we have to establish the significance, here, of Poverty and
Possession, and show in what way the parentage is appropriate: we have
also to bring these two into line with the other Supernals since one
spirit nature, one spirit essence, must characterize all unless they are
to have merely a name in common.

We must, therefore, lay down the grounds on which we distinguish the
Gods from the Celestials- that is, when we emphasize the separate nature
of the two orders and are not, as often in practice, including these
Spirits under the common name of Gods.

It is our teaching and conviction that the Gods are immune to all
passion while we attribute experience and emotion to the Celestials
which, though eternal Beings and directly next to the Gods, are already
a step towards ourselves and stand between the divine and the human.

But by what process was the immunity lost? What in their nature led them
downwards to the inferior?

And other questions present themselves.

Does the Intellectual Realm include no member of this spirit order, not
even one? And does the Kosmos contain only these spirits, God being
confined to the Intellectual? Or are there Gods in the sub-celestial
too, the Kosmos itself being a God, the third, as is commonly said, and
the Powers down to the Moon being all Gods as well?

It is best not to use the word "Celestial" of any Being of that Realm;
the word "God" may be applied to the Essential-Celestial- the
autodaimon- and even to the Visible Powers of the Universe of Sense down
to the Moon; Gods, these too, visible, secondary, sequent upon the Gods
of the Intellectual Realm, consonant with Them, held about Them, as the
radiance about the star.

What, then, are these spirits?

A Celestial is the representative generated by each Soul when it enters
the Kosmos.

And why, by a Soul entering the Kosmos?

Because Soul pure of the Kosmos generates not a Celestial Spirit but a
God; hence it is that we have spoken of Love, offspring of Aphrodite the
Pure Soul, as a God.

But, first what prevents every one of the Celestials from being an Eros,
a Love? And why are they not untouched by Matter like the Gods?

On the first question: Every Celestial born in the striving of the Soul
towards the good and beautiful is an Eros; and all the Souls within the
Kosmos do engender this Celestial; but other Spirit-Beings, equally born
from the Soul of the All, but by other faculties of that Soul, have
other functions: they are for the direct service of the All, and
administer particular things to the purpose of the Universe entire. The
Soul of the All must be adequate to all that is and therefore must bring
into being spirit powers serviceable not merely in one function but to
its entire charge.

But what participation can the Celestials have in Matter, and in what
Matter?

Certainly none in bodily Matter; that would make them simply living
things of the order of sense. And if, even, they are to invest
themselves in bodies of air or of fire, the nature must have already
been altered before they could have any contact with the corporeal. The
Pure does not mix, unmediated, with body- though many think that the
Celestial-Kind, of its very essence, comports a body aerial or of fire.

But why should one order of Celestial descend to body and another not?
The difference implies the existence of some cause or medium working
upon such as thus descend. What would constitute such a medium?

We are forced to assume that there is a Matter of the Intellectual
Order, and that Beings partaking of it are thereby enabled to enter into
the lower Matter, the corporeal.
