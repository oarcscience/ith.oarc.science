### IX

ON the morning of his fourth day in Ithaka, as he and the swineherd were
eating a meal together, Odysseus heard the sound of footsteps
approaching the hut. The fierce dogs were outside and he expected to
hear them yelping against <span id="img_039"></span>

the stranger’s approach. No sound came from them. Then he saw a young
man come to the entrance of the courtyard, the swineherd’s dogs fawning
upon him.

When Eumæus saw this young man he let fall the vessels he was carrying,
and running to him, kissed his head and his eyes and his hands. While he
was kissing and weeping over him, Odysseus heard the swineherd saying:

‘Telemachus, art thou come back to us? Like a light in the darkness thou
hast appeared! I thought that never again should we see thee when I
heard that thou hadst taken a ship to Pylos! Come in, dear son, come in,
that I may see thee once again in mine house.’

Odysseus raised his head and looked at his son. As a lion might look
over his cub so he looked over Telemachus. But neither the swineherd nor
Telemachus was aware of Odysseus’ gaze.

‘I have come to see thee, friend Eumæus,’ said Telemachus, ‘for before I
go into the City I would know whether my mother is still in the house of
Odysseus, or whether one of the wooers has at last taken her as a wife
to his own house.’

‘Thy mother is still in thy father’s house,’ Eumæus answered. Then
Telemachus came within the courtyard. Odysseus in the guise of the old
beggar rose from his seat, but the young man said to him courteously:
‘Be seated, friend. Another seat can be found for me.’

Eumæus strewed green brushwood and spread a fleece upon it, and
Telemachus seated himself. Next Eumæus fetched a meal for him--oaten
cakes and swine flesh and wine. While they were eating, the swineherd
said:

‘We have here a stranger who has wandered through many countries, and
who has come to my house as a suppliant. Wilt thou take him for thy man,
Telemachus?’

Said Telemachus, ‘How can I support any man? I have not the strength of
hand to defend mine own house. But for this stranger I will do what I
can. I will give him a mantle and doublet, with shoes for his feet and a
sword to defend himself, and I will send him on whatever way he wants to
go. But, Eumæus, I would not have him go near my father’s house. The
wooers grow more insolent each day, and they might mock the stranger if
he went amongst them.’

Then said Odysseus, speaking for the first time, ‘Young sir, what thou
hast said seems strange to me. Dost thou willingly submit to insolence
in thine own father’s house? But perhaps it is that the people of the
City hate thee and will not help thee against thine enemies. Ah, if I
had such youth as I have spirit, or if I were the son of Odysseus, I
should go amongst them this very day, and make myself the bane of each
man of them. I would rather die in mine own halls than see such shame as
is reported--strangers mocked at, and servants injured, and wine and
food wasted.’

Said Telemachus, ‘The people of the City do not hate me, and they would
help me if they could. But the wooers of my mother are powerful men--men
to make the City folk afraid. And if I should oppose them I would
assuredly be slain in my father’s house, for how could I hope to
overcome so many?’

‘What wouldst thou have me do for thee, Telemachus?’ said the swineherd.

‘I would have thee go to my mother, friend Eumæus,’ Telemachus said,
‘and let her know that I am safe-returned from Pylos.’

Eumæus at once put sandals upon his feet and took his staff in his
hands. He begged Telemachus to rest himself in the hut, and then he left
the countryard and went towards the City.

Telemachus lay down on his seat and closed his eyes in weariness. He
saw, while thinking that he only dreamt it, a woman come to the gate of
the countryard. She was fair and tall and splendid, and the dogs shrank
away from her presence with a whine, She touched the beggar with a
golden wand. As she did, the marks of age and beggary fell from him and
the man stood up as tall and noble looking.

‘Who art thou?’ cried Telemachus, starting up. ‘Even a moment ago thou
didst look aged and a beggar! Now thou dost look a chief of men! Art
thou one of the divine ones?’

Odysseus looked upon him and said, ‘My son, do not speak so to me. I am
Odysseus, thy father. After much suffering and much wandering I have
come to my own country.’ He kissed his son with tears flowing down his
cheeks, and Telemachus threw his arms around his father’s neck, but
scarce believing that the father he had searched for was indeed before
him.

But no doubt was left as Odysseus talked to him, and told him how he had
come to Ithaka in a ship given him by the Phæacians, and how he had
brought with him gifts of bronze and raiment that were hidden in the
cave, and told him, too, how Pallas Athene had changed his appearance
into that of an old beggar. <span id="img_040"></span>

And when his own story was finished he said, ‘Come, my son, tell me of
the wooers who waste the substance of our house--tell me how many they
number, and who they are, so that we may prepare a way of dealing with
them.’

‘Even though thou art a great warrior, my father, thou and I cannot hope
to deal with them. They have come, not from Ithaka alone, but from all
the islands around--from Dulichium and Same and Zacynthus. We two cannot
deal with such a throng.’

Said Odysseus, ‘I shall make a plan to deal with them. Go thou home, and
keep company with the wooers. Later in the day the swineherd will lead
me into the city, and I shall go into the house in the likeness of an
old beggar. And if thou shouldst see any of the wooers ill-treat me,
harden thine heart to endure it--even if they drag me by the feet to the
door of the house, keep quiet thou. And let no one--not even thy mother,
Penelope--nor my father Laertes--know that Odysseus hath returned.’

Telemachus said, ‘My father, thou shalt learn soon what spirit is in me
and what wisdom I have.’

While they talked together the ship that Antinous had taken, when he
went to lie in wait for Telemachus, returned. The wooers assembled and
debated whether they should kill Telemachus, for now there was danger
that he would draw the people to his side, and so make up a force that
could drive the wooers out of Ithaka. But they did not agree to kill him
then, for there was one amongst them who was against the deed.

Eumæus brought the news to Telemachus and Odysseus of the return of
Antinous’ ship. He came back to the hut in the afternoon. Pallas Athene
had again given Odysseus the appearance of an ancient beggar-man and the
swineherd saw no change in his guest.
