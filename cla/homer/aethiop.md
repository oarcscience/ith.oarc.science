# Homerica: The Aethiopis (fragments)

### translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White

#### \[1914\]

Fragment \#1 --  
Proclus, Chrestomathia, ii:  
The "Cypria", described in the preceding book, has its sequel in the
"Iliad" of Homer, which is followed in turn by the five books of the
"Aethiopis", the work of Arctinus of Miletus. Their contents are as
follows. The Amazon Penthesileia, the daughter of Ares and of Thracian
race, comes to aid the Trojans, and after showing great prowess, is
killed by Achilles and buried by the Trojans. Achilles then slays
Thersites for abusing and reviling him for his supposed love for
Penthesileia. As a result a dispute arises amongst the Achaeans over the
killing of Thersites, and Achilles sails to Lesbos and after sacrificing
to Apollo, Artemis, and Leto, is purified by Odysseus from bloodshed.

Then Memnon, the son of Eos, wearing armour made by Hephaestus, comes to
help the Trojans, and Thetis tells her son about Memnon.

A battle takes place in which Antilochus is slain by Memnon and Memnon
by Achilles. Eos then obtains of Zeus and bestows upon her son
immortality; but Achilles routs the Trojans, and, rushing into the city
with them, is killed by Paris and Apollo. A great struggle for the body
then follows, Aias taking up the body and carrying it to the ships,
while Odysseus drives off the Trojans behind. The Achaeans then bury
Antilochus and lay out the body of Achilles, while Thetis, arriving with
the Muses and her sisters, bewails her son, whom she afterwards catches
away from the pyre and transports to the White Island. After this, the
Achaeans pile him a cairn and hold games in his honour. Lastly a dispute
arises between Odysseus and Aias over the arms of Achilles.

Fragment \#2 --  
Scholiast on Homer, Il. xxiv. 804:  
Some read: \`Thus they performed the burial of Hector. Then came the
Amazon, the daughter of great-souled Ares the slayer of men.'

Fragment \#3 --  
Scholiast on Pindar, Isth. iii. 53:  
The author of the "Aethiopis" says that Aias killed himself about dawn.
