For over three centuries scholars have debated whether an actual person
named Homer existed; some have speculated that the name Homer is
actually a collective name for a group of bards (the Homeridae) who
redacted (edited) a existing cycle of oral epics about 800 B.C.E. Others
believe, based on textual evidence, that one person did compose or
redact the two major Homeric compositions. In any case, stating an
opinion about this question would be a good way to start a bar fight at
a conference of classical scholars....

Certainly, there are few details about Homer's life. According to
classical sources, Homer lived around 1200 B.C.E.; today dates of the
8th or 7th Century B.C.E. are quoted. Homer is traditionally described
as being blind--based on one Archaic Greek fragment--but the visual
quality of his work makes this hard to believe; perhaps he became blind
later in life.

The Homeric cycle was composed around the same time as the Indian
[Ramayana](../../hin/rama/index.md), which it resembles thematically. The
entire Homeric cycle, of which the [Iliad and Odyssey](#homer.md) are the
only complete surviving works, included dozens of books composed by
Homer and others. Some fragments of this cycle are included
[below](#homerica.md).

The Illiad is based on events which probably occurred around 1000 B.C.E.
The Mycenean Greeks of this era were contemporaries with a Bronze age
city in Asia Minor on the Aegean coast of what today is Turkey. Both
these cultures employed megalithic architecture. Heinrich Schliemann, a
German archeologist in the early 20th Century, excavated both Mycenae in
the Peloponessus region of Greece, and another site in western Turkey
which he identified as the actual city of Troy. 'Troy' was destroyed
(sometimes by fire) and rebuilt--not once, but multiple times--and
resembles closely the description of Troy in the Iliad. Whether the
events in the Iliad are literally true in some sense is still unknown.
The Odyssey, on the other hand, is pure fiction, and one must strain to
correlate its plot with any actual geography or history; it has been
called the first science fiction novel.

In any case, these stories remain the most ancient European literature
that we have intact; because of their lively pacing and vivid characters
they still have strong appeal for modern readers.

### Homerica

The following are fragments written by other authors in antiquity on the
subject of the Homeric epic and Homer; some of these were spuriously
attributed to Homer. These are remnants of a huge epic cycle which
encompassed the whole mythological and legendary history of the Greeks,
of which the battle for Troy is the centerpiece. The cycle was never
completely canonized, and as late as classical Roman times [Virgils'
Aeneid](../virgil/aen/index.md) added yet another epic poem to the
collection. It seems that sequels and prequels were just as popular in
Ancient Greece as in modern Hollywood...

These are from Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns and Homerica by Hugh G.
Evelyn-White, \[1914\] (Loeb Classics \#57). The other portions of this
book are presented above on this page, and in the [Hesiod
section](../hesiod/index.md); this etext was scanned as the Online Medieval
and Classical Library Release \#8 by Douglas B. Killings, and is also
available from the Gutenburg Project.
