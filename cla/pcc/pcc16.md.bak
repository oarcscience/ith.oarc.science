### XV.

### THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES

Thus we come to a thing which we must not pass over, because it throws
great light on the meaning and interpretation of all these rites and
ceremonies of the great World-religion. I mean the subject of the
Ancient Mysteries. And to this I will give a few pages.

These Mysteries were probably survivals of the oldest religious rites of
the Greek races, and in their earlier forms consisted not so much in
worship of the gods of Heaven as of the divinities of Earth, and of
Nature and Death. Crude, no doubt, at first, they gradually became
(especially in their Eleusinian form) more refined and philosophical;
the rites were gradually thrown open, on certain conditions, not only to
men generally, but also to women, and even to slaves; and in the end
they influenced Christianity deeply. <span
id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_253.md)

There were apparently three forms of teaching made use of in these
rites: these were λεγόμενα things *said*; δεικνύμενα things *shown*; and
δρώμενα, things *performed* or *acted*. <span
id="fr_254"></span>[2](#fn_254.md) I have given already some instances of
things said--texts whispered for consolation in the neophyte's ear, and
so forth; of the *third* group, things enacted, we have a fair amount of
evidence. There were

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

ritual dramas or passion-plays, of which an important one dealt with the
descent of Koré or Proserpine into the underworld, as in the Eleusinian
representations, <span id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_255.md) and her
redemption and restoration to the upper world in Spring; another with
the sufferings of Psyche and her rescue by Eros, as described by
Apuleius <span id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_256.md)--himself an initiate in
the cult of Isis. There is a parody by Lucian, which tells of the birth
of Apollo, the marriage of Coronis, and the coming of Aesculapius as
Savior; there was the dying and rising again of Dionysus (chief divinity
of the Orphic cult); and sometimes the mystery of the birth of Dionysus
as a holy child. <span id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_257.md) There was, every
year at Eleusis, a solemn and lengthy procession or pilgrimage made,
symbolic of the long pilgrimage of the human soul, its sufferings and
deliverance.

"Almost always," says Dr. Cheetham, "the suffering of a god--suffering
followed by triumph--seems to have been the subject of the sacred
drama." Then occasionally to the Neophytes, after taking part in the
pilgrimage, and when their minds had been prepared by an ordeal of
darkness and fatigue and terrors, was accorded a revelation of Paradise,
and even a vision of Transfiguration--the form of the Hierophant
himself, or teacher of the Mysteries, being seen half-lost in a blaze of
light. <span id="fr_258"></span>[4](#fn_258.md) Finally, there was the
eating of food and drinking of barley-drink from the sacred chest <span
id="fr_259"></span>[5](#fn_259.md)--a kind of Communion or Eucharist.

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

Apuleius in *The Golden Ass* gives an interesting account of his
induction into the mysteries of Isis: how, bidding farewell one evening
to the general congregation outside, and clothed in a new linen garment,
he was handed by the priest into the inner recesses of the temple
itself; how he "approached the confines of death, and having trod on the
threshold of Proserpine (the Underworld), returned therefrom, being
borne through all the elements. At midnight I saw the sun shining with
its brilliant light: and I approached the presence of the Gods beneath
and the Gods above, and stood near and worshipped them." During the
night things happened which must not be disclosed; but in the morning he
came forth "consecrated by being dressed in twelve stoles painted with
the figures of animals." <span id="fr_260"></span>[1](#fn_260.md) He
ascended a pulpit in the midst of the Temple, carrying in his right hand
a burning torch, while a chaplet encircled his head, from which
palm-leaves projected like rays of light. "Thus arrayed like the *Sun*,
and placed so as to resemble a statue, on a sudden the curtains being
drawn aside, I was exposed to the gaze of the multitude. After this I
celebrated the most joyful day of my initiation, as my natal day \[day
of the New Birth\] and there was a joyous banquet and mirthful
conversation."

One can hardly refuse to recognize in this account the description of
some kind of ceremony which was supposed to seal the illumination of a
man and his new birth into divinity--the animal origin, the circling of
all experience, the terrors of death, and the resurrection in the form
of

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

the Sun, the symbol of all light and life. The very word "illumination"
carries the ideas of light and a new birth with it. Reitzenstein in his
very interesting book on the Greek Mysteries <span
id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261.md) speaks over and over again of the
illumination (φωτισμός) which was held to attend Initiation and
Salvation. The doctrine of Salvation indeed was, as we have already
seen, rife and widely current in the Second Century B. C. It represented
a real experience, and the man who shared this experience became a θεῖος
ἄνθρωπος or divine man. <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_262.md) In the
Orphic Tablets the phrase "I am a child of earth and the starry heaven,
but my race is of heaven (alone)" occurs more than once. In one of the
longest of them the dead man is instructed "after he has passed the
waters (of Lethe) where the white Cypress and the House of Hades are" to
address these very words to the guardians of the Lake of Memory while he
asks for a drink of cold water from that Lake. In another the dead
person himself is thus addressed: "Hail, thou who hast endured the
Suffering, such as indeed thou hadst never suffered before; *thou hast
become god from man*!" <span id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_263.md) Ecstacy was
the acme of the religious life; and, what is especially interesting to
us, Salvation or the divine nature was open to all men--to all, that is,
who should go through the necessary stages of preparation for it. <span
id="fr_264"></span>[4](#fn_264.md)

Reitzenstein contends (p. 26) that in the Mysteries, transfiguration
(μεταμορφώσις), salvation (σωτηρία), and new birth (παλιγγενεσία) were
often conjoined. He says

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (p. 31), that in the Egyptian Osiris-cult, the
Initiate acquires a nature "equal to God", (ισόθεος) the very same
expression as that used of Christ Jesus in Philippians ii. 6; he
mentions Apollonius of Tyana and Sergius Paulus as instances of men who
by their contemporaries were considered to have attained this nature;
and he quotes Akhnaton (Pharaoh of Egypt in 1375 B.C.) as having said,
"Thou art in my heart; none other knows Thee, save thy son Akhnaton;
Thou hast initiated him into thy wisdom and into thy power." He also
quotes the words of Hermes (Trismegistus)--"Come unto Me, even as
children to their mother's bosom: Thou art I, and I am Thou; what is
thine is mine, and what is mine is thine; for indeed I am thine image
(ἔιδωλον)," and refers to the dialogue between Hermes and Tat, in which
they speak of the great and mystic New Birth and Union with the
All--with all Elements, Plants and Animals, Time and Space.

"The Mysteries," says Dr. Cheetham very candidly, "influenced
Christianity considerably and modified it in some important respects";
and Dr. Hatch, as we have seen, not only supports this general view, but
follows it out in detail. <span id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_265.md) He
points out that the membership of the Mystery-societies was very
numerous in the earliest times, A.D.; that their general aims were good,
including a sense of true religion, decent life, and brotherhood; that
cleanness from crime and confession were demanded from the neophyte;
that confession was followed by baptism () and *that* by sacrifice; that
the term φωτισμός (illumination) was adopted by the Christian Church as
the name for the new birth of baptism; that the Christian usage of
placing a seal on the forehead came from the same source; that baptism
itself after a time was called a mystery (μυσιήριου); that the sacred
cakes and barley-drink of the Mysteries became the milk and honey and
bread and wine of the first Christian Eucharists, and that the
occasional

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

sacrifice of a lamb on the Christ an altar ("whose mention is often
suppressed") probably originated in the same way. Indeed, the conception
of the communion-table *as* an altar and many other points of ritual
gradually established themselves from these sources as time went
on. <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_266.md) It is hardly necessary to say
more in proof of the extent to which in these ancient representations
"things said" and "scenes enacted" forestalled the doctrines and
ceremonials of Christianity.

 

"But what of the second group above-mentioned, the "things *shown*"? It
is not so easy naturally to get exact information concerning these, but
they seem to have been specially holy objects, probably things connected
with very ancient rituals in the past--such as sacred stones, old and
rude images of the gods, magic nature-symbols, like that half-disclosed
ear of corn above-mentioned (Ch. V. *supra*). "In the Temple of Isis at
Philae," says Dr. Cheetham, "the dead body of Osiris is represented with
stalks of corn springing from it, which a priest waters from a vessel.
An inscription says: 'This is the form of him whom we may not name,
Osiris of the Mysteries who sprang from the returning waters' \[the
Nile\]." Above all, no doubt, there were images of the *phallus* and the
*vulva*, the great symbols of human fertility. We have seen (Ch. XII)
that the *lingam* and the *yoni* are, even down to to-day, commonly
retained and honored as holy objects in the S. Indian Temples, and
anointed with oil (some of them) for a very practical reason. Sir J. G.
Frazer, in his lately published volumes on *The Folk-lore of the Old
Testament*, has a chapter (in vol. ii) on the very numerous sacred
stones of various shapes and sizes found or spoken of in Palestine and
other parts of the world. Though uncertain as to the meaning of these
stones he mentions that they are "frequently,

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

though not always, *upright*." Anointing them with oil, he assures us,
"is a widespread practice, sometimes by women who wish to obtain
children." And he concludes the chapter by saying: "The holy stone at
Bethel was probably one of those massive standing stones or rough
pillars which the Hebrews called *masseboth*, and which, as we have
seen, were regular adjuncts of Canaanite and early Israelitish
sanctuaries." We have already mentioned the pillars Jachin and Boaz
which stood before the Temple of Solomon, and which had an acknowledged
sexual significance; and so it seems probable that a great number of
these holy stones had a similar meaning. <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_267.md) Following this clue it would appear
likely that the *lingam* thus anointed and worshipped in the Temples of
India and elsewhere *is* the original Χρίστος, <span
id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_268.md) adored by the human race from the very
beginning, and that at a later time, when the Priest and the King, as
objects of worship, took the place of the Lingam, *they* also were
anointed with the chrism of fertility. That the exhibition of these
emblems should be part of the original 'Mystery'-rituals was perfectly
natural--especially because, as we have explained already <span
id="fr_269"></span>[3](#fn_269.md), old customs often continued on in a
quite naïve fashion in the rituals, when they had come to be thought
indecent or improper by a later public opinion; and (we may say) was
perfectly in order, because there is plenty of evidence to show that in
*savage* initiations, of which the Mysteries were the linear
descendants, all these things *were* explained to

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

the novices, and their use actually taught. <span
id="fr_270"></span>[1](#fn_270.md) No doubt also there were some
representations or dramatic incidents of a fairly coarse character, as
deriving from these ancient sources. <span
id="fr_271"></span>[2](#fn_271.md) It is, however, quaint to observe how
the mere mention of such things has caused an almost hysterical
commotion among the critics of the Mysteries--from the day of the early
Christians who (in order to belaud their own religion) were never tired
of abusing the Pagans, onward to the present day when modern scholars
either on the one hand follow the early Christians in representing the
Mysteries as sinks of iniquity or on the other (knowing this charge
could not be substantiated except in the period of their final
decadence) take the line of ignoring the sexual interest attaching to
them as non-existent or at any rate unworthy of attention. The good
Archdeacon Cheetham, for instance, while writing an interesting book on
the Mysteries passes by this side of the subject *almost* as if it did
not exist; while the learned Dr. Farnell, overcome apparently by the
weight of his learning, and unable to confront the alarming obstacle
presented by these sexual rites and aspects, hides himself behind the
rather non-committal remark (speaking of the Eleusinian rites) "we have
no right to imagine any part of this solemn ceremony as coarse or
obscene." <span id="fr_272"></span>[3](#fn_272.md) As Nature, however, has
been known (quite

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

frequently) to be coarse or obscene, and as the initiators of the
Mysteries were probably neither 'good' nor 'learned,' but were simply
anxious to interpret Nature as best they could, we cannot find fault
with the latter for the way they handled the problem, nor indeed well
see how they could have handled it better.

After all it is pretty clear that the early peoples saw in Sex the great
cohesive force which kept (we will not say Humanity but at any rate) the
Tribe together, and sustained the race. In the stage of simple
Consciousness this must have been one of the first things that the
budding intellect perceived. Sex became one of the earliest divinities,
and there is abundant evidence that its organs and processes generally
were invested with a religious sense of awe and sanctity. It was in fact
the symbol (or rather the actuality) of the permanent undying life of
the race, and as such was sacred to the uses of the race. Whatever
taboos may have, among different peoples, guarded its operations, it was
not essentially a thing to be concealed, or ashamed of. Rather the
contrary. For instance the early Christian writer, Hippolytus, Bishop of
Pontus (A.D. 200), in his *Refutation of all Heresies*, Book V, says
that the Samothracian Mysteries, just mentioned, celebrate Adam as the
primal or archetypal Man eternal in the heavens; and he then continues:
"Habitually there stand in the temple of the Samothracians two images of
naked men having both hands stretched aloft towards heaven, and their
*pudenda* turned upwards, as is also the case with the statue of Mercury
on Mt. Cyllene. And the aforesaid images are figures of the primal man,
and of that spiritual one that is born again, in every respect of the
same substance with that \[first\] man."

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

This extract from Hippolytus occurs in the long discourse in which he
'exposes' the heresy of the so-called *Naassene* doctrines and
mysteries. But the whole discourse should be read by those who wish to
understand the Gnostic philosophy of the period contemporary with and
anterior to the birth of Christianity. A translation of the discourse,
carefully analyzed and annotated, is given in G. R. S. Mead's
*Thrice-greatest Hermes* <span id="fr_273"></span>[1](#fn_273) (vol. i.md);
and Mead himself, speaking of it, says (p. 141): "The claim of these
Gnostics was practically that the *good news of the Christ* \[the
Christos\] was the consummation of the inner doctrine of the
Mystery-institutions of all the nations; the end of them all being the
revelation of the Mystery of Man." Further, he explains that the Soul,
in these doctrines, was regarded as synonymous with the Cause of All;
and that its loves were twain--of Aphrodite (or Life), and of Persephone
(or Death and the other world). Also that Attis, abandoning his sex in
the worship of the Mother-Goddess (D a Syria), ascends to Heaven--a new
man, Male-female, and the origin of all things: the hidden Mystery being
the Phallus itself, erected as Hermes in all roads and boundaries and
temples, the *Conductor and Reconductor of Souls*.

 

All this may sound strange, but one may fairly say that it represented
in its degree, and in that first 'unfallen' stage of human thought and
psychology, a true conception of the cosmic Life, and indeed a
conception quite sensible and admirable, until, of course, the Second
Stage brought corruption. No sooner was this great force of the cosmic
life diverted from its true uses of Generation and Regeneration <span
id="fr_274"></span>[2](#fn_274.md) and appropriated by the individual to
his own private pleasure--no sooner was its religious character as a
tribal

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

service <span id="fr_275"></span>[1](#fn_275.md) (often rendered within the
Temple precincts) lost sight of or degraded into a commercial
transaction--than every kind of evil fell upon mankind. *Corruptio
optimi pessima*. It must be remembered too that simultaneous with this
sexual disruption occurred the disruption of other human relations; and
we cease to be surprised that disease and selfish passions, greed,
jealousy, slander, cruelty, and wholesale murder, raged--and have raged
ever since

But for the human soul--whatever its fate, and whatever the dangers and
disasters that threaten it--there is always redemption waiting. As we
saw in the last chapter, this corruption of Sex led (quite naturally) to
its denial and rejection; and its denial led to the differentiation from
it of Love. Humanity gained by the enthronement And deification of Love,
pure and undefiled, and (for the time being) exalted beyond this mortal
world, and free from all earthly contracts. But again in the end, the
divorce thus introduced between the physical and the spiritual led to
the crippling of both. Love relegated, so to speak, to heaven as a
purely philanthropical, pious and 'spiritual' affair, became exceedingly
*dull*; and sex, remaining on earth, but deserted by the redeeming
presence, fell into mere "carnal curiosity and wretchedness of unclean
living." Obviously for the human race there remains nothing, in the
final event, but the reconciliation of the physical and the spiritual,
and after many sufferings, the reunion of Eros and Psyche.

 

There is still, however, much to be said about the Third State of
Consciousness. Let us examine into it a little

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

more closely. Clearly, since it is a new state, and not merely an
extension of a former one, one cannot arrive at it by argument derived
from the Second state, for all conscious Thought such as we habitually
use simply keeps us *in* the Second state. No animal or quite primitive
man could possibly understand what we mean by Self-consciousness till he
had experienced it. Mere argument would not enlighten him. And so no one
in the Second state can quite realize the Third state till he has
experienced it. Still, explanations may help us to perceive in what
direction to look, and to recognize in some of our experiences an
approach to the condition sought.

Evidently it is a mental condition in some respects more similar to the
first than to the second stage. The second stage of human psychologic
evolution is an aberration, a divorce, a parenthesis. With its
culmination and dismissal the mind passes back into the simple state of
union with the Whole. (The state of *Ekágratá* in the Hindu philosophy:
one-pointedness, singleness of mind.) And the consciousness of the
Whole, and of things past and things to come and things far
around--which consciousness had been shut out by the concentration on
the local self--begins to return again. This is not to say, of course,
that the excursus in the second stage has been a loss and a defect. On
the contrary, it means that the Return is a bringing of all that has
been gained during the period of exile (all sorts of mental and
technical knowledge and skill, emotional developments, finesse and
adaptability of mind) *back* into harmony with the Whole. It means
ultimately a great gain. The Man, perfected, comes back to a vastly
extended harmony. He enters again into a real understanding and
confidential relationship with his physical body and with the body of
the society in which he dwells--from both of which he has been sadly
divorced; and he takes up again the broken thread of the Cosmic Life.

Everyone has noticed the extraordinary consent sometimes

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

observable among the members of an animal community--how a flock of 500
birds (e. g. starlings) will suddenly change its direction of
flight--the light on the wings shifting *instantaneously*, as if the
impulse to veer came to all at the same identical moment; or how bees
will swarm or otherwise act with one accord, or migrating creatures
(lemmings, deer, gossamer spiders, winged ants) the same. Whatever
explanation of these facts we favor--whether the possession of swifter
and finer means of external communication than we can perceive, or
whether a common and inner sensitivity to the genius of the Tribe (the
"Spirit of the Hive") or to the promptings of great Nature around--in
any case these facts of animal life appear to throw light on the
possibilities of an accord and consent among the members of emaciated
humanity, such as we dream of now, and seem to bid us have good hope for
the future.

It is here, perhaps, that the ancient worship of the *Lingam* comes in.
The word itself is apparently connected with our word 'link,' and has
originally the same meaning. <span id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_276.md) It is
the link between the generations. Beginning with the worship of the
physical Race-life, the course of psychologic evolution has been first
to the worship of the Tribe (or of the Totem which represents the
tribe); then to the worship of the human-formed *God* of the tribe--the
God who dies and rises again eternally, as the tribe passes on
eternal--though its members perpetually perish; then to the conception
of an undying Savior, and the realization and distinct experience of
some kind of Super-consciousness which does certainly reside, more or
less hidden, in the deeps of the mind, and has been waiting through the
ages for its disclosure and recognition. Then again to the recognition
that in the sacrifices, the Slayer and the Slain are one--the strange
and profoundly mystic perception that the God and the Victim are in
essence the same--the dedication of 'Himself to Himself'; <span
id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_277.md) and simultaneously

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

with this the interpretation of the Eucharist as meaning, even for the
individual, the participation in Eternal Life--the continuing life of
the Tribe, or ultimately of Humanity. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_278.md) The Tribal order rises to Humanity; love
ascends from the *lingam* to *yogam*, from physical union alone to the
union with the Whole--which of course includes physical and all other
kinds of union. No wonder that the good St. Paul, witnessing that
extraordinary whirlpool of beliefs and practices, new and old, there in
the first century A.D.--the unabashed adoration of sex side by side with
the transcendental devotions of the Vedic sages and the Gnostics--became
somewhat confused himself and even a little violent, scolding his
disciples (I Cor. x. 21) for their undiscriminating acceptance, as it
seemed to him, of things utterly alien and antagonistic. "Ye cannot
drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers
of the Lord's table and the table of devils."

Every careful reader has noticed the confusedness of Paul's mind and
arguments. Even taking only those Epistles (Galatians, Romans and
Corinthians) which the critics assign to his pen, the thing is
observable--and some learned Germans even speak of *two* Pauls. <span
id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_279.md) But also the thing is quite natural.
There can be little doubt that Paul of Tarsus, a Jew brought up in the
strictest sect of the Pharisees, did at some time fall deeply under the
influence of Greek thought, and quite possibly became an initiate

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

in the Mysteries. It would be difficult otherwise to account for his
constant use of the Mystery-language. Reitzenstein says (p. 59): "The
hellenistic religious literature *must* have been read by him; he uses
its terms, and is saturated with its thoughts (see Rom. vi. 1-14." And
this conjoined with his Jewish experience gave him creative power. "A
great deal in his sentiment and thought may have *remained* Jewish, but
to his Hellenism he was indebted for his love of freedom and his firm
belief in his apostleship." He adopts terms (like σαρκικός, ψυχικός and
πνευματικός) <span id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_280.md) which were in use
among the hellenistic sects of the time; and he writes, as in Romans vi.
4, 5, about being "*buried*" with Christ or "*planted*" in the likeness
of his death, in words which might well have been used (with change of
the name) by a follower of Attis or Osiris after witnessing the
corresponding 'mysteries'; certainly the allusion to these ancient
deities would have been understood by every religionist of that day.
These few points are sufficient to accentuate the two elements in Paul,
the Jewish and the Greek, and to explain (so far) the seeming confusion
in his utterances. Further it is interesting to note--as showing the
pagan influences in the N. T. writings--the degree to which the Epistle
to Philemon (ascribed to Paul) is *full*--short as it is--of expressions
like *prisoner* of the Lord, *fellow soldier*, *captive* OR
*bondman*, <span id="fr_281"></span>[2](#fn_281.md) which were so common at
the time as to be almost a cant in Mithraism and the allied cults. In 1
Peter ii. 2 <span id="fr_282"></span>[3](#fn_282.md), we have the verse "As
newborn babes, desire ye he sincere *milk* of the word, that ye may grow
thereby." And again we may say that no one in that day could mistake the
reference herein contained to old initiation ceremonies and the new
birth (as described in Chapter VIII above), for indeed milk was

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

the well-known diet of the novice in the Isis mysteries, as well as (in
some savage tribes) of the Medicine-man when practising his calling.

And here too Democracy comes in--strangely foreboded from the first in
all this matter. <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_283.md) Not only does the
Third Stage bring illumination, intuitive understanding of processes in
Nature and Humanity, sympathy with the animals, artistic capacity, and
so forth, but it necessarily brings a new Order of Society. A
preposterous--one may almost say a hideous--social Age is surely drawing
to its end, The *débâcle* we are witnessing to-day all over Europe
(including the British Islands), the break-up of old institutions, the
generally materialistic outlook on life, the coming to the surface of
huge masses of diseased and fatuous populations, the scum and dregs
created by the past order, all point to the End of a Dispensation.
Protestantism and Commercialism, in the two fields of religion and daily
life have, as I have indicated before, been occupied in concentrating
the mind of each man solely on his *own* welfare, the salvation of his
*own* soul or body. These two forces have therefore been disruptive to
the last degree they mark the culmination of the Self-conscious Age--a
culmination in War, Greed, Materialism, and the general principle of
*Devil-take-the-hindmost*--and the clearing of the ground for the new
order which is to come. So there is hope for the human race. Its
evolution is not all a mere formless craze and jumble. There is an inner
necessity by which Humanity unfolds from one degree or plane of
consciousness to another. And if there has been a great 'Fall' or Lapse
into conflict and disease and 'sin' and misery, occupying the major part
of the Historical period hitherto, we see that this period is only
brief, so to speak, in comparison with the whole curve of growth and
expansion. We see also that, as I have said before, the belief in a
state of salvation

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

or deliverance has in the past ages never left itself quite without a
witness in the creeds and rituals and poems and prophecies of mankind.
Art, in some form or other, as an activity or inspiration dating not
from the conscious Intellect, but from deeper re ions of sub-conscious
feeling and intuition, has continually come to us as a message from and
an evidence of the Third stage or state, and as a promise of its more
complete realization under other conditions.

Through the long night-time where the Nations wander  
       From Eden past to Paradise to be,  
Art's sacred flowers, like fair stars shining yonder,  
       Alone illumine Life's obscurity.

O gracious Artists, out of your deep hearts  
       'Tis some great Sun, I doubt, by men unguessed,  
Whose rays come struggling thus, in slender darts,  
       To shadow what Is, till Time shall manifest.

With the Cosmic stage comes also necessarily the rehabilitation of the
*whole* of Society in one fellowship (the true Democracy). Not the rule
or domination of one class or caste--as of the Intellectual, the Pious,
the Commercial or the Military--but the fusion or at least consentaneous
organization of *all* (as in the corresponding functions of the human
Body). Class rule has been the mark of that second period of human
evolution, and has inevitably given birth during that period to wars and
self-agrandizements of classes and sections, and their consequent greeds
and tyrannies over other classes and sections. It is not found in the
primitive human tribes and societies, and will not be found in the final
forms of human association. The liberated and emancipated Man passes
unconstrained and unconstraining through all grades and planes of human
fellowship, equal and undisturbed, and never leaving his true home and
abiding place in the heart of all. Equally necessarily with the
rehabilitation of Society as an entirety

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

will follow the rehabilitation of the entire physical body *in* each
member of Society. We have spoken already of Nakedness: its meaning and
likely extent of adoption (Ch. XII). The idea that the head and the
hands are the only seemly and presentable members of the organism, and
that the other members are unworthy and indecent, is obviously as
onesided and lopsided as that which honors certain classes in the
commonwealth and despises others. Why should the head brag of its
ascendancy and domination, and the heart be smothered up and hidden? It
will only be a life far more in the open air than that which we lead at
present, which will restore the balance and ultimately bring us back to
sanity and health.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[240:5](pcc16.htm#fr_259.md) *Ibid*., 186. Sacred
chests, in which holy things were kept, figure frequently in early rites
and legends--as in the case of the ark of the Jewish tabernacle, the ark
or box carried in celebrations of the mysteries of Bacchus (Theocritus,
Idyll xxvi), the legend of Pandora's box which contained the seeds of
all good and evil, the ark of Noah which saved all living creatures from
the flood, the Argo of the argonauts, the moonshaped boat in which Isis
floating over the waters gathered together the severed limbs of Osiris,
and so brought about his resurrection, and the many chests or coffins
out <span id="page_241">p. 241</span> of which the various gods (Adonis,
Attis, Osiris, Jesus), having been laid there in death, rose again for
the redemption of the world. They all evidently refer to the mystic womb
of Nature and of Woman, and are symbols of salvation and redemption (For
a full discussion of this subject, see *The Great Law of religious
origins*, by W. Williamson, ch. iv.)

<span id="fn_260"></span>[241:1](pcc16.htm#fr_260.md) An allusion no doubt
to the twelve signs of the Zodiac, the pathway of the Sun, as well as to
the practice of the ancient priests of wearing the skins of
totem-animals in sign of their divinity.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[242:3](pcc16.htm#fr_263.md) These Tablets
(so-called) are instructions to the dead as to their passage into the
other world, and have been found in the tombs, in Italy and elsewhere,
inscribed on very thin gold plates and buried with the departed. See

(end of fifth century), who describes the Christian rites generally in
Mystery language (Hatch, 296).

<span id="fn_267"></span>[245:1](pcc16.htm#fr_267.md) F. Nork, *Der
Mystagog*, mentions that the Roman *Penates* were commonly anointed with
oil. J. Stuart Hay, in his *Life of Elagabalus* (1911), says that
"Elagabal was worshipped under the symbol of a great black stone or
meteorite, in the shape of a Phallus, which having fallen from the
heavens represented a true portion of the Godhead, much after the style
of those black stone images popularly venerated in Norway and other
parts of Europe."

<span id="fn_268"></span>[245:2](pcc16.htm#fr_268.md) J. E. Hewitt, in his
*Ruling Races of Pre-historic Times* (p. 64), gives a long list of
pre-historic races who worshipped the *lingam*.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[245:3](pcc16.htm#fr_269.md) See Ch. XI, p. 71.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[246:1](pcc16.htm#fr_270.md) See Ernest Crawley's
*Mystic Rose*, ch. xiii, pp. 310 and 313: "In certain tribes of Central
Africa both boys and girls after initiation must as soon as possible
have intercourse." Initiation being not merely preliminary to, but often
*actually* marriage. The same among Kaffirs, Congo tribes, Senegalese,
etc. Also among the Arunta of Australia.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[246:2](pcc16.htm#fr_271.md) Professor Diederichs
has said that "in much ancient ritual it was thought that mystic
communion with the deity could be obtained through the semblance of
sex-intercourse--as in the Attis-Cybele worship, and the Isis-ritual."
(Farnell.) Reitzenstein says (*op. cit*., p. 20.) that the Initiates,
like some of the Christian Nuns at a later time, believed in union with
God through receiving the seed.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[246:3](pcc16.htm#fr_272.md) Farnell, *op. cit*.,
iii. 176. Messrs. Gardner and Jevons, in their *Manual of Greek
Antiquities*, above-quoted, compare the Eleusinian Mysteries favorably
with some of the others, like the Arcadian, the <span id="page_247">p.
247</span> Troezenian, the Æginæan, and the very primitive Samothracian:
saying (p. 278) that of the last-mentioned "we know little, but safely
conjecture that in them the ideas of sex and procreation dominated *even
more* than in those of Eleusis."

<span id="fn_273"></span>[248:1](pcc16.htm#fr_273.md) Reitzenstein, *op.
cit*., quotes the discourse largely. *The Thrice-greatest Hermes* may
also be consulted for a translation of Plutarch's *Isis and Osiris*.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[248:2](pcc16.htm#fr_274.md) For the special
meaning of these two terms, see *The Drama of Love and Death*, by E.
Carpenter, pp. 59-61.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[249:1](pcc16.htm#fr_275.md) Ernest Crawley in
*The Mystic Rose* challenges this identification of Religion with tribal
interests; yet his arguments are not very convincing. On p. 5 he admits
that "there is a religious meaning inherent in the primitive conception
and practice of *all* human relations"; and a large part of his ch. xii
is taken up in showing that even such institutions as the Saturnalia
were religious in confirming the sense of social union and leading to
'extended identity.'

<span id="fn_276"></span>[251:1](pcc16.htm#fr_276.md) See Sanskrit
Dictionary.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[251:2](pcc16.htm#fr_277.md) See Ch. VIII,
*supra*.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[252:1](pcc16.htm#fr_278.md) There are many
indications in literature--in prophetic or poetic form--of this
awareness and distinct conviction of an eternal life, reached through
love and an inner sense of union with others and with humanity at large;
indications which bear the mark of absolute genuineness and sincerity of
feeling. See, for instance, Whitman's poem, "To the Garden the World"
(*Leaves of Grass*, complete edition, p. 79). But an eternal life of the
third order; not, thank heaven! an eternity of the meddling and muddling
self-conscious Intellect!
