"The different religions being lame attempts to represent under various
guises this one root-fact of the central universal life, men have at all
times clung to the religious creeds and rituals and ceremonials as
symbolising in some rude way the redemption and fulfilment of their own
most intimate natures--and this whether consciously understanding the
interpretations, or whether (as most often) only doing so in an
unconscious or quite subconscious way."--The Drama of Love and Death, p.
96.
