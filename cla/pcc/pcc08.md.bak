### VII.

### RITES OF EXPIATION AND REDEMPTION

There is a passage in Richard Jefferies' imperishably beautiful book The
Story of my Heart--a passage well known to all lovers of that
prose-poet--in which he figures himself standing "in front of the Royal
Exchange where the wide pavement reaches out like a promontory," and
pondering on the vast crowd and the mystery of life. "Is there any
theory, philosophy, or creed," he says, "is there any system of culture,
any formulated method, able to meet and satisfy each separate item of
this agitated pool of human life? By which they may be guided, by which
they may hope, by which look forward? Not a mere illusion of the craving
heart--something real, as real as the solid walls of fact against which,
like seaweed, they are dashed; something to give each separate
personality sunshine and a flower in its own existence now; something to
shape this million-handed labor to an end and outcome that will leave
more sunshine and more flowers to those who must succeed? Something real
now, and not in the spirit-land; in this hour now, as I stand and the
sun burns. . . . Full well aware that all has failed, yet, side by side
with the sadness of that knowledge, there lives on in me an unquenchable
belief, thought burning like the sun, that there is yet something to be

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

found. . . . It must be dragged forth by the might of thought from the
immense forces of the universe."

In answer to this passage we may say "No,--a thousand times No! there is
*no* theory, philosophy, creed, system or formulated method which will
meet or ever satisfy the demand of each separate item of the human
whirlpool." And happy are we to know there is no such thing! How
terrible if one of these bloodless 'systems' which strew the history of
religion and philosophy and the political and social paths of human
endeavor *had* been found absolutely correct and universally
applicable--so that every human being would be compelled to pass through
its machine-like maw, every personality to be crushed under its
Juggernath wheels! No, thank Heaven! there is no theory or creed or
system; and yet there is something--as Jefferies prophetically felt and
with a great longing desired--that *can* satisfy; and that, the root of
all religion, has been hinted at in the last chapter. It is the
*consciousness* of the world-life burning, blazing, deep down within us:
it is the Soul's intuition of its roots in Omnipresence and Eternity.

The gods and the creeds of the past, as shown in the last
chapter--whatever they may have been, animistic or anthropomorphic or
transcendental, whether grossly brutish or serenely ideal and
abstract--are essentially projections of the human mind; and no doubt
those who are anxious to discredit the religious impulse generally will
catch at this, saying "Yes, they are mere forms and phantoms of the
mind, ephemeral dreams, projected on the background of Nature, and
having no real substance or solid value. The history of Religion (they
will say) is a history of delusion and illusion; why waste time over it?
These divine grizzly Bears or Aesculapian Snakes, these cat-faced
Pashts, this Isis, queen of heaven, and Astarte and Baal and Indra and
Agni and Kali and Demeter and the Virgin Mary and Apollo and Jesus
Christ

\[paragraph continues\] and Satan and the Holy Ghost, are only shadows
cast outwards onto a screen; the constitution of the human mind makes
them all tend to be anthropomorphic; but that is all; they each and all
inevitably ass away. Why waste time over them?"

And this is in a sense a perfectly fair way of looking at the matter.
These gods and creeds *are* only projections of the human mind. But all
the same it misses, does this view, the essential fact. It misses the
fact that there is no shadow without a fire, that the very existence of
a shadow argues a light somewhere (though we may not directly see it) as
well as the existence of a solid form which intercepts that light. Deep,
deep in the human mind there is that burning blazing light of the
world-consciousness--so deep indeed that the vast majority of
individuals are hardly aware of its existence. Their gaze turned
outwards is held and riveted by the gigantic figures and processions
passing across their sky; they are unaware that the latter are only
shadows--silhouettes of the forms inhabiting their own minds. <span
id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md) The vast majority of people have never
observed their own minds; their own mental forms. They have only
observed the reflections cast by these. Thus it may be said, in this
matter, that there are three degrees of reality. There are the mere
shadows--the least real and most evanescent; there are the actual mental
outlines of humanity (and of the individual), much more real, but
themselves also of course slowly changing; and most real of all, and
permanent, there is the light "which lighteth every man that cometh into
the world"--the glorious light of the world-consciousness. Of this last
it may be said that it never changes. Every thing is known to it--even
the very *impediments* to its shining. But as it is from the impediments
to the shining of a light that shadows are cast, so we now may
understand that

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

the things of this world and of humanity, though real in their degree,
have chiefly a kind of negative value; they are opaquenesses, clouds,
materialisms, ignorances, and the inner light falling upon them
gradually reveals their negative character and gradually dissolves them
away till they are lost in the extreme and eternal Splendor. I think
Jefferies, when he asked that question with which I have begun t is
chapter, was in some sense subconsciously, if not quite consciously,
aware of the answer. His frequent references to the burning blazing sun
throughout *The Story of the Heart* seem to be an indication of his real
deep-down attitude of mind.

The shadow-figures of the creeds and theogonies pass away truly like
ephemeral dreams; but to say that time spent in their study is wasted,
is a mistake, for they have value as being indications of things much
more real than themselves, namely, of the stages of evolution of the
human mind. The fact that a certain god-figure, however grotesque and
queer, or a certain creed, however childish, cruel, and illogical, held
sway for a considerable time over the hearts of men in any corner or
continent of the world is good evidence that it represented a real
formative urge at the time in the hearts of those good people, and a
definite stage in their evolution and the evolution of humanity.
Certainly it was destined to pass away, but it was a step, and a
necessary step in the great process; and certainly it was opaque and
brutish, but it is through the opaque things of the world, and not
through the transparent, that we become aware of the light.

It may be worth while to give instances of how some early rituals and
creeds, in themselves apparently barbarous or preposterous, were really
the indications of important moral and social conceptions evolving in
the heart of man. Let us take, first, the religious customs connected
with the ideas of Sacrifice and of Sin, of which such innumerable
examples are now to be found in the modern

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

books on Anthropology. If we assume, as I have done more than once, that
the earliest state of Man was one in which he did not consciously
separate himself from the world, animate and inanimate, which surrounded
him, then (as I have also said) it was perfectly natural for him to take
some animal which bulked large on his horizon--some food-animal for
instance--and to pay respect to it as the benefactor of his tribe, its
far-back ancestor and totem-symbol; or, seeing the boundless blessing of
the cornfields, to believe in some kind of spirit of the corn (not
exactly a god but rather a magical ghost) which, reincarnated every
year, sprang up to save mankind from famine. But then no sooner had he
done this than he was bound to perceive that in cutting down the corn or
in eating his totem-bear or kangaroo he was slaying his own best self
and benefactor. In that instant the consciousness of *disunity*, the
sense of sin in some undefined yet no less disturbing and alarming form
would come in. If, before, his ritual magic had been concentrated on the
simple purpose of multiplying the animal or, vegetable forms of his
food, now in addition his magical endeavor would be turned to averting
the just wrath of the spirits who animated these forms--just indeed, for
the rudest savage would perceive the wrong done and the probability of
its retribution. Clearly the wrong done could only be expiated by an
equivalent sacrifice of some kind on the part of the man, or the
tribe--that is by the offering to the totem-animal or to the corn-spirit
of some victim whom these nature powers in their turn could feed upon
and assimilate. In this way the nature-powers would be appeased, the
sense of unity would be restored, and the first At-one-ment effected.

It is hardly necessary to recite in any detail the cruel and hideous
sacrifices which have been perpetrated in this sense all over the world,
sometimes in appeasement of a wrong committed or supposed to have been
committed

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

by the tribe or some member of it, sometimes in placation or for the
averting of death, or defeat, or plague, sometimes merely in fulfilment
of some long-standing custom of forgotten origin--the flayings and
floggings and burnings and crucifixions of victims without end, carried
out in all deliberation and solemnity of established ritual. I have
mentioned some cases connected with the sowing of the corn. The Bible is
full of such things, from the intended sacrifice of Isaac by his father
Abraham, to the actual crucifixion of Jesus by the Jews. The first-born
sons were claimed by a god who called himself "jealous" and were only to
be redeemed by a substitute. <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md) Of
the Canaanites it was said that "even their daughters they have *burnt*
in the fire to their gods"; <span id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_119.md) and of
the King of Moab, that hen he saw his army in danger of defeat, "he took
his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead and offered him for
a burnt-offering on the wall!" <span id="fr_120"></span>[3](#fn_120.md) Dr.
Frazer <span id="fr_121"></span>[4](#fn_121.md) mentions the similar case
of the Carthaginians (about B.C. 300) sacrificing two hundred children
of good family as a propitiation to Baal and to save their beloved city
from the assaults of the Sicilian tyrant Agathocles. And even so we hear
that on that occasion three hundred more young folk *volunteered* to die
for the fatherland.

The awful sacrifices made by the Aztecs in Mexico to their gods
Huitzilopochtli, Texcatlipoca, and others are described in much detail
by Sahagun, the Spanish missionary of the sixteenth century. The victims
were mostly prisoners of war or young children; they were numbered by
thousands. In one case Sahagun describes the huge Idol or figure of the
god as largely plated with gold and holding his hands palm upward and in
a downward sloping position over a cauldron or furnace placed below. The

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

children, who had previously been borne in triumphal state on litters
over the crowd and decorated with every ornamental device of feathers
and flowers and wings, were placed one by one on the vast hands and
*rolled down* into the flames--as if the god were himself offering
them. <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122.md) As the procession approached
the temple, the members of it wept and danced and sang, and here again
the abundance of tears was taken for a good augury of rain. <span
id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_123.md)

Bernal Diaz describes how he saw one of these monstrous figures--that of
Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, all inlaid with gold and precious
stones; and beside it were "braziers, wherein burned the hearts of three
Indians, torn from their bodies that very day, and the smoke of them and
the savor of incense were the sacrifice."

Sahagun again (in Book II, ch. 5) gives a long account of the sacrifice
of a perfect youth at Easter-time--which date Sahagun connects with the
Christian festival of the Resurrection. For a whole year the youth had
been held in honor and adored by the people as the very image of the god
(Tetzcatlipoca) to whom he was to be sacrificed. Every luxury and
fulfilment of his last wish (including such four courtesans as he
desired) had been granted him. At the last and on the fatal day, leaving
his companions and his worshipers behind, be slowly ascended the Temple
staircase; stripping on each step the ornaments from his body; and
breaking and casting away his flutes and other musical instruments;

It is curious to find that exactly the same story (of the sloping hands
and the children rolled down into the flames) is related concerning the
above-mentioned Baal image at Carthage (see Diodorus Siculus, xx. 14;
also Baring Gould's *Religious Belief*, vol. i, p. 375).

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

till, reaching the summit, he was stretched, curved on his back, and
belly upwards, over the altar stone, while the priest with obsidian
knife cut his breast open and, snatching the heart out, held it up, yet
beating, as an offering to the Sun. In the meantime, and while the heart
still lived, his successor for the next year was chosen.

In Book II, ch. 7 of the same work Sahagun describes the similar
offering of a woman to a goddess. In both cases (he explains) of young
man or young woman, the victims were richly adorned in the guise of the
god or goddess to whom they were offered, and at the same time great
largesse of food was distributed to all who needed. \[Here we see the
connection in the general mind between the gift of food (by the gods)
and the sacrifice of precious blood (by the people).\] More than once
Sahagun mentions that the victims in these Mexican ceremonials not
infrequently offered *themselves* as a voluntary sacrifice; and Prescott
says <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md) that the offering of one's
life to the gods was "sometimes voluntarily embraced, as a most glorious
death opening a sure passage into Paradise."

Dr. Frazer describes <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125.md) the far-back
Babylonian festival of the Sacaea in which "a prisoner, condemned to
death, was dressed in the king's robes, seated on the king's throne,
allowed to issue whatever commands he pleased, to eat, drink and enjoy
himself, and even to lie with the king's concubines." But at the end of
the five days he was stripped of his royal robes, scourged, and hanged
or impaled. It is certainly astonishing to find customs so similar
prevailing among peoples so far removed in space and time as the Aztecs
of the sixteenth century A.D. and the Babylonians perhaps of the
sixteenth century B.C. But we know that this subject of the yearly
sacrifice of a victim

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

attired as a king or god is one that Dr. Frazer has especially made his
own, and for further information on it his classic work should be
consulted.

Andrew Lang also, with regard to the Aztecs, quotes largely from
Sahagun, and summarizes his conclusions in the following passage: "The
general theory of worship was the adoration of a deity, first by
innumerable human sacrifices, next by the special sacrifice of a *man*
for the male gods, of a *woman* for each goddess. <span
id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126.md) The latter victims were regarded as the
living images or incarnations of the divinities in, each case; for no
system of worship carried farther the identification of the god with the
sacrifice \[? victim\], and of both with the officiating priest. The
connection was emphasized by the priests wearing the newly-flayed skins
of the victims--just as in Greece, Egypt and Assyria, the fawn-skin or
bull-hide or goat-skin or fish-skin of the victims is worn by the
celebrants. Finally, an image of the god was made out of paste, and this
was divided into morsels and eaten in a hideous sacrament by those who
communicated." <span id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_127.md)

Revolting as this whole picture is, it represents as we know a mere
thumbnail sketch of the awful practices of human sacrifice all over the
world. We hold up our hands in horror at the thought of Huitzilopochtli
dropping children from his fingers into the flames, but we have to
remember that our own most Christian Saint Augustine was content to
describe unbaptized infants as crawling for ever about the floor of
Hell! What sort of god, we may ask, did

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Augustine worship? The Being who could condemn
children to such a fate was certainly no better than the Mexican Idol.

And yet Augustine was a great and noble man, with some by no means
unworthy conceptions of the greatness of his God. In the same way the
Aztecs were in many respects a refined and artistic people, and their
religion was not all superstition and bloodshed. Prescott says of
them <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_128.md) that they believed in a
supreme Creator and Lord "omnipresent, knowing all thoughts, giving all
gifts, without whom Man is as nothing--invisible, incorporeal, one God,
of perfect perfection and purity, under whose wings we find repose and a
sure defence." How can we reconcile St. Augustine with his own devilish
creed, or the religious belief of the Aztecs with their unspeakable
cruelties? Perhaps we can only reconcile them by remembering out of what
deeps of barbarism and what nightmares of haunting Fear, man has slowly
emerged--and is even now only slowly emerging; by remembering also that
the ancient ceremonies and rituals of Magic and Fear remained on and
were cultivated by the multitude in each nation long after the bolder
and nobler spirits had attained to breathe a purer air; by remembering
that even to the present day in each individual the Old and the New are
for a long period thus intricately intertangled. It is hard to believe
that the practice of human and animal sacrifice (with whatever revolting
details) should have been cultivated by nine-tenths of the human race
over the globe out of sheer perversity and without some reason which at
any rate to the perpetrators themselves appeared commanding and
convincing. To-day \[1918\] we are witnessing in the Great European War
a carnival of human slaughter which in magnitude and barbarity eclipses
in one stroke all the accumulated ceremonial sacrifices of historical
ages; and when we ask the why and wherefore of this

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

horrid spectacle we are told, apparently in all sincerity, and by both
the parties engaged, of the noble objects and commanding moralities
which inspire and compel it. We can hardly, in this last case,
disbelieve altogether in the genuineness of the plea, so why should we
do so in the former case? In both cases we perceive that underneath the
surface pretexts and moralities Fear is and was the great urging and
commanding force.

The truth is that Sin and Sacrifice represent--if you once allow for the
overwhelming sway of fear--perfectly reasonable views of human conduct,
adopted instinctively by mankind since the earliest times. If in a
moment of danger or an access of selfish greed you deserted your brother
tribesman or took a mean advantage of him, you 'sinned' against him; and
naturally you expiated the sin by an equivalent sacrifice of some kind
made to the one you had wronged. Such an idea and such a practice were
the very foundation of social life and human morality, and must have
sprung up as soon as ever, in the course of evolution, man became
*capable* of differentiating himself from his fellows and regarding his
own conduct as that of a 'separate self.' It was in the very conception
of a separate self that 'sin' and disunity first began; and it was by
'sacrifice' that unity and harmony were restored, appeasement and
atonement effected.

But in those earliest times, as I have already indicated more than once,
man felt himself intimately related not only to his brother tribesman,
but to the animals and to general Nature. It was not so much that he
*thought* thus as that he never thought *otherwise*! He *felt*
subconsciously that he was a part of all this outer world. And so he
adopted for his totems or presiding spirits every possible animal, as we
have seen, and all sorts of nature-phenomena, such as rain and fire and
water and clouds, and sun, moon and stars--which *we* consider quite
senseless and inanimate. Towards these apparently senseless things
therefore he

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

felt the same compunction as I have described him feeling towards his
brother tribesmen. He could sin against them too. He could sin against
his totem-animal by eating it; he could sin against his 'brother the ox'
by consuming its strength in the labor of the plough; he could sin
against the corn by cutting it down and grinding it into flour, or
against the precious and beautiful pine-tree by laying his axe to its
roots and converting it into mere timber for his house. Further still,
no doubt he could sin against elemental nature. This might be more
difficult to be certain of, but when the signs of elemental displeasure
were not to be mistaken--when the rain withheld itself for months, or
the storms and lightning dealt death and destruction, when the crops
failed or evil plagues afflicted mankind--then there could be little
uncertainty that he had sinned; and Fear, which had haunted him like a
demon from the first day when he became conscious of his separation from
his fellows and from Nature, stood over him and urged to dreadful
propitiations.

In all these cases some sacrifice in reparation was the obvious thing.
We have seen that to atone for the cutting-down of the corn a human
victim would often be slaughtered. The corn-spirit clearly approved of
this, for wherever the blood and remains of the victim were strewn the
corn always sprang up more plentifully. The tribe or human group made
reparation thus to the corn; the corn-spirit signified approval. The
'sin' was expiated and harmony restored. Sometimes the sacrifice was
voluntarily offered by a tribesman; sometimes it was enforced, by lot or
otherwise; sometimes the victim was a slave, or a captive enemy;
sometimes even an animal. All that did not so much matter. The main
thing was that the formal expiation had been carried out, and the wrath
of the spirits averted.

It is known that tribes whose chief food-animal was the bear felt it
necessary to kill and eat a bear occasionally;

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

but they could not do this without a sense of guilt, and some fear of
vengeance from the great Bear-spirit. So they ate the slain bear at a
communal feast in which the tribesmen shared the guilt and celebrated
their community with their totem and with each other. And since they
could not make any reparation directly to the slain animal itself
*after* its death, they made their reparation *before*, bringing all
sorts of presents and food to it for a long anterior period, and paying
every kind of worship and respect to it. The same with the bull and the
ox. At the festival of the Bouphonia, in some of the cities of Greece as
I have already mentioned, the actual bull sacrificed was the handsomest
and most carefully nurtured that could be obtained; it was crowned with
flowers and led in procession with every mark of reverence and worship.
And when--as I have already pointed out--at the great Spring festival,
instead of a bull or a goat or a ram, a *human* victim was immolated, it
was a custom (which can be traced very widely over the world) to feed
and indulge and honor the victim to the last degree for a *whole year*
before the final ceremony, arraying him often as a king and placing a
crown upon his head, by way of acknowledgment of the noble and necessary
work he was doing for the general good.

What a touching and beautiful ceremony was that--belonging especially to
the North of Syria, and lands where the pine is so beneficent and
beloved a tree--the mourning ceremony of the death and burial of Attis!
when a pine-tree, felled by the axe, was hollowed out, and in the hollow
an image (often itself carved out of pinewood) of the young Attis was
placed. Could any symbolism express more tenderly the idea that the
glorious youth--who represented Spring, too soon slain by the rude tusk
of Winter--was himself the very human soul of the pine-tree? <span
id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md) At

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

some earlier period, no doubt, a real youth had been sacrificed and his
body bound within the pine; but now it was deemed sufficient for the
maidens to sing their wild songs of lamentation; and for the priests and
male enthusiasts to cut and gash themselves with knives, or to sacrifice
(as they did) to the Earth-mother the precious blood offering of their
virile organs--symbols of fertility in return for the promised and
expected renewal of Nature and the crop in the coming Spring. For the
ceremony, as we have already seen, did not end with death and
lamentation, but led on, perfectly naturally, after a day or two to a
festival of resurrection, when it was discovered--just as in the case of
Osiris--that the pine-tree coffin was empty, and the immortal life had
flown. How strange the similarity and parallelism of all these things to
the story of Jesus in the Gospels--the sacrifice of a life made in order
to bring salvation to men and expiation of sins, the crowning of the
victim, and arraying in royal attire, the scourging and the mockery, the
binding or nailing to a tree, the tears of Mary, and the resurrection
and the empty coffin!--or how not at all strange when we consider in
what numerous forms and among how many peoples, this same parable and
ritual had as a matter of fact been celebrated, and how it had
ultimately come down to bring its message of redemption into a somewhat
obscure Syrian city, in the special shape with which we are familiar.

Though the parable or legend in its special Christian form bears with it
the consciousness of the presence of beings whom we may call gods, it is
important to remember

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

that in many or most of its earlier forms, though it dealt in
'spirits'--the spirit of the corn, or the spirit of the Spring, or the
spirits of the rain and the thunder, or the spirits of totem-animals--it
had not yet quite risen to the idea of gods. It had not risen to the
conception of eternal deities sitting apart and governing the world in
solemn conclave--as from the slopes of Olympus or the recesses of the
Christian Heaven. It belonged, in fact, in its inception, to the age of
Magic. The creed of Sin and Sacrifice, or of Guilt and
Expiation--whatever we like to call it--was evolved perfectly naturally
out of the human mind when brought face to face with Life and Nature) at
some early stage of its self-consciousness. It was essentially the
result of man's deep, original and instinctive sense of solidarity with
Nature, now denied and belied and to some degree broken up by the growth
and conscious insistence of the self-regarding impulses. It was the
consciousness of disharmony and disunity, causing men to feel all the
more poignantly the desire and the need of reconciliation. It was a
realization of union made clear by its very loss. It assumed of course,
in a subconscious way as I have already indicated, that the external
world was the *habitat* of a mind or minds similar to man's own; but
*that* being granted, it is evident that the particular theories current
in this or that place about the nature of the world--the theories, as we
should say, of science or theology--did not alter the general outlines
of the creed; they only colored its details and gave its ritual
different dramatic settings. The mental attitudes, for instance, of
Abraham sacrificing the ram, or of the Siberian *angakout* slaughtering
a totem-bear, or of a modern and pious Christian contemplating the
Saviour on the Cross are really almost exactly the same. I mention this
because in tracing the origins or the evolution of religions it is
important to distinguish clearly what is essential and universal from
that which is merely local and temporary.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Some people, no doubt, would be shocked at the
comparisons just made; but surely it is much more inspiriting and
encouraging to think that whatever progress *has* been made in the
religious outlook of the world has come about through the gradual mental
growth and consent of the peoples, rather than through some unique and
miraculous event of a rather arbitrary and unexplained character--which
indeed might never be repeated, and concerning which it would perhaps be
impious to suggest that it *should* be repeated.

The consciousness then of Sin (or of alienation from the life of the
whole), and of restoration or redemption through Sacrifice, seems to
have disclosed itself in the human race in very far-back times, and to
have symbolized itself in some most ancient rituals; and if we are
shocked sometimes at the barbarities which accompanied those rituals,
yet we must allow that these barbarities show how intensely the early
people felt the solemnity and importance of the whole matter; and we
must allow too that the barbarities did sear and burn themselves into
rude and ignorant minds with the sense of the *need* of Sacrifice, and
with a result perhaps which could not have been compassed in any other
way.

For after all we see now that sacrifice is of the very essence of social
life. "It is expedient that one man should die for the people"; and not
only that *one* man should actually die, but (what is far more
important) that each man should be ready and *willing* to die in that
cause, when the occasion and the need arises. Taken in its larger
meanings and implications Sacrifice, as conceived in the ancient world,
was a perfectly reasonable thing. It *should* pervade modern life more
than it does. All we have or enjoy flows from, or is implicated with,
pain and suffering in others, and--if there is any justice in Nature or
Humanity--it demands an equivalent readiness to suffer on our part. If
Christianity has any real

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

essence, that essence is perhaps expressed in some such ritual or
practice of Sacrifice, and we see that the dim beginnings of this idea
date from the far-back customs of savages coming down from a time
anterior to all recorded history.

llevábanlos en unas literas sobre los hombros, estas literas iban
adornadas con plumages y con flores: iban tañendo, cantando y bailando
delante de ellos . . . Cuando llevában los niños a matar, si llevában y
echaban muchos lagrimas, alegrabansi los que los llevában porque tomaban
pronostico de que habian de tener muchas aguas en aquel año." Sahagun,

<span id="fn_126"></span>[108:1](pcc08.htm#fr_126.md) Compare the festival
of *Thargelia* at Athens, originally connected with the ripening of the
crops. A procession was formed and the first fruits of the year offered
to Apollo, Artemis and the Horae. It was an expiatory feast, to purify
the State from all guilt and avert the wrath of the god \[the Sun\]. A
man and a woman, as representing the male and female population, were
led about with a garland of figs \[fertility\] round their necks, to the
sound of flutes and singing. They were then scourged, sacrificed, and
their bodies burned by the seashore. (Nettleship and Sandys.)

<span id="fn_129"></span>[112:1](pcc08.htm#fr_129.md) See Julius Firmicus,
who says (*De Errore*, c. 28): "in sacris Phrygiis, quæ Matris deum
dicunt, per annos singulos arbor pinea <span id="page_113">p. 113</span>
caeditur, et in media arbore simulacrum uvenis subligatur. In Isiacis
sacris de pinea arbore caeditur truncus; hujus trunci media pars
subtiliter excavatur, illis de segminibus factum idolum Osiridis
sepelitur. In Prosperpinæ sacris cæsa arbor in effigiem virginis
formaraque componitur, et cum intra civitatem fuerit illata, quadraginta
noctibus plangitur, quadragesima vero nocte comburitur."
