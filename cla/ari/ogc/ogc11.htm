<p>WE have explained under what conditions &#145;combination&#146;, &#145;contact&#146;, and &#145;action-passion&#146; are attributable to the things which undergo natural change. Further, we have discussed &#145;unqualified&#146; coming-to-be and passing-away, and explained under what conditions they are predicable, of what subject, and owing to what cause. Similarly, we have also discussed &#145;alteration&#146;, and explained what &#145;altering&#146; is and how it differs from coming-to-be and passing-away. But we have still to investigate the so-called &#145;elements&#146; of bodies.</p>  
<p>For the complex substances whose formation and maintenance are due to natural processes all presuppose the perceptible bodies as the condition of their coming-to-be and passing-away: but philosophers disagree in regard to the matter which underlies these perceptible bodies. Some maintain it is single, supposing it to be, e.g. Air or Fire, or an &#145;intermediate&#146; between these two (but still a body with a separate existence). Others, on the contrary, postulate two or more materials-ascribing to their &#145;association&#146; and &#145;dissociation&#146;, or to their &#145;alteration&#146;, the coming-to-be and passing-away of things. (Some, for instance, postulate Fire and Earth: some add Air, making three: and some, like Empedocles, reckon Water as well, thus postulating four.)</p>  
<p>Now we may agree that the primary materials, whose change (whether it be &#145;association and dissociation&#146; or a process of another kind) results in coming-to-be and passing-away, are rightly described as &#145;originative sources, i.e. elements&#146;. But (i) those thinkers are in error who postulate, beside the bodies we have mentioned, a single matter-and that corporeal and separable matter. For this &#145;body&#146; of theirs cannot possibly exist without a &#145;perceptible contrariety&#146;: this &#145;Boundless&#146;, which some thinkers identify with the &#145;original real&#146;, must be either light or heavy, either cold or hot. And (ii) what Plato has written in the Timaeus is not based on any precisely-articulated conception. For he has not stated clearly whether his &#145;Omnirecipient&#148; exists in separation from the &#145;elements&#146;; nor does he make any use of it. He says, indeed, that it is a substratum prior to the so-called &#145;elements&#146;-underlying them, as gold underlies the things that are fashioned of gold. (And yet this comparison, if thus expressed, is itself open to criticism. Things which come-to-be and pass-away cannot be called by the name of the material out of which they have come-to-be: it is only the results of &#145;alteration&#146; which retain the name of the substratum whose &#145;alterations&#146; they are. However, he actually says that the truest account is to affirm that each of them is &#147;gold&#148;.) Nevertheless he carries his analysis of the &#145;elements&#146;--solids though they are--back to &#145;planes&#146;, and it is impossible for &#145;the Nurse&#146; (i.e. the primary matter) to be identical with &#145;the planes&#146;.</p>  
<p>Our own doctrine is that although there is a matter of the perceptible bodies (a matter out of which the so-called &#145;elements&#146; come-to-be), it has no separate existence, but is always bound up with a contrariety. A more precise account of these presuppositions has been given in another work&#146;: we must, however, give a detailed explanation of the primary bodies as well, since they too are similarly derived from the matter. We must reckon as an &#145;originative source&#146; and as &#145;primary&#146; the matter which underlies, though it is inseparable from, the contrary qualities: for the hot&#146; is not matter for &#145;the cold&#146; nor &#145;the cold&#146; for &#145;the hot&#146;, but the substratum is matter for them both. We therefore have to recognize three &#145;originative sources&#146;: firstly that which potentially perceptible body, secondly the contrarieties (I mean, e.g. heat and cold), and thirdly Fire, Water, and the like. Only &#145;thirdly&#146;, however: for these bodies change into one another (they are not immutable as Empedocles and other thinkers assert, since &#145;alteration&#146; would then have been impossible), whereas the contrarieties do not change.</p>  
<p>Nevertheless, even so the question remains: What sorts of contrarieties, and how many of them, are to be accounted &#145;originative sources&#146; of body? For all the other thinkers assume and use them without explaining why they are these or why they are just so many.</p>
