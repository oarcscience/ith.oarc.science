### Chapter 11.

#### Judgement--right discrimination of the equitable: the place of intuition in morals.

What is called judgement, in virtue of which men are said to 'be
sympathetic judges' and to 'have judgement', is the right discrimination
of the equitable. This is shown by the fact that we say the equitable
man is above all others a man of sympathetic judgement, and identify
equity with sympathetic judgement about certain facts. And sympathetic
judgement is judgement which discriminates what is equitable and does so
correctly; and correct judgement is that which judges what is true.

Now all the states we have considered converge, as might be expected, to
the same point; for when we speak of judgement and understanding and
practical wisdom and intuitive reason we credit the same people with
possessing judgement and having reached years of reason and with having
practical wisdom and understanding. For all these faculties deal with
ultimates, i.e. with particulars; and being a man of understanding and
of good or sympathetic judgement consists in being able judge about the
things with which practical wisdom is concerned; for the equities are
common to all good men in relation to other men. Now all things which
have to be done are included among particulars or ultimates; for not
only must the man of practical wisdom know particular facts, but
understanding and judgement are also concerned with things to be done,
and these are ultimates. And intuitive reason is concerned with the
ultimates in both directions; for both the first terms and the last are
objects of intuitive reason and not of argument, and the intuitive
reason which is presupposed by demonstrations grasps the unchangeable
and first terms, while the intuitive reason involved in practical
reasonings grasps the last and variable fact, i.e. the minor premiss.
For these variable facts are the starting-points for the apprehension of
the end, since the universals are reached from the particulars; of these
therefore we must have perception, and this perception is intuitive
reason.

This is why these states are thought to be natural endowments--why,
while no one is thought to be a philosopher by nature, people are
thought to have by nature judgement, understanding, and intuitive
reason. This is shown by the fact that we think our powers correspond to
our time of life, and that a particular age brings with it intuitive
reason and judgement; this implies that nature is the cause. (Hence
intuitive reason is both beginning and end; for demonstrations are from
these and about these.) Therefore we ought to attend to the
undemonstrated sayings and opinions of experienced and older people or
of people of practical wisdom not less than to demonstrations; for
because experience has given them an eye they see aright.

We have stated, then, what practical and philosophic wisdom are, and
with what each of them is concerned, and we have said that each is the
virtue of a different part of the soul.
