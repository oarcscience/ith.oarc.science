<A HREF="nico004.htm">Chapter 4. The good is generally agreed to be happiness, but there are various views as to what happiness is. What is required at the start is an unreasoned  conviction about the facts, such as is produced by a good upbringing</A><BR>

<A HREF="nico016.htm">Chapter 3. Pleasure in doing virtuous acts is a sign that the virtuous disposition has been acquired: a variety of considerations show the essential connexion of moral virtue with pleasure and pain</A><BR>
<A HREF="nico017.htm">Chapter 4. The actions that produce moral virtue are not good in the same sense as those that flow from it: the latter must fulfil certain conditions not necessary in the case of the arts</A><BR>
