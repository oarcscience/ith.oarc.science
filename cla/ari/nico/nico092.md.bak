### Chapter 11

#### Corresponding forms of friendship, and of justice.

Each of the constitutions may be seen to involve friendship just in so
far as it involves justice. The friendship between a king and his
subjects depends on an excess of benefits conferred; for he confers
benefits on his subjects if being a good man he cares for them with a
view to their well-being, as a shepherd does for his sheep (whence Homer
called Agamemnon 'shepherd of the peoples'). Such too is the friendship
of a father, though this exceeds the other in the greatness of the
benefits conferred; for he is responsible for the existence of his
children, which is thought the greatest good, and for their nurture and
upbringing.

These things are ascribed to ancestors as well. Further, by nature a
father tends to rule over his sons, ancestors over descendants, a king
over his subjects. These friendships imply superiority of one party over
the other, which is why ancestors are honoured. The justice therefore
that exists between persons so related is not the same on both sides but
is in every case proportioned to merit; for that is true of the
friendship as well. The friendship of man and wife, again, is the same
that is found in an aristocracy; for it is in accordance with virtue the
better gets more of what is good, and each gets what befits him; and so,
too, with the justice in these relations. The friendship of brothers is
like that of comrades; for they are equal and of like age, and such
persons are for the most part like in their feelings and their
character. Like this, too, is the friendship appropriate to timocratic
government; for in such a constitution the ideal is for the citizens to
be equal and fair; therefore rule is taken in turn, and on equal terms;
and the friendship appropriate here will correspond.

But in the deviation-forms, as justice hardly exists, so too does
friendship. It exists least in the worst form; in tyranny there is
little or no friendship. For where there is nothing common to ruler and
ruled, there is not friendship either, since there is not justice; e.g.
between craftsman and tool, soul and body, master and slave; the latter
in each case is benefited by that which uses it, but there is no
friendship nor justice towards lifeless things. But neither is there
friendship towards a horse or an ox, nor to a slave qua slave. For there
is nothing common to the two parties; the slave is a living tool and the
tool a lifeless slave. Qua slave then, one cannot be friends with him.
But qua man one can; for there seems to be some justice between any man
and any other who can share in a system of law or be a party to an
agreement; therefore there can also be friendship with him in so far as
he is a man. Therefore while in tyrannies friendship and justice hardly
exist, in democracies they exist more fully; for where the citizens are
equal they have much in common.
