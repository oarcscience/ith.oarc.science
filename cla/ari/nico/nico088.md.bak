### Chapter 7.

#### In unequal friendships a proportion must be maintained.

But there is another kind of friendship, viz. that which involves an
inequality between the parties, e.g. that of father to son and in
general of elder to younger, that of man to wife and in general that of
ruler to subject. And these friendships differ also from each other; for
it is not the same that exists between parents and children and between
rulers and subjects, nor is even that of father to son the same as that
of son to father, nor that of husband to wife the same as that of wife
to husband. For the virtue and the function of each of these is
different, and so are the reasons for which they love; the love and the
friendship are therefore different also. Each party, then, neither gets
the same from the other, nor ought to seek it; but when children render
to parents what they ought to render to those who brought them into the
world, and parents render what they should to their children, the
friendship of such persons will be abiding and excellent. In all
friendships implying inequality the love also should be proportional,
i.e. the better should be more loved than he loves, and so should the
more useful, and similarly in each of the other cases; for when the love
is in proportion to the merit of the parties, then in a sense arises
equality, which is certainly held to be characteristic of friendship.

But equality does not seem to take the same form in acts of justice and
in friendship; for in acts of justice what is equal in the primary sense
is that which is in proportion to merit, while quantitative equality is
secondary, but in friendship quantitative equality is primary and
proportion to merit secondary. This becomes clear if there is a great
interval in respect of virtue or vice or wealth or anything else between
the parties; for then they are no longer friends, and do not even expect
to be so. And this is most manifest in the case of the gods; for they
surpass us most decisively in all good things. But it is clear also in
the case of kings; for with them, too, men who are much their inferiors
do not expect to be friends; nor do men of no account expect to be
friends with the best or wisest men. In such cases it is not possible to
define exactly up to what point friends can remain friends; for much can
be taken away and friendship remain, but when one party is removed to a
great distance, as God is, the possibility of friendship ceases. This is
in fact the origin of the question whether friends really wish for their
friends the greatest goods, e.g. that of being gods; since in that case
their friends will no longer be friends to them, and therefore will not
be good things for them (for friends are good things). The answer is
that if we were right in saying that friend wishes good to friend for
his sake, his friend must remain the sort of being he is, whatever that
may be; therefore it is for him oily so long as he remains a man that he
will wish the greatest goods. But perhaps not all the greatest goods;
for it is for himself most of all that each man wishes what is good.
