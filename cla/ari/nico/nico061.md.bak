### Chapter 7.

#### Philosophic wisdom--the union of intuitive reason and science.

Wisdom (1) in the arts we ascribe to their most finished exponents, e.g.
to Phidias as a sculptor and to Polyclitus as a maker of
portrait-statues, and here we mean nothing by wisdom except excellence
in art; but (2) we think that some people are wise in general, not in
some particular field or in any other limited respect, as Homer says in
the Margites,

Him did the gods make neither a digger nor yet a ploughman  
Nor wise in anything else.

Therefore wisdom must plainly be the most finished of the forms of
knowledge. It follows that the wise man must not only know what follows
from the first principles, but must also possess truth about the first
principles. Therefore wisdom must be intuitive reason combined with
scientific knowledge--scientific knowledge of the highest objects which
has received as it were its proper completion.

Of the highest objects, we say; for it would be strange to think that
the art of politics, or practical wisdom, is the best knowledge, since
man is not the best thing in the world. Now if what is healthy or good
is different for men and for fishes, but what is white or straight is
always the same, any one would say that what is wise is the same but
what is practically wise is different; for it is to that which observes
well the various matters concerning itself that one ascribes practical
wisdom, and it is to this that one will entrust such matters. This is
why we say that some even of the lower animals have practical wisdom,
viz. those which are found to have a power of foresight with regard to
their own life. It is evident also that philosophic wisdom and the art
of politics cannot be the same; for if the state of mind concerned with
a man's own interests is to be called philosophic wisdom, there will be
many philosophic wisdoms; there will not be one concerned with the good
of all animals (any more than there is one art of medicine for all
existing things), but a different philosophic wisdom about the good of
each species.

But if the argument be that man is the best of the animals, this makes
no difference; for there are other things much more divine in their
nature even than man, e.g., most conspicuously, the bodies of which the
heavens are framed. From what has been said it is plain, then, that
philosophic wisdom is scientific knowledge, combined with intuitive
reason, of the things that are highest by nature. This is why we say
Anaxagoras, Thales, and men like them have philosophic but not practical
wisdom, when we see them ignorant of what is to their own advantage, and
why we say that they know things that are remarkable, admirable,
difficult, and divine, but useless; viz. because it is not human goods
that they seek.

Practical wisdom on the other hand is concerned with things human and
things about which it is possible to deliberate; for we say this is
above all the work of the man of practical wisdom, to deliberate well,
but no one deliberates about things invariable, nor about things which
have not an end, and that a good that can be brought about by action.
The man who is without qualification good at deliberating is the man who
is capable of aiming in accordance with calculation at the best for man
of things attainable by action. Nor is practical wisdom concerned with
universals only--it must also recognize the particulars; for it is
practical, and practice is concerned with particulars. This is why some
who do not know, and especially those who have experience, are more
practical than others who know; for if a man knew that light meats are
digestible and wholesome, but did not know which sorts of meat are
light, he would not produce health, but the man who knows that chicken
is wholesome is more likely to produce health.

Now practical wisdom is concerned with action; therefore one should have
both forms of it, or the latter in preference to the former. But of
practical as of philosophic wisdom there must be a controlling kind.
