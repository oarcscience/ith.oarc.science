# Book I: The Good for Man

### Chapter 1.

#### All human activities aim at some good: some goods subordinate to others.

EVERY art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is
thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly
been declared to be that at which all things aim. But a certain
difference is found among ends; some are activities, others are products
apart from the activities that produce them. Where there are ends apart
from the actions, it is the nature of the products to be better than the
activities. Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their
ends also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of
shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity--as
bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses
fall under the art of riding, and this and every military action under
strategy, in the same way other arts fall under yet others--in all of
these the ends of the master arts are to be preferred to all the
subordinate ends; for it is for the sake of the former that the latter
are pursued. It makes no difference whether the activities themselves
are the ends of the actions, or something else apart from the
activities, as in the case of the sciences just mentioned.
