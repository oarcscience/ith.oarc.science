### Chapter 4.

#### Rectificatory justice, in accordance with arithmetical progression.

\(B\) The remaining one is the rectificatory, which arises in connexion
with transactions both voluntary and involuntary. This form of the just
has a different specific character from the former. For the justice
which distributes common possessions is always in accordance with the
kind of proportion mentioned above (for in the case also in which the
distribution is made from the common funds of a partnership it will be
according to the same ratio which the funds put into the business by the
partners bear to one another); and the injustice opposed to this kind of
justice is that which violates the proportion. But the justice in
transactions between man and man is a sort of equality indeed, and the
injustice a sort of inequality; not according to that kind of
proportion, however, but according to arithmetical proportion. For it
makes no difference whether a good man has defrauded a bad man or a bad
man a good one, nor whether it is a good or a bad man that has committed
adultery; the law looks only to the distinctive character of the injury,
and treats the parties as equal, if one is in the wrong and the other is
being wronged, and if one inflicted injury and the other has received
it. Therefore, this kind of injustice being an inequality, the judge
tries to equalize it; for in the case also in which one has received and
the other has inflicted a wound, or one has slain and the other been
slain, the suffering and the action have been unequally distributed; but
the judge tries to equalize by means of the penalty, taking away from
the gain of the assailant. For the term 'gain' is applied generally to
such cases, even if it be not a term appropriate to certain cases, e.g.
to the person who inflicts a woundand 'loss' to the sufferer; at all
events when the suffering has been estimated, the one is called loss and
the other gain. Therefore the equal is intermediate between the greater
and the less, but the gain and the loss are respectively greater and
less in contrary ways; more of the good and less of the evil are gain,
and the contrary is loss; intermediate between them is, as we saw,
equal, which we say is just; therefore corrective justice will be the
intermediate between loss and gain. This is why, when people dispute,
they take refuge in the judge; and to go to the judge is to go to
justice; for the nature of the judge is to be a sort of animate justice;
and they seek the judge as an intermediate, and in some states they call
judges mediators, on the assumption that if they get what is
intermediate they will get what is just. The just, then, is an
intermediate, since the judge is so. Now the judge restores equality; it
is as though there were a line divided into unequal parts, and he took
away that by which the greater segment exceeds the half, and added it to
the smaller segment. And when the whole has been equally divided, then
they say they have 'their own'--i.e. when they have got what is equal.
The equal is intermediate between the greater and the lesser line
according to arithmetical proportion. It is for this reason also that it
is called just (sikaion), because it is a division into two equal parts
(sicha), just as if one were to call it sichaion; and the judge
(sikastes) is one who bisects (sichastes). For when something is
subtracted from one of two equals and added to the other, the other is
in excess by these two; since if what was taken from the one had not
been added to the other, the latter would have been in excess by one
only. It therefore exceeds the intermediate by one, and the intermediate
exceeds by one that from which something was taken. By this, then, we
shall recognize both what we must subtract from that which has more, and
what we must add to that which has less; we must add to the latter that
by which the intermediate exceeds it, and subtract from the greatest
that by which it exceeds the intermediate. Let the lines AA', BB', CC'
be equal to one another; from the line AA' let the segment AE have been
subtracted, and to the line CC' let the segment CD have been added, so
that the whole line DCC' exceeds the line EA' by the segment CD and the
segment CF; therefore it exceeds the line BB' by the segment CD. (See
diagram.)

These names, both loss and gain, have come from voluntary exchange; for
to have more than one's own is called gaining, and to have less than
one's original share is called losing, e.g. in buying and selling and in
all other matters in which the law has left people free to make their
own terms; but when they get neither more nor less but just what belongs
to themselves, they say that they have their own and that they neither
lose nor gain.

Therefore the just is intermediate between a sort of gain and a sort of
loss, viz. those which are involuntary; it consists in having an equal
amount before and after the transaction.
