### Chapter 12.

#### Virtue is praiseworthy, but happiness is above praise.

These questions having been definitely answered, let us consider whether
happiness is among the things that are praised or rather among the
things that are prized; for clearly it is not to be placed among
potentialities. Everything that is praised seems to be praised because
it is of a certain kind and is related somehow to something else; for we
praise the just or brave man and in general both the good man and virtue
itself because of the actions and functions involved, and we praise the
strong man, the good runner, and so on, because he is of a certain kind
and is related in a certain way to something good and important. This is
clear also from the praises of the gods; for it seems absurd that the
gods should be referred to our standard, but this is done because praise
involves a reference, to something else. But if if praise is for things
such as we have described, clearly what applies to the best things is
not praise, but something greater and better, as is indeed obvious; for
what we do to the gods and the most godlike of men is to call them
blessed and happy. And so too with good things; no one praises happiness
as he does justice, but rather calls it blessed, as being something more
divine and better.

Eudoxus also seems to have been right in his method of advocating the
supremacy of pleasure; he thought that the fact that, though a good, it
is not praised indicated it to be better than the things that are
praised, and that this is what God and the good are; for by reference to
these all other things are judged. Praise is appropriate to virtue, for
as a result of virtue men tend to do noble deeds, but encomia are
bestowed on acts, whether of the body or of the soul. But perhaps nicety
in these matters is more proper to those who have made a study of
encomia; to us it is clear from what has been said that happiness is
among the things that are prized and perfect. It seems to be so also
from the fact that it is a first principle; for it is for the sake of
this that we all do all that we do, and the first principle and cause of
goods is, we claim, something prized and divine.
