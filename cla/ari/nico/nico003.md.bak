### Chapter 3.

#### We must not expect more precision than the subject-matter admits. The student should have reached years of discretion.

Our discussion will be adequate if it has as much clearness as the
subject-matter admits of, for precision is not to be sought for alike in
all discussions, any more than in all the products of the crafts. Now
fine and just actions, which political science investigates, admit of
much variety and fluctuation of opinion, so that they may be thought to
exist only by convention, and not by nature. And goods also give rise to
a similar fluctuation because they bring harm to many people; for before
now men have been undone by reason of their wealth, and others by reason
of their courage. We must be content, then, in speaking of such subjects
and with such premisses to indicate the truth roughly and in outline,
and in speaking about things which are only for the most part true and
with premisses of the same kind to reach conclusions that are no better.
In the same spirit, therefore, should each type of statement be
received; for it is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in
each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits; it
is evidently equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a
mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician scientific proofs.

Now each man judges well the things he knows, and of these he is a good
judge. And so the man who has been educated in a subject is a good judge
of that subject, and the man who has received an all-round education is
a good judge in general. Hence a young man is not a proper hearer of
lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the actions
that occur in life, but its discussions start from these and are about
these; and, further, since he tends to follow his passions, his study
will be vain and unprofitable, because the end aimed at is not knowledge
but action. And it makes no difference whether he is young in years or
youthful in character; the defect does not depend on time, but on his
living, and pursuing each successive object, as passion directs. For to
such persons, as to the incontinent, knowledge brings no profit; but to
those who desire and act in accordance with a rational principle
knowledge about such matters will be of great benefit.

These remarks about the student, the sort of treatment to be expected,
and the purpose of the inquiry, may be taken as our preface.

there are various views as to what happiness is. What is required at the
start is an unreasoned conviction about the facts, such as is produced
by a good upbringing](nico004.md)
