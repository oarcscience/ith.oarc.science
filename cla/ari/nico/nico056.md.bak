### Chapter 2.

#### The object of the former is truth, that of the latter truth corresponding with right desire.

The virtue of a thing is relative to its proper work. Now there are
three things in the soul which control action and truth--sensation,
reason, desire.

Of these sensation originates no action; this is plain from the fact
that the lower animals have sensation but no share in action.

What affirmation and negation are in thinking, pursuit and avoidance are
in desire; so that since moral virtue is a state of character concerned
with choice, and choice is deliberate desire, therefore both the
reasoning must be true and the desire right, if the choice is to be
good, and the latter must pursue just what the former asserts. Now this
kind of intellect and of truth is practical; of the intellect which is
contemplative, not practical nor productive, the good and the bad state
are truth and falsity respectively (for this is the work of everything
intellectual); while of the part which is practical and intellectual the
good state is truth in agreement with right desire.

The origin of action--its efficient, not its final cause--is choice, and
that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an end. This is
why choice cannot exist either without reason and intellect or without a
moral state; for good action and its opposite cannot exist without a
combination of intellect and character. Intellect itself, however, moves
nothing, but only the intellect which aims at an end and is practical;
for this rules the productive intellect, as well, since every one who
makes makes for an end, and that which is made is not an end in the
unqualified sense (but only an end in a particular relation, and the end
of a particular operation)--only that which is done is that; for good
action is an end, and desire aims at this. Hence choice is either
desiderative reason or ratiocinative desire, and such an origin of
action is a man. (It is to be noted that nothing that is past is an
object of choice, e.g. no one chooses to have sacked Troy; for no one
deliberates about the past, but about what is future and capable of
being otherwise, while what is past is not capable of not having taken
place; hence Agathon is right in saying

For this alone is lacking even to God,  
To make undone things that have once been done.)

The work of both the intellectual parts, then, is truth. Therefore the
states that are most strictly those in respect of which each of these
parts will reach truth are the virtues of the two parts.
