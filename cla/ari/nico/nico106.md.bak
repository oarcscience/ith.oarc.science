### Chapter 11.

#### Are friends more needed in good or in bad fortune?

Do we need friends more in good fortune or in bad? They are sought after
in both; for while men in adversity need help, in prosperity they need
people to live with and to make the objects of their beneficence; for
they wish to do well by others. Friendship, then, is more necessary in
bad fortune, and so it is useful friends that one wants in this case;
but it is more noble in good fortune, and so we also seek for good men
as our friends, since it is more desirable to confer benefits on these
and to live with these. For the very presence of friends is pleasant
both in good fortune and also in bad, since grief is lightened when
friends sorrow with us. Hence one might ask whether they share as it
were our burden, or--without that happening--their presence by its
pleasantness, and the thought of their grieving with us, make our pain
less. Whether it is for these reasons or for some other that our grief
is lightened, is a question that may be dismissed; at all events what we
have described appears to take place.

But their presence seems to contain a mixture of various factors. The
very seeing of one's friends is pleasant, especially if one is in
adversity, and becomes a safeguard against grief (for a friend tends to
comfort us both by the sight of him and by his words, if he is tactful,
since he knows our character and the things that please or pain us); but
to see him pained at our misfortunes is painful; for every one shuns
being a cause of pain to his friends. For this reason people of a manly
nature guard against making their friends grieve with them, and, unless
he be exceptionally insensible to pain, such a man cannot stand the pain
that ensues for his friends, and in general does not admit
fellow-mourners because he is not himself given to mourning; but women
and womanly men enjoy sympathisers in their grief, and love them as
friends and companions in sorrow. But in all things one obviously ought
to imitate the better type of person.

On the other hand, the presence of friends in our prosperity implies
both a pleasant passing of our time and the pleasant thought of their
pleasure at our own good fortune. For this cause it would seem that we
ought to summon our friends readily to share our good fortunes (for the
beneficent character is a noble one), but summon them to our bad
fortunes with hesitation; for we ought to give them as little a share as
possible in our evils whence the saying 'enough is my misfortune'. We
should summon friends to us most of all when they are likely by
suffering a few inconveniences to do us a great service.

Conversely, it is fitting to go unasked and readily to the aid of those
in adversity (for it is characteristic of a friend to render services,
and especially to those who are in need and have not demanded them; such
action is nobler and pleasanter for both persons); but when our friends
are prosperous we should join readily in their activities (for they need
friends for these too), but be tardy in coming forward to be the objects
of their kindness; for it is not noble to be keen to receive benefits.
Still, we must no doubt avoid getting the reputation of kill--joys by
repulsing them; for that sometimes happens.

The presence of friends, then, seems desirable in all circumstances.
