### Chapter 10.

#### Practical wisdom is not compatible with incontinence, but cleverness is.

Nor can the same man have practical wisdom and be incontinent; for it
has been shown' that a man is at the same time practically wise, and
good in respect of character. Further, a man has practical wisdom not by
knowing only but by being able to act; but the incontinent man is unable
to act--there is, however, nothing to prevent a clever man from being
incontinent; this is why it is sometimes actually thought that some
people have practical wisdom but are incontinent, viz. because
cleverness and practical wisdom differ in the way we have described in
our first discussions, and are near together in respect of their
reasoning, but differ in respect of their purpose--nor yet is the
incontinent man like the man who knows and is contemplating a truth, but
like the man who is asleep or drunk. And he acts willingly (for he acts
in a sense with knowledge both of what he does and of the end to which
he does it), but is not wicked, since his purpose is good; so that he is
half-wicked. And he is not a criminal; for he does not act of malice
aforethought; of the two types of incontinent man the one does not abide
by the conclusions of his deliberation, while the excitable man does not
deliberate at all. And thus the incontinent man like a city which passes
all the right decrees and has good laws, but makes no use of them, as in
Anaxandrides' jesting remark,

The city willed it, that cares nought for laws;

but the wicked man is like a city that uses its laws, but has wicked
laws to use.

Now incontinence and continence are concerned with that which is in
excess of the state characteristic of most men; for the continent man
abides by his resolutions more and the incontinent man less than most
men can.

Of the forms of incontinence, that of excitable people is more curable
than that of those who deliberate but do not abide by their decisions,
and those who are incontinent through habituation are more curable than
those in whom incontinence is innate; for it is easier to change a habit
than to change one's nature; even habit is hard to change just because
it is like nature, as Evenus says:

I say that habit's but a long practice, friend,  
And this becomes men's nature in the end.

We have now stated what continence, incontinence, endurance, and
softness are, and how these states are related to each other.
