### Chapter 6.

#### Its differentia: it is a disposition to choose the mean.

We must, however, not only describe virtue as a state of character, but
also say what sort of state it is. We may remark, then, that every
virtue or excellence both brings into good condition the thing of which
it is the excellence and makes the work of that thing be done well; e.g.
the excellence of the eye makes both the eye and its work good; for it
is by the excellence of the eye that we see well. Similarly the
excellence of the horse makes a horse both good in itself and good at
running and at carrying its rider and at awaiting the attack of the
enemy. Therefore, if this is true in every case, the virtue of man also
will be the state of character which makes a man good and which makes
him do his own work well.

How this is to happen we have stated already, but it will be made plain
also by the following consideration of the specific nature of virtue. In
everything that is continuous and divisible it is possible to take more,
less, or an equal amount, and that either in terms of the thing itself
or relatively to us; and the equal is an intermediate between excess and
defect. By the intermediate in the object I mean that which is
equidistant from each of the extremes, which is one and the same for all
men; by the intermediate relatively to us that which is neither too much
nor too little--and this is not one, nor the same for all. For instance,
if ten is many and two is few, six is the intermediate, taken in terms
of the object; for it exceeds and is exceeded by an equal amount; this
is intermediate according to arithmetical proportion. But the
intermediate relatively to us is not to be taken so; if ten pounds are
too much for a particular person to eat and two too little, it does not
follow that the trainer will order six pounds; for this also is perhaps
too much for the person who is to take it, or too little--too little for
Milo, too much for the beginner in athletic exercises. The same is true
of running and wrestling. Thus a master of any art avoids excess and
defect, but seeks the intermediate and chooses this--the intermediate
not in the object but relatively to us.

If it is thus, then, that every art does its work well--by looking to
the intermediate and judgling its works by this standard (so that we
often say of good works of art that it is not possible either to take
away or to add anything, implying that excess and defect destroy the
goodness of works of art, while the mean preserves it; and good artists,
as we say, look to this in their work), and if, further, virtue is more
exact and better than any art, as nature also is, then virtue must have
the quality of aiming at the intermediate. I mean moral virtue; for it
is this that is concerned with passions and actions, and in these there
is excess, defect, and the intermediate. For instance, both fear and
confidence and appetite and anger and pity and in general pleasure and
pain may be felt both too much and too little, and in both cases not
well; but to feel them at the right times, with reference to the right
objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the
right way, is what is both intermediate and best, and this is
characteristic of virtue. Similarly with regard to actions also there is
excess, defect, and the intermediate. Now virtue is concerned with
passions and actions, in which excess is a form of failure, and so is
defect, while the intermediate is praised and is a form of success; and
being praised and being successful are both characteristics of virtue.
Therefore virtue is a kind of mean, since, as we have seen, it aims at
what is intermediate.

Again, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to the
class of the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good to
that of the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one way (for
which reason also one is easy and the other difficult--to miss the mark
easy, to hit it difficult); for these reasons also, then, excess and
defect are characteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue;

For men are good in but one way, but bad in many.

Virtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying in a
mean, i.e. the mean relative to us, this being determined by a rational
principle, and by that principle by which the man of practical wisdom
would determine it. Now it is a mean between two vices, that which
depends on excess and that which depends on defect; and again it is a
mean because the vices respectively fall short of or exceed what is
right in both passions and actions, while virtue both finds and chooses
that which is intermediate. Hence in respect of its substance and the
definition which states its essence virtue is a mean, with regard to
what is best and right an extreme.

But not every action nor every passion admits of a mean; for some have
names that already imply badness, e.g. spite, shamelessness, envy, and
in the case of actions adultery, theft, murder; for all of these and
suchlike things imply by their names that they are themselves bad, and
not the excesses or deficiencies of them. It is not possible, then, ever
to be right with regard to them; one must always be wrong. Nor does
goodness or badness with regard to such things depend on committing
adultery with the right woman, at the right time, and in the right way,
but simply to do any of them is to go wrong. It would be equally absurd,
then, to expect that in unjust, cowardly, and voluptuous action there
should be a mean, an excess, and a deficiency; for at that rate there
would be a mean of excess and of deficiency, an excess of excess, and a
deficiency of deficiency. But as there is no excess and deficiency of
temperance and courage because what is intermediate is in a sense an
extreme, so too of the actions we have mentioned there is no mean nor
any excess and deficiency, but however they are done they are wrong; for
in general there is neither a mean of excess and deficiency, nor excess
and deficiency of a mean.
