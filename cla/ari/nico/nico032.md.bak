### Chapter 10.

#### Temperance is limited to certain pleasures of touch.

After courage let us speak of temperance; for these seem to be the
virtues of the irrational parts. We have said that temperance is a mean
with regard to pleasures (for it is less, and not in the same way,
concerned with pains); self-indulgence also is manifested in the same
sphere. Now, therefore, let us determine with what sort of pleasures
they are concerned. We may assume the distinction between bodily
pleasures and those of the soul, such as love of honour and love of
learning; for the lover of each of these delights in that of which he is
a lover, the body being in no way affected, but rather the mind; but men
who are concerned with such pleasures are called neither temperate nor
self-indulgent. Nor, again, are those who are concerned with the other
pleasures that are not bodily; for those who are fond of hearing and
telling stories and who spend their days on anything that turns up are
called gossips, but not self-indulgent, nor are those who are pained at
the loss of money or of friends.

Temperance must be concerned with bodily pleasures, but not all even of
these; for those who delight in objects of vision, such as colours and
shapes and painting, are called neither temperate nor self-indulgent;
yet it would seem possible to delight even in these either as one should
or to excess or to a deficient degree.

And so too is it with objects of hearing; no one calls those who delight
extravagantly in music or acting self-indulgent, nor those who do so as
they ought temperate.

Nor do we apply these names to those who delight in odour, unless it be
incidentally; we do not call those self-indulgent who delight in the
odour of apples or roses or incense, but rather those who delight in the
odour of unguents or of dainty dishes; for self-indulgent people delight
in these because these remind them of the objects of their appetite. And
one may see even other people, when they are hungry, delighting in the
smell of food; but to delight in this kind of thing is the mark of the
self-indulgent man; for these are objects of appetite to him.

Nor is there in animals other than man any pleasure connected with these
senses, except incidentally. For dogs do not delight in the scent of
hares, but in the eating of them, but the scent told them the hares were
there; nor does the lion delight in the lowing of the ox, but in eating
it; but he perceived by the lowing that it was near, and therefore
appears to delight in the lowing; and similarly he does not delight
because he sees 'a stag or a wild goat', but because he is going to make
a meal of it. Temperance and self-indulgence, however, are concerned
with the kind of pleasures that the other animals share in, which
therefore appear slavish and brutish; these are touch and taste. But
even of taste they appear to make little or no use; for the business of
taste is the discriminating of flavours, which is done by winetasters
and people who season dishes; but they hardly take pleasure in making
these discriminations, or at least self-indulgent people do not, but in
the actual enjoyment, which in all cases comes through touch, both in
the case of food and in that of drink and in that of sexual intercourse.
This is why a certain gourmand prayed that his throat might become
longer than a crane's, implying that it was the contact that he took
pleasure in. Thus the sense with which self-indulgence is connected is
the most widely shared of the senses; and self-indulgence would seem to
be justly a matter of reproach, because it attaches to us not as men but
as animals. To delight in such things, then, and to love them above all
others, is brutish. For even of the pleasures of touch the most liberal
have been eliminated, e.g. those produced in the gymnasium by rubbing
and by the consequent heat; for the contact characteristic of the
self-indulgent man does not affect the whole body but only certain
parts.
