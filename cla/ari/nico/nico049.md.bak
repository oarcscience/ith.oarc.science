### Chapter 6.

#### Political justice and analogous kinds of justice.

Since acting unjustly does not necessarily imply being unjust, we must
ask what sort of unjust acts imply that the doer is unjust with respect
to each type of injustice, e.g. a thief, an adulterer, or a brigand.
Surely the answer does not turn on the difference between these types.
For a man might even lie with a woman knowing who she was, but the
origin of his might be not deliberate choice but passion. He acts
unjustly, then, but is not unjust; e.g. a man is not a thief, yet he
stole, nor an adulterer, yet he committed adultery; and similarly in all
other cases.

Now we have previously stated how the reciprocal is related to the just;
but we must not forget that what we are looking for is not only what is
just without qualification but also political justice. This is found
among men who share their life with a view to selfsufficiency, men who
are free and either proportionately or arithmetically equal, so that
between those who do not fulfil this condition there is no political
justice but justice in a special sense and by analogy. For justice
exists only between men whose mutual relations are governed by law; and
law exists for men between whom there is injustice; for legal justice is
the discrimination of the just and the unjust. And between men between
whom there is injustice there is also unjust action (though there is not
injustice between all between whom there is unjust action), and this is
assigning too much to oneself of things good in themselves and too
little of things evil in themselves. This is why we do not allow a man
to rule, but rational principle, because a man behaves thus in his own
interests and becomes a tyrant. The magistrate on the other hand is the
guardian of justice, and, if of justice, then of equality also. And
since he is assumed to have no more than his share, if he is just (for
he does not assign to himself more of what is good in itself, unless
such a share is proportional to his merits--so that it is for others
that he labours, and it is for this reason that men, as we stated
previously, say that justice is 'another's good'), therefore a reward
must be given him, and this is honour and privilege; but those for whom
such things are not enough become tyrants.

The justice of a master and that of a father are not the same as the
justice of citizens, though they are like it; for there can be no
injustice in the unqualified sense towards thing that are one's own, but
a man's chattel, and his child until it reaches a certain age and sets
up for itself, are as it were part of himself, and no one chooses to
hurt himself (for which reason there can be no injustice towards
oneself). Therefore the justice or injustice of citizens is not
manifested in these relations; for it was as we saw according to law,
and between people naturally subject to law, and these as we saw' are
people who have an equal share in ruling and being ruled. Hence justice
can more truly be manifested towards a wife than towards children and
chattels, for the former is household justice; but even this is
different from political justice.
