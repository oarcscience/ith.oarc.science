### Chapter 2.

#### The science of the good for man is politics.

If, then, there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its
own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we
do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that
rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be
empty and vain), clearly this must be the good and the chief good. Will
not the knowledge of it, then, have a great influence on life? Shall we
not, like archers who have a mark to aim at, be more likely to hit upon
what is right? If so, we must try, in outline at least, to determine
what it is, and of which of the sciences or capacities it is the object.
It would seem to belong to the most authoritative art and that which is
most truly the master art. And politics appears to be of this nature;
for it is this that ordains which of the sciences should be studied in a
state, and which each class of citizens should learn and up to what
point they should learn them; and we see even the most highly esteemed
of capacities to fall under this, e.g. strategy, economics, rhetoric;
now, since politics uses the rest of the sciences, and since, again, it
legislates as to what we are to do and what we are to abstain from, the
end of this science must include those of the others, so that this end
must be the good for man. For even if the end is the same for a single
man and for a state, that of the state seems at all events something
greater and more complete whether to attain or to preserve; though it is
worth while to attain the end merely for one man, it is finer and more
godlike to attain it for a nation or for city-states. These, then, are
the ends at which our inquiry aims, since it is political science, in
one sense of that term.
