### Chapter 2.

#### Discussion of the view that pleasure is the good.

Eudoxus thought pleasure was the good because he saw all things, both
rational and irrational, aiming at it, and because in all things that
which is the object of choice is what is excellent, and that which is
most the object of choice the greatest good; thus the fact that all
things moved towards the same object indicated that this was for all
things the chief good (for each thing, he argued, finds its own good, as
it finds its own nourishment); and that which is good for all things and
at which all aim was the good. His arguments were credited more because
of the excellence of his character than for their own sake; he was
thought to be remarkably self-controlled, and therefore it was thought
that he was not saying what he did say as a friend of pleasure, but that
the facts really were so. He believed that the same conclusion followed
no less plainly from a study of the contrary of pleasure; pain was in
itself an object of aversion to all things, and therefore its contrary
must be similarly an object of choice. And again that is most an object
of choice which we choose not because or for the sake of something else,
and pleasure is admittedly of this nature; for no one asks to what end
he is pleased, thus implying that pleasure is in itself an object of
choice. Further, he argued that pleasure when added to any good, e.g. to
just or temperate action, makes it more worthy of choice, and that it is
only by itself that the good can be increased.

This argument seems to show it to be one of the goods, and no more a
good than any other; for every good is more worthy of choice along with
another good than taken alone. And so it is by an argument of this kind
that Plato proves the good not to be pleasure; he argues that the
pleasant life is more desirable with wisdom than without, and that if
the mixture is better, pleasure is not the good; for the good cannot
become more desirable by the addition of anything to it. Now it is clear
that nothing else, any more than pleasure, can be the good if it is made
more desirable by the addition of any of the things that are good in
themselves. What, then, is there that satisfies this criterion, which at
the same time we can participate in? It is something of this sort that
we are looking for. Those who object that that at which all things aim
is not necessarily good are, we may surmise, talking nonsense. For we
say that that which every one thinks really is so; and the man who
attacks this belief will hardly have anything more credible to maintain
instead. If it is senseless creatures that desire the things in
question, there might be something in what they say; but if intelligent
creatures do so as well, what sense can there be in this view? But
perhaps even in inferior creatures there is some natural good stronger
than themselves which aims at their proper good.

Nor does the argument about the contrary of pleasure seem to be correct.
They say that if pain is an evil it does not follow that pleasure is a
good; for evil is opposed to evil and at the same time both are opposed
to the neutral state--which is correct enough but does not apply to the
things in question. For if both pleasure and pain belonged to the class
of evils they ought both to be objects of aversion, while if they
belonged to the class of neutrals neither should be an object of
aversion or they should both be equally so; but in fact people evidently
avoid the one as evil and choose the other as good; that then must be
the nature of the opposition between them.
