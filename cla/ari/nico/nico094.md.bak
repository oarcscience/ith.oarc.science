### Chapter 13.

#### Principles of interchange of services (a) in friendship between equals.

There are three kinds of friendship, as we said at the outset of our
inquiry, and in respect of each some are friends on an equality and
others by virtue of a superiority (for not only can equally good men
become friends but a better man can make friends with a worse, and
similarly in friendships of pleasure or utility the friends may be equal
or unequal in the benefits they confer). This being so, equals must
effect the required equalization on a basis of equality in love and in
all other respects, while unequals must render what is in proportion to
their superiority or inferiority. Complaints and reproaches arise either
only or chiefly in the friendship of utility, and this is only to be
expected. For those who are friends on the ground of virtue are anxious
to do well by each other (since that is a mark of virtue and of
friendship), and between men who are emulating each other in this there
cannot be complaints or quarrels; no one is offended by a man who loves
him and does well by him--if he is a person of nice feeling he takes his
revenge by doing well by the other. And the man who excels the other in
the services he renders will not complain of his friend, since he gets
what he aims at; for each man desires what is good. Nor do complaints
arise much even in friendships of pleasure; for both get at the same
time what they desire, if they enjoy spending their time together; and
even a man who complained of another for not affording him pleasure
would seem ridiculous, since it is in his power not to spend his days
with him.

But the friendship of utility is full of complaints; for as they use
each other for their own interests they always want to get the better of
the bargain, and think they have got less than they should, and blame
their partners because they do not get all they 'want and deserve'; and
those who do well by others cannot help them as much as those whom they
benefit want.

Now it seems that, as justice is of two kinds, one unwritten and the
other legal, one kind of friendship of utility is moral and the other
legal. And so complaints arise most of all when men do not dissolve the
relation in the spirit of the same type of friendship in which they
contracted it. The legal type is that which is on fixed terms; its
purely commercial variety is on the basis of immediate payment, while
the more liberal variety allows time but stipulates for a definite quid
pro quo. In this variety the debt is clear and not ambiguous, but in the
postponement it contains an element of friendliness; and so some states
do not allow suits arising out of such agreements, but think men who
have bargained on a basis of credit ought to accept the consequences.
The moral type is not on fixed terms; it makes a gift, or does whatever
it does, as to a friend; but one expects to receive as much or more, as
having not given but lent; and if a man is worse off when the relation
is dissolved than he was when it was contracted he will complain. This
happens because all or most men, while they wish for what is noble,
choose what is advantageous; now it is noble to do well by another
without a view to repayment, but it is the receiving of benefits that is
advantageous. Therefore if we can we should return the equivalent of
what we have received (for we must not make a man our friend against his
will; we must recognize that we were mistaken at the first and took a
benefit from a person we should not have taken it from--since it was not
from a friend, nor from one who did it just for the sake of acting
so--and we must settle up just as if we had been benefited on fixed
terms). Indeed, one would agree to repay if one could (if one could not,
even the giver would not have expected one to do so); therefore if it is
possible we must repay. But at the outset we must consider the man by
whom we are being benefited and on what terms he is acting, in order
that we may accept the benefit on these terms, or else decline it.

It is disputable whether we ought to measure a service by its utility to
the receiver and make the return with a view to that, or by the
benevolence of the giver. For those who have received say they have
received from their benefactors what meant little to the latter and what
they might have got from others--minimizing the service; while the
givers, on the contrary, say it was the biggest thing they had, and what
could not have been got from others, and that it was given in times of
danger or similar need. Now if the friendship is one that aims at
utility, surely the advantage to the receiver is the measure. For it is
he that asks for the service, and the other man helps him on the
assumption that he will receive the equivalent; so the assistance has
been precisely as great as the advantage to the receiver, and therefore
he must return as much as he has received, or even more (for that would
be nobler). In friendships based on virtue on the other hand, complaints
do not arise, but the purpose of the doer is a sort of measure; for in
purpose lies the essential element of virtue and character.
