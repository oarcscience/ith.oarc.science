### Chapter 6.

#### Intuitive reason--knowledge of the principles from which science proceeds.

Scientific knowledge is judgement about things that are universal and
necessary, and the conclusions of demonstration, and all scientific
knowledge, follow from first principles (for scientific knowledge
involves apprehension of a rational ground). This being so, the first
principle from which what is scientifically known follows cannot be an
object of scientific knowledge, of art, or of practical wisdom; for that
which can be scientifically known can be demonstrated, and art and
practical wisdom deal with things that are variable. Nor are these first
principles the objects of philosophic wisdom, for it is a mark of the
philosopher to have demonstration about some things. If, then, the
states of mind by which we have truth and are never deceived about
things invariable or even variable are scientific knowlededge, practical
wisdom, philosophic wisdom, and intuitive reason, and it cannot be any
of the three (i.e. practical wisdom, scientific knowledge, or
philosophic wisdom), the remaining alternative is that it is intuitive
reason that grasps the first principles.
