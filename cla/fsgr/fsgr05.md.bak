## I

### SATURNIA REGNA

Many persons who are quite prepared to admit the importance to the world
of Greek poetry, Greek art, and Greek philosophy, may still feel it
rather a paradox to be told that Greek religion specially repays our
study at the present day. Greek religion, associated with a romantic,
trivial, and not very edifying mythology, has generally seemed one of
the weakest spots in the armour of those giants of the old world. Yet I
will venture to make for Greek religion almost as great a claim as for
the thought and the literature, not only because the whole mass of it is
shot through by those strange lights of feeling and imagination, and the
details of it constantly wrought into beauty by that instinctive sense
of artistic form, which we specially associate with Classical Greece,
but also for two definite historical reasons. In the first place, the
student of that dark and fascinating department of the human mind which
we may call Religious Origins, will find in Greece an extraordinary mass
of material belonging to a very early date. For detail and variety the
primitive Greek evidence has no equal. And, secondly, in this department
as in others, ancient Greece has the triumphant if tragic distinction of
beginning at the very bottom and struggling, however precariously, to
the very summits. There is hardly any horror of primitive superstition
of which we cannot find some distant traces in our Greek record. <span
id="page_2">p. 2</span> There is hardly any height of spiritual thought
attained in the world that has not its archetype or its echo in the
stretch of Greek literature that lies between Thales and Plotinus,
embracing much of the 'Wisdom-Teachers' and of St. Paul.

The progress of Greek religion falls naturally into three stages, all of
them historically important. First there is the primitive *Euetheia* or
Age of Ignorance, before Zeus came to trouble men's minds, a stage to
which our anthropologists and explorers have found parallels in every
part of the world. Dr. Preuss applies to it the charming word
'Urdummheit', or 'Primal Stupidity'. In some ways characteristically
Greek, in others it is so typical of similar stages of thought elsewhere
that one is tempted to regard it as the normal beginning of all
religion, or almost as the normal raw material out of which religion is
made. There is certainly some repulsiveness, but I confess that to me
there is also an element of fascination in the study of these 'Beastly
Devices of the Heathen', at any rate as they appear in early Greece,
where each single 'beastly device' as it passes is somehow touched with
beauty and transformed by some spirit of upward striving.

Secondly there is the Olympian or classical stage, a stage in which, for
good or ill, blunderingly or successfully, this primitive vagueness was
reduced to a kind of order. This is the stage of the great Olympian
gods, who dominated art and poetry, ruled the imagination of Rome, and
extended a kind of romantic dominion even over the Middle Ages. It is
the stage that we learn, or mis-learn, from the statues and the
handbooks of mythology. Critics have said that this <span id="page_3">p.
3</span> Olympian stage has value only as art and not as religion. That
is just one of the points into which we shall inquire.

Thirdly, there is the Hellenistic period, reaching roughly from Plato to
St. Paul and the earlier Gnostics. The first edition of this book
treated the whole period as one, but I have now divided it by writing a
new chapter on the Movements of the Fourth Century <span
class="smcap">b. c.</span>, and making that my third stage. This was the
time when the Greek mind, still in its full creative vigour, made its
first response to the twofold failure of the world in which it had put
its faith, the open bankruptcy of the Olympian religion and the collapse
of the city-state. Both had failed, and each tried vainly to supply the
place of the other. Greece responded by the creation of two great
permanent types of philosophy which have influenced human ethics ever
since, the Cynic and Stoic schools on the one hand, and the Epicurean on
the other. These schools belong properly, I think, to the history of
religion. The successors of Aristotle produced rather a school of
progressive science, those of Plato a school of refined scepticism. The
religious side of Plato's thought was not revealed in its full power
till the time of Plotinus in the third century <span class="smcap">a.
d.</span>; that of Aristotle, one might say without undue paradox, not
till its exposition by Aquinas in the thirteenth.

The old Third Stage, therefore, becomes now a Fourth, comprising the
later and more popular movements of the Hellenistic Age, a period based
on the consciousness of manifold failure, and consequently touched both
with morbidity and with that spiritual exaltation which is so often the
companion of morbidity. <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> It not only had
behind it the failure of the Olympian theology and of the free
city-state, now crushed by semi-barbarous military monarchies; it lived
through the gradual realization of two other failures—the failure of
human government, even when backed by the power of Rome or the wealth of
Egypt, to achieve a good life for man; and lastly the failure of the
great propaganda of Hellenism, in which the long-drawn effort of Greece
to educate a corrupt and barbaric world seemed only to lead to the
corruption or barbarization of the very ideals which it sought to
spread. This sense of failure, this progressive loss of hope in the
world, in sober calculation, and in organized human effort, threw the
later Greek back upon his own soul, upon the pursuit of personal
holiness, upon emotions, mysteries and revelations, upon the comparative
neglect of this transitory and imperfect world for the sake of some
dream-world far off, which shall subsist without sin or corruption, the
same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. These four are the really
significant and formative periods of Greek religious thought; but we may
well cast our eyes also on a fifth stage, not historically influential
perhaps, but at least romantic and interesting and worthy of
considerable respect, when the old religion in the time of Julian roused
itself for a last spiritual protest against the all-conquering 'atheism'
of the Christians. I omit Plotinus, as in earlier chapters I have
omitted Plato and Aristotle, and for the same reason. As a rule in the
writings of Julian's circle and still more in the remains of popular
belief, the tendencies of our fourth stage are accentuated by an
increased demand for definite dogma and a still deeper consciousness of
worldly defeat.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

I shall not start with any definition of religion. Religion, like poetry
and most other living things, cannot be defined. But one may perhaps
give some description of it, or at least some characteristic marks. In
the first place, religion essentially deals with the uncharted region of
human experience. A large part of human life has been thoroughly
surveyed and explored; we understand the causes at work; and we are not
bewildered by the problems. That is the domain of positive knowledge.
But all round us on every side there is an uncharted region, just
fragments of the fringe of it explored, and those imperfectly; it is
with this that religion deals. And secondly we may note that religion
deals with its own province not tentatively, by the normal methods of
patient intellectual research, but directly, and by methods of emotion
or sub-conscious apprehension. Agriculture, for instance, used to be
entirely a question of religion; now it is almost entirely a question of
science. In antiquity, if a field was barren, the owner of it would
probably assume that the barrenness was due to 'pollution', or offence
somewhere. He would run through all his own possible offences, or at any
rate those of his neighbours and ancestors, and when he eventually
decided the cause of the trouble, the steps that he would take would all
be of a kind calculated not to affect the chemical constitution of the
soil, but to satisfy his own emotions of guilt and terror, or the
imaginary emotions of the imaginary being he had offended. A modern man
in the same predicament would probably not think of religion at all, at
any rate in the earlier stages; he would say it was a case for deeper
ploughing or for basic slag. Later on, <span id="page_6">p. 6</span> if
disaster followed disaster till he began to feel himself a marked man,
even the average modern would, I think, begin instinctively to reflect
upon his sins. A third characteristic flows from the first. The
uncharted region surrounds us on every side and is apparently infinite;
consequently, when once the things of the uncharted region are admitted
as factors in our ordinary conduct of life they are apt to be infinite
factors, overruling and swamping all others. The thing that religion
forbids is a thing never to be done; not all the inducements that this
life can offer weigh at all in the balance. Indeed there is no balance.
The man who makes terms with his conscience is essentially
non-religious; the religious man knows that it will profit him nothing
if he gain all this finite world and lose his stake in the infinite and
eternal.<span id="an_fr_6_1"></span>[6\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_6_1.md)

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

Am I going to draw no distinction then between religion and mere
superstition? Not at present. Later on we may perhaps see some way to
it. Superstition is the name given to a low or bad form of religion, to
the kind of religion we disapprove. The line of division, if we made
one, would be only an arbitrary bar thrust across a highly complex and
continuous process.

Does this amount to an implication that all the religions that have
existed in the world are false? Not so. It is obvious indeed that most,
if analysed into intellectual beliefs, are false; and I suppose that a
thoroughly orthodox member of any one of the million religious bodies
that exist in the world must be clear in his mind that the other million
minus one are wrong, if not wickedly wrong. That, I think, we must be
clear about. Yet the fact remains that man must have some relation
towards the uncharted, the mysterious, tracts of life which surround him
on every side. And for my own part I am content to say that his method
must be to a large extent very much what St. Paul calls <u>πίστις</u> or
faith: that is, some attitude not of the conscious intellect but of the
whole being, using all its powers of sensitiveness, all its feeblest and
most inarticulate feelers and tentacles, in the effort <span
id="page_8">p. 8</span> somehow to touch by these that which cannot be
grasped by the definite senses or analysed by the conscious reason. What
we gain thus is an insecure but a precious possession. We gain no dogma,
at least no safe dogma, but we gain much more. We gain something hard to
define, which lies at the heart not only of religion, but of art and
poetry and all the higher strivings of human emotion. I believe that at
times we actually gain practical guidance in some questions where
experience and argument fail.<span
id="an_fr_8_1"></span>[8\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_8_1.md) That is a great work
left for religion, but we must always remember two things about it:
first, that the liability to error is enormous, indeed almost infinite;
and second, that the results of confident error are very terrible.
Probably throughout history the worst things ever done in the world on a
large scale by decent people have been done in the name of religion, and
I do not think that has entirely ceased to be true at the present day.
All the Middle Ages held the <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> strange and,
to our judgement, the obviously insane belief that the normal result of
religious error was eternal punishment. And yet by the crimes to which
that false belief led them they almost proved the truth of something
very like it. The record of early Christian and medieval persecutions
which were the direct result of that one confident religious error comes
curiously near to one's conception of the wickedness of the damned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To turn to our immediate subject, I wish to put forward here what is
still a rather new and unauthorized view of the development of Greek
religion; readers will forgive me if, in treating so vast a subject, I
draw my outline very broadly, leaving out many qualifications, and
quoting only a fragment of the evidence.

The things that have misled us moderns in our efforts towards
understanding the primitive stage in Greek religion have been first the
widespread and almost ineradicable error of treating Homer as primitive,
and more generally our unconscious insistence on starting with the
notion of 'Gods'. Mr. Hartland, in his address as president of one of
the sections of the International Congress of Religions at Oxford,<span
id="an_fr_9_1"></span>[9\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_9_1.md) dwelt on the
significant fact about savage religions that wherever the word 'God' is
used our trustiest witnesses tend to contradict one another. Among the
best observers of the Arunta tribes, for instance, some hold that they
have no conception of God, others that they are constantly thinking
about God. The truth is that <span id="page_10">p. 10</span> this idea
of a god far away in the sky—I do not say merely a First Cause who is
'without body parts or passions', but almost any being that we should
naturally call a 'god'—is an idea not easy for primitive man to grasp.
It is a subtle and rarefied idea, saturated with ages of philosophy and
speculation. And we must always remember that one of the chief religions
of the world, Buddhism, has risen to great moral and intellectual
heights without using the conception of God at all; in his stead it has
Dharma, the Eternal Law.<span
id="an_fr_10_1"></span>[10\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_10_1.md)

Apart from some few philosophers, both Christian and Moslem, the gods of
the ordinary man have as a rule been as a matter of course
anthropomorphic. Men did not take the trouble to try to conceive them
otherwise. In many cases they have had the actual bodily shape of man;
in almost all they have possessed—of course in their highest
development—his mind and reason and his mental attributes. It causes
most of us even now something of a shock to be told by a medieval Arab
philosopher that to call God benevolent or righteous or to predicate of
him any other human quality is just as Pagan and degraded as to say that
he has a beard.<span
id="an_fr_10_2"></span>[10\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_10_2.md) Now the Greek gods
seem at first sight quite particularly solid and anthropomorphic. The
statues and vases speak clearly, and they are mostly borne out by the
literature. Of course we must discount the kind of evidence that misled
Winckelmann, the mere Roman and Alexandrian art and mythology; but even
if we go back <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> to the fifth century <span
class="smcap">b. c.</span> we shall find the ruling conceptions far
nobler indeed, but still anthropomorphic. We find firmly established the
Olympian patriarchal family, Zeus the Father of gods and men, his wife
Hera, his son Apollo, his daughter Athena, his brothers Poseidon and
Hades, and the rest. We probably think of each figure more or less as
like a statue, a habit of mind obviously wrong and indeed absurd, as if
one thought of 'Labour' and 'Grief' as statues because Rodin or St.
Gaudens has so represented them. And yet it was a habit into which the
late Greeks themselves sometimes fell;<span
id="an_fr_11_1"></span>[11\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_11_1.md) their arts of
sculpture and painting as applied to religion had been so dangerously
successful: they sharpened and made vivid an anthropomorphism which in
its origin had been mostly the result of normal human laziness. The
process of making winds and rivers into anthropomorphic gods is, for the
most part, not the result of using the imagination with special vigour.
It is the result of not doing so. The wind is obviously alive; any fool
can see that. Being alive, it blows; how? why, naturally; just as you
and I blow. It knocks things down, it shouts and dances, it whispers and
talks. And, unless we are going to make a great effort of the
imagination and try to realize, like a scientific man, just what really
happens, we naturally assume that it does these things in the normal
way, in the only way we know. Even when you worship a beast or a stone,
you practically anthropomorphize it. It happens indeed to have a
perfectly clear shape, so you accept that. But it talks, acts, and
fights just like a man—as <span id="page_12">p. 12</span> you can see
from the *Australian Folk Tales* published by Mrs. Langloh
Parker—because you do not take the trouble to think out any other way of
behaving. This kind of anthropomorphism—or as Mr. Gladstone used to call
it, 'anthropophuism'—'humanity of *nature*'—is primitive and inevitable:
the sharp-cut statue type of god is different, and is due in Greece
directly to the work of the artists.

We must get back behind these gods of the artist's workshop and the
romance-maker's imagination, and see if the religious thinkers of the
great period use, or imply, the same highly human conceptions. We shall
find Parmenides telling us that God coincides with the universe, which
is a sphere and immovable;<span
id="an_fr_12_1"></span>[12\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_12_1.md) Heraclitus, that
God is 'day night, summer winter, war peace, satiety hunger'.
Xenophanes, that God is all-seeing, all-hearing, and all mind;<span
id="an_fr_12_2"></span>[12\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_12_2.md) and as for his
supposed human shape, why, if bulls and lions were to speak about God
they would doubtless tell us that he was a bull or a lion.<span
id="an_fr_12_3"></span>[12\_3](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_12_3.md) We must notice the
instinctive language of the poets, using the word <u>θεός</u> in many
subtle senses for which our word 'God' is too stiff, too personal, and
too anthropomorphic. <u>Τό εὐτυχεῖν</u>, 'the fact of success', is 'a
god and more than a god'; <u>τὸ γιγνώσκειν φίλους</u>, 'the thrill of
recognizing a friend' after long absence, is a 'god'; wine is a 'god'
whose body is poured out in libation to gods; and in the unwritten law
of the human conscience 'a great god liveth and groweth not old'.<span
id="an_fr_12_4"></span>[12\_4](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_12_4.md) You will <span
id="page_13">p. 13</span> say that is mere poetry or philosophy: it
represents a particular theory or a particular metaphor. I think not.
Language of this sort is used widely and without any explanation or
apology. It was evidently understood and felt to be natural by the
audience. If it is metaphorical, all metaphors have grown from the soil
of current thought and normal experience. And without going into the
point at length I think we may safely conclude that the soil from which
such language as this grew was not any system of clear-cut personal
anthropomorphic theology. No doubt any of these poets, if he had to make
a picture of one of these utterly formless Gods, would have given him a
human form. That was the recognized symbol, as a veiled woman is St.
Gaudens's symbol for 'Grief'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But we have other evidence too which shows abundantly that these
Olympian gods are not primary, but are imposed upon a background
strangely unlike themselves. For a long time their luminous figures
dazzled our eyes; we were not able to see the half-lit regions behind
them, the dark primeval tangle of desires and fears and dreams from
which they drew their vitality. The surest test to apply in this
question is the evidence of actual cult. Miss Harrison has <span
id="page_14">p. 14</span> here shown us the right method, and following
her we will begin with the three great festivals of Athens, the Diasia,
the Thesmophoria, and the Anthesteria.<span
id="an_fr_14_1"></span>[14\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_14_1.md)

The Diasia was said to be the chief festival of Zeus, the central figure
of the Olympians, though our authorities generally add an epithet to
him, and call him Zeus Meilichios, Zeus of Placation. A god with an
'epithet' is always suspicious, like a human being with an 'alias'. Miss
Harrison's examination (*Prolegomena*, pp. 28 ff.) shows that in the
rites Zeus has no place at all. Meilichios from the beginning has a
fairly secure one. On some of the reliefs Meilichios appears not as a
god, but as an enormous bearded snake, a well-known representation of
underworld powers or dead ancestors. Sometimes the great snake is alone;
sometimes he rises gigantic above the small human worshippers
approaching him. And then, in certain reliefs, his old barbaric presence
vanishes, and we have instead a benevolent and human father of gods and
men, trying, as Miss Harrison somewhere expresses it, to look as if he
had been there all the time.

There was a sacrifice at the Diasia, but it was not a sacrifice given to
Zeus. To Zeus and all the heavenly gods men gave sacrifice in the form
of a feast, in which the god had his portion and the worshippers theirs.
The two parties cemented their friendship and feasted happily together.
But the sacrifice at the Diasia was a holocaust:<span
id="an_fr_14_2"></span>[14\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_14_2.md) every shred of the
victim was burnt to ashes, that no man might partake of it. We know
<span id="page_15">p. 15</span> quite well the meaning of that form of
sacrifice: it is a sacrifice to placate or appease the powers below, the
Chthonioi, the dead and the lords of death. It was performed, as our
authorities tell us, <u>μετὰ στυγνότητος</u>, with shuddering or
repulsion.<span id="an_fr_15_1"></span>[15\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_15_1.md)

The Diasia was a ritual of placation, that is, of casting away various
elements of pollution or danger and appeasing the unknown wraths of the
surrounding darkness. The nearest approach to a god contained in this
festival is Meilichios, and Meilichios, as we shall see later, belongs
to a particular class of shadowy beings who are built up out of ritual
services. His name means '*He of appeasement*', and he is nothing else.
He is merely the personified shadow or dream generated by the emotion of
the ritual—very much, to take a familiar instance, as Father Christmas
is a 'projection' of our Christmas customs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Thesmophoria formed the great festival of Demeter and her daughter
Korê, though here again Demeter appears with a clinging epithet,
Thesmophoros. We know pretty clearly the whole course of the ritual:
there is the carrying by women of certain magic charms, fir-cones and
snakes and unnameable objects made of paste, to ensure fertility; there
is a sacrifice of pigs, who were thrown into a deep cleft of the earth,
and their remains afterwards collected and scattered as a charm over the
fields. There is more magic ritual, more carrying of sacred objects, a
fast followed by a rejoicing, a disappearance of life below the earth,
and a rising again of life above it; but it is hard to find definite
traces of any personal <span id="page_16">p. 16</span> goddess. The
Olympian Demeter and Persephone dwindle away as we look closer, and we
are left with the shadow Thesmophoros, '*She who carries Thesmoi*',<span
id="an_fr_16_1"></span>[16\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_16_1.md) not a substantive
personal goddess, but merely a personification of the ritual itself: an
imaginary Charm-bearer generated by so much charm-bearing, just as
Meilichios in the Diasia was generated from the ritual of appeasement.

Now the Diasia were dominated by a sacred snake. Is there any similar
divine animal in the Thesmophoria? Alas, yes. Both here, and still more
markedly in the mysteries of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis, we
regularly find the most lovely of all goddesses, Demeter and Persephone,
habitually—I will not say represented by, but dangerously associated
with, a sacred Sow. A Pig is the one animal in Greek religion that
actually had sacrifice made to it.<span
id="an_fr_16_2"></span>[16\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_16_2.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The third feast, the Anthesteria, belongs in classical times to the
Olympian Dionysus, and is said to be the oldest of his feasts. On the
surface there is a touch of the wine-god, and he is given due official
prominence; but as soon as we penetrate anywhere near the heart of <span
id="page_17">p. 17</span> the festival, Dionysus and his brother gods
are quite forgotten, and all that remains is a great ritual for
appeasing the dead. All the days of the Feast were *nefasti*, of ill
omen; the first day especially was <u>ἐς τὸ πᾶν ἀποφράς</u>. On it the
Wine Jars which were also Seed and Funeral Jars were opened and the
spirits of the Dead let loose in the world.<span
id="an_fr_17_1"></span>[17\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_17_1.md) Nameless and
innumerable, the ghosts are summoned out of their tombs, and are duly
feasted, each man summoning his own ghosts to his own house, and
carefully abstaining from any act that would affect his neighbours. And
then, when they are properly appeased and made gentle, they are swept
back again out of this world to the place where they properly belong,
and the streets and houses cleaned from the presence of death. There is
one central stage indeed in which Dionysus does seem to appear. And he
appears in a very significant way, to conduct a Sacred Marriage. For,
why do you suppose the dead are summoned at all? What use to the tribe
is the presence of all these dead ancestors? They have come, I suspect,
to be born again, to begin a new life at the great Spring festival. For
the new births of the tribe, the new crops, the new kids, the new human
beings, are of course really only the old ones returned to earth.<span
id="an_fr_17_2"></span>[17\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_17_2.md) The important
thing is to get them properly placated and purified, free from the
contagion of ancient sin or underworld anger. For nothing is so
dangerous as the presence of what I may call raw ghosts. The Anthesteria
<span id="page_18">p. 18</span> contained, like other feasts of the
kind, a <u>ἱερὸς γάμος</u>, or Holy Marriage, between the wife of the
Basileus or Sacred King, and the imaginary god.<span
id="an_fr_18_1"></span>[18\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_18_1.md) Whatever reality
there ever was in the ceremony has apparently by classical times faded
away. But the place where the god received his bride is curious. It was
called the Boukolion, or Bull's Shed. It was not originally the home of
an anthropomorphic god, but of a divine animal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus in each of these great festivals we find that the Olympian gods
vanish away, and we are left with three things only: first, with an
atmosphere of religious dread; second, with a whole sequence of magical
ceremonies which, in two at least of the three cases,<span
id="an_fr_18_2"></span>[18\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_18_2.md) produce a kind of
strange personal emanation of <span id="page_19">p. 19</span>
themselves, the Appeasements producing Meilichios, the Charm-bearings
Thesmophoros; and thirdly, with a divine or sacred animal. In the Diasia
we find the old superhuman snake, who reappears so ubiquitously
throughout Greece, the regular symbol of the underworld powers,
especially the hero or dead ancestor. Why the snake was so chosen we can
only surmise. He obviously lived underground: his home was among the
Chthonioi, the Earth-People. Also, says the Scholiast to Aristophanes
(*Plut.* 533), he was a type of new birth because he throws off his old
skin and renews himself. And if that in itself is not enough to show his
supernatural power, what normal earthly being could send his enemies to
death by one little pin-prick, as some snakes can?

In the Thesmophoria we found sacred swine, and the reason given by the
ancients is no doubt the right one. The sow is sacred because of its
fertility, and possibly as practical people we should add, because of
its cheapness. Swine are always prominent in Greek agricultural rites.
And the bull? Well, we modern town-dwellers have almost forgotten what a
real bull is like. For so many centuries we have tamed him and penned
him in, and utterly deposed him from his place as lord of the forest.
The bull was the chief of magic or sacred animals in Greece, chief
because of his enormous strength, his size, his rage, in fine, as
anthropologists call it, his *mana*; that primitive word which comprises
force, vitality, prestige, holiness, and power of magic, and which may
belong equally to a lion, a chief, a medicine-man, or a battle-axe.

Now in the art and the handbooks these sacred <span id="page_20">p.
20</span> animals have all been adopted into the Olympian system. They
appear regularly as the 'attributes' of particular gods. Zeus is merely
accompanied by a snake, an eagle, a bull, or at worst assumes for his
private purposes the forms of those animals. The cow and the cuckoo are
sacred to Hera; the owl and the snake to Athena; the dolphin, the crow,
the lizard, the bull, to Apollo. Dionysus, always like a wilder and less
middle-aged Zeus, appears freely as a snake, bull, he-goat, and lion.
Allowing for some isolated exceptions, the safest rule in all these
cases is that the attribute is original and the god is added.<span
id="an_fr_20_1"></span>[20\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_20_1.md) It comes out very
clearly in the case of the snake and the bull. The tremendous *mana* of
the wild bull indeed occupies almost half the stage of pre-Olympian
ritual. The religion unearthed by Dr. Evans in Crete is permeated by the
bull of Minos. The heads and horns are in almost every sacred room and
on every altar. The great religious scene depicted on the sarcophagus of
Hagia Triada<span id="an_fr_20_2"></span>[20\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_20_2.md)
centres in the holy blood that flows from the neck of a captive and
dying bull. Down into classical times bull's blood was a sacred thing
which it was dangerous to touch and death to taste: to drink a cup of it
was the most heroic form of suicide.<span
id="an_fr_20_3"></span>[20\_3](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_20_3.md) The sacrificial
bull at Delphi was called *Hosiôtêr*: he was not merely *hosios*, holy;
he <span id="page_21">p. 21</span> was *Hosiôtêr*, the Sanctifier, He
who maketh Holy. It was by contact with him that holiness was spread to
others. On a coin and a vase, cited by Miss Harrison,<span
id="an_fr_21_1"></span>[21\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_21_1.md) we have a bull
entering a holy cave and a bull standing in a shrine. We have holy
pillars whose holiness consists in the fact that they have been touched
with the blood of a bull. We have a long record of a bull-ritual at
Magnesia,<span id="an_fr_21_2"></span>[21\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_21_2.md) in
which Zeus, though he makes a kind of external claim to be lord of the
feast, dare not claim that the bull is sacrificed to him. Zeus has a ram
to himself and stands apart, showing but a weak and shadowy figure
beside the original Holy One. We have immense masses of evidence about
the religion of Mithras, at one time the most serious rival of
Christianity, which sought its hope and its salvation in the blood of a
divine bull.

Now what is the origin of this conception of the sacred animal? It was
first discovered and explained with almost prophetic insight by Dr.
Robertson Smith.<span
id="an_fr_21_3"></span>[21\_3](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_21_3.md) The origin is what
he calls a sacramental feast: you eat the flesh and drink the blood of
the divine animal in order—here I diverge from Robertson Smith's
language—to get into you his *mana*, his vital power. The classical
instance is the sacramental eating of a camel by an Arab tribe, recorded
in the works of St. Nilus.<span
id="an_fr_21_4"></span>[21\_4](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_21_4.md) The camel was
devoured on a particular day at the rising of the morning star. He was
cut to pieces alive, and every fragment of him had <span id="page_22">p.
22</span> to be consumed before the sun rose. If the life had once gone
out of the flesh and blood the sacrifice would have been spoilt; it was
the spirit, the vitality, of the camel that his tribesmen wanted. The
only serious error that later students have found in Robertson Smith's
statement is that he spoke too definitely of the sacrifice as affording
communion with the tribal god. There was no god there, only the raw
material out of which gods are made. You devoured the holy animal to get
its *mana*, its swiftness, its strength, its great endurance, just as
the savage now will eat his enemy's brain or heart or hands to get some
particular quality residing there. The imagination of the pre-Hellenic
tribes was evidently dominated above all things by the bull, though
there were other sacramental feasts too, combined with sundry horrible
rendings and drinkings of raw blood. It is strange to think that even
small things like kids and fawns and hares should have struck primitive
man as having some uncanny vitality which he longed for, or at least
some uncanny power over the weather or the crops. Yet to him it no doubt
appeared obvious. Frogs, for instance, could always bring rain by
croaking for it, and who can limit the powers and the knowledge of
birds?<span id="an_fr_22_1"></span>[22\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_22_1.md)

Here comes a difficulty. If the Olympian god was not there to start
with, how did he originate? We can understand—at least after a course of
anthropology—this desire of primitive man to acquire for himself the
superhuman forces of the bull; but how does he make the transition from
the real animal to the imaginary <span id="page_23">p. 23</span> human
god? First let us remember the innate tendency of primitive man
everywhere, and not especially in Greece, to imagine a personal cause,
like himself in all points not otherwise specified, for every striking
phenomenon. If the wind blows it is because some being more or less
human, though of course superhuman, is blowing with his cheeks. If a
tree is struck by lightning it is because some one has thrown his
battle-axe at it. In some Australian tribes there is no belief in
natural death. If a man dies it is because 'bad man kill that fellow'.
St. Paul, we may remember, passionately summoned the heathen to refrain
from worshipping <u>τὴν κτίσιν</u>, the creation, and go back to <u>τὸν
κτίσαντα</u>, the creator, human and masculine. It was as a rule a road
that they were only too ready to travel.<span
id="an_fr_23_1"></span>[23\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_23_1.md)

But this tendency was helped by a second factor. Research has shown us
the existence in early Mediterranean religion of a peculiar transitional
step, a man wearing the head or skin of a holy beast. The Egyptian gods
are depicted as men with beasts' heads: that is, the best authorities
tell us, their shapes are derived from the kings and priests who on
great occasions of sacrifice covered their heads with a beast-mask.<span
id="an_fr_23_2"></span>[23\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_23_2.md) Minos, with his
projection the Minotaur, was a bull-god and wore a bull-mask. From early
Island gems, from a fresco at Mycenae, from Assyrian reliefs, Mr. A. B.
Cook has collected many examples of this mixed figure—a man wearing the
*protomê*, or mask and mane, of a beast. Sometimes we can actually see
him <span id="page_24">p. 24</span> offering libations. Sometimes the
worshipper has become so closely identified with his divine beast that
he is represented not as a mere man wearing the *protomê* of a lion or
bull, but actually as a lion or bull wearing the *protomê* of
another.<span id="an_fr_24_1"></span>[24\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_24_1.md)
Hera, <u>βοῶπις</u>, with a cow's head; Athena, <u>γλαυκῶπις</u>, with
an owl's head, or bearing on her breast the head of the Gorgon; Heracles
clad in a lion's skin and covering his brow <u>δεινῷ χάσματι θηρός</u>,
'with the awful spread jaws of the wild beast', belong to the same
class. So does the Dadouchos at Eleusis and other initiators who let
candidates for purification set one foot—one only and that the left—on
the skin of a sacrificial ram, and called the skin <u>Διὸς κῶας</u>, the
fleece not of a ram, but of Zeus.<span
id="an_fr_24_2"></span>[24\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_24_2.md)

The *mana* of the slain beast is in the hide and head and blood and fur,
and the man who wants to be in thorough contact with the divinity gets
inside the skin and wraps himself deep in it. He begins by being a man
wearing a lion's skin: he ends, as we have seen, by feeling himself to
be a lion wearing a lion's skin. And who is this man? He may on
particular occasions be only a candidate for purification or initiation.
But *par excellence* he who has the right is the priest, the
medicine-man, the divine king. If an old suggestion of my own is right,
he is the original <u>θεός</u> or <u>θεσός</u>, the incarnate medicine
or spell or magic power.<span
id="an_fr_24_3"></span>[24\_3](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_24_3.md) He at <span
id="page_25">p. 25</span> first, I suspect, is the only <u>θεός</u> or
'God' that his society knows. We commonly speak of ancient kings being
'deified'; we regard the process as due to an outburst of superstition
or insane flattery. And so no doubt it sometimes was, especially in
later times—when man and god were felt as two utterly distinct things.
But 'deification' is an unintelligent and misleading word. What we call
'deification' is only the survival of this undifferentiated human
<u>θεός</u>, with his *mana*, his <u>κράτος</u> and <u>βία</u>, his
control of the weather, the rain and the thunder, the spring crops and
the autumn floods; his knowledge of what was lawful and what was not,
and his innate power to curse or to 'make dead'. Recent researches have
shown us in abundance the early Greek medicine-chiefs making thunder and
lightning and rain.<span
id="an_fr_25_1"></span>[25\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_25_1.md) We have long known
the king as possessor of Dike and Themis, of justice and tribal custom;
we have known his effect on the fertility of the fields and the tribes,
and the terrible results of a king's sin or a king's sickness.<span
id="an_fr_25_2"></span>[25\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_25_2.md)

What is the subsequent history of this medicine-chief or <u>θεός</u>? He
is differentiated, as it were: the visible part of him becomes merely
human; the supposed supernatural part grows into what we should call a
God. The process is simple. Any particular <span id="page_26">p.
26</span> medicine-man is bound to have his failures. As Dr. Frazer
gently reminds us, every single pretension which he puts forth on every
day of his life is a lie, and liable sooner or later to be found out.
Doubtless men are tender to their own delusions. They do not at once
condemn the medicine-chief as a fraudulent institution, but they tend
gradually to say that he is not the real all-powerful <u>θεός</u>. He is
only his representative. The real <u>θεός</u>, tremendous, infallible,
is somewhere far away, hidden in clouds perhaps, on the summit of some
inaccessible mountain. If the mountain is once climbed the god will move
to the upper sky. The medicine-chief meanwhile stays on earth, still
influential. He has some connexion with the great god more intimate than
that of other men; at worst he possesses the god's sacred instruments,
his <u>ἱερά</u> or <u>ὄργια</u>; he knows the rules for approaching him
and making prayers to him.

There is therefore a path open from the divine beast to the
anthropomorphic god. From beings like Thesmophoros and Meilichios the
road is of course much easier. They are already more than half
anthropomorphic; they only lack the concreteness, the lucid shape and
the detailed personal history of the Olympians. In this connexion we
must not forget the power of hallucination, still fairly strong, as the
history of religious revivals in America will bear witness,<span
id="an_fr_26_1"></span>[26\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_26_1.md) but far stronger,
of course, among the impressionable hordes of early men. 'The god', says
M. Doutté in his profound study of Algerian magic, 'c'est le désir
collectif personnifié', the collective desire projected, <span
id="page_27">p. 27</span> as it were, or personified.<span
id="an_fr_27_1"></span>[27\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_27_1.md) Think of the gods
who have appeared in great crises of battle, created sometimes by the
desperate desire of men who have for years prayed to them, and who are
now at the last extremity for lack of their aid, sometimes by the
confused and excited remembrances of the survivors after the victory.
The gods who led the Roman charge at Lake Regillus,<span
id="an_fr_27_2"></span>[27\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_27_2.md) the gigantic
figures that were seen fighting before the Greeks at Marathon,<span
id="an_fr_27_3"></span>[27\_3](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_27_3.md) even the celestial
signs that promised Constantine victory for the cross:<span
id="an_fr_27_4"></span>[27\_4](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_27_4.md)—these are the
effects of great emotion: we can all understand them. But even in daily
life primitive men seem to have dealt more freely than we generally do
with apparitions and voices and daemons of every kind. One of the most
remarkable and noteworthy sources for this kind of hallucinatory god in
early societies is a social custom that we have almost forgotten, the
religious Dance. When the initiated young men of Crete or elsewhere
danced at night over the mountains in the Oreibasia or Mountain Walk
they not only did things that seemed beyond their ordinary workaday
strength; they also felt themselves led on and on by some power which
guided and sustained them. This daemon has no necessary name: a man may
be named after him 'Oreibasius', 'Belonging to the Mountain Dancer',
just as others may be named 'Apollonius' or 'Dionysius'. The god is only
the spirit of the Mountain <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> Dance,
Oreibates, though of course he is absorbed at different times in various
Olympians. There is one god called Aphiktor, the Suppliant, He who prays
for mercy. He is just the projection, as M. Doutté would say, of the
intense emotion of one of those strange processions well known in the
ancient world, bands of despairing men or women who have thrown away all
means of self-defence and join together at some holy place in one
passionate prayer for pity. The highest of all gods, Zeus, was the
special patron of the suppliant; and it is strange and instructive to
find that Zeus the all-powerful is actually identified with this
Aphiktor: <u>Ζεὺς μὲν Ἀφίκτωρ ἐπίδοι προφρόνως</u>.<span
id="an_fr_28_1"></span>[28\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_28_1.md) The assembled
prayer, the united cry that rises from the oppressed of the world, is
itself grown to be a god, and the greatest god. A similar projection
arose from the dance of the *Kouroi*, or initiate youths, in the
dithyramb—the magic dance which was to celebrate, or more properly, to
hasten and strengthen, the coming on of spring. That dance projected the
Megistos Kouros, the greatest of youths, who is the incarnation of
spring or the return of life, and lies at the back of so many of the
most gracious shapes of the classical pantheon. The Kouros appears as
Dionysus, as Apollo, as Hermes, as Ares: in our clearest and most
detailed piece of evidence he actually appears with the characteristic
history and attributes of Zeus.<span
id="an_fr_28_2"></span>[28\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_28_2.md)

This spirit of the dance, who leads it or personifies its emotion,
stands more clearly perhaps than any <span id="page_29">p. 29</span>
other daemon half-way between earth and heaven. A number of difficult
passages in Euripides' *Bacchae* and other Dionysiac literature find
their explanations when we realize how the god is in part merely
identified with the inspired chief dancer, in part he is the intangible
projected incarnation of the emotion of the dance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

'The collective desire personified': on what does the collective desire,
or collective dread, of the primitive community chiefly concentrate? On
two things, the food-supply and the tribe-supply, the desire not to die
of famine and not to be harried or conquered by the neighbouring tribe.
The fertility of the earth and the fertility of the tribe, these two are
felt in early religion as one.<span
id="an_fr_29_1"></span>[29\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_29_1.md) The earth is a
mother: the human mother is an <u>ἄρουρα</u>, or ploughed field. This
earth-mother is the characteristic and central feature of the early
Aegean religions. The introduction of agriculture made her a mother of
fruits and corn, and it is in that form that we best know her. But in
earlier days she had been a mother of the spontaneous growth of the
soil, of wild beasts and trees and all the life of the mountain.<span
id="an_fr_29_2"></span>[29\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_29_2.md) In early Crete she
stands with lions erect on either side of her or with snakes held in her
hands and coiled about her body. And as the earth is mother <span
id="page_30">p. 30</span> when the harvest comes, so in spring she is
maiden or Korê, but a maiden fated each year to be wedded and made
fruitful; and earlier still there has been the terrible time when fields
are bare and lifeless. The Korê has been snatched away underground,
among the dead peoples, and men must wait expectant till the first buds
begin to show and they call her to rise again with the flowers. Meantime
earth as she brings forth vegetation in spring is Kourotrophos, rearer
of Kouroi, or the young men of the tribe. The nymphs and rivers are all
Kourotrophoi. The Moon is Kourotrophos. She quickens the young of the
tribe in their mother's womb; at one terrible hour especially she is 'a
lion to women' who have offended against her holiness. She also marks
the seasons of sowing and ploughing, and the due time for the ripening
of crops. When men learn to calculate in longer units, the Sun appears:
they turn to the Sun for their calendar, and at all times of course the
Sun has been a power in agriculture. He is not called Kourotrophos, but
the Young Sun returning after winter is himself a Kouros,<span
id="an_fr_30_1"></span>[30\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_30_1.md) and all the Kouroi
have some touch of the Sun in them. The Cretan Spring-song of the
Kouretes prays for <u>νέοι πολῖται</u>, young citizens, quite simply
among the other gifts of the spring.<span
id="an_fr_30_2"></span>[30\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_30_2.md)

This is best shown by the rites of tribal initiation, which seem
normally to have formed part of the spring <span id="page_31">p.
31</span> Drômena or sacred performances. The Kouroi, as we have said,
are the initiated young men. They pass through their initiation; they
become no longer <u>παῖδες</u>, boys, but <u>ἄνδρες</u>, men. The actual
name Kouros is possibly connected with <u>κείρειν</u>, to shave,<span
id="an_fr_31_1"></span>[31\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_31_1.md) and may mean that
after this ceremony they first cut their long hair. Till then the
<u>κοῦρος</u> is <u>ἀκερσεκόμης</u>—with hair unshorn. They have now
open to them the two roads that belong to <u>ἄνδρες</u> alone: they have
the work of begetting children for the tribe, and the work of killing
the tribe's enemies in battle.

The classification of people according to their age is apt to be sharp
and vivid in primitive communities. We, for example, think of an old man
as a kind of man, and an old woman as a kind of woman; but in primitive
peoples as soon as a man and woman cease to be able to perform his and
her due tribal functions they cease to be men and women, <u>ἄνδρες</u>
and <u>γυναῖκες</u>: the ex-man becomes a <u>γέρων</u>; the ex-woman a
<u>γραῦς</u>.<span id="an_fr_31_2"></span>[31\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_31_2.md)
We distinguish between 'boy' and 'man', between 'girl' and 'woman'; but
apart from the various words for baby, Attic Greek would have four sharp
divisions, <u>παῖς</u>, <u>ἔφηβος</u>, <u>ἀνήρ</u>, <u>γέρων</u>.<span
id="an_fr_31_3"></span>[31\_3](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_31_3.md) In Sparta the
<span id="page_32">p. 32</span> divisions are still sharper and more
numerous, centring in the great initiation ceremonies of the Iranes, or
full-grown youths, to the goddess called Orthia or Bortheia.<span
id="an_fr_32_1"></span>[32\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_32_1.md) These initiation
ceremonies are called Teletai, 'completions': they mark the great 'rite
of transition' from the immature, charming, but half useless thing which
we call boy or girl, to the <u>τέλειος ἀνήρ</u>, the full member of the
tribe as fighter or counsellor, or to the <u>τελεία γυνή</u>, the full
wife and mother. This whole subject of Greek initiation ceremonies calls
pressingly for more investigation. It is only in the last few years that
we have obtained the material for understanding them, and the whole mass
of the evidence needs re-treatment. For one instance, it is clear that a
great number of rites which were formerly explained as remnants of human
sacrifice are simply ceremonies of initiation.<span
id="an_fr_32_2"></span>[32\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_32_2.md)

At the great spring Drômenon the tribe and the growing earth were
renovated together: the earth arises afresh from her dead seeds, the
tribe from its dead ancestors; and the whole process, charged as it is
with the emotion of pressing human desire, projects its anthropomorphic
god or daemon. A vegetation-spirit we call him, very inadequately; he is
a divine Kouros, a Year-Daemon, a spirit that in the first stage is
living, <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> then dies with each year, then
thirdly rises again from the dead, raising the whole dead world with
him—the Greeks called him in this phase 'the Third One', or the
'Saviour'. The renovation ceremonies were accompanied by a casting off
of the old year, the old garments, and everything that is polluted by
the infection of death. And not only of death; but clearly I think, in
spite of the protests of some Hellenists, of guilt or sin also. For the
life of the Year-Daemon, as it seems to be reflected in Tragedy, is
generally a story of Pride and Punishment. Each Year arrives, waxes
great, commits the sin of Hubris, and then is slain. The death is
deserved; but the slaying is a sin: hence comes the next Year as
Avenger, or as the Wronged One re-risen. 'All things pay retribution for
their injustice one to another according to the ordinance of time.'<span
id="an_fr_33_1"></span>[33\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_33_1.md) It is this range
of ideas, half suppressed during the classical period, but evidently
still current among the ruder and less Hellenized peoples, which
supplied St. Paul with some of his most famous and deep-reaching
metaphors. 'Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it
die.'<span id="an_fr_33_2"></span>[33\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_33_2.md) 'As He
was raised from the dead we may walk with Him in newness of life.' And
this renovation must be preceded by a casting out and killing of the old
polluted life—'the old man in us must first be crucified'.

'The old man must be crucified.' We observed that in all the three
Festivals there was a pervasive <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> element
of vague fear. Hitherto we have been dealing with early Greek religion
chiefly from the point of view of *mana*, the positive power or force
that man tries to acquire from his totem-animal or his god. But there is
also a negative side to be considered: there is not only the *mana*, but
the *tabu*, the Forbidden, the Thing Feared. We must cast away the old
year; we must put our sins on to a <u>φαρμακός</u> or scapegoat and
drive it out. When the ghosts have returned and feasted with us at the
Anthesteria we must, with tar and branches of buckthorn, purge them out
of every corner of the rooms till the air is pure from the infection of
death. We must avoid speaking dangerous words; in great moments we must
avoid speaking any words at all, lest there should be even in the most
innocent of them some unknown danger; for we are surrounded above and
below by Kêres, or Spirits, winged influences, shapeless or of unknown
shape, sometimes the spirits of death, sometimes of disease, madness,
calamity; thousands and thousands of them, as Sarpedon says, from whom
man can never escape nor hide;<span
id="an_fr_34_1"></span>[34\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_34_1.md) 'all the air so
crowded with them', says an unknown ancient poet, 'that there is not one
empty chink into which you could push the spike of a blade of
corn.'<span id="an_fr_34_2"></span>[34\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_34_2.md)

The extraordinary security of our modern life in times of peace makes it
hard for us to realize, except by a definite effort of the imagination,
the constant precariousness, the frightful proximity of death, that was
usual in these weak ancient communities. They were in fear of wild
beasts; they were helpless <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> against
floods, helpless against pestilences. Their food depended on the crops
of one tiny plot of ground; and if the Saviour was not reborn with the
spring, they slowly and miserably died. And all the while they knew
almost nothing of the real causes that made crops succeed or fail. They
only felt sure it was somehow a matter of pollution, of unexpiated
defilement. It is this state of things that explains the curious cruelty
of early agricultural doings, the human sacrifices, the scapegoats, the
tearing in pieces of living animals, and perhaps of living men, the
steeping of the fields in blood. Like most cruelty it has its roots in
terror, terror of the breach of *Tabu*—the Forbidden Thing. I will not
dwell on this side of the picture: it is well enough known. But we have
to remember that, like so many morbid growths of the human mind, it has
its sublime side. We must not forget that the human victims were often
volunteers. The records of Carthage and Jerusalem, the long list in
Greek legend of princes and princesses who died for their country, tell
the same story. In most human societies, savage as well as civilized, it
is not hard to find men who are ready to endure death for their
fellow-citizens. We need not suppose that the martyrs were always the
noblest of the human race. They were sometimes mad—hysterical or
megalomaniac: sometimes reckless and desperate: sometimes, as in the
curious case attested of the Roman armies on the Danube, they were men
of strong desires and weak imagination ready to die at the end of a
short period, if in the meantime they might glut all their senses with
unlimited indulgence.<span
id="an_fr_35_1"></span>[35\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fn_35_1.md)

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

Still, when all is said, there is nothing that stirs men's imagination
like the contemplation of martyrdom, and it is no wonder that the more
emotional cults of antiquity vibrate with the worship of this dying
Saviour, the Sôsipolis, the Sôtêr, who in so many forms dies with his
world or for his world, and rises again as the world rises, triumphant
through suffering over Death and the broken *Tabu*.

*Tabu* is at first sight a far more prominent element in the primitive
religions than *Mana*, just as misfortune and crime are more highly
coloured and striking than prosperity and decent behaviour. To an early
Greek tribe the world of possible action was sharply divided between
what was Themis and what was Not Themis, between lawful and *tabu*, holy
and unholy, correct and forbidden. To do a thing that was not Themis was
a sure source of public disaster. Consequently it was of the first
necessity in a life full of such perils to find out the exact rules
about them. How is that to be managed? Themis is ancient law: it is
<u>τὰ πάτρια</u>, the way of our ancestors, the thing that has always
been done and is therefore divinely right. In ordinary life, of course,
Themis is clear. Every one knows it. But from time to time new
emergencies arise, the like of which we have never seen, and they
frighten us. We must go to the Gerontes, the Old Men of the Tribe; they
will perhaps remember what our fathers did. What they tell us will be
*Presbiston*, a word which means indifferently 'oldest' and
'best'—<u>αἰεὶ δὲ νεώτεροι ἀφραδέουσιν</u>, 'Young men are always being
foolish'. <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> Of course, if there is a
Basileus, a holy King, he by his special power may perhaps know best of
all, though he too must take care not to gainsay the Old Men.

For the whole problem is to find out <u>τὰ πάτρια</u>, the ways that our
fathers followed. And suppose the Old Men themselves fail us, what must
we needs do? Here we come to a famous and peculiar Greek custom, for
which I have never seen quoted any exact parallel or any satisfactory
explanation. If the Old Men fail us, we must go to those older still, go
to our great ancestors, the <u>ἥρωες</u>, the Chthonian people, lying in
their sacred tombs, and ask them to help. The word <u>χρᾶν</u> means
both 'to lend money' and 'to give an oracle', two ways of helping people
in an emergency. Sometimes a tribe might happen to have a real ancestor
buried in the neighbourhood; if so, his tomb would be an oracle. More
often perhaps, for the memories of savage tribes are very precarious,
there would be no well-recorded personal tomb. The oracle would be at
some place sacred to the Chthonian people in general, or to some
particular personification of them, a Delphi or a cave of Trophônius, a
place of Snakes and Earth. You go to the Chthonian folk for guidance
because they are themselves the Oldest of the Old Ones, and they know
the real custom: they know what is Presbiston, what is Themis. And by an
easy extension of this knowledge they are also supposed to know what is.
He who knows the law fully to the uttermost also knows what will happen
if the law is broken. It is, I think, important to realize that the
normal reason for consulting an oracle was not to ask questions of fact.
It was that some emergency had arisen in which men simply wanted to know
how they ought to behave. The advice they received in this way varied
from <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> the virtuous to the abominable, as
the religion itself varied. A great mass of oracles can be quoted
enjoining the rules of customary morality, justice, honesty, piety, duty
to a man's parents, to the old, and to the weak. But of necessity the
oracles hated change and strangled the progress of knowledge. Also, like
most manifestations of early religion, they throve upon human terror:
the more blind the terror the stronger became their hold. In such an
atmosphere the lowest and most beastlike elements of humanity tended to
come to the front; and religion no doubt as a rule joined with them in
drowning the voice of criticism and of civilization, that is, of reason
and of mercy. When really frightened the oracle generally fell back on
some remedy full of pain and blood. The medieval plan of burning
heretics alive had not yet been invented. But the history of uncivilized
man, if it were written, would provide a vast list of victims, all of
them innocent, who died or suffered to expiate some portent or
*monstrum*—some reported <u>τέρας</u>—with which they had nothing
whatever to do, which was in no way altered by their suffering, which
probably never really happened at all, and if it did was of no
consequence. The sins of the modern world in dealing with heretics and
witches have perhaps been more gigantic than those of primitive men, but
one can hardy rise from the record of these ancient observances without
being haunted by the judgement of the Roman poet:

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Tantum religio potuit suadere
malorum,</span>  

and feeling with him that the lightening of this cloud, the taming of
this blind dragon, must rank among the very greatest services that
Hellenism wrought for mankind.

### FOOTNOTES:

<div class="footnote">

<span id="an_fn_6_1"></span>[6\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fr_6_1.md) Professor Émile
Durkheim in his famous analysis of the religious emotions argues that
when a man feels the belief and the command as something coming from
without, superior, authoritative, of infinite import, it is because
religion is the work of the tribe and, as such, superior to the
individual. The voice of God is the imagined voice of the whole tribe,
heard or imagined by him who is going to break its laws. I have some
difficulty about the psychology implied in this doctrine: surely the
apparent externality of the religious command seems to belong to a
fairly common type of experience, in which the personality is divided,
so that first one part of it and then another emerges into
consciousness. If you forget an engagement, sometimes your peace is
disturbed for quite a long time by a vague external annoyance or
condemnation, which at last grows to be a distinct judgement—'Heavens! I
ought to be at the Committee on So-and-so.' But apart from this
criticism, there is obviously much historical truth in Professor
Durkheim's theory, and it is not so different as it seems at first sight
from the ordinary beliefs of religious men. The tribe to primitive man
is not a mere group of human beings. It is his whole world. The savage
who is breaking the laws of his tribe has all his world—totems, tabus,
earth, sky and all—against him. He cannot be at peace with God.

The position of the hero or martyr who defies his tribe for the sake of
what he thinks the truth or the right can easily be thought out on these
lines. He defies this false temporary Cosmos in loyalty to the true and
permanent Cosmos.

See Durkheim, 'Les Formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse', in
*Travaux de l'Année Sociologique*, 1912; or G. Davy, 'La Sociologie de
M. Durkheim', in *Rev. Philosophique*, xxxvi, pp. 42-71 and 160-85.

<span id="an_fn_8_1"></span>[8\_1](fsgr05.htm#an_fr_8_1.md) I suspect that
most reforms pass through this stage. A man somehow feels clear that
some new course is, for him, right, though he cannot marshal the
arguments convincingly in favour of it, and may even admit that the
weight of obvious evidence is on the other side. We read of judges in
the seventeenth century who believed that witches ought to be burned and
that the persons before them were witches, and yet would not burn
them—evidently under the influence of vague half-realized feelings. I
know a vegetarian who thinks that, as far as he can see, carnivorous
habits are not bad for human health and actually tend to increase the
happiness of the species of animals eaten—as the adoption of Swift's
*Modest Proposal* would doubtless relieve the economic troubles of the
human race, and yet feels clear that for him the ordinary flesh meal (or
'feasting on corpses') would 'partake of the nature of sin'. The path of
progress is paved with inconsistencies, though it would be an error to
imagine that the people who habitually reject any higher promptings that
come to them are really any more consistent.

what the <u>βασίλιννα</u> and <u>γεραιραί</u> had to do in the festival;

<div class="footnote">

<span id="an_fn_18_2"></span>[18\_2](fsgr05.htm#an_fr_18_2.md) One might
perhaps say, in all three. <u>Ἀνθίστηρος τοῦ Πυθοχρηστοῦ κοινόν</u> is
the name of a society of worshippers in the island of Thera, *I. G. I.*
iii. 329. This gives a god Anthister, who is clearly identified with
Dionysus, and seems to be a projection of a feast Anthisteria =
Anthesteria. The inscription is of the second century <span
class="smcap">b. c.</span> and it seems likely that
Anthister-Anthisteria, with their clear derivation from <u>ἀνθίζειν</u>,
are corruptions of the earlier and difficult forms
<u>Ἀνθέστηρ-Ἀνθεστήρια</u>. It is noteworthy that Thera, an island lying
rather outside the main channels of civilization, kept up throughout its
history a tendency to treat the 'epithet' as a full person. Hikesios and
Koures come very early; also Polieus and Stoichaios without the name
Zeus; Delphinios, Karneios, Aiglatas, and Aguieus without Apollo.

fifty children, and Heracles, most prolific of all, his several hundred.
The particular numbers chosen, however, are probably due to other
