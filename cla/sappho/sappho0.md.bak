Immortal Aphrodite of the shimmering thone, daughter of Zeus, weaver of
wiles, I pray thee crush not my spirit with anguish and distress, O
Queen. But come hither if ever before thou didst hear my voice afar, and
hearken, and leaving the golden house of thy father, camest with chariot
yoked, and swift birds drew thee, their swift pinions fluttering over
the dark earth, from heaven through mid-space. Quickly they arrived; and
thou blessed one with immortal countenance smiling didst ask: What now
is befallen me and why now I call and what I in my heart's madness, most
desire. What fair one now wouldst thou draw to love thee? Who wrongs
thee Sappho? For even if she flies she shall soon follow and if she
rejects gifts, shall soon offer them and if she loves not shall soon
love, however reluctant. Come I pray thee now and release me from cruel
cares, and let my heart accomplish all that it desires, and be thou my
ally.

>                      I
>     Shimmering-throned immortal Aphrodite,
>     Daughter of Zeus, Enchantress, I implore thee,

That one seems to me the equal of the gods, who sits in thy presence and
hears near him thy sweet voice and lovely laughter; that indeed makes my
heart beat fast in my bosom. For when I see thee even a little I am
bereft of utterance, my tongue is useless and at once a subtle fire
races under my skin, my eyes see nothing, my ears ring, sweat pours
forth and all my body is seized with trembling. I am paler than
\[dried\] grass and seem in my madness little better than dead, but I
must dare all ...

With the emendations by Mr. J.M. Edmonds, the reprinting of which he has
been kind enough to permit, a nearly literal rendering would be as
follows:

Some say that the fairest thing upon the dark earth is a host of
horsemen, and some say a host of foot soldiers, and others again a fleet
of ships, but for me it is my beloved. And it is easy to make anyone
understand this. When Helen saw the most beautiful of mortals, she chose
for best that one, the destroyer of all the honour of Troy and though
not much of child or dear parent, but was led astray by Love, to bestow
her heart far off, for woman is ever easy to lead astray when she thinks
of no account what is near and dear. Even so, Anactoria, you do not
remember, it seems, when she is with you, one the gentle sound of whose
footfall I would rather see than all the chariots and mail-clad footmen
of Lydia. I know that in this world man cannot have the best; yet to
pray for a part of what was once shared is better than to forget it...

>                      I
>
>     A troop of horse, the serried ranks of marchers,
>     A noble fleet, some think these of all on earth
>     Most beautiful. For me naught else regarding

>
>                      II
>
>     To understand this is for all most simple,
>     For thus gazing much on mortal perfectino
>     And knowing already what life could give her,
>          Him chose fair Helen,
>
>                      III
>
>     Him the betrayer of Ilium's honour.
>     The recked she not of adored child or parent,
>     But yielded to love, and forced by her passion,
>          Dared Fate in exile.

The stars about the full moon lose their bright beauty when she, almost
full, illumines all earth with silver.

>     The gleaming stars all about the shining moon

Quoted by Eustathius of Thessalonica in the twelfth century.

And by the cool stream the breeze murmurs through apple branches and
slumber pours down from quivering leaves.

>     By the cool water the breeze murmurs, rustling
>     Through apple branches, while from quivering leaves
>         Streams down deep slumber.

This beautiful fragment is quoted by Hermogenes about A.D. 170.
Demetrius, about A.D. 150, says that it is part of Sappho's description
of the garden of the nymphs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="6">6</span>

Come, goddess of Cyprus, and in golden cups serve nectar delicately
mixed with delights.

>     Come hither foam-born Cyprian goddess, come,
>     And in golden goblets pour richest nectar
>     All mixed in most ethereal perfection,
>          Thus to delight us.

Quoted by Athenaeus, who wrote in the first half of the third century
A.D. The fragment is apparently part of an invocation to Aphrodite.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="7">7</span>

>     H?' se ku'pros kai` Pa'fos h?` Pa'normos

If thee, Cyprus or Paphos or Panormos \[holds\].

This is from Strabo, early first century A.D. Panormos was a frequent
name, and does not refer to Palermo, which was not founded in Sappho's
time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="8">8</span>

>     Soi' d? e?'go deu'kas e?'pi bw^mon a?'igos
>     ...
>     kapilei'psw toi ...

But for thee I will bring to the altar \[the young\] of a white goat...
and add a libation for thee.

Cited by Apollonius of Alexadria about A.D. 140. The reading is
uncertain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="9">9</span>

>     Ai?'ð? e?'go xrusoste'fan? A?fro'dita,
>     to'nde to`n pa'lon laxo'hn.

May I win this prize, O golden-crowned Aphrodite.

From Apollonius. Sappho invented many beautiful epithets to apply to
Aphrodite, and this fragment contains one of them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="10">10</span>

>     Ai?' me timi'an e?po'hsan e?'rga
>     ta` sfa` doi^sai;

Who made me gifts and honoured me?

From Apollonius, illustrating Aeolic dialect in the word sfa'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="11">11</span>

>     ... Ta'de nu^n e?tai'rais
>     tai^s e?'maisi te'rpna ka'lws a?ei'sw.

This will I now sing skilfully to please my friends.

Athanaeus quotes this to show that there is not necessarily any reproach
in the word e?tai'rai. Like many others, the fragment is unfortunately
too short for anything but a literal translation. The breathing of the
word in question in Attic Greek would of course be rough.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="12">12</span>

>     ... O?'ttinas ga`r
>     eu?^ ðe'w kh^noi' me ma'lista ci'nnontai
>     ...

For thee to whom I do good, thou harmest me the most.

From the "Etymologicum Magnum," tenth century A.D.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="13">13</span>

>     E?'gw de` kh^n? o?'ttw tis e?'patai.

But that which one desires I.

Quoted by Apollonius and in 1914 found to be part of the poem in the
"Oxyrhynchus Papyrus," No. 1231.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="14">14</span>

>     tai^s kalais u?'mmin [to`] no'hma tw?^mon
>          oi? dia'meipton.

To you, fair maidens, my mind does not change.

Quoted by Apollonius to illustrate the Aeolic form u?'mmin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="15">15</span>

>     ....E?'gwn d? e?mau'ta
>          tou^to cu'noida.

And this I feel myself.

Quoted by Apollonius to illustrate Aeolic method of accentuation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="16">16</span>

>     taisi [de`] psu^xros me'n e?'gento ðu^mos
>     pa`r d? i?'eisi ta` pte'ra ...

But the spirit within them turned chill and down dropped their wings.

The Scholist quotes this to show that Sappho says the same thing of
doves as Pindar (Pyth. 1-10) says of the eagle of Zeus.

Another reading is psau^kros, "light", for psu^xros, "moist or chill."
The sense would then be "the spirit within them became light and they
relaxed their wings in rest."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="17">17</span>

>     ... kat? e?'mon sta'lagmon,
>     to`n d? e?pipla'zontes a?'moi fe'roien
>          kai` meledw'nais.

From my distress: let buffeting winds bear it and all care away.

From the "Etymologicum Magnum" to show the Aeolic use of z in place of
ss. Bergk conjectures a?'moi for a?'nemoi, "winds". The fragment is
tantilizingly incomplete, as so many others are, and the reading of one
or two words in not certain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <span id="18">18</span>

>     Arti'ws m? a? xrusope'dillos A?u'ws.

Just now the golden-sandalled Dawn \[has called\].

There could hardly be a more beautiful epithet than "golden-sandalled"
to apply to the Dawn. It is fully equal in this respect to
"rosy-fingered," and in Greek both words are beautiful in sound.

This is quoted by Ammonius of Alexandria about A.D. 400 to show Sappho's
use of A?rti'ws.
