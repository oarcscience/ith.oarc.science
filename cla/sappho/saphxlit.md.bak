# The Poems of Sappho

### System of Greek Transliteration

#### \[J.B. Hare\]

Sappho's poems are written in Aoelian Greek, spoken in antiquity in the
North-Eastern Aegean. This is a rustic and more archaic dialect than the
Attic or New Testament Greek which is typically taught in schools,
closer to the Homeric. Indeed, many of the confirmed surviving Sappho
fragments are from quotes in Roman grammatical treatises to illustrate
fine points of the Aeolic dialect (The early Christians burned most of
her poems, but couldn't eradicate every stray line of hers that was
quoted in some textbook). In some cases the Sappho fragments are
references in texts to quotes in other (lost) texts.

In this text, transliterated Greek text is shown in a monospaced font,
e.g, Psa'pfa. The system of transliteration has been designed so that
the Greek text can be migrated to Unicode automatically at some point,
balancing of readability and resemblance to the original Greek letter.
For this reason, it was felt that there should be exactly one character
per grapheme, except where it would be unambigous (ks and ps). The ð
(&eth; in HTML) (capital Ð) symbol is used to transcribe theta, because
h is being used for eta and th would be ambiguous; the ð symbol
represnts a similar sound to theta (abeit a voiced version, as in 'the')
in Old English. Capitalized letters are written as the equivalent
capital Latin letter. Although there were a couple of left over Latin
characters, they were left out of the mix since standalone use of the
letters 'c' and 'q' would just make the resulting transcriptions look
stranger than they already are. Hopefully, if you are slightly familiar
with Greek orthography, this system should only take a few moments to
get up to speed with.

Accent marks follow the vowel they are placed on, including (for
consistency) the breath marks ! and ?. \[Note that the rough breath mark
does not acutally appear in this corpus because it is not found in
Aeolian Greek, except in one case ([\#112](sappho3.htm#112).md) where the
poem was rewritten in Attic.\] This is done even if the vowel is
capitalized (in which case the Greek has the breathing mark written
before the vowel, e.g. Helen, written here E?le'na, is actually spelled
?Ele'na).

Note also that an diaresis (umlaut) iota is found occasionally in long
vowel combinations. This is written as the HTML ï (&iuml;). This has no
special phonetic significance as far as I know; it just seems to be an
orthographic convention.

The following table gives the name of the Greek letter, the letter by
which it is transcribed, and an approximate pronunciation (for
non-experts). If you know nothing about Greek, and you want to try
reading the Greek out loud (which I heartily recommend), just ignore the
punctuation marks and pronounce h as 'e', w as 'o', and j as 'y'.
