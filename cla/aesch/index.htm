<P>
Aeschylus, called "the father of tragedy," was one of the three greatest
tragic dramatists of the ancient world,
along with <A HREF="../eurip/index.htm">Euripides</A> and <A HREF="../soph/index.htm">Sophocles</A>.
Born at Eleusis in 525 B.C.E. to a noble family, Aeschylus fought
at Marathon and other battles of the Persian war.
He introduced the concept of the dramatic trilogy
(so he could also be called the "father of the sequel").
The <CITE>Oresteia</CITE> is the only trilogy of his
that we still have intact;
for instance, <CITE>the Persians</CITE> is part of
a lost trilogy about the Persian war.
Aeschylus employed dialog rather than the chorus
to move the narrative along, which was a key step towards modern drama.
He spent most of his career in Athens but exiled himself
to Sicily after writing the <CITE>Eumenides</CITE>.
He died in 456 B.C.E.
