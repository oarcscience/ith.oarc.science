titleh1: "The Dramas of Aeschylus"

Aeschylus, called "the father of tragedy," was one of the three greatest
tragic dramatists of the ancient world, along with
[Euripides](../eurip/index) and [Sophocles](../soph/index.md). Born at
Eleusis in 525 B.C.E. to a noble family, Aeschylus fought at Marathon
and other battles of the Persian war. He introduced the concept of the
dramatic trilogy (so he could also be called the "father of the
sequel"). The Oresteia is the only trilogy of his that we still have
intact; for instance, the Persians is part of a lost trilogy about the
Persian war. Aeschylus employed dialog rather than the chorus to move
the narrative along, which was a key step towards modern drama. He spent
most of his career in Athens but exiled himself to Sicily after writing
the Eumenides. He died in 456 B.C.E.
