### BOOK VI.

    The great Son of the Immortal famed in song  
I from the heart proclaim, to whom a throne,  
To be held fast the most Father gave  
Ere, he was brought forth; then was he raised up  
5 According to flesh given, washed, at the mouth  
Of the river Jordan, which goes rushing on  
Trailing its gleaming billows, from the fire  
Escaping he first shall see God's sweet Spirit  
Descending with the wings of a white dove.  
10 And a pure flower shall bloom, and springs be full.  
And he shall show the ways to men, and show  
The heavenly paths, and teach all with wise  
And he shall come for judgement and persuade  
A disobedient people while he boasts  
15 Descent praiseworthy from a heavenly Sire.  
Billows shall he tread, sickness of mankind  
Shall he destroy, he shall raise up the dead,  
And many sufferings shall he drive away;  
And from one scrip shall be men's fill of bread,

\[1. This book is scarcely entitled to a place among the Sibylline
Oracles, or to be called a book. It is a brief hymn in honor of Christ
and the cross, and probably of later date than any other portion of the
present collection.

{p. 146}

20 When the house of David shall bring forth a child;  
And in his hand the whole world, earth, heaven, sea.  
And he shall flash upon the earth, as once  
The two begotten from each other's ribs  
Saw human form appearing. It shall be  
25 When earth shall be glad in the hope of child.  
    But for thee only, Sodomitic land,  
Are evil woes laid up; for thou thyself  
Ill-disposed didst not apprehend thy God  
Who mocks at mortal schemes; but from a thorn  
30 Didst crown him with a crown, and fearful gall  
Didst mingle unto insolence and spirit.  
This shall bring evil woes about for thee.  
O the Wood, O so blessed, upon which  
God was outstretched; the earth shall not have thee,  
35 But thou shalt look upon a heavenly house,  
When thou, O God, shalt flash thine eye of fire.
