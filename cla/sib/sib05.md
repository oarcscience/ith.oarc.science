### BOOK III.

O THOU high-thundering blessed heavenly One,  
Who hast set in their place the cherubim,  
I, who have uttered what is all too true,  
Entreat thee, let me have a little rest;  
5 For my heart has grown weary from within.  
But why again leaps my heart, and my soul  
With a whip smitten from within constrained  
To utter forth its message unto all?  
But yet again will I proclaim all things  
10 Which God commands me to proclaim to men.  
O men, that in your image have a form  
Fashioned of God, why do ye vainly stray

\[1. This third book of the Oracles is the most interesting and
important of the entire collection. It is by far the longest, containing
in the Greek text 829 verses. It is believed to be mainly of Jewish
origin. In its present form, however, it is obviously a compilation of
several distinct groups of oracles, one of which, lines 117-361 (Greek
text, 97-294), contains the oldest portion of the Sibylline Oracles as
they now exist. Two quite extensive fragments which have been preserved
by Theophilus are by him said to have stood at the beginning of the
Sibyl's prophecy and probably formed an introduction to this section of
our third book (see Appendix, p. 267). In place of this more ancient
introduction the compiler of our collection has inserted the first 116
lines of this book, which may be again subdivided into three parts,
which appear to be so many separate fragments; lines 1-75, 76-111,
112-116. In some editions the first 75 lines (Greek text, 1-62) are
appended to the preceding book, and some MSS. preface this book with the
words, "Again in her third tome she says these things from the second
discourse concerning God." Other clearly distinguishable sections of
this book are the following: lines 362-616, 616-1003, 1004-1031 (Greek
text, 295-488, 489-808, 809-827). The last section purports to he a
personal vindication of the Sibyl.\]

(1-9.)

{p. 56}

And walk not in the straight way, always mindful  
Of the immortal Maker? God is one,  
15 Sovereign, ineffable, dwelling in heaven,  
The self-existent and invisible,  
Himself alone beholding everything;  
Him sculptor's hand made not, nor is his form  
Shown by man's art from gold or ivory;  
20 But he, eternal Lord, proclaims himself  
As one who is and was erst and shall be  
Again hereafter. For who being mortal  
Can see God with his eyes? Or who shall bear  
To hear the only name of heaven's great God,  
25 The ruler of the world? He by his word  
Created all things, even heaven and sea,  
And tireless sun, and full moon and bright stars,  
And mighty mother Tethys, springs and rivers,  
Imperishable fire, and days and nights.  
30 This is the God who formed four-lettered Adam,  
The first one formed, and filling with his name  
East, west, and south, and north. The same is he  
Who fixed the pattern of the human form,  
And made wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls.  
35 Ye do not worship neither fear ye God,

\[28. *Mother Tethys*.--Wife of Oceanus, mother of the rivers, and the
nymphs, three thousand in number. See Hesiod, *Theog.*, 335, *ff*.

30\. *Four-lettered Adam*.--The ingenuity which seer, in the four
letters of this name the Greek initials of the words for east, west,
north, and south surpasses even that noted in book i, 102, where Hades
is traced in the word Adam. But Augustine adopts this, and says:
"According to the Greek tongue, Adam himself signifies the whole world.
For there are four letters, A, D, A, M, and in Greek speech these are
the initial letters of the four quarters of the earth." {Greek
*?Anatolh'*}, east; {Greek *Du'sis*}, west; {Greek *?Arktos*}, north;
{Greek *Meshmbri'a*} south. Eharratio in Psalmum, xcv, 15 \[L., 37,
1236\]. See also Tractatus in Joannis, ix, 14, and x, 12 \[L., 35, 1465,
1473\].\]

(10-29.)

{p. 57}

But vainly go astray and bow the knee  
To serpents, and make offering to cats,  
And idols, and stone images of men,  
And sit before the doors of godless temples;  
40 Ye guard him who is God, who keeps all things,  
And merry with the wickedness of stones  
Forget the judgment of the immortal Saviour  
Who made the heaven and earth. Alas! a race  
That has delight in blood, deceitful, vile,  
45 Ungodly, of false, double-tongued, immoral men,  
Adulterous, idolous, designing fraud,  
An evil madness raving in their hearts,  
For themselves plundering, having shameless soul;  
For no one who has riches will impart  
50 To another, but dire wickedness shall be  
Among all mortals, and for sake of gain  
Will many widows not at all keep faith,  
But secretly love others, and the bond  
Of life those who have husbands do not keep.  
55    But when Rome shall o'er Egypt also rule  
Governing always, then shall there appear  
The greatest kingdom of the immortal King  
Over men. And a holy Lord shall come  
To hold the scepter over every land  
60 Unto all ages of fast-hastening time.

\[55. The time when Rome obtained full control of Egypt was when
Augustus became the undisputed master of the regions all about the
Mediterranean Sea, and the Roman empire became fully established. This
empire the Sibyl recognizes as beginning about the time of the
appearance of the Christ, who was born during the reign of Augustus.

58\. *Holy Lord shall come*.--The Messiah, for no other ruler could be
described by such language as the writer here employs. This passage is
evidence that at least lines 55-75 are of Christian or Jewish Christian
authorship.\]

(29-50.)

{p. 58}

And then shall come inexorable wrath  
On Latin men; three shall by piteous fate  
Endamage Rome. And perish shall all men,  
With their own houses, when from heaven shall flow  
65 A fiery cataract. Ah, wretched me!  
When shall that day and when shall judgment come  
Of the immortal God, the mighty King?  
But just now, O ye cities, ye are built  
And all adorned with temples and race-grounds,  
70 Markets, and images of wood, of gold,  
Of silver and of stone, that ye may come  
Unto the bitter day. For it shall come,  
When there shall pass among all men a stench  
Of brimstone. Yet each thing will I declare,  
75 In all the cities where men suffer ills.  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
    From the Sebastenes Beliar shall come  
Hereafter, and the height of hills shall he  
Establish, and shall make the sea stand still  
And the great fiery sun and the bright moon  
80 And he shall raise the dead, and many signs  
Work before men: but nothing shall be brought  
By him unto completion but deceit,  
And many mortals shall be lead astray  
Hebrews both true and choice, and lawless men

\[62. *Three*.--One most naturally thinks here of the famous triumvirate
of Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus; but it is difficult to explain the
"fiery cataract" (line 65) and other pictures of judgment in immediate
connection with those historic names.

76\. The *Sebastenes* are most naturally understood of the inhabitants
of Sebaste, or Samaria, and a Jewish writer living in the time of
Augustus might have been readily disposed to think of a
Beliar--antichrist--as issuing from among the hated Samaritans. Comp.
the miracle-working antichrist of Dan. vii 25; viii, 23-25; xi, 36; and
also 2 Thess. ii, 8-10.\]

(51-69.)

{p. 59}

85 Besides who never gave ear to God's word.  
But when the threatenings of the mighty God  
Shall draw near, and a flaming power shall come  
By billow to the earth, it shall consume  
Both Beliar and all the haughty men  
90 Who put their trust in him. And thereupon  
Shall the whole world be governed by the hands  
Of a woman and obedient everywhere.  
Then when a widow shall o'er all the world  
Gain the rule, and cast in the mighty sea  
95 Both gold and silver, also brass and iron  
Of short lived men into the deep shall cast,  
Then all the elements shall be bereft  
Of order, when the God who dwells on high  
Shall roll the heaven, even as a scroll is rolled;  
100 And to the mighty earth and sea shall fall  
The entire multiform sky; and there shall flow  
A tireless cataract of raging fire,  
And it shall burn the land, and burn the sea,  
And heavenly sky, and night, and day, and melt  
105 Creation itself together and pick out  
What is pure. No more laughing spheres of light,  
Nor night, nor dawn, nor many days of care,  
Nor spring, nor winter, nor the summer-time,

\[92-93. *A woman ... a widow*.--If we find in the "three" of line 62 a
reference to the triumvirs Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, it is but
natural to understand this "widow" as Cleopatra of Egypt, who captivated
by her charms both Julius Caesar and Antony. But here again the picture
of world-judgment which immediately follows is difficult to account for
in connection with such a mention of Cleopatra. Is not the entire
passage rather an ideal apocalyptic concept, to be understood somewhat
after the manner of the woman portrayed in John's Apocalypse, xvii, 3;
xviii, 7; a symbol of Rome herself conceived as the mistress of nations?
Comp. book viii, 263; 165, Comp. book ii, 263; viii, 646.\]

(70-90.)

{p. 60}

Nor autumn. And then of the mighty God  
110 The judgment midway in a mighty age  
Shall come, when all these things shall come to pass.  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
O navigable waters and each land  
Of the Orient and of the Occident,  
Subject shall all things be to him who comes  
115 Into the world again, and therefore he  
Himself became first conscious of his power.  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
    But when the threatenings of the mighty God  
Are fulfilled, which he threatened mortals once,  
When in Assyrian land they built a tower;--  
120 (And they all spoke one language, and resolved  
To mount aloft into the starry heaven;  
But on the air the Immortal straightway put  
A mighty force; and then winds from above  
Cast down the great tower and stirred mortals up  
125 To wrangling with each other; therefore men  
Gave to that city the name of Babylon);--  
Now when the tower fell and the tongues of men  
Turned to all sorts of sounds, straightway all earth  
Was filled with men and kingdoms were divided;

\[112-116. This fragment has no necessary connection with what precedes
or follows, and the MSS. are defective at this point.

117-129. This passage is cited in Theophilus, *ad Autol*., ii, 31 \[G.,
6, 1101\]; Josephus, *Ant.*, i, iv, 3. Comp. Eusebius, *Præp. Evang.*,
ix, 14 \[G., 21, 702, 703\]. See Gen. xi, 1-9. It is one of the oldest
portions of the Sibyllines, but begins abruptly, as if its natural
preceding context had been omitted.

122\. *Winds*.--"The idea that God threw down the tower by means of the
winds was probably first written down by our poet, but it is really
nothing but a subtile interpretation of Gen. xi, 7."--*Ewald*, p. 33.\]

(91-107.)

{p. 61}

130 And then the generation tenth appeared  
Of mortal men, from the time when the flood  
Came upon earlier men. And Cronos reigned,  
And Titan and Iapetus; and men called them  
Best offspring of Gaia and of Uranus,  
135 Giving to them names both of earth and heaven,  
Since they were very first of mortal men.  
So there were three divisions of the earth  
According to the allotment of each man,  
And each one having his own portion reigned  
140 And fought not; for a father's oaths were there  
And equal were their portions. But the time  
Complete of old age on the father came,  
And he died; and the sons infringing oaths  
Stirred up against each other bitter strife,  
145 Which one should have the royal rank and rule  
Over all mortals; and against each other  
Cronos and Titan fought. But Rhea and Gaia,  
And Aphrodite fond of crowns, Demeter,  
And Hestia and Dione of fair locks  
150 Brought them to friendship, and together called  
All who were kings, both brothers and near kin,  
And others of the same ancestral blood,

\[130. *Generation tenth*.--Cited by Athenagoras, *Legatio pro
Christianis*, xxx. \[G., 6, 960\], and Tertul., *ad Nationes*, ii, 12
\[L., 1, 603\]. In citing this passage Tertullian thus speaks of the
Sibyl: "The Sibyl was earlier than all literature, that Sibyl, I mean,
who was the true prophetess of truth. In hexameter verse she thus
expounds the descent and exploits of Saturn."

132\. *Cronos*.--Greek name for the more familiar Latin title Saturn.
The story of the Titans in the following lines (132-187) is familiar to
students of Greek mythology, but the old myth exists with numerous minor
variations, and, according to Hesiod (*Theog.*, 453-500), the birth and
preservation of Zeus were somewhat different from this story.\]

(108-126.)

{p. 62}

And they judged Cronos should reign king of all,  
For he was oldest and of noblest form.  
155 But Titan laid on Cronos mighty oaths  
To rear no male posterity, that he  
Himself might reign when age and fate should come  
To Cronos. And whenever Rhea bore  
Beside her sat the Titans, and all males  
160 In pieces tore, but let the females live  
To be reared by the mother. But When now  
At the third birth the august Rhea bore,  
She brought forth Hera first; and when they saw  
A female offspring, the fierce Titan men  
165 Betook them to their homes. And thereupon  
Rhea a male child bore, and having bound  
Three men of Crete by oath she quickly sent  
Him into Phrygia to be reared apart  
In secret; therefore did they name him Zeus,  
170 For he was sent away. And thus she sent  
Poseidon also secretly away.  
And Pluto, third, did Rhea yet again,  
Noblest of women, at Dodona bear,  
Whence flows Europus' river's liquid course,  
175 And with Peneus mixed pours in the sea  
Its water, and men call it Stygian.

\[173-176. There was a *Dodona* in Epirus, ruins of which found near
Jaunina were excavated in 1896; there was also a *Dodona* in northern
Thessaly, and each of these places was the seat of an ancient and
celebrated oracle. The Sibylline writer does not distinguish between the
two. *Europus* is another name for the Titaresius, which, according to
Strabo (*Geog*. ix, 5, 19; and *Fragment* 15) was a tributary to the
Peneus, and flowed with it through the vale of Tempe to the sea. Comp.
Homer, *Iliad* ii, 750-755, where mention is made of "wintry Dodona,"
and "lovely Titaresius," which, however, does not mingle with the
Peneus, because it is a broken-off portion of the Styx.\]

(127-146.)

{p. 63}

But when the Titans heard that there were sons  
Kept secretly, whom Cronos and his wife  
Rhea begat, then Titan sixty youths  
180 Together gathered, and held fast in chains  
Cronos and his wife Rhea, and concealed  
Them in the earth and guarded them in bonds.  
And then the sons of powerful Cronos heard,  
And a great war and uproar they aroused.  
185 And this is the beginning of dire war  
Among all mortals. \[For it is indeed  
With mortals the prime origin of war.\]  
    And then did God award the Titans evil.  
And all of Titans and of Cronos born  
190 Died. But then as time rolled around there rose  
The Egyptian kingdom, then that of the Persians  
And of the Medes, and Ethiopians,  
And of Assyria and Babylon,  
And then that of the Macedonians,  
195 Egyptian yet again, then that of Rome.  
    And then a message of the mighty God  
Was set within my breast, and it bade me  
Proclaim through all earth and in royal hearts  
Plant things which are to be. And to my mind  
200 This God imparted first, bow many kingdoms  
Have been together gathered of mankind.  
    For first of all the house of Solomon  
Shall include horsemen of Phœnicia  
And Syria, and of the islands too,  
205 And the race of Pamphylians and Persians  
And Phrygians, Carians, and Mysians

\[202. *House of Solomon*.--The kingdom of Solomon is here made to rule
over nations which Old Testament history never mentions as subject to
Israel. Comp. 1 Kings iv, 21. But the poet wishes to magnify that
realm.\]

(147-170.)

{p. 64}

And the race of the Lydians rich in gold.  
    And then shall Hellenes, proud and impure,  
Then shall a Macedonian nation rule,  
210 Great, shrewd, who as a fearful cloud of war  
Shall come to mortals. But the God of heaven  
Shall utterly destroy them from the depth.  
    And then shall be another kingdom, white  
And many-headed, from the western sea,  
215 Which shall rule much land, and shake many men,  
And to all kings bring terror afterwards,  
And out of many cities shall destroy  
Much gold and silver; but in the vast earth  
There will again be gold, and silver too,  
220 And ornament. And they will oppress mortals;  
And to those men shall great disaster be,  
When they begin unrighteous arrogance.  
And forthwith in them there shall be a force  
Of wickedness, male will consort with male,  
225 And children they will place in dens of shame;  
And in those days there shall be among men  
A great affliction, and it shall disturb  
All things, and break all things, and fill all things  
With evils by a shameful covetousness,  
230 And by ill-gotten wealth in many lands,

\[208. *Hellenes*.--The Græco-Macedonian kingdom is here evidently
intended.

213\. *Another kingdom*.--That of Rome, here called *white*, or
brilliant, in allusion to the white toga worn by the Roman magistrates.
Competitors for office were called *candidati*, because of the white
robe in which they presented themselves. Martial (*Epig.*, viii, 65, 6)
speaks of *candida cultu Roma*--"Rome white in apparel," The epithet
*many-headed* has been supposed to point to Rome while she was yet a
republic and had her hundred or more senators as rulers. But there may
be an allusion to the biblical symbolism of Dan. vii, 6, and Rev. xiii,
1.\]

(170-190.)

{p. 65}

But most of all in Macedonia.  
And it shall stir up hatred, and all guile  
Shalt be with them even to the seventh kingdom,  
Of which a king of Egypt shall be king  
235 Who shall be a descendant from the Greeks.  
    And then the nation of the mighty God  
Shall be again strong and they shall be guides  
Of life to all men. But why did God place  
This also in my mind to tell: what first,  
240 And what next, and what evil last shall be  
On all men? Which of these shall take the lead?  
    First on the Titans will God visit evil.  
For they shall pay to mighty Cronos's sons  
The penal satisfaction, since they bound  
245 Both Cronos and the mother dearly loved.  
Again shall there be tyrants for the Greeks  
And fierce kings overweening and impure,  
Adulterous and altogether bad;  
And for men shall be no more rest from war.  
250 And the dread Phrygians shall perish all,  
And unto Troy shall evil come that day.  
And to the Persians and Assyrians  
Evil shall straightaway come, and to all Egypt  
And Libya and the Ethiopians,  
255 And to the Carians and Pamphylians--

\[233. *Seventh kingdom*.--Or seventh king (comp. line 765) of the Greek
Egyptian dynasty. This would point to Ptolemy Philometer it we reckon
Alexander the Great as the first king, but Ptolemy Physcon if the line
of the Ptolemies alone are reckoned. Ewald adopts this latter view,
Alexandre the former. All the Ptolemies were of Greek (or Macedonian)
origin.

237\. *Again strong*.--The writer seems in the spirit and hope of Old
Testament prophets to conceive a triumph for the chosen people, is
following hard upon the evils of his own time.

242-245.--This passage is in part a repetition of lines 188-190 above.\]

(190-209.)

{p. 66}

Evil to pass from one place to another,  
And to all mortals. Why now one by one  
Do I speak forth? But when the first receive  
Fulfillment, then straightway shall come on men  
260 The second. So the very first I'll tell.  
    There shall an evil come to pious men  
Who dwell by the great temple of Solomon  
And who are progeny of righteous men.  
Alike of all these also I will tell  
265 The tribe and line of fathers and homeland--  
All things with care, O mortal shrewd in mind.  
There is a city . . . on the earth,  
Ur of the Chaldees, whence there is a race  
Of men most righteous, to whom both good will  
270 And noble deeds have ever been a care.  
For they have no concern about the course  
Of the sun's revolution, nor the moon's,  
Nor wondrous things beneath the earth, nor depth  
Of joy-imparting sea Oceanus,  
275 Nor signs of sneezing, nor the wings of birds,  
Nor soothsayers, nor wizards, nor enchanters,  
Nor tricks of dull words of ventriloquists,  
Neither do they astrologize with skill  
28 Of the Chaldeans, nor astronomize;  
O For these are all deceptive, in so far  
As foolish men go seeking day by day  
Training their souls unto no useful work;

\[266. *Mortal shrewd*.--Comp. i, 8.

267.--The passage is corrupt, and the reading adopted in our version is
to some extent conjectural, but has some support in manuscripts and
suits the context. The critical student should consult Alexandre's note
in his edition of 1841, p. 111. On "Ur of the Chaldees" see Gen. xi, 31.
Others, however, following another conjectural reading, understand the
city to be Jerusalem. So Ewald, p. 21.\]

(209-230)

{p. 67}

And then did they teach miserable men  
Deceptions, whence to mortals on the earth  
285 Come many evils leading them astray  
From good ways and just deeds. But they have care  
For righteousness and virtue, and not greed,  
Which breeds unnumbered ills to mortal men,  
War and unending famine. But with them  
290 Just measure, both in fields and cities, holds,  
Nor steal they from each other in the night,  
Nor drive off herds of cattle, sheep, and goats,  
Nor neighbor remove landmarks of a neighbor,  
Nor any man of great wealth grieve the one  
295 Less favored, nor to widows cause distress,  
But rather aids them, ever helping them  
With wheat and wine and oil; and always does  
The rich man in the country send a share  
At the time of the harvests unto them  
300 That have not, but are needy, thus fulfilling  
The saying of the mighty God, a hymn  
In legal setting; for the Heavenly One  
Finished the earth a common good for all.  
    Now when the people of twelve tribes depart  
305 From Egypt, and with leaders sent of God  
Nightly pursue their way by a pillar of fire  
And during all the day by one of cloud,  
For them then God a leader will appoint--  
A great man, Moses, whom a princess found

His own law God delivered them from heaven  
315 Writing on two flat stones all righteous things  
Which he enjoined to do; and if, perchance,  
One give no heed, he must unto the law  
Make satisfaction, either at men's hands  
Or, if men's notice he escape, he shall  
320 By ample satisfaction he destroyed.  
\[For the Heavenly finished earth a common good  
For all, and in all hearts as best gift thought.\]  
To them alone the bounteous field yields fruit  
A hundredfold from one, and thus completes  
325 God's measure. But to them shall also come  
Misfortune, nor do they escape from plague.  
And even thou, forsaking thy fair shrine,  
Shalt flee away when it becomes thy lot  
To leave the holy land. And thou shalt be  
330 Carried to the Assyrians, and shalt see  
Young children and wives serving hostile men;  
And every means of life and wealth shall perish;  
And every land shall be filled up with thee,  
And every sea; and everyone shall be  
335 Offended with thy customs; and thy land  
Shall all be desert; and the altar fenced  
And temple of the great God and long walls  
Shall all fall to the ground, since in thy heart  
The holy law of the immortal God  
340 Thou didst not keep, but, erring, thou didst serve  
Unseemly images, and didst not fear  
The immortal Father, God of all mankind,  
Nor will to honor him; but images  
Of mortals thou didst honor Therefore now

345 Of time seven decades shall thy fruitful land  
And the wonders of thy temple all be waste.  
But there remains for thee a goodly end  
And greatest glory, as the immortal God  
Granted thee. But do thou wait and confide  
350 In the great God's pure laws, when he shall lift  
Thy wearied knee upright unto the light.  
And then will God from heaven send a king  
To judge each man in blood and light of fire.  
There is a royal tribe, the race of which  
355 Shall be unfailing; and as times revolve  
This race shall bear rule and begin to build  
God's temple new. And all the Persian kings  
Shall aid with bronze and gold and well-wrought iron.  
For God himself will give the holy dream  
360 By night. And then the temple shall again  
Be, as it was before. . . .

352\. The king here referred to is perhaps best explained of Cyrus, and
the description should be compared with Isa. xliv, 28; xlv, 14. Ewald
(p. 32) understands the king to be the Messiah, and, indeed, the
language of lines 352 and 353 (Greek text, 286, 287), taken apart from
the context, naturally suggests a supernatural ruler and judge. The poet
may have intended to connect the advent of the Messiah with the
restoration of the Jews and the rebuilding of their temple. But the
context here and in the parallel passage, lines 817-826 below, points
rather to Cyrus, whom Isaiah calls the anointed one of Jehovah and
represents as the conqueror of nations, "saying of Jerusalem, She shall
be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid."

954\. *Royal tribe*.--Judah, which returned from Babylonian exile, and
under Zerubbabel, a descendant of the house of David (Matt. i, 12; Luke
iii, 27), rebuilt the temple.

of Zechariah and Haggai (comp. Ezra v, i).\]

    Now when my soul had rest from inspired song,  
And I prayed the great Father for a rest  
From constraint; even in my heart again  
365 Was set a message of the mighty God  
And he bade me proclaim through all the earth  
And plant in royal minds things yet to be.  
And in my mind God put this first to say  
How many lamentable sufferings  
370 The Immortal purposed upon Babylon  
Because she his great temple had destroyed.  
    Alas, alas for thee! O Babylon,  
And for the offspring of the Assyrian men!  
Through all the earth the rush of sinful men  
375 Shall some time come, and shout of mortal men  
And stroke of the great God, who inspires songs,  
Shall ruin every land. For high in air to thee  
O Babylon, shall it come from above,  
And out of heaven from holy ones to thee  
380 Shall it come down, and the soul in thy children  
Shall the Eternal utterly destroy.  
And then shalt thou be, as thou wast before,  
As one not born; and then shalt thou be filled  
Again with blood, as thou thyself before  
385 Didst shed that of good, just, and holy men,  
Whose blood yet cries out to the lofty heaven.

And desolations shall thy cities be.

Which they will call a comet, sign to men  
415 Of the sword and of famine and of death,  
And murder of great leaders and chief men.  
    And yet again there shall be among men  
Greatest signs; for deep-eddying Tanais  
Shall leave Mæotis's lake, and there shall be  
420 Down the deep stream a fruitful, furrow's track,  
And the vast flow shall hold a neck of land.  
And there are hollow chasms and yawning pits;  
And many cities, men and all, shall fall:--  
In Asia--Iassus, Cebren, Pandonia,  
425 Colophon, Ephesus, Nicæa, Antioch,  
Syagra, Sinope, Smyrna, Myrina,

*e?'pma*}, support, prop; but in his Corrigenda he concedes that the
reading {Greek *e?'phma po'lmes*}, proposed by Gomperz, is far
preferable. Comp. Isa. i, 7.

the superstitious as a sign of the evils here specified.

418\. *Tanais*.--Ancient classic name of the Don, which empties into the
modern sea of Azof, the ancient Lake Mæotis.

424-430. These names of cities are inserted in the translation in the
order in which they stand in Rzach's text. Of course no rhythmic
arrangement is practicable.

434-450. This prophecy of the subjugation of Rome by Asia is referred
{footnote p. 73} to by Lactantius, *Div. Inst.*, vii, 15 \[L., 6,
787-790\], who declares that "the Sibyls openly say that Rome shall
perish, and that too by the judgment of God, because she held his name
in contempt, was an enemy of righteousness, and slew a people that was a
keeper of truth." Previously, in the same chapter, he says: "The Roman
name by which the world is now ruled shall be taken from the earth, and
the power will revert to Asia, and the East will again rule, and the
West will be in subjection." The "virgin" addressed in line 442, being a
"child of Latin Rome," cannot without unnatural violence be understood
of "the virgin daughter of the true God, the community of Israel, which,
while inflicting divine punishment, also contributes to the true
welfare" (Ewald, p. 19), but is rather a poetical name for Rome herself.
The "mistress," in line 446, is understood by Alexandre of the goddess
Fortune, whom Horace (*Od.*, i, 35) addresses as able "in a moment
either to lift a mortal body from the lowest place, or to turn the
noblest triumphs into funeral scenes."\]

435 Of Asia, even thrice as many goods  
Shall Asia back again from Rome receive,  
And her destructive outrage pay her back.  
As many as from Asia ever served  
A house of the Italians, twenty times  
440 As many Italians shall in Asia serve  
In poverty, and numerous debts incur.  
    O virgin, soft rich child of Latin Rome,  
Oft at thy much-remembered marriage feasts  
Drunken with wine, now shalt thou be a slave  
445 And wedded in no honorable way.  
And oft shall mistress shear thy pretty hair,  
And wreaking satisfaction cast thee down  
From heaven to earth, and from the earth again  
Raise thee to heaven, for mortals of low rank  
450 And of unrighteous life are held fast bound.  
    And of avenging Smyrna overthrown  
There shall be no thought, but by evil plans  
And wickedness of them that have command

(351-364.)

{p. 74}

Shall Samos be sand, Delos shall be dull,  
455 And Rome a room; but the decrees of God  
Shall all of them be perfectly fulfilled.  
    And a calm peace to Asian land shall go.  
And Europe shall be happy then, well fed,  
Pure air, full of years, strong, and undisturbed  
460 By wintry storms and hail, bearing, all things,  
Even birds and creeping things and beasts of earth.  
O happy upon earth shall that man be  
Or woman; what a home unspeakable  
Of happy ones! For from the starry heaven  
465 Shall all good order come upon mankind,  
And justice, and the prudent unity  
Which of all things is excellent for men,  
And kindness, confidence, and love of guests;  
But far from them shall lawlessness depart,  
470 Blame, envy, wrath, and folly; poverty  
Shall flee away from men, and force shall flee,  
And murder, baneful strifes and bitter feuds,  
And theft, and every evil in those days.  
    But Macedonia shall to Asia bear  
475 A grievous suffering, and the greatest sore  
To Europe shall spring up from Cronian stock,  
A family of bastards and of slaves.  
And she shall tame fenced city Babylon,

474-482. This passage is most naturally explained as referring to the
Macedonian rule of Alexander and his successors, who endeavored to
appear as haughty, world-ruling sons of Cronos (Saturn), but were, as a
matter of fact, of heathen origin, ignoble, and really a bastard race.
Perseus, the last of them, was truly a bastard. So Ewald, *Abhandlung*,

And of each land the sun looks down upon  
480 Call herself mistress, and then come to naught  
By ruinous misfortunes, having fame  
In later generations distant far.  
    And sometime into Asia's prosperous land  
Shall come a man unheard of, shoulder-clad  
485 With purple robe, fierce, unjust, fiery;  
And this man he who wields the thunderbolt  
Roused forwards; and all Asia shall sustain  
An evil yoke, and her soil wet with rain  
Shall drink much murder. But even so shall Hades  
490 Destroy the unknown king; and that man's offspring  
Shall forthwith perish by the race of those  
Whose offspring he himself would fain destroy;  
Producing one root which the bane of men  
Shall cut from ten horns, and plant by their side  
495 Another plant. A father purple-clad  
Shall cut a warlike father off, and Ares,  
Baneful and hostile, by a grandson's hand  
Shall himself perish; and then shall the horn  
Planted beside them forthwith bear the rule.  
500    And unto life-sustaining Phrygia  
Straightway shall there a certain token be,  
When Rhea's blood-stained race, in the great earth

\[483-489. This passage seems best to describe Antiochus Epiphanes, but
Alexandre understands it of Hadrian. The "thunderbolt," in line 486
(Greek {Greek *kerauno's*}), is thought by Ewald (p. 13) to be a
manifest allusion to Seleucus Ceraunus, one of the predecessors of
Antiochus Epiphanes, but the epithet seems more properly to denote the
god of the thunder.

493-499. Here, too, the exact references are uncertain, but the imagery
of being cut from ten horns is manifestly from Daniel (vii, 7, 8,
20,24), and favors the opinion that the writer had in mind one of the
Syrian kings. We must not suppose, however, that these Sibylline authors
were always accurate in their knowledge or exact in their
descriptions.\]

Blooming perennial in impervious roots,  
Shall, root and branch, in one night disappear  
505 With a city, men and all, of the Earth-shaker  
Poseidon; which place they shall sometime call  
Dorylæum, of dark ancient Phrygia,  
Much-bewailed. Therefore shall that time be called  
Earth-shaker; dens of earth shall he break up  
510 And walls demolish. And not signs of good  
But a beginning of evil shall be made;  
The baneful violence of general war  
Ye'll have, sons of Æneas, Dative blood  
Of Ilus from the soil. But afterwards  
515 A spoil shalt thou become for greedy men.  
    O Ilium, I pity thee; for there shall bloom  
In Sparta an Erinys very fair,  
Ever-famed, noblest scion, and shall leave  
On Asia and Europe a wide-spreading wave;  
520 But to thee most of all she'll bear and cause  
Wailings and toils and groans; but there shall be  
Undying fame with those who are to come.  
    And there shall be an aged mortal then,  
False writer and of doubtful native land;  
525 And in his eyes the light shall fade away;  
Large mind and verses measured with great skill  
Shall he have and be blended with two names,

\[507. *Dorylæum*.--Situated on the river Thymbris, in Phrygia, and
noted for its hot baths. The entire region round about has suffered
fearfully from earthquakes. That time, according to the poet, would be
so noted for earthquakes as to take the title of the Earth-shaker
himself.

517\. *An Erinys*.--Here referring to Helen, wife of Menelaus of Sparta,
who was the occasion of the Trojan war, and is called by Vergil (*Æn*.,
ii, 573) "the common Erinys of Troy and native land." Comp. book xi,
166.

523\. *Aged mortal*.--Reference to the blind Homer.

627\. *Two names*.--Besides his common name, Homer is also called "a
{footnote p. 77} Chian" because the island Chios was said to be his
birthplace. Possibly the reference is to Melesigenes and Mæonides, two
names often applied to Homer.\]

Shall call himself a Chian and shall write  
Of Ilium, not truthfully, indeed,  
530 But skillfully; for of my verse and meters  
He will be master; for he first my books  
Will open with his hands; but he himself  
Will much embellish helmed chiefs of war,  
Hector of Priam and Achilles, son  
535 Of Peleus, and the others who have care  
For warlike deeds. And also by their side  
Will he make gods stand, empty-headed men,  
False-writing every way. And it shall be  
Glory the rather, widely spread, for them  
540 To die at Ilium; but he himself  
Shall also works of recompense receive.  
    Also to Lycia shall a Locrian race  
Cause many evils. And thee, Chalcedon,  
Holding by lot a strait of narrow sea,  
545 Shall an Ætolian youth sometime despoil.  
Cyzicus, also thy vast wealth the sea  
Shall break off. And, Byzantium of Ares,  
Thou some time shalt by Asia be laid waste,  
And also groans and blood immeasurable  
550 Shalt thou receive. And Cragus, lofty mount  
Of Lycia, from thy peaks by yawning chasms  
Of opened rock shall babbling water flow,  
Until even Patara's oracles shall cease.

Shall crash the crested billow. And thou, Rhodes,  
Daughter of day, shalt long be unenslaved,  
And great shall be thy happiness hereafter,  
And on the sea thy power shall be supreme.  
560 But afterwards a spoil shalt thou become  
For greedy men, and put upon thy neck  
By beauty and by wealth a fearful yoke.  
A Lydian earthquake shall again despoil  
The power of Persia, and most horribly  
565 Shall the people of Europe and Asia suffer pain.  
And Sidon's hurtful king with battle-din  
Dreadful shall work a mournful overthrow  
To the seafaring Samians. On the soil  
Shall slain men's dark blood babble to the sea;  
570 And wives together with the noble brides  
Shall their outrageous insolence lament,  
Some for their bridegrooms, some for fallen sons.

Thy phalanxes away, and many souls  
575 With one accord shall Hades bold in charge.

Well made, and very precious wealth of men  
Shall be dissolved by earthquake; and the land  
Shall burst out with hot water; and the earth

where now, as of old, it is said there is scarcely a day of the whole
year in which the sun is not visible. Not mingling in the quarrels of
Alexander's successors, Rhodes enjoyed a considerable period of peace
and prosperity, and carried an extensive commerce with Egypt. Its
subsequent enslavement and downfall were mainly due to the fact that it
was such a tempting spoil for greedy conquerors.

Rzach in his *Corrigenda*. The common reading of MSS. is, *wealth of
heavy-hearted men*.\]

A spoiler, then, Laodicea, thou,  
Beautiful city of the Carians  
By Lycus's wondrous water, falling prone,

And they shall see their goods and all their wealth  
Enrich the enemy; and there shall be  
A trembling of the knees. And there shall fly  
675 A hundred, and one shall destroy them all;  
And five shall rout a mighty company;  
But they, among themselves mixed shamefully,  
Shall by war and dire tumult bring delight  
To enemies, but sorrow to the Greeks.  
680    And then upon all Hellas there shall be  
A servile yoke; and war and pestilence  
Together shall upon all mortals come.  
And God will make the mighty heaven on high  
Like brass and over all the earth a drought,

Shall mortals all lament the barrenness  
And lack of cultivation; and on earth  
Shall he set, who created heaven and earth,  
A much-distressing fire; and of all men  
690 The third part only shall thereafter be.  
    O Greece, why hast thou trusted mortal men  
As leaders, who cannot escape from death?  
And wherefore bringest thou thy foolish gifts  
Unto the dead and sacrifice to idols?  
695 Who put the error in thy heart to do  
These things and leave the face of God the mighty?  
Honor the All-Father's name, and let it not  
Escape thee. It is now a thousand years,  
Yea, and five hundred more, since haughty kings  
700 Ruled o'er the Greeks, who first to mortal men  
Introduced evils, setting up for worship  
Images many of gods that are dead,  
Because of which ye were taught foolish thoughts.  
But when the anger of the mighty God  
705 Shall come upon you, then ye'll recognize  
The face of God the mighty. And all souls  
Of men, with mighty groaning lifting up  
Their hands to the broad heaven, shall begin  
To call the great King helper, and to seek  
710 The rescuer from great wrath who is to be.

    But come and learn this and store in your hearts,  
What troubles in the rolling years shall come.  
And what as whole burnt-offering Hellas brought  
Of cows and bellowing bulls unto the temple  
715 Of the great God, she from ill-sounding war  
And fear and pestilence shall flee away  
And from the servile yoke escape again.  
But until that time there shall be a race  
Of godless men, even when that fated day  
720 Shall reach its end. For offering to God  
Ye should not make till all things come to pass,  
Which God alone shall purpose not in vain  
To be all fulfilled; and strong force shall urge.  
    And there shall be again a holy race  
725 Of godly men who, keeping to the counsels  
And mind of the Most High, shall honor much  
The great God's temple with drink-offerings,  
Burnt-offerings, and holy hecatombs,  
With sacrifices of fat bulls, choice rams,  
730 Firstlings of sheep and the fat thighs of lambs,  
Sacredly offering whole burnt-offerings  
On the great altar. And in righteousness,  
Having obtained the law of the Most High,  
Blest shall they dwell in cities and rich fields.  
735 And prophets shall be set on high for them  
By the Immortal, bringing great delight  
Unto all mortals. For to them alone  
The mighty God his gracious counsel gave  
And faith and noblest thought within their hearts;  
740 They have not by vain things been led astray,

Made of gold, brass, silver, and ivory,  
Nor statues of dead gods of wood and stone

745 And all that empty-minded mortals will;  
But they lift up their pure arms unto heaven,  
Rise from the couch at daybreak, always hands  
With water cleanse, and honor only Him  
Who is immortal and who ever rules,  
750 And then their parents; and above all men  
Do they respect the lawful marriage-bed;  
And they have not base intercourse with boys,  
As do Phœnicians, Latins, and Egyptians  
And spacious Greece, and nations many more  
755 Of Persians and Galatians and all Asia,  
Transgressing the immortal God's pure law  
Which they were under. Therefore on all men  
Will the Immortal put bane, famine, pains,  
Groans, war, and pestilence and mournful woes;  
760 Because they would not honor piously  
The immortal Sire of all men, but revered  
And worshiped idols made with hands, which things  
Mortals themselves will cast down and for shame  
Conceal in clefts of rocks, when a young king,

775 And then shall they before, the mighty God,

\[830. Here assuredly a new paragraph ought to begin, though Rzach's
text allows none. After the prophecy of the restoration of the temple
the writer turns (lines 830-836) to the wars of the post-exile period,
and the despoiling of the temple by Antiochus Epiphanes. With such
attempts to destroy the holy people he conceives, after the manner of
Daniel's prophecy (Dan. xl, 40-45), that the sudden judgment of heaven
intercepts the daring and impious transgressor. Hence the sublime
apocalyptic passage, lines 837-871, follows in the regular order of
prophetic thought.\]

And well-built walls of evil-minded men  
Shall all fall to the earth, since they knew not  
The law nor judgment of the mighty God,  
But with a senseless soul all hurried on  
860 Against the temple and raised up their spears.  
And God shall judge all by war and by sword  
And by fire and by overwhelming storm;  
And brimstone there shall be from heaven, and stones  
And great and grievous hail; and death shall come  
865 Upon the quadrupeds. And then shall they  
Know God, the Immortal, who performs these things;  
And wailing, and upon the boundless earth  
Shall be at once a shout of perishing men;  
And all the unholy shall be bathed in blood;  
870 And earth herself shall also drink the blood  
Of the perishing, and beasts be gorged with flesh.  
    And all these things the great eternal God  
Himself bade me proclaim. And that shall not  
Be unaccomplished, or be unfulfilled,  
875 Whatever only in my heart he put;  
For truthful is God's spirit in the world.  
    But children of the mighty God shall all  
Again around the temple live in peace,  
Rejoicing in those things which he shall give  
880 Who is Creator, righteous Judge and King.  
For he himself, great, present far and wide,  
Shall be a shelter, as on all sides round  
A wall of flaming fire. And they shall be  
In cities and in country without war.  
885 For not the hand of evil war, but rather  
The Immortal shall himself be their defender

\[And in those days shall earth, all-mother, reel.\]

To mortals best fruit boundless, wheat, wine, oil;  
930 Also from heaven a delightful drink

\[915. *Send now against this city*.--Several critics have proposed to
read, "Send *not*," and understand the passage as an exhortation to the
Greeks of Egypt not to send to Jerusalem an army of Alexandrine Jews,
who might be excited by bad counsel to mix up with the Palestinian wars
so constantly raging between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies. Such
ill-advised action would be "moving Camarina," or provoking a fierce
leopard in his lair. Another view is that the oracle dates about the
beginning of the rise of the Maccabees, and is an exhortation to the
Ptolemies to send to Jerusalem Jewish forces, numerous in Alexandria, to
help their brethren in the Holy Land. But all the attempts to make the
passage fit particular persons and events involve so much of fancy and
conjecture that one may well hesitate to adopt any of them.

918\. *Camarina*.--The allusion is to the well-known story of draining
the marsh of Camarina, a city of southern Sicily. The inhabitants,
disregarding the oracle, drained the neighboring marsh, which was
believed to breed pestilence, and by so doing they opened a way for
their enemies to come and destroy their city. Hence the proverb, "Move
not Camarina," was equivalent to: Do not seek to remove one evil in a
way that is likely to bring on another and greater one. Comp. Vergil,
*Æn.*, iii, 701.\]
