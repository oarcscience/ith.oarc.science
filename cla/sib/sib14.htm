<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O MEN, why do ye vainly think on things<BR>
Too lofty, as if ye immortal were?<BR>
And ye are ruling but a little time,<BR>
And over mortals all desire to reign,<BR>
5 Not understanding that God himself hates<BR>
The lust of rule, and most of all things hates<BR>
Insatiate kings fearful in wickedness,<BR>
And over them he stirs up what is dark;<BR>
Wherefore, instead of good works and just thoughts,<BR>
10 Ye all choose for your garments purple robes,<BR>
Desiring wretched fights and homicides<BR>
Them God imperishable who dwells in heaven<BR>
Shall make short-lived, destroy them utterly,<BR>
And overthrow one here, another there.<BR>
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when there shall a bull-destroyer come</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This book is the most obscure and inexplicable of the entire collection. Its date and authorship are quite uncertain. After the opening lines against the lust of power (1-14) there appears to be an allusion to the closing part of the preceding book; but the writer goes on to designate a long succession of emperors and conquerors, giving the initial letter of most of the names, as in previous books, and otherwise describing them, yet so inconsistently with what we know of history as to leave it impossible to identify with any certainty the individuals and events intended. Ewald has attempted to identify most of these names with known characters of Roman and Byzantine history (<I>Abhandlung</I>, pp. 99-111), but the results of his study have commanded no following, In the following notes we insert for the benefit of the reader his more plausible conjectures, but with no conviction that they represent the persons intended by the author.</P>
<P>15. <I>Bull-destroyer</I>.--That is, the lion mentioned in book xiii, 221, symbolizing Odenatus.]</P>

<P>Trusting in his own might, thick-haired and grim,<BR>
And shall destroy all, he shall also tear<BR>
Shepherds in pieces, and no victory<BR>
Shall be theirs unless soon, with speed of feet<BR>
20 Pursuing eagerly through wooded glens,<BR>
Young dogs shall meet in conflict; for a dog<BR>
Pursued the lion which destroys the shepherds.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there shall be a lord confident<BR>
In his might, and named with four syllables,<BR>
25 And shown forth clearly from the number one;<BR>
But him shall brazen Ares quickly slay<BR>
Because of conflict with insatiate men.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shall two other princely men bear rule,<BR>
Both of the number forty; and with them<BR>
30 Shall great peace be in the world and to all<BR>
The people law and right; but them in turn<BR>
Shall men with gleaming helmet, needing gold<BR>
And silver, impiously put to death<BR>
For these things, catching them by their deft plans.<BR>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again a dreadful lord shall rule,<BR>
Young, fighting hand to hand, whose name shall show<BR>
The number seventy, life-destroying, fierce,<BR>
Who to the army basely shall betray<BR>
The people of Rome, slain by wickedness<BR>
40 Because of wrath of kings, and he shall hurl</P>

<P>Down every city and hut of the Latins.<BR>
And Rome is no more to be seen or heard,<BR>
Such as of late another traveler saw;<BR>
For all these things shall in the ashes lie,<BR>
45 Nor shall there be a sparing of her works;<BR>
For hurtful he himself shall come from heaven,<BR>
God the immortal from the sky shall send<BR>
Lightnings and thunderbolts upon mankind;<BR>
And some he will destroy by lightnings burned,<BR>
50 And others with his mighty thunderbolts.<BR>
And Rome's strong children and the famous Latins<BR>
Shall then the shameless dreadful ruler slay.<BR>
Around him dead the dust shall not lie light,<BR>
But he shall be a sport for dogs and birds<BR>
55 And wolves, for he a martial people spoiled.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After him, numbering forty, there shall rule<BR>
Another, famous Parthian-destroyer,<BR>
German-destroyer, putting down dread beasts<BR>
That kill men, which upon the ocean's streams<BR>
60 And the Euphrates press continuous on.<BR>
And then shall Rome again be as before.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when there comes a great wolf in thy plains,<BR>
A ruler marching onward from the West,<BR>
Then shall he under powerful Ares die<BR>
65 Being cleft asunder by the piercing brass.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o'er the very mighty Romans then<BR>
Shall there rule yet again another man<BR>
Of great heart, from. Assyria brought to light,<BR>
Of the first letter, and he shall himself<BR>

<P>And by his armies at once power display<BR>
And lay down laws; but him shall brazen Ares<BR>
Quickly destroy by treacherous armies falling.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After him three of haughty heart shall rule,<BR>
75 One having the first number, one three tens,<BR>
And the other with three hundred shall partake,<BR>
Cruel, who gold and silver in much fire<BR>
Shall melt in statues of gods made with hands,<BR>
And to the armies they, equipped for war,<BR>
80 Will, for the sake of victory, moneys give,<BR>
Dividing many costly things and goods;<BR>
And in like manner, striving eagerly<BR>
After power, they shall barm disastrously<BR>
The arrow-shooting Parthians of the deep<BR>
85 And swift Euphrates, and the hostile Medes,<BR>
And the soft-haired warlike Massaget&aelig;<BR>
And Persians also, quiver-bearing men.<BR>
But when the king shall his own fate unloose<BR>
Leaving unto his sons more fit for arms<BR>
90 The royal scepter and entreating right,<BR>
Then they, forgetful of their father's words<BR>
And having their hands all prepared for war,<BR>
Shall rush in conflict for the royal power.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then another lord, of the third number,<BR>
95 Shall rule alone, and smitten by a sword<BR>
Shall quickly see his fate. Then after him<BR>
Shall many perish at each other's hands,<BR>
Being very valiant for the royal power.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover a great-hearted one shall rule</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[74. <I>Three</I>.--Their names beginning with A, L (A = 30), and T (= 800), the reference might be to Achilleus, whom the people of Palmyra invested with the purple, and Lollian and Tetricus, who, however, belonged to the western provinces.]</P>

Of the number four, and manage all things well.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then upon Phœnicia shall come war<BR>
And conflict, when there shall come nations near<BR>
Of arrow-shooting Persians; ah, how many<BR>
105 Shall before men of barbarous speech fall down!<BR>
Sidon and Tripolis and Berytus<BR>
The loudly-boasting shall behold each other<BR>
Amid the blood and bodies of the dead.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wretched Laodicea, round thyself<BR>
110 Thou shalt a great and unsuccessful war<BR>
Stir up through the impiety of men,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, hapless Tyrians, ye shall gather in<BR>
An evil harvest; when in the day-time<BR>
The sun that lighteth mortals shall withdraw,<BR>
115 And his disk not appear, and drops of blood<BR>
Thick and abundant shall flow down from heaven<BR>
Upon the earth. And then the king shall die,<BR>
Betrayed by his companions. After him<BR>
Shall many shameless leaders still promote<BR>
120 The wicked strife and one another kill.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then shall there a reverend ruler be,<BR>
Of much skill, with a name that numbers five,<BR>
Confiding in great armies, whom mankind<BR>
Will fondly love because of royal power;<BR>
125 And having the good name he shall thereto<BR>
Add by good deeds. But while he reigns there shall<BR>
'Twixt Taurus and snow-clad Amanus be<BR>

And in Propontis and in Phrygia<BR>
Shall there be many earthquakes. And the king<BR>
Of great renown shall under his own lot<BR>
By wasting deadly sickness lose his life.<BR>
135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after him shall rule two lordly kings,<BR>
One numbering three hundred, and one three;<BR>
And many shall he utterly destroy<BR>
In defense of the seven-hill city Rome,<BR>
And for the sake of powerful sovereignty.<BR>
140 And then shall evil to the senate come,<BR>
Nor shall it from the angry king escape<BR>
While he holds wrath against it. And a sign<BR>
Shall then appear to all men upon earth;<BR>
And fuller shall the rains be, snow and hail<BR>
145 Shall ruin field-fruits o'er the boundless earth.<BR>
But they shall fall in wars, slain by strong Ares<BR>
In behalf of the war for the Italians.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again another king shall rule,<BR>
Full of devices, gathering all the army,<BR>
150 And for the sake of war distributing<BR>
Money to those with brazen breastplate clad;<BR>
But thereupon shall Nilus, rich in corn,<BR>
Beyond the Libyan mainland irrigate<BR>
For two years the dark soil and fruitful land<BR>
155 Of Egypt; but all things shall famine seize<BR>
And war and robbers, murders, homicides.<BR>
And many cities shall by warlike men<BR>
Be thrown down headlong by the army's hands;<BR>
And he, betrayed, shall fall by gleaming iron.</P>

Shall rule the Romans, very mighty men;<BR>
He shall stretch forth a life-destroying spear<BR>
Against the Armenians and the Parthians,<BR>
The Assyrians and the Persians firm in war.<BR>
165 And then anew shall a creation be<BR>
Of splendidly built Rome with gold and amber<BR>
And silver and ivory in order raised;<BR>
And in her many people shall abide<BR>
From all the East and from the prosperous West;<BR>
170 And the king shall make other laws for her;<BR>
But then shall death destructive and strong fate<BR>
In turn receive him in a boundless isle.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there shall rule another, of ten triads,<BR>
A man like a wild beast, fair-haired and grim,<BR>
175 Who shall be a descendant of the Greeks.<BR>
And then a city of Molossian Phthia<BR>
Feeding much, and Larissa shall be bent<BR>
Down on Peneus's overhanging brows;<BR>
And then too in horse-feeding Scythia<BR>
180 Shall be an insurrection. And dire war<BR>
Shall be hard by the waters of the lake<BR>
M&aelig;otis at streams by the utmost mouth<BR>
Of the fount of watery Phasis on the mead<BR>
Of asphodel; and there shall many fall<BR>

Shall die in his own lot unloosing life.<BR>

190 Shall rule thereafter, openly made known<BR>
A dreadful man, whom all Armenians,<BR>
Who drink the best ice of the flowing stream<BR>
Araxes, and the Persians of great soul<BR>
Shall fear in wars. And between Colchians<BR>
195 And very strong Pelasgi there shall be<BR>
Wars, fights, and homicides. And those who hold<BR>
The cities of the land of Phrygia<BR>
And those of the Propontis, and make bare<BR>
From out their scabbards the two-edged swords,<BR>
200 Shall smite each other through sore impiousness.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then shall God to mortal men display<BR>
From heaven a great sign with the rolling years,<BR>
A bat, the portent of bad war to come.<BR>
And then the king shall not escape stern fate,<BR>
205 But die by hand, slain by the gleaming iron.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After him, numbering fifty, there shall rule<BR>
Again another coming out of Asia,<BR>
A dreadful terror, fighting hand to hand;<BR>
And he shall set war on Rome's stately walls,<BR>
210 And among Colchians, and Heniochi,<BR>
And the milk-drinking Agathyrsians<BR>
By Euxine sea, at Thracia's sandy bay.<BR>

Great hearted Parthians and Medes and Germans,<BR>
220 And Agathyrsians of the Bosporus,<BR>
Iernians, Britons, and Iberians<BR>
That bear the quiver, bent Massaget&aelig;,<BR>

To Scythia and windy Caucasas.<BR>
And there shall be a dread sign while he rules:<BR>
Crowns altogether like the shining stars<BR>
Shall from heaven in the south and north appear.<BR>
230 And then shall he bequeath the royal power<BR>
To his son whose initial letter heads<BR>
The alphabet, when in the halls of Hades<BR>
The manly king in his own lot shall go.<BR>
But when the son of this man in the land<BR>
235 Of Rome shall rule, shown by the number one,<BR>
There shall be over all the earth great peace<BR>
Much longed for, and the Latins will love him<BR>
As king because of his own father's worth;<BR>

Each other, powerful warriors, carrying on<BR>
An evil strife, not holding kingly power,<BR>
But being tyrants. And in all the world<BR>

350 And this most quickly. And in wretched plight<BR>
The city shall be those days, and straightway<BR>
Shall it again be prosperous not a little;<BR>
And rest shall be when that rule is destroyed.<BR>
And then the last race of the Latin kings<BR>
355 Shall be, and after it again shall grow<BR>
Dominion, children and the children's race<BR>
Shall be unshaken; for it shall be known,<BR>
Since of a surety God himself is king.<BR>

Training up youth and sending off for men,<BR>

370 A powerful helper of all Italy<BR>

He shall despoil Phœnicians in their homes,<BR>

Who is without a child; for he who once<BR>

Revolving earlier plans, shall place their neck<BR>
Under a servile yoke; such slavery,<BR>

400 Ill-fated shall come, carrying dismay,<BR>
When a barbarian nation shall again<BR>
Come suddenly; and the fruit, when it grows,<BR>

Of the flesh-eating lion and there comes<BR>
Upon the body a murderous lioness,<BR>
410 Down from his head will be the scepter cast<BR>
Away from him. And as in friendly feast<BR>
In Egypt when the people all partake,<BR>
They perform valiant deeds, and one restrains<BR>
Another, and among them there is much<BR>
415 Shouting aloud; so also shall there be<BR>
Upon mankind the fear of furious strife,<BR>
And many shall be utterly destroyed<BR>
And others kill each other by hard fights.</P>

Shall not be theirs. Ah, wretched ones, there shall<BR>

And it shall be a spoil of war not long.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then men having common boundaries<BR>
435 Of much land shall flee wretched, and shall lead<BR>
Their wretched parents. And they shall again<BR>
Having great victory light on a land,<BR>
And shall destroy the Jews, men staunch in war,<BR>
Wasting by wars far as the hoary deep,<BR>
440 On both sides, fighting in the foremost ranks<BR>
For father-land and parents. And a race<BR>
Of trophy-bearing men shall for the dead<BR>
Be reckoned. Ah, how many men shall swim<BR>
About the waves! For on the sandy beach<BR>
445 Many shall lie; and heads of golden hair<BR>
Shall fall beneath Egyptian winged fowls.<BR>
And then for the Arabians mortal blood</P>

Pledge in a sea-girt island solemn oaths,<BR>
450 Then shall there be the raising of a tower,<BR>
And the city that suffered very many things<BR>
Men shall inhabit. For deceitful gold<BR>
Shall no more be nor silver, nor acquiring<BR>

455 But one fast friendship and one mode of life<BR>
With cheerful soul; and all things shall be common<BR>

And wickedness shall sink down from the earth<BR>

460 Is come the harvest-time of mortal men.<BR>
There is imposed a strong necessity<BR>
That these things be fulfilled. And at that time<BR>
There shall not any other traveler say,<BR>

465 Though perishable shall ever cease to be.<BR>
