<P>GOD'S declarations of great wrath to come<BR>
In the last age upon the faithless world<BR>
I make known, prophesying to all men<BR>
According to their cities. From the time<BR>
5 When the great tower fell and the tongues of men<BR>
Were parted into many languages<BR>
Of mortals, first was Egypt's royal power<BR>
Established, that of Persians and of Medes<BR>
And also of the Ethiopians<BR>
10 And of Assyria and Babylon,<BR>
Then the great pride of boasting Macedon,<BR>
Then, fifth, the famous lawless kingdom last<BR>
Of the Italians shall show many evils<BR>
Unto all mortals and shall spend the toils<BR>
15 Of men of every land. And it shall lead<BR>
The untamed kings of nations to the West,<BR>
Make laws for peoples and subject all things.<BR>
Late do the mills of God grind the fine flour.<BR>
Fire then shall destroy all things and give back<BR>
20 To fine dust the heads of the high-leafed hills</P>

<P>And of all flesh. First cause of ills to all<BR>
Are covetousness and a lack of sense.<BR>
For there shall be love of deceitful gold<BR>
And silver; for than these did mortals choose<BR>
15 Naught greater, neither light of sun nor heaven,<BR>
Nor sea, nor broad-backed earth whence all things grow,<BR>
Nor God who giveth all things, of all things<BR>
The Father, nor yet faith and piety<BR>
Chose they before them. Of impiety<BR>
30 A fount, and of disorder forward guide,<BR>
An instrument of wars and foe of peace<BR>
Is lack of sense, that sets at enmity<BR>
Parents and children. And along with gold<BR>
Shall marriage not be honorable at all.<BR>
35 And the land shall have its borders and each sea<BR>
Its watchers craftily distributed<BR>
To all those that have gold; for ages thus<BR>
Shall those who purpose to possess the land<BR>
That feedeth many plunder laboring men,<BR>
40 In order that, procuring larger space,<BR>
They may enslave them by a false pretense.<BR>
And if the huge earth from the starry heaven<BR>
Held not her throne far off there had not been<BR>
For men an equal light, but, bought with gold,<BR>
45 It had belonged to rich men and God must<BR>
For poor men have prepared another world.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall come to thee sometime from above<BR>
A heavenly stroke deserved, O haughty Rome.<BR>
And thou shalt be the first to bend thy neck<BR>
50 And be rased to the ground, and thee shall fire<BR>
Destructive utterly consume, cast down<BR>
Upon thy pavements, and thy wealth shall perish,</P>

<P>And wolves and foxes dwell in thy foundations.<BR>
And then shalt thou be wholly desolate,<BR>
55 As if not born. Where thy Palladium then?<BR>
What god shall save thee, whether wrought of gold<BR>
Or stone or brass? Or then where thy decrees<BR>
Of senate? Where shall be the race of Rhea,<BR>
Of Cronus, or of Zeus, and of all those<BR>
60 Whom thou didst worship, demons without life,<BR>
Images of the worn-out dead, whose tombs<BR>
Crete the ill-starred shall hold a cause of pride,<BR>
And honor the unconscious dead with thrones?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when thou shalt have had voluptuous kings<BR>
65 Thrice five, enslaving the world from the east<BR>
Unto the west, there shall be then a lord<BR>
Gray-headed, having name of the near sea,<BR>
The world inspecting with a nimble foot,<BR>
Bringing gifts, having large amount of gold<BR>
70 And plundering hateful silver even more,<BR>
And stripping it off he shall pick it up.<BR>
And he shall have part in all mysteries<BR>
Of Magian shrines, display his child as god,<BR>
Abolish all things sacred, and disclose<BR>
75 The ancient mysteries of deceit to all.<BR>
Sad then the time when he himself, sad one,<BR>
Shall perish. And yet shall the people say:<BR>
"Thy mighty strength, O city, shall fall down,"<BR>
At once perceiving that the evil day</P>

Alas, alas for thee, thou reckless land,<BR>
Great barbarous nation; thou didst not perceive<BR>

To the sun's light, that to that place again<BR>

With hands gigantic coming from on high<BR>
Alone through all the world thou, shalt abide<BR>
Under the earth. By naphtha and asphalt<BR>

Ye are ready, that unto the bitter day<BR>
165 Ye may come to see your first punishment,<BR>
O Rome, and gnashing of teeth. And no more<BR>

Of God most mighty, shall his children rule,<BR>

When there shall be of Egypt thrice five kings.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter when the limit of the time<BR>
Of the Phenix shall come round, there shall a race<BR>
185 Of peoples come to plunder, tribes confused,<BR>
Enemy of the Hebrews. Then shall Ares<BR>
Go plundering Ares; and he shall himself<BR>
Destroy the haughty threatening of the Romans.<BR>

<P>284-330. This passage is celebrated as being an acrostic of thirty-four lines in the Greek text, the first letters of which lines form the title given above, namely, JESUS CHRIST, SON OF GOD, SAVIOUR, CROSS. It is quoted in full by Eusebius in his report of Constantine's Oration to the Assembly of the Saints, xviii [G., 20, 1288, 1289], and, excepting the seven lines representing the word CROSS, by Augustine, <I>de Civitate Dei</I>, xviii, 123 [L., 41, 5791. We give in our text a faithful translation of the Greek without any {footnote p. 172} attempt to transfer it into a corresponding English acrostic, but in the Appendix of this volume (pp. 274-277) the reader may find several English translations which aim to reproduce the acrostic form of the original. To the picture of the day of judgment as given in this acrostic there is obvious allusion at the beginning of the famous medieval hymn:</P><DIR>
