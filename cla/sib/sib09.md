### BOOK VII.

    O RHODES, thou art unhappy; for first thee,  
Thee will I mourn; and thou shalt be the first  
Of cities, and first shalt thou be destroyed,  
Bereft of men, but of the means of life  
5 Not wholly destitute. And thou shalt sail,  
Delos, and be unstable on the water;  
Cyprus, a billow of thy gleaming sea  
Shall sometime thee destroy; thee, Sicily,  
The fire that burns within thee shall consume.  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
10 Nor heed God's terrible and foreign water.  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
Noah sole fugitive from all men came.  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
Earth shall float, hills float, and even sky shall float,  
Everything shall be water and all things  
Shall be destroyed by waters. And the winds  
15 Shall stand still and a second age shall be.  
    O Phrygia, first shalt thou flame from the crest  
Of the water; and first in impiety  
Thou shalt deny God himself, courting favor  
With false gods, which shall utterly destroy  
20 Thee, wretched one, while many years roll round.

\[1. This book is brief and fragmentary, and mainly of Christian origin.
Its composition may be properly assigned to the close of the second or
the early part of the third century.

10-15. Here we have the fragment of a passage referring to Noah and the
flood, in which the language is appropriated from book i, 226-240.\]

(1-15.)

{p. 150}

The hapless Ethiopians under pain,  
Suffering things lamentable, shall by swords  
Be smitten whilst they crouch upon the ground.  
    Rich Egypt ever caring for her corn,  
25 Which Nilus by his seven swimming streams  
Intoxicates, shall in intestine strife  
Destroy; and thence men unexpectedly  
Shall drive out Apis, not the god for men.  
    Alas, alas, Laodicea! thou  
30 Not ever seeing God shalt lie, bold one;  
And over thee shall dash a wave of Lycus.  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
He himself who is born the mighty God,  
Who shall work many signs, shall through heaven hang  
An axle in the midst, and place for men  
35 A mighty terror to be seen on high,  
Measuring a column with a mighty fire  
Whose drops shall slay the races of mankind  
That have dared evils. But a common Lord  
There shall at some time be, and then shall men  
40 Propitiate God, but shall not make an end  
Of fruitless sorrows. And through David's house  
Shall all things come to pass. For God himself  
Gave him the power and put it in his hand;  
Under his feet shall sleep his messengers,  
45 And some shall kindle fires, and some shall make  
Rivers appear, and some shall rescue towns,

\[28. *Apis*.--The sacred bull, worshiped by the Egyptians.

29\. *Laodicea*.--Comp. book iii, 592-595.

34-36. *Axle . . . column*.--This idea of a column, axle, or pillar, to
be reared on high in connection with the final judgment, is peculiar to
the Sibyl. Comp. book ii, 297, 361, and 362.

38\. *A common Lord*.--The Messiah, common in the same sense that Jude
(epistle, verse 3) speaks of the "common salvation."\]

(16-36.)

{p. 151}

And some shall send forth winds. But furthermore  
A grievous life shall come on many men,  
Entering their souls and changing human hearts.  
50 But when a new shoot shall out of a root  
Put forth eyes, the creation, which to all  
Once gave abundant food . . .  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
And it shall with the times be full. But when  
Others shall rule, a tribe of warlike Persians,  
55 Bride-chambers straightway shall be terrible  
Because of lawless deeds. For her own son  
Will mother have as husband; son will be  
The ruin of his mother; and with sire  
Shall daughter lie down and shall put to sleep  
60 This foreign law. But to them afterwards  
Shall Roman Ares flash from many a spear;  
And they shall mix much land with human blood.  
But then a chief of Italy shall flee  
From the force of the spear. But they shall leave  
65 Upon the land a lance inscribed with gold,  
Which as the signal ensign of their rule  
The foremost fighters carry constantly.  
    And it shall be, when evil and ill-starred  
Ilias shall piteously complete for all  
70 A tomb, not marriage, then shall brides weep sore,

\[62. The Greek text is at this point so broken as to leave the entire
passage obscure.

54\. *Warlike Persians*.--Ewald understands this term as a symbolical
name for the incestuous Romans; but it is more probably a designation of
the Parthians who in their wars with Crassus and Antony captured many of
the Roman standards.

69\. *Ilias*.--Here apparently put for all the region round about
ancient Ilium, or Troy, or perhaps for Perganum in the neighboring
province.\]

(35-52.)

{p. 152}

Because they knew not God, but always gave  
By kettle-drums and cymbals boisterous sound.  
    Consult the oracle, O Colophon;  
For a great fearful fire hangs over thee.  
75    Ill-wedded Thessaly, the earth no more  
Shall see thee, nor thy ashes, and alone  
Escaping from the mainland thou shalt swim;  
Thus, O thou wretched one, shalt thou of war  
Be melancholy refuse, having fallen  
80 By swiftly flowing rivers and by swords.  
    And thou, O wretched Corinth, shalt receive  
Around thyself stern Ares, hapless one,  
And ye shall perish one upon another.  
    Tyre, thou, unhappy, shalt be left alone;  
85 For, made a widow by the feebleness  
Of pious men, thou shalt be brought to naught.  
    Ah, Cœle-Syria, of Phœnician men  
The last hold, upon whom the briny sea  
Of Berytus disgorging is poured forth,  
90 O wretched one, thou didst not know thy God,  
Who once in the mouth of Jordan washed himself,  
--And the Spirit spread his wings in flight towards him--  
Who before both the earth and starry heaven  
Was, actual Word, begotten by his Father,  
95 And by the Holy Spirit donning flesh

of an ancient oracle of Apollo (Strabo xiv, i, 27).

{p. 153}

He quickly flew unto his Father's house.  
And for him three towers did the mighty heaven  
Establish, in which dwell God's noble guides,  
Hope, piety, and reverence much-desired,  
100 Not having in gold or in silver joy,  
But in the reverential acts of men--  
Both sacrifices and most righteous thoughts.  
    And thou shalt sacrifice to the immortal  
And mighty God august, not melting grains  
105 Of frankincense in fire, nor with the sword  
Slaying the shaggy-haired lamb, but with all  
Who bear thy blood take wild fowls, offer prayer,  
And fixing eyes on heaven send them away;  
And thou shalt sprinkle water on pure fire  
110 Having cried: "As the Father did beget  
Thee, the Word, Father, I sent forth a bird,  
Swift messenger of words, with holy waters  
Besprinkling thy baptism, O Word, through which  
Thou didst make thyself manifest in fire."  
115    Thou shalt not shut thy door, when there shall come  
A stranger unto thee in need to curb  
His hunger which comes from his poverty,  
But taking hold of that man sprinkle him  
With water and pray thrice; and to thy God  
120 Do thou thus cry: "I do not long for wealth;

a revelation of the Church. *Hermæ Pastor*, book 1, vision iii \[G., 2,

103-130. This passage contains a series of precepts which are strictly
neither Jewish nor Christian. Some of the precepts suggest certain
doctrines of the Essenes (comp. Josephus, *Ant.*, xviii, i, 5); others
bear a manifest Christian character, and lines 110-114 contain allusions
to the baptism of Jesus, as lines 91 and 92 above.\]

(70-89.)

{p. 154}

A suppliant I once publicly received  
A suppliant; Father, thou provider, hear."  
When thou hast prayed thou shalt give unto him;  
And the man went away thereafter. . . .  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
125 Do not afflict me, holy fear of God  
And righteous, as to birth pure, unenslaved,  
Attested. . . .  
Do thou, O Father, make my wretched heart  
Stand still; to thee have I looked, unto thee,  
130 The undefiled, whom hands did not produce.  
    Sardinia, weighty now, thou shalt be changed  
To ashes. Thou shalt be no more an isle,  
When the tenth time shall come. Amid the waves  
Shall sailors seek thee when thou art no more,  
135 And o'er thee shall kingfishers wail sad dirge.  
    Rugged Mygdonia, beacon of the sea  
Hard to get out of, ages shalt thou boast  
And unto ages shalt be all destroyed  
With a hot wind, and rave with many woes.  
140    O Celtic land, on mountain range so great,  
Beyond impassable Alp, thee deep sand  
Shall altogether bury; thou shalt give  
Tribute no more, nor corn, nor pasturage;  
And thou from peoples ever far away  
145 Shalt be all-desolate, and becoming thick  
With chill ice thou shalt for an outrage pay,  
Which thou didst not perceive, unholy one.  
    Stout-hearted Rome, thou to Olympus shalt  
Flash lightning after Macedonian spears;

136\. *Rugged Mygdonia*.--Region of Macedonia north of the Thermaic gulf
and connecting with the peninsula of Chalcidice.\]

(89-108.)

{p. 155}

150 But God shall make thee utterly unknown,  
When thou wouldst to the eye seem to remain  
Much more firm. Then to thee such things I'll cry.  
Perishing thou shalt then cry out and boil  
In pain; a second time to thee, O Rome,  
15 Again a second time I am to speak.  
    And now for thee, O wretched Syria,  
Do I wail bitterly in pitying grief.  
    O Thebans ill-advised, an evil sound  
Is over you while flutes speak out their tones;  
160 For you shall trumpet sound an evil sound  
And ye shall see the entire land destroyed  
    Alas, alas for thee, thou wretched one;  
Alas, alas thou evil-minded sea!  
Thou shalt be wholly eaten up of fire  
165 And people with thy brine shalt thou destroy.  
For there shall be such raging fire on earth  
As flows like water, and it shall destroy  
The whole land. It shall set the hills on fire,  
Shall burn the rivers, and exhaust the springs.  
170 The world shall be disordered whilst mankind  
Are perishing. And then the wretched ones,  
Burned badly, shall look unto heaven inwrought  
Not with stars, but with fire. Not speedily  
Shall they be made to perish, but dissolved  
175 From under flesh, and burning in the spirit  
For age-long years, they shall know that God's law  
Is always hard to put to test and not  
To be deceived; and then earth, seized by force,  
Daring whatever god she did admit  
180 Unto her altars, cheated, turned to smoke  
Through the changed air; and they shall undergo

(109-131.)

{p. 156}

Much suffering who for gain shall prophesy  
Shameful things, nourishing the evil time.  
And the Hebrews who put on the shaggy skins  
185 Of sheep shall prove false, in which race  
Obtained no portion by inheritance,  
But talking mere words over sorrows they  
Are misers, who shall change their course of life  
And not mislead the just, who through the heart  
190 All-faithfully propitiate their God.  
    But in the third lot of revolving years,  
Eighth the first, shall another world appear.  
Night shall be all . . . long and without light.  
And then shall pass around the dreadful stench  
195 Of brimstone, messenger of homicides,  
When they shall be by night and hunger slain.  
Then a pure mind shall God beget in men,  
And shall the race establish, as it was  
Aforetime; longer shall not any one  
200 Deep furrow cut with round plow, nor two oxen  
Straight guiding dip the iron down; nor vines  
Shall be nor ears of corn; but all shall eat  
Together dewy manna with white teeth.  
And then among them God shall also be,  
205 And he shall teach them as he has taught me,  
The sad one. For how many evil things  
I did with knowledge once, and many things  
Heedless I also wickedly performed.  
Countless my couches, but no marriage-bond

\[192. *Eighth the first*.--That is, the eighth being the first of "the
third lot." The Sibyl reckons all the years as divided into ten periods
or times (line 133 above); of these ten times the eighth is supposed to
be the first of the third portion; namely, the eighth, ninth, and tenth,
during which shall take place what is written in lines 193-205,
immediately following.\]

210 Was cared for; and I, all-unfaithful, brought  
To all a savage oath. I turned away  
Those in need and among the foremost went  
Into like glen and minded not God's word.  
Therefore did fire consume me and shall gnaw;  
215 For I shall not live always, but a time  
Of evil shall destroy me, when for me  
Men shall beside the margin of the sea  
Construct a tomb, and shall slay me with stones;  
For lying with my father a dear son  
220 Did I present him. Smite me, smite me all;  
For thus shall I live and fix eyes on heaven.

\[216. *Destroy me*.--Had Arnobius this passage in mind when he wrote:
"If the Sibyl, when she was uttering her prophecies and oracular
responses, and was filled with Apollo's power, bad been cut down and
slain by impious robbers, would Apollo have been slain in her?" *Adv.
Gentes*, book i, 62 \[L., 5, 802\]. Comp. the conclusion of book ii.\]
