### BOOK XII.

BUT come now, hear of me the mournful time  
Of sons of Latium; and first of all  
After the kings of Egypt were destroyed,  
And the like earth had downwards borne them all,  
5 And after Pella's townsman, under whom  
The whole East and the rich West were cast down,  
Whom Babylon dishonored, and stretched out  
For Philip a dead body (not of Zeus,  
Of Ammon not true things were prophesied),  
10 And after that one of the race and blood  
Of king Assaracus, who came from Troy,  
Even he who cleft the violence of fire,  
And after many lords, and after men  
To Ares dear, and after the young babes,  
15 The children of the beast that feeds on sheep,  
And after the passing of six hundred years  
And decades two of Rome's dictatorship,  
The very first lord, from the western sea,  
Shall be of Rome the ruler, very strong  
20 And warlike, the initial of whose name  
Begins the letters, and fast binding thee,  
O thou of goodly fruit, he shall be full  
Of man-destroying Ares; thou shalt pay

{p. 210}

The outrage which thou willing didst force on;  
For he, great soul, shall be the best in wars;  
25 Before him Thrace and Sicily shall crouch,  
With Memphis, Memphis cast headlong to earth  
By reason of the wickedness of rulers  
And of a woman unenslaved who falls  
Under the spear. And laws will he ordain  
30 For peoples and put all things under him;  
Having great fame he shall wield scepter long;  
For no short time shall he last nor shall ever  
Be other greater scepter-bearing king  
35 Than this one, o'er the Romans, not one hour,  
For God did lavish all things upon him,  
And also in the noble earth he showed  
Great marvelous seasons, and with them showed signs.  
    But when a radiant star all like the sun  
40 Shall shine forth out of heaven in the mid days,  
Then shall the secret Word of the Most High  
Come clothed in flesh like mortals; but with him  
The might of Rome and of the illustrious Latins  
Shall increase. But the mighty king himself  
45 Shall under his appointed lot expire,  
Transmitting to another royal power.  
But after him a man, a warrior strong,  
Wearing the purple mantle on his shoulders,  
Shall bear rule, and with his initial be  
50 Numbers three hundred, and he shall destroy  
The Medes and arrow-hurling Parthians;  
And he himself by his power shall subvert

The high-gate city; and again shall come  
Evil to Egypt and the Assyrians,  
55 And to the Colchian Heniochi,  
And to those by the waters of the Rhine,  
The Germans dwelling o'er the sandy shores.  
And he himself shall ravage afterwards  
The high-gate city near Eridanus  
60 Which is devising evils. And then he  
    Shall forthwith fall down, struck by gleaming iron.  
And afterwards shall rule another man  
Weaving guile, and the initial of his name  
Will show the number three; and he much gold  
65 Shall gather; and with him there shall not be  
Satiety of wealth, but plundering more  
Recklessly he'll put all things in the earth.  
But peace shall come, and Ares shall desist  
From wars; and he shall make known many things  
70 In divination of the greatest things,  
Inquiring for the sake of means of life;  
Yet there shall be on him the greatest sign:  
From heaven down on the king while perishing  
There shall flow many little drops of blood.  
75 And many lawless things will he perform,  
And put around the neck of Romans pain  
Trusting in divination; and the heads  
Of the assembly he will also slay.  
And famine shall seize Cappadocians,  
80 And Thracians, Macedonians, and Italians.

59\. *City*.--Cremona seems intended, but the writer has here apparently
confused Tiberius with Vespasian, who destroyed this city by fire.

64\. Three.--The letter {Greek *G*}, denoting Gaius, or Caius Cæsar,
commonly called Caligula, a monster of wickedness.\]

(41-61.)

{p. 212}

And Egypt shall alone feed numerous tribes;  
And the king himself beguiling secretly  
Shall craftily destroy the virgin maid;  
But her the citizens in tearful grief  
85 Shall bury; and against the king they all  
Holding wrath shall abuse him craftily.  
While strong Rome blossoms the strong man shall perish.  
    And again there shall rule another lord  
Of the number of twice ten; and then shall come  
90 Unto the Sauromatians and to Thrace  
And the Triballi, famed for hurling darts,  
Wars and sad cares; and Roman Ares shall  
Tear all in pieces. And a fearful sign  
Shall there be when this man shall rule the land  
95 Of the Italians and Pannonians;  
And there shall be at the mid hour of day  
Dark night around them and then from the heaven  
A shower of stones; and thereupon the lord  
And vigorous judge of the Italians  
100 Shall go in Hades' halls by his own fate.  
    Again another fearful man shall come  
And dreadful, numbering fifty; and from all  
The cities many noblest citizens  
Born to wealth he shall utterly destroy,  
105 A dreadful serpent breathing grievous war,  
Who sometime stretching forth his hands shall make  
An end of his own race and stir all things,  
Acting the athlete, driving chariots,

v, 39-49.\]

{p. 213}

Putting to death and daring countless things;  
110 And he shall cleave the mountain of two seas,  
And sprinkle it with gore. And out of sight  
Shall also vanish the destructive man;  
Then making himself equal unto God  
Shall he return, but God will prove him naught.  
115 And while he rules there shall be peace profound  
And not the fears of men; and from the ocean  
Flowing, and cleaving by Ausonia,  
Shall come untrodden water; and around  
Looking with anxious care he will appoint  
120 His very many contests for the people,  
And he himself an actor will contend  
With voice and cithara, and sing a song  
Along with harp-string; later he will flee  
And leave the royal power, and perishing  
125 Illy will he repay the harm he wrought.  
    After him three shall rule and two of them  
Shall have the number seventy by their names,  
And in addition to these shall be one  
Of the third letter; and one here, one there,  
130 Shall perish by strong Ares' sturdy hands.  
Then shall a mighty ruler of men come,  
Destroyer of the pious, strong-minded man,  
Spear-wielding Ares, whom seven times the tenth  
Shall point out clearly; he shall overthrow  
135 Phœnicia and destroy Assyria.  
A sword shall come upon the sacred land  
Of Solyma even to the utmost bend  
Of the Tiberian sea. Alas, alas,  
Phœnicia, O how much shalt thou endure,  
140 Grief-laden with thy trophies tightly bound,

\[126-131. Comp. book v, 50-53.\]

(83-106.)

{p. 214}

And every nation shall upon thee tread.  
Alas, alas, to the Assyrians  
Shalt thou come and shalt see young children serve  
Among unfriendly men and with the wives,  
145 And every means of life and wealth shall perish;  
For on thee God's wrath causing grievous woe  
Shall come, because they did not keep his law,  
But served all idols with unseemly arts.  
And many wars and fights and homicides,  
150 Famines, and pestilences, and confusion  
Of cities shall be. But the reverend king  
Of mighty soul shall at the end of life  
Himself fall by a strong necessity.  
    Then shall two other chief men, cherishing  
155 The memory of their father, great king, rule,  
And in contending warriors glory much.  
    And (one) of these shall be a noble man  
And lordly, whose name shall three hundred hold;  
Yet he shall also fall by treachery,  
160 Not in the warring companies stretched out,  
But struck in Rome's plain by the two-edged brass.  
    And after him a powerful warlike man  
Of the letter four shall rule the mighty realm,  
Whom all men on the boundless earth shall love,  
165 And then shall there be over all the world  
A rest from war. Yet all, from west to east,  
Shall serve him willingly, not by constraint,  
And cities shall be under his control  
And of themselves be subject. For to him  
170 Shall heavenly Sabaoth much glory bring,  
The imperishable God who dwells on high.

\[154. *Two other*.--Titus and Domitian, who seem to be also the ones
designated by three hundred and four in the lines immediately
following.\]

(106-132.)

{p. 215}

And then shall famine waste Pannonia  
And all the Celtic land, and shall destroy  
One here, another there. And there shall be  
175 For the Assyrians, whom Orontes laves,  
Structures and ornament and what may seem  
Yet greater anywhere. And the great king  
Shall have a fondness for these and love them  
Above the others far (and there are many);  
180 But he himself shall in mid breast receive  
A great wound, and seized at the end of life  
Craftily, by a friend, in hallowed house  
Of the great royal hall shall he fall down  
Wounded; and after him shall be a ruler  
185 Numbering fifty, venerable man,  
Who above measure shall destroy from Rome  
Many inhabitants and citizens;  
But he shall rule few; for in Hades' halls  
For a former king's sake he shall wounded go.  
190    But then another king, a warrior strong,  
Who has three hundred for initial sign,  
Shall bear rule and lay waste the Thracians' land  
Which is much varied, and he shall destroy  
The powerful Germans dwelling by the Rhine  
195 And the Iberians that shoot the arrow.  
Moreover, there shall be unto the Jews  
Another greatest evil, and with them  
Bedewed with murder shall Phœnicia drink;  
And the walls of the Assyrians shall fall  
200 By many warriors. And again a man  
Destroying life shall waste them utterly.

doubtful.

190\. *Another*.--Trajan. Comp. lines 190-210 with book v, 58-65.\]

(133-155.)

{p. 216}

And then shall threatenings of the mighty God,  
Earthquakes, and great plagues be on every land,  
Untimely snow-storms, and strong thunderbolts.  
205 And then the great king, mountain-roaming Celt,  
Shall for the toil of Ares not escape  
A fate unseemly, hastening eagerly  
After the strife of battle, but worn out  
Shall he be; foreign dust shall hide his corpse,  
210 But dust that of Nemea's flower has name.  
And after him another shall arise,  
A silver-headed man, and of the sea  
Shall be his name, and of four syllables,  
Ares himself first of the alphabet  
215 Presenting. Temples he shall dedicate  
In all the cities, watching o'er the world  
By his own foot, and bringing gifts away,  
Both gold and amber much will he supply  
For many; and magicians' mysteries  
220 All will he from the sanctuaries keep;  
And what is much more excellent for men  
Will he place . . . ruling . . . thunderbolt;  
And great peace shall be when he shall be lord;  
And he shall be a minstrel of rich voice  
225 And a participant in lawful things,  
And a just minister of what is right;  
But he shall fall, unloosing his own fate.  
    After him three shall rule, and the third late  
Shall rule, three decades keeping; yet again

impossible to complete the sentence, or even indicate the thought with
any certainty.

{p. 217}

230 Of the first unit shall another king  
Bear the rule; and another after him  
Shall be commander, of tens numbering seven;  
And their names shall be honored; and they shall  
Themselves destroy men marked by many a spot,  
235 Britons and mighty Moors and Dacians  
And the Arabians. But when the last  
Of these shall perish, fearful Ares then,  
He that before was wounded, shall again  
Against the Parthians come, and utterly  
240 Shall he destroy them. And then shall the king  
Himself fall by a treacherous wild beast  
Training his hands--excuse itself of death.  
    And after him another man shall rule,  
In many wise things skilled, and he shall have  
245 Himself the name of the first mighty king  
Of the first unit; and he shall be good  
And mighty; and for the illustrious Latins  
Shall this strong one accomplish many things  
In memory of his father; and forthwith  
250 Shall he adorn the walls of Rome with gold  
And silver and ivory; and he shall go  
Within the market places and the temples  
With a strong man. And sometime direst wound  
Shall shoot up like ears in the Roman wars;

*Ou?h\~ros*}).

235\. *Moors*.--The Mauri, or Mauritanians, on the northwestern coast of
Africa.

236-242. The statements of these lines are inexplicably obscure. Dire
war was carried on with the Parthians under command of L. Verus, but the
statements of lines 240-242 are not applicable to any of the Antonines,
either literally or metaphorically.

(178-194.)

255 And he shall sack the whole land of the Germans,  
When a great sign of God shall be displayed  
From heaven, and shall for the king's piety  
Save men in brazen armor and distress;  
For God who is in heaven and hears all things  
260 Shall wet him with unseasonable rain  
When he prays. But when these things are fulfilled  
Of which I spoke, then with the rolling years  
Shall also the renowned dominion cease  
Of the great pious king; and at the end  
265 Of his life, having then proclaimed his son  
Succeeding to the kingdom, he shall die  
By his own lot and leave the royal power  
Unto the ruler with the golden hair,  
Who with two tens in his name, born a king  
270 From the race of his father, shall receive  
Dominion. This man with superior powers  
Of mind shall grasp all things; and he shall rival  
Great-hearted overweening Hercules,  
And be the best in mighty arms and have  
275 The greatest fame in chase and horsemanship;  
But he shall live in peril all alone.  
And while this man is ruler there shall be  
A fearful sign: there shall be a great mist  
Then in the plain of Rome, so that a man

emperor and his army gained a great victory over the Quadi, and which
the  
Romans ascribed to Jupiter Tonans, who heard Aurelius's prayer, but  
which the Christians of his army affirmed was in answer to their own  
prayers.

Commodus, specially  
famous for his skill with the bow and other arms, and boasting himself

280 May not discern his neighbor. And then wars  
Shall come to pass along with mournful cares,  
When the king himself, exceeding mad with love,  
And weakly, shall come in the marriage-bed  
Shaming his youthful offspring, infamous  
285 For inconsiderate wedding-songs impure.  
And then, in helpless loneliness concealed,  
The mighty baneful man held under wrath  
Shall in a bath-room suffer evil plight,  
Man-slaying Ares bound by treacherous fate.  
290    Know then the fatal lot of Rome is near  
Because of zeal for power; and by the hands  
Of Ares many in Palladian halls  
Shall perish. And then Rome shall be bereft  
And shall repay all things, which she alone  
295 Before accomplished by her many wars.  
    My heart laments, my heart within me mourns;  
For from the time when thy first king, proud Rome,  
Gave good law to thee and to men on earth,  
And the Word of the great immortal God  
300 Came to the earth, until the nineteenth reign  
Shall have been finished Cronos shall complete  
Two hundred years, twice twenty and twice two,  
With six months added; then the twentieth king,  
When smitten with sharp brass he with the sword  
305 Shall in thy houses pour out blood, shall make  
Thy race a widow, having in his name

room.

300\. Nineteenth.--That is, the nineteenth reign reckoning from
Augustus. Comp. line 303.

assassinated A. D. 192, to which if we add the thirteen years of
Augustus before the date of our era we have only two hundred and five
years.\]

(216-237.)

{p. 220}

The letter which the number eighty shows,  
And burdened with old age; but he shall make  
A widow of thee in a little time,  
310 When many warriors, many overthrows,  
And murders, homicides, and deadly feuds  
And miseries of conquests there shall be,  
And in confusion many a horse and man  
Shall, cleft by force of hands, fall in the plain.  
315    And then another man shall rule, and have  
The sign of his name in the number ten;  
And many sorrows shall he bring to pass,  
And groans, and he shall plunder many men;  
But he himself shall be short-lived and fall  
320 By mighty Ares, struck by gleaming iron.  
    Another, numbering fifty, then shall come,  
A warrior roused up by the East for rule;  
A warlike Ares he shall come to Thrace;  
And he shall flee thereafter and shall come  
325 Into the land of the Bithynians  
And the Cilician plain; but brazen Ares  
The life-destroyer shall with speedy stroke  
Utterly spoil him in the Assyrian fields.  
    And then again there shall rule craftily  
330 A man skilled in fraud, full of various wiles,  
Roused up by the West, and his name shall have  
The number of two hundred. And again

who after the murder of Pertinax made the highest bid for the empire,
but reigned only sixty-six days.

on the death of Pertinax and was supported by the East, but being
repeatedly defeated by the troops of his rival, Severus, he fled for
Parthia, but was overtaken and slain.

Severus.\]

Another sign: he shall contrive a war  
For royal power against Assyrian men,  
335 Raise a whole army and subject all things.  
And he shall rule the Romans with his might;  
But there is much contrivance in his heart,  
Impulse of baleful Ares; serpent dire,  
And violent in war, who shall destroy  
340 All high-born men upon the earth, and slay  
The noble for their wealth, and, robber like,  
Stripping all earth while men are perishing,  
He shall go to the East; and all deceit  
Shall be to him . . .

345 Then shall a youthful Cæsar with him reign  
Having the name of a puissant lord  
Of Macedon, by the first letter known;  
Bringing in broils around him he shall flee  
The hard deception of the coming king  
350 In the bosom of the army; but the one  
Who rules by his barbaric usages,  
A temple-guard, shall perish suddenly  
Slain by strong Ares with the gleaming iron;  
Him even dead shall people tear in pieces.  
355    And then the kings of Persia shall rise up;  
And . . . Roman Ares Roman lord.

the writer of Alexander the Great of Macedon.

352\. *Temple-guard*.--Heliogabalus (or Elagabalus) seems to be here
referred to, who was in early youth trained as a priest In the Temple of
the Sun at Emesa, and who, after he was made emperor, was wont to wear
his pontifical dress and tiara as high-priest of the sun. But he came
before, not after, Alexander Severus.

355\. *Kings of Persia*.--The dynasty of the Sassanidæ, or kings of the
later Persian Empire, founded by Ardechir Babegan, commonly called
Artaxerxes.\]

And Phrygia shall with earthquakes groan again  
Wretched. Alas, alas, Laodicea;  
Alas, alas, sad Hierapolis;  
360 For you first once the yawning earth received.  
Of Rome . . . immense Aus . . .  
All things as many . . .  
Shall wail . . . while men are perishing  
In the hands of Ares; and the lot of men  
365 Shall be bad; but then by the eastern way  
Hastening to look down upon Italy,  
Stripped naked he shall fall by gleaming iron,  
Acquiring hatred for his mother's sake.  
    For seasons are of all sorts; each holds back  
370 The other . . . gleaming and this not at once all know;  
For all things shall not be (the lot) of all,  
But only those shall be for happiness  
Who honor God and shun idolatry.  
And now, Lord of the world, of every realm

Into my heart the oracle divine--  
Make thou the word cease; for I do not know  
What things I say; for thou art in me he  
That speaketh all these things. Now let me rest  
380 A little and put from my heart aside  
The charming song; for weary is my heart  
Foretelling with divine words royal power.
