<P>O THOU high-thundering blessed heavenly One,<BR>
Who hast set in their place the cherubim,<BR>
I, who have uttered what is all too true,<BR>
Entreat thee, let me have a little rest;<BR>
5 For my heart has grown weary from within.<BR>
But why again leaps my heart, and my soul<BR>
With a whip smitten from within constrained<BR>
To utter forth its message unto all?<BR>
But yet again will I proclaim all things<BR>
10 Which God commands me to proclaim to men.<BR>
O men, that in your image have a form<BR>
Fashioned of God, why do ye vainly stray</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This third book of the Oracles is the most interesting and important of the entire collection. It is by far the longest, containing in the Greek text 829 verses. It is believed to be mainly of Jewish origin. In its present form, however, it is obviously a compilation of several distinct groups of oracles, one of which, lines 117-361 (Greek text, 97-294), contains the oldest portion of the Sibylline Oracles as they now exist. Two quite extensive fragments which have been preserved by Theophilus are by him said to have stood at the beginning of the Sibyl's prophecy and probably formed an introduction to this section of our third book (see Appendix, p. 267). In place of this more ancient introduction the compiler of our collection has inserted the first 116 lines of this book, which may be again subdivided into three parts, which appear to be so many separate fragments; lines 1-75, 76-111, 112-116. In some editions the first 75 lines (Greek text, 1-62) are appended to the preceding book, and some MSS. preface this book with the words, "Again in her third tome she says these things from the second discourse concerning God." Other clearly distinguishable sections of this book are the following: lines 362-616, 616-1003, 1004-1031 (Greek text, 295-488, 489-808, 809-827). The last section purports to he a personal vindication of the Sibyl.]</P>

<P>And walk not in the straight way, always mindful<BR>
Of the immortal Maker? God is one,<BR>
15 Sovereign, ineffable, dwelling in heaven,<BR>
The self-existent and invisible,<BR>
Himself alone beholding everything;<BR>
Him sculptor's hand made not, nor is his form<BR>
Shown by man's art from gold or ivory;<BR>
20 But he, eternal Lord, proclaims himself<BR>
As one who is and was erst and shall be<BR>
Again hereafter. For who being mortal<BR>
Can see God with his eyes? Or who shall bear<BR>
To hear the only name of heaven's great God,<BR>
25 The ruler of the world? He by his word<BR>
Created all things, even heaven and sea,<BR>
And tireless sun, and full moon and bright stars,<BR>
And mighty mother Tethys, springs and rivers,<BR>
Imperishable fire, and days and nights.<BR>
30 This is the God who formed four-lettered Adam,<BR>
The first one formed, and filling with his name<BR>
East, west, and south, and north. The same is he<BR>
Who fixed the pattern of the human form,<BR>
And made wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls.<BR>

<P>But vainly go astray and bow the knee<BR>
To serpents, and make offering to cats,<BR>
And idols, and stone images of men,<BR>
And sit before the doors of godless temples;<BR>
40 Ye guard him who is God, who keeps all things,<BR>
And merry with the wickedness of stones<BR>
Forget the judgment of the immortal Saviour<BR>
Who made the heaven and earth. Alas! a race<BR>
That has delight in blood, deceitful, vile,<BR>
45 Ungodly, of false, double-tongued, immoral men,<BR>
Adulterous, idolous, designing fraud,<BR>
An evil madness raving in their hearts,<BR>
For themselves plundering, having shameless soul;<BR>
For no one who has riches will impart<BR>
50 To another, but dire wickedness shall be<BR>
Among all mortals, and for sake of gain<BR>
Will many widows not at all keep faith,<BR>
But secretly love others, and the bond<BR>
Of life those who have husbands do not keep.<BR>
55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Rome shall o'er Egypt also rule<BR>
Governing always, then shall there appear<BR>
The greatest kingdom of the immortal King<BR>
Over men. And a holy Lord shall come<BR>
To hold the scepter over every land<BR>
60 Unto all ages of fast-hastening time.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[55. The time when Rome obtained full control of Egypt was when Augustus became the undisputed master of the regions all about the Mediterranean Sea, and the Roman empire became fully established.

With their own houses, when from heaven shall flow<BR>
65 A fiery cataract. Ah, wretched me!<BR>
When shall that day and when shall judgment come<BR>
Of the immortal God, the mighty King?<BR>
But just now, O ye cities, ye are built<BR>
And all adorned with temples and race-grounds,<BR>
70 Markets, and images of wood, of gold,<BR>
Of silver and of stone, that ye may come<BR>
Unto the bitter day. For it shall come,<BR>
When there shall pass among all men a stench<BR>
Of brimstone. Yet each thing will I declare,<BR>

Hereafter, and the height of hills shall he<BR>
Establish, and shall make the sea stand still<BR>
And the great fiery sun and the bright moon<BR>
80 And he shall raise the dead, and many signs<BR>

<P>76.

But when the threatenings of the mighty God<BR>
Shall draw near, and a flaming power shall come<BR>
By billow to the earth, it shall consume<BR>
Both Beliar and all the haughty men<BR>
90 Who put their trust in him. And thereupon<BR>
Shall the whole world be governed by the hands<BR>
Of a woman and obedient everywhere.<BR>
Then when a widow shall o'er all the world<BR>
Gain the rule, and cast in the mighty sea<BR>
95 Both gold and silver, also brass and iron<BR>
Of short lived men into the deep shall cast,<BR>
Then all the elements shall be bereft<BR>
Of order, when the God who dwells on high<BR>
Shall roll the heaven, even as a scroll is rolled;<BR>
100 And to the mighty earth and sea shall fall<BR>
The entire multiform sky; and there shall flow<BR>
A tireless cataract of raging fire,<BR>
And it shall burn the land, and burn the sea,<BR>
And heavenly sky, and night, and day, and melt<BR>

What is pure. No more laughing spheres of light,<BR>

But here again the picture of world-judgment which immediately follows is difficult to account for in connection with such a mention of Cleopatra. Is not the entire passage rather an ideal apocalyptic concept, to be understood somewhat after the manner of the woman portrayed in John's Apocalypse, xvii, 3; xviii, 7; a symbol of Rome herself conceived as the mistress of nations?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the threatenings of the mighty God<BR>
Are fulfilled, which he threatened mortals once,<BR>
When in Assyrian land they built a tower;--<BR>
120 (And they all spoke one language, and resolved<BR>
To mount aloft into the starry heaven;<BR>
But on the air the Immortal straightway put<BR>
A mighty force; and then winds from above<BR>
Cast down the great tower and stirred mortals up<BR>
125 To wrangling with each other; therefore men<BR>

<P>130 And then the generation tenth appeared<BR>
Of mortal men, from the time when the flood<BR>
Came upon earlier men. And Cronos reigned,<BR>
And Titan and Iapetus; and men called them<BR>
Best offspring of Gaia and of Uranus,<BR>
135 Giving to them names both of earth and heaven,<BR>
Since they were very first of mortal men.<BR>
So there were three divisions of the earth<BR>
According to the allotment of each man,<BR>
And each one having his own portion reigned<BR>
140 And fought not; for a father's oaths were there<BR>
And equal were their portions. But the time<BR>
Complete of old age on the father came,<BR>
And he died; and the sons infringing oaths<BR>
Stirred up against each other bitter strife,<BR>
145 Which one should have the royal rank and rule<BR>
Over all mortals; and against each other<BR>
Cronos and Titan fought. But Rhea and Gaia,<BR>
And Aphrodite fond of crowns, Demeter,<BR>
And Hestia and Dione of fair locks<BR>

In hexameter verse she thus expounds the descent and exploits of Saturn."</P>
<P>132. <I>Cronos</I>.--Greek name for the more familiar Latin title Saturn. The story of the Titans in the following lines (132-187) is familiar to students of Greek mythology, but the old myth exists with numerous minor variations, and, according to Hesiod (<I>Theog.</I>, 453-500), the birth and preservation of Zeus were somewhat different from this story.]</P>

<P>And they judged Cronos should reign king of all,<BR>
For he was oldest and of noblest form.<BR>
155 But Titan laid on Cronos mighty oaths<BR>
To rear no male posterity, that he<BR>
Himself might reign when age and fate should come<BR>
To Cronos. And whenever Rhea bore<BR>
Beside her sat the Titans, and all males<BR>
160 In pieces tore, but let the females live<BR>
To be reared by the mother. But When now<BR>
At the third birth the august Rhea bore,<BR>
She brought forth Hera first; and when they saw<BR>
A female offspring, the fierce Titan men<BR>
165 Betook them to their homes. And thereupon<BR>
Rhea a male child bore, and having bound<BR>
Three men of Crete by oath she quickly sent<BR>
Him into Phrygia to be reared apart<BR>
In secret; therefore did they name him Zeus,<BR>
170 For he was sent away. And thus she sent<BR>
Poseidon also secretly away.<BR>
And Pluto, third, did Rhea yet again,<BR>
Noblest of women, at Dodona bear,<BR>

The Sibylline writer does not distinguish between the two. <I>Europus</I> is another name for the Titaresius, which, according to Strabo (<I>Geog</I>. ix, 5, 19; and <I>Fragment</I> 15) was a tributary to the Peneus, and flowed with it through the vale of Tempe to the sea. Comp. Homer, <I>Iliad</I> ii, 750-755, where mention is made of "wintry Dodona," and "lovely Titaresius," which, however, does not mingle with the Peneus, because it is a broken-off portion of the Styx.]</P>

<P>But when the Titans heard that there were sons<BR>

180 Together gathered, and held fast in chains<BR>
Cronos and his wife Rhea, and concealed<BR>
Them in the earth and guarded them in bonds.<BR>
And then the sons of powerful Cronos heard,<BR>
And a great war and uproar they aroused.<BR>
185 And this is the beginning of dire war<BR>
Among all mortals. [For it is indeed<BR>
With mortals the prime origin of war.]<BR>

Ewald (p. 32) understands the king to be the Messiah, and, indeed, the language of lines 352 and 353 (Greek text, 286, 287), taken apart from the context, naturally suggests a supernatural ruler and judge. The poet may have intended to connect the advent of the Messiah with the restoration of the Jews and the rebuilding of their temple. But the context here and in the parallel passage, lines 817-826 below, points rather to Cyrus, whom Isaiah calls the anointed one of Jehovah and represents as the conqueror of nations, "saying of Jerusalem, She shall be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid."</P>

Previously, in the same chapter, he says: "The Roman name by which the world is now ruled shall be taken from the earth, and the power will revert to Asia, and the East will again rule, and the West will be in subjection." The "virgin" addressed in line 442, being a "child of Latin Rome," cannot without unnatural violence be understood of "the virgin daughter of the true God, the community of Israel, which, while inflicting divine punishment, also contributes to the true welfare" (Ewald, p. 19), but is rather a poetical name for Rome herself. The "mistress," in line 446, is understood by Alexandre of the goddess Fortune, whom Horace (<I>Od.</I>, i, 35) addresses as able "in a moment either to lift a mortal body from the lowest place, or to turn the noblest triumphs into funeral scenes."]</P>

Such ill-advised action would be "moving Camarina," or provoking a fierce leopard in his lair. Another view is that the oracle dates about the beginning of the rise of the Maccabees, and is an exhortation to the Ptolemies to send to Jerusalem Jewish forces, numerous in Alexandria, to help their brethren in the Holy Land. But all the attempts to make the passage fit particular persons and events involve so much of fancy and conjecture that one may well hesitate to adopt any of them.</P>
<P>918. <I>Camarina</I>.--The allusion is to the well-known story of draining the marsh of Camarina, a city of southern Sicily. The inhabitants, disregarding the oracle, drained the neighboring marsh, which was believed to breed pestilence, and by so doing they opened a way for their enemies to come and destroy their city. Hence the proverb, "Move not Camarina," was equivalent to: Do not seek to remove one evil in a way that is likely to bring on another and greater one. Comp. Vergil, <I>&AElig;n.</I>, iii, 701.]</P>

<P>To be inquired of by men yet to be,<BR>
But what God gave for faithful men to honor;<BR>
965 For mortal temple of the mighty God<BR>
Shall call it. And all pathways of the plain<BR>
And rough hills and high mountains and wild waves<BR>
Of the deep shall be easy in those days<BR>
For crossing and for sailing; for all peace<BR>
970 On the land of the good shall come; and sword<BR>
Shall prophets of the mighty God remove;<BR>
For they are judges and the righteous kings<BR>
Of mortals. And there shall be righteous wealth<BR>
Among mankind; for of the mighty God<BR>
975 This is the judgment and also the power.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be of good cheer, O maiden, and be glad;<BR>
For he who made the heaven and earth gave thee<BR>
Joy in thy age. And he will dwell in thee;<BR>
And thine shall be immortal and wolves<BR>
980 And lambs shall in the mountains feed on grass<BR>
Together, and with kids shall leopards graze;<BR>
And bears shall lodge among the pasturing calves;<BR>
And the carnivorous lion shall eat chaff<BR>
At the manger like the cow; and little children<BR>
985 In bonds shall lead them; for he will make beasts<BR>
Helpless on earth. With babes shall fall asleep<BR>
Serpents, along with asps, and do no harm;<BR>
For over them shall be the hand of God.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now tell I thee a sign exceeding clear,<BR>
990 That thou may'st know when the end of all things</P>

<P>On earth shall be. When in the starry heaven<BR>
Swords shall by night point straight toward west and east,<BR>
Straightway shalt there be also from the heaven<BR>
A cloud of dust borne forth to all the earth,<BR>
995 And the sun's brightness in the midst of heaven<BR>
Shall be eclipsed, and the moon's beams appear<BR>
And come again on earth; by drops of blood<BR>
Distilling from the rocks a sign shalt be;<BR>
And in the cloud shalt ye behold a war<BR>
1000 Of foot and horse, like the chase of wild beasts<BR>
In the dense fog. This end of all things God<BR>
Shalt consummate, whose dwelling is in heaven.<BR>
But all must sacrifice to the great King.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things I show thee, I who madly left<BR>
1005 The long walls of Assyrian Babylon<BR>
For Hellas to proclaim to all the wrath<BR>
Of God, fire sent. . . .<BR>

And that I might to mortals prophesy<BR>
Of mysteries divine. And men shalt say<BR>
1010 In Hellas that I am of foreign Land,<BR>
Of Erythre born, shameless; others say<BR>
That I'm a Sibyl, born of mother Circe<BR>
And father Gnostos raving mad and false;<BR>
But at that time when all thing come to pass<BR>
1015 Ye shall remember me, and no one more</P>

<P>Shall call me mad, the great God's prophetess,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he showed me what happened formerly<BR>
To my ancestors; what things were the first<BR>
Those God made known to me; and in my mind<BR>
1020 Did God put all things to be afterwards,<BR>
That I might prophesy of things to come,<BR>
And things that were, and tell them unto men.<BR>
For when the world was deluged with a flood<BR>
Of waters, and one man of good repute<BR>
1025 Alone was left and in a wooden house<BR>
Sailed o'er the waters with the beasts and birds,<BR>
In order that the world might be refilled,<BR>
I was his son's bride and was of his race<BR>
To whom the first things happened, and the last<BR>
1030 Were all made known; and thus from mine own mouth<BR>
Let all these truthful things remain declared.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1028. <I>His son's bride</I>.--Literally and strictly, I was his bride ({Greek <I>nu'mfh</I>}) but the word is probably employed here as in the later Greek usage, in the use of daughter-in-law. Nevertheless, in book vii, 219, the Sibyl says she had a son by her father. Compare, however, book i, 350-353; ii, 416-425. In book v, 15, she calls herself sister of Isis.]</P>
