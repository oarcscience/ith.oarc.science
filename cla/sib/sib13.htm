<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GREAT word divine he bids me sing again--<BR>
The immortal holy God imperishable,<BR>
Who gives to kings their power and takes away,<BR>
And who determined for them time both ways,<BR>
5 Both that of life and that of baneful death.<BR>
And these the heavenly God enjoins on me<BR>
Unwilling to bring tidings unto kings<BR>
Concerning royal power. . . .<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>
And spear impetuous Ares; and by him<BR>
10 All perish, child and the old man who gives<BR>
To the assemblies laws; and many wars<BR>
And battles there shall be, and homicides,<BR>
Famines and pestilences, earthquake-shocks<BR>
And mighty thunderbolts, and many ways<BR>
15 Of the Assyrians over all the world,<BR>
And pillaging and robbery of temples.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then an insurrection there shall be<BR>
Of the industrious Persians, and with them<BR>
Indians, Armenians, and Arabians;<BR>
20 And unto these again a Roman king</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The twelfth and thirteenth books are as closely connected as are the first and second, and like them are probably the work of one author. After the words "royal power," in the eighth line, there is a noticeable defect in the text.</P>

<P>18. <I>Persians</I>.--The Sassanid&aelig;, as in book xi, 356.</P>
<P>20. <I>Roman king</I>.--Gordian III, who defeated the Persian army under {footnote p. 226} Sapor on the banks of the Chaboras, a branch of the Euphrates, and was soon afterward killed by Philippus (M. Julius Philippus), who succeeded to the empire.]</P>

<P>Insatiate in war and leading on<BR>
His spearmen against the Assyrians<BR>
Shall draw near, a young Ares, and as far<BR>
As the deep-flowing silvery Euphrates<BR>
25 Shall warlike Ares stretch his deadly spear<BR>
Because of . . .<BR>
For by his friend betrayed he shall fall down<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ranks smitten by the gleaming iron.<BR>
And straightway coming out of Syria<BR>
30 There shall a purple-loving warrior rule,<BR>
Terror of Ares, and also his son,<BR>
A C&aelig;sar, shall even all the earth oppress;<BR>
And the one name is unto both of them:<BR>
On first and twentieth there are to be placed<BR>
35 Five hundred. But when these in wars shall rule,<BR>
And laws shall be enacted, there shall be<BR>
A little rest from war, not for long time;<BR>
But when a wolf shall to a flock of sheep<BR>
Pledge solemn oaths against the white-toothed dogs,<BR>
40 Then, having misled, he will tear in pieces<BR>
The woolly sheep, and cast his oaths aside;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[26. Here the Greek text is somewhat corrupt and uncertain.</P>
<P>29. <I>Out of Syria</I>.--The reference is to M. Julius Philippus, who was called the Arabian because of his birth in Bostra, Syria, somewhere to the south of Damascus.</P>
<P>31. <I>His son</I>.--Philippus associated his son, of the same name, with him in the empire.</P>
<P>34, 35. The Greek letter for five hundred is {Greek F}, initial of Philippus. The "one and twenty" is to be understood as denoting the initials (A=1 and K=20) of Augustus, the title assumed by the father, and C&aelig;sar (Kaisar), the name of his son.</P>

<P>And then shall there be an unlawful strife<BR>
Of haughty kings in wars, and Syrians<BR>
Shall perish terribly, and Indians<BR>
45 And the Armenians and Arabians,<BR>
The Persians and the Babylonians<BR>
Shall one another by hard fights destroy.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when a Roman Ares shall destroy<BR>
A German Ares ruinous of life<BR>
50 Triumphing on the ocean, then is war<BR>
Of many years for haughty Persian men,<BR>
But for them there shall not be victory;<BR>
For as a fish swims not upon the point<BR>
Of a high many-ridged and windy rock<BR>
55 Precipitant, nor does a tortoise fly,<BR>
Nor does an eagle into water come,<BR>
So also are the Persians in that day<BR>
Far off from victory, while the fond nurse<BR>
Of the Italians, in the plain of Nile<BR>
60 Reposing by the sacred water's side,<BR>
Sends forth the appointed lot to seven-hilled Rome.<BR>
Now these things are; and while the name of Rome<BR>
Shall hold in numbers of revolving time,<BR>
So many years shall the great noble city<BR>
65 Of Macedon's lord, willing, deal out corn.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another much-distressing pain I'll sing<BR>
For Alexandrians who are destroyed<BR>
By reason of the strife of shameful men.<BR>
Strong men who were aforetime terrible</P>

<P>70 Being then impotent shall pray for peace<BR>
By reason of the wickedness of chiefs.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there shall come wrath of the mighty God<BR>
On the Assyrians and a mountain stream<BR>
Shall utterly destroy them, which shall come<BR>
75 To C&aelig;sar's city and harm Canaanites.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pyramus shall irrigate the city<BR>
Of Mopsus; then shall the &AElig;g&aelig;ans fall<BR>
Because of strife of very mighty men.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee, wretched Antioch, shall Ares strong<BR>
80 Leave not while round thee an Assyrian war<BR>
Is pressing, for a chief of men shall dwell<BR>
Within thy houses who shall fight with all<BR>
The arrow-hurling Persians, he himself<BR>
Having obtained of Romans royal power.<BR>
85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, cities of Arabians, deck yourselves<BR>
With temples and with places for the race,<BR>
And with broad markets and with splendid wealth,<BR>
With images, gold, silver, ivory;<BR>
And thou who art of all most fond of learning,<BR>
90 Bostra and Philippopolis, that thou may'st come<BR>
Into great sorrow; and the laughing spheres<BR>
Of the zodiacal vault, Aries,<BR>
Taurus, and Gemini, and as many stars<BR>
Ruling hours as with them in heaven appear</P>

<P>95 Shall benefit thee not; thou, wretched one,<BR>
Hast trusted many, when that very man<BR>
Shall afterwards bring near that which is thine.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now for Alexandrians loving war<BR>
Will I sing wars most dreadful; and much people<BR>
100 Shall perish while their cities are destroyed<BR>
By citizens against each other matched<BR>
And fighting for the sake of hateful strife,<BR>
And round them horrid Ares, rushing on,<BR>
Shall cease from war. And then one of great soul<BR>
105 Along with his own mighty son shall fall<BR>
By treachery on the older king's account.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after him there shall rule powerfully<BR>
O'er fertile Rome another great-souled lord<BR>
Versed in war, coming from the Dacians<BR>
110 And numbering three hundred; he shall have<BR>
Also the letter of the number four,<BR>
And many shall be slay, and then the king<BR>
Shall all his brothers and his friends destroy<BR>
Even while the kings are cut off, and straightway<BR>
115 Shall there be fights and pillagings and murders<BR>
Suddenly on the older king's account.<BR>
Then, when a wily man shall summoned come,</P>

Sent by the emperor Philip against Mœsia, the troops proclaimed him emperor, and he exercised the imperial power for about two years. The names Trajan and Decius are represented by their initial letters, which are the Greek numerals respectively for <I>three hundred</I> and <I>four</I>.</P>

<P>A robber and a Roman not well known<BR>
From Syria appearing, he by guile<BR>
120 Into a race of Cappadocian men<BR>
Shall drive through and, besieging, shall press hard,<BR>
Insatiate of war. And then for thee,<BR>
Tyana and Mazaka, there shall be<BR>
A capture; thou shalt be enslaved and put<BR>
125 Upon thy neck again a fearful yoke.<BR>
Arid Syria shall mourn for men destroyed<BR>
And then Selenian goddess shall not guard<BR>
Her holy city. But when he by flight<BR>
From Syria shall before the Romans come,<BR>
130 And shall pass over the Euphrates' streams,<BR>
No longer like the Romans, but like fierce<BR>
Dart-shooting Persians, then, fulfilling fate,<BR>
Down shall the ruler of the Italians fall<BR>
In the ranks smitten by the gleaming iron;<BR>
135 And close upon him shall his children perish.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when another king of Rome shall reign,<BR>
Then also to the Romans there shall come<BR>
Unstable nations, on the walls of Rome<BR>
Destructive Ares with his bastard son;<BR>
140 Then also shall be famines, pestilence,<BR>
And mighty thunderbolts, and dreadful wars,</P>

<P>And anarchy in cities suddenly;<BR>
And the Syrians shall perish fearfully;<BR>
For there shall come upon them the great wrath<BR>
145 Of the Most High and straightway an uprising<BR>
of the industrious Persians, and mixed up<BR>
With Persians shall the Syrians destroy<BR>
The Romans, but by the divine decree<BR>
They shall not make a conquest of their laws.<BR>
150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, how many with their goods shall flee<BR>
Front the East unto men of other tongues<BR>
Alas, the dark blood of how many men<BR>
The land shall drink! For that shall be a time<BR>
In which the living uttering o'er the dead<BR>
155 A blessing shall by word of mouth pronounce<BR>
Death beautiful and death shall flee from them.<BR>
And now for thee, O wretched Syria,<BR>
I weep in sorrow; for to thee shall come<BR>
A dreadful blow from arrow-shooting men,<BR>
160 Which thou didst never think would come to thee.<BR>
Also the fugitive of Rome shall come<BR>
Bearing a great spear, Crossing on his way<BR>
Euphrates with his many myriads,<BR>
And he shall burn thee, and dispose all things<BR>
165 In a bad way. O wretched Antioch,<BR>
And thee a city they shall never call,<BR>

Under the spears; and stripping off all things<BR>

Of Casius shall dwell and by Amanus<BR>
How many, and how many Lycus laves,<BR>
And Marsyas as many and Pyramus<BR>
The silver-eddying; for even to the bounds<BR>
180 Of Asia they shall treasure up their spoils,<BR>
Make cities naked, and bear idols off<BR>
And cast down temples on much-nourishing earth.<BR>
And sometime to Gauls and Pannonians,<BR>
To Mysians and Bithynians there shall be<BR>
185 Great sorrow when a warrior shall have come.<BR>

To lick thy blood, when Sannians shall come<BR>

Men perishing by pestilence and war.<BR>
And the Persians maddened by the Ausonians<BR>
200 Shall in the toil of Ares yet again<BR>
Force their way. And then there shall be a flight<BR>
Of Romans; and thereafter there shall come<BR>
The priest heard of all round, sent by the sun,<BR>
From Syria appearing and by guile<BR>
205 Shall he accomplish all things. And then too<BR>
The city of the sun shall offer prayer;<BR>
And round about her shall the Persians dare<BR>

So dread, that sends forth many piping sounds,<BR>
And the he-goat that sideways moves along,<BR>
