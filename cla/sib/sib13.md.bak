### BOOK XIII.

    GREAT word divine he bids me sing again--  
The immortal holy God imperishable,  
Who gives to kings their power and takes away,  
And who determined for them time both ways,  
5 Both that of life and that of baneful death.  
And these the heavenly God enjoins on me  
Unwilling to bring tidings unto kings  
Concerning royal power. . . .  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
And spear impetuous Ares; and by him  
10 All perish, child and the old man who gives  
To the assemblies laws; and many wars  
And battles there shall be, and homicides,  
Famines and pestilences, earthquake-shocks  
And mighty thunderbolts, and many ways  
15 Of the Assyrians over all the world,  
And pillaging and robbery of temples.  
    And then an insurrection there shall be  
Of the industrious Persians, and with them  
Indians, Armenians, and Arabians;  
20 And unto these again a Roman king

\[1. The twelfth and thirteenth books are as closely connected as are
the first and second, and like them are probably the work of one author.
After the words "royal power," in the eighth line, there is a noticeable
defect in the text.

9\. *Impetuous Ares*.--Reference probably to Maximinus.

18\. *Persians*.--The Sassanidæ, as in book xi, 356.

20\. *Roman king*.--Gordian III, who defeated the Persian army under
{footnote p. 226} Sapor on the banks of the Chaboras, a branch of the
Euphrates, and was soon afterward killed by Philippus (M. Julius
Philippus), who succeeded to the empire.\]

(1-14.)

{p. 226}

Insatiate in war and leading on  
His spearmen against the Assyrians  
Shall draw near, a young Ares, and as far  
As the deep-flowing silvery Euphrates  
25 Shall warlike Ares stretch his deadly spear  
Because of . . .  
For by his friend betrayed he shall fall down  
    In the ranks smitten by the gleaming iron.  
And straightway coming out of Syria  
30 There shall a purple-loving warrior rule,  
Terror of Ares, and also his son,  
A Cæsar, shall even all the earth oppress;  
And the one name is unto both of them:  
On first and twentieth there are to be placed  
35 Five hundred. But when these in wars shall rule,  
And laws shall be enacted, there shall be  
A little rest from war, not for long time;  
But when a wolf shall to a flock of sheep  
Pledge solemn oaths against the white-toothed dogs,  
40 Then, having misled, he will tear in pieces  
The woolly sheep, and cast his oaths aside;

\[26. Here the Greek text is somewhat corrupt and uncertain.

29\. *Out of Syria*.--The reference is to M. Julius Philippus, who was
called the Arabian because of his birth in Bostra, Syria, somewhere to
the south of Damascus.

31\. *His son*.--Philippus associated his son, of the same name, with
him in the empire.

34, 35. The Greek letter for five hundred is {Greek F}, initial of
Philippus. The "one and twenty" is to be understood as denoting the
initials (A=1 and K=20) of Augustus, the title assumed by the father,
and Cæsar (Kaisar), the name of his son.

38, 39. Comp. book xiv, 448, 449.\]

(16-30.)

{p. 227}

And then shall there be an unlawful strife  
Of haughty kings in wars, and Syrians  
Shall perish terribly, and Indians  
45 And the Armenians and Arabians,  
The Persians and the Babylonians  
Shall one another by hard fights destroy.  
    But when a Roman Ares shall destroy  
A German Ares ruinous of life  
50 Triumphing on the ocean, then is war  
Of many years for haughty Persian men,  
But for them there shall not be victory;  
For as a fish swims not upon the point  
Of a high many-ridged and windy rock  
55 Precipitant, nor does a tortoise fly,  
Nor does an eagle into water come,  
So also are the Persians in that day  
Far off from victory, while the fond nurse  
Of the Italians, in the plain of Nile  
60 Reposing by the sacred water's side,  
Sends forth the appointed lot to seven-hilled Rome.  
Now these things are; and while the name of Rome  
Shall hold in numbers of revolving time,  
So many years shall the great noble city  
65 Of Macedon's lord, willing, deal out corn.  
    Another much-distressing pain I'll sing  
For Alexandrians who are destroyed  
By reason of the strife of shameful men.  
Strong men who were aforetime terrible

\[48. *Roman Ares*.--Comp. book xii, 355, 356.

58, 59. Nurse of the Italians.--Alexandria, as representing Egypt and
source of the grain supply of Italy and the Roman world.

62\. Name of Rome.--Comp. book viii, 195, and the note on the numerical
value of the letters of the name.\]

(31-52.)

{p. 228}

70 Being then impotent shall pray for peace  
By reason of the wickedness of chiefs.  
    And there shall come wrath of the mighty God  
On the Assyrians and a mountain stream  
Shall utterly destroy them, which shall come  
75 To Cæsar's city and harm Canaanites.  
    The Pyramus shall irrigate the city  
Of Mopsus; then shall the Ægæans fall  
Because of strife of very mighty men.  
    Thee, wretched Antioch, shall Ares strong  
80 Leave not while round thee an Assyrian war  
Is pressing, for a chief of men shall dwell  
Within thy houses who shall fight with all  
The arrow-hurling Persians, he himself  
Having obtained of Romans royal power.  
85    Now, cities of Arabians, deck yourselves  
With temples and with places for the race,  
And with broad markets and with splendid wealth,  
With images, gold, silver, ivory;  
And thou who art of all most fond of learning,  
90 Bostra and Philippopolis, that thou may'st come  
Into great sorrow; and the laughing spheres  
Of the zodiacal vault, Aries,  
Taurus, and Gemini, and as many stars  
Ruling hours as with them in heaven appear

\[15. *Cæsar's city*.--Perhaps referring to Cæsarea Philippi.

76\. *Pyramus*.--River of Cilicia.

77\. *Mopsus*.--More commonly called Mopsuestia, a town situated on the
Pyramus. *Ægæans*.--Inhabitants of the city of Ægæ, near the mouth of
this same river.

79\. *Wretched Antioch*.--Comp. line 165, and book iv, 181.

90\. *Bostra*.--Situated some fifty miles to the south of Damascus.

91-95. These allusions to the constellations may imply notable devotion
to astrology on the part of the people of Arabia.\]

(53-71.)

{p. 229}

95 Shall benefit thee not; thou, wretched one,  
Hast trusted many, when that very man  
Shall afterwards bring near that which is thine.  
    And now for Alexandrians loving war  
Will I sing wars most dreadful; and much people  
100 Shall perish while their cities are destroyed  
By citizens against each other matched  
And fighting for the sake of hateful strife,  
And round them horrid Ares, rushing on,  
Shall cease from war. And then one of great soul  
105 Along with his own mighty son shall fall  
By treachery on the older king's account.  
    And after him there shall rule powerfully  
O'er fertile Rome another great-souled lord  
Versed in war, coming from the Dacians  
110 And numbering three hundred; he shall have  
Also the letter of the number four,  
And many shall be slay, and then the king  
Shall all his brothers and his friends destroy  
Even while the kings are cut off, and straightway  
115 Shall there be fights and pillagings and murders  
Suddenly on the older king's account.  
Then, when a wily man shall summoned come,

\[104-106. The father and son here referred to are the same as those
described in lines 29-33.

107-112. This seems to describe Trajan of Pannonia, who is better known
as Decius. Sent by the emperor Philip against Mœsia, the troops
proclaimed him emperor, and he exercised the imperial power for about
two years. The names Trajan and Decius are represented by their initial
letters, which are the Greek numerals respectively for *three hundred*
and *four*.

116\. Comp. line 106 above. The *older king* is here apparently intended
for Philip.

117\. *Wily man*.--Referring perhaps to Cyriades, one of the so-called
"thirty tyrants" who arose in various parts of the empire about this
time.\]

(72-89.)

{p. 230}

A robber and a Roman not well known  
From Syria appearing, he by guile  
120 Into a race of Cappadocian men  
Shall drive through and, besieging, shall press hard,  
Insatiate of war. And then for thee,  
Tyana and Mazaka, there shall be  
A capture; thou shalt be enslaved and put  
125 Upon thy neck again a fearful yoke.  
Arid Syria shall mourn for men destroyed  
And then Selenian goddess shall not guard  
Her holy city. But when he by flight  
From Syria shall before the Romans come,  
130 And shall pass over the Euphrates' streams,  
No longer like the Romans, but like fierce  
Dart-shooting Persians, then, fulfilling fate,  
Down shall the ruler of the Italians fall  
In the ranks smitten by the gleaming iron;  
135 And close upon him shall his children perish.  
    But when another king of Rome shall reign,  
Then also to the Romans there shall come  
Unstable nations, on the walls of Rome  
Destructive Ares with his bastard son;  
140 Then also shall be famines, pestilence,  
And mighty thunderbolts, and dreadful wars,

\[123. *Tyana and Mazaka*.--Chief cities of Cappadocia.

127\. *Selenian goddess*.--Goddess of the moon. *Her holy city* maybe
understood as Seleucia on the Tigris, once noted for the worship of the
moon.

133\. *Ruler of the Italians*.--Decius Trajan, described in lines
107-112 above, who was smitten down under a shower of darts while
fighting the Goths.

136\. *Another king*.--Gallus Trebonianus, who was proclaimed emperor by
the legions on the death of Decius.

139\. *Bastard son*.--Reference to Volusianus, son of Gallus.

140\. Comp. lines 11-14 above, and book xii, 149, 150, 202-204.\]

(90-106.)

{p. 231}

And anarchy in cities suddenly;  
And the Syrians shall perish fearfully;  
For there shall come upon them the great wrath  
145 Of the Most High and straightway an uprising  
of the industrious Persians, and mixed up  
With Persians shall the Syrians destroy  
The Romans, but by the divine decree  
They shall not make a conquest of their laws.  
150    Alas, how many with their goods shall flee  
Front the East unto men of other tongues  
Alas, the dark blood of how many men  
The land shall drink! For that shall be a time  
In which the living uttering o'er the dead  
155 A blessing shall by word of mouth pronounce  
Death beautiful and death shall flee from them.  
And now for thee, O wretched Syria,  
I weep in sorrow; for to thee shall come  
A dreadful blow from arrow-shooting men,  
160 Which thou didst never think would come to thee.  
Also the fugitive of Rome shall come  
Bearing a great spear, Crossing on his way  
Euphrates with his many myriads,  
And he shall burn thee, and dispose all things  
165 In a bad way. O wretched Antioch,  
And thee a city they shall never call,  
When by thy lack of prudence thou shalt fall  
Under the spears; and stripping off all things  
And making naked he shall leave thee thus  
170 Coverless, houseless; and when anyone

{p. 232}

Sees he shall of a sudden weep for thee.  
And thou shalt be, O Hierapolis,  
A triumph, also thou, Berœa; weep  
At Chalcis over lately wounded sons.  
175    Alas, how many by the steep high mount  
Of Casius shall dwell and by Amanus  
How many, and how many Lycus laves,  
And Marsyas as many and Pyramus  
The silver-eddying; for even to the bounds  
180 Of Asia they shall treasure up their spoils,  
Make cities naked, and bear idols off  
And cast down temples on much-nourishing earth.  
And sometime to Gauls and Pannonians,  
To Mysians and Bithynians there shall be  
185 Great sorrow when a warrior shall have come.  
    O Lycians, Lycians, there shall come a wolf  
To lick thy blood, when Sannians shall come  
With city-wasting Ares and the Carpians  
Shall draw near with Ausonians to fight.  
190    And then by his own shameless recklessness  
The bastard son shall put the king to death,  
And he himself for his impiety  
Shall straightway perish. And again shall rule  
After him yet another whose name shows

\[172-174. *Hierapolis . . . Berœa . . . Chalcis*.--Cities of Syria,
eastward from Antioch.

176\. *Casius*.--Rising to the south of Antioch. Amanus.--A mountain
range north of Antioch and overlooking the valley of Pyramus.

177\. *Lycus*.--River of Pontus.

178\. *Marsyas*.--A river of Syria, a branch of the Orontes.

183-189. The mention of these widely separated provinces depicts the
broad range of the desolating wars of this period.

191\. *Bastard son*.--The same as in line 139.\]

(128-144.)

{p. 233}

195 First letter; but he too shall quickly fall  
By mighty Ares, struck by gleaming iron.  
    And yet again the world shall be confused,  
Men perishing by pestilence and war.  
And the Persians maddened by the Ausonians  
200 Shall in the toil of Ares yet again  
Force their way. And then there shall be a flight  
Of Romans; and thereafter there shall come  
The priest heard of all round, sent by the sun,  
From Syria appearing and by guile  
205 Shall he accomplish all things. And then too  
The city of the sun shall offer prayer;  
And round about her shall the Persians dare  
The fearful threatenings of the Phœnicians.  
    But when two chiefs, men swift in war, shall rule  
210 The very mighty Romans, one of whom  
Shall have the number seventy, and the other  
The number three, even then the stately bull,  
That digs the earth with his hoofs and stirs up  
The dust with his two horns, shall many ills  
215 Upon a dark-skinned reptile perpetrate--  
Which draws a trail with his scales; and besides,

\[195. *First letter*.--Evidently denoting Æmilianus, who was himself in
turn cut off before he had reigned four months.

199\. *Persians . . . again*.--Under Sapor, who captured Valerian, put
the Romans to flight, and spread destruction over Syria and Cappadocia.

203\. *Priest*.--Odenatus.

206\. *City of the sun*.--Here referring to Palmyra.

211\. *Seventy . . . three*.--The first is represented by {Greek *O*},
initial of the Greek form of the name Valerian \[{Greek
*Ou?alh\~rianos*}\], and the second by {Greek *G*}, initial of
Gallienus.

212\. *Bull*.--Here representing Valerian, who dealt out many ills to
the Persians, but was himself destroyed.

215\. *Dark-skinned reptile*.--Sapor, King of the Persians.\]

(145-161.)

{p. 234}

Himself shall perish. And yet after him  
Again shall come another fair-horned stag,  
Hungry upon the mountains, striving hard  
220 To feed upon the venom-shedding beasts  
Then shall a dread and fearful lion come,  
Sent from the sun, and breathing forth much flame.  
And then too by his shameless recklessness  
Shall he destroy the well-horned rapid stag,  
225 And the most mighty venom-shedding beast  
So dread, that sends forth many piping sounds,  
And the he-goat that sideways moves along,  
And after him fame follows; he himself  
Sound, unhurt, unapproachable, shall rule  
230 The Romans, and the Persians shall be weak.  
    But, Lord, King of the world, O God, restrain  
The song of our words, and give charming song.

\[218. *Stag*.--Macrianus, the Roman general.

221\. *Lion*.--Odenatus.

225\. *Most mighty . . . beast*.--The Persians.

227\. *He-goat*.--Reference doubtful. Alexandre suggests Balista, one of
the so-called "thirty tyrants," who made pretension to the throne in the
reign of Gallienus. Comp. Dan. viii, 5, for the same figure.

228\. *He himself*.--Odenatus.
