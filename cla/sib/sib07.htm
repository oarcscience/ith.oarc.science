<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUT come, now, hear of me the mournful time<BR>
Of sons of Latium. And first of all,<BR>
After the kings of Egypt were destroyed<BR>
And the like earth had downwards borne them all,<BR>
5 And after Pella's townsman, under whom<BR>
The whole East and the rich West were cast down,<BR>
whom Babylon dishonored, and stretched out<BR>
For Philip a dead body (not of Zeus,<BR>
Of Ammon not true things were prophesied),<BR>
10 And after that one of the race and blood<BR>
Of king Assaracus, who came from Troy,<BR>
Even he who cleft the violence of fire,<BR>
And after many lords, and after men<BR>
To Ares dear, and after the young babes,<BR>
15 The children of the beast that feeds on sheep,<BR>
The very first lord shall be, who shall sum<BR>
Twice ten with the first letter of his name;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Next to the third, this fifth book is the longest in our present collection of oracles. It is clearly a composite of Jewish and Christian material, and as the three Antonines are referred to in line 72, we cannot suppose that the book in its present form existed prior to the middle of the second century of the Christian era.</P>
<P>5. <I>Pella's townsman</I>.--Alexander the Great.</P>
<P>9. Not true things.--In this parenthetic way the Sibyl declares that the popular traditions of Alexander as having sprung from Zeus or from Ammon were proven untrue.</P>
<P>11. <I>Assaracus</I>.--Ancestor of &AElig;neas.</P>
<P>14. <I>Babes</I>.--Romulus and Remus.</P>
<P>16. <I>The very first lord</I>.--First in the line of C&aelig;sars or emperors. This Sibylline writer, as well as Suetonius, the Roman historian, begins the list {footnote p. 113} with Julius C&aelig;sar, who is designated by the numerical value of the initial letters of his name. The Greek letter Kappa (K) stands for twenty, and Iota (I) stands for ten.]</P>

<P>In wars exceeding powerful shall he be;<BR>
And he shall have the initial sign of ten;<BR>
20 And in like manner after him to reign<BR>
Is one who has the alphabet's first letter;<BR>
Before him Thrace and Sicily shall crouch,<BR>
Then Memphis, Memphis cast headlong to earth<BR>
By reason of the cowardice of rulers<BR>
25 And of a woman unenslaved who falls<BR>
Upon the wave. And laws will he ordain<BR>
For peoples and put all things under him;<BR>
But after a long time shall he transmit<BR>
His power unto another, who shall have<BR>
30 Three hundred for his first initial sign,<BR>
And of a river the beloved name,<BR>
And the Persians he shall rule and Babylon;<BR>
And then shall he smite Medians with his spear.<BR>
Then shall one rule who has the initial sign<BR>
35 Of the number three. And then shall be a lord<BR>
Who shall for first initial have twice ten;<BR>
And he shall come to Ocean's utmost water<BR>
And by Ausonia cleave the refluent tide.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[21. <I>First letter</I>.--Alpha, initial of Augustus.</P>
<P>25. <I>Woman</I>.--Allusion to Cleopatra of Egypt. Her falling upon the wave is ambiguous, and probably the text is an error. In the parallel in book xii, 29, the reading is <I>under the spear</I>.</P>
<P>30. <I>Three hundred</I>.--Represented by the letter T, the initial of Tiberius, as well as of the river Tiber.</P>
<P>35. <I>Three</I>.--The letter {Greek <I>G</I>}, Greek initial of Caius (Gaios) C&aelig;sar, commonly known as Caligula.</P>
<P>36. <I>Twice ten</I>.--As in line 16, but here designating Claudius (Greek, <I>Klaudios</I>).]</P>

<P>And one whose mark is fifty shall be lord,<BR>
40 A dreadful serpent breathing grievous war,<BR>
Who sometime stretching forth his hands shall make<BR>
An end of his own race and stir all things,<BR>
Acting the athlete, driving chariots,<BR>
Putting to death and daring countless things;<BR>
45 And he shall cleave the mountain of two seas<BR>
And sprinkle it with gore; but out of sight<BR>
Shall also vanish the destructive man;<BR>
Then, making himself equal unto God,<BR>
Shall he return; but God will prove him naught.<BR>
50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after him shall three kings be destroyed<BR>
By one another. Then a great destroyer<BR>
Of pious men shall come, whom seven times ten<BR>
Shall point out clearly. But from him a son,<BR>
Whom the first letter of three hundred proves,<BR>
55 Shall take the power. And after him shall be<BR>
A ruler, of the initial sign of four,<BR>
A life-destroyer. Then a reverend man<BR>
Of the number fifty. Next, succeeding him<BR>
Who has the first mark of the initial sign<BR>
60 Three hundred, shall a Celtic mountaineer,<BR>
Into the strife of battle pressing on,</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[39. <I>Fifty</I>.--The letter N, here denoting Nero, and Nerva in line 58.</P>
<P>45. <I>Mountain of two seas</I>.--Isthmus of Corinth, which Nero attempted to open to the two adjoining bodies of water.</P>
<P>50. <I>Three kings</I>.--Galba, Otho, and Vitellius.</P>
<P>52. <I>Seven times ten</I>.--This number is denoted by the Greek {Greek O}, initial of the Greek form of the name of Vespasian ({Greek <I>Ou?espasiano's</I>}).</P>
<P>54. <I>Three hundred</I>.--Here denoting Titus.</P>
<P>56. <I>Four</I>.--The letter A, initial of Domitian.</P>
<P>60. Three hundred.--Here denoting Trajan, who was of Spanish origin, and so reckoned by the Sibyl as a "Celtic mountaineer," not accurately, but in a loose, general way as a Western.]</P>

<P>Escape not fate unseemly, but shall be<BR>
Worn weary unto death; him foreign dust,<BR>
But dust that of Nemea's flower has name,<BR>
65 Shall hide a corpse. And after him shall rule<BR>
Another man, with silver helmet decked;<BR>
And unto him shall be the name of a sea;<BR>
And he shall be a man the best of all<BR>
And in all things discreet. And upon thee,<BR>
70 Thou best of all, above all, dark-haired one,<BR>
And upon thy shoots shall be all these days.<BR>
After him three shall rule; but the third one<BR>
Shall at a late time hold the royal power.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worn out am I, thrice-miserable one,<BR>
75 Sister of Isis, to lay up in heart<BR>
An evil message, and an inspired song<BR>
Of oracles. First M&aelig;nades shall dart</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[64. <I>Nemea's flower</I>.--Nemea in Argolis was the spot where biennial games were celebrated by the Greeks, and the victors were crowned with parsley, the Greek name of which is <I>selinon</I>. The emperor Trajan died in Selinus, a city of Cilicia, in Asia Minor; hence the allusion of the Sibyl.</P>
<P>67. <I>Name of a sea</I>.--The Adriatic (or Hadriatic), from which it is apparent Hadrian is referred to.</P>
<P>72. <I>Three</I>.--The three Antonines, namely, Antonius Pius, M. Aurelius, and I.. Verus. This last named, being only seven years old at the time of his adoption, was thought by the Sibyl to be likely to come late to the throne. Comp. book viii, 85.</P>
<P>75. <I>Sister of Isis</I>.--The Sibyl, who elsewhere (book iii, 1028) represents herself as a daughter-in-law of Noah, here assumes to be sister or friend ({Greek <I>gnwsth'</I>}) of the Egyptian goddess Isis, sadly prophesying the doom of Egypt, and especially of Memphis.</P>
<P>77. <I>First</I>.--Lactantius seems to have had this passage in mind when he says: "First of all, Egypt shall stiffer punishment for her foolish superstitions, and will be covered with blood as if with a river." <I>Div. Inst.</I>, vii, 15 [L., 6, 786]. <I>M&aelig;nades</I>.--A name applied to the priestesses of Bacchus, who were wont to work themselves into mad frenzy, and are here named as avenging furies, fit to execute judgment. Comp. line 651.]</P>

<P>Around thy much-lamented temple's steps,<BR>
And thou shalt be in evil hands that day<BR>
80 When the Nile some time shall fill the whole land<BR>
Of Egypt even to sixteen cubits deep;<BR>
It shall wash all the land, and water it<BR>
For mortals; and the pleasure of the land<BR>
Shall be still and the glory of her face.<BR>
85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memphis, thou most shalt over Egypt wail;<BR>
For of old ruling mightily the land<BR>
Thou shalt become poor, so that out of heaven<BR>
The Thunderer shall himself with great voice cry:<BR>
"O mighty Memphis, who didst boast of old<BR>
90 O'er craven mortals greatly, thou shalt wail<BR>
Full of pain and all-hapless, so that thou<BR>
Thyself shalt the eternal God perceive<BR>
Immortal in the clouds. Where among men<BR>
Is now thy mighty pride? Because thou didst<BR>
95 Against my God-anointed children rave,<BR>
And didst urge evil forward on good men,<BR>
Thou shalt for such things suffer penalty<BR>
In some like manner. No more openly<BR>
For thee shall there be right among the blessed;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[78. <I>Thy much-lamented temple</I>. The temple of Isis is referred to.</P>
<P>79. <I>Evil hands</I>. Allusion perhaps to the tearing in pieces of Pentheus by the hands of his mother and aunts, to whom Bacchus made him appear as a wild beast.</P>
<P>81. <I>Sixteen cubits</I>.--The elevation of the Nile, in the vicinity of Memphis, is about twenty-three feet, according to Humboldt, which would be equivalent to the ordinary estimate of sixteen cubits. It is interesting to note that the famous piece of statuary in the Vatican, representing the Nile as a reclining human figure, has the childlike forms of sixteen genii climbing about it, as if to represent the sixteen cubits of the usual annual overflow.</P>
<P>85. <I>Memphis</I>.--Ancient capital of lower Egypt. Comp. line 243.</P>
<P>95. <I>God-anointed children</I>.--The Jewish people. Comp. Psa. cv, 16; Hub. iii, 13.]</P>

<P>100 Fallen from the stars, thou shalt not rise to heaven."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these things unto Egypt God bade me<BR>
Speak out for the last time, when men shall be<BR>
Utterly evil. But they labor hard,<BR>
Evil men evil things awaiting, wrath<BR>
105 Of the immortal Thunderer in heaven,<BR>
Worshiping stones and beasts instead of God,<BR>
And also fearing many things besides<BR>
Which have no speech, nor mind, nor power to hear;<BR>
Which things it is not right for me to mention,<BR>
110 Each one an idol, formed by mortal hands;<BR>
Of their own labors and presumptuous thoughts<BR>
Did men receive gods made of wood and stone<BR>
And brass, and gold and silver, foolish too,<BR>
Without life and dumb, molten in the fire<BR>
115 They made them, vainly trusting such things. . . .<BR>
Thmois and Xois are in sore distress,<BR>
And smitten is the hall of Heracles<BR>
And Zeus and Hermes (king). And as for thee,<BR>
O Alexandria, famed nourisher<BR>
120 (Of cities) war shall not leave, nor (plague) . . .<BR>

As thou before didst. Silent shalt thou be<BR>

<P>12 5 For there shall come a Persian on thy dale,<BR>
And like hail shall he all the land destroy,<BR>
And artful men, with blood and corpses. . . .<BR>
By sacred altars one of barbarous mind,<BR>
Strong, full of blood and raging senselessly,<BR>
130 With countless numbers rushing to destruction.<BR>
And then shalt thou, in cities very rich,<BR>
Be very weary. Falling on the earth<BR>
All Asia shall wail on account of gifts<BR>
Crowning her head with which she was by thee<BR>
135 Delighted. But, as he himself obtained<BR>
The Persian land by lot, he shall make war<BR>
And killing every man destroy all life,<BR>
So that there shall remain for wretched mortals<BR>
A third part. But with nimble leap shall he<BR>
140 Himself speed from the West, and all the land<BR>
Besiege and waste. But when he shall possess<BR>
The height of power and odious reverence,<BR>
He shall come, wishing to destroy the city<BR>
Even of the blessed. And a certain king<BR>
145 Sent forth from God against him shall destroy<BR>
All mighty kings and bravest men. And thus<BR>
Shall judgement by the Immortal come to men.<BR>
Alas, alas for thee, unhappy heart!<BR>
Why dost thou move me to declare these things,<BR>

And Pitane among men shall appear<BR>
All-desolate. All Lesbos shall sink deep<BR>
Into the deep, and thus shall be destroyed.<BR>
Smyrna, whirled down her cliffs, shall wail aloud,<BR>

Shall perish utterly. Bithynians<BR>

And o'er Phœnicia that bas many tribes.<BR>
170 Alas, alas for thee, O Lycia;<BR>
How many evils does the sea contrive<BR>
Against thee, mounting up of its own will<BR>

<P>Because of whom thou hast suffered baneful things;<BR>
And thou shalt give instead of crooked words<BR>
600 Bitter vexation to the enemies,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the last time shall the sea be dry<BR>
And ships no longer sail to Italy,<BR>
And Asia the great then, all-hapless, shall<BR>
Be water, and then Crete shall be a plain.<BR>
605 And Cyprus shall endure great misery<BR>
And Paphos shall bewail a dreadful fate,<BR>
So that even Salamis, great city, shall<BR>
Be seen to undergo great misery;<BR>
And now the dry land shall be fruitless sand<BR>
610 Upon the shore. And locusts not a few<BR>
Shall utterly destroy the Cyprian land.<BR>
Looking at Tyre, doomed mortals, ye shall weep.<BR>
Phœnicia, dreadful wrath remains for thee,<BR>
Until thou to a worthless ruin fall,<BR>
615 So that even Sirens truly may lament.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fifth generation, when the ruin<BR>
Of Egypt has ceased, it shall come to pass<BR>
That shameless kings shall be together joined,<BR>
And races of Pamphylians shall encamp<BR>
620 In Egypt, and in Macedonia<BR>
And in Asia and among the Libyans<BR>
Shall in the dust be a world-maddening war<BR>
Exceeding bloody, which the king of Rome<BR>
And rulers of the West shall make to cease.<BR>
625&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wintry storm shall drop down like the snow,<BR>
While frozen are great river and vast lakes,<BR>
Forthwith a barbarous race shall make their way</P>

The race of dreadful Thracians, hard to quell.<BR>

Devour their parents, being by hunger worn,<BR>
And shall gulp down the entrails. And wild beasts<BR>
Shall devour from all houses table-food,<BR>
And they and birds all mortals shall devour.<BR>
635 The ocean with dead bodies shall be filled<BR>
From the river and be red with flesh and blood<BR>
Of the foolish ones. Then thus a feebleness<BR>
Shall be on earth, so that of men the number<BR>
May be seen and the measure of the women,<BR>
640&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dire race shall wail for myriad things<BR>
At last when the sun sets to rise no more,<BR>
But to remain submerged in Ocean's waves;<BR>
For it beheld the wickedness unclean<BR>
Of many mortals. And a moonless night<BR>
615 Shall be a fame around the mighty heaven,<BR>
And no small mist shall hide the world's ravines<BR>
A second time; then afterwards God's light<BR>

Remembrance of thee over all the earth.<BR>

Imperishable reason in their breast,<BR>

A priest, say: "Come, let us raise up of God<BR>

The fearful law of our forefathers change,<BR>
665 Because of which they did not understand<BR>
That they were unto gods of stone and clay<BR>
Making processions and religions rites.<BR>
Let us turn our souls, giving praise to God<BR>
The imperishable, who himself is Father,<BR>
670 The everlasting One, the Lord of all,<BR>
The true One, the King, life-sustaining Father,<BR>
The mighty God existing evermore."<BR>
And then shall there a great pure temple be<BR>
In Egypt, and the people made by God<BR>
675 Shall into it their sacrifices bring.<BR>
And to them God shall give life incorrupt.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[673. <I>Temple</I>.--Commonly supposed to refer to the Jewish temple at Leontopolis in Egypt. See Josephus, <I>Wars</I>, vii, x, 2, 3; <I>Ant.</I>, xiii, 3. Alexandre, however, controverts this explanation, and maintains that this writer, being subsequent to the closing of the temple at Leontopolis and the abolishing of its worship by order of the Roman emperor (Josephus, <I>Wars</I>, vii, x, 4), could not have thus spoken of this temple, nor prophesied its overthrow by Ethiopians. Hence the plausible supposition that the entire passage about a temple in Egypt is a poetical amplification of the prophecy of Isa. xix, 18-22.</P>
<P>678. <I>Triballians</I>.--These were a powerful and savage tribe near the Danube in Europe (comp. book xii, 91), and are here strangely associated with the Ethiopians. But probably both names are here used symbolically, like Gog and Magog in book iii, 193.]</P>

The mighty temple of the Egyptian land;<BR>
And God shall rain down on the earth dire wrath<BR>
Among them, so that all the wicked ones<BR>
685 And all without sense perish. And no more<BR>
Shall there be any sparing in that land,<BR>
Because they did not keep that which God gave.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the threatening of the shining Sun<BR>
Among the stars, and in the lightning flash<BR>
690 The dire wrath of the Moon; the stars travailed<BR>
With battle; and God gave them up to light.<BR>
For long fire-flames rebelled against the Sun;<BR>
Lucifer treading upon Leo's back<BR>
Began the fight; and the Moon's double horn<BR>
695 Changed its shape; Capricorn smote Taurus' neck;<BR>
And Taurus took away from Capricorn<BR>
Returning day. Orion would no more<BR>
Abide his yoke; the lot of Gemini<BR>
Did Virgo change in Aries; no more shone<BR>
700 The Pleiads; Draco disavowed his zone;<BR>
Down into Leo's girdle Pisces went.<BR>
Cancer remained not, for he feared Orion;<BR>
Scorpio down on dire Leo backwards moved;<BR>
And from the Sun's flame Sirius slipped away;<BR>
705 And the strength of the mighty Shining One<BR>
Aquarius kindled. Uranus himself<BR>
Was roused, until he shook the warring ones;<BR>
And being incensed he hurled them down on earth.<BR>
Then swiftly smitten down upon the baths<BR>
710 Of Ocean they set all the earth on fire;<BR>
And the high heaven remained without a star.</P>
