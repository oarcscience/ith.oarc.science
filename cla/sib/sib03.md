## THE SIBYLLINE ORACLES.

### BOOK I.

BEGINNING with the generation first  
Of mortal men down to the very last  
I'll prophesy each thing: what erst has been,  
And what is now, and what shall yet befall  
5 The world through the impiety of men.  
    First now God urges on me to relate  
Truly how into being came the world.  
And thou, shrewd mortal, prudently make known,  
Lest ever thou should'st my commands neglect,  
10 The King most high, who brought into existence  
The whole world, saying, "Let there be," and there was.  
For he the earth established, placing it  
Round about Tartarus, and he himself

\[1. This book appears to be one of the latest in composition of this
entire collection of oracles, but it was placed first on account of its
contents, which relate to the creation and the earliest races of
mankind. It is evidently of Christian origin, and was written probably
as late as the third century.

13\. *Tartartus*, the prison of the Titans, is here conceived as
encompassed by the earth and forming its interior. Hesiod (*Theog.*,
720, *ff*) represents it as surrounded by a brazen fence and situated as
far beneath the earth as earth is beneath the heaven; it would require
nine days and nights, he says, for an anvil to fall from heaven to
earth, and as many more for it to fall from earth to Tartarus. Comp.
Homer, *Il*., viii, 13-16. Verg., *Æn*., vi, 577-581. It will be seen in
line 127 and elsewhere that Gehenna is regarded as a part of Tartarus or
identical with it, while Hades (line 106) comprehends the abode of all
the dead.\]

Gave the sweet light; he raised the heaven on high,  
15 Spread out the gleaming sea, and crowned the sky  
With an abundance of bright-shining stars,  
And decked the earth with plants, and mingled sea  
With rivers, and the air with zephyrs mixed  
And watery clouds; and then, another race  
20 Appointing, he gave fishes to the seas  
And birds unto the winds, and to the woods  
The beasts of shaggy neck, and snakes that crawl,  
And all things which now on the earth appear.  
These by his word he made, and every thing  
25 Was speedily and with precision done;  
For he was self-caused and from heaven looked down  
And finished was the world exceeding well.  
And then thereafter fashioned he again  
A living product, copying a new man  
30 From his own image, beautiful, divine,  
And bade him in ambrosial garden dwell,  
That labors beautiful might be his care.  
But in that fertile field of Paradise  
He longed for conversation, being alone,  
35 And prayed that he might see another form  
Such as he had. And forthwith, from man's side  
Taking a bone, God himself made fair Eve,  
A wedded spouse, and in that Paradise  
Gave her to dwell with him. And, when he gazed  
40 Upon her, on a sudden filled with joy  
Great admiration held his soul, he saw  
A pattern so exact; and with wise words  
Spontaneous flowing answered he in turn  
For God had care for all things. For the mind  
45 They darkened not with passion, nor concealed  
Their nakedness, but with hearts far from evil

(11-36.)

{p. 17}

Even like wild beasts they walked with limbs exposed.  
And afterwards delivering them commands  
God showed them not to touch a certain tree;  
50 But the dread serpent drew them off by guile  
To go away unto the fate of death  
And to gain knowledge of both good and evil.  
But the wife then first traitress proved to God;  
She gave, and urged the unknowing man to sin.  
55 And he, persuaded by the woman's words,  
Forgot the immortal Maker utterly,  
And treated plain commandments with neglect.  
Therefore, instead of good, received they evil  
According to their deed. And then the leaves  
60 Of the sweet fig-tree piercing they made clothes  
And put them on each other, and concealed  
The sexual parts, because they were ashamed.  
But on them the Immortal set his wrath  
And cast them out of the immortal land.  
65 For their abiding now in mortal land  
Was brought to pass, since hearing they kept not  
The word of the immortal mighty God.  
And straightway they, upon the fruitful soil  
Forthgoing, with their tears and groans were wet;  
70 And to them then the immortal God himself  
A word more excellent spoke: "Multiply,  
Increase, work constantly upon the earth,  
That with the sweat of labor ye may have  
Sufficient food." Thus he spoke; and he made  
75 The author of deceit to press the ground  
On belly and on side, a crawling snake,  
Driving him out severely; and he sent  
Dire enmity between them and the one

{p. 18}

Is on the look-out to preserve his head,  
80 But man his heel; for death is neighbor near  
Of evil-plotting vipers and of men.  
    And then indeed the race was multiplied  
As the Almighty himself gave command,  
And there grew up one people on another  
85 Innumerable. And houses they adorned  
Of all kinds and made cities and their walls  
Well and expertly; and to them was given  
A day of long time for a life much-loved;  
For they did not worn out with troubles die,  
90 But as subdued by sleep; most happy men  
Of great heart, whom the immortal Saviour loved,  
The King, God. But they also did transgress,  
Smitten with folly. For with impudence  
They mocked their fathers and their mothers scorned;  
95 Kinsmen they knew not, and they formed intrigues  
Against their brothers. And they were impure,  
Having defiled themselves with human gore,  
And they made wars. And then upon them came  
The last calamity sent forth from heaven,  
100 Which snatched the dreadful men away from life;  
And Hades then received them; it was called  
Hades since Adam, having tasted death,  
Went first and earth encompassed him around.  
And therefore all men born upon the earth  
105 Are in abodes of Hades called to go.

\[88. *Day of long time*.--Allusion to the remark the patriarchs as
recorded in Gen. v.

102\. *Hades*.--The conception of Hades here set forth, as the great
receptacle of the souls of men after death, is in essential harmony with
both the Jewish and the Christian doctrines. The derivation of the name
from Adam is noticeable as a purely arbitrary conjecture. Comp. book
iii, 30, note; comp. Plato's explanation of the word in Cratylus, 404.\]

(62-84.)

{p. 19}

But even in Hades all these when they came  
Had honor, since they were the earliest race.  
    But when Hades received these, secondly  
\[Of the surviving and most righteous men\]  
110 God formed another very subtile race  
That cared for lovely works, and noble toils,  
Distinguished reverence and solid wisdom;  
And they were trained in arts of every kind,  
Finding inventions by their lack of means.  
115 And one devised to till the land with plows,  
Another worked in wood, another cared  
For sailing, and another watched the stars  
And practiced augury with winged fowls;  
And use of drugs had interest for one,  
120 While for another magic had a charm;  
And others were in every other art  
Which men care for instructed, wide awake,  
Industrious, worthy of that eponym  
Because they had a sleepless mind within  
125 And a huge body; stout with mighty form  
They were; but, notwithstanding, down they went  
Into Tartarean chamber terrible,  
Kept in firm chains to pay full penalty  
In Gehenna of strong, furious, quenchless fire.  
130    And after these a third strong-minded race  
Appeared, a race of overbearing men  
And terrible, who wrought among themselves

\[109. Lines thus inclosed in brackets are believed to be spurious
interpolations, but have too much MS. authority to be omitted from the
text.

130\. *Third strong-minded race*.--The successive races here mentioned
appear to be in imitation of Hesiod's ages or races of mankind. Hesiod
applies to them the epithets of golden, silver, bronze, and iron. See
*Works and Days*, 108-190, and comp. Aratus, *Phænom*., 100-134; Ovid,
*Met*., i. 89-150; Juvenal, *Sat*., xiii, 27-30.\]

{p. 20}

Many an evil. And fights, homicides,  
And battles did continually destroy  
135 Those men possessed of overweening heart,  
    And from these afterward another race  
Proceeded, late-completed, youngest born,  
Blood-stained, perverse in counsel; of men these  
Were in the fourth race; much the blood they spilled,  
140 Nor feared they God nor had regard for men,  
For maddening wrath and sore impiety  
Were sent upon them. And wars, homicides,  
And battles sent some into Erebus,  
Since they were overweening impious men.  
145 But the rest did the heavenly God himself  
In anger afterwards change from his world,  
Casting them into mighty Tartarus  
Down under the foundation of the earth.  
And later yet another race much worse  
150 \[Of men he made, to whom no good thereafter\]  
The Immortal formed, since they wrought many evils.  
For they were much more violent than those,  
Giants perverse, foul language pouring out.  
Single among all men, most just and true,  
155 Was the most faithful Noah, full of care  
For noblest works. And to him God himself  
From heaven thus spoke: "Noah, be of good cheer  
In thyself and to all the people preach  
Repentance, so that they may all be saved.  
160 But if, with shameless soul, they heed me not  
The whole race I will utterly destroy

\[143. *Erebus* appears to be here employed merely as another name for
the underworld, and interchangeable with Hades. Comp. Homer, *Il*.,
viii. 368. Tartarus is conceived as a still lower deep.

{p. 21}

With mighty floods of waters. Quickly now  
An undecaying house I bid thee frame  
Of planks strong and impervious to the wet.  
165 I will put understanding in thy heart,  
And subtile skill, and rule of measurement  
And order; and for all things will I care  
That thou be saved, and all who dwell with thee.  
And I am He who is, and in thy heart  
170 Do thou discern. I clothe me with the heaven,  
And cast the sea around me, and for me  
Earth is a footstool, and the air is poured  
Around my body; and on every side  
Around me runs the chorus of the stars.  
175 Nine letters have I; of four syllables  
I am; discern me. The first three have each  
Two letters, the remaining one the rest,  
And five are mates; and of the entire sum  
The hundreds are twice eight and thrice three tens  
180 Along with seven. Now, knowing who I am,

\[175. *Nine letters*.--The connection shows that the name intended must
be some title or designation of the Creator, but no word has been
discovered that fully meets the conditions of the puzzle. The nearest
solution is found in the word {Greek *?ane'kfwnows*}. This word has nine
letters, four syllables, and five mutes, or consonants. The first three
syllables have two letters each, and the sum of all the letters taken at
their numerical value is 1,696. But the number stated in the text is
twice 800, plus three times thirty (= 90) and seven = 1,697. {Greek
*?ane'kfwnows*} must also be supposed to be a shortened form for {Greek
*?anekfw'nhtos*}, used in ecclesiastical Greek writers to denote the
unutterable name, Jehovah. Another name proposed is {Greek *Ðeo\`s
Swth'r*}, but an obvious objection is that we have here two words, not,
as the text suggests, one word of four syllables. Besides, these letters
amount to only 1,692. There is, perhaps, an error in the text. If for
the words with seven (line 180) we read with two, the numerical
difficulty of the last-named solution would be met; or if we read with
six, then the word {Greek *?ane'kfwnos*} solves the problem. Comp. the
similar puzzle in lines 395-399 of this same book, and the well-known
{footnote p. 22} enigma of the number of the beast in Rev. xiii, 18. A
like example is also found in Capella (book ii, 193), who thus addresses
the sun: "Hail, thou veritable face and paternal countenance of God,
eight and six hundred in number, whose first letter forms a sacred name,
a surname, and a sign;" which Kopp explains by the letters {Greek *frh*}
(= 608), representative of the Egyptian name of the sun. Comp. also the
designation of the Roman emperors in book v, 16, and following.\]

{p. 22}

Be thou not uninitiate in my lore."  
    Thus he spoke; and great trembling seized on him  
At what he heard. And then, within his mind  
Having contrived each matter, he besought  
185 The people and began with words like these:  
"O men insatiate, smit with madness great,  
Whatever things ye practiced they shall not  
Escape God's notice; for he knows all things,  
Immortal Saviour overseeing all,  
190 Who bade me warn you, that ye perish not.  
Be sober, cut off badness, do not fight  
Perforce each other with blood-guilty heart,  
Nor irrigate much land with human gore.  
Revere, O mortals, the supremely great  
195 And fearless heavenly Creator, God  
Imperishable, whose dwelling is the sky;  
And do ye all entreat him--he is kind--  
For life of cities and of all the world,  
And of four-footed beasts and flying fowls;  
200 Entreat him to be gracious unto all.  
For when the whole unbounded world of men  
Shall be destroyed by waters loud ye'll raise

\[184. *Besought the people*.--The O. T. narrative of the flood records
nothing of Noah's preaching, but in 2 Pet. ii he is called a "preacher
of righteousness" (comp. 1 Pet. iii, 20), and Josephus (*Ant.*, i, iii,
1) confirms this tradition of the Jews. Comp. also Theophilus, *ad
Autol*., iii, 19 \[G., 61 1.145\].\]

{p. 23}

A fearful cry. And suddenly for you  
The air shall be disordered, and from heaven  
205 The fury of the mighty God shall come  
Upon you. And it certainly shall be  
That the immortal Saviour against men  
Will send wrath if ye do not placate God  
And from this time repent; and nothing more  
210 Fretful and evil lawlessly shall ye  
One to another do, but let there be  
A guarding of one's self by holy life."  
    But when they heard him each turned up his nose,  
Calling him mad, a frenzy-smitten man.  
215 And then again did Noah sound this strain:  
"O men exceeding wretched, base in heart,  
Unstable, leaving modesty behind  
And loving shamelessness, rapacious lords,  
Fierce sinners, false, insatiate, mischievous,  
220 In nothing true, stealthy adulterers,  
Flippant in language, pouring forth foul words,  
The wrath of God most high not fearing, kept  
To the fifth generation to atone!  
In no way do ye wail, harsh men, but laugh;  
225 Sardonic smile shall ye laugh, when shall come  
That which I speak--God's dire incoming flood,  
When Eve's polluted race, in the great earth  
Blooming perennial in impervious stem,  
Shall, root and branch, in one night disappear,  
230 And cities, men and all, shall the Earth-shaker

Sardinian plant so bitter as to cause the face of the cater to writhe in
pain, though he might attempt to laugh. Comp. Hom. *Od.*, xx, 302.

the god of the sea, here evidently applied to the God of Noah.\]

(164-187.)

{p. 24}

From the depths scatter and their walls destroy.  
And then the whole world of unnumbered men  
Shall die. But how shall I weep, how lament  
In wooden house, how mingle tears with waves?  
235 For, if this water bidden of God shall come,  
Earth shall float, hills float, and even sky shall float;  
Everything shall be water, and all things  
Shall be destroyed by waters. And the winds  
Shall stand still, and a second age shall come.  
240 O Phrygia, thou shalt from the water's crest  
First rise up, and thou first another race  
Of men shalt nourish, once again anew  
Beginning; and thou shalt be nurse for all."  
    But when now to the lawless generation  
245 He had thus vainly spoken, the Most High  
Appeared, and once more cried aloud and said:  
"The time is now come, Noah, to proclaim  
Each thing, even all which I that day to thee  
Did promise and confirm, and to complete,  
250 Because of a people disobedient,  
Throughout the boundless world even all the things  
Which generations of a former time  
Did practice, evil things innumerable.  
But do thou quickly enter with thy sons  
255 And the wives. Call as many as I bid,  
Of tribes of beasts and creeping things and birds,  
And in as many as I ordain for life  
Will I then put a willingness to go."  
    Thus spoke he; forth went (Noah) and aloud  
260 Cried out and called. And then wife, sons and brides,  
Entered the house of wood; then also went

\[240. *Phrygia . . . first*.--Comp. the statement of Herodotus (ii, 2),
that the Phrygians were the most ancient of mankind.\]

(188-212.)

{p. 25}

The other things, as many as God willed  
To shut in. But when fitting bolt was put  
About the lid, and in its polished place  
265 Was fitted sideways, then was brought to pass  
Forthwith the purpose of the God of heaven.  
And he massed clouds, and bid the sun's bright disk,  
And moon, and stars, and circle of the heaven,  
Obscuring all things round; he thundered loud,  
270 Terror of mortals, sending lightnings forth;  
And all the winds together were aroused,  
And all the veins of water were unloosed  
By opening of great cataracts from heaven,  
And from earth's caverns and the tireless deep  
275 Appeared the myriad waters, and the whole  
Illimitable earth was covered o'er.  
But on the water swam that wondrous house;  
And torn by many furious waves, and struck  
By force of winds, it rushed on fearfully;  
280 But with its keel it cut the mass of foam  
While the loud-babbling waters dashed around.  
    But when God deluged all the world with rains  
Then also Noah took thought to observe  
By counsels of the Immortal; for he now  
285 Had had enough of Nereus. And straightway  
The house he opened from the polished wall,  
That crosswise was bound fast with skillful stays.  
And looking out upon the mighty mass  
Of boundless waters Noah on all sides--

\[285. *Nereus*.--A sea god supposed to dwell in the bottom of the
ocean, and called in Homer (*Il.* i, 556) the "old man of the sea." His
daughters were called Nereids. Nereus is here put by metonymy for the
sea itself, and the Sibyl means to say that Noah had been long enough in
the water.\]

(218-235.)

{p. 26}

290 And 'twas his fortune with his eyes to see!--  
Fear possessed and shook mightily his heart.  
And then the air became a little calm,  
Since it was weary wetting all the world  
Many days; parting, then, it brought to light  
295 How pale and blood-red was the mighty sky  
And sun's bright disk awearied; scarcely held  
Noah his courage. And then forth afar  
Sent he a dove alone, that he might learn  
If yet firm land appeared. But with tired wing,  
300 Flying round all things, she again returned;  
For not yet had the water ebbed away;  
For it was deeply filling every place.  
But after resting quietly for days  
He sent the dove once more, to learn if yet  
305 Had ceased the many waters. And she flew  
And flew on, and went o'er the earth and, resting  
Her body lightly on the humid ground,  
Again to Noah back she came and bore  
An olive branch--of tidings a great sign.  
310 Courage now filled them all, and great delight,  
Because they hoped to look upon the land.  
But then thereafter yet another bird,  
Of black wing, sent he forth as hastily;  
Which, trusting to its wings, flow willingly,  
315 And coming to the land continued there.  
And Noah knew the land was nearer now.  
But when on dashing waves the craft divine  
Had here and there o'er ocean's billows swum,  
It was made fast upon the narrow strand.  
320 There is in Phrygia on the dark mainland

\[290. An aposiopesis. The poet is so appalled at the thought of what
Noah saw that she leaves her sentence unfinished.\]

(236-261.)

{p. 27}

A steep, tall mountain; Ararat its name,  
Because upon it all were to be saved  
From death, and there was great desire of heart;  
Thence streams of the great river Marsyas spring.  
325 There on a lofty peak the ark abode  
When the waters ceased, and then again from heaven  
The voice divine of the great God this word  
Proclaimed: "O Noah, guarded, faithful, just,  
Come boldly forth, with thy sons and thy wife  
330 And the three brides, and fill ye all the earth,  
Increasing, multiplying, rendering justice  
To one another through all generations,  
Until to judgment every race of men  
Shall come; for judgment shall be unto all."  
335 Thus spoke the voice divine. Then from his couch  
Noah, encouraged, hastened on the land,  
And with him went his sons and wife and brides,  
And creeping things, and birds and quadrupeds,  
And all things else went from the wooden house  
340 Into one place. And then went Noah forth  
As eighth, most just of men, when on the waters  
He had made full twice twenty days and one  
Because of counsels of the mighty God.  
Then a new stock of life again arose,  
345 Golden first, which indeed was sixth, and best,

From the time when the first-formed man appeared;  
Heavenly its name, because all things to God  
Shall be a care. O first race of sixth age!  
O mighty joy which I thereafter shared,  
350 When I escaped sheer ruin, by the waves  
Much tossed, with husband and with brothers-in-law,  
Stepfather and stepmother, and with wives  
Of husband's brothers suffering terribly.  
Fitting things now will I sing: There shall be  
355 On the fig-tree a many-colored flower,  
And afterward the royal power and sway  
Shall Cronos have. For three kings of great soul,  
Men most just, shall distribute portions then,  
And many a year rule, rendering what is just  
360 To men who care for toil and deeds of love.  
And earth shall glory in her many fruits  
Self-growing, yielding much corn for the race.  
And the foster-fathers, ageless all their days,  
Shall from diseases chill and dreadful be  
365 Far aloof; they shall die as fallen on sleep,  
And unto Acheron in the abodes  
Of Hades they shall go away, and there  
Shall they have honor, since they were a race

Of blessed ones, fortunate heroes, whom  
370 The Lord of Sabaoth gave a noble mind,  
And with whom always he his counsels shared.  
But blessed shall they be even when they go  
In Hades. And then afterward again  
Oppressive, strong, another second race  
375 Of earth-born men, the Titans. All excel  
In figure, stature, growth; and there shall be  
One language, as of old from the first race  
God in their breasts implanted. But even these,  
Having a haughty heart and rushing on  
380 To ruin, shall at last resolve to fight  
Against the starry heaven. And then the stream  
Of the great ocean shall upon them pour  
Its raging waters. But the mighty Lord  
Of Sabaoth though enraged shall check his wrath,  
385 Because he promised that again no flood  
Should be brought upon men of evil soul.  
    But when the great high-thundering God shall cause  
The boundless swelling of the many waters--  
With their waves hither and thither rising high--  
390 To cease from wrath, and into other depths  
Of sea their measure lessen, setting bounds  
By harbors and rough headlands round the land;  
Then also shall a child of the great God  
Come, clothed in flesh, to men, and fashioned like

by the Erythræan Sibyl, who says almost the same things, varying only in
a few unimportant details." *Div. Inst.*, i, xiv \[L., 6, 190\].\]

Four vowels, and two consonants in him  
Are twice announced; the whole sum I will name:  
For eight ones, and as many tens on these,  
And yet eight hundred will reveal the name  
400 To men insatiate; and do thou discern  
In thine own understanding that the Christ  
Is child of the immortal God most high.  
And he shall fulfill God's law, not destroy,  
Bearing his very image, and all things  
405 Shall he teach. Unto him shall priests convey  
And offer gold, and myrrh, and frankincense;  
For all these things he'll also bring to pass.  
But when a voice shall through the desert land  
Come bearing tidings to men, and to all  
410 Shall call to make straight paths, and from the heart  
Cast wickedness out and illuminate  
With water all the bodies of mankind,  
That being born again they may no more  
From what is righteous go at all astray--  
415 And one of barbarous mind, by dances bound,  
Cutting that (voice) off shall bestow reward--

contains four vowels and the consonant is twice told, and the numerical
value of all the letters is 888. Comp. line 175, and note.

411\. *Illuminate*.--An expression relating to Christian baptism quite
common with the early fathers, many of whom understood the word {Greek
*fwtis-ðe'nte's*} in Heb. vi, 4, as referring to baptism. Justin Martyr,
1 *Apol*., lxi \[G., 6, 421\], says: "This washing is called
illumination, inasmuch as those who learn these things have their
understanding illuminated." Cyril of Jerusalem wrote eighteen books of
religious instruction, which are entitled Catechesis of the Illuminated
\[G., 33, 369-1060\]. See also *Apost. Const.*, viii, 8. For other
references see Suicer, Thesaurus, under {Greek *fw'tisma*}.\]

Then on a sudden there shall be a sign  
To mortals, when, watched over, there shall come  
Out of the land of Egypt a fair stone;  
420 And on it shall the Hebrew people stumble;  
But by his guiding nations shall be brought  
Together; for the God who rules on high  
They also shall know through him, and the way  
In common light. For unto chosen men  
425 Will he show life eternal, but the fire  
Will be for ages on the lawless bring.  
And then shall he the sickly heal, and all  
Who are blameworthy who shall trust in him..  
And then the blind shall see, the lame shall walk,  
430 The deaf shall hearken, and the dumb shall speak.  
Demons shall he drive out, and of the dead  
There shall be an uprising; on the waves  
Shall he walk; also in a desert place  
Shall he five thousand satisfy with food  
435 From five loaves and a fish out of the sea,  
    And with the remnants of them, for the hope  
Of peoples, shall he fill twelve baskets full.  
And then shall Israel, drunken, not discern,  
Nor shall they hear, oppressed with feeble cars.  
440 But when the maddening wrath of the Most High  
Shall come upon the Hebrews, and take faith  
Away from them, because they slew the Son  
Of the heavenly God; then also with foul lips

Shall Israel give him cuffs and spittle drugged.  
445 And gall for food and vinegar unmixed  
For drink will they, with evil madness smitten  
In bosom and in heart, give impiously,  
Not seeing with their eyes, more blind than moles,  
More terrible than crawling poisonous beasts,  
450 Fast bound by heavy sleep. But when his hands  
He shall spread forth and measure out all things,  
And bear the crown of thorns, and they shall pierce  
His side with reeds, for which dark monstrous night  
Shall be for three hours in the midst of day,  
455 Then also shall the temple of Solomon  
Bring to an end a mighty sign for men,  
When he shall to the house of Hades go  
Proclaiming resurrection to the dead.  
But when in three days he shall come again  
460 Unto the light, and show his form to men  
And teach all things, ascending in the clouds  
Unto the house of heaven shall he go  
Leaving the world a Gospel convenant.  
And in his name shall blossom a new shoot  
465 From nations that are guided by the law  
Of the Mighty One. But also after this  
There shall be wise guides, and then afterward  
There shall be a cessation of the prophets.  
    After that, when the Hebrew people reap  
470 Their evil harvest, shall a Roman king  
Much gold and silver utterly destroy.  
And afterward shall other royal powers  
Continuously arise as kingdoms perish,

Rome.\]

And they will oppress mortals. But great fall  
475 Shall be for those men, when they shall begin  
Unrighteous arrogance. But when the temple  
Of Solomon in the holy land shall fall,  
Cast down by barbarous men in brazen mail,  
And from the land the Hebrews shall be driven  
480 Wandering and wasted, and among the wheat  
They shall much darnel mingle, there shall be  
Evil contention among, all mankind;  
And the cities suffering outrage shall bewail  
Each other, in their breasts receiving wrath  
485 Of the great God, since they wrought evil work.
