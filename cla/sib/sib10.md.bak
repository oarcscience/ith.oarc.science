### BOOK VIII.

GOD'S declarations of great wrath to come  
In the last age upon the faithless world  
I make known, prophesying to all men  
According to their cities. From the time  
5 When the great tower fell and the tongues of men  
Were parted into many languages  
Of mortals, first was Egypt's royal power  
Established, that of Persians and of Medes  
And also of the Ethiopians  
10 And of Assyria and Babylon,  
Then the great pride of boasting Macedon,  
Then, fifth, the famous lawless kingdom last  
Of the Italians shall show many evils  
Unto all mortals and shall spend the toils  
15 Of men of every land. And it shall lead  
The untamed kings of nations to the West,  
Make laws for peoples and subject all things.  
Late do the mills of God grind the fine flour.  
Fire then shall destroy all things and give back  
20 To fine dust the heads of the high-leafed hills

\[1. This eighth book is remarkably fragmentary, and touches on a wide
range of topics. It is obviously of Christian authorship, and contains
(lines 284-330) the famous Sibylline acrostic of the name of Jesus
Christ.

And of all flesh. First cause of ills to all  
Are covetousness and a lack of sense.  
For there shall be love of deceitful gold  
And silver; for than these did mortals choose  
15 Naught greater, neither light of sun nor heaven,  
Nor sea, nor broad-backed earth whence all things grow,  
Nor God who giveth all things, of all things  
The Father, nor yet faith and piety  
Chose they before them. Of impiety  
30 A fount, and of disorder forward guide,  
An instrument of wars and foe of peace  
Is lack of sense, that sets at enmity  
Parents and children. And along with gold  
Shall marriage not be honorable at all.  
35 And the land shall have its borders and each sea  
Its watchers craftily distributed  
To all those that have gold; for ages thus  
Shall those who purpose to possess the land  
That feedeth many plunder laboring men,  
40 In order that, procuring larger space,  
They may enslave them by a false pretense.  
And if the huge earth from the starry heaven  
Held not her throne far off there had not been  
For men an equal light, but, bought with gold,  
45 It had belonged to rich men and God must  
For poor men have prepared another world.  
    There shall come to thee sometime from above  
A heavenly stroke deserved, O haughty Rome.  
And thou shalt be the first to bend thy neck  
50 And be rased to the ground, and thee shall fire  
Destructive utterly consume, cast down  
Upon thy pavements, and thy wealth shall perish,

And wolves and foxes dwell in thy foundations.  
And then shalt thou be wholly desolate,  
55 As if not born. Where thy Palladium then?  
What god shall save thee, whether wrought of gold  
Or stone or brass? Or then where thy decrees  
Of senate? Where shall be the race of Rhea,  
Of Cronus, or of Zeus, and of all those  
60 Whom thou didst worship, demons without life,  
Images of the worn-out dead, whose tombs  
Crete the ill-starred shall hold a cause of pride,  
And honor the unconscious dead with thrones?  
    But when thou shalt have had voluptuous kings  
65 Thrice five, enslaving the world from the east  
Unto the west, there shall be then a lord  
Gray-headed, having name of the near sea,  
The world inspecting with a nimble foot,  
Bringing gifts, having large amount of gold  
70 And plundering hateful silver even more,  
And stripping it off he shall pick it up.  
And he shall have part in all mysteries  
Of Magian shrines, display his child as god,  
Abolish all things sacred, and disclose  
75 The ancient mysteries of deceit to all.  
Sad then the time when he himself, sad one,  
Shall perish. And yet shall the people say:  
"Thy mighty strength, O city, shall fall down,"  
At once perceiving that the evil day

80 Is coming on. And, thy most piteous fate  
Foreseeing, fathers and young children then  
Shall mourn together; they alas, alas! Shall wail  
Beside the Tiber's lamentable banks.  
    After him at the latest day of all  
85 Shall three rule, filling out a name of God  
The heavenly, of whom is the power both now  
And to all ages. One of them being old  
The scepter long shall wield, most piteous king,  
Who in his houses shall shut up and guard  
90 All the goods of the world, in order that,  
When from the utmost limits of the earth  
That man, the matricidal fugitive,  
Shall come again, he may bestow these things  
On all and furnish Asia with great wealth.  
95 And then shalt thou mourn and shalt put aside  
The luster of the broad-striped purple robe  
Of thy commanders and wear mourning dress,  
O haughty queen, off spring of Latin Rome;  
The glory of that arrogance of thine  
100 Shall be for thee no longer, nor shalt thou,  
Ill-fated, ever be raised up again,  
But shalt lie prostrate. For the glory also  
Of eagle-bearing legions shall fall low.  
Where then thy power? What allied land shall be  
105 Subjected by thy follies lawlessly?  
For then in all earth shall confusion be  
Of mortals, when the Almighty shall himself

To the tribunal come to judge the souls  
Of the living and the dead and all the world.  
110 And parents shall not be to children dear  
Nor children to their parents, on account  
Of their impiety and their distress  
Unlooked-for. Thine thenceforth shall gnashing be  
And scattering and conquest, and when the fall  
115 Of cities comes and yawnings of the earth.  
    When a dragon charged with fire in both his eyes  
And with full belly shall come on the waves  
And shall afflict thy children, and there be  
Famine and war of kinsmen, near at hand  
120 Is the end of the world and the last day  
And judgment of the immortal God for them  
That are approved and chosen. And there shall  
Against the Romans first of all be wrath  
Implacable, and there, come a time  
125 Of drinking blood and wretched course of life.  
Alas, alas for thee, thou reckless land,  
Great barbarous nation; thou didst not perceive  
Whence naked and unworthy thou didst come  
To the sun's light, that to that place again  
130 Naked thou mightest withdraw and afterwards  
Come unto judgment, as unjustly judging. . . .  
With hands gigantic coming from on high  
Alone through all the world thou, shalt abide  
Under the earth. By naphtha and asphalt  
135 And brimstone and much fire thou utterly  
Shalt disappear and shalt be burning dust  
For ages; and each one who sees shall hear  
From Hades a great mournful bellowing

associated in the thought of the writer with the end of the world.\]

And gnashing of teeth, and thee noisily  
140 Beating with thine own hands thy godless breast.  
For all together there is equal night;  
For rich and poor; and naked from the earth  
Naked again to earth they haste away  
And cease from life when they complete their time.  
145 No slave is there, nor any lord, nor tyrant,  
Nor king, nor leader having much conceit,  
Nor speaker learned in law, nor magistrate  
Judging for money; nor do they pour out  
The blood of sacrifices in libations  
150 Upon the altars; there sounds not a drum  
Nor cymbal. . . .  
Nor perforated flute that has a power  
To madden mind itself, nor sound of pipe  
That bean the likeness of a crooked snake,  
155 Nor trumpet, harsh-toned messenger of wars;  
Nor those made drunken in the lawless feasts  
Of revelry, nor in the choral dance;  
Nor sound of harp, nor harmful instrument;  
Nor strife, nor anger manifold, nor sword  
160 Is with the dead; but an eternity  
Common to all is keeper of the key  
Of the great prison before God's judgment-seat  
With images of gold and silver and stone  
Ye are ready, that unto the bitter day  
165 Ye may come to see your first punishment,  
O Rome, and gnashing of teeth. And no more  
Shall Syrian or Greek lay down his neck  
Beneath thy servile yoke, nor foreigner,

Nor other nation. Plundered thou shalt be  
170 And made to suffer what thou didst exact,  
And in fear wailing thou shalt give, until  
Thou pay back all things; and thou for the world  
Shalt be a triumph and reproach of all.  
    Then shall the sixth race of the Latin kings  
175 End life at last and scepters leave behind  
From the same race another king shall reign,  
Who shall rule every land and scepters wield;  
And having full power, and by the decrees  
Of God most mighty, shall his children rule,  
180 And of unshaken children is his race;  
For thus it is decreed while time moves round,  
When there shall be of Egypt thrice five kings.  
    Thereafter when the limit of the time  
Of the Phenix shall come round, there shall a race  
185 Of peoples come to plunder, tribes confused,  
Enemy of the Hebrews. Then shall Ares  
Go plundering Ares; and he shall himself  
Destroy the haughty threatening of the Romans.  
For Rome's power perished then while in its bloom;  
190 An ancient queen with cities dwelling round,  
No longer shall the land of fertile Rome  
Prevail, when out of Asia one shall come

To rule with Ares. And when he has wrought  
All these things, to the city afterwards  
195 Shall he come. And three times three hundred  
And eight and forty shalt thou make complete,  
When, taking thee by force, an ill-starred fate  
Shall come upon thee and complete thy name.  
    Ah me, I the thrice wretched, shall I see  
200 Sometime that day to thee destructive, Rome,  
But to all Latins most? It honors him  
With counsels who goes, up on Trojan car  
With hidden children from the Asian land,  
Having a fiery soul. But when he shall  
205 Cut through the isthmus looking wistfully,  
Moving against all, passing o'er the sea,  
Then shall dark blood pursue the mighty beast.  
And a dog chased the lion which destroys  
The shepherds. And then shall they take away  
210 His scepter and to Hades he shall pass.  
    And unto Rhodes shall come an evil last,  
But greatest, There shall also be for Thebes  
An evil conquest afterwards, And Egypt

Escaped headlong destruction afterwards,  
Thrice blessed was, even four times happy man.  
And Rome shall be a room, and Delos dull,  
And Samos sand. . . .  
220 Later again thereafter there shall come  
An evil to the Persians for their pride,  
And all their insolence shall come to naught.  
    And then a holy Lord of all the earth  
Having raised up the dead shall wield the scepter  
225 Unto all ages. Thrice then unto Rome  
Will the Most High bring pitiable fate  
And unto all men, and by their own works  
They'll perish; but they would not be persuaded,  
Which would have been much more, to be desired.

But shamelessly will they strip off still more;  
250 Under the rule of tyrants they shall perish.  
    The stars shall all fall forwards in the sea,  
All one by one, yet shall men see in heaven  
A brilliant cornet, sign of much distress  
About to come, of war and battle-strife.

But then when heavenly grace shall reign within,  
And when the holy child shall crush with bonds

Within the house of Hades, afterwards

fragmentary. The remaining words, translated in our text, show that the
general subject was that of judgment of God and the end of the world.

\[L., 61 792\]. 282 appears in full, book xiv, 381.

284-330. This passage is celebrated as being an acrostic of thirty-four
lines in the Greek text, the first letters of which lines form the title
given above, namely, JESUS CHRIST, SON OF GOD, SAVIOUR, CROSS. It is
quoted in full by Eusebius in his report of Constantine's Oration to the
Assembly of the Saints, xviii \[G., 20, 1288, 1289\], and, excepting the
seven lines representing the word CROSS, by Augustine, *de Civitate
Dei*, xviii, 123 \[L., 41, 5791. We give in our text a faithful
translation of the Greek without any {footnote p. 172} attempt to
transfer it into a corresponding English acrostic, but in the Appendix
of this volume (pp. 274-277) the reader may find several English
translations which aim to reproduce the acrostic form of the original.
To the picture of the day of judgment as given in this acrostic there is
obvious allusion at the beginning of the famous medieval hymn:

Dies iræ, dies illa,  
Solvet sæclum in favilla,  
Teste David cum Sibylla.

Faithful and faithless mortals shall see God  
The Most High with the saints at the end of time.  
290 And of men bearing flesh he judges souls  
Upon his throne, when sometime the whole world  
Shall be a desert and a place of thorns.  
And mortals shall their idols cast away  
And all wealth. And the searching fire shall burn  
1295 Earth, heaven, and sea; and it shall burn the gates,  
Of Hades' prison. Then shall come all flesh  
Of the dead to the free light of the saints;  
But the lawless shall that fire whirl round and round.  
For ages. Howsoever much one did  
300 In secret, then shall he all things declare;  
For God shall open dark breasts to the light.  
And lamentation shall there be from all  
And gnashing of teeth. Brightness of the, sun  
Shall be eclipsed and dances of the stars.  
305 He shall roll up the heaven; and of the moon  
The light shall perish. And he shall exalt  
The valleys and destroy the heights of hills,  
And height no longer shall appear remaining  
Among men. And the hills shall with the plains  
310 Be level and no more on any sea  
Shall there be sailing. For the earth shall then  
With heat be shriveled and the dashing streams

Shall with the fountains fall. The trump shall send  
From heaven a very lamentable sound,  
315 Howling the loathsomeness of wretched men  
And the world's woes. And then the yawning earth  
Shall show Tartarean chaos. And all kings  
Shall come unto the judgement seat of God.  
And there shall out of heaven a stream of fire  
320 And brimstone flow. But for all mortals then  
Shall there a sign be, a distinguished seal,  
The Wood among believers, and the horn  
Fondly desired, the life of pious men,  
But it shall be stumbling block of the world,  
325 Giving illumination to the elect  
By water in twelve springs; and there shall rule  
A shepherding iron rod. This one who now  
Is in acrostics which give signs of God  
Thus written openly, the Saviour is,  
330 Immortal King, who suffered for our sake;

Holy arms, conquering Amalek by faith,  
That the people might know him to be elect

340 Unhonored, without seemly form, to give  
Hope to the pitiable; and he will give  
Fair form to mortal flesh, and heavenly faith  
To those without faith, and he'll give fair form  
To the man who was fashioned from the first  
345 By the holy hands of God, and whom by guile  
The serpent led astray unto the fate  
Of death to go and knowledge to receive  
Of good and evil, so that leaving God  
He serves the ways of mortals. For at first  
350 Receiving him as fellow-counsellor  
From the beginning the Almighty said:  
"Let both of us, O Son, make mortal tribes--  
Stamping them with the impress of our image;  
I now by my hands, and thou by the Word  
355 In after time shalt for our form provide  
That we may jointly cause it to arise."  
Keeping in mind this purpose he shall come  
To the creation, to a holy virgin  
Bringing the likeness antitypical,  
360 Baptizing with water by the elders' hands,  
And by the Word accomplishing all things,  
And healing every sickness. By his word  
He winds shall he make cease, and with his foot  
Shall calm the raging sea, walking thereon  
365 In peaceful faith. And from five loaves of bread  
And a fish of the sea live thousand men  
Shall he fill in the desert, and then taking  
All the remaining fragments for the hope  
Of peoples shall he fill twelve baskets full.  
370 And the souls of the blessed he shall call,

And love the pitiable, who, being mocked,  
Beaten, and whipped, shall evil do for good  
Desiring poverty. He who perceives  
All things and sees all things and hears all things  
375 Shall search the heart and bare it to conviction;  
For of all things is he himself the ear  
And mind and sight, and Word that maketh forms  
To whom all things submit, and he preserves  
Them that are dead and every sickness heals.

wings and to receive on their foreheads that great and lofty sign."

Abide in solitude, air, earth, sea, light  
450 Of gleaming fire, and heavenly sky and night  
And all days into one shall run together  
And into outward form all-desolate.  
For from heaven shall the stars of light all fall.  
And there shall fly no longer in the air  
455 The well-winged birds, nor stepping be on earth;  
For wild beasts shall all perish. Nor shall be  
Voices of men, nor of beasts, nor of birds.  
The world shall hear no serviceable sound,  
Being disordered; but a mighty sound  
460 Of threatening shall the deep sea sound aloud,  
And swimming trembling creatures of the sea  
Shall all die; and no longer on the waves  
Shall sail the freighted ship. And earth shall groan  
Blood-stained by wars; and all the souls of men  
465 Shall gnash with their teeth, \[of the lawless souls  
Both by loud crying and by fear,\] dissolved  
By thirst, by famine, and by plague and murders,  
And they shall call death beautiful and death  
Shall flee away from them; for death no more  
470 Nor night shall give them rest. And many things  
Will they in vain ask God who rules on high,  
And then will he his face turn openly  
Away from them. For he to erring men  
Gave in seven ages for repentance signs

Forsaking the Creator they were slaves  
To lewdness. Men possessing everything  
Bestow their gifts on things which cannot aid,  
As if they for my honors deemed these things  
510 All useful, with the smell of sacrifice  
Filling the feast, as if for their own dead.  
For they flesh and bones full of marrow burn  
Offering on altars, and they pour out blood  
To demons, and they kindle lights to me  
515 The giver of light, and as to a god  
That thirsts do mortals drunken pour out wine  
For nought to idols that can give no aid.  
I have no need of your burnt offerings,  
Nor your libations, nor polluted smoke,  
520 Nor blood most hateful. For in memory  
Of kings and tyrants they will do these things  
Unto dead demons, as to heavenly beings,  
Performing service godless and destructive.  
And godless they their images call gods,  
525 Forsaking the Creator, having faith  
That from them they derive all hope and life,  
Deaf and dumb, in the evil putting trust,  
But they are wholly ignorant of good.  
Two ways did I myself before them set,  
530 Of life and of death, and before them set  
Judgment to choose good life; but they themselves  
Hastened to death and to eternal fire.  
Man is my image, having upright reason.

Put on a mortal form. First then did Gabriel show  
His strong pure form; and bearing his own news  
He next addressed the maiden with his voice:  
"O virgin, in thy bosom undefiled  
615 Receive thou God." Thus speaking he inbreathed  
God's grace on the sweet maiden; and straightway  
Alarm and wonder seized her as she heard,  
And she stood trembling; and her mind was wild  
With flutter of excitement while at heart  
620 She quivered at the unlooked-for things she heard.  
But she again was gladdened and her heart  
Was cheered by the voice, and the maiden laughed  
And her cheek reddened with a sense of joy,  
And spell-bound was her heart with sense of shame.

Flew into the womb, and in course of time
