### BOOK IV.

    PEOPLE of boastful Asia and of Europe,  
Hear how much, all too true, I am about,  
Through a month many-toned, from my great hall  
To prophesy; no oracle am I  
5 Of lying Phœbus whom vain men called god,  
And further falsified by calling seer;  
But of the mighty God, whom hands of men  
Formed not like speechless idols carved of stone.  
For he has not for his abode a stone  
10 Most dumb and toothless to a temple drawn,  
Of immortals a dishonor very sore;  
For he may not be seen from earth nor measured  
By mortal eyes, nor formed by mortal hand;  
He, looking down at once on all, is seen  
15 Himself by no one; his are murky night,  
And day, and sun, and stars, and moon, and seas  
With fish, and land, and rivers, and the month

\[1. This fourth book was probably written by a Jew who lived during the
latter part of the first century A. D. In lines 162-165 we find allusion
to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and lines 169-174 are
most naturally explained as referring to the eruption of Vesuvius in 79
A. D., which overwhelmed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. The Nero
legends also appear in this book (lines 154-159, 178-180), and serve to
prove the date not earlier than about 80 A. D.

5\. Phœbus.--The god of archery, prophecy, and music, who had temples at
Delos, Delphi, Patara, Claros, Miletus, Grynium, and other places, in
all of which he gave forth oracles of the future. His oracles were,
according to Herodotus (i, 66, 75), often ambiguous and misleading,

Of springs perennial, creatures meant for life,  
And rains at once producing fruit of field  
20 And tree and vine and oil. This God a whip  
Struck through my heart within to make me tell  
Truly to men what things have now befallen  
And how much shall befall them yet again  
From the first generation to the eleventh;  
25 For he himself by bringing them to pass  
Will prove all things. But do thou in all things,  
O people, to the Sibyl give all ear,  
Who pours from hallowed mouth a truthful voice.  
Blessed of men shall they be on the earth  
30 As many as shall love the mighty God,  
Offering him praise before they drink and eat;  
Trusting in piety. When they behold  
Temples and altars, figures of dumb stones,  
\[Stone images and statues made with hands\]  
35 Polluted with the blood of living things  
And sacrifices of four-footed beasts,  
They will reject them all; and they will look  
To the great glory of one God and not  
Commit presumptuous murder nor dispose  
40 Of stolen gain, which things most horrid are;  
Nor shameful longing for another's bed  
Have they, nor vile and hateful lust of males.  
Their manner, piety, and character

\[24. *Eleventh*.--Or *tenth*? Comp. lines 58 and 110. The reckoning
begins with the first generation after the flood. Comp. lines 64 and 65.
By generation the author evidently means a long period, an age, but its
duration is left indefinite.

Shall other men, that love a shameless life,  
45 Not ever imitate; but, mocking them  
With jest and joke like babes in senselessness,  
They'll falsely charge to them as many deeds  
Blameful and wicked as they do themselves.  
For slow is the whole race of human kind  
50 To believe. But when judgment of the world  
And mortals comes which God himself shall bring  
Judging at once the impious and the pious,  
Then indeed shall he send the ungodly back  
To lower darkness \[and then they shall know  
55 How much impiety they wrought\]; but the pious  
Shall still remain upon the fruitful land,  
God giving to them breath and life and grace.  
But these things all in the tenth generation  
Shall come to pass; and now what things shall be  
60 From the first generation, those I'll tell.  
    First over all mortal shall Assyrians rule,  
And for six generations hold the power  
Of the world, from the time the God of heaven  
Being wroth against the cities and all men  
65 Sea with a bursting deluge covered earth.  
    Them shall the Medes o'erpower, but on the throne  
For two generations only shall exult;  
In which times those events shall come to pass:

had ruled over upper Asia five hundred and twenty years, first the Medes
began to revolt from them, and, having thrown off their slavery, became
free."\]

(36-55.)

{p. 102}

Dark night shall come at the mid hour of day  
40 And from the heaven the stars and circling moon  
Shall disappear; and earth in tumult shaken  
By a great earthquake shall throw many cities  
And works of men headlong; and from the deep  
They shall peer out the islands of the Sea.  
75    But when the great Euphrates shall with blood  
Be surging, then shall there be also set  
Between the Medes and Persians dreadful strife  
In battle; and the, Medes shall fall and fly  
'Neath Persian spears beyond the mighty water  
80 Of Tigris. And the Persian power shall be  
Greatest in all the world, and they shall have  
One generation of most prosperous rule.  
    And there shall be as many evil deeds  
As men shall wish away--the din of war,  
85 And murders, and disputes, and banishments,  
And overthrow of towers and waste of cities,  
When Hellas very glorious shall sail  
Over broad Hellespont, and shall convey  
To Phrygia sorrow and to Asia doom.  
90    And unto Egypt, land of many furrows,  
Shall sorry famine come, and barrenness  
Shall during twenty circling years prevail,  
What time the Nile, corn-nourisher, shall hide

\[69. *Night . . . day*.--Probably to be understood of a notable eclipse
of the sun. Herodotus (i, 74) relates that during the wars of the Medes
and Lydians it happened that in the heat of battle the day was suddenly
turned into night. This event, he observes, Thales had foretold,
designating beforehand the very year in which it actually occurred.

87-89. Reference to the Trojan War according to most critics, but
according to Badt (*Das vierte Buch d. Sibyl. Orakel*, 10) to the
beginning, of the Persian War by the revolt of southwestern Asia Minor,
and the attack on Sardis by the Greeks.\]

His dark wave somewhere underneath the earth.  
95    And there shall come from Asia a great king  
Bearing a spear, with ships innumerable,  
And he shall walk the wet paths of the deep,  
And shall sail after he has cut the mount  
Of lofty summit; him a fugitive  
100 From battle fearful Asia shall receive.  
    And Sicily the wretched shall a stream  
Of powerful fire set all aflame while Etna  
Her flame disgorges; and in the deep chasm  
Down shall the mighty city Croton fall.  
105    And strife shall be in Hellas; they shall rage  
Against each other, cast down many cities,  
And fighting make an end of many men;  
But equally balanced is the strife with both.  
    But, when the race of mortal men shall come  
110 To the tenth generation, also then  
Upon thc Persians shall a servile yoke  
And terror be. But when the Macedonians  
Shall boast the scepter there shall be for Thebes  
An evil conquest from behind, and Carians  
115 Shall dwell in Tyre, and Tyrians be destroyed.

\[95-100. Reference to Xerxes' invasion of Greece.

104\. *Croton*.--No city of this name is known to have existed in
Sicily, and the well-known Croton, or Croto, in southern Italy, cannot
be thought of as perishing by lava streams of Etna. Another reading
{Greek *Brotw^n*}) is, "the great city of men."

105-108. Reference to the Peloponnesian War.

110-120. Reference to the Macedonian power, which, under Alexander the
Great, subdued the Persian Empire, and spread Greek colonies over its
broad territory. The illusions are to be understood poetically, and were
probably not designed to be altogether strict statements of fact.

113\. *Thebes*, in Bœotia, which was razed to the ground by Alexander
before his expedition into Asia.\]

(75-90.)

{p. 104}

And Babylon, great to see but small to fight,  
Shall stand with walls that were in vain hopes built.  
In Bactria Macedonians shall dwell;  
But those from Susa and from Bactria  
120 Shall all into the land of Hellas flee.  
    It shall take place among those yet to be,  
When silver-eddying Pyramus his banks  
O'erpouring, to the sacred isle shall come.  
And Cibyra shall fall and Cyzicus,  
125 When, earth being shaken by earthquakes, cities fall.  
And sand shall hide all Samos under banks.  
And Delos visible no more, but things  
Of Delos shall all be invisible.  
And to Rhodes shall come evil last, but greatest.  
130    The Macedonian power shall not abide;  
But from the west a great Italian war  
Shall flourish, under which the world shall bear  
A servile yoke and the Italians serve.  
And thou, O wretched Corinth, thou shalt look  
135 Sometime upon thy conquest. And thy tower,

\[118. *Bactria*.--The northeastern extreme of the Persian Empire,
bordering on northern India.

119\. *Susa*.--The biblical Shushan, one of the capital cities of the
Persian Empire.

122\. *Pyramus*.--A river of Cilicia flowing southward from Mount Taurus
and emptying into the Mediterranean. Strabo (book i, chap. iii, 7)
describes it and quotes these lines of the Sibyl as all ancient oracle.

123\. *Sacred isle*.--Referring probably to Cyprus, which word Strabo
here reads.

124\. *Cibyra*.--City of Asia Minor, in Phrygia, near the border of
Caria. *Cyzicus* was a city of Mysia, on an island of the same name in
the Propontis.

126, 127. On *Samos* and *Delos* comp. book iii, 454.

134\. *Corinth*.--Destroyed by the Romans the same year as Carthage, B.
C. 146.\]

{p. 105}

O Carthage, shall press lowly on the ground.  
    Wretched Laodicea, thee sometime  
Shall earthquake lay low, casting headlong down,  
But thou, a city firmly set, again  
140 Shalt stand. O Lycia Myra beautiful,  
Thee never shall the agitated earth  
Set fast; but falling headlong down on earth  
Shalt thou, in manner like an alien, pray  
To flee away into another land,  
145 When sometime the dark water of the sea  
With thunders and earthquakes shall stop the din  
Of Patara for its impieties.  
    Also for thee, Armenia, there remains  
A slavish fate; and there shall also come  
150 To Solyma an evil blast of war  
From Italy, and God's great temple spoil.  
But when these, trusting folly, shall cast off  
Their piety and murders consummate  
Around the temple, then front Italy  
155 A mighty king shall like a runaway slave  
Flee over the Euphrates' stream unseen,

\[138. *Lay low*.--Read {Greek *strw'sei*}. Comp. book v, 587 (Greek
text, 438). So Mendelssohn, favored by Rzach.

140\. *Myra*.--Chief city of Lycia, on the southern coast, about a
league from the sea. Its ruins witness to its ancient wealth and beauty.

147\. *Patara*.--Sec book iii, 551.

148\. *Armenia*.--There was Armenia Major, the vast territory south of
the Caucasus Mountains and between the Euxine and Caspian Seas; and
Armenia Minor, a, small section on the west of Armenia Major, and east
of Cappadocia. All these lands were subject to Alexander, then to the
Syrian princes, and were made a Roman province under Trajan.

150\. *Solyma*.--That is, Jerusalem.

155\. *Mighty king*.--Nero, whose murder of his mother is notorious, and
whose flight beyond the Euphrates and expected return as antichrist was
a superstitious tradition long maintained.\]

(106-120.)

{p. 106}

Unknown, who shall some time dare loathsome guilt  
Of matricide, and many other things,  
Having confidence in his most wicked hands.  
160 And many for the throne with blood  
Rome's soil while he flees over Parthian land.  
   And out of Syria shall come Rome's foremost man,  
Who having burned the temple of Solyma,  
And having slaughtered many of the Jews,  
165 Shall destruction on their great broad land.  
    And then too shall an earthquake overthrow  
Both Salamis and Paphos, when dark water  
Shall dash o'er Cyprus washed by many a wave.  
    But when from deep cleft of Italian land  
170 Fire shall come flashing forth in the broad heaven,  
And many cities burn and men destroy,  
And much black ashes shall fill the great sky,  
And small drops like red earth shall fall from heaven,  
Then know the anger of the God of heaven,  
175 For that they without reason shall destroy  
The nation of the pious. And then strife  
Awakened of war shall come to the West,  
Shall also come the fugitive of Rome,  
Bearing a great spear, having marched across

\[162-165. This evidently refers to the destruction of Jerusalem and the
temple, and the subjugation of all Palestine by the Romans under
Vespasian and Titus.

167\. *Salamis and Paphos*.--Famous cities, one at the east and the
other at the west end of Cyprus. "How often," says Seneca (*Epist*. 91),
"has this calamity (earthquake) laid Cyprus waste? How often has Paphos
fallen into ruin?"

171-176. The great eruption of Vesuvius, which destroyed Pompeii and
Herculaneum, A. D. 79, is construed by the Sibyl as a sign of God's
anger against the Romans for the slaughter of the Jews.

178\. Fugitive of Rome.--Nero, referred to in lines 154-159 above.\]

180 Euphrates with his many myriads.  
    O wretched Antioch, they shall call thee  
No more a city when around their spears  
Because of thine own follies thou shalt fall.  
And then on Scyros shall a pestilence  
185 And dreadful battle-din destruction bring.  
    Alas, alas! O wretched Cyprus, thee  
Shall a broad wave of the sea cover, thee  
Tossed on high by the whirling stormy winds.  
    And into Asia there shall come great wealth,  
190 Which Rome herself once, plundering, put away  
In her luxurious homes; and twice as much  
And more shall she to Asia render back,  
And then there shall be an excess of war.  
    And Carian cities by Mæander's waters,  
195 Girded with towers and very beautiful,  
Shall by a bitter famine be destroyed,  
When the Mæander his dark water hides.  
    But when piety shall perish from mankind,  
And faith and right be hidden in the world,  
200 . . . Fickle . . . and in unhallowed boldness  
Living shall practice wanton violence,  
And reckless evil deeds, and of the pious  
No one shall make account, but even them all  
From thoughtlessness they utterly destroy  
205 In childish folly, in their violence  
Exulting and in blood holding their bands;  
Then know thou that God is no longer mild,

\[184. *Scyros*.--Large island of the Ægean Sea east of Eubœa.

191\. *Twice as much*.--Comp. book iii, 434-441.

194\. *Mæander*.--This stream, having its sources in Phrygia, ran
westward between Caria and Lydia, and was famous for its many windings.
Comp. Ovid, *Metam.*, viii, 162-166.\]

(139-159.)  
{p. 108}

But gnashing with fury and destroying all  
The race of men by conflagration great.  
210 Ah! miserable mortals, change these things,  
Nor lead the mighty God to wrath extreme;  
Put giving up your swords and pointed knives,  
And homicides and wanton violence,  
Wash your whole body in perennial streams,  
215 And lifting up your hands to heaven seek pardon  
For former deeds and expiate with praise  
Bitter impiety; and God will give  
Repentance; he will not destroy; and wrath  
Will he again restrain, if in your hearts  
220 Ye all will practice honored piety.  
But if, ill-disposed, ye obey me not,  
But with a fondness for strange lack of sense  
Receive all these things with an evil ear,  
There shall be over all the world a fire  
225 And greatest omen with sword and with trump  
At sunrise; the whole world shall hear the roar  
And mighty sound. And he shall burn all earth,  
And destroy the whole race of men, and all  
The cities and the rivers and the sea;  
230 All things he'll burn, and it shall be black dust.  
    But when now all things shall have been reduced  
To dust and ashes, and God shall have calmed

\[209. See lines 224-230, and comp. 2 Pet. iii, 7; Cicero, *de Natura
Deorum*, ii, 49; Ovid, *Metam.* i, 256-258. Justin Martyr refers to this
passage in his first Apology, chap. xx.

212\. *Knives*.--Read {Greek *sto'nuxas*} instead of {Greek
*stonaxa's*}. This emendation proposed by Mendelssohn seems more
suitable than the reading groanings, and finds favor with Rzach.

214\. *Wash*.--Reference to Christian baptism.

218-220. Cited in Lactantius, *de Ira Dei*, xxiii.

231-248. This picture of resurrection, judgment, and awarding of
{footnote p. 109} punishments and rewards embodies the substance of
familiar Christian doctrine. This passage is quoted in the *Apostolical
Constitutions*, book v, 7 \[G., 1, 844\], where we find a somewhat
abbreviated text.\]

(160-179.)

{p. 109}

The fire unspeakable which he lit up,  
The bones and ashes of men God himself  
235 Again will fashion, and he will again  
Raise mortals up, even as they were before.  
And then shall be the judgment, at which God  
Himself as judge shall judge the world again;  
And all who sinned with impious hearts, even them,  
240 Shall he again hide under mounds of earth  
\[Dark Tartarus and Stygian Gehenna\].  
But all who shall be pious shall again  
Live on the earth \[and (shall inherit there)  
The great immortal God's unwasting bliss,\]  
245 God giving spirit life and joy to them  
\[The pious; and they all shall see themselves  
Beholding the sun's sweet and cheering light.  
O happy on the earth shall be that man\].
