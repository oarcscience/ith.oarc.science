### CHAPTER II

# MYCENAEAN CENTERS AND MYTHOLOGICAL CENTERS

Having in the first chapter laid down the principles and premisses
according to which we have to proceed, we now enter upon our main
subject, a detailed comparison between the centers of Mycenaean
civilization and the centers of mythological cycles, and their relative
importance. The chief facts of Mycenaean archaeology being well known
and easily accessible, this side of our task will need fewer words. It
will suffice to recall the main features of the more important finds and
sites, for according to our principles there is little place for a
discussion of details. What is essential is to comprehend the whole body
and the importance of the Mycenaean relics found in certain places.
There exist good surveys of this age. <span
id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) For our purpose Dr. Fimmen's book is most
helpful with its condensed list of Mycenaean find-places and of the
authorities on the subject. <span id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md) I add
solely such things as are of special importance or were discovered after
its publication.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

The mythological side will need more space and more discussion, for in
spite of the many handbooks on mythology, <span
id="fr_33"></span>[3](mog04.htm#fn_33.md) the mythological materials are
not so readily at hand as is the archaeological information. They need
to a certain extent to be worked up. It will be necessary to discuss
what parts of the myths may with more or less probability be referred to
the Mycenaean age and to consider the evidence for this reference,
evidence which is often of a rather difficult kind and sometimes,
certainly, questionable.
