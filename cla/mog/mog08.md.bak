### 5. THE IONIAN ISLANDS

Odysseus has his home on Ithaca, and the scene of the greater part of
the Odyssey is laid on that island. Since the search for Mycenaean
remains according to the guidance of the Homeric myths had been rewarded
so brilliantly at Mycenae and at Troy, it is intelligible that Mr.
Schliemann planned and Professor Dörpfeld attempted to carry out the
plan to discover Odysseus' palace on Ithaca. Of course Professor
Dörpfeld holds the opinion that old Ithaca was in reality Leucas. We
need not discuss that vexed question here. On both islands the search
for Mycenaean remains failed, generally speaking; all that was found
were some few sherds such as appear even in countries distant from
Greece. <span id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_176.md)

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Why the search for
Mycenaean remains failed is clear. One of the premisses was erroneous.
For the myth of Odysseus is not a heroic myth but a romance. <span
id="fr_177"></span>[2](#fn_177.md) A romance may choose and localize its
heroes in an arbitrary manner; thus the localization of the plot is
unreliable. It may be transferred from one place to another in a loose
manner which some scholars think fit for heroic mythology also. The
failure of the search for the palace of Odysseus proves from the
negative side the view maintained in these lectures.

On the other hand, apart from the story of his return, Odysseus is one
of the most prominent Homeric heroes and plays a most important part in
the Iliad. That seems to prove that he, as well as other heroes,
belonged to the old stock. His very name shows signs of great antiquity.
The ending is the one common in the earlier stratum of heroic names,
-*eus*, and the varying forms, Odysseus, Olytteus, etc., <span
id="fr_178"></span>[3](#fn_178.md) present a perplexing philological
problem and prove the ancient origin of the name; for later names are
regularly so formed that their origin is clear.

Odysseus lived at Ithaca, be it the historical Ithaca, or Leucas.
Although he himself plays a very

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

prominent part in the Iliad, his country and his people are mentioned
only twice. In the rather late scene where Helen from the walls of Troy
points out the Greek heroes to the Trojans, she says that he was bred in
the rocky country of Ithaca; <span id="fr_179"></span>[4](#fn_179.md) and
in another place the herald Eurybates is said to be an Ithacan. <span
id="fr_180"></span>[5](#fn_180.md) On the other hand, when Odysseus' people
are mentioned in the mustering of the troops by Agamemnon, they are said
to be Cephallenians. <span id="fr_181"></span>[6](#fn_181.md) In the
Odyssey Odysseus lives on Ithaca and is twice called an Ithacan, but he
is called not king of Ithaca but king of the Cephallenians. This occurs
in the late narrative of his meeting with his old father Laërtes. <span
id="fr_182"></span>[7](#fn_182.md) He fears that the Ithacans may send
messages to the towns of the Cephallenians. Remembering the prowess of
his youth, Laërtes calls himself king of the Cephallenians, and some
verses later <span id="fr_183"></span>[8](#fn_183.md) Antinous' father
complains that Odysseus killed the bravest of the Cephallenians. The
name of the island of Cephallenia is, however, absent from Homer, the
four islands of which the dominion of Odysseus is composed being called
Ithaca, Dulichion, Same, and Zacynthus.

These passages are all late and it may be inferred that a late name
intruded itself, just as in the Pylian epos the Epeans were called
Eleans. But the relation between the names of the country and of the
people is here reversed. The Eleans have their name from the country of
Elis, the people of the Kephallenes, as the Greek form is, have given
their name to the island of Cephallenia, which in the

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Homeric age was
called by another name, be it Dulichion, as Professor Dörpfeld and his
followers think, be it Same as the old opinion is. <span
id="fr_184"></span>[9](#fn_184.md)

To this view the finds from the Mycenaean age correspond in a certain
manner. While very few Mycenaean remains, not more than in foreign
places, have been found on Ithaca and on Leucas, such finds are more
considerable on Cephallenia, including four tholos tombs and a series of
chamber tombs and other tombs near Diaka, with sub-Mycenaean
pottery. <span id="fr_185"></span>[10](#fn_185.md) To these finds,
registered by Dr. Fimmen, are to be added not inconsiderable finds of
pottery, bronze utensils, etc., from a habitation at Orkopeda on the
peninsula of Pale. <span id="fr_186"></span>[11](#fn_186.md) Thus
archaeological facts seem to prove that the epical tradition of the
dominion of the Cephallenians is old; it belonged, however, to a very
late period of the Mycenaean age and was of no great importance.

There are, however, certain objections to be considered. Attention has
been called to the fact that the name of the Kephallenes, in the Dorian
dialect Kephallanes, has the same ending as several tribal names of
northwestern Greece, e.g., Ainianes, Atintanes, Athamanes, etc., and
from this fact the conclusion is drawn that the Kephallenes were a
north-western tribe. If this is so, they must have invaded the islands
at the beginning of the historical age; that is, at a very late period
of epic poetry, and have given their name to the island after the
Homeric age. The name of the island of Cephallenia appears for the first
time in Herodotus. It cannot be denied

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

that this is possible; and if it is really what happened, the above
inference must be withdrawn. <span id="fr_187"></span>[12](#fn_187.md)

It appears that this is a very uncertain matter, but its importance for
our chief purpose is slight. Moreover, I am obliged to confess that I am
unable to guess why Odysseus was localized precisely on Ithaca. It may
be explained, if with Professor Wilamowitz we take Ithakoi to be a
tribal name which was applied to the island later, <span
id="fr_188"></span>[13](#fn_188.md) just as the tribal name of the
Cephallenians was applied to the island of Cephallenia, but this also is
not more than a guess. It ought, however, to be well observed that no
old cycle of myths is attached to Odysseus. The story of his return to
his faithfully abiding wife is a romance; his adventures on the sea are
sailors' stories, such as are told by a sea-faring people; and were *en
vogue* during the epoch of the Greek colonization. Originally they were
not bound up with a certain person but were attached to one person or to
another who seemed suitable, and Odysseus was suitable as king of an
empire of far-off islands. Other myths of Odysseus are still later. The
fame of Odysseus is due to these late myths and to the genius of a poet
who depicted his character as that of the wise and cunning man and thus
made him an important personage in the Iliad. He has no mythological
cycle of his own but was put into the foreground during the development
of Homeric

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

epics. And this corresponds closely to the state of things in this
outlying part of Greece, as archaeology shows them to have been in the
Mycenaean age.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_176"></span>[95:1](mog08.htm#fr_176.md) W. Dörpfeld,
*Alt-Ithaka* (1927), p. 150 (Ithaca), pp. 283 and 337 (different sites
on Leucas). It is impossible to know what value is to be attributed to a
recent newspaper statement that there were found on <span
id="page_96">p. 96</span> Ithaca "des restes très importants
d’agglomérations mycéniennes et promycéniennes." See *Journal of
Hellenic Studies*, XLIX (1929), p. 235. If that is literally true, it
would reverse my arguments, but I think it safest to wait and see. I
have not seen the correspondence which has been going on this autumn
(1930) in the *Times* concerning Ithaca. Cp. *Bulletin de correspondence
hellénique*, LIII (1929), p. 505.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[96:2](mog08.htm#fr_177.md) Here I am in agreement
with Wilamowitz, *Die Ilias and Homer*, pp. 281 *et seq*.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[99:12](mog08.htm#fr_187.md) The contention that
tribal names ending in -*ānes* and -*ēnes* are exclusively northwestern
is not absolutely certain. If Athamas is the eponymous hero of the
Athamanes, which, however, is very uncertain (cp. below pp.
[133](mog10.htm#page_133) *et seq*..md), this would prove that tribal names
with this ending had already appeared in the Mycenaean age.
