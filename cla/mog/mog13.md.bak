### CHAPTER III

# HERACLES

I have tried to show that Greek epic poetry and the great mythological
cycles go back into the Mycenaean age. In order not to be misunderstood
I am anxious to stress the fact that the boundaries set for our
knowledge in this respect are the same as those which limit the proof
that historical elements are contained in heroic myths. To take the
standard example, we know that Theoderic of Ravenna and Attila, the king
of the Huns, are historical personages and we know their exploits. Hence
it is possible to prove that they are the prototypes of Dietrich of Bern
and Etzel in the Nibelungenlied. But if we did not have this historical
knowledge, we should in no wise be able to prove that Dietrich and Etzel
were historical personages. We should perhaps be inclined to surmise it,
and we should be able to make it seem probable but never strictly to
prove it. It is not possible with certainty to deduce historical facts
and events from myths. Moreover, Dietrich and Etzel are represented as
living in the same age, whilst their historical prototypes belonged to
different generations. We ought to know and fully to realize how freely
myths and epic poetry treat and recompose historical events and
personages which they have taken over.

The same is true in regard to our contention that the Greek mythological
cycles originate in the Mycenaean

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

age. A strictly logical proof cannot be deduced from the myths
themselves; they have preserved few traces which can beyond dispute be
referred to Mycenaean conditions. The proof must be deduced from the
historical facts, which I have demonstrated, the one that Greek epics
originated in the Mycenaean age, and the other that the mythical cycles
are constantly connected with Mycenaean sites and in their importance
correspond closely to the varying importance of these sites in the
Mycenaean age. The conclusions which can be drawn from an analysis of
the myths themselves are limited and consist chiefly in proving that the
old kernel of a myth is in agreement with our leading principles.

In the foregoing chapter I have treated according to these principles
the great mythological cycles and their connections with the Mycenaean
sites; in these last two chapters I propose to treat two cycles which
are not local but general in character, that of Heracles and that of the
Olympian gods. The method must of course be different. We must try to
find out what is probable and the connection with Mycenaean conditions
in general.

The cycle of Heracles has been treated so frequently that it is almost
impossible to survey the vast number of works and papers on the subject;
moreover these myths have been judged and explained in very different
fashions. <span id="fr_370"></span>[1](#fn_370.md) Heracles was the most
popular mythical hero of the Greeks and

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

the development of his myths has been accordingly rich and varied. His
cycle is of first-rate importance and interest and in spite of its many
difficulties cannot be passed over in a discussion of our present
subject.

The first difficulty is the name, a much discussed problem. The name is
clearly composed of Hera and -*kles*, which is a frequent compound
element of Greek names, although the vowel *a* presents some difficulty
to etymology. <span id="fr_371"></span>[2](#fn_371.md) The attempt to
separate the name Heracles from that of the goddess Hera has been made,
but such a theory is without foundation, as the eminent philologist
Professor Kretschmer has proved. At the same time he has shown how the
name is to be understood rightly. <span id="fr_372"></span>[3](#fn_372.md)
A brief discussion of the principle according to which the heroes of
myth and of folk-tale are named will be necessary for a right
understanding of the name and is of importance for a right understanding
of the myth, too.

There is a characteristic difference between the names of the personages
of modern folk-tales and those of Greek myths, and by virtue of this
difference the contrast between folk-tale and myth seems to be greater
than it really is. <span id="fr_373"></span>[4](#fn_373.md) Many
folk-tales, also, have been incorporated in mythology. The folk-tale
gives commonly no individual name to its heroes but only one which
denotes his class or social standing; e.g. "the King," "the Princess,"
etc. Such

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

names seem to be almost wanting in Greek myths, unless Creon and Creusa
are of this kind, as I am inclined to believe, for they are nothing but
the masculine and the feminine forms of a participle signifying
"ruling."

A second group of names which occur very frequently in the folk-tales of
many countries comprises those which may be called "descriptive names";
viz., names which characterize some personage according to a certain
peculiarity of his, e.g. Red Riding Hood, Blue Beard, Tom Thumb,
Catskin, etc. They are somewhat akin to the names of the first group. In
Greek myths such names are rare. I do not of course take into account
such descriptive names as were invented by a poet for secondary
personages of his own; e.g. Astyanax, Telegonus, Thersites, <span
id="fr_374"></span>[5](#fn_374.md) but only old mythical names. Polyneices,
the man who stirred up the great strife of Thebes, is perhaps one;
Daedalus, the skilled artisan, and Palamedes, the very artful culture
hero, are others. I have already explained the significance of the name
of Oedipus, "he with the swollen feet."

The great majority of the names occurring in Greek myths are personal
names of the same kind as living men have and are formed in the same
manner, according to the well-known system of Greek personal names. In
historical times, however, mythical names were not given to living men;
they were, so to speak, taboo. But that is a secondary phenomenon due to
respect for the heroes of mythology. In the Hellenistic age this respect
was no

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

longer felt, and mythical names were freely given to men. The folk-tale
also sometimes gives an individual name to its hero, but this name often
receives, especially in certain countries, an addition through which it
almost becomes a "descriptive" name; e.g. Jack the Giantkiller. In
German folk-tales this is more common; e.g. *der dumme Hans*, *die faule
Grethe*, etc.

It may perhaps be added that popular tradition of a more recent origin
sometimes associates a personage with the name of the place where he
lives; e.g. the Pedlar of Swaffham, the Wise Men of Gotham. That is of
course something rather modern, but ought not to be overlooked, for the
Greek epos has the same manner of denoting personages of secondary
importance; e.g. Chryses and Chryseis, the man, the maiden of Chryse,
Briseis, the maiden of Brise, etc. To the same category belong the old
tribal names which are not merely eponymous, e.g. Danaüs, Danae, the
Danaides. <span id="fr_375"></span>[6](#fn_375.md)

This exposition of principles will help us to discover the real nature
of the name of Heracles. Because Hera plays such a prominent part in his
myth, Heracles has often been thought to be a descriptive name; but if
we consider the matter closely, it will be found to be a forced and
improbable explanation that Heracles should have been called "the Fame
of Hera" or "the Man who became famous because of Hera," while this
goddess dealt the severest blows to him and imposed pain, grief, and
labor upon him. The connection between the name of the hero and that of
the goddess is, however,

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

a fact and its importance for the myth is not to be overlooked; but the
name is the Arius and is not originally derived from the myth in order
to characterize the hero. I shall recur to this topic in a later place.
The name of Heracles is nothing but a common personal name of the same
kind as Diocles, Athenocles, or Hermocles. In historical times it could
not be given to living men because of the mythical fame and the cult of
the hero--until Alexander the Great called so his son by Barsine;
another almost identical compound name took its place, Heracleitus. On
the other hand Diocleitus is wanting, because Diocles was used
freely. <span id="fr_376"></span>[7](#fn_376.md)

Heracles is a personal name which once was in common use, even though
the man may be as fictitious as a folk-tale hero like Jack the
Giant-killer. I think it proper to treat him as such a fictitious
personage, not because I would be reviled for shallow Euhemerism if I
asserted that once upon a time a man called Heracles had lived around
whom the myths clustered as time went on, but because the question is
idle. If this man really existed his existence is of as little
importance for the myth as is that of the real Dr. Faust for the Faust
legend.

This fact has a certain importance for the localization of the hero. The
localization of myths is often used as a means of mythological research
and it has been used as a cornerstone in the foregoing chapter, but I
have stressed the restriction that it ought not to be used uncritically
or without due regard to other circumstances. Heracles is localized in
various places. I shall recur to this subject

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

later on; here I wish to stress the fact that a mythical figure such as
Heracles is not originally limited to one locality, just as e.g. Jack
the Giant-killer is not limited to one locality, but that such myths may
be localized secondarily. In my opinion there are myths which are not
local but are the common property of a people, just as some gods are
local, while others on the contrary are the common property of a people.
Of these Zeus is an example. Various forms of Zeus are localized but,
generally speaking, he is not local, and the same is true of the myths:
some are local, others not, but they may be localized, and this is
especially true of the myths that are derived from folk-tales. The
propensity to localize popular myths in a certain place is too little
observed and appreciated. I have already spoken of a clear instance, of
Oedipus, a folk-tale hero, who as such cannot of course have had any
tomb, but was credited with four. Nor has Heracles any tomb, and he
could not have one, because the myth told that he vanquished Death.

Another inference has still greater importance; namely, that all cults
of Heracles are added to him secondarily; this is proved if we survey
them. They are numerous, but none is of first-rate importance; nor has
he any great festival, except perhaps that on Mount Oeta, which is
simply an old rite appropriated by Heracles. <span
id="fr_377"></span>[8](#fn_377.md) No cult of Heracles has been associated
with the cult of a god; elsewhere such a process is a testimony that a
hero is a faded god

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

who was superseded by a great god. Heracles was the averter of evil
(ἀλεξίκακος), the strong and great helper in all difficulties, and
according to this conception his cults are to be understood, as Dr.
Farnell has shown. <span id="fr_378"></span>[9](#fn_378.md) There may have
been many small and nameless local cults for which the name of the great
hero seemed to be appropriate and which he took over, cults both of
small local gods and of heroes. The cults of Heracles prove nothing as
to the development of his myth; they show only his great popularity.

The problem which will be treated here is whether the Heracles myths
originate in the Mycenaean age. It cannot be attacked by the common
mythographical method, which only proves that certain myths are late
inventions or modifications. Our problem goes back into a time which
mythography cannot reach. It can be attacked only through an analysis of
the old myths. This method is of course to a certain extent subjective
and difficult, but holds a possibility of success.

It has often been asserted that the Heracles cycle was formed by a poet
who composed an epos of Heracles. This old epos is quite hypothetical. I
do not wish to discuss it, but wish simply to point out that, if it
existed, it did not create the myths but only made a choice among
already existing myths, a choice which may have determined the contents
of the cycle for a later age. I cannot believe that this hypothetical
Heracles epos was earlier than Homer. We shall see that the Heracles
myths in Homer differ in a remarkable manner from those

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

current later on. Furthermore, this supposed Heracles epos treated a
whole cycle, it belonged to the cyclical epics; and it is obvious that
this kind of epic, which collected and arranged the myths belonging to a
certain cycle, is later than the Homeric epics. It came into existence
because of interest in the myths as such; whilst Homeric poetry chose a
single myth or an episode for the basis of the poem. According to the
economy of epic poetry this is the earlier manner. All myths were not
done into verses. Many of them lived in oral prose tradition and among
these were probably the Heracles myths also.

As a survey of the overwhelming mass of the Heracles myths the
classification of the ancient mythographers is very much to the
purpose. <span id="fr_379"></span>[10](#fn_379.md) They divide the myths
into three classes: 1. the Twelve Labors (*athloi* or *erga*) which
Heracles performed on the injunction of Eurystheus, alone or with the
aid of his charioteer and true friend Iolaus; 2. the Incidentals
(*parerga*) into which he fell while performing his Labors; 3. the Deeds
(*praxeis*), warlike expeditions which Heracles undertook on his own
account at the head of an army, and undertakings carried out by Heracles
together with a number of other heroes; e.g. the expedition of the
Argonauts. Framing these exploits are the myths of his birth and of his
death and apotheosis.

Professor Robert, to whom we owe the best treatment of the Heracles
myths, says that this classification has no value in regard to the
development of the Heracles myths. Some of the Parerga may

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

not be later than certain of the Labors; the only difference is that
they were not received into the cycle of the Twelve Labors. But if we
take the Praxeis into consideration, it appears immediately that their
character, generally speaking, is different from that of the Labors.
Whilst Heracles performs his Labors relying upon his own strength and
aided only by his true friend and charioteer, without whom a hero could
not be, when performing his Praxeis, he appears accompanied by retainers
or comrades, at the head of an army, or in the company of other heroes.
This is certainly a later class of myths than those in which Heracles
performs his valorous deeds by his own strength. This inference, drawn
from general probability, is corroborated if the Praxeis are considered
in detail.

The expedition against Pylos is a remodeling of an older and more
serious myth to which I shall recur below. <span
id="fr_380"></span>[11](#fn_380.md) Upon this expedition the war against
the Eleans was modeled, and thus the heroic twins, the Actorione or
Molione, were joined with the myth. <span
id="fr_381"></span>[12](#fn_381.md) The expedition against Sparta and that
in which Heracles assisted Aegimius were added only after Heracles had
become the champion of the Dorians. It would perhaps not be impossible
to unravel the threads in this development of the myth. Furthermore, it
has long been well known that the myth of his expedition against Troy
was enlarged gradually through the accretion of other myths. The
starting point is the myth of the capture

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

of Laomedon's horses, but this old motif seems to have been transferred
to the Trojan king only after the Trojan cycle had become so famous that
Heracles' glory seemed not to be complete if he had not vanquished the
Trojans also. For the capture of Laomedon's horses is only a parallel
myth to the capturing of Diomedes' horses, remodeled according to the
scheme of the Trojan cycle. I need hardly dwell upon the fact that
Heracles' part in the expedition of the Argonauts is a very late myth.
The best proof is that the myth is compelled to dismiss him before the
expedition attains its goal. This brief survey may accordingly be
sufficient so far as the Praxeis are concerned.

In order to proceed further it will be useful to take the testimony of
the Homeric poems, although their evidence often is put aside and the
hypothesis of a Heracles epos unduly favored. For even if such an epos
existed, the Heracles myths in Homer offer most important and
interesting variations. As some of them were ousted by later myths or
forgotten, they are probably of ancient origin. And Homer is the
earliest testimony to which we have access.

Among the Labors Homer mentions only the bringing back of
Cerberus, <span id="fr_382"></span>[13](#fn_382.md) but it appears clearly
that the Labors were well-known, although we cannot know which exploits
were reckoned among them. For the Labors the word *athloi* is already in
Homer a fixed word, a *terminus technicus*, and this proves the great
antiquity of this cycle. Moreover the Labors are imposed upon Heracles
by an inferior man, Eurystheus, and the humorous detail is added

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

that Eurystheus dared not to impart his commands in person to Heracles
but spoke through his herald Copreus. The name designates him the
"Dungman." <span id="fr_383"></span>[14](#fn_383.md) The same passage shows
that Eurystheus lived at Mycenae. Athena assisted Heracles through-out
and even Zeus gave him aid.

Hera instigated Eurystheus and her wrath was the real reason why
Heracles was subject to so much pain and labor. A well-known
passage <span id="fr_384"></span>[15](#fn_384.md) relates at length that
Hera induced Zeus to swear that any male child of his kin born on a
certain day should rule over all his neighbors, and that she held back
the birth of Heracles and hurried on the birth of Eurystheus, so that
Heracles became subject to the latter. The quarrel of Zeus and his
spouse in regard to Heracles is mentioned repeatedly, e.g., in the story
that on the instigation of Hera, Hypnus, the god of Sleep, fettered Zeus
whilst Heracles on his voyage back from Troy was driven by storm to
Cos. <span id="fr_385"></span>[16](#fn_385.md) Two myths are especially
interesting, because a later age did not receive them. One relates that
Heracles wounded Hera in the breast <span
id="fr_386"></span>[17](#fn_386.md) and the other says that Hera's wrath
caused the death of Heracles. <span id="fr_387"></span>[18](#fn_387.md)

Among the Praxeis the expedition against Troy is mentioned repeatedly.
It is stated that Heracles destroyed Troy because of Laomedon's
horses, <span id="fr_388"></span>[19](#fn_388.md) and the Hesione myth,
which clearly is a later accretion, is hinted at in the mention of a
wall which the

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Trojans and Athena
built as a protection against the sea monster. <span
id="fr_389"></span>[20](#fn_389.md) Further, Nestor tells of Heracles' war
against the Pylians. <span id="fr_390"></span>[21](#fn_390.md) The Rhodian
hero Tlepolemus, a son of Heracles, is mentioned, and in the Catalogue
of the Ships even his mother Astyocheia. <span
id="fr_391"></span>[22](#fn_391.md)

That Homer relates the myth of the birth of Heracles has been mentioned
before. Thebes is said to be his birthplace and Alcmene his
mother; <span id="fr_392"></span>[23](#fn_392.md) he is once even said to
be the son of Amphitryon. <span id="fr_393"></span>[24](#fn_393.md) His
wife Megara appears only in the Nekyia. <span
id="fr_394"></span>[25](#fn_394.md) In the end of this book we read the
well-known passage which tells that the shadow of Heracles chases wild
animals in the Underworld, whilst he himself lives among the gods as the
spouse of Hebe. It is interesting that the typical figure of Heracles
here is represented as the great hunter.

This brief survey shows that, even if the later parts of the Homeric
poems are left out of consideration, the Heracles cycle appears fully
developed in Homer; all essential parts and all three categories of
myths are present, with the exception only of his death and apotheosis
on the pyre of Mount Oeta. It seems impossible to imagine that this
development is owed to an epos which was contemporary with Homer or only
slightly earlier. For such a development must needs require a much
longer time, and the various accretions have taken place at different
times. I hope to show this later on.

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

Very important are the myths which Homer tells about Heracles but which
later are forgotten. It must be considered closely whether such myths
are inventions due to the Homeric poet himself or are due to an old
tradition which was obliterated in a later time.

We may commence with a passage in the Odyssey <span
id="fr_395"></span>[26](#fn_395.md) in which Odysseus boasts that he
surpasses all other heroes except Philoctetes in shooting with the bow,
but adds that he does not wish to rival earlier heroes, neither Heracles
nor Eurytus of Oichalia, whom Apollo killed in wrath because Eurytus
challenged him to a competition in shooting with the bow. It follows
from this passage that Eurytus had not yet been introduced into the
Heracles cycle. This introduction came about because both he and
Heracles were famous archers, and quite naturally the myth told at first
of a competition between Eurytus and Heracles. Different versions of
this competition exist. <span id="fr_396"></span>[27](#fn_396.md)

There is a passage in the Iliad <span id="fr_397"></span>[28](#fn_397.md)
in which Achilles grieves over the early death which is to be his but
finds a consolation in the fact that not even Heracles escaped death but
was overcome by the Moira and Hera's great wrath. It would perhaps be
possible to explain the reference to Heracles' death by the passage in
the Nekyia where it is said that Heracles' shadow dwells in the
Underworld whilst he "himself" enjoys an eternal life on Olympus, but
such an explanation would be too easily reached.

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> To understand the
passage we must have due regard for the connection in which it appears.
It is caused by the deep grief of Achilles, a casual instance of that
humanizing of mythology which is a most prominent feature of Homeric
poetry. It seems extremely unlikely that the old myth ended with
Heracles' death, an ending which would be quite contrary to its
character.

An old trait appears, on the other hand, in the myths that Heracles
wounded Hera in her right breast with an arrow and that "in the Gate,
among the Dead," <span id="fr_398"></span>[29](#fn_398.md) he hit Hades
with an arrow. Here Heracles is depicted as the reckless and rough man
who relying upon his strength uses violence even against the gods: "Rash
man, worker of violence, that recked not of his evil deeds, seeing that
with arrows he vexed the gods that hold Olympus." One is reminded of
another tale in a late passage of the Odyssey, <span
id="fr_399"></span>[30](#fn_399.md) that Heracles treacherously killed his
guest-friend Iphitus and kept his horses. Moral considerations are
wanting in this Heracles just as they are wanting in Autolycus whom
Hermes taught to steal and to deceive with false oaths. But the two
types differ profoundly in all other respects. This Heracles is the
strong man relying solely on his strength, whom a rough and lawless age
created and even appreciated in a certain degree, a reckless, violent
character who proceeds to extremes, even to rivaling the gods and to
raising weapons against them. There is an echo of this type in Homer.
Such strong heroes were not yet forgotten but belonged

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

to a bygone age, and the humanized poet disapproved of them, although he
could but admire their valiant exploits. "Mightiest were these of all
men reared upon earth, mightiest were they and with the mightiest they
fought, with the beasts that had their lair among the mountains and in a
terrible wise did they destroy them." <span
id="fr_400"></span>[31](#fn_400.md) The Homeric poet is unable to
understand how a mortal man can dare to raise weapons against a god.
Diomedes does so, of course, but on the command of the Goddess Athena.
Other examples belong to a past age and are told to warn someone against
wantonness. <span id="fr_401"></span>[32](#fn_401.md)

From such a reckless and savage nature everything might be expected. If
he had killed his guest-friend treacherously and violated the unwritten
laws, he would be able to lay hands on his own flesh and blood also. The
myth that he killed his own children by Megara may be nothing but the
extreme consequence of this characterization; but that is only a
suggestion of questionable value.

In this aspect of Heracles traces of a primitive savagery appear which
should not be overlooked. Homer and after him the late myths have
suppressed most of these features, but, remodeled so as to become
burlesque, they were preserved in popular conception. The Heracles of
popular tales is no late invention. He is the Heracles who is as
immoderate in eating as in love, who begets fifty sons by the fifty
daughters of Thespius in one night and has innumerable offspring, who
takes the oxen away

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

from the ploughman in order to roast and to consume them--this last a
tale of which the popularity is shown by the number of existing
versions. This Heracles is the man who relies upon his own strength; but
he is regarded from the comic point of view; in both respects he
resembles very much certain strong men of modern folk-tales.

The Homeric myth of Heracles' combat with Hades deserves close
consideration in another respect also. It took place "in the Gate, among
the Dead." The Greek word is νέκυς, "corpse"; this word, however, has in
Homer not merely the significance of "corpse" but is used to denote "the
Dead," a survival of the old primitive belief in a bodily life of the
deceased. The words translated "in the Gate" signify as they stand "at
Pylos" and are taken to refer to the city of Pylos, but it has been long
recognized that this Pylos is the Gate of the Underworld. This combat is
the supreme deed of the strong hero. There are parallels. Sisyphus
overcomes Death by ruse; and the myths that Heracles vanquished Old Age
and Perdition are modeled upon the story of his victory over Death. The
victory over the God of Death is the end of Heracles' career, just as
the life of mortal men is ended by death. He wounded Hades and put him
to flight.

Homer did not understand the real significance of this myth, for he was
completely subject to the fatalistic conviction that Death is
unavoidable and that not even the gods are able to protect man against
it. To him and perhaps even to his predecessors it was unthinkable that
a mortal should vanquish Death. Hence the sense of the myth was
obliterated and

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

the story was remodeled. Pylos became the Peloponnesian city with that
name, and through this transference of the myth from the Nether to the
Upper World the earliest of the Praxeis, the expedition against Pylos,
was created. On the other hand, the combat with the God of Death was
superseded by Heracles' overcoming of the guardian of the Underworld;
that is, by the bringing back of Cerberus. This myth contains the same
idea, the victory over Death, in another setting. It has been suggested
that Cerberus is an image of the all-devouring Empire of Death, for Hell
is depicted in Medieval art as a monster who swallows the dead; but
there is nothing to show that such a belief was current in antiquity.

The significance of the old myths which let Heracles end his strenuous
career by overcoming Death was obliterated, and the necessity appeared
to find another end for his life on earth in accord with the later
conception of him. It is the apotheosis. Heracles was a mortal man and
became a god. In Greek mythology this is in fact an exception. The
heroes are never made gods. Mortal men are carried off to an eternal
life in the Elysian fields, or beneath the earth, <span
id="fr_402"></span>[33](#fn_402.md) but not on Olympus. Eternal life but
not a place among the gods was given to Tithonus and promised to
Odysseus. The divinity of Heracles appears to be late, perhaps
post-Homeric, although the fact that it is not mentioned by Homer is not
absolutely certain proof that it was unknown to his age. I think that it
can be assumed with certainty

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

that the divinity of Heracles originated in the cult. Heracles was
venerated both as a god and as a hero. This ambiguity is due to the fact
that a series of small local cults were attached to him; some of these
were cults of gods, others were hero cults. Heracles was too great and
too popular to be reduced to the rank of a servant or to a hypostasis of
a great god; consequently he appeared as a god in the cults, and for
mythology the problem was to harmonize his divinity with his human life.

How this happened is shown by a recent find--the discovery of his cult
place on the summit of Mount Oeta, where according to the myth the pyre
was lit on which Heracles ended his mortal life and from which he
ascended into Olympus. <span id="fr_403"></span>[34](#fn_403.md) Bonfires
kindled on a certain day are a very widespread custom and on these
bonfires, offerings, puppets, or even living animals are often burned.
The Greek instances have attracted less attention but they are not few
and are especially frequent in Central Greece. Such a bonfire was
kindled on the top of Mount Oeta and the figure burned on the pyre was
called Heracles. This is proved by early inscriptions and statuettes of
Heracles. So the myth of Heracles' death in the flames of the pyre on
Mount Oeta was created and connected with the magnificent but late myth
of Deianeira. On the other hand, fire is, according to certain known
myths, a means for acquiring immortality; Achilles and Demophon are
purified by fire to this end. From these premisses the myth of Heracles'
apotheosis was created and the definitive solution found of the problem
how

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Heracles, born as
a mortal man, had acquired divinity. This story is the only late,
probably post-Homeric element in the important myths of Heracles.

The myth of Heracles' birth presents quite a different problem. Homer
knows his mother Alcmene, his father Amphitryon, and Thebes, the place
of his birth. The myth is in itself of no great importance for our
subject and space forbids a discussion of the story; its interest for us
lies in its localization, which has presented a great difficulty both to
ancient and to modern mythographers.

The Heracles who performed the Twelve Labors had his home at Tiryns,
where he lived as a vassal of Eurystheus. He treacherously precipitated
Iphitus from the walls of this town, and according to Hesiod <span
id="fr_404"></span>[35](#fn_404.md) he drove the oxen of Geryon to Tiryns.
His connection with Tiryns is so firmly established that the poet forgot
that Heracles, who had seized them on the command of Eurystheus, ought
to drive them to Mycenae. Homer does not mention Tiryns as his city, but
as he says that Zeus brought Heracles back to Argos and that Eurystheus
ruled at Mycenae, Argos must denote the Province of Argolis. It follows
that Heracles as early as in the Homeric poems was at home at Tiryns.

How firmly established was the localization of the Heracles of the
Twelve Labors at Tiryns appears most clearly from the difficulties
caused by it to the ancient mythographers in their attempts to harmonize
this localization with the localization of his birth at Thebes. The
manner in which Alcmene and Amphitryon were inserted into the genealogy

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

of Perseus is known. A poem attributed to Hesiod tells that Amphtryon,
having killed his father-in-law, Electryon, fled from Tiryns to
Thebes. <span id="fr_405"></span>[36](#fn_405.md) That is nothing but one
of the usual and easily recognized means of harmonizing two
contradictory localizations and is of no value. I should rather be
inclined to believe that the localization of Alcmene at Midea has
something to do with old tradition. <span
id="fr_406"></span>[37](#fn_406.md)

Modern scholars have attacked the problem in a different way, putting
the question whether Heracles is originally a Theban or a Tirynthian,
and the greater number have decided in favor of Tiryns. According to my
fundamental view of the problem of localization, to ask the question is
in this case wrong. For Heracles is originally as little bound to any
locality as, e.g., Jack the Giant-killer. But the common scheme of Greek
mythology always tended toward the localization of its heroes, and when
a mythical hero was notably popular it is not to be wondered at that he
was localized in various places, and that the localizations disagreed
but in spite of this were retained. Consequently I think that the
localization of Heracles is old both at Thebes and at Tiryns. At Thebes
myths were told of his birth, which was not celebrated in the myths of
Tiryns, an inconsistency such as sometimes occurred in the case of other
Greek heroes. So the story of Heracles was divided between Thebes, where
the story of his birth was principally told, and Tiryns, where his

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Labors were
celebrated. There are, however, traces showing that the Theban Heracles
also performed labors. It is an idle question whether the Nemean or the
Cithaeronian lion is the original one, for the same deed was localized
by the Tirynthians at Nemea and by the Thebans on Mount Cithaeron. The
wife of Heracles is a Theban, and the myth that he killed his children,
which may be old, is also localized in Thebes.

In my opinion it is an idle question whether Heracles is originally at
home at Tiryns or at Thebes. For he did not come from the one place to
the other but is one of those heroes of whom myths were told everywhere
and who were localized in different places. Because the myths at the two
different places told of different periods in the life of the hero, this
difference of localization was not wiped out.

Both Thebes and Tiryns were great centers of Mycenaean civilization.
Thebes was always an important town, but after the downfall of the
Mycenaean civilization Tiryns was merely a poor village, even if it was
called a town and at times was politically independent. The
insignificant remains of the temple to which the ruins of the megaron
were adapted shows graphically how really poor it was. It is quite
incomprehensible how the tradition that this place was the home of the
foremost Greek hero could have come into existence if this localization
is ascribed to post-Mycenaean times. In the Mycenaean age, on the
contrary, and, as recent research shows, especially in the very latest
Mycenaean period, Tiryns was a really important town where mighty
princes must have ruled, so that we can

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

understand why Heracles was localized there. I cannot but think that the
localizations of the Heracles myths both in Tiryns and in Thebes belong
to the Mycenaean age.

Heracles' localization in Tiryns agrees with the well-known fact, to
which I shall recur later, that the first five of his Labors were
performed in its neighborhood, in the northeastern Peloponnese. Another
feature of the myth is also to be considered in this connection; namely,
that Heracles performed his Labors at the command of the king of
Mycenae, whom he was obliged to obey. This is an echo of the political
conditions of the Mycenaean age; for it is from a geographical point of
view unthinkable that the rulers of the different towns or fortresses
were quite independent of each other, else Mycenae would have been cut
off from the sea. Mycenae was the foremost of the Mycenaean cities in
Argolis and its king must have been overlord of the rulers of the other
towns, at least in the period of its bloom. Archaeology corroborates the
fact, the memory of which was kept by Homer, that the king of Mycenae
was the suzerain. The prince of Tiryns was his vassal.

So it is explained why Heracles is the servant of Eurystheus, the king
of Mycenae; and the manner in which the demeanor of Eurystheus is
described may be understood, his cowardice and his harsh commands and
the almost impossible tasks which he imposes upon his vassal. For it is
an ever recurring feature in all epics that the suzerain is described as
an incapable and imperious coward in sharp contrast to the heroic
strength of some vassal.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We find this idea
in the myth of Bellerophon and in the Homeric description of Agamemnon;
it is carried to an extreme point in the abuse which Achilles showers
upon his suzerain in the first book of the Iliad. In the *chansons de
geste* it is the more graphic the later they are. Charlemagne, who in
the earlier chants figures as an old and venerated emperor, is
mistreated in the later chants even more badly than Agamemnon, and his
vassals shower abuse upon him as Achilles does upon Agamemnon. In the
Russian epics Vladimir the Great is a kind of theatrical king who gives
commands to his vassals; sometimes he casts them into prison and lets
them come out only to impose difficult tasks upon them. He mistreats a
newly arrived hero, but the hero defends his glory by deeds and even
defies the king.

These bad relations between the suzerain and his retainers are easy to
understand, for their interests were opposed. The king was eager to hold
sway over his vassals, and they were equally eager to assert their
independence and prowess. Stories were told and epic songs chanted in
the many courts of the vassals and retainers, and when the suzerainty of
the overlord broke down, their hostile attitude toward the suzerain left
its imprint upon the myths. The supposition that conditions in the
Mycenaean age were of this kind is well founded; it explains why the
better man was obliged to obey the inferior man, and why the suzerain
appears in an unfavorable light as an incapable but imperious coward.

In a later age when the Mycenaean kingdom had broken down, when the
kingly power had vanished, and the many cities were independent of each
other,

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

this relation of the vassal to his suzerain was no longer understood and
it was felt necessary to find a reason which was comprehensible to the
new age for the subjection of Heracles to Eurystheus. This reason was
not difficult to find. Perhaps it had already been given in another
version of the myth. For myths and, even more, folk-tales very often
tell of some invidious person who imposes difficult or impossible tasks
upon its heroes; the invidious stepmother is especially well-known. The
name Heracles was the reason why this rôle was attributed to Hera. Hera
was the chief goddess of Tiryns; moreover, she was the stepmother of
Heracles, the son of Zeus, and myths had much to relate of her wrath
because of the many love affairs of her husband and of her hatred of his
illegitimate children. The name Heracles is the starting point for the
rôle of Hera in the Heracles cycle.

So much may be said of the myth in which the cycle of the Twelve Labors
is framed and which gives the reason why Heracles was obliged to perform
his Labors. It must of course be later than the Labors themselves,
although this statement implies no judgment concerning the antiquity of
any single Labor, or concerning their number. Certain Labors may have
been added at a later time. A cycle of Labors; namely, a series of great
deeds which are held together by a myth giving the reason why the hero
was obliged to perform them, occurs in several other Greek myths, though
they all have been obliterated through the fame of the Heracles cycle.
Theseus is said to be another Heracles; his cycle was famous because it
was enlarged by the Athenians for

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

patriotic purposes. The myths of Bellerophon form a similar cycle. Both
have been treated in the preceding chapter. <span
id="fr_407"></span>[38](#fn_407.md)

Very similar is the myth of Phylius. It is, however, related only in
late authors, <span id="fr_408"></span>[39](#fn_408.md) and the reason why
Phylius performed his deeds is apparently a Hellenistic invention. He
was seized by love for a reluctant boy, Cycnus, who imposed upon him the
following tasks: to kill a lion without iron, to capture some vultures
alive and bring them to him, and to seize a bull in a herd and bring it
to the altar of Zeus. There are many traces of late influence in this
myth, which is localized between Calydon and Pleuron. We cannot state
anything about its age.

The myth of the eponymous hero of the city of Argos is older, for it is
mentioned in the Eoeae of Hesiod. <span id="fr_409"></span>[40](#fn_409.md)
To this Argos the deeds belong which are ascribed to Argus with the
hundred eyes in Apollodorus. <span id="fr_410"></span>[41](#fn_410.md) He
killed a bull which ravaged Arcadia and put on its hide; he slew
Satyrus, who robbed the herds of the Arcadians; he killed the sleeping
Echidna, and he avenged the murder of Apis. The tendency appears clearly
to make the eponymous hero of Argos rival Heracles, just as the
Athenians created his rival in Theseus; but on the other hand these
myths are clearly old, or they would not have been localized in Arcadia.

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

Fragments of similar cycles occur elsewhere. Alcathoüs is called the
Megarian Heracles. He is an old and important mythical personage and had
a cult at Megara. He killed a lion which had torn the son of King
Megareus into pieces. Heracles' father Amphitryon killed the Teumessian
fox.

It would not be impossible to collect more instances of the same kind,
but those already mentioned will suffice to show that this type, a
series of valorous deeds, especially the killing or capturing of wild
animals, is old and widespread. Folk-tales corroborate this statement.
Such a series is similar to a string of pearls. Pearls may be exchanged,
taken away, or added, and that is also the case with the cycle of the
Twelve Labors of Heracles. The canonical cycle of twelve may as such be
rather late, but in principle it is old, and as the myth giving the
reason why Heracles performed the Labors clearly is proved to belong to
the Mycenaean age, the same must be true of the cycle as a whole, but
not necessarily true of every Labor.

In order to test how this result attained by general reasoning is borne
out by the myths of the Labors themselves, we turn to a brief analysis
of these. The scene of the first five was the northeastern Peloponnese:
1. Heracles killed the Nemean lion; 2. he killed the Hydra of Lerna; 3.
he caught the Erymanthian boar and brought it living to Eurystheus; 4.
he captured the hind of Ceryneia; 5. he drove away the Stymphalian
birds; 6. the sixth Labor, however, the cleaning of the stables of
Augeias took place in Elis; 7. the seventh Labor took Heracles to Crete,
where he captured the bull; 8. the eighth

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

took him farther abroad, to Thrace, where he killed Diomedes and carried
off his horses; 9. the ninth Labor was the fetching of the girdle of the
queen of the Amazons; 10. in the tenth he killed Geryon in the far west
and possessed himself of his cattle; 11. the eleventh Labor was the
fetching of the apples of the Hesperides; 12. finally, the twelfth was
the bringing up of Cerberus from the Underworld.

It will be to the purpose to work backwards, commencing with the last
Labors. The natural end of the hero's career is his acquiring of
immortality, and that is told in doublets. For we have seen that the
bringing back of Cerberus has this significance, and the same is true of
the fetching of the apples of the Hesperides. The garden of the
Hesperides in the farthest west is identical with the Elysian fields to
which the favorites of the gods are carried alive to eternal bliss. This
idea is pre-Greek. <span id="fr_411"></span>[42](#fn_411.md) The inference
to be drawn from this fact is that a cycle of Labors was already formed
and provided with its natural and logical end in the Mycenaean age. As
the Greeks had quite a different idea of the Other World, they did not
realize that both of these adventures stood for Heracles' victory over
Death; and as they wanted a natural and logical end for the cycle, they
added the victory over the realm of Death, which we have in doublets
also, of which one was received into the cycle, the bringing up of
Cerberus; whilst the combat with the God of Death was

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

almost forgotten and was remodeled so as to become the war against
Pylos.

The three Labors just mentioned take place in far-off countries. The
expedition against Geryon and his cattle is especially rich in parerga,
which for want of space must be passed over. I observe only that Antaeus
is by his name shown to be a specter. For the word *antaios* is used of
specters meeting men, and the goddess of specters, Hecate, is especially
surnamed *antaie*. The feature that Heracles, in order to overcome
Antaeus, must lift him up from the ground is explained through the idea
that a specter sinks down into the ground and escapes his antagonist.
The myth of Geryon was gradually moved westward; it was perhaps in early
times localized in Epirus. Some scholars think that Geryon is a figure
of the Underworld and his dog Orthrus identical with Cerberus, but I
cannot see sufficient reason for this view, though it may be possible.

It is uncertain what real fact underlies the myth of the race of warlike
women, the Amazons. The opinion has been brought forward that they are a
reminiscence of the Hittite empire, <span
id="fr_412"></span>[43](#fn_412.md) but that cannot be proved conclusively,
though it may be possible. If this is so, the myth originated in the
Mycenaean age. I am not able to make any decision, but I should like to
observe that this myth was so famous that inevitably it was sooner or
later applied to the most famous hero, Heracles.

King Diomedes, the possessor of the man-eating horses, lived in Thrace,
but the opinion is well founded that the myth was transferred thither
from

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Greece. For the
Thracian Diomedes is certainly identical with the Argive king of that
name who has a prominent place in Homer. Diomedes was one of the heroes
to whom a long series of adventures on the way back from Troy was
attributed; he occurs also very often as the founder of Greek colonies.
The fame of Thrace as a horse-breeding country, known as early as in the
Homeric poems, may have aided the relocalization of the adventure.
Professor Robert has given the opinion that this deed superseded an
older one of similar character, viz., the capturing of the first horse,
Arion; but he has not proved his point. <span
id="fr_413"></span>[44](#fn_413.md) On the contrary, it ought to be
observed that the Homeric as well as the Mycenaean knight needs not one
horse but a team, for he does not ride but drives in a chariot. The myth
telling how Heracles won his horses seems to me to be old, and we
recognized its double in the myth of the seizing of the horses of
Laomedon. <span id="fr_414"></span>[45](#fn_414.md)

If we look away from the details of the myths of Geryon and of Diomedes,
their kernel is solely the capture of a famous team of horses or of a
herd of cattle, a very common motif of mythology, and merely an echo of
the life of a primitive people breeding cattle and horses. Such deeds
are sure to be included in the career of a hero created among such a
people and in such an age.

The seventh Labor, the capturing of the Cretan bull, is essentially
similar to the first five, which are

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

simple deeds of prowess against wild animals; the difference is only
that this adventure is localized in a country farther off. I have
already said <span id="fr_415"></span>[46](#fn_415.md) that I cannot see
the reason why the myth of the capture of a wild bull should have been
transferred from Theseus to Heracles. The Cretan localization is very
well understood as a reminiscence of the Cretan bull-ring, and
consequently this Labor probably goes back to the Mycenaean and even to
the Minoan age.

The opinion has been advanced that the cleaning of the stables of
Augeias, which. takes place in Elis, is a late addition, but I am not
sure that this view is right, for the myth has a folk-tale motif which
agrees very well with a humorous conception of Heracles. The first five
Labors take place in the northeastern Peloponnese and by reason of this
localization they are generally and justly considered to be the earliest
of all.

It has been observed that it is difficult and often impossible to prove
that a single Labor is of Mycenaean origin, but that on the other hand
there are proofs showing as conclusively as is possible in such a matter
that the cycle originated in this age. But even if that is true, it
ought not to be forgotten that adventures may have been left out or
added in later times. The canonical cycle of twelve may in its present
form be late, but from the point of view of the principles underlying
this discussion, that does not impair its Mycenaean origin.

To finish our exposition we turn to the character of the cycle as a
whole. Six Labors are the killing or capturing of wild animals or
monsters. Such

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

exploits are really quite primitive in character, much more primitive
than the fighting through which Homeric heroes gain fame and glory.
Their character thus agrees in a remarkable manner with the customs of
primitive peoples, of which for want of space only very few examples can
be quoted. If a Wintun Indian has contrived to kill a black bear, a
special dance is performed in his honor. A similar custom is found in
Central Africa among the Beli when a young man has killed a lion, a
leopard, a buffalo, or an elephant. A Hottentot who has killed big game
alone is considered to be a hero and claims the right to be treated as
such.

Representations of hunting in the art of the historical age of Greece
are usually mythological, with one notable exception, the hare-hunting
so frequently occurring on proto-Corinthian vases. Hunting of boar,
deer, and other animals was a favorite pastime of the Greeks but was not
considered heroic. It was otherwise in the Mycenaean age; the Mycenaean
gems show very often a man struggling with a lion or a bull, and hunting
scenes are not rare in Mycenaean art; e.g. the lion hunt on the inlaid
dagger from the fourth shaft-grave at Mycenae and the boar hunt on a
wall painting from Tiryns. Mycenaean art corresponds so well to the
exploits of Heracles that this coincidence strongly corroborates their
Mycenaean origin.  <span id="fr_416"></span>[47](#fn_416.md)

It appears that tales of cattle-lifting agree very well with the life
and the customs of this time, although it occurred at other times also.
Nor is the humorous myth of the cleaning of the stables filled

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

with dung inappropriate to this age, although the time of the insertion
of this myth into the cycle is uncertain, as is also the time of the
insertion of the myth concerning the fetching of the girdle of the queen
of the Amazons. The result of this survey is the conclusion that a
number of the Labors and perhaps the majority show Mycenaean
connections. As the myth giving the reason why Heracles performed the
Labors is of Mycenaean origin, this result is only natural.

To sum up: In Mycenaean times people told of a strong man, who was
called by a common name, Heracles. Exploits which corresponded to the
ideas and life of this age and were admired most highly were ascribed to
him, and around him clustered many tales of the killing or seizing of
wild and dangerous animals and monsters, and probably of
cattle-stealing, too. The economy of the folk-tale required a reason for
these exploits and a motif through which the deeds could be held
together so as to form a series. This motif was found in his being a
vassal of the Great King of Mycenae, and his name, Heracles, gave the
reason for connecting his myths with Hera, who became his stepmother and
the foe of her stepson. His career required an end, and this end was the
greatest deed of all, the overcoming of Death; this was told in
different versions but one of these, the fetching of the apples from the
Gardens of the Hesperides, is clearly of Minoan origin.

People liked, however, to know and to tell something not only of the
life and end of the hero but of his birth also. All these myths were
developed in the Mycenaean age, for the myth of his birth is

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

firmly bound up with Thebes, and the myth of his Labors with Tiryns, two
of the most important centers of Mycenaean civilization. It is just as
impossible to discern the reasons for these localizations as to find out
why the hero was called Heracles, but they prove that the cycle of
Heracles' life was already developed in the Mycenaean age. That is
certain so far as the underlying principles are concerned, but details
are uncertain and often dubious. In this discussion there is no reason
to dwell upon the varied later development of the Heracles cycle.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[204:33](mog13.htm#fr_402.md) This point of view

residence of her father Electryon is very varying and little to be
relied upon: Midea, Theocritus, xiii. 20, and xxiv. 1; Paus. ii. 25, 9;
Tiryns, Euripides, *Alc*., 838; Mycenae, Apollod. ii. 4, 6, 1.

the metopes from the temple of Zeus at Olympia and from the so-called
Theseion in Athens is not sufficient. That may be due to considerations
