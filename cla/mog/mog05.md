### 2. LACONIA

From Argolis, the chief seat of the Mycenaean civilization, we proceed
to the southeastern province, Laconia. Several important Mycenaean
remains are found here, but they cannot be compared with those of
Argolis. The bee-hive tomb at Vaphio near Sparta where the two golden
cups, the most beautiful products of Minoan art, were found, with
various pieces of jewelry, proves that wealthy princes ruled here in the
Mycenaean age. Very remarkable are the finds at Amyclae, showing that
the cult of the pre-Greek god Hyacinthus was celebrated in the Mycenaean
age. The Menelaeion at Sparta also probably goes back into Mycenaean
times; it is in fact the sanctuary of Helen at Therapnae. <span
id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md) Elsewhere Mycenaean finds are
unimportant.

Before we enter upon the Laconian myths a preliminary question is to be
discussed. In historical times Argos claimed the primacy in the
Peloponnese; though it was unable to support these claims, it never
bowed down completely to Sparta. Its claims found an expression in the
myth that Argolis was the inheritance allotted to Temenus, the eldest
son of Aristomachus. We shall see how Sparta in this as well as in other
cases tried to change and reshape the myths in its own favor. The claims
of Argos correspond to the relation between the two provinces

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

in the Mycenaean age, during which Argos was the most important province
and Laconia relatively unimportant, and they go ultimately back into
this time, for in later times there is nothing to warrant the
predominance of Argos. The reign of King Pheidon about which our
information is [regrettably](errata.htm#1.md) scarce and uncertain was too
ephemeral to have founded such persistently sustained claims.

In Homer the relation between the two provinces is just this. Lacedaemon
appears as a vassalage of the king of Mycenae, or rather as a
secundogeniture given to his younger brother. That Agamemnon and
Menelaus were co-regents, as the Spartan kings were, is one of a series
of ill-founded contentions which try to find traces of the conditions of
historical Sparta in the Homeric poems. In Homer and in mythology on the
whole, Menelaus is clearly subordinate to Agamemnon. There is, however,
a well attested version according to which Agamemnon and his son Orestes
were at home in Laconia, and this must be taken into consideration, for
it would move the seat of the overlord from Argolis to Laconia.

This was a received opinion, at least among some people, at the
beginning of the fifth century B.C. Pindarus says in one of his odes
that the Atreides, i.e., Agamemnon, died at Amyclae and calls Orestes a
Lacedaemonian; in another ode, which praises a victorious athlete from
Tenedos, he says that this athlete's ancestors went with Orestes from
Amyclae, <span id="fr_110"></span>[2](#fn_110.md) hinting at the emigration
conducted by Penthilus. <span id="fr_111"></span>[3](#fn_111.md)

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Especially
explicit is a passage in Herodotus. <span
id="fr_112"></span>[4](#fn_112.md) The Spartan ambassador replies to King
Gelon, who claimed the hegemony in the war against the Persians, that
Agamemnon would groan, if he heard that the hegemony was taken from the
Spartans by the Syracusan Gelon. Stesichorus, whether he is a citizen of
Himera from the seventh century B.C. or a Locrian from about 500
B.C. <span id="fr_113"></span>[5](#fn_113.md) proffers the same
localization. <span id="fr_114"></span>[6](#fn_114.md) From these passages
only one legitimate conclusion may be drawn; viz., that the Spartans
tried to appropriate Agamemnon for themselves as the prototype of their
hegemony in the Peloponnese, just as the Dorians appropriated Heracles
in order to justify their possession of the peninsula. In their war with
the Arcadians they transferred the bones of Orestes from Tegea to
Sparta.

There seems, however, to be an earlier testimony in a passage in the
Odyssey <span id="fr_115"></span>[7](#fn_115.md) which relates that
Agamemnon on his voyage homeward from Troy, coming to Cape Malea was
driven by storms out on the sea to the extreme part of the country where
Aegisthus resided, but that the gods changed the wind and he alighted
with joy in his fatherland. But Aegisthus who had put out watchmen to
watch his return, invited him to a meal and killed him and his
followers. We may observe that these sentences are not coherent; this is
a puzzle to which we return presently. In a preceding passage it is

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

related that Aegisthus seduced Clytaemestra and became the ruler of
Mycenae, but the murder of Agamemnon is passed over with only two
words. <span id="fr_116"></span>[8](#fn_116.md)

Now for a person voyaging from Troy to Argolis, Cape Malea is evidently
out of the way; whilst it would be on the way for one going to
Lacedaemon. Observing this fact scholars have analyzed the passages in
question with the tools of logic, assuming that the verse about Cape
Malea is based upon the localization of Agamemnon as well as of
Aegisthus in Lacedaemon. <span id="fr_117"></span>[9](#fn_117.md) They
think that a narrative in which Agamemnon had his residence at Amyclae
was worked over in order to make it lit in with the current opinion of
his residence at Mycenae. I refrain from criticizing the criticism and
remark only that when a poet adapts earlier chants for use in his poems,
as certainly has been done here, inconsistencies and errors will be
committed very easily and almost unavoidably. Such inconsistencies and
errors exist undoubtedly in Homer. In this case they are the words about
"the steep mountain of Malea," v. 514, and the two verses 519 and 520.
The foregoing verses tell that Agamemnon was driven out on the sea, when
he rounded Cape Malea, to the extreme part of the country where
Aegisthus resided. The two verses in question add that "when an
opportunity for safe return appeared the gods changed the wind again and
they came home." The narrative proceeds to tell that they alighted

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

with joy and that Aegisthus laid an ambush for them and murdered them.
The two verses are incomprehensible in the given situation and there
must be something wrong with them. The reference to Cape Malea was, as
Dr. Kunst observes, <span id="fr_118"></span>[10](#fn_118.md) taken over
from the description of the calamity befalling Menelaus at the same
place on his return. I agree with Professor Schwartz that the two verses
519 and 520 were added later in order to smooth over the
discrepancy. <span id="fr_119"></span>[11](#fn_119.md) A transposition of
the two verses before v. 517, which is adopted by some editors, does not
remove the difficulty.

If the two verses in question are cancelled and if in v. 514 the
southernmost cape of the Argive peninsula is put instead of Cape Malea,
the narrative proceeds consistently. Agamemnon was driven by the gale
from the landing place in Argolis at which he aimed, but succeeded in
coming ashore at a far-off place in Argolis where Aegisthus lived; for
as a member of the royal dynasty he must have a castle and a town. Thus
Agamemnon was by fate brought into the hands of Aegisthus. Why Aegisthus
did not reside at Mycenae after having won Clytaemestra is an idle
question; he did so after having killed Agamemnon because he therewith
took the place of the Great King. Thus the most probable solution is
that there is behind this passage a minstrel's error, of which the
Spartans have taken advantage in order to appropriate Agamemnon for
themselves. Furthermore I am inclined to think with Mr. Harrie <span
id="fr_120"></span>[12](#fn_120.md) that the temple of Alexandra at Sparta

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

with Agamemnon's memorial has been of importance in establishing the
story.

Thus we shall have satisfactorily answered the question as to how
Agamemnon and with him Orestes came to be localized at Lacedaemon. In
view of the relative importance of the two provinces in the Mycenaean
age it is impossible to take the overlord from Mycenae and to transfer
him to Lacedaemon.

If we turn to Laconian mythology a curious circumstance is prominent: we
have much less to do with personages of heroic mythology than with old
gods who were received into it. Helen is an old goddess whose origin
belongs to the Mycenaean age and who always was a goddess at Sparta. On
reliefs from the second century B.C. we see her image between those of
the Dioscuri in the form of a stiff *xoanon* from whose wrists fillets
hang down and who wears a kind of calathus on her head. <span
id="fr_121"></span>[13](#fn_121.md) She had two temples at Sparta: one is
the so-called Menelaeion, her famous temple at Therapnae which was built
upon a Mycenaean site, while another was situated not far from the
Platanistas; with the Helen of this temple tree-cult rites were
connected.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is, however,
not known to which of these two temples the festival of Heleneia which
was celebrated in her honor belonged. Her connection with the tree cult
is corroborated by the fact that there was a plant called *heleneion*,
just as the word *hyakinthos* denotes both a god and a plant. Helen
appears in connection with the tree cult on Rhodes also, where Helen
Dendritis was venerated. <span id="fr_122"></span>[14](#fn_122.md)

In mythology Helen is, however, localized in Attica also. Theseus
carried her away with the aid of Peirithous and hid her in the fortress
of Aphidna. The attempts to separate this myth from Aphidna in Attica
have failed. <span id="fr_123"></span>[15](#fn_123.md) In order to
corroborate this statement it is hardly necessary to refer to the island
called Helene near the coast of Attica and to other dubious
instances. <span id="fr_124"></span>[16](#fn_124.md) That Helen was rescued
by her brothers the Dioscuri is, however, rightly considered to be a
later addition. We state that Helen was at home in Attica also, and this
ought not to be astonishing, for if she was an old goddess she may have
been venerated in several places. Although her cult was preserved
chiefly at Sparta, she has left traces in myths elsewhere.

If it is asked why this old pre-Greek goddess became the pivot of the
Trojan war, I can, I believe,

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

see but one explanation. It was peculiar to Helen to be carried off, by
Theseus and by Alexander. The rape of a goddess is a well-known feature
in a special cult legend; Pluto carries off Kore. Though at first it may
seem astonishing, the rape of Kore and the rape of Helen are in fact
kindred, if we look away from the Helen of epics and take her as the old
goddess that she was; she is a vegetation goddess, just as Kore is. In
the myth of Theseus, to which I shall recur later, <span
id="fr_125"></span>[17](#fn_125.md) there is an apparent doublet; he and
his friend Peirithous try to carry off Perse-phone, who is identified
with Kore. That may be better understood if there was a reminiscence
that Helen was originally akin to Kore-Persephone.

For us the rape of Kore by Pluto looms in the most sacred light of Greek
cult legend and religion; the rape of Helen presents itself as a
frivolous and scandalous quite profane story; but this difference may be
a result of a development under different conditions. The myth told that
the old pre-Greek goddess Helen was carried off, but the invading Greeks
did not seize the deep sense of the legend, only the feature so common
in the heroic age, the feuds of which were caused by the theft either of
cattle or of women, that a woman called Helen was carried off. When the
familiar motif of the rape of a fair woman was given as the cause of the
Trojan war, the woman was called by the name of the goddess of whose
carrying off the Greeks had heard but whose cult had fallen into disuse
in most places. Or it is perhaps better to say that Helen was in cult
legend replaced by Kore, who always retained her

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

dignified position, not being drawn, as was Helen, into the heroic
mythology. Helen, consequently, came to be treated as a mortal woman, of
course a princess. She was made the queen of the city in which she still
was especially venerated, and when introduced into the Trojan cycle she
sank still lower, to become the woman who eloped with an Asiatic prince.

I pass over Hyacinthus briefly, only calling attention to the well-known
and very interesting fact that his name is evidently pre-Greek and that
the site of his temple at Amyclae yielded numerous Mycenaean
finds. <span id="fr_126"></span>[18](#fn_126.md) He is perhaps the most
evident instance of the continuity of a Mycenaean cult in the Greek age,
but he was superseded by Apollo. Thus the well-known myth arose that he
was killed by the god by accident. His death is without doubt a primary
fact originating in the Minoan conception of gods who die, viz.,
vegetation gods. How old the common myth is, it is impossible to decide;
in some respects it seems rather late. Of course it must be later than
the coming of Apollo.

The brothers of Helen, the Dioscuri, are both as gods and as heroes the
most famous in Lace-daemon. They are perhaps the most complex among the
Greek gods. <span id="fr_127"></span>[19](#fn_127.md) Commonly we think of
them as youthful horsemen, the models of Spartan youth, and the saviours
of men in sudden perils, especially at sea. But they were also house
gods and as such widely venerated in Greece. Their symbols

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

are two amphoras with the *panspermia*, snakes, <span
id="fr_128"></span>[20](#fn_128.md) and the *dokana*, which can only be the
beams of a house built of sun-dried bricks. The sacrifices brought to
them are meals, *theoxenia*, which occur particularly in the house cult.
They are especially connected with the Spartan kings, who took them with
them when taking the field.

On the other hand, the Dioscuri are heroes localized at Lacedaemon, sons
of Tyndareus and brothers of Helen. In the only passage in which they
are mentioned in the Iliad <span id="fr_129"></span>[21](#fn_129.md) they
appear as athletic youths and it is said that the earth already covered
them in their fatherland. They are one of the many instances of mythical
twins, but they are also venerated as gods. It seems likely that these
mythical heroes and these gods were originally separate personages and
that they have been united so as to form the Dioscuri as we know them.
Homer says that they were dead and buried, i.e., he knows them as heroes
only. The discrepancy was later smoothed over by the well-known myths in
which one, Pollux, was said to be a god and the other, Castor, a mortal;
or that they alternated, living on one day and staying beneath the earth
on the next. <span id="fr_130"></span>[22](#fn_130.md)

The Dioscuri are perhaps related to the Minoan religion. I have
discussed this probability in another place, <span
id="fr_131"></span>[23](#fn_131.md) but I am well aware that the matter

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

is uncertain and I have nothing to add here but a few words concerning
their fight with the Apharetidae, another pair of twins, for other myths
about them are clearly secondary and due chiefly to their connection
with Helen, which can hardly be very old. The mythographers differ in
regard to the cause of the contest. On one side, it is told that the
Dioscuri and the Apharetidae having together stolen cattle in Arcadia
quarreled about their booty; on the other, it is said that the Dioscuri
carried off the daughters of Leucippus, who were the brides of the
Apharetidae. Sometimes the two versions are combined. It is generally
acknowledged that the former, ° being the more primitive, is the older
version; the uniting of both versions into one myth is due to the epos
called Cypria. <span id="fr_132"></span>[24](#fn_132.md) The Apharetidae
appear as Messenian heroes and their engagement with the Dioscuri is
consequently thought to reflect the strife between the Messenians and
the Spartans, but the place of the fight was near Sparta, according to
Lycophron, who follows the Cypria. <span
id="fr_133"></span>[25](#fn_133.md) Thus it is possible that the myth was
originally enacted at Lacedaemon and that it is earlier than the
hostility between the Messenians and the Spartans, but it is not
possible to surmise how old it is, and above all, there is no evidence
whereby to connect it with the Mycenaean age.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

Concluding these considerations we may state that Laconia on the one
hand has Mycenaean remains but fewer and less important remains than
those of Argolis, and that on the other hand it has some myths but fewer
and less important myths and especially fewer heroic myths, than
Argolis.

identify this head-dress of Helen with the basket ἑλένη, in which

the Ἑλενηφόρια. The head-dress looks really more like a basket than like
a common *polos* which, according to K. Val. Müller, *Der Polos*
(Dissertation, Berlin 1915), was originally a decorative head-dress
without any peculiar signification. The Ἑλενηφόρια were formerly said to
be an Attic festival, but since Kaibel has established the reading of
the manuscripts Δίφιλος δ᾽ ἐν Ἐλαιωνηφοροῦσι in Athenaeus, vi. p. 223 A,
