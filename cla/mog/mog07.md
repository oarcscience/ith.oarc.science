### 4. THE REST OF THE PELOPONNESE

If we now turn to the remaining parts of the Peloponnesian peninsula, to
Arcadia, the central mountain land, to Elis, the northwestern district,
and to Achaea, the coastal province on the south side of the Corinthian
gulf, Mycenaean remains are remarkably scarce. Finds from Achaea were
first reported quite recently: late Mycenaean tombs at Goumenitza near
Kalaveyta, <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_156.md) chamber tombs near
Prostovitza on the west slopes of Mount Erymanthus, chamber tombs and
three tholos tombs near Chalandritza, twelve miles south of
Patras. <span id="fr_157"></span>[2](#fn_157.md) Only the last mentioned
find seems to be of any importance; and the report, barely mentions that
and gives no details. In Arcadia Mycenaean remains seem to be still less
important; most remarkable are the tholos tombs at Sarandapotamos near
Tegea, of which one has been explored. <span
id="fr_158"></span>[3](#fn_158.md) Elis has yielded still less, Olympia a
single Mycenaean sherd, and the hill where ancient Pisa was situated a
few sherds. <span id="fr_159"></span>[4](#fn_159.md)

To this scarcity of Mycenaean finds the paucity of myths closely
corresponds. Arcadia has a number of curious old-fashioned cults and
even myths, but

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

the most interesting of these are divine, not heroic myths, e.g., those
of Calliste and of Auge. The few heroic myths are of a late make.
Atalanta is sometimes said to be an Arcadian, sometimes a Boeotian; she
is perhaps one of those folk-tale personages who were not localized
originally and of whom stories were told in different places.

In Elis likewise the number of myths is very few. Salmoneus, the
eponymous hero of the town of Salmone at Alpheus, has been much
discussed lately and has been thought to be a reflection of an old
kingly magician. <span id="fr_160"></span>[5](#fn_160.md) This is probably
true and shows that his importance for heroic mythology is small. His
myth was a local sacral myth which was attached to the Pylian-Thessalian
genealogy. <span id="fr_161"></span>[6](#fn_161.md) It is a curious and,
from the point of view of the history of Greek religion, interesting
fact that the most famous seers and soothsayers are connected with Elis.
The Iamidae and the Clytiadae did service at Olympia, <span
id="fr_162"></span>[7](#fn_162.md) and the celebrated mythical seers
Melampus and Bias are said to be sons of the Elean hero Amythaon, who
was connected genealogically with Neleus. For our purpose these myths
have hardly any interest; their elaboration is probably due to the
religious ideas of the early archaic age.

It would have been a sheer miracle if the foundation of the Olympian
games had not been projected into the heroic age and surrounded with
myths. Our concern is not to enucleate the origin of these

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

famous games and their mythical history, which has been discussed very
vividly, <span id="fr_163"></span>[8](#fn_163.md) but to try to see how it
agrees with our general principles. Except for a single sherd, Mycenaean
remains are absolutely lacking at Olympia, which has been searched
thoroughly, and they are few and insignificant at the neighboring town
of Pisa, which in an earlier age controlled the games. The myths
attached to Olympia ought consequently to be later creations, even if
earlier elements were used in arranging them. Their relatively late date
is indicated by the fact that quite a number of aetiologic myths
concerning the foundation of the games exist but that none was generally
accepted so as to oust the others.

Pausanias has two quaint myths, <span id="fr_164"></span>[9](#fn_164.md)
one is that Heracles--who here is said to be one of the Idaean Dactyls
to whose care the child Zeus was entrusted--with his four brothers
founded the games; <span id="fr_165"></span>[10](#fn_165.md) the other is
that Zeus himself founded them after his victory over Cronus. Both are
apparently late inventions and need not detain us.

More widespread is another myth according to which Heracles instituted
the games, having killed the Molione. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[11](#fn_166.md) These strong twins have apparently been
borrowed from the Pylian myth. Nestor mentions

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

them twice; he says that they took part in the war on the side of the
Epeans and that he nearly killed them, <span
id="fr_167"></span>[12](#fn_167.md) and in another passage he says that
they were victorious in the chariot race at the funeral games of
Amarynceus at Bouprasion. <span id="fr_168"></span>[13](#fn_168.md)
Heracles killed them in the course of a war which he waged against King
Augeias of Elis because Augeias had withheld the fee which he had
promised him for the cleaning of his stables. Augeias appears in the
Pylian epos as king of Elis. <span id="fr_169"></span>[14](#fn_169.md) In
this epos Heracles was the foe of the Pylians; in the myth here treated
he is the foe of the Eleans.

This change may perhaps be connected with a change in the dominating
population. The Eleans of the historical age spoke a northwestern
dialect; they were a northwestern tribe, kindred of the Aetolians, who
had traversed the Strait of Naupactus. If the Dorians who invaded the
Peloponnese took the same way, they came earlier and were ousted by the
Eleans. This view implies of course that the Epeans who warred with the
Pylians belonged to the earlier Dorian invasion. In the Homeric age the
last invasion had already taken place, and Homer confused of course
Epeans and Eleans, but, as we remarked, the latter name is a local and
not a tribal one. However this hypothesis may be judged, the myth of
Heracles' war with Augeias and his killing of the Molione is apparently
a late creation, composed of elements of which certain parts were taken
from the Pylian cycle. <span id="fr_170"></span>[15](#fn_170.md)

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

Much more celebrated is the myth of Pelops and Oenomaus which was chosen
as the subject of the sculptures in the east pediment of the temple of
Zeus at Olympia. We have seen above <span
id="fr_171"></span>[16](#fn_171.md) that Pelops was the eponymous hero of
the tribe of the Pelopes, which gave its name to the Peloponnesian
peninsula, and that he was made an ancestor of the Atreidae. Oenomaus
appears curiously isolated; he is not attached to the genealogy of the
Elean kings. The goal of the race is by some authors said to have been
on the Corinthian isthmus; personages and events of the myth were
localized partly in the north-eastern Peloponnese, partly even on
Lesbos. Thus the inference is near at hand that the myth was transferred
to Olympia from Lesbos <span id="fr_172"></span>[17](#fn_172.md) or from
the northeastern Peloponnese. <span id="fr_173"></span>[18](#fn_173.md) It
must, however, be conceded that there is nothing which proves with
certainty that these localizations are earlier than its localization at
Olympia. <span id="fr_174"></span>[19](#fn_174.md)

More important is the fact to which several scholars have pointed that
the running of the course originally implied not a race but the carrying
off of the bride according to the primitive custom known also to the
Greeks. This is a rather common mythical motif. <span
id="fr_175"></span>[20](#fn_175.md) It appears that the myth of the race of
Pelops and Oenomaus was remodeled profoundly

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

in order to be applied to Olympia. It is uncertain where it was
originally at home.

For our point of view the important fact is that neither in this nor in
other myths concerning the institution of the Olympian games is there
anything which can be referred to the Mycenaean age. Just as Mycenaean
remains are lacking at Olympia, so the myths attached to Olympia do not
cling to that place from Mycenaean times. They are recent inventions
transferred from other places or remodeled with some use of earlier
elements. We must be content with this general statement; here, as
often, it is impossible to discern how the myths were developed in the
archaic age.
