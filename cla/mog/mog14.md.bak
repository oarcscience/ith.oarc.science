### CHAPTER IV

# OLYMPUS

We are wont to think that the gods of a polytheistic religion are
regularly brought into a system similar to that which we find in the
Greek mythology, but on close consideration it soon appears that there
is nothing in all the religions of the world which really resembles the
Greek State of the Gods. I need not dwell upon the polytheism of
barbarian peoples, for their gods have hardly been brought into a fixed
system, but I ought to say a few words of some ancient peoples who are
thought to have had a somewhat similar systematization of their gods;
namely, the Egyptians and the Babylonians.

The systems of gods in Egyptian religion are, however, essentially
dissimilar to the Greek State of the Gods. Their origin is theological
and cosmological speculation which tried to bring the local and nature
gods into a coherent scheme in spite of their reluctance to fit into it.
This attempt was favored by political considerations, because the
independence of the local gods involved a certain peril for the unity of
the state. The earliest system, the origins of which probably go back
into the predynastic age, is the solar theology of Heliopolis, in which
the Sun-god was made the chief figure. When at last Thebes became the
capital of Egypt, its local god Amon, whose origin is rather obscure,
became the

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

chief god of the Egyptian empire and was identified with the Sun-god.
His position was due to the fact that Thebes had become the capital of
the empire.

In Babylonia a similar situation arose. Theological and cosmological
speculation, and the systematization of religion were not wanting, but
the creation of a chief god depended even more closely on political
circumstances. In old Sumer the god of a city was its supreme ruler and
the other gods surrounded him as his court. The god of the heavens, Anu;
had the supreme place only in so far as cosmology was concerned;
elsewhere Enlil was the chief god, probably owing his position to the
power of his city, Nippur. When a city was subdued by another, its god
became a vassal of the god of the conquering city; and this relation was
expressed by a genealogy. This process appears still more clearly during
the power of the Amorites. When Babylon conquered the country and became
its capital, the god of Babylon, Marduk, who up to this time was very
little known, became the supreme god. When the Assyrians became the
dominating people, his rôle was taken up by the god Assur.

The position of Zeus, the supreme Greek god, is due neither to
theological speculation nor to the fact that a local cult developed into
the cult of an empire, the city of the god becoming the capital of the
empire. From the beginning Zeus was venerated by all Greeks and in many
places. The Greek State of the Gods was not created to correspond to
political conditions, under which one city subjugated other cities and
the gods of the conquered cities became subordinate to the god of the
victorious city. On

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

the contrary, the god whose character best fitted him for a supreme
position became the head of the gods. While in other countries the
supreme position of the chief god corresponded to well-known political
circumstances, the situation was very different in Greece. In the
heavens there was a monarchical rule; on the earth it vanished very
early in the historical age.

Ancient writers have said that Homer created the Greek gods. There is a
certain amount of truth in this contention, and it is still more true if
it is applied to the Greek State of the Gods. For the form in which
Homer describes this State was impressed upon the ideas of all coming
ages. The problem which is to be treated in this chapter is consequently
how the Homeric State of the Gods was created, and especially where its
model is to be found. For it is evident and has always been recognized
that this model was taken from human life.

This fact is accepted by Dr. Finsler, one of the best Homeric scholars
who has treated the question, but as his view is neatly opposed to that
which I think well founded, and furthermore is complicated with an
analysis of the poems, I am obliged first to discuss his opinions and
reasons briefly. In the Homeric poems as they are known to us Dr.
Finsler sees a thorough-going remodeling of the conception of the State
of the Gods; in fact, he thinks it possible to find and to demonstrate
the origin of this idea in our Homeric corpus. In his exposition of the
Homeric religion <span id="fr_417"></span>[1](#fn_417.md) he makes a
distinction based on differing

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

conceptions of the gods between the earlier and later parts of Homer.
Thus he detaches the battle of the gods and the scenes enacted on
Olympus. Disregarding these parts, as being of later origin, he thinks
that in the remaining parts of the poems the gods are far more
independent of one another, although the supreme god, Zeus, controls
fate. He says that divine genealogies already existed in this stage but
that the family of gods was not developed fully.

Thus he gives voice to the opinion that toward the end of the eighth
century B.C. a great poet arose who undertook the task of forming the
great epos of our Iliad, using the epical poems which existed at that
time as materials for his poem. In forming the plot he introduced the
idea of a supreme guidance of events by the gods. The detailed
descriptions of the family and the state of the gods are due to this
poet; he introduced the Olympian scenes. Whilst in the earlier poems the
idea prevailed that the gods dwell in the heavens, with which Olympus is
here identical, this poet, says Dr. Finsler, recurred to an older,
almost forgotten conception of Olympus on the northern confines of
Thessaly, as the mountain of the gods, and pictured this dwelling place
of the gods with great fantasy.

What is of importance for my purpose is not the detailed description of
the life of the gods on Olympus, for this may very well be due to a
later remodeling; the salient point is the assertion that the gods are
more independent of one another in the earlier parts of the Homeric
poems. For on this opinion the contention depends that the State of the

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gods is a poetical
fiction created toward the end of the eighth century B.C.

Dr. Finsler is a pupil of Professor Wilamowitz and has in this as in
some other cases taken up ideas suggested by this great scholar.
Professor Wilamowitz points to the different conceptions of the gods in
different parts of Homer and emphasizes the value of this difference for
the analysis of the poems. <span id="fr_418"></span>[2](#fn_418.md) He
says, e.g., that the poet of the first book and the parts connected with
this book depicts "an ideal world of immortal men, fond of enjoyments
and not troubled by moral considerations, with the magical colors of a
brilliant fantasy and sensual play." As a contrast to this picture he
points to the very old-fashioned manner of the fifth and even of the
fourth book.

Space forbids a full discussion and I am only able to select some
important and characteristic instances. Such instances are offered
especially by the lay of Diomedes; i.e., the fifth book, which Professor
Wilamowitz thinks to be the oldest in our Iliad. <span
id="fr_419"></span>[3](#fn_419.md) Our first observation is that the
Olympian scenes fill a large part of this very book. And Dr. Finsler
must according to his principles detach precisely these as being due to
a late poet. The fifth book begins by telling that Athena, alleging the
wrath of Zeus, removes Ares from the scene. <span
id="fr_420"></span>[4](#fn_420.md) When Diomedes inflicts a wound on
Aphrodite, we hear that the Charites wove her mantle and that her blood
is called *ichor*; and an explanation is added that

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

the gods are immortal, not eating bread and drinking wine like mortal
men. <span id="fr_421"></span>[5](#fn_421.md) Then the scene follows in
which Aphrodite asks Ares to bring her to Olympus, the seat of the
Immortal ones. Iris unharnesses the horses and gives them ambrosia as
food. Then Dione comforts her daughter and in her speech the most
amazing details occur: Heracles once wounded Hera with an arrow and
likewise the God of the Underworld, Hades, who had to go to Olympus in
order to be healed by the doctor of the gods, Paieon. After this,
Aphrodite is compelled to hear the derisory words of Hera and Athena and
the somewhat kinder exhortations of Zeus. <span
id="fr_422"></span>[6](#fn_422.md) The next Olympian scene is that in which
Iris harnesses the horses for Hera, and Athena takes the weapons "on the
threshold of her father Zeus." The Horae open the gates of Olympus when
she drives off in her chariot. The two goddesses first make a visit to
Zeus, who is seated on the highest peak of Olympus, in order to ask
leave to partake in the fight against Ares. <span
id="fr_423"></span>[7](#fn_423.md) At last Ares is wounded by Diomedes with
the help of Athena, and goes to "the wide heavens" or to "the steep
Olympus," and has to listen to the reproofs of Zeus before he is healed
by Paieon. Hebe washes him and he takes his place at the side of Zeus.
Finally Hera and Athena make their return to the house of Zeus. <span
id="fr_424"></span>[8](#fn_424.md)

There are in this book passages which seem to be late because older
conceptions are remodeled so as to be misunderstood. Ares leans his
spear against a cloud, <span id="fr_425"></span>[9](#fn_425.md) while a
cloud elsewhere appears as a means

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

of concealing gods and men; and Apollo creates an image of the wounded
Aeneas around which the battle goes on while Aeneas himself is carried
to Pergamon by the god. <span id="fr_426"></span>[10](#fn_426.md) But on
the whole the scenes referred to above are too numerous and too
extensive to be considered, generally speaking, as later additions, as
Dr. Finsler thinks them. If they are taken away, not much remains. In
fact, one comes near the opinion proffered by another Homeric scholar,
Professor Bethe, according to whom the fifth book is not old. He thinks
that the scene in which Hera and Athena take weapons is an interpolation
and in conformity with his principles he is of the opinion that the old
kernel is the duels between Diomedes and the two heroes Pandarus and
Aeneas respectively.

Professor Wilamowitz has still another opinion. <span
id="fr_427"></span>[11](#fn_427.md) He deprecates the idea that the
conception of the gods conspicuous in the fifth book should be in
general ascribed to Homer and explains its peculiarity as due to the
national antagonism between the Ionians and the Asiatics in the eighth
century B.C.; it does not appear clearly whether he is of the opinion
that the Olympian scenes are due to a later remodeling. But according to
him the fifth book is the oldest book of the Iliad and he thinks that it
was composed in Ionia in the eighth century B.C. with the aid of a
Theban epos which probably was composed on the mainland. This same book
is, according to Dr. Finsler, profoundly remodeled, and according to
Professor Bethe in it nothing is old except the duels between Diomedes
and Aeneas and Pandarus.

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

I make no attempt at a criticism. I have reported the opinions of the
most prominent adherents of the analytical school in order to emphasize
the subjectiveness of this method. Their widely differing results cannot
be considered reliable. I shall merely add one remark concerning Dr.
Finsler's method, because it is of most importance for my purpose. His
premiss is that certain descriptions of the gods are later than others
and he judges the age of various passages according to this presumption.
If this premiss is questionable, he is working with a *petitio
principii*. I fear that for others the old-fashioned appearance of this
book depends on this very point, on the manners of the gods.

Clearly no certain result will be attained in this way, and we are
obliged to try to find another method. I begin with the very well-known
fact that Olympus appears in Homer as the mountain of the gods and as
their dwelling place. If we go through all the Homeric passages where
Olympus is mentioned, we shall make the following observations. There
are only two passages in which Olympus is the dwelling place of Zeus
alone; in all other passages it appears that other gods also dwell there
together with Zeus. In the two passages referred to <span
id="fr_428"></span>[12](#fn_428.md) it is said that Zeus hurls the
thunderbolt or sends a storm. The passages mentioning Olympus as the
seat of the gods are, except for the scenes actually enacted on Olympus,
distributed rather uniformly; they do not occur in the sixth, ninth,
twelfth, seventeenth, and twenty-third books, which are not among the
earliest, and their absence is of course

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

accidental. The conception has taken form in fixed, often repeated
phrases and verses: "the seat of Olympus," "he went downward from the
peaks of Olympus," "so many gods as there are on Olympus," "the gods, or
the immortal ones who possess the Olympian houses." <span
id="fr_429"></span>[13](#fn_429.md) Four times as introduction to an
important section the verse occurs:

"Say now, ye Muses, who on Olympus dwell." <span
id="fr_430"></span>[14](#fn_430.md)

It is also to be observed that the phrase "the Olympians" occurs twice
in the sense of "the gods." Somewhat more frequently the gods are called
"the Heavenly ones" (Οὐρανίωνες) or the "Heavenly Gods" (δεοὶ
Οὐρανίωνες). These phrases belong to the elements of Greek mythology,
and on them the very common opinion is founded which distinguishes
sharply between the Olympian and the Chthonian gods and forgets that in
the Iliad Hades himself once is reckoned among the Olympian gods.
Olympus and the Heavens appear as identical. It is, e.g., said of Athena
that she arose to the great heavens and Olympus. <span
id="fr_431"></span>[15](#fn_431.md) It is, however, more important that
this identity appears in the cult; that is, in prayer. People pray to
Zeus looking upward toward the heavens. <span
id="fr_432"></span>[16](#fn_432.md) Nestor prays to the Olympian Zeus
stretching his hand toward the starry heavens. <span
id="fr_433"></span>[17](#fn_433.md) Of course a man who prays may also turn
toward

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

the place where the god invoked is venerated, but it ought to be
observed that it is never said of one who prays that he turns himself
toward Olympus.

We see that the gods are in general and as a collective body the
Olympians or the Heavenly ones; consequently they dwell on Olympus or in
the heavens, but no single god is called an Olympian except Zeus. To
this rule there is only one exception; namely, that the Muses in the
introduction to the Catalogue of Ships are called the Olympian
Muses, <span id="fr_434"></span>[18](#fn_434.md) a condensation of the
verse quoted above in which they are said to possess the Olympian
houses.

This difference is not accidental. For the gods, other than Zeus, really
dwell originally neither on Olympus nor in the Heavens. Poseidon dwells
in the sea and in the rivers, Artemis in the dark forests and on the
green meadows. Athena is of course settled on a hill, but that is the
acropolis of a city on which the dwellings of men also are erected. Only
Zeus dwells originally on Olympus, because he is the weather-god, the
cloud-gatherer, the sender of rain and lightning. He hurls the
thunderbolt from Olympus. <span id="fr_435"></span>[19](#fn_435.md) When he
sends a squall, a cloud sails from Olympus, from the radiant aether
upward into the heavens. <span id="fr_436"></span>[20](#fn_436.md) This
concrete conception of the mountain peak surrounded by clouds from which
rainstorm and thunder come shows the nature of Zeus, the weather-god,
and in this quality he dwells on Mount Olympus; he is the Olympian one.
This same conception of the clouded mountain peak gave also an important
contribution to the picture of the City of the Gods. The gates are
clouds which are

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

opened and shut by the Horae. <span id="fr_437"></span>[21](#fn_437.md)
Hence the other gods, as well as Zeus himself, are often concealed
beneath clouds. <span id="fr_438"></span>[22](#fn_438.md) But mountain peak
and heavens are identical because lightning and rain come down from the
heavens as well as from the mountain peak around which the clouds
gather.

Zeus dwells on the mountain peak or in the heavens--these are the
same--because he is the weather-god; and similarly the other gods dwell
wherever their work is visible. If the other gods are Olympian or
heavenly gods, if they dwell on Olympus, this is due to the fact that
Zeus, the one who alone was originally the Olympian, has lifted them up
to his dwelling place. That the gods dwell on Olympus is so firmly fixed
and thorough-going a conception that the fact that it is much earlier
than the composition of our Iliad cannot possibly be questioned. It
follows, and this is the salient point, that the other gods were from of
old subordinated to Zeus. Because they were joined to him as
subordinates they had to dwell in the same place as he. It will be
impossible to find another reason why they have been separated from
their natural working and dwelling places and lifted up to Olympus or
into the Heavens. Zeus is the Olympian, the ruler; the other gods, the
Olympians, are in a certain sense his court. In this subordination of
the gods under Zeus, the Olympian State of the Gods is contained *in
nuce*, and this conception is in no wise due to the development of epics
by Ionian minstrels. It is an ill-founded hypothesis that the gods are
more independent in the

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

earlier parts of the Iliad; Dr. Finsler himself confesses that Zeus
rules events even in these parts.

We reach the same result if we turn to historical considerations. The
world of the gods is subject to monarchical rule, a supreme god is at
its head. In Ionia there was nothing but political lack of unity; there
were quite a number of kings and princes, one in each town. The Ionians
knew of course a Great King, but he was a foreigner, the Phrygian
monarch. The Ionians with their lack of political unity and unified
government would never have been able to conceive the idea of
concentrating all the gods under a monarchical rule, under one supreme
god.

It is recognized that the model of the State of the Gods is to be found
in human conditions. We do not find the necessary conditions in Ionia
and must turn elsewhere. The current answer is: turn to Thessaly. Mount
Olympus is situated in Thessaly, and we find there in historical times
an aristocratic state with one ruler, over the whole country. These
facts have contributed largely to the popularity of the opinion that
epical poetry originated in Thessaly and from there was carried to Asia
Minor. It is impossible to discuss this extensive problem in this place;
moreover the popularity of this view has vanished to a certain extent.
The reasons supporting it have been proved to be more specious than
founded on facts. That the chief hero of the Iliad, Achilles, is
localized at Spercheus or in Phthia in no way proves that Greek epic
poetry, generally speaking, originated in these districts. If the Aeolic
dialect was, as seems certain, much more widely spread on

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

the mainland in earlier than in later times, the argument that the epics
were Thessalian in origin, because their language was originally Aeolic,
is fallacious.

The two arguments referred to, by which the origin of the State of the
Gods is explained from Thessalian conditions, have always been
considered as almost self-evident, but even they ought to be subjected
to an inquiry. I commence with the political conditions of Thessaly. Our
knowledge of these is regrettably slight and opinions differ markedly.
Professor Hiller von Gaertringen published long ago a valuable
paper <span id="fr_439"></span>[23](#fn_439.md) in which he proved that in
the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. there were at the same time several
kingly houses in Thessaly, each possessing a limited district. This fact
is recognized, but he proceeds to assume that neither a ruler of all
Thessaly nor a state comprising all Thessaly existed before the year 460
B.C., that common enterprises brought about only an occasional union;
and that the tradition of the overlordship, the *tageia*, goes back only
to the rule of Iason of Pherae in the fourth century B.C. <span
id="fr_440"></span>[24](#fn_440.md) These conclusions are, however, hardly
warranted, and the *tageia*, the overlordship over all Thessaly, is
probably of older origin; <span id="fr_441"></span>[25](#fn_441.md) but it
was no kingship in the real sense and has evidently nothing to do with
that kingship which was inherited from olden times. The name is not that
always carried by Greek kings whose kingship was handed

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

down from olden times, *basileus*, <span
id="fr_442"></span>[26](#fn_442.md) but another, *tagos*. If the list of
the *tagoi* is made up, we see that these rulers were taken from
different families belonging to different towns. <span
id="fr_443"></span>[27](#fn_443.md) Their position was not due to any
hereditary principle but to election and they were elected only in case
of need. A *tagos* was elected for his lifetime; although there were
periods without any *tagos*.

This institution of an overlord elected occasionally resembles very
little the Olympian State of the Gods ruled by Zeus. The Thessalian
*tagos* had not at all the same full power as the King of the Gods, nor
did he inherit his throne as did Zeus. The Thessalian states were more
oligarchic than monarchical in character. Of course it may be contended
that the power of the Thessalian *tagos* was once hereditary. That can
neither be proved nor refuted. As far as we can see, the model of the
Greek State of the Gods cannot have been the Thessalian institutions.

The most valuable and the strongest argument for its Thessalian origin
is, however, the fact that the mountain of the gods, Olympus, the
mightiest mountain of Greece, the peaks of which rise high into the sky,
is situated on the northern boundary of that province. It is certain
that Homer has the Thessalian Olympus in mind. This appears clearly in a
passage <span id="fr_444"></span>[28](#fn_444.md) where Hera, in order to
entice Zeus

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

into love, leaves Mount Olympus, enters Pieria and the beautiful
Emathia, hurries over the snow-clad peaks of the Thracian mountains, and
from Mount Athos goes over the sea to Lemnos, where she encounters
Hypnus. Here the poet obviously refers to the Thessalian Olympus. But if
argument on such minute points is permissible, there is at least one
passage in which this mountain cannot be referred to, even if we except
the two passages where Olympus may be whatever mountain you like. <span
id="fr_445"></span>[29](#fn_445.md) At the beginning of the second book of
the Iliad <span id="fr_446"></span>[30](#fn_446.md) we hear that Eos
ascended the great Olympus in order to let the light appear for Zeus and
the other gods. If we in these words should recognize the concrete view
of the rosy dawn breaking forth over the peaks of Mount Olympus, the
poet's viewpoint must be west of the mountain and that is not suitable
for the Thessalian Olympus. But I think that it would be hasty to draw a
conclusion from such a minute point. It is certain at least in one case
and perhaps probable in more that Homer refers to the Thessalian
Olympus, but the last-mentioned passage may raise the question whether
this was so always and originally.

There exist a fair number of mountains called Olympus. <span
id="fr_447"></span>[31](#fn_447.md) Mount Lykaion in Arcadia and a hill
near Sellasia had this name; Pisa was situated between two hills,
Olympus and Ossa, and there was another Olympus in Elis. <span
id="fr_448"></span>[32](#fn_448.md) It is not clear which

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Olympus Diodor has
in mind. <span id="fr_449"></span>[33](#fn_449.md) I pass over the
mountains which in modern times have this name, on Euboea, near Laurium,
and on the island of Scyros. The name is still more frequent in Asia
Minor, where Mount Olympus is found in Lydia, Mysia, Bithynia, Galatia,
Lycia, and on Cyprus. In view of the fame of the Thessalian Olympus it
may perhaps be contended and believed that all these mountains are named
after that celebrated mountain. A borrowing took place, it seems to be
certain, when the two hills between which Pisa was situated were called
Olympus and Ossa, but borrowing cannot be the general rule. For the name
of the famous sanctuary in Elis, Olympia, is of course old and cannot
etymologically be separated from the name of the mountain. If a
borrowing were supposed in this case, it would involve us in
unsurmountable difficulties, and these are complicated by the fact that
Hera seems to be older in this place than Zeus.

The name Olympus is certainly one of the many pre-Greek words which the
Greek language took over from the earlier inhabitants of the
country. <span id="fr_450"></span>[34](#fn_450.md) All attempts to find a
probable etymology in connection with Greek words or stems have been
vain. Its very form seems to make its pre-Greek origin probable and its
widespread occurrence in western Asia Minor fits in admirably with this
opinion. The conclusion is warranted that Olympus is a pre-Greek word
signifying "mountain," just as Ida, another mountain name occurring in
Asia Minor and on Crete, has the significance of a forest-clad mountain.

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Both words were
taken over by the Greeks who took possession of the country and were
used by them as names of various mountains.

If this is so, it coincides perfectly with the original character of
Zeus who, being the weather-god, the cloud-gatherer, the rain-giver, and
the thrower of the thunderbolt, always dwells on the loftiest mountain
peak in the neighborhood, around which the clouds gather and from which
rain and thunder break forth. Consequently it is to be assumed that
there existed several mountains with the name of Olympus in Greece, and
thus Zeus was called the Olympian. At last this name was given
principally to the mightiest and loftiest of all, the Thessalian
Olympus, and Homer completed its fame, to the exclusion of others.

Thus we are not compelled to ascribe the origin of the conception of the
mountain of the gods to Thessaly. I cannot but think it to be extremely
improbable that two creations of such a thorough-going importance for
Greek literature and religion as the Homeric epics and the Olympian
State of the Gods should have originated in a province which never had
the least importance in the spiritual life of the Greeks nor was
penetrated by either the Mycenaean or [the](errata.htm#3.md) historical
Greek culture except at a late date and superficially. It seems to be
much more likely on general grounds, and I have tried to prove it with
specific arguments, that the conception of the mountain of the gods and
of the subordination of the other gods under Zeus is an idea common to
all Greeks, just as was the idea of the weather-god dwelling on a
mountain in the neighborhood. From

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

this new starting point we recur to the question of the origin of this
conception. For it is impossible to doubt that the subordination of the
other gods under Zeus was modeled upon the social and historical
conditions of a certain age. We must try to find out which age this is.
Cosmological ideas can have contributed but slightly to its origin.

We have seen that the conception of Olympus, the mountain where the gods
dwell, subject to Zeus, and to which, because of this subordination,
they were lifted up from their natural working and dwelling places, is
pre-Homeric. Thus it is very probable that the model ought to be sought
in the Mycenaean age. Our knowledge of the dark age between the downfall
of the Mycenaean civilization and the new rise of civilization in the
developed Geometric period is very meager, but the poor quality and the
scarcity of archaeological materials from this intermediate age make it
extremely improbable that such a great conception as the coordination of
the gods under a monarchical rule originated in this age.

In the Mycenaean age conditions were different. The great architectural
monuments and the precious works of art testify to the power and the
wealth of the princes of this age. In view of the stately bee-hive tombs
of Mycenae a pharaonic power has been ascribed to the kings of Mycenae.
This opinion is understandable but it is not correct. With the aid of
Homer it is possible to get at a closer and better understanding of the
Mycenaean kingship. I have tried to do that in another place. <span
id="fr_451"></span>[35](#fn_451.md) It ought, however,

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

be observed that here we meet the difficulty which we always meet when
we try to conceive a historical idea of the prehistoric age of Greece:
arguments are not logically binding in the strict sense, we are always
compelled to be content with probabilities and analogies. Whosoever
refuses to believe in them is of course justified: but it is not
justifiable to take up a negative standpoint only. A really historical
mind cannot give up the attempt to form an idea of the social and
political conditions of this age of the greatness of which the monuments
give such an impressive and concrete picture.

I must explain my opinion briefly. The fundamental fact is that the
Mycenaean age was a period of very extensive movements and migrations of
the Greek tribes. Opinions differ as to the time when the Greeks first
invaded Greece. At all events a long time must have elapsed before they
completely possessed themselves of the country. The wandering tribes
went still farther, following the old highway which, along the southern
coast of Asia Minor, led toward the old civilized countries of the Near
East. They colonized the island of Cyprus and appeared in the Delta of
the Nile about 1200 B.C. With this series of events the great Achaean
kingdom, comprising Greece and parts of Asia Minor, would fit in
admirably. Although its existence, which Dr. Forrer believed he had
discovered, is denied, it is but what we should expect under the given
conditions. <span id="fr_452"></span>[36](#fn_452.md)

Many scholars are inclined to think that these migrations were
disconnected raids of small bands of

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

freebooters and adventurers, <span id="fr_453"></span>[37](#fn_453.md) but
that is an idea in which I cannot possibly concur. Such disconnected
raids and small bands would have been dissolved and have vanished
without having such immense consequences as resulted, history proves,
e.g. from the Greek colonization of Pamphylia and Cyprus. If an
organization was wanting, the conditions of these migrations made it
necessary to build one up. A comparison with the migrations of the
Teutonic tribes at the end of the classical period and the beginning of
the Middle Ages and with the expeditions of the Vikings is very valuable
and illuminating. Even the expeditions of the Vikings were not merely
disconnected raids; behind them was the well developed military
organization of the Scandinavian kingdoms, an organization which has
been for the most part unnoticed. The Danish king, Canute the Great,
conquered England, and Swedish chiefs founded the Russian empire of
Kieff. The eastern Teutonic tribes which undertook the most extensive
wanderings developed a much stronger organization of the kingship than
the tribes of western Germany which were more sedentary.

The Teutonic kingship offers a precious analogy to the Greek kingship.
It was hereditary in a certain family. It preserved so much of its
religious origin that the king was held responsible for the luck and
good fortune of his people. (There is a trace of this same idea in
Homer. <span id="fr_454"></span>[38](#fn_454).md) The king was in the first
place a war-king, leader of the military expeditions; he had at his side
a council of chiefs and the

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

assembly of the army, the earliest form of the popular assembly. The
power of the king was small during peace but waxed greatly in war. The
old hereditary Greek kingship is precisely of the same kind, as is
proved by the institutions of Macedonia and Sparta, where it was
preserved.

The Homeric kingship is of the same kind also. Agamemnon is in the first
place a war-king; more over, his kingship is hereditary and invested
with a rather full power. We see that especially in the famous passage
in the second book which is generally recognized as reflecting early
conditions. <span id="fr_455"></span>[39](#fn_455.md) The king appears in
the popular assembly carrying the scepter which Zeus gave to his
ancestor Pelops and which had been handed down through the generations
of the kingly family until Thyestes gave it to Agamemnon to rule over
all Argos and many islands. In view of this passage many scholars have
recognized that Agamemnon was a Great King who held sway over many
vassals. Although the vassals are very obstinate and inclined to quarrel
and to extend their independence, this respect for the king is
ingrained. Old Nestor gives the good counsel to avoid strife with the
king who carries the scepter. <span id="fr_456"></span>[40](#fn_456.md)

At the side of the king we find the assembly of the army, which is
convoked to discuss important matters. The members give voice to their
opinions in speeches or acclamations, but the decision depends on the
king alone; he is able to make a decision which runs counter to the
opinion of the assembly, as

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agamemnon does in
refusing to let Chryses ransom his daughter in spite of the Achaeans'
approval of Chryses' request. <span id="fr_457"></span>[41](#fn_457.md)

The chiefs appear throughout as the king's vassals, although their
stubbornness and endeavors to guard and to extend their independence are
very prominent. How this state of affairs was fostered and promoted is
shown by another consideration. The aim and at the same time the reward
of the war was booty. The king received the lion's share; large parts
were selected for the chiefs; and the men of the people were content to
divide what remained. It is to be observed that in the period during
which the Greeks were taking possession of the country, the booty
consisted not only of implements, cattle, slaves, and so forth, but also
of land and towns. The territory was divided; selected parts were given
to the gods and to the king (they were called *temenos*), and parcels
were divided among the men of the people by allotment; hence they were
called lots (*kleroi*). Certain passages of the Iliad prove that the
king possessed towns which he was able to give over to others. <span
id="fr_458"></span>[42](#fn_458.md) These towns belonged of course to his
part of the booty and he could dispose of them only by giving them to
men whom he trusted and who possessed them as his vassals. The vassals
strove to guard their interests and to enlarge their independence. The
power of the king depended

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

on his energy, and its basis was his retainers, his personal followers.

As long as the wars and military expeditions went on, the duty of the
vassals to follow the king was effective and they were obliged to obey
him. The power of the king was correspondingly great. But when the
military expeditions ceased and people stayed at home each in his town,
the subordination of the vassals to the king was weakened and vanished;
for the organization just sketched was good for war only. The king had
no means of checking the striving of his vassals to assert their
independence. The decay of the kingly power has progressed far in some
parts of the Iliad and still farther in the Odyssey, but we recognize
that this power was once very full.

The Mycenaean monuments teach us in what age kings with such power
existed; witness the stately bee-hive tombs, especially those of Mycenae
which are both imposing and well built; and the wealth of precious
objects in the shaft-graves of Mycenae and in the recently discovered
bee-hive tomb at Dendra near Midea. The large and stately halls of the
palaces are illuminating in regard to daily life. On the floor of the
hall in the palace at Tiryns a separate section is marked off by the
floor painting; it cannot but be the place set apart for the throne of
the king. Each of these princes governed his people but was subject to
the Great King, with whom of course each strove to compete in splendor.
The full power of the Great King of the Mycenaean age, which we
recognize from a comparison between the traces of it left in Homer and
the Mycenaean monuments, supplies precisely the wanted model,

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

which is sought in vain elsewhere, of the power of the King of the Gods.

We return to the State of the Gods. In regard to the Olympian scenes
attention has been especially and unduly directed toward the strife
between the gods, their refractoriness and stubbornness, their attempts
to delude Zeus by ruse, the pride of Zeus in his strength, and the
threats which he showers upon his adversaries. These descriptions are
sometimes tainted with burlesque, a tone due to the Ionian minstrels,
who were fundamentally irreligious. They remodeled earlier myths
according to their taste; e.g. the holy wedding of Zeus and Hera is made
a rather sensual love affair.

Much less has it been noticed that the gods many times show a very great
veneration and respect for their king, and monarchical rule is an
exception in Greece. Due regard ought to be given to these features
also; they are earlier and were partly obliterated by later ideas. When
Zeus enters among the gods gathered on Olympus, nobody dares to remain
on his seat; but they all rise to greet him. <span
id="fr_459"></span>[43](#fn_459.md) They recognize his rule as a
self-evident fact, saying: "Thou rulest among the Immortal ones." <span
id="fr_460"></span>[44](#fn_460.md) There are occasions where the gods obey
his orders without any idea of opposition. Thetis does so when Zeus bids
her go to Achilles and tell him to give over the corpse of Hector to
Priam, <span id="fr_461"></span>[45](#fn_461.md) and Hera when she brings
to Poseidon the order of Zeus to desist from fighting; that, however,
was after she had enticed Zeus into love in order to divert his
attention from

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

the battle. <span id="fr_462"></span>[46](#fn_462.md) Once when Athena and
Hera are on their way to the battle they go back at the command of
Zeus; <span id="fr_463"></span>[47](#fn_463.md) in another chant they make
a visit to Zeus in order to gain permission to take the field against
Ares; <span id="fr_464"></span>[48](#fn_464.md) and later they hold Ares
back from throwing himself into the fight. <span
id="fr_465"></span>[49](#fn_465.md) We hear often how highly the gods fear
and respect Zeus.

It is frequently stated that the reason for this overwhelming power is
the strength of Zeus, and Zeus himself illustrates this by coarse
instances, e.g. the punishment of Hera <span
id="fr_466"></span>[50](#fn_466.md) and the tug of war. <span
id="fr_467"></span>[51](#fn_467.md) Poseidon tells in plain words why he
obeys: Zeus is much stronger than he. <span
id="fr_468"></span>[52](#fn_468.md) But this superior strength is not the
only reason. When Zeus sends the command to Poseidon to desist from
helping the Greeks, he claims not only superior strength but also his
right as the elder brother. <span id="fr_469"></span>[53](#fn_469.md)

The following passage is illuminating. We hear that the sons of Cronus
took possession of their inheritance and divided it; each got his part,
but the earth and Olympus remained, being common property. They were
selected in the same way as was a *temenos*. Poseidon says, just as an
obstinate vassal would, that Zeus ought to be content with the third
part allotted to him; he is of the opinion that Zeus ought to allow the
other gods to act as they please. But Iris reminds him that the Erinyes
always follow

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

the eldest brother--and Poseidon obeys. Zeus has inherited the kingdom
by virtue of his being the eldest brother; this is the moral ground of
his position as ruler.

Close scrutiny shows that the power of Zeus is much greater than that of
Agamemnon, not to speak of the historical Greek kings. He is much more
impatient of opposition, and more veneration is shown to him. How came
Zeus into possession of this full power which of course did not
originally belong to the weather-god? Everyone repeats the phrase that
the model must be sought in human conditions, but nobody has followed
the idea to its logical conclusion. As attention was directed to the
strife of the gods, the fundamental question was forgotten. Why was the
supreme rule attributed to Zeus and why was he invested with such full
kingly power?

This conception lent to the Greek, or more justly to the Homeric, World
of Gods a strictly monarchical constitution, which became later even the
starting point of a kind of monotheism. Nothing similar is found
elsewhere among polytheistic peoples. It is a necessary assumption that
a historical development is behind this conception; i.e., Zeus was not
the supreme god in the beginning; and that he was not is corroborated by
the fact that he does not possess a like supreme position in the Greek
cult and popular belief of a later age. The monarchical constitution of
the State of the Gods is specifically Homeric, and Homer impressed it
upon later generations. These took over the idea but had not the right
appreciation of it. The real ground of the supremacy of Zeus, the right
of the eldest brother, was superseded

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

by a current folk-tale motif, which made Zeus the youngest son of
Cronus, and Hesiod had already made the gods elect Zeus their king after
the victory over the Titans. <span id="fr_470"></span>[54](#fn_470.md) The
forms of Greek political life diverged ever more from those of the State
of the Gods. In the Heavens monarchy prevailed, on the earth the
republic. The attempt of Hesiod to make the State of the Gods follow the
development. of earthly politics failed.

The supreme rule of Zeus is due to a historical development for which
human life presented the model. We do not find the model in Ionia, which
was not united by a monarch but split up into a number of petty cities
ruled by the aristocracy. Nor do we find it in Thessaly, for the power
of the *tagos* is a rather poor and late image of kingly power. Nothing
remains but the mighty war-kings of the age of the great migrations of
the Greek tribes, the Mycenaean age. Only here can such a full kingly
power be presupposed as to correspond to the power of the King of the
Heavens.

The partition of the world by the three sons of Cronus is thought to be
an old cosmogonic myth. This may be true to a certain extent, but
cosmogonic speculations do not explain the manner of the partition. The
sons of Cronus divide the world among themselves in the same manner as
the sons of Aristomachus divided the Peloponnese. It is characteristic
that both the conquered country and the world are considered to be
possessions of the ruling family and are divided among the heirs of the
ruler. As far as we know Greek conditions, this is unthinkable,

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

but in the Mycenaean age, in which the king gave away towns at his
pleasure, it is quite natural.

Other features of the myth will be better understood from this point of
view, if the myth is taken not as free poetical fiction but as a
reflection of life; it is so certainly to a great extent. In the stormy
age of the great migrations of the peoples, there must have occurred
frequently, in the ruling families, strife and contentions which often
had a tragic and gloomy issue; heroic mythology is crowded with such
tales. Zeus possessed himself of his kingship by an act of violence
against his father, and other gods made the attempt to deprive him of
it. The myth that Hera, Poseidon, and Athena tried to fetter him but
that Thetis injected fear into them, fetching the hundred-armed
Briareos, <span id="fr_471"></span>[55](#fn_471.md) resembles strikingly,
if the mythical color is disregarded, a story telling of an attempted
revolt in a kingly family, which was quelled by calling upon foreign
aid.

The other gods appear as the retainers of Zeus whom he summons to
counsel or to meals just as Agamemnon summons the elders. Just as the
war-king summons the army assembly, Zeus summons twice an assembly of
the gods in which even the lesser gods take part. <span
id="fr_472"></span>[56](#fn_472.md) The rivers, and the nymphs of the
springs and of the meadows are mentioned especially. This may be thought
to be a later invention, but it is very noticeable that Poseidon once
does his brother the service of unharnessing his horses; <span
id="fr_473"></span>[57](#fn_473.md) i.e., his relation to Zeus is that of a
"friend"

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

or "servant," as the Iliad calls the retainers of the king. On the other
hand there are of course heralds and servants on Olympus also. The Horae
harness and unharness the horses and give them food and open and shut
the gates of Olympus.

The gods could be conceived as vassals of the supreme god, since they
ruled each over his domain; this conception got the upper hand, since it
corresponded to the subject of the Iliad, the war about Troy, in which
the gods also took part. This conception agreed also with the
inclination of epic poetry to favor the vassals in opposition to their
suzerain. A very common motif of epic poetry is wrath or strife between
two heroes. <span id="fr_474"></span>[58](#fn_474.md) The famous Olympian
scenes are due to this predilection of the minstrels.

The Olympian scenes as they are depicted in detail wear of course partly
the stamp of a later age, that in which nobility ruled the state, but it
is doubtful if the conditions of this period were the model of the
description of Olympus in its essential outlines. Zeus is seated on the
highest peak when he desires to be alone. He has there a magnificent
palace in which the gods assemble for meals and for taking counsel. It
is surrounded by the dwellings of the other gods. The City of the Gods
is surrounded by a wall the gates of which are watched by the Horae.
This picture corresponds of course to the conditions at the beginning of
the historical age of Greece, in which every city had a king whose house
was situated on the acropolis, surrounded by the dwellings

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

of the noblemen; but it corresponds also to the conditions of the
Mycenaean age, in which the stately palace of the king was also situated
on an acropolis and was surrounded by the dwellings of his retainers.
There are other houses than the palace on the acropolis at Mycenae and
at Tiryns. The great number of graves with rich and precious funeral
furniture is a proof of a numerous and well-to-do or even wealthy
population. The picture of the City of the Gods on Olympus may go back
into the Mycenaean age. The idea arose spontaneously as soon as the gods
were transferred to Olympus as subjects of Zeus. A later age took the
picture to be natural and embellished it further. In a well-known
passage of the Odyssey the features of the description are taken from
the Minoan idea of the fields of the Blest. <span
id="fr_475"></span>[59](#fn_475.md)

Opinions may differ in regard to this and other details, but that is
unimportant if only the chief outlines are recognized. I conclude my
argument by summarizing these outlines:

That a monarch was put at the head of the gods is in Greece as well as
in other countries due to political conditions. This idea did not
originate in Greece, as it did in other countries, from the fact that a
city made other cities and their gods subject to its god. In Greece that
god became supreme god who was fittest by virtue of his nature--the
weather-god, the cloud-gatherer and sender of rain and thunder, who
dwelt upon the mountain peaks; that is, upon Olympus. As the other gods
were made his subjects, they were transferred to his dwelling place,
Olympus

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

or the Heavens, from their natural working and dwelling places. The
conception of Olympus as the common dwelling place of the gods
originated in the pre-Homeric age and by the time of the Homeric poetry
had been long established. The model of the monarchical institutions of
the State of the Gods is not to be found in the social and political
institutions of the historical age of Greece, which deviated ever more
from this pattern. Such a full kingly power as that of the supreme god
can be ascribed only to the mighty kings of the Mycenaean age who built
stately palaces and imposing tombs for themselves, were surrounded by a
retinue, and exercised their sovereignty over a number of vassals. In
such conditions the models of the strife and the contentions between the
gods are also to be found. On the whole the monarchical power of Zeus is
such as is found in no other time than the Mycenaean age. The idea of
Olympus and the State of the Gods under a strong monarchical rule
originates in the Mycenaean age.
