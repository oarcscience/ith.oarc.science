**A Monthly Magazine devoted to Philosophy, Science, Religion, Eastern
Thought, Occultism, Theosophy and the Brotherhood of Humanity**.

**The Word** is a magazine appearing monthly, with 64 pages, in large
type, easily readable. It is not intended to furnish additions to the
fugitive literature that fills the market. **The Word** is a magazine
for people who **think**.

Many think; but along what lines? A passing picture, a stray word, a
fugitive thought caught up by them sets in motion a long train of
dreamy, unfashioned, unfinished thoughts. These readers, too, need not
leaf through the pages of **The Word**. **THE WORD** is for the people
who **want to think**.

THE WORD is for the people who want to see. Almost anybody is willing to
look. That is not enough. One must want to look intently, must **want to
see**.

Then it will be seen that this little world floats in an occult world;
nay, is supported on all sides by occult worlds, that occult worlds
reach into it from everywhere and everywhen. For those alone who want to
**consciously see** this and **consciously think** of this, for those
alone **The Word** is published, to those The Word is indeed a HIEROS
LOGOS. It is a store of treasures of incomparable value.

Here for the first time has been published **The Secret Science of the
Zodiac**. Up to August, 1907, thirty-three articles have been written by
an unnamed author on **The Secret Science of the Zodiac**. Facts,
things, truths, of hidden import have been stated here so plainly and
simply that some may now perceive them and their occult meaning and

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

occult value; to the unseeing or unthinking, they remain as unrelated
and unsuspected as ever. THE SECRET SCIENCE OF THE ZODIAC is the
THEOSOPHY OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

The future will bring, as did the past, articles by the Platonist, Dr.
Alexander Wilder, in whose pen is stored up the experience of sixty
years of platonic enthusiasm. The old theosophist, Dr. Franz Hartmann,
author of "Magic, White and Black," and an old time friend of Madame
Blavatsky, will continue to write for **The Word**. Knut M. Pauli will
continue the "Correspondences between the Human Soul, Numbers, Geometry,
Music, Color, Astronomy, Chemistry, and the Human Body," and their
practical application to modern problems. The Kabbalist, Nurho de
Manhar, will continue to translate and comment on the Sepher Ha-Zohar,
or Book of Light, and Eduard Herrmann and T. R. Prater will each
continue his articles and translations from German Mystics. "Our
Magazine Shelf" brings its usual impartial criticism from a theosophical
view of contemporaneous books coming under the subjects to which the
magazine is devoted. "A Friend" will continue "**Moments with
Friends**."

The Word is not an experiment. Examine any of the five volumes which are
completed.
