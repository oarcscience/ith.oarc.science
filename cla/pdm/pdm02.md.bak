# PYTHAGORAS

### CHAPTER I

#### GREECE IN THE SIXTH CENTURY

THE soul of Orpheus had passed like a divine meteor across the troubled
heavens of a new-born Greece. When the meteor had disappeared, the land
was again wrapt in darkness. After a series of revolutions, the tyrants
of Thrace committed his books to the flames, overthrew his temples and
drove away his disciples. The Greek kings and numerous cities followed
this example, more jealous of their unbridled licence than of that
justice which is the source of pure doctrine. They were determined to
efface his very memory, to leave no sign of his existence, and they
succeeded so well, that, a few centuries after his death, a portion of
Greece even doubted whether he had ever lived. It was in vain that the
initiates kept alive his tradition for over a thousand years; in vain
that Pythagoras and Plato spoke of him as

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

divine; the sophists and the rhetoricians saw in him no more than a
legend regarding the origin of music. Even at the present time, savants
stoutly deny the existence of Orpheus, basing their assertion on the
fact that neither Homer nor Hesiod mentioned his name. The silence of
these poets, however, is fully explained by the interdict under which
the local government had placed the great initiator. The disciples of
Orpheus lost no opportunity of rallying all the powers under the supreme
authority of the temple of Delphi, and never tired of repeating that the
differences arising between the divers states of Greece must be laid
before the council of the Amphictyons. This was displeasing to
demagogues and tyrants alike. Homer, who probably received his
initiation in the sanctuary of Tyre, and whose mythology is the poetical
translation of the theology of Sankoniaton, Homer the Ionian might very
well have known nothing of the Dorian Orpheus whose tradition was kept
all the more secret as it was the more exposed to persecution. As
regards Hesiod, who was born near Parnassus, he must have known the name
and doctrine of Orpheus through the temple at Delphi; but silence was
imposed on him by his initiators, and that for good reasons.

And yet Orpheus was living in his work, in his

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

disciples, and even in those who denied his very existence. What is this
work, where can the soul of his life be sought? In the ferocious,
military oligarchy of Sparta, where science was despised, ignorance
erected into a system, and brutality exacted as being the complement of
courage? In those implacable wars of Messenia in which the Spartans were
seen persecuting a neighbouring people to the point of extermination,
and these Romans of Greece preparing for the Tarpeian rock and the
bleeding laurels of the Capitol by hurling the heroic Aristomenes, the
defender of his country, into an abyss? Or should it rather be sought in
the turbulent democracy of Athens, ever ready to convert itself into a
tyranny? Or in the praetorian guard of Pisistratus, or the dagger of
Harmodius and Aristogiton, concealed under a myrtle branch? Or in the
many towns and cities of Hellas, of greater Greece and Asia Minor, of
which Athens and Sparta offer us two opposing types? Is it in all these
envious, these jealous democracies and tyrannies ever ready to tear one
another into pieces?—No; the soul of Greece is not there. It is in her
temples, her mysteries and their initiates. It is in the sanctuary of
Jupiter at Olympia, of Juno at Argos, of Ceres at Eleusis; it reigns
over Athens with Minerva, it sheds its beams over Delphi with

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Apollo, who
penetrates every temple with his light. Here is the centre of Hellenic
life, the heart and brain of Greece. Here come for instruction poets who
translate sublime truth into living images for the masses, sages who
propagate these truths in subtle dialectics. The spirit of Orpheus is
felt wherever beats the heart of immortal Greece. We find it in poetry
and gymnastic contests, in the Delphic and Olympian games, a glorious
project instituted by the successors of the Master with the object of
drawing nearer together and uniting the twelve Greek tribes. We are
brought into direct contact with it in the court of the Amphictyons, in
that assembly of the great initiates, a supreme, arbitrary tribunal,
which met at Delphi, a mighty centre of justice and concord, in which
alone Greece recovered her unity in times of heroism and
abnegation. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

And yet Greece in the time of Orpheus; her intellect, an unsullied,
temple-guarded doctrine; her soul, a plastic religion; and her body, a
lofty

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

court of justice with Delphi as its centre, had begun to decline early
in the seventh century. The orders sent out from Delphi were no longer
respected, the sacred territories were violated. The race of men of
mighty inspiration had disappeared, the intellectual and moral tone of
the temples deteriorated; the priests sold themselves to politicians.
From that time the Mysteries themselves became corrupted.

The general aspect of Greece had changed. The old sacerdotal and
agricultural royalty was succeeded either by tyranny pure and simple, by
military aristocracy, or by anarchical democracy. The temples had become
powerless to check the threatening ruin. A new helper was needed. It was
therefore necessary to popularize esoteric teaching. To enable the
thought of Orpheus to live and expand in all its beauty, the knowledge
of the temples must pass over to the lay classes. Accordingly, under
different disguises, it penetrated the brains of civil legislators, the
schools of the poets, and the porticoes of the philosophers. The latter
felt in their teachings the very necessity Orpheus had recognized in
religion, that of two doctrines: the one public and the other secret,
manifesting the same truth in different degree and form, and suited to
the development of the pupil. This evolution

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

gave Greece her three great centuries of artistic creation and
intellectual splendour. It permitted the Orphic thought, at once the
initial impulse and the ideal synthesis of Greece, to concentrate its
entire light and radiate it over the whole world, before her political
edifice, undermined by internal dissensions, tottered beneath the power
of Macedonia and finally crumbled away under the iron hand of Rome.

Many contributed to the evolution we are speaking of. It brought out
natural philosophers like Thales, legislators like Solon, poets like
Pindar, and heroes like Epaminondas. It had also a recognized head, an
initiate of the very first rank, a sovereign, organizing, creating
intelligence. Pythagoras is the master of lay as Orpheus is the master
of sacerdotal Greece. He translates and continues the religious thought
of his predecessor, applying it to the new times. His translation,
however, is a creation, for he co-ordinates the Orphic inspirations into
a complete system, gives scientific proof of them in his teachings and
moral proof in his institute of education, and in the Pythagorean order
which survived him.

Although appearing in the full light of historical times, Pythagoras has
come down to us as almost a legendary character. The main reason for
this is

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

the terrible persecution of which he was the victim in Sicily, and which
cost so many of his followers their lives. Some were crushed to death
beneath the ruins of their burning schools, others died of hunger in
temples. The Master's memory and teaching were only perpetuated by such
survivors as were able to escape into Greece. Plato, at great trouble
and cost, obtained through Archytas a manuscript of the Master, who, it
must be mentioned, never transferred to writing his esoteric teachings
except under symbols and secret characters. His real work, like that of
all reformers, was effected by oral instruction. The essence of the
system, however, comes down to us in the *Golden Verses* of Lysis, the
commentary of Hierocles, fragments of Philolaus and in the Timaeus of
Plato, which contains the cosmogony of Pythagoras. To sum up, the
writers of antiquity are full of the spirit of the Croton philosopher.
They never tire of relating anecdotes depicting his wisdom and beauty,
his marvellous power over men. The Neoplatonists of Alexandria, the
Gnostics, and even the early Fathers of the Church quote him as an
authority. These are precious witnesses through whom may be felt
continually vibrating that mighty wave of enthusiasm the great
personality of Pythagoras succeeded in communicating to Greece, the
final

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

eddies of which were still to be felt eight hundred years after his
death.

His teaching, regarded from above, and unlocked with the keys of
comparative esoterism, affords a magnificent whole, the different parts
of which are bound together by one fundamental conception. In it we find
a rational reproduction of the esoteric teaching of India and Egypt,
which he illumined with Hellenic simplicity and clearness, giving it a
stronger sentiment and a clearer idea of human liberty.

At the same time and at different parts of the globe, mighty reformers
were popularizing similar doctrines. Lao-Tse in China was emerging from
the esoterism of Fo-Hi; the last Buddha Sakya-Mouni was preaching on the
banks of the Ganges; in Italy, the Etrurian priesthood sent to Rome an
initiate possessed of the Sibylline books. This was King Numa, who, by
wise institutions, attempted to check the threatening ambition of the
Roman Senate. It was not by chance that these reformers appeared
simultaneously among such different peoples. Their diverse missions had
one common end in view. They prove that, at certain periods, one
identical spiritual current passes mysteriously through the whole of
humanity. Whence comes it? It has its source in that divine world, far
away

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

from human vision, but of which prophets and seers are the envoys and
witnesses.

Pythagoras crossed the whole of the ancient world before giving his
message to Greece. He saw Africa and Asia, Memphis and Babylon, along
with their methods of initiation and political life. His own troubled
life resembles a ship driving through a storm, pursuing its course, with
sails unfurled, a symbol of strength and calmness in the midst of the
furious elements. His teachings convey the impression of a cool fragrant
night after the bitter fire and passion of an angry, blood-stained day.
They call to mind the beauty of the firmament unrolling, by degrees, its
sparkling archipelagoes and ethereal harmonies over the head of the
seer.

And now we will attempt to set forth both his life and his teaching
apart from the obscurities of legend and the prejudices of the schools
alike.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[6:1](pdm02.htm#fr_0.md) The *Amphictyonic oath* of
the allied peoples gives some idea of the greatness and social might of
this institution: 'We swear that we will never overthrow Amphictyonic
towns, never, during either peace or war, prevent them from obtaining
whatever is necessary for their needs. Should any power dare to attempt
this, we will march against it and destroy its towns. Should impious
hands remove the offerings of the temple of Apollo, we swear that we
will use our feet, our arms, our voice, and all our strength against
them and their accomplices."
