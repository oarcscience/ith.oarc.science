*An eandem Romanis in bello virtutem quam in pace lasciviam adesse
creditis?*  
("Do you suppose that the Romans will be as brave in war as they are
licentious in peace?")  
     --[Agricola 30:32](ag01030.htm#ag_01_032.md)

This is the complete set of Church and Brodribb translations of Tacitus;
this etext includes parallel English and Latin text. Gaius Cornelius
Tacitus (56?-117 CE), writer, orator, lawyer, and senator, was one of
the greatest historians of antiquity. His Annals and Histories are a
panorama of first century Rome, from Tiberius to Domitian. His prose
style is in the first tier of Latin writers. Tacitus presents a vivid
picture of the high-water point of the Roman empire, and does not gloss
over the toxic corruption and brutality of the time.

Little is known about the origins and biography of Tacitus. Although
"Tacitus" means silent, ironically he was known for his oratory. He was
probably born into an aristocratic family in what is now the south of
France. He studied rhetoric in Rome as a young man, and married into the
family of the general Agricola. Advancing in the social hierarchy, he
entered the Senate at the close of the first century.

We have five surviving works by Tacitus, with some notable large gaps in
the two major texts (Annals and Histories). In chronological order these
are: De vita Iulii Agricolae (The Life of Julius Agricola) \[98 CE\]; De
origine et situ Germanorum (The Germania) \[98 CE\]; Dialogus de
oratoribus (Dialogue on Oratory) \[102 CE\]; Historiae (Histories) \[105
CE\]; and Ab excessu divi Augusti (Annals) \[117 CE\]. Histories, of
which we have the first four books and part of the fifth book, covers
the events of the years 69-70 CE. The last fragmentary book of Histories
(5:2) has a [description of the Jews](h05000.htm#h_05_002.md) just prior to
the Great Jewish Revolt and subsequent Diaspora. Annals, his final work,
comprised 16 books originally, but a large portion of it was lost. It
begins at the death of Augustus Caesar, and runs from the ascension of
Tiberius up to Nero. The Annals include a notable passage which begins
with [Nero 'fiddling' while Rome burned](a15030.htm#a_15_039) (15:39.md),
and then [one of the earliest historical records of
Christians](a15040.htm#a_15_044) (15:44.md), scapgoated by Nero for the
catastrophic fire. Germany is one of the longest contemporary
ethnographic accounts of the ancient Germans. Agricola is a biography of
his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, who governed Britain, with
interesting bits of information on first century England, including [the
revolt of Boadicea](ag01010.htm#ag_01_016.md). Oratory is a short discourse
on rhetoric.

PRODUCTION NOTES: The Church and Brodribb translations of Tacitus were
published by Macmillan in London in a series of editions between 1864
and 1877. There have been numerous subsequent reprints. These
translations are in the public domain in the United States because they
were published prior to January 1st, 1923. The electronic text of their
translation of Annals and History, as well as the Latin etext of all of
Tacitus, were already available. These are presented here with minor
corrections and adjustment of paragraph numbering in a few cases so that
the English and Latin match up. The English etexts of the three minor
works (Germany, Agricola, and Oratory) were newly scanned, proofed and
formatted at Intangible Textual Heritage for this presentation. The
parallel English/Latin text formatting was created using a custom C
program at Intangible Textual Heritage based on data files extracted
from the various electronic texts.

The 1942 Modern Library edition of Church and Brodribb was used as the
copytext for the minor works and to correct problems in the existing
etexts of the major works. Although there is a copyright renewal on this
edition, the copyright office records (original 16Mar42; A162480,
renewed 25Jul69; R466487) limit the copyright to 'NM \[New Material\]:
pref., introd., chronology & glossary of place names.' None of said
identified new material was included in this electronic version.
