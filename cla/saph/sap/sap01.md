### SAPPHO AND PHAON

# PREFACE.

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> must strike every admirer of poetical
compositions, that the modern sonnet, concluding with two lines, winding
up the sentiment of the whole, confines the poet's fancy, and frequently
occasions an abrupt termination of a beautiful and interesting picture;
and that the ancient, or what is generally denominated, the <span
class="smallcaps">Legitimate Sonnet</span>, may be carried on in a
series of sketches, composing, in parts, one historical or imaginary
subject, and forming in the whole a complete and connected story. With
this idea, I have ventured to compose the following collection; not
presuming to offer them as imitations of <span
class="smallcaps">Petrarch</span>, but as specimens of that species of
sonnet writing, so seldom attempted in the English language; though
adopted by that sublime Bard, whose Muse produced the grand epic of
Paradise Lost, and the humbler effusion, which I produce as an example
of the measure to which I allude, and which is termed by the most
classical writers, the legitimate sonnet.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy spray  
Warblest at eve, when all the woods are still,  
Thou with fresh hope the lover’s heart dost fill,  
While the jolly hours lead on propitious May.  
Thy liquid notes that close the eye of day  
First heard before the shallow cuccoo’s bill,  
Portend succes in love; O if Jove’s will  
Have link’d that amorous power to thy soft lay,  
Now timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate  
Foretel my hopeless doom in some grove nigh,  
As thou from year to year hast sung too late  
For my relief, yet hadst no reason why:  
Whether the Muse, or Love call thee his mate,  
Both them I serve, and of their train am I.</span>

</div>

To enumerate the variety of authors who have written sonnets of all
descriptions, would be endless; indeed few of them deserve notice: and
where, among the heterogeneous mass of insipid and laboured efforts,
sometimes a bright gem sheds lustre on the page of poesy, it scarcely
excites attention, owing to the disrepute in which sonnets are fallen.
So little is rule attended to by many, who profess the art of poetry,
that I have seen a composition of more than thirty lines, ushered into
the world under the name of Sonnet, and that, from the pen of a writer,
whose classical taste ought to have avoided such a misnomer. Doctor
Johnson describes a Sonnet, as "a short poem, consisting of fourteen
lines, of which the rhymes are adjusted by a particular rule." He
further adds, "It has not been used by any man of eminence since <span
class="smallcaps">Milton</span>." Sensible of the extreme difficulty I
shall have to encounter, in offering to the world a little wreath,
wreath, gathered in that path, which, even the best poets have thought
it dangerous to tread; and knowing that the English language is, of all
others, the least congenial to such an undertaking, (for, I believe,
that the construction of this kind of sonnet was originally in the
Italian, where the vowels are used almost every other letter,) I only
point out the track where more able pens may follow with success; and
where the most classical beauties may be adopted, and drawn forth with
peculiar advantage. Sophisticated sonnets are so common, for every
rhapsody of rhyme, from six lines to sixty comes under that
denomination, that the eye frequently turns from this species of poem
with disgust. Every school-boy, every romantic scribbler, thinks a
sonnet a task of little difficulty. From this ignorance in some, and
vanity in others, we see the monthly and diurnal publications abounding
with ballads, odes, elegies, epitaphs, and allegories, the non-descript
ephemera from the heated brains of self-important poetasters, all
ushered into notice under the appellation of <span
class="smallcaps">Sonnet</span>! I confess myself such an enthusiastic
votary of the Muse, that any innovation which seems to threaten even the
least of her established rights, makes me tremble, lest that chaos of
dissipated pursuits which has too long been growing like an overwhelming
shadow, and menacing the lustre of intellectual light, should, aided by
the idleness of some, and the profligacy of others, at last obscure the
finer mental powers, and reduce the dignity of talents to the lowest
degradation. As poetry has the power to raise, so has it also the magic
to refine. The ancients considered the art of such importance, that
before they led forth their heroes to the most glorious enterprizes,
they animated them by the recital of grand and harmonious compositions.
The wisest scrupled not to reverence the invocations of minds, graced
with the charm of numbers: so mystically fraught are powers said to be,
which look beyond the surface of events, that an admired and classical
writer, describing the inspirations of the <span
class="smallcaps">Muse</span>, thus expresses his opinion:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">So when remote futurity is brought  
Before the keen inquiry of her thought,  
A terrible sagacity informs  
The Poet's heart, he looks to distant storms,  
He hears the thunder ere the tempest low’rs,  
And, arm’d with strength surpassing human pow’rs,  
Seizes events as yet unknown to man,  
And darts his soul into the dawning plan.  
Hence in a Roman mouth the graceful name  
Of Prophet and of Poet was the same,  
Hence British poets too the priesthood shar’d,  
And ev’ry hallow’d druid—was a bard."</span>

</div>

That poetry ought to be cherished as a national ornament, cannot be more
strongly exemplified than in the simple fact, that, in those centuries
when the poets’ laurels have been most generously fostered in Britain,
the minds and manners of the natives have been most polished and
enlightened. Even the language of a country refines into purity by the
elegance of numbers: the strains of <span
class="smallcaps">Waller</span> have done more to effect that, then all
the labours of monkish pedantry, since the days of druidical mystery and
superstition. Though different minds are variously affected by the
infinite diversity of harmonious effusions, there are, I believe, very
few that are wholly insensible to the powers of poetic compositions.
Cold must that bosom be, which can resist the magical versification of
Eloisa to Abelard; and torpid to all the more exalted sensations of the
soul is that being, whose ear is not delighted by the grand and sublime
effusions of the divine Milton! The romantic chivalry of Spencer
vivifies the imagination; while the plaintive sweetness of Collins
soothes and penetrates the heart. How much would Britain have been
defecit in a comparison with other countries on the scale of
intellectual grace, had these poets never existed! yet it is a
melancholy truth, that here, where the attributes of genius have been
diffused by the liberal hand of nature, almost to prodigality, there has
not been, during a long series of years, the smallest mark of public
distinction bestowed on literary talents. Many individuals, whose works
are held in the highest estimation, now that their ashes sleep in the
sepulchre, were, when living, suffered to languish, and even to perish,
in obscure poverty: as if it were the peculiar fate of genius, to be
neglected while existing, and only honoured when the consciousness of
inspiration is vanished for ever. The ingenious mechanic has the
gratification of seeing his labours patronized, and is rewarded for his
invention while he has the powers of enjoying its produce. But the
Poet's life is one perpetual scene of warfare: he is assailed by envy,
stung by malice, and wounded by the fastidious comments of concealed
assassins. The more eminently beautiful his compositions are, the larger
is the phalanx he has to encounter; for the enemies of genius are
multitudinous. It is the interest of the ignorant and powerful, to
suppress the effusions of enlightened minds: when only monks could
write, and nobles read, authority rose triumphant over fright; and the
slave, spell-bound in ignorance, hugged his fetters without repining. It
was then that the best powers of reason lay buried like the gem in the
dark mine; by a slow and tedious progress they have been drawn forth,
and must, ere long, diffuse an universal lustre: for that era is rapidly
advancing, when talents will tower like an unperishable column, while
the globe will be strewed with the wrecks of superstition. As it was the
opinion of the ancients, that poets possessed the powers of prophecy,
the name was consequently held in the most unbounded veneration. In less
remote periods the bard has been publicly distinguished; princes and
priests have bowed before the majesty of genius: Petrarch was crowned
with laurels, the noblest diadem, in the Capitol of Rome: his admirers
were liberal, his contemporaries were just; and his name will stand upon
record, with the united and honourable testimony of his own talents, and
the generosity of his country. It is at once a melancholy truth, and a
national disgrace, that this Island, so profusely favored by nature,
should be marked, of all enlightened countries, as the most neglectful
of literary merit! and I will venture to believe, that there are both
<span class="smallcaps">Poets</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Philosophers</span>, now living in Britain, who, had
they been born in any other clime, would have been honoured with the
proudest distinctions, and immortalized to the latest posterity. I
cannot conclude these opinions without paying tribute to the talents of
my illustrious country-women; who, unpatronized by the courts, and
unprotected by the powerful, persevere in the paths of literature, and
ennoble themselves by the unperishable lustre of <span
class="smallcaps">Mental Pre-Eminence</span>! <span class="smallcaps">To
the Reader</span>.

The story of the <span class="smallcaps">Lesbian Muse</span>, though not
new to the classical reader, presented to my imagination such a lively
example of the human mind, enlightened by the most exquisite talents,
yet yielding to the destructive controul of ungovernable passions, that
I felt an irresistible impulse to attempt the delineation of their
progress; mingling with the glowing picture of her soul, such moral
reflections, as may serve to exite that pity, which, while it proves the
susceptibility of the heart, arms it against the danger of indulging too
luxuriant fancy. The unfortunate lovers, Heloise and Abelard; and, the
supposed platonic, Petrarch and Laura, have found panegyrists in many
distinguished authors. <span class="smallcaps">Ovid</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Pope</span> have celebrated the passion of Sappho for
Phaon; but their portraits, however beautifully finished, are replete
with shades, tending rather to depreciate than to adorn the Grecian
Poetess. I have endeavoured to collect, in the succeeding pages, the
most liberal accounts of that illustrious woman, whose fame has
transmitted to us some fragments of her works, through many dark ages,
and for the space of more than two thousand years. The merit of her
compositions must have been indisputable, to have left all cotemporary
female writers in obscurity; for it is known, that poetry was, at the
period in which she lived, held in the most sacred veneration; and that
those who were gifted with that divine inspiration, were ranked as the
first class of human beings. Among the many Grecian writers, Sappho was
the unrivalled poetess of her time: the envy she excited, the public
honours she received, and the fatal passion which terminated her
existence, will, I trust, create that sympathy in the mind of the
susceptible reader, which may render the following poetical trifles not
wholly uninteresting.
