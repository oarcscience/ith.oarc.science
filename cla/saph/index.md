# Sappho
<title>Intangible Textual Heritage: Sappho</title>

Usually paired with Homer as one of the two greatest ancient Greek
poets, Sappho's poety has come down to us only in fragments. Even these
fragments are so evocative, however, that Sappho has become a mirror
which each generation uses to reinterpret the question: "What is
erotic?"
