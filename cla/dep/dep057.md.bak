### CHAPTER XXV

#### HOW THE ART OF REASONING IS NECESSARY

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> one of his audience said, 'Convince
me that logic is useful,' he said,

And, when the other agreed, he said, How then shall you know if I impose

yourself admit that logic is necessary, if without it you are not even
able to learn this much—whether it is necessary or not.
