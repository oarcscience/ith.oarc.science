# ARRIAN'S DISCOURSES OF EPICTETUS

### PREFACE

#### ARRIANUS TO LUCIUS GELLIUS GREETING

<span class="smallcaps">I did</span> not write down the Lectures of
Epictetus in the form of a book, as one might do with such utterances as
his, nor did I of my own will give them to the public, for, as I say, I
did not write them down for publication. What I tried to do was to make
notes of all that I used to hear him say word for word in the very
language he used, so far as possible, and to preserve his sayings as
reminders for myself hereafter of the nature of his mind and the
directness of his speech. It follows then, as is natural, that the words
are just such as a man might use to another on the impulse of the
moment, not such as he would write for formal publication, with a view
to a circle of readers hereafter. Moreover, such as they are, somehow or
other they were put abroad among men without my consent and without my
knowledge. Well, to me it is no great matter, if I appear in the world's
eyes incapable of writing a book; and to Epictetus it will not matter in
the least if men despise his lectures, for in the very act of giving
them he made it plain that his one and only desire was to impel the
minds of his hearers towards the noblest objects. If then these lectures
should accomplish this result and no other, I take it they would be just
what the lectures of philosophers ought to be; and if they fail, yet I
would have those who read them understand that when Epictetus himself
was speaking, his hearers were forced to feel just what he would have
them feel. If the words read by themselves do not achieve this result,
it may be that I am to blame, but it may be also that it could not be
otherwise. Farewell.
