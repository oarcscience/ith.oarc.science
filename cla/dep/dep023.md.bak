### CHAPTER XXII

#### ON PRIMARY CONCEPTIONS <span id="fr_12"></span>[1-13](dep032.htm#fn_12.md)

<span class="smallcaps">Primary</span> conceptions are common to all
men, and one does not conflict with another. Who among us, for instance,
does not assume that the

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

good is expedient and desirable and that we ought in all circumstances
to follow and pursue it? Which of us does not assume that the just is
noble and becoming?

At what moment then does conflict arise? It arises in the application of
primary conceptions to particular facts; when for instance one says, 'He
has done well: he is brave,' and another, 'Nay, he is out of his mind.'
Hence arises the conflict of men with one another. Such is the conflict
between Jews and Syrians and Egyptians and Romans—not the question
whether holiness must be put before all things and must in all
circumstances be pursued, but whether it is holy or unholy to eat of
swine's flesh. Such you will find is the conflict between
[Agamemnon](errata.htm#0.md) and Achilles. Call them to come forward.

What do you say, Agamemnon? Do you say that what is right and noble
ought not to be done?

'Of course it ought.'

And what do you say, Achilles? Do you not approve of doing what is
noble?

'Nay, I approve of it above all things.'

Now apply these primary notions: and here the conflict begins. One says,
'I ought not to give back Chryseis to her father.' The other says, 'Nay,
you ought.' Certainly one or other of them wrongly applies the primary
notion of right. Again one says, 'Well, if I must give back Chryseis, I
must take the prize from one of you': the other says, 'What, take away
my beloved?' 'Yes, yours,' he says. 'Am I alone then to be the loser?'
'But am I alone to have nothing?' So a conflict arises.

In what then does education consist? In learning to apply the natural
primary conceptions to particular occasions in accordance with nature,
and further to distinguish between things in our power and things not in
our power. In our power are will and all operations of the will, and
beyond our power are the body, the parts of the body, possessions,
parents, brothers, children, country, in a word—those whose society we
share. Where then are we to place 'the good'? To what class of things
shall we apply it?

'To what is in our power.'

Does it follow then that health and a whole body, and life are not good,
nor children, parents, and country? No one will bear with you if you say
that. Let us then transfer the name 'good' to this class of things. Is
it possible for a man to be happy if he is injured and fails to win good
things?

'It is impossible.'

Can he also find the proper way to live with his fellows? Nay, how is it
possible? For instance, I incline by nature to my true interest. If it
is my interest to have a field, it is also my interest to take it away

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

from my neighbour: if it is my interest to have a robe, it is my
interest also to steal it from the bath. This is the source of wars,
factions, tyrannies, plots.

Again, how shall I be able to observe what is fitting towards Zeus, for
if I am injured or unfortunate, he heeds me not? So one hears, 'What
have I to do with him, if he cannot help me?' and again, 'What have I to
do with him, if he wills that I should be as I am now?' It follows that
I begin to hate him. Why then do we build temples and make images to
Zeus as if he were an evil genius, as if he were Fever? How can we give
him any more the name Saviour, Rain-giver, and Fruit-giver? Surely if we
place the true nature of the good in outward things, all these
consequences follow.

What are we to do then? This is the search to be made by the true
student of philosophy, who is in travail with truth. These are his
thoughts: 'I do not see what is good and what evil. Am I not mad? I am.'
But if I put 'the good' in the region of things that my will controls,
every one will laugh at me. Some grey-haired old man will arrive, with
many gold rings on his fingers: then he will shake his head and say,
'Listen to me, my child: you must study philosophy, but you must keep a
cool head too. All that talk is folly. You learn the syllogism from
philosophers, but you know better than the philosophers what you ought
to do.'

Fellow, why do you rebuke me then, if I know it? What am I to say to
this slave? If I am silent, he bursts with anger. One ought to say,
'Pardon me as you would pardon lovers. I am not my own master. I am
mad.'
