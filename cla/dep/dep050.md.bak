### CHAPTER XVIII

#### HOW WE MUST STRUGGLE AGAINST IMPRESSIONS

<span class="smallcaps">Every</span> habit and every faculty is
confirmed and strengthened by the corresponding acts, the faculty of
walking by walking, that of running by running. If you wish to have a
faculty for reading, read; if for writing, write. When you have not read
for thirty days on end, but have done something else, you will know what
happens. So if you lie in bed for ten days, and then get up and try to
take a fairly long walk, you will see how your legs lose their power. So
generally if you wish to acquire a habit for anything, do the thing; if
you do not wish to acquire the habit, abstain from doing it, and acquire
the habit of doing something else instead. The same holds good in things
of the mind: when you are angry; know that you have not merely done ill,
but that you have strengthened the habit, and, as it were, put fuel on
the fire. When you yield to carnal passion you must take account not
only of this one defeat, but of the fact that you have fed your
incontinence and strengthened it. For habits and faculties are bound to
be affected by the corresponding actions; they are either implanted if
they did not exist before, or strengthened and intensified if they were
there already. This is exactly how philosophers say that morbid habits
spring up in the mind. For when once you conceive a desire for money, if
reason is applied to make you realize the evil, the desire is checked
and the Governing

Principle recovers its first power; but if you give it no medicine to
heal it, it will not return to where it was, but when stimulated again
by the appropriate impression it kindles to desire quicker than before.
And if this happens time after time it ends by growing hardened, and the
weakness confirms the avarice in a man. For he who has a fever and gets
quit of it is not in the same condition as before he had it, unless he
has undergone a complete cure. The same sort of thing happens with
affections of the mind. They leave traces behind them like weals from a
blow, and if a man does not succeed in removing them, when he is flogged
again on the same place his weals turn into sores. If, then, you wish
not to be choleric, do not feed the angry habit, do not add fuel to the
fire. To begin with, keep quiet, and count the days when you were not
angry. I used to be angry every day, then every other day, then every
three days, then every four. But if you miss thirty days, then sacrifice
to God: for the habit is first weakened and then wholly destroyed.

I kept free from distress to-day, and again next day, and for two or
three months after; and when occasions arose to provoke it, I took pains
to check it.

Know that you are doing well.

To-day when I saw a handsome woman I did not say to myself, 'Would that
she were mine!' and 'Blessed is her husband!' For he who says that will
say, 'Blessed is the adulterer!' Nor do I picture the next scene: the
woman present and disrobing and reclining by my side. I pat myself on
the head and say, 'Bravo, Epictetus, you have refuted a pretty fallacy,
a much prettier one than the so-called "Master"'. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[2-9](dep059.htm#fn_23.md) And if, though the woman
herself, poor thing, is willing and beckons and sends to me, and even
touches me and comes close to me, I still hold aloof and conquer: the
refutation of this fallacy is something greater than the argument of
'The Liar', or the 'Resting' argument. This is a thing to be really
proud of, rather than of propounding the 'Master' argument.

How, then, is this to be done? Make up your mind at last to please your
true self, make up your mind to appear noble to God; set your desires on
becoming pure in the presence of your pure self and God. 'Then when an
impression of that sort assails you', says Plato \[*Laws*, 854b\], 'go
and offer expiatory sacrifices, go as a suppliant and sacrifice to the
gods who avert evil': it is enough even if 'you withdraw to the society
of the good and noble' and set yourself to compare them with yourself,
whether your pattern be among the living or the dead. Go to Socrates and
see him reclining with Alcibiades and making light of his beauty.
Consider what a victory, what an Olympic triumph, he won over
himself—and knew it—what place he thus achieved among the

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

followers of Heracles! a victory that deserves the salutation, 'Hail,
admirable victor, who hast conquered something more than these worn-out
boxers and pancratiasts and the gladiators who are like them!' If you
set these thoughts against your impression, you will conquer it, and not
be carried away by it. But first of all do not be hurried away by the
suddenness of the shock, but say, 'Wait for me a little, impression. Let
me see what you are, and what is at stake: let me test you'. And,
further, do not allow it to go on picturing the next scene. If you do,
it straightway carries you off whither it will. Cast out this filthy
impression and bring in some other impression, a lovely and noble one,
in its place. I say, if you acquire the habit of training yourself thus,
you will see what shoulders you get, what sinews, what vigour; but now
you have only paltry words and nothing more.

The man who truly trains is he who disciplines himself to face such
impressions. Stay, unhappy man! be not carried away. Great is the
struggle, divine the task; the stake is a kingdom, freedom, peace, an
unruffled spirit. Remember God, call Him to aid and support you, as
voyagers call in storm to the Dioscuri. Can any storm be greater than
that which springs from violent impressions that drive out reason? For
what is storm itself but an impression? Take away the fear of death, and
you may bring as much thunder and lightning as you will, and you will
discover what deep peace and tranquillity is in your mind. But if you
once allow yourself to be defeated and say that you will conquer
hereafter, and then do the same again, be sure that you will be weak and
miserable; you will never notice hereafter that you are going wrong, but
will even begin to provide excuses for your conduct: and then you will
confirm the truth of Hesiod's words, 'A dilatory man is ever wrestling
with calamities'. \[*Works and Days*, 413\]
