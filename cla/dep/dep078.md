### CHAPTER XIX

#### WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PHILOSOPHER AND THE UNEDUCATED MAN

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> first difference between the
philosopher and the uneducated man is that the latter says, 'Woe is me
for my child, for my brother, woe is me for my father', and the other,
if he is compelled to speak, considers the matter and says, Woe is me
for myself.' For nothing outside the will can hinder or harm the will;
it can only harm itself. If then we accept this, and, when things go
amiss, are inclined to blame ourselves, remembering that judgement alone
can disturb our peace and constancy, I swear to you by all the gods that
we have made progress.

Instead of this we have come the wrong way from the beginning. When we
were still children, if we stumbled when we were star-gazing, the nurse,
instead of rebuking us, struck the stone. What is wrong with the stone?
Was it to move out of the way because of your child's folly? Again, if
(when children) we do not find something to eat after our bath our
attendant does not check our appetite, but flogs the cook. Man, did we
appoint you to attend on the cook? No, on our child: correct him, do him
good. So even when we are grown up we appear like children: for it is
being a child to be unmusical in musical things, ungrammatical in
grammar, uneducated in life.
