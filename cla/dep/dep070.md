### CHAPTER XI

#### SCATTERED SAYINGS

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> are certain punishments ordained as
it were by law for those who disobey the government of God. Whoever
judges anything to be good except what depends upon the will, let him be
liable to envy, desire, flattery, distraction. Whoever judges anything
else to be evil (save acts of the will), let distress be his, and
mourning, lamentation, misfortune. And yet, though we suffer punishments
so severe, we cannot refrain.

Remember what the poet says about the stranger:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Stranger, though baser man than thou should come,  
He must be honoured, for the hand of Zeus  
Guards stranger folk and poor*.  
                                        \[Homer, *Odyssey*, XIV. 56\]

</div>

One should be ready to apply this to a father: 'Though a baser one than
thou should come, I may not dishonour a father; for all depend on Zeus,
God of our fathers', and to a brother, 'for all depend on Zeus, God of
kindred'. In the same way we shall find that Zeus is Protector of all
other relations of life.
