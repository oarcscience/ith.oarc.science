### CHAPTER XIII

#### HOW ONE MAY ACT IN ALL THINGS SO AS TO PLEASE THE GODS.

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> some one asked Epictetus how one may
eat so as to please the gods, he said, If you can eat justly, and with
good feeling and, it may be, with self-control and modesty, may you not
also eat so as to please the gods? And when you call for hot water and
the slave does not answer, or answers and brings it luke-warm, or is not
to be found in the house, is it not pleasing to the gods that you should
not be angry nor break into a passion?

'How then is one to bear with such persons?'

forefather, and is born as a son of the same seed as you and of the same

heavenly descent? You were appointed to a place of superiority like
this, and are you straightway going to constitute yourself a despot?
Will you not remember what you are and whom you are ruling? that they
are kinsmen, born your brothers, children of Zeus?

'But I have bought them, and they have not bought me.'

Do you see where your eyes are looking? You are looking at the earth, at
what is lowest and basest, <span id="fr_8"></span>[1-9](dep032.htm#fn_8.md)
at these miserable laws of the dead, and you regard not the laws of the
gods.
