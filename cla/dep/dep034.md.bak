### CHAPTER II

#### ON PEACE OF MIND

<span class="smallcaps">Consider</span>, you who are going into court,
what you want to maintain and where you want to end: for if you want to
maintain your freedom of will in its natural condition, you have all
security and facility to do so, and your trouble is over. If you wish to
maintain authority over what is in your power and to keep it naturally
free, and if you are content with this, what more need you attend to?
For who is master of this, who can take it away from you? If you wish to
be a man of honour and trust, who will forbid you? If you wish not to be
hindered or compelled, what man will compel you to will to get what is
against your judgement, and to will to avoid things that you do not
think proper to avoid?

What can he do then? He will cause you troubles which seem to you
formidable: but how can he make you will to avoid what is done to you?
As long then as you retain in your control the will to get and the will
to avoid, you need attend to nothing else. This is your introduction,
this

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

your narrative, this your proof, this your victory, this your
peroration, this your ground of boasting.

That is why Socrates, in reply to one who reminded him to make ready for
the court, said: 'Do you not think my whole life is a preparation for
this?'

What kind of preparation?

'I have maintained', said he, 'what is my own.'

What do you mean?

'I never did an unjust act in my private or in my public life.'
\[Xenophon, *Apologia Socratis*, 2, 3\]

But if you wish to keep what is outside you as well—your paltry body,
and goods, and reputation—I advise you to begin this moment to make all
possible preparation, and further to study the character of your judge
and your opponent. If you must clasp his knees, clasp them; if you must
weep, then weep; if you must lament, then lament. For when once you
allow outward things to dominate what is your own, you had better become
a slave and have done with it. Don't be drawn this way and that, wishing
to be a slave one moment and free another, but be this or that simply
and with all your mind, free or slave, philosopher or unenlightened, a
fighting cock of spirit, or one of no spirit; either bear stroke after
stroke patiently till you die, or give way at once. Let it not be your
lot to suffer many blows and then give way in the end. If such conduct
is shameful, get your own mind clear at once: 'Where is the nature of
good and evil to be found? Where truth is. Where truth and nature are,
there is caution; where truth and nature are, there is confidence.'

For what think you? If Socrates had wished to keep his outward
possessions, would he have come forward and said, 'Anytus and Meletus
have power to kill me, but not to harm me'? Was he so foolish as not to
see that this road leads not to that end, but elsewhere? Why is it then,
that he renders no account to his judges, and adds a word of
provocation? Just as my friend Heraclitus, when he had an action in
Rhodes concerning a plot of land and had pointed out to the judges that
his arguments were just, when he came to his peroration said, 'I will
not supplicate you, nor do I regard the judgement you will give; it is
you who are on your trial rather than I', and so he made an end of the
business. You need not speak like that, only do not supplicate. Do not
add the words, 'I do not supplicate', unless, as happened to Socrates,
the right time has come deliberately to provoke your judges. If, indeed,
you are preparing a peroration of this sort, why do you appear in court?
Why do you answer the summons? If you wish to be crucified, wait and the
cross will come: but if reason requires that you should answer the
summons and do your best to persuade the judge,

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

you must act in accordance with this, but always keeping true to
yourself.

On this principle it is ridiculous to say, 'Give me advice.' What advice
am I to give you? Say rather, 'Enable my mind to adapt itself to the
issue, whatever it may be', for the other phrase is as though a man
unskilled in writing should say, 'Tell me what to write, when a name is
set me to write.' For if I say 'Dion', and then yonder fellow comes
forward and sets him the name not of Dion but of Theon, what is to
happen? What is he to write? If you have practised writing, you can
prepare yourself for anything that is dictated to you. But if you have
not practised, what is the good of my making a suggestion? For if
circumstances suggest something different, what will you say or what
will you do? Remember then this general principle, and you will need no
special suggestion. But if you fix your gaze on outward things, you must
needs be tossed up and down, at the will of your master. And who is your
master? He who has authority over any of those things on which you set
your heart or which you will to avoid.
