### CHAPTER XIII

#### TO THOSE WHO LIGHTLY COMMUNICATE THEIR SECRETS

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> a man seems to have talked frankly
to us about his own affairs,. how we are drawn to communicate our own
secrets to him and think this is frankness! First because it seems
unfair to have heard our neighbour's affairs and yet not give him a
share of our own in turn: next because we think we shall not give the
impression of being frank if we are silent about our own affairs. In
fact we often find men in the habit of saying, 'I've told you all my
affairs, won't you tell me any of yours? How it that?' Besides we think
we may safely confide in one who has already confided his affairs to us:
for we have a sort of feeling that he would never talk of our affairs
for fear that we should talk of his. This is exactly the way in which
reckless persons are caught by soldiers in Rome. A soldier sits by you
in civilian dress, and begins to speak ill of the Emperor: then, as you
have, so to speak, taken security from him for his good faith in the
fact that he began the abuse, you are led to speak your own mind and so
are arrested and imprisoned. The same sort of thing happens to us in
ordinary life. Still, though he has confided his affairs to me with
security, am I to do the same to the first man I meet? No, I hear and
hold my tongue, if I am that sort of man, but he goes off and tells
every one. Then, if I hear what he has done, if I am like him, I go and
tell his secrets, because I want to have my revenge, and so I bring
confusion to others and myself. But if I bear in mind, that one man does
not harm another, but that it is his own acts which help or harm a man,
I achieve this conquest—that I abstain from doing the same as he did,
but still my own babbling has put me in the position I am in.

'Yes,' you say; 'but it is unfair to hear your neighbour's secrets, and
give him no share of your own in return.'

Man, did I invite your confidences? Did you tell me your secrets on
conditions, that you might hear mine in return? If you are a babbler and
think every one you meet is a friend, do you want me to be like

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

yourself? What! if you have done well to confide in me, but it is not
possible to confide in you and do well, do you still want me to unbosom
myself? That is just as though I had a sound cask and you an unsound
one, and you came and handed over your wine to me to put it into my
cask, and then were vexed that I did not trust my wine to you, because
your cask had a hole in it.

What becomes of your equality now? You trusted to one who is
trustworthy, self-respecting, who believes that good and harm depend on
his own activities and on nothing outside: would you have me confide in
you, you who have made light of your own will and want to get pelf or
office or advancement at court, even at the cost of slaying your
children like Medea? Where is the equality in that?

No, show yourself to me as one who is trustworthy, self-respecting,
safe, show that your judgements are those of a friend, show that your
vessel is not unsound, and then you will see that I will not wait for
you to confide your affairs to me, but will come to you myself and ask
you to hear mine. For who is there that will not use a goodly vessel,
who that despises a loyal and faithful counsellor, who that will not
gladly welcome one who is ready to share the burden of his distresses
and to relieve him by the very fact of sharing in them?

'Yes; but I trust you, and you do not trust me.'

In the first place you do not trust me; you are only garrulous and
therefore cannot keep anything back. For if what you say is true, trust
your secrets to me and no one else: instead of which, whenever you see
any one at leisure, you sit down by him and say, 'My brother, you are
the dearest friend I have; I beg you to listen to my story'. And you do
this to those you have not known even for a short while. If you really
trust me, you trust me, of course, because I am trustworthy and
self-respecting, not because I told you my secrets. Let me too then be
allowed to think as you do. Prove to me that if a man tells his secrets
to another, he is therefore trustworthy and self-respecting. If that
were so, I should have gone about the world telling every man my
affairs, if that were going to make me trustworthy and self-respecting.
It is not really so. No, to be trustworthy a man needs judgements beyond
the ordinary. If you see that a man is devoted to things outside his own
will and has made his will subject to these, be sure that he has
countless persons who hinder and constrain him. He has no need of a
pitch-plaster or a rack to make him reveal what he knows, but the nod of
a pretty maid, if it so chance, will shake his principles, a kindness
from one of Caesar's officers, a lust for office or inheritance, and
countless other motives such as these. You must therefore remember
generally, that confidences require trust and trustworthy principles:
and where can you easily find these nowadays? Let me be shown a man who
is so

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

minded as to say, 'I have no concern except with what is my own, with
what is beyond hindrance and by nature free. This is the true good, and
it is mine: all else I leave to the Giver of events to decide, and raise
no question.'
