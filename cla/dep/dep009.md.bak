### CHAPTER VIII

#### THAT FACULTIES ARE FRAUGHT WITH DANGER FOR THE UNEDUCATED

<span class="smallcaps">Just</span> as it is possible to interchange
terms which are equivalent to one another, so and in just as many ways
it is allowable to vary in argument the types of disputative argument
and enthymeme. Take for instance this kind of argument: 'If you borrowed
and did not repay, you owe me the money. You did not borrow without
repaying; therefore you do not owe me the money.' And the philosopher
above all others is the proper person to handle such arguments with
skill. For if enthymeme is imperfect syllogism, plainly he who is
trained in perfect syllogism would be equally capable in dealing with
imperfect.

Why then, you ask, do we not train ourselves and one another in this
style of argument? Because even now, though we do not devote our-

selves to training in these matters and though we are not drawn away, so
far as I have any influence, from cultivating character, nevertheless we
make no advance towards goodness. What should we have to expect then, if
we should add this business to our other employments? And there is
more—not only should we have less leisure for more necessary things, but
we should give uncommon occasion for conceit and vanity. For the faculty
of disputative and plausible reasoning is a powerful one, especially if
it should be developed by training and gain further dignity from mastery
of language. For indeed generally every faculty is dangerous when it
comes into the hands of those who are without education and without real
force, for it tends to exalt and puff them up. For how would it be
possible to persuade the young man who excels in these arguments that he
ought not to become dependent upon them, but to make them depend upon
him? Instead of this he tramples under foot all we say to him and walks
among us in a high state of elation, so puffed up that he cannot bear
that any one should remind him how far he has fallen short and into what
errors he has lapsed.

'What do you mean? Was not Plato a philosopher?'

I reply, Was not Hippocrates a physician? But you see how eloquent
Hippocrates was. Was Hippocrates so eloquent by virtue of being a
physician? Why then do you mix qualities, which are casually united in
the same persons? Suppose Plato was handsome and strong; ought I also to
set to and strive to become handsome or strong, as though this were
necessary for philosophy, just because one philosopher was handsome as
well? Will you not have the discernment to see what makes men
philosophers and what qualities are accidental in them? Suppose now I
were a philosopher, ought you to become lame?

You ask me, do I then count these faculties as of no effect?

Heaven forbid! no more than I ignore the faculty of vision. Nevertheless
if you ask me what is the true good of man, I can only say to you that
it lies in a certain disposition of the will.
