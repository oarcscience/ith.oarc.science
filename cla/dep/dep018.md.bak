### CHAPTER XVII

#### THAT THE PROCESSES OF LOGIC ARE NECESSARY

<span class="smallcaps">Since</span> it is reason which makes all other
things articulate and complete, and reason itself must be analysed and
made articulate, what is it that shall effect this? Plainly, reason
itself or something else. That something else either is reason or it
will be something superior to reason, which is impossible. If it is
reason, who again will analyse that reason? For if it

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

analyses itself, so can the reason with which we started. If we are
going to call in something else, the process will be endless and
unceasing.

'Yes,' says one, 'but the more pressing need is not logic but the
discipline of men's thoughts and feelings', and the like.

If you want to hear about moral improvement, well and good. But if you
say to me, 'I do not know whether you argue truly or falsely', and if I
use an ambiguous word and you say to me 'distinguish', I shall grow
impatient and say to you, 'this is the more pressing need.' It is for
this reason, I suppose, that men put the processes of logic in the
forefront, just as we put the testing of the measure before the
measuring of the corn. And if we do not determine first what is the
bushel and what is the scale, how shall we be able to measure or weigh
anything? So in the sphere of thought if we have not fully grasped and
trained to perfection the instrument by which we judge other things and
understand other things, shall we ever be able to arrive at accurate
knowledge? Of course, it is impossible.

'Yes,' they say, 'but the bushel is a mere thing of wood and bears no
fruit.'

True, but it can measure corn.

'The processes of logic, too, are unfruitful.'

This we will consider presently: but even if one should concede this, it
is enough that logic has the power to analyse and distinguish other
things and in fact, as one might say, has the power to weigh and
measure. Who asserts this? Is it only Chrysippus and Zeno and Cleanthes?
Does not Antisthenes agree? Why, who is it that has written, 'The
beginning of education is the analysis of terms'? Does not Socrates too
say the same? Does not Xenophon write of him that he began with the
analysis of terms, to discover what each means?

Is this then what you call great and admirable—to understand or
interpret Chrysippus? Nay, no one says that. What is admirable then? To
understand the will of Nature. Very well: do you understand it of
yourself? If so, what more do you need? For if it is true that all error
is involuntary and you have learnt the truth, you must needs do rightly
hereafter.

'But,' you may say, 'I do not understand the will of Nature.'

Who then expounds it? They say 'Chrysippus.' I come and inquire what
this interpreter of Nature says. I begin not to understand what he means
and I seek some one to interpret. The interpreter says, 'Let us examine
the sense of this phrase, as if it were Latin.'

Why, pray, should the interpreter put on airs? Even Chrysippus has no
right to do so, if he is only expounding the will of Nature, and does
not follow it himself: how much less his interpreter. For we have no
need of Chrysippus for his own sake, but only to enable us to follow

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nature: just as we
have no need, for himself, of the priest who offers sacrifice, but
because we think that through him we shall understand the signs which
the gods give of the future, nor do we need the sacrifice for itself,
but because through it the sign is given, nor do we marvel at the crow
or the raven but at God who gives His signs by them.

So I come to this interpreter and priest and say, 'Examine the victim's
flesh to see what sign is given me.' He takes and opens the flesh and
interprets, 'Man, you have a will unhindered and unconstrained by
nature. This is written here in the flesh of the sacrifice. I will show
you the truth of it first in the sphere of assent. Can any one prevent
you from agreeing to what is true? No one. Can any one compel you to
accept the false? No one. Do you see that in this sphere your faculty is
free from let and hindrance and constraint and compulsion? Is it any
different in the sphere of will and impulse? What, I ask, can overcome
impulse except another impulse? And what can overcome the will to get or
will to avoid except another will to get or to avoid?'

'If he threatens me with death,' one says, 'he compels me.'

No, it is not what he threatens you with which compels you, but your
decision that it is better to do what you are bidden than to die. Once
more then it is your own judgement which compels you—that is, will puts
pressure on will. For if God had so created that portion of His own
being which He has taken from Himself and given to us, that it could
suffer hindrance or compulsion from another, He would cease to be God
and to care for us as He must needs do. 'This', says the priest, 'is
what I find in the sacrifice: this is God's sign to you: if you will,
you are free: if you will, you will blame no one, you will accuse no
one: everything shall be in accordance with your own mind and the mind
of God.'

This is the prophecy which draws me to consult this seer and
philosopher, and his interpretation makes me admire not him but the
truths which he interprets.
