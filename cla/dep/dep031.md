### CHAPTER XXX

#### WHAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE READY TO HAND IN THE CRISES OF LIFE

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> you appear before one of the mighty
of the earth, remember that Another looks from above on what is
happening and that you must please Him rather than this man. He that is
above inquires of you: 'What did you say in the school about exile and
prison and bonds and death and dishonour?'

I said they were 'indifferent'.

'What do you call them now, then? Have they changed?'

No.

'Have you changed then?'

No.

'Tell me then what things are indifferent.'

Things which lie outside the will's control.

'Tell me what follows.'

Things indifferent concern me not at all.

'Tell me also what you thought were "good things".'

A right will and a faculty of dealing rightly with impressions. 'And
what did you think was the end?'

To follow Thee.

'Do you still say that?'

Yes. I say the same now as before.

Go on then into the palace in confidence and remember these things, and
you shall see how a young man who has studied what he ought compares
with men who have had no study. By the gods I imagine that you will feel
thus: 'Why do we make these many and great preparations for nothing? Is
this what authority meant? Are the vestibule, the chamberlains, the
guards no more than this? Was it for this that I listened to those long
discourses? These terrors were naught, and I made ready for them all the
time as though they were great matters.'
