<span class="small">*Cleanse your own heart, cast out from your mind,
... pain, fear, desire, envy, ill will, avarice, cowardice, passion
uncontrolled. These things you cannot cast out, unless you look to God
alone, on Him alone set your thoughts, and consecrate yourself to His
commands.* --(bk. II, ch. xvii, p. 316)</span>

Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher (b. 55-d. 135 CE). Born a slave
in Hierapolis, Phyrgia, in what is today Turkey, Epictetus lived in Rome
until exiled to Nicopolis in Northern Greece. It was in exile that
Epictetus' disciple Arrian took down his Discourses. As we have no
actual writings of Epictetus, Arrian's notes are the only remnants of
his philosophy.

This edition includes the Discourses, and two minor works, the
Fragments, and the Manual, also known as the Enchiridion.--J.B. Hare,
June 13th, 2009.
