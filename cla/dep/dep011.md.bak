### CHAPTER X

#### TO THOSE WHO HAVE SPENT THEIR ENERGIES ON ADVANCEMENT IN ROME

<span class="smallcaps">If we</span> had been as earnest and serious
about our work as old men in Rome are about their concerns, we too might
perhaps have achieved something. I know what was said to me by a man
older than myself who is now in charge of the corn-supply in Rome, when
he passed through here on his way back from exile; he ran down his
former life and made great professions for the future, saying that when
once he was back he would have no other interest except to live out the
rest of his life in peace and tranquillity, 'For how little I have still
left me', said he.

And I said to him, 'You will not do it; so soon as you sniff the air of
Rome you will forget all your professions'; and I told him that if he
got a chance of entering the Palace, he would thrust his way in and give
God thanks.

'Epictetus,' he answered, 'if you find me putting one foot in the
Palace, believe what you like of me.'

Well, what did he do? Before he came to Rome, a dispatch from the
Emperor met him, and as soon as he got it he forgot all he had said and
has gone on adding to his heap ever since. I should like to stand by him
now and remind him of the words he used as he passed through, and say to
him, 'How much more clever a prophet am I than you!'

What conclusion do I draw? Do I say that the creature man is not to be
active? Heaven forbid! But what is it that fetters our faculty of
action? Take myself first: when day comes, I remind myself a little as
to what lesson I ought to read to my pupils. Then in a moment I find
myself saying, 'But what do I really care what sort of lesson I give to

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

this man or that? The first thing is for me to sleep.' And yet how can
their business be compared in importance with ours? If you attend to
what they are doing you will see the difference. They do nothing all day
long except vote, dispute, deliberate about a handful of corn or an acre
of land, and petty profits of this sort. Is there any resemblance
between receiving and reading a petition such as this: 'I beg you to let
me export a little corn', and a petition such as, 'I beg you to inquire
from Chrysippus how the universe is governed and what position the
rational creature holds in it; inquire too who you are and what is good
for you, and what is evil'? What have these petitions in common? Do both
demand the same attention? Is it equally shameful to neglect one and to
neglect the other?

What is my conclusion? Are we elders alone indolent and sleepy? Nay, the
fault is much rather with you young men. For indeed, we old folk, when
we see young men playing, are only too eager and ready to join their
play. Much more, if I saw them thoroughly awakened and eager to share my
studies, should I be eager myself to take my studies seriously too.
