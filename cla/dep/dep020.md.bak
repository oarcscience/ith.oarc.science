### CHAPTER XIX

#### HOW ONE SHOULD BEHAVE TOWARDS TYRANTS

<span class="smallcaps">If a</span> man possesses some advantage, or
thinks he does though he does not, he is bound, if he be uneducated, to
be puffed up because of it. The tyrant, for instance, says, 'I am
mightiest of all men.'

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

Well, and what can you give me? Can you enable me to get what I will to
get? How can you? Can you avoid what you will to avoid, independent of
circumstances? Is your impulse free from error? How can you claim any
such power?

Tell me, on shipboard, do you put confidence in yourself or in the man
who knows? And in a chariot? Surely in him who knows. How is it in other
arts? Exactly the same. What does your power come to then?

'All men pay me attention.'

Yes, and I pay attention to my platter and work it and polish it and I
fix up a peg for my oil-flask. Does that mean that these are superior to
me? No, but they do me some service, and for this reason I pay them
attention. Again: do I not pay attention to my ass? Do I not wash his
feet? Do I not curry him? Do you not know that every man pays regard to
himself, and to you only as to his ass? For who pays regard to you as a
man? Show me. Who wishes to become like you? Who regards you as one like
Socrates to admire and follow?

'But I can behead you.'

Well said. I forgot, of course, one ought to pay you worship as if you
were fever or cholera, and raise an altar to you, like the altar to
Fever in Rome.

What is it then which disturbs and confounds the multitude? Is it the
tyrant and his guards? Nay, God forbid! It is impossible for that which
is free by nature to be disturbed or hindered by anything but itself. It
is a man's own judgements which disturb him. For when the tyrant says to
a man, 'I will chain your leg,' he that values his leg says, 'Nay, have
mercy,' but he that values his will says, 'If it seems more profitable
to you, chain it.'

'Do you pay no heed?'

No, I pay no heed.

'I will show you that I am master.'

How can you? Zeus gave me my freedom. Or do you think that he was likely
to let his own son be enslaved? You are master of my dead body, take it.

'Do you mean that when you approach me, you pay no respect to me?' No, I
only pay respect to myself: if you wish me to say that I pay respect to
you too, I tell you that I do so, but only as I pay respect to my
water-pot.

This is not mere self-love: for it is natural to man, as to other
creatures, to do everything for his own sake; for even the sun does
everything for its own sake, and in a word so does Zeus himself. But
when he would be called 'The Rain-giver' and 'Fruit-giver' and 'Father
of men and gods', you see that he cannot win these names or do these
works

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

unless he does some good to the world at large: and in general he has so
created the nature of the rational animal, that he can attain nothing
good for himself, unless he contributes some service to the community.
So it turns out that to do everything for his own sake is not unsocial.
For what do you expect? Do you expect a man to hold aloof from himself
and his own interest? No: we cannot ignore the one principle of action
which governs all things—to be at unity with themselves.

What follows? When men's minds harbour wrong opinions on things beyond
the will, counting them good and evil, they are bound to pay regard to
tyrants. Would that it were only tyrants, and not chamberlains too! How
can a man possibly grow wise of a sudden, when Caesar appoints him to
the charge of the privy? How is it we straightway say, 'Felicio has
spoken wisely to me'? I would fain have him deposed from the dung-heap,
that he may seem foolish to you again. Epaphroditus had a shoemaker,
whom he sold because he was useless: then by some chance he was bought
by one of Caesar's officials, and became Caesar's shoemaker. If you
could have seen how Epaphroditus honoured him. 'How is my good Felicio,
I pray you?' Then if some one asked us, 'What is your master doing?' the
answer was, 'He is consulting Felicio about something.' What, had he not
sold him for useless? Who has suddenly made a wise man of him? This is
what comes of honouring anything outside one's will.

He has been honoured with a tribuneship. All who meet him congratulate
him; one kisses his eyes, another his neck, his slaves kiss his hands.
He comes into his house and finds lamps being lighted. He goes up to the
Capitol and offers sacrifice. Who, I ask you, ever offered sacrifice in
gratitude for right direction of the will or for impulse in accordance
with nature? For we give thanks to the gods for what we think our good!

To-day one spoke to me about the priesthood of Augustus. I told him,
'Fellow, leave the thing alone; you will spend a great deal on nothing.'

'Well, but those who draw up contracts will record my name.'

Can you be there when men read it and say to them, 'That is my name,'
and even supposing you can be there now, what will you do if you die?

'My name will remain.'

Write it on a stone and it will remain. But who will remember you
outside Nicopolis?

'But I shall wear a golden crown.'

If you desire a crown at all, take a crown of roses and wear that: you
will look smarter in that.
