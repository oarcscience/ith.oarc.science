### CHAPTER XI

#### ON CLEANLINESS

<span class="smallcaps">Some</span> men raise the question whether the
social faculty is a necessary element in man's nature: nevertheless even
they, I think, would not question that cleanliness at any rate is
essential to it, and that this, if anything, divides him from the lower
animals. So when we see one of the other animals cleaning itself, we are
wont to say in our surprise, 'He does it like a man.' And again, if some
one finds fault with an animal for being dirty we are wont to say at
once, as if in defence, 'Of course he is not a man.' So true is it that
we think the quality to be distinctive of man, deriving it first from
the gods. For since the gods are by nature pure and unalloyed, just in
so far as men have approached them by virtue of reason, they have a
tendency to purity and cleanliness. But since it is impossible for their
nature to be entirely pure, being composed of such stuff as it is, the
reason which they have received endeavours, so far as in it lies, to
make this stuff clean.

The primary and fundamental purity is that of the soul, and so with
impurity. You cannot find the same impurity in a soul as in a body: the
soul's impurity you will find to be just this—that which renders it
unclean for its own functions; and the functions of a soul are: impulse
to act and not to act, will to get and will to avoid, preparation,
design, assent. What is it then which renders the soul foul and unclean
in these functions? It is nothing but its evil judgements. And so the
soul's impurity consists in bad judgements, and purification consists in
producing in it right judgements, and the pure soul is one which has
right judgements, for this alone is proof against confusion and
pollution in its functions.

And one ought to endeavour, as far as may be, to achieve a similar
cleanliness in one's body too. Man's temperament is such that there must
needs be mucous discharge: for this reason nature made hands, and the
nostrils themselves like channels to cleanse his humours. If he swallows
them I say that he does not act as a man should. It was impossible for
men's feet not to be made muddy and dirty when they pass

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

through mud and dirt; for this reason nature provided water and hands to
wash with. It was impossible that some impurity should not stick to the
teeth from eating. Therefore we are bidden to wash our teeth. Why? That
you may be a man and not a beast or a pig. It was impossible that sweat
and the pressure of our clothes should not leave some defilement
clinging to the body, and needing to be cleansed. Therefore we have
water, olive-oil, hands, towel, strigils, soap, and on occasion every
other sort of apparatus, to make the body clean.

'Not for me', you say.

What! The smith will clean his iron tool of rust, and will have
instruments made for the purpose, and even you will wash your plate when
you are going to eat, unless you are absolutely foul and dirty, and yet
you will not wash nor make clean your poor body? 'Why should I?' says
he. I will tell you again: first, that you may act like a man, next,
that you may not annoy those you meet. You are doing something very like
it even here, though you are not aware of it. You think you deserve to
have a scent of your own. Very well, deserve it: but do you think those
who sit by you deserve it too, and those who recline by you, and those
who kiss you? Go away then into a wilderness, where you deserve to go,
and live by yourself, and have your smell to yourself, for it is right
that you should enjoy your uncleanness by yourself. But if you are in a
city, what sort of man are you making yourself, to behave so
thoughtlessly and inconsiderately? If nature had trusted a horse to your
care, would you have left it uncared for? Imagine that your body has
been committed to you as a horse: wash it, rub it down well, make it
such that no one will shun it or turn from it. But who does not turn
from a man who is dirty, odorous, foul-complexioned, more than from one
who is bespattered with muck? The smell of the latter is external and
accidental, that of the former comes from want of tendance; it is from
within, and shows a sort of inward rottenness.

'But Socrates rarely washed.'

Why, his body was clean and bright, nay, it was so gracious and
agreeable that the handsomest and noblest were in love with him, and
desired to recline by him rather than by those who were perfect in
beauty. He might have never washed or bathed, if he had liked: I tell
you his ablutions, if rare, were powerful. If you will not wash in hot
water, wash in cold.

But Aristophanes says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*I mean the pallid folk, that shoeless go*.  
                                \[Aristophanes, Clouds, 103\]

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> True, but he also
says he trod the air and stole clothes from the Gymnasium. The fact is,
that all who have written about Socrates bear

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

witness to just the opposite: he was not only pleasant to hear, but
pleasant to look upon. They write the same again about Diogenes.

You must not scare away the masses from philosophy by your bodily
appearance, but show yourself cheerful and unruffled in the body as in
other things. 'Men, look at me, I have nothing, I need nothing; without
house, without city, an exile, if it so chance, and without a hearth,
behold how I live a life more tranquil and happy than all the noble and
the rich: but you see also that my poor body is not disfigured by my
hard living!' But if a man says this to me, and wears the face and
figure of one condemned, no god will ever persuade me to come near
philosophy, if that is the sort of men she makes. Far be it from me:
though it were to make me wise, I would not.

By the gods, when the young man feels the first stirrings of philosophy
I would rather he came to me with his hair sleek than dishevelled and
dirty: for that shows a sort of reflection of the beautiful, and a
longing for the comely, and where he imagines these to be, there he
spends his effort. It only remains then to point him the way and say,
'Young man, you are in search of the beautiful, and you do well. Know
then, that it is to be found where your reason is. Seek for it in the
region of impulses to act and not to act, in the region of the will to
get and the will to avoid. This is your distinctive possession, your
body is born to be but clay. Why do you toil for it in vain? Time, if
nothing else, will teach you that it is nothing.' But if he comes to me
befouled, dirty, with a beard trailing to his knees, what can I say to
him, what similitude can I use to attract him? To what is he devoted
that has any likeness to the beautiful, that I may change his direction
and say, 'The beautiful is not here, but here'? Would you have me say to
him, 'The beautiful is to be found not in filthiness but in reason'?
Does he want the beautiful? Does he show any sign of it? Go and reason
with a pig, that he wallow no more in the mire! That was why Xenocrates’
discourses laid hold on Polemo, for he was a young man of taste; he had
come with glimmerings of devotion to the beautiful, though he sought it
elsewhere.

Why, nature did not make even those lower animals dirty who associate
with men. Does a horse or a well-bred dog wallow in mire? No, it is only
the pig, and greasy geese, and worms and spiders, creatures the furthest
removed from human society. Do you then, being a man, choose to be a
wretched worm or spider, lower even than the animals that associate with
men? Will you never wash, be it how you will? Will you not cleanse
yourself? Will you not come clean among us that you may give pleasure to
your companions? What! do you enter our temples, where custom forbids
spitting or wiping the nose, in this condition, a man of filth and
drivel?

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

'What?' you ask. 'Do you call on us to adorn ourselves?'

Far from it, if it be not with our natural adornment of reason,
judgements, activities, and the body only so far as to be cleanly and
give no offence. If you hear that you must not wear scarlet, must you
needs go off and spread filth on your cloak, or tear it in half?

'But how am I to have a beautiful cloak?'

Man, you have water, wash it. Here is a young man worthy to be loved,
here is an old man worthy to love and to be loved, one to whom a man is
to hand over his son to be instructed: daughters and young men will come
to him, if it so chance, and for what? That he may discourse to them on
a dunghill? God forbid. All eccentricity springs from some human source,
but this comes near to being inhuman altogether.
