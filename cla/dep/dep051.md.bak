### CHAPTER XIX

#### TO THOSE WHO TAKE UP THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PHILOSOPHERS ONLY TO DISCUSS THEM

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> 'Master' argument appears to have
been propounded on some such basis as this.

There are three propositions which are at variance with one
another—i.e., any two with the third—namely, these: (1) everything true
as an event in the past is necessary; (2) the impossible does not follow
from the possible; (3) what neither is true nor will be is yet possible.
Diodorus, noticing this conflict of statements, used the probability of
the first two to prove the conclusion, 'Nothing is possible which
neither is nor

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

will be true'. Some one else, however, will maintain another pair of
these propositions. 'What neither is nor will be true is yet possible',
and, 'The impossible does not follow from the possible', while rejecting
the third, 'Everything true in the past is necessary', as appears to be
the view of Cleanthes and his school, who have been supported to a large
extent by Antipater. Others maintain the third pair, 'What neither is
true nor will be is yet possible', and 'Everything true as an event in
the past is necessary', and reject 'The impossible does not follow from
the possible'. But to maintain all three propositions at once is
impracticable, because every pair is in conflict with the third.

If, then, some one ask me, 'But which of these do you maintain?' I shall
answer him that I do not know, but the account I have received is that
Diodorus maintained one pair, and the school of Panthoides and
Cleanthes, I fancy, the second, and the school of Chrysippus the third.

'What do you hold then?'

I have never given my mind to this, to put my own impression to the test
and compare different views and form a judgement of my own on the
subject: therefore I am no better than a grammarian.

'Who was Hector's father?'

Priam.

'Who were his brothers?'

Paris and Deiphobus.

'And who was their mother?'

Hecuba. That is the account I have received.

'From whom?'

From Homer: and Hellanicus also writes on the same subject, I believe,
and others of the same class.

So it is with me and the 'Master' argument: I go no further. But if I am
a vain person I cause the utmost amazement among the company at a
banquet by enumerating those who have written on the subject.
'Chrysippus also has written admirably in the first book of his treatise
"On the possible". Cleanthes, too, has written a special book on this,
and Archedemus. And Antipater also has written, not only in his book on
"The possible", but also specially in his work on "the Master" argument.
Have you not read the treatise?'

'I have not read it.'

Read it.

And what good will he get from it? He will only be more silly and
tiresome than he is now. For what have you got by reading it? What
judgement have you formed on the subject? You will only tell us of Helen
and Priam and the island of Calypso, which never was nor will be.

And indeed in the field of literature it does not matter much that you
should master the received account and have formed no judgement of

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

your own. But we are much more liable to this fault in matters of
conduct than in literary matters.

'Tell me about things good and evil.'

Listen.

'Of things that are, some are good, some bad, some indifferent. The
virtues and all that share in them are good, vices and all that share in
them are bad, and all that comes between is indifferent—wealth, health,
life, death, pleasure, pain.'

How do you know?

'Hellanicus says so in his history of Egypt.' For you might just as well
say that as say 'Diogenes or Chrysippus or Cleanthes said so in his
Ethics'. I ask, have you put any of these doctrines to the test, and
formed a judgement of your own? Show us how you are wont to bear
yourself in a storm on shipboard. Do you remember this distinction of
good and bad when the sail cracks and you cry aloud to heaven, and some
bystander, untimely merry, says 'Tell me, by the gods, what have you
been telling us lately? Is it a vice to suffer shipwreck? Does it
partake of vice?' Will you not take up a belaying pin and give him a
drubbing? 'What have we to do with you, fellow? We are perishing, and
you come and mock us.'

Again, if you are sent for by Caesar and are accused, do you remember
the distinction? As you enter with a pale face, and trembling withal
suppose some one comes up and says to you, 'Why do you tremble, man?
What are you concerned about? Does Caesar put virtue and vice in the
hearts of those who come before him?'

'Why do you mock me, as though I had not miseries enough?'

Nay, philosopher, tell me why you tremble. Is it not of death you stand
in danger, or prison or pain of body or exile or disgrace, nothing else?
Is it wickedness, or anything that partakes of wickedness? And what did
you tell us that all these were?

'Man, what have Ito do with you? My own evils are enough for me.'

Well said, indeed: for your own evils are indeed enough—meanness,
cowardice, the boasting spirit, which you showed when you sat in the
lecture-room. Why did you pride yourself on what was not your own? Why
did you call yourself a Stoic?

Watch your own conduct thus and you will discover to what school you
belong. You will find that most of you are Epicureans and some few
Peripatetics, but with all the fibre gone from you. Where have you shown
that you really hold virtue to be equal to all else, or even superior?

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Show me a Stoic if
you can! Where or how is he to be found? You can show me men who use the
fine phrases of the Stoics, in any number, for the same men who do this
can recite Epicurean phrases just as well and can repeat those of the
Peripatetics just as perfectly; is it not so?

Who then is a Stoic?

Show me a man moulded to the pattern of the judgements that he utters,
in the same way as we call a statue Phidian that is moulded according to
the art of Phidias. Show me one who is sick and yet happy, in peril and
yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and
happy. Show him me. By the gods I would fain see a Stoic. Nay you cannot
show me a finished Stoic; then show me one in the moulding, one who has
set his feet on the path. Do me this kindness, do not grudge an old man
like me a sight I never saw till now. What! you think you are going to
show me the Zeus of Phidias or his Athena, that work of ivory and gold?
It is a soul I want; let one of you show me the soul of a man who wishes
to be at one with God, and to blame God or man no longer, to fail in
nothing, to feel no misfortune, to be free from anger, envy, and
jealousy—one who (why wrap up my meaning?) desires to change his manhood
for godhead, and who in this poor dead body of his has his purpose set
upon communion with God. Show him to me. Nay, you cannot. Why, then, do
you mock yourselves, and trifle with others? Why do you put on a
character which is not your own, and walk about like thieves and robbers
in these stolen phrases and properties that do not belong to you?

And so now I am your teacher, and you are at school with me: and my
purpose is this, to make you my completed work, untouched by hindrance
or compulsion, or constraint, free, tranquil, happy, looking to God in
everything small or great; and you are here to learn and practise these
things. Why, then, do you not finish the work, if indeed you also have
the purpose you should have, and if I have the purpose and the proper
equipment also? What is it that is wanting? When I see a craftsman and
material ready to his hand, I look for the finished work. Now here, too,
is the craftsman, and here is the material. What do we lack? Is not the
subject teachable? It is teachable. Is it not within our power then?
Nay, it is the one thing of all others which is in our power. Wealth is
not in our power, nor health, nor anything else, in a word, except the
proper use of impressions. This alone, by nature's gift, is unhindered
and untrammelled. Why, then, do you not finish the work? Tell me the
reason: for it lies either in me or in you or in the nature of the
thing. The achievement itself is possible, and rests with us alone. It
follows then that the reason lies in me or in you, or, more truly, in
both. What is my conclusion? Let us begin, if

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

you only will, to carry out such purpose here and now. Let us leave
behind what is past. Only let us begin; have trust in me, and you shall
see.
