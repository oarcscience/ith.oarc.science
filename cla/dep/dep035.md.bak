### CHAPTER III

#### TO THOSE WHO COMMEND PERSONS TO PHILOSOPHERS

<span class="smallcaps">That</span> is a good answer of Diogenes to one
who asked him for letters of introduction: 'You are a man, and that his
eyes will tell him; but whether you are good or bad he will discover, if
he has skill to distinguish the good from the bad; and if he has not
that skill, he will never discover it, though I should write him ten
thousand letters.' A drachma might just as well ask to be introduced to
some one in order to be tested. If the man is a judge of silver, you
will introduce yourself. We ought, therefore, to have some faculty to
guide us in life, as the assayer has in dealing with silver, that I may
be able to say as he does, 'Give me any drachma you please, and I will
distinguish.' Now I can deal with a syllogism and say, 'Bring any one
you like, and I will distinguish between him who can analyse syllogisms
and him who cannot.' Why? Because I know how to analyse them: I have the
faculty a man must have who is to recognize those who can handle
syllogisms aright. But when I have to deal with life, how do I behave?
Sometimes I call a thing good, sometimes evil. And the reason is just
this, that whereas I have knowledge of syllogisms, I have no knowledge
or experience of life.
