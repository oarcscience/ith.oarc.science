### CHAPTER XV

#### WHAT PHILOSOPHY PROFESSES

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> a man consulted Epictetus how to
persuade his brother to be angry with him no longer, he replied,
'Philosophy does not promise to secure to man anything outside him. If
it did it would be admitting something beyond its subject-matter. For as
wood is the material dealt with by the carpenter, bronze by the
statuary, so the subject-matter of each man's art of living is his own
life. What are we to say then of your brother's life? That again is the
concern of his art of living: to yours it is a thing external, like
land, health, good repute. Philosophy makes no promises about such
things.'

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

'In all circumstances' (says philosophy), 'I will keep the Governing
Principle <span id="fr_11"></span>[1-12](dep032.htm#fn_11) in accord
with nature.'

Whose Governing Principle?

'His, in whom I am.'

How then am I to prevent my brother from being angry with me? Bring him
to me and I will tell him, but I have nothing to say to you about his
anger.

When the man who consulted him said, 'What I am looking for is this—how
I may be in accord with nature, even though he be not reconciled with
me', he replied, No great thing comes suddenly into being, any more than
a cluster of grapes or a fig. If you say to me now, 'I want a fig', I
shall answer that it needs time. Let it flower first, then put forth its
fruit and then ripen. I say then, if the fig tree's fruit is not brought
to perfection suddenly in a single hour, would you gather fruit of men's
minds so soon and so easily? I tell you, you must not expect it.
