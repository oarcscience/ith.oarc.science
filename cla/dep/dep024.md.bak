### CHAPTER XXIII

#### AGAINST EPICURUS

<span class="smallcaps">Epicurus</span> understands as well as we do
that we are by nature social beings, but having once placed our good not
in the spirit but in the husk which contains it he cannot say anything
different. On the other hand he firmly grasps the principle that one
must not admire nor accept anything which is severed from the nature of
the good: and he is quite right.

How can we be social beings, if (as you say) we have no natural
affection for our offspring? Why do you advise the wise man not to bring
up children? Why are you afraid that they may bring him into troubles?

Does the mouse he rears indoors cause him trouble? What does he care
then, if a tiny mouse begins crying in his house? But he knows that if
once a child is born, it will not be in our power not to love it nor
care for it.

Epicurus says that the man who is wise does not enter into politics, for
he knows what sort of things the politician has to do. Of course if you
are going to live among men as if they were flies, what is to prevent
you? But Epicurus, as though he did not know what natural affection is,
says 'Let us not bring up children.'

If a sheep does not abandon its offspring, nor a wolf, does a man
abandon his? What would you have us do? Would you have us foolish as
sheep? Even they do not abandon their young. Would you have us savage as
wolves? Even they do not abandon theirs. Nay, who takes your advice when
he sees his child fallen on the ground and crying? Why, I think that if
your father and mother had foreseen that you were going to talk thus,
even then they would not have cast you away from them.
