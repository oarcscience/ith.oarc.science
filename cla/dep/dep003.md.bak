## CHAPTER II

#### HOW ONE MAY BE TRUE TO ONE'S CHARACTER IN EVERYTHING

<span class="smallcaps">To the</span> rational creature that which is
against reason is alone past bearing; the rational he can always bear.
Blows are not by nature intolerable.

'What do you mean?'

Let me explain; the Lacedaemonians bear flogging, because they have
learnt that it is in accord with reason.

'But is it not intolerable to hang oneself?'

At any rate, when a man comes to feel that it is rational, he goes and
hangs himself at once. In a word, if we look to it we shall see that by
nothing is the rational creature so distressed as by the irrational, and
again to nothing so much attracted as to the rational.

But rational and irrational mean different things to different persons,

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

just as good and evil, expedient and inexpedient, are different for
different persons. That is the chief reason why we need education, that
we may learn so to adjust our preconceptions <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1-3](dep032.htm#fn_2.md) of rational and irrational to
particular conditions as to be in harmony with nature. But to decide
what is rational and irrational we not only estimate the value of things
external, but each one of us considers what is in keeping with his
character. For one man thinks it reasonable to perform the meanest
office <span id="fr_3"></span>[1-4](dep032.htm#fn_3.md) for another; for he
looks merely to this, that if he refuses he will be beaten and get no
food, while if he does it nothing hard or painful will be done to him.
To another it seems intolerable not only to do this service himself, but
even to suffer another to do it. If then you ask me, 'Am I to do it or
not?' I shall say to you, to get food is worth more than to go without
it, and to be flogged is worth less than to escape flogging: therefore,
if you measure your affairs by this standard, go and do it.

'But I shall be false to myself.'

That is for you to bring into the question, not for me. For it is you
who know yourself; you know at how much you put your worth, and at what
price you sell yourself. For different men sell at different prices.

That is why Agrippinus, when Florus was considering whether he should go
down to Nero's shows, to perform some part in them himself, said to him,
'Go down.' And when he asked, 'Why do you not go down yourself?' said,
'Because I do not even consider the question.' For when a man once
lowers himself to think about such matters, and to value external things
and calculate about them he has almost forgotten his own character. What
is it you ask me? 'Is death or life to be preferred?' I say 'life'.
'Pain or pleasure?' I say 'pleasure'.

'But, if I do not act in the tragedy, I shall be beheaded.'

Go then and act your tragedy, but I will not do so. You ask me, 'Why?' I
answer, 'Because you count yourself to be but an ordinary thread in the
tunic.' What follows then? You ought to think how you can be like other
men, just as one thread does not wish to have something special to
distinguish it from the rest: but I want to be the purple, that touch of
brilliance which gives distinction and beauty to the rest. Why then do
you say to me, 'Make yourself like unto the many?' If I do that, I shall
no longer be the purple.

Priscus Helvidius too saw this, and acted on it. When Vespasian sent to
him not to come into the Senate he answered, 'You can forbid me to be a
senator; but as long as I am a senator I must come in.'

'Come in then,' he says, 'and be silent.'

'Question me not and I will be silent.'

'But I am bound to question you.'

'And I am bound to say what seems right to me.'

'But, if you say it, I shall kill you.'

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

'When did I tell you, that I was immortal? You will do your part, and I
mine. It is yours to kill, mine to die without quailing: yours to
banish, mine to go into exile without groaning.'

What good, you ask, did Priscus do, being but one? What good does the
purple do to the garment? Just this, that being purple it gives
distinction and stands out as a fine example to the rest. Another man,
had Caesar in such circumstances told him not to come into the Senate,
would have said, 'Thank you for sparing me.' Such a one he would never
have forbidden to come in; he would know that he would either sit silent
like a pipkin or if he spoke would say what he knew Caesar wished and
pile on more besides.

This spirit too was shown by a certain athlete, who was threatened with
death if he did not sacrifice his virility. When his brother, who was a
philosopher, came to him and said, 'Brother, what will you do? Are we to
let the knife do its work and still go into the gymnasium?' he would not
consent, but endured to meet his death. (*Here some one asked*, 'How did
he do so, as an athlete or as a philosopher?') <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1-5](dep032.htm#fn_4.md) He did so as a man, and a man
who had wrestled at Olympia and been proclaimed victor, one who had
passed his days in such a place as that, not one who anoints himself at
Bato's. Another man would have consented to have even his head cut off,
if he could have lived without it.

That is what I mean by keeping your character: such is its power with
those who have acquired the habit of carrying it into every question
that arises.

'Go to, Epictetus, have yourself shaved.'

If I am a philosopher I say, 'I will not be shaved.'

'I must behead you then.'

Behead me, if it is better for you so.

*One asked*, 'How then shall we discover, each of us, what suits his
character?'

How does the bull, he answered, at the lion's approach, alone discover
what powers he is endowed with, when he stands forth to protect the
whole herd? It is plain that with the possession of his power the
consciousness of it also is given him. So each of us, who has power of
this sort, will not be unaware of its possession. Like the bull, the man
of noble nature does not become noble of a sudden; he must train through
the winter, and make ready, and not lightly leap to meet things that
concern him not.

Of one thing beware, O man; see what is the price at which you sell your
will. If you do nothing else, do not sell your will cheap. The great,
heroic style, it may be, belongs to others, to Socrates and men like
him.

'If then this is our true nature, why do not all men, or many, show it?'

What? Do all horses turn out swift, are all dogs good at the scent?

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

'What am I to do then? Since I have no natural gifts, am I to make no
effort for that reason?'

Heaven forbid. Epictetus is not better than Socrates: if only he is as
good as Socrates I am content. For I shall never be a Milo, yet I do not
neglect my body; nor a Croesus, and yet I do not neglect my property;
nor, in a word, do we abandon our effort in any field because we despair
of the first place.
