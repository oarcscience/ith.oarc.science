### CHAPTER XXI

#### TO THOSE WHO WISH TO BE ADMIRED

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> a man has his proper station in
life, he does not hanker after what is beyond him.

What is it, man, that you wish to have?

'I am content if I am in accord with Nature in what I will to get and
will to avoid, if I follow Nature in impulse to act and to refrain from
action, in purpose, and design and assent.'

Why then do you walk about as if you had swallowed a poker?

'I would fain that they who meet me should admire me, and cry aloud,
"What a great philosopher!"'

Who are these by whom you wish to be admired? Are not these the men whom
you generally describe as mad? What do you want then? Do you want to be
admired by madmen?
