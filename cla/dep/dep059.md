### The Discourses.

beaters in hunting.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[2-2](dep033.htm#fr_16) This refers to the
ceremony of manumission. Epictetus may mention this so frequently
because he himself was a freedman.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[2-3](dep041.htm#fr_17) 'It is not certain
whether in this sentence and the next Epictetus is thinking of Jews or
of Christians, who at this time were often confused with them.'
(Matheson)

<span id="fn_18"></span>[2-4](dep046.htm#fr_18) 'Three campaigns in the
cavalry or six in the infantry were the period laid down in the
so-called Municipal Law of Caesar as a qualification for a seat in a
municipal Senate.' (Matheson)

<span id="fn_22"></span>[2-8](dep049.htm#fr_22) 'The best-known instance
of this sophism is "Epimenides says the Cretans are always liars, but he
is himself a Cretan. Does he lie or tell the truth?"' (Matheson)

<span id="fn_23"></span>[2-9](dep050.htm#fr_23) Cf. Book II, chap. XIX.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[2-10](dep052.htm#fr_24) The text is corrupt
here.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[2-12](dep055.htm#fr_26) 'According to the
Stoics the "spirit" of vision connected the central mind with the pupil
of the eye and similarly with other senses.' (Matheson)
