#### Argument the Sixth.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Demiurgus alone can dissolve the
world: for Plato says \[in the Timæus\] that it is in every respect
indissoluble, except by him by whom it was bound; for every where it is
the province of him who knows \[and is the cause of\] a bond, to know
also the mode of dissolving that which he bound; and it is the province
of him who knows the mode of dissolution to dissolve. But the Demiurgus
will never dissolve the world. For it is he who says \[in the Timæus of
Plato\], "that it pertains only to an evil nature to dissolve that which
is beautifully harmonised and constituted well." But as it is impossible
for him who is truly good to be evil, it is impossible that the world
should be dissolved. For neither can it be dissolved by any other,
because it is possible for the Demiurgus alone to dissolve it; nor can
it be dissolved by its fabricator, because it is the province

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

of an evil nature to be willing to dissolve that which is beautifully
harmonised. Either, therefore, he has not beautifully harmonised the
world, and, in this case, he is not the best of artificers; or he has
beautifully harmonised it, and will not dissolve it, lest he should
become evil, which is a thing impossible. Hence the universe is
indissoluble, and therefore incorruptible. But if incorruptible, it was
not generated <span id="fr_37"></span>[\*](#fn_37.md) \[according to a
temporal generation\]. *For corruption pertains to every thing which is
generated*, <span id="fr_38"></span>[†](#fn_38.md) as Socrates says in his
conference with Timæus on the preceding day, <span
id="fr_39"></span>[‡](#fn_39.md) not in his own words, but professing to
utter what the Muses assert. And it is evident that Timæus did not
consider this dogma of the Muses to be superfluous; since he admits that
there is a certain incorruptible genus. If, therefore, this be true,
that which is incorruptible is unbegotten, \[*i.e.* never had any
temporal beginning of its existence\]. But the world is incorruptible,
and therefore is unbegotten. Hence also the world is perpetual, if it is
unbegotten and incorruptible.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_36"></span>[44:\*](flwp11.htm#fr_36.md) This is asserted by
Plato, of heaven, or the universe, in the Timæus.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[45:\*](flwp12.htm#fr_37.md) Ου γενομενονis here
erroneously omitted in the original; but this deficiency is supplied in
the version of Mahotius, which has here "ne ortum quidem est."

<span id="fn_38"></span>[45:†](flwp12.htm#fr_38.md) In the original, παντι
γενομενῳ Φθορα εστι, but after παντι it is necessary to add γαρ.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[45:‡](flwp12.htm#fr_39.md) This is asserted in the
Eighth Book of the Republic; for it is there said, γενομενῳ παντι Φθορα
εστιν.
