### ARGUMENTS

##### IN PROOF OF

## THE ETERNITY OF THE WORLD.

1\. <span class="smallcaps">The</span> first argument is unfortunately
lost; but from what may be collected from Philoponus, the substance of
it appears to have been this: "that the artificer of the world being an
eternally energising being, and energising essentially, the universe
must be consubsistent with him, in the same manner as the sun, which
produces light by its very being, has the light so produced
consubsistent with itself, and neither is light prior or posterior to
the sun, nor the sun to light; just as the shadow which proceeds from a
body that is situated in the light, is always consubsistent with
it." <span id="fr_24"></span>[\*](#fn_24.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_24"></span>[35:\*](flwp07.htm#fr_24.md) Thus, too, Sallust, in
cap. 7, *De Diis et Mundo:* αναγκη δια την του θεου αγαθοτητα οντος του
κοσμον, αειτε τον θεον αγαθον ειναι, και τον κοσμον υπαρχειν, ωσπερ ηλιῳ
μεν και πυρι συνυφισταται φως, σωματι δε σκια. i.e. " Since the world
subsists through the goodness of divinity, it is necessary that divinity
should always be good, and that the world should always exist; just as
light is consubsistent with the sun and with fire, and shadow with the
body \[by which it is produced\]."
