*Fragments that Remain of the Lost Writings of Proclus*, by Thomas
Taylor, \[1825\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### From the Fifth Book of <span class="smallcaps">Proclus</span> on the Timæus of <span class="smallcaps">Plato</span>. <span id="fr_22"></span>[\*](#fn_22.md)

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> this book, in which he explains the
doctrine of Plato concerning material forms, he says, that qualities and
all material forms derive their subsistence, according to Plato, from
non-being, and again perish by returning into non-being, when the
composite is dissolved. He then adds as follows: "Would it not, however,
be better to say, that material forms, and not only qualities, are the
things which are said to enter into and depart from matter; for these,
and not qualities, are the resemblances of intelligibles? It is worth
while, therefore, to survey whither this form departs. If, indeed, it
departs into nature, an absurdity will ensue: for nature would receive
something similar to the things which are posterior to it, and which
proceed from it. Just as if some one should say, that any thing departs
from generation into an intelligible essence. But if we should assert
that this form departs into another matter, we should speak contrary to
what is evident. For when fire is extinguished, and the matter is
converted into air, we do not see

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

that another matter is enkindled \[after its departure\]. And if
material forms are in themselves, they will be intelligibles, and
self-subsistent and impartible natures. Whence, therefore, does bulk
derive its subsistence'? Whence interval? Whence is the war to obtain
possession of a common subject derived? For things which are in
themselves do not contend in a hostile manner for a common seat; since
neither are they indigent of a certain subject. But if material forms
are neither in nature nor in themselves, and it is not possible that
such forms should be in matter after their corruption, it is necessary
that they should proceed into non-being. For this universe would not
remain, matter always remaining, if form alone subsisted without
generation, and perished without corruption." <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_22"></span>[33:\*](flwp06.htm#fr_22.md) This extract is only
to be found in the Treatise of Philoponus against Proclus on the
Eternity of the World.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[34:\*](flwp06.htm#fr_23.md) Forms, when they
proceed into matter, and in consequence of this become materialised,
resemble (as Plotinus beautifully observes in his Treatise on the
Impassivity of Incorporeal Natures) "shadow falling upon shadow, like
images in water, or in a mirror, or a dream."
