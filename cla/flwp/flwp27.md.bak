*Fragments that Remain of the Lost Writings of Proclus*, by Thomas
Taylor, \[1825\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### From the MS. Commentary of <span class="smallcaps">Proclus</span> on the Tenth Book of the Republic of <span class="smallcaps">Plato</span>. <span id="fr_89"></span>[\*](#fn_89.md)

<span class="smallcaps">Proclus</span> having observed, that some
persons in his time have been seen sitting or standing on the sepulchres
in which they had been buried, which, says he, is also related by the
ancients of Aristeas, Hermodorus, and Epimenides, subjoins the following
examples, the first of which is taken from the History of Clearchus, the
disciple of Aristotle.

Cleonymus, the Athenian, who was a man fond of hearing philosophic
discourses, becoming

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

very sorrowful on the death of one of his associates, and giving himself
up to despair, apparently died, and was laid out according to custom;
but his mother, as she was folding him in her embraces, taking off his
garment, and kissing him, perceived in him a gentle breathing, and,
being extremely joyful on the occasion, delayed his burial. Cleonymus in
a short time afterwards was restored to life, and narrated all that he
saw and heard when he was in a separate state. He said, that his soul
appeared, as if liberated from certain bonds, to soar from its body, and
that having ascended above the earth, he saw in it places all-various
both for their figure and colour, and streams of rivers unknown to men;
and that at last he came to a certain region sacred to Vesta, which was
under the direction of dæmoniacal powers in indescribable female forms.

The second example is from the historian Naumachius, who flourished
(says Proclus) in the time of our ancestors, and is of one Polycritus,
who was an illustrious and principal man among the Ætolians. This
Polycritus died, and returned to life in the ninth month after his
death; came to the general assembly of the Ætolians, and joined with
them in their consultations about what measures were best to be

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

adopted. Hiero, the Ephesian, and other historians, testify the truth of
this, in that account of transactions which they sent to king Antigonus,
and their other absent friends.

The third is as follows: In Nicopolis, not long since, the same thing
happened to one Eurynous. This man, who was buried in the front of the
city, revived fifteen days after, and said that he saw and heard many
wonderful things under the earth, which he was ordered not to relate. He
lived some time after this, and his conduct was more just after his
revival than before.

The fourth is of Rufus, a priest of the Thessalonians, who lived near
the time of the historian Naumachius. This man was restored to life the
third day after his death, for the purpose of performing certain sacred
ceremonies, which he had promised to perform, and having fulfilled his
promise, again died.

The fifth and last is of one Philonæa, who lived under the reign of
Philip. She was the daughter of Demostratus and Charite, who lived in
Amphipolis, and died soon after her marriage to one Craterus. She
revived, however, in the sixth month after her death, and, through her
love of a youth named Machates, who came to Demostratus from his own
country Pelle, had

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

connexion with him privately for many nights successively: this amour,
however, being at length detected, she again died; previous to which,
she declared that she acted in this manner according to the will of
terrestrial dæmons. Her dead body was seen by every one lying in her
father's house; and on digging the place, which prior to this had
contained her body, it was found to be empty, by those of her kindred
who came thither, through unbelief of what had happened to her. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[\*](#fn_90.md) The truth of this narration is testified
both by the epistles of Hipparchus and those of Arridæus to Philip, in
which they give an account of the affairs of Amphipolis.

Proclus then, with his usual sagacity, observes, concerning the cause of
this phænomenon, as follows: "Many other of the ancients have collected
a history of those that have apparently died, and afterwards revived;
and among these are the natural philosopher Democritus, in his writings
concerning Hades, and that wonderful Conotes, the familiar of
Plato <span id="fr_91"></span>[†](#fn_91.md); \* \* \* for the death was
not, as it seemed, an entire desertion of the whole life of the body,
but a cessation,

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

caused by some blow, or perhaps a wound; but the bonds of the soul yet
remained rooted about the marrow, and the heart contained in its
profundity the empyreuma of life; and this remaining, it again acquired
the life which had been extinguished, in consequence of becoming adapted
to animation."

Lastly, Proclus adds: "that it is possible for the soul to depart from,
and enter into the body, is evident from him who, according to
Clearchus, used a soul-attracting wand on a sleeping lad; and who
persuaded Aristotle, as Clearchus relates in his Treatise on Sleep, that
the soul may be separated from the body, and that it enters into the
body, and uses it as a lodging. For, striking the lad with the wand, he
drew out, and, as it were, led his soul, for the purpose of evincing
that the body was immovable when the soul was at a distance from it, and
that it was preserved uninjured; but the soul being again led into the
body, by means of the wand, after its entrance narrated every
particular. From this circumstance, therefore, both the spectators and
Aristotle were persuaded that the soul is separate from the body."
