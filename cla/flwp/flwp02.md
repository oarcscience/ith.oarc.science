### ON LIGHT. <span id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5)

<span class="smallcaps">If</span> with respect to light, one kind is
material, but another immaterial, according to the difference of those
illuminating natures, fire and the sun, the light which is immaterial
is, *in a certain respect*, <span id="fr_6"></span>[†](#fn_6) corrupted;
but material light, in a certain respect, pervades through material
substances: for the whole air appears to be no less illuminated by the
sun than by the fire that is procured by us. And when clouds pass under
the sun, the light is in

one part intercepted, and we do not receive the whole of it. For how can
the light which is in the heavens be continuous with that which is in
the air? since the latter is corruptible, but the former not. And the
one, indeed, is suspended from its proper principle; but the other, if
it should so happen, is cut off, and sometimes is not. The corruptible,
however, is not continuous with the incorruptible: for two things of
this kind are specifically different from each other.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[1:\*](flwp02.htm#fr_5) This and the five
following Fragments are to be found in the Treatise of Philoponus
against Proclus, on the Eternity of the World.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[1:†](flwp02.htm#fr_6) Immaterial light is, *in a
certain respect*, corrupted, because the recipient of it is corruptible;
and when this is corrupted, the light which it received departs to its
fountain, the sun.
