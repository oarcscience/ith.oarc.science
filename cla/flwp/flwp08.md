#### Argument the Second.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> paradigm of the world is eternal; and
his existence, as a paradigm, is that which is essential, and not
accidental to him. But because he possesses the power of being a
paradigm essentially, hence, as <span id="fr_25"></span>[\*](#fn_25.md) he
is eternal, he will be eternally the paradigm of the world. If, however,
an existence eternally is present with the paradigm, the image also will
necessarily always exist; for a paradigm is a paradigm with reference to
an image. But if the image was not when the paradigm was not, neither
will the paradigm be when the image is not; <span
id="fr_26"></span>[†](#fn_26.md) since, in this case, it will no longer be
a paradigm. For either it will not be a paradigm if the image is not, or
it will not be the paradigm of the image. Of things, therefore, which
are predicated with reference to each other, the one cannot exist if the
other is not. Hence, if the paradigm of the world is eternally the
paradigm of it, the world *always* is an image of an eternally existing
paradigm.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_25"></span>[36:\*](flwp08.htm#fr_25.md) For διατι, in the
original, it is necessary to read διοτι.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[36:†](flwp08.htm#fr_26.md) Because the paradigm
here is essentially a paradigm, so as not to exist without being a
paradigm.
