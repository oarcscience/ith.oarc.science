#### Argument the Twelfth.

<span class="smallcaps">Every</span> thing which is generated requires
matter, and an efficient cause; so that, if that which is generated does
not exist always, but only sometimes, this takes place either through
the inaptitude of the matter, or through the efficient cause failing in
productive energy, or

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

through both these; neither the matter being adapted, nor the maker
possessing a sufficiency of productive power. If, therefore, the world
formerly was not, or will not be hereafter, this will happen to it
either through the matter of which it consists, or through the cause by
which the world was produced. The maker of the world, however, always
possesses a sufficiency of productive power, since he is eternally the
same, and does not subsist differently at different times. Either,
therefore, neither now does the maker of the world possess a sufficiency
of effective power, or he possesses this now, and did formerly, and will
hereafter. And with respect to matter, either it was always adapted to
be adorned after the sane manner as it is now, or neither now, though it
always subsists after the same manner: for matter remains invariably the
same, just as the maker of the world is immutable. If, therefore, every
thing which at one time is, but at another is not, is such, either
through the insufficiency of the maker, or through matter not always
possessing a proper aptitude; but the maker of the world, is not at one
time sufficient to produce it, and at another not sufficient, nor is
matter at one time properly adapted, but at another not;—if this be the
case, the world will not exist at one time, but at another not. The
Demiurgus, therefore,

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

produces, matter is adorned, and the world is for ever.
