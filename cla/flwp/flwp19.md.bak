#### Argument the Thirteenth.

<span class="smallcaps">Plato</span> says, "that Divinity imparted to
the world a motion adapted to a spherical body, viz. a circular motion,
which especially subsists about intellect and wisdom." If; therefore, he
grants that this motion is adapted to the world, he will also grant that
heaven, or the universe, naturally resolves in a circle; but if it has
this motion according to nature, we must say, that neither a motion
upward, nor a motion downward, \[nor a progressive motion,\] <span
id="fr_51"></span>[\*](#fn_51.md) pertain to it. These, however, are the
motions of the sublunary elements. <span id="fr_52"></span>[†](#fn_52.md)
It is necessary, therefore, that heaven should be exempt from the
rectilinear

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

motions of \[sublunary\] bodies. Hence, it is neither fire, nor earth,
nor any one of the bodies which are situated between these; nor is a
celestial body light or heavy, if that which tend downwards is heavy,
and that which tend upward is light; but if that which is moved in a
circle is no one of these elements, it will be something different from
them. If, therefore, generation and corruption, are among the number of
things contrary to each other; but things which have contrary motions
according to nature, are contraries, and one thing is contrary to one,
(for this is said by Plato in the Protagoras,) — if this be the case,
these things, indeed, will be corrupted and generated; but a celestial
body will be unbegotten and incorruptible. If, however, these \[*i.e.*
the celestial and sublunary wholes\] are in their parts, indeed,
generated and corrupted, but the wholes always exist according to
nature, remaining in their proper places, and if the world consists of
these, viz. of heaven, and the wholes of the four elements;this being
the case, the world will be without generation, and without corruption.
Such things, therefore, as are in any way whatever generated and
corrupted, are the effects, and not parts <span
id="fr_53"></span>[\*](#fn_53.md) of

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

the world, the Gods which it contains (as Plato says) <span
id="fr_54"></span>[\*](#fn_54.md) borrowing parts from the world, and the
genera of efficient causes, as things which are

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

again to be restored to it. These, however, have the appearance of being
parts of the universe, which are comprehended in it; though other
effects also are comprehended in their proper causes, and are connected
by them. Hence, if the world consists of things which are unbegotten and
incorruptible, it will itself be unbegotten and incorruptible in a much
greater degree. For the whole would be less excellent than its parts, if
it indeed had generation and corruption, but the parts, on the contrary,
were without generation, and without corruption; though it is Plato
himself who says, that the whole is more excellent than the parts. For
the whole is not for the sake of the parts, but the parts are for the
sake of the whole. But that for the sake of which a thing exists, \[or
the final cause,\] is better than those things which subsist for the
sake of the final cause. The elements, however, are parts of that which
has its composition from them. And hence, that which consists of the
elements, is more excellent than the elements of which it consists. If,
therefore, heaven, or the universe, consists of unbegotten and
incorruptible elements, it will also itself be unbegotten and
incorruptible. And this likewise is demonstrated from Platonic
principles.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_51"></span>[60:\*](flwp19.htm#fr_51.md) The words within the
brackets are added from the version of Mahotius, whose version of this
sentence is, "Quare si à natura motum hunc obtinet, neque eum motum, quo
sursùm itur, neque eum, quo deorsum descenditur, *neque progressionem*
ipsi convenire dixerimus." But the Greek is, ει δε ταυτην εχει κατα
φυσιν κινησιν, ουτ᾽ αν την επι το ανω κινησιν, ουτε την επι το κατω
φαιμεν αυτοῳ προσηεκειν. It appears, therefore, that immediately after
κατω, it is requisite to insert the words ουτε την κατα πορωειαν.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[60:†](flwp19.htm#fr_52.md) This sentence shews the
necessity of the above emendation. For the motion of fire and air is
upward, of earth downward, and the motion of water is *progressive*.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[61:\*](flwp19.htm#fr_53.md) "Part" (says Proclus,
in his Commentary on the Parmenides of Plato,) "has a manifold
signification; for we call that <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> a part,
which is in a certain respect the same with the whole, and which
possesses all such things partially, as the whole does totally. Thus, we
call each of the multitude of intellects, a part of the intellect which
ranks as a whole, though all forms exist in each; and we say, that the
inerratic sphere is a part of the universe, though this sphere also
comprehends all things in itself, yet in a manner different from that in
which they are comprehended by the world. In the second place, we
denominate that to be a part which gives completion to a certain thing.
Thus, we say, that the whole \[celestial and sublunary\] spheres, are
parts of the universe, and that the ratiocinative power, and the power
by which we opine, are parts of the soul; the former of which give
completion to the universe, but the latter to the soul. In addition to
these, likewise, we denominate, according to a common signification,
every thing a part, which in any way whatever is co-arranged with
certain things, in order to effect the consummation of one thing. For
thus it may be said, that each of us is a part of the world, not that
the universe, so far as it is the universe, receives its completion
through its; for neither would the universe become imperfect, by the
destruction of any one of us; but because we also are co-arranged with
the parts of the universe that rank as wholes, and are governed in
conjunction with all other things, and are, in short, in the world as in
one animal, are ourselves parts of the universe, and give completion to
it, not so far as it exists, but so far as it is prolific." What is here
said, therefore, by Proclus, about the natures which are generated and
corrupted in the world, are parts of it, according to the last
signification of part, as above explained.
