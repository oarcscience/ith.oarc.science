*Fragments that Remain of the Lost Writings of Proclus*, by Thomas
Taylor, \[1825\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### From the Treatise in which a Solution is given of Ten Doubts against Providence.

<span class="smallcaps">Providence</span>, therefore, as we have said,
being defined by *the one* and *the good*, and the good subsisting prior
to intellect,—for intellect and all beings aspire after *the good*, but
*the good* does not aspire after intellect,—it is necessary that the
knowledge of providence should be above the knowledge of intellect. And
thus it is also necessary that providence should know all things, by
*the one* of itself, according to which one, it likewise benefits every
thing intellective and non-intellective, vital and non-vital, beings and
non-beings; <span id="fr_20"></span>[\*](#fn_20.md) impressing in all
things a unity, as an

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

image of its Own one. In short, we assert that this one is productive of
all things, we likewise say, that all things are preserved by it,—as
that which has an hyparxis more true than all essence, and more manifest
than all knowledge,—not being divided with, nor moved about, the objects
of knowledge. For of these things, physical and intellectual knowledge
has the peculiarities. For every intellect is *one many*, both in its
existence, and its intellection. And every soul, since it is motion,
intellectually perceives in conjunction with motion. But the one of
providence abiding in its unity, being at one and the same time
intransitive and indivisible, knows all things after the same manner;
and thus knows, not only man and sun, and every other thing of this
kind, but also every thing which ranks among particulars. For nothing
escapes the knowledge of this one, whether you speak of its existence,
or its capability of being known. Thus, the transcendently united
knowledge of providence, is a knowledge of all divisible natures, in the
same impartible one, and likewise of things the most indivisible, and of
such as are most total. And as it gave subsistence to every thing by its
own one, so by the same one, every thing is known by it. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_20"></span>[31:\*](flwp05.htm#fr_20.md) In the original,
immediately after καθο και αγαθυνει παντα τα νοουντα, it appears to me
that the words και τα μη νοουντα, και ζωντα, are wanting. This defect I
have supplied in the above translation.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[32:\*](flwp05.htm#fr_21.md) This extract is to be
found in the Treatise of Philoponus against Proclus on the Eternity of
the World.
