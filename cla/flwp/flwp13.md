#### Argument the Seventh.

IF the soul of the universe is unbegotten and incorruptible, the world
also is unbegotten and incorruptible. For the soul of the world, and
likewise every soul, is essentially self-motive; but every thing
self-motive is the fountain and principle of motion. If, therefore, the
soul of the universe is perpetual, it is necessary that the universe
should always be moved by this soul. For as the universe was not moved
by the motion of soul, either prior or posterior to soul, it is not
possible that soul should not be the principle of its motion, since it
is essentially self-motive, and on this account is the principle of
motion. Moreover, soul, through being self-motive, is unbegotten and
incorruptible. The universe, therefore, is un-begotten and
incorruptible. Hence it is evident that every \[rational soul\] first
ascends into a perpetual body \[as into a vehicle\], and always moves
this body. <span id="fr_40"></span>[\*](#fn_40) And likewise, when it is
in corruptible bodies, it moves them, though the bodies which are
perpetually moved by it.
