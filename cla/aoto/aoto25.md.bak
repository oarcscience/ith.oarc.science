#### ULYSSES CONVERSES WITH EUMÆUS, AND WITH HIS HERDSMAN PHILŒTIUS—THE SUITORS AGAIN MALTREAT HIM—THEOCLYMENUS FORETELLS THEIR DOOM AND LEAVES THE HOUSE.

Ulysses made himself a bed of an untanned ox-hide in the vestibule and
covered himself with sheep skins; then Eurynome threw a cloak over him.
He saw the women who misbehaved themselves with the suitors go giggling
out of the house, and <span class="margnote"><span
id="an_20:6">6</span></span> was sorely tempted to kill them then and
there, but he restrained himself. He kept turning round and round, as a
man turns a paunch full of blood and fat before a hot fire to cook it,
and could get no rest till Minerva came to him and comforted him, by
reminding him that he was now in Ithaca.

"That is all very well," replied Ulysses, "but suppose I do <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_20:36">36</span></span> kill these
suitors, pray consider what is to become of me then? Where am I to fly
to from the revenge their friends will take upon me?"

"One would think," answered Minerva, "that you might <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_20:44">44</span></span> trust even a
feebler aid than mine; go to sleep; your troubles shall end shortly."

Ulysses then slept, but Penelope was still wakeful, and <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_20:54">54</span></span> lamented her
impending marriage, and her inability to sleep, in such loud tones that
Ulysses heard her, and thought she was close by him.

It was now morning and Ulysses rose, praying the while to <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_20:91">91</span></span> Jove. "Grant me,"
he cried, "a sign from one of the people who are now waking in the
house, and another sign from outside it."

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:102">102</span></span> Forthwith
Jove thundered from a clear sky. There came also a miller woman from the
mill-room, who, being weakly, <span class="margnote"><span
id="an_20:110">110</span></span> had not finished her appointed task as
soon as the others had done; as she passed Ulysses he heard her curse
the suitors and pray for their immediate death. Ulysses was thus assured
that he should kill them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:122">122</span></span> The other
women of the house now lit the fire, and Telemachus came down from his
room.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:129">129</span></span> "Nurse,"
said he, "I hope you have seen that the stranger has been duly fed and
lodged. My mother, in spite of her many virtues, is apt to be too much
impressed by inferior people, and to neglect those who are more
deserving."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:134">134</span></span> "Do not
find fault, child," said Euryclea, "when there is no one to find fault
with. The stranger sat and drank as much wine as he liked. Your mother
asked him if he would take any more bread, but he said he did not want
any. As for his bed, he would not have one, but slept in the vestibule
on an untanned hide, and I threw a cloak over him myself."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:144">144</span></span> Telemachus
then went out to the place of assembly, and his two dogs with him. "Now,
you women," said Euryclea, "be quick and clean the house down. Put the
cloths on the seats, sponge down the tables; wash the cups and mixing
bowls, and go at once, some of you, to fetch water from the fountain. It
is a feast day, and the suitors will be here directly." So twenty of
them went for water, and others busied themselves setting things
straight about the house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:160">160</span></span> The men
servants then came and chopped wood. The women came back from the
fountain, and Eumæus with them, bringing three fine pigs, which he let
feed about the yards. When he saw Ulysses he asked him how he was
getting on, and Ulysses prayed that heaven might avenge him upon the
suitors.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:172">172</span></span> Then
Melanthius came with the best goats he had, and made them fast in the
gate-house. When he had done this he gibed at Ulysses, but Ulysses made
him no answer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:185">185</span></span> Thirdly
came Philœtius with a barren heifer and some fat goats for the suitors.
These had been brought over for him by the boatman who plied for all
corners. When he saw

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ulysses, he asked
Eumæus who he was, and said he was very like his lost master. Then he
told Ulysses how well his old master had treated him, and how well also
he had served his old master. Alas! that he was no longer living. "We
are fallen," said he, "on evil times, and I often think that though it
would not be right of me to drive my cattle off, and put both myself and
them under some other master while Telemachus is still alive, yet even
this would be better than leading the life I have to lead at present.
Indeed I should have gone off with them long ago, if I did not cling to
the hope that Ulysses may still return."

"I can see," said Ulysses, "that you are a very honest and <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_20:226">226</span></span> sensible person.
Therefore I will swear you a solemn oath that Ulysses will be here
immediately, and if you like you shall see him with you own eyes kill
the suitors."

While they were thus conversing the suitors were again <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_20:240">240</span></span> plotting the
murder of Telemachus, but there appeared an unfavourable omen, so
Amphinomus said they had better go to the house and get dinner ready,
which they accordingly did. When they were at table, Eumæus gave them
their cups, Philœtius handed round the bread and Melantheus poured them
out their wine. Telemachus purposely set Ulysses at a little table on
the part of the cloister that was paved with stone, and told the suitors
that it should be worse for any of them who molested him. "This," he
said, "is not a public house, but it is mine, for it has come to me from
Ulysses."

The suitors were very angry but Antinous checked them. <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_20:268">268</span></span> "Let us put up
with it," said he; "if Jove had permitted, we should have been the death
of him ere now." Meanwhile, it being the festival of Apollo, the people
of the town were bearing his holy hecatomb about the streets.

The servants gave Ulysses an equal portion with what they <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_20:279">279</span></span> gave the others,
for Telemachus had so bidden them. Presently one of the suitors named
Ctesippus observed this and said, "I see the stranger has as good a
portion as any one else. I will give him a better, that he may have
something to give <span class="margnote"><span
id="an_20:296">296</span></span> the bath-woman or some other of the
servants in the house"—and with this he flung a cow's heel at Ulysses’
head.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:302">302</span></span> Ulysses
smiled with a grim Sardinian <span id="fr_41"></span>[\*](#fn_41.md) smile,
and bowed his head so that the heel passed over it and hit the wall.
Telemachus rebuked Ctesippus very fiercely, and all were silent till
Agelaus tried to calm them saying, "What Telemachus has said is just:
let us not answer. Nevertheless I would urge him to talk quietly with
his mother and tell her that as long as there was any chance of Ulysses
coming back there was nothing unreasonable in her deferring a second
marriage; but there is now no hope of his return, and if you would enjoy
your own in peace, tell her to marry the best man among us and the one
who will make her the most advantageous offer."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:338">338</span></span> "Nay,"
answered Telemachus, "it is not I that delay her marriage. I urge her to
it, but I cannot and will not force her."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:345">345</span></span> Then
Minerva made the suitors break out into a forced hysterical laughter,
and the meats which they were eating became all smirched with blood.
Their eyes were filled with tears and their hearts were oppressed with
terrible forebodings. Theoclymenus saw that all was wrong, and said,
"Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud of darkness
drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet with tears; the
air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof beams drip blood;
the gate of the cloisters, and the yard beyond them are full of ghosts
trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out from
heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:358">358</span></span> The
suitors laughed at him, and Eurymachus said, "If you find it so dark
here, we had better send a man with you to take you out into the open."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:363">363</span></span> "I have
eyes," he answered, "that can guide, and feet that can take me from the
doom that I see overhanging every single one of you." On this he left
them and went back to the house of Piræus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20:375">375</span></span> Then one
of the suitors said, "Telemachus, you are very unfortunate in your
guests. You had better ship both the

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

stranger and this man off to the Sicels and sell them." Telemachus made
no answer, but kept his eye on his father for any signal that he might
make him.

Penelope had had a seat placed for her overlooking the <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_20:387">387</span></span> cloister, and
heard all that had passed. The dinner had been good and plentiful and
there had been much laughter, for they had slaughtered many victims, but
little did they guess the terrible supper which the goddess and a strong
man were preparing for them.
