### Chapter VIII

### THAT ITHACA AND SCHERIA ARE BOTH OF THEM DRAWN FROM TRAPANI AND ITS IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.

<span class="smallcaps">I have</span> now given, though far more briefly
than the subject requires, some of my reasons for believing that from
the first Book of the "Odyssey" to the last we are in the hands of a
young woman. Who, then, was she? Where did she live and write? She was
of flesh and blood, lived in time and place, looked on sea and sky, came
and went somewhither and somewhen—but where? and when? and above all,
who? It will be my object to throw what light I can upon these subjects
in the following chapters.

I will follow the same course that I have taken earlier, and retrace the
steps whereby I was led to my conclusions.

By the time I had finished Book x. I was satisfied that the "Odyssey"
was not a man's work, but I had seen nothing to make me think that it
was written rather at one place than at another. When, however, I
reached xiii. 159-164, in which passage Neptune turns the Phæacian ship
into a rock at the entrance of the Scherian harbour, I felt sure that an
actual feature was being drawn from, and made a note that no place,
however much it might lie between two harbours, would do for Scheria,
unless at the end of one of them there was a small half sunken rock.
Presently I set myself to consider what combination of natural features
I ought to look for on the supposition that Scheria was a real place,
and made a list of them as follows:—

1\. The town must be placed on a point of land jutting out as a land's
end into the sea between two harbours, or bays in which ships could ride
(vi. 263); it must be connected with the mainland by a narrow neck of
land, and as I have just said, must have a half sunken formidable rock
at the entrance of one of the harbours.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

2\. There must be no river running into either harbour, or Nausicaa
would not have had to go so far to wash her clothes. The river when
reached might be nothing but a lagoon with a spring or two of fresh
water running into it, for the clothes were not, so it would seem,
washed in a river; they were washed in public washing cisterns ("Od."
vi. 40, 86, 92) which a small spring would keep full enough of water "to
wash clothes even though they were very dirty." The scene is laid close
on the sea shore, for the clothes are put out to dry on a high bank of
shingle which the sea had raised, and Nausicaa's maidens fly from
Ulysses along the beach and spits that run into the sea.

3\. There must be a notable mountain at no great distance from the town
so as to give point to Neptune's threat that he would bury it under a
high mountain. Furthermore, the whole combination above described must
lie greatly further west of Eubœa than Ithaca was, and hence greatly
west of Ithaca (vii. 321). Surely, if a real place is being drawn from,
these indications are ample to ensure its being easily found.

Men of science, so far as I have observed them, are apt in their fear of
jumping to a conclusion to forget that there is such a thing as jumping
away from one, and Homeric scholars seem to have taken a leaf out of
their book in this respect. How many striking points of correspondence,
I wonder, between an actual place and one described in a novel, would be
enough to create a reasonable assurance that the place in which they
were combined was the one that was drawn from? I should say four well
marked ones would be sufficient to make it extremely improbable that a
like combination could be found elsewhere; make it five and unless we
find something to outweigh the considerations which so close a
correspondence between the actual place and the one described in the
novel would suggest, or unless by some strange coincidence the same
combination in all its details can be shown to occur in some other and
more probable locality, we may be sure that the novel was drawn from the
place; for every fresh detail in the combination required decreases the
probability of error in geometrical ratio if it be duly complied with.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

Let us suppose that a policeman is told to look out for an elderly
gentleman of about sixty; he is a foreigner, speaks a little English but
not much, is lame in his left foot, has blue eyes, a bottle nose, and is
about 5 ft. 10 in. high. How many of these features will the policeman
require before he feels pretty sure that he has found his man? If he
sees any foreigner he will look at him. If he sees one who is about 5
ft. 10 in. high he will note his age, if this proves to be about sixty
years, and further, if the man limps on his left foot, he will probably
feel safe in stopping him. If, as he is sure to do, he finds he has a
bottle nose, he will leave the blue eyes and broken English alone, and
will bring the man before the magistrate.

If it is then found that the man's eyes are hazel, and that he either
speaks English fluently or does not speak it at all—is the magistrate
likely to discharge the prisoner on account of these small discrepancies
between him and the description given of him, when so many other of the
required characteristics are found present? Will he not rather require
the prisoner to bring forward very convincing proof that it is a case of
mistaken identity?

Or to take another illustration, which is perhaps more strictly to the
point as involving comparison between an actual place and one described
in a novel. Here is an extract from a novel:—

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Grammerton, like other fair cities, was built on a hill. The highest
point was the fine old Elizabethan School, then, and now, of European
reputation. Opposite it was the old shattered and ruined castle,
overlooking the bubbling and boiling shallows of the broad and rapid
river Saber. . . . From the hill the town sloped rapidly down on every
side towards the river, which made it a peninsula studded with
habitations. (*The Beauclercs, Father and Son*, by Charles Clarke,
Chapman and Hall. Vol. 1. p. 28.)

</div>

Is there any man of ordinary intelligence and acquainted with Shrewsbury
who will doubt that Shrewsbury was the place that Mr. Clarke was drawing
from?

When I have urged the much more numerous and weightier points of
agreement between Scheria as described in the "Odyssey," and Trapani as
it still exists, eminent Homeric

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

scholars have told me, not once nor twice—and not meekly, but with an
air as though they were crushing me—that my case rests in the main on
geographical features that are not unknown to other parts of the coast,
and upon legends which also belong to other places.

Grammerton, they argue—to return to my illustration—must not be held as
Shrewsbury, for at Harrow as well as Shrewsbury the School is on the
highest part of the town. There is a river, again, at Eton, so that Eton
may very well have been the place intended. It is highly fanciful to
suppose that the name Saber may have been a mere literary travesty of
Sabrina. At Nottingham there is a castle which was in ruins but a few
years since, and from which one can see the Trent. Nottingham,
therefore, is quite as likely to be the original of Grammerton as
Shrewsbury is.

And so on *ad infinitum*. This line of argument consists in ignoring
that the force of the one opposed to it lies in the demonstrable
existence of a highly complex combination, the component items of which
are potent when they are all found in the same place, but impotent
unless combined. It is a line which eminent Homeric scholars almost
invariably take when discussing my Odyssean theory, but it is not one
which will satisfy those before whom even the most eminent of Homeric
scholars must in the end bow—I mean, men of ordinary common sense. These
last will know that Grammerton can only be dislodged from Shrewsbury on
proof either that the features of Shrewsbury do not in reality
correspond with those of Grammerton, or else that there is another town
in England which offers the same combination, and is otherwise more
acceptable.

So with Trapani and Scheria. Eminent Homeric scholars must show that I
have exaggerated the points of correspondence between the two
places—which in the face of Admiralty charts and of the "Odyssey" they
will hardly venture; or they must bring forward some other place in
which the same points of correspondence are found combined—which they
will not attempt; or they must show reason for thinking that the very
numerous and precise correspondences between Trapani and all

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Scherian and
Ithacan scenes are referable to mere accident—and this will satisfy
those only who will believe that a man has held thirteen trumps in his
hand three deals running, without having tampered with the cards. I need
not discuss this last supposition, and as for the other two, I can only
assure the reader that no attempt has been made to establish either of
them during the close on six years since my theory was first put before
the public.

Neither will it ever be made. For Scheria should be looked for on some
West coast to the West of Greece, and there are no such West coasts
except those of Italy and Sicily, both of which I know well enough to be
sure that if the Scherian combination could be found elsewhere than at
Trapani I should long since have found it. Even could such a place be
found with its rock Malconsiglio, legend and all, before it could
compete with Trapani in claiming the "Odyssey" it would have to offer
the Ithacan combination as well as the Scherian; for surely a place
which provides us with both Ithacan and Scherian topography would have a
greater right to be considered as that from which the "Odyssey" was
drawn, than one which could only offer the details of Scheria.

Furthermore, could they find another place with all both Scherian and
Ithacan features, my opponents would be only half way through their
troubles; for Trapani could still hold its own against it, unless it
also had four islands (neither more nor fewer) lying off it, one of them
long and narrow, and all of them corresponding with the inaccurate
Odyssean description of the Ionian islands. Nor would it even then begin
to be on equal terms with Trapani, till it was shown that the effective
part of the voyages of Ulysses begins and ends with it. When all this
has been done, but not before, it will be time to weigh the comparative
claims to the two sites.

For I rest my case on the harmonious concurrence of four lines of
argument, each requiring the fulfilment of many and very rigorous
conditions, and each by itself sufficient to raise a strong presumption
that Trapani was the place which was most prominent in the mind of the
writer of the "Odyssey." They are:

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

1\. That Scheria is drawn from Trapani. This I will substantiate by
bringing forward a much stronger combination of correspondences than
exists between Grammerton and Shrewsbury.

2\. That Ithaca also is drawn from Trapani and its immediate
neighbourhood. My case for this will be found even stronger if possible
than that by which I established that Scheria was Trapani.

3\. That the Ionian islands as described in the "Odyssey" cannot have
been drawn from the actual Ionian islands, nor from any others but those
off Trapani; and that the writer sinned against her own knowledge in
order to force these islands into her narrative.

4\. That the voyages of Ulysses practically resolve themselves into a
voyage from Troy to the neighbourhood of Sicily, and thenceforward into
a sail round Sicily, beginning with Trapani and ending with the same
place.

It will be necessary that no argument adduced in support of any of these
propositions should clash with those in support of any other, but all
the four lines of argument must corroborate each other, so that they fit
into one another as the pieces of a child's puzzle. It is inconceivable
that anything but a true theory should comply with conditions so
exacting. I will now proceed to show that Scheria is Trapani, and will
return to the steps by which I arrived at this conclusion.

Armed with the list of points I had to find in combination, as given at
the beginning of this chapter, I went down to the map room of the
British Museum intending to search the Mediterranean from the Troad to
Gibraltar if necessary; but remembering that I ought to look (for
reasons already given) some distance West of Greece, and also that the
writer of the "Odyssey" appeared to have lived on a coast that looked
West not East, I resolved to search the West coasts first. I knew that
Colonel Mure and a respectable weight of ancient testimony had placed
the Cyclopes on Mt. Eryx, and it seemed to me that the island where
Ulysses hunted the goats, and the whole Cyclopes incident suggested
drawing from life more vividly than any other part of the voyages. I
knew, moreover, that

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

the writer was a young woman who was little likely to have travelled,
and hence felt sure that if one place could be found, none of the others
would be long in finding; I asked, therefore, for the map of the
Lilybæan promontory, as the West coast West of Greece that offered the
greatest prospect of success, and hardly had I got it in my hand before
I found the combination

<span id="img_16400"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![TRAPANI AND MT.

TRAPANI AND MT. ERYX  
</span>

I wanted for Scheria lying right under Mt. Eryx. The land's end jutting
into the sea—the two harbours one on either side of it—the narrow
entrance between two marshes—the high mountain hard by—the rock at the
entrance of one of the harbours—the absence of any river—will be found
in the map here given, which Messrs. Walker & Boutall have made for me
from the Italian Government survey, and from our own Admiralty chart.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

But this was not all. Not only was the rock of the right height, and so
turned as to give the idea of a ship coming into port, but it bore the
strange name of Malconsiglio, or "Evil counsel." I was so much struck
with this that I wrote to Trapani enquiring whether there existed any
local tradition in connection with the rock, and was told that there
were two—the one absurd, and the other to the effect that the rock had
been a ship of Turkish Pirates who were coming to attack Trapani, but
were turned into stone at the entrance of the harbour by the Madonna di
Trapani. I did not doubt that the name and the legend between them
preserved the Odyssean version, in a Christianised form—the legend
recording the fact of a ship's having been turned into stone as it was
entering harbour, and the name telling us the other fact that this had
been brought about in consequence of an evil counsel.

I believe the above sufficient for reasonable assurance that Scheria was
drawn from Trapani, and will, therefore, proceed to establish that the
Ithaca scenes are drawn also from the same place and its immediate
neighbourhood.

To this end it will be incumbent upon me to find that near Trapani,
though not actually at the town, there exists, or can be shown to have
in all reasonable probability existed, a harbour which has, or had, a
current in it, and which lies hard by the foot of a mountain. This
harbour should have a shelving bottom, for the Phæacian crew which
brought Ulysses to Ithaca ran half the ship's length on shore before the
way was off it. At no great distance there must be two caves near
together (xiii. 103-112 and 347-349). One of them must have two
entrances—one turned towards the North, by which people can go down into
the cave, and the other towards the South, by which the gods alone can
enter. It must have water in it, and also prehistoric implements should
be found there. From near it one must be able to see harbours (in the
plural), and it should be on the side of a mountain. Here Ulysses hid
the treasures that the Phæacians had given him. The other cave need
present no special features.

A man ascending the mountain from these caves, and keeping along the top
of it should come to a place on ground

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

commanding an extensive prospect, where there is a spring and a rock
that is called Raven. This site must be bitterly cold in winter, and
must be about two hours' walk from Trapani; the path to the town must be
so rugged that a man in ordinary vigour would not like to take it
without having a stick; and lastly, it must pass a notable mound or hill
much nearer Trapani than the high ground above alluded to, and
commanding a full view of the city and harbour. The reader who turns to
the abridgement of Books xiii., xiv., xv., xvi. and xvii. given in this
work, will find that all these points are necessary.

They all of them exist at this day, even to the calling of the rock
"Raven," except one—I mean the mouth of the harbour where the Phæacians
entered; this is now silted up, like the harbour of Selinunte, <span
id="fr_61"></span>[\*](#fn_61.md) which I might almost call on the same
coast. The inner part of the harbour is still full of sea water, but has
been converted into Salt Works <span id="fr_62"></span>[†](#fn_62.md) which
are slightly below the level of the sea. The bed of the old exit is
clearly seen, and there are still rushes in it though it is quite dry:
it is very narrow, is often full in winter, and is marked with dotted
lines in the Italian Ordnance Map, but not so in our Admiralty Chart.

The existence of this bed was pointed out to me by Signor Sugameli, of
Trapani. He assured me that till 1848 when the Salt Works were made, the
whole space covered by them was an open mere where his father used to go
to shoot wild ducks. One great difficulty in making the Salt Works was
the abundance of fresh water springs, which made it necessary to cement
the salt pans in order to keep the fresh water from mixing with the
salt. It was perhaps from some of these springs that the πλυνοί, or
washing cisterns, of vi. 40 were supplied—unless indeed Nausicaa washed
the clothes in sea water as I have seen women in the island of
Pantellaria still do.

Given a mass of water, nearly a mile long and a quarter of a mile broad,
with a narrow exit, and the tide, which here has a rise and fall of from
two to three feet, would cause a current

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

that at times would be strong, and justify its being described as a
river and also as a harbour with a current in it; returning for a moment
to Scheria, I suppose this to be the river at the mouth of which Ulysses
landed, and the river's staying his flow (v. 451), I take to mean that
he arrived there just at the turn of the tide. I may also say that this
harbour is used five times in the "Odyssey":

1\. As the "flowing harbour, in the country beyond the town, under Mt.
Neritum"—reading, as explained earlier, Νηρίτῳ for Νηίῳ—where Minerva
said she left her ship, when she was talking with Telemachus i. 185,
186. 2. As the place where Ulysses landed in Scheria and where Nausicaa
washed her clothes. 3. As the place where Ulysses landed in Ithaca. 4.
As the place where Telemachus landed in Ithaca on his return from Pylos
(xv. 495, &c.). 5. As the spot pointed to by Ulysses as the one where
his ship was lying "in the country beyond the town" (xxiv. 308).

I will now return to the two caves which ought to be found at no great
distance from the head of this harbour. It is clear from the text that
there were two not one, but some one has enclosed in brackets the two
lines in which the second cave is mentioned, I presume because he found
himself puzzled by having a second cave sprung upon him when up to this
point he has been only told of one.

I venture to think that if he had known the ground he would not have
been puzzled, for there are two caves, distant about 80 or 100 yards
from one another, at the place marked in the map as the *grotta del
toro*. The one is conspicuous, but without special feature; the other,
which is not very easily seen, and which is called by the peasants the
*grotta del toro*, looks due North, and is universally believed to
contain a treasure, which a bull who lives in its recesses is
continually grinding, but which can only be found by a virgin, who will
eat a whole pomegranate without spilling a single pip. I suspect the
*toro* to be a children's corruption of *tesoro*. The bull having thus
got into the cave has never got out again, and as the treasure is also
confidently known to exist—well—what can the bull be there for but to
turn a mill and grind the treasure?

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

The cave runs due South into the rock by a passage so rough and narrow
that no one is likely to go more than a very few feet with it. No one,
therefore, can enter the cavern from the South—it is only the gods who
can do so.

In August, 1894, I visited the ground with some Sicilian friends, and we
discoursed with the *contadino* who had charge of the farm on which the
caves are found. While we were talking there came up a nice intelligent
lad on a donkey, and he seemed much interested in our conversation.

"Is there," we asked, pointing to the *grotta del toro*, "a treasure in
the cave?"

"Certainly," was the immediate answer. Here the boy broke in. He was
quite sure there was one. Everybody knew it. It could not be doubted.

"Is there a treasure in the other cave?"

"Oh, no."

"Which of the two caves is called the *grotta del toro?*"

"That one "—from both peasant and boy, who pointed at once to the cave
that corresponded with the "Odyssey."

"You are quite sure that the other cave is not called 'la grotta del
toro'?"

"Quite."

"Where does the *grotta del toro* go to?"

"It gets narrow and goes far into the rock."

"Has any one ever been to the end of it?"

"No, no; no one knows where it ends. There was a cattle driver who went
in once to explore it, but he never came back, and they say that after
this there was a wall built to stop any one from going further."

"Have you ever been inside the cave yourself?"

Yes."

"Have you been as far as the wall?"

"No."

"How far did you go?"

"Not very far; I was afraid."

"Then you have no idea how far the cave goes?" "No."

"Is there water in the cave at all times?

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

"Yes."

"Have you seen it?"

"I was there in May last, and there was water then."

"Is there water there now?"

"I should think so, but cannot be certain."

"Can you take us to it?"

"No; the key of the ground is at Trapani."

"They say there is a bull in the further recesses of the cavern?"

"They say so, but we have never seen him; all we know for certain is
that there is a treasure."

Here the boy again brightened up, and said that this was certain.

When we had finished our questions the *contadino* took one of our party
aside, and said, confidentially, "Be sure of me, for I have a strong
stomach" (*i.e.*, I can keep a secret). "When you come to remove the
treasure, which I can see that you intend to do, you must take me with
you and give me my share. If you come by night the dogs will bark, and I
shall know that you are there. I will then come down and help you, but
you must give me my share."

I wrote the above conversation down, in Italian, immediately on my
return to Trapani, and my Sicilian friends signed it, at my request, as
a correct report. It occurs to me to add that there is no other cave
near Trapani to which any story of a hidden treasure attaches.

Last year (May, 1896) I visited the cave again, this time with my friend
Mr. H. Festing Jones, who has gone over the whole of the ground
described in this book, to make sure that I have not overstated my case.
We were accompanied by Signor Sugameli of Trapani, to whom I owe the
correction of my error in believing the more conspicuous of the two
caves to be called the *grotta del toro*—for so, on my first visit to
Trapani in 1892, my friends in the town had assured me, not knowing the
existence of the one which really bears the name. Jones and Signor
Sugameli scrambled into the interior of the cavern, but I, being elderly
and somewhat lame, did not venture. They found the cave end, after about
thirty feet, in

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

a mass of solid rock; but few who have gone above ten or twelve feet
will be likely to go any further, and I can well believe that the writer
of the "Odyssey," like the peasants of to-day, believed that no one
could get to the end of it. My friends found water.

The cave is full of bees’ nests in summer, as are all the caves
hereabouts. They are small, solitary, of red clay, and about the size of
the cup of an acorn. All the caves in the neighbourhood of Mt. Eryx
abound in remains of stone-age man, some fine examples of which may be
seen in the museum at Palermo. These remains would doubtless be more
common and more striking three thousand years or so ago than they are at
present, and I find no difficulty in thinking that the poetic
imagination of the writer of the "Odyssey" ascribed them to the nymphs
and naiads.

From hard by both the caves one can see, of course, the precipices of
Mt. Eryx, which I suppose to be Neritum in the mind of the writer (xiii.
351), the straight paths on the cultivated land some couple of hundred
feet below, the harbour of the old merman Phorcys, and also the harbours
of Trapani, all which are requisite by lines xiii. 195, 196, and
345-351.

The reader will note that while more than one Scherian detail is given
casually and perhaps unintentionally, as for example the harbour where
Ulysses landed in Scheria, and the harbours, which I do not doubt are
the two harbours of Trapani, there is no Ithacan detail given so far
which conflicts with any feature in the description of Scheria.

The number and value of the points of correspondence between the cave in
which Ulysses hid his treasure, and the *grotta del toro* greatly exceed
those between Grammerton and Shrewsbury. Nevertheless it will be well to
see whether his movements on leaving the cave confirm my view or make
against it.

I suppose him to have ascended the steep, and then, doubtless, wooded
slopes of Mt. Eryx and to have passed along its high and nearly level
summit (δἰ ἄκριας, xiv. 2) to the other end of the mountain, where the
Norman Castle stands now 2500 feet above the sea level. Here he
descended some two or

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

three hundred feet to the spot now called *i runzi*, where there is a
spring near a precipice which is still called *il ruccazzù dei corvi*,
*i.e.* "the rock of the ravens," it being on this part of the mountain
that these birds breed most freely. This walk would take him about two
hours, more or less.

The site is seen from far and wide, it is bitterly cold in winter, and
is connected with Trapani by a rough mountain path which Ulysses may
well have been afraid to travel without a stick (xvii. 195). <span
id="fr_63"></span>[\*](#fn_63.md) The path passes close to the round-topped
*Colle di Sta Anna* which answers perfectly to the Ἕρμαιος λόφος of xvi.
471. The time it takes to walk from the *runzi* to Trapani corresponds
with all the indications furnished us in the "Odyssey" concerning the
distance between Eumæus's hut and the town of Ithaca—which seems roughly
to have been a winter's day walk there and back.

The reader will see, therefore, that we have the whole road taken by
Ulysses from his landing in the harbour of Phorcys to the cave (with all
its complex requirements) in which he hid his presents, up Mt. Neritum,
along its long top to the spring and the Raven Rock, and finally the
path passing the hill of Mercury down to Ithaca, as accurately presented
to us by the road from the *saline di S. Cusumano* to the *grotta del
toro*, Mt. Eryx, the fountain, the Raven Rock, and the road to Trapani,
as though the "Odyssey" had been written yesterday. When the reader can
find me in all literature, ancient or modern, any like chain of
correspondences between an actual place and one described in a work of
fiction as an effect of mere chance, I will accept the coincidences to
which I have called attention as possibly accidental only; but I am
convinced that no such case nor anything approaching it can be adduced.

I, therefore, claim that Ithaca, like Scheria, must be taken as drawn
from Trapani. There is, however, this important point to be remembered,
that though the writer, when she has to consider Ithaca *ab extra*, as
an island and nothing more, pictures it to herself as the high and
striking island of

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Marettimo some 22
miles off Trapani, when she wants details she takes them from her own
immediate neighbourhood on the mainland.

Young people when transferring familiar stories to their own
neighbourhood, as almost all young people do, never stick at
inconsistencies. They are like eminent Homeric scholars, and when they
mean to have things in any given way they will not let the native hue of
resolution be balked by thought, and will find it equally easy to have
an Ithaca in one place and also in another, and to see the voyages of
Columbus to the tropics in their own sliding over a frozen pool. So Lord
Selborne writes:

<div style="font-size: 90%">

As we grew, the faculty of imagination increased in power. It coloured
all our childish pleasures; it accompanied us on the ice and into the
woods; it mixed the dreams of the supernatural with the most ordinary
things. Our resting-places when sliding over a frozen pool were the
islands discovered by Columbus or Cook, in whose voyages we delighted.

Before I leave the Ithaca scenes I ought to show that there may well
have existed at Trapani a sheet of water which cattle would be likely to
cross in a boat, as described in "Od." xx. 186-188. The land on the East
side of Trapani was artificially raised in 1860, till which time the two
seas on either side the town were often joined in winter after a
continuance of Northerly Winds. Several people have assured me that they
remember having to be carted over the water between Trapani and the
mainland. I was at first tempted to believe that Philœtius had come to
the town when the narrow entrance to it was flooded; but a few lines
above we find that Eumæus had also come to the town with three pigs, and
Melanthius with some goats. These men had both unquestionably come from
Mt. Eryx, and the text seems to forbid the idea that they too had had to
cross the water. There is nothing, however, to imply that Philœtius had
come from Mt. Eryx; indeed, it is more likely that his cattle would feed
on the flat land south of the harbour, which he had crossed by boat to
save the long

*détour* which would have been otherwise necessary. If the water had
been that of any such river as is to be found in Asia Minor, Greece, or
Sicily, one man would probably have been enough, whereas there seem to
have been several plying for hire, as in a port or harbour.

The fact that Scheria and Ithaca would be perfectly well-known by the
audience as drawn from their own neighbourhood explains another
difficulty. "How," some hypercritical listener might ask, "could so
sagacious and experienced a mariner as Ulysses have failed to note that
he was only travelling two miles, or even less, from Scheria to Ithaca?
And how again could he fail to recognise the place at which he landed as
the one where he had met Nausicaa a few days previously?"

The writer of the "Odyssey" admits with some *naiveté* that the Phæacian
mariners were already acquainted with the harbour in which they left
Ulysses. They probably would be. But how prevent Ulysses from
remonstrating both during the voyage and on being landed? It is not easy
to see what better course the writer could take than the one she
actually did take, *i.e.*, put Ulysses to sleep as soon as ever he was
on board, and not wake him till after the sailors were gone. A sleep,
therefore, is prepared for him (vii. 318, and viii. 445) and he falls
into it apparently before even leaving the harbour; it is so profound
that it is more like death than sleep (xiii. 80). Nothing, not even the
men lifting him off the ship next morning, laying all his treasures hard
by him and going away, can disturb him till the Phæacian sailors are
beyond all reach of question, Then, of course, the sooner he wakes up
the better.

As for the other difficulty of his not seeing that he was only at the
spot where he had met Nausicaa two days earlier, this was got over by
making it a misty morning, and muddling Ulysses generally so that he
does not even recognise the place as Ithaca, much less as Scheria, till
Minerva meets him and has a long talk with him, in the course of which
the audience slides into the situation, and accepts the neighbourhood of
Trapani for that of Ithaca without more demur.

excellent carriage road has been made from Trapani to the town on the
top of Mt. Eryx, but pedestrians still use the old path, which in places
is very rough.
