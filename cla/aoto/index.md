Today it is obvious to all but the most tradition-bound that women can
achieve anything that men can. This was not so obvious in the last
decade of the 19th century when Samuel Butler, a maverick classicist,
proposed this unique theory that the Odyssey was written by a woman.
This was, to say the least, a shocking proposal for his contemporaries.
Aside from the perceived diminution of the role of 'Homer,' this was too
far outside the box for most scholars. At the time Butler wrote, women
couldn't vote or own property in many industrialized countries, and some
female authors adopted male pseudonyms to get published. Biology was
considered a limiting factor for the female sex, and historic
contributions of women were ignored.

Based on textual analysis, geography, history and a bit of speculation,
Butler came to the conclusion that the Odyssey was a sequel written
several generations after the Iliad, by a woman residing in Sicily. Some
of his best evidence is simple literary criticism--Butler's observation
that women in the Odyssey are much better dimensionalized than the ones
in the Iliad.

Although his specific theory of who wrote the Odyssey is still
controversial (and probably unverifiable), today scholars are much more
open to the idea of a separate authorship of the two epics. Butler's
concept that the text of both epics was pieced together from
pre-existing bardic material about the Trojan war is also considered an
acceptable thesis. This is why this book is still read and discussed a
century later, as a milestone in the history of thought about classical
authorship, even though it was not completely vindicated.

It may seem a minor point, but it didn't help the establishment
perception of this book that Butler insisted on using Roman equivalents
for Greek deities (and the principal) throughout. Specifically, Mars =
Ares, Minerva = Athena, Aphrodite = Venus, Jupiter = Zeus, and Ulysses =
Odysseus.

Originally published in 1892 as a series of pamphlets, this etext is
based on the second edition, published in 1922. Of interest in this
edition is Butler's abridged (80 page) retelling of the story of the
Odyssey, ironically, a great resource if you have to brush up on your
'Homer.' Samuel Butler also wrote the dystopian fantasy
[Erewhon](../../utopia/ere/index.md), and, of course, his [translation of
the Iliad and Odyssey](../homer/index.md) is also available at this site.
NOTE: This etext uses Unicode extensively to present polytonic Greek, so
