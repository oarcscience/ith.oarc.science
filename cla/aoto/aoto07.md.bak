#### Book II

#### ASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA—TELEMACHUS STARTS FOR PYLOS.

Next morning, as soon as he was up and dressed, Telemachus sent the
criers round the town to call the people in assembly. When they came
together he told them of his misfortune in the death of his father, and
of the still greater one that the suitors were making havoc of his
estate. "If <span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:46">46</span></span>
anybody," he concluded, "is to eat me out of house and home I had rather
you did it yourselves; for you are men of substance, so that if I sued
you household by household I should recover from you; whereas there is
nothing to be got by suing a number of young men who have no means of
their own." <span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:85">85</span></span>

To this Antinous rejoined that it was Penelope's own fault. She had been
encouraging the suitors all the time by sending flattering messages to
every single one of them. He explained how for nearly four years she had
tricked them about the web, which she said was to be a pall for Laertes.
"The answer, therefore," said he, "that we make you is this: 'Send your
mother away, and let her marry the man of her own and of her father's
choice;' for we shall not go till she has married some one or other of
us."

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:129">129</span></span> Telemachus
answered that he could not force his mother to leave against her will.
If he did so he should have to refund to his grandfather Icarius the
dowry that Ulysses had received on marrying Penelope, and this would
bear hardly on him. Besides it would not be a creditable thing to do.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:146">146</span></span> On this
Jove sent two eagles from the top of a mountain, <span
id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md) who flew and flew in their own lordly
flight till they reached the assembly, over which they screamed and
fought, glaring death into the faces of those who were below. The people
wondered what it might all mean, till the old Soothsayer Halitherses
told them that it foreshadowed the immediate return of Ulysses to take
his revenge upon the suitors.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:177">177</span></span> Eurymachus
made him an angry answer. "As long," he concluded, "as Penelope delays
her choice, we can marry no one else, and shall continue to waste
Telemachus's estate."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:208">208</span></span> Telemachus
replied that there was nothing more to be said, and asked the suitors to
let him have a ship with a crew of twenty men, that he might follow the
advice given him by Minerva.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:224">224</span></span> Mentor now
upbraided his countrymen for standing idly by when they could easily
coerce the suitors into good behaviour, and after a few insolent words
from Leocritus the meeting dispersed. The suitors then returned to the
house of Ulysses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:260">260</span></span> But
Telemachus went away all alone by the sea side to pray. He washed his
hands in the grey waves, and implored Minerva to assist him; whereon the
goddess came up to him in the form of Mentor. She discoursed to him
about his conduct generally, and wound up by saying that she would not
only find him a ship, but would come with him herself. He was therefore
to go home and get the necessary provisions ready.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:296">296</span></span> He did as
she directed him and went home, where, after an angry scene with the
suitors, in which he again published his intention of going on his
voyage, he went down into the store

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

room and told Euryclea to get the provisions ready; at the same time he
made her take a solemn oath of secrecy for ten or twelve days, so as not
to alarm Penelope. Meanwhile Minerva, still disguised as Mentor,
borrowed a ship from a neighbour, Noëmon, and at nightfall, after the
suitors had left as usual, she and Telemachus with his crew of twenty
volunteers got the provisions on board and set sail, with a fair wind
that whistled over the waters.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_11"></span>[22:\*](aoto07.htm#fr_11.md) The mountain is
singular, as though it were an isolated mountain rather than a range
that was in the mind of the writer. It is also singular, not plural, in
the parallel cases of xv. 175 and xix 538.
