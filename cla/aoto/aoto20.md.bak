#### Book XV

#### TELEMACHUS RETURNS FROM PYLOS, AND ON LANDING GOES TO THE HUT OF EUMÆUS.

Minerva now went to Lacedæmon and found Telemachus and Pisistratus fast
asleep. She appeared to Telemachus in a dream, and told him that he was
to return at once to Ithaca, for his mother was about to marry
Eurymachus, and would <span class="margnote"><span
id="an_15:17">17</span></span> probably go off with some of his
property. She also told him how the suitors were lying in wait for him
in the straits between Ithaca and Samos. She said that as soon as he
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:29">29</span></span> reached
Ithaca he was to leave the ship before sending it on to the town, and go
to the swineherd's hut. "Sleep there," she said, "and in the morning
send the swineherd to tell Penelope that you have returned safely."

Then she went away and Telemachus woke up. He kicked <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_15:43">43</span></span> Pisistratus to
wake him, and said that they must start at once. Pisistratus answered
that this was impossible; it was still dark, and they must say good bye
to Menelaus, who, if Telemachus would only wait, would be sure to give
him a present.

At break of day, seeing Menelaus up and about, Telemachus <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_15:56">56</span></span> flung on his shirt
and cloak, and told him that they must go.

Menelaus said he would not detain them, but on the score <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_15:67">67</span></span> alike of propriety
and economy, they must have something to eat before starting, and also
receive the presents that were waiting Telemachus's acceptance. "I will
tell the servants," said he, "to get something ready for you of what
there may be in the house, and if you would like to make a tour of the
principal cities of the Peloponnese, I will conduct you. No one will
send us away empty handed. Every one will give us something."

But Telemachus said he must start at once, for he had left <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_15:86">86</span></span> property behind
him that was insecurely guarded.

When Menelaus heard this he told his wife and servants to <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_15:92">92</span></span> get dinner ready
at once. Eteoneus, who lived at no great distance, now came up, and
Menelaus told him to light the fire and begin cooking; and he did as he
was told.

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:99">99</span></span> Menelaus
then went down into his store room together with Megapenthes, and
brought up a double cup and a silver mixing bowl, while Helen fetched a
dress of wondrous beauty, the work of her own hands. Menelaus presented
the cup and <span class="margnote"><span
id="an_15:125">125</span></span> mixing bowl, and then Helen said, "Take
this, my son, as a keepsake from the hand of Helen, and let your bride
wear it on her wedding day. Till then let your dear mother keep it for
you. Thus may you go on your way with a light heart."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:130">130</span></span> Telemachus
thanked her; Pisistratus stowed the presents in the chariot, and they
all sat down to dinner. Eteoneus carved, and Megapenthes served round
the wine. When they had done eating the two young men prepared to set
out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:160">160</span></span> As they
were on the point of starting, an eagle flew upon their right hand, with
a goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm yard. This
omen was so good that every one was delighted to see it, and Pisistratus
said, "Say, king Menelaus, is the omen for us or for yourself?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:169">169</span></span> Menelaus
was in doubt how to answer, but Helen said that as the eagle had come
from a mountain and seized the goose, so Ulysses should return and take
vengeance on the suitors. Telemachus said he only hoped it might prove
so, and the pair then drove on. They reached Pylos on the following day,
and <span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:199">199</span></span>
Telemachus urged Pisistratus to drive him straight to his ship, for fear
Nestor should detain him if he went to his house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:211">211</span></span> "I know,"
said Pisistratus, "how obstinate he is. He would come down to your ship,
if he knew you were there, and would never go back without you. But he
will be very angry." He then drove to the ship, and Telemachus told the
crew to get her under way as fast as they could.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:222">222</span></span> Now as he
was attending to every thing and sacrificing to Minerva, there came to
him a man of the race of Melampus who was flying from Argos because he
had killed a man. His name was Theoclymenus and he came of an old and
highly honourable family, his father and grandfather having been
celebrated prophets and divines. He besought Telemachus to take him to
Ithaca and thus save him from enemies who were in pursuit. Telemachus
consented, took Theoclymenus on board, and laid his spear down on the
deck.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

Then they sailed away, and next day they got among the <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_15:287">287</span></span> flying
islands, <span id="fr_31"></span>[\*](#fn_31.md) whereon Telemachus
wondered whether he r. should be taken or should escape.

All this time Ulysses was in the hut with Eumæus, and <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_15:301">301</span></span> after supper
Ulysses said he should like to go down to the town next day, and see if
the suitors would take him into their service. Eumæus at once explained
to him that any such idea was out of the question. "You do not know," he
said, "what men these suitors are; their insolence reaches heaven; the
young men who wait on them have good looking faces and well kempt heads;
the tables are always clean and loaded with abundance. The suitors would
be the death of you; stay here, then, where you are in nobody's way,
till Telemachus returns from Pylos."

Ulysses thanked Eumæus for his information, and then <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_15:340">340</span></span> began to ask
whether his father and mother were still living; he was told that
Anticlea was dead, <span id="fr_32"></span>[†](#fn_32.md) and that Laertes,
though still alive, would be glad to follow her. Eumæus said he had been
brought up in their service, and was better off formerly, for there was
no getting a good word out of his mistress now, inasmuch as the suitors
had turned the house upside down.

"Servants," he said, "like to have a talk with their mistress and hear
things from her own lips; they like being told to eat and drink, and
being allowed to take something back with them into the country. This is
what will keep servants cheerful and contented."

On being further questioned by Ulysses, Eumæus told how <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_15:380">380</span></span> he had been
kidnapped as a child by some Phœnician traders who had seduced his nurse
(also a Phœnician) and persuaded her to go away with them, and bring him
with her.

"I was born," he said, "in the island of Syra over against <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_15:403">403</span></span> Ortygia, where
the sun turns. <span id="fr_33"></span>[‡](#fn_33.md) It is not populous,
but contains two cities which occupy the whole land between them, and my
father was king over them both. A few days after my

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

nurse had kidnapped me, and while we were on our voyage, Diana killed
her, and she was flung overboard, but I was taken to Ithaca where
Laertes bought me."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:493">493</span></span> Ulysses
and Eumæus spent the greater part of the night talking with one another,
and at dawn Telemachus's crew drew near to land, furled their sails and
rowed into the harbour. There they threw out their mooring stones, made
their ship fast, landed, and ate their dinner on the shore. When they
had done, Telemachus said, "Now take the ship on to the city; I will go
to look after my farm and will come down in the evening. Tomorrow
morning I will give you all a hearty meal to reward you for your
trouble."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:508">508</span></span> "But
what," said Theoclymenus, "is to become of me? To whose house am I to
go?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:512">512</span></span> "At any
other time," answered Telemachus, "I should take you to my own house,
but you would not find it convenient now, for I shall not be there, and
my mother will not see you. I shall therefore send you to the house of
Eurymachus, who is one of the first men we have, and is most eager in
his suit for my mother's hand."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:525">525</span></span> As he
spoke a hawk flew on Telemachus's right hand, with a dove whose feathers
it was plucking while it flew. Theoclymenus assured Telemachus that this
was an omen which boded most happily for the prosperity of his house. It
was then settled that Theoclymenus should go to the house of Piræus the
son of Clytius.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_15:549">549</span></span> The crew
now loosed the ship from her moorings and went on as they had been told
to do, while Telemachus wended his way in all haste to the pig farm
where Eumæus lived.
