#### Book XXII

#### THE KILLING OF THE SUITORS.

Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on the broad pavement, <span
id="fr_43"></span>[\*](#fn_43.md) with his bow and his quiver full of
arrows. He shed the arrows on to the ground at his feet and said, "The
contest is at an end. I will now see whether Apollo will vouchsafe me to
hit another mark which no man has yet aimed at."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:8">8</span></span> He took aim at
Antinous as he spoke. The arrow struck him in the throat, so that he
fell over and a thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He
kicked his table from him and upset the things on it, whereby the bread
and meats were

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

all soiled as they fell over on to the ground. The suitors were
instantly in an uproar, and looked towards the walls for armour, but
there was none. "Stranger," they cried, "you shall pay dearly for
shooting people down in this way. You are a doomed man." But they did
not yet understand that Ulysses had killed Antinous on purpose.

Ulysses glared at them and said, "Dogs, did you think that <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:34">34</span></span> I should not
return from Troy? You have wasted my substance, you have violated the
women of my house, you have wooed my wife while I was still alive, you
have feared neither god nor man, and now you shall die."

Eurymachus alone answered. "If you are Ulysses," said <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:44">44</span></span> he, "we have done
you great wrong. It was all Antinous's doing. He never really wanted to
marry Penelope: he wanted to kill your son and to be chief man in
Ithaca. He is no more; then spare the lives of your people and we will
pay you all."

Ulysses again glared at him and said, "I will not stay my <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:60">60</span></span> hand till I have
slain one and all of you. You must fight, or fly as you can, or die—and
fly you neither can nor shall."

Eurymachus then said, "My friends, this man will give us <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:68">68</span></span> no quarter. Let us
show fight. Draw your swords and hold the tables up in front of you as
shields. Have at him with a rush, and drive him from the pavement and
from the door. We could then get through into the town and call for
help."

While he spoke and was springing forward, Ulysses sent an <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:79">79</span></span> arrow into his
heart and he fell doubled up over his table. The cup and all the meats
went over on to the ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in
the agonies of death.

Amphinomus then made for Ulysses to try and dislodge <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:89">89</span></span> him from the door,
but Telemachus got behind him, and struck him through. He left his spear
in the body and flew back to his father's side; "Father," said he, "let
me bring armour for you and me, as well as for Eumæus and Philœtius."
"Run and fetch it," answered Ulysses, "while my arrows hold out; be
quick, or they may get me away from the door when I am single-handed."

Telemachus went to the store-room and brought four <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:108">108</span></span> shields, eight
spears, and four helmets. He armed himself, as

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

did also Eumæus and Philœtius, who then placed themselves beside
Ulysses. As long as his arrows held out Ulysses shot the suitors down
thick and threefold, but when they failed him he stood the bow against
the end wall of the house hard by the door way, and armed himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:126">126</span></span> Now there
was a trap-door (see plan, and *f* on ) on the wall, while at one end of
the pavement there was an exit, closed by a good strong door and leading
out into a narrow passage; Ulysses told Philœtius to stand by this door
and keep it, for only one person could attack it at a time. Then Agelaus
shouted out, "Go up, somebody, to the trap-door and tell the people what
is going on; they would come in and help us."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:135">135</span></span> "This may
not be," answered Melanthius, "the mouth of the narrow passage is
dangerously near the entrance from the street into the outer court. One
brave man could prevent any number from getting in, but I will bring you
arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is there that they have put
them."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:143">143</span></span> As he
spoke he went back by passages to the store-room, and brought the
suitors twelve shields and the same number of helmets; when Ulysses saw
the suitors arming his heart began to fail him, and he said to
Telemachus, "Some of the women inside are helping the suitors—or else it
is Melanthius."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:153">153</span></span> Telemachus
said that it was his fault, for he had left the store-room door open.
"Go, Eumæus," he added, "and close it; see whether it is one of the
women, or Melanthius, son .of Dolius."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:160">160</span></span> Melanthius
was now going back for more armour when Eumæus saw him and told Ulysses,
who said, "Follow him, you and Philœtius; bind his hands and feet behind
him, and throw him into the store-room; then string him up to a
bearing-post till he is close to the rafters, that he may linger on in
agony."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:178">178</span></span> The men
went to the store-room and caught Melanthius. They bound him in a
painful bond and strung him up as Ulysses had told them. Eumæus wished
him a good night and the two men returned to the side of Ulysses.
Minerva <span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:205">205</span></span>
also joined them, having assumed the form of Mentor; but

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ulysses felt sure
it was Minerva. The suitors were very angry when they saw her; "Mentor,"
they cried, "you shall pay for this with your life, and we will
confiscate all you have in the world."

This made Minerva furious, and she rated Ulysses roundly. <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:224">224</span></span> "Your prowess,"
said she, "is no longer what it was at Troy. How comes it that you are
less valiant now that you are on your own ground? Come on, my good
fellow, and see how Mentor will fight for you and requite you for your
many kindnesses." But she did not mean to give him the victory just yet,
so she flew up to one of the rafters and sat there in the form of a
swallow. <span id="fr_44"></span>[\*](#fn_44.md)

The struggle still continued. "My friends," said Agelaus, <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:241">241</span></span> "he will soon
have to leave off. See how Mentor has left him after doing nothing for
him except brag. Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw
your spears first."

They did so, but Minerva made all their spears take no <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:265">265</span></span> effect. Ulysses
and the other three then threw, and each killed his man. The suitors
drew back in fear into a corner, whereon the four sprang forward and
regained their weapons. The suitors again threw, and this time
Amphimedon really did take a piece of the top skin from Telemachus's
wrist, and Ctesippus just grazed Eumæus's shoulder above his shield. It
was now the turn of Ulysses and his men, and each of their spears killed
a man.

Then Minerva from high on the roof held up her deadly <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:297">297</span></span> ægis, and struck
the suitors with panic, whereon Ulysses and his men fell upon them and
smote them on every side. They made a horrible groaning as their brains
were being battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood. Leiodes
implored Ulysses to spare his life, but Ulysses would give him no
quarter.

The minstrel Phemius now begged for mercy. He was <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:330">330</span></span>

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

standing near towards the trap-door, and resolving to embrace Ulysses’
knees, he laid his lyre on the ground between the mixing-bowl and the
high silver-studded seat. "Spare me," he cried, "you will be sorry for
it afterwards if you kill such a bard as I am. I am an original
composer, and heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration. Do not be
in such a hurry to cut my head off. Telemachus will tell you that I only
sang to the suitors because they forced me."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:354">354</span></span> "Hold,"
cried Telemachus to his father, "do him no hurt, he is guiltless; and we
will spare Medon, too, who was always good to me when I was a boy,
unless Eumæus or Philœtius has already killed him, or you happened to
fall in with him yourself."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:361">361</span></span> "Here I
am, my dear Sir," said Medon, coming out from under a freshly flayed
heifer's hide <span id="fr_45"></span>[\*](#fn_45.md) which had concealed
him; "tell your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the
suitors for having wasted his substance and been so disrespectful to
yourself." Ulysses smiled, and told them to go outside into the outer
court till the killing should be over. So they went, but they were still
very much frightened. Ulysses then went all over the court to see if
there were any who had concealed themselves, or were not yet killed, but
there was no one; they were all as dead as fish lying in a hot sun upon
the beach.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:390">390</span></span> Then he
told Telemachus to call Euryclea, who came at once, and found him all
covered with blood. When she saw the corpses she was beginning to raise
a shout of triumph, but <span class="margnote"><span
id="an_22:411">411</span></span> Ulysses checked her: "Old woman," said
he, "rejoice in silence; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men.
And now tell me which of the women of the house are innocent and which
guilty."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:419">419</span></span> "There are
fifty women in the house," said Euryclea; "twelve of these have
misbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me and to Penelope. They
showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only lately grown up, and
his mother

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

never permitted him to give orders to the female servants. And now let
me go upstairs and tell your wife."

"Do not wake her yet," answered Ulysses, "but send the <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:430">430</span></span> guilty women to
me."

Then he called Telemachus, Eumæus, and Philœtius. <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:435">435</span></span> "Begin," he
said, "to remove the dead bodies, and make the women help you. Also get
sponges and clean water to swill down the tables and the seats. When you
have thoroughly cleansed the cloisters take the women outside and run
them through with your swords."

The women came down weeping and wailing bitterly. <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:446">446</span></span> First they
carried the dead bodies out, and propped them against one another in the
gatehouse of the outer court. Ulysses ordered them about and saw that
they lost no time. When they had carried the bodies out they cleaned all
the tables and seats with sponges and water, while Telemachus and the
two others shovelled up the blood and dirt from the ground and the women
carried it all outside. When they had thus thoroughly cleaned the whole
court, they took the women out and hemmed them up in the narrow space
between the vaulted room and the wall of the outer yard. Here Telemachus
determined to hang them, as a more dishonourable death than <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:462">462</span></span> stabbing. He
therefore made a ship's rope fast to a strong bearing-post supporting
the roof of the vaulted room, and threw it round, making the women put
their heads in. the nooses one after another. He then drew the rope high
up, so that none of their feet might touch the ground. They kicked
convulsively for a while, but not for very long.

As for Melanthius they took him through the cloisters into <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:474">474</span></span> the outer court.
There they cut off his nose and ears; they drew out his vitals and gave
them to the dogs, raw; then they cut off his hands and feet. When they
had done this they washed their hands and feet, and went back into the
house. "Go," said Ulysses, to Euryclea, "and bring me sulphur that I may
burn it and purify the cloisters. Go, moreover, and bid Penelope come
here with her gentlewomen and the women of the house."

"Let me first bring you a clean shirt and cloak," said <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_22:485">485</span></span>

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Euryclea, "do not
keep those rags on any longer, it is not right."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:490">490</span></span> "Light me
a fire," answered Ulysses, and she obeyed and brought him sulphur,
wherewith he thoroughly purified both the inner and outer court, as well
as the cloisters. Then Euryclea brought the women from their apartment,
and they pressed round Ulysses, kissing his head and shoulders, and
taking hold of his hands. It made him feel as if he should like to weep,
for he remembered every one of them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_43"></span>[90:\*](aoto27.htm#fr_43.md) It is not expressly
stated that the "stone pavement" is here intended. The Greek has simply
ἆλτο δ᾽ ἐπὶ μέγαν οὐδόν, but I do not doubt that the stone pavement is
intended.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[93:\*](aoto27.htm#fr_44.md) This again suggests,
though it does not prove, that we are in an open court surrounded by a
cloister, on the rafters of which swallows would often perch. Line 297
suggests this even more strongly, "the roof" being, no doubt, the roof
of the cloister, on to which Minerva flew from the rafter, that her ægis
might better command the whole court.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[94:\*](aoto27.htm#fr_45.md) Probably the hide of
the heifer that Philœtius had brought in that morning (xx. 186).
