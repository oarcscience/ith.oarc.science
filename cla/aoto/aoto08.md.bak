#### Book III

#### TELEMACHUS AT THE HOUSE OF NESTOR.

They reached Pylos on the following morning, and found Nestor, his sons,
and all the Pylians celebrating the feast of Neptune. They were
cordially received, especially by Nestor's son Pisistratus, and were at
once invited to join the festivities. After dinner Nestor asked them who
they were, and Telemachus, emboldened by Minerva, explained that they
came from Ithaca under Neritum, <span id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12.md) and
that he was seeking news of the death of his father Ulysses.

When he heard this, Nestor told him all about his own <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_3:102">102</span></span> adventures on his
way home from Troy, but could give him no news of Ulysses. He touched,
however, on the murder of Agamemnon by Ægisthus, and the revenge taken
by Orestes. <span id="fr_13"></span>[†](#fn_13.md)

Telemachus said he wished he might be able to take a like <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_3:201">201</span></span> revenge on the
suitors of his mother, who were ruining him; "but this," he exclaimed,
"could not happen, not even if the gods wished it. It is too much even
to think of."

Minerva reproved him sharply. "The hand of heaven," <span
class="margnote"><span id="an_3:229">229</span></span> she said, "can
reach far when it has a mind to save a man." Telemachus then changed the
conversation, and asked Nestor how Ægisthus managed to kill Agamemnon,
who was so much the better man of the two. What was Menelaus doing?

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3:253">253</span></span> "Menelaus,"
answered Nestor, "had not yet returned from <span class="margnote"><span
id="an_3:266">266</span></span> his long wanderings. As for
Clytemnestra, she was naturally of a good disposition, but was beguiled
by Ægisthus, who reigned seven years in Mycene after he had killed
Agamemnon. In the eighth year, however, Orestes came from Athens and
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3:311">311</span></span> killed him,
and on the very day when Orestes was celebrating the funeral feast of
Ægisthus and Clytemnestra, Menelaus returned. Go then to Sparta, and see
if he can tell you anything."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3:329">329</span></span> By this
time the sun had set, and Minerva proposed that she and Telemachus
should return to their ship, but Nestor would not hear of their doing
so. Minerva therefore consented that Telemachus should stay on shore,
and explained that she could not remain with him inasmuch as she must
start on the following morning for the Cauconians, to recover a large
debt that had been long owing to her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3:371">371</span></span> Having said
this, to the astonishment of all present she flew away in the form of an
eagle. Whereon Nestor grasped Telemachus's hand and said he could see
that he must be a very important person. He also at once vowed to gild
the horns of a heifer and sacrifice her to the goddess. He then took
Telemachus home with him and lodged him in his own house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3:404">404</span></span> Next day
Nestor fulfilled his vow; the heifer was brought in from the plains, her
horns were gilded, and Nestor's wife Eurydice and her daughters shouted
with delight at seeing her killed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3:477">477</span></span> After the
banquet that ensued Nestor sent Telemachus and his son Pisistratus off
in a chariot and pair for Lacedæmon, which they reached on the following
morning, after passing a night in the house of Diodes at Pheræ.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_12"></span>[23:\*](aoto08.htm#fr_12.md) Reading ὑπονηρίρτου
for ὑπονηίου, *cf*. i. 186 and also xiii. 351.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[23:†](aoto08.htm#fr_13.md) The reader will note
that the fact of Orestes having also killed his mother is not expressly
stated here, nor in any of the three other passages in which the revenge
taken by Orestes is referred to—doubtless as being too horrible. The
other passages are "Od." i, 40 and 299 (not given in this summary), and
xi. 408, &c.
