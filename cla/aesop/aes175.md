# The Camel

WHEN MAN first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast size that
he ran away. After a time, perceiving the meekness and gentleness of the
beast's temper, he summoned courage enough to approach him. Soon
afterwards, observing that he was an animal altogether deficient in
spirit, he assumed such boldness as to put a bridle in his mouth, and to
let a child drive him.

Use serves to overcome dread.
