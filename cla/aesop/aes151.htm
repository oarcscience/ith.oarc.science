<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Bull and the Goat</H1>
<P>A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some shepherds had recently occupied. As soon as he entered, a He-Goat left in the cave sharply attacked him with his horns. The Bull quietly addressed him: "Butt away as much as you will. I have no fear of you, but of the Lion. Let that monster go away and I will soon let you know what is the respective strength of a Goat and a Bull."</P>
<P>It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in distress.</P>
