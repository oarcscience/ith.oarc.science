# The Cat and the Birds

A CAT, hearing that the Birds in a certain aviary were ailing dressed
himself up as a physician, and, taking his cane and a bag of instruments
becoming his profession, went to call on them. He knocked at the door
and inquired of the inmates how they all did, saying that if they were
ill, he would be happy to prescribe for them and cure them. They
replied, "We are all very well, and shall continue so, if you will only
be good enough to go away, and leave us as we are."
