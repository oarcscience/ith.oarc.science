# The Viper and the File

A LION, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools the
means of satisfying his hunger. He more particularly addressed himself
to a File, and asked of him the favor of a meal. The File replied, "You
must indeed be a simple-minded fellow if you expect to get anything from
me, who am accustomed to take from everyone, and never to give anything
in return."
