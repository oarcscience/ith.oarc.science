# The Walnut-Tree

A WALNUT TREE standing by the roadside bore an abundant crop of fruit.
For the sake of the nuts, the passers-by broke its branches with stones
and sticks. The Walnut-Tree piteously exclaimed, "O wretched me! that
those whom I cheer with my fruit should repay me with these painful
requitals!"
