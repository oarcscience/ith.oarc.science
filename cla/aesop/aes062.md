# The Boy and the Nettles

A BOY was stung by a Nettle. He ran home and told his Mother, saying,
"Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently." "That was
just why it stung you," said his Mother. "The next time you touch a
Nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk to your hand, and
not in the least hurt you."

Whatever you do, do with all your might.
