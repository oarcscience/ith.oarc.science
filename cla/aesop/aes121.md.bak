# The Old Hound

A HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never yielded to
any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a boar in the chase.
He seized him boldly by the ear, but could not retain his hold because
of the decay of his teeth, so that the boar escaped. His master, quickly
coming up, was very much disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog. The
Hound looked up and said, "It was not my fault. master: my spirit was as
good as ever, but I could not help my infirmities. I rather deserve to
be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I am."
