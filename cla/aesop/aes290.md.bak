# The Partridge and the Fowler

A FOWLER caught a Partridge and was about to kill it. The Partridge
earnestly begged him to spare his life, saying, "Pray, master, permit me
to live and I will entice many Partridges to you in recompense for your
mercy to me." The Fowler replied, "I shall now with less scruple take
your life, because you are willing to save it at the cost of betraying
your friends and relations."
