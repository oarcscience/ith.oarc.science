# The Jackdaw and the Doves

A JACKDAW, seeing some Doves in a cote abundantly provided with food,
painted himself white and joined them in order to share their plentiful
maintenance. The Doves, as long as he was silent, supposed him to be one
of themselves and admitted him to their cote. But when one day he forgot
himself and began to chatter, they discovered his true character and
drove him forth, pecking him with their beaks. Failing to obtain food
among the Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws. They too, not recognizing
him on account of his color. expelled him from living with them. So
desiring two ends, he obtained neither.
