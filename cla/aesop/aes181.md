# The Fox and the Hedgehog

A FOX swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of the
current into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long time very much
bruised, sick, and unable to move. A swarm of hungry blood-sucking flies
settled upon him. A Hedgehog, passing by, saw his anguish and inquired
if he should drive away the flies that were tormenting him. "By no
means," replied the Fox; "pray do not molest them." "How is this?' said
the Hedgehog; "do you not want to be rid of them?' "No," returned the
Fox, "for these flies which you see are full of blood, and sting me but
little, and if you rid me of these which are already satiated, others
more hungry will come in their place, and will drink up all the blood I
have left."
