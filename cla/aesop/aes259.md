# The Jackdaw and the Fox

A HALF-FAMISHED JACKDAW seated himself on a fig-tree, which had produced
some fruit entirely out of season, and waited in the hope that the figs
would ripen. A Fox seeing him sitting so long and learning the reason of
his doing so, said to him, "You are indeed, sir, sadly deceiving
yourself; you are indulging a hope strong enough to cheat you, but which
will never reward you with enjoyment."
