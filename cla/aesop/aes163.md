# The Oak and the Woodcutters

THE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in pieces, making
wedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk. The Oak said with a
sigh, "I do not care about the blows of the axe aimed at my roots, but I
do grieve at being torn in pieces by these wedges made from my own
branches."

Misfortunes springing from ourselves are the hardest to bear.
