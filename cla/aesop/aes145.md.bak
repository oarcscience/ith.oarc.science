# The Seagull and the Kite

A SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag
and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and exclaimed: "You
richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no business to seek
its food from the sea."

Every man should be content to mind his own business.
