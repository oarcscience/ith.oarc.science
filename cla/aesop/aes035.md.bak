# The Oxen and the Axle-Trees

A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen.
The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the Oxen, turning
round, thus addressed the wheels: "Hullo there! why do you make so much
noise? We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out."

Those who suffer most cry out the least.
