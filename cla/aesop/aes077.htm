<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Kid and the Wolf</H1>
<P>A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm's way, saw a Wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. The Wolf, looking up, said, "Sirrah! I hear thee: yet it is not thou who mockest me, but the roof on which thou art standing."</P>
<P>Time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the strong.</P>
