# The Kid and the Wolf

A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm's way, saw a Wolf
passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. The Wolf,
looking up, said, "Sirrah! I hear thee: yet it is not thou who mockest
me, but the roof on which thou art standing."

Time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the strong.
