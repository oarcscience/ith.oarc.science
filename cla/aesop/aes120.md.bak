# The Old Lion

A LION, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on the
ground at the point of death. A Boar rushed upon him, and avenged with a
stroke of his tusks a long-remembered injury. Shortly afterwards the
Bull with his horns gored him as if he were an enemy. When the Ass saw
that the huge beast could be assailed with impunity, he let drive at his
forehead with his heels. The expiring Lion said, "I have reluctantly
brooked the insults of the brave, but to be compelled to endure such
treatment from thee, a disgrace to Nature, is indeed to die a double
death."
