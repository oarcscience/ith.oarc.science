# The Laborer and the Snake

A SNAKE, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage, inflicted
a mortal bite on the Cottager's infant son. Grieving over his loss, the
Father resolved to kill the Snake. The next day, when it came out of its
hole for food, he took up his axe, but by swinging too hastily, missed
its head and cut off only the end of its tail. After some time the
Cottager, afraid that the Snake would bite him also, endeavored to make
peace, and placed some bread and salt in the hole. The Snake, slightly
hissing, said: "There can henceforth be no peace between us; for
whenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever
you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son."

No one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused the
injury.
