# The Lamp

A LAMP, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted that it
gave more light than the sun. Then a sudden puff of wind arose, and the
Lamp was immediately extinguished. Its owner lit it again, and said:
"Boast no more, but henceforth be content to give thy light in silence.
Know that not even the stars need to be relit"
