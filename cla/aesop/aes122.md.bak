# The Bee and Jupiter

A BEE from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to Olympus to
present Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs. Jupiter, delighted with
the offering of honey, promised to give whatever she should ask. She
therefore besought him, saying, "Give me, I pray thee, a sting, that if
any mortal shall approach to take my honey, I may kill him." Jupiter was
much displeased, for he loved the race of man, but could not refuse the
request because of his promise. He thus answered the Bee: "You shall
have your request, but it will be at the peril of your own life. For if
you use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you make, and then you
will die from the loss of it."

Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost.
