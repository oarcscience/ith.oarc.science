# The Shepherd and the Wolf

A SHEPHERD once found the whelp of a Wolf and brought it up, and after a
while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring flocks. The Wolf,
having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the Shepherd, "Since you have
taught me to steal, you must keep a sharp lookout, or you will lose some
of your own flock."
