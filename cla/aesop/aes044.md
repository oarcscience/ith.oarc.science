# The Boasting Traveler

A MAN who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much, on returning
to his own country, of the many wonderful and heroic feats he had
performed in the different places he had visited. Among other things, he
said that when he was at Rhodes he had leaped to such a distance that no
man of his day could leap anywhere near him as to that, there were in
Rhodes many persons who saw him do it and whom he could call as
witnesses. One of the bystanders interrupted him, saying: "Now, my good
man, if this be all true there is no need of witnesses. Suppose this to
be Rhodes, and leap for us."
