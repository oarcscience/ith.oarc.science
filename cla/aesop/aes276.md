# The Hen and the Swallow

A HEN finding the eggs of a viper and carefully keeping them warm,
nourished them into life. A Swallow, observing what she had done, said,
"You silly creature! why have you hatched these vipers which, when they
shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?'
