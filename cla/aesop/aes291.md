# The Flea and the Man

A MAN, very much annoyed with a Flea, caught him at last, and said, "Who
are you who dare to feed on my limbs, and to cost me so much trouble in
catching you?' The Flea replied, "O my dear sir, pray spare my life, and
destroy me not, for I cannot possibly do you much harm." The Man,
laughing, replied, "Now you shall certainly die by mine own hands, for
no evil, whether it be small or large, ought to be tolerated."
