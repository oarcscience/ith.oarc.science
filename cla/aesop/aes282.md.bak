# The She-Goats and Their Beards

THE SHE-GOATS having obtained a beard by request to Jupiter, the
He-Goats were sorely displeased and made complaint that the females
equaled them in dignity. "Allow them," said Jupiter, "to enjoy an empty
honor and to assume the badge of your nobler sex, so long as they are
not your equals in strength or courage."

It matters little if those who are inferior to us in merit should be
like us in outside appearances.
