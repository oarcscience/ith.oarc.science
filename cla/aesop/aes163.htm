<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Oak and the Woodcutters</H1>
<P>THE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in pieces, making wedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk. The Oak said with a sigh, "I do not care about the blows of the axe aimed at my roots, but I do grieve at being torn in pieces by these wedges made from my own branches."</P>
<P>Misfortunes springing from ourselves are the hardest to bear.</P>
