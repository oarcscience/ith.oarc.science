# The Rich Man and the Tanner

A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the
unpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away.
The Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying that he would
leave soon. But as he still continued to stay, as time went on, the rich
man became accustomed to the smell, and feeling no manner of
inconvenience, made no further complaints.
