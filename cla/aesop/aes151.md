# The Bull and the Goat

A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some shepherds had
recently occupied. As soon as he entered, a He-Goat left in the cave
sharply attacked him with his horns. The Bull quietly addressed him:
"Butt away as much as you will. I have no fear of you, but of the Lion.
Let that monster go away and I will soon let you know what is the
respective strength of a Goat and a Bull."

It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in distress.
