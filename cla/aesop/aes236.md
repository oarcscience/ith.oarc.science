# The Quack Frog

A FROG once upon a time came forth from his home in the marsh and
proclaimed to all the beasts that he was a learned physician, skilled in
the use of drugs and able to heal all diseases. A Fox asked him, "How
can you pretend to prescribe for others, when you are unable to heal
your own lame gait and wrinkled skin?'
