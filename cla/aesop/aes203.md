# The Lark and Her Young Ones

A LARK had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat.
The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use
of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, when the owner of
the field, looking over his ripe crop, said, "The time has come when I
must ask all my neighbors to help me with my harvest." One of the young
Larks heard his speech and related it to his mother, inquiring of her to
what place they should move for safety. "There is no occasion to move
yet, my son," she replied; "the man who only sends to his friends to
help him with his harvest is not really in earnest." The owner of the
field came again a few days later and saw the wheat shedding the grain
from excess of ripeness. He said, "I will come myself tomorrow with my
laborers, and with as many reapers as I can hire, and will get in the
harvest." The Lark on hearing these words said to her brood, "It is time
now to be off, my little ones, for the man is in earnest this time; he
no longer trusts his friends, but will reap the field himself."

Self-help is the best help.
