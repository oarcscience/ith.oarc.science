# The Fox and the Leopard

THE FOX and the Leopard disputed which was the more beautiful of the
two. The Leopard exhibited one by one the various spots which decorated
his skin. But the Fox, interrupting him, said, "And how much more
beautiful than you am I, who am decorated, not in body, but in mind."
