# The Boy Bathing

A BOY bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned. He called out
to a passing traveler for help, but instead of holding out a helping
hand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scolded the boy for his
imprudence. "Oh, sir!" cried the youth, "pray help me now and scold me
afterwards."

Counsel without help is useless.
