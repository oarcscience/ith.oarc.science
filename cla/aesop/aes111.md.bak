# The Wolf and the Housedog

A WOLF, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar about his
neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet compelled him to
drag that heavy log about wherever he went. "The master," he replied.
Then said the Wolf: "May no friend of mine ever be in such a plight; for
the weight of this chain is enough to spoil the appetite."
