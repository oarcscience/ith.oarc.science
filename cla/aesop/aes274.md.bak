# The Lion and the Fox

A FOX entered into partnership with a Lion on the pretense of becoming
his servant. Each undertook his proper duty in accordance with his own
nature and powers. The Fox discovered and pointed out the prey; the Lion
sprang on it and seized it. The Fox soon became jealous of the Lion
carrying off the Lion's share, and said that he would no longer find out
the prey, but would capture it on his own account. The next day he
attempted to snatch a lamb from the fold, but he himself fell prey to
the huntsmen and hounds.
