# The Traveler and His Dog

A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door
stretching himself. He asked him sharply: "Why do you stand there
gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly." The
Dog, wagging his tail, replied: "O, master! I am quite ready; it is you
for whom I am waiting."

The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.
