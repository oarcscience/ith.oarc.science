# The Fox and the Monkey

A FOX and a Monkey were traveling together on the same road. As they
journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of monuments. "All these
monuments which you see," said the Monkey, "are erected in honor of my
ancestors, who were in their day freedmen and citizens of great renown."
The Fox replied, "You have chosen a most appropriate subject for your
falsehoods, as I am sure none of your ancestors will be able to
contradict you."

A false tale often betrays itself.
