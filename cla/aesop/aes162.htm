<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter</H1>
<P>A BULL finding a lion's cub asleep gored him to death with his horns. The Lioness came up, and bitterly lamented the death of her whelp. A wild-boar Hunter, seeing her distress, stood at a distance and said to her, "Think how many men there are who have reason to lament the loss of their children, whose deaths have been caused by you."</P>
