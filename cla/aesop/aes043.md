# The Lioness

A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the
animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of
whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the
Lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute. "And you,"
they said, "how many sons have you at a birth?' The Lioness laughed at
them, and said: "Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a
thoroughbred Lion."

The value is in the worth, not in the number.
