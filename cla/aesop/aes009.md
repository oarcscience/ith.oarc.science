# The Cock and the Jewel

A COCK, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a precious
stone and exclaimed: "If your owner had found thee, and not I, he would
have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have
found thee for no purpose. I would rather have one barleycorn than all
the jewels in the world."
