# The Hare and the Hound

A HOUND started a Hare from his lair, but after a long run, gave up the
chase. A goat-herd seeing him stop, mocked him, saying "The little one
is the best runner of the two." The Hound replied, "You do not see the
difference between us: I was only running for a dinner, but he for his
life."
