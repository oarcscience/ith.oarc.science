### Chapter Four

### THE PASSER-BY

SHE came slowly with her head on one side, over the deserted jetty where
the moonlight fell. A little flickering shadow frisked before her steps.

Demetrios watched her advance.

Diagonal folds furrowed the little that could be seen of her body
through the light tissue; one of her elbows thrust out under the close
tunic and the other arm, which she had left bare, carried the long train
so it would not drag in the dust.

He recognized by her jewels that she was a courtesan; to spare himself a
salute from her he crossed over quickly.

He did not wish to look at her. Wilfully he occupied his thought with
the great sketch of Zagreus. And yet his eyes returned toward her who
passed.

Then he saw that she did not stop at all, that she did not concern
herself with him, that she did not even pretend to look at the sea nor
to raise her veil before her face nor to be absorbed in her reflections;
but that she was simply walking alone and sought nothing there but the
coolness of the wind, solitude, freedom, the light quiver of the
silence.

Without stirring, Demetrios did not turn his gaze from her and lost
himself in a singular astonishment.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

She continued walking like a yellow shade in the distance, indifferent
and preceded by the little black shadow.

He heard at each step the gentle sound of her foot-wear in the dust of
the way.

She walked to the isle of the Pharos and mounted among the rocks.

Suddenly, and as though long ago he had loved this unknown, Demetrios
ran after her, then stopped, retraced his steps, trembled, grew angry at
himself, attempted to leave the jetty; but he had never employed his
will except to serve his own pleasure and when it was time to make it
act for the welfare of his character and the ordering of his life he
felt himself filled with impotence and nailed to the spot where he
stood.

As he could no longer avoid thinking of her he tried to find an excuse
for the preoccupation which distracted him so violently. He imagined his
admiration for her gracious passing was purely an esthetic sentiment.
And he said to himself that she would be an ideal model for the Charity
with the fan which he proposed to sketch on the morrow. Then suddenly
all his thoughts were upset and a crowd of anxious questions flowed into
his spirit around this woman in yellow.

What was she doing on the island at this hour of the night? Why, for
whom, had she come our so late? Why had she not accosted him? She had
seen him, certainly she had seen him as he crossed the jetty. Why,
without a word of greeting, had she continued on her way? The rumor ran
that certain women sometimes chose the cool hours before the dawn to
bathe in the sea. But no one bathed at the Pharos. The sea was too deep
there. Besides, how unlikely that a woman would thus have covered
herself with

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

jewels to go only to the bath. . . . Then, what drew her so far from
Rhacotis? A rendezvous, perhaps? With some young man—to be courted, on
the great wave-polished rocks?

Demetrios wished to assure himself. But already the young woman was
returning, with the same soft and tranquil step, lighted full in the
face by the slow lunar brightness and sweeping the dust of the parapet
with the tip of her fan.
