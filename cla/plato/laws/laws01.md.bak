# BOOK II

Athenian Stranger. And now we have to consider whether the insight into
human nature is the only benefit derived from well ordered potations, or
whether there are not other advantages great and much to be desired. The
argument seems to imply that there are. But how and in what way these
are to be attained, will have to be considered attentively, or we may be
entangled in error.

Cleinias. Proceed.

Ath. Let me once more recall our doctrine of right education; which, if
I am not mistaken, depends on the due regulation of convivial
intercourse.

Cle. You talk rather grandly.

Ath. Pleasure and pain I maintain to be the first perceptions of
children, and I say that they are the forms under which virtue and vice
are originally present to them. As to wisdom and true and fixed
opinions, happy is the man who acquires them, even when declining in
years; and we may say that he who possesses them, and the blessings
which are contained in them, is a perfect man. Now I mean by education
that training which is given by suitable habits to the first instincts
of virtue in children;-when pleasure, and friendship, and pain, and
hatred, are rightly implanted in souls not yet capable of understanding
the nature of them, and who find them, after they have attained reason,
to be in harmony with her. This harmony of the soul, taken as a whole,
is virtue; but the particular training in respect of pleasure and pain,
which leads you always to hate what you ought to hate, and love what you
ought to love from the beginning of life to the end, may be separated
off; and, in my view, will be rightly called education.

Cle. I think, Stranger, that you are quite right in all that you have
said and are saying about education.

Ath. I am glad to hear that you agree with me; for, indeed, the
discipline of pleasure and pain which, when rightly ordered, is a
principle of education, has been often relaxed and corrupted in human
life. And the Gods, pitying the toils which our race is born to undergo,
have appointed holy festivals, wherein men alternate rest with labour;
and have given them the Muses and Apollo, the leader of the Muses, and
Dionysus, to be companions in their revels, that they may improve their
education by taking part in the festivals of the Gods, and with their
help. I should like to know whether a common saying is in our opinion
true to nature or not. For men say that the young of all creatures
cannot be quiet in their bodies or in their voices; they are always
wanting to move and cry out; some leaping and skipping, and overflowing
with sportiveness and delight at something, others uttering all sorts of
cries. But, whereas the animals have no perception of order or disorder
in their movements, that is, of rhythm or harmony, as they are called,
to us, the Gods, who, as we say, have been appointed to be our
companions in the dance, have given the pleasurable sense of harmony and
rhythm; and so they stir us into life, and we follow them, joining hands
together in dances and songs; and these they call choruses, which is a
term naturally expressive of cheerfulness. Shall we begin, then, with
the acknowledgment that education is first given through Apollo and the
Muses? What do you say?

Cle. I assent.

Ath. And the uneducated is he who has not been trained in the chorus,
and the educated is he who has been well trained?

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. And the chorus is made up of two parts, dance and song?

Cle. True.

Ath. Then he who is well educated will be able to sing and dance well?

Cle. I suppose that he will.

Ath. Let us see; what are we saying?

Cle. What?

Ath. He sings well and dances well; now must we add that he sings what
is good and dances what is good?

Cle. Let us make the addition.

Ath. We will suppose that he knows the good to be good, and the bad to
be bad, and makes use of them accordingly: which now is the better
trained in dancing and music-he who is able to move his body and to use
his voice in what is understood to be the right manner, but has no
delight in good or hatred of evil; or he who is incorrect in gesture and
voice, but is right in his sense of pleasure and pain, and welcomes what
is good, and is offended at what is evil?

Cle. There is a great difference, Stranger, in the two kinds of
education.

Ath. If we three know what is good in song and dance, then we truly know
also who is educated and who is uneducated; but if not, then we
certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard of education, and
whether there is any or not.

Cle. True.

Ath. Let us follow the scent like hounds, and go in pursuit of beauty of
figure, and melody, and song, and dance; if these escape us, there will
be no use in talking about true education, whether Hellenic or
barbarian.

Cle. Yes.

Ath. And what is beauty of figure, or beautiful melody? When a manly
soul is in trouble, and when a cowardly soul is in similar case, are
they likely to use the same figures and gestures, or to give utterance
to the same sounds?

Cle. How can they, when the very colours of their faces differ?

Ath. Good, my friend; I may observe, however, in passing, that in music
there certainly are figures and there are melodies: and music is
concerned with harmony and rhythm, so that you may speak of a melody or
figure having good rhythm or good harmony-the term is correct enough;
but to speak metaphorically of a melody or figure having a "good
colour," as the masters of choruses do, is not allowable, although you
can speak of the melodies or figures of the brave and the coward,
praising the one and censuring the other. And not to be tedious, let us
say that the figures and melodies which are expressive of virtue of soul
or body, or of images of virtue, are without exception good, and those
which are expressive of vice are the reverse of good.

Cle. Your suggestion is excellent; and let us answer that these things
are so.

Ath. Once more, are all of us equally delighted with every sort of
dance?

Cle. Far otherwise.

Ath. What, then, leads us astray? Are beautiful things not the same to
us all, or are they the same in themselves, but not in our opinion of
them? For no one will admit that forms of vice in the dance are more
beautiful than forms of virtue, or that he himself delights in the forms
of vice, and others in a muse of another character. And yet most persons
say, that the excellence of music is to give pleasure to our souls. But
this is intolerable and blasphemous; there is, however, a much more
plausible account of the delusion.

Cle. What?

Ath. The adaptation of art to the characters of men. Choric movements
are imitations of manners occurring in various actions, fortunes,
dispositions-each particular is imitated, and those to whom the words,
or songs, or dances are suited, either by nature or habit or both,
cannot help feeling pleasure in them and applauding them, and calling
them beautiful. But those whose natures, or ways, or habits are unsuited
to them, cannot delight in them or applaud them, and they call them
base. There are others, again, whose natures are right and their habits
wrong, or whose habits are right and their natures wrong, and they
praise one thing, but are pleased at another. For they say that all
these imitations are pleasant, but not good. And in the presence of
those whom they think wise, they are ashamed of dancing and singing in
the baser manner, or of deliberately lending any countenance to such
proceedings; and yet, they have a secret pleasure in them.

Cle. Very true.

Ath. And is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances or songs, or
any good done to the approver of the opposite sort of pleasure?

Cle. I think that there is.

Ath. "I think" is not the word, but I would say, rather, "I am certain."
For must they not have the same effect as when a man associates with bad
characters, whom he likes and approves rather than dislikes, and only
censures playfully because he has a suspicion of his own badness? In
that case, he who takes pleasure in them will surely become like those
in whom he takes pleasure, even though he be ashamed to praise them. And
what greater good or evil can any destiny ever make us undergo?

Cle. I know of none.

Ath. Then in a city which has good laws, or in future ages is to have
them, bearing in mind the instruction and amusement which are given by
music, can we suppose that the poets are to be allowed to teach in the
dance anything which they themselves like, in the way of rhythm, or
melody, or words, to the young children of any well-conditioned parents?
Is the poet to train his choruses as he pleases, without reference to
virtue or vice?

Cle. That is surely quite unreasonable, and is not to be thought of.

Ath. And yet he may do this in almost any state with the exception of
Egypt.

Cle. And what are the laws about music and dancing in Egypt?

Ath. You will wonder when I tell you: Long ago they appear to have
recognized the very principle of which we are now speaking-that their
young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains of virtue. These
they fixed, and exhibited the patterns of them in their temples; and no
painter or artist is allowed to innovate upon them, or to leave the
traditional forms and invent new ones. To this day, no alteration is
allowed either in these arts, or in music at all. And you will find that
their works of art are painted or moulded in the same forms which they
had ten thousand years ago;-this is literally true and no
exaggeration-their ancient paintings and sculptures are not a whit
better or worse than the work of to-day, but are made with just the same
skill.

Cle. How extraordinary!

Ath. I should rather say, How statesmanlike, how worthy of a legislator!
I know that other things in Egypt are nat so well. But what I am telling
you about music is true and deserving of consideration, because showing
that a lawgiver may institute melodies which have a natural truth and
correctness without any fear of failure. To do this, however, must be
the work of God, or of a divine person; in Egypt they have a tradition
that their ancient chants which have been preserved for so many ages are
the composition of the Goddess Isis. And therefore, as I was saying, if
a person can only find in any way the natural melodies, he may
confidently embody them in a fixed and legal form. For the love of
novelty which arises out of pleasure in the new and weariness of the
old, has not strength enough to corrupt the consecrated song and dance,
under the plea that they have become antiquated. At any rate, they are
far from being corrupted in Egypt.

Cle. Your arguments seem to prove your point.

Ath. May we not confidently say that the true use of music and of choral
festivities is as follows: We rejoice when we think that we prosper, and
again we think that we prosper when we rejoice?

Cle. Exactly.

Ath. And when rejoicing in our good fortune, we are unable to be still?

Cle. True.

Ath. Our young men break forth into dancing and singing, and we who are
their elders deem that we are fulfilling our part in life when we look
on at them. Having lost our agility, we delight in their sports and
merry-making, because we love to think of our former selves; and gladly
institute contests for those who are able to awaken in us the memory of
our youth.

Cle. Very true.

Ath. Is it altogether unmeaning to say, as the common people do about
festivals, that he should be adjudged the wisest of men, and the winner
of the palm, who gives us the greatest amount of pleasure and mirth? For
on such occasions, and when mirth is the order of the day, ought not he
to be honoured most, and, as I was saying, bear the palm, who gives most
mirth to the greatest number? Now is this a true way of speaking or of
acting?

Cle. Possibly.

Ath. But, my dear friend, let us distinguish between different cases,
and not be hasty in forming a judgment: One way of considering the
question will be to imagine a festival at which there are entertainments
of all sorts, including gymnastic, musical, and equestrian contests: the
citizens are assembled; prizes are offered, and proclamation is made
that any one who likes may enter the lists, and that he is to bear the
palm who gives the most pleasure to the spectators-there is to be no
regulation about the manner how; but he who is most successful in giving
pleasure is to be crowned victor, and deemed to be the pleasantest of
the candidates: What is likely to be the result of such a proclamation?

Cle. In what respect?

Ath. There would be various exhibitions: one man, like Homer, will
exhibit a rhapsody, another a performance on the lute; one will have a
tragedy, and another a comedy. Nor would there be anything astonishing
in some one imagining that he could gain the prize by exhibiting a
puppet-show. Suppose these competitors to meet, and not these only, but
innumerable others as well can you tell me who ought to be the victor?

Cle. I do not see how any one can answer you, or pretend to know, unless
he has heard with his own ears the several competitors; the question is
absurd.

Ath. Well, then, if neither of you can answer, shall I answer this
question which you deem so absurd?

Cle. By all means.

Ath. If very small children are to determine the question, they will
decide for the puppet show.

Cle. Of course.

Ath. The older children will be advocates of comedy; educated women, and
young men, and people in general, will favour tragedy.

Cle. Very likely.

Ath. And I believe that we old men would have the greatest pleasure in
hearing a rhapsodist recite well the Iliad and Odyssey, or one of the
Hesiodic poems, and would award the victory to him. But, who would
really be the victor?-that is the question.

Cle. Yes.

Ath. Clearly you and I will have to declare that those whom we old men
adjudge victors ought to win; for our ways are far and away better than
any which at present exist anywhere in the world.

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. Thus far I too should agree with the many, that the excellence of
music is to be measured by pleasure. But the pleasure must not be that
of chance persons; the fairest music is that which delights the best and
best educated, and especially that which delights the one man who is
pre-eminent in virtue and education. And therefore the judges must be
men of character, for they will require both wisdom and courage; the
true judge must not draw his inspiration from the theatre, nor ought he
to be unnerved by the clamour of the many and his own incapacity; nor
again, knowing the truth, ought he through cowardice and unmanliness
carelessly to deliver a lying judgment, with the very same lips which
have just appealed to the Gods before he judged. He is sitting not as
the disciple of the theatre, but, in his proper place, as their
instructor, and he ought to be the enemy of all pandering to the
pleasure of the spectators. The ancient and common custom of Hellas,
which still prevails in Italy and Sicily, did certainly leave the
judgment to the body of spectators, who determined the victor by show of
hands. But this custom has been the destruction of the poets; for they
are now in the habit of composing with a view to please the bad taste of
their judges, and the result is that the spectators instruct
themselves;-and also it has been the ruin of the theatre; they ought to
be having characters put before them better than their own, and so
receiving a higher pleasure, but now by their own act the opposite
result follows. What inference is to be drawn from all this? Shall I
tell you?

Cle. What?

Ath. The inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth time is,
that education is the constraining and directing of youth towards that
right reason, which the law affirms, and which the experience of the
eldest and best has agreed to be truly right. In order, then, that the
soul of the child may not be habituated to feel joy and sorrow in a
manner at variance with the law, and those who obey the law, but may
rather follow the law and rejoice and sorrow at the same things as the
aged-in order, I say, to produce this effect, chants appear to have been
invented, which really enchant, and are designed to implant that harmony
of which we speak. And, because the mind of the child is incapable of
enduring serious training, they are called plays and songs, and are
performed in play; just as when men are sick and ailing in their bodies,
their attendants give them wholesome diet in pleasant meats and drinks,
but unwholesome diet in disagreeable things, in order that they may
learn, as they ought, to like the one, and to dislike the other. And
similarly the true legislator will persuade, and, if he cannot persuade,
will compel the poet to express, as he ought, by fair and noble words,
in his rhythms, the figures, and in his melodies, the music of temperate
and brave and in every way good men.

Cle. But do you really imagine, Stranger, that this is the way in which
poets generally compose in States at the present day? As far as I can
observe, except among us and among the Lacedaemonians, there are no
regulations like those of which you speak; in other places novelties are
always being introduced in dancing and in music, generally not under the
authority of any law, but at the instigation of lawless pleasures; and
these pleasures are so far from being the same, as you describe the
Egyptian to be, or having the same principles, that they are never the
same.

Ath. Most true, Cleinias; and I daresay that I may have expressed myself
obscurely, and so led you to imagine that I was speaking of some really
existing state of things, whereas I was only saying what regulations I
would like to have about music; and hence there occurred a
misapprehension on your part. For when evils are far gone and
irremediable, the task of censuring them is never pleasant, although at
times necessary. But as we do not really differ, will you let me ask you
whether you consider such institutions to be more prevalent among the
Cretans and Lacedaemonians than among the other Hellenes?

Cle. Certainly they are.

Ath. And if they were extended to the other Hellenes, would it be an
improvement on the present state of things?

Cle. A very great improvement, if the customs which prevail among them
were such as prevail among us and the Lacedaemonians, and such as you
were just now saying ought to prevail.

Ath. Let us see whether we understand one another:-Are not the
principles of education and music which prevail among you as follows:
you compel your poets to say that the good man, if he be temperate and
just, is fortunate and happy; and this whether he be great and strong or
small and weak, and whether he be rich or poor; and, on the other hand,
if he have a wealth passing that of Cinyras or Midas, and be unjust, he
is wretched and lives in misery? As the poet says, and with truth: I
sing not, I care not about him who accomplishes all noble things, not
having justice; let him who "draws near and stretches out his hand
against his enemies be a just man." But if he be unjust, I would not
have him "look calmly upon bloody death," nor "surpass in swiftness the
Thracian Boreas"; and let no other thing that is called good ever be
his. For the goods of which the many speak are not really good: first in
the catalogue is placed health, beauty next, wealth third; and then
innumerable others, as for example to have a keen eye or a quick ear,
and in general to have all the senses perfect; or, again, to be a tyrant
and do as you like; and the final consummation of happiness is to have
acquired all these things, and when you have acquired them to become at
once immortal. But you and I say, that while to the just and holy all
these things are the best of possessions, to the unjust they are all,
including even health, the greatest of evils. For in truth, to have
sight, and hearing, and the use of the senses, or to live at all without
justice and virtue, even though a man be rich in all the so-called goods
of fortune, is the greatest of evils, if life be immortal; but not so
great, if the bad man lives only a very short time. These are the truths
which, if I am not mistaken, you will persuade or compel your poets to
utter with suitable accompaniments of harmony and rhythm, and in these
they must train up your youth. Am I not right? For I plainly declare
that evils as they are termed are goods to the unjust, and only evils to
the just, and that goods are truly good to the good, but evil to the
evil. Let me ask again, Are you and I agreed about this?

Cle. I think that we partly agree and partly do not.

Ath. When a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which lasts, and
when he is preeminent in strength and courage, and has the gift of
immortality, and none of the so-called evils which counter-balance these
goods, but only the injustice and insolence of his own nature-of such an
one you are, I suspect, unwilling to believe that he is miserable rather
than happy.

Cle. That is quite true.

Ath. Once more: Suppose that he be valiant and strong, and handsome and
rich, and does throughout his whole life whatever he likes, still, if he
be unrighteous and insolent, would not both of you agree that he will of
necessity live basely? You will surely grant so much?

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. And an evil life too?

Cle. I am not equally disposed to grant that.

Ath. Will he not live painfully and to his own disadvantage?

Cle. How can I possibly say so?

Ath. How! Then may Heaven make us to be of one mind, for now we are of
two. To me, dear Cleinias, the truth of what I am saying is as plain as
the fact that Crete is an island. And, if I were a lawgiver, I would try
to make the poets and all the citizens speak in this strain, and I would
inflict the heaviest penalties on any one in all the land who should
dare to say that there are bad men who lead pleasant lives, or that the
profitable and gainful is one thing, and the just another; and there are
many other matters about which I should make my citizens speak in a
manner different from the Cretans and Lacedaemonians of this age, and I
may say, indeed, from the world in general. For tell me, my good
friends, by Zeus and Apollo tell me, if I were to ask these same Gods
who were your legislators-Is not the most just life also the
pleasantest? or are there two lives, one of which is the justest and the
other the pleasantest?-and they were to reply that there are two; and
thereupon I proceeded to ask, (that would be the right way of pursuing
the enquiry), Which are the happier-those who lead the justest, or those
who lead the pleasantest life? and they replied, Those who lead the
pleasantest-that would be a very strange answer, which I should not like
to put into the mouth of the Gods. The words will come with more
propriety from the lips of fathers and legislators, and therefore I will
repeat my former questions to one of them, and suppose him to say again
that he who leads the pleasantest life is the happiest. And to that I
rejoin:-O my father, did you not wish me to live as happily as possible?
And yet you also never ceased telling me that I should live as justly as
possible. Now, here the giver of the rule, whether he be legislator or
father, will be in a dilemma, and will in vain endeavour to be
consistent with himself. But if he were to declare that the justest life
is also the happiest, every one hearing him would enquire, if I am not
mistaken, what is that good and noble principle in life which the law
approves, and which is superior to pleasure. For what good can the just
man have which is separated from pleasure? Shall we say that glory and
fame, coming from Gods and men, though good and noble, are nevertheless
unpleasant, and infamy pleasant? Certainly not, sweet legislator. Or
shall we say that the not-doing of wrong and there being no wrong done
is good and honourable, although there is no pleasure in it, and that
the doing wrong is pleasant, but evil and base?

Cle. Impossible.

Ath. The view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant and the
just and the good and the noble has an excellent moral and religious
tendency. And the opposite view is most at variance with the designs of
the legislator, and is, in his opinion, infamous; for no one, if he can
help, will be persuaded to do that which gives him more pain than
pleasure. But as distant prospects are apt to make us dizzy, especially
in childhood, the legislator will try to purge away the darkness and
exhibit the truth; he will persuade the citizens, in some way or other,
by customs and praises and words, that just and unjust are shadows only,
and that injustice, which seems opposed to justice, when contemplated by
the unjust and evil man appears pleasant and the just most unpleasant;
but that from the just man's point of view, the very opposite is the
appearance of both of them.

Cle. True.

Ath. And which may be supposed to be the truer judgment-that of the
inferior or of the better soul?

Cle. Surely, that of the better soul.

Ath. Then the unjust life must not only be more base and depraved, but
also more unpleasant than the just and holy life?

Cle. That seems to be implied in the present argument.

Ath. And even supposing this were otherwise, and not as the argument has
proven, still the lawgiver, who is worth anything, if he ever ventures
to tell a lie to the young for their good, could not invent a more
useful lie than this, or one which will have a better effect in making
them do what is right, not on compulsion but voluntarily.

Cle. Truth, Stranger, is a noble thing and a lasting, but a thing of
which men are hard to be persuaded.

Ath. And yet the story of the Sidonian Cadmus, which is so improbable,
has been readily believed, and also innumerable other tales.

Cle. What is that story?

Ath. The story of armed men springing up after the sowing of teeth,
which the legislator may take as a proof that he can persuade the minds
of the young of anything; so that he has only to reflect and find out
what belief will be of the greatest public advantage, and then use all
his efforts to make the whole community utter one and the same word in
their songs and tales and discourses all their life long. But if you do
not agree with me, there is no reason why you should not argue on the
other side.

Cle. I do not see that any argument can fairly be raised by either of us
against what you are now saying.

Ath. The next suggestion which I have to offer is, that all our three
choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls of children, reciting
in their strains all the noble thoughts of which we have already spoken,
or are about to speak; and the sum of them shall be, that the life which
is by the Gods deemed to be the happiest is also the best;-we shall
affirm this to be a most certain truth; and the minds of our young
disciples will be more likely to receive these words of ours than any
others which we might address to them.

Cle. I assent to what you say.

Ath. First will enter in their natural order the sacred choir composed
of children, which is to sing lustily the heaven-taught lay to the whole
city. Next will follow the choir of young men under the age of thirty,
who will call upon the God Paean to testify to the truth of their words,
and will pray him to be gracious to the youth and to turn their hearts.
Thirdly, the choir of elder men, who are from thirty to sixty years of
age, will also sing. There remain those who are too old to sing, and
they will tell stories, illustrating the same virtues, as with the voice
of an oracle.

Cle. Who are those who compose the third choir, Stranger? for I do not
clearly understand what you mean to say about them.

Ath. And yet almost all that I have been saying has said with a view to
them.

Cle. Will you try to be a little plainer?

Ath. I was speaking at the commencement of our discourse, as you will
remember, of the fiery nature of young creatures: I said that they were
unable to keep quiet either in limb or voice, and that they called out
and jumped about in a disorderly manner; and that no other animal
attained to any perception of order, but man only. Now the order of
motion is called rhythm, and the order of the voice, in which high and
low are duly mingled, is called harmony; and both together are termed
choric song. And I said that the Gods had pity on us, and gave us Apollo
and the Muses to be our playfellows and leaders in the dance; and
Dionysus, as I dare say that you will remember, was the third.

Cle. I quite remember.

Ath. Thus far I have spoken of the chorus of Apollo and the Muses, and I
have still to speak of the remaining chorus, which is that of Dionysus.

Cle. How is that arranged? There is something strange, at any rate on
first hearing, in a Dionysiac chorus of old men, if you really mean that
those who are above thirty, and may be fifty, or from fifty to sixty
years of age, are to dance in his honour.

Ath. Very true; and therefore it must be shown that there is good reason
for the proposal.

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. Are we agreed thus far?

Cle. About what?

Ath. That every man and boy, slave and free, both sexes, and the whole
city, should never cease charming themselves with the strains of which
we have spoken; and that there should be every sort of change and
variation of them in order to take away the effect of sameness, so that
the singers may always receive pleasure from their hymns, and may never
weary of them?

Cle. Every one will agree.

Ath. Where, then, will that best part of our city which, by reason of
age and intelligence, has the greatest influence, sing these fairest of
strains, which are to do so much good? Shall we be so foolish as to let
them off who would give us the most beautiful and also the most useful
of songs?

Cle. But, says the argument, we cannot let them off.

Ath. Then how can we carry out our purpose with decorum? Will this be
the way?

Cle. What?

Ath. When a man is advancing in years, he is afraid and reluctant to
sing;-he has no pleasure in his own performances; and if compulsion is
used, he will be more and more ashamed, the older and more discreet he
grows;-is not this true?

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. Well, and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has to stand up and
sing in the theatre to a mixed audience?-and if moreover when he is
required to do so, like the other choirs who contend for prizes, and
have been trained under a singing master, he is pinched and hungry, he
will certainly have a feeling of shame and discomfort which will make
him very unwilling to exhibit.

Cle. No doubt.

Ath. How, then, shall we reassure him, and get him to sing? Shall we
begin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at all until they are
eighteen years of age; we will tell them that fire must not be poured
upon fire, whether in the body or in the soul, until they begin to go to
work-this is a precaution which has to be taken against the
excitableness of youth;-afterwards they may taste wine in moderation up
to the age of thirty, but while a man is young he should abstain
altogether from intoxication and from excess of wine; when, at length,
he has reached forty years, after dinner at a public mess, he may invite
not only the other Gods, but Dionysus above all, to the mystery and
festivity of the elder men, making use of the wine which he has given
men to lighten the sourness of old age; that in age we may renew our
youth, and forget our sorrows; and also in order that the nature of the
soul, like iron melted in the fire, may become softer and so more
impressible. In the first place, will not any one who is thus mellowed
be more ready and less ashamed to sing-I do not say before a large
audience, but before a moderate company; nor yet among strangers, but
among his familiars, and, as we have often said, to chant, and to
enchant?

Cle. He will be far more ready.

Ath. There will be no impropriety in our using such a method of
persuading them to join with us in song.

Cle. None at all.

Ath. And what strain will they sing, and what muse will they hymn? The
strain should clearly be one suitable to them.

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. And what strain is suitable for heroes? Shall they sing a choric
strain?

Cle. Truly, Stranger, we of Crete and Lacedaemon know no strain other
than that which we have learnt and been accustomed to sing in our
chorus.

Ath. I dare say; for you have never acquired the knowledge of the most
beautiful kind of song, in your military way of life, which is modelled
after the camp, and is not like that of dwellers in cities; and you have
your young men herding and feeding together like young colts. No one
takes his own individual colt and drags him away from his fellows
against his will, raging and foaming, and gives him a groom to attend to
him alone, and trains and rubs him down privately, and gives him the
qualities in education which will make him not only a good soldier, but
also a governor of a state and of cities. Such an one, as we said at
first, would be a greater warrior than he of whom Tyrtaeus sings; and he
would honour courage everywhere, but always as the fourth, and not as
the first part of virtue, either in individuals or states.

Cle. Once more, Stranger, I must complain that you depreciate our
lawgivers.

Ath. Not intentionally, if at all, my good friend; but whither the
argument leads, thither let us follow; for if there be indeed some
strain of song more beautiful than that of the choruses or the public
theatres, I should like to impart it to those who, as we say, are
ashamed of these, and want to have the best.

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. When things have an accompanying charm, either the best thing in
them is this very charm, or there is some rightness or utility possessed
by them;-for example, I should say that eating and drinking, and the use
of food in general, have an accompanying charm which we call pleasure;
but that this rightness and utility is just the healthfulness of the
things served up to us, which is their true rightness. Cle. Just so.

Ath. Thus, too, I should say that learning has a certain accompanying
charm which is the pleasure; but that the right and the profitable, the
good and the noble, are qualities which the truth gives to it.

Cle. Exactly.

Ath. And so in the imitative arts-if they succeed in making likenesses,
and are accompanied by pleasure, may not their works be said to have a
charm?

Cle. Yes.

Ath. But equal proportions, whether of quality or quantity, and not
pleasure, speaking generally, would give them truth or rightness.

Cle. Yes.

Ath. Then that only can be rightly judged by the standard of pleasure,
which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or likeness, nor on the
other hand is productive of any hurtful quality, but exists solely for
the sake of the accompanying charm; and the term "pleasure" is most
appropriately applied to it when these other qualities are absent.

Cle. You are speaking of harmless pleasure, are you not?

Ath. Yes; and this I term amusement, when doing neither harm nor good in
any degree worth speaking of.

Cle. Very true.

Ath. Then, if such be our principles, we must assert that imitation is
not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion; and this is true of
all equality, for the equal is not equal or the symmetrical symmetrical,
because somebody thinks or likes something, but they are to be judged of
by the standard of truth, and by no other whatever.

Cle. Quite true.

Ath. Do we not regard all music as representative and imitative?

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. Then, when any one says that music is to be judged of by pleasure,
his doctrine cannot be admitted; and if there be any music of which
pleasure is the criterion, such music is not to be sought out or deemed
to have any real excellence, but only that other kind of music which is
an imitation of the good.

Cle. Very true.

Ath. And those who seek for the best kind of song and music ought not to
seek for that which is pleasant, but for that which is true; and the
truth of imitation consists, as we were saying, in rendering the thing
imitated according to quantity and quality.

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. And every one will admit that musical compositions are all
imitative and representative. Will not poets and spectators and actors
all agree in this?

Cle. They will.

Ath. Surely then he who would judge correctly must know what each
composition is; for if he does not know what is the character and
meaning of the piece, and what it represents, he will never discern
whether the intention is true or false.

Cle. Certainly not.

Ath. And will he who does not know what is true be able to distinguish
what is good and bad? My statement is not very clear; but perhaps you
will understand me better if I put the matter in another way.

Cle. How?

Ath. There are ten thousand likenesses of objects of sight?

Cle. Yes.

Ath. And can he who does not know what the exact object is which is
imitated, ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully executed? I
mean, for example, whether a statue has the proportions of a body, and
the true situation of the parts; what those proportions are, and how the
parts fit into one another in due order; also their colours and
conformations, or whether this is all confused in the execution: do you
think that any one can know about this, who does not know what the
animal is which has been imitated?

Cle. Impossible.

Ath. But even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured is a man,
who has received at the hand of the artist all his proper parts and
colours and shapes, must we not also know whether the work is beautiful
or in any respect deficient in beauty?

Cle. If this were not required, Stranger, we should all of us be judges
of beauty.

Ath. Very true; and may we not say that in everything imitated, whether
in drawing, music, or any other art, he who is to be a competent judge
must possess three things;-he must know, in the first place, of what the
imitation is; secondly, he must know that it is true; and thirdly, that
it has been well executed in words and melodies and rhythms?

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. Then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficulty of
music. Music is more celebrated than any other kind of imitation, and
therefore requires the greatest care of them all. For if a man makes a
mistake here, he may do himself the greatest injury by welcoming evil
dispositions, and the mistake may be very difficult to discern, because
the poets are artists very inferior in character to the Muses
themselves, who would never fall into the monstrous error of assigning
to the words of men the gestures and songs of women; nor after combining
the melodies with the gestures of freemen would they add on the rhythms
of slaves and men of the baser sort; nor, beginning with the rhythms and
gestures of freemen, would they assign to them a melody or words which
are of an opposite character; nor would they mix up the voices and
sounds of animals and of men and instruments, and every other sort of
noise, as if they were all one. But human poets are fond of introducing
this sort of inconsistent mixture, and so make themselves ridiculous in
the eyes of those who, as Orpheus says, "are ripe for true pleasure."
The experienced see all this confusion, and yet the poets go on and make
still further havoc by separating the rhythm and the figure of the dance
from the melody, setting bare words to metre, and also separating the
melody and the rhythm from the words, using the lyre or the flute alone.
For when there are no words, it is very difficult to recognize the
meaning of the harmony and rhythm, or to see that any worthy object is
imitated by them. And we must acknowledge that all this sort of thing,
which aims only at swiftness and smoothness and a brutish noise, and
uses the flute and the lyre not as the mere accompaniments of the dance
and song, is exceedingly coarse and tasteless. The use of either
instrument, when unaccompanied, leads to every sort of irregularity and
trickery. This is all rational enough. But we are considering not how
our choristers, who are from thirty to fifty years of age, and may be
over fifty, are not to use the Muses, but how they are to use them. And
the considerations which we have urged seem to show in what way these
fifty year-old choristers who are to sing, may be expected to be better
trained. For they need to have a quick perception and knowledge of
harmonies and rhythms; otherwise, how can they ever know whether a
melody would be rightly sung to the Dorian mode, or to the rhythm which
the poet has assigned to it?

Cle. Clearly they cannot.

Ath. The many are ridiculous in imagining that they know what is in
proper harmony and rhythm, and what is not, when they can only be made
to sing and step in rhythm by force; it never occurs to them that they
are ignorant of what they are doing. Now every melody is right when it
has suitable harmony and rhythm, and wrong when unsuitable.

Cle. That is most certain.

Ath. But can a man who does not know a thing, as we were saying, know
that the thing is right?

Cle. Impossible.

Ath. Then now, as would appear, we are making the discovery that our
newly-appointed choristers, whom we hereby invite and, although they are
their own masters, compel to sing, must be educated to such an extent as
to be able to follow the steps of the rhythm and the notes of the song,
that they may know the harmonies and rhythms, and be able to select what
are suitable for men of their age and character to sing; and may sing
them, and have innocent pleasure from their own performance, and also
lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delight good dispositions.
Having such training, they will attain a more accurate knowledge than
falls to the lot of the common people, or even of the poets themselves.
For the poet need not know the third point, viz., whether the imitation
is good or not, though he can hardly help knowing the laws of melody and
rhythm. But the aged chorus must know all the three, that they may
choose the best, and that which is nearest to the best; for otherwise
they will never be able to charm the souls of young men in the way of
virtue. And now the original design of the argument which was intended
to bring eloquent aid to the Chorus of Dionysus, has been accomplished
to the best of our ability, and let us see whether we were right:-I
should imagine that a drinking assembly is likely to become more and
more tumultuous as the drinking goes on: this, as we were saying at
first, will certainly be the case.

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. Every man has a more than natural elevation; his heart is glad
within him, and he will say anything and will be restrained by nobody at
such a time; he fancies that he is able to rule over himself and all
mankind.

Cle. Quite true.

Ath. Were we not saying that on such occasions the souls of the drinkers
become like iron heated in the fire, and grow softer and younger, and
are easily moulded by him who knows how to educate and fashion them,
just as when they were young, and that this fashioner of them is the
same who prescribed for them in the days of their youth, viz., the good
legislator; and that he ought to enact laws of the banquet, which, when
a man is confident, bold, and impudent, and unwilling to wait his turn
and have his share of silence and speech, and drinking and music, will
change his character into the opposite-such laws as will infuse into him
a just and noble fear, which will take up arms at the approach of
insolence, being that divine fear which we have called reverence and
shame?

Cle. True.

Ath. And the guardians of these laws and fellow-workers with them are
the calm and sober generals of the drinkers; and without their help
there is greater difficulty in fighting against drink than in fighting
against enemies when the commander of an army is not himself calm; and
he who is unwilling to obey them and the commanders of Dionysiac feasts
who are more than sixty years of age, shall suffer a disgrace as great
as he who disobeys military leaders, or even greater.

Cle. Right.

Ath. If, then, drinking and amusement were regulated in this way, would
not the companions of our revels be improved? they would part better
friends than they were, and not, as now enemies. Their whole intercourse
would be regulated by law and observant of it, and the sober would be
the leaders of the drunken.

Cle. I think so too, if drinking were regulated as you propose.

Ath. Let us not then simply censure the gift of Dionysus as bad and
unfit to be received into the State. For wine has many excellences, and
one pre-eminent one, about which there is a difficulty in speaking to
the many, from a fear of their misconceiving and misunderstanding what
is said.

Cle. To what do you refer?

Ath. There is a tradition or story, which has somehow crept about the
world, that Dionysus was robbed of his wits by his stepmother Here, and
that out of revenge he inspires Bacchic furies and dancing madnesses in
others; for which reason he gave men wine. Such traditions concerning
the Gods I leave to those who think that they may be safely uttered; I
only know that no animal at birth is mature or perfect in intelligence;
and in the intermediate period, in which he has not yet acquired his own
proper sense, he rages and roars without rhyme or reason; and when he
has once got on his legs he jumps about without rhyme or reason; and
this, as you will remember, has been already said by us to be the origin
of music and gymnastic.

Cle. To be sure, I remember.

Ath. And did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythm sprang from
this beginning among men, and that Apollo and the Muses and Dionysus
were the Gods whom we had to thank for them?

Cle. Certainly.

Ath. The other story implied that wine was given man out of revenge, and
in order to make him mad; but our present doctrine, on the contrary, is,
that wine was given him as a balm, and in order to implant modesty in
the soul, and health and strength in the body.

Cle. That, Stranger, is precisely what was said.

Ath. Then half the subject may now be considered to have been discussed;
shall we proceed to the consideration of the other half?

Cle. What is the other half, and how do you divide the subject?

Ath. The whole choral art is also in our view the whole of education;
and of this art, rhythms and harmonies form the part which has to do
with the voice.

Cle. Yes.

Ath. The movement of the body has rhythm in common with the movement of
the voice, but gesture is peculiar to it, whereas song is simply the
movement of the voice.

Cle. Most true.

Ath. And the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the soul, we
have ventured to term music.

Cle. We were right.

Ath. And the movement of the body, when regarded as an amusement, we
termed dancing; but when extended and pursued with a view to the
excellence of the body, this scientific training may be called
gymnastic.

Cle. Exactly.

Ath. Music, which was one half of the choral art, may be said to have
been completely discussed. Shall we proceed to the other half or not?
What would you like?

Cle. My good friend, when you are talking with a Cretan and
Lacedaemonian, and we have discussed music and not gymnastic, what
answer are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry?

Ath. An answer is contained in your question; and I understand and
accept what you say not only as an answer, but also as a command to
proceed with gymnastic.

Cle. You quite understand me; do as you say.

Ath. I will; and there will not be any difficulty in speaking
intelligibly to you about a subject with which both of you are far more
familiar than with music.

Cle. There will not.

Ath. Is not the origin of gymnastics, too, to be sought in the tendency
to rapid motion which exists in all animals; man, as we were saying,
having attained the sense of rhythm, created and invented dancing; and
melody arousing and awakening rhythm, both united formed the choral art?

Cle. Very true.

Ath. And one part of this subject has been already discussed by us, and
there still remains another to be discussed?

Cle. Exactly.

Ath. I have first a final word to add to my discourse about drink, if
you will allow me to do so.

Cle. What more have you to say?

Ath. I should say that if a city seriously means to adopt the practice
of drinking under due regulation and with a view to the enforcement of
temperance, and in like manner, and on the same principle, will allow of
other pleasures, designing to gain the victory over them in this way all
of them may be used. But if the State makes drinking an amusement only,
and whoever likes may drink whenever he likes, and with whom he likes,
and add to this any other indulgences, I shall never agree or allow that
this city or this man should practise drinking. I would go further than
the Cretans and Lacedaemonians, and am disposed rather to the law of the
Carthaginians, that no one while he is on a campaign should be allowed
to taste wine at all, but that he should drink water during all that
time, and that in the city no slave, male or female, should ever drink
wine; and that no magistrates should drink during their year of office,
nor should pilots of vessels or judges while on duty taste wine at all,
nor any one who is going to hold a consultation about any matter of
importance; nor in the daytime at all, unless in consequence of exercise
or as medicine; nor again at night, when any one, either man or woman,
is minded to get children. There are numberless other cases also in
which those who have good sense and good laws ought not to drink wine,
so that if what I say is true, no city will need many vineyards. Their
husbandry and their way of life in general will follow an appointed
order, and their cultivation of the vine will be the most limited and
the least common of their employments. And this, Stranger, shall be the
crown of my discourse about wine, if you agree.

Cle. Excellent: we agree.
