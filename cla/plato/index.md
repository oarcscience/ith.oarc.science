---
Plato, the greatest philosopher of ancient Greece, was born in Athens in
428 or 427 B.C.E. to an aristocratic family. He studied under Socrates,
who appears as a character in many of his dialogues. He attended
Socrates' trial and that traumatic experience may have led to his
attempt to design an ideal society. Following the death of Socrates he
travelled widely in search of learning. After twelve years he returned
to Athens and founded his Academy, one of the earliest organized schools
in western civilization. Among Plato's pupils was
[Aristotle](../ari/index.md). Some of Plato's other influences were
Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, and Parmenides.

Plato wrote extensively and most of his writings survived. His works are
in the form of dialogues, where several characters argue a topic by
asking questions of each other. This form allows Plato to raise various
points of view and let the reader decide which is valid. Plato expounded
a form of dualism, where there is a world of ideal forms separate from
the world of perception. The most famous exposition of this is his
metaphor of the Cave, where people living in a cave are only able to see
flickering shadows projected on the wall of the external reality. This
influenced many later thinkers, particularly the Neoplatonists and the
[Gnostics](../../gno/index.md), and is similar to views held by some
schools of [Hindu](../../hin/index.md) dualistic metaphysics.

Plato died in 347 B.C.E. In the middle ages he was eclipsed by
[Aristotle](../ari/index.md). His works were saved for posterity by Islamic
scholars and reintroduced into the west in the Renaissance. Since then
he has been a strong influence on philosophy, as well as natural and
social science.

Although the exact order of the dialogues is not known, the following is
a consensus ordering based on internal evidence:

#### Early Dialogues

In these dialogues, Socrates is the central character, and is believed
to be expressing his own views. These are the only remaining record of
Socrates' teachings; hence these are known as the Socratic dialogues.

#### Middle Dialogues

In these dialogues, Plato begins expressing his own views, in the guise
of Socrates. The Symposium and Republic are the most important works in
this period.

#### Late Dialogues

The later dialogues are deeper developments of the philosophy expressed
in the earlier ones; these are the most difficult of Plato's works.
