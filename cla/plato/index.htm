<P>
Plato, the greatest philosopher of ancient Greece, was born in Athens in 428 or 427 B.C.E. to an aristocratic family.
He studied under Socrates, who appears as a character in many of his dialogues.
He attended Socrates' trial and that traumatic experience may have
led to his attempt to design an ideal society.
Following the death of Socrates he travelled widely in search of learning.
After twelve years he returned to Athens and founded his Academy, one
of the earliest organized schools in western civilization.
Among Plato's pupils was <A HREF="../ari/index.htm">Aristotle</A>.
Some of Plato's other influences were Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, and Parmenides.
</P>
<P>
Plato wrote extensively and most of his writings survived.
His works are in the form of dialogues, where several characters
argue a topic by asking questions of each other.
This form allows Plato to raise various points of view and let the
reader decide which is valid.
Plato expounded a form of dualism, where there is a world of ideal forms
separate from the world of perception.
The most famous exposition of this is his metaphor of the Cave, where
people living in a cave are only able to see flickering shadows projected
on the wall of the external reality.
This influenced many later thinkers, particularly the Neoplatonists
and the <A HREF="../../gno/index.htm">Gnostics</A>, and is similar to
views held by some schools
of <A HREF="../../hin/index.htm">Hindu</A> dualistic metaphysics.
</P>
<P>
Plato died in 347 B.C.E.
In the middle ages he was eclipsed
by <A HREF="../ari/index.htm">Aristotle</A>.
His works were saved for posterity by Islamic scholars and
reintroduced into the west in the Renaissance.
Since then he has been a strong influence on philosophy, as well as
natural and social science.
</P>
<P>
Although the exact order of the dialogues is not known,
the following is a consensus ordering based on internal evidence:</P>
<span class="c_da"><!-- Plato --></span>

<H4>Early Dialogues</H4>
<P>
In these dialogues, Socrates is the central character, and is believed
to be expressing his own views.
These are the only remaining record of Socrates' teachings;
hence these are known as the <CITE>Socratic dialogues</CITE>.

In these dialogues, Plato begins expressing his own views,
in the guise of Socrates.
