### I. HOW THE GREAT GENERAL BELISARIUS WAS HOODWINKED BY HIS WIFE, WHOSE LOVER BECAME A MONK

THE father of Belisarius's wife, a lady whom I have mentioned in my
former books, was (and so was her grandfather) a charioteer, exhibiting
that trade in Constantinople and Thessalonica. Her mother was one of the
wenches of the theater; and she herself from the first led an utterly
wanton life. Acquainted with magic drugs used by her parents before her,
she learned how to use those of compelling qualities and became the
wedded wife of Belisarius, after having already borne many children.

Now she was unfaithful as a wife from the start, but was careful to
conceal her indiscretions by the usual precautions; not from any awe of
her spouse (for she never felt any shame at anything, and fooled him

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

easily with her deceptions), but because she feared the punishment of
the Empress. For Theodora hated her, and had already shown her teeth.
But when that Queen became involved in difficulties, she won her
friendship by helping her, first to destroy Silverius, as shall be
related presently, and later to ruin John of Cappadocia, as I have told
elsewhere. After that, she became more and more fearless, and casting
all concealment aside, abandoned herself to the winds of desire.

There was a youth from Thrace in the house of Belisarius: Theodosius by
name, and of the Eunomian heresy by descent. On the eve of his
expedition to Libya, Belisarius baptized this boy in holy water and
received him in his arms as a member henceforth of the family, welcoming
him with his wife as their son, according to the Christian rite of
adoption. And Antonina not only embraced Theodosius with reasonable
fondness as her son by holy

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

word, and thus cared for him, but soon, while her husband was away on
his campaign, became wildly in love with him; and, out of her senses
with this malady, shook off all fear and shame of God and man. She began
by enjoying him surreptitiously, and ended by dallying with him in the
presence of the men servants and waiting maids. For she was now
possessed by passion and, openly overwhelmed with love, could see no
hindrance to its consummation.

Once, in Carthage, Belisarius caught her in the very act, but allowed
himself to be deceived by his wife. Finding the two in an underground
room, he was very angry; but she said, showing no fear or attempt to
keep anything hidden, "I came here with the boy to bury the most
precious part of our plunder, where the Emperor will not discover it."
So she said by way of excuse, and he dismissed the matter as if he
believed her, even as he saw Theodosius's trousers belt somewhat
unmodestly unfastened.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For so bound by
love for the woman was he, that he preferred to distrust the evidence of
his own eyes.

As her folly progressed to an indescribable extent, those who saw what
was going on kept silent, except one slave, Macedonia by name. When
Belisarius was in Syracuse as the conqueror of Sicily, she made her
master swear solemnly never to betray her to her mistress, and then told
him the whole story, presenting as witnesses two slave boys attending
the bed-chamber.

When he heard this, Belisarius ordered one of his guards to put
Theodosius away; but the latter learned of this in time to flee to
Ephesus. For most of the servants, inspired by the weakness of the
husband's character, were more anxious to please his wife than to show
loyalty to him, and so betrayed the order he had given. But Constantine,
when he saw Belisarius's grief at what had befallen him, sympathized

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

entirely except to comment, "I would have tried to kill the woman rather
than the young man." Antonina heard of this, and hated him in secret.
How malicious was her spite against him shall be shown; for she was a
scorpion who could hide her sting.

But not long after this, by the enchantment either of philtres or of her
caresses, she persuaded her husband that the charges against her were
untrue. Without more ado he sent word to Theodosius to return, and
promised to turn Macedonia and the two slave boys over to his wife. She
first cruelly cut out their tongues, it is said, and then cut their
bodies into little bits which were put into sacks and thrown into the
sea. One of her slaves, Eugenius, who had already wrought the outrage on
Silverius, helped her in this crime.

And it was not long after this that Belisarius was persuaded by his wife
to kill Constantine. What happened at that time concerning Presidius and
the daggers I have

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

narrated in my previous books. For while Belisarius would have preferred
to let Constantine alone, Antonina gave him no peace until his remark,
which I have just repeated, was avenged. And as a result of this murder,
much enmity was aroused against Belisarius in the hearts of the Emperor
and all the most important of the Romans.

So matters progressed. But Theodosius said he was unable to return to
Italy, where Belisarius and Antonina were now staying, unless Photius
were put out of the way. For this Photius was the sort who would bite if
anyone got the better of him in anything, and he had reason to be choked
with indignation at Theodosius. Though he was the rightful son, he was
utterly disregarded while the other grew in power and riches: they say
that from the two palaces at Carthage and Ravenna Theodosius had taken
plunder amounting to a hundred centenaries, as he alone had been given
the management of these conquered properties.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

But Antonina, when she learned of Theodosius's fear, never ceased laying
snares for her son and planning deadly plots against his welfare, until
he saw he would have to escape to Constantinople if he wished to live.
Then Theodosius came to Italy and her. There they stayed in the
satisfaction of their love, unhindered by the complaisant husband; and
later she took them both to Constantinople. There Theodosius became so
worried lest the affair became generally known, that he was at his wit's
end. He saw it would be impossible to fool everybody, as the woman was
no longer able to conceal her passion and indulge it secretly, but
thought nothing of being in fact and in reputation an avowed adulteress.

Therefore he went back to Ephesus, and having his head shaved after the
religious custom, became a monk. Whereupon Antonina, insane over her
loss, exhibited her grief by donning mourning; and went

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

around the house shrieking and wailing, lamenting even in the presence
of her husband what a good friend she had lost, how faithful, how
tender, how loving, how energetic! In the end, even her spouse was won
over to join in her sorrow. And so the poor wretch wept too, calling for
his beloved Theodosius. Later he even went to the Emperor and implored
both him and the Empress, till they consented to summon Theodosius to
return, as one who was and would always be a necessity in the house of
Belisarius.

But Theodosius refused to leave his monastery, saying he was completely
resolved to give himself forever to the cloistered life. This noble
pronouncement, however, was not entirely sincere, for he was aware that
as soon as Belisarius left Constantinople, it would be possible for him
to come secretly to Antonina. Which, indeed, he did.
