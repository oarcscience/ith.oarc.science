Procopius, who also wrote a mainstream military history and a toadying
description of the monuments which Justinian built, had to keep his most
acute writing for posthumous publication. This text flays Justinian and
Theodora as corrupt, immoral, and just plain evil. Even though the
account sounds fantastic, it is considered genuine by modern historians
(but not necessarily accurate). Of course, the Eastern Orthodox Church
considers Justinian a saint, so you'll either love or hate this book.

The original title of this work was Anecdota, which means (as far as I
can tell) 'things not given over, withheld.' I can say that there are a
few *anecdotes* here which fall into the realm of the fantastic.
Procopius speculates that Justinian might have been something . . . not
even human, perhaps vampiric. He soberly quotes eyewitness accounts of
Justinian shapeshifting into a 'shapeless mass of flesh,' and literally
losing--and retrieving--his head ([p. 132](shp15.htm#page_132).md). It
sounds just like a modern horror movie special effect. . . . In another
place, the translation has Justinian killing a 'trillion' people. The
text actually says "A myriad myriads of myriads" (a myriad is the
highest number in Greek, 10,000). \[By my reckoning, that is
10<sup>5\*3</sup> = 10<sup>15</sup> = 100,000,000,000,000, or 100
trillion.\] All of this is a bit sophistical of course, what Procopius
obviously means here is "a ridiculous number."

The artistic san-serif 'Procopius' typeface was first used to typeset
this book. [A sample page can be found here](img/02700.jpg.md).
