<H2 ALIGN="center">BEROSSUS:<BR>FROM APOLLODORUS.</H2>

<H3 ALIGN="center">OF THE CHALD&AElig;AN KINGS.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T<SMALL>HIS</SMALL> is the history which Berossus has transmitted to us. He tells us that the first king was Alorus of Babylon, a Chald&aelig;an: he reigned ten sari: and afterwards Alaparus, and Amelon who came from Pantibiblon: then Ammenon the Chald&aelig;an, in whose time appeared the Musarus Oannes the Annedotus from the Erythr&aelig;an sea. (But Alexander Polyhistor anticipating the event, has said that he appeared in the first year; but Apollodorus says that it was after forty sari; Abydenus, however, makes the second Annedotus appear after twenty-six sari.) Then succeeded Megalarus from the city of Pantibiblon; and he reigned eighteen sari: and after him Daonus the shepherd from Pantibiblon reigned ten sari; in his time (he says) appeared again from the Erythr&aelig;an sea a fourth Annedotus, having the same form with those above, the shape of a fish blended with that of a man. Then reigned Euedorachus from Pantibiblon, for the term of eighteen sari; in his days there appeared another personage from the Erythr&aelig;an sea like the former, having the same complicated form between a fish and a man, whose name was Odacon. (All these, says Apollodorus, related particularly and circumstantially whatever Oannes had informed them of: concerning these Abydenus has made no mention.) Then reigned Amempsinus, a Chald&aelig;an from Laranch&aelig;: and he being the eighth in order reigned ten sari. Then reigned Otiartes, a Chald&aelig;an, from Laranch&aelig;; and he reigned eight sari. And upon the death of Otiartes, his son Xisuthrus reigned eighteen sari: in his time happened the great deluge. So that the sum of all the kings is ten; and the term which they collectively reigned an hundred and twenty sari.&#8212;<I>Syncel. Chron.</I> 39.&#8212;<I>Euseb. Chron.</I> 5.</P>
