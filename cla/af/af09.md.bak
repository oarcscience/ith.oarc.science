## FRAGMENTS OF THE HERMETIC, ORPHIC, PYTHAGOREAN, AND OTHER COSMOGONIES AND THEOGONIES. 

### FROM THE ANCIENT HERMETIC BOOKS.

   B<span class="small">EFORE</span> all things that essentially exist,
and before the total principles, there is one God, prior to the first
God and King, remaining immoveable in the solitude of his unity; for
neither is the Intelligible immixed with him, nor any other thing. He is
established, the exemplar of the God who is the father of himself,
self-begotten, the only father, and who is truly good. For he is
something greater, and the first; the fountain of all things, and the
root of all primary Intelligible existing forms. But out of this one,
the self-ruling God made himself shine forth; wherefore he is the father
of himself, and self-ruling: for he is the first principle and God of
Gods. He is the monad from the one; before essence, yet the first
principle of essence, for from him is entity and essence; on which
account he is celebrated as the chief of the Intelligibles. These are
the most ancient principles of all things, which Hermes places first in
order, before the ethereal and empyrean gods and the celestial.

   But, according to another division, he (Hermes) places the god
Emeph<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md) as the ruler of the celestial
gods: and says that he is Intellect understanding himself, and
converting other intelligences to himself. And before this he places the
indivisible One, which he calls the first effigies, and denominates him
Eicton; in whom, indeed, is the first intellect and the first
Intelligible: and this One is venerated in silence. Besides these, other
rulers are imagined to exist, which govern the fabrication of things
apparent: for the demiurgic Intellect, which properly presides over
truth and wisdom, when it proceeds to generation and leads forth into
light the inapparent power of the secret reasons, is called Amon,
according to the Egyptian tongue: and when it perfects all things not
dcceptively, but artificially according to truth, Phtha; but the Greeks
change the word Phtha into Hephæstus, looking only to the artificial:
regarded as the producer of good things, it is called Osiris, and
according to its other powers and attributes it has different
appellations. There is also, according to them, another certain
principle presiding over all the elements in a state of generation, and
over the powers inherent in them, four of which are male, and four
female; and this principle they attribute to the Sun. There is yet
another principle of all nature regarded as the ruler over generation,
and this they assign to the Moon. They divide the heavens also into two
parts, or into four, or twelve, or thirty-six, or the doubles of these;
they attribute to them leaders more or less in number; and over them
they place one whom they consider superior to them all. Hence, from the
highest to the last, the doctrine of the Egyptians concerning the
principles, inculcates the origin of all things from One, with different
gradations to the Many; which (the Many) are again held to be under the
supreme government of the One: and the nature of the Boundless is
considered entirely subservient to the nature of the Bounded and the
supreme Unity the cause of all things. And God produced Matter from the
materiality of the separated essence, which being of a vivific nature,
the Demiurgus took it, and fabricated from it the harmonious and
imperturbable spheres: but the dregs of it he employed in the
fabrication of generated and perishable bodies.—*Jambl*. sect. viii. c.
2. 3.

### FROM THE MODERN HERMETIC BOOKS.

   The glory of all things is God, and Deity, and divine Nature. The
principle of all things existing is God, and the Intellect, and Nature,
and Matter, and Energy, and Fate, and Conclusion, and Renovation. For
there were boundless Darkness in the abyss, and water, and a subtile
spirit, intellectual in power, existing in Chaos. But the holy Light
broke forth, and the elements were produced from among the sand of a
watery essence.—*Serm. Sac.* lib. iii.

### FROM HORAPOLLO.

   The world appears to them (the Egyptians) to consist of a masculine
and feminine nature. And they engrave a scarabæus for Athena, and a
vulture for Hephæstus. For these alone of all the Gods they consider as
both male and female in their nature.

### FROM CHÆREMON.

   Chæremon and others believe that nothing existed prior to the
sensible worlds, and they place among the foremost of such opinions the
sentiments of the Egyptians, who hold that there are no other gods than
those which are called the planets, and the constellations of the
Zodiac, and such as these. They say, also, that the honours paid to the
ten great gods and those which are called heroes, whose names appear in
the almanacks, are nothing else than charms for the cure of evils, and
observations of the risings and settings of the stars, and
prognostications of future events. For it seems that they esteem the Sun
to be the demiurgus, and hold that the legends about Osiris and Isis,
and all other their mythological fables, have reference either to the
stars, their appearances and occultations, and the periods of their
risings, or to the increase and decrease of the moon, or to the cycles
of the sun, or the diurnal and nocturnal hemispheres, or to the river:
in short, that every thing of the kind relates merely to physical
operations, and has no connexion or reference whatever to incorporeal
and living essences properly so called. Most of them, also, suppose that
some indissoluble connexion exists between our concerns and the motions
of the stars, by a kind of necessity which they call Destiny, whereby
all sublunary things are connected with these gods, and depend upon
them. Hence they serve and honour them with temples and statues and the
like, as the only beings capable of influencing Destiny.—*Eus. Pr.
Evan.* iii. c. 4.
