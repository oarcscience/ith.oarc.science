## SUPPLEMENTAL FRAGMENTS AND EXTRACTS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE CHALDÆAN HISTORY.

### OF THE ARK: FROM NICOLAUS DAMASCENUS.<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md)

   T<span class="small">HERE</span> is above Minyas in the land of
Armenia a very great mountain which is called Baris;<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md) to which, it is said, that many persons
retreated at the time of the deluge, and were saved; and that one in
particular was carried thither in an ark, and was landed on its summit,
and that the remains of the vessel were long preserved upon the
mountain. Perhaps this was the same individual of whom Moses the
legislator of the Jews has made mention.—Jos. *Ant. Jud.* I. 3.—*Euseb.
Præp. Evan.* 9.

### OF THE DISPERSION: FROM HESTIÆUS.

   T<span class="small">HE</span> priests who escaped took with them the
implements of the worship of the Enyalian Jove, and came to Senaar in
Babylonia. But they were again driven from thence by the introduction of
a diversity of tongues: upon which they founded colonies in various
parts, each settling in such situations as chance or the direction of
God led them to occupy.—*Jos. Ant. Jud.* I. c. 4.—*Euseb. Præp. Evan.*
9.

### OF THE TOWER OF BABEL: FROM ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR.

   T<span class="small">HE</span> Sibyl says: That when all men formerly
spoke the same language; some among them undertook to erect a large and
lofty tower, that they might climb up into heaven. But God<span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3.md) sending forth a whirlwind, confounded
their design, and gave to each tribe a particular language of its own:
which is the reason that the name of that city is Babylon. After the
deluge lived Titan and Prometheus; when Titan undertook a war against
Cronus.<span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4.md)—*Sync*. 44.—*Jos. Ant. Jud.*
I. c. 4—*Eus. Præp. Evan.* 9.

   She then mentions Cronus, Titan and Jäpetus, and the three sons of
the patriarch governing the world in the tenth generation after the
deluge, thus,

### OF SCYTHISM AND HELLENISM FROM EPIPHANIUS.<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6.md)

   The parents of all the heresies, and the prototypes from which they
derive their names, and from which all other heresies originate, are
these four primary ones.

   The first is Barbarism,<span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#note_7.md) which
prevailed without a rival from the days of Adam through ten generations
to the time of Noah. It is called Barbarism, because men had no rulers,
nor submitted to any particular discipline of life; but as each thought
proper to prescribe to himself; so he was at liberty to follow the
dictates of his own inclination.

   The second is Scythism which prevailed from the days of Noah and
thence downwards to the building of the tower and Babylon, and for a few
years subsequently to that time, that is to the days of Phalec and
Ragau. But the nations which incline upon the borders of Europe
continued addicted to the Scythic heresy, and the customs of the
Scythians to the age of Thera, and afterwards; of this sect also were
the Thracians.

   The third is Hellenism, which originated in the days of Seruch with
the introduction of idolatry: and as men had hitherto followed each some
demonolatrous superstition of his own, they were now reduced to a more
established form of polity, and to the rites and ceremonies of idols.
And the followers of this began with the use of painting, making
likenesses of those whom they had formerly honoured, either kings or
chiefs, or men who in their lives had performed actions which they
deemed worthy of record, by strength or excellence of body.

   The Egyptians, and Babylonians, and Phrygians, and Phœnicians were
the first propagators of this superstition of making images, and of the
mysteries: from whom it was transferred to the Greeks from the time of
Cecrops downwards. But it was not till afterwards and at a considerable
interval that Cronus and Rhea, Zeus and Apollo, and the rest were
esteemed and honoured as gods.

   The following extract is given in Epiphanius preceding the above.

   A<span class="small">ND</span> from the times of Tharra the father of
Abraham, they introduced images and all the errors of idolatry;
honouring their forefathers, and their departed predecessors with
effigies which they fashioned after their likeness. They first made
these effigies of earthern ware, but afterwards according to their
different arts they sculptured them in stone, and cast them in silver
and gold, and wrought them in wood, and all kinds of different
materials.

### OF HELLENISM: FROM CEDRENUS.

   O<span class="small">F</span> the tribe of Japhet was born Seruch,
who first introduced Hellenism and the worship of idols. For he and
those who concurred with him in opinion honoured their predecessors
whether warriors or leaders, or characters renowned during their lives
for valour or virtue with columnar statues, as if they had been their
progenitors, and tendered to them a species of religious veneration as a
kind of gods and sacrificed. But after this their successors,
overstepping the intention of their ancestors that they should honour
them as their progenitors and the inventors of good things with
monuments alone, honoured them as heavenly gods and sacrificed to them
as such. And the following was the form of their canonization: they
inscribed their names after their decease in their sacred books and
established a festival to each at certain seasons, saying that their
souls had departed to the islands of the blessed and were never
condemned or burnt with fire.

### OF THE TOWER OF BABEL AND ABRAHAM: FROM EUPOLEMUS.

   T<span class="small">HE</span> city of Babylon owes its foundation to
those who were saved from the catastrophe of the deluge: they were the
Giants, and they built the tower which is noticed in history. But the
tower being overthrown by the interposition of God, the Giants were
scattered over all the earth.

   He says moreover that in the tenth generation in the city Camarina of
Babylonia, which some call the city Urie, and which signifies a city of
the Chaldæans, the thirteenth in descent lived Abraham, of a noble race,
and superior to all others in wisdom; of whom they relate that he was
the inventor of astrology and the Chaldæan magic, and that on account of
his eminent piety he was esteemed by God. It is further said, that under
the directions of God he removed and lived in Phœnicia, and there taught
the Phœnicians the motions of the sun and moon and all other things; for
which reason he was held in great reverence by their King.—*Euseb. Præp.
Evan.* 9.

### OF ABRAHAM: FROM NICOLAUS DAMASCENUS.

   A<span class="small">BRAM</span> was king of Damascus, and he came
thither as a stranger with an army from that part of the country which
is situated above Babylon of the Chaldæans: but after a short time he
again emigrated from this region with his people and transferred his
habitation to the land, which was then called Cananæa, but now Judæa,
together with all the multitude which had increased with him; of whose
history I shall give an account in another book. The name of Abram is
well-known even to this day in Damascus: and a village is pointed out
which is still called the House of Abram.—*Euseb. Præp. Evan.* 9.—*Jos.
Ant. Jud.* 1. 7.

   

### OF BELUS: FROM EUPOLEMUS.

   F<span class="small">OR</span> the Babylonians say that the first was
Belus, who is the same as Cronus. And from him descended Belus and
Chanaan; and this Chanaan was the father of the Phœnicians. Another of
his sons was Chum, who is called by the Greeks Asbolus, father of the
Ethiopians, and the father of Mestraim, the father of the Egyptians. The
Greeks say, moreover, that Atlas was the discoverer of astrology.—*Eus.
Pr. Ev.* lib. IX.

### FROM THALLUS.

   T<span class="small">HALLUS</span> makes mention of Belus, the king
of the Assyrians, and Cronus the Titan; and says that Belus, with the
Titans, made war against Zeus and his compeers, who are called Gods. He
says, moreover, that Gygus was smitten, and fled to Tartessus.

   According to the history of Thallus, Belus preceded the Trojan war
322 years.—*Theoph. ad Aut.* 281, 282.

### OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE: FROM CTESIAS.

   I<span class="small">N</span> like manner all the other kings
succeeded, the son receiving the empire from his father, being
altogether thirty in their generations to Sardanapalus. In his time the
empire passed to the Medes from the Assyrians, having remained with them
upwards of 1360<span id="fr_8"></span>[8](#note_8.md) years, according to
the account of Ctesias the Cnidian, in his second book.—*Diod. Sic.*
lib. II. p. 77.

### FROM DIODORUS SICULUS.

   I<span class="small">N</span> the manner above related, the empire of
the Assyrians, after having continued from Ninus thirty descents, and
more than 1400 years, was finally dissolved by the Medes.—*Diod. Sic.*
lib. II. p. 81.

### FROM HERODOTUS.

   T<span class="small">HE</span> Medes were the first who began the
revolt from the Assyrians after they had maintained the dominion over
Upper Asia for a period of 520 years.—*Lib*. I. c. 95.

### OF NABOPOLASAR: FROM ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR.<span id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9.md)

   N<span class="small">ABOPOLASAR</span>, whom Alexander Polyhistor
calls Sardanapallus, sent to Astyages the Satrap of Media, and demanded
his daughter Amuïtes in marriage for his son Nabuchodonosor. He was the
commander of the army of Saracus King of the Chaldæans, and, having been
sent upon some expedition, turned his arms against Saracus and marched
against the city of Ninus (Nineveh). But Saracus confounded by his
advance set fire to his palace and burnt himself in it. And Nabopolasar
obtained the empire of the Chaldæans: he was the father of
Nabuchodonosor.—*Euseb. Chron.* 46.

### OF THE CHALDÆAN AND ASSYRIAN KINGS: FROM ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR.

   I<span class="small">N</span> addition to the above Polyhistor
continues thus: After the deluge Evexius held possession of the country
of the Chaldæans during a period of four neri. And he was succeeded by
his son Comosbelus, who held the empire four neri and five sossi. But
from the time of Xisuthrus and the deluge, to that at which the Medes
took possession of Babylon, there were altogether eighty-six kings.
Polyhistor enumerates and mentions each of them by name from the volume
of Berossus: the duration of the reigns of all which kings comprehends a
period of thirty-three thousand and ninety-one years. But when their
power was thus firmly established, the Medes suddenly levied forces
against Babylon to surprise it, and to place upon the throne kings
chosen from among themselves.

   He then gives the names of the Median Kings, 8 in number, who reigned
during the period of 224 years: and again 11 Kings during . . . . years.
Then 49 Kings of the Chaldæans 458 years. Then 9 Kings of the Arabians
245 years. After all these successive periods of years he states that
Semiramis reigned over the Assyrians. And again minutely enumerates the
names of 45 Kings, assigning to them a term of 526 years. After whom, he
says there was a King of the Chaldæans, whose name was Phulus: Of whom
also the historical writings of the Hebrews make mention under the name
of Phulus (Pul) who they say invaded the country of the Jews.—*Eu. Ar.
Chron.* 39.

### OF SENECHERIB: FROM ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR.

   A<span class="small">FTER</span> the reign of the brother of
Senecherib, Acises reigned over the Babylonians, and when he had
governed for the space of thirty days, he was slain by Marodach
Baladanus, who held the empire by force during six months: and he was
slain and succeeded by a person named Elibus. But in the third year of
his reign Senecherib king of the Assyrians levied an army against the
Babylonians; and in a battle, in which they were engaged, routed, and
took him prisoner with his adherents, and commanded them to be carried
into the land of the Assyrians. Having taken upon himself the government
of the Babylonians, he appointed his son Asordanius their king, and he
himself retired again into Assyria.

   When he received a report that the Greeks had made a hostile descent
upon Cilicia, he marched against them and fought with them a pitched
battle, in which, though he suffered great loss in his own army, he
overthrew them, and upon the spot he erected the statue of himself as a
monument of his victory; and ordered his prowess to be inscribed upon it
in the Chaldæan characters, to hand down the remembrance of it to
posterity. He built also the city of Tarsus after the likeness of
Babylon, which he called Tharsis. And after enumerating the various
exploits of Sinnecherim, he adds that he reigned 18 years, and was cut
off by a conspiracy which had been formed against his life by his son
Ardumusanus.—*Eu. Ar. Chron.* 42.

### OF SENECHERIB AND HIS SUCESSORS: FROM ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR.

   A<span class="small">ND</span> after him (Pul) according to
Polyhistor, Senecherib was king.

   (The Chaldæan historian also makes mention of Senecherib himself, and
Asordanus his son, and Marodach Baladanus, as well as Nabuchodonosorus.)

   And Sinecherim reigned eighteen years; and after him his son eight
years. Then reigned Sammuges twenty-one years, and likewise his brother
twenty-one years. Then reigned Nabupalsar twenty years, and after him
Nabucodrossorus forty-three years. (Therefore, from Sinecherim to
Nabucodrossorus is comprehended a period altogether of eighty-eight
years.)

   After Samuges, Sardanapallus the Chaldæan, reigned twenty-one years.
He sent an army to the assistance of Astyages the Mede, Prince and
Satrap of the family, that he might give the Amuhean daughter of
Astyages to his son Nabucodrossorus. Then reigned Nabucodrossorus
forty-three years; and he came with a mighty army, and led the Jews, and
Phœnicians, and Syrians into captivity.

   And after Nabucodrorossus reigned his son Amilmarudochus, twelve
years. . . . And after him Neglisarus reigned over the Chaldæans four
years; and then Nabodenus seventeen years. In his reign Cyrus, the son
of Cambyses, invaded the country of the Babylonians. Nabodenus went out
to give him battle, but was defeated, and betook himself to flight: and
Cyrus reigned at Babylon nine years. He was killed, however, in another
battle, which took place in the plain of Daas. After him reigned
Cambyses eight years; then Darius thirty-six years; after him Xerxes and
the other kings of the Persian line.—*Eu. Ar. Chron.* pp. 41, 42. 44,
45.

### OF SENECHERIB AND HIS SUCCESSORS: FROM ABYDENUS.

   At the same time the twenty-fifth who was Senecherib can hardly be
recognized among the kings. It was he who subjected the city of Babylon
to his power, and defeated and sunk a Grecian fleet upon the coast of
Cilicia. He built also a temple at Athens and erected brazen statues,
upon which he engraved his own exploits. And he built the city of Tarsus
after the plan and likeness of Babylon, that the river Cydnus should
flow through Tarsus, in the same manner as the Euphrates intersected
Babylon.

   Next in order after him reigned Nergillus who was assassinated by his
son Adramelus: and he also was slain by Axerdis (his brother by the same
father, but of a different mother,) and his army pursued and blockaded
in the city of Byzantium. Axerdis was the first that levied mercenary
soldiers, one of whom was Pythagoras a follower of the wisdom of the
Chaldæans: he also reduced under his dominion Egypt and the country of
Cælo-Syria, whence came Sardanapallus.<span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](#note_10.md)

   After him Saracus reigned over the Assyrians, and when he was
informed that a very great multitude of barbarians had come up from the
sea to attack him, he sent Busalossorus as his general in haste to
Babylon. But he, having with a treasonable design obtained Amuhean, the
daughter of Astyages the prince of the Medes, to be affianced to his son
Nabuchodrossorus, marched straightways to surprise the city of Ninus,
that is Nineveh. But when Saracus the king was apprized of all these
proceedings he burnt the royal palace. And Nabuchodrossorus succeeded to
the empire and surrounded Babylon with a strong wall.—*Eu. Ar. Chron.*
53.

### OF BELUS AND THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE: FROM CASTOR.

   B<span class="small">ELUS</span> (says Castor) was king of the
Assyrians; and under him the Cyclops assisted Jupiter with thunder-bolts
and lightnings in his contest with the Titans. At that time there were
kings of the Titans, one of whom was Ogygus. (After a short digression
he proceeds to say, that) the Giants, in their attempted inroad upon the
Gods, were slain by the assistance of Hercules and Dionysus, who were
themselves of the Titan race.

   Belus, whom we have mentioned above, after his death was esteemed a
God. After him, Ninus reigned over the Assyrians fifty-two years. He
married Semiramis, who, after his decease, reigned over the Assyrians
forty-two years. Then reigned Zames, who is Ninyas. (Then he enumerates
each of the successive Assyrian kings in order, and mentions them all,
down to Sardanapallus, by their respective names: whose names, and the
length of their reigns, we shall also give presently. Castor mentions
them in his canon in the following words.)

   We have first digested into a canon the kings of the Assyrians,
commencing with Belus: but since we have no certain tradition respecting
the length of his reign, we have merely set down his name, and commenced
the chronological series from Ninus; and have concluded it with another
Ninus, who obtained the empire after Sardanapallus; that in this manner
the whole length of the time, as well as of the reigns of each king,
might be plainly set forth. Thus it will be found, that the complete sum
of the years amounts to 1280.—*Eus. Ar.* p. 81.

### OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE: FROM VELLEIUS AND AEMILIUS SURA.

   T<span class="small">HE</span> Asiatic empire was subsequently
transferred from the Assyrians, who had held it 1070 years, to the
Medes, from this time, for a period of 870 years. For Sardanapalus, the
king of the Assyrians, a man wallowing in luxury, being the thirty-third
from Ninus and Semiramis, the founders of Babylon, from whom the kingdom
had passed in a regular descent from father to son, was deprived of his
empire, and put to death by Arbaces the Mede. . . . . Æmilius Sura also,
in his annals of the Roman people, says, "That the Assyrian princes
extended their empire over all nations. They were succeeded by the
Medes, then by the Persians, then by the Macedonians and shortly
afterwards by two kings Philip and Antiochus, of Macedonian origin, who,
not long after the destruction of Carthage, were conquered by the
Romans, who then obtained the empire of the world. To this time, from
the beginning of the reign of Ninus, king of the Assyrians, who first
obtained the empire, there has elapsed a period of 1995 years."—*Hist.
I.* c. 6.

### OF THE CHALDÆAN OBSERVATIONS: FROM PLINIUS.

   A<span class="small">NTICLIDES</span> relates that they (letters)
were invented in Egypt by a person whose name was Menon, fifteen years
before Phoroneus the most ancient king of Greece: and he endeavours to
prove it by the monuments. On the contrary, Epigenes, a writer of
first-rate authority, informs us, that among the Babylonians were
preserved observations of the stars, inscribed upon baked tiles,
extending to a period of 720 years. Berosus and Critodemus, who are the
most moderate in their calculations, nevertheless extend the period of
the observations to 480 years. Whence may be inferred the eternal use of
letters among them.—Lib. VII. c. 56.

### FROM CICERO.

   We must also contemn the Babylonians, and those who, in the reigion
of Caucasus, pretend to have observed the heavens and courses of the
stars: we must condemn them, I say, of folly, or of vanity, or of
impudence, who assert that they have preserved upon monuments
observations extending back during an interval of 470,000 years.—*De
Divin.*

antiquity of that part which I have laid before the reader, is plain
from its being mentioned by Josephus. Some lines are likewise quoted by
Athenagoras, and Theophilus Antiochenus. But there are passages

(potestatem) of Axerdis, "from which Sardanapallus revolted."
