<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">BOOK VII</H1>
<P>And thou, O matron of immortal fame,<BR>
Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name;<BR>
Cajeta still the place is call'd from thee,<BR>
The nurse of great Aeneas' infancy.<BR>
Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia's plains;<BR>
Thy name ('t is all a ghost can have) remains.</P>
<P>Now, when the prince her fun'ral rites had paid,<BR>
He plow'd the Tyrrhene seas with sails display'd.<BR>
From land a gentle breeze arose by night,<BR>
Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright,<BR>
And the sea trembled with her silver light.<BR>
Now near the shelves of Circe's shores they run,<BR>
(Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,)<BR>
A dang'rous coast: the goddess wastes her days<BR>
In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays:<BR>
In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night,<BR>
And cedar brands supply her father's light.<BR>
From hence were heard, rebellowing to the main,<BR>
The roars of lions that refuse the chain,<BR>
The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears,<BR>
And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.<BR>
These from their caverns, at the close of night,<BR>
Fill the sad isle with horror and affright.<BR>
Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r,<BR>
(That watch'd the moon and planetary hour,)<BR>
With words and wicked herbs from humankind<BR>
Had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd.<BR>
Which monsters lest the Trojans' pious host<BR>
Should bear, or touch upon th' inchanted coast,<BR>
Propitious Neptune steer'd their course by night<BR>
With rising gales that sped their happy flight.<BR>
Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore,<BR>
And hear the swelling surges vainly roar.<BR>
Now, when the rosy morn began to rise,<BR>
And wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies;<BR>
When Thetis blush'd in purple not her own,<BR>
And from her face the breathing winds were blown,<BR>
A sudden silence sate upon the sea,<BR>
And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way.<BR>
The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood,<BR>
Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood:<BR>
Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course,<BR>
With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force,<BR>
That drove the sand along, he took his way,<BR>
And roll'd his yellow billows to the sea.<BR>
About him, and above, and round the wood,<BR>
The birds that haunt the borders of his flood,<BR>
That bath'd within, or basked upon his side,<BR>
To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied.<BR>
The captain gives command; the joyful train<BR>
Glide thro' the gloomy shade, and leave the main.</P>
<P>Now, Erato, thy poet's mind inspire,<BR>
And fill his soul with thy celestial fire!<BR>
Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings;<BR>
Declare the past and state of things,<BR>
When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought,<BR>
And how the rivals lov'd, and how they fought.<BR>
These are my theme, and how the war began,<BR>
And how concluded by the godlike man:<BR>
For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage,<BR>
Which princes and their people did engage;<BR>
And haughty souls, that, mov'd with mutual hate,<BR>
In fighting fields pursued and found their fate;<BR>
That rous'd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms,<BR>
And peaceful Italy involv'd in arms.<BR>
A larger scene of action is display'd;<BR>
And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh'd.</P>
<P>Latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd<BR>
The Latin scepter, and his people blest:<BR>
His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame<BR>
His mother; fair Marica was her name.<BR>
But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew<BR>
His birth from Saturn, if records be true.<BR>
Thus King Latinus, in the third degree,<BR>
Had Saturn author of his family.<BR>
But this old peaceful prince, as Heav'n decreed,<BR>
Was blest with no male issue to succeed:<BR>
His sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;<BR>
One only daughter heir'd the royal state.<BR>
Fir'd with her love, and with ambition led,<BR>
The neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed.<BR>
Among the crowd, but far above the rest,<BR>
Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address'd.<BR>
Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,<BR>
Was first, and favor'd by the Latian queen;<BR>
With him she strove to join Lavinia's hand,<BR>
But dire portents the purpos'd match withstand.</P>
<P>Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood<BR>
A laurel's trunk, a venerable wood;<BR>
Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair<BR>
Was kept and cut with superstitious care.<BR>
This plant Latinus, when his town he wall'd,<BR>
Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call'd;<BR>
And last, in honor of his new abode,<BR>
He vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god.<BR>
It happen'd once (a boding prodigy!)<BR>
A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,<BR>
(Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,)<BR>
Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;<BR>
There with their clasping feet together clung,<BR>
And a long cluster from the laurel hung.<BR>
An ancient augur prophesied from hence:<BR>
"Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince!<BR>
From the same parts of heav'n his navy stands,<BR>
To the same parts on earth; his army lands;<BR>
The town he conquers, and the tow'r commands."</P>
<P>Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire<BR>
Before the gods, and stood beside her sire,<BR>
(Strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke<BR>
Of incense, from the sacred altar broke,<BR>
Caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire;<BR>
Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire:<BR>
From thence the fuming trail began to spread<BR>
And lambent glories danc'd about her head.<BR>
This new portent the seer with wonder views,<BR>
Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:<BR>
"The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,<BR>
Shall shine with honor, shall herself be crown'd;<BR>
But, caus'd by her irrevocable fate,<BR>
War shall the country waste, and change the state."</P>
<P>Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,<BR>
For counsel to his father Faunus went,<BR>
And sought the shades renown'd for prophecy<BR>
Which near Albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie.<BR>
To these the Latian and the Sabine land<BR>
Fly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand.<BR>
The priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease,<BR>
And nightly visions in his slumber sees;<BR>
A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears,<BR>
And, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears:<BR>
These he consults, the future fates to know,<BR>
From pow'rs above, and from the fiends below.<BR>
Here, for the gods' advice, Latinus flies,<BR>
Off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice:<BR>
Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd,<BR>
He laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd.<BR>
No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound,<BR>
When, from above, a more than mortal sound<BR>
Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:<BR>
"Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke<BR>
Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke.<BR>
A foreign son upon thy shore descends,<BR>
Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends.<BR>
His race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd,<BR>
Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound:<BR>
'T is theirs whate'er the sun surveys around."<BR>
These answers, in the silent night receiv'd,<BR>
The king himself divulg'd, the land believ'd:<BR>
The fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew,<BR>
When now the Trojan navy was in view.</P>
<P>Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread<BR>
His table on the turf, with cakes of bread;<BR>
And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed.<BR>
They sate; and, (not without the god's command,)<BR>
Their homely fare dispatch'd, the hungry band<BR>
Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour,<BR>
To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour.<BR>
Ascanius this observ'd, and smiling said:<BR>
"See, we devour the plates on which we fed."<BR>
The speech had omen, that the Trojan race<BR>
Should find repose, and this the time and place.<BR>
Aeneas took the word, and thus replies,<BR>
Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes:<BR>
"All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods!<BR>
Behold the destin'd place of your abodes!<BR>
For thus Anchises prophesied of old,<BR>
And this our fatal place of rest foretold:<BR>
'When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat,<BR>
By famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat,<BR>
Then ease your weary Trojans will attend,<BR>
And the long labors of your voyage end.<BR>
Remember on that happy coast to build,<BR>
And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.'<BR>
This was that famine, this the fatal place<BR>
Which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race.<BR>
Then, on to-morrow's dawn, your care employ,<BR>
To search the land, and where the cities lie,<BR>
And what the men; but give this day to joy.<BR>
Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest,<BR>
Call great Anchises to the genial feast:<BR>
Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught;<BR>
Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought."</P>
<P>Thus having said, the hero bound his brows<BR>
With leafy branches, then perform'd his vows;<BR>
Adoring first the genius of the place,<BR>
Then Earth, the mother of the heav'nly race,<BR>
The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown,<BR>
And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne,<BR>
And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove,<BR>
And last his sire below, and mother queen above.<BR>
Then heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud,<BR>
And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud.<BR>
Soon thro' the joyful camp a rumor flew,<BR>
The time was come their city to renew.<BR>
Then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd,<BR>
The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round.</P>
<P>When next the rosy morn disclos'd the day,<BR>
The scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way,<BR>
To learn the natives' names, their towns explore,<BR>
The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore:<BR>
Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands;<BR>
Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands.<BR>
The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways<BR>
To found his empire, and his town to raise,<BR>
A hundred youths from all his train selects,<BR>
And to the Latian court their course directs,<BR>
(The spacious palace where their prince resides,)<BR>
And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides.<BR>
They go commission'd to require a peace,<BR>
And carry presents to procure access.<BR>
Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs<BR>
His new-elected seat, and draws the lines.<BR>
The Trojans round the place a rampire cast,<BR>
And palisades about the trenches plac'd.</P>
<P>Meantime the train, proceeding on their way,<BR>
From far the town and lofty tow'rs survey;<BR>
At length approach the walls. Without the gate,<BR>
They see the boys and Latian youth debate<BR>
The martial prizes on the dusty plain:<BR>
Some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein;<BR>
Some bend the stubborn bow for victory,<BR>
And some with darts their active sinews try.<BR>
A posting messenger, dispatch'd from hence,<BR>
Of this fair troop advis'd their aged prince,<BR>
That foreign men of mighty stature came;<BR>
Uncouth their habit, and unknown their name.<BR>
The king ordains their entrance, and ascends<BR>
His regal seat, surrounded by his friends.</P>
<P>The palace built by Picus, vast and proud,<BR>
Supported by a hundred pillars stood,<BR>
And round incompass'd with a rising wood.<BR>
The pile o'erlook'd the town, and drew the sight;<BR>
Surpris'd at once with reverence and delight.<BR>
There kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r;<BR>
In state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore<BR>
Their awful axes and the rods before.<BR>
Here the tribunal stood, the house of pray'r,<BR>
And here the sacred senators repair;<BR>
All at large tables, in long order set,<BR>
A ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat.<BR>
Above the portal, carv'd in cedar wood,<BR>
Plac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood;<BR>
Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high;<BR>
And Italus, that led the colony;<BR>
And ancient Janus, with his double face,<BR>
And bunch of keys, the porter of the place.<BR>
There good Sabinus, planter of the vines,<BR>
On a short pruning hook his head reclines,<BR>
And studiously surveys his gen'rous wines;<BR>
Then warlike kings, who for their country fought,<BR>
And honorable wounds from battle brought.<BR>
Around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears,<BR>
And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars,<BR>
And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars.<BR>
Above the rest, as chief of all the band,<BR>
Was Picus plac'd, a buckler in his hand;<BR>
His other wav'd a long divining wand.<BR>
Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate,<BR>
Yet could not with his art avoid his fate:<BR>
For Circe long had lov'd the youth in vain,<BR>
Till love, refus'd, converted to disdain:<BR>
Then, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art,<BR>
She chang'd his form, who could not change his heart;<BR>
Constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly,<BR>
With party-color'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie.</P>
<P>In this high temple, on a chair of state,<BR>
The seat of audience, old Latinus sate;<BR>
Then gave admission to the Trojan train;<BR>
And thus with pleasing accents he began:<BR>
"Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own,<BR>
Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown-<BR>
Say what you seek, and whither were you bound:<BR>
Were you by stress of weather cast aground?<BR>
(Such dangers as on seas are often seen,<BR>
And oft befall to miserable men,)<BR>
Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay,<BR>
Spent and disabled in so long a way?<BR>
Say what you want: the Latians you shall find<BR>
Not forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd;<BR>
For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign,<BR>
His hospitable customs we retain.<BR>
I call to mind (but time the tale has worn)<BR>
Th' Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho' born<BR>
On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore,<BR>
And Samothracia, Samos call'd before.<BR>
From Tuscan Coritum he claim'd his birth;<BR>
But after, when exempt from mortal earth,<BR>
From thence ascended to his kindred skies,<BR>
A god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice,"</P>
<P>He said. Ilioneus made this reply:<BR>
"O king, of Faunus' royal family!<BR>
Nor wintry winds to Latium forc'd our way,<BR>
Nor did the stars our wand'ring course betray.<BR>
Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound,<BR>
The port, so long desir'd, at length we found;<BR>
From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd;<BR>
Great as the greatest that the sun beheld.<BR>
The god began our line, who rules above;<BR>
And, as our race, our king descends from Jove:<BR>
And hither are we come, by his command,<BR>
To crave admission in your happy land.<BR>
How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour'd,<BR>
Our plains, our temples, and our town devour'd;<BR>
What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms<BR>
Shook Asia's crown with European arms;<BR>
Ev'n such have heard, if any such there be,<BR>
Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea;<BR>
And such as, born beneath the burning sky<BR>
And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie.<BR>
From that dire deluge, thro' the wat'ry waste,<BR>
Such length of years, such various perils past,<BR>
At last escap'd, to Latium we repair,<BR>
To beg what you without your want may spare:<BR>
The common water, and the common air;<BR>
Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes,<BR>
Fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods.<BR>
Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace,<BR>
Nor length of time our gratitude efface.<BR>
Besides, what endless honor you shall gain,<BR>
To save and shelter Troy's unhappy train!<BR>
Now, by my sov'reign, and his fate, I swear,<BR>
Renown'd for faith in peace, for force in war;<BR>
Oft our alliance other lands desir'd,<BR>
And, what we seek of you, of us requir'd.<BR>
Despite not then, that in our hands we bear<BR>
These holy boughs, sue with words of pray'r.<BR>
Fate and the gods, by their supreme command,<BR>
Have doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land.<BR>
To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends;<BR>
Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends;<BR>
Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force,<BR>
And where Numicus opes his holy source.<BR>
Besides, our prince presents, with his request,<BR>
Some small remains of what his sire possess'd.<BR>
This golden charger, snatch'd from burning Troy,<BR>
Anchises did in sacrifice employ;<BR>
This royal robe and this tiara wore<BR>
Old Priam, and this golden scepter bore<BR>
In full assemblies, and in solemn games;<BR>
These purple vests were weav'd by Dardan dames."</P>
<P>Thus while he spoke, Latinus roll'd around<BR>
His eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground.<BR>
Intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;<BR>
Not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,<BR>
But pond'ring future things of wondrous weight;<BR>
Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.<BR>
On these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind,<BR>
And then revolv'd what Faunus had divin'd.<BR>
This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed<BR>
To share his scepter, and Lavinia's bed;<BR>
This was the race that sure portents foreshew<BR>
To sway the world, and land and sea subdue.<BR>
At length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke:<BR>
"The pow'rs," said he, "the pow'rs we both invoke,<BR>
To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be,<BR>
And firm our purpose with their augury!<BR>
Have what you ask; your presents I receive;<BR>
Land, where and when you please, with ample leave;<BR>
Partake and use my kingdom as your own;<BR>
All shall be yours, while I command the crown:<BR>
And, if my wish'd alliance please your king,<BR>
Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring.<BR>
Then let him not a friend's embraces fear;<BR>
The peace is made when I behold him here.<BR>
Besides this answer, tell my royal guest,<BR>
I add to his commands my own request:<BR>
One only daughter heirs my crown and state,<BR>
Whom not our oracles, nor Heav'n, nor fate,<BR>
Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join<BR>
With any native of th' Ausonian line.<BR>
A foreign son-in-law shall come from far<BR>
(Such is our doom), a chief renown'd in war,<BR>
Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name,<BR>
And thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame.<BR>
Himself to be the man the fates require,<BR>
I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire."</P>
<P>He said, and then on each bestow'd a steed.<BR>
Three hundred horses, in high stables fed,<BR>
Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd:<BR>
Of these he chose the fairest and the best,<BR>
To mount the Trojan troop. At his command<BR>
The steeds caparison'd with purple stand,<BR>
With golden trappings, glorious to behold,<BR>
And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold.<BR>
Then to his absent guest the king decreed<BR>
A pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed,<BR>
Who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire;<BR>
Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire,<BR>
By substituting mares produc'd on earth,<BR>
Whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth.<BR>
These draw the chariot which Latinus sends,<BR>
And the rich present to the prince commends.<BR>
Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne,<BR>
To their expecting lord with peace return.</P>
<P>But jealous Juno, from Pachynus' height,<BR>
As she from Argos took her airy flight,<BR>
Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight.<BR>
She saw the Trojan and his joyful train<BR>
Descend upon the shore, desert the main,<BR>
Design a town, and, with unhop'd success,<BR>
Th' embassadors return with promis'd peace.<BR>
Then, pierc'd with pain, she shook her haughty head,<BR>
Sigh'd from her inward soul, and thus she said:<BR>
"O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes!<BR>
O fates of Troy, which Juno's fates oppose!<BR>
Could they not fall unpitied on the plain,<BR>
But slain revive, and, taken, scape again?<BR>
When execrable Troy in ashes lay,<BR>
Thro' fires and swords and seas they forc'd their way.<BR>
Then vanquish'd Juno must in vain contend,<BR>
Her rage disarm'd, her empire at an end.<BR>
Breathless and tir'd, is all my fury spent?<BR>
Or does my glutted spleen at length relent?<BR>
As if 't were little from their town to chase,<BR>
I thro' the seas pursued their exil'd race;<BR>
Ingag'd the heav'ns, oppos'd the stormy main;<BR>
But billows roar'd, and tempests rag'd in vain.<BR>
What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done,<BR>
When these they overpass, and those they shun?<BR>
On Tiber's shores they land, secure of fate,<BR>
Triumphant o'er the storms and Juno's hate.<BR>
Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe,<BR>
And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia's wrath,<BR>
Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon;<BR>
(What great offense had either people done?)<BR>
But I, the consort of the Thunderer,<BR>
Have wag'd a long and unsuccessful war,<BR>
With various arts and arms in vain have toil'd,<BR>
And by a mortal man at length am foil'd.<BR>
If native pow'r prevail not, shall I doubt<BR>
To seek for needful succor from without?<BR>
If Jove and Heav'n my just desires deny,<BR>
Hell shall the pow'r of Heav'n and Jove supply.<BR>
Grant that the Fates have firm'd, by their decree,<BR>
The Trojan race to reign in Italy;<BR>
At least I can defer the nuptial day,<BR>
And with protracted wars the peace delay:<BR>
With blood the dear alliance shall be bought,<BR>
And both the people near destruction brought;<BR>
So shall the son-in-law and father join,<BR>
With ruin, war, and waste of either line.<BR>
O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow'd<BR>
With Phrygian, Latian, andRutulian blood!<BR>
Bellona leads thee to thy lover's hand;<BR>
Another queen brings forth another brand,<BR>
To burn with foreign fires another land!<BR>
A second Paris, diff'ring but in name,<BR>
Shall fire his country with a second flame."</P>
<P>Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground,<BR>
With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound,<BR>
To rouse Alecto from th' infernal seat<BR>
Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat.<BR>
This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose;<BR>
One who delights in wars and human woes.<BR>
Ev'n Pluto hates his own misshapen race;<BR>
Her sister Furies fly her hideous face;<BR>
So frightful are the forms the monster takes,<BR>
So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes.<BR>
Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite:<BR>
"O virgin daughter of eternal Night,<BR>
Give me this once thy labor, to sustain<BR>
My right, and execute my just disdain.<BR>
Let not the Trojans, with a feign'd pretense<BR>
Of proffer'd peace, delude the Latian prince.<BR>
Expel from Italy that odious name,<BR>
And let not Juno suffer in her fame.<BR>
'T is thine to ruin realms, o'erturn a state,<BR>
Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate,<BR>
And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate.<BR>
Thy hand o'er towns the fun'ral torch displays,<BR>
And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways.<BR>
Now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds<BR>
Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds:<BR>
Confound the peace establish'd, and prepare<BR>
Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war."</P>
<P>Smear'd as she was with black Gorgonian blood,<BR>
The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood;<BR>
And on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night,<BR>
She to the Latian palace took her flight:<BR>
There sought the queen's apartment, stood before<BR>
The peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the door.<BR>
Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast<BR>
Fir'd with disdain for Turnus dispossess'd,<BR>
And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest.<BR>
From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes<BR>
Her darling plague, the fav'rite of her snakes;<BR>
With her full force she threw the poisonous dart,<BR>
And fix'd it deep within Amata's heart,<BR>
That, thus envenom'd, she might kindle rage,<BR>
And sacrifice to strife her house husband's age.<BR>
Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims<BR>
Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs;<BR>
His baleful breath inspiring, as he glides,<BR>
Now like a chain around her neck he rides,<BR>
Now like a fillet to her head repairs,<BR>
And with his circling volumes folds her hairs.<BR>
At first the silent venom slid with ease,<BR>
And seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees;<BR>
Then, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far,<BR>
In plaintive accents she began the war,<BR>
And thus bespoke her husband: "Shall," she said,<BR>
"A wand'ring prince enjoy Lavinia's bed?<BR>
If nature plead not in a parent's heart,<BR>
Pity my tears, and pity her desert.<BR>
I know, my dearest lord, the time will come,<BR>
You in vain, reverse your cruel doom;<BR>
The faithless pirate soon will set to sea,<BR>
And bear the royal virgin far away!<BR>
A guest like him, a Trojan guest before,<BR>
In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore,<BR>
And ravish'd Helen from her husband bore.<BR>
Think on a king's inviolable word;<BR>
And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord:<BR>
To this false foreigner you give your throne,<BR>
And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son.<BR>
Resume your ancient care; and, if the god<BR>
Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood,<BR>
Know all are foreign, in a larger sense,<BR>
Not born your subjects, or deriv'd from hence.<BR>
Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace,<BR>
He springs from Inachus of Argive race."</P>
<P>But when she saw her reasons idly spent,<BR>
And could not move him from his fix'd intent,<BR>
She flew to rage; for now the snake possess'd<BR>
Her vital parts, and poison'd all her breast;<BR>
She raves, she runs with a distracted pace,<BR>
And fills with horrid howls the public place.<BR>
And, as young striplings whip the top for sport,<BR>
On the smooth pavement of an empty court;<BR>
The wooden engine flies and whirls about,<BR>
Admir'd, with clamors, of the beardless rout;<BR>
They lash aloud; each other they provoke,<BR>
And lend their little souls at ev'ry stroke:<BR>
Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows<BR>
Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes.<BR>
Nor yet content, she strains her malice more,<BR>
And adds new ills to those contriv'd before:<BR>
She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng<BR>
Of madding matrons, bears the bride along,<BR>
Wand'ring thro' woods and wilds, and devious ways,<BR>
And with these arts the Trojan match delays.<BR>
She feign'd the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud,<BR>
And to the buxom god the virgin vow'd.<BR>
"Evoe! O Bacchus!" thus began the song;<BR>
And "Evoe!" answer'd all the female throng.<BR>
"O virgin! worthy thee alone!" she cried;<BR>
"O worthy thee alone!" the crew replied.<BR>
"For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance,<BR>
And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance."<BR>
Like fury seiz'd the rest; the progress known,<BR>
All seek the mountains, and forsake the town:<BR>
All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear,<BR>
Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair,<BR>
And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air.<BR>
The queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine,<BR>
Shook high above her head a flaming pine;<BR>
Then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng,<BR>
And sung, in Turnus' name, the nuptial song:<BR>
"Io, ye Latian dames! if any here<BR>
Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear;<BR>
If there be here," she said, who dare maintain<BR>
My right, nor think the name of mother vain;<BR>
Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair,<BR>
And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare."</P>
<P>Amata's breast the Fury thus invades,<BR>
And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades;<BR>
Then, when she found her venom spread so far,<BR>
The royal house embroil'd in civil war,<BR>
Rais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies,<BR>
And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies.<BR>
His town, as fame reports, was built of old<BR>
By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold,<BR>
Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train<BR>
Of following Argives, thro' the stormy main,<BR>
Driv'n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign.<BR>
'T was Ardua once; now Ardea's name it bears;<BR>
Once a fair city, now consum'd with years.<BR>
Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay,<BR>
Betwixt the confines of the night and day,<BR>
Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside<BR>
Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried<BR>
The foulness of th' infernal form to hide.<BR>
Propp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien:<BR>
Her face is furrow'd, and her front obscene;<BR>
Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;<BR>
Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;<BR>
Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,<BR>
Her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd.<BR>
Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane<BR>
Of Juno, now she seem'd, and thus began,<BR>
Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:<BR>
"Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain<BR>
In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?<BR>
Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,<BR>
Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?<BR>
The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought,<BR>
The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought.<BR>
Go now, deluded man, and seek again<BR>
New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain.<BR>
Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize;<BR>
Protect the Latians in luxurious ease.<BR>
This dream all-pow'rful Juno sends; I bear<BR>
Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear.<BR>
Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain;<BR>
With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train:<BR>
Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie<BR>
In Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy.<BR>
The Latian king, unless he shall submit,<BR>
Own his old promise, and his new forget-<BR>
Let him, in arms, the pow'r of Turnus prove,<BR>
And learn to fear whom he disdains to love.<BR>
For such is Heav'n's command." The youthful prince<BR>
With scorn replied, and made this bold defense:<BR>
"You tell me, mother, what I knew before:<BR>
The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore.<BR>
I neither fear nor will provoke the war;<BR>
My fate is Juno's most peculiar care.<BR>
But time has made you dote, and vainly tell<BR>
Of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell.<BR>
Go; be the temple and the gods your care;<BR>
Permit to men the thought of peace and war."</P>
<P>These haughty words Alecto's rage provoke,<BR>
And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke.<BR>
Her eyes grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur burn;<BR>
Her hideous looks and hellish form return;<BR>
Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place,<BR>
And open all the furies of her face:<BR>
Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,<BR>
She cast him backward as he strove to rise,<BR>
And, ling'ring, sought to frame some new replies.<BR>
High on her head she rears two twisted snakes,<BR>
Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;<BR>
And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks:<BR>
"Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell<BR>
Of arms imagin'd in her lonely cell!<BR>
Behold the Fates' infernal minister!<BR>
War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear."</P>
<P>Thus having said, her smold'ring torch, impress'd<BR>
With her full force, she plung'd into his breast.<BR>
Aghast he wak'd; and, starting from his bed,<BR>
Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread.<BR>
"Arms! arms!" he cries: "my sword and shield prepare!"<BR>
He breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war.<BR>
So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries,<BR>
The bubbling waters from the bottom rise:<BR>
Above the brims they force their fiery way;<BR>
Black vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day.</P>
<P>The peace polluted thus, a chosen band<BR>
He first commissions to the Latian land,<BR>
In threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest,<BR>
To meet in arms th' intruding Trojan guest,<BR>
To force the foes from the Lavinian shore,<BR>
And Italy's indanger'd peace restore.<BR>
Himself alone an equal match he boasts,<BR>
To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts.<BR>
The gods invok'd, the Rutuli prepare<BR>
Their arms, and warn each other to the war.<BR>
His beauty these, and those his blooming age,<BR>
The rest his house and his own fame ingage.</P>
<P>While Turnus urges thus his enterprise,<BR>
The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies;<BR>
New frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand,<BR>
Which overlooks the vale with wide command;<BR>
Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train,<BR>
With horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain,<BR>
And pitch their toils around the shady plain.<BR>
The Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent,<BR>
And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent.<BR>
'Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise<BR>
High o'er his front; his beams invade the skies.<BR>
From this light cause th' infernal maid prepares<BR>
The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars.</P>
<P>The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred,<BR>
Snatch'd from his dams, and the tame youngling fed.<BR>
Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring,<BR>
Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king:<BR>
Their sister Silvia cherish'd with her care<BR>
The little wanton, and did wreaths prepare<BR>
To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied<BR>
His tender neck, and comb'd his silken hide,<BR>
And bathed his body. Patient of command<BR>
In time he grew, and, growing us'd to hand,<BR>
He waited at his master's board for food;<BR>
Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood,<BR>
Where grazing all the day, at night he came<BR>
To his known lodgings, and his country dame.</P>
<P>This household beast, that us'd the woodland grounds,<BR>
Was view'd at first by the young hero's hounds,<BR>
As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat<BR>
In the cool waters, and to quench his heat.<BR>
Ascanius young, and eager of his game,<BR>
Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim;<BR>
But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides,<BR>
Which pierc'd his bowels thro' his panting sides.<BR>
The bleeding creature issues from the floods,<BR>
Possess'd with fear, and seeks his known abodes,<BR>
His old familiar hearth and household gods.<BR>
He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans,<BR>
Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans.<BR>
Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud<BR>
For succor from the clownish neighborhood:<BR>
The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay<BR>
In the close woody covert, urg'd their way.<BR>
One with a brand yet burning from the flame,<BR>
Arm'd with a knotty club another came:<BR>
Whate'er they catch or find, without their care,<BR>
Their fury makes an instrument of war.<BR>
Tyrrheus, the foster father of the beast,<BR>
Then clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist,<BR>
But held his hand from the descending stroke,<BR>
And left his wedge within the cloven oak,<BR>
To whet their courage and their rage provoke.<BR>
And now the goddess, exercis'd in ill,<BR>
Who watch'd an hour to work her impious will,<BR>
Ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn,<BR>
Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne,<BR>
Adds all her breath: the rocks and woods around,<BR>
And mountains, tremble at th' infernal sound.<BR>
The sacred lake of Trivia from afar,<BR>
The Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar,<BR>
Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war.<BR>
Young mothers wildly stare, with fear possess'd,<BR>
And strain their helpless infants to their breast.</P>
<P>The clowns, a boist'rous, rude, ungovern'd crew,<BR>
With furious haste to the loud summons flew.<BR>
The pow'rs of Troy, then issuing on the plain,<BR>
With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain:<BR>
Not theirs a raw and unexperienc'd train,<BR>
But a firm body of embattled men.<BR>
At first, while fortune favor'd neither side,<BR>
The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried;<BR>
But now, both parties reinforc'd, the fields<BR>
Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields.<BR>
A shining harvest either host displays,<BR>
And shoots against the sun with equal rays.<BR>
Thus, when a black-brow'd gust begins to rise,<BR>
White foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries;<BR>
Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies;<BR>
Till, by the fury of the storm full blown,<BR>
The muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown.<BR>
First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest care,<BR>
Pierc'd with an arrow from the distant war:<BR>
Fix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood,<BR>
And stopp'd his breath, and drank his vital blood<BR>
Huge heaps of slain around the body rise:<BR>
Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies;<BR>
A good old man, while peace he preach'd in vain,<BR>
Amidst the madness of th' unruly train:<BR>
Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill'd;<BR>
His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd.</P>
<P>Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood<BR>
The Fury bath'd them in each other's blood;<BR>
Then, having fix'd the fight, exulting flies,<BR>
And bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies.<BR>
To Juno thus she speaks: "Behold! It is done,<BR>
The blood already drawn, the war begun;<BR>
The discord is complete; nor can they cease<BR>
The dire debate, nor you command the peace.<BR>
Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood<BR>
Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood;<BR>
Speak, and my pow'r shall add this office more:<BR>
The neighb'ing nations of th' Ausonian shore<BR>
Shall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar,<BR>
Of arm'd invasion, and embrace the war."<BR>
Then Juno thus: "The grateful work is done,<BR>
The seeds of discord sow'd, the war begun;<BR>
Frauds, fears, and fury have possess'd the state,<BR>
And fix'd the causes of a lasting hate.<BR>
A bloody Hymen shall th' alliance join<BR>
Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line:<BR>
But thou with speed to night and hell repair;<BR>
For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear<BR>
Thy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air.<BR>
Leave what remains to me." Saturnia said:<BR>
The sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd,<BR>
Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade.</P>
<P>In midst of Italy, well known to fame,<BR>
There lies a lake (Amsanctus is the name)<BR>
Below the lofty mounts: on either side<BR>
Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide.<BR>
Full in the center of the sacred wood<BR>
An arm arises of the Stygian flood,<BR>
Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound,<BR>
Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around.<BR>
Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell,<BR>
And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell.<BR>
To this infernal lake the Fury flies;<BR>
Here hides her hated head, and frees the lab'ring skies.</P>
<P>Saturnian Juno now, with double care,<BR>
Attends the fatal process of the war.<BR>
The clowns, return'd, from battle bear the slain,<BR>
Implore the gods, and to their king complain.<BR>
The corps of Almon and the rest are shown;<BR>
Shrieks, clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town.<BR>
Ambitious Turnus in the press appears,<BR>
And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears;<BR>
Proclaims his private injuries aloud,<BR>
A solemn promise made, and disavow'd;<BR>
A foreign son is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood.<BR>
Then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear,<BR>
In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear,<BR>
And lead his dances with dishevel'd hair,<BR>
Increase the clamor, and the war demand,<BR>
(Such was Amata's interest in the land,)<BR>
Against the public sanctions of the peace,<BR>
Against all omens of their ill success.<BR>
With fates averse, the rout in arms resort,<BR>
To force their monarch, and insult the court.<BR>
But, like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves<BR>
The raging tempest and the rising waves-<BR>
Propp'd on himself he stands; his solid sides<BR>
Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides-<BR>
So stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long<BR>
Sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng.<BR>
But, when he found that Juno's pow'r prevail'd,<BR>
And all the methods of cool counsel fail'd,<BR>
He calls the gods to witness their offense,<BR>
Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence.<BR>
"Hurried by fate," he cries, "and borne before<BR>
A furious wind, we have the faithful shore.<BR>
O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear<BR>
The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war:<BR>
Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate,<BR>
And pray to Heav'n for peace, but pray too late.<BR>
For me, my stormy voyage at an end,<BR>
I to the port of death securely tend.<BR>
The fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay,<BR>
Is all I want, and all you take away."<BR>
He said no more, but, in his walls confin'd,<BR>
Shut out the woes which he too well divin'd<BR>
Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive,<BR>
But left the helm, and let the vessel drive.</P>
<P>A solemn custom was observ'd of old,<BR>
Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold,<BR>
Their standard when in fighting fields they rear<BR>
Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare<BR>
The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war;<BR>
Or from the boasting Parthians would regain<BR>
Their eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain.<BR>
Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear,<BR>
And still are worship'd with religious fear)<BR>
Before his temple stand: the dire abode,<BR>
And the fear'd issues of the furious god,<BR>
Are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates,<BR>
The wary guardian Janus doubly waits.<BR>
Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars,<BR>
The Roman consul their decree declares,<BR>
And in his robes the sounding gates unbars.<BR>
The youth in military shouts arise,<BR>
And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies.<BR>
These rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd,<BR>
Were the king's office; but the king refus'd,<BR>
Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar<BR>
Of sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war;<BR>
But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms,<BR>
Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms.<BR>
Then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high:<BR>
At her approach the brazen hinges fly;<BR>
The gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar;<BR>
And, like a tempest, issues out the war.</P>
<P>The peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore,<BR>
Lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before,<BR>
Are all on fire; and some, with studious care,<BR>
Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare;<BR>
Some their soft limbs in painful marches try,<BR>
And war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral cry.<BR>
Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part<BR>
New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart:<BR>
With joy they view the waving ensigns fly,<BR>
And hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky.<BR>
Five cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs,<BR>
Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs,<BR>
Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town:<BR>
All these of old were places of renown.<BR>
Some hammer helmets for the fighting field;<BR>
Some twine young sallows to support the shield;<BR>
The croslet some, and some the cuishes mold,<BR>
With silver plated, and with ductile gold.<BR>
The rustic honors of the scythe and share<BR>
Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war.<BR>
Old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires;<BR>
The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires.<BR>
The word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace<BR>
The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace.<BR>
The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied;<BR>
The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side.</P>
<P>And now the mighty labor is begun<BR>
Ye Muses, open all your Helicon.<BR>
Sing you the chiefs that sway'd th' Ausonian land,<BR>
Their arms, and armies under their command;<BR>
What warriors in our ancient clime were bred;<BR>
What soldiers follow'd, and what heroes led.<BR>
For well you know, and can record alone,<BR>
What fame to future times conveys but darkly down.<BR>
Mezentius first appear'd upon the plain:<BR>
Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain,<BR>
Defying earth and heav'n. Etruria lost,<BR>
He brings to Turnus' aid his baffled host.<BR>
The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire,<BR>
Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire;<BR>
To Turnus only second in the grace<BR>
Of manly mien, and features of the face.<BR>
A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred,<BR>
With fates averse a thousand men he led:<BR>
His sire unworthy of so brave a son;<BR>
Himself well worthy of a happier throne.</P>
<P>Next Aventinus drives his chariot round<BR>
The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown'd.<BR>
Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field;<BR>
His father's hydra fills his ample shield:<BR>
A hundred serpents hiss about the brims;<BR>
The son of Hercules he justly seems<BR>
By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs;<BR>
Of heav'nly part, and part of earthly blood,<BR>
A mortal woman mixing with a god.<BR>
For strong Alcides, after he had slain<BR>
The triple Geryon, drove from conquer'd Spain<BR>
His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led,<BR>
On Tuscan Tiber's flow'ry banks they fed.<BR>
Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove<BR>
The priestess Rhea found, and forc'd to love.<BR>
For arms, his men long piles and jav'lins bore;<BR>
And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore.<BR>
Like Hercules himself his son appears,<BR>
In salvage pomp; a lion's hide he wears;<BR>
About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin;<BR>
The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin.<BR>
Thus, like the god his father, homely dress'd,<BR>
He strides into the hall, a horrid guest.</P>
<P>Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came,<BR>
(Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,)<BR>
Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear:<BR>
Arm'd Argive horse they led, and in the front appear.<BR>
Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain's height<BR>
With rapid course descending to the fight;<BR>
They rush along; the rattling woods give way;<BR>
The branches bend before their sweepy sway.</P>
<P>Nor was Praeneste's founder wanting there,<BR>
Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber:<BR>
Found in the fire, and foster'd in the plains,<BR>
A shepherd and a king at once he reigns,<BR>
And leads to Turnus' aid his country swains.<BR>
His own Praeneste sends a chosen band,<BR>
With those who plow Saturnia's Gabine land;<BR>
Besides the succor which cold Anien yields,<BR>
The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields,<BR>
Anagnia fat, and Father Amasene-<BR>
A num'rous rout, but all of naked men:<BR>
Nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield,<BR>
Nor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field,<BR>
But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead,<BR>
And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head;<BR>
The left foot naked, when they march to fight,<BR>
But in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right.<BR>
Messapus next, (great Neptune was his sire,)<BR>
Secure of steel, and fated from the fire,<BR>
In pomp appears, and with his ardor warms<BR>
A heartless train, unexercis'd in arms:<BR>
The just Faliscans he to battle brings,<BR>
And those who live where Lake Ciminia springs;<BR>
And where Feronia's grove and temple stands,<BR>
Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands.<BR>
All these in order march, and marching sing<BR>
The warlike actions of their sea-born king;<BR>
Like a long team of snowy swans on high,<BR>
Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky,<BR>
When, homeward from their wat'ry pastures borne,<BR>
They sing, and Asia's lakes their notes return.<BR>
Not one who heard their music from afar,<BR>
Would think these troops an army train'd to war,<BR>
But flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar,<BR>
With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore.</P>
<P>Then Clausus came, who led a num'rous band<BR>
Of troops embodied from the Sabine land,<BR>
And, in himself alone, an army brought.<BR>
'T was he, the noble Claudian race begot,<BR>
The Claudian race, ordain'd, in times to come,<BR>
To share the greatness of imperial Rome.<BR>
He led the Cures forth, of old renown,<BR>
Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town,<BR>
And all th' Eretian pow'rs; besides a band<BR>
That follow'd from Velinum's dewy land,<BR>
And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame,<BR>
And mountaineers, that from Severus came,<BR>
And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica,<BR>
And those where yellow Tiber takes his way,<BR>
And where Himella's wanton waters play.<BR>
Casperia sends her arms, with those that lie<BR>
By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli:<BR>
The warlike aids of Horta next appear,<BR>
And the cold Nursians come to close the rear,<BR>
Mix'd with the natives born of Latine blood,<BR>
Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood.<BR>
Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main,<BR>
When pale Orion sets in wintry rain;<BR>
Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise,<BR>
Or Lycian fields, when Phoebus burns the skies,<BR>
Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around;<BR>
Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground.</P>
<P>High in his chariot then Halesus came,<BR>
A foe by birth to Troy's unhappy name:<BR>
From Agamemnon born- to Turnus' aid<BR>
A thousand men the youthful hero led,<BR>
Who till the Massic soil, for wine renown'd,<BR>
And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground,<BR>
And those who live by Sidicinian shores,<BR>
And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars,<BR>
Cales' and Osca's old inhabitants,<BR>
And rough Saticulans, inur'd to wants:<BR>
Light demi-lances from afar they throw,<BR>
Fasten'd with leathern thongs, to gall the foe.<BR>
Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear;<BR>
And on their warding arm light bucklers bear.</P>
<P>Nor Oebalus, shalt thou be left unsung,<BR>
From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung,<BR>
Who then in Teleboan Capri reign'd;<BR>
But that short isle th' ambitious youth disdain'd,<BR>
And o'er Campania stretch'd his ample sway,<BR>
Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea;<BR>
O'er Batulum, and where Abella sees,<BR>
From her high tow'rs, the harvest of her trees.<BR>
And these (as was the Teuton use of old)<BR>
Wield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold;<BR>
Sling weighty stones, when from afar they fight;<BR>
Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light.</P>
<P>Next these in rank, the warlike Ufens went,<BR>
And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent.<BR>
The rude Equicolae his rule obey'd;<BR>
Hunting their sport, and plund'ring was their trade.<BR>
In arms they plow'd, to battle still prepar'd:<BR>
Their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard.</P>
<P>Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led,<BR>
By King Archippus sent to Turnus' aid,<BR>
And peaceful olives crown'd his hoary head.<BR>
His wand and holy words, the viper's rage,<BR>
And venom'd wounds of serpents could assuage.<BR>
He, when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep<BR>
Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep.<BR>
But vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art,<BR>
To cure the wound giv'n by the Dardan dart:<BR>
Yet his untimely fate th' Angitian woods<BR>
In sighs remurmur'd to the Fucine floods.</P>
<P>The son of fam'd Hippolytus was there,<BR>
Fam'd as his sire, and, as his mother, fair;<BR>
Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore,<BR>
And nurs'd his youth along the marshy shore,<BR>
Where great Diana's peaceful altars flame,<BR>
In fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name.<BR>
Hippolytus, as old records have said,<BR>
Was by his stepdam sought to share her bed;<BR>
But, when no female arts his mind could move,<BR>
She turn'd to furious hate her impious love.<BR>
Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore,<BR>
Another's crimes th' unhappy hunter bore,<BR>
Glutting his father's eyes with guiltless gore.<BR>
But chaste Diana, who his death deplor'd,<BR>
With Aesculapian herbs his life restor'd.<BR>
Then Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain,<BR>
The dead inspir'd with vital breath again,<BR>
Struck to the center, with his flaming dart,<BR>
Th' unhappy founder of the godlike art.<BR>
But Trivia kept in secret shades alone<BR>
Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown;<BR>
And call'd him Virbius in th' Egerian grove,<BR>
Where then he liv'd obscure, but safe from Jove.<BR>
For this, from Trivia's temple and her wood<BR>
Are coursers driv'n, who shed their master's blood,<BR>
Affrighted by the monsters of the flood.<BR>
His son, the second Virbius, yet retain'd<BR>
His father's art, and warrior steeds he rein'd.</P>
<P>Amid the troops, and like the leading god,<BR>
High o'er the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode:<BR>
A triple of plumes his crest adorn'd,<BR>
On which with belching flames Chimaera burn'd:<BR>
The more the kindled combat rises high'r,<BR>
The more with fury burns the blazing fire.<BR>
Fair Io grac'd his shield; but Io now<BR>
With horns exalted stands, and seems to low-<BR>
A noble charge! Her keeper by her side,<BR>
To watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied;<BR>
And on the brims her sire, the wat'ry god,<BR>
Roll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood.<BR>
A cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields<BR>
With swords, and pointed spears, and clatt'ring shields;<BR>
Of Argives, and of old Sicanian bands,<BR>
And those who plow the rich Rutulian lands;<BR>
Auruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields,<BR>
And the proud Labicans, with painted shields,<BR>
And those who near Numician streams reside,<BR>
And those whom Tiber's holy forests hide,<BR>
Or Circe's hills from the main land divide;<BR>
Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands,<BR>
Or the black water of Pomptina stands.</P>
<P>Last, from the Volscians fair Camilla came,<BR>
And led her warlike troops, a warrior dame;<BR>
Unbred to spinning, in the loom unskill'd,<BR>
She chose the nobler Pallas of the field.<BR>
Mix'd with the first, the fierce virago fought,<BR>
Sustain'd the toils of arms, the danger sought,<BR>
Outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain,<BR>
Flew o'er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain:<BR>
She swept the seas, and, as she skimm'd along,<BR>
Her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung.<BR>
Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise,<BR>
Where'er she passes, fix their wond'ring eyes:<BR>
Longing they look, and, gaping at the sight,<BR>
Devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight;<BR>
Her purple habit sits with such a grace<BR>
On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face;<BR>
Her head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd,<BR>
And in a golden caul the curls are bound.<BR>
She shakes her myrtle jav'lin; and, behind,<BR>
Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind.</P>
