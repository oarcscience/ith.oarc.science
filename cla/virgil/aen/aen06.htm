<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">BOOK VI</H1>
<P>He said, and wept; then spread his sails before<BR>
The winds, and reach'd at length the Cumaean shore:<BR>
Their anchors dropp'd, his crew the vessels moor.<BR>
They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land,<BR>
And greet with greedy joy th' Italian strand.<BR>
Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed;<BR>
Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed,<BR>
Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods,<BR>
Or trace thro' valleys the discover'd floods.<BR>
Thus, while their sev'ral charges they fulfil,<BR>
The pious prince ascends the sacred hill<BR>
Where Phoebus is ador'd; and seeks the shade<BR>
Which hides from sight his venerable maid.<BR>
Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode;<BR>
Thence full of fate returns, and of the god.<BR>
Thro' Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold,<BR>
And enter now, the temple roof'd with gold.<BR>
When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore,<BR>
His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore,<BR>
(The first who sail'd in air,) 't is sung by Fame,<BR>
To the Cumaean coast at length he came,<BR>
And here alighting, built this costly frame.<BR>
Inscrib'd to Phoebus, here he hung on high<BR>
The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky:<BR>
Then o'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd<BR>
Androgeos' death, and off'rings to his ghost;<BR>
Sev'n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet<BR>
The fate appointed by revengeful Crete.<BR>
And next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd,<BR>
In which the destin'd names by lots were cast:<BR>
The mournful parents stand around in tears,<BR>
And rising Crete against their shore appears.<BR>
There too, in living sculpture, might be seen<BR>
The mad affection of the Cretan queen;<BR>
Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye;<BR>
The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny,<BR>
The lower part a beast, a man above,<BR>
The monument of their polluted love.<BR>
Not far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze,<BR>
A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways:<BR>
Here dwells the monster, hid from human view,<BR>
Not to be found, but by the faithful clew;<BR>
Till the kind artist, mov'd with pious grief,<BR>
Lent to the loving maid this last relief,<BR>
And all those erring paths describ'd so well<BR>
That Theseus conquer'd and the monster fell.<BR>
Here hapless Icarus had found his part,<BR>
Had not the father's grief restrain'd his art.<BR>
He twice assay'd to cast his son in gold;<BR>
Twice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mold.</P>
<P>All this with wond'ring eyes Aeneas view'd;<BR>
Each varying object his delight renew'd:<BR>
Eager to read the rest- Achates came,<BR>
And by his side the mad divining dame,<BR>
The priestess of the god, Deiphobe her name.<BR>
"Time suffers not," she said, "to feed your eyes<BR>
With empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice.<BR>
Sev'n bullocks, yet unyok'd, for Phoebus choose,<BR>
And for Diana sev'n unspotted ewes."<BR>
This said, the servants urge the sacred rites,<BR>
While to the temple she the prince invites.<BR>
A spacious cave, within its farmost part,<BR>
Was hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art<BR>
Thro' the hill's hollow sides: before the place,<BR>
A hundred doors a hundred entries grace;<BR>
As many voices issue, and the sound<BR>
Of Sybil's words as many times rebound.<BR>
Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries:<BR>
"This is the time; enquire your destinies.<BR>
He comes; behold the god!" Thus while she said,<BR>
(And shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd,)<BR>
Her color chang'd; her face was not the same,<BR>
And hollow groans from her deep spirit came.<BR>
Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess'd<BR>
Her trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring breast.<BR>
Greater than humankind she seem'd to look,<BR>
And with an accent more than mortal spoke.<BR>
Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll;<BR>
When all the god came rushing on her soul.<BR>
Swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke:<BR>
"Why this delay?" she cried- "the pow'rs invoke!<BR>
Thy pray'rs alone can open this abode;<BR>
Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god."</P>
<P>She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear,<BR>
O'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear.<BR>
The prince himself, with awful dread possess'd,<BR>
His vows to great Apollo thus address'd:<BR>
"Indulgent god, propitious pow'r to Troy,<BR>
Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy,<BR>
Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart<BR>
Pierc'd the proud Grecian's only mortal part:<BR>
Thus far, by fate's decrees and thy commands,<BR>
Thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands,<BR>
Our exil'd crew has sought th' Ausonian ground;<BR>
And now, at length, the flying coast is found.<BR>
Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place,<BR>
With fury has pursued her wand'ring race.<BR>
Here cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance end:<BR>
Troy is no more, and can no more offend.<BR>
And thou, O sacred maid, inspir'd to see<BR>
Th' event of things in dark futurity;<BR>
Give me what Heav'n has promis'd to my fate,<BR>
To conquer and command the Latian state;<BR>
To fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place<BR>
For the long exiles of the Trojan race.<BR>
Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear<BR>
To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r;<BR>
And annual rites, and festivals, and games,<BR>
Shall be perform'd to their auspicious names.<BR>
Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land;<BR>
For there thy faithful oracles shall stand,<BR>
Preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay,<BR>
Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey:<BR>
All shall be treasur'd by a chosen train<BR>
Of holy priests, and ever shall remain.<BR>
But O! commit not thy prophetic mind<BR>
To flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind,<BR>
Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;<BR>
Write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate."</P>
<P>Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,<BR>
And lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god,<BR>
The more she strove to shake him from her breast,<BR>
With more and far superior force he press'd;<BR>
Commands his entrance, and, without control,<BR>
Usurps her organs and inspires her soul.<BR>
Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors<BR>
Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars<BR>
Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores:<BR>
"Escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign,<BR>
Yet more and greater ills by land remain.<BR>
The coast, so long desir'd (nor doubt th' event),<BR>
Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent.<BR>
Wars, horrid wars, I view- a field of blood,<BR>
And Tiber rolling with a purple flood.<BR>
Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:<BR>
A new Achilles shall in arms appear,<BR>
And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate,<BR>
Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate.<BR>
To what strange nations shalt not thou resort,<BR>
Driv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court!<BR>
The cause the same which Ilium once oppress'd;<BR>
A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest.<BR>
But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes,<BR>
The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose.<BR>
The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown<BR>
From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town."</P>
<P>Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke,<BR>
And the resisting air the thunder broke;<BR>
The cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook.<BR>
Th' ambiguous god, who rul'd her lab'ring breast,<BR>
In these mysterious words his mind express'd;<BR>
Some truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest.<BR>
At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd,<BR>
And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas'd.<BR>
Then thus the chief: "No terror to my view,<BR>
No frightful face of danger can be new.<BR>
Inur'd to suffer, and resolv'd to dare,<BR>
The Fates, without my pow'r, shall be without my care.<BR>
This let me crave, since near your grove the road<BR>
To hell lies open, and the dark abode<BR>
Which Acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood;<BR>
Conduct me thro' the regions void of light,<BR>
And lead me longing to my father's sight.<BR>
For him, a thousand dangers I have sought,<BR>
And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought,<BR>
Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought.<BR>
He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried,<BR>
And wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious guide,<BR>
And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied.<BR>
Oft, since he breath'd his last, in dead of night<BR>
His reverend image stood before my sight;<BR>
Enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade;<BR>
Conducted there by your unerring aid.<BR>
But you, if pious minds by pray'rs are won,<BR>
Oblige the father, and protect the son.<BR>
Yours is the pow'r; nor Proserpine in vain<BR>
Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.<BR>
If Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre,<BR>
The ruthless king with pity could inspire,<BR>
And from the shades below redeem his wife;<BR>
If Pollux, off'ring his alternate life,<BR>
Could free his brother, and can daily go<BR>
By turns aloft, by turns descend below-<BR>
Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,<BR>
Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?<BR>
Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;<BR>
My mother greater, my descent the same."<BR>
So pray'd the Trojan prince, and, while he pray'd,<BR>
His hand upon the holy altar laid.</P>
<P>Then thus replied the prophetess divine:<BR>
"O goddess-born of great Anchises' line,<BR>
The gates of hell are open night and day;<BR>
Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:<BR>
But to return, and view the cheerful skies,<BR>
In this the task and mighty labor lies.<BR>
To few great Jupiter imparts this grace,<BR>
And those of shining worth and heav'nly race.<BR>
Betwixt those regions and our upper light,<BR>
Deep forests and impenetrable night<BR>
Possess the middle space: th' infernal bounds<BR>
Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.<BR>
But if so dire a love your soul invades,<BR>
As twice below to view the trembling shades;<BR>
If you so hard a toil will undertake,<BR>
As twice to pass th' innavigable lake;<BR>
Receive my counsel. In the neighb'ring grove<BR>
There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove<BR>
Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night<BR>
Conceal the happy plant from human sight.<BR>
One bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!)<BR>
The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold:<BR>
This from the vulgar branches must be torn,<BR>
And to fair Proserpine the present borne,<BR>
Ere leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies.<BR>
The first thus rent a second will arise,<BR>
And the same metal the same room supplies.<BR>
Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see<BR>
The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:<BR>
Then rend it off, as holy rites command;<BR>
The willing metal will obey thy hand,<BR>
Following with ease, if favor'd by thy fate,<BR>
Thou art foredoom'd to view the Stygian state:<BR>
If not, no labor can the tree constrain;<BR>
And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain.<BR>
Besides, you know not, while you here attend,<BR>
Th' unworthy fate of your unhappy friend:<BR>
Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,<BR>
Depriv'd of fun'ral rites, pollutes your host.<BR>
Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead,<BR>
Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;<BR>
Then, living turfs upon his body lay:<BR>
This done, securely take the destin'd way,<BR>
To find the regions destitute of day."</P>
<P>She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went<BR>
Sad from the cave, and full of discontent,<BR>
Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant.<BR>
Achates, the companion of his breast,<BR>
Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress'd.<BR>
Walking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd<BR>
What friend the priestess by those words design'd.<BR>
But soon they found an object to deplore:<BR>
Misenus lay extended the shore;<BR>
Son of the God of Winds: none so renown'd<BR>
The warrior trumpet in the field to sound;<BR>
With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,<BR>
And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms.<BR>
He serv'd great Hector, and was ever near,<BR>
Not with his trumpet only, but his spear.<BR>
But by Pelides' arms when Hector fell,<BR>
He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well.<BR>
Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more,<BR>
He now provokes the sea gods from the shore;<BR>
With envy Triton heard the martial sound,<BR>
And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown'd;<BR>
Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand:<BR>
The gazing crowd around the body stand.<BR>
All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate,<BR>
And hastens to perform the funeral state.<BR>
In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear;<BR>
The basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air.<BR>
An ancient wood, fit for the work design'd,<BR>
(The shady covert of the salvage kind,)<BR>
The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied;<BR>
Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow'ring pride<BR>
Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,<BR>
And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.<BR>
Huge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy crown<BR>
Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.<BR>
Arm'd like the rest the Trojan prince appears,<BR>
And by his pious labor urges theirs.</P>
<P>Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind<BR>
The ways to compass what his wish design'd,<BR>
He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove,<BR>
And then with vows implor'd the Queen of Love:<BR>
"O may thy pow'r, propitious still to me,<BR>
Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree,<BR>
In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath<BR>
Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus' death."<BR>
Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight,<BR>
Two doves, descending from their airy flight,<BR>
Secure upon the grassy plain alight.<BR>
He knew his mother's birds; and thus he pray'd:<BR>
"Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid,<BR>
And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found,<BR>
Whose glitt'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground.<BR>
And thou, great parent, with celestial care,<BR>
In this distress be present to my pray'r!"<BR>
Thus having said, he stopp'd with watchful sight,<BR>
Observing still the motions of their flight,<BR>
What course they took, what happy signs they shew.<BR>
They fed, and, flutt'ring, by degrees withdrew<BR>
Still farther from the place, but still in view:<BR>
Hopping and flying, thus they led him on<BR>
To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun<BR>
They wing'd their flight aloft; then, stooping low,<BR>
Perch'd on the double tree that bears the golden bough.<BR>
Thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows glow;<BR>
As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe,<BR>
Where the proud mother views her precious brood,<BR>
And happier branches, which she never sow'd.<BR>
Such was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind,<BR>
And dancing leaves, that wanton'd in the wind.<BR>
He seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold,<BR>
And rent away, with ease, the ling'ring gold;<BR>
Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize.<BR>
Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes,<BR>
To dead Misenus pay his obsequies.<BR>
First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear,<BR>
Of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir:<BR>
The fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew,<BR>
And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew.<BR>
The topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn;<BR>
Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne,<BR>
Are pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint,<BR>
And fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint.<BR>
With groans and cries Misenus they deplore:<BR>
Then on a bier, with purple cover'd o'er,<BR>
The breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay,<BR>
And fire the pile, their faces turn'd away-<BR>
Such reverend rites their fathers us'd to pay.<BR>
Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw,<BR>
And fat of victims, which his friends bestow.<BR>
These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour;<BR>
Then on the living coals red wine they pour;<BR>
And, last, the relics by themselves dispose,<BR>
Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose.<BR>
Old Corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew,<BR>
And dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew;<BR>
Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud<BR>
Invok'd the dead, and then dismissed the crowd.<BR>
But good Aeneas order'd on the shore<BR>
A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore,<BR>
A soldier's fauchion, and a seaman's oar.<BR>
Thus was his friend interr'd; and deathless fame<BR>
Still to the lofty cape consigns his name.<BR>
These rites perform'd, the prince, without delay,<BR>
Hastes to the nether world his destin'd way.<BR>
Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went<BR>
From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;<BR>
And here th' access a gloomy grove defends,<BR>
And there th' unnavigable lake extends,<BR>
O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light,<BR>
No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;<BR>
Such deadly stenches from the depths arise,<BR>
And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies.<BR>
From hence the Grecian bards their legends make,<BR>
And give the name Avernus to the lake.<BR>
Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught,<BR>
For sacrifice the pious hero brought.<BR>
The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns;<BR>
Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns,<BR>
Invoking Hecate hither to repair:<BR>
A pow'rful name in hell and upper air.<BR>
The sacred priests with ready knives bereave<BR>
The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive<BR>
The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night<BR>
(The sable wool without a streak of white)<BR>
Aeneas offers; and, by fate's decree,<BR>
A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee,<BR>
With holocausts he Pluto's altar fills;<BR>
Sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills;<BR>
Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours;<BR>
Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours.<BR>
Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun,<BR>
Nor ended till the next returning sun.<BR>
Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance,<BR>
And howling dogs in glimm'ring light advance,<BR>
Ere Hecate came. "Far hence be souls profane!"<BR>
The Sibyl cried, "and from the grove abstain!<BR>
Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford;<BR>
Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword."<BR>
She said, and pass'd along the gloomy space;<BR>
The prince pursued her steps with equal pace.</P>
<P>Ye realms, yet unreveal'd to human sight,<BR>
Ye gods who rule the regions of the night,<BR>
Ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate<BR>
The mystic wonders of your silent state!</P>
<P>Obscure they went thro' dreary shades, that led<BR>
Along the waste dominions of the dead.<BR>
Thus wander travelers in woods by night,<BR>
By the moon's doubtful and malignant light,<BR>
When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies,<BR>
And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes.</P>
<P>Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell,<BR>
Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell,<BR>
And pale Diseases, and repining Age,<BR>
Want, Fear, and Famine's unresisted rage;<BR>
Here Toils, and Death, and Death's half-brother, Sleep,<BR>
Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep;<BR>
With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind,<BR>
Deep Frauds before, and open Force behind;<BR>
The Furies' iron beds; and Strife, that shakes<BR>
Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes.<BR>
Full in the midst of this infernal road,<BR>
An elm displays her dusky arms abroad:<BR>
The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head,<BR>
And empty dreams on ev'ry leaf are spread.<BR>
Of various forms unnumber'd specters more,<BR>
Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door.<BR>
Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands,<BR>
And Briareus with all his hundred hands;<BR>
Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame;<BR>
And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame.<BR>
The chief unsheath'd his shining steel, prepar'd,<BR>
Tho' seiz'd with sudden fear, to force the guard,<BR>
Off'ring his brandish'd weapon at their face;<BR>
Had not the Sibyl stopp'd his eager pace,<BR>
And told him what those empty phantoms were:<BR>
Forms without bodies, and impassive air.<BR>
Hence to deep Acheron they take their way,<BR>
Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay,<BR>
Are whirl'd aloft, and in Cocytus lost.<BR>
There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast-<BR>
A sordid god: down from his hoary chin<BR>
A length of beard descends, uncomb'd, unclean;<BR>
His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;<BR>
A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.<BR>
He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers;<BR>
The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears.<BR>
He look'd in years; yet in his years were seen<BR>
A youthful vigor and autumnal green.<BR>
An airy crowd came rushing where he stood,<BR>
Which fill'd the margin of the fatal flood:<BR>
Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids,<BR>
And mighty heroes' more majestic shades,<BR>
And youths, intomb'd before their fathers' eyes,<BR>
With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries.<BR>
Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods,<BR>
Or fowls, by winter forc'd, forsake the floods,<BR>
And wing their hasty flight to happier lands;<BR>
Such, and so thick, the shiv'ring army stands,<BR>
And press for passage with extended hands.<BR>
Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore:<BR>
The rest he drove to distance from the shore.<BR>
The hero, who beheld with wond'ring eyes<BR>
The tumult mix'd with shrieks, laments, and cries,<BR>
Ask'd of his guide, what the rude concourse meant;<BR>
Why to the shore the thronging people bent;<BR>
What forms of law among the ghosts were us'd;<BR>
Why some were ferried o'er, and some refus'd.</P>
<P>"Son of Anchises, offspring of the gods,"<BR>
The Sibyl said, "you see the Stygian floods,<BR>
The sacred stream which heav'n's imperial state<BR>
Attests in oaths, and fears to violate.<BR>
The ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew<BR>
Depriv'd of sepulchers and fun'ral due:<BR>
The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host,<BR>
He ferries over to the farther coast;<BR>
Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves<BR>
With such whose bones are not compos'd in graves.<BR>
A hundred years they wander on the shore;<BR>
At length, their penance done, are wafted o'er."<BR>
The Trojan chief his forward pace repress'd,<BR>
Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast,<BR>
He saw his friends, who, whelm'd beneath the waves,<BR>
Their fun'ral honors claim'd, and ask'd their quiet graves.<BR>
The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew,<BR>
And the brave leader of the Lycian crew,<BR>
Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met;<BR>
The sailors master'd, and the ship o'erset.</P>
<P>Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press'd,<BR>
Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest,<BR>
Who, while he steering view'd the stars, and bore<BR>
His course from Afric to the Latian shore,<BR>
Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix'd his view,<BR>
And scarcely thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew.<BR>
Then thus the prince: "What envious pow'r, O friend,<BR>
Brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end?<BR>
For Phoebus, ever true in all he said,<BR>
Has in your fate alone my faith betray'd.<BR>
The god foretold you should not die, before<BR>
You reach'd, secure from seas, th' Italian shore.<BR>
Is this th' unerring pow'r?" The ghost replied;<BR>
"Nor Phoebus flatter'd, nor his answers lied;<BR>
Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep:<BR>
But, while the stars and course of heav'n I keep,<BR>
My wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal sleep.<BR>
I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain'd<BR>
Was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain'd.<BR>
Now by the winds and raging waves I swear,<BR>
Your safety, more than mine, was then my care;<BR>
Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost,<BR>
Your ship should run against the rocky coast.<BR>
Three blust'ring nights, borne by the southern blast,<BR>
I floated, and discover'd land at last:<BR>
High on a mounting wave my head I bore,<BR>
Forcing my strength, and gath'ring to the shore.<BR>
Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz'd<BR>
The craggy cliffs, and my tir'd members eas'd.<BR>
While, cumber'd with my dropping clothes, I lay,<BR>
The cruel nation, covetous of prey,<BR>
Stain'd with my blood th' unhospitable coast;<BR>
And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss'd:<BR>
Which O avert, by yon ethereal light,<BR>
Which I have lost for this eternal night!<BR>
Or, if by dearer ties you may be won,<BR>
By your dead sire, and by your living son,<BR>
Redeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost;<BR>
Or with your navy seek the Velin coast,<BR>
And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose;<BR>
Or, if a nearer way your mother shows,<BR>
Without whose aid you durst not undertake<BR>
This frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake,<BR>
Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er<BR>
To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore."<BR>
Scarce had he said, the prophetess began:<BR>
"What hopes delude thee, miserable man?<BR>
Think'st thou, thus unintomb'd, to cross the floods,<BR>
To view the Furies and infernal gods,<BR>
And visit, without leave, the dark abodes?<BR>
Attend the term of long revolving years;<BR>
Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears.<BR>
This comfort of thy dire misfortune take:<BR>
The wrath of Heav'n, inflicted for thy sake,<BR>
With vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast,<BR>
Till they propitiate thy offended ghost,<BR>
And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray'r;<BR>
And Palinurus' name the place shall bear."<BR>
This calm'd his cares; sooth'd with his future fame,<BR>
And pleas'd to hear his propagated name.</P>
<P>Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw:<BR>
Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw;<BR>
Observ'd their passage thro' the shady wood,<BR>
And mark'd their near approaches to the flood.<BR>
Then thus he call'd aloud, inflam'd with wrath:<BR>
"Mortal, whate'er, who this forbidden path<BR>
In arms presum'st to tread, I charge thee, stand,<BR>
And tell thy name, and bus'ness in the land.<BR>
Know this, the realm of night- the Stygian shore:<BR>
My boat conveys no living bodies o'er;<BR>
Nor was I pleas'd great Theseus once to bear,<BR>
Who forc'd a passage with his pointed spear,<BR>
Nor strong Alcides- men of mighty fame,<BR>
And from th' immortal gods their lineage came.<BR>
In fetters one the barking porter tied,<BR>
And took him trembling from his sov'reign's side:<BR>
Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride."<BR>
To whom the Sibyl thus: "Compose thy mind;<BR>
Nor frauds are here contriv'd, nor force design'd.<BR>
Still may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain<BR>
Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train,<BR>
And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain.<BR>
The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove,<BR>
Much fam'd for arms, and more for filial love,<BR>
Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove.<BR>
If neither piety, nor Heav'n's command,<BR>
Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand,<BR>
This fatal present shall prevail at least."<BR>
Then shew'd the shining bough, conceal'd within her vest.<BR>
No more was needful: for the gloomy god<BR>
Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod;<BR>
Admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen-<BR>
A venerable gift, so rarely seen.<BR>
His fury thus appeas'd, he puts to land;<BR>
The ghosts forsake their seats at his command:<BR>
He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight;<BR>
The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight.<BR>
Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides;<BR>
The pressing water pours within her sides.<BR>
His passengers at length are wafted o'er,<BR>
Expos'd, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore.</P>
<P>No sooner landed, in his den they found<BR>
The triple porter of the Stygian sound,<BR>
Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear<BR>
His crested snakes, and arm'd his bristling hair.<BR>
The prudent Sibyl had before prepar'd<BR>
A sop, in honey steep'd, to charm the guard;<BR>
Which, mix'd with pow'rful drugs, she cast before<BR>
His greedy grinning jaws, just op'd to roar.<BR>
With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight,<BR>
With hunger press'd, devours the pleasing bait.<BR>
Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave;<BR>
He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave.<BR>
The keeper charm'd, the chief without delay<BR>
Pass'd on, and took th' irremeable way.<BR>
Before the gates, the cries of babes new born,<BR>
Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn,<BR>
Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws<BR>
Condemn'd to die, when traitors judg'd their cause.<BR>
Nor want they lots, nor judges to review<BR>
The wrongful sentence, and award a new.<BR>
Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears;<BR>
And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears.<BR>
Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls,<BR>
Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.<BR>
The next, in place and punishment, are they<BR>
Who prodigally throw their souls away;<BR>
Fools, who, repining at their wretched state,<BR>
And loathing anxious life, suborn'd their fate.<BR>
With late repentance now they would retrieve<BR>
The bodies they forsook, and wish to live;<BR>
Their pains and poverty desire to bear,<BR>
To view the light of heav'n, and breathe the vital air:<BR>
But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose,<BR>
And with circling streams the captive souls inclose.</P>
<P>Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear<BR>
So call'd from lovers that inhabit there.<BR>
The souls whom that unhappy flame invades,<BR>
In secret solitude and myrtle shades<BR>
Make endless moans, and, pining with desire,<BR>
Lament too late their unextinguish'd fire.<BR>
Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found,<BR>
Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound<BR>
Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there,<BR>
With Phaedra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair.<BR>
There Laodamia, with Evadne, moves,<BR>
Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves:<BR>
Caeneus, a woman once, and once a man,<BR>
But ending in the sex she first began.<BR>
Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood,<BR>
Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath'd in blood;<BR>
Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew,<BR>
Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view,<BR>
(Doubtful as he who sees, thro' dusky night,<BR>
Or thinks he sees, the moon's uncertain light,)<BR>
With tears he first approach'd the sullen shade;<BR>
And, as his love inspir'd him, thus he said:<BR>
"Unhappy queen! then is the common breath<BR>
Of rumor true, in your reported death,<BR>
And I, alas! the cause? By Heav'n, I vow,<BR>
And all the pow'rs that rule the realms below,<BR>
Unwilling I forsook your friendly state,<BR>
Commanded by the gods, and forc'd by fate-<BR>
Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might<BR>
Have sent me to these regions void of light,<BR>
Thro' the vast empire of eternal night.<BR>
Nor dar'd I to presume, that, press'd with grief,<BR>
My flight should urge you to this dire relief.<BR>
Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows:<BR>
'T is the last interview that fate allows!"<BR>
In vain he thus attempts her mind to move<BR>
With tears, and pray'rs, and late-repenting love.<BR>
Disdainfully she look'd; then turning round,<BR>
But fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground,<BR>
And what he says and swears, regards no more<BR>
Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar;<BR>
But whirl'd away, to shun his hateful sight,<BR>
Hid in the forest and the shades of night;<BR>
Then sought Sichaeus thro' the shady grove,<BR>
Who answer'd all her cares, and equal'd all her love.</P>
<P>Some pious tears the pitying hero paid,<BR>
And follow'd with his eyes the flitting shade,<BR>
Then took the forward way, by fate ordain'd,<BR>
And, with his guide, the farther fields attain'd,<BR>
Where, sever'd from the rest, the warrior souls remain'd.<BR>
Tydeus he met, with Meleager's race,<BR>
The pride of armies, and the soldiers' grace;<BR>
And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face.<BR>
Of Trojan chiefs he view'd a num'rous train,<BR>
All much lamented, all in battle slain;<BR>
Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest,<BR>
Antenor's sons, and Ceres' sacred priest.<BR>
And proud Idaeus, Priam's charioteer,<BR>
Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear.<BR>
The gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend<BR>
And with unwearied eyes behold their friend;<BR>
Delight to hover near, and long to know<BR>
What bus'ness brought him to the realms below.<BR>
But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon's train,<BR>
When his refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady plain,<BR>
Fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear,<BR>
As when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear<BR>
Drove headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed rear.<BR>
They rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes;<BR>
But the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats.</P>
<P>Here Priam's son, Deiphobus, he found,<BR>
Whose face and limbs were one continued wound:<BR>
Dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears,<BR>
Spoil'd of his nose, and shorten'd of his ears.<BR>
He scarcely knew him, striving to disown<BR>
His blotted form, and blushing to be known;<BR>
And therefore first began: "O Tsucer's race,<BR>
Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface?<BR>
What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace?<BR>
'Twas fam'd, that in our last and fatal night<BR>
Your single prowess long sustain'd the fight,<BR>
Till tir'd, not forc'd, a glorious fate you chose,<BR>
And fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes.<BR>
But, in remembrance of so brave a deed,<BR>
A tomb and fun'ral honors I decreed;<BR>
Thrice call'd your manes on the Trojan plains:<BR>
The place your armor and your name retains.<BR>
Your body too I sought, and, had I found,<BR>
Design'd for burial in your native ground."</P>
<P>The ghost replied: "Your piety has paid<BR>
All needful rites, to rest my wand'ring shade;<BR>
But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife,<BR>
To Grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life.<BR>
These are the monuments of Helen's love:<BR>
The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above.<BR>
You know in what deluding joys we pass'd<BR>
The night that was by Heav'n decreed our last:<BR>
For, when the fatal horse, descending down,<BR>
Pregnant with arms, o'erwhelm'd th' unhappy town<BR>
She feign'd nocturnal orgies; left my bed,<BR>
And, mix'd with Trojan dames, the dances led<BR>
Then, waving high her torch, the signal made,<BR>
Which rous'd the Grecians from their ambuscade.<BR>
With watching overworn, with cares oppress'd,<BR>
Unhappy I had laid me down to rest,<BR>
And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd.<BR>
Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid,<BR>
And from beneath my head my sword convey'd;<BR>
The door unlatch'd, and, with repeated calls,<BR>
Invites her former lord within my walls.<BR>
Thus in her crime her confidence she plac'd,<BR>
And with new treasons would redeem the past.<BR>
What need I more? Into the room they ran,<BR>
And meanly murther'd a defenseless man.<BR>
Ulysses, basely born, first led the way.<BR>
Avenging pow'rs! with justice if I pray,<BR>
That fortune be their own another day!<BR>
But answer you; and in your turn relate,<BR>
What brought you, living, to the Stygian state:<BR>
Driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea,<BR>
Or did you Heav'n's superior doom obey?<BR>
Or tell what other chance conducts your way,<BR>
To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats,<BR>
Tumults and torments of th' infernal seats."</P>
<P>While thus in talk the flying hours they pass,<BR>
The sun had finish'd more than half his race:<BR>
And they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent<BR>
The little time of stay which Heav'n had lent;<BR>
But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay:<BR>
"Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day:<BR>
'T is here, in different paths, the way divides;<BR>
The right to Pluto's golden palace guides;<BR>
The left to that unhappy region tends,<BR>
Which to the depth of Tartarus descends;<BR>
The seat of night profound, and punish'd fiends."<BR>
Then thus Deiphobus: "O sacred maid,<BR>
Forbear to chide, and be your will obey'd!<BR>
Lo! to the secret shadows I retire,<BR>
To pay my penance till my years expire.<BR>
Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown'd,<BR>
And born to better fates than I have found."<BR>
He said; and, while he said, his steps he turn'd<BR>
To secret shadows, and in silence mourn'd.</P>
<P>The hero, looking on the left, espied<BR>
A lofty tow'r, and strong on ev'ry side<BR>
With treble walls, which Phlegethon surrounds,<BR>
Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds;<BR>
And, press'd betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds<BR>
Wide is the fronting gate, and, rais'd on high<BR>
With adamantine columns, threats the sky.<BR>
Vain is the force of man, and Heav'n's as vain,<BR>
To crush the pillars which the pile sustain.<BR>
Sublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd;<BR>
And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward,<BR>
Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day,<BR>
Observant of the souls that pass the downward way.<BR>
From hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains<BR>
Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains.<BR>
The Trojan stood astonish'd at their cries,<BR>
And ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise;<BR>
And what the crimes, and what the tortures were,<BR>
And loud laments that rent the liquid air.</P>
<P>She thus replied: "The chaste and holy race<BR>
Are all forbidden this polluted place.<BR>
But Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods,<BR>
Then led me trembling thro' these dire abodes,<BR>
And taught the tortures of th' avenging gods.<BR>
These are the realms of unrelenting fate;<BR>
And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state.<BR>
He hears and judges each committed crime;<BR>
Enquires into the manner, place, and time.<BR>
The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal,<BR>
(Loth to confess, unable to conceal),<BR>
From the first moment of his vital breath,<BR>
To his last hour of unrepenting death.<BR>
Straight, o'er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes<BR>
The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes,<BR>
And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes.<BR>
Then, of itself, unfolds th' eternal door;<BR>
With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar.<BR>
You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost<BR>
Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post.<BR>
More formidable Hydra stands within,<BR>
Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin.<BR>
The gaping gulf low to the center lies,<BR>
And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies.<BR>
The rivals of the gods, the Titan race,<BR>
Here, sing'd with lightning, roll within th' unfathom'd space.<BR>
Here lie th' Alaean twins, (I saw them both,)<BR>
Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth,<BR>
Who dar'd in fight the Thund'rer to defy,<BR>
Affect his heav'n, and force him from the sky.<BR>
Salmoneus, suff'ring cruel pains, I found,<BR>
For emulating Jove; the rattling sound<BR>
Of mimic thunder, and the glitt'ring blaze<BR>
Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays.<BR>
Thro' Elis and the Grecian towns he flew;<BR>
Th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew:<BR>
He wav'd a torch aloft, and, madly vain,<BR>
Sought godlike worship from a servile train.<BR>
Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass<BR>
O'er hollow arches of resounding brass,<BR>
To rival thunder in its rapid course,<BR>
And imitate inimitable force!<BR>
But he, the King of Heav'n, obscure on high,<BR>
Bar'd his red arm, and, launching from the sky<BR>
His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke,<BR>
Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook.<BR>
There Tityus was to see, who took his birth<BR>
From heav'n, his nursing from the foodful earth.<BR>
Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace,<BR>
Infold nine acres of infernal space.<BR>
A rav'nous vulture, in his open'd side,<BR>
Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried;<BR>
Still for the growing liver digg'd his breast;<BR>
The growing liver still supplied the feast;<BR>
Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains:<BR>
Th' immortal hunger lasts, th' immortal food remains.<BR>
Ixion and Perithous I could name,<BR>
And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame.<BR>
High o'er their heads a mold'ring rock is plac'd,<BR>
That promises a fall, and shakes at ev'ry blast.<BR>
They lie below, on golden beds display'd;<BR>
And genial feasts with regal pomp are made.<BR>
The Queen of Furies by their sides is set,<BR>
And snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat,<BR>
Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears,<BR>
Tossing her torch, and thund'ring in their ears.<BR>
Then they, who brothers' better claim disown,<BR>
Expel their parents, and usurp the throne;<BR>
Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold,<BR>
Sit brooding on unprofitable gold;<BR>
Who dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend<BR>
To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend.<BR>
Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train<BR>
Of lustful youths, for foul adult'ry slain:<BR>
Hosts of deserters, who their honor sold,<BR>
And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold.<BR>
All these within the dungeon's depth remain,<BR>
Despairing pardon, and expecting pain.<BR>
Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know<BR>
Their process, or the forms of law below.<BR>
Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along,<BR>
And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung<BR>
Unhappy Theseus, doom'd for ever there,<BR>
Is fix'd by fate on his eternal chair;<BR>
And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries<BR>
(Could warning make the world more just or wise):<BR>
'Learn righteousness, and dread th' avenging deities.'<BR>
To tyrants others have their country sold,<BR>
Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold;<BR>
Some have old laws repeal'd, new statutes made,<BR>
Not as the people pleas'd, but as they paid;<BR>
With incest some their daughters' bed profan'd:<BR>
All dar'd the worst of ills, and, what they dar'd, attain'd.<BR>
Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,<BR>
And throats of brass, inspir'd with iron lungs,<BR>
I could not half those horrid crimes repeat,<BR>
Nor half the punishments those crimes have met.<BR>
But let us haste our voyage to pursue:<BR>
The walls of Pluto's palace are in view;<BR>
The gate, and iron arch above it, stands<BR>
On anvils labor'd by the Cyclops' hands.<BR>
Before our farther way the Fates allow,<BR>
Here must we fix on high the golden bough."</P>
<P>She said: and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd,<BR>
And chose the middle path. Arriv'd at last,<BR>
The prince with living water sprinkled o'er<BR>
His limbs and body; then approach'd the door,<BR>
Possess'd the porch, and on the front above<BR>
He fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by Pluto's love.<BR>
These holy rites perform'd, they took their way<BR>
Where long extended plains of pleasure lay:<BR>
The verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie,<BR>
With ether vested, and a purple sky;<BR>
The blissful seats of happy souls below.<BR>
Stars of their own, and their own suns, they know;<BR>
Their airy limbs in sports they exercise,<BR>
And on the green contend the wrestler's prize.<BR>
Some in heroic verse divinely sing;<BR>
Others in artful measures led the ring.<BR>
The Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest,<BR>
There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest;<BR>
His flying fingers, and harmonious quill,<BR>
Strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes, and sev'n at once they fill.<BR>
Here found they Tsucer's old heroic race,<BR>
Born better times and happier years to grace.<BR>
Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy<BR>
Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy.<BR>
The chief beheld their chariots from afar,<BR>
Their shining arms, and coursers train'd to war:<BR>
Their lances fix'd in earth, their steeds around,<BR>
Free from their harness, graze the flow'ry ground.<BR>
The love of horses which they had, alive,<BR>
And care of chariots, after death survive.<BR>
Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain;<BR>
Some did the song, and some the choir maintain,<BR>
Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po<BR>
Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below.<BR>
Here patriots live, who, for their country's good,<BR>
In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood:<BR>
Priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode,<BR>
And poets worthy their inspiring god;<BR>
And searching wits, of more mechanic parts,<BR>
Who grac'd their age with new-invented arts:<BR>
Those who to worth their bounty did extend,<BR>
And those who knew that bounty to commend.<BR>
The heads of these with holy fillets bound,<BR>
And all their temples were with garlands crown'd.</P>
<P>To these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd,<BR>
And first to him surrounded by the rest<BR>
(Tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast):<BR>
"Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say,<BR>
Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way<BR>
To find the hero, for whose only sake<BR>
We sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter lake?"<BR>
To this the sacred poet thus replied:<BR>
"In no fix'd place the happy souls reside.<BR>
In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds,<BR>
By crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads:<BR>
But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend;<BR>
The path conducts you to your journey's end."<BR>
This said, he led them up the mountain's brow,<BR>
And shews them all the shining fields below.<BR>
They wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go.</P>
<P>But old Anchises, in a flow'ry vale,<BR>
Review'd his muster'd race, and took the tale:<BR>
Those happy spirits, which, ordain'd by fate,<BR>
For future beings and new bodies wait-<BR>
With studious thought observ'd th' illustrious throng,<BR>
In nature's order as they pass'd along:<BR>
Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care,<BR>
In peaceful senates and successful war.<BR>
He, when Aeneas on the plain appears,<BR>
Meets him with open arms, and falling tears.<BR>
"Welcome," he said, "the gods' undoubted race!<BR>
O long expected to my dear embrace!<BR>
Once more 't is giv'n me to behold your face!<BR>
The love and pious duty which you pay<BR>
Have pass'd the perils of so hard a way.<BR>
'T is true, computing times, I now believ'd<BR>
The happy day approach'd; nor are my hopes deceiv'd.<BR>
What length of lands, what oceans have you pass'd;<BR>
What storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast?<BR>
How have I fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most,<BR>
When love assail'd you, on the Libyan coast."<BR>
To this, the filial duty thus replies:<BR>
"Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes<BR>
Appear'd, and often urg'd this painful enterprise.<BR>
After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea,<BR>
My navy rides at anchor in the bay.<BR>
But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun<BR>
The dear embraces of your longing son!"<BR>
He said; and falling tears his face bedew:<BR>
Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw;<BR>
And thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away,<BR>
Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day.</P>
<P>Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees<BR>
A sep'rate grove, thro' which a gentle breeze<BR>
Plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro' the trees;<BR>
And, just before the confines of the wood,<BR>
The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood.<BR>
About the boughs an airy nation flew,<BR>
Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew;<BR>
In summer's heat on tops of lilies feed,<BR>
And creep within their bells, to suck the balmy seed:<BR>
The winged army roams the fields around;<BR>
The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound.<BR>
Aeneas wond'ring stood, then ask'd the cause<BR>
Which to the stream the crowding people draws.<BR>
Then thus the sire: "The souls that throng the flood<BR>
Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow'd:<BR>
In Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste,<BR>
Of future life secure, forgetful of the past.<BR>
Long has my soul desir'd this time and place,<BR>
To set before your sight your glorious race,<BR>
That this presaging joy may fire your mind<BR>
To seek the shores by destiny design'd."-<BR>
"O father, can it be, that souls sublime<BR>
Return to visit our terrestrial clime,<BR>
And that the gen'rous mind, releas'd by death,<BR>
Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?"</P>
<P>Anchises then, in order, thus begun<BR>
To clear those wonders to his godlike son:<BR>
"Know, first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted frame,<BR>
And flowing waters, and the starry flame,<BR>
And both the radiant lights, one common soul<BR>
Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole.<BR>
This active mind, infus'd thro' all the space,<BR>
Unites and mingles with the mighty mass.<BR>
Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain,<BR>
And birds of air, and monsters of the main.<BR>
Th' ethereal vigor is in all the same,<BR>
And every soul is fill'd with equal flame;<BR>
As much as earthy limbs, and gross allay<BR>
Of mortal members, subject to decay,<BR>
Blunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day.<BR>
From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts,<BR>
Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts,<BR>
And grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind,<BR>
In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd,<BR>
Assert the native skies, or own its heav'nly kind:<BR>
Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains;<BR>
But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains.<BR>
The relics of inveterate vice they wear,<BR>
And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear.<BR>
For this are various penances enjoin'd;<BR>
And some are hung to bleach upon the wind,<BR>
Some plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires,<BR>
Till all the dregs are drain'd, and all the rust expires.<BR>
All have their manes, and those manes bear:<BR>
The few, so cleans'd, to these abodes repair,<BR>
And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air.<BR>
Then are they happy, when by length of time<BR>
The scurf is worn away of each committed crime;<BR>
No speck is left of their habitual stains,<BR>
But the pure ether of the soul remains.<BR>
But, when a thousand rolling years are past,<BR>
(So long their punishments and penance last,)<BR>
Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god,<BR>
Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood,<BR>
In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares<BR>
Of their past labors, and their irksome years,<BR>
That, unrememb'ring of its former pain,<BR>
The soul may suffer mortal flesh again."</P>
<P>Thus having said, the father spirit leads<BR>
The priestess and his son thro' swarms of shades,<BR>
And takes a rising ground, from thence to see<BR>
The long procession of his progeny.<BR>
"Survey," pursued the sire, "this airy throng,<BR>
As, offer'd to thy view, they pass along.<BR>
These are th' Italian names, which fate will join<BR>
With ours, and graff upon the Trojan line.<BR>
Observe the youth who first appears in sight,<BR>
And holds the nearest station to the light,<BR>
Already seems to snuff the vital air,<BR>
And leans just forward, on a shining spear:<BR>
Silvius is he, thy last-begotten race,<BR>
But first in order sent, to fill thy place;<BR>
An Alban name, but mix'd with Dardan blood,<BR>
Born in the covert of a shady wood:<BR>
Him fair Lavinia, thy surviving wife,<BR>
Shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life.<BR>
In Alba he shall fix his royal seat,<BR>
And, born a king, a race of kings beget.<BR>
Then Procas, honor of the Trojan name,<BR>
Capys, and Numitor, of endless fame.<BR>
A second Silvius after these appears;<BR>
Silvius Aeneas, for thy name he bears;<BR>
For arms and justice equally renown'd,<BR>
Who, late restor'd, in Alba shall be crown'd.<BR>
How great they look! how vig'rously they wield<BR>
Their weighty lances, and sustain the shield!<BR>
But they, who crown'd with oaken wreaths appear,<BR>
Shall Gabian walls and strong Fidena rear;<BR>
Nomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found;<BR>
And raise Collatian tow'rs on rocky ground.<BR>
All these shall then be towns of mighty fame,<BR>
Tho' now they lie obscure, and lands without a name.<BR>
See Romulus the great, born to restore<BR>
The crown that once his injur'd grandsire wore.<BR>
This prince a priestess of your blood shall bear,<BR>
And like his sire in arms he shall appear.<BR>
Two rising crests, his royal head adorn;<BR>
Born from a god, himself to godhead born:<BR>
His sire already signs him for the skies,<BR>
And marks the seat amidst the deities.<BR>
Auspicious chief! thy race, in times to come,<BR>
Shall spread the conquests of imperial Rome-<BR>
Rome, whose ascending tow'rs shall heav'n invade,<BR>
Involving earth and ocean in her shade;<BR>
High as the Mother of the Gods in place,<BR>
And proud, like her, of an immortal race.<BR>
Then, when in pomp she makes the Phrygian round,<BR>
With golden turrets on her temples crown'd;<BR>
A hundred gods her sweeping train supply;<BR>
Her offspring all, and all command the sky.</P>
<P>"Now fix your sight, and stand intent, to see<BR>
Your Roman race, and Julian progeny.<BR>
The mighty Caesar waits his vital hour,<BR>
Impatient for the world, and grasps his promis'd pow'r.<BR>
But next behold the youth of form divine,<BR>
Ceasar himself, exalted in his line;<BR>
Augustus, promis'd oft, and long foretold,<BR>
Sent to the realm that Saturn rul'd of old;<BR>
Born to restore a better age of gold.<BR>
Afric and India shall his pow'r obey;<BR>
He shall extend his propagated sway<BR>
Beyond the solar year, without the starry way,<BR>
Where Atlas turns the rolling heav'ns around,<BR>
And his broad shoulders with their lights are crown'd.<BR>
At his foreseen approach, already quake<BR>
The Caspian kingdoms and Maeotian lake:<BR>
Their seers behold the tempest from afar,<BR>
And threat'ning oracles denounce the war.<BR>
Nile hears him knocking at his sev'nfold gates,<BR>
And seeks his hidden spring, and fears his nephew's fates.<BR>
Nor Hercules more lands or labors knew,<BR>
Not tho' the brazen-footed hind he slew,<BR>
Freed Erymanthus from the foaming boar,<BR>
And dipp'd his arrows in Lernaean gore;<BR>
Nor Bacchus, turning from his Indian war,<BR>
By tigers drawn triumphant in his car,<BR>
From Nisus' top descending on the plains,<BR>
With curling vines around his purple reins.<BR>
And doubt we yet thro' dangers to pursue<BR>
The paths of honor, and a crown in view?<BR>
But what's the man, who from afar appears?<BR>
His head with olive crown'd, his hand a censer bears,<BR>
His hoary beard and holy vestments bring<BR>
His lost idea back: I know the Roman king.<BR>
He shall to peaceful Rome new laws ordain,<BR>
Call'd from his mean abode a scepter to sustain.<BR>
Him Tullus next in dignity succeeds,<BR>
An active prince, and prone to martial deeds.<BR>
He shall his troops for fighting fields prepare,<BR>
Disus'd to toils, and triumphs of the war.<BR>
By dint of sword his crown he shall increase,<BR>
And scour his armor from the rust of peace.<BR>
Whom Ancus follows, with a fawning air,<BR>
But vain within, and proudly popular.<BR>
Next view the Tarquin kings, th' avenging sword<BR>
Of Brutus, justly drawn, and Rome restor'd.<BR>
He first renews the rods and ax severe,<BR>
And gives the consuls royal robes to wear.<BR>
His sons, who seek the tyrant to sustain,<BR>
And long for arbitrary lords again,<BR>
With ignominy scourg'd, in open sight,<BR>
He dooms to death deserv'd, asserting public right.<BR>
Unhappy man, to break the pious laws<BR>
Of nature, pleading in his children's cause!<BR>
Howeer the doubtful fact is understood,<BR>
'T is love of honor, and his country's good:<BR>
The consul, not the father, sheds the blood.<BR>
Behold Torquatus the same track pursue;<BR>
And, next, the two devoted Decii view:<BR>
The Drusian line, Camillus loaded home<BR>
With standards well redeem'd, and foreign foes o'ercome<BR>
The pair you see in equal armor shine,<BR>
Now, friends below, in close embraces join;<BR>
But, when they leave the shady realms of night,<BR>
And, cloth'd in bodies, breathe your upper light,<BR>
With mortal hate each other shall pursue:<BR>
What wars, what wounds, what slaughter shall ensue!<BR>
From Alpine heights the father first descends;<BR>
His daughter's husband in the plain attends:<BR>
His daughter's husband arms his eastern friends.<BR>
Embrace again, my sons, be foes no more;<BR>
Nor stain your country with her children's gore!<BR>
And thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim,<BR>
Thou, of my blood, who bearist the Julian name!<BR>
Another comes, who shall in triumph ride,<BR>
And to the Capitol his chariot guide,<BR>
From conquer'd Corinth, rich with Grecian spoils.<BR>
And yet another, fam'd for warlike toils,<BR>
On Argos shall impose the Roman laws,<BR>
And on the Greeks revenge the Trojan cause;<BR>
Shall drag in chains their Achillean race;<BR>
Shall vindicate his ancestors' disgrace,<BR>
And Pallas, for her violated place.<BR>
Great Cato there, for gravity renown'd,<BR>
And conqu'ring Cossus goes with laurels crown'd.<BR>
Who can omit the Gracchi? who declare<BR>
The Scipios' worth, those thunderbolts of war,<BR>
The double bane of Carthage? Who can see<BR>
Without esteem for virtuous poverty,<BR>
Severe Fabricius, or can cease t' admire<BR>
The plowman consul in his coarse attire?<BR>
Tir'd as I am, my praise the Fabii claim;<BR>
And thou, great hero, greatest of thy name,<BR>
Ordain'd in war to save the sinking state,<BR>
And, by delays, to put a stop to fate!<BR>
Let others better mold the running mass<BR>
Of metals, and inform the breathing brass,<BR>
And soften into flesh a marble face;<BR>
Plead better at the bar; describe the skies,<BR>
And when the stars descend, and when they rise.<BR>
But, Rome, 't is thine alone, with awful sway,<BR>
To rule mankind, and make the world obey,<BR>
Disposing peace and war by thy own majestic way;<BR>
To tame the proud, the fetter'd slave to free:<BR>
These are imperial arts, and worthy thee."</P>
<P>He paus'd; and, while with wond'ring eyes they view'd<BR>
The passing spirits, thus his speech renew'd:<BR>
"See great Marcellus! how, untir'd in toils,<BR>
He moves with manly grace, how rich with regal spoils!<BR>
He, when his country, threaten'd with alarms,<BR>
Requires his courage and his conqu'ring arms,<BR>
Shall more than once the Punic bands affright;<BR>
Shall kill the Gaulish king in single fight;<BR>
Then to the Capitol in triumph move,<BR>
And the third spoils shall grace Feretrian Jove."<BR>
Aeneas here beheld, of form divine,<BR>
A godlike youth in glitt'ring armor shine,<BR>
With great Marcellus keeping equal pace;<BR>
But gloomy were his eyes, dejected was his face.<BR>
He saw, and, wond'ring, ask'd his airy guide,<BR>
What and of whence was he, who press'd the hero's side:<BR>
"His son, or one of his illustrious name?<BR>
How like the former, and almost the same!<BR>
Observe the crowds that compass him around;<BR>
All gaze, and all admire, and raise a shouting sound:<BR>
But hov'ring mists around his brows are spread,<BR>
And night, with sable shades, involves his head."<BR>
"Seek not to know," the ghost replied with tears,<BR>
"The sorrows of thy sons in future years.<BR>
This youth (the blissful vision of a day)<BR>
Shall just be shown on earth, and snatch'd away.<BR>
The gods too high had rais'd the Roman state,<BR>
Were but their gifts as permanent as great.<BR>
What groans of men shall fill the Martian field!<BR>
How fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield!<BR>
What fun'ral pomp shall floating Tiber see,<BR>
When, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity!<BR>
No youth shall equal hopes of glory give,<BR>
No youth afford so great a cause to grieve;<BR>
The Trojan honor, and the Roman boast,<BR>
Admir'd when living, and ador'd when lost!<BR>
Mirror of ancient faith in early youth!<BR>
Undaunted worth, inviolable truth!<BR>
No foe, unpunish'd, in the fighting field<BR>
Shall dare thee, foot to foot, with sword and shield;<BR>
Much less in arms oppose thy matchless force,<BR>
When thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse.<BR>
Ah! couldst thou break thro' fate's severe decree,<BR>
A new Marcellus shall arise in thee!<BR>
Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring,<BR>
Mix'd with the purple roses of the spring;<BR>
Let me with fun'ral flow'rs his body strow;<BR>
This gift which parents to their children owe,<BR>
This unavailing gift, at least, I may bestow!"<BR>
Thus having said, he led the hero round<BR>
The confines of the blest Elysian ground;<BR>
Which when Anchises to his son had shown,<BR>
And fir'd his mind to mount the promis'd throne,<BR>
He tells the future wars, ordain'd by fate;<BR>
The strength and customs of the Latian state;<BR>
The prince, and people; and forearms his care<BR>
With rules, to push his fortune, or to bear.</P>
<P>Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn;<BR>
Of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn:<BR>
True visions thro' transparent horn arise;<BR>
Thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies.<BR>
Of various things discoursing as he pass'd,<BR>
Anchises hither bends his steps at last.<BR>
Then, thro' the gate of iv'ry, he dismiss'd<BR>
His valiant offspring and divining guest.<BR>
Straight to the ships Aeneas his way,<BR>
Embark'd his men, and skimm'd along the sea,<BR>
Still coasting, till he gain'd Cajeta's bay.<BR>
At length on oozy ground his galleys moor;<BR>
Their heads are turn'd to sea, their sterns to shore.</P>
