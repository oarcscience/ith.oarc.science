<P>Scarce had the rosy Morning rais'd her head<BR>
Above the waves, and left her wat'ry bed;<BR>
The pious chief, whom double cares attend<BR>
For his unburied soldiers and his friend,<BR>
Yet first to Heav'n perform'd a victor's vows:<BR>
He bar'd an ancient oak of all her boughs;<BR>
Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac'd,<BR>
Which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac'd.<BR>
The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn,<BR>
Now on a naked snag in triumph borne,<BR>
Was hung on high, and glitter'd from afar,<BR>
A trophy sacred to the God of War.<BR>
Above his arms, fix'd on the leafless wood,<BR>
Appear'd his plumy crest, besmear'd with blood:<BR>
His brazen buckler on the left was seen;<BR>
Truncheons of shiver'd lances hung between;<BR>
And on the right was placed his corslet, bor'd;<BR>
And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword.</P>
<P>A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man,<BR>
Who thus, conspicuous in the midst, began:<BR>
"Our toils, my friends, are crown'd with sure success;<BR>
The greater part perform'd, achieve the less.<BR>
Now follow cheerful to the trembling town;<BR>
Press but an entrance, and presume it won.<BR>
Fear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies,<BR>
As the first fruits of war, a sacrifice.<BR>
Turnus shall fall extended on the plain,<BR>
And, in this omen, is already slain.<BR>
Prepar'd in arms, pursue your happy chance;<BR>
That none unwarn'd may plead his ignorance,<BR>
And I, at Heav'n's appointed hour, may find<BR>
Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind.<BR>
Meantime the rites and fun'ral pomps prepare,<BR>
Due to your dead companions of the war:<BR>
The last respect the living can bestow,<BR>
To shield their shadows from contempt below.<BR>
That conquer'd earth be theirs, for which they fought,<BR>
And which for us with their own blood they bought;<BR>
But first the corpse of our unhappy friend<BR>
To the sad city of Evander send,<BR>
Who, not inglorious, in his age's bloom,<BR>
Was hurried hence by too severe a doom."</P>
<P>Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,<BR>
Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay.<BR>
Acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd<BR>
The father's trust; and now the son he serv'd<BR>
With equal faith, but less auspicious care.<BR>
Th' attendants of the slain his sorrow share.<BR>
A troop of Trojans mix'd with these appear,<BR>
And mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair.<BR>
Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry;<BR>
All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky.<BR>
They rear his drooping forehead from the ground;<BR>
But, when Aeneas view'd the grisly wound<BR>
Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore,<BR>
And the fair flesh distain'd with purple gore;<BR>
First, melting into tears, the pious man<BR>
Deplor'd so sad a sight, then thus began:<BR>
"Unhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest<BR>
Of my full wishes, she refus'd the best!<BR>
She came; but brought not thee along, to bless<BR>
My longing eyes, and share in my success:<BR>
She grudg'd thy safe return, the triumphs due<BR>
To prosp'rous valor, in the public view.<BR>
Not thus I promis'd, when thy father lent<BR>
Thy needless succor with a sad consent;<BR>
Embrac'd me, parting for th' Etrurian land,<BR>
And sent me to possess a large command.<BR>
He warn'd, and from his own experience told,<BR>
Our foes were warlike, disciplin'd, and bold.<BR>
And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return,<BR>
Rich odors on his loaded altars burn,<BR>
While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare<BR>
To send him back his portion of the war,<BR>
A bloody breathless body, which can owe<BR>
No farther debt, but to the pow'rs below.<BR>
The wretched father, ere his race is run,<BR>
Shall view the fun'ral honors of his son.<BR>
These are my triumphs of the Latian war,<BR>
Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!<BR>
And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see<BR>
A son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry;<BR>
Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd:<BR>
Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd.<BR>
He died no death to make thee wish, too late,<BR>
Thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate:<BR>
But what a champion has th' Ausonian coast,<BR>
And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!"</P>
<P>Thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around,<BR>
To raise the breathless body from the ground;<BR>
And chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all<BR>
His warlike troops, to wait the funeral,<BR>
To bear him back and share Evander's grief:<BR>
A well-becoming, but a weak relief.<BR>
Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,<BR>
Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear.<BR>
The body on this rural hearse is borne:<BR>
Strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.<BR>
All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow'r,<BR>
New cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r:<BR>
Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below,<BR>
No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe.<BR>
Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost,<BR>
Of purple woven, and with gold emboss'd,<BR>
For ornament the Trojan hero brought,<BR>
Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought.<BR>
One vest array'd the corpse; and one they spread<BR>
O'er his clos'd eyes, and wrapp'd around his head,<BR>
That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall,<BR>
The catching fire might burn the golden caul.<BR>
Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain,<BR>
When he descended on the Latian plain;<BR>
Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led<BR>
In long array- th' achievements of the dead.<BR>
Then, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear<BR>
Th' unhappy captives, marching in the rear,<BR>
Appointed off'rings in the victor's name,<BR>
To sprinkle with their blood the fun'ral flame.<BR>
Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne;<BR>
Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn;<BR>
And fair inscriptions fix'd, and titles read<BR>
Of Latian leaders conquer'd by the dead.</P>
<P>Acoetes on his pupil's corpse attends,<BR>
With feeble steps, supported by his friends.<BR>
Pausing at ev'ry pace, in sorrow drown'd,<BR>
Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground;<BR>
Where grov'ling while he lies in deep despair,<BR>
He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair.<BR>
The champion's chariot next is seen to roll,<BR>
Besmear'd with hostile blood, and honorably foul.<BR>
To close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state,<BR>
Is led, the fun'rals of his lord to wait.<BR>
Stripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace<BR>
He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face.<BR>
The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,<BR>
Are borne behind: the victor seiz'd the rest.<BR>
The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound;<BR>
The pikes and lances trail along the ground.<BR>
Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse<BR>
To Pallantean tow'rs direct their course,<BR>
In long procession rank'd, the pious chief<BR>
Stopp'd in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:<BR>
"The public care," he said, "which war attends,<BR>
Diverts our present woes, at least suspends.<BR>
Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!<BR>
Hail, holy relics! and a last farewell!"<BR>
He said no more, but, inly thro' he mourn'd,<BR>
Restrained his tears, and to the camp return'd.</P>
<P>Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand<BR>
A truce, with olive branches in their hand;<BR>
Obtest his clemency, and from the plain<BR>
Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain.<BR>
They plead, that none those common rites deny<BR>
To conquer'd foes that in fair battle die.<BR>
All cause of hate was ended in their death;<BR>
Nor could he war with bodies void of breath.<BR>
A king, they hop'd, would hear a king's request,<BR>
Whose son he once was call'd, and once his guest.</P>
<P>Their suit, which was too just to be denied,<BR>
The hero grants, and farther thus replied:<BR>
"O Latian princes, how severe a fate<BR>
In causeless quarrels has involv'd your state,<BR>
And arm'd against an unoffending man,<BR>
Who sought your friendship ere the war began!<BR>
You beg a truce, which I would gladly give,<BR>
Not only for the slain, but those who live.<BR>
I came not hither but by Heav'n's command,<BR>
And sent by fate to share the Latian land.<BR>
Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied<BR>
My proffer'd friendship, and my promis'd bride;<BR>
Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try<BR>
His cause in arms, to conquer or to die.<BR>
My right and his are in dispute: the slain<BR>
Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.<BR>
In equal arms let us alone contend;<BR>
And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend.<BR>
This is the way (so tell him) to possess<BR>
The royal virgin, and restore the peace.<BR>
Bear this message back, with ample leave,<BR>
That your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive."</P>
<P>Thus having said- th' embassadors, amaz'd,<BR>
Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz'd.<BR>
Drances, their chief, who harbor'd in his breast<BR>
Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess'd,<BR>
Broke silence first, and to the godlike man,<BR>
With graceful action bowing, thus began:<BR>
"Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name,<BR>
But yet whose actions far transcend your fame;<BR>
Would I your justice or your force express,<BR>
Thought can but equal; and all words are less.<BR>
Your answer we shall thankfully relate,<BR>
And favors granted to the Latian state.<BR>
If wish'd success our labor shall attend,<BR>
Think peace concluded, and the king your friend:<BR>
Let Turnus leave the realm to your command,<BR>
And seek alliance in some other land:<BR>
Build you the city which your fates assign;<BR>
We shall be proud in the great work to join."</P>
<P>Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade<BR>
The rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made.<BR>
Twelve days the term allow'd: and, during those,<BR>
Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes,<BR>
Mix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare<BR>
To fell the timber, and forget the war.<BR>
Loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound;<BR>
Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;<BR>
First fall from high; and some the trunks receive<BR>
In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.</P>
<P>And now the fatal news by Fame is blown<BR>
Thro' the short circuit of th' Arcadian town,<BR>
Of Pallas slain- by Fame, which just before<BR>
His triumphs on distended pinions bore.<BR>
Rushing from out the gate, the people stand,<BR>
Each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand.<BR>
Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:<BR>
The fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze,<BR>
That cast a sullen splendor on their friends,<BR>
The marching troop which their dead prince attends.<BR>
Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;<BR>
The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,<BR>
And their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky.<BR>
The town is fill'd with tumult and with tears,<BR>
Till the loud clamors reach Evander's ears:<BR>
Forgetful of his state, he runs along,<BR>
With a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng;<BR>
Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,<BR>
With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.<BR>
Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks<BR>
A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:</P>
<P>"O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,<BR>
To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!<BR>
I warn'd thee, but in vain; for well I knew<BR>
What perils youthful ardor would pursue,<BR>
That boiling blood would carry thee too far,<BR>
Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!<BR>
O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,<BR>
Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!<BR>
Hard elements of unauspicious war,<BR>
Vain vows to Heav'n, and unavailing care!<BR>
Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed,<BR>
Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled,<BR>
Praescious of ills, and leaving me behind,<BR>
To drink the dregs of life by fate assign'd!<BR>
Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:<BR>
My Pallas late set out, but reach'd too soon.<BR>
If, for my league against th' Ausonian state,<BR>
Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,<BR>
(Deserv'd from them,) then I had been return'd<BR>
A breathless victor, and my son had mourn'd.<BR>
Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid,<BR>
Nor grudge th' alliance I so gladly made.<BR>
'T was not his fault, my Pallas fell so young,<BR>
But my own crime, for having liv'd too long.<BR>
Yet, since the gods had destin'd him to die,<BR>
At least he led the way to victory:<BR>
First for his friends he won the fatal shore,<BR>
And sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before;<BR>
A death too great, too glorious to deplore.<BR>
Nor will I add new honors to thy grave,<BR>
Content with those the Trojan hero gave:<BR>
That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd,<BR>
In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join'd.<BR>
Great spoils and trophies, gain'd by thee, they bear:<BR>
Then let thy own achievements be thy share.<BR>
Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,<BR>
Whose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood,<BR>
If Pallas had arriv'd, with equal length<BR>
Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.<BR>
But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain<BR>
These troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain?<BR>
Go, friends, this message to your lord relate:<BR>
Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate,<BR>
And, after Pallas' death, live ling'ring on,<BR>
'T is to behold his vengeance for my son.<BR>
I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head<BR>
Is owing to the living and the dead.<BR>
My son and I expect it from his hand;<BR>
'T is all that he can give, or we demand.<BR>
Joy is no more; but I would gladly go,<BR>
To greet my Pallas with such news below."</P>
<P>The morn had now dispell'd the shades of night,<BR>
Restoring toils, when she restor'd the light.<BR>
The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command<BR>
To raise the piles along the winding strand.<BR>
Their friends convey the dead fun'ral fires;<BR>
Black smold'ring smoke from the green wood expires;<BR>
The light of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires.<BR>
Then thrice around the kindled piles they go<BR>
(For ancient custom had ordain'd it so)<BR>
Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led;<BR>
And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead.<BR>
Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground,<BR>
And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound.<BR>
Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw<BR>
The spoils, in battle taken from the foe:<BR>
Helms, bits emboss'd, and swords of shining steel;<BR>
One casts a target, one a chariot wheel;<BR>
Some to their fellows their own arms restore:<BR>
The fauchions which in luckless fight they bore,<BR>
Their bucklers pierc'd, their darts bestow'd in vain,<BR>
And shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain.<BR>
Whole herds of offer'd bulls, about the fire,<BR>
And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire.<BR>
Around the piles a careful troop attends,<BR>
To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends;<BR>
Ling'ring along the shore, till dewy night<BR>
New decks the face of heav'n with starry light.</P>
<P>The conquer'd Latians, with like pious care,<BR>
Piles without number for their dead prepare.<BR>
Part in the places where they fell are laid;<BR>
And part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd.<BR>
The corps of kings, and captains of renown,<BR>
Borne off in state, are buried in the town;<BR>
The rest, unhonor'd, and without a name,<BR>
Are cast a common heap to feed the flame.<BR>
Trojans and Latians vie with like desires<BR>
To make the field of battle shine with fires,<BR>
And the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires.</P>
<P>Now had the morning thrice renew'd the light,<BR>
And thrice dispell'd the shadows of the night,<BR>
When those who round the wasted fires remain,<BR>
Perform the last sad office to the slain.<BR>
They rake the yet warm ashes from below;<BR>
These, and the bones unburn'd, in earth bestow;<BR>
These relics with their country rites they grace,<BR>
And raise a mount of turf to mark the place.</P>
<P>But, in the palace of the king, appears<BR>
A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears.<BR>
Maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans;<BR>
Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons.<BR>
All in that universal sorrow share,<BR>
And curse the cause of this unhappy war:<BR>
A broken league, a bride unjustly sought,<BR>
A crown usurp'd, which with their blood is bought!<BR>
These are the crimes with which they load the name<BR>
Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim:<BR>
"Let him who lords it o'er th' Ausonian land<BR>
Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand:<BR>
His is the gain; our lot is but to serve;<BR>
'T is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve."<BR>
This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite:<BR>
"His foe expects, and dares him to the fight."<BR>
Nor Turnus wants a party, to support<BR>
His cause and credit in the Latian court.<BR>
His former acts secure his present fame,<BR>
And the queen shades him with her mighty name.</P>
<P>While thus their factious minds with fury burn,<BR>
The legates from th' Aetolian prince return:<BR>
Sad news they bring, that, after all the cost<BR>
And care employ'd, their embassy is lost;<BR>
That Diomedes refus'd his aid in war,<BR>
Unmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r.<BR>
Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought,<BR>
Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought.</P>
<P>Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late,<BR>
A foreign son is pointed out by fate;<BR>
And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed,<BR>
The wrath of Heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head.<BR>
The gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side,<BR>
When late their titles in the field were tried:<BR>
Witness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears undried.<BR>
Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all<BR>
The Latian senate to the council hall.<BR>
The princes come, commanded by their head,<BR>
And crowd the paths that to the palace lead.<BR>
Supreme in pow'r, and reverenc'd for his years,<BR>
He takes the throne, and in the midst appears.<BR>
Majestically sad, he sits in state,<BR>
And bids his envoys their success relate.</P>
<P>When Venulus began, the murmuring sound<BR>
Was hush'd, and sacred silence reign'd around.<BR>
"We have," said he, "perform'd your high command,<BR>
And pass'd with peril a long tract of land:<BR>
We reach'd the place desir'd; with wonder fill'd,<BR>
The Grecian tents and rising tow'rs beheld.<BR>
Great Diomede has compass'd round with walls<BR>
The city, which Argyripa he calls,<BR>
From his own Argos nam'd. We touch'd, with joy,<BR>
The royal hand that raz'd unhappy Troy.<BR>
When introduc'd, our presents first we bring,<BR>
Then crave an instant audience from the king.<BR>
His leave obtain'd, our native soil we name,<BR>
And tell th' important cause for which we came.<BR>
Attentively he heard us, while we spoke;<BR>
Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look,<BR>
Made this return: 'Ausonian race, of old<BR>
Renown'd for peace, and for an age of gold,<BR>
What madness has your alter'd minds possess'd,<BR>
To change for war hereditary rest,<BR>
Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword,<BR>
A needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd?<BR>
We- for myself I speak, and all the name<BR>
Of Grecians, who to Troy's destruction came,<BR>
Omitting those who were in battle slain,<BR>
Or borne by rolling Simois to the main-<BR>
Not one but suffer'd, and too dearly bought<BR>
The prize of honor which in arms he sought;<BR>
Some doom'd to death, and some in exile driv'n.<BR>
Outcasts, abandon'd by the care of Heav'n;<BR>
So worn, so wretched, so despis'd a crew,<BR>
As ev'n old Priam might with pity view.<BR>
Witness the vessels by Minerva toss'd<BR>
In storms; the vengeful Capharean coast;<BR>
Th' Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led<BR>
Our armies to revenge his injur'd bed,<BR>
In Egypt lost! Ulysses with his men<BR>
Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops' den.<BR>
Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain<BR>
Restor'd to scepters, and expell'd again?<BR>
Or young Achilles, by his rival slain?<BR>
Ev'n he, the King of Men, the foremost name<BR>
Of all the Greeks, and most renown'd by fame,<BR>
The proud revenger of another's wife,<BR>
Yet by his own adult'ress lost his life;<BR>
Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy<BR>
The foul polluters of his bed enjoy.<BR>
The gods have envied me the sweets of life,<BR>
My much lov'd country, and my more lov'd wife:<BR>
Banish'd from both, I mourn; while in the sky,<BR>
Transform'd to birds, my lost companions fly:<BR>
Hov'ring about the coasts, they make their moan,<BR>
And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own.<BR>
What squalid specters, in the dead of night,<BR>
Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight!<BR>
I might have promis'd to myself those harms,<BR>
Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms,<BR>
Presum'd against immortal pow'rs to move,<BR>
And violate with wounds the Queen of Love.<BR>
Such arms this hand shall never more employ;<BR>
No hate remains with me to ruin'd Troy.<BR>
I war not with its dust; nor am I glad<BR>
To think of past events, or good or bad.<BR>
Your presents I return: whate'er you bring<BR>
To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king.<BR>
We met in fight; I know him, to my cost:<BR>
With what a whirling force his lance he toss'd!<BR>
Heav'ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw!<BR>
How high he held his shield, and rose at ev'ry blow!<BR>
Had Troy produc'd two more his match in might,<BR>
They would have chang'd the fortune of the fight:<BR>
Th' invasion of the Greeks had been return'd,<BR>
Our empire wasted, and our cities burn'd.<BR>
The long defense the Trojan people made,<BR>
The war protracted, and the siege delay'd,<BR>
Were due to Hector's and this hero's hand:<BR>
Both brave alike, and equal in command;<BR>
Aeneas, not inferior in the field,<BR>
In pious reverence to the gods excell'd.<BR>
Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care<BR>
Th' impending dangers of a fatal war.'<BR>
He said no more; but, with this cold excuse,<BR>
Refus'd th' alliance, and advis'd a truce."</P>
<P>Thus Venulus concluded his report.<BR>
A jarring murmur fill'd the factious court:<BR>
As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force,<BR>
And dashes o'er the stones that stop the course,<BR>
The flood, constrain'd within a scanty space,<BR>
Roars horrible along th' uneasy race;<BR>
White foam in gath'ring eddies floats around;<BR>
The rocky shores rebellow to the sound.</P>
<P>The murmur ceas'd: then from his lofty throne<BR>
The king invok'd the gods, and thus begun:<BR>
"I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate<BR>
Had been resolv'd before it was too late.<BR>
Much better had it been for you and me,<BR>
Unforc'd by this our last necessity,<BR>
To have been earlier wise, than now to call<BR>
A council, when the foe surrounds the wall.<BR>
O citizens, we wage unequal war,<BR>
With men not only Heav'n's peculiar care,<BR>
But Heav'n's own race; unconquer'd in the field,<BR>
Or, conquer'd, yet unknowing how to yield.<BR>
What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down:<BR>
Our hopes must center on ourselves alone.<BR>
Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain,<BR>
You see too well; nor need my words explain.<BR>
Vanquish'd without resource; laid flat by fate;<BR>
Factions within, a foe without the gate!<BR>
Not but I grant that all perform'd their parts<BR>
With manly force, and with undaunted hearts:<BR>
With our united strength the war we wag'd;<BR>
With equal numbers, equal arms, engag'd.<BR>
You see th' event.- Now hear what I propose,<BR>
To save our friends, and satisfy our foes.<BR>
A tract of land the Latins have possess'd<BR>
Along the Tiber, stretching to the west,<BR>
Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till,<BR>
And their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill.<BR>
Those mountains fill'd with firs, that lower land,<BR>
If you consent, the Trojan shall command,<BR>
Call'd into part of what is ours; and there,<BR>
On terms agreed, the common country share.<BR>
There let'em build and settle, if they please;<BR>
Unless they choose once more to cross the seas,<BR>
In search of seats remote from Italy,<BR>
And from unwelcome inmates set us free.<BR>
Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed,<BR>
Or twice as many more, if more they need.<BR>
Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood<BR>
Runs equal with the margin of the flood:<BR>
Let them the number and the form assign;<BR>
The care and cost of all the stores be mine.<BR>
To treat the peace, a hundred senators<BR>
Shall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs,<BR>
With olive the presents they shall bear,<BR>
A purple robe, a royal iv'ry chair,<BR>
And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear,<BR>
And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate<BR>
This great affair, and save the sinking state."</P>
<P>Then Drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since,<BR>
The rising glories of the Daunian prince.<BR>
Factious and rich, bold at the council board,<BR>
But cautious in the field, he shunn'd the sword;<BR>
A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord.<BR>
Noble his mother was, and near the throne;<BR>
But, what his father's parentage, unknown.<BR>
He rose, and took th' advantage of the times,<BR>
To load young Turnus with invidious crimes.<BR>
"Such truths, O king," said he, "your words contain,<BR>
As strike the sense, and all replies are vain;<BR>
Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek<BR>
What common needs require, but fear to speak.<BR>
Let him give leave of speech, that haughty man,<BR>
Whose pride this unauspicious war began;<BR>
For whose ambition (let me dare to say,<BR>
Fear set apart, tho' death is in my way)<BR>
The plains of Latium run with blood around.<BR>
So many valiant heroes bite the ground;<BR>
Dejected grief in ev'ry face appears;<BR>
A town in mourning, and a land in tears;<BR>
While he, th' undoubted author of our harms,<BR>
The man who menaces the gods with arms,<BR>
Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight,<BR>
And sought his safety in ignoble flight.<BR>
Now, best of kings, since you propose to send<BR>
Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend;<BR>
Add yet a greater at our joint request,<BR>
One which he values more than all the rest:<BR>
Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride;<BR>
With that alliance let the league be tied,<BR>
And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide.<BR>
Let insolence no longer awe the throne;<BR>
But, with a father's right, bestow your own.<BR>
For this maligner of the general good,<BR>
If still we fear his force, he must be woo'd;<BR>
His haughty godhead we with pray'rs implore,<BR>
Your scepter to release, and our just rights restore.<BR>
O cursed cause of all our ills, must we<BR>
Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee!<BR>
What right hast thou to rule the Latian state,<BR>
And send us out to meet our certain fate?<BR>
'T is a destructive war: from Turnus' hand<BR>
Our peace and public safety we demand.<BR>
Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain;<BR>
If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain.<BR>
Turnus, I know you think me not your friend,<BR>
Nor will I much with your belief contend:<BR>
I beg your greatness not to give the law<BR>
In others' realms, but, beaten, to withdraw.<BR>
Pity your own, or pity our estate;<BR>
Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate.<BR>
Your interest is, the war should never cease;<BR>
But we have felt enough to wish the peace:<BR>
A land exhausted to the last remains,<BR>
Depopulated towns, and driven plains.<BR>
Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow'r,<BR>
A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow'r,<BR>
So fire your mind, in arms assert your right,<BR>
And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight.<BR>
Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone;<BR>
We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne:<BR>
A base ignoble crowd, without a name,<BR>
Unwept, unworthy, of the fun'ral flame,<BR>
By duty bound to forfeit each his life,<BR>
That Turnus may possess a royal wife.<BR>
Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew<BR>
Should share such triumphs, and detain from you<BR>
The post of honor, your undoubted due.<BR>
Rather alone your matchless force employ,<BR>
To merit what alone you must enjoy."</P>
<P>These words, so full of malice mix'd with art,<BR>
Inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart.<BR>
Then, groaning from the bottom of his breast,<BR>
He heav'd for wind, and thus his wrath express'd:<BR>
"You, Drances, never want a stream of words,<BR>
Then, when the public need requires our swords.<BR>
First in the council hall to steer the state,<BR>
And ever foremost in a tongue-debate,<BR>
While our strong walls secure us from the foe,<BR>
Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow:<BR>
But let the potent orator declaim,<BR>
And with the brand of coward blot my name;<BR>
Free leave is giv'n him, when his fatal hand<BR>
Has cover'd with more corps the sanguine strand,<BR>
And high as mine his tow'ring trophies stand.<BR>
If any doubt remains, who dares the most,<BR>
Let us decide it at the Trojan's cost,<BR>
And issue both abreast, where honor calls-<BR>
Foes are not far to seek without the walls-<BR>
Unless his noisy tongue can only fight,<BR>
And feet were giv'n him but to speed his flight.<BR>
I beaten from the field? I forc'd away?<BR>
Who, but so known a dastard, dares to say?<BR>
Had he but ev'n beheld the fight, his eyes<BR>
Had witness'd for me what his tongue denies:<BR>
What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain,<BR>
And how the bloody Tiber swell'd the main.<BR>
All saw, but he, th' Arcadian troops retire<BR>
In scatter'd squadrons, and their prince expire.<BR>
The giant brothers, in their camp, have found,<BR>
I was not forc'd with ease to quit my ground.<BR>
Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos'd,<BR>
I singly their united arms oppos'd:<BR>
First forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array;<BR>
Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way.<BR>
'T is a destructive war? So let it be,<BR>
But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee!<BR>
Meantime proceed to fill the people's ears<BR>
With false reports, their minds with panic fears:<BR>
Extol the strength of a twice-conquer'd race;<BR>
Our foes encourage, and our friends debase.<BR>
Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town<BR>
Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o'erthrown;<BR>
Suppliant at Hector's feet Achilles lies,<BR>
And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies.<BR>
Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread<BR>
Runs backward from the sea, and hides his head,<BR>
When the great Trojan on his bank appears;<BR>
For that's as true as thy dissembled fears<BR>
Of my revenge. Dismiss that vanity:<BR>
Thou, Drances, art below a death from me.<BR>
Let that vile soul in that vile body rest;<BR>
The lodging is well worthy of the guest.</P>
<P>"Now, royal father, to the present state<BR>
Of our affairs, and of this high debate:<BR>
If in your arms thus early you diffide,<BR>
And think your fortune is already tried;<BR>
If one defeat has brought us down so low,<BR>
As never more in fields to meet the foe;<BR>
Then I conclude for peace: 't is time to treat,<BR>
And lie like vassals at the victor's feet.<BR>
But, O! if any ancient blood remains,<BR>
One drop of all our fathers', in our veins,<BR>
That man would I prefer before the rest,<BR>
Who dar'd his death with an undaunted breast;<BR>
Who comely fell, by no dishonest wound,<BR>
To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw'd the ground.<BR>
But, if we still have fresh recruits in store,<BR>
If our confederates can afford us more;<BR>
If the contended field we bravely fought,<BR>
And not a bloodless victory was bought;<BR>
Their losses equal'd ours; and, for their slain,<BR>
With equal fires they fill'd the shining plain;<BR>
Why thus, unforc'd, should we so tamely yield,<BR>
And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field?<BR>
Good unexpected, evils unforeseen,<BR>
Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene:<BR>
Some, rais'd aloft, come tumbling down amain;<BR>
Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again.<BR>
If Diomede refuse his aid to lend,<BR>
The great Messapus yet remains our friend:<BR>
Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours;<BR>
Th' Italian chiefs and princes join their pow'rs:<BR>
Nor least in number, nor in name the last,<BR>
Your own brave subjects have your cause embrac'd<BR>
Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon<BR>
Contains an army in herself alone,<BR>
And heads a squadron, terrible to sight,<BR>
With glitt'ring shields, in brazen armor bright.<BR>
Yet, if the foe a single fight demand,<BR>
And I alone the public peace withstand;<BR>
If you consent, he shall not be refus'd,<BR>
Nor find a hand to victory unus'd.<BR>
This new Achilles, let him take the field,<BR>
With fated armor, and Vulcanian shield!<BR>
For you, my royal father, and my fame,<BR>
I, Turnus, not the least of all my name,<BR>
Devote my soul. He calls me hand to hand,<BR>
And I alone will answer his demand.<BR>
Drances shall rest secure, and neither share<BR>
The danger, nor divide the prize of war."</P>
<P>While they debate, nor these nor those will yield,<BR>
Aeneas draws his forces to the field,<BR>
And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed<BR>
Return, and thro' the frighted city spread<BR>
Th' unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried,<BR>
In battle marching by the river side,<BR>
And bending to the town. They take th' alarm:<BR>
Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm.<BR>
Th' impetuous youth press forward to the field;<BR>
They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield:<BR>
The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry;<BR>
Old feeble men with fainter groans reply;<BR>
A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,<BR>
Like that of swans remurm'ring to the floods,<BR>
Or birds of diff'ring kinds in hollow woods.</P>
<P>Turnus th' occasion takes, and cries aloud:<BR>
"Talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd:<BR>
Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls,<BR>
And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls."<BR>
He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace,<BR>
Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place:<BR>
"Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command<BR>
To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band.<BR>
Messapus and Catillus, post your force<BR>
Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse.<BR>
Some guard the passes, others man the wall;<BR>
Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call."</P>
<P>They swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town,<BR>
And with disorder'd haste the rampires crown.<BR>
Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late,<BR>
The gath'ring storm just breaking on the state,<BR>
Dismiss'd the council till a fitter time,<BR>
And own'd his easy temper as his crime,<BR>
Who, forc'd against his reason, had complied<BR>
To break the treaty for the promis'd bride.</P>
<P>Some help to sink new trenches; others aid<BR>
To ram the stones, or raise the palisade.<BR>
Hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls<BR>
Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls.<BR>
A sad procession in the streets is seen,<BR>
Of matrons, that attend the mother queen:<BR>
High in her chair she sits, and, at her side,<BR>
With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride.<BR>
They mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple stands;<BR>
Pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,<BR>
With censers first they fume the sacred shrine,<BR>
Then in this common supplication join:<BR>
"O patroness of arms, unspotted maid,<BR>
Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid!<BR>
Break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate,<BR>
And lay the Phrygian low before the gate."</P>
<P>Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast<BR>
Well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest:<BR>
The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold<BR>
Are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold.<BR>
His faithful fauchion sits upon his side;<BR>
Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide:<BR>
But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends,<BR>
With godlike grace, he from the tow'r descends.<BR>
Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare<BR>
His absent rival, and to promise war.<BR>
Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins,<BR>
The wanton courser prances o'er the plains,<BR>
Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds,<BR>
And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds.<BR>
Or seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood,<BR>
To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood:<BR>
He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain,<BR>
And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane:<BR>
He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;<BR>
Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly.</P>
<P>Soon as the prince appears without the gate,<BR>
The Volscians, with their virgin leader, wait<BR>
His last commands. Then, with a graceful mien,<BR>
Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen:<BR>
Her squadron imitates, and each descends;<BR>
Whose common suit Camilla thus commends:<BR>
"If sense of honor, if a soul secure<BR>
Of inborn worth, that can all tests endure,<BR>
Can promise aught, or on itself rely<BR>
Greatly to dare, to conquer or to die;<BR>
Then, I alone, sustain'd by these, will meet<BR>
The Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat.<BR>
Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown:<BR>
You, gen'ral, stay behind, and guard the town:"</P>
<P>Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,<BR>
And on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes;<BR>
Then thus return'd: "O grace of Italy,<BR>
With what becoming thanks can I reply?<BR>
Not only words lie lab'ring in my breast,<BR>
But thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd.<BR>
Yet rob me not of all; but let me join<BR>
My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine.<BR>
The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd,<BR>
Sends his light horse before to scour the field:<BR>
Himself, thro' steep ascents and thorny brakes,<BR>
A larger compass to the city takes.<BR>
This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare<BR>
To foil his cunning, and his force to dare;<BR>
With chosen foot his passage to forelay,<BR>
And place an ambush in the winding way.<BR>
Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse;<BR>
The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce<BR>
With those of Tibur, and the Latian band,<BR>
Subjected all to thy supreme command."<BR>
This said, he warns Messapus to the war,<BR>
Then ev'ry chief exhorts with equal care.<BR>
All thus encourag'd, his own troops he joins,<BR>
And hastes to prosecute his deep designs.</P>
<P>Inclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies,<BR>
By nature form'd for fraud, and fitted for surprise.<BR>
A narrow track, by human steps untrode,<BR>
Leads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode.<BR>
High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands,<BR>
Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands.<BR>
The top is level, an offensive seat<BR>
Of war; and from the war a safe retreat:<BR>
For, on the right and left, is room to press<BR>
The foes at hand, or from afar distress;<BR>
To drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour<BR>
On their descending backs a stony show'r.<BR>
Thither young Turnus took the well-known way,<BR>
Possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay.</P>
<P>Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies,<BR>
Beheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes,<BR>
And call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid,<BR>
Her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid;<BR>
Then with a sigh began: "Camilla goes<BR>
To meet her death amidst her fatal foes:<BR>
The nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train,<BR>
Invested with Diana's arms, in vain.<BR>
Nor is my kindness for the virgin new:<BR>
'T was born with her; and with her years it grew.<BR>
Her father Metabus, when forc'd away<BR>
From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway,<BR>
Snatch'd up, and sav'd from his prevailing foes,<BR>
This tender babe, companion of his woes.<BR>
Casmilla was her mother; but he drown'd<BR>
One hissing letter in a softer sound,<BR>
And call'd Camilla. Thro' the woods he flies;<BR>
Wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies.<BR>
His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace;<BR>
With shout and clamors they pursue the chase.<BR>
The banks of Amasene at length he gains:</P>
<P>The raging flood his farther flight restrains,<BR>
Rais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains.<BR>
Prepar'd to plunge into the stream, he fears,<BR>
Not for himself, but for the charge he bears.<BR>
Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste;<BR>
Then, desp'rate in distress, resolves at last.<BR>
A knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore;<BR>
The middle part with cork he cover'd o'er:<BR>
He clos'd the child within the hollow space;<BR>
With twigs of bending osier bound the case;<BR>
Then pois'd the spear, heavy with human weight,<BR>
And thus invok'd my favor for the freight:<BR>
'Accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said,<BR>
'Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!<BR>
Thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine;<BR>
And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.'<BR>
He said; and with full force the spear he threw:<BR>
Above the sounding waves Camilla flew.<BR>
Then, press'd by foes, he stemm'd the stormy tide,<BR>
And gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side.<BR>
His fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground,<BR>
And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound;<BR>
Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose,<BR>
Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;<BR>
But, rough, in open air he chose to lie;<BR>
Earth was his couch, his cov'ring was the sky.<BR>
On hills unshorn, or in a desart den,<BR>
He shunn'd the dire society of men.<BR>
A shepherd's solitary life he led;<BR>
His daughter with the milk of mares he fed.<BR>
The dugs of bears, and ev'ry salvage beast,<BR>
He drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd.<BR>
The little Amazon could scarcely go:<BR>
He loads her with a quiver and a bow;<BR>
And, that she might her stagg'ring steps command,<BR>
He with a slender jav'lin fills her hand.<BR>
Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound;<BR>
Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.<BR>
Instead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread<BR>
Her back and shoulders, fasten'd to her head.<BR>
The flying dart she first attempts to fling,<BR>
And round her tender temples toss'd the sling;<BR>
Then, as her strength with years increas'd, began<BR>
To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan,<BR>
And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.<BR>
The Tuscan matrons with each other vied,<BR>
To bless their rival sons with such a bride;<BR>
But she disdains their love, to share with me<BR>
The sylvan shades and vow'd virginity.<BR>
And, O! I wish, contented with my cares<BR>
Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!<BR>
Then had she been of my celestial train,<BR>
And shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain.<BR>
But since, opposing Heav'n's decree, she goes<BR>
To find her death among forbidden foes,<BR>
Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight.<BR>
Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight.<BR>
This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath,<BR>
This chosen arrow, to revenge her death:<BR>
By whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain,<BR>
Or of the Trojan or Italian train,<BR>
Let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain.<BR>
Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid<BR>
To bear the breathless body of my maid:<BR>
Unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd<BR>
Her holy limbs with any human hand,<BR>
And in a marble tomb laid in her native land."</P>
<P>She said. The faithful nymph descends from high<BR>
With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky:<BR>
Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly.</P>
<P>By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse,<BR>
Drawn up in squadrons, with united force,<BR>
Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound,<BR>
Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground.<BR>
Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far;<BR>
And the fields glitter with a waving war.<BR>
Oppos'd to these, come on with furious force<BR>
Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse;<BR>
These in the body plac'd, on either hand<BR>
Sustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla's band.<BR>
Advancing in a line, they couch their spears;<BR>
And less and less the middle space appears.<BR>
Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen<BR>
The neighing coursers, and the shouting men.<BR>
In distance of their darts they stop their course;<BR>
Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.<BR>
The face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide,<BR>
And deaths unseen are dealt on either side.<BR>
Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear,<BR>
By mettled coursers borne in full career,<BR>
Meet first oppos'd; and, with a mighty shock,<BR>
Their horses' heads against each other knock.<BR>
Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast,<BR>
As with an engine's force, or lightning's blast:<BR>
He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last.<BR>
The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright,<BR>
And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight<BR>
Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew;<BR>
Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue,<BR>
And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;<BR>
Till, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about and face,<BR>
Receive their foes, and raise a threat'ning cry.<BR>
The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly.<BR>
So swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar,<BR>
Driv'n on each other's backs, insult the shore,<BR>
Bound o'er the rocks, incroach upon the land,<BR>
And far upon the beach eject the sand;<BR>
Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,<BR>
Repuls'd from upper ground, and seek their mother sea;<BR>
With equal hurry quit th' invaded shore,<BR>
And swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before.</P>
<P>Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field,<BR>
Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repell'd.<BR>
Asham'd at length, to the third charge they ran;<BR>
Both hosts resolv'd, and mingled man to man.<BR>
Now dying groans are heard; the fields are strow'd<BR>
With falling bodies, and are drunk with blood.<BR>
Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie:<BR>
Confus'd the fight, and more confus'd the cry.<BR>
Orsilochus, who durst not press too near<BR>
Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear,<BR>
And stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear.<BR>
The fiery steed, impatient of the wound,<BR>
Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound,<BR>
His helpless lord cast backward on the ground.<BR>
Catillus pierc'd Iolas first; then drew<BR>
His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw,<BR>
The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew.<BR>
His neck and throat unarm'd, his head was bare,<BR>
But shaded with a length of yellow hair:<BR>
Secure, he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part,<BR>
A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart.<BR>
Across the shoulders came the feather'd wound;<BR>
Transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground.<BR>
The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed,<BR>
And death with honor sought on either side.</P>
<P>Resistless thro' the war Camilla rode,<BR>
In danger unappall'd, and pleas'd with blood.<BR>
One side was bare for her exerted breast;<BR>
One shoulder with her painted quiver press'd.<BR>
Now from afar her fatal jav'lins play;<BR>
Now with her ax's edge she hews her way:<BR>
Diana's arms upon her shoulder sound;<BR>
And when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground,<BR>
From her bent bow she sends a backward wound.<BR>
Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side,<BR>
Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride:<BR>
Italians all; in peace, their queen's delight;<BR>
In war, the bold companions of the fight.<BR>
So march'd the Tracian Amazons of old,<BR>
When Thermodon with bloody billows roll'd:<BR>
Such troops as these in shining arms were seen,<BR>
When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen:<BR>
Such to the field Penthisilea led,<BR>
From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled;<BR>
With such, return'd triumphant from the war,<BR>
Her maids with cries attend the lofty car;<BR>
They clash with manly force their moony shields;<BR>
With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields.</P>
<P>Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid,<BR>
On the cold earth were by thy courage laid?<BR>
Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first,<BR>
With fury driv'n, from side to side transpierc'd:<BR>
A purple stream came spouting from the wound;<BR>
Bath'd in his blood he lies, and bites the ground.<BR>
Liris and Pegasus at once she slew:<BR>
The former, as the slacken'd reins he drew<BR>
Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch'd<BR>
His arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd.<BR>
By the same weapon, sent from the same hand,<BR>
Both fall together, and both spurn the sand.<BR>
Amastrus next is added to the slain:<BR>
The rest in rout she follows o'er the plain:<BR>
Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon,<BR>
And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun.<BR>
Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost;<BR>
Each was attended with a Trojan ghost.<BR>
Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed,<BR>
Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed.<BR>
Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown:<BR>
O'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown;<BR>
His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread<BR>
A cov'ring for his cheeks, and grinn'd around his head,<BR>
He clench'd within his hand an iron prong,<BR>
And tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng.<BR>
Him soon she singled from the flying train,<BR>
And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:<BR>
"Vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase<BR>
The savage herd, a vile and trembling race?<BR>
Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory:<BR>
A woman warrior was too strong for thee.<BR>
Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name,<BR>
Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame."<BR>
Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew,<BR>
The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew;<BR>
But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends<BR>
Above the gorget, where his helmet ends,<BR>
And o'er the shield which his left side defends.<BR>
Orsilochus and she their courses ply:<BR>
He seems to follow, and she seems to fly;<BR>
But in a narrower ring she makes the race;<BR>
And then he flies, and she pursues the chase.<BR>
Gath'ring at length on her deluded foe,<BR>
She swings her ax, and rises to the blow<BR>
Full on the helm behind, with such a sway<BR>
The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way:<BR>
He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace;<BR>
Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face.</P>
<P>Astonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance,<BR>
To see his fall; nor farther dares advance;<BR>
But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,<BR>
He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;<BR>
Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat,<BR>
(At least while fortune favor'd his deceit,)<BR>
Cries out aloud: "What courage have you shown,<BR>
Who trust your courser's strength, and not your own?<BR>
Forego the vantage of your horse, alight,<BR>
And then on equal terms begin the fight:<BR>
It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can,<BR>
When, foot to foot, you combat with a man,"<BR>
He said. She glows with anger and disdain,<BR>
Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain,<BR>
And leaves her horse at large among her train;<BR>
With her drawn sword defies him to the field,<BR>
And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield.<BR>
The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed,<BR>
Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed;<BR>
Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides<BR>
The goring rowels in his bleeding sides.<BR>
"Vain fool, and coward!" cries the lofty maid,<BR>
"Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid!<BR>
On others practice thy Ligurian arts;<BR>
Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts<BR>
Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire,<BR>
With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire."<BR>
At this, so fast her flying feet she sped,<BR>
That soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head:<BR>
Then turning short, at once she seiz'd the rein,<BR>
And laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain.<BR>
Not with more ease the falcon, from above,<BR>
Trusses in middle air the trembling dove,<BR>
Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound:<BR>
The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground.</P>
<P>Now mighty Jove, from his superior height,<BR>
With his broad eye surveys th' unequal fight.<BR>
He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain,<BR>
And sends him to redeem th' abandon'd plain.<BR>
Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides,<BR>
And these encourages, and those he chides;<BR>
Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight;<BR>
Renews their ardor, and restores the fight.<BR>
"What panic fear has seiz'd your souls? O shame,<BR>
O brand perpetual of th' Etrurian name!<BR>
Cowards incurable, a woman's hand<BR>
Drives, breaks, and scatters your ignoble band!<BR>
Now cast away the sword, and quit the shield!<BR>
What use of weapons which you dare not wield?<BR>
Not thus you fly your female foes by night,<BR>
Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite;<BR>
When to fat off'rings the glad augur calls,<BR>
And the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals.<BR>
These are your studied cares, your lewd delight:<BR>
Swift to debauch, but slow to manly fight."<BR>
Thus having said, he spurs amid the foes,<BR>
Not managing the life he meant to lose.<BR>
The first he found he seiz'd with headlong haste,<BR>
In his strong gripe, and clasp'd around the waist;<BR>
'T was Venulus, whom from his horse he tore,<BR>
And, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore.<BR>
Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes,<BR>
And view th' unusual sight with vast surprise.<BR>
The fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains,<BR>
Press'd in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains;<BR>
Then, with his shorten'd spear, explores around<BR>
His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound.<BR>
Nor less the captive struggles for his life:<BR>
He writhes his body to prolong the strife,<BR>
And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts<BR>
His utmost vigor, and the point averts.<BR>
So stoops the yellow eagle from on high,<BR>
And bears a speckled serpent thro' the sky,<BR>
Fast'ning his crooked talons on the prey:<BR>
The pris'ner hisses thro' the liquid way;<BR>
Resists the royal hawk; and, tho' oppress'd,<BR>
She fights in volumes, and erects her crest:<BR>
Turn'd to her foe, she stiffens ev'ry scale,<BR>
And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat'ning tail.<BR>
Against the victor, all defense is weak:<BR>
Th' imperial bird still plies her with his beak;<BR>
He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores;<BR>
Then claps his pinions, and securely soars.<BR>
Thus, thro' the midst of circling enemies,<BR>
Strong Tarchon snatch'd and bore away his prize.<BR>
The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press<BR>
The Latins, and presume the like success.</P>
<P>Then Aruns, doom'd to death, his arts assay'd,<BR>
To murther, unespied, the Volscian maid:<BR>
This way and that his winding course he bends,<BR>
And, whereso'er she turns, her steps attends.<BR>
When she retires victorious from the chase,<BR>
He wheels about with care, and shifts his place;<BR>
When, rushing on, she seeks her foes flight,<BR>
He keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight:<BR>
He threats, and trembles, trying ev'ry way,<BR>
Unseen to kill, and safely to betray.<BR>
Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far,<BR>
Glitt'ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war,<BR>
Was by the virgin view'd. The steed he press'd<BR>
Was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest<BR>
With scales of gilded brass was cover'd o'er;<BR>
A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore.<BR>
With deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe;<BR>
Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow:<BR>
A golden helm his front and head surrounds<BR>
A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds.<BR>
Gold, weav'd with linen, on his thighs he wore,<BR>
With flowers of needlework distinguish'd o'er,<BR>
With golden buckles bound, and gather'd up before.<BR>
Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes,<BR>
Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize,<BR>
Or that the temple might his trophies hold,<BR>
Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold.<BR>
Blind in her haste, she chases him alone.<BR>
And seeks his life, regardless of her own.</P>
<P>This lucky moment the sly traitor chose:<BR>
Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose,<BR>
And threw, but first to Heav'n address'd his vows:<BR>
"O patron of Socrates' high abodes,<BR>
Phoebus, the ruling pow'r among the gods,<BR>
Whom first we serve, whole woods of unctuous pine<BR>
Are fell'd for thee, and to thy glory shine;<BR>
By thee protected with our naked soles,<BR>
Thro' flames unsing'd we march, and tread the kindled coals<BR>
Give me, propitious pow'r, to wash away<BR>
The stains of this dishonorable day:<BR>
Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim,<BR>
But with my future actions trust my fame.<BR>
Let me, by stealth, this female plague o'ercome,<BR>
And from the field return inglorious home."<BR>
Apollo heard, and, granting half his pray'r,<BR>
Shuffled in winds the rest, and toss'd in empty air.<BR>
He gives the death desir'd; his safe return<BR>
By southern tempests to the seas is borne.</P>
<P>Now, when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies,<BR>
Both armies on Camilla turn'd their eyes,<BR>
Directed by the sound. Of either host,<BR>
Th' unhappy virgin, tho' concern'd the most,<BR>
Was only deaf; so greedy was she bent<BR>
On golden spoils, and on her prey intent;<BR>
Till in her pap the winged weapon stood<BR>
Infix'd, and deeply drunk the purple blood.<BR>
Her sad attendants hasten to sustain<BR>
Their dying lady, drooping on the plain.<BR>
Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies,<BR>
With beating heart, and fear confus'd with joys;<BR>
Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow,<BR>
Or ev'n to bear the sight of his expiring foe.<BR>
As, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide<BR>
At unawares, or ranch'd a shepherd's side,<BR>
Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies,<BR>
And claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs:<BR>
So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends,<BR>
But, spurring forward, herds among his friends.</P>
<P>She wrench'd the jav'lin with her dying hands,<BR>
But wedg'd within her breast the weapon stands;<BR>
The wood she draws, the steely point remains;<BR>
She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains:<BR>
(A gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes,<BR>
And from her cheeks the rosy color flies:)<BR>
Then turns to her, whom of her female train<BR>
She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain:<BR>
"Acca, 't is past! he swims before my sight,<BR>
Inexorable Death; and claims his right.<BR>
Bear my last words to Turnus; fly with speed,<BR>
And bid him timely to my charge succeed,<BR>
Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve:<BR>
Farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive."<BR>
She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain:<BR>
Dying, her open'd hand forsakes the rein;<BR>
Short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees<BR>
Her mind the passage from her body frees.<BR>
She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest,<BR>
Her drooping head declining on her breast:<BR>
In the last sigh her struggling soul expires,<BR>
And, murm'ring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires.</P>
<P>A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued;<BR>
Despair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd.<BR>
The Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line,<BR>
Advance to charge; the mix'd Arcadians join.</P>
<P>But Cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar<BR>
Surveys the field, and fortune of the war,<BR>
Unmov'd a while, till, prostrate on the plain,<BR>
Welt'ring in blood, she sees Camilla slain,<BR>
And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train.<BR>
Then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew<BR>
A mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue:<BR>
"Too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid,<BR>
For warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid!<BR>
Nor aught avail'd, in this unhappy strife,<BR>
Diana's sacred arms, to save thy life.<BR>
Yet unreveng'd thy goddess will not leave<BR>
Her vot'ry's death, nor; with vain sorrow grieve.<BR>
Branded the wretch, and be his name abhorr'd;<BR>
But after ages shall thy praise record.<BR>
Th' inglorious coward soon shall press the plain:<BR>
Thus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain."</P>
<P>High o'er the field there stood a hilly mound,<BR>
Sacred the place, and spread with oaks around,<BR>
Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay,<BR>
A king that once in Latium bore the sway.<BR>
The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight,<BR>
To mark the traitor Aruns from the height.<BR>
Him in refulgent arms she soon espied,<BR>
Swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried:<BR>
"Thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late;<BR>
Turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate.<BR>
Charg'd with my message, to Camilla go,<BR>
And say I sent thee to the shades below,<BR>
An honor undeserv'd from Cynthia's bow."</P>
<P>She said, and from her quiver chose with speed<BR>
The winged shaft, predestin'd for the deed;<BR>
Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied,<BR>
Till the far distant horns approach'd on either side.<BR>
The bowstring touch'd her breast, so strong she drew;<BR>
Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew.<BR>
At once the twanging bow and sounding dart<BR>
The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart.<BR>
Him, beating with his heels in pangs of death,<BR>
His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath.<BR>
The conqu'ring damsel, with expanded wings,<BR>
The welcome message to her mistress brings.</P>
<P>Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field,<BR>
And, unsustain'd, the chiefs of Turnus yield.<BR>
The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly,<BR>
More on their speed than on their strength rely.<BR>
Confus'd in flight, they bear each other down,<BR>
And spur their horses headlong to the town.<BR>
Driv'n by their foes, and to their fears resign'd,<BR>
Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind.<BR>
These drop the shield, and those the lance forego,<BR>
Or on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow.<BR>
The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound,<BR>
Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground.<BR>
Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky,<BR>
And o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly.<BR>
The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands,<BR>
Rend heav'n with female shrieks, and wring their hands.<BR>
All pressing on, pursuers and pursued,<BR>
Are crush'd in crowds, a mingled multitude.<BR>
Some happy few escape: the throng too late<BR>
Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate.<BR>
Ev'n in the sight of home, the wretched sire<BR>
Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire.<BR>
Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close,<BR>
But leave their friends excluded with their foes.<BR>
The vanquish'd cry; the victors loudly shout;<BR>
'T is terror all within, and slaughter all without.<BR>
Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall,<BR>
Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall.</P>
<P>The Latian virgins, valiant with despair,<BR>
Arm'd on the tow'rs, the common danger share:<BR>
So much of zeal their country's cause inspir'd;<BR>
So much Camilla's great example fir'd.<BR>
Poles, sharpen'd in the flames, from high they throw,<BR>
With imitated darts, to gall the foe.<BR>
Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath,<BR>
And crowd each other to be first in death.<BR>
Meantime to Turnus, ambush'd in the shade,<BR>
With heavy tidings came th' unhappy maid:<BR>
"The Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill'd;<BR>
The foes, entirely masters of the field,<BR>
Like a resistless flood, come rolling on:<BR>
The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town."</P>
<P>Inflam'd with rage, (for so the Furies fire<BR>
The Daunian's breast, and so the Fates require,)<BR>
He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain<BR>
Possess'd, and downward issues on the plain.<BR>
Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed<BR>
From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed.<BR>
Thro' the black forest and the ferny brake,<BR>
Unknowingly secure, their way they take;<BR>
From the rough mountains to the plain descend,<BR>
And there, in order drawn, their line extend.<BR>
Both armies now in open fields are seen;<BR>
Nor far the distance of the space between.<BR>
Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees,<BR>
Thro' smoking fields, his hast'ning enemies;<BR>
And Turnus views the Trojans in array,<BR>
And hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh.<BR>
Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join'd;<BR>
But westward to the sea the sun declin'd.<BR>
Intrench'd before the town both armies lie,<BR>
While Night with sable wings involves the sky.</P>
