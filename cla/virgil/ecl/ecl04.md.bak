# ECLOGUE IV.--POLLIO

Muses of Sicily, sing we a somewhat ampler strain: not all men's delight
is in coppices and lowly tamarisks: if we sing of the woods, let them be
woods worthy of a Consul.

Now is come the last age of the Cumaean prophecy: the great cycle of
periods is born anew. Now returns the Maid, returns the reign of Saturn:
now from high heaven a new generation comes down. Yet do thou at that
boy's birth, in whom the iron race shall begin to cease, and the golden
to arise over all the world, holy Lucina, be gracious; now thine own
Apollo reigns. And in thy consulate, in thine, O Pollio, shall this
glorious age enter, and the great months begin their march: under thy
rule what traces of our guilt yet remain, vanishing shall free earth for
ever from alarm. He shall grow in the life of gods, and shall see gods
and heroes mingled, and himself be seen by them, and shall rule the
world that his fathers' virtues have set at peace. But on thee, O boy,
untilled shall Earth first pour childish gifts, wandering ivy-tendrils
and foxglove, and colocasia mingled with the laughing acanthus: untended
shall the she-goats bring home their milk-swoln udders, nor shall huge
lions alarm the herds: unbidden thy cradle shall break into wooing
blossom. The snake too shall die, and die the treacherous poison-plant:
Assyrian spice shall grow all up and down. But when once thou shalt be
able now to read the glories of heroes and thy father's deeds, and to
know Virtue as she is, slowly the plain shall grow golden with the soft
corn-spike, and the reddening grape trail from the wild briar, and hard
oaks shall drip dew of honey. Nevertheless there shall linger I some few
traces of ancient wrong, to bid ships tempt the sea and towns be girt
with walls and the earth cloven in furrows. Then shall a second Tiphys
be, and a second Argo to sail with chosen

heroes: new wars too shall arise, and again a mighty Achilles be sent to
Troy. Thereafter, when now strengthening age hath wrought thee into man,
the very voyager shall cease out of the sea, nor the sailing pine
exchange her merchandise: all lands shall bear all things, the ground
shall not suffer the mattock, nor the vine the pruning-hook; now
likewise the strong ploughman shall loose his bulls from the yoke.
Neither shall wool learn to counterfeit changing hues, but the ram in
the meadow himself shall dye his fleece now with soft glowing
sea-purple, now with yellow saffron; native scarlet shall clothe the
lambs at their pasturage. Run even thus, O ages, said the harmonious
Fates to their spindles, by the steadfast ordinance of doom. Draw nigh
to thy high honours (even now will the time be come) O dear offspring of
gods, mighty germ of Jove! Behold the world swaying her orbed mass,
lands and spaces of sea and depth of sky; behold how all things rejoice
in the age to come. Ah may the latter end of a long life then yet be
mine, and such breath as shall suffice to tell thy deeds! Not Orpheus of
Thrace nor Linus shall surpass me in song, though he have his mother and
be his father to aid, Orpheus Calliope, Linus beautiful Apollo. If even
Pan before his Arcady contend with me, even Pan before his Arcady shall
declare himself conquered. Begin, O little boy, to know and smile upon
thy mother, thy mother on whom ten months have brought weary longings.
Begin, O little boy: of them who have not smiled on a parent, never was
one honoured at a god's board or on a goddess' couch.

{p. 276}
