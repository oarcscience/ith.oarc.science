------------------------------------------------------------------------

Publius Vergilius Maro was born on the 15th of October, 70 B.C.E., near
Mantua. He is primarily known as the author of the Aeneid, the epic poem
which links the birth of Rome to the Trojan war, and thus to the
[Homeric Cycle](../homer/index.md). The Aeneid is considered the pinnacle
of classical Latin literature. His heroic and tragic characters such as
Aeneas, and the Queen of Carthage, Dido, are memorable; the poetics of
the Aeneid are exceptional, and the text has been used for generations
to teach Latin. Two other minor works, the Eclogues (Pastorals) and the
Georgics, have survived as well.

This act of patriotic myth-building gained him the praise of the Emperor
Augustus. He spent most of his life in Campania, near Sorrento and
Posilipo; it is known that he also visited Greece briefly. Virgil does
not show up in any contemporary accounts and he apparently had few
intimate friendships. However, he was known as a virtuous and modest
man, and although he gained vast public recognition during his lifetime,
he is described as being embarrassed by his celebrity status on his rare
visits to Rome. Unlike other poets such as [Ovid](../ovid/index.md), who
wrote about intimate details of his personal life, Virgils' poetry was
on topics of broad scale, from agriculture to nation building, so we
know little about his internal life from his poems.

Virgil died on September 21st, 19. B.C.E., at Brindisi, and his ashes
were entombed near Naples in Posilipo. His tomb, which once was treated
like a shrine, has disappeared. Supposedly his epitaph was *Mantua me
genuit; Calabri rapuere; tenet nunc Parthenope. Cecini pascua, rura,
duces* (Mantua gave birth to me, the Calabrians took me, now Naples
holds me; I sang of pastures \[the Eclogues\], country \[the Georgics\]
and leaders \[the Aeneiad\]). Virgil is widely acknowledged as a poetic
genius. St. Augustine admired him, and [Dante](../../chr/dante/index.md)
considered Virgil a primary inspiration for his own poetic
world-building exercise; symbolically, Virgil is Dante's escort through
the Inferno. Of course Aeneas made his own visit to the underworld...
