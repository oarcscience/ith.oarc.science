###### XIII.

### TO RHEA <span id="fr_71"></span>[\*](#fn_72.md).

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

DAUGHTER of great Protogonus, divine,  <span
id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_71.md)  
Illustrious Rhea, to my pray'r incline,

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

Who driv'st thy holy car with speed along,  
Drawn by fierce lions, terrible and strong.  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[4](#fn_73.md)  
Mother of Jove, whose mighty arm can wield 5  
Th' avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield.  
Drum-beating, frantic, of a splendid mien, <span
id="fr_74"></span>[7](#fn_74.md)  
Brass-sounding, honor'd, Saturn's blessed queen.  
Thou joy'st in mountains and tumultuous fight,  
And mankind's horrid howlings, thee delight. 10

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

War's parent, mighty, of majestic frame,  
Deceitful saviour, liberating dame.  <span
id="fr_75"></span>[12](#fn_75.md)  
Mother of Gods and men, from whom the earth  
And lofty heav'ns derive their glorious birth;  
Th' ætherial gales, the deeply spreading sea 15  
Goddess ærial form'd, proceed from thee.  
Come, pleas'd with wand'rings, blessed and divine,  
With peace attended on our labours shine;  
Bring rich abundance, and wherever found  
Drive dire disease, to earth's remotest bound. 20

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_71"></span>[137:1](hoo18.htm#fr_72.md) Ver. 1.\] *Daughter of
great Protogonus*. In the note to Hercules it appears that Rhea is one
of the progeny of the intellectual earth, resident in Phanes; and from
the note to Hymn 5, to Protogonus, we learn from Proclus, that Phanes is
to be considered in the intelligible as well as in the intellectual
orders. Hence Rhea is, with perfect agreement to the Orphic theology,
the daughter of Protogonus, considered as subsisting among the
intelligible Gods.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[137:\*](hoo18.htm#fr_71.md) Rhea, according to the
Orphic and Platonic theology, is one of the zoogonic or vivific
principles of the universe; having a maternal rank among the universal
paternal orders, i. e. between Saturn and Jupiter. Hence she calls forth
the causes latent in Saturn to the procreation of the universe; and
definitely unfolds all the genera of the Gods. So that she is filled
from Saturn, with an intelligible and prolific power, which she imparts
to Jupiter the demiurgus of the universe; filling his essence with a
vivific abundance. Since this Goddess then is a medium between the two
intellectual parents of the universe, Saturn and Jupiter, the former of
which collects intellectual multitude into one, but the other scatters
and divides it. Hence says Proclus, in Theol. Plat. p. 266. this Goddess
produces in herself the demiurgic causes of the universe; but imparts
her diffusive power abundantly to secondary natures. On <span
id="page_138">p. 138</span> this account Plato assimilates her prolific
abundance to the flowing of waters; signifying nothing more by the word
*flowing*, than that **fontal** power, by which she singularly contains
the divine rivers of life. And, p. 267. Proclus informs us, that this
Goddess, according to Orpheus, when considered as united to Saturn by
the most exalted part of her essence, is called Rhea: but considered as
producing Jupiter, and, together with Jove, unfolding the universal and
particular orders of the Gods, she is called Ceres.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[138:4](hoo18.htm#fr_73.md) Ver. 4.\] *Drawn by
fierce lions*, &c. I have here followed the correction of Pierson, who
reads ταυροφονων for ταυροφορον: for Rhea is the same with the mother of
the Gods, who is celebrated in the Hymn to her, as seated in a car drawn
by lions.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[138:7](hoo18.htm#fr_74.md) Ver. 7.\]
*Drum-beating*. Rhea, in the Orphic theology, is among the mundane
divinities, the earth. Hence, according to Varro, she is represented
with a drum; because that instrument is a symbol of the earth. August.
dc Civitat. lib. vii.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[139:12](hoo18.htm#fr_75.md) XIII Ver. 12.\]
*Deceitful saviour*. When Jupiter was born (says the fable) his mother
Rhea in order to deceive Saturn, gave him a stone wrapped in swaddling
bands, in the place of Jove; informing him that was her offspring.
Saturn immediately devoured the stone; and Jupiter who was privately
educated, at length obtained the government of the world. With great
propriety, therefore, is she called by the poet a deceitful saviour.
This fable, according to Phurnutus, signifies the creation of the world.
For at that time Nature (which among elementary essences is the same
with Jupiter) was then nourished in the world, and at length prevailed.
The stone devoured by Saturn is the earth, alluding to its firmly
occupying the middle place: for says Phurnutus, beings could not abide
without such a foundation for their support. From this all things are
produced, and derive their proper aliment. Opusc. Mythol. p. 147.
