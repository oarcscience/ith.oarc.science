###### VIII.

### TO THE MOON <span id="fr_56"></span>[\*](#fn_57).

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

HEAR, Goddess queen, diffusing silver light,  
Bull-horn'd and wand'ring thro' the gloom of Night.  <span
id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_56)

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

With stars surrounded, and with circuit wide  
Night's torch extending, thro' the heav'ns you ride:  
Female and Male with borrow'd rays you shine, 5  <span
id="fr_58"></span>[5](#fn_58)  
And now full-orb'd, now tending to decline.  
Mother of ages, fruit-producing Moon,  
Whose amber orb makes Night's reflected noon:

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

Lover of horses, splendid, queen of Night,  
All-seeing pow'r bedeck'd with starry light. 10  
Lover of vigilance, the foe of strife,  
In peace rejoicing, and a prudent life:  
Fair lamp of Night, its ornament and friend,  
Who giv'st to Nature's works their destin'd end.  <span
id="fr_59"></span>[14](#fn_59)  
Queen of the stars, all-wife Diana hail! 15  
Deck'd with a graceful robe and shining veil;  
Come, blessed Goddess, prudent, starry, bright,  
Come moony-lamp with chaste and splendid light,  
Shine on these sacred rites with prosp'rous rays,  
And pleas'd accept thy suppliant's mystic praise.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_56"></span>[124:2](hoo13.htm#fr_57) Ver. 2.\]
*Bull-horned*. For the mystical reason of this appellation, see note to
the third line, of the Hymn to Protogonus.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[124:\*](hoo13.htm#fr_56) The Moon is called in
this Hymn both σελυνη and μηνη: the former of which words signifies the
Moon in the language of the Gods; and the latter is the appellation
given to her by Men, as the following Orphic fragment evinces.

Μήσαλο δ᾽ ἄλλην Γᾶιαν ἀπείριτον, ἣντε Σελήνη  
᾽Αθάνατοι κλήζυσιν, ἐπιχθόνιοι δέ τε Μηνην·  
Ἥ πολλ᾽ ὄυρε ἔχει, πολλ᾽ ἄρεα, πολλα μέλαθρα.

That is, "But he (Jupiter) fabricated another boundless earth, which the
immortals call Selene, but Men, Mene. Which has many mountains, many
cities, many houses." Now this difference of names arises, according to
the Platonic philosophers, from the difference subsisting between divine
and human knowledge. For (say they) as the knowledge of the Gods is
different from that of particular souls: so with respect to names some
are diverse, exhibiting the whole essence of that which is named; but
others are human, which only partially unfolds their signification. But
a larger account of this curious particular, is given by Proclus, in
Theol. Plat. p. 69. as follows. There are three kinds of names: the
first and most proper, and which are truly divine, subsist in the Gods
themselves. But the second which are the resemblances of the first,
having an intellectual subsistence, must be esteemed of divine
condition. And the third kind which emanate from Truth itself, but are
formed into words for the purpose of discourse, receiving the last
signification of divine concerns, are enunciated by skillful men <span
id="page_125">p. 125</span> at one time by a divine afflatus, at another
time by energising intellectually, and generating the images of internal
spectacles moving in a discursive procession. For as the demiurgic
intellect represents about matter the significations of primary forms
comprehended in its essence; temporal signatures of things eternal;
divisible representatives of things in divisible, and produces as it
were shadowy resemblances of true beings: after the same manner I think
the science we possess, framing an intellectual action, fabricates by
discourse both the resemblances of other things, and of the Gods
themselves. So that it fashions by composition, that which in the Gods
is void of composition; that which is simple by variety; and that which
is united by multitude. And by this formation of names it demonstrates
in the last place the images of divine concerns. And as the theurgic art
provokes by certain signs, supernal illumination into artificial
statutes, and allures the unevnying goodness of the Gods, in the same
manner the science of divine concerns, signifies the occult essence of
the God by the compositions and divisions of sounds.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[125:5](hoo13.htm#fr_58) Ver. 5.\] Female and
Male. This is not wonderful, since according to the fragment of Ficinus
in this Dissertation, all souls and the celestial spheres are endued
with a two-fold power, nostic and animating; one of which is male and
the other female. And these epithets are perpetually occurring in the
Orphic Initiations.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[126:14](hoo13.htm#fr_59) Ver. 14.\] *Who giv'st
to Nature's works*, &c. In the original it is τελεσφορος, i. e. bringing
to an end. And Proclus in Theol. Plat. p. 483. informs us that Diana
(who is the same with the Moon) is so called, because she finishes or
perfects the essential perfection of matter.
