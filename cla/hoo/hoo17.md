###### XII.

### TO SATURN.

###### The FUMIGATION from STORAX.

ETHERIAL father, mighty Titan, hear,  <span
id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md)  
Great fire of Gods and men, whom all revere:  
Endu'd with various council, pure and strong,  
To whom perfection and decrease belong.  
Consum'd by thee all forms that hourly die, 5  
By thee restor'd, their former place supply;  
The world immense in everlasting chains,  
Strong and ineffable thy pow'r contains  
Father of vast eternity, divine,  
O mighty Saturn, various speech is thine: 10  
Blossom of earth and of the starry skies,  
Husband of Rhea, and Prometheus wife.

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

Obstetric Nature, venerable root,  
From which the various forms of being shoot;  
No parts peculiar can thy pow'r enclose, 15  
Diffus'd thro' all, from which the world arose,  
O, best of beings, of a subtle mind,  
Propitious hear to holy pray'rs inclin'd;  
The sacred rites benevolent attend,  
And grant a blameless life, a blessed end.
