###### LIV.

### TO VENUS.

###### A HYMN.

HEAV'NLY, illustrious, laughter-loving queen,  
Sea-born, night-loving, of an awful mien;

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

Crafty, from whom necessity first came,  
Producing, nightly, all-connecting dame:  
'Tis thine the world with harmony to join, 5  <span
id="fr_114"></span>[5](#fn_114.md)  
For all things spring from thee, O pow'r divine.  
The triple Fates are rul'd by thy decree,  
And all productions yield alike to thee:  
Whate'er the heav'ns, encircling all contain,  
Earth fruit-producing, and the stormy main, 10  
Thy sway confesses, and obeys thy nod,  
Awful attendant of the brumal God:  
Goddess of marriage, charming to the sight,  
Mother of Loves, whom banquetings delight;  
Source of persuasion, secret, fav'ring queen, 15  
Illustrious born, apparent and unseen:  
Spousal, lupercal, and to men inclin'd,  
Prolific, most-desir'd, life-giving., kind:  
Great sceptre-bearer of the Gods, 'tis thine,  
Mortals in necessary bands to join; 20  
And ev'ry tribe of savage monsters dire  
In magic chains to bind, thro' mad desire.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

Come, Cyprus-born, and to my pray'r incline,  
Whether exalted in the heav'ns you shine,  
Or pleas'd in Syria's temple to preside, 25  
Or o'er th' Egyptian plains thy car to guide,  
Fashion'd of gold; and near its sacred flood,  
Fertile and fam'd to fix thy blest abode;  
Or if rejoicing in the azure shores,  
Near where the sea with foaming billows roars, 30  
The circling choirs of mortals, thy delight,  
Or beauteous nymphs, with eyes cerulean bright,  
Pleas'd by the dusty banks renown'd of old,  
To drive thy rapid, two-yok'd car of gold;  
Or if in Cyprus with thy mother fair, 35  
Where married females praise thee ev'ry year,  
And beauteous virgins in the chorus join,  
Adonis pure to sing and thee divine;  
Come, all-attractive to my pray'r inclin'd,  
For thee, I call, with holy, reverent mind. 40

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_114"></span>[186:5](hoo59.htm#fr_114.md) Ver, 5.\] *'Tis thine
the world with harmony to join*. According to the Orphic theology as
related by Proclus, and from him by Eschenbach, in Epig. p. 52. Venus is
the cause of all the harmony and analogy in the universe, and of the
union of form with matter; connecting and comprehending the powers of
all the mundane elements. And although this Goddess ranks among the
supermundane divinities; yet her principal employment consists, in
beautifully illuminating the order, harmony, and communion of all
mundane concerns.
