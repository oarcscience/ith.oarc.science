###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

I Call great Cupid, source of sweet delight,  
Holy and pure, and lovely to the sight;  
Darting, and wing'd, impetuous fierce desire,  
With Gods and mortals playing, wand'ring fire:  
Cautious, and two-fold, keeper of the keys 5  
Of heav'n and earth, the air, and spreading seas;  
Of all that Ceres' fertile realms contains,  
By which th' all-parent Goddess life sustains,

Who rul'st alone, with universal sway.  
Come, blessed pow'r, regard these mystic fires,  
And far avert, unlawful mad desires.
