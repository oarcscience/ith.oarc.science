###### LXXX.

### TO THE WEST WIND.

###### The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.

SEA-born, aerial, blowing from the west,  
Sweet gales, who give to weary'd labour rest:  
Vernal and grassy, and of gentle found,  
To ships delightful, thro' the sea profound;  
For these, impell'd by you with gentle force, 5  
Pursue with prosp'rous Fate their destin'd course.  
With blameless gales regard my suppliant pray'r,  
Zephyrs unseen, light-wing'd, and form'd from air.
