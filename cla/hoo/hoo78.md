###### LXXIII.

### TO LEUCOTHEA.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

I Call Leucothea, of great Cadmus born,  
And Bacchus' nurse, whom ivy leaves adorn.  
Hear, pow'rful Goddess, in the mighty deep  
Wide and profound, thy Ration doom'd to keep:  
In waves rejoicing, guardian of mankind; 5  
For ships from thee alone deliv'rance find  
Amidst the fury of th' unstable main,  
When art no more avail, and strength is vain;  
When rushing billows with tempestuous ire  
O'erwhelm the mariner in ruin dire, 10  
Thou hear'st, with pity touch'd, his suppliant pray'r,  
Resolv'd his life to succour and to spare.  
Be ever present, Goddess! in distress,  
Waft ships along with prosperous success:  
Thy mystics thro' the stormy sea defend, 15  
And safe conduct them to their destin'd end.
