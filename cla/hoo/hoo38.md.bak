###### XXXIII.

### TO APOLLO.

###### The FUMIGATION from MANNA.

BLEST Pæan, come, propitious to my pray'r,  
Illustrious pow'r, whom Memphian tribes revere,  
Slayer of Tityus, and the God of health,  
Lycorian Phœbus, fruitful source of wealth .  
Spermatic, golden-lyr'd, the field from thee 5  
Receives it's constant, rich fertility.  
Titanic, Grunian, Smynthian, thee I sing,  <span
id="fr_91"></span>[7](#fn_91.md)  
Python-destroying, hallow'd, Delphian king:  
Rural, light-bearer, and the Muse's head,  
Noble and lovely, arm'd with arrows dread: 10  
Far-darting, Bacchian, two-fold, and divine,  <span
id="fr_92"></span>[11](#fn_92.md)  
Pow'r far diffused, and course oblique is thine.  
O, Delian king, whose light-producing eye  
Views all within, and all beneath the sky:

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

Whose locks are gold, whose oracles are sure, 15  
Who, omens good reveal'st, and precepts pure:  
Hear me entreating for the human kind,  
Hear, and be present with benignant mind;  
For thou survey'st this boundless æther all,  
And ev'ry part of this terrestrial ball 20  
Abundant, blessed; and thy piercing sight,  
Extends beneath the gloomy, silent night;  
Beyond the darkness, starry-ey'd, profound,  
The stable roots, deep fix'd by thee are found.  
The world's wide bounds, all-flourishing are thine, 25  
Thyself all the source and end divine:  
'Tis thine all Nature's music to inspire,  
With various-sounding, harmonising lyre;  
Now the last string thou tun'ft to sweet accord,  <span
id="fr_93"></span>[29](#fn_93.md)  
Divinely warbling now the highest chord; 30

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Th' immortal golden lyre, now touch'd by thee,  
Responsive yields a Dorian melody.

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

All Nature's tribes to thee their diff'rence owe,  
And changing seasons from thy music flow  
Hence, mix'd by thee in equal parts, advance 35  
Summer and Winter in alternate dance;  
This claims the highest, that the lowest string,  
The Dorian measure tunes the lovely spring .  
Hence by mankind, Pan-royal, two-horn'd nam'd,  <span
id="fr_94"></span>[39](#fn_94.md)  
Emitting whistling winds thro' Syrinx fam'd; 40  <span
id="fr_95"></span>[40](#fn_95.md)  
Since to thy care, the figur'd seal's consign'd,  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[41](#fn_96.md)  
Which stamps the world with forms of ev'ry kind.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

Hear me, blest pow'r, and in these rites rejoice,  
And save thy mystics with a suppliant voice.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_91"></span>[161:7](hoo38.htm#fr_91.md) Ver. 7.\] *Grunian*.
According to Strabo, lib. xiii. Grynæus is a town of Myrinæus: likewise,
a temple of Apollo, and a most ancient oracle and temple, sumptuously
built of white stone. Gyrald. Syntag. p. 237.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[161:11](hoo38.htm#fr_92.md) Ver. 11.\]
*Far-darting*.ἑκατηϐελετησ Proclus, on Plato's Cratylus, informs us he
is so called, ὅτι χορηγὸσ ὤς, καὶ εξερομενοσ ἐπὶ παντασ ποιεῖ τας
ενεργείας. i. e, "because since he is the choragus or leader of the
choir of the Muses, he produces energies in all things."

<span id="fn_93"></span>[162:29](hoo38.htm#fr_93.md) Ver. 29.\] *Now the
last string*, &c. Gesner well observes, in his notes to this Hymn, that
the comparison and conjunction of the musical and astronomical elements
are most ancient; being derived from Orpheus and Pythagoras, to Plato.
Now, according to the Orphic and Pythagoric doctrine, the lyre of Apollo
is an image of the celestial harmony, or the melody caused by the
orderly revolutions of thc celestial spheres. But I cannot believe that
Orpheus and Pythagoras considered this harmony as attended with sensible
sounds, according to the vulgar acceptation of the word: for it is
surely more rational to suppose, that they meant nothing more by the
music of the spheres, than their harmonical proportions to each other.
Indeed these wise men, to whom metaphors were familiar, may be easily
conceived <span id="page_163">p. 163</span> by vulgar sound and vulgar
harmony to insinuate internal sound, and harmony subsisting in its
origin and cause. Hence we may consider the souls of the celestial
spheres, together with the soul of the world, as composing the choir of
the nine Muses; (who are called by the Platonists nine Syrens) and
dancing in numerical order round Apollo the sun of the intellectual
world. But these nine Muses are far different from the marine Syrens of
the poets who, resident as it were in the sea of material delights, draw
us aside by their alluring melody, from the paths of rectitude. For
these are divine Syrens inviting us to the proper end of our nature; and
forming from the eight tones of the eight spheres, one perfect and
everlasting harmony.

The following quotation from the Platonic Nichomachus, Harm. i. p. 6.
illustrates the meaning of the Hypate and Nete, or the highest and
lowest string. From the motion of Saturn, (says he) "The most remote of
the planets, the appellation of the gravest sound, Hypate, is derived:
but from the lunar motion, which is the lowest of all, the most acute
sound is called νεάτη, Nete, or the lowest." But Gesner observes, that a
more ancient, and as it were archetypal appellation, is derived from the
ancient triangular lyre, a copy of which was found among the pictures
lately dug out of the ruins of Herculaneum; where the highest chord next
to the chin of the musicians is the longest, and consequently (says he)
the sound is the most grave. Gesner proceeds in observing, that the
three seasons of the year are so compared together in a musical ratio,
that Hypate signifies the Winter, Nete the Summer, and the Dorian
measure represents the intermediate seasons, Spring and Autumn. Now the
reason why the Dorian melody is assigned to the Spring, is because that
measure wholly consists in temperament and moderation, as we learn from
Plut. de Mus. p. 1136. E. and consequently <span id="page_164">p.
164</span> is with great propriety attributed to the Spring, considered
as placed between Summer and Winter; and gratefully tempering the
fervent heat of the one, and the intense cold of the other.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[164:39](hoo38.htm#fr_94.md) Ver. 39.\]
*Pan-royal*. See the notes to the Hymn to Pan, to Hercules, and the Sun.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[164:40](hoo38.htm#fr_95.md) Ver. 40.\] *Emitting
whistling winds*. Johannes Diaconus, in Allegorcis Theogoniæ Hesiodi,
quotes the following lines from Orpheus.

Ζεὺς δέ τε πάντων ἐςὶ ϑεὸς, πάντων τε κεραςὴς,  
Πνέυμασι συζι\#ων, (<span id="img_16400"></span> ![](img/16400.jpg))
φωναῖσι τε ἀερομικτοις·

That is, "But Jupiter is the God of all, and the mingler of all things;
whistling with the breathing winds and aerial voices." And this
perfectly agrees with Apollo, considered as Jupiter, or the sun of the
intelligible world.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[164:41](hoo38.htm#fr_96.md) Ver. 41.\] *The
figur'd seal*. Since Apollo in the intelligible world is the demiurgus
of the universe, and consequently comprehends in his essence the
archetypal ideas of all sensible forms, he may with great propriety be
said to posses the figured seal, of which every visible species is
nothing more than an impression. It is however necessary to observe,
that in the great <span id="page_165">p. 165</span> seal of ideas, all
forms subsist in indivisible union and immaterial perfection: but in
their imitative impressions in bodies, they are found full of boundless
multitude, and material imperfection.
