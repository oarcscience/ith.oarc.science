###### LXIX.

### TO THE FURIES.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

HEAR me, illustrious Furies, mighty nam'd,  
Terrific pow'rs, for prudent counsel fam'd;  
Holy and pure, from Jove terrestrial born  
And Proserpine, whom lovely locks adorn:  
Whose piercing sight, with vision unconfin'd, 5  
Surveys the deeds of all the impious kind:  
On Fate attendant, punishing the race  
(With wrath severe) of deeds unjust and base.  
Dark-colour'd queens, whose glittering eyes, are bright  
With dreadful, radiant, life-destroying, light: 10  
Eternal rulers, terrible and strong,  
To whom revenge, and tortures dire belong;  
Fatal and horrid to the human sight,  
With snaky tresses wand'ring in the night;  
Either approach, and in these rites rejoice, 15  
For ye, I call, with holy, suppliant voice.
