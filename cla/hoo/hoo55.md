###### L.

### TO THE NYMPHS.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

NYMPHS, who from Ocean's stream derive your birth,  
Who dwell in liquid caverns of the earth

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

Nurses of Bacchus secret-coursing pow'r,  
Who fruits sustain, and nourish ev'ry flow'r:  
Earthly, rejoicing, who in meadows dwell, 5  
And caves and dens, whose depths extend to hell:  
Holy, oblique, who swiftly soar thro' air,  
Fountains and dews, and mazy streams your care:  
Seen and unseen, who joy with wand'rings wide  
And gentle course, thro' flow'ry vales to glide; 10  
With Pan exulting on the mountains height,  
Loud-founding, mad, whom rocks and woods delight:  
Nymphs od'rous, rob'd in white, whose streams exhale  
The breeze refreshing, and the balmy gale;  
With goats and pastures pleas'd, and beasts of prey, 15  
Nurses of fruits, unconscious of decay:  
In cold rejoicing, and to cattle kind,  
Sportive thro' ocean wand'ring unconfin'd:  
Nysian, fanatic Nymphs, whom oaks delight,  
Lovers of Spring, Pæonian virgins bright. 20  
With Bacchus, and with Ceres, hear my pray'r.  
And to mankind abundant favour bear;  
Propitious listen to your suppliants voice,  
Come, and benignant in these rites rejoice;  
Give plenteous Seasons, and sufficient wealth, 25  
And pour; in lasting streams, continued Health.
