<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">TO PLUTO.</H3>
<P>PLUTO, magnanimous, whose realms profound<BR>
Are fix'd beneath the firm and solid ground,<BR>
In the Tartarian plains remote from fight,<BR>
And wrapt forever in the depths of night;<BR>
Terrestrial Jove, thy sacred ear incline, 5 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><BR>
And, pleas'd, accept thy mystic's hymn divine.<BR>
Earth's keys to thee, illustrious king belong, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A><BR>
Its secret gates unlocking, deep and strong.<BR>
'Tis thine, abundant annual fruits to bear,<BR>
For needy mortals are thy constant care. 10</P>
<P><A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A></P>
<P>To thee, great king, Avernus is assign'd,<BR>
The seat of Gods, and basis of mankind.<BR>
Thy throne is fix'd in Hade's dismal plains,<BR>
Distant, unknown to rest, where darkness reigns;<BR>
Where, destitute of breath, pale spectres dwell, 15<BR>
In endless, dire, inexorable hell;<BR>
And in dread Acheron, whose depths obscure,<BR>
Earth's stable roots eternally secure.<BR>
O mighty d&aelig;mon, whose decision dread,<BR>
The future fate determines of the dead, 20<BR>
With captive Proserpine, thro' grassy plains,<BR>
Drawn in a four-yok'd car with loosen'd reins,<BR>
Rapt o'er the deep, impell'd by love, you flew<BR>
'Till Eleusina's city rose to view;<BR>
There, in a wond'rous cave obscure and deep, 25<BR>
The sacred maid secure from search you keep,<BR>
The cave of Atthis, whose wide gates display<BR>
An entrance to the kingdoms void of day.<BR>
Of unapparent works, thou art alone<BR>
The dispensator, visible and known. 30<BR>
O pow'r all-ruling, holy, honor'd light,<BR>
Thee sacred poets and their hymns delight:<BR>
Propitious to thy mystic's works incline,<BR>
Rejoicing come, for holy rites are thine.</P>
