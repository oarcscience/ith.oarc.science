###### XXVII.

### TO MERCURY.

###### The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.

HERMES, draw near, and to my pray'r incline,  
Angel of Jove, and Maia's son divine;  
Studious of contests, ruler of mankind,  
With heart almighty, and a prudent mind.  
Celestial messenger, of various skill, 5  
Whose pow'rful arts could watchful Argus kill:  
With winged feet, 'tis thine thro' air to course,  
O friend of man, and prophet of discourse:  
Great life-supporter, to rejoice is thine,  
In arts gymnastic, and in fraud divine: 10  
With pow'r endu'd all language to explain,  
Of care the loos'ner, and the source of gain.  
Whose hand contains of blameless peace the rod,  
Corucian, blessed, profitable God;  
Of various speech, whose aid in works we find, 15  
And in necessities to mortals kind:

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

Dire weapon of the tongue, which men revere,  
Be present, Hermes, and thy suppliant hear;  
Assist my works, conclude my life with peace,  
Give graceful speech, and me memory's increase. 20
