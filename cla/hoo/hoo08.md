###### III.

### TO HEAVEN.

###### The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.

GREAT Heav'n, whose mighty frame no respite knows,  
Father of all, from whom the world arose:  
Hear, bounteous parent, source and end of all,  
Forever whirling round this earthly ball;  
Abode of Gods, whose guardian pow'r surrounds 5  <span
id="fr_47"></span>[5](#fn_47.md)  
Th' eternal World with ever during bounds;

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

Whose ample bosom and encircling folds  
The dire necessity of nature holds.  
Ætherial, earthly, whose all-various frame  <span
id="fr_48"></span>[9](#fn_48.md)  
Azure and full of forms, no power can tame. 10  
All-seeing Heav'n, progenitor of Time <span
id="fr_49"></span>[\*](#fn_49.md),  
Forever blessed, deity sublime,  
Propitious on a novel mystic shine,  
And crown his wishes with a life divine.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[116:5](hoo08.htm#fr_47.md) III Ver. 5\] Whose
guardian power surrounds, &c. and v. ii. All-seeing Heaven. ὁ τυ Ὀρφέος
ὐρανὸς ύρος καὶ πάντων φυλὰξ είναι βέλεται· Damascius περὶ αρχῶν, i.e.
"according to Orpheus, Heaven is the inspector and guardian of all
things."

<span id="fn_48"></span>[117:9](hoo08.htm#fr_48.md) III. Ver. 9.\] We have
already observed in our Dissertation, that according to the Platonists,
subordinate natures are contained in the supreme, and such as are
supreme in the subordinate: and this doctrine which is originally
Egyptian, is mentioned by Proclus in Tim. p. 292. as Orphical. ἔσι γὰρ
καὶ ἐν γῆ ὐρανὸς καὶ ἐν ὐρανῷ γῆ, καὶ ἐνταῦθα μὲν ὁ ὐρανὸς χθονίως, εκεῖ
δ᾽ε ὐρανίως ἡ γῆ i. e. "heaven is in earth, and earth in heaven; but
here heaven subsists in an earthly manner, and there earth in a
celestial manner."
