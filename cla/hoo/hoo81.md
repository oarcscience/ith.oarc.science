Free from th' oblivion of the fallen mind,  
By whom the soul with intellect is join'd:  
Reason's increase, and thought to thee belong, 5  
All-powerful, pleasant, vigilant, and strong:  
'Tis thine, to waken from lethargic rest  
All thoughts deposited within the breast;  
And nought neglecting, vigorous to excite  
The mental eye from dark oblivion's night. 10  
Come, blessed power, thy mystic's mem'ry wake  
To holy rites, and Lethe's fetters break.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_124"></span>[214:\*](hoo81.htm#fr_124) Memory, according to
the Platonic philosophy, is that power by which the soul is enabled to
**profer** in some future period, some former energy: and the energy of
this power is reminiscence. Now the very essence of intellect is energy,
and all its perceptions are nothing more than visions of itself: but all
the energies of soul are derived from intellectual illumination. Hence
we may compare intellect to light, the soul to an eye, and Memory to
that power by which the soul is converted to the light, and actually
perceives. But the visions of the soul participate of greater or less
reality, in proportion as she is more or less intimately converted to
the divine light of intellect. In the multitude of mankind, indeed, the
eye of the soul perceives with but a glimmering light, being accustomed
to look constantly abroad into the dark and fluctuating regions of
sense, and to contemplate solely the shadowy forms of imagination; in
consequence of which, their memory is solely employed on objects
obscure, external, and low. But in the few who have purified that organ
of the soul, by which truth can alone be perceived, and which, as Plato
says, is better worth saving than ten thousand eyes of sense; who have
disengaged this eye from that barbaric clay with which it was buried,
and have by this means turned it as from some benighted day, to bright
and real vision: in these, Souls, Memory, <span id="page_215">p.
215</span> and Reminiscense, are entirely conversant with those divine
ideal forms, so familiar to the soul before her immersion in body.
Hence, since we were formerly intellectual natures, we ought, as
Porphyry observes, not only to think earnestly of the way, however long
and laborious, by which we may return to things truly our own; but that
we may meet with a more favourable reception from our proper kindred, we
should meditate in what manner we may divest ourselves of every thing
foreign from our true country, and recall to our memory those
dispositions and habits, without which, we cannot be admitted by our
own, and which from long disuse, have departed from our souls. For this
purpose (says he) we must lay aside whatever we have associated to
ourselves from a mortal nature; and hasten our return to the
contemplation of the simple and immutable light of good. We must divest
ourselves of the various garments of mortality, by which our true beauty
is concealed; and enter the place of contest naked, and without the
incumbrance of dress, striving for the most glorious of all prizes, the
Olympiad of the soul. Thus far Porphyry: and thus it appears, that the
poet, with great philosophical propriety, celebrates Memory as uniting
the soul with intellect.
