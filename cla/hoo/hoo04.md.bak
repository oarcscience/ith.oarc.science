### SECT. III.

BUT it is now time to speak of the following Hymns, of which, as we have
before observed, Onomacritus is the reputed author. And first, with
regard to the dialect of these Hymns, Gesner well observes it ought to
be no objection to their antiquity. For though, according to  <span
id="fr_23"></span>[x](#fn_23.md) Iamblichus, the Thracian Orpheus, who is
more ancient than those noble poets Homer and Hesiod, used the Doric
dialect; yet the Athenian Onomacritus, who, agreeable to the general
opinion of antiquity, is the author of all the works now extant,
ascribed to Orpheus  <span id="fr_24"></span>[y](#fn_24.md), might

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

either, preserving the sentences and a great part of the words, only
change the dialect, and teach the ancient Orpheus to speak Homerically,
or as I may say Solonically: or might arbitrarily add or take away what
he thought proper, which Herodotus relates was his practice, with
respect to the oracles. Gesner adds, that it does not appear probable to
him that Onomacritus would dare to invent all he writ, since Orpheus
must necessarily, at that time, have been in great repute, and a variety
of his verses in circulation: and he concludes with observing that the
objection

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

of the Doric dialect ought to be of no more weight against the antiquity
of the present works, than the Pelasgic letters, which Orpheus used
according to Diodorus Siculus.

The hymns of Orpheus are not only mentioned by Plato in his Eighth Book
of Laws, but also by Pausanias  <span id="fr_25"></span>[a](#fn_25.md),
whose words are translated as follows by the author of the Letters on
Mythology  <span id="fr_26"></span>[b](#fn_26.md). "The Thracian Orpheus
(says Pausanias) was represented on mount Helicon, with ΤΕΛΕΤΗ
(initiation or religion) by his side, and the wild beasts of the woods,
some in marble, some in bronze, standing round him. His hymns are known
by those who have studied the poets to be both short and few in number.
The Lycomedes, an Athenian

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

family dedicated to sacred music, have them all by heart, and sing them
at their solemn mysteries. They are but of the second class for
elegance., being far excelled by Homer's in that respect. But our
religion has adopted the hymns of Orpheus, and has not done the same
honour to the hymns of Homer." To the testimony of Pausanias may be
added that of Suidas, who, among the writings of the Libethrian Orpheus
mentions τελεται, or initiations, which he says are by some ascribed to
Onomacritus  <span id="fr_27"></span>[c](#fn_27.md). And Scaliger well
observes, in his notes co these hymns, that they ought rather to be
called initiations, because they contain only invocations of the Gods,

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

such as the initiated in mysteries are accustomed to use; but they do
not celebrate the nativities, actions, &c. of the divinities, as it is
usual in hymns. It is on this account we have entitled them mystical
initiations, which is doubtless their proper appellations. The author
too of the Allegories in the Theogony of Hesiod  <span
id="fr_28"></span>[d](#fn_28.md), relating the powers of the planets on
things inferior, expressly mentions these hymns, or rather initiations,
and many of the compound epithets with which they abound  <span
id="fr_29"></span>[e](#fn_29.md). From all which it is evident that the
following Hymns were written by the Athenian Onomacritus, and are the
same with those so much celebrated by antiquity. Indeed it is not
probable they Should be the invention of any writer more

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

modern than the above period, as it must have been so easy to detect the
forgery, from the original initiations which were even extant at the
time in which Suidas lived.

In the former part of this Dissertation, we asserted that we should
derive all our information concerning the Orphic theology, from the
writings of the Platonists; not indeed without reason. For this sublime
theology descended from Orpheus to Pythagoras, and from Pythagoras to
Plato; as the following testimonies evince. "Timæus (says Proclus)
 <span id="fr_30"></span>[f](#fn_30.md) being a Pythagorean, follows the
Pythagoric principles, and these are the Orphic traditions; for what
Orpheus delivered mystically in secret discourses, these Pythagoras
learned

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

when he was initiated by Aglaophemus in the Orphic mysteries." Syrianus
too makes the Orphic and Pythagoric principles to be one and the same;
and, according to Suidas, the same Syrianus composed a book, entitled
the Harmony of Orpheus, Pythagoras and Plato  <span
id="fr_31"></span>[g](#fn_31.md). And again Proclus  <span
id="fr_32"></span>[h](#fn_32.md): it is Pythagorical to follow the Orphic
genealogies; for from the Orphic tradition downward by Pythagoras, the
science concerning the Gods was derived to the Greeks." And elsewhere
 <span id="fr_33"></span>[i](#fn_33.md), "All the theology of the Greeks is
the progeny of the sacred initiations (μυσαγωγιαι) of Orpheus. For
Pythagoras first learned the orgies of the Gods from Aglaophemus; but
Plato was the second who received a

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

perfect science of these, both from the Pythagoric, and Orphic
writings." Now in consequence of these testimonies, our hymns ought to
agree with the doctrine of Pythagoras; especially since Onomacritus,
their Author, was of that school. And that .they do so, the following
discovery abundantly evinces.

Photius, in his Bibliotheca, has preserved to us part of a valuable
work, written by Nicomachus the Pythagorean, entitled Theological
Arithmetic; in which he ascribes particular epithets, and the names of
various divinities to numbers, as far as to ten. There is likewise a
curious work of the same title, by an anonymous writer, which is extant
only in manuscript. From these two, and from occasional passages
respecting numbers according to Pythagoras, found in the Platonic
writers, Meursius

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

has composed a book, which he calls Denarius Pythagoricus; and which is
an invaluable treatise to such as are studious of the ancient
philosophy. On perusing this learned book, it seemed to me necessary,
that as the divinities, ascribed to each number, had a particular
relation to one another, they should also have a mutual agreement in the
following hymns. And on the comparison I found the most perfect
similitude: a few instances of which I shall select, leaving a more
accurate investigation of this matter to the learned and philosophical
reader.

In the first place then, among the various names ascribed to the monad
or unity, are those of the following Gods; viz. the Sun, Jupiter, Love,
Proteus, Vesta. Now in the hymn to the Sun we find the epithet , O
immortal

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

Jove. In that to Love πυρίδρομος, or wandering fire, which is likewise
found in the hymn, to the Sun. In the hymn to Love, that deity is
celebrated as having the keys of all things  <span
id="fr_34"></span>[k](#fn_34.md); viz. of æther, heaven, the deep, the
earth, &c. And Proteus is invoked as possessing the keys of the deep
 <span id="fr_35"></span>[l](#fn_35.md). Again, Vesta, in the Orphic hymns,
is the same with the mother of the Gods; and the mother of the Gods is
celebrated as "always governing rivers and every sea  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[m](#fn_36.md); which perfectly agrees with the
appellations given both to Love and Proteus. Again, among the various
epithets ascribed to the duad, or number two, are, Phanes, Nature,
Justice, Rhea,

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

Diana, Cupid, Venus, Fate, Death, &c. Now Phanes, in the Orphic hymns,
is the same with Protogonus; and Nature is called πρωτογενία, or
first-born, and δίκη, or Justice, as also πεπρωμενή, or Fate. Likewise
Rhea is denominated ϑύγατερ πολυμορφυ Πωτογονοίο, or daughter, of much
formed Protogonus; and in the same hymn the reader will find other
epithets, which agree with the appellation given to Nature. Again, both
Nature and Diana are called ὠκυλοχεία, or swiftly bringing forth; and
Love as well as Nature is called or two-fold. In like manner Rhea and
Venus agree, for he says of Venus πάντα γὰρ ἐκ σιθεν ἐσὶν, for all
things are from thee; and of Rhea, Μήτηρ μέν τε θεῶν ἠδὲ θνητῶν
ἀνθρώπων, or mother of Gods and mortal men. After which he expressly
says that earth and heaven, the sea and the air, proceed from her

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

divinity. Besides this, he celebrates Venus as governing the three
Fates; ϗαμπ ηρατέεισ τρισσῶν μοιρῶν. And lastly he says of Love, after
representing that Deity as invested with the keys of all things thou
alone rulest the governments of all these  <span
id="fr_37"></span>[n](#fn_37.md); which he likewise affirms of Death in the
same words. And thus much for the duad. The triad, or number three, they
denominated Juno, Latona, Thetis, Hecate or Diana, Pluto, Tritogenia or
Minerva, &c. Now Latona and Thetis, are each of them called in these
initiations, κυανόπεπλ\# (<span id="img_09600"></span>
![](img/09600.jpg)) or dark-veiled; and Minerva and the Moon, who is the
same with Diana, θῆλωσ ϗαμπ ἂρσην, female and male. The tetrad

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

or number four, they denominated Hercules, Vulcan, Mercury, Bacchus
two-mothered, Bassarius, key-keeper of nature, Masculine, Feminine, the
World, (which in these initiations is the same with Pan) Harmony,
justice. Now Onomacritus calls Hercules and Vulcan, Καρτεροχειρ, or
strong-handed; and he celebrates Hercules and Mercury as "having an
almighty heart." ϖατκρατες ἦτορ ἔχῶν. And so of the rest. The pentad or
number of five they called Nature, Pallas, Immortal, Providence,
Nemesis, Venus, Justice, &c. Now Nature is called in these hymns, or
rather initiations πολυμήχανε μῆτερ, or much-mechanic Mother, and
παντοτεχνεσ or universal Artist; and Minerva is denominated μητερ
τεχνῶν, or Mother of Arts. Likewise Nature is expressly called ἀθανάτη
τε ϖρόνιοια or Immortal, and Providence. The hexad or number six, they
denominated, Venus,

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

Health, the World Ἐκατηϐελέτις darting, (because compounded of the
triad, which is called Hecate), Persæa, triform, Amphitrite, &c. Now
Venus, as we have already observed in the names of the duad, is said to
be the source of all things and Health is expressly called μῆτερ
ἀπαντων, or Mother of all things. Again the heptad, or number seven they
called Fortune, Minerva, Mars., &c. And Fortune, in these initiations,
is the same with Diana or the Moon, who is called male and female as
well as Minerva; and Minerva and Mars are each of them denominated
ὀπλιχαρές or armipotent, and Minerva πολεμοκλόνε, or full of warlike
tumult. The ogdoad, or number eight, they called Rhea, Love, Neptune,
Law. And the Mother of the Gods, who is the same with Rhea, is
represented as we have observed on the monad, as governing rivers and
every

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

sea; and Love is said to have the keys of all things; of heaven, the
deep, &c. The ennead, or number nine, they denominate Ocean, Prometheus,
Vulcan, Pœan (i. e. Apollo or the Sun), Juno, Proserpine, &c. Now Saturn
(who is called in these initiations Prometheus) and Ocean, are each of
them celebrated as the source of Gods and men: and Vulcan is expressly
called ἤλιοσ or the Sun. And lastly they denominated the decad, Heaven,
the Sun, Unwearied, Fate, Phanes, Necessity, &c. Hence Heaven is called
in these initiations φύλαξ πάντων, or Guardian of all things; and the
Sun ϖισοφύλαξ, or faithful Guardian; and ἀκάμα or Unwearied, is an
appellation of the Sun, in the hymn to that Deity. The reader too will
find many epithets in the hymn to Protogonus or Phanes, corresponding
with those of the Sun. And thus much for the agreement of these hymns,

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

with the Pythagoric names of numbers. The limits of the present work
will not permit me to be more explicit on this particular; but he who
wishes to understand the meaning of many of the preceding appellations,
may consult the valuable book of Meursius, already cited, where he will
meet with abundant matter for deep speculation. But before I conclude
this Dissertation, I must beg leave to acquaint the reader with another
discovery which I have made respecting these hymns, equally curious with
the former.

Ficinus, on Plato's Theology  <span id="fr_38"></span>[a](#fn_38.md), has
the following remarkable passage, translated, most likely from some
manuscript work of Proclus, as I conjecture from its conclusion; for,
unfortunately, he does not acquaint us with the author. "Those

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

who profess, says he, the Orphic theology, consider a two-fold power in
souls and in the celestial orbs: the one consisting in knowledge, the
other in vivifying and governing the orb with which that power is
connected. Thus in the orb of the earth, they call the nostic power
Pluto, the other Proserpine  <span id="fr_39"></span>[b](#fn_39.md). In
water, the former power Ocean, and the latter Thetis. In air, that
thundering Jove, and this Juno. In fire, that Phanes, and this Aurora.
In the soul of the lunar sphere, they call the nostic power Licnitan
Bacchus, the other Thalia. In the sphere of Mercury, that Bacchus
Silenus, this Euterpe. In the orb of Venus, that Lysius Bacchus, this

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

Erato. In the sphere of the sun, that Trietericus Bacchus, this
Melpomene. In the orb of Mars, that Bassareus Bacchus, this Clio. In the
sphere of Jove, that Sebazius, this Terpsichore. In the orb of Saturn,
that Amphietus, this Polymnia. In the eighth sphere, that Pericionius,
this Urania. But in the soul of the world, the nostic power, Bacchus
Eribromus, but the animating power Calliope. From all which the Orphic
theologers infer, that the particular epithets of Bacchus are compared
with those of the Muses on this account, that we may understand the
powers of the Muses, as intoxicated with the nectar of divine knowledge;
and may consider the nine Muses, and nine Bacchuses, as revolving round
one Apollo, that is about the splendor of one invisible Sun." The
greater part of this fine passage is

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

preserved by Gyraldus, in his Syntagma de Musis, and by Natales Comes,
in his Mythology, but without mentioning the original author. Now if the
Hymn to the Earth, is compared with the Hymns to Pluto and Proserpine;
the one to Ocean, with that to Thetis; and so of the other elements
agreeable to the preceding account, we shall discover a wonderful
similitude. And with respect to the celestial spheres, Silenus Bacchus,
who, according to the preceding account, should agree with Mercury, is
called in these initiations τροφὴ, or Nourishment, and Mercury,
τροφιυχε, or Nourisher. Venus, who should agree with Lysius Bacchus, is
called κρυφία or Occult, and ἐρατοπλόκαμος, or lovely haired, and σεμνὴ
Βάκχοιο παρεδρε, or venerable attendant of Bacchus; and Lysius is
denominated κρυψίγονος, or an occult offspring

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

and καλλιέθειρα, or fair-haired. In like manner Trietericus Bacchus is
called ϖαιάν κρυσετχησ or Apollo pouring golden light, which evidently
agrees with the sun. Again, Bassarius Bacchus is celebrated as rejoicing
in swords and blood, οσ ξιφεσιν χαιρεισ, ἠδ᾽ αἴμασι, κ· λ·, which
plainly corresponds with Mars, as the hymn to that Deity evinces in a
particular manner. Sebazius and Jupiter evidently agree, for Sebazius is
expressly called ὐι\# (<span id="img_10400"></span> ![](img/10400.jpg))
Κρονυ, son of Saturn. And Amphietus is celebrated as moving in concert
with the circling hours, Ἐυάζων κινῶν τε χορῦσ ἐνὶ κυκλάσιν ὥραις which
corresponds with Saturn, who is called in these Hymns , or the Sun
 <span id="fr_40"></span>[c](#fn_40.md). And lastly, Dionysius who is
called

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

called in these Initiations Eribromus, is denominated δικέρωτα or
two-horned, which is also an epithet of Pan, or the soul of the world.
And thus much for the doctrine of these Hymns, so far as is requisite to
an introductory Dissertation. What farther light we have been able to.
throw on these mysterious remains of antiquity, will appear in our
following Notes. If the valuable Commentary of Proclus on the Cratylus
of Plato was once published, I am persuaded we should find them full of
the most recondite antiquity  <span id="fr_41"></span>[d](#fn_41.md): but
as

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

this is not to be expected in the present age, the lovers of ancient
wisdom, will I doubt not, gratefully accept the preceding and subsequent
elucidations. For on a subject so full of obscurity as the present, a
glimmering light is as conspicuous, and as agreeable to the eye of the
mind, as a small spark in profound darkness is to the corporeal sight.
