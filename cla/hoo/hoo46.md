###### XLI.

### TO MISES.

###### The FUMIGATION from STORAX.

Call Thesmophorus <span id="fr_103"></span>[\*](#fn_103.md), spermatic
God,  
Of various names, who bears the leafy rod:  
Mises, ineffable, pure, sacred queen,  
Two-fold Iacchus, male and female seen:  
Illustr'ous, whether to rejoice is thine  
In incense offer'd, in the fane divine <span
id="fr_104"></span>[+](#fn_104.md);  
Or if in Phrygia most thy soul delights,  
Performing with thy mother sacred rites;  
Or if the land of Cyprus is thy care,  
Well pleas'd to dwell with Cytherea fair; 10

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

Or if exulting in the fertile plains  
With thy dark mother Isis, [where](errata.htm#10.md) she reigns, <span
id="fr_105"></span>[12](#fn_105.md)

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

With nurses pure attended, near the flood  
Of sacred Egypt, thy divine abode:

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

Wherever resident, blest pow'r attend, 15  
And with benignant mind these labours end.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[174:12](hoo46.htm#fr_105.md) *My dark mother
Isis*. According to Plutarch, in his treatise of Isis and Osiris, Isis
is the mother of Orus, who is called by the Greeks Apollo; and Iacchus
it is well known is a mythic sirname of Bacchus. Now Apollo is
frequently called in the orphic writings Bacchus; as in the Hymn to that
deity, *Bacchian and Two-fold*. And Apollo, as we have frequently
observed, is in the intelligible world, the king and father of the
universe, Protogonus, or Ericapæus, and in the sensible world the Sun.
So that Mises or Bacchus is celebrated in this Hymn by the same
appellations as are given to Protogonus and Apollo: for he is called
spermatic, ineffable, male and female, &c. which last appellation is
given to Protogonus in the Orphic verse preserved by Proclus, lib. ii.
in Timæum.

Θή\#ισ καὶ γενέτωρ κρατερὸς ϑεὸς ὴρικεπαῖοσ

That is, "Female and father (or male), strong God Ericapæus"

Indeed it is common with the Orphic theologers, to celebrate causes as
the same with effects, and effects with their causes; the supreme as the
subordinate, and the subordinate as the supreme. And this in consequence
of the mysterious union, subsisting between all the divine orders, and
through every part of the universe; every thing, except the first cause,
being stamped as it were with the same great seals of ideas, and
existing on this account in sympathy and similitude with natures, both
superior and subordinate to its essence. And here I cannot but take
notice of the mistake of Macrobius, who imagines that all the Gods
according to Orpheus, may be reduced to the Sun; the other divinities
being but so many different appellations of that deity: for it is
sufficiently evident to those who are skilled in the Orphic theology,
that Orpheus was a Polytheist as well as a monarchist. But this mistake
of Macrobius is not wonderful; <span id="page_175">p. 175</span> as we
may say of him what Plotinus said, on reading the book of Longinus
*concerning principles*, φιλόλογοσ μὲν ὁ Λογγῖνοσ, φιλόσοφοσ δὲ ὐδαμῶσ,
i. e. "Longinus is a philologist, but by no means a philosopher."
Similar to this is the mistake of modern Mythologists, who in conformity
with the fashionable philosophy, call the material parts of nature, the
Gods of the ancients: the folly and impiety of which system, cannot be
better represented than in the words of Plutarch in his above mentioned
curious Treatise of Isis and Osiris, which I shall give the reader in
the elegant Translation of Dr. Squire, p. 90. "We ought to take the
greatest care (says Plutarch) that we do not explain away the very
nature of the Gods, by resolving it as it were into mere blasts of wind,
or streams of rivers, into the sowing and earing of corn, or into the
changes of the earth and seasons, as those persons have actually done,
who make Bacchus to be Wine, and Vulcan Fire. Just as Cleanthes
somewhere tells us, that by Proserpine nothing else is meant, but that
air which pervading the fruits of the earth, is thereby destroyed as it
were, being deprived of its nutritive spirit and as a certain poet,
speaking of reaping corn, says,

Then, when the vigorous youth shall Ceres cut.

For those who indulge themselves in this manner of expression, act just
as wisely as they would do, who should call the sails, the cables, and
the anchors of the ship, the pilot; or the yarn and web, the weaver; or
the emulsion, the easing draught, and the **ptifan**, the physician.
"And, p. 91. he observes, that as the sun and the moon, and the heavens,
and the earth, and the sea, though common to all mankind, have different
names given them by different people; so may the same be affirmed,
likewise, of that one supreme reason, who framed this world, and of that
one providence which governs and watches over <span id="page_176">p.
176</span> the whole, and of those *subordinate ministring powers that
are set over the universe*, that they are the very same everywhere,
though the honors which are paid them, as well as the appellations which
are given them, are different in different places, according to the laws
of each country, as are likewise those symbols, under which the mystics
endeavour to lead their votaries to the knowledge of divine truths: and
though some of these are more clear and explicit than others, yet are
they not any of them without hazard; for whilst some persons, by wholly
mistaking their meaning and appellation, have thereby plunged themselves
into *superstition*, others, that they might avoid so fatal a quagmire,
are unawares, dashed themselves upon the rock of *atheism*."
