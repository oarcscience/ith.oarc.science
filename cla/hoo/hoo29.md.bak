###### XXIV.

### TO PROTEUS <span id="fr_80"></span>[\*](#fn_80.md).

###### The FUMIGATION from STORAX.

PROTEUS I call, whom Fate decrees, to keep  
The keys which lock the chambers of the deep;  
First-born, by whose illustrious pow'r alone  
All Nature's principles are clearly shewn:  
Matter to change with various forms is thine, 5  
Matter unform'd, capacious, and divine.  
All-honor'd, prudent, whose sagacious mind  
Knows all that was, and is, of ev'ry kind,  
With all that shall be in succeeding time;  
So vast thy wisdom, wond'rous, and sublime: 10  
For all things Nature first to thee consign'd,  
And in thy essence omniform confin'd.  
Come, blessed father, to our rites attend,  
And grant our happy lives a prosp'rous end.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_80"></span>[149:\*](hoo29.htm#fr_80.md) According to Proclus,
in Plat. Repub. p. 97, Proteus, though inferior to the primary Gods, is
immortal: and though not a deity, is a certain angelic mind of the order
of Neptune, comprehending in himself all the forms of things generated
in the universe.
