### SECT. II.

LET us now proceed to his theology; exchanging the obscurity of
conjecture for the light of clear evidence; and the intricate labyrinths
of fable for the delightful though solitary paths of truth.

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

And here I must acquaint the reader, that I shall every where deduce my
information from the writings of the latter Platonists; as the only
sources of genuine knowledge, on this sublime and obsolete enquiry
 <span id="fr_4"></span>[e](#fn_4.md). The vulgar systems of mythology are
here entirely useless; and he who should attempt to elucidate the
theology, or hymns of Orpheus, by any modern hypothesis, would be as
ridiculously employed, as he who should expect to find the origin of a
copious stream, by pursuing it to its last and most intricate
involutions. In conformity with modern prejudices, the author of the
Letters on Mythology, endeavours to prove, that the Orphic hymns deify
the various parts of nature, not considered as animated by different
intelligences but as various modifications of

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

inert and lifeless matter. This hypothesis is no doubt readily embraced
by the present philosophers, a great part of whom, deny the existence of
any thing incorporeal; and the better sort, who acknowledge one supreme
immaterial Being, exclude the agency of subordinate intelligences in the
government of the world; though this doctrine is perfectly
philosophical, and at the same time consistent with revelation. The
belief indeed of the man, who looks no higher than sense, must be
necessarily terminated by appearances. Such a one introduces a dreadful
chasm in the universe; and diffuses the deity through the world like an
extended substance; divided with every particle of matter, and changed
into the infinite varieties of sensible forms. But with the ancient
philosopher, the deity is an immense and perpetually exuberant fountain;
whose streams originally filled and continually replenish

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

the world with life. Hence the universe contains in its ample bosom all
general natures; divinities visible and invisible; the illustrious race
of dæmons; the noble army of exalted souls; and men rendered happy by
wisdom and virtue. According to this theology, the power of universal
soul does not alone diffuse itself to the sea, and become bounded by its
circumfluent waters, while the wide expanse of air and æther, is
destitute of life and soul; but the celestial spaces are filled with
souls, supplying life to the stars, and directing their revolutions in
everlasting order. So that the celestial orbs in imitation of intellect,
which seeks after nothing external, are wifely agitated in perpetual
circuit round the central sun. While some things participate of being
alone, others of life, and others are endued with sentient powers; some
possess the still higher faculty of reason; and lastly others, are all
life and intelligence.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

But let us rise a little higher, and contemplate the arguments by which
the Platonists, establish the Orphic doctrine of the existence and
agency of subordinate intelligences. Thus then they reason  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[f](#fn_5.md), Of all beings it is necessary that some
should move only, that others should be entirely moved; and that the
beings situated between these two, should participate of the extremes,
and both move and be moved. Among the first in dignity and order are
those natures which move only; the second, those which move themselves;
the third, those which move and are moved; and the fourth, those which
are moved only. Now the second class of these, or the self-motive
natures, since their perfection consists in transition and mutation of
life, must depend upon a more ancient cause, which subsists perpetually
the same;

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

and whose life is not conversant with the circulations of time, but is
constituted in the stable essence of eternity. But it is necessary that
the third class, which both move and are moved, should depend on a
self-motive nature. For a self-motive being, is the cause of motion to
those, which are moved by another, in the same manner as that which is
immovable, inserts in all beings the power of moving. And again, that
which is moved only, must depend on those natures, which are indeed
moved by another, but which are themselves endued with a motive-power.
For it is necessary that the chain of beings should be complete; every
where connected by proper mediums, and deduced in an orderly and
perpetual series, from the principle to the extremes. All bodies
therefore belong to those natures which are moved only, and are
naturally passive;

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

since they are destitute of all inherent energy, on account of their
sluggish nature, which participates of division, magnitude, and weight.

But of incorporeals some are divisible about bodies; while others are
entirely free from such an affection about the lowest order of beings.
Hence such things, as are divided about the dead weight of bodies,
whether they are material qualities or forms, belong to the orders of
nature's moving, and at the same time moved. For such as these because
incorporeal, participate of a motive faculty; but because they are also
divided about bodies, they are on this account exempt from incorporeal
perfection; are filled with material inactivity, and require the energy
of a self-motive nature. Where then shall we find this self-motive
essence? For such things as are extended with magnitude, oppressed

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

by material weight, and inseparably reside in bodies, must necessarily
either move only, or be moved by others. But it is requisite, as we have
before observed, that prior to this order, the self-motive essence
should subsist. And hence we conclude that there is another certain
nature exempt from the passivity and imperfection of bodies, existing
not only in the heavens, but in the ever-changing elements, from which
the motion of bodies is primrily derived. And this nature is no other
than soul, from which animals derive their life and motive power; and
which even affords an image of self-motion to the unstable order of
bodies.

If then the self-motive essence is more ancient than that which is moved
by another, but soul is primarily self-motive, hence soul must be more
ancient than body; and all corporeal motion must be

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

the progeny of soul, and of her inherent energy. It is necessary,
therefore, that the heavens, with all their boundless contents, and
their various natural motions (for a circular motion, is natural to such
bodies), should be endued with governing souls, essentially more ancient
than their revolving bodies. According to the Platonic philosophers,
therefore, these souls which orderly distinguish the universe and its
contained parts, from their inherent cause of motion, give life and
motion to every inanimate body. But it is necessary that every motive
essence, should either move all things rationally, or irrationally; that
is, either according to the uniform and unerring laws of reason, or
according to the brutal impulse of an irrational nature. But the
constant order observed in the periods of the celestial bodies, the
convenience of positions, and the admirable laws

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

by which their revolutions are directed, plainly evince that their
motions are governed by a rational nature. If therefore, an intellectual
and rational soul governs the universe, and if every thing eternally
moved is under the directing influence of such a soul; may we not
enquire whether it possesses this intellectual, perfect, and beneficent
power, by participation, or essentially? for if essentially, it is
necessary that every soul should be intellectual, since every soul is
naturally self-motive. But if by participation, there must be another
nature more ancient than soul, which operates entirely from energy; and
whose essence is intelligence, on account of that uniform conception of
universals, which it essentially contains. Because it is also necessary
that the soul, essentially rational, should receive intellect by
participation, and that intellectual energy should be of

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

two kinds; one primarily subsisting in the divine intellect; but the
other subsisting secondarily in its offspring soul. You may add too, the
presence of intellectual illumination in body, which is received in as
great perfection as its unstable and obscure nature will admit. For how
is it possible that the celestial orbs should be for ever circularly
moved in one definite order, preserving the same form, and the same
immutable power, unless they participated of an intellectual nature. For
soul is indeed the constant supplier of motion; but the cause of
perpetual station, of indentity and uniform life, reducing unstable
motion to a circular revolution, and to a condition eternally the same,
must be more ancient than soul.

Body, indeed, and whatever is the object of sense, belongs; to the order
of things moved by another. But soul is self-motive,

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

embracing in itself, in a connected manner, all corporeal motions. And
prior to this is immovable intellect. And here it is requisite to
observe, that this immaterial nature must not be conceived as similar to
any thing inert, destitute of life, and endued with no spirit, but as
the principal cause of all motion, and the fountain of all life; as well
of that whose streams perpetually return into itself, as of that which
subsists in others, and has, on this account only, a secondary and
imperfect existence.

All things, therefore, depend upon unity, through the medium of
intellect and soul. And intellect is of an uniform essence; but soul of
a mental form νοειδήσ, and the body of the world vivific, or vital
ζωτικὸς. The first cause of all is indeed prior to intellect, but
intellect is the first recipient of a divine nature; and soul is divine,
so far as it requires an intellectual medium. But the

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

body which participates a soul of this kind is divine, in as great a
degree as the nature of body will admit. For the illustration of
intellectual light, pervades from the principle of things, to the
extremes; and is not totally obscured, even when it enters the
involutions of matter, and is profoundly merged in its dark and flowing
receptacle.

Hence we may with reason conclude, that not only the universe, but each
of its eternal parts is animated. and endued with intellect, and is in
its capacity similar to the universe. For each of these parts, is a
universe if compared with the multitude it contains, and to which it is
allied. There is, therefore, according to the Orphic and Platonic
theology, one soul of the universe; and after this others, which from
participating this general soul, dispose the entire parts of the
universe into order;

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

and one intellect which is participated by souls, and one supreme God,
who comprehends the world in his infinite nature, and a multitude of
other divinities, who distribute intellectual essences, together with
their dependent souls, and all the parts of the world, and who are the
perpetual sources of its order, union, and consent. For it is not
reasonable to suppose that every production of nature, should have the
power of generating its similar, but that the universe and primary
essences should not more abundantly possess an ability of such like
procreation; since sterility can only belong to the most abject, and not
to the most excellent natures.

In consequence of this reasoning, Orpheus filled all things with Gods,
subordinate to the demiurgus of the whole Δημιυργῷ, every one of which
performs the office destined to his divinity, by his superiour

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

leader. Hence according to his theology there are two worlds, the
intelligible and the sensible. Hence too his three demiurgic principles:
Jovial, Dionysiacal, and Adonical, Δΐι\#, (<span id="img_02600"></span>
![](img/02600.jpg)) Διονυσιακὴ, Αδωναϊκὴ, from whence many orders and
differences of Gods proceed, intelligible  <span
id="fr_6"></span>[e](#fn_6.md), intellectual, super-mundane, mundane,
celestial, authors of generation. And among these some in the order of
guardian, demiurgic, elevating and comprehending Gods; perfecters of
works, vivific, immutable, absolute, judicial, purgative, &c. and
besides these to each particular divinity, he added a particular
multitude of angels, dæmons, and heroes; for according to Proclus,
relating the

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

opinion of Orpheus, and the theologists:  <span
id="fr_7"></span>[f](#fn_7.md) "About every God there is a kindred
multitude of angels, heroes, and dæmons. For every God presides over the
form of that multitude which receives the divinity." He likewise
considered a difference of sex in these deifies, calling some male, and
others female; the reason of which distinction  <span
id="fr_8"></span>[g](#fn_8.md) Proclus, with his usual elegance and
subtilty, thus explains.

"The division of male and female comprehends in itself, all the
plenitudes of divine orders. Since the cause of stable power and
identity, and the leader Χὸρηγος of being, and that which invests all
things with the first principle of conversion, is comprehended in the
masculine order. But that which generates from itself, all various
progressions and partitions, measures

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

of life and prolific powers, is contained in the female division. And on
this account Timæus also, converting himself to all the Gods, by this
division of generated natures, embraces their universal orders. But a
division of this kind, is particularly accommodated and proper to the
present Theory, because the universe is full of this two-fold kind of
Gods. For that we may begin with the extremes, heaven corresponds with
earth, in the order and proportion of male to female. Since the motion
of the heavens imparts particular properties and powers, to particular
things. But on the other hand earth receiving the celestial defluxions,
becomes pregnant, and produces plants and animals of every kind. And of
the Gods existing in the heavens, some are distinguished by the male
division, and others by the female and the authors of generation, since
they

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

are themselves destitute of birth, are some of this order and others of
that, for the demiurgic choir is abundant in the universe. There are
also many canals as it as it were of life, some of which exhibit the
male and others the female form. But why should I insist on this
particular? since from the absolute unities, whether endued with a
masculine, or a feminine form, various orders of beings flow into the
universe." Thus far Proclus.

But that Orpheus was a monarchist, as well as a polytheist, is not only
evident from the preceding arguments, originally derived from his
Theology, but from the following verses quoted by Proclus  <span
id="fr_9"></span>[h](#fn_9.md).

Hence with the universe great Jove contains  
The æther bright, and heav'ns exalted plains  
Th' extended restless sea, and earth renown'd  
Ocean immense, and Tartarus profound; <span id="page_30">p. 30</span>  
Fountains and rivers, and the boundless main,  
With all that nature's ample realms contain,  
And Gods and Goddesses of each degree  
All that is past, and all that e'er shall be,  
Occultly, and in fair connection  <span id="fr_10"></span>[i](#fn_10.md),
lies  
In Jove's wide womb, the ruler of the skies.

And in the same place, Proclus has preserved to us another copy of
Orphic verses, which are also found in the writer (de Mundo); previous
to which he observes, that the demiurgus, or artificer of the world,
being full of ideas, comprehended by these all things within himself, as
that theologer (Orpheus) declares. With these verses we have connected
others, agreeable to the order of Stephens, Eschenbach, and Gesner, as
follows.

Jove is the first and last thund'ring king,  
Middle and head, from Jove all beings spring; <span id="page_31">p.
31</span>  
In Jove the male and female forms combine,  
For Jove's a man, and yet a maid divine;  
Jove the strong basis of the earth contains,  
And the deep splendour of the starry plains;  
Jove is the breath of all; Jove's wondrous frame  
Lives in the rage of ever restless flame;  
Jove is the sea's strong root, the solar light,  
And Jove's the moon, fair regent of the night;  
Jove is a king by no restraint confin'd,  
And all things flow from Jove's prolific mind;  
One is the pow'r divine in all things known,  
And one the ruler absolute alone.  
For in Jove's royal body all things lie,  
Fire, night and day, earth, water and the sky;  
The first begetters pleasing love and mind;  
These in his mighty body, Jove confin'd:  
See, how his beauteous head and aspect bright  
Illumine heav'n, and scatter boundless light!  
Round which his pendant golden tresses shine  
Form'd from the starry beams, with light divine;  
On either side two radiant horns behold,  
Shap'd like a bull's and bright with glittering gold;  
And East and West in opposition lie,  
The lucid paths of all the Gods on high; <span id="page_32">p.
32</span>  
His eyes, the sun, and moon with borrow'd ray;  
Royal, ætherial; and his ear refin'd  
Hears ev'ry voice, and sounds of ev'ry kind.  
Thus are his head and mind immortal, bright,  
His body's boundless, stable, full of light;  
Strong are his members, with a force endu'd  
Pow'rful to tame, but ne'er to be subdu'd;  
Th' extended region of surrounding air  
Forms his broad shoulders, back, and bosom fair;  
And thro' the world the ruler of the skies  
Upborne on natal, rapid pinions flies;  
His sacred belly earth with fertile plains,  
And mountains swelling to the clouds, contains;  
His middle zone's the spreading sea profound,  
Whose roaring waves the solid globe surround;  
The distant realms of Tartarus obscure  
Within earth's roots, his holy feet secure; <span id="page_33">p.
33</span>  
For these earth's utmost bounds to Jove belong,  
And form his basis permanent and strong.  
Thus all things Jove within his breast conceal'd,  
And into beauteous light from thence reveal'd.

These verses contain what Dr. Cudworth calls the grand arcanum of the
Orphic theology, that God is all things; which is likewise an Egyptian
doctrine, from whence it was derived through Orpheus into Greece: and
this sublime truth Plotinus  <span id="fr_12"></span>[l](#fn_12.md) himself
proves with his usual sagacity and depth. But here it is necessary to
observe, that Orpheus and the Platonists do not conceive the Deity to be
all things, as if he were a divisible, corporeal nature; but that he is
all things, because present every where, and to every being totally,
though more or less intimately present, according to the various
gradations and approximations of being. So that he is to be considered
as containing

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

all things, and yet as separate and apart from all; as the source of all
multitude, yet himself perfect unity; and as immensly prolific, yet
divinely solitary and ineffably good. Thus, according to Porphyry  <span
id="fr_13"></span>[m](#fn_13.md), explaining the properties of incorporeal
natures, God, intellect, and soul are each of them every where, because
.no where. But God is every where, and at the same time, in no place of
any being posterior to his nature; but he is only such as he is, and
such as he willed himself to be. But intellect is indeed in the Deity,
yet every and in no place of its subordinate essences. And soul is in
intellect, and in the Deity, every where and no where with respect to
body; but body exists in and in intellect, and .in God. And though all
beings, and nonentities, proceed from, and subsist in the

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

Deity, yet he is neither entities, or nonentities, nor has any
subsistence in them. For if he was alone every where, he would indeed be
all things, and in all: but because he is likewise no where, all things
are produced by him; so that they subsist in him because he is every
where, but are different from him because he is no where. Thus also
intellect being every where and no where, is the cause of souls, and of
natures subordinate to soul: at the same time it is neither soul, nor
such things as are posterior to the soul, nor has it any subsistence in
them; and this because it is not only every where in its subordinate
natures, but at the same time no where. Thus too, soul is neither body,
nor in body, but is the cause of body; because while it is every where
diffused through body, it is no where. And this procession of the
universe, extends as far as to

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

that nature  <span id="fr_14"></span>[n](#fn_14.md), which is incapable of
being at the same time every where and no where, but which partially
participates of each, And in another place of the same excellent
fragment, he tells us that the ancients explaining the property of an
incorporeal nature, as far as this can be effected by discourse, when
they affirmed it to be one, at the same time add, that it is likewise
all things; that it is every where, and no where, and that it is totally
present in every whole. He adds, they express its nature entirely by
contrary properties, that they may remove from it the fictitious and
delusive conceptions of bodies which obscure those properties by which
true being is known  <span id="fr_15"></span>[o](#fn_15.md).

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

We have before observed, that the Platonic philosophers, agreeable to
the doctrine of Orpheus, considered fecundity as, in an eminent degree,
the propery of a divine nature; and from this principle filled the
universe with Gods  <span id="fr_16"></span>[p](#fn_16.md). This opinion a
modern philosopher, or a modern writer on mythology, will doubtless
consider as too ridiculous to need a serious refutation the one, because
he believes the phenomena may be solved by mechanical causes; and the
other, in consequence of a system originating from prejudice, and
supported without proof. However, prejudice apart,

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

let us hear what the philosophers can urge in defence of this doctrine,
in addition to what we have already advanced. To begin then with Onatus
 <span id="fr_17"></span>[q](#fn_17.md) the Pythagorean: "Those," says he,
"who assert that there is but one God, and not many Gods, are deceived,
as not considering that the supreme dignity of the divine transcendency
consists in governing beings similar to itself, and in surpassing
others. But the other Gods have the same relation to this first and
intelligible God, as the dancer, to the Coryphæus, and as soldiers to
their general, whose duty is to follow their leader. And although the
same employment is common both to the ruler, and those who are ruled;
yet the latter, if destitute of a leader, could no longer conspire
together in one occupation; as the concord of the fingers and

\`

dancers, and the expedition of the army, must fail, if the one is
deprived of the Coryphæus and the other of the captain or commander." To
the same purpose Plotinus  <span id="fr_18"></span>[r](#fn_18.md) shews
that it is perfectly philosophical to suppose a multitude of Gods
subordinate to the One supreme. "It is necessary," says he, "that every
man should endeavour to be as good as possible, but at the same time, he
should not consider himself as the only thing that is good but should be
convinced that there are other good men, and good dæmons in the
universe, but much more Gods: who though inhabiting this inferior
region, yet look up to that higher world; and especially that most
blessed Soul, the ruling Divinity of this universe. From whence a

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

man ought to ascend still higher, and to celebrate the intelligible
Gods, but above all their great King; declaring his majesty in a
particular manner, by the multitude of Gods subordinate to his divinity.
For it is not the province of those who know the power of God, to
contract all into one, but rather to exhibit all that divinity which he
has displayed, who himself, remaining one, produces many, which proceed
from him and by him. For the universe subsists by him, and perpetually
speculates his divinity, together with each of the Gods it contains."
Should it be objected, that if such Gods (or exalted beings) really
existed, we should be able to demonstrate the reality of their
existence, in the same manner as that of one supreme God; we cannot
frame a better reply than in the words of Proclus  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[s](#fn_19.md). "And perhaps," says

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

he, "you may affirm that souls more swiftly forget things nearer to
them; but have a stronger remembrance of superior principles. For these
last operate on them more vigorously, through the sublimity of their
power, and appear to be present with them by their energy. And this
happens with respect to our corporeal fight; which does not perceive
many things situated on the earth, yet observes the inerratic sphere,
and the stars it contains; because these strongly irradiate our eyes
with their light. So the eye of our soul is more forgetful, and sooner
loses the sight of principles proximate to its nature, than of such as
are more elevated and divine. In like manner all religions and sects
confess that there is one highest principle, and men every where invoke
God as their helper; but that there are Gods in subordination to this
first cause, and that there is a providence proceeding

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

from these to the universe, all men do not believe; and this because the
one appears to them more perspicuously than the many."

Indeed in consequence of the Platonic doctrine of the pre-existence of
the soul, it is not strange that we should know so little of those
divine and exalted beings above us; since from our union with generation
and material concerns, we are imbued with oblivion, ignorance, and
error. "We are similar," as Porphyry  <span
id="fr_20"></span>[t](#fn_20.md) well observes, "to those who enter or
depart from a foreign region, not only in casting aside our native
manners and customs; but from the long use of a strange country we are
imbued with affections, manners, and laws foreign from our natural and
true religion, and with a strong propensity to

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

these unnatural habits." As, therefore, it is not wonderful that the
greatest part of those who inhabit a pestiferous region, should languish
and decline, but that a very few should preserve their natural strength;
so we ought not to wonder, that thus placed in generation, the multitude
of mankind are obnoxious to passions and depraved habits; but we ought
rather to be astonished if any souls, thus involved in the dark folds of
the body, and surrounded with such great and unceasing mutations, are
found sober, pure, and free from destructive perturbations. For it is
surely astonishing that the soul should live immaterially, in material
concerns; and preserve itself uncontaminated amidst such base
defilements; that it should drink of the cup of oblivion, and not be
laid asleep by the intoxicating draught; that it should elevate its eye

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

above the sordid darkness with which it is surrounded; and be able to
open the gates of truth, which, though contained in its essence, are
guarded and shut by terrene and material species. But that it is
possible to know more of such exalted natures than is generally
believed, by the assistance of the ancient philosophy, accompanied with
a suitable life, is, I am persuaded, true; and I would recommend the
arduous and glorious investigation to every liberal mind.

Let us now consider the nature of sacrifice according to Orpheus and the
Platonists; previous to which, I must beg leave to inform the reader,
that the Greek theologists and philosophers were not (as they are
represented by modern writers on mythology) so stupid as to worship the
creature instead of the Creator; and to neglect or confound that homage
and veneration,

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

which is due to the first cause of all. On the contrary, they considered
the supreme Being as honoured by the reverence paid to his most
illustrious offspring; and carefully distinguished between the worship
proper to the Deity, and to the subordinate Gods, as the following
discourse will abundantly evince. How, far indeed, such opinions maybe
consistent with revelation, it is not my business to determine. It is
sufficient for me, to give the most faithful account I am able of their
sentiments on this subject; to free their opinions from
misrepresentation; and to shew that God has not left himself without a
witness among the wise and learned of the heathens. But as I cannot give
a better account of the nature and antiquity of sacrifice than from the
writings of Porphyry, I shall present the reader with the following
paraphrase,

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

on part of the second book of his excellent work on abstinence.

"The period of time appears to have been immensely distant, from which,
as Theophrastus says, a nation the most learned of all others, and
inhabiting the sacred region formed by the Nile, began first of all,
from the domestic fire, to sacrifice to the celestial divinities; not
with myrrh or cassia, nor with the first fruits of frankincense mingled
with saffron, (for these were applied many ages afterwards, from error
increasing in certain degrees: I mean at the period when men having
surmounted the difficulties of a life, formerly oppressed with the cares
of procuring necessaries, and from the beginning to the end attended
with many labours and tears, sacrificed perhaps a few drops to the
Gods.) For at first they performed sacrifices, not with aromatics

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

but with the first fruits of the green herb; plucking it with their
hands, as a certain soft down or moss of prolific nature. Indeed the
earth produced trees before animals; but prior to trees, the annually
rising grass, the leaves, and roots, and entire produce of which having
collected, they sacrificed with fire: by this sacrifice, saluting the
visible celestial Gods, and rendering them through the ministry of fire
immortal honours. For we preserve as sacred to those divinities, a
perpetual fire in our temples; since this element is most similar to
their lucid frames. But with respect to fumigations from herbs produced
by the earth, they called the censer or pan, in which the herbs were
burnt, ϑυμιατήριος, and to perform sacrifice ϑύειν, and the sacrifices
themselves ϑυσίαι all which we have erroneously interpreted, as if these
words were

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

signatures of that error, which afterwards crept in among us; and hence
it is that we call the worship consisting from the slaughter of animals
ϑυσίαι.

Indeed so great was the care of the ancients, in retaining their
pirmæval customs, that they uttered imprecations against those who
deserted the old manner, and introduced a new one: and therefore they
called those herbs with which we now fumigate αρωμάτα, aromatics. But
the antiquity of the above mentioned fumigations will be perceived by
him who considers that even now many odorous kinds of wood, cut into
fragments, are employed in sacrifice. From whence it happened that the
earth now bearing trees together with grass, its earliest production,
men at first eating the fruits of oaks, burned only a few of these in
sacrifices to the Gods, on

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

account of the rarity of such sustenance; but sacrificed a multitude of
the leaves. Afterwards human life passed to a gentle diet, and
sacrifices were performed with nuts; from whence the proverb originated,
ἄλις δρυὸς, enough of the oak.

"But among the fruits of Ceres, after the first appearance of leguminous
barley, mankind were accustomed to sprinkle it, made into an entire
mass, in their first sacrifices. Afterwards breaking the barley, and
diminishing the nutriment into meal, having concealed the instruments of
so great a work, which afford divine assistance to human life, they
approached these as certain sacred concerns. But they cast the first
fruits of the barley (when bruised into meal) and which was more
esteemed than when whole, into the fire, in sacrifice to the Gods: from
whence even now, at the conclusion of the sacrifice, we make use of

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

meal mixed with wine and oil. By this custom indeed we indicate from
whence, and from what beginnings sacrifices have increased to the
present state: but, at the same time, we do not consider why such things
are performed. Mankind proceeding from these small beginnings, and the
earth yielding an abundant supply of corn and various fruits, they
judged that the first produce of all the rest should be offered in
sacrifices, with a view of pleasing the various orders of the Gods:
selecting many things for this purpose, and mingling not a few others
with these, if they possessed any thing beautiful, and on account of its
odoriferous nature accommodated to divine sensation. With some of these,
formed into garlands, they encircled the statues of the Gods; and others
they sacrificed with fire. Likewise to the Gods as the proper causes,
they poured

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

forth the divine drops of wine, and honey, and oil, when their uses were
first discovered.

"The truth of the preceding account appears to be confirmed by the
procession celebrated even now at Athens, in honour of the sun and the
hours. For in this solemnity grass is carried about, enwrapping the
kernels of olives, attended with figs, all kinds of pulse, oaken boughs
or acorns, the fruit of the strawberry, wheat, and barley, a mass of
dried figs, cakes composed from the meal of wheat and barley, heaped in
a pyramidal form, and last of all olives." Theophrastus then proceeds to
shew the impropriety of animal sacrifices, after which he adds: "But the
utility of fruits is the first and greatest of every production; the
first fruits of which are to be sacrificed to the Gods alone, and to the
Earth, the prolific parent of every herb.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

For Earth is the common Vesta of Gods and men, on whose fertile surface
reclining, as on the soft bosom of a mother or a nurse, we ought to
celebrate her divinity with hymns, and incline to her with filial
affection, as to the source of our existence. For thus, when we approach
to the conclusion of our mortal life, we shall be thought worthy of a
reception into the celestial regions, and of an association with the
race of immortal Gods, who now behold us venerating their divinities
with those fruits, of which they are the authors, and sacrificing in
their honour every herb of the all-bearing earth; at the same time not
esteeming every thing worthy or proper to be offered as a testimony of
our homage. "For as everything indiscriminately is not to be sacrificed
to the Gods, so perhaps we cannot find any thing sufficiently worthy,
with which we may worship them as they

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

deserve." Thus far Theophrastus. Porphyry then proceeds to shew after
what manner those ought to sacrifice who propose an intellectual life,
as the ultimate object of their pursuit.

"Let us also," says be, "sacrifice, but in a manner becoming the
offspring of intellect, bringing with us the most exalted offerings,
with our most exalted powers. To the Divinity indeed, who is above all
things, as a wise man said, neither sacrificing nor dedicating any thing
sensible or material; for there is nothing subsisting by material
concretion, which must not be deemed impure by a nature entirely free
from the contagion of body. Hence even the discourse, which is proffered
by the voice is not proper to be addressed to a cause so sublime and
ineffable; nor the internal speech of the soul, if contaminated with any
perturbation, or mixed with any

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

of the sensible phantasms of imagination. But we ought to worship the
supreme God, in the most profound and pure silence; and with the purest
thoughts concerning his exalted nature. It is requisite, therefore, that
having conjoined and assimilated ourselves to him, we should approach
this sublime principle with a pious sacrifice, which may redound to his
praise, and to our safety. But such a sacrifice can only be performed by
contemplating his divinity with a soul free from material affections,
and with the rational eye filled with intellectual light. But to the
offspring of this first God (I mean the intelligible divinities) we
should present the sacrifice of hymns, composed by the rational
principle. For it is customary to offer the first-fruits of such things
as every, God bestows upon us; by which he nourishes and supports our
existence, and which are subservient to the

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

purposes of sacrifice. As the husbandman, therefore, performs sacred
rites, by presenting handfuls of pulse and fruits, so ought we to
sacrifice our purest thoughts, and other goods of the soul, thanking the
divinities for the sublime contemplations they afford us, and for truly
feeding our intellectual part with the speculation of their essences;
for, conversing with us, and appearing to our mental sight; for shining
upon us with divine splendours, and by this means procuring for us true
salvation.

"But an exercise of this kind is performed in an indolent manner, by
many who apply themselves to philosophy, and who more sedulously
cultivating fame than honouring the divinity, are wholly employed about
statues, taking no care to learn after what manner, or whether or not
these intellectual beings are to be adored; nor by

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

properly consulting divine concerns, are they anxious to know, in how
great a degree, we ought to strive after an union with these exalted
natures. With such as these we by no means contend; since our only
endeavour is to obtain a knowledge of divinity, and to imitate pious and
ancient men, by frequently sacrificing of that contemplation which the
Gods have bestowed upon us, and by the use of which we are partakers of
real salvation.

"The Pythagoreans indeed who were very studious of numbers and lines,
for the most part sacrificed of these to the Gods; denominating this
number Minerva  <span id="fr_21"></span>[e](#fn_21.md), another Apollo; and
again, this justice, and another Temperance. They proceeded also

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

in a similar manner in geometrical figures. Hence they pleased the
divinities by sacrifices of this kind, calling each of them by their
proper names, for the purpose of obtaining their particular requests.
They often besides made such invocations subservient to the purposes of
divination; and if they required the investigation of any thing
particular, they used the visible celestial Gods, also the wandering and
fixed stars, of all which the sun ought to be placed as a leader, next
to this the moon; and, as a theologian observes, we should make fire
allied to these by a proximate conjunction. But the same person asserts
that the Pythagoreans sacrificed no animal, but offered the first fruits
of flour and honey, and of the diversified productions of the earth; nor
kindled fire on the bloody altar, says he, with other things of a
similar nature: but why should I transcribe such relations? For he who
is truly

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

studious of piety, knows why he ought not to sacrifice any thing
animated to Gods; but alone to genii, and other powers superior to man,
whether good or bad: he likewise knows to what kind of men it belongs to
sacrifice these, and every circumstance respecting those beings, who
require such sacrifices to be performed. With regard to other
particulars I shall be silent. But what some Platonists have divulged
will perspicuously illustrate the subject before us, which I shall
relate as follows.

"The first God, since he is incorporeal, immoveable, and indivisible,
neither existing, in any being, place, or time, nor even circumscribed
by, and as it were invested with himself, is in no respect indigent of
any thing external to his nature, as we have already observed. But this
last property of a divine essence is likewise true of the soul of the
world, possessing a triple divisibility,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

and being naturally self-motive, yet so constituted that it chuses to
move in an orderly and beautiful manner, and to agitate the corporeal
fabric of the world according to the most excellent and harmonious
reasons. But it associates to itself and is circularly invested with
body, although incorporeal and entirely destitute of passion. But to the
other Gods, to the world, and to the erratic and fixed stars, composed
from body and soul, and to the visible divinities, testimonials of
gratitude are to be offered by sacrificing with inanimate substances.
After these there remains that multiude of invisible beings, which Plato
indiscriminately calls dæmons. Some of these are allotted a peculiar
name by mankind, from whom they obtain divine honours and other kinds of
religious worship: but others of these are for the most part called by
no peculiar

name, but are obscurely worshipped by some

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

men, and are denominated according to certain streets or cities. But the
remaining multitude are called by the common name of dæmons. Concerning
all these, a general persuasion obtains, that their influence is noxious
and malignant if they are once angered because their accustomed worship
is neglected; and that they are again benificent if appeased by prayers
and supplications, by sacrifices and convenient rites.

"But the confused opinion which subsists concerning these beings, and
which has proceeded to great infamy, requires that we should distinguish
their nature according to the decisions of reason. After this manner
then they are distributed. As many souls as proceeding from the
universal soul, administer considerable parts of those places contained
under the lunar orb, who are indeed connected with an aerial part, but
subject

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

it to the dominion of reason, are to be esteemed good dæmons. We ought
to believe that all their operations tend to the utility of the concerns
subject to their dominion, whether they preside over certain animals, or
over fruits assigned to their charge, or over things subservient to
these particulars; such as prolific showers, moderate winds, serene
weather, and whatever is calculated to promote these, as a good
temperament of the seasons of the year, &c. They likewise administer to
us the use of music, and of every discipline, together with the
medicinal and gymnastic arts, and whatever else is allied to these. For
it is impossible that such dæmons can supply what is convenient and
proper; and at the same time be the authors of things destructive and
improper. In this class the messengers, as Plato calls them, between
Gods and men must be numbered, who convey our prayers and pious
offerings

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

to the Gods as judges of our conduct, and bring back to us in return
divine warnings, exhortations, and oracles. But as many souls as do not
properly govern the aerial part with which they are connected, but are
for the most part subdued by its influence, and are agitated and hurried
away by its brutal power in a rash and disorderly manner, whenever the
wrathful irritations and desires of the pneumatic part grow strong;
souls of this kind are properly denominated dæmons, but ought at the
same time to be called malevolent and base.

"All these, together with those who obtain a contrary power, are
invisible, and entirely imperceptible to human sensation for they are
not invested like terrene animals with a solid body; nor are they all
endued with one shape; but they possess a diversity of forms. However,
the forms impressed on their aerial part, are sometimes

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

apparent, and at other times obscured. Sometimes too evil dæmons change
their shapes. But this pneumatic part, so far as corporeal, is subject
to passion and change; and although it is so confined by the coercive
power of these demoniacal souls, that its form continues for a long
time, yet it is not by this means eternal. For is reasonable to believe,
that something continually flows from this aerial part; and that it
receives a nutriment accommodated to its nature. Indeed the πνευμα, or
aerial part of the good dæmons, consists in a certain commensurate
proportion, in the same manner as those bodies which are the objects of
our present perception. But the bodies of the malevolent dæmons are of a
discordant temperament, on which account they inhabit that aerial space
proximate to the earth, with a passive affection; and for the most part
govern

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

things subject to their dominion with a turbulent malignity. Hence there
is no evil which they do not endeavour to perpetrate. For their manners
are entirely violent and fraudulent, and destitute of the guardian
preservation of better dæmons; so that they machinate vehement and
sudden snares with which they rush on the unwary; sometimes endeavouring
to conceal their incursions, and sometimes acting, with open violence
against the subjects of their oppression." Thus far Porphyry: the length
of which quotation needs no apology; both on account of its excellence,
and because the unlearned reader will not find it elsewhere in English.
I would also add that I wish (with a proper sense of the greatness of
the undertaking) to offer this, together with the preceding and
subsequent paraphrases, as specimens of that method mentioned in the
Preface to this Work; and

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

which I cannot but consider as the best means of exhibiting the Greek
philosophy in modern languages.

Having then discoursed so largely from Porphyry concerning sacrifice,
and as he particularly recommends the sacrifice performed by
contemplation and divine hymns; let us hear his sentiments concerning
the nature of prayer, as they are preserved to us by Proclus in his
excellent Commentary on the Timæus, p. 64. "It is requisite (says
Proclus) before all things, that we understand something perspicuously
concerning the nature of prayer: I mean in what its essence consists,
what its perfection is, and from whence it becomes natural to our souls.
He then proceeds to relate the opinion of Porphyry as follows. For
Porphyry discoursing concerning such of the ancients as either approved

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

of, or exploded prayer, leads us through various opinions, which I shall
now summarily relate. Neither those who labour under the first kind of
impiety, I mean denying the existence of the Gods, claim any advantage
to themselves from prayer: nor yet those of the second class, who
entirely subvert a providence; for though they acknowledge the existence
of the Gods, yet they deny their provident concern for the affairs of
the universe. Nor again those of a third order, who they confess that
there are Gods, and that their providence extends to the world, yet
consider all things as produced by the divinities from necessity: for
the utility of prayer is derived from such things as are contingent, and
may have a different existence. But those who both acknowledge the being
of the Gods, and

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

their continual providence, and that some events are contingent, and may
subsist in a different manner; these men indeed may be truly said to
approve of prayer, and to confess that the Gods correct our life, and
establish it in safety. Proclus then proceeds to relate the reasons by
which Porphyry confirms its utility. "He adds that prayer in a
particular manner pertains to worthy men, because it conjoins them with
divinity; for similars love to be united together: but a worthy man is
in an eminent degree similar to the divine natures. We may likewise add,
that since good men are placed in custody, and confined by the dark
bands of the body as in a prison, they ought to pray to the Gods, that
it may be lawful for them to depart from hence. Besides, since we are as
children torn from the bosom of our parent,

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

we ought on this account to request by our prayers that we may return to
the Gods our true intellectual parents. If this is the case, do not they
who deny that prayers are to be offered to the Gods, and who prevent
their souls from being united with the divinities, that is with beings
more excellent than themselves, appear similar to those who are deprived
of their parents? Lastly, all nations who have flourished in the
exercise of wisdom, have applied themselves to divine prayers: as the
Bramins among the Indians, the Magi among the Persians, and amongst the
Greeks also, those who have excelled in the science of theology: for on
this account they instituted mysteries and initiatory rites (τελεται).
Besides, this consideration is not to be omitted, that since we are a
part of this universe, it is consonant to reason

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

that we should be dependent on it for support. For a conversion to the
universe procures safety to every thing which it contains. If therefore
you possess virtue, it is requisite you should invoke that divinity
which previously comprehended in himself every virtue: for universal
good is the cause of that good which belongs to you by participation.
And if you seek after some corporeal good, the world is endued with a
power which contains universal body. From hence therefore it is
necessary that perfection should also extend to the parts. Thus far that
most excellent philosopher Porphyry; in which quotation, as well as the
preceding, the reader must doubtless confess, that Proclus did not
without reason admire him, for what he calls his τὰ ιεροπρεπῆ νοήματα,
or conceptions adapted to holy concerns; for surely no

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

philosopher ever possessed them in a more eminent degree.

If it should be asked, in what the power of prayer consists, according
to these philosophers? I answer, in a certain sympathy and similitude of
natures to each other: just as in an extended chord, where when the
lowest part is moved, the highest presently after gives a responsive
motion. Or as in the firings of a musical instrument, attempered to the
same harmony; one chord trembling from the pulsation of another. as if
it were endued with sensation from symphony. So in the universe, there
is one harmony though composed from contraries; since they are at the
same time similar and allied to each other. For from the soul of the
world, like an immortal self-motive lyre, life every where resounds, but
in some things more inferior

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

and remote from perfection than in others. And with respect to the
super-mundane Gods, sympathy and similitude subsists in these as in
their most perfect exemplars; from whence they are participated by
sensible natures, their obscure and imperfect images. Hence (say they)
we must not conceive, that our prayers cause any animadversion in the
Gods, or, properly speaking, draw down their beneficence; but that they
are rather the means of elevating the soul to these divinities, and
disposing it for the reception of their supernal illumination. For the
divine irradiation, which takes place in prayer, shines and energizes
spontaneously, restoring unity to the soul, and causing our energy to
become one with divine energy. For such, according to these
philosophers, is the efficacy of prayer, that it unites all inferior
with all superior

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

beings. Since, as the great Theodorus says, all things pray except the
first.

Indeed so great is the power of similitude, that through its unifying
nature all things coalesce, and impart their particular properties to
ethers. Whilst primary natures distribute their gifts to such as are
secondary, by an abundant illumination, and effects are established in
the causes from which they proceed. But the connection and indissoluble
society of active universals, and of passive particulars, is every where
beheld. For the generative causes of things, are contained by similitude
in their effects; and in causes themselves their progeny subsist,
comprehended in perfect union and consent. Hence the celestial orbs
impart a copious defluxion of good to this terrestrial region; while
sublunary parts, assimilated in a certain respect to

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

the heavens, participate a perfection convenient to their nature.

Hence too, from the progressions of similitude, there are various
leaders in the universe. And many orders of angels dancing harmoniously
round their ruling deities; together with a multitude of dæmons, heroes,
and particular souls. There are besides multiform kinds of mortal
animals, and various powers of plants. So that all things tend to their
respective leaders, and are as it were stamped with one sign of domestic
unity; which is in form more evident., and in others more obscure. For
indeed similitude in first productions subsists more apparently; but in
those of the middle and extreme orders is obscured in consequence of the
gradations of progression. Hence images and exemplars derive their
hypostasis from

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

conciliating similitude; and every thing through this is familiar to
itself, and to its kindred natures.

But it is time to return from this digression to the business of
sacrifice and prayer. That we may therefore have a clearer view of the
nature and efficacy of each, let us hear the elegant and subtle Proclus
 <span id="fr_22"></span>[x](#fn_22.md), upon sacrifice and magic, of which
the following is a paraphrase.

"In the same manner as lovers gradually advance from that beauty which
is apparent in sensible forms, to that which is divine; so the ancient
priests, when they considered that there was a certain alliance and
sympathy in natural things to each

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

other, and of things manifest to occult powers, and by this means
discovered that all things subsist in all, they fabricated a sacred
science, from this mutual sympathy and similarity. Thus they recognized
things supreme, in such as are subordinate, and the subordinate in the
supreme: in the celestial regions terrene properties subsisting in a
causal and celestial manner; and in earth celestial properties, but
according to a terrene condition. For how shall we account for those
plants called heliotropes, that is attendants on the sun, moving in
correspondence with the revolution of its orb; but selenitropes, or
attendants on the moon, turning in exact conformity with her motion? it
is because all things pray, and compose hymns to the leaders of their
respective orders; but some intellectually, and others

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

rationally; some in a natural, and others after a sensible manner. Hence
the sunflower, as far as it is able, moves in a circular dance towards
the sun; so that if any one could hear the pulsation made by its circuit
in the air, he would perceive something composed by a sound of this
kind, in honour of its king such as a plant is capable of framing. Hence
we may behold the sun and moon in the earth, but according to a terrene
quality. But in the celestial regions, all plants, and stones, and
animals, possessing an intellectual life according to a celestial
nature. Now the ancients having contemplated this mutual sympathy of
things, applied for occult purposes both celestial and terrene natures,
by means of which through a certain similitude they deduced divine
virtues into this inferior abode. For indeed

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

similitude itself is a sufficient cause of binding things together in
union and consent. Thus if a piece of paper is heated, and afterwards
placed near a lamp, though it does not touch the fire, the paper will be
suddenly inflamed, and the flame will descend from the superior to the
inferior parts. This heated paper we may compare to a certain relation
of inferiors to superiors; and its approximation to the lamp, to the
opportune use of things according to time, place, and matter. But the
procession of fire in the paper aptly represents the presence of divine
light, to that nature which is capable of its reception. Lastly, the
inflammation of the paper may be compared to the deification of mortals,
and to the illumination of material natures, which are afterwards
carried upwards like

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

the fire of the paper, from a certain participation of divine feed.
Again, the lotus before the rising of the sun, folds its leaves into
itself, but gradually expands them on its rising: unfolding them in
proportion to the sun's ascent to the zenith; but as gradually
contracting them as that luminary descends to the west. Hence this plant
by the expansion and contraction of its leaves appears no less to honour
the sun than men by the gesture of their eye-lids, and the motion of
their lips. But this imitation and certain participation of supernal
light is not only, visible in plants, which possess but a vestige of
life, but likewise in particular stones. Thus the sun-stone, by its
golden rays, imitates those of the sun; but the stone called the eye of
heaven, or of the sun, has a figure

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

similar to the pupil of an eye, and a ray shines from the middle of the
pupil. Thus too the lunar stone, which has a figure similar to the moon
when horned, by a certain change of itself, follows the lunar motion.
Lastly, the stone called Helioselenus, i. e. of the sun and moon,
imitates after a manner the congress of those luminaries, which it
images by its colour. So that all things are full of divine natures;
terrestrial natures receiving the plenitude of such as are celestial,
but celestial of supercelestial essences; while every order of things
proceeds gradually in a beautiful descent, from the highest to the
lowest. For whatever is collected into one above the order of things, is
afterwards dilated in descending, various souls being distributed under
their various ruling divinities. In fine, some things turn

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

round correspondent to the revolutions of the sun, and others after a
manner imitate the solar rays, as the palm and the date: some the fiery
nature of the sun as the laurel, and other a different property. For
indeed we may perceive the properties which are collected in the sun,
every where distributed to subsequent natures constituted in a solar
order; that is, to angels, dæmons, souls, animals, plants, and stones.
Hence the authors of the ancient priesthood, discovered from things
apparent, the worship of superior powers, while they mingled some
things, and purified with others. They mingled many things indeed
together, because they saw that some simple substances possessed a
divine property (though not taken singly) sufficient to call down that
particular power, of which they were participants.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

Hence by the mingling of many things together, they attracted upon us a
supernal influx; and by the composition of one thing from many, they
symbolised with that one, which is above many; and composed statues from
the mixtures of various substances, conspiring in sympathy and consent.
Besides this, they collected composite odours, by a divine art, into
one, comprehending a multitude of powers, and symbolizing, with the
unity of a divine essence. Considering besides, that division
debilitates each of these, but that mingling them together restores them
to the idea of their exemplar; hence the ancient priests, by the mutual
relation and sympathy of things to one another, collected their virtues
into one, but expelled them by repugnancy and antipathy; purifying, when
it was requisite, with sulphur and

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

bitumen, and the sprinkling of marine water. For sulphur purifies from
the sharpness of its odour; but marine water on account of its fiery
portion. Besides this, in the worship of the Gods, they offered animals,
and other substances congruous to their nature; and received in the
first place the powers of dæmons as proximate to natural substances and
operations, by whose assistance they evocated these natural bodies to
which the they approached into their presence. Afterwards they proceeded
from dæmons to the powers and energies of the Gods, partly indeed from
dæmoniacal instruction, but partly by their own industry, aptly
interpreting symbols, and ascending to a proper intelligence of the
Gods. And lastly laying aside natural substances and their operations,
they received themselves into

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

the communion and fellowship of the Gods. Thus far Proclus, and thus
much for the theological doctrine of Orpheus, as contained in the works
of the latter Platonists. I persuade myself enough has been said in this
Dissertation to convince every thinking and liberal mind, that the Greek
theology as professed and understood by the Greek philosophers, is not
that absurd and nonsensical system, represented by modern prejudice and
ignorance, as the creed of the ancients. In consequence of a blind and
mistaken zeal it is common to ridicule the opinions of the ancient
philosophers, in order to establish the certainty of the Christian
religion. But surely revelation does not require so unwarrantable and
feeble a support, which in reality only betrays the cause it endeavours
to defend, by giving infidels occasion to suspect, either

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

weakness in its evidence, or obscurity in its fundamental doctrines.
Besides, the generality of these uncandid opponents know nothing of the
Platonical writers, from whom alone genuine information can be derived
on this sublime and intricate subject; and from whose works the
preceding Dissertation has been so abundantly enriched. Were these
invaluable books more generally known and understood, if they did not
refine our taste, at present so depraved, they would at least teach us
to admire the strength which human reason is capable of exerting, and to
be more modest in our pretensions to wisdom; they would silence ignorant
declaimers, and stop the immense increase of books on modern philosophy,
which are so rapidly hastening to the abyss of forgetfulness, like
streams into the ocean from which they originally flowed.
