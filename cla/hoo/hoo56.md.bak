###### LI.

### TO TRIETERICUS.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

BACCHUS fanatic, much-nam'd, blest, divine,  
Bull-fac'd Lenæan, bearer of the vine;  
From fire descended, raging, Nysian king,  
From whom initial ceremonies spring:  
Liknitan Bacchus, pure and fiery bright, 5  
Prudent, crown-bearer, wandering in the night;  
Pupil of Proserpine, mysterious pow'r,  
Triple, ineffable, Jove's secret flow'r:  
Ericapæus, first-begotten nam'd,  
Of Gods the father, and the offspring fam'd: 10  <span
id="fr_112"></span>[10](#fn_112.md)  
Bearing a sceptre, leader of the choir,  
Whose dancing feet, fanatic Furies fire,  
When the triennial band thou dost inspire.  
Loud-sounding, Tages, of a fiery light,  
Born of two mothers, Amphietus bright: 15

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

Wand'ring on mountains, cloth'd with skins of deer,  
Apollo, golden-ray'd, whom all revere.  
God of the grape with leaves of ivy crown'd,  
Bassarian, lovely, virgin-like, renown'd  
Come blessed pow'r, regard thy mystics voice, 10  
Propitious come, and in these rites rejoice.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_112"></span>[183:10](hoo56.htm#fr_112.md) Ver. 10.\] *Of Gods
the father*, &c. [According](errata.htm#11.md) to the fragment preserved by
Ficinus, and translated in our Dissertation, Trietericus is the nostic
power, or intellect of the Sun; and the Sun is in the sensible world,
what Protogonus or Phanes is in the intelligible world, or, in other
words, the Sun is the Phanes of the material world, for Trietericus is
expressly called in this Hymn Protogonus. With perfect agreement,
therefore, to the Orphic theology, Protogonus, considered as the first
of the secret genera of the Gods, is the father of the Gods; but
considered as the Sun of the material world, he is the offspring of the
Gods.
