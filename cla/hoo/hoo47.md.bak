###### XLII

### TO THE SEASONS.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

DAUGHTERS of Jove and Themis, seasons bright,  
Justice, and blessed peace, and lawful right,  
Vernal and grassy, vivid, holy pow'rs,  
Whose balmy breath exhales in lovely flow'rs  
All-colour'd seasons, rich increase your care, 5  
Circling, for ever flourishing and fair:  
Invested with a veil of shining dew,  
A flow'ry veil delightful to the view:

Attending Proserpine, when back from night,  
The Fates and Graces lead her up to light; 10  
When in a band-harmonious they advance,  
And joyful round her, form the solemn dance:  
With Ceres triumphing, and Jove divine;  
Propitious come, and on our incense shine;  
Give earth a blameless store of fruits to bear, 15  
And make a novel mystic's life your care.
