A

Dissertation

ON THE

Life and Theology of ORPHEUS.

### SECT. I.

THE great obscurity and uncertainty in which the history of Orpheus is
involved, affords very little matter for our information; and even
renders that little, inaccurate and precarious. Upon surveying the
annals of past ages, it seems that the greatest geniuses, have been
subject to this historical darkness as is evident in those great lights
of antiquity, Homer and Euclid, whose writings indeed enrich mankind
with perpetual

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

stores of knowledge and delight; but whose lives are for the most part
concealed in impenetrable oblivion. But this historical uncertainty, is
no where so apparent, as in the person of Orpheus; whose name is indeed
acknowledged and celebrated by all antiquity (except perhaps Aristotle
alone); while scarcely a vestige of his life is to be found amongst the
immense ruins of time. For who has ever been able to affirm any thing
with certainty, concerning his origin, his age, his parents, his
country, and condition? This alone may be depended on, from general
assent, that there formerly lived a person named Orpheus, whose father
was Œagrus, who lived in Thrace, and who was the son of a king, who was
the founder of theology, among the Greeks; the institutor of their life
and morals; the first of prophets, and the prince of poets; himself the
offspring of a Muse; who taught the

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

Greeks their sacred rites and mysteries, and from whose wisdom, as from
a perpetual and abundant fountain, the divine muse of Homer, and the
philosophy of Pythagoras, and Plato, flowed; and, lastly, who by the
melody of his lyre, drew rocks, woods, and wild beasts, stopt rivers in
their course, and ever, moved the inexorable king of hell; as every
page, and all the writings of antiquity sufficiently evince. Since thus
much then may be collected from universal testimony, let us, pursue the
matter a little farther, by investigating more accurately the history of
the original Orpheus; with that of the great men who have, at different
periods, flourished under this venerable name.

The first and genuine Orpheus, was a poet of Thrace, and, according to
the opinion of many, the disciple of Linus; who flourished, says Suidas,
at the time when the kingdom of the Athenians was

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

dissolved. Some assert that he was prior to the Trojan wars, and that he
lived eleven, or according to others nine generations. But the Greek
word γενεα, or generation, according to Gyraldus,  <span
id="fr_0"></span>[a](#fn_0.md), signifies the space of seven years; for
unless this is supposed, how is it possible that the period of his life
can have any foundation in the nature of things? Plutarch indeed,
Heraclitus, Suidas, and some grammarians, assert that this word
signifies a space of thirty years: but omitting the discussion of this
latter opinion, from its impossibility, we shall embrace the former,
agreeable to which Orpheus lived sixty-three years; a period, if we may
believe the astrologers fatal to all, and especially to great men, as
was the case with Cicero and Aristotle.

Our poet, according to fabulous tradition, was torn in pieces by
Ciconian

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

women: on which account, Plutarch affirms the Thracians were accustomed
to beat their wives, that they might revenge the death of Orpheus.
Hence, in the vision of Herus Pamphilius, in Plato, the soul of Orpheus,
being destined to descend into another body, is reported to have chosen
rather that of a swan than to be born again of a woman; having conceived
such hatred against the sex, on account of his violent death. The cause
of his destruction is variously related by authors. Some report that it
arose from his being engaged in puerile loves, after the death of
Eurydice. Others, that he was destroyed by women intoxicated with wine,
because he was the means of men relinquishing their connexion. Others
affirm, according to the tradition of Pausanias, that upon the death of
Eurydice, wandering to Aornus, a place in Threspotia, where it was
customary to evocate the souls of the dead,

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

having recalled Eurydice to life, and not being able to detain her, he
destroyed himself; nightingales building their nests, and bringing forth
their young upon his tomb; whose melody, according to report, exceeded
every other of this species. Others again ascribe his laceration, to his
having celebrated every divinity except Bacchus, which is very
improbable, as among the following hymns there are nine to that Deity,
under different appellations. Others report that he was delivered by
Venus herself, into the hands of the Ciconian women, because his mother
Calliope, had not determined justly between Venus and Proserpine,
concerning the young Adonis. Many affirm that he was struck by
lightning, according to Pausanias; and Diogenes confirms this by the
following verses composed as he asserts, by the Muses upon his death:

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

Here, by the Muses plac'd, with golden lyre,  
Great Orpheus rests; destroy'd by heav'nly fire.

Again, the sacred mysteries called Threscian, derived their appellation,
from our Thracian bard, because he first introduced sacred rites and
religion into Greece; and hence the authors of initiation in these
mysteries, were called Orpheotelestæ. Besides according to Lucian, our
Orpheus brought astrology, and the magical arts into Greece; and with
respect to his drawing trees and wild beasts by the melody of his lyre,
Palæphatus accounts for it as follows  <span
id="fr_1"></span>[b](#fn_1.md). The mad Bacchanalian nymphs, says he,
having violently taken away cattle and other necessaries of life,
retired for some days into the mountains. When the citizens having
expected their return for a long time, and fearing the worst for their
wives and daughters, called Orpheus, and intreated him

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

to invent some method of drawing them from the mountains. But he tuning
his lyre, agreeable to the orgies of Bacchus, drew the mad nymphs from
their retreats; who descended from the mountains bearing at first ferulæ
and branches of every kind of trees. But to the men who were
eye-witnesses of these wonders, they appeared at first to bring down the
very woods; and from hence gave rise to the fable.

But so great was the reputation of Orpheus, that he was deified by the
Greeks; and Philostratus relates, that his head gave oracles in Lesbos,
which, when separated from his body by the Thracian women, was, together
with his lyre, carried down the river Hebrus into the Sea. In this
manner says Lucian  <span id="fr_2"></span>[c](#fn_2.md), singing as it
were his funeral oration, to which

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

the chords of his lyre impelled by the winds, gave a responsive harmony,
it was brought to Lesbos and buried. But his lyre was suspended in the
Temple of Apollo; where it remained for a considerable space of time.
Afterwards, when Neanthus, the son of Pittacus the tyrant, found that
the lyre drew trees and wild beasts with its harmony, he earnestly
desired its possession; and having corrupted the priest privately with
money, he took the Orphean lyre, and fixed another similar to it, in the
temple. But Neanthus considering that he was not safe in the city in the
day time, departed from it by night; having concealed the lyre in his
bosom, on which he began to play. But as he was a rude and unlearned
youth, he confounded the chords; yet pleasing himself with the sound,
and fancying he produced a divine harmony, he considered himself as the
blessed successor of Orpheus.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

However, in the midst of his transports, the neighbouring dogs, roused
by the sound, fell upon the unhappy harper and tore him to pieces. The
former part of this fable is thus excellently explained by Proclus in
his commentaries (or rather fragments of commentaries) on Plato's
Republic; a work I would earnestly recommend to the liberal, for the
great light it affords to the recondite theology of the Greeks. Orpheus,
says he, on account of his perfect erudition, is reported to have been
destroyed in various ways; because, in my opinion, men of that age,
participated partially of the Orphic harmony; for they could not receive
a universal and perfect science. But the principal part of his melody
was received by the Lesbians; and on this account, perhaps, the head of
Orpheus, when seperated from his body, is said to have been carried to
Lesbos. Fables of this

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

kind, therefore, are related of Orpheus, no otherwise than of Bacchus,
of whose mysteries he was the priest. Thus far Proclus, and thus much
concerning the first, or Thracian Orpheus. The second Orpheus was an
Arcadian, or, according to others, a Ciconian, from Bisaltia of Thrace;
and is reported to be more ancient than Homer, and the Trojan war. He
composed figments of fables called (μυθοποιϊα) and epigrams; and is,
according to Gyraldus, the author of the following hymns; though I
rather chuse to refer them, with the Fathers Vossius and Eschenbach, to
Onomacritus, or the fourth Orpheus, of Crotonia. The third Orpheus was
of Odrysius, a city of Thrace, near the river Hebrus; but Dionysius, in
Suidas, denies his existence. The fourth Orpheus was of Crotonia, who
flourished in the time of Pisistratus, about the fiftieth Olympiad; and
is doubtless the same

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

Onomacritus the author of these hymns. He writ Decennalia, δεκαετηρια,
and, in the opinion of Gyraldus, the Argonautics, which are now extant
under the name of Orpheus, with other writings called Orphical, but
which, according to Cicero  <span id="fr_3"></span>[d](#fn_3.md), some
ascribe to Cecrops the Pythagorean. The last Orpheus, was Camarinæus, a
most excellent versifier; and the same according to Gyraldus whose
descent into hell is so universally known. And thus much for the life of
Orpheus.
