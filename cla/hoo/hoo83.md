###### LXXVIII.

### TO THEMIS.

###### The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.

ILLUSTRIOUS Themis, of celestial birth,  
Thee I invoke, young blossom of the earth;  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125.md)  
Beauteous-eyed virgin; first from thee alone,  
Prophetic oracles to men were known,  
Giv'n from the deep recesses of the fane 5  
In sacred Pytho, where renown'd you reign;  
From thee, Apollo's oracles arose,  
And from thy pow'r his inspiration flows.  
Honour'd by all, of form divinely bright,  
Majestic virgin, wand'ring in the night: 10  
Mankind from thee first learnt initial rites,  
And Bacchus' nightly choirs thy soul delights;  
For holy honours to disclose is thine,  
With all the culture of the pow'rs divine.  
Be present, Goddess, to my pray'r inclin'd,  
And bless the mystic rites with fav'ring mind.
