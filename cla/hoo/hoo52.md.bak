###### XLVII.

### TO SABASIUS.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS

HEAR me, illustrious father, dæmon fam'd.  
Great Saturn's offspring, and Sabasius nam'd;

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

Inserting Bacchus, bearer of the vine,  
And founding God, within thy thigh divine,  
That when mature, the Dionysian God 5  
Might burst the bands of his conceal'd abode,  
And come to sacred Tmolus, his delight,  
Where Ippa dwells, all beautiful and bright.  
Come blessed Phrygian God, the king of all,  
And aid thy mystics, when on thee they call. 10
