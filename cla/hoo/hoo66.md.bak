###### LXI.

### TO JUSTICE.

###### The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.

THE piercing eye of Justice bright, I sing,  <span
id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md)  
Plac'd by the throne of heav'n's almighty king,

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

Perceiving thence, with vision unconfin'd,  
The life and conduct of the human kind  
To thee, revenge and punishment belong, 5  
Chastising ev'ry deed, unjust and wrong;  
Whose pow'r alone, dissimilars can join,  
And from th' equality of truth combine:  
For all the ill, persuasion can inspire,  
When urging bad designs, with counsel dire, 10  
'Tis thine alone to punish; with the race  
Of lawless passions, and incentives base;  
For thou art ever to the good inclin'd,  
And hostile to the men of evil mind.  
Come, all-propitious, and thy suppliant hear, 15  
When Fate's predestin'd, final hour draws near.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[193:1](hoo66.htm#fr_117.md) Ver. i.\] *The
piercing eye*. &c. This Hymn is cited by Demosthenes in his first speech
against Aristogiton, as follows: "Let us, says the orator overlooking
all custom, judge righteous judgment; let us reverence Eunomia that
loves equity, and preserves states; and inexorable Δικη right or justice
<span id="page_194">p. 194</span> whom Orpheus our instructor, in the
most holy initiations, τελεται, places by the throne of Jove, inspecting
the affairs of men. Let each of us imagine her piercing eye is now upon
us, and think and vote so as not to dishonour *her* from whom every
judge has his name."
