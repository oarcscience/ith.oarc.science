###### XXIII.

### TO THE NEREIDS.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

DAUGHTERS of Nereus, resident in caves  
Merg'd deep in Ocean, sporting thro' the waves;  
Fanatic fifty nymphs, who thro' the main  
Delight to follow in the Triton's train,  
Rejoicing close behind their cars to keep; 5  
Whose forms half wild, are nourish'd by the deep,  
With other nymphs of different degree  
Leaping and wand'ring thro' the liquid sea:  
Bright, wat'ry dolphins, sonorous and gay,  
Well pleas'd to sport with bachanalian play; 10  
Nymphs beauteous-ey'd, whom sacrifice delights,  
Send rich abundance on our mystic rites;  
For you at first disclos'd the rites divine,  
Of holy Bacchus and of Proserpine,  
Of fair Calliope from whom I spring, 15  
And of Apollo bright, the Muse's king.
