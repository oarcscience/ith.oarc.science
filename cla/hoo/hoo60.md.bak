###### LV.

### TO ADONIS.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

MUCH-nam'd, and best of dæmons, hear my pray'r,  
The desart-loving, deck'd with tender hair;  
Joy to diffuse, by all desir'd is thine,  
Much form'd, Eubulus; aliment divine

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

Female and Male, all charming to the sight, 5  
Adonis ever flourishing and bright;  
At stated periods doom'd to set and rise,  
With splendid lamp, the glory of the skies.  <span
id="fr_115"></span>[8](#fn_115.md)  
Two-horn'd and lovely, reverenc'd with tears,  
Of beauteous form, adorn'd with copious hairs. 10  
Rejoicing in the chace, all-graceful pow'r,  
Sweet plant of Venus, Love's delightful flow'r:  
Descended from the secret bed divine,  
Of lovely-hair'd, infernal Proserpine.  
'Tis thine to fink in Tartarus profound, 15  
And shine again thro' heav'ns illustrious round,  
With beauteous temp'ral orb restor'd to sight;  
Come, with earth's fruits, and in these flames delight.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_115"></span>[188:8](hoo60.htm#fr_115.md) Ver. 8.\] *With
splendid lamp*, &c. Proclus, in his elegant Hymn to the Sun, celebrates
him as frequently called Adonis; and this perfectly agrees with the
present epithet, and with many others in the Hymn.
