###### XXXI.

### TO PALLAS.

###### A HYMN.

ONLY-Begotten, noble race of Jove,  
Blessed and fierce, who joy'st in caves to rove:  <span
id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_88.md)

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

O, warlike Pallas, whose illustrious kind,  
Ineffable and effable we find:  
Magnanimous and fam'd, the rocky height, 5  
And groves, and shady mountains thee delight:  
In arms rejoicing, who with Furies dire  
And wild, the souls of mortals dost inspire.  
Gymnastic virgin of terrific mind,  
Dire Gorgons bane, unmarried, blessed, kind: 10  
Mother of arts, imperious; understood,  
Rage to the wicked., wisdom to the good:  
Female and male, the arts of war are thine,  
Fanatic, much-form'd dragoness, divine:  <span
id="fr_89"></span>[14](#fn_89.md)  
O'er the Phlegrean giants rous'd to ire, 15  <span
id="fr_90"></span>[15](#fn_90.md)  
Thy coursers driving, with destruction dire.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

Sprung from the head of Jove, of splendid mien,  
Purger of evils, all-victorious queen.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

Hear me, O Goddess, when to thee I pray,  
With supplicating voice both night and day, 20

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

And in my latest hour, peace and health,  
Propitious times, and necessary wealth,  
And, ever present, be thy vot'ries aid,  
O, much implor'd, art's parent, blue eyed maid.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_88"></span>[156:2](hoo36.htm#fr_88.md) XXXI. Ver. 2.\] *Who
joy'st in caves to rove*. Proclus, in Plat. Theol, P. 372. informs us,
that there are three zoogonic or vivific <span id="page_157">p.
157</span> monads, Diana, Proserpine, and Minerva; and that these three
divinities exist together. Hence the reason is obvious why this Goddess
is celebrated as living in caves, and delighting in rocks and mountains,
from her agreement with Diana: and hence is appears, that Rutikenius was
mistaken in imagining these epithets were misplaced. We may likewise see
the reason from hence, why Minerva is called, in line 14, Female and
Male, as well as the Moon; and why the Moon is called in the Hymn to her
πάνσοφε κύρη, i. e. "all-wife virgin."

<span id="fn_89"></span>[157:14](hoo36.htm#fr_89.md) Ver. 14.\]
*Much-form'd dragoness*. It is easy to perceive the  
agreement between Minerva, who is the same with divine  
Wisdom and Providence, and a Dragon; since according to  
Phurnutus, a dragon is of a vigilant and guardian nature.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[157:15](hoo36.htm#fr_90.md) Ver. 15.\] *O'er the
Phlegrean giants*, &c. The fable of the giants is common; but its
philosophical explanation is, I fear, but little known and less
understood. For the sake of thc liberal, therefore, the following
account of the battles of the Gods, <span id="page_158">p. 158</span>
from the excellent Commentary of Proclus, on Plato's Republic, p. 373,
is inserted. "The divisible progressions of all beings, and the
diversities of substances, receive a supernal origin, from a division of
unknown primitive causes, which are mutually at strife with principles,
subject to the universe. For some determine their essence about unity,
on which they depend; and others receive in themselves a never-failing
power of infinity, by which they generate universals, and a cause of
multitude and progression, according to which they possess their
peculiar essences. Hence, after the same manner as the first principles
of beings, are mutually separated from each other; so all divine genera
and true beings have among themselves a progression distinguished by
order. In consequence of this, some insert in things posterior the
principle cause of unity; but others afford the power of separation.
Some are the causes of conversion to inferiors, and of collecting the
multitude of progressive natures to their proper principles: while
others promote their progression and procreation, emanating from
principles, as their source. Some supply the power of generating to
inferiors; and others exhibit a constant and undefiled purity. There are
some, again, containing the cause of separable goods; and others, of
such goods as subsist together with their recipients. Indeed, after this
manner, the various contrariety of such kinds appears in all the
administrations of true being. Thus the station or quiet of things
constantly establishing being in themselves, resists efficacious and
vital powers of motion. So the communication of identity, on every side
similar to itself (if the expression may be allowed) is specially
opposed to the discretions of diversity. Thus, too, similitude fights
with dissimilitude, and equality with inequality. Since this is the
case, can it be wonderful, that mythologists, perceiving a contrariety
of this kind among the Gods, and the first principles <span
id="page_159">p. 159</span> of things, should represent it to their
pupils by contentions and wars? For though the divine genera are always
united with each other, yet they preside as well over those who
administer to union, as over those who machinate confusion. And this is
the first reason of the wars of the Gods. But it is lawful to produce
another reason, and to affirm that the Gods are indeed indivisibly
conjoined, and subsist together in mutual uniformity: but that their
progressions into the universe, and participations by recipient natures,
become disjoined and divisible, and by this means filled with
contrariety. For things subject to the power of the Gods, cannot receive
their diffused powers, and multiform illustrations, without mixture and
confusion. Hence the last orders dependent on the Gods, since they are
produced by a long interval from the first causes, but are contiguous to
the concerns they administer, and adhere to matter, contract
contrariety, and an all-various division; partially presiding over
material affairs, and diminishing and dispersing those separate powers,
which before subsisted in a superior manner, uniformly and indivisibly,
in their primitive causes. Since, then, such and so many are the ways,
by which, according to the mysteries of theologists, war is usually
referred to the Gods; other poets who, seized with fury, have
interpreted divine concerns, introduced the battles and wars of the
Gods, according to the first reasons, i. e. so far as the divine genera
admit of diversity, according to the first principles of all things. For
fables, concealing truth under a veil, shew that such things as
[recall](errata.htm#5) to [principles](errata.htm#6.md), oppose and fight
with the authors of generation: collecting with separating natures,
things unifying with such as multiply by the progression of beings; and
universal genera, with such as operate in a partial and particular
manner. Hence they relate, that the Titans (or dæmons subservient to
Nature) fight with Bacchus, (or Nature) and the giants with Jove. <span
id="page_160">p. 160</span> For union, and an indivisible work, is
proper to Bacchus and Jupiter, as the demiurgic causes of the world; but
the Titans and Giants produce the demiurgic powers into multitude;
partially administering the concerns of the universe, and existing as
the proximate parents of material natures." Thus far Proclus. For a
farther account of Minerva, see the note to Hymn ix. to Nature.
