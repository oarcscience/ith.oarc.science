###### XXVI.

### TO THE MOTHER OF THE GODS.

###### The FUMIGATION from a Variety of ODORIFEROUS SUBSTANCES.

Mother of Gods, great nurse of all, draw near,  
Divinely honor'd, and regard my pray'r:  
Thron'd on a car, by lions drawn along,  
By bull-destroying lions, swift and strong,  
Thou sway'st the sceptre of the pole divine, 5  <span
id="fr_82"></span>[5](#fn_82.md)  
And the world's middle seat, much-fam'd, is thine.  
Hence earth is thine, and needy mortals share  
Their constant food, from thy protecting care:  
From thee at first both Gods and men arose;  
From thee, the sea and ev'ry river flows. 10  
Vesta, and source of good, thy name we find  
To mortal men rejoicing to be kind;  
For ev'ry good to give, [thy](errata.htm#3.md) soul delights;  
Come, mighty pow'r, propitious to our rites,  
All-taming, blessed, Phrygian saviour, come, 15  
Saturn's great queen, rejoicing in the drum.

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

Celestial, ancient, life-supporting maid,  
Fanatic Goddess, give thy suppliant aid;  
With joyful aspect on our incense shine,  
And, pleas'd, accept the sacrifice divine.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_82"></span>[151:5](hoo31.htm#fr_82.md) Ver. 5.\] We have
already observed, that the mother of the Gods is the same with Rhea; and
Proclus, in the second book of his Commentary on Euclid, informs us,
that the pole of the [world](errata.htm#4.md) is called by the Pythagoreans
the seal of Rhea.
