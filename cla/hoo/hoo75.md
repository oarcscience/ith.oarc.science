###### LXX.

### TO MELINOE.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

Call Melinoe, saffron-veil'd, terrene,  
Who from infernal Pluto's sacred queen,  
Mixt with Saturnian Jupiter, arose,  
Near where Cocytus' mournful river flows;  
When under Pluto's semblance, Jove divine 5  
Deceiv'd with guileful arts dark Proserpine.  
Hence, Partly black thy limbs and partly white,  
From Pluto dark, from Jove etherial, bright  
Thy colour'd members, men by night inspire  
When seen in specter'd forms with terrors dire; 10  
Now darkly visible, involv'd in night,  
Perspicuous now they meet the fearful fight.  
Terrestrial queen expel wherever found  
The soul's mad fears to earth's remotest bound;  
With holy aspect on our incense shrine, 15  
And bless thy mystics, and the rites divine.
