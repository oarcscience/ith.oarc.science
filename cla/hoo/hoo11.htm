<P>WITH holy voice I call the stars on high,<BR>
Pure sacred lights and genii of the sky.<BR>
Celestial stars, the progeny of Night,<BR>
In whirling circles beaming far your light,<BR>
Refulgent rays around the heav'ns ye throw, 5<BR>
Eternal fires, the source of all below.<BR>
With flames significant of Fate ye shine,<BR>
And aptly rule for men a path divine.<BR>
In seven bright zones ye run with wand'ring flames,<BR>
And heaven and earth compose your lucid frames: 10 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A><BR>
With course unwearied, pure and fiery bright<BR>
Forever shining thro' the veil of Night.<BR>
Hail twinkling, joyful, ever wakeful fires!<BR>
Propitious shine on all my just desires;</P>

<P>These sacred rites regard with conscious rays, 15<BR>
And end our works devoted to your praise.</P>

It is an Orphic and Pythagoric opinion that the stars are inhabited; on which account they are called in this hymn, earthly. But the greatest geniuses of antiquity were of the same opinion; such as Anaxagoras, Aristarchus, Heraclitus, Plato, &amp;c. and among the Platonists not a few, as Alcinous, Plotinus, and Plutarch. Thales too is said to have called the stars earthly, by which it is probable he was of the same opinion.</P>
