###### VII.

### TO THE SUN.

###### The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE and MANNA.

HEAR golden Titan, whose eternal eye  
With broad survey, illumines all the sky.  
Self-born, unwearied in diffusing light,  
And to all eyes the mirrour of delight:  
Lord of the seasons, with thy fiery car 5  
And leaping coursers, beaming light from far:  
With thy right hand the source of morning light,  <span
id="fr_53"></span>[7](#fn_53)  
And with thy left the father of the night.  
Agile and vig'rous, venerable Sun,  
Fiery and bright around the heav'ns you run. 10  
Foe to the wicked, but the good man's guide,  
O'er all his steps propitious you preside:  
With various founding, golden lyre, 'tis mine  
To fill the world with harmony divine.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

Father of ages, guide of prosp'rous deeds, 15  
The world's commander, borne by lucid steeds,  
Immortal Jove, all-searching, bearing light,  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[17](#fn_54)  
Source of existence, pure and fiery bright  
Bearer of fruit, almighty lord of years,  
Agil and warm, whom ev'ry pow'r reveres. 20  
Great eye of Nature and the starry skies,  
Doom'd with immortal flames to set and rise  
Dispensing justice, lover of the stream,  
The world's great despot, and o'er all supreme.  
Faithful defender, and the eye of right, 25  <span
id="fr_55"></span>[25](#fn_55)  
Of steeds the ruler, and of life the light:  
With founding whip four fiery steeds you guide,  
When in the car of day you glorious ride.  
Propitious on these mystic labours shine,  
And bless thy suppliants with a life divine. 30

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_53"></span>[122:7](hoo12.htm#fr_53) Ver. 7.\] *With thy
right hand*, &c. Proclus in lib. vi. Theol. Plat. P, 380, says that
those who are skilled in divine concerns, attribute two hands to the
Sun; denominating one the right hand, the other the left.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[123:17](hoo12.htm#fr_54) Ver. 17.\] *Immortal
Jove*. According to the Orphic and Platonic philosophers, the Sun is the
same in the sensible, as Apollo in the intellectual, and Good in the
intelligible World. Hence Proclus in Theol. Plat. p. 289. from the
occult union subsisting between Good, Apollo, and the Sun, calls the Sun
βασιλεὺς τυ παντός, or king of the universe: and it is well known that
Jupiter is the demiurgus of the world. So that the Sun in perfect
conformity to this Theology is called immortal Jove.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[123:25](hoo12.htm#fr_55) Ver. 25.\] *Faithful
defender*. Proclus, lib. v. in Timæum, in. forms us in the words of
Orpheus ὅτι ἥλιον μὲν ἐπέστησε τοῖς ὅλιος, ὀ δημιυργος, και φύλακα ἀυτὸν
ἔτευξε, κέλευσε τε πασιν ἀναάσσειν. "That the demiurgus placed the Sun
in the universe, and fabricated him as its guardian, commanding him to
govern all things."
