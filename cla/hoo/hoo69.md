###### LXIV.

### TO MARS <span id="fr_118"></span>[\*](#fn_118).

###### The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.

Magnanimous, unconquer'd, boistrous Mars,  
In darts rejoicing, and in bloody wars  

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

Fierce and untam'd, whose mighty pow'r can make  
The strongest walls from their foundations shake:  
Mortal destroying king, defil'd with gore, 5  
Pleas'd with war's dreadful and tumultuous roar:  
Thee, human blood, and swords, and spears delight,  
And the dire ruin of mad savage fight.  
Stay, furious contests, and avenging strife,  
Whose works with woe, embitter human life; 10  
To lovely Venus, and to Bacchus yield,  
To Ceres give the weapons of the field;  
Encourage peace, to gentle works inclin'd,  
And give abundance, with benignant mind.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_118"></span>[196:\*](hoo69.htm#fr_118) This deity,
according to Proclus, in Repub. p. 388. perpetually discerns and
nourishes, and constantly excites the contrarieties of the universe,
that the world may exist perfect and entire from its parts. But he
requires the assistance of Venus, that he may insert order and harmony
into things contrary and discordant.
