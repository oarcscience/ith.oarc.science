###### LXVII.

### TO HEALTH.

###### The FUMIGATION from MANNA.

O Much-desir'd, prolific, gen'ral queen,  
Hear me, life-bearing, Health, of beauteous mien,  
Mother of all; by thee diseases dire,  
Of bliss destructive, from our life retire;  
And ev'ry house is flourishing and fair, 5  
If with rejoicing aspect thou art there:  
Each dædal art, thy vig'rous force inspires,  
And all the world thy helping hand desires;  
Pluto life's bane alone resists thy will,  
And ever hates thy all-preserving skill. 10  
O fertile queen, from thee forever flows  
To mortal life from agony repose;  
And men without thy all-sustaining ease,  
Find nothing useful, nothing form'd to please;  
Without thy aid, not Plutus' self can thrive, 15  
Nor man to much afflicted age arrive;  
For thou alone of countenance serene,  
Dost govern all things, universal queen.  
Assist thy mystics with propitious mind,  
And far avert disease of ev'ry kind.
