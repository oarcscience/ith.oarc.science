<span id="fn_127"></span>[220:2](hoo88.htm#fr_127.md) XXXIII. Ver. 2\] *The
seat containing of unweary'd flame*. Vesta is celebrated in this Hymn as
the earth, and is the same with the mother of the Gods; as is evident
from the Hymn to that divinity, in which she is expressly called Vesta.
Now this perfectly agrees with the fragment of Philolaus the
Pythagorean, preserved by Stobæus, in Eclog. Phys. p. 51. "Philolaus
(says he) places fire in the middle at the centre, which he calls the
Vesta of the universe, the house of Jupiter, the mother of the Gods, and
the basis, coherence, and measure of nature." From whence it appears,
that they are greatly mistaken who suppose the Pythagoreans meant the
sun, by the fire at the centre: and this is still more evident, from the
following words of Simplicius de Cælo, lib ii. Οἱ δὲ γνησίςερον ἀυτον
μετασχόντες, <span id="page_221">p. 221</span> μετασχόντες, τὸ μὲν πῦρ
ἐν τῷ μέσῳ φασὶ τὴν δημιυργικην δίναμιν, εκ τῦ μέσυ ὅλην τηγ γην
τρέφυσαν, καὶ τὸ ψυχόμενον ἀυτῆς ἀνεγέιρυσαν. δἰ ὃ οἱ μέν, ΖΗΝΟΣ ΠΥΡΓΟΝ
ἀυτὸ καλυσιν. ὡσ ἀυτὸς ἐν τοῖσ Πυθαγορείοις διηγήσατο. οἱ δὲ ΔΙΟΣ
ΦΥΛΑΚΗΝ ὡσ ἐν τὐτοις. οῖ δὲ, ΔΙΟΣ ΘΡΟΝΟΝ᾽ ὡς ἄλλοι φασίν. χεδνρον (sic
lege et non ἄντρον) δὲ τὴν γῆν ἔλεγον, ὡς ὄργανον καὶ αὐτὴν τῦ χρονῦ
ἡμερων γαρ ἐςιν ἅυτη, καὶ νυχτων, αἰτία. That is, "But those who more
clearly perceive these affairs, call the fire in the middle a demiurgic
power, nourishing the whole earth from the midst, and exciting and
enlivening whatever it contains of a frigid nature: on which account
some call it the tower of Jupiter, as he (i.e. Aristotle) relates in his
Phythagorics. But others, the keeper or guardian of Jove; as he relates
in these (i.e. his books of Cælo). But according to others, it is the
throne of Jupiter. But they called the earth a centre, as being itself
an organ or instrument of time: for it is the cause of day and night."

<span id="fn_128"></span>[221:8](hoo88.htm#fr_128.md) Ver. 8\] *Laughing
and blessed*. Proclus, in Plat. Rep. p. 384. observes, that we ought to
interpret the laughter of the Gods as an exuberant operation in the
universe; and the gladness of mundane concerns, under the providence of
a divine cause. But since such a providence, says he, is
incomprehensible, and is a never failing communication of all divine
goods; we must allow that Homer justly calls the laughter of the Gods
ἄσϐεςος {Greek *á?s<u>b</u>e<u>s</u>o<u>s</u>*} or inextinguishable. He
adds, that fables do not represent the Gods as always weeping, but
affirm that they laugh <span id="page_222">p. 222</span> without
ceasing; because tears are symbols of their providence in mortal
concerns, which are continually subject to existence and decay: but
laughter is a sign of their effects in the universe, and of its
principal parts, which are ever moved in one and the same orderly
manner. Hence, since we divide demiurgical powers between Gods and men,
we assign laughter to the generation of the Gods, but tears to the
formation of men or animals. Hence, the poet sings in his Hymn to the
Sun, *O Apollo, the mortal race of men is the subject of thy tears; but
the celestial race of Gods springs from laughter*. But since we divide
the works of divinity into things celestial, and those subject to the
moon; after the same manner, we attribute laughter to the first, and
grief to the second. Lastly, when we reason concerning the generations
and corruptions of things below the moon, we refer the one to the
weeping, and the other to the laughter of the Gods. And hence in our
mysteries, the ministers of sacred rites, at a certain time order each
of these to be celebrated. He then concludes with *an excellent
observation*, that men of simple understandings are unable to comprehend
intellectually mystical ceremonies and fables of this kind; since *such
men* destitute of science, produce nothing but absurd confusion about
the religion of the Gods.
