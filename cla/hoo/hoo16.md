###### XI.

### TO HERCULES.

###### The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.

HEAR, pow'rful, Hercules untam'd and strong,  
To whom vast hands, and mighty works belong,  
Almighty Titan, prudent and benign,  
Of various forms, eternal and divine,  
Father of Time, the theme of gen'ral praise, 5  
Ineffable, ador'd in various ways.  
Magnanimous, in divination skill'd  
And in the athletic labours of the field.  
'Tis thine strong archer, all things to devour,  
Supreme, all-helping, all-producing pow'r; 10  
To thee mankind as their deliv'rer pray,  
Whose arm can chase the savage tribes away:

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

Uweary'd, earth's best blossom, offspring fair,  
To whom calm peace, and peaceful works are dear.  <span
id="fr_68"></span>[13](#fn_68.md)

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

Self-born, with primogenial fires you shine, 15  <span
id="fr_69"></span>[15](#fn_69.md)  
And various names and strength of heart are thine.  
Thy mighty head supports the morning light,  
And bears untam'd, the silent gloomy night;  
From east to west endu'd with strength divine,  
Twelve glorious labours to absolve is thine; 20

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Supremely skill'd, thou reign'st in heav'n's abodes,  
Thyself a God amid'st th' immortal Gods.  
With arms unshaken, infinite, divine,  
Come, blessed pow'r, and to our rites incline;  
The mitigations of disease convey, 25  
And drive disasterous maladies away.  
Come, shake the branch with thy almighty arm,  
Dismiss thy darts and noxious fate disarm.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[134:13](hoo16.htm#fr_68.md) Ver. 13\] *Earth's
best blossom*. Since, according to the Orphic theology, there are two
worlds, the intelligible and the sensible, the former of which is the
source of the latter; so, according to the same theology, the first
contains in a primary, causal, and intellectual manner, what the second
comprehends secondarily and sensibly. Hence it contains an intellectual
heaven and earth, not like the material, existing in place, and affected
with the circulations of Time; but subsisting immaterially in the stable
essence of eternity. In this divine world, another sun, and moon, and
stars shine with intellectual light; for every thing there is perfectly
lucid, light continually mingling with light. There, as Plotinus
divinely observes, every star is a sun: and though all things are beheld
in every thing, yet some things are more excellent than others. Now from
this intellectual heaven and earth, resident in Phanes, the king and
father of the universe, Orpheus, according to Proclus, derives the
orders of the Gods, subordinate to this sensible heaven and earth: and
among these he relates the following progeny of the intellectual earth,
as preserved by Proclus in his excellent Commentary on the Timæus, p.
295, and by Athenagoras in Apol. "She produced seven beautiful pure
virgins with voluble eyes, and seven sons, all of them kings, and
covered with downy hair; the daughters are Themis and prudent Tethys,
and fair-haired Mnemosyne, and blessed Thea; together with Dione, having
an illustrious form, and Phœbe and Rhea the mother of king Jupiter. But
this illustrious earth generated celestial sons, which are also sirnamed
Titans, because they took revenge on the great starry heaven; and these
are Cæus and great Cræus, and robust Phorcys, and Saturn, and Ocean, and
Hyperion, and Iapetus." Now Hercules is celebrated in this Hymn as the
Sun, as the nineteenth and twentieth lines particularly evince; and the
Sun is the same with Hyperion; <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> hence
the reason is obvious why Hercules is called "earth's best blossom." And
we shall find that Saturn in the following hymn is called "blossom of
the earth;" and Themis, in Hymn 78, "young blossom of the earth;" and
the Titans, in Hymn 36, "the illustrious progeny of heaven and earth."

<span id="fn_69"></span>[135:15](hoo16.htm#fr_69.md) Ver. 15.\] *With
primogenial fires you shine*. Since the intelligible world, which, as we
have already observed, was produced from Æther and Chaos, is nothing
else than the comprehension of all the demiurgic ideas in the divine
mind, which is, according to Orpheus, the God Phanes; it remains that
the sensible world, which is but the image τυ Νοζτυ Παραδείγματοσ of an
intelligible paradigm, should be produced according to its similitude,
and filled with its proper divinities. Now Phanes, the author of the
sensible world, is represented by Orpheus (for the purpose of
symbolically representing the causal production of the universe) as
adorned with the heads of various animals. According to Athenagoras,
with the head of a dragon, of a lion, and the countenance of the God
himself; but according to Proclus and others, in the words of Orpheus,
with the countenance of a ram, a bull, a serpent and a lion. And this
Phanes Athenagoras informs us is denominated by Orpheus, Hercules, and
Time. Hence we see the reason why Hercules is said to shine with
primogenial fires; since he is no other than Protogonos in the
intelligible, and the Sun in the sensible world. Hence too the reason is
apparent why Saturn who is the same with Time, is called in the
following Hymn, τιτὰν i.e. Titan, or the Sun.
