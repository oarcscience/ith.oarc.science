###### LXXII.

### TO THE DÆMON, OR GENIUS.

###### The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.

THEE, mighty-ruling, Dæmon dread, I call,  
Mild Jove, life-giving, and the source of all:  
Great Jove, much-wand'ring, terrible and strong,  
To whom revenge and tortures dire belong.  
Mankind from thee, in plenteous wealth abound, 5  
When in their dwellings joyful thou art found;  
Or pass thro' life afflicted and distress'd,  
The needful means of bliss by thee supprest.  
'Tis thine alone endu'd with boundless might,  
To keep the keys of sorrow and delight. 10

O holy, blessed father, hear my pray'r,  
Disperse the seeds of life-consuming care;  
With fav'ring mind the sacred rites attend,  
And grant my days a glorious, blessed end.
