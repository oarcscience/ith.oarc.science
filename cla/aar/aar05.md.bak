# CHAPTER III

### SEASONAL RITES: THE SPRING FESTIVAL

WE have seen in the last chapter that whatever interests primitive man,
whatever makes him feel strongly, he tends to re-enact. Any one of his
manifold occupations, hunting, fighting, later ploughing and sowing,
provided it be of sufficient interest and importance, is material for a
*dromenon* or rite. We have also seen that, weak as he is in
individuality, it is not his private and personal emotions that tend to
become ritual, but those that are public, felt and expressed officially,
that is, by the whole tribe or community. It is further obvious that
such dances, when they develop into actual rites, tend to be performed
at fixed times. We have now to consider when and why. The element of
fixity and regular repetition in rites cannot be too strongly
emphasized. It is a factor of paramount importance, essential to the
development from ritual to art, from *dromenon* to drama.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

The two great interests of primitive man are food and children. As Dr.
Frazer has well said, if man the individual is to live he must have
food; if his race is to persist he must have children. "To live and to
cause to live, to eat food and to beget children, these were the primary
wants of man in the past, and they will be the primary wants of men in
the future so long as the world lasts." Other things may be added to
enrich and beautify human life, but, unless these wants are first
satisfied, humanity itself must cease to exist. These two things,
therefore, food and children, were what men chiefly sought to procure by
the performance of magical rites for the regulation of the seasons. They
are the very foundation-stones of that ritual from which art, if we are
right, took its rise. From this need for food sprang seasonal, periodic
festivals. The fact that festivals are seasonal, constantly recurrent,
solidifies, makes permanent, and as already explained ([p.
42](aar04.htm#page_42).md), in a sense intellectualizes and abstracts the
emotion that prompts them.

The seasons are indeed only of value to primitive man because they are
related, as he swiftly and necessarily finds out, to his

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

food supply. He has, it would seem, little sensitiveness to the æsthetic
impulse of the beauty of a spring morning, to the pathos of autumn. What
he realizes first and foremost is, that at certain times the animals,
and still more the plants, which form his food, appear, at certain
others they disappear. It is these times that become the central points,
the focuses of his interest, and the dates of his religious festivals.
These dates will vary, of course, in different countries and in
different climates. It is, therefore, idle to attempt a study of the
ritual of a people without knowing the facts of their climate and
surroundings. In Egypt the food supply will depend on the rise and fall
of the Nile, and on this rise and fall will depend the ritual and
calendar of Osiris. And yet treatises on Egyptian religion are still to
be found which begin by recounting the rites and mythology of Osiris, as
though these were primary, and then end with a corollary to the effect
that these rites and this calendar were "associated" with the worship of
Osiris, or, even worse still, "instituted by" the religion of Osiris.
The Nile regulates the food supply of Egypt, the monsoon that of certain
South Pacific islands;

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

the calendar of Egypt depends on the Nile, of the South Pacific islands
on the monsoon.

In his recent *Introduction to Mathematics* <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) Dr. Whitehead has pointed out how the "whole
life of Nature is dominated by the existence of periodic events." The
rotation of the earth produces successive days; the path of the earth
round the sun leads to the yearly recurrence of the seasons; the phases
of the moon are recurrent, and though artificial light has made these
phases pass almost unnoticed to-day, in climates where the skies are
clear, human life was largely influenced by moonlight. Even our own
bodily life, with its recurrent heart-beats and breathings, is
essentially periodic. <span id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) The
presupposition of periodicity is indeed fundamental to our very
conception of life, and but for periodicity the very means of measuring
time as a quantity would be absent.

Periodicity is fundamental to certain departments of mathematics, that
is evident; it is perhaps less evident that periodicity is a factor that
has gone to the making of ritual, and hence, as we shall see, of art.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And yet this is manifestly the case. All
primitive calendars are ritual calendars, successions of feast-days, a
patchwork of days of different quality and character recurring; pattern
at least is based on periodicity. But there is another and perhaps more
important way in which periodicity affects and in a sense causes ritual.
We have seen already that out of the space between an impulse and a
reaction there arises an idea or "presentation." A "presentation" is,
indeed, it would seem, in its final analysis, only a delayed,
intensified desire--a desire of which the active satisfaction is
blocked, and which runs over into a "presentation." An image conceived
"presented," what we call an *idea* is, as it were, an act prefigured.

Ritual acts, then, which depend on the periodicity of the seasons are
acts necessarily delayed. The thing delayed, expected, waited for, is
more and more a source of value, more and more apt to precipitate into
what we call an idea, which is in reality but the projected shadow of an
unaccomplished action. More beautiful it may be, but comparatively
bloodless, yet capable in its turn of acting as an initial motor impulse
in the

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

cycle of activity. It will later ([p. 70](#page_70).md) be seen that these
periodic festivals are the stuff of which those faded, unaccomplished
actions and desires which we call gods--Attis, Osiris, Dionysos--are
made.

 

To primitive man, as we have seen, beast and bird and plant and himself
were not sharply divided, and the periodicity of the seasons was for
all. It will depend on man's social and geographical conditions whether
he notices periodicity most in plants or animals. If he is nomadic he
will note the recurrent births of other animals and of human children,
and will connect them with the lunar year. But it is at once evident
that, at least in Mediterranean lands, and probably everywhere, it is
the periodicity of plants and vegetation generally which depends on
moisture, that is most striking. Plants die down in the heat of summer,
trees shed their leaves in autumn, all Nature sleeps or dies in winter,
and awakes in spring.

Sometimes it is the dying down that attracts most attention. This is
very clear in the rites of Adonis, which are, though he rises again,
essentially rites of lamentation. The details

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

of the ritual show this clearly, and specially as already seen in the
cult of Osiris. For the "gardens" of Adonis the women took baskets or
pots filled with earth, and in them, as children sow cress now-a-days,
they planted wheat, fennel, lettuce, and various kinds of flowers, which
they watered and tended for eight days. In hot countries the seeds
sprang up rapidly, but as the plants had no roots they withered quickly
away. At the end of the eight days they were carried out with the images
of the dead Adonis and thrown with them into the sea or into springs.
The "gardens" of Adonis became the type of transient loveliness and
swift decay.

 

"What waste would it be," says Plutarch, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)"what inconceivable waste, for God to create
man, had he not an immortal soul. He would be like the women who make
little gardens, not less pleasant than the gardens of Adonis in earthen
pots and pans; so would our souls blossom and flourish but for a day in
a soft and tender body of flesh without any firm and solid root of life,
and then be blasted and put out in a moment."

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

Celebrated at midsummer as they were, and as the "gardens" were thrown
into water, it is probable that the rites of Adonis may have been, at
least in part, a rain-charm. In the long summer droughts of Palestine
and Babylonia the longing for rain must often have been intense enough
to provoke expression, and we remember ([p. 19](aar03.htm#page_19).md) that
the Sumerian Tammuz was originally *Dumuzi-absu*, "True Son of the
Waters." Water is the first need for vegetation. Gardens of Adonis are
still in use in the Madras Presidency. <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md)
At the marriage of a Brahman "seeds of five or nine sorts are mixed and
sown in earthen pots which are made specially for the purpose, and are
filled with earth. Bride and bridegroom water the seeds both morning and
evening for four days; and on the fifth day the seedlings are thrown,
like the real gardens of Adonis, into a tank or river."

Seasonal festivals with one and the same intent--the promotion of
fertility in plants, animals and man--may occur at almost any time of
the year. At midsummer, as we have seen, we may have rain-charms; in
autumn we shall have harvest festivals; in late autumn

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

and early winter among pastoral peoples we shall have festivals, like
that of Martinmas, for the blessing and purification of flocks and herds
when they come in from their summer pasture. In midwinter there will be
a Christmas festival to promote and protect the sun's heat at the winter
solstice. But in Southern Europe, to which we mainly owe our drama and
our art, the festival most widely celebrated, and that of which we know
most, is the Spring Festival, and to that we must turn. The spring is to
the Greek of to-day the "ánoixis," "the Opening," and it was in spring
and with rites of spring that both Greek and Roman originally began
their year. It was this spring festival that gave to the Greek their god
Dionysos and in part his drama.

 

In Cambridge on May Day two or three puzzled and weary little boys and
girls are still to be sometimes seen dragging round a perambulator with
a doll on it bedecked with ribbons and a flower or two. That is all that
is left in most parts of England of the Queen of the May and
Jack-in-the-Green, though here and there a maypole survives and is
resuscitated by enthusiasts about folk-dances.

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

\[paragraph continues\] But in the days of "Good Queen Bess" merry
England, it would seem, was lustier. The Puritan Stubbs, in his
*Anatomie of Abuses*, <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) thus describes
the festival:

"They have twentie or fortie yoke of oxen, every oxe havyng a sweete
nosegaie of flowers tyed on the tippe of his hornes, and these oxen draw
home this Maiepoole (this stinckying idoll rather), which is covered all
over with flowers and hearbes, bound round aboute with stringes from the
top to the bottome, and sometyme painted with variable colours, with two
or three hundred men, women, and children, following it with great
dovotion. And thus beyng reared up, with handkerchiefes and flagges
streaming on the toppe, they strewe the ground about, binde greene
boughs about it, set up summer haules, bowers, and arbours hard by it.
And then fall they to banquet and feast, to leap and daunce aboute it,
as the heathen people did at the dedication of their idolles, whereof
this is a perfect patterne or rather the thyng itself."

The stern old Puritan was right, the may-pole was the perfect pattern of
a heathen

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "idoll, or rather the thyng itself." He would
have exterminated it root and branch, but other and perhaps wiser
divines took the maypole into the service of the Christian Church, and
still <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) on May Day in Saffron Walden
the spring song is heard with its Christian moral--

"A branch of May we have brought you,  
  And at your door it stands;  
It is a sprout that is well budded out,  
  The work of our Lord's hands."

The maypole was of course at first no pole cut down and dried. The gist
of it was that it should be a "sprout, well budded out." The object of
carrying in the May was to bring the very spirit of life and greenery
into the village. When this was forgotten, idleness or economy would
prompt the villagers to use the same tree or branch year after year. In
the villages of Upper Bavaria Dr. Frazer <span
id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12.md) tells us the maypole is renewed once every
three, four, or five years. It is a fir-tree fetched from the forest,
and amid all the wreaths, flags, and inscriptions with which it is
bedecked, an

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

essential part is the bunch of dark green foliage left at the top, "as a
memento that in it we have to do, not with a dead pole, but with a
living tree from the greenwood."

At the ritual of May Day not only was the fresh green bough or tree
carried into the village, but with it came a girl or a boy, the Queen or
King of the May. Sometimes the tree itself, as in Russia, is dressed up
in woman's clothes; more often a real man or maid, covered with flowers
and greenery, walks with the tree or carries the bough. Thus in
Thuringia, <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) as soon as the trees
begin to be green in spring, the children assemble on a Sunday and go
out into the woods, where they choose one of their playmates to be
Little Leaf Man. They break branches from the trees and twine them about
the child, till only his shoes are left peeping out. Two of the other
children lead him for fear he should stumble. They take him singing and
dancing from house to house, asking for gifts of food, such as eggs,
cream, sausages, cakes. Finally, they sprinkle the Leaf Man with water
and feast on the food. Such a Leaf Man is our English Jack-in-the-Green,
a chimney-sweeper

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

who, as late as 1892, was seen by Dr. Rouse walking about at Cheltenham
encased in a wooden framework covered with greenery.

The bringing in of the new leafage in the form of a tree or flowers is
one, and perhaps the simplest, form of spring festival. It takes little
notice of death and winter, uttering and emphasizing only the desire for
the joy in life and spring. But in other and severer climates the
emotion is fiercer and more complex; it takes the form of a struggle or
contest, what the Greeks called an *agon*. Thus on May Day in the Isle
of Man a Queen of the May was chosen, and with her twenty maids of
honour, together with a troop of young men for escort. But there was not
only a Queen of the May, but a Queen of Winter, a man dressed as a
woman, loaded with warm clothes and wearing a woollen hood and fur
tippet. Winter, too, had attendants like the Queen of the May. The two
troops met and fought; and which-ever Queen was taken prisoner had to
pay the expenses of the feast.

In the Isle of Man the real gist of the ceremony is quite forgotten, it
has become a mere play. But among the Esquimaux <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

there is still carried on a similar rite, and its magical intent is
clearly understood. In autumn, when the storms begin and the long and
dismal Arctic winter is at hand, the central Esquimaux divide themselves
into two parties called the Ptarmigans and the Ducks. The ptarmigans are
the people born in winter, the ducks those born in summer. They stretch
out a long rope of sealskin. The ducks take hold of one end, the
ptarmigans of the other, then comes a tug-of-war. If the ducks win there
will be fine weather through the winter; if the ptarmigans, bad. This
autumn festival might, of course, with equal magical intent be performed
in the spring, but probably autumn is chosen because, with the dread of
the Arctic ice and snow upon them, the fear of winter is stronger than
the hope of spring.

 

The intense emotion towards the weather, which breaks out into these
magical *agones*, or "contests," is not very easy to realize. The
weather to us now-a-days for the most part damps a day's pleasuring or
raises the price of fruit and vegetables. But our main supplies come to
us from other lands and other weathers, and we find it hard to think

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

ourselves back into the state when a bad harvest meant starvation. The
intensely practical attitude of man towards the seasons, the way that
many of these magical dramatic ceremonies rose straight out of the
emotion towards the food-supply, would perhaps never have been fully
realized but for the study of the food-producing ceremonies of the
Central Australians.

The Central Australian spring is not the shift from winter to summer,
from cold to heat, but from a long, arid, and barren season to a season
short and often irregular in recurrence of torrential rain and sudden
fertility. The dry steppes of Central Australia are the scene of a
marvellous transformation. In the dry season all is hot and desolate,
the ground has only patches of wiry scrub, with an occasional parched
acacia tree, all is stones and sand; there is no sign of animal life
save for the thousand ant-hills. Then suddenly the rainy season sets in.
Torrents fill the rivers, and the sandy plain is a sheet of water.
Almost as suddenly the rain ceases, the streams dry up, sucked in by the
thirsty ground, and as though literally by magic a luxuriant vegetation
bursts forth, the desert blossoms

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

as a rose. Insects, lizards, frogs, birds, chirp, frisk and chatter. No
plant or animal can live unless it live quickly. The struggle for
existence is keen and short.

It seems as though the change came and life was born by magic, and the
primitive Australian takes care that magic should not be wanting, and
magic of the most instructive kind. As soon as the season of fertility
approaches he begins his rites with the avowed object of making and
multiplying the plants, and chiefly the animals, by which he lives; he
paints the figure of the emu on the sand with vermilion drawn from his
own blood; he puts on emu feathers and gazes about him vacantly in
stupid fashion like an emu bird; he makes a structure of boughs like the
chrysalis of a Witchetty grub--his favourite food, and drags his body
through it in pantomime, gliding and shuffling to promote its birth.
Here, difficult and intricate though the ceremonies are, and uncertain
in meaning as many of the details must probably always remain, the main
emotional gist is clear. It is not that the Australian wonders at and
admires the miracle of his spring, the bursting of the flowers and the
singing of birds; it is not

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

that his heart goes out in gratitude to an All-Father who is the Giver
of all good things; it is that, obedient to the push of life within him,
his impulse is towards food. He must eat that he and his tribe may grow
and multiply. It is this, his will to live, that he *utters and
represents*.

 

The savage utters his will to live, his intense desire for food; but it
should be noted, it is desire and will and longing, not certainty and
satisfaction that he utters. In this respect it is interesting to note
that his rites and ceremonies, when periodic, are of fairly long
periods. Winner and summer are not the only natural periodic cycles;
there is the cycle of day and night, and yet among primitive peoples but
little ritual centres round day and night. The reason is simple. The
cycle of day and night is so short, it recurs so frequently, that man
naturally counted upon it and had no cause to be anxious. The emotional
tension necessary to ritual was absent. A few peoples, *e. g.* the
Egyptians, have practised daily incantations to bring back the sun.
Probably they had at first felt a real tension of anxiety, and
then--being

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

a people hidebound by custom--had gone on from mere conservatism. Where
the sun returns at a longer interval, and is even, as among the
Esquimaux, hidden for the long space of six months, ritual inevitably
arises. They play at cat's-cradle to catch the ball of the sun lest it
should sink and be lost for ever.

Round the moon, whose cycle is long, but not too long, ritual very early
centred, but probably only when its supposed influence on vegetation was
first surmised. The moon, as it were, practises magic herself; she waxes
and wanes, and with her, man thinks, all the vegetable kingdom waxes and
wanes too, all but the lawless onion. The moon, Plutarch <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) tells us, is fertile in its light and
contains moisture, it is kindly to the young of animals and to the new
shoots of plants. Even Bacon <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md) held
that observations of the moon with a view to planting and sowing and the
grafting of trees were "not altogether frivolous." It cannot too often
be remembered that primitive man has but little, if any, interest in sun
and moon and heavenly bodies for their inherent beauty or wonder; he
cares for them, he holds them

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

sacred, he performs rites in relation to them mainly when he notes that
they bring the seasons, and he cares for the seasons mainly because they
bring him food. A season is to him as a *Hora* was at first to the
Greeks, the *fruits of a season*, what our farmers would call "a good
*year*."

 

The sun, then, had no ritual till it was seen that he led in the
seasons; but long before that was known, it was seen that the seasons
were annual, that they went round in a *ring*; and because that annual
ring was long in revolving, great was man's hope and fear in the winter,
great his relief and joy in the spring. It was literally a matter of
death and life, and it was as death and life that he sometimes
represented it, as we have seen in the figures of Adonis and Osiris.

Adonis and Osiris have their modern parallels, who leave us in no doubt
as to the meaning of their figures. Thus on the 1st of March in
Thüringen a ceremony is performed called "Driving out the Death." The
young people make up a figure of straw, dress it in old clothes, carry
it out and throw it into the river. Then they come back, tell

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

the good news to the village, and are given eggs and food as a reward.
In Bohemia the children carry out a straw puppet and burn it. While they
are burning it they sing--

"Now carry we Death out of the village,  
The new Summer into the village,  
Welcome, dear Summer,  
Green little corn."

In other parts of Bohemia the song varies; it is not Summer that comes
back but Life.

"We have carried away Death,  
And brought back Life."

In both these cases it is interesting to note that though Death is
dramatically carried out, the coming back of Life is only announced, not
enacted.

Often, and it would seem quite naturally, the puppet representing Death
or Winter is reviled and roughly handled, or pelted with stones, and
treated in some way as a sort of scapegoat. But in not a few cases, and
these are of special interest, it seems to be the seat of a sort of
magical potency which can be and is transferred to the figure of Summer
or Life, thus causing, as it were, a sort of Resurrection.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

\[paragraph continues\] In Lusatia the women only carry out the Death.
They are dressed in black themselves as mourners, but the puppet of
straw which they dress up as the Death wears a white shirt. They carry
it to the village boundary, followed by boys throwing stones, and there
tear it to pieces. Then they cut down a tree and dress it in the white
shirt of the Death and carry it home singing.

So at the Feast of the Ascension in Transylvania. After morning service
the girls of the village dress up the Death; they tie a threshed-out
sheaf of corn into a rough copy of a head and body, and stick a
broomstick through the body for arms. Then they dress the figure up in
the ordinary holiday clothes of a peasant girl--a red hood, silver
brooches, and ribbons galore. They put the Death at an open window that
all the people when they go to vespers may see it. Vespers over, two
girls take the Death by the arms and walk in front; the rest follow.
They sing an ordinary church hymn. Having wound through the village they
go to another house, shut out the boys, strip the Death of its clothes,
and throw the straw body out of the window to the boys, who fling it
into a river. Then

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

one of the girls is dressed in the Death's discarded clothes, and the
procession again winds through the village. The same hymn is sung. Thus
it is clear that the girl is a sort of resuscitated Death. This
resurrection aspect, this passing of the old into the new, will be seen
to be of great ritual importance when we come to Dionysos and the
Dithyramb.

These ceremonies of Death and Life are more complex than the simple
carrying in of green boughs or even the dancing round maypoles. When we
have these figures, these "impersonations," we are getting away from the
merely emotional dance, from the domain of simple psychological motor
discharge to something that is very like rude art, at all events to
personification. On this question of personification, in which so much
of art and religion has its roots, it is all-important to be clear.

 

In discussions on such primitive rites as "Carrying out the Death,"
"Bringing in Summer," we are often told that the puppet of the girl is
carried round, buried, burnt; brought back, because it "personifies the
Spirit of Vegetation," or it "embodies the

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Spirit of Summer." The Spirit of Vegetation is
"incarnate in the puppet." We are led, by this way of speaking, to
suppose that the savage or the villager first forms an idea or
conception of a Spirit of Vegetation and then later "embodies" it. We
naturally wonder that he should perform a mental act so high and
difficult as abstraction.

A very little consideration shows that he performs at first no
abstraction at all; abstraction is foreign to his mental habit. He
begins with a vague excited dance to relieve his emotion. That dance
has, probably almost from the first, a leader; the dancers choose an
actual *person*, and he is the root and ground of *personification*.
There is nothing mysterious about the process; the leader does not
"embody" a previously conceived idea, rather he begets it. From his
personality springs the personification. The abstract idea arises from
the only thing it possibly can arise from, the concrete fact. Without
*per*ception there is no *con*ception. We noted in speaking of dances
([p. 43](aar04.htm#page_43).md) how the dance got generalized; how from
many commemorations of actual hunts and battles there arose the hunt
dance and the war dance. So, from

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

many actual living personal May Queens and Deaths, from many actual men
and women decked with leaves, or trees dressed up as men and women,
arises *the* Tree Spirit, *the* Vegetation Spirit, *the* Death.

At the back, then, of the fact of personification lies the fact that the
emotion is felt collectively, the rite is performed by a band or chorus
who dance together *with a common leader*. Round that leader the emotion
centres. When there is an act of Carrying-out or Bringing-in he either
is himself the puppet or he carries it. Emotion is of the whole band;
drama doing tends to focus on the leader. This leader, this focus, is
then remembered, thought of, imaged; from being *per*ceived year by
year, he is finally *con*ceived; but his basis is always in actual fact
of which he is but the reflection.

Had there been no periodic festivals, personification might long have
halted. But it is easy to see that a recurrent *per*ception helps to
form a permanent abstract *con*ception. The different actual recurrent
May Kings and "Deaths," *because they recur*, get a sort of permanent
life of their own and become beings apart. In this way a conception,

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

a kind of *daimon*, or spirit, is fashioned, who dies and lives again in
a perpetual cycle. The periodic festival begets a kind of not immortal,
but perennial, god.

Yet the faculty of conception is but dim and feeble in the mind even of
the peasant to-day; his function is to perceive the actual fact year by
year, and to feel about it. Perhaps a simple instance best makes this
clear. The Greek Church does not gladly suffer images in the round,
though she delights in picture-images, *eikons*. But at her great spring
festival of Easter she makes, in the remote villages, concession to a
strong, perhaps imperative, popular need; she allows an image, an actual
idol, of the dead Christ to be laid in the tomb that it may rise again.
A traveller in Eubœa <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) during Holy
Week had been struck by the genuine grief shown at the Good Friday
services. On Easter Eve there was the same general gloom and
despondency, and he asked an old woman why it was. She answered: "Of
course I am anxious; for if Christ does not rise to-morrow, we shall
have no corn this year."

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

The old woman's state of mind is fairly clear. Her emotion is the old
emotion, not sorrow for the Christ the Son of Mary, but fear, imminent
fear for the failure of food. The Christ again is not the historical
Christ of Judæa, still less the incarnation of the Godhead proceeding
from the Father; he is the actual figure fashioned by his village chorus
and laid by the priests, the leaders of that chorus, in the local
sepulchre.

 

So far, then, we have seen that the vague emotional dance tends to
become a periodic rite, performed at regular intervals. The periodic
rite may occur at any date of importance to the food-supply of the
community, in summer, in winter, at the coming of the annual rains, or
the regular rising of a river. Among Mediterranean peoples, both in
ancient days and at the present time, the Spring Festival arrests
attention. Having learnt the general characteristics of this Spring
Festival, we have now to turn to one particular case, the Spring
Festival of the Greeks. This is all-important to us because, as will be
seen, from the ritual of this and kindred festivals arose, we believe, a
great form of Art, the Greek drama.
