Πλήρησ μὲν ἐφαίνετ᾽ ἀ σελάννα  
αἰ δ᾽ ὠσ περὶ Βῶμον ἐσταθησαν. [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#71)

The moon rose full, and as around an altar, stood the women.

Now rose the moon, full and argentine,  
While round stood the maidens, as at a shrine.

Quoted by Hephaestion as an example of the metre known as the Ionic *a
majore* trimeter brachycatalectic. Poetically the figure is a fine one,
and shows Sappho's wonderful power of visualizing a scene in a few
unerringly chosen words. The moon and its light had a great attraction
for her, as a number of fragments shows.
