φάινεταί μοι κῆνοσ ἴσοσ τηέοισιν  
ἔμμεν ὤνερ ὄστισ ἐναντίοσ τοι  
ἰζάνει καὶ πλασίον ἀδυ  
     φωνεύσασ ὐπακούει

καὶ γαλαίσασ ἰμμερόεν τὸ δὴ ᾽μάν  
καρδίαν ἐν στήθεσιν ἐπτόασεν,  
ὠσ γὰρ εὔιδον βροχέωσ σε, φώνασ  
     οὐδὲν ἔτ᾽ ἔικει,

ἀλλὰ κάμ μὲν γλῳσσα ϝέαγε, λέπτον  
δ᾽ αὔτικα χρῷ πῦρ ὐπαδεδρόμακεν,  
ὀππάτεσσι δ᾽ οὐδὲν ορημ᾽,  
     ἐπιρρόμβεισι δ᾽ ἄκουαι.

ἀ δέ μ᾽ ί᾽δρωσ κακχέεται, τρόμοσ δὲ  
παῖσαν ἄγρει χλωροτέρα δὲ ποίασ  
ἔμμι, τεθνάκην δ᾽ ὀλιγω ᾽πιδεύϝην  
     φαίνομαι \[ἄλλα\].

πᾶν τόλματον \[......\] [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#1)

That one seems to me the equal of the gods, who sits in thy presence and
hears near him thy sweet voice and lovely laughter; that indeed makes my
heart beat fast in my bosom. For when I see thee even a little I am
bereft of utterance, my tongue is useless and at once a subtle fire
races under my skin, my eyes see nothing, my ears ring, sweat pours
forth and all my body is seized with trembling. I am paler than
\[dried\] grass and seem in my madness little better than dead, but I
must dare all ...

 

I

Peer of the gods, the happiest man I seem  
Sitting before thee, rapt at thy sight, hearing  
Thy soft laughter and they voice most gentle,  
     Speaking so sweetly.

II

Then in my bosom my heart wildly flutters,  
And, when on thee I gaze never so little,  
Bereft am I of all power of utterance,  
     My tongue is useless.

III

There rushes at once through my flesh tingling fire,  
My eyes are deprived of all power of vision,  
My ears hear nothing by sounds of winds roaring,  
     And all is blackness.

III

Down courses in streams the sweat of emotion,  
A dread trembling o'erwhelms me, paler than I  
Than dried grass in autumn, and in my madness  
     Dead I seem almost.
