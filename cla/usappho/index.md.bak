This is a version of the ISTA [Sappho poetry
collection](../sappho/index.md) with the Greek text displayed in
[Unicode](../../unicode.md). Note that final sigmas are written as medials
(all sigmas were lunate sigmas in the source text, but I decided to
'modernize' the orthography slightly). This version also corrects some
transcription errors in the original etext, which has not been altered
at this point. The introduction has also been updated slightly.

Note: This etext, particularly the introduction and the Unicode markup,

reprinting or copying of this text except for academic fair use must be
