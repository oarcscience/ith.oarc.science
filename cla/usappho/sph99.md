Ὀ μὲν γὰρ κάλοσ, ὄσσον ἴδην, πέλεται \[ἄγαθοσ\]  
ὀ δὲ κἄγαθοσ αὔτικα καὶ κάλοσ
ἔσσεται. [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#124.md)

He who is fair to look upon is good, and he who is good, will soon be
fair also.

He should be good who is fair of face,  
And he will be fair whose soul has grace.

Galen, writing about A.D. 160, says: "It is better therefore, knowing as
we do that youthful beauty is like the flowers of spring, its allurement
lasting but a short time, to agree with the Lesbian poetess, and to
believe Solon when he points out the same."
