A few single words or short phrases attributed to Sappho have been
preserved here or there by various writers. Some examples may be given
as they have a certain interest.

Eustathius speaks of a "vagabond friendship, as Sappho would say," καλὸν
δημόσιον [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#156.md) --"a public good."

The "Lexicon Sequerianum" defines
Ἄκακοσ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#157.md) as meaning "without
experience of ill," and says "so Sappho uses the word."

The "Etymologicum Magnum" defines
Ἀμαμαξύσ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#158.md) as a vine trained on
poles, and says that Sappho makes the plural
ἀμαμάξυδεσ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#159.md) . The same work mentions
Sappho's use of the form αὔωσ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#160.md) for
ἤωσ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#161.md) , "the dawn."

Pollus says that Sappho used the word
Βεῦδοσ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#162.md) for a woman's dress.

Phrynichus, the grammarian, says that Sappho calls a woman's
dressing-case where she keeps her scents,
γρύτη [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#163.md) .

A Parisian manuscript (ed. Cramer) says: "Among the Aeolian
ζ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#164.md) is used for
δ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#165.md) , as when Sappho says
ζαβατον [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#166.md) for
διάβατον [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#167.md) , 'fordable'."

Cheoeroboscus says: "Sappho makes the accusative of
κίνδυνοσ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#168.md) , danger,
κίνδυν [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#169.md) ." Another writer says
κίνδυνα [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#170.md) .

Photius, in his Lexicon (ninth century) says:
"θάψοσ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#171.md) is a wood used to dye hair
and wool yellow, which Sappho called ξύλον
Σκυθικόν [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#172.md) , Scythian wood."

The Fayum fragments in the Egyptian Museum in Berlin, brought there in
1879, contain among other things a very small scrap with a very
imperfect text on both sides of it. The fragment is considered to be of
the eight century A.D., and Professor Blass of Kiel ascribes the text to
Sappho, judging by the metre and the dialect. There is a posthumous
essay by Bergk on this subject in the fourth edition, 1882, of his
"Poetae Lyrici Graeci," but the text of the fragments is so exceedingly
imperfect that attempts at restoration are the merest conjectures.

Finally, the following verse may be quoted:

Κεῖνον ἆ χρυσόθρονε Μοῦσ᾽, ἔνισπεσ  
ὔμνον ἐκ τᾶσ καλλιγύναικοσ ἐσθλᾶσ  
Τηιοσ χώρασ ὄν ἀείδε τερπνῶσ πρέσβυσ
ἀγαυὸσ. [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#173.md)

O Muse, golden throned, sing that strain which the revered elder of
Teos, from the rich land of fair women, sang so melodiuosly.

This verse was almost certainly not written by Sappho. Athenaeus says
that "Hemesianax was mistaken when he represented Sappho and Anacreon as
contemporaries, for Anacreon lived in the time of Cyrus and Polycrates
\[about 563-478 B.C.\], while Sappho lived in the reign of Alyattes,
father of Croesus." It is extremely improbable that Sappho was still
living when Anacreon was born.
