Κατθάνοισα δὲ κείσεαι πότα, κωὐ μναμοσύνα σέθεν  
ἔσσετ᾽ οὔτε τότ᾽ οὔτ᾽ ύ᾽στερον. οὐ γὰρ πεδέχεισ βρόδοων  
τῶν ἐκ Πιερίασ ἀλλ᾽ ἀφάνησ κἠν᾽ ᾽Αῖδα δόμοισ  
φοιτάσεισ πεδ᾽ ἀμαύρων νέκυων
ἐκπεποταμένα. [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#87.md)

But thou shalt ever lie dead nor shall there be any remembrance of thee
then or ever, for thou hast none of the roses of Pieria; but thou shalt
wander unnoticed, even in the houses of Hades, flitting among the
shadowy dead.

Forever shalt thou lie dead, nor shall there be any remembrance of thee
now or hereafter, for never has thou had any of the roses of Pieria; but
thou shalt wander, eternally unregarded in the houses of Hades, flitting
among the insubstantial shades.

Quoted by Stobaeus about A.D. 500 as addressed to a woman of no
education. Plutarch also quotes this fragment, twice in fact, once as if
written to a rich woman, and again when he says that the crown of roses
was assigned to the Muses, for he remembers that Sappho had said these
same words to some uneducated woman.
