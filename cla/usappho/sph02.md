### Hymn to Aphrodite

Ποικιλόθρον᾽ ὰθάνατ᾽ ᾽Αφροδιτα,  
παῖ Δίοσ, δολόπλοκε, λίσσομαί σε  
μή μ᾽ ἄσαισι μήτ᾽ ὀνίαισι δάμνα,  
πότνια, θῦμον.

ἀλλά τυίδ᾽ ἔλθ᾽, αἴποτα κἀτέρωτα  
τᾶσ ἔμασ αύδωσ αἴοισα πήλγι  
ἔκλυεσ πάτροσ δὲ δόμον λίποισα  
χρύσιον ἦλθεσ

ἄρμ᾽ ὐποζεύξαια, κάλοι δέ σ᾽ ἆγον  
ὤκεεσ στροῦθοι περὶ γᾶσ μελαίνασ  
πύκνα δινεῦντεσ πτέῤ ἀπ᾽ ὠράνω  
αἴθεροσ διὰ μέσσω.

αῖψα δ᾽ ἐχίκοντο, σὺ δ᾽, ὦ μάσαιρα  
μειδιάσαισ᾽ ἀθάνατῳ προσώπῳ,  
ἤρἐ ὄττι δηὖτε πέπονθα κὤττι  
δἦγτε κάλημι

κὤττι μοι μάλιστα θέλω γένεσθαι  
μαινόλᾳ θύμῳ, τίνα δηὖτε πείθω  
μαῖσ ἄγην ἐσ σὰν φιλότατα τίσ τ, ὦ  
Πσάπφ᾽, ἀδίκηει;

καὶ γάρ αἰ φεύγει, ταχέωσ διώξει,  
αἰ δὲ δῶρα μὴ δέκετ ἀλλά δώσει,  
αἰ δὲ μὴ φίλει ταχέωσ φιλήσει,  
κωὐκ ἐθέλοισα.

ἔλθε μοι καὶ νῦν, χαλεπᾶν δὲ λῦσον  
ἐκ μερίμναν ὄσσα δέ μοι τέλεσσαι  
θῦμοσ ἰμμέρρει τέλεσον, σὐ δ᾽ αὔτα  
σύμμαχοσ ἔσσο. [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#0.md)

Immortal Aphrodite of the shimmering thone, daughter of Zeus, weaver of
wiles, I pray thee crush not my spirit with anguish and distress, O
Queen. But come hither if ever before thou didst hear my voice afar, and
hearken, and leaving the golden house of thy father, camest with chariot
yoked, and swift birds drew thee, their swift pinions fluttering over
the dark earth, from heaven through mid-space. Quickly they arrived; and
thou blessed one with immortal countenance smiling didst ask: What now
is befallen me and why now I call and what I in my heart's madness, most
desire. What fair one now wouldst thou draw to love thee? Who wrongs
thee Sappho? For even if she flies she shall soon follow and if she
rejects gifts, shall soon offer them and if she loves not shall soon
love, however reluctant. Come I pray thee now and release me from cruel
cares, and let my heart accomplish all that it desires, and be thou my
ally.

I

Shimmering-throned immortal Aphrodite,  
Daughter of Zeus, Enchantress, I implore thee,  
Spare me, O queen, this agony and anguish,  
     Crush not my spirit

II

Whenever before thou has hearkened to me--  
To my voice calling to thee in the distance,  
And heeding, thou hast come, leaving thy father's  
     Golden dominions,

III

With chariot yoked to thy fleet-winged coursers,  
Fluttering swift pinions over earth's darkness,  
And bringing thee through the infinite, gliding  
     Downwards from heaven,

IV

Then, soon they arrived and thou, blessed goddess,  
With divine contenance smiling, didst ask me  
What new woe had befallen me now and why,  
     Thus I had called the.

V

What in my mad heart was my greatest desire,  
Who was it now that must feel my allurements,  
Who was the fair one that must be persuaded,  
     Who wronged thee Sappho?

VI

For if now she flees, quickly she shall follow  
And if she spurns gifts, soon shall she offer them  
Yea, if she knows not love, soon shall she feel it  
     Even reluctant.

VII

Come then, I pray, grant me surcease from sorrow,  
Drive away care, I beseech thee, O goddess  
Fulfil for me what I yearn to accomplish,  
     Be thou my ally.
