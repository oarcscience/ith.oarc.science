*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

### PURIFICATION

### 4. Be a good son, just brother, spouse tender, and good father.

The aim of the doctrine of Pythagoras was to enlighten men, to purify
them of their vices, to deliver them from their errors, and to restore
them to virtue and to truth; and after having caused them to pass
through all the degrees of the understanding and intelligence, to render
them like unto the immortal gods.

This philosopher had for this purpose divided his doctrine into two
parts: the purgative part and the unitive

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

part. Through the first, man became purified of his uncleanness, emerged
from the darkness of ignorance, and attained to virtue: through the
second, he used his acquired virtue to become united to the Divinity
through whose means he arrived at perfection. These two parts are found
quite distinct in the Golden Verses. Hierocles, who has clearly grasped
them, speaks of it in the beginning of his *Commentaries* and designates
them by two words which contain, he said, all the doctrine of
Pythagoras, *Purification* and *Perfection*. <span
id="fr_275"></span>[a](#fn_274.md) The Magians and the Chaldeans, all of
whose principles Pythagoras had adopted, were agreed on this point, and
in order to express their idea, made use of a parabolical phrase very
celebrated among them. "We consume," they said, "the refuse of matter by
the fire of divine love." <span id="fr_276"></span>[b](#fn_275.md) An
anonymous author who has written an history of Pythagoras, preserved by
Photius, said that the disciples of this great man taught that one
perfects oneself in three ways: in communing with the gods, in doing
good in imitation of the gods, and in departing from this life to rejoin
the gods. <span id="fr_277"></span>[c](#fn_276.md) The first of these ways
is contained in the first three lines of the Golden Verses which concern
the cult rendered, according to the law and according to the faith, to
the Gods, to the glorified Heroes, and to the Spirits. The second, that
is, the Purification, begins at the fourth line which makes the subject
of this Examination. The third, that is, the union with the Divinity, or
Perfection, begins at the fortieth line of my translation:

Let not sleep e’er close thy tired eyes.

Thus the division that I have believed ought to be made of this short
poem is not at all arbitrary, as one sees the judicious Bay le had
remarked it before me. <span id="fr_278"></span>[d](#fn_277.md)

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

It is worthy of observation, that Pythagoras begins the purgative part
of his doctrine by commending the observance of natural duties, and that
he places in the rank of primary virtues, filial piety, paternal and
conjugal love. Thus this admirable philosopher made it his first care to
strengthen the ties of blood and make them cherished and sacred; he
exhorts respect to children, tenderness to parents, and union to all the
members of the family; he follows thus the profound sentiment which
Nature inspires in all sentient beings, very different in this from
certain legislators, blinded by false politics, who. in order to conduct
men to I know not what power and what imaginary welfare, have wished, on
the contrary, to break those ties, annihilate those relationships of
father, son, and brother, to concentrate, they said, upon a being of
reason called Country the affection that the soul divides among those
objects of its first love. <span id="fr_279"></span>[a](#fn_278.md) If the
legislators had cared to reflect a moment, they would have seen that
there existed no country for the one who had no father, and that the
respect and love that a man in his virile age feels for the place of his
birth, holds its principle and receives its force from those same
sentiments that he felt in his infancy for his mother. Every effect
proclaims a cause; every edifice rests upon a foundation: the real cause
of love of country is maternal love; the sole foundations of the social
edifice are paternal power and filial respect. From this sole power
issues that of the prince, who, in every well-organized state, being
considered as father of the people, has right to the obedience and
respect of his children.

I am going to make here a singular comparison which I

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

beg the reader to observe. Moses, instructed in the same school as
Pythagoras, after having announced the Unity of God in the famous
Decalogue which contains the summary of his law, and having commanded
its adoration to his people, announces for the first virtue, filial
piety <span id="fr_280"></span>[a](#fn_279.md): "Honour," he said, "thy
father and thy mother, that thy days may be multiplied in this country
of Adam, that Jhôah, thy Gods, has given thee." <span
id="fr_281"></span>[b](#fn_280.md)

The theocratic legislator of the Hebrews in making this commandment
places recompense by the side of precept: he declares formally that the
exercise of filial piety draws with it a long existence. Now, it must be
remarked that Moses being content with enclosing in his doctrine the
sole purgative part, doubtless judging his people not in a condition to
support the unitive part, spoke to them nowhere of the immortality which
is its consequence; contenting himself with promising the joys of
temporal blessings, among which he carefully placed in the first rank a
long life. Experience has proved, relative to people in general,

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

that Moses spoke with a profound understanding of the causes which
prolong the duration of empires. Filial piety is the national virtue of
the Chinese, the sacred foundation upon which reposes the social edifice
of the greatest and the most ancient people of the world. <span
id="fr_282"></span>[a](#fn_281.md) This virtue has been to China, for more
than four thousand years, what love of country was to Sparta or to Rome.
Sparta and Rome have fallen notwithstanding the sort of fanaticism with
which their children were animated, and the Chinese Empire which existed
two thousand years before their foundation, still exists two thousand
years after their downfall. If China has been able to preserve herself
in the midst of the flux and reflux of a thousand revolutions, to save
herself from her own wrecks, to triumph over her own defects, and to
subjugate even her conquerors, she owes it to this virtue which, raising
itself from the humblest citizen to the Son of heaven seated upon the
imperial throne, animates all the hearts with a sacred fire, of which
Nature herself provides the nourishment and eternalizes the duration.
The Emperor is the father of the state; two hundred million men, who
regard themselves as his children, compose his immense family; what
human effort could overthrow this colossus? <span

<span id="fn_273"></span>[138:c](ogv14.htm#fr_274.md) Gods, Heroes, and
Demons signify in the Greek words θεός, Ἥρωες, Δαίμων, whence they are
derived, the Principle-Beings attained to perfection; the ruling
Principle-Beings; Terrestrial Existences. The word θεός is formed from
the word ‏אוש‎ (*aôs*), a Principle-Being, preceded by the *hemantique*
letter ‏ת‎ (*θ*, *th*), which is the sign of perfection. The word Ἥρωες
is composed of the same word ‏אוש‎ (*aôc*), preceded by the word ‏הרר‎
(*herr*), expressing all that rules. The word Δαίμων comes from the
ancient word Δῆμ, land, united with the word ὤν, existence.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[140:a](ogv15.htm#fr_279.md) Not long since, a man
rather well organized mentally, but very slightly enlightened by the
true science, brought out a book entitled *Ruverabhoni*, in which,
heaping up all the ancient and modern sophisms pronounced against the
social organization founded upon the establishment of the family, he
aspired to change the instinct of nature, in this respect, and to found
*true happiness* upon the *débris* of all the ties of blood, of all the
affections of the soul, and of all the duties of consanguinity.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[141:a](ogv15.htm#fr_280.md) As I give the same
meaning as did Moses and not that of the *Septuagint* copied by the
*Vulgate*, I transcribe here the original text, so that those who
understand Hebrew may see that I have not deviated from it.

‏ככד את-אביך ואת-אמך למען יאד בון ימיך על חאדמה אשר-יהזה אלהיך נתן לך‎

*Exodus*, ch. 20, v. 12.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[141:b](ogv15.htm#fr_281.md) *This country of
Adam*, in Hebrew ‏האדמה‎ (*ha-adamah*), *adaméenne*. This word, which
has been vulgarly translated by *the Earth*, signifies it only by
metaphor. Its proper sense, which is very difficult to grasp, depends
always on that which is attached to the name of Adam, whence it is
derived. *Jhôah*, in Hebrew ‏יהוה‎, pronounced very improperly
*Jehovah*, on account of a defective punctuation of the Masoretes, is
the proper name of GOD. This name was formed by Moses in a manner as
ingenious as sublime, by means of the contraction of the three tenses of
the verb ‏הוה‎ (*hôeh*), to be. It signifies exactly *will
be-being-been;* that which is, was, and shall be. One renders it well
enough by Eternal. It is Eternity, or the Time-without-Limit of
Zoroaster. This name is quite generally followed, as it is here, with
the words ‏אלהיך‎ (*Ælohî-cha*), thy Gods, in order to express that the
Unity contained in Jhôah, comprehends the infinity of the gods, and
takes the place of it with the people of Israel.
