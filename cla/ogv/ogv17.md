*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. If thou canst at least: for a most rigid law Binds Power to Necessity.

Here is the proof of what I said just now, that Pythagoras recognized
two motives of human actions, the first, issuing from a constrained
nature, called Necessity; the second emanating from a free nature,
called Power, and both dependent upon an implied primordial law. This
doctrine

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

was that of the ancient Egyptians, among whom Pythagoras had imbibed it.
"Man is mortal with reference to the body," they said, "but he is
immortal with reference to the soul which constitutes essential man. As
immortal he has authority over all things; but relative to the material
and mortal part of himself, he is subject to destiny." <span
id="fr_296"></span>[a](#fn_295.md)

One can see by these few words that the ancient sages did not give to
Destiny the universal influence that certain philosophers and
particularly the Stoics gave to it later on; but they considered it only
as exercising its empire over matter. It is necessary to believe that
since the followers of the Porch had defined it as a chain of causes, by
virtue of which the past has taken place, the present exists, and the
future is to be realized <span id="fr_297"></span>[b](#fn_296.md); or still
better, as the rule of the law by which the Universe is governed <span
id="fr_298"></span>[c](#fn_297.md); one must believe, I say, that these
philosophers confounded Destiny with Providence, and did not distinguish
the effect from its cause, since these definitions conform only with the
fundamental law of which destiny is but an emanation. This confusion of
words had to produce and in fact did produce, among the Stoics, an
inversion of ideas which was the most unfortunate result <span
id="fr_299"></span>[d](#fn_298.md); for, as they established, according to
their system, a chain of good and evil that nothing could either alter
or break, one easily inferred that the Universe being subject to the
attraction of a blind fatality, all actions are here necessarily
determined in advance, forced, and thereafter indifferent in themselves;
so that good and evil, virtue and vice, are vain words, things whose
existence is purely ideal and relative.

The Stoics would have evaded these calamitous results if, like
Pythagoras, they had admitted the two motives of which I have spoken,
Necessity and Power; and if, far from instituting Necessity alone as
absolute master of the

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Universe, under
the name of Destiny or Fatality, they had seen it balanced by the Power
of the Will, and subject to the Providential Cause whence all emanates.
The disciples of Plato would also have evaded many errors, if they had
clearly understood this concatenation of the two opposed principles,
from which results universal equilibrium; but following certain false
interpretations of the doctrine of their master regarding the soul of
matter, they had imagined that this soul was no other than Necessity by
which it is ruled <span id="fr_300"></span>[a](#fn_299.md); so that,
according to them, this soul being inherent in matter, and bad in
itself, gave to Evil a necessary existence: a dogma quite formidable,
since it makes the world to be considered as the theatre of a struggle
without beginning or end, between Providence, principle of Good, and the
soul of matter, principle of Evil. The greatest mistake of the
Platonists, exactly contrary to that of the Stoics, was in having
confused the free power of the Will with the divine Providence, in
having instituted it for the principle of good and thus being put in
position of maintaining that there are two souls in the world, a
beneficent one, God, and a malefic one, Matter. This system, approved of
by many celebrated men of antiquity and which Beausobre assures was the
most widely received, <span id="fr_301"></span>[b](#fn_300.md) offers, as I
have observed, the very great disadvantage of giving to Evil a necessary
existence, that is to say, an independent and eternal existence. Now,
Bayle has very well proved, by attacking this system through that of
Manes, that two opposed Principles cannot exist equally eternal and
independent of one another, because the clearest ideas of order teach us
that a Being which exists by itself, which is necessary, which is
eternal, must be unique, infinite, all-powerful, and endowed with all
manner of perfections. <span id="fr_302"></span>[c](#fn_301.md)

But it is not at all certain that Plato may have had the

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

idea that his disciples have attributed to him, since far from
considering matter as an independent and necessary being, animated by a
soul essentially bad, he seems even to doubt its existence, going so far
as to regard it as pure nothingness, and calls the bodies which are
formed of it, equivocal beings holding the medium between what is always
existing and what does not exist at all <span
id="fr_303"></span>[a](#fn_302.md); he affirms sometimes that matter has
been created and sometimes that it has not been <span
id="fr_304"></span>[b](#fn_303.md); and thus falls into contradictions of
which his enemies have taken advantage. Plutarch, who has clearly seen
it, excuses them by saying that this great philosopher has fallen into
these contradictions designedly, in order to conceal some mystery; a
mind constructed like his not being made to affirm two opposites in the
same sense. <span id="fr_305"></span>[c](#fn_304.md) The mystery that Plato
wished to conceal, as he makes it sufficiently understood, <span
id="fr_306"></span>[d](#fn_305.md) was the origin of Evil. He himself
declares that he has never revealed and that he never will reveal, in
writing, his real sentiments in this respect. Thus what Chalcidius and
after him André Dacier have given concerning the doctrine of Plato are
only conjectures or very remote inferences drawn from certain of his
dogmas. One has often made use of this means, with regard to celebrated
men whose writings one comments upon and particularly when one has
certain reasons for presenting one’s ideas *sous un côté* which outlines
or which favours an opinion either favourable or unfavourable. It is
this which happened more to Manes than to any other; his doctrine
concerning the two Principles has been greatly calumniated, and without
knowing just what he meant by them, one hastened to condemn him without
investigating what he had said; adopting as axioms that he had laid
down, inferences the most bizarre and most

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

ridiculous that his enemies had drawn from certain equivocal
phrases. <span id="fr_307"></span>[a](#fn_306.md) What persuades me to make
this observation, is because it has been proved that Manes had indeed
admitted two opposed Principles of Good and Evil, eternal independents,
and holding of themselves their proper and absolute existence, since it
is easy to see that Zoroaster, whose doctrine he had principally
imitated, had not admitted them as such, but as equally issued from a
superior Cause, concerning the essence of which he was silent. <span
id="fr_308"></span>[b](#fn_307.md) I am very much inclined to believe that
the Christian doctors who have transmitted to us the ideas of this
mighty heresiarch, blinded by their hatred or by their ignorance, have
travestied them as I find that the Platonist philosophers, bewildered by
their own opinions, have entirely disfigured those of the illustrious
founder of the Academy. The errors of both have been, taking for
absolute beings, what Zoroaster and Pythagoras, Plato or Manes, had put
down as emanations, results, forces, or even the simple abstractions of
the understanding. Thus Ormuzd and Ahriman, Power and Necessity, the
Same and the Other, Light and Darkness, are, in reality, only the same
things diversely expressed, diversely sensed, but always drawn from the
same origin and subject to the same fundamental Cause of the Universe.

It is not true therefore, as Chalcidius has stated, that Pythagoras may
have demonstrated that evil exists necessarily, <span
id="fr_309"></span>[c](#fn_308.md) because matter is evil in itself.
Pythagoras

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

never said that matter might be an absolute being whose essence might be
composed of evil. Hierocles, who had studied the doctrine of this great
man and that of Plato, has denied that either the one or the other had
ever declared matter as a being existing by itself. He has proved, on
the contrary, that Plato taught, following the steps of Pythagoras, that
the World was produced from Nothing, and that his followers were
mistaken when they thought that he admitted an uncreated matter. <span
id="fr_310"></span>[a](#fn_309.md) Power and Necessity (mentioned in the
lines at the head of this Examination) are not, as has been believed,
the absolute source of good and evil. Necessity is not more evil in
itself than Power is not good; it is from the usage that man is called
to make of them, and from their employment which is indicated by wisdom
or ignorance, virtue or vice, that results Good or Evil. This has been
felt by Homer who has expressed it in an admirable allegory, by
representing the god of gods himself, Jupiter, opening indifferently the
sources of good and evil upon the universe.

Beside Jove’s threshold stand two casks of gifts for man.  
One cask contains the evil, one the good, . . . <span
id="fr_311"></span>[b](#fn_310.md)

Those who have rejected this thought of Homer have not reflected enough
upon the prerogatives of poetry, which are to particularize what is
universal and to represent as done what is to be done. Good and Evil do
not emanate from Jupiter in action, but in potentiality, that is to say,
that the same thing represented by Jupiter or the Universal Principle of
the Will and the Intelligence, becomes good or evil, according as it is
determined by the particular operation of each individual principle of
the Will and the

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Intelligence. <span id="fr_312"></span>[a](#fn_311.md) Now, man is to the
Being called Jupiter by Homer, as the particular is to the
Universal. <span id="fr_313"></span>[b](#fn_312.md)

of this Cause, he gave it the name of *Time without Limit*, following
the translation of Anquetil Duperron. This Cause does not still appear
absolute in the doctrine of this theosophist; because in a passage of
the *Zend-Avesta*, where in contemplation of the Supreme Being, producer
of Ormuzd, he calls this Being, *the Being absorbed in excellence*, and
says that Fire, acting from the beginning, is the principle of union
between this Being and Ormuzd (36<sup>e</sup> *hâ du Vendidad Sadé*, p.
180, 19<sup>e</sup> *fargard*, p. 415), One finds in another book,
called *Sharistha*, that when this Supreme Being organized the matter of
the Universe, he projected his Will in the form of a resplendent light
(*Apud* Hyde, c. 22, p. 298).
