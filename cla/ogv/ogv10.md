### § VII

I am beginning with the creator of epopœia, with Homer. It is easy to
see by the manner in which this divine man blends, from the opening
lines of the *Iliad*, the exposition and invocation, that, full of a
celestial inspiration that he was the first to receive, he seeks to pour
forth the superabundant fire which consumes him, and to throw into the
soul of his hearer the impassioned enthusiasm which masters and controls
his own. The following lines will suffice to make known the subject of a
work which fills twenty-four cantos.

Déesse! viens chanter la colère d’Achille,  
Fatale, et pour les Grecs si fertile en malheurs,  
Qui, d’avance, aux enfers, précipitant en foule  
Les âmes des héros, livra leurs corps sanglants  
Aux dogues affamés: ainsi Jupiter même  
Le voulut, quand la haine eut divisé les cœurs  
Du roi des rois Atride et du divin Achille.  
  Lequel des Immortels provoqua ce courroux?  
Apollon irrité, qui, pour punir Atride,  
Ravagea son armée: et les peuples mourraient!

O Goddess! sing the wrath of Peleus’ son,  
Achilles; sing the deadly wrath that brought  
Woes numberless upon the Greeks, and swept  
To Hades many a valiant soul, and gave  
Their limbs a prey to dogs and birds of air,—  
For so had Jove appointed,—from the time  
When the two chiefs, Atrides, King of men,  
And great Achilles, parted first as foes.  
  Which of the gods put strife between the chiefs,  
That they should thus contend? Latona’s son  
And Jove’s. Incensed against the king, he bade  
A deadly pestilence appear among  
The army, and the men were perishing.  
                                           BRYANT.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

Μῆνιν ἄειδε, θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος,  
οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί᾽ Ἀχαιοϊς ἄλγε᾽ ἔθηχεν,  
πολλὰς δ᾽ ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προϊαψεν  
ἡρώων, αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε χύνεσσιν  
οἰωνοῖσί τε πᾶσι (Διὸς δ᾽ἐτελείετο βουλή),  
ἐξ οὖ δὴ τὰ πρῶτα διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε  
Ἀτείδης τε, ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, καὶ δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς.  
  Τίς τ᾽ ἄρ σφωε θεῶν ἔριδι ξυνέηχε μάχεσθαι;  
Λητοῦς καὶ Διὸς υἱός. Ὁ γὰρ βασιλῆϊ χολωθεὶς  
νοῦσον ἀνὰ στρατὸν ὦρσε κακὴν, ὀλέκοντο δὲ λαοὶ.

I dispense with making any reflection upon the charm of the original
verses and upon the admirable sentiment which terminates them. It would
be a very strange thing not to be impressed by the beauties of this
poetry. Let us pass on to Vergil.

Even though I should not say it, it would suffice now to compare the
Greek poet with the Latin poet, in order to perceive that the latter
received only a second inspiration, transmitted by the inspiring power
of the former. Vergil, less ardent, more tender, more correct, admits at
once the luminous distinction; far from blending the exposition and
invocation, he separates them, affects a tone more simple, promises
little, exposes with timidity the subject of his poem, summons his Muse,
and seems to persuade it, even less than the reader, to be favourable to
him. He employs these lines:

Je chante les combats, et ce Héros troyen,  
Qui, fuyant Ilion, aborda l’Italie  
Le premier: sur la terre errant, et sur les mers,  
En butte aux traits cruels de Junon irritée,  
Il souffrit mille maux; avant qu’il établît  
Ses Dieux chez les Latins, et fondât une ville,  
Berceau d’Albe, de Rome et de ses hauts remparts.  
  Muse! rappelle-moi quels motifs de vengeance  
Excitaient la Déesse, et pourquoi son courroux  
S’obstinait à poursuive un Héros magnanime?  
Tant de haine entre-t-elle au cœur des Immortels!

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

Arms and the man I sing, who first,  
By fate of Ilium realm amerced,  
To fair Italia onward bore,  
And landed on Lavinium’s shore:—  
Long tossing earth and ocean o’er,  
By violence of heaven, to sate  
Fell Juno’s unforgetting hate:  
Much laboured too in battle-field,  
Striving his city’s walls to build,  
  And give his Gods a home:  
Thence come the hardy Latin brood,  
The ancient sires of Alba’s blood,  
  And lofty-rampired Rome.  
Say, Muse, for godhead how disdained,  
Or wherefore worth, Heaven’s queen constrained  
That soul of piety so long  
'To turn the wheel, to cope with wrong.  
Can heavenly natures nourish hate  
So fierce, so blindly passionate?  
                                       CONINGTON.

Arma virumque cano, Trojæ qui primus ab oris  
Italiam, fato profugus, Lavinaque venit  
Litora, multum ille et terris jactatus et alto  
Vi superûm, sævæ memorem Junonis ob iram,  
Multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem  
Inferretque deos Latio: genus unde Latinum,  
Albanique patres atque altæ mœnia Romæ.  
  Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine læso,  
Quidve dolens, regina deûm tot volvere casus  
Insignem pietate virum, tot adire labores  
Impulerit. Tantæne animis cœlestibus iræ?

It can be observed that Vergil, although he places himself foremost and
although he says, *I sing*, begins nevertheless in a manner much less
animated, much less sure than the Greek poet, who, transported beyond
himself, seems to impose upon his Muse the subject of his songs,
interrogates her, and then inspired by her, responds. The Latin poet
finishes, like his model, with a sentence; but it is easy to feel that
this apostrophe,

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

Can heavenly natures nourish hate  
So fierce, so blindly passionate?

although very beautiful, contains less depth, less feeling, and holds
less intimately to the subject than this sublime reflection:

. . . and the men were perishing!

Someone has said that Vergil had imitated in his exposition the
commencement of the *Odyssey* of Homer; this is a mistake. One finds
always in the exposition of the *Odyssey* the real character of a first
inspiration blended with the invocation, although more calm and less
alluring than in the *Iliad*. Here is the translation:

  Du plus sage Héros, Muse, dis les traverses  
Sans nombre, après qu’il eut triomphé d’Ilion:  
Rapelle les cités, les peuples, les usages,  
Qu’il connut, et les mers où longtemps il erra:  
A quels soins dévorants, à quels maux l’exposèrent  
L’amour de la patrie et noble désir  
D’y mener ses guerriers! Vain désir: ils osèrent,  
Insensés! du Soleil dévorer les troupeaux;  
Et ce Dieu, du retour leur ravit la journée.  
Fais-nous part de ces faits, fille de Jupiter.

Tell me, O Muse, of that sagacious man  
Who, having overthrown the sacred town  
Of Ilium, wandered far and visited  
The capitals of many nations, learned  
The customs of their dwellers and endured  
Great suffering on the deep; his life was oft  
In peril, as he laboured to bring back  
His comrades to their homes. He saved them not,  
Though earnestly he strove; they perished all,  
Through their own folly; for they banqueted,  
Madmen! upon the oxen of the Sun,  
The all-o’erlooking Sun, who cut them off  
From their return. O Goddess, virgin-child  
Of Jove, relate some part of this to me.  
                                                 BRYANT.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

Ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ  
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν,  
πολλῶν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω·  
πολλὰ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,  
ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.  
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὧς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο ἱέμενός περ·  
αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρησιν ἀτασθαγίησιν ὄλοντο,  
νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο  
ἤσθιον· αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἧμαρ.  
τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεὰ θύγατερ Διός, εἰμὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.

The talent of Homer shows itself completely in the *Odyssey;* it
dominates the genius there, so to speak, as much as the genius had
dominated it in the *Iliad*. The fire which animates the *Iliad* has
been, with reason, compared to that of the sun arrived at the height of
its course, and the splendour which shines in the *Odyssey* to that with
which the occident is coloured on the evening of a fine day. Perhaps if
we had his *Thebaid*, we would see those brilliant lights which
accompany the aurora, developed there, and then we would possess in all
its shades this immortal genius who depicted all nature.

There are people who, feeling by a sort of intuition that Homer had been
created the poetic incentive of Europe, even as I have said, and judging
on the other hand that Ariosto had made an epic poem, are convinced that
the Italian poet had copied the Greek; but this is not so. Ariosto;, who
has made only a romanesque poem, has not received the inspiration of
Homer; he has simply followed the fictions attributed to Archbishop
Turpin and clothing them with forms borrowed from the Arabs by the
troubadours makes himself creator in this secondary style. The rhyme is
as essential to it as it is harmful to veritable epopœia; this is why
the eumolpique verses never conform to it in the slightest degree. To
apply them to it, is to make serious what is by nature gay, it is to
give a character of force and of truth to what is only light, airy, and
fantastic. I am

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

about, however, to translate the beginning of his poem, in order to
furnish, by the shocking disparity which exists between the romantic
essence of his poetry and the epic form that I here adapt, a new proof
of what I have said.

  Je veux chanter les Dames, les Guerriers,  
L’amour, l’honneur, et les jeux et les armes,  
Durant ces temps où les fiers Sarrasins,  
Des mers d’Afrique, abordèrent en France,  
Pour seconder les fureurs d’Agramant,  
Le jeune roi, dont l’orgueilleuse audace  
Pensait venger la mort du vieux Trojan,  
Sur l’empereur des Romains, Charlemagne.

  Je veux aussi raconter de Roland,  
Chose inouïe, autant en vers qu’en prose;  
Dire l’amour qui rendit furieux  
Ce paladin, auparavant si sage;  
Si toutefois celle qui m’a charmé,  
Qui va minant ma raison d’heure en heure,  
M’en laisse assez pour remplir dignement  
Mon entreprise et tenir ma promesse.

  Of Loves and Ladies, Knights and Arms, I sing,  
Of Courtesies, and many a Daring Feat;  
And from those ancient days my story bring,  
When Moors from Afric passed in hostile fleet,  
And ravaged France, with Agramant their King,  
Flushed with his youthful rage and furious heat;  
Who on King Charles’, the Roman emperor’s head  
Had vowed due vengeance for Troyano dead.

  In the same strain of Roland will I tell  
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme,  
On whom strange madness and rank fury fell,  
A man esteemed so wise in former time;  
If she, who to like cruel pass has well  
Nigh brought my feeble wit which fain would climb  
And hourly wastes my sense, concede me skill  
And strength my daring promise to fulfil.  
                                           W. R. ROSE.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

  Le donne, i cavalier, l’arme, gl’amori  
Le cortesíe, l’audaci imprese io canto,  
Che furo al tempo the passaro i Mori  
D’Africa il mare, e in Francia nocquer tanto,  
Seguendo l’ire e i giovenil furori  
D’Agramante lor re, che si diè vanto  
Di vendicar la morte di Troiano  
Sopra re Carlo imperator romano.

  Dirò d’Orlando in un medesmo tratto  
Cosa non detta in prosa mai, nè in rima;  
Che per amor venne in furore e matto,  
D’uom che sì saggio era stimato prima:  
Se da colei che tal quasi m’ha fatto  
Che’l poco ingegno ad or ad or mi lima,  
Me ne sarà perd tanto concesso,  
Che mi basti a finir quanto ho promesso.

It is very easy to see, in reading these two strophes, that there exists
in the exposition no sort of resemblance either with that of Homer, or
with that of Vergil. It is a third style, wholly foreign to the other
two. Homer mingling the exposition and the invocation, commands his Muse
to sing what she inspires in him; Vergil distinguishing one from the
other, prays his Muse to acquaint him with what he is about to sing;
whereas Ariosto, announcing simply the subject of his songs, makes no
invocation. It is evident that he relies upon himself, and that in the
style that he adopts he understands very well that he has no other Muse,
no other guide than his imagination. His subject is in accord with his
manner of treating it. If one wishes to reflect upon this decisive
point, one will feel and realize, for the first time perhaps, why in the
opinion of all the world concerning two works from the same hand, *La
Pucelle* and *La Henriade*, the one is a poem, whereas the other,
composed with a far greater pretension, is not. Voltaire, in imitating
Ariosto in a subject that he has rendered romanesque and frivolous, has
received the second inspiration; but in imitating Lucan in an historic
subject he received nothing,

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

for Lucan, creator of a mixed style, had no inspiration that he could
communicate.

I have said what I thought of Camoens: it is useless to quote the
exposition of his poem that has nothing remarkable, particularly since
Tasso has so far surpassed him.

Tasso was worthy of receiving a veritable inspiration. His lofty genius,
his pure and brilliant imagination brought him nearer to Vergil than to
Ariosto; and if he had been inspired even through the Latin poet, he
would have shown Europe what the magnetic power of Homer was, although
acting only in its third degree. But the prejudices of education working
in him even without his knowledge, and the influence that chivalresque
poetry had attained in Italy, did not permit him either to forsake
entirely the chronicles of Archbishop Turpin, or above all, to make any
changes in the consecrated form. All that he could do in a most grave
and serious historical subject was to mix a little allegorical genius
with a great deal of romanesque fiction; so that, becoming inspired at
the same time with Ariosto, Lucan, and Vergil, he made a mixed work,
which, under the form of a lengthy song, contained the essence of
epopœia, of history, and of romance. This work is one of the most
entertaining poems that one can read; the only one perhaps which a
translation in prose can harm but little. The inequality of its texture
takes away nothing from the interest that it inspires. It pleases, but
it does not instruct. If the eumolpique lines were applied to it
throughout, it would not sustain them; for it is in substance only a
very beautiful ballad; nevertheless, here and there are found parts
which could become sublime. His exposition, imitating Vergil, reveals
them very well. They are as follows:

  Je chante les combats pieux, et le Guerrier  
Qui délivra du Christ la tombe renommée.  
Combien il déploya de génie et d’ardeur!  
Combien il supporta de maux dans cette guerre!

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

Vainement les enfers s’armérent; vainement  
Les peuples de l’Asie aux Africains s’unirent:  
Favorisé du Ciel, sous ses drapeaux sacrés,  
Vainqueur, il ramena ses compagnons fidèles.

  Divine Muse! ô toi dont le front radieux  
Ne ceint point sur le Pinde un laurier périssable,  
Mais qui, parmi les chœurs des habitants du Ciel,  
Chantes, le front orné d’étoiles immortelles,  
Viens, inspire à mon sein tes célestes ardeurs;  
Fais briller dans mes vers tes clartés, et pardonne  
Si, parant quelquefois l’austère vérité,  
Je mêle à tes attraits des grâces étrangères.

  I sing the pious arms and Chief, who freed  
The Sepulchre of Christ from thrall profane:  
Much did he toil in thought, and much in deed;  
Much in the glorious enterprise sustain;  
And Hell in vain opposed him; and in vain  
Afric and Asia to the rescue pour’d  
Their mingled tribes;—Heaven recompensed his pain,  
And from all fruitless sallies of the sword,  
True to the Red-Cross flag his wandering friends restored.

  O thou, the Muse, that not with fading palms  
Circlest thy brows on Pindus, but among  
The Angels warbling their celestial psalms,  
Hast for the coronal a golden throng  
Of everlasting stars! make thou my song  
Lucid and pure; breathe thou the flame divine  
Into my bosom; and forgive the wrong,  
If with grave truth light fiction I combine,  
And sometimes grace my page with other flowers than thine!  
                                                          WIFFEN.

  Canto l’armi pietose, e’l Capitano  
Che’l gran sepolcro liberò di Christo:  
Molto egli oprò col senno e con la mano;  
Molto soffrì nel glorïoso acquisto:  
E invano l’Inferno a lui s’oppose, e invano  
S’arma d’Asia, e dì Libia il popol misto;  
Chè il Ciel diè favore, e sotto ai santi  
Segni ridusse i suoi compagni erranti.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

  O Musa, tu, che di caduchi allori  
Non circondi la fronte in Elicona  
Ma su nel Ciel infra i beati cori,  
Hai di stelle immortali aurea corona,  
Tu spira al petto mio celesti ardori,  
Tu rischiara il mio canto, e tu perdona,  
S’intesso fregi al ver, s’adorno in parte  
D’altri diletti, che de’ tuoi, le carte.

The captivating enthusiasm of Homer, the majestic simplicity of Vergil
are not there; there is a sweetness of expression, a purity of imagery
which please. This might be greater, but then the melancholy of the
romance would exclude it and the reader would demand the full force of
epopœia.

Besides, the Italians have tried, over and over again, to vary the form
of their verses; some have wished to measure them by musical rhythm;
others have contented themselves with making blank verse. They have
neither succeeded completely nor failed completely. Their language sweet
and musical lacks force whether in good or in evil. Its words might
indeed, strictly speaking, be composed of long and short syllables; but
as they terminate, nearly all, in the soft and languid style that we
call feminine, it results, therefore, that in the measured verses the
poets lack the long syllables to constitute the last foot and to form
the spondee; and that in the blank verse they are obliged to terminate
them all in the same style; so that with the measure they create only
lame verses, and without the rhyme they make them all equally
languid. <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_223.md)

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

I recall having sometimes read French writers who, not having
investigated the character of their tongue, have reproached it for its
feminine syllables and have believed that their concurrence was harmful
to its force and its harmony. These writers have scarcely considered
what this language would be, deprived of its feminine sounds. For with
the little force that it would gain on one side, it would acquire such a
harshness on the other, that it would be impossible to draw from it four
consecutive lines that would be endurable. If all its finals were
masculine, and if nothing could change it otherwise, it would be
necessary to renounce poetry, or like the Arabs, be resolved to compose
whole poems in the same rhyme.

We have just seen that the lack of masculine finals takes away all
energy from the Italian tongue; a contrary defect would deprive the
French of this *mélange* of sweetness and force which makes it the
*première langue* of Europe. The English language is lacking in
precisely what the writers of whom I have spoken desired eliminated from
the French, without foreseeing the grave disadvantages of their desire:
it has no feminine finals <span id="fr_224"></span>[1](#fn_224.md);

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

also it is in everything the opposite of the Italian. It is true that it
possesses great energy, great boldness of expression, and a grammatical
liberty which goes to the full extent; but deprived of sweetness and
softness, it is, if I may say it, like those brittle metals whose
strength is in stiffness, and which is broken when one would make them
flexible. The poverty of its rhymes, denuded for the most part of
accuracy of accent and of harmony in consonants, has for a long time
engaged the English poets in making blank verse; and it must be admitted
that, notwithstanding the defect inherent in their tongue and which
consists, as I have just said, in the absolute lack of feminine finals,
they have succeeded in this better than any of the poets of other
nations. These lines, all imperfect in their harmony, are however, as to
form, the only eumolpique verse that they could make. Shakespeare felt
it and made use of it in his tragedies.

Shakespeare with the creative genius with which nature had endowed him,
would have borne dramatic art to its perfection in these modern times,
if circumstances had been as favourable to him as they were adverse.
Emulator of Æschylus, he might have equalled and perhaps surpassed him,
if he had had at his disposal a mine so rich, so brilliant

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

as that of the mysteries of Orpheus; if he had made use of a language so
harmonious, if his taste had been able to be refined at the school of
Pindar or of Homer. At the epoch of his birth, Europe scarcely emerged
from the gloom of barbarism; the theatre, given over to ridiculous
mountebanks, profaned in indecent farces the incomprehensible mysteries
of the Christian religion, and the English tongue, still crude and
unformed, had not succeeded in amalgamating in one single body the
opposed dialects of which it was successively formed. In spite of these
obstacles, Shakespeare stamped upon England a movement of which Europe
felt the influence. Raised by the sole force of his genius to the
essence of dramatic poetry, he dared to seek for his subjects in the
mythology of Odin, and put upon the stage, in *Hamlet* and in *Macbeth*,
tableaux of the highest character. <span id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_225.md)

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Like Æschylus he
conducted one to virtue by terror; but unfortunately the taste of the
spectators, upon which he was forced to model his, led him to degrade
his tableaux by grotesque figures: the English people were not
sufficiently advanced to comprehend the moral end of the tragedy. They
must be amused; and Shakespeare succeeded only at the expense of the
beauties of the art. Historic facts and trivial scenes replaced the
mysterious and sublime subjects.

In London, the dramatic muse was turbulent and licentious;

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

as in Madrid it had been chivalrous and gallant. Everywhere the theatre
had to accommodate itself to the taste of the people. The first regular
tragedy which Pierre Corneille composed in France was derived from a
Spanish ballad. Madrid at that time gave the tone to Europe. It needed
much of the time and all the prosperity of Louis XIV. to throw off the
unseasonable ascendancy that this

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

proud nation had assumed over public opinion. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_226.md) Notwithstanding the efforts of
Corneille, of Racine, and of Molière, the Théâtre Français retained
always the romanesque tone that it had originally received. All that
these three men could do was, by lofty sentiments, by purity of forms,
by regularity of the customs and characters, to pass over what was, in
reality, defective. They came thus to give to modern dramatic art all
the perfection of which it was susceptible. Shakespeare had been in
London the successor of Æschylus; Corneille received in France the
inspiration of Sophocles; Racine, that of Euripides; and Molière united
as in a sheaf the spirit of Menander. of Terence, and of Plautus.

When I compare Shakespeare with Æschylus, I want to make it clearly
understood that I regard him as the regenerator of the theatre in
Europe, and superior to Corneille and Racine as to dramatic essence,
although he may be assuredly much inferior to them as to form. Æschylus,

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

in Greek, was inspired by Homer; while, on the contrary, it was
Shakespeare who inspired Milton. It is known that *Paradise Lost* was at
first conceived as the subject of a tragedy, and that it was only after
reflection that the English poet saw therein the material for an epic
poem. I will tell later on, in speaking of the *Messiah* of Klopstock,
what has prevented these two subjects, which appear equally epics, from
attaining wholly to the majesty of epopœia. As many of the motives that
I have to offer apply to the two works, I will thus avoid useless
repetition. I shall begin by translating the exposition and invocation
of Milton, by imitating its movement and its harmony, as I have done
with the other poets.

  De l’homme, viens chanter la disgrâce, et la fruit  
De cet arbre fatal, dont le goût homicide  
Livra le Monde au crime, à la mort, aux malheurs,  
Et nous ravit Eden, jusqu’au moment qu’un Homme  
Plus grand, par son trépas, racheta le séjour <span id="page_105">p.
105</span>  
Du bonheur: viens, ô Muse! ô toi qui, sur la cime  
Se Sinaï, d’Oreb, en secret inspiras  
La Berger d’Israël, quand d’une voix sacrée  
Il enseignait comment et la terre et des cieux  
Sortirent du Chaos! ou bien, si tu préfères  
Les sommets de Sion, les bords du Siloë,  
Qui, près du Temple saint, roule ses flots, ô Muse!  
Viens protéger de là mes chants audacieux,  
Mes chants qui, surpassant d’un essor non timide,  
Les monts Aoniens, vont raconter des faits  
Que n’ont point encor dits la prose ni la rime.

  Of Man’s first disobedience, and the fruit  
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste  
Brought death into the world, and all our woe,  
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man  
Restore us and regain the blissful seat,  
Sing, heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top  
Of Oreb or of Sinai, didst inspire  
That shepherd, who first taught the chosen seed,  
In the beginning how the heavens and earth  
Rose out of chaos; or if Sion hill  
Delight thee more, and Siloa’s brook that flow’d  
Fast by the oracle of God; I thence  
Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,  
That with no middle flight intends to soar  
Above the Aonian mount, while it pursues  
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.

This invocation is manifestly in imitation of Homer, from whom Milton
has received the second inspiration without the intermediary—Vergil. One
can observe in the English poet the same movement and almost as much
force as in the Greek poet, but much less clarity, precision, and
particularly harmony. Nearly all of these defects pertain to his subject
and his tongue. Circumstances were not favourable to Milton. His lines
could not have been better with the elements that he was forced to
employ. All imperfect as they are, they are worth much more than those
of Klopstock; for at least they are in the character of his tongue,
whereas those of the German poet are not.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Milton is
satisfied with throwing off the yoke of rhyme, and has made eumolpique
lines of one foot only, measured by ten syllables. Their defect,
inherent in the English idiom, consists, as I have said, in having all
the lines bearing equally the masculine final, jarring continually one
with the other. Klopstock has aspired to make, in German, verses
measured by the musical rhythm of the Greeks; but he has not perceived
that he took as long and short, in his tongue, syllables which were not
such in musical rhythm, but by accent and prosody, which is quite
different. The German tongue, composed of contracted words and
consequently bristling with consonants, bears no resemblance to the
Greek, whose words, abounding in vowels, were, on the contrary, made
clear by their elongation. The rhythmic lines of Klopstock are
materially a third longer than those of Homer, although the German poet
has aspired to build them on an equal measure. <span
id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_227.md) Their rhythmic harmony, if it exists
there, is absolutely factitious; it is a pedantic imitation and nothing
more. In order to make the movement of these lines understood in French,
and to copy as closely as possible their harmony, it is necessary to
compose lines of two cæsuras, or what amounts to the same, to employ
constantly a line and a half to represent a single one. Here are the
first fourteen lines which contain the exposition and invocation of the
Messiah:

Des coupables humains, célèbre, Ame immortelle,  
           l’heureuse délivrance,  
Que sur terre envoyé le Messie accomplit  
           dans son humanité:  
Dis comment il rendit les fils du premier homme  
           à leur Auteur céleste; <span id="page_107">p. 107</span>  
Souffrant et mis à mort, enfin glorifié.  
          Ainsi s’exécuta  
Le décret éternel. En vain Satan rebelle  
          opposa son audace  
A ce Fils du Très-Haut; et Judas vainement  
          s’éleva contre lui:  
Réconciliateur et Rédempteur suprême,  
          il consomma son œuvre.  
Mais quoi, noble action! que Dieu seul en son cœur  
          miséricordieux,  
Connaît, la Poésie, en son exil terrestre,  
          pourra-t-elle te suivre?  
Non, Esprit créateur, c’est à toi, devant qui  
          je m’incline en tremblant,  
A rapprocher de moi cette action divine,  
          à toi-même semblable.  
Viens donc, conduis-la-moi dans l’état immortel  
          de toute sa beauté;  
Remplis-la de ton feu, toi que, sondant l’abîme  
          du Très-Haut, peux de l’homme  
Issu de la poussière, et fragile et mortel,  
          te faire un temple saint.

My Soul, degenerate man’s redemption sing,  
Which the Messiah in his human state  
On earth accomplished, by which, suffering slain  
And glorify’d, unto the Love of God  
The progeny of Adam he restored.  
Such was the everlasting Will divine,  
Th' infernal Fiend opposed him, Judah stood  
In opposition proud; but vain their rage:  
He did the deed, he wrought out man’s salvation.  
  Yet, wondrous Deed, which th’ all-compassionate  
Jehovah alone completely comprehends,  
May Poesy presume from her remote  
Obscurity to venture on thy theme?  
Creative Spirit, in whose presence here  
I humbly' adore, her efforts consecrate,  
Conduct her steps and lead her, me to meet,  
Of transport full, with glorious charms endow’d  
And power immortal, imitating Thee.  
                                               (EGESTORFF.)

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

Sing, unserterbliche Seele, der sündigen Menschen  
                                  Erlösung,  
Die der Messias auf Erden, in seiner Menscheit  
                                  vollendet;  
Und durch die er Adams Geschlecht zu der Liebe  
                                  der Gottheit,  
Leidend, getödtet und verherlichet, weider erhöhet  
                                  hat.  
Also geschah des Ewigen Wille. Vergebens erhub  
                                  sich  
Satan gegen der göttlichen Sohn; umsonst stand  
                                  Juda  
Gegen ihn auf; er that’s, und wollbrachte die grosse  
                                  Versöhnung.  
Aber, o That, die allein der Albarmherzige  
                                  kennet,  
Darf aus dunckler Ferne sich auch dir nahen  
                                  die Dichtkunst?  
Weihe sie, Geist, Schöpfer, vor dem ich hier still  
                                  anbete,  
Führe sie mir, als deine Nachahmerin, voller  
                                  Entzückung,  
Voll unsterblicher Kraft, in verklärter Schönheit,  
                                  entgegen.  
Rüste mit deinem Feuer sie, du, der die Tiefen des  
                                  Gottheit  
Schaut und den Menschen, aus Staube gemacht, zum  
                                  Tempel sich heiligt!

It is evident that in this exposition the movement of Homer has been
united by Klopstock to the ideas of Tasso. The German poet claims
nevertheless the originality, and believes that he himself was called to
enjoy the first inspiration. In order that this high aspiration might
have been realized, a mass of learning very difficult to find would have
been necessary. I will explain briefly this idea. I believe that the one
who, disdaining to follow in the footsteps of Homer or of Vergil, would
wish to open another road to epopœia, should be well acquainted with the
ground over which he ventures to trace it, and the goal toward which he
aspires to conduct it; I think he should make himself master of his
subject so that nothing might remain obscure

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

or unknown to him; so that if he should choose either the downfall of
Man, as Milton, or his rehabilitation, after the example of Klopstock,
he would be able to acquaint himself with the inner meaning of these
mysteries, to explain all the conditions, to comprehend the beginning
and the end, and, raising himself to the intellectual nature where they
had birth, to spread light upon physical nature. This is the first
attainment that I deem indispensable to the epic poet; I say that he
should understand what he would sing. Homer knew what Ilium was, what
Ithaca was; he could explain to himself the nature of Achilles and
Helen, of Penelope and Ulysses; consequently he could depict them. I do
not wish to investigate here whether Milton has understood in the same
manner the beginning of the World and the nature of Satan; nor whether
Klopstock has well understood the mystery of the incarnation of the
Messiah. I only say that if they have not understood these things, they
cannot sing them in a manner really epic.

A defect which is common to these two poets, and which is even
noticeable in the *Jerusalem Delivered* of Tasso, is, that everything
which does not pertain to the part of the celebrated hero, is by its
impure, unfaithful, impious nature, governed by the Principle of evil,
and as such consigned to eternal damnation. An insurmountable barrier
separates the personages and makes them not alone enemies, but opposed,
as much as good and evil, light and darkness. However, the passions act
unknown even to the poet; the reader is hurried along, he forgets the
fatal line of demarcation, and is deceived into becoming interested in
Satan, into finding great, beautiful, and terrible, this enemy of
mankind; he trusts in Armida, he is moved by her troubles, and seconds
with his vows those of a notorious magician, instrument of the Infernal
Spirit. Matters go not thus with Homer. The Greeks see in the Trojans,
enemies, and not reprobates. Paris is culpable but not impious. Hector
is a hero in whom one can be interested without

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

shame, and the interest that one devotes to him reflects upon Achilles
and can even be increased. The gods are divided; but Venus and Juno,
Minerva and Mars, Vulcan and Neptune are of a like nature; and although
divided in the epic action, they are none the less venerated by both
parties, equal among each other and all equally subject to Jupiter, who
excites or checks their resentment. I know not whether any one has
already made this observation; but be that as it may, it is very
important. One can attain to the sublimity of epopœia only if like Homer
one knows how to oppose the Powers which serve the hero with the Powers
which persecute him. For if everything which serves the hero is good,
holy, and sacred, and everything which is harmful to him wicked,
impious, and reprobate, I do not see the glory of his triumph.

The principal defect in Milton’s poem is that his hero succumbs,
although he has to combat only the evil things within himself, whilst
everything which is good protects him: the poem of Klopstock does not
hold the reader’s interest, because the perils of his hero are illusory
and as soon as he is represented as God, and when he himself knows his
divinity, his downfall is absolutely impossible.

But it is too much to dwell upon points of criticism which do not belong
to my subject. I have touched upon them only slightly so that you may
feel, *Messieurs*, notwithstanding the pretensions of three rival
peoples, that the epic career remains none the less wholly open to the
French nation. Some out-of-the-way paths have been traced here and
there; but no poet since Vergil, has left the imprint of his steps upon
the true path. The moment is perhaps at hand for gathering the palms
that time has ripened. Must this century, great in prodigies, remain
without an impassioned and enchanting voice to sing of them? Assuredly
not. Whoever may be the poet whose genius raises itself to this noble
task, I have wished from afar to lend him my feeble support; for I have
often enough repeated, that

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

talent alone will aspire to this in vain. Epopœia will only be the
portion of the one who thoroughly understands the essence of poetry and
who is able to apply to it a proper form. I have penetrated this essence
as far as has been possible for me, and I have revealed my ideas,
*Messieurs*, as clearly as the insufficiency of my means has permitted.
I trust that their development may have appeared satisfactory and useful
to you; I trust equally that the new form which I offer you merits your
attention. I have applied it before you, to ideas, to intentions and to
very different harmonies: it adapts itself here, for of itself it is
nothing. Subject wholly to poetic essence, it receives therefrom all its
lustre. If the ideas that it would render have grandeur and sublimity,
it will easily become grand and sublime; but nothing would be poorer and
more void, than that it should serve trivial thoughts or that it should
conceal an absolute want of ideas. Do not imagine, *Messieurs*, that the
absence of rhyme makes easy the French verse; it is precisely this
absence which makes the great difficulty: for there is not then the
means of writing without thinking. One can, with the aid of talent and
practice, compose pleasing rhymed verse, without a great expenditure of
ideas; the enormous quantity that is made today proves that it is not
very difficult. The elegance of form supplies the sterility of
substance. But this form becomes at last worn out; the rhymes are not
inexhaustible; one word attracts another, forces it to unite with it,
making understood the sounds that one has heard a thousand times,
repeating the pictures which are everywhere; one repeats unceasingly the
same things: the enjambment which gives so much grace to the Greek and
Latin verse and without which real epic impulse cannot exist, is opposed
to the rhyme and destroys it. You can see, *Messieurs*, that it
constitutes one of the principal qualities of eumolpique verse; nothing
here constrains the enthusiasm of the poet.

After some impassioned verses that I have believed

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

necessary for you to hear, I shall now pass on to verses, philosophical
and devoid of passion, which form the subject of this writing and to
which I desire above all to call your attention.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_223"></span>[97:1](ogv10.htm#fr_223.md) Nearly all of the
Italian words terminate with one of four vowels, *a*, *e*, *i*, *o*,
without accent: it is very rare that the vowels are accentuated, as the
vowel *ù*. When this occurs as in *cità*, *perchè*, *dì*, *farò*, etc.,
then, only, is the final masculine. Now here is what one of their best
rhythmic poets, named Tolomèo, gives as an hexameter verse:

*Questa, per affeto, tenerissima lettera mando  
A te*...

To make this line exact, one feels that the word *mando*, which
terminates it, should be composed of two longs, that is to say, that it
should be written <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> *mandò*, which could
not be without altering the sense entirely. Marchetti has translated
into blank verse the Latin poem of Lucretius. I will quote the opening
lines. Here is evident the softness to which I take exception and which
prevents them from being really eumolpique, according to the sense that
I have attached to this word.

*Alma figlia di Giove, indite madre  
Del gran germe d’Enea, Venere bella,  
Degli uomini piacere e degli Dei:  
Tu, the sotto il volubili e lucenti  
Segni del cielo, il mar profundo, e tutta  
D’animai d’ogni specie orni la terra:*  
. . . etc.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[98:1](ogv10.htm#fr_224.md) One must not believe
that the mute *e* with which many English words terminate represents the
French feminine final, expressed by the same vowel. This mute *e* is in
reality mute in English; ordinarily it is only used to give a more open
sound to the vowel which precedes it, as in *tale*, *scene*, *bone*,
*pure*, <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> *fire*. Besides it is never
taken into account, either in the measure or in the prosody of the
lines. Thus these two lines of Dryden rhyme exactly:

"Now scarce the Trojan fleet with sails and oars  
 Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores. . . . "  
                                            *Æneid*, b. i., v. 50.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is the same in
these of Addison:

"Tune ev’ry string and ev’ry tongue,  
 Be thou the Muse and subject of our song...."  
                                      *St. Cecilia’s Day*, i., 10.

or these from Goldsmith:

"How often have I loiter’d o’er thy green,  
 Where humble happiness endeared each scene."  
                                    *The Deserted Village*, i., 7.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[100:1](ogv10.htm#fr_225.md) There remains to us
of this poetry the very precious fragments contained in the *Edda* and
in *Voluspa*. The *Edda*, whose name signifies great-grandmother, is a
collection, fairly ample, of Scandinavian traditions. *Voluspa* is a
sort of Sibylline book, or cosmogonic oracle, as its name indicates. I
am convinced that if the poets of the north, the Danes, Swedes, and
Germans, had oftener drawn their subjects from these indigenous sources,
they would have succeeded better than by going to Greece to seek them
upon the summits of Parnassus. The mythology of Odin, descended from the
Rhipæan mountains, suits them better than that of the Greeks, whose
tongue furthermore is not conformable here. When one makes the moon and
the wife (*der Mond*, *das Weib*) of masculine and neuter gender; when
one makes the sun, the air, time, love (*die Sonne*, *die Luft*, *die
Zeit*, *die Liebe*) of feminine gender, one ought wisely to renounce the
allegories of Parnassus. It was on account of the sex given to the sun
and the moon that the schism arose, of which I have spoken, in
explaining the origin of the temple of Delphi.

The Scandinavian allegories, however, that I consider a *débris* of
Thracian allegories, furnishing subjects of a very different character
from those of the Greeks and Latins, might have varied the poetry of
Europe and prevented the Arabesque fiction from holding there so much
ascendancy. The Scandinavian verses, being without rhyme, hold moreover,
to eumolpœia. The following is a strophe from *Voluspa:*

"Avant que le temps fût, Ymir avait été;  
 Ni la mer, ni nes vents n’existaient pas encore;  
 Il n’était de terre, il n’était point de ciel:  
 Tout n’était qu’un abîme immense, sans verdure." <span id="page_101">p.
101</span>

"In the beginning, when naught was, there  
 Was neither sand nor sea nor the cold waves,  
 Nor was earth to be seen nor heaven above.  
 There was a Yawning Chasm \[chaos\] but grass nowhere. . .

*Ár vas alda pat-es ekki vas;  
vasa sandr né sær né svalar unnir,  
iærô̽ fansk æva né upp-himinn;  
Gap vas Ginnunga, enn gras ekki*, . . .

Voyez Mallet, *Monuments celtiques*, p. 135; et pour le texte, le poëme
même de la Voluspa, *in Edda islandorum*, Mallet paraît avoir suivi un
texte erroné.

As to the Gallic poetry of the Scotch bards, that Macpherson has made
known to us under the name of *Ossian*, much is needed that they may
have a sufficient degree of authenticity for them to be cited as models,
and placed parallel with those of Homer, as has been done without
reflection. These poems, although resting for the greater part upon a
true basis, are very far from being veritable as to form. The Scotch
bards, like the Oscan troubadours, must be restored and often entirely
remade, if they are to be read. Macpherson, in composing his *Ossian*,
has followed certain ancient traditions, has put together certain
scattered fragments; but has taken great liberties with all the rest. He
was, besides, a man endowed with creative genius and he might have been
able to attain to epopœia if he had been better informed. His lack of
knowledge has left a void in his work which demonstrates its falsity.
There is no mythology, no allegory, no cult in *Ossian*. There are some
historic or romanesque facts joined to long descriptions; it is a style
more emphatic than figurative, more bizarre than original. Macpherson,
in neglecting all kinds of mythological and religious ideas, in even
mocking here and there the *stone of power* of the Scandinavians, has
shown that he was ignorant of two important things: the one, that the
allegorical or religious genius constitutes the essence of poetry; the
other, that Scotland was at a very ancient period the hearth of this
same genius whose interpreters were the druids, bards, and scalds. He
should have known that, far from being <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>
without religion, the Caledonians possessed in the heart of their
mountains, the Gallic Parnassus, the sacred mountain of the Occidental
isles; and that when the antique cult began to decline in Gaul, it was
in Albion, reckoned among the holy isles by even the Indians, that the
druids went to study. Voyez *Les Commentaires de César*, iv., 20;
*L’Introduction de l’histoire de Danemark*, par Mallet; *L’Histoire des
Celtes*, par Pelloutier; et enfin les *Recherches asiatiques* (*Asiat.
Research.*), t. vi., p. 490 et 502.

In order to seize the occasion of applying eumolpique lines to a greater
number of subjects, I am going to quote a sort of exposition of Ossian,
the only one I believe, which is found in his poems; because Macpherson,
for more originality, neglected nearly always to announce the subject of
his songs. I will not give the text, because the English translation
whence I obtained it does not give it. It concerns the battle of Lora.
After a kind of exordium addressed to the son of the stranger, dweller
of the silent cavern, Ossian said to him:

  Le chant plait-il à ton oreille?  
Ecoute le récit du combat de Lora.  
Il est bien ancien, ce combat! Le tumulte  
Des armes, et les cris furieux des guerriers,  
  Sont couverts par un long silence;  
  Ils sont éteints depuis longtemps:  
Ainsi sur des rochers retentissants, la foudre  
  Roule, gronde, éclate et n’est plus;  
Le soleil reparaît, et la cime brillante  
Des coteaux verdoyants, sourit à ses rayons.

Son of the secret cell! dost thou delight in songs?  
Hear the battle of Lora.  
The sound of its steel is long since past.  
So thunder on the darkened hill roars, and is no more.  
The sun returns with his silent beams,  
The glittering rocks, and green heads of the mountains smile.

This example serves to prove that eumolpique lines might easily adapt
themselves to the dithyramb.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[103:1](ogv10.htm#fr_226.md) The tragedy of the
*Cid*, given by Pierre Corneille in 1626, upon which were based the
grandeur and dominant character of the Théâtre Français, as well as the
renown of the author, is taken from a Spanish ballad very celebrated in
Spain. The Cid, who is the hero of it, lived towards the close of the
eleventh century. He was a type of the paladins and knights errant of
the romanesque traditions. He enjoyed a wide reputation and attained a
high degree of fortune. *Voyez* Monte-Mayor, *Diana*, l. ii.; et
Voltaire, *Essai sur les Mœurs*, t. iii., stéréotype, p. 86.

In the course of the sixteenth century, the Spanish held a marked
superiority over the other peoples: their tongue was spoken at Paris,
Vienna, Milan, Turin. Their customs, their manners of thought and of
writing, subjugated the minds of the Italians, and from Charles V. to
the commencement of the reign of Philip III., Spain enjoyed an
importance that the other peoples never had. *Voyez* Robertson,
*Introduction d l’Histoire de Charles-Quint*.

It would be necessary to overstep considerably the ordinary limits of a
footnote, if I should explain how it happens that Spain has lost this
supremacy acquired by her, and why her tongue, the only one capable of
rivalling and perhaps effacing the French, has yielded to it in all
ways, and by which it was eclipsed. This explanation would demand for
itself alone a very lengthy work. Among the writers who have sought for
the cause of the decadence of the Spanish monarchy, some have believed
to discover it in the increase of its wealth, others, in the too great
extent of its colonies, and the greater part, <span id="page_104">p.
104</span> in the spirit of its government and its superstitious cult.
They have all thought that the tribunal of the Inquisition alone was
capable of arresting the impulse of genius and of stifling the
development of learning. In this they have taken effects for causes, and
consequences for principles. They have not seen that the spirit of the
government and the cult is always not the motive, but the result of the
national spirit, and that the wealth and the colonies, indifferent in
themselves, are only instruments that this spirit employs for good or
evil, according to its character. I can only indicate the first cause
which has prevented Spain from reaching the culminating point which
France is very near to attaining. This cause is pride. Whilst Europe,
enveloped in darkness, was, so to speak, in the fermentation of
ignorance, Spain, conquered by the Arabs, received a germ of science
which, developing with rapidity, produced a precocious fruit, brilliant,
but like hot-house fruit lacking internal force and generative vigour.
This premature production having raised Spain abruptly above the other
European nations, inspired in her that pride, that excessive amour
propre, which, making her treat with contempt all that did not belong to
her, hindered her from making any change in her usual customs, carried
her with complacency in her mistakes, and when other peoples came to
bring forth fruits in their season, corrupted hers and stamped her with
a stationary movement, which becoming necessarily retrogressive, must
ruin her, and did ruin her.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[106:1](ogv10.htm#fr_227.md) In comparing the
first lines of Homer with those of Klopstock, it is seen that the Greek
contains 29 letters, 18 of which are vowels; and the German 48 letters,
31 of which are consonants. It is difficult with such disparity in the
elements to make the harmony the same.
