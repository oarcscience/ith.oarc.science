*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 20. Too much attention or too little shun; for envy Thus, to either excess is alike attached.

The philosopher, firm in his principle of *juste milieu*, wished that
his disciples should avoid excess in all things, and that they should
not draw attention to themselves by an unusual way of living. It was a
widespread opinion among the ancients, that envy, shameful for the one
who felt it and dangerous for the one who inspired it, had fatal
consequences for both. <span id="fr_467"></span>[b](#fn_466.md) For envy is
attached to all that tends to distinguish men too ostensibly. Thus,
notwithstanding all that have been published of the extraordinary rules
and severe abstinences that Pythagoras imposed upon his disciples and
that he made them observe, it appears indubitable that they were only
established after his death, and that his interpreters, being deceived
regarding the mysterious meaning of these symbols, take in the literal
sense, what he had said in the figurative. The philosopher blamed only
the excess, and permitted besides, a moderate usage of all the foods to
which men were accustomed. Even the beans, for which his disciples later
conceived so much abhorrence, were eaten frequently. <span
id="fr_468"></span>[c](#fn_467.md) He did not forbid absolutely either
wine, or meat, or even fish, whatever may have been asserted at
different times <span id="fr_469"></span>[d](#fn_468.md); though, indeed,
those of his disciples who aspired to the highest perfection abstained
from them <span id="fr_470"></span>[e](#fn_469.md); he represented
drunkenness and intemperance

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

only as odious vices that should be avoided. <span
id="fr_471"></span>[a](#fn_470.md) He had no scruples about drinking a
little wine himself, and of tasting the meats set before him at
table, <span id="fr_472"></span>[b](#fn_471.md) in order to show that he
did not regard them as impure, notwithstanding he preferred the
vegetable *régime* to all others and that, for the most part, he
restricted himself to it from choice. <span
id="fr_473"></span>[c](#fn_472.md) Further on I will return to the mystic
meaning of the symbols, by which he had the appearance of forbidding the
use of certain foods and above all beans.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[195:b](ogv31.htm#fr_467.md) Bacon assures,
following the ancients, that the envious eye is dangerous and that it
has been observed that after great triumphs, illustrious personages
having been the object of an envious eye have found themselves
ill-disposed for some days following (*Sylva Sylvarum*, § 944).
