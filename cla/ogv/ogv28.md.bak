*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 17. That which thou dost not know, pretend not that thou dost. Instruct thyself: for time and patience favour all.

Lysis has enclosed in these two lines the summary of the doctrine of
Pythagoras regarding science: according to this philosopher, all science
consists of knowing how to distinguish what one does not know and of
desiring to learn that of which one knows nothing. <span
id="fr_451"></span>[c](#fn_450.md) Socrates had adopted this idea, as
simple as profound; and Plato has consecrated several of his dialogues
to its development. <span id="fr_452"></span>[d](#fn_451.md)

But the distinction between what one does not know and the desire to
learn that of which one is ignorant, is a thing much rarer than one
imagines. It is the golden mean of science, as difficult to possess as
that of virtue, and without which it is, however, impossible to know
oneself. For, without knowledge of oneself, how can one acquire
knowledge of others? How judge them if one cannot be one’s own judge?
Pursue this reasoning. It is evident

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

that one can know only what one has learned from others, or what one has
found from oneself: in order to have learned from others, one must have
wished to receive lessons; in order to have found, one must have wished
to seek; but one cannot reasonably desire to learn or to seek only for
what one believes one does not know. If one imposes upon oneself this
important point, and if one imagines oneself knowing that of which one
is ignorant, one must judge it wholly useless to learn or to seek, and
then ignorance is incurable: it is madness to style oneself doctor
concerning things that one has neither learned nor sought after, and of
which one can consequently have no knowledge. It is Plato who has made
this irresistible reasoning, and who has drawn this conclusion: that all
the mistakes that man commits come from that sort of ignorance which
makes him believe that he knows what he does not know. <span
id="fr_453"></span>[a](#fn_452.md)

From time immemorial this sort of ignorance has been quite considerable;
but I believe that it will never again show itself to the extent it did
among us some centuries ago. Men hardly free from the mire of barbarism,
without being given the time either to acquire or to seek after any true
knowledge of antiquity, have offered themselves boldly as its judges and
have declared that the great men who have made it illustrious were
either ignorant, imposters, fanatics, or fools. Here, I see musicians
who seriously assure me that the Greeks were rustics in the way of
music; that all that can be said of the wonders effected by this art is
idle talk, and that we have not a village fiddler who could not produce
as much effect as Orpheus, Terpander, or Timotheus, if he had similar
auditors. <span id="fr_454"></span>[b](#fn_453.md) There, are the critics
who

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

tell me with the same phlegmatic air that the Greeks of the time of
Homer knew neither how to read nor how to write; that this poet himself,
assuming that he really existed, did not know the letters of the
alphabet <span id="fr_455"></span>[a](#fn_454.md); but that his existence
is a fancy, <span id="fr_456"></span>[b](#fn_455.md) and that the works
attributed to him are the crude productions of certain plagiarist
rhapsodists. <span id="fr_457"></span>[c](#fn_456.md) Further on I see, to
complete the singularity, a research worker who finds, doubtless to the
support of all this, that the first editor of the poems of Homer, the
virile legislator of Sparta, Lycurgus in short, was a man ignorant and
unlettered, knowing neither how to read nor write <span
id="fr_458"></span>[d](#fn_457.md): quite an original idea and a comparison
wholly bizarre, between the author and the editor of the *Iliad!* But
this is nothing. Here is an archbishop of Thessalonica, who, animated by
a righteous indignation, declared that Homer may have been an instrument
of the devil, <span id="fr_459"></span>[e](#fn_458.md) and that one may be
damned in reading him. That one shrugs the shoulders at the allegories
of this poet, that one finds them not in the least interesting, that one
falls asleep even, let all that pass; but to be damned! I have said that
Bacon, drawn along unfortunately by that fatal prejudice which makes one
judge without understanding, had calumniated the philosophy of the
Greeks; his numerous disciples have even surpassed him upon this point.
Condillac, the *coryphée* of modern empiricism, has seen in Plato only
delirious metaphysics unworthy of occupying his time, and in Zeno only
logic deprived of reasoning and principles. I would that Condillac, so
great an amateur of analysis, had endeavoured to analyse the metaphysics
of the one and the logic of the other,

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

to prove to me that he understood at least what he found so unworthy of
taking up his time; but that was the thing about which he thought the
least. Open whatever book you will; if the authors are theologians, they
will say to you that Socrates, Pythagoras, Zoroaster, Kong-Tse or
Confucius, as they call him, are pagans, <span
id="fr_460"></span>[a](#fn_459.md) whose damnation is, if not certain, at
least very probable; they will treat their theosophy with the most
profound contempt: if they are physicists, they will assure you that
Thales, Leucippus, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Empedocles,
Aristotle, and the others are miserable dreamers; they will jeer at
their systems: if they are astronomers, they will laugh at their
astronomy: if they are naturalists, chemists, botanists, they will make
jest of their methods, and will take into consideration their credulity,
their stupidity, their bad faith, the numerous wonders that they no
longer understand in Aristotle and in Pliny. None will take the trouble
to prove their assertions; hut, like people blinded by passion and
ignorance, they state as fact what is in question, or putting their own
ideas in place of those that they do not understand they will create
phantoms for the sake of fighting them. Never going back to the
principles of anything, stopping only at forms, adopting without
examination the commonest notions, they will commit on all sides the
same mistake that

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

they have committed with respect to the genethliatical science, the
principles of which I have shown in my last Examination; and confounding
this science of the ancients with the astrology of the moderns, they
will consider in the same light Tiresias and Nostradamus, and will see
no difference between the oracle of Ammon, or of Delphi, and the lucky
chance of the most paltry fortune-teller.

However, I do not pretend to say that all the modern savants indulge, in
this same manner, in presumption and false notions with regard to
antiquity; there have been many honourable exceptions among them: even
those have been found who, drawn beyond the golden mean, by the
necessity of effecting a useful reform or of establishing a new system,
have returned there as soon as their passion or their interest have no
longer commanded them. Such for example is Bacon, to whom philosophy has
owed enough great favours to forget certain incidental prejudices; for I
am, furthermore, far from attributing to him the errors of his
disciples. Bacon, at the risk of contradicting himself, yielding to the
sentiment of truth, although he subjected all to the light of
experience, admitted, however, positive and real universals, which, by
his method are wholly inexplicable. <span
id="fr_461"></span>[a](#fn_460.md) Forgetting what he had said of Plato in
one book, he declared in another: that this philosopher, endowed with a
sublime genius, turning his attention upon all nature and contemplating
all things from a lofty elevation, had seen very clearly, in his
doctrine of ideas, what the veritable objects of science are. <span
id="fr_462"></span>[b](#fn_461.md) Finally recognizing the principles of
physics and the *ensemble* of things as the foremost to be considered,
he made astrological science, which he likened to astronomy, depend upon
it, in such a manner as to show that he did not confound it with vulgar
astrology. This philosopher found that before his time, astronomy, well
enough founded upon phenomena, utterly lacked soundness, and that
astrology

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

had lost its true principles. To be sure he agreed with astronomy
presenting the exterior of celestial phenomena, that is to say, the
number, situation, movement, and periods of the stars; but he accused it
of lacking in understanding of the physical reasons of these phenomena.
He believed that a single theory which contents itself with appearances
is a very easy thing, and that one can imagine an infinity of
speculations of this sort; also he wished that the science of astronomy
might be further advanced.

Instead of revealing the reasons of celestial phenomena \[he said\], one
is occupied only with observations and mathematical demonstrations; for
these observations and these demonstrations can indeed furnish certain
ingenious hypotheses to settle all that in one’s mind, and to make an
idea of this assemblage, but not to know precisely how and why all this
is actually in nature: they indicate, at the most, the apparent
movements, the artificial assemblage, the arbitrary combination of all
these phenomena, but not the veritable causes and the reality of things:
and as to this subject \[he continues\], it is with very little judgment
that astronomy is ranked among the mathematical sciences; this
classification derogates from its dignity. <span
id="fr_463"></span>[a](#fn_462.md)

Regarding astrological science, Bacon wished that it might be
regenerated completely by bringing it back to its real principles, that
is to say, that one should reject all that the vulgar had added thereto,
both narrow and superstitious, preserving only the grand revolutions of
the ancients. These ideas, as is quite obvious, are not at all in accord
with those that his disciples have adopted since; also the greater part
of them refrain from citing similar passages.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[191:a](ogv28.htm#fr_460.md) The name of *Pagan*
is an injurious and ignoble term derived from the Latin *Paganus*, which
signifies a rustic, a peasant. When Christianity had entirely triumphed
over Greek and Roman polytheism, and when by the order of the Emperor
Theodosius, the last temple dedicated to the gods of the nations had
been destroyed in the cities, it was found that the people in the
country still persisted a considerable time in the ancient cult, which
caused them and all their imitators to be called derisively *Pagans*.
This appellation, which could suit the Greeks and Romans in the fifth
century who refused to submit to the dominating religion in the Empire,
is false and ridiculous when one extends it to other times, and to other
peoples. It cannot be said without at once offending chronology and
common sense, that the Romans or Greeks of the time of Cæsar, of
Alexander, or of Pericles; the Persians, Arabs, Egyptians, Indians, the
Chinese, ancient or modern, were *Pagans;* that is to say, peasants
disobedient to the laws of Theodosius. These are polytheists,
monotheists, mythologists, whatever one wishes, idolators perhaps, but
not *Pagans*.
