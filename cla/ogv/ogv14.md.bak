*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. . . . Revere the memory Of the Illustrious Heroes, of Spirits demi-Gods. . . .

Pythagoras considered the Universe as an animated All, whose members
were the divine Intelligences, each ranked according to its perfections,
in its proper sphere. <span id="fr_247"></span>[a](#fn_246.md) He it was
who first designated this All, by the Greek word *Kosmos*, in order to
express the beauty, order, and regularity which reigned there <span
id="fr_248"></span>[b](#fn_247.md); the Latins translated this word by
*Mundus*, from which has come the French word *monde*. It is from Unity
considered as principle of the world, that the name Universe which we
give to it is derived. Pythagoras

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

establishes Unity as the principle of all things and said that from this
Unity sprang an infinite Duality. <span id="fr_249"></span>[a](#fn_248.md)
The essence of this Unity, and the manner in which the Duality that
emanated from it was finally brought back again, were the most profound
mysteries of his doctrine; the subject sacred to the faith of his
disciples and the fundamental points which were forbidden them to
reveal. Their explanation was never made in writing; those who appeared
worthy of learning them were content to be taught them by word of
mouth. <span id="fr_250"></span>[b](#fn_249.md) When one was forced, by the
concatenation of ideas, to mention them in the books of the sect,
symbols and ciphers were used, and the language of Numbers employed; and
these books, all obscure as they were, were still concealed with the
greatest care; by all manner of means they were guarded against falling
into profane hands. <span id="fr_251"></span>[c](#fn_250.md) I cannot enter
into the discussion of the famous symbol of Pythagoras, *one* and *two*,
without exceeding very much the limits that I have set down in these
examinations <span id="fr_252"></span>[d](#fn_251.md); let it suffice for
me to say, that as he designated God by 1, and Matter by 2, he expressed
the Universe by the number 12, which results in the union of the other
two. This number is formed by the multiplication of 3 by 4: that is to
say, that this philosopher conceived the Universal world as composed of
three particular worlds, which, being linked one with the other by means
of the four elementary modifications, were developed in twelve
concentric spheres. <span id="fr_253"></span>[e](#fn_252.md) The ineffable
Being which filled these

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

twelve spheres without being understood by any one, was God. Pythagoras
gave to It, truth for soul and light for body. <span
id="fr_254"></span>[a](#fn_253.md) The Intelligence which peopled the three
worlds were, firstly, the immortal gods properly so-called; secondly,
the glorified heroes; thirdly, the [terrestrial](errata.htm#2.md) demons.
The immortal gods, direct emanations of the uncreated Being and
manifestation of Its infinite faculties, were thus named because they
could not depart from the divine life—that is, they could never fall
away from their Father into oblivion, wandering in the darkness of
ignorance and of impiety; whereas the souls of men, which produced,
according to their degree of purity, glorified heroes and terrestrial
demons, were able to depart sometimes from the divine life by voluntary
drawing away from God; because the death of the intellectual essence,
according to Pythagoras and imitated in this by Plato, was only
ignorance and impiety. <span id="fr_255"></span>[b](#fn_254.md) It must be
observed that in my translation I have not rendered the Greek word
*δαίμονες* by the word *demons*, but by that of *spirits*, on account of
the evil meaning that Christianity has attached to it, as I explained in
a preceding note. <span id="fr_256"></span>[c](#fn_255.md)

This application of the number 12 to the Universe is not at all an
arbitrary invention of Pythagoras; it was common to the Chaldeans, to
the Egyptians from whom he had received it, and to the principal peoples
of the earth <span id="fr_257"></span>[d](#fn_256.md): it gave rise to the
institution of the zodiac, whose division into twelve asterisms has been
found everywhere existent from time immemorial. <span
id="fr_258"></span>[e](#fn_257.md) The distinction of the three worlds and
their development into a number, more or less great, of concentric
spheres inhabited by intelligences of

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

different degrees of purity, were also known before Pythagoras, who in
this only spread the doctrine which he had received at Tyre, at Memphis,
and at Babylon. <span id="fr_259"></span>[a](#fn_258.md) This doctrine was
that of the Indians. One finds still today among the Burmans, the
division of all the created beings established in three classes, each of
which contains a certain number of species, from the material beings to
the spiritual, from the sentient to the intelligible. <span
id="fr_260"></span>[b](#fn_259.md) The Brahmans, who count fifteen spheres
in the universe, <span id="fr_261"></span>[c](#fn_260.md) appear to unite
the three primordial worlds with the twelve concentric spheres which
result from their development. Zoroaster, who admitted the dogma of the
three worlds, limited the inferior world to the vortex of the moon.
There, according to him, the empire of evil and of matter comes to an
end. <span id="fr_262"></span>[d](#fn_261.md) This idea thus conceived has
been general; it was that of all the ancient philosophers <span
id="fr_263"></span>[e](#fn_262.md); and what is very remarkable, is that it
has been adopted by the Christian theosophists who certainly were not
sufficiently learned to act through imitation. <span
id="fr_264"></span>[f](#fn_263.md) The followers of Basil, those of
Valentine, and all the gnostics have imbibed from this source the system
of emanations which has enjoyed such a great renown in the school of
Alexandria. According to this system, the Absolute Unity, or God, was
conceived as the spiritual Soul of the Universe, the Principle of
existence, the Light

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

of lights; it was believed that this creative Unity, inaccessible to the
understanding even, produced by emanation a diffusion of light which,
proceeding from the centre to the circumference, losing insensibly its
splendour and its purity in proportion as it receded from its source,
ended by being absorbed in the confines of darkness; so that its
divergent rays, becoming less and less spiritual and, moreover, repulsed
by the darkness, were condensed in commingling with it, and, taking a
material shape, formed all the kinds of beings that the world contains.
Thus was admitted, between the Supreme Being and man, an incalculable
chain of intermediary beings whose perfections decreased proportionably
with their alienation from the Creative Principle. All the philosophers
and all the sectarians who admired this spiritual hierarchy considered,
under the relations peculiar to them, the different beings of which it
was composed. The Persian magians who saw there genii, more or less
perfect, gave them names relative to their perfections, and later made
use of these same names to evoke them: from this came the Persian magic,
which the Jews, having received by tradition during their captivity in
Babylon, called *Kabbala*. <span id="fr_265"></span>[a](#fn_264.md) This
magic became mixed with astrology among the Chaldeans, who regarded the
stars as animated beings belonging to the universal chain of divine
emanations; in Egypt, it became linked with the mysteries of Nature, and
was enclosed in the sanctuaries, where it was taught by the priests
under the safeguard of symbols and hieroglyphics. Pythagoras, in
conceiving this spiritual hierarchy as a geometrical progression,
considered the beings which compose it under harmonious relations, and
based, by analogy, the laws of the universe upon those of music. He
called the movement of the celestial spheres, harmony, and made use of
numbers to express the faculties of different beings, their relations
and their influences. Hierocles mentions

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

a sacred book attributed to this philosopher, in which he called the
divinity, the Number of numbers. <span id="fr_266"></span>[a](#fn_265.md)
Plato, who, some centuries later, regarded these same beings as ideas
and types, sought to penetrate their nature and to subjugate them by
dialectics and the force of thought. Synesius, who united the doctrine
of Pythagoras to that of Plato, sometimes called God, the Number of
numbers, and sometimes the Idea of ideas. <span
id="fr_267"></span>[b](#fn_266.md) The gnostics gave to the intermediary
beings the name of Eons. <span id="fr_268"></span>[c](#fn_267.md) This
name, which signifies, in Egyptian, a principle of the will, being
developed by an inherent, plastic faculty, is applied in Greek to a term
of infinite duration. <span id="fr_269"></span>[d](#fn_268.md) One finds in
Hermes Trismegistus the origin of this change of meaning. This ancient
sage remarks that the two faculties, the two virtues of God, are the
understanding and the soul, and that the two virtues of the Eon are
perpetuity and immortality. The essence of God, he said again, is the
good and the beautiful, beatitude and wisdom; the essence of Eon, is
being always the same. <span id="fr_270"></span>[e](#fn_269.md) But, not
content with assimilating beings of the celestial hierarchy to ideas, to
numbers, or to the plastic principle of the will, there were
philosophers who preferred to designate them by the name of Words.
Plutarch said on one occasion that words, ideas, and divine emanations
reside in heaven and in the stars. <span id="fr_271"></span>[f](#fn_270.md)
Philo gives in more than one instance the name of word to angels; and
Clement of Alexandria relates that the Valentinians

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

often called their Eons thus. <span
id="fr_272"></span>[a](ogv15.htm#fn_271.md) According to Beausobre, the
philosophers and theologians, seeking for terms in which to express
[incorporeal](errata.htm#3.md) substances, designated them by some one of
their attributes or by some one of their operations, naming them
*Spirits*, on account of the subtlety of their substance;
*Intelligences*, on account of the thought; *Words*, on account of the
reason; *Angels*, on account of their services; *Eons*, on account of
their manner of subsisting, always equal, without change and without
alteration. <span id="fr_273"></span>[b](ogv15.htm#fn_272.md) Pythagoras
called them Gods, Heroes, Demons, <span
id="fr_274"></span>[c](ogv15.htm#fn_273.md) relative to their respective
elevation and the harmonious position of the three worlds which they
inhabit. This cosmogonic ternary joined with Creative Unity, constitutes
the famous Quaternary, or Sacred Tetrad, the subject of which will be
taken up further on.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[132:b](ogv14.htm#fr_248.md) The Greek word κόσμος
expresses a thing put in order, arranged according to a fixed and
regular principle. Its primitive root is in the Phœnician ‏אוש‎ (*aôsh*)
a principle Being, *the fire*. The Latin word *mundus* renders the Greek
sense very imperfectly. It signifies exactly, that which is made neat
and clean by means of water. Its nearest root is *unda*, and its
remotest root is found in the Phœnician ‏אוד‎ (*aôd*), an emanation, a
vapour, a source. One can see, according to this etymology, that the
Greeks drew the idea of order and beauty from fire, and the Latins from
water.

early age, was taken to Tyre by Mnesarchus, his father, in order to
study there the doctrine of the Phœnicians; later he visited Egypt,
Arabia, and Babylon, in which last city he remained twelve years. It was
while there that he had frequent conferences concerning the principle of
things with a very learned magian whom Porphyry names Zabratos;
Plutarch, Zaratas; and Theodoret, Zaradas. (Porphyr., *Vitâ Pythag.*)
Plutarch is inclined to believe that this magian is the same as
Zardusht, or Zoroaster, and the chronology is not here entirely
contrary. (Plutar., *De Procreat. anim.*; Hyde, *De Relig. vet. Pers.*,

principle of will, a central point of development, and ‏יון‎ (*ion*),
the generative faculty. This last word has signified, in a restricted
sense, a dove, and has been the symbol of Venus. It is the famous *Yoni*
of the Indians and even the *Yn* of the Chinese: that is to say, the
plastic nature of the Universe. From there, the name of *Ionia*, given
