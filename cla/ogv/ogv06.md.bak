### § III

Homer was not the first epic poet in the order of time, but in the order
of things. Before him many poets were skilled in Epopœia; but no one had
known the nature

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

of this kind of poetry <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md); no one had
united the opposed qualities which were necessary. There existed at this
epoch a multitude of allegorical fables which had emanated at divers
times from different sanctuaries. These fables, committed at first to
memory, had been collected in several sets of works which were called
cycles. <span id="fr_84"></span>[\*](#fn_84.md) There were allegorical,
mythological, and epic cycles. <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_85.md) We
know from certain precious texts of the ancients, that these sorts of
collections opened generally with the description of Chaos, with the
marriage of Heaven and Earth; contained the genealogy of the Gods and
the combats of the Giants; included the expedition of the Argonauts, the
famous wars of Thebes and of Troy; extended as far as the arrival of
Ulysses at Ithaca, and terminated with the death of this hero, caused by
his son Telegonus. <span id="fr_86"></span>[3](#fn_86.md) The poets who,
before Homer, had drawn from these cycles the subject of their works,
not having penetrated as far as the allegorical sense, lacking
inspiration, or being found incapable of rendering it, lacking talent,
had produced only cold inanimate copies, deprived of movement and grace.
They had not, however, omitted any of the exploits of Hercules or of
Theseus, nor any of the incidents of the sieges of Thebes or Troy; and
their muse, quite lifeless, fatigued the readers without interesting or
instructing them. <span id="fr_87"></span>[4](#fn_87.md) Homer came. He, in
his turn, glanced over this pile of sacerdotal traditions, and raising
himself by the force of his genius alone to the intellectual principle
which had conceived them, he grasped the *ensemble*, and felt all its
possibilities. The faculties of his soul and the precious gifts which he
had received from nature had made him one of those rare men who present

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

themselves, at long intervals, upon the scene of the world to enlighten
it, shining in the depths of centuries and serving as torches for
mankind. In whatever clime, in whatever career destiny had placed him,
he would have been the foremost. Ever the same, whether under the
thatched roof or upon the throne, as great in Egypt as in Greece, in the
Occident as in the Orient of Asia, everywhere he had commanded
admiration. Some centuries earlier this same attribute might have been
seen in Krishna or in Orpheus, some centuries later, in Pythagoras or in
Cyrus. Great men are always great by their own greatness. Incidents
which depend upon chance can only modify. Homer was destined to poetry
by favourable circumstances. Born upon the borders of the river Meles,
of an indigent mother, without shelter and without kindred, he owed, to
a schoolmaster of Smyrna who adopted him, his early existence and his
early instructions. He was at first called Melesigenes, from the place
of his birth. <span id="fr_88"></span>[\*](#fn_88.md) Pupil of Phemius, he
received from

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

his benevolent preceptor, simple but pure ideas, which the activity of
his soul developed, which his genius increased, universalized, and
brought to their perfection. His education, begun with an assiduous and
sedentary study, was perfected through observation. He undertook long
journeys for the sole purpose of instructing himself. The political
conditions, contrary to every other project, favoured him.

Greece, after having shaken off the yoke of the Phœnicians and having
become the friend of Egypt rather than her subject, commenced to reap
the fruits of the beautiful institutions that she had received from
Orpheus. Powerful metropolises arose in the heart of this country, long
regarded as a simple colony of Asia, and her native strength being
progressively augmented by the habit of liberty, she had need of
extending herself abroad. <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md) Rich with
the increase of population, she had reacted upon her ancient metropolis,
had taken possession of a great number of cities on the opposite shores
of Asia, and had colonized them. <span id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_90.md)
Phoenicia humiliated, torn by internal dissensions, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_91.md) tossed between the power of the Assyrians
and that of the Egyptians, <span id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_92.md) saw

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

this same Greece that she had civilized and to whom she had given her
gods, her laws, and even the letters of her alphabet, ignore, deny her
benefits, <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) take up arms against her,
carry away her colonies from the shores of Italy and of Sicily, and
becoming mistress of the islands of the Archipelago, tear from her her
sole remaining hope, the empire of the sea. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94.md) The people of Rhodes were overpowered.

Homer, of Greek nationality although born in Asia, profited by these
advantages. He set sail in a vessel, whose patron, Mentes of Leucas, was
his friend, wandered over all the possessions of Greece, visited
Egypt, <span id="fr_95"></span>[3](#fn_95.md) and came to settle at Tyre.
This was the ancient metropolis of Greece, the source and sacred
repository of her mythological traditions. It was there, in this same
temple of the Master of the Universe, <span
id="fr_96"></span>[\*](#fn_96.md) where twelve centuries before
Sanchoniathon had come to study the antiquities of the world, <span
id="fr_97"></span>[4](#fn_97.md) that Homer was able to go back to the
origin of Greek cult and fathom the most hidden meanings of its
mysteries <span id="fr_98"></span>[5](#fn_98.md); it was there that he
chose the first and noblest subject of his chants, that which
constitutes the fable of the Iliad. <span id="fr_99"></span>[†](#fn_99.md)
If one must

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

believe in the very singular accounts which time has preserved to us,
thanks to the blind zeal of certain Christians who have treated them as
heresies, this Helen, whose name applied to the moon signifies the
resplendent, this woman whom Paris carried away from her spouse
Menelaus, is nothing else than the symbol of the human soul, <span
id="fr_100"></span>[\*](#fn_100.md) torn by

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

the principle of generation from that of thought, on account of which
the moral and physical passions declare war. But it would be taking me
too far away from my subject, examining in detail what might be the
meaning of the allegories of Homer. My plan has not been to investigate
this meaning in particular, but to show that it exists in general. Upon
this point I have not only the rational proof which results from the
concatenation of my ideas, but also proof of the fact, which is
furnished to me by the testimonials of the ancients. These testimonials
are recognized at every step, in the works of the philosophers and
chiefly in those of the Stoics. Only a very superficial erudition is
necessary to be convinced of this. <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101.md)
But I ought to make an observation,

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

and this observation will be somewhat novel: it is that, the poetic
inspiration being once received by the poet and his soul finding itself
transported into the intelligible world, all the ideas which then come
to him are universal and in consequence allegorical. So that nothing
true may exist outside of unity, and as everything that is true is one
and homogeneous, it is found that, although the poet gives to his ideas
a form determined in the sentient world, this form agrees with a
multitude of things which, being distinct in their species, are not so
in their genus. This is why Homer has been the man of all men, the type
of all types, the faithful mirror, <span id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102.md)
wherein all ideas becoming reflected have appeared to be created.
Lycurgus read his works, and saw there a model of his legislation. <span
id="fr_103"></span>[2](#fn_103.md) Pericles and Alcibiades had need of his
counsels; they had recourse to him as a model of statesmen. <span
id="fr_104"></span>[3](#fn_104.md) He was for Plato the first of the
philosophers, and for Alexander the greatest of kings; and what is more
extraordinary still, even the sectarians, divided among themselves, were
united in him. The Stoics spoke only of this great poet as a rigid
follower of the Porch <span id="fr_105"></span>[4](#fn_105.md); at the
Academy he was considered as the creator of dialectics; at the Lyceum,
the disciples of Aristotle cited him as a zealous dogmatist <span
id="fr_106"></span>[5](#fn_106.md); finally, the Epicureans saw in him only
a man calm and pure, who, satisfied with that tranquil life where one is
wholly possessed by it, seeks nothing more. <span
id="fr_107"></span>[6](#fn_107.md) The temples, which devout enthusiasm
consecrated to him, were the rendezvous for mankind. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[7](#fn_108.md) Such is the appanage of universal ideas:
they are as the Divinity which inspires them, all in all, and all in the
least parts.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

If, at the distance where I am placed, I should dare, traversing the
torrent of ages and opinions, draw near to Homer and read the soul of
this immortal man, I would say, after having grasped in its entirety the
allegorical genius which makes the essence of poetry, in seeking to give
to his universal ideas a particular form, that his intention was to
personify and paint the passions, and that it was from this that epopœia
had birth. I have not sufficient documents to attest positively that the
word by which one characterizes this kind of poetry after Homer, did not
exist before him; but I have sufficient to repeat that no one had as yet
recognized its real nature. <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md) The
poems of Corinna, of Dares, or of Dictys, were only simple extracts from
the mythological cycles, rude copies from certain theosophical fragments
denuded of life; Homer was the first who caused the *Voice of Impulse*,
that is to say Epopœia, to be understood <span
id="fr_110"></span>[\*](#fn_110.md): that kind of poetry which results from
intellectual inspiration united to the enthusiasm of the passions.

In order to attain to the perfection of this kind of poetry, it is
necessary to unite to the imaginative faculty which feeds the genius,
the reason which regulates the impulse, and the enthusiasm which
inflames the mind and supplies the talent. Homer united them in the most
eminent degree. Thus he possessed the first inspiration and the complete
science, as much in its essence as in its form; for the poetic form is
always dependent upon talent.

This form was then highly favourable to genius. The Greek verse,
measured by musical rhythm and filled with a

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

happy blending of long and short syllables, had long since shaken off
the servile yoke of rhyme. Now, by rhythm was understood the number and
respective duration of the time of which a verse was composed. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111.md) A long syllable was equal to a time
divided in two instants, and equivalent to two short syllables. A foot
was what we name today a measure. The foot contained two times, made up
of two long, or of one long and two short syllables. The verse most
commonly used was the hexameter, that is, that in which the extent was
measured by six rhythmic feet and of which the whole duration was twelve
times. Thus poetry received only the laws of rhythm; it was a kind of
music whose particular harmony, free in its course, was subject only to
measure.

I have never found any authentic evidence that the Greeks had ever used
the rhyme in their verse. It is stated, however, that they have not
differed from other nations in this respect. Voltaire said so but
without proof. <span id="fr_112"></span>[2](#fn_112.md) What is most
certain is that, taking the word *epos*, <span
id="fr_113"></span>[\*](#fn_113.md) a verse, in its most restricted
acceptance, expressing a turn, a turning around again, the early poets
constructed their verse in form of furrows, going from right to left and
returning from left to right. <span id="fr_114"></span>[\*\*](#fn_114.md)
Happily this *bizarrerie* did not last long. If the Greek verses had
thus turned one upon another, or if the rhyme had forced them to proceed
in couplets bent beneath a servile yoke, Homer would not have created
the Epopœia, or these frivolous obstacles would have vanished before
him. His genius, incapable of enduring chains, would have refused to
clothe itself in a form capable of stifling it. But this celebrated man
would no doubt have changed it;

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

one can judge by the energetic manner with which he attacked that which
he found in use. The Greek language, which preserved still in his time
something of the Phœnician stiffness and the Celtic roughness, obliged
to adapt itself to all the movements of his imagination, became the most
flexible and the most harmonious dialect of the earth. One is
astonished, in reading his works, at the boldness of his
composition. <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md) One sees him without
the least effort, bending words at his pleasure, lengthening them,
shortening them to produce something new, reviving those no longer in
use, uniting them, separating them, disposing of them in an unaccustomed
order, forcing them to adapt themselves everywhere to the harmony that
he wishes to depict, to sentiments of elevation, of pleasure or terror,
that he wishes to inspire.

Thus genius, dominating form, creates master-pieces; form, on the
contrary, commanding genius, produces only works of the mind. I must say
finally and no longer veil from the attention of my judges, the aim of
this discourse: whenever rhyme exists in the poetic form, it renders the
form inflexible, it brings upon it only the effort of talent and renders
that of intellectual inspiration useless. Never will the people who
rhyme their verses attain to the height of poetic perfection; never will
real epopœia flourish in their breasts. They will hear neither the
accents inspired by Orpheus, nor the stirring and impassioned harmonies
of Homer. Far from drawing the allegorical genius at its source and
receiving the first inspiration, it will not even recognize the second
one. Its poets will polish painfully certain impassioned or descriptive
verses, and will call beautiful the works which will only be well done.
A rapid glance over the poetic condition of the earth will prove what I
have advanced. But I ought to explain beforehand what I understand by
first and second inspiration; the moment

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

has arrived for holding to the promise that I made at the beginning of
this discourse.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[34:\*](ogv06.htm#fr_88.md) It is needless for me
to observe that the birthplace of Homer has been the object of a host of
discussions as much among the ancients as among the moderns. My plan
here is not to put down again *en problème*, nor to examine anew the
things which have been a hundred times discussed and that I have
sufficiently examined. I have chosen, from the midst of all the
divergent opinions born of these discussions, that which has appeared to
me the most probable, which agrees best with known facts, and which is
connected better with the analytical thread of my ideas. I advise my
readers to do the same. It is neither the birthplace of Homer nor the
name of his parents that is the important matter: it is his genius that
must be fathomed. Those who would, however, satisfy their curiosity
regarding these subjects foreign to my researches, will find in *La
Bibliothèque grecque de Fabricius*, and in the book by Léon Allatius
entitled *De Patriâ Homeri*, enough material for all the systems they
may wish to build. They will find there twenty-six different locations
wherein they can, at their pleasure, place the cradle of the poet. The
seven most famous places indicated in a Greek verse by Aulus Gellius
are, Smyrna, Rhodes, Colophon, Salamis, Chios, Argos, and Athens. The
nineteen indicated by divers authors, are Pylos, Chios, Cyprus,
Clazomenæ, Babylon, Cumæ, Egypt, Italy, Crete, Ithaca, Mycenæ, Phrygia,
Mæonia, Lucania, Lydia, Syria, Thessaly, and finally Troy, and even
Rome.

However, the tradition which I have followed, in considering Homer as
born not far from Smyrna, upon the borders of the river Meles, is not
only <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> the most probable but the most
generally followed; it has in its favour Pindar; the first anonymous
Life of Homer; the Life of this poet by Proclus; Cicero, in his oration
for Archias; Eustathius in his *Prolégoménes sur l’Iliade*; Aristotle,
*Poétique*, l. iii.; Aulus Gellius, Martial, and Suidas. It is known
that Smyrna, jealous of consecrating the glory that it attributed to
itself, of having given birth to Homer, erected to this great genius a
temple with quadrangular portico, and showed for a long time, near the
source of the Meles, a grotto, where a contemporaneous tradition
supposes that he had composed his first works. Voyez *La Vie d’Homère*,

(*col*.), All. Notice that the Teutonic roots are not very different
from the Phœnician: *Herr* signifies lord, and *alles*, all; so that
*Herr-alles* is, with the exception of the guttural inflection which is
effaced, the same word as that of *Hercules*, used by the Thracians and
the Etruscans. The Greeks have made a transposition of letters in
Ἡρακλῆς (Heracles) so as to evade the guttural harshness without
entirely losing it.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[36:†](ogv06.htm#fr_99.md) I have followed the
tradition most analogous to the development of my ideas; but I am aware
that, upon this point, as upon many others, I have only to choose. The
historic fact, in that which relates to the sacerdotal archives which
Homer consulted in composing his poems, is everywhere the same *au*
*fond;* <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> but the accessory details vary
greatly according to the writers who relate them. For example, one reads
in a small fragment attributed to Antipater of Sidon and preserved in
Greece Anthology, that Homer, born at Thebes in Egypt, drew his epic
subjects from the archives of the temple of Isis; from another source,
Ptolemy *Ephestion*, cited by Photius, that the Greek poet had received
from a priest of Memphis, named *Thamitès*, the original writings of an
inspired damsel, named *Phancy*. Strabo, without mentioning any place in
particular, said in general, speaking of the long journeys of Homer,
that this poet went everywhere to consult the religious archives and the
oracles preserved in the temples; and Diodorus of Sicily gives evidence
sometimes that he borrowed many things from a sibyl by the name of
*Manto*, daughter of Tiresias; and sometimes that he appropriated the
verse of a pythoness of Delphi, named Daphne. All these contradictory
details prove, in reality, the truth; for whether it be from Thebes,
Memphis, Tyre, Delphi, or elsewhere that Homer drew the subject of his
chants, matters not with the subject which occupies me: the important
point, serving as proof of my assertions, is, that they have been, in
fact, drawn from a sanctuary; and what has determined me to choose Tyre
rather than Thebes or Memphis, is that Tyre was the first mother city of
Greece.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[37:\*](ogv06.htm#fr_100.md) I have said in the
above that the name of *Helena* or *Selena* was that of the moon in
Greek. The root of this word is alike Celtic and Phœnician. One finds it
in Teutonic *hell*, which signifies clear, luminous, and in Hebrew ‏חלל‎
(*hêll*), which contains the same sense of splendour, glory, and
elevation. One still says in German *heilig*, holy, and *selig*,
blessed; also *selle*, soul, and *seilen*, souls. And this is worthy of
the closest attention, particularly when one reflects that, following
the doctrine of the ancients, the moon *helenê* or *selenê* was regarded
as the reservoir of the souls of those who descend from heaven to pass
into bodies by means of generation, and, purged by the fire of life,
escape from earth to ascend to heaven. See, concerning this doctrine,
Plutarch (*De Facie in Orb. Lun.*), and confer with Beausobre (*Histoire
du Manich.*, t. ii., p. 311). The name of Paris, in Greek Πάρις, comes
from the Phœnician words ‏בר‎ or ‏פר‎ (*bar* or *phar*), all generation,
propagation, extension, and ‏‎ (*ish*), the Being-principle.

The name of Menelaus, in Greek Μενέλαος, comes from the Phœnician words
‏מן‎ (*men*), all that which determines, regulates, or defines a thing,
properly, the *rational faculty*, the reason, the measure, in Latin
*mens*, *mensura;* and ‏אוש‎ (*aôsh*), the Being-principle acting,
before which is placed the prefix <span id="page_38">p. 38</span> ‏ל‎
(*l*), to express the genitive case, in this manner, ‏מנח-ל-אוש‎
(*meneh-l-aôsh*), the rational faculty or regulator of the being in
general, and man in particular: for ‏אש‎, ‏אוש‎, ‏יש‎, ‏איש‎ (*ash*,
*aôsh*, *ish*, *aîsh*), signifies equally *fire*, *principle*, *being*,
and *man*. The etymology of these three words can, as one sees, throw
great light upon the fable of the *Iliad*. Here is another remarkable
point on this subject. Homer has never used, to designate the Greeks,
the name of *Hellenes*, that is to say, the resplendents, or the lunars:
it was in his time quite a new name, which the confederated Greeks had
taken to resist foreign attack; it is only in the *Odyssey*, and when he
is already old, that he employs the name *Hellas* to designate Greece.
The name which he gives constantly to this country, is that of Achaia
(Ἀχαϊα), and he opposes it to that of Troy (Τρωία): now, *Achaia*
signifies the strong, the igneous, the spiritual; and *Troy*, the
terrestrial, the gross. The Phœnician roots are ‏הוי‎ (*ehôi*), the
exhaling force of fire, and ‏טרו‎ (*trô*) the balancing power of the
earth. Refer, in this regard, to Court de Gébelin (*Mond. prim.*, t.
vi., p. 64). Pomponius Sabinus, in his *Commentaires sur l’Enéïde*, said
that the name of the city of Troy signified a sow, and he adds that the
Trojans had for an ensign a sow embroidered in gold.

As to the word *Ilion*, which was the sacred name of Troy, it is very
easy to recognize the name of the material principle, called ὔλε (*ulè*)
by the Greeks and *ylis* by the Egyptians. Iamblichus speaks of it at
great length in his *Book on the Mysteries* (§ 7), as the principle from
which all has birth: this was also the opinion of Porphyry (Euseb.,
*Præp. Evang.*, l. ix., c. 9 and 11).

<span id="fn_110"></span>[40:\*](ogv06.htm#fr_110.md) The word Epopœia is
taken from the Greek ἐπο-ποιός which designates alike a poet and an epic
poem. It is derived from the Phœnician words ‏אפא‎ (*apho*) an
impassioned transport, a vortex, an impulse, an enthusiasm; and ‏פאח‎
(*phohe*), a mouth, a discourse. One can observe that the Latin word
*versus*, which is applied also to a thing which turns, which is borne
along, and to a poetic verse, translates exactly the Greek word ἔπος,
whose root ‏אוף‎ (*aôph*) expresses a *vortex*. The Hebrew ‏אופן‎
(*aôphon*) signifies properly a wheel.
