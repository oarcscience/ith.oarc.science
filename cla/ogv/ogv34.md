### 23. Abstain thou if ‘tis evil; persevere if good.

But although one may bring the absolute skeptic to agree that a
difference between good and evil can indeed exist, as he is forced to
agree that one does exist between that which is and that which is not,
just as I have demonstrated in my preceding Examination; would he not be
right in saying, that to know in general, that good and evil can differ
and consequently exist separately, does not prevent confounding them in
particular; and that he can doubt that man may be able to make the
distinction, until one may have proved to him that not alone their
knowledge, but that some sort of knowledge is possible? Assuredly, this
is pushing doubt very far. One could dispense with replying to this,
since the skeptic already interrogated concerning the difference
existing between what is and what is not has been forced to admit it and
to acquire thus some sort of knowledge of being; but let us forget this,
in order to examine why the savants of Germany have inadequately removed
a difficulty which they have imposed upon themselves.

It is Kant, one of the ablest minds that Europe has produced since the
extinction of learning, who, resolved to terminate with a single blow
the struggle springing up unceasingly between dogmatism and skepticism,
has been the first to form the bold project of creating a science which
should determine, *a priori*, the possibility, the principles, and the
limits of all knowledge. <span id="fr_499"></span>[a](#fn_498.md) This
science, which he named *Critical Philosophy*, or method of
judgment, <span id="fr_500"></span>[b](#fn_499.md) he has developed in
several works of considerable length and very difficult of
comprehension. I do not intend here to

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

make an explanation of this science; for this labour, out of place in
these Examinations, would carry me too far. My intention is only to show
the point wherein it has given way, and how it has furnished new weapons
for the skeptics, in not holding well to the promise that it had made of
determining the principle of knowledge. Therefore, I will suppose the
doctrine of Kant understood or partially so. Several works, circulated
somewhat extensively in France, have unravelled it sufficiently to the
savants. <span id="fr_501"></span>[a](#fn_500.md) I will only say what the
authors of these works have been unable to say, and this will be the
general result of the impression that the study of this doctrine has
made upon me: it is that Kant, who pretends to found all his doctrine
upon principles, *a priori*, abstraction being made of all the
underlying notions of experience, and who, rising into an ideal sphere
there to consider reason in an absolute way, independent of its effects
so as to deduce from it a theory transcendental and purely intelligible,
concerning the principle of knowledge, has done precisely the opposite
from what he wished to do; for not finding what he sought, he has found
what he has not sought, that is to say, the essence of matter. Let the
disciples of this philosophy give attention to what I say. I have known
several systems of philosophy and I have put considerable force into
penetrating them; but I can affirm that there exists not a single one
upon the face of the earth, wherein the primitive matter of which the
Universe is composed may be characterized by traits as striking as in
that of Kant. I believe it impossible either to understand it better or
to depict it better. He uses neither figures, nor symbols; he tells what
he sees with a candour which would

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

have been appalling to Pythagoras and Plato; for what the Koenigsberg
professor advances concerning both the existence and the non-existence
of this matter, <span id="fr_502"></span>[a](#fn_501.md) and of its
intuitive reality, and of its phenomenal illusion, and of its essential
forms, time and space, and of the labour that the mind exercises upon
this equivocal being, which, always being engendered, never, however,
exists; all this, taught in the mysteries, was only clearly revealed to
the initiate. Listen a moment to what has transpired in India: it is the
fundamental axiom of the *Vedantic* school, the illustrious disciples of
Vyasa and of Sankarâchârya, an axiom in accordance with the dogmas of
the sacred books.

Matter exists \[say these philosophers\], but not of an existence such
as is imagined by the vulgar; it exists but it has no essence
independent of intellectual perceptions; for existence and
perceptibility are, in this case, convertible terms. The sage knows that
appearances and their exterior sensations are purely illusory and that
they would vanish into nothingness, if the Divine energy which alone
sustains them was for an instant suspended. <span
id="fr_503"></span>[b](#fn_502.md)

I beg the disciples of Kant to give attention to this passage, and to
remember what Plato has said of the same, that, sometimes matter exists
and sometimes it does not exist <span id="fr_504"></span>[c](#fn_503.md);
as Justin the martyr, and Cyril of Alexandria have reproached him for
it; and as Plutarch and Chalcidius have strongly remarked it, <span
id="fr_505"></span>[d](#fn_504.md) in seeking to excuse this apparent
contradiction.

Let us endeavour now to call attention to the point where Kant is led
astray. This point, in the philosophical course that this savant meant
to pursue, seemed at first of very slight importance; but the deviation
that it causes,

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

although small and almost imperceptible at the first instant, determines
none the less a divergent line, which, turning aside more and more from
the right line proportionably as it is prolonged, is found to strike at
an enormous distance from the mark where Kant hoped it would arrive.
This deviating point—who would have believed it—is found in the
misinterpretation and the misapplication of a word All the attention of
the reader is required here. What I am about to say, in demonstrating
the error of the German philosopher, will serve to supplement all that I
have said pertaining to the doctrine of Pythagoras.

Kant, whether through imitation of the ancient philosophers or through
the effect of his own learning which had made him desirous of knowing
the truth, has considered man under three principal modifications which
he calls faculties. In my twelfth Examination I have said that such was
the doctrine of Pythagoras. Plato, who followed in everything the
metaphysics of this great genius, distinguished in Man as in the
Universe, the body, soul, and spirit; and placed, in each of the
modifications of the particular or universal unity which constituted
them, the analogous faculties which, becoming developed in their turn,
gave birth to three new modifications whose productive unity they
became <span id="fr_506"></span>[a](#fn_505.md); so that each ternary is
represented in its development, under the image of the triple Ternary,
and formed by its union with the Unity, first the Quaternary and
afterwards the Decade. <span id="fr_507"></span>[b](#fn_506.md) Now the
German philosopher,

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

without explaining the principle which led him to consider man under
three principal faculties, states them; without saying to what
particular modification he attributes them, that is, without foreseeing
if these faculties are physical, animistic or intellectual; if they
belong to the body, to the soul, or to the mind: a first mistake which
leads him to a second of which I am about to speak.

In order to express these three faculties, Kant makes use of three words
taken from his own tongue and concerning the meaning of which it is well
to fix our attention. He has named the first of these faculties
*Empfindlichkeit*, the second, *Verstand*, and the third, *Vernunft*.
These three words are excellent; it is only a question of clearly
understanding and explaining them.

The word *Empfindlichkeit* expresses that sort of faculty which consists
in collecting from without, feeling from within, and finding good or
bad. <span id="fr_508"></span>[a](#fn_507.md) It has been very well
rendered in French by the word *sensibilité*.

The word *Verstand* designates that sort of faculty which consists in
reaching afar, being carried from a central point to all other points of
the circumference to seize them. <span id="fr_509"></span>[b](#fn_508.md)
It has been quite well rendered in French by the word *entendement*.

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

The word *Vernunft* is applied to that sort of faculty, which consists
in choosing at a distance, in wishing, in selecting, in electing that
which is good. <span id="fr_510"></span>[a](#fn_509.md) It is expressed by
the word *raison;* but this expresses it very poorly, whatever may be
the real meaning given it by Kant.

This philosopher ought to have realized more fully the origin of this
word and he should have made a more just application; then his system
would have taken another direction and he would have attained his goal.
He would have made us see, and he would have seen himself, the reality,
namely, *intelligence* and not reason.

One can easily see that the faculty which Kant designates by the word
*Empfindlichkeit*, sense perception, belongs to the physical part of
man; and that which he expresses by the word *Verstand*, the
understanding, resides in his animistic part; but one cannot see at all
that what he names *Vernunft*, and which he continually confounds with
reason, may be able in any manner to dominate in his intellectual part.
For this, it would be necessary that he should consider it under the
relation of the intelligence; which he has not done. It is very true
that he has wished to place it constantly in the mind, by representing
the three faculties of which man is composed as a sort of hierarchy, of
which sense perception occupies the base, understanding the centre, and
reason the summit; or as one of his translators said, imagining this
hierarchy under the emblem of an empire, of which sense perception
constitutes the subjects, understanding the

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

agents or ministers, and reason the sovereign or legislator. <span
id="fr_511"></span>[a](#fn_510.md) I cannot conceive how Kant, by giving
the word *Vernunft*, the meaning of the Latin word *ratio*, has been
able to say that it is the highest degree of the activity of a mind
which has the power of all its liberty, and the consciousness of all its
strength <span id="fr_512"></span>[b](#fn_511.md): there is nothing more
false. Reason does not exist in liberty, but on the contrary, in
necessity. Its movement, which is geometric, is always forced: it is an
inference from the point of departure, and nothing more. Let us examine
this carefully. The Latin word *ratio*, whose meaning Kant has visibly
followed, has never translated exactly the Greek word *logos*, in the
sense of *word;* and if the Greek philosophers have substituted
sometimes the *logos* for *nous*, or the word for the intelligence, by
taking the effect for the cause, it is wrong when the Romans have tried
to imitate them, by using *ratio*, in place of *mens*, or
*intelligentia*. In this they have proved their ignorance and have
disclosed the calamitous ravages that skepticism had already made among
them. The word *ratio* springs from the root *ra* or *rat*, which in all
the tongues where it has been received, has carried the idea of a *ray*,
a straight line drawn from one point to another. <span
id="fr_513"></span>[c](#fn_512.md) Thus reason, far from being free as Kant
has pretended, is what is the most constrained in nature: it is a
geometric line, always subject to the point whence it emanates, and
forced to strike the point toward which it is directed under penalty of
ceasing to be itself; that is to say, of ceasing to be straight. Now,
reason not being free in its course, is neither good nor bad in itself;
it is always analogous to the principle of which it is the

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

inference. Its nature is to go straight; its perfection is nothing else.
One goes straight in every way, in every direction, high, low, to right,
to left; one reasons correctly in truth as in error, in vice as in
virtue: all depends upon the principle from which one sets out, and upon
the manner in which one looks at things. Reason does not give this
principle; it is no more master of the end which it goes to attain, than
the straight line drawn upon the ground is master of the point toward
which it tends. This end and this point are determined beforehand, by
the position of the reasoner or by geometry.

1 Reason exists alike in the three great human modifications, although
its principal seat is in the soul, according to Plato. <span
id="fr_514"></span>[a](#fn_513.md) There is a physical reason acting in the
instinct, a moral reason acting in the soul, and an intellectual reason
acting in the mind. When a hungry dog brings to his master a piece of
game without touching it, he obeys an instinctive reason which makes him
sacrifice the pleasure of gratifying his appetite, to the pain of
receiving the blow of a stick. When a man dies at his post instead of
abandoning it, he follows a moral reason which makes him prefer the
glory of dying to the shame of living. When a philosopher admits the
immortality of the soul, he listens to an intellectual reason which
shows him the impossibility of its annihilation. All this, nevertheless,
takes place only so far as the dog, the man, and the philosopher admit
the real principles; for if they admitted false principles, their
reasons, although equally well deduced, would conduct them to opposed
results; and the piece of game would be eaten, the post would be
abandoned, and the immortality of the soul would be denied.

One ought to feel now the mistake of Kant in all its extent. This
philosopher having confounded one of the principal modifications of man,
his intelligence, <span id="fr_515"></span>[b](#fn_514.md) whose

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

seat is in the soul, with one of his secondary faculties, his reason,
finds himself, in raising this reason outside of its place and giving it
a dominance that it has not, ousting entirely the spiritual part; so
that meditating constantly in the median part of his being, which he
believed to be the superior, and descending, he found matter, understood
it perfectly, and missed absolutely the spirit. What he assumed was, it
was nothing else than the understanding, a neuter faculty placed between
sense perception which is purely passive, and the intelligence which is
wholly active. He had the weakness to fix his thought here and
thenceforth was lost. Reason which he invoked to teach him to
distinguish, in his ideas, the part which is furnished by the spirit,
from that which is given by objects, was only able to show him the
straight line that it described in his understanding. This line being
buried in matter instead of rising in intelligible regions, taught him
that everything that did not correspond to a possible experience could
not furnish him the subject of a positive knowledge, and thus all the
great questions upon the existence of God, the immortality of the soul,
the origin of the Universe; all that pertains to theosophy, to
cosmology; in short, all that which is intelligible, cannot take place
in the order of his understanding. <span id="fr_516"></span>[a](#fn_515.md)
This catastrophe, quite inevitable as it was, was none the less
poignant. It was odd to see a man who seemed to promise to establish the
possibility and the principles of all knowledge upon an incontestable
basis, announce coldly that God, the Universe, and the Soul could not be
subjects there, and soon discover, pushed by the force of his reasoning,
that even the reality of physical subjects by which the senses are
affected is only phenomenal, that one can in no way know what they are,
but only what they appear to

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

be <span id="fr_517"></span>[a](#fn_516.md); and that even one’s own Self,
considered as a subject, is also for one only a phenomenon, an
appearance, concerning the intimate essence of which one can learn
nothing. <span id="fr_518"></span>[b](#fn_517.md) Kant felt indeed the
terrible contradiction into which he had fallen; but instead of
retracing courageously his steps, and seeking above reason for the
principles of knowledge that it did not possess, he continued his
descending movement which he called transcendental, and finally
discovered beneath this *pure Reason*, a certain *practical Reason*, to
which he confided the destinies of the greatest subjects with which man
can be occupied: God, nature, and himself. This practical reason, which
is no other than *common sense*, ought, according to him, to bring man
to believe what is not given him to know, <span
id="fr_519"></span>[c](#fn_518.md) and to engage him, through the need of
his own felicity, to follow the paths of virtue, and to admit the system
of recompense which proceeds from the existence of God and the
immortality of the soul. Thus, this common sense, already invoked to aid
the existence of the physical subjects which Berkeley reduced to
nothingness, was called, under another name, to sustain that of the
spiritual beings which Kant admitted baffling the action of his pure
reason; but this faculty, vainly proposed by Shaftesbury, <span
id="fr_520"></span>[d](#fn_519.md) by Hutcheson, <span
id="fr_521"></span>[e](#fn_520.md) by Reid <span
id="fr_522"></span>[f](#fn_521.md) by Oswald, <span
id="fr_523"></span>[g](#fn_522.md) by the celebrated Pascal himself, <span
id="fr_524"></span>[h](#fn_523.md) to give a support to the first truths,
and to furnish the principles of our moral and physical knowledge; this
faculty, I say, whose seat is in the instinct, has been easily
challenged as incompetent to pronounce upon the subjects which are
outside the jurisdiction of its judgments;

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

for it has been keenly felt that it was abandoning these subjects to the
prejudices of the vulgar, to their erroneous opinions, to their blind
passions; and that practical philosophy or common sense, acting in each
man according to the extent of his views, would only embarrass relative
truths and would create as many principles as individuals. Furthermore
was it not to run counter to common sense itself, to submit intelligence
and reason to it? Was it not subverting Nature, and, as it were, causing
light to spring upward from below, seeking in the particular, the law
which rules the Universal?

The skeptics who saw all these things triumphed, but their triumph only
proved their weakness; for Reason, by which they demonstrated
nothingness, is the sole weapon of which they can make use. This faculty
overthrown in Kant, leaves them powerless, and delivers them defenceless
to the irresistible axioms that the intelligence places *a priori* upon
the primordial truths and the fundamental principles of the Universe,
even as the sequel of these Examinations will demonstrate.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[209:b](ogv34.htm#fr_507.md) The idea of making
the quaternary spring from the unity, and the decade from the quaternary
is expressed literally in the following lines of Pythagoras, preserved
by Proclus:

.     .    .    Πρόεισιν ὀ θεῖος ἀριθμὸς

The immortal Decade, honoured in all places.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[210:a](ogv34.htm#fr_508.md) The nearest root of
this word is find, whence is derived *finden*, to find; its remote root
is *hand*, the seat of touch, whence comes *finger*, that which feels;
its primitive root is ‏אד‎ or ‏יד‎ (*âd* or *id*), the hand in
Phœnician. This last root, becoming nasal at the final and aspirate at
the initial, has produced *hand;* *fang*, a capture, and *find*, a
discovery. The syllable *emp*, which precedes the root *find*, expresses
the movement which lifts up from below; *lich* designates that which
disqualifies by identity, and *keit*, that which substantiates.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[210:b](ogv34.htm#fr_509.md) The root of this word
is stand, a fixed thing, a state; its remote root is stat, that which is
permanent. Its primitive root is ‏שדד‎ (*shdad*), firmness, force,
constancy. The initial syllable ver expresses the movement which carries
far away, which transports from the place where one is, to that where
one is not.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[211:a](ogv34.htm#fr_510.md) The nearest root of
this word, as well as its remote root, has disappeared from the modern
German, where one finds only its derivatives. Its primitive root is in
the Latin word *opt*, whence comes *opto*, I choose; and *optime*, best.
This root is attached to the Phœnician ‏עיף‎ (*whôph*), anything which
is raised above another thing. It becomes nasal in the German word and
has changed the *ph* to *ft*. From it is derived the Saxon, English,
Belgian, and Danish word *up*, which expresses the movement of
everything which tends above. Also from it, the German word *luft*, air,
and the English word *aloft*, that which is elevated. The preposition
*ver* has taken the final *n*, placing it before *unft*, as it carries
it constantly in its analogue *fern*, that which is distant. Likewise
one says *fernglass*, a telescope with which one sees at a distance.

languages ‏רו‎ (*rou*) indicates the visual ray, and ‏רד‎ (*rad*), all
movement which is determined upon a straight line. This root,
accompanied by a guttural inflection, is called *recht*, in German, and
*right* in English and Saxon. The Latins made of it *rectum*, that which
is straight. In French *rature* and *rateau*. The Teutons, taking right
in a figurative sense, have drawn from this same root, *rath*, a
council, and *richter*, a judge.
