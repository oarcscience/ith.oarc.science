Fabre d'Olivet (b. 1768, d. 1825), a French esoteric writer, originally
published this book in 1813. The first section, an essay on esoteric
Poetics, was dedicated to the Section of Literature of the Imperial
Institute of France. The [second portion](ogv11.md) contains the Greek text
of the Golden Verses, along with French and English translations. The
final part of the book is an extended essay on the Golden Verses.

The Golden Verses are also available at this site in a more recent
English [translation by Florence Firth](../gvp/index.md).
