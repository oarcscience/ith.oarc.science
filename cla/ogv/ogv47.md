*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

### 36. . . . Thou who fathomed it. O wise and happy man, rest in its haven. But observe my laws, abstaining from the things Which thy soul must fear, distinguishing them well; Letting intelligence o’er thy body reign.

Lysis, speaking always in the name of Pythagoras, addressed himself to
those of the disciples of this theosophist,

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

who had reached the highest degree of perfection, or autopsy, and the
felicity of their welfare. I have said often enough in the course of
these Examinations, what should be understood by this last degree, so
that I need not refer to it here. I shall not even pause upon what has
reference to the symbolic teachings of Pythagoras, the formularies and
dietetics that he gave to his disciples, and the abstinences that he
prescribed for them, my design being to give incidentally a particular
explanation of it, for the purpose of not further prolonging this
volume. It is well known that all of the eminent men, as many among the
ancients as among the moderns, all the savants commendable for their
labours or their learning, are agreed in regarding the precepts of
Pythagoras as symbolical, that is, as containing figuratively, a very
different meaning from that which they would seem to offer
literally. <span id="fr_665"></span>[a](#fn_664.md) It was the custom of
the Egyptian priests from whom he had imbibed them, <span
id="fr_666"></span>[b](#fn_665.md) to conceal their doctrine beneath an
outer covering of parables and allegories. <span
id="fr_667"></span>[c](#fn_666.md) The world was, in their eyes, a vast
enigma, whose mysteries, clothed in a style equally enigmatical, ought
never to be openly divulged. <span id="fr_668"></span>[d](#fn_667.md) These
priests had three kinds of characters, and three ways of expressing and
depicting their thoughts. The first manner of writing and of speaking
was clear and simple; the second, figurative; and the third, symbolic.
In the first, they employed characters used by all peoples and took the
words in their literal meaning; in the second, they used hieroglyphic
characters, and took the words in an indirect and metaphorical meaning;
finally in the third, they made use of phrases with double meaning

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

of historic and astronomical fables, or of simple allegories. <span
id="fr_669"></span>[a](#fn_668.md) The *chef-d’œuvre* of the sacerdotal art
was uniting these three ways, and enclosing under the appearance of a
clear and simple style, the vulgar, figurative, and symbolic meaning.
Pythagoras has sought this kind of perfection in his precepts and often
he has succeeded; but the one of all the theosophists instructed in the
sanctuaries of Thebes or of Memphis, who has pushed farthest this
marvellous art, is beyond doubt Moses. The first part of his Sepher,
vulgarly called *Genesis*, and that should be called by its original
name of *Bereshith*, is in this style, the most admirable work, the most
astounding feat of strength that is possible for a man to conceive and
execute. This book, which contains all the science of the ancient
Egyptians, is still to be translated and will only be translated when
one will put oneself in a condition to understand the language in which
it has primitively been composed.
