### 15. Consult, deliberate, and freely choose.

In explaining this line from a moral standpoint as Hierocles has done,
one readily feels that to deliberate and choose in that which relates to
moral conduct, consists in seeking for what is good or evil in an
action, and in attaching oneself to it or fleeing from it, without
letting oneself be drawn along by the lure of pleasure or the fear of
pain. <span id="fr_427"></span>[b](#fn_426.md) But if

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

one penetrates still deeper into the meaning of this line, it is seen
that it proceeds from principles previously laid down regarding the
necessity of Destiny and the power of the Will; and that Pythagoras
neglected no opportunity for making his disciples feel that, although
forced by Destiny to find themselves in such or such a condition, they
remained free to weigh the consequences of their action, and to decide
themselves upon the part that they ought to take. The following lines
are, as it were, the corollary of his counsel.
