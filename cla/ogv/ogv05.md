### § II

Poetry, transported with the seat of religion from the mountains of
Thrace to those of Phocis, lost there, as did religion, its primitive
unity. Not only did each sovereign pontiff use it to spread his dogmas,
but the opposed sects born of the rending of the cult, vying with each
other, took possession of it. These sects, quite numerous, personified
by the allegorical genius which presided over poetry, and which, as I
have said, constituted its essence, were confused with the mind which
animated them and were considered as a particular being. Thence, so many
of the demi-gods, and the celebrated heroes, from whom the Greek tribes
pretended to have descended; thence, so many of the famous poets to whom
were attributed a mass of works that emanated from the same sanctuary,
or were composed

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

for the support of the same doctrine. For it is well to remember that
the allegorical history of these remote times, written in a different
spirit from the positive history which has succeeded it, resembled it in
no way, and that it is in having confused them that so many grave errors
have arisen. It is a very important observation that I again make here.
This history, confided to the memory of men or preserved among the
sacerdotal archives of the temples in detached fragments of poetry,
considered things only from the moral side, was never occupied with
individuals, but saw only the masses; that is to say, peoples,
corporations, sects, doctrines, even arts and sciences, as so many
particular beings that it designated by a generic name. It is not that
these masses were unable to have a chief to direct their movements, but
this chief, regarded as the instrument of a certain mind, was neglected
by history which attached itself to the mind only. One chief succeeded
another without allegorical history making the least mention of it. The
adventures of all were accumulated upon the head of one alone. It was
the moral thing whose course was examined, whose birth, progress, or
downfall was described. The succession of things replaced that of
individuals. Positive history, which ours has become, follows a method
entirely different. The individuals are everything for it: it notes with
scrupulous exactitude dates and facts which the other scorns.

I do not pronounce upon their common merit. The moderns would mock that
allegorical manner of the ancients, if they could believe it possible,
as I am persuaded the ancients would have mocked the method of the
moderns, had they been able to foresee its possibility in the future.
How approve of what is unknown? Man approves of only what he likes; he
always believes he knows all that he ought to like.

I can say, after having repeated this observation, that the poet Linus,
who is regarded as the author of all the melancholy chants of the
ancient world, represents nothing

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

less than lunar poetry detached from the doctrine of Œtolinos, of which
I have spoken, and considered as schismatic by the Thracians; I can also
say, that the poet Amphion, whose chants were, on the contrary, so
powerful and so virile, typifies the orthodox solar poetry, opposed by
these same Thracians; whereas the prophet Thamyris, who, it is said,
celebrated in such stately verse the creation of the world and the war
of the Titans, <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) I represents quite
plainly the universal doctrine of Olen, re-established by his followers.
The name of Amphion signifies the orthodox or national voice of Greece;
that of Thamyris, the twin lights of the gods. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[\*](#fn_34.md) One feels, accordingly, that the evils
which came to Linus and to Thamyris, one of whom was killed by
Hercules, <span id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md) and the other deprived of
sight by the Muses, <span id="fr_36"></span>[3](#fn_36.md) are, in reality,
only some sort of criticism or unfortunate incident sustained by the
doctrines which they represented, on account of the opposition of the
Thracians. What I have said concerning Linus, Amphion, and Thamyris, can
be applied to the greater part of the poets who preceded Homer, and
Fabricius names seventy of these <span id="fr_37"></span>[4](#fn_37.md);
one could also extend it to Orpheus, but only on a certain side; for
although it may be very true, that no positive detail is possessed
regarding the character of the celebrated man, founder or propagator of
the doctrine which has borne this name; although it may be very true,
that all that concerns his birth, his life, and his death is completely
unknown, it is none the less certain that this man has existed, that he
has been actually the head of a very extended sect, and that the

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

allegorical fables which remain to us on this subject depict, more
particularly than they have done with any other, the course of his
thoughts and the success of his institutions.

Orpheus belongs, on the one side, to anterior times, and on the other,
to times merely ancient. The epoch when he appeared is the line of
demarcation between pure allegory and mixed allegory, the intelligible
and the sentient. He taught how to ally the rational faculty with the
imaginative faculty. The science which was a long time after called
philosophy, originated with him. He laid its first basis.

One should guard against believing, following in the footsteps of
certain historians deceived by the meaning of allegorical fables, that
when Orpheus appeared, Greece, still barbarous, offered only the traces
of a civilization hardly outlined, or that the ferocious animals, tamed
by the charm of his poetry, should represent, in effect, the inhabitants
of this beautiful country. Men capable of receiving a cult so brilliant
as that of Orpheus, a doctrine so pure, and mysteries so profound; men
who possessed a language so formed, so noble, so harmonious as that
which served that inspired man to compose his hymns, were far from being
ignorant and savage to this degree. It is not true, as has been said and
repeated without examination, that poetry had its birth in the forests,
in regions rough and wild, nor above all, that it may be the concomitant
of the infancy of the nations and the first stammerings of the human
mind. Poetry, on the contrary, having attained its perfection, indicates
always a long existence among the peoples, a civilization very advanced
and all the splendour of a virile age. The sanctuary of the temple is
its true cradle. Glance over the savage world and see if the Iroquois or
the Samoyeds have a poetry. Have the peoples who were found in their
infancy in the isles of the Pacific shown you hymns like those of
Orpheus, epic monuments like the poems of Homer?

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Is it not known
that the Tartars who have subjugated Asia, those proud Manchus who today
reign over China, have never been able to derive from their language,
rebellious to all kinds of melody and rhythm, a single verse, <span
id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md) although since their conquests they have
felt and appreciated the charms of this art? <span
id="fr_39"></span>[\*](#fn_39.md)

Bears and lions, tamed and brought nearer together by Orphic poetry,
have no reference to men, but to things: they are the symbols of rival
sects which, imbibing their hatred at the very foot of the altars,
diffused it over all that surrounded them and filled Greece with
troubles.

For a long time this country was a prey to the double scourge of
religious and political anarchy. In detaching herself from the cult of
the metropolis, she also detached herself from its government. Once a
colony of the Phœnicians, she had thrown off their yoke, not however
spontaneously and *en masse*, but gradually, over and over again; so
that there were twenty rival temples, twenty rival cities, twenty petty
peoples divided by rite, by civil interest, and by the ambition of the
priests and princes who governed them. The Thracians, remaining faithful
to the ancient laws, were styled superstitious or enslaved, whereas the
innovators and the insurgents were considered, by the Thracians and
often by themselves, schismatics and rebels. Phoenicia had vainly wished
to oppose this general desertion. Asia came to experience the most
terrible shocks. India, which had long held the sceptre there, was
buried for fifteen hundred years in her *Kali-youg*, or her age of
darkness, and offered only the shadow of her ancient

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

splendour. <span id="fr_40"></span>[\*](#fn_40.md) For fifteen centuries
she had lost her unity by the extinction of her imperial dynasties. Many
rival kingdoms were formed, <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) whose
constant quarrels had left them neither the leisure nor the possibility
of watching over and supporting their colonies from afar. The gradual
lowering of the Mediterranean, and the alluvial deposit of the shores of
Egypt raising the Isthmus of Suez, <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md)
had cut off all communication between this sea and the Red Sea, and, by
barriers difficult to surmount, separated the primitive Phœnicians,
established upon the shores of the Indian Ocean, from those of
Palestine. <span id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md) The meridional Arabs were
separated from

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

the septentrional, and both had broken with the Indians to whom they had
formerly belonged. <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md) Tibet had adopted
a particular cult and form of government. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md) Persia had been subject to the empire of
the Assyrians. <span id="fr_46"></span>[3](#fn_46.md) At last the political
ties which united all these states, and which once formed only a vast
group under the domination of the Indian monarchs, had become relaxed or
broken on all sides. Egypt, long subject to the Philistines, known under
the name of Shepherds, came at length to drive them out, and emerging
from her lethargy prepared herself to seize the influence which Asia had
allowed to escape. <span id="fr_47"></span>[4](#fn_47.md) Already the most
warlike of her kings, Sethos, had extended his empire over both Libya
and Arabia; Phoenicia and Assyria had been subjugated; he had entered
triumphant into Babylon and was seated upon the throne of Belus. <span
id="fr_48"></span>[5](#fn_48.md) He would not have hesitated to attempt the
conquest of Greece, if he had been able as easily to lead his army
there; but it was difficult for him to create a marine force, and above
all to overcome the invincible repugnance that the Egyptians had for the
sea. <span id="fr_49"></span>[6](#fn_49.md) Obliged to employ the
Phœnicians, his ancient enemies, he was able to draw from them only
mediocre service. In spite of these obstacles and the stubborn
resistance of the Greeks, he succeeded nevertheless in making some
conquests and forming some partial settlements.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Athens, so
celebrated later, was one of the principal ones. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

These events, these revolutions, calamitous in appearance, were in
reality to produce great benefits. Greece, already impregnated with the
learning of the Phœnicians, which she had obtained and elaborated,
afterward received that of the Egyptians and elaborated it still
further. A man born in the heart of Thrace, but carried in his childhood
into Egypt through the desire for knowledge, <span
id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md) returned to his country with one of the
Egyptian colonies, to kindle there the new light. He was initiated into
all the mysteries of religion and science: he surpassed, said Pausanias,
all those who had preceded him, by the beauty of his verse, the
sublimity of his chants, and the profoundness of his knowledge in the
art of healing and of appeasing the gods. <span
id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_52.md) This was Orpheus: he took this name from
that of his doctrine <span id="fr_53"></span>[\*](#fn_53.md) which aimed to
cure and to save by knowledge.

I should greatly overstep the limits that I have prescribed for this
discourse if I should recall in detail all that Greece owed to this
celebrated man. The mythological tradition has consecrated in a
brilliant allegory the efforts which he made to restore to men the truth
which they had lost. His love for Eurydice, so much sung by the poets,
is but the symbol of the divine science for which he longed. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[†](#fn_54.md) The name of this mysterious spouse, whom
he vainly wished to return to the light, signified only the doctrine of
the true science, the teaching of what is beautiful and veritable, by
which he tried to enrich the earth. But

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

man cannot look upon the face of truth before attaining the intellectual
light, without losing it; if he dare to contemplate it in the darkness
of his reason, it vanishes. This is what the fable, which everyone
knows, of Eurydice, found and lost, signifies.

Orpheus, who felt by his own experience, perhaps, the great disadvantage
that he had here, of presenting the truth to men before they might be in
condition to receive it, instituted the divine mysteries; an admirable
school where the initiate, conducted from one degree to another, slowly
prepared and tried, received the share of light in proportion to the
strength of his intelligence, and gently enlightened, without risk of
being dazzled, attained to virtue, wisdom, and truth. There has been but
one opinion in antiquity concerning the utility of the mysteries, before
dissolution had stained its precincts and corrupted its aim. All the
sages, even Socrates, have praised this institution, <span
id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) the honour of which has been constantly
attributed to Orpheus. <span id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md) It is not
improbable that this sage had found the model in Egypt and that he
himself had been initiated, as Moses <span id="fr_57"></span>[3](#fn_57.md)
and Pythagoras <span id="fr_58"></span>[4](#fn_58.md) had been before and
after him; but in this case an imitation was equivalent to a creation.

I have said that after the appearance of Orpheus, poetry had lost its
unity: as divided as the cult, it had sustained its vicissitudes.
Entirely theosophical in its principle, and calm as the Divinity which
inspired it, it had taken in the midst of the opposed sects a passionate
character which it had not had previously. The priests, who used it to
uphold their opinions, had found, instead of the real inspiration, that
sort of physical exaltation which results from the

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

fire of passions, whose movement and fleeting splendour entrance the
vulgar. Vying with each other they had brought forth a mass of
theological systems, had multiplied the allegorical fables concerning
the universe, and had drowned, as it were, the unity of the Divinity in
the vain and minute distinction of its infinite faculties; and as each
composed in his own dialect and in pursuance of his own caprice, each
devised unceasingly new names for the same beings, according as they
believed they caught a glimpse of a certain new virtue in these beings
that another had not expressed, it came to pass that not only were the
gods multiplied by the distinction of their faculties, but still more by
the diversity of names employed in expressing them. Very soon there was
not a city nor a town in Greece, that did not have, or at least believed
that it had, its own particular god. If one had carefully examined this
prodigious number of divinities, one would have clearly seen that they
could be reduced, by elimination, to a small number and would finally
end by being mingled in a sole Universal Being; but that was very
difficult for people, flattered, moreover, by a system which compared
the condition of the gods with theirs, and offered them thus, protectors
and patrons so much the more accessible as they were less occupied and
less powerful. <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md) Vainly, therefore,
the Egyptian colony established at Athens presented to the adoration of
this people imbued with the prejudice of polytheism, the sovereign of
the gods under the title of the Most-High <span
id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60.md); the veneration of this people was turned
wholly towards Minerva, who became its patron under the name of
Athena, <span id="fr_61"></span>[3](#fn_61.md) as Juno was that of
Argos, <span id="fr_62"></span>[4](#fn_62.md) Ceres, that of Eleusis,
Phigalia, Methydrium, <span id="fr_63"></span>[5](#fn_63.md) etc.

Orpheus, instructed as was Moses, in the sanctuaries of Egypt, had the
same ideas as the legislator of the Hebrews

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

upon the unity of God, but the different circumstances in which he found
himself placed did not permit him to divulge this dogma; he reserved
this for making it the basis of his mysteries, and continued, in the
meantime, to personify in his poetry the attributes of the Divinity. His
institutions, drawn from the same source, founded upon the same truths,
received the imprint of his character and that of the people to whom he
had destined them. As those of Moses were severe and, if one must admit,
harsh in form, enemies of the sciences and arts, so those of Orpheus
were brilliant, fitted to seduce the minds, favourable to all the
developments of the imagination. It was beneath the allurements of
pleasure, of joy, and of *fêtes*, that he concealed the utility of his
lessons and the depth of his doctrine. Nothing was more full of pomp
than the celebration of its mysteries. Whatever majesty, force, and
grace, poetry, music, and painting had, was used to excite the
enthusiasm of the initiate. <span id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md) He found
no pretext advantageous enough, no form beautiful enough, no charm
powerful enough to interest the hearts and attract them toward the
sublime truths which he proclaimed. These truths, whose force the early
Christians have recognized, <span id="fr_65"></span>[2](#fn_65.md) went
much further than those of which Moses had been the interpreter; they
seemed to anticipate the times. Not only did he teach of the unity of
God, <span id="fr_66"></span>[\*](#fn_66.md) and give the most sublime
ideas of this unfathomable Being <span id="fr_67"></span>[3](#fn_67.md);
not only did he explain the birth of the Universe and the origin of
things <span id="fr_68"></span>[4](#fn_68.md); but he represented this
unique God under the emblem of a mysterious Trinity endowed

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

with three names <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md); he spoke of the
dogma which Plato announced a long time after concerning the Logos, or
the Divine Word; and, according to Macrobius, taught even its
incarnation or its union with matter, its death or its division in the
world of sense, its resurrection or its transfiguration, and finally its
return to the original Unity. <span id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70.md)

This inspired man, by exalting in Man the imagination, that admirable
faculty which makes the charm of life, fettered the passions which
trouble its serenity. Through him his disciples enjoyed the enthusiasm
of the fine arts and he insisted that their customs should be pure and
simple. <span id="fr_71"></span>[3](#fn_71.md) The régime that he
prescribed for them was that which Pythagoras introduced later <span
id="fr_72"></span>[4](#fn_72.md). One of the most pleasing rewards which he
offered to their endeavours, the very aim of their initiation into his
mysteries, was, putting themselves in communion with the gods <span
id="fr_73"></span>[5](#fn_73.md); freeing themselves from the cycle of
generations, purifying their soul, and rendering it worthy of projecting
itself, after the downfall of its corporal covering toward its primal
abode, to the realms of light and happiness. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[6](#fn_74.md)

Despite my resolution to be brief, I cannot resist the pleasure of
speaking at greater length of Orpheus, and of recalling, as is my
custom, things which, appearing today wholly foreign to my subject,
nevertheless, when examined from my viewpoint, belong to it. Poetry was
not at all in its origin what it became later, a simple accomplishment,
regarded by those who profess to be savants as even rather
frivolous <span id="fr_75"></span>[\*](#fn_75.md); it was the language of
the gods, *par excellence*,

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

that of the prophets, the ministers of the altars, the preceptors and
the legislators of the world. I rejoice to repeat this truth, after
rendering homage to Orpheus, to this admirable man, to whom Europe owes
the *éclat* with which she has shone and with which she will shine a
long time. Orpheus has been the real creator of poetry and of
music, <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) the father of mythology, of
morals, and of philosophy: it is he who has served as model for Hesiod
and Homer, who has illumined the footsteps of Pythagoras and Plato.

After having wisely accommodated the outward ceremonies to the minds of
the people whom he wished to instruct, Orpheus divided his doctrine into
two parts, the one vulgar, and the other mysterious and secret,
following in this the method of the Egyptians, whose disciple he had
been <span id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77.md); then, turning his attention to
poetry, and seeing into what chaos this science had fallen and the
confusion that had been made of divine and profane things, he
judiciously separated it into two principal branches, which he assigned,
the one to theology, the other to natural philosophy. It can be said
that he gave in each the precept and the example. As sublime a
theosophist as he was profound as a philosopher, he composed an immense
quantity of theosophical and philosophical verses upon all sorts of
subjects. Time has destroyed nearly all of them; but their memory has
been perpetuated. Among the works of Orpheus that were cited by the
ancients and whose loss must be deplored, were found, on the subject of
theosophy, *The Holy Word* or *The Sacred Logos*, <span
id="fr_78"></span>[\*](#fn_78.md) by which Pythagoras and Plato profited
much; the *Theogony*, which preceded that of Hesiod more than five
centuries; The Initiations to the *Mysteries of the Mother of the
Gods*, <span id="fr_79"></span>[\*\*](#fn_79.md) and *The Ritual of the
Sacrifices*, wherein he had recorded, undoubtedly, the divers parts of
his doctrine <span id="fr_80"></span>[3](#fn_80.md): on the subject of
philosophy, a celebrated

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

cosmogony was found, <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](ogv06.htm#fn_81.md) in
which an astronomical system was developed that would be an honour to
our century, touching the plurality of the worlds, the station of the
sun at the centre of the universe, and the habitation of the
stars. <span id="fr_82"></span>[2](ogv06.htm#fn_82.md) These extraordinary
works emanated from the same genius who had written in verse upon
grammar, music, natural history, upon the antiquities of the many isles
of Greece, upon the interpretation of signs and prodigies, and a mass of
other subjects, the details of which one can see in the commencement of
the Argonautica of Onomacritus, which is attributed to him.

But at the same time that Orpheus opened thus to his successor two very
distinct careers, theosophical and philosophical, he did not entirely
neglect the other parts of this science: his hymns and his odes assigned
him to a distinguished rank among the lyric poets; his *Démétréïde*
presaged the beauties of Epopœia, and the representations full of pomp,
that he introduced into his mysteries, gave birth to Greek Melopœia
whence sprang dramatic art. He can therefore be regarded, not only as
the precursor of Hesiod and Epimenides, but even as that of Homer,
Æschylus, and Pindar. I do not pretend, in saying this, to take away
anything from the glory of these celebrated men: the one who indicates a
course, yields to the one who executes it: now this, especially, is what
Homer did.

Indian Kali-youg is placed 3101 or 3102 years before our era. Fréret has
fixed it, in his chronological researches, at January 16, 3102, a half
hour before the winter solstice, in the colure of which was then found
the first star of Aries. The Brahmans say that this age of darkness and
uncleanness must endure 432,000 years. Kali signifies in Sanskrit, all
that which is black, shadowy, material, bad. From there, the Latin word
*caligo*; and the French word *galimatias;* the last part of this word
comes from the Greek word μῦθος, a discourse, which is itself derived
from the Phœnician ‏מיט‎ (*mot* or *myt*), which expresses all that

this epoch that India was divided into many independent sovereignties
and that a powerful reformer of the cult appeared in Magadha, who took
the surname of *Buddha*.

historian said that in the early times all Egypt was a morass, with the
exception of the country of Thebes; that nothing was seen of the land,
which one saw there at the epoch in which he was writing, beyond Lake
Mœris; and that going up the river, during a seven days’ journey, all
seemed a vast sea. This same writer said in the beginning of book i.,
and this is very remarkable, that the Phœnicians had entered from the
Red Sea into the Mediterranean, to establish themselves upon its shores,
which they would have been unable to do if the Isthmus of Suez had
existed. See what Aristotle says on this subject, *Meteorolog.*, l. i.,

Philistines, on account of their same country, *Palis-sthan*, going out
from India, established themselves upon the Persian Gulf and, under the
name of Phœnicians, came afterwards along the coast of Yemen, on the
borders of the Red Sea, whence they passed into the Mediterranean Sea,
as Herodotus said, according to the Persian traditions. This coincidence
is of great historical interest.

Yemen, and that of the Koreishites, who occupied the septentrional part,
or Hejaz. The capital of the Himyarites was called *Dhofar;* their kings
took the title of *Tobba* and enjoyed an hereditary power. The
