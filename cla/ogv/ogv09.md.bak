*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### § VI

The Greeks and the Romans, as guilty of ingratitude as of injustice,
have styled Asia barbarous, without thinking that they thus outraged
their Mother, the one from whom both had their origin and their first
instructions. Europe, more impartial today, begins to feel as she should
toward this ancient and noble country, and rendering to her venerable
scars a filial respect, does not judge her according to her present
weakness, but according to the vigour that she possessed in the age of
her strength, and of which her magnificent productions still bear the
imprint. A philosophical observer, academician of Calcutta, turning an
investigating eye upon that part of the terrestrial continent, has
recognized there five principal nations, among which that of the Indians
holds the first rank; the others are those of the Chinese, Tartars,
Persians, and Arabs. <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_194.md) According to
this able writer, primitive India should be considered as a sort of
luminous focus which, concentrating at a very remote epoch the learning
acquired by an earlier people, has reflected it, and has dispersed the
rays upon the neighbouring nations. <span
id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_195.md) She has been the source of Egyptian,
Greek, and Latin theogony; she has furnished the philosophical dogmas
with which the first poets of Thrace and Ionia have adorned the beauties
of Eumolpœia and Epopœia; it is she who has polished the Persians,
Chaldeans, Arabs, and Ethiopians; and who by her numerous colonies has
entertained relations

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

with the Chinese, Japanese, Scandinavians, Celts, Etruscans, and even
with the Peruvians of the other hemisphere. <span
id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_196.md)

If one listens to the discourse of those who have been much inclined to
study the savant language of the Indians, Sanskrit, he will be persuaded
that it is the most perfect language that man has ever spoken. Nothing,
according to them, can surpass its riches, its fertility, its admirable
structure; it is the source of the most poetic conceptions and the
mother of all the dialects which are in use from the Persian Gulf to the
waters of China. <span id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_197.md) It is certain
that if anything can prove to the eyes of savants the maternal rights
that this tongue claims over all the others, it is the astonishing
variety of its poetry: what other peoples possess in detail, it
possesses *in toto*. It is there that Eumolpœia, Epopœia, and Dramatic
Art shine with native *éclat*: it is there that poetry divine and
rational, poetry allegorical and passionate, poetry stirring and even
romantic, find their cradle. There, all forms are admitted, all kinds of
verse received. The *Vedas*, pre-eminently sacred books, are, like the
Koran of Mohammed, written in cadenced prose <span
id="fr_198"></span>[3](#fn_198.md) The *Pouranas*, which contain the
theosophy and philosophy of the Brahmans, their system concerning
Nature, their ideas upon morals and upon natural philosophy, are
composed in philosophical verse not rhymed; they are attributed to
Vyasa, the Orpheus of the Indians. Valmiki, who is their Homer, has
displayed in the *Ramayana* an epopœia magnificent and sublime to the
highest degree; the dramas, which they call Nataks, are, according to
their style, rhymed and not rhymed: Bheret is considered as their
inventor; Kalidasa as their perfecter. <span
id="fr_199"></span>[4](#fn_199.md) The other kinds of poetry are all

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

rhymed; their number is immense; their variety infinite. Nothing equals
the industry and delicacy of the Indian rhymers in this style. The.
Arabs all skilful as they were, the Oscar troubadours whose rhyme was
their sole merit, have never approached their models. <span
id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_200.md) Thus, not only does one find among the
Indians the measured verse of the Greeks and Romans, not only does one
see there rhythms unknown to these two peoples, but one recognizes also
there our rhyme with combinations of which we have no idea.

I ought to make an important observation here: it is, that whereas
India, mistress of Asia, held the sceptre of the earth, she still
recognized only the eumolpœia of the *Vedas* and the *Pouranas*, only
the epopœia of *Maha-Bharata* and the *Ramayana*; her poetry was the
language of the gods and she gave herself the name of *Ponya-Rhoumi*,
Land of Virtues. It was only when a long prosperity had enervated her,
that the love for novelty, the caprice of fashion and perhaps, as it
happened in Greece, the deviation of the theatre, caused her to seek for
beauties foreign to veritable poetry. It is not a rare thing to pass the
point of perfection when one has attained it. The astonishing
flexibility of Sanskrit, the abundance of its final consonants opens a
double means for corruption. Poets multiplied words believing to
multiply ideas; they doubled rhymes; they tripled them in the same verse
believing to increase proportionably its harmony. Their imagination
bending before an inspiring genius became vagabond; they thought to rise
to the sublime, and fell into the bombastic. At last, knowing no longer
how to give emphasis and importance to their extravagant thoughts, they
created words of such length that, in order to contain them, it was
necessary to forge verses of four *cæsuras* of nineteen syllables
each. <span id="fr_201"></span>[2](#fn_201.md)

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

It was, therefore, at the epoch of the decadence of the Indian Empire,
that rhyme usurped poetry. It would be difficult today to say whether it
was an innovation or a simple renovation. However it may be, it is
probable that it passed rapidly from the ruling nation to subject
nations where it was diversely welcomed according to the language and
particular mind of each people.

If one can believe the annals of the Indians, China was one of their
colonies for a long time schismatic and rebellious. <span
id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_202.md) If one can lend faith to the most
ancient tradition of the Chinese, they form from time immemorial a body
of autochthonous people. <span id="fr_203"></span>[2](#fn_203.md) The
discussion of this historic difficulty would be out of place here.
Suffice it to say, that the Chinese having commenced by having rhymed
verses, and preserving by character and by religion, with an inviolable
respect, the ancient usages, have never had but a mediocre poetry,
absolutely foreign to epopœia. <span id="fr_204"></span>[3](#fn_204.md)
Their principal sacred books, called *Kings*, are composed of symbolic
or hieroglyphic characters, forming by groups sorts of tableaux, of
profound and often sublime conception, but bereft of what we would call
eloquence of language. These are mute images, incommunicable by means of
the voice, and which the reader must consider with the eyes and meditate
long upon in order to comprehend them.

The Tartars who reign today in China and who are distinguished from the
others by the epithet of Manchus, although possessors of a formed tongue
whose richness

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

certain authors praise, <span id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_205.md) have not
any kind of poetry as I have already remarked. <span
id="fr_206"></span>[2](#fn_206.md) The other Tartars were hardly more
advanced before being placed by their conquests within reach of the
learning of the vanquished people. The Turks had no alphabetical
characters. The Huns were ignorant even of its existence. The proud
vanquisher of Asia, Genghis Khan did not find, according to the best
historians, a single man among the Mongolians capable of writing his
despatches. The alphabet of fourteen letters that the Uïgurian Tartars
possess, appears to have been given them by the ancient Persians, <span
id="fr_207"></span>[3](#fn_207.md) from whom they also received the little
that they knew of poetry.

These Persians, today imitators of the Arabs, were in very remote times
disciples of the Indians. Their sacred tongue then called Zend, in which
are written the fragments that remain to us of Zoroaster, was a dialect
of Sanskrit. <span id="fr_208"></span>[4](#fn_208.md) These fragments that
we owe to the indefatigable zeal of Anquetil Duperron, appear to be
written, as the Vedas, or as all the sacred books of India, in cadenced
prose. After the *Zend-Avesta*, the most famous book among the Parsees
is the *Boun-Dehesh*, written in Pehlevi, and containing the cosmogony
of Zoroaster. Pehlevi, which is derived from Chaldaic Nabatæan,
indicates a translation, <span id="fr_209"></span>[5](#fn_209.md) and
testifies that Persia had already passed from under the dominion of
India to that of Assyria. But when, thanks to the conquests of Cyrus,
Persia had become free and mistress of Asia, Pehlevi, which recalled its
ancient servitude, was banished from the court by Bahman-Espandiar, whom
we

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

call Artaxerxes Longimanus. <span id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_210.md) The
Parsee replaced it; this last dialect, modified by Greek under the
successors of Alexander, mixed with many Tartar words under the Parthian
kings, polished by the Sassanidæ, usurped at last by the Arabs and
subjected to the intolerant influence of Islamism, had no longer its own
character: it has taken, in the modern Persian, all the movements of the
Arabic, notwithstanding its slight analogy with it <span
id="fr_211"></span>[2](#fn_211.md); following its example, it has
concentrated all the beauties of poetry in rhyme and since then it has
had neither Eumolpœia nor Epopœia.

As to the Arab, no one is ignorant of the degree to which he is a slave
to rhyme. Already, by a sufficiently happy conjecture, a French writer
had made the first use of rhyme in France coincide with the irruption of
the Moors into Europe at the beginning of the eighth century. <span
id="fr_212"></span>[3](#fn_212.md) He has said that Provence had been the
door by which this novelty was introduced into France. However difficult
it may appear of proving rigorously this assertion, lacking monuments,
it cannot, however, be denied that it may be very probable, above all
considering what influence the Arabs exercised upon the sciences and
arts in the south of France after they had penetrated through Spain.
Now, there is no country on earth where the poetry that I have called
romantic has been cultivated with more constancy and success than in
Arabia; rhyme, if she has received it from India, was naturalized there
by long usage, in such a way as to appear to have had birth there. If it
must be said, the Arab tongue seems more apt at receiving it than the
Sanskrit. Rhyme seems more requisite to poetry there, on account of the
great quantity and inflexibility of the monosyllables, which joining
together only with much difficulty to form the numerous and rhythmic
combinations,

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

had need of its assistance to soften their harshness and to supply the
harmony which they lacked.

[Nevertheless](errata.htm#0.md), whatever may be the pretension of Arabia
to the invention of rhyme, and even to that of romantic poetry, one
cannot be prevented, when one possesses without prejudice and to a
certain extent the distinguishing character of the Asiatic languages,
from seeing that there are proofs in the Arabic itself which give
evidence in favour of India. Such is, for example, the word
*Diwan*, <span id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_213.md) by which the Arabs
designate the collection of their ancient poetries. <span
id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_214.md) This word, which is attached to the
Sanskrit expression *Dewa* or *Diwa*, designates all that is divine,
celestial; all that emanates from the Universal Intelligence <span
id="fr_215"></span>[3](#fn_215.md): it is the poetry of the Greeks, the
language of the gods, or the voice of the Universal Being of the
Egyptians and the Phœnicians.

However, the Arabic *Diwan*—that is to say, the poetic collection of
that nation, goes back to most ancient times. One finds in it verses
attributed to the first Hebrew patriarchs and even to Adam <span
id="fr_216"></span>[4](#fn_216.md); for since the introduction of Islamism,
the cosmogony of Moses has become that of the Mussulmans, as it has been
ours since the establishment of Christianity. It is there, in this
*diwan*, that the most authentic traditions are preserved: they are all
in verse and resemble greatly, as to form and doubtless as to substance,
that which the monk of St. André has transmitted to us through the court
of Charlemagne. It is the same chivalrous spirit and the same romantic
fictions. The

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Persian poet
Firdausi appears to have followed similar traditions concerning the
ancient kings of Iran, in his famous poem entitled *Shah-Namah*. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_217.md) The wonders which reign in these
traditions have been transmitted no doubt by the Arabs, with the
artifice of rhyme: both have the same spirit. The protecting fairies of
the knights, the giant persecutors of ladies, the enchanters, the magic,
and all those illusions are the fruits of that brilliant and dreamy
imagination which characterizes the modern Orientals. We have
enthusiastically enjoyed them in the depths of the barbarity where we
were plunged; we have allowed ourselves to be drawn by the charms of
rhyme, like children in the cradle, whom their nurses put to sleep by
the monotonous sound of a lullaby. Escaped from that state of languor,
and struck at last with a gleam of real intelligence, we have compared
Greece and Arabia, the songs of epopœia and those of the ballads; we
have blushed at our choice; we have wished to change it; but owing to
the captivating form always more or less the substance, we have only
succeeded in making mixtures more or less happy, according to the
secondary mode that we follow.

Rhyme, brought into Europe by the Arabs more than a thousand years ago,
spread by degrees among all nations, in such a way that when one wishes
to examine its origin with accuracy, one no longer knows whether it is
indigenous there or exotic. One finds on all sides only rhymed verses.
The Spanish, Portuguese, Italians, French, Germans of all dialects,
Hollanders, Danes, Swedes and Norwegians, all rhyme. <span
id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_218.md) The modern Greeks themselves have
forgotten their ancient rhythm in order to assume our style. <span
id="fr_219"></span>[3](#fn_219.md) If

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

anything could, however, make one doubt that rhyme may be natural to
Europe, it is that ancient Scandinavian, in which are written the
precious fragments which have come down to us concerning the
mythological cult of the Celts, our ancestors, does not rhyme; also it
rises often to the sublimity of Eumolpœia. <span
id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_220.md) This observation, which makes us reject
Arabia, will take us back to India, if we consider that there is
plausible presumption in believing that the Phœnicians and the Egyptians
who had so much intercourse with the Arabs, did not rhyme, since the
sacred book of the Hebrews, the *Sepher*, that we call the *Bible*, and
which appears to have issued from the Egyptian sanctuaries, is written
in cadenced rhyme, as the *Zend-Avesta* of the Parsees and the *Vedas*
of the Indians. <span id="fr_221"></span>[2](#fn_221.md)

The outline that I have just sketched confirms, *Messieurs*, what I have
wished to prove to you and which is the subject of this discourse, the
distinction that should be made between the essence and the form of
poetry, and the reciprocal influence that should be recognized between
these two parts of the science. You have seen that wherever rhyme has
dominated exclusively, as in Asia among the

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Chinese, Arabians,
Persians; as in Europe among all the modern peoples, it has excluded
epopœia and has replaced allegorical genius by the spirit of romantic
fictions; you have seen that wherever eumolpique poetry has wished to
appear, whether moral or rational, theosophical or philosophical, it has
been obliged to have recourse to a particular prose, when the form of
poetry has resisted it, as has happened in China for the *Kings*, in
Persia for the *Zend-Avesta*, in Arabia for the *Koran;* you have seen
that wherever poetry has been preserved purely rhythmical, as in Greece
and with the Romans, it has admitted eumolpœia and epopœia without
mixture; and finally, that wherever the two forms meet each other with
all their modifications, as in India, it gives way in turn to all the
different kinds, intellectual and rational, epic, dramatic, and
romantic.

Now, what Hindustan was for Asia, France should be for Europe. The
French tongue, as the Sanskrit, should tend towards universality; it
should be enriched with all the learning acquired in the past centuries,
so as to transmit it to future generations. Destined to float upon the
*débris* of a hundred different dialects, it ought to be able to save
from the shipwreck of time all their beauties and all their remarkable
productions. Nevertheless, how will it be done, if its poetic forms are
not open to the spirit of all the poetries, if its movement, arrested by
obstacles cannot equal that of the tongues which have preceded it in the
same career? By what means, I ask you, will it succeed to the universal
dominion of Sanskrit, if, dragging always after it the frivolous
jingling of Arabic sounds, it cannot even succeed to the partial
domination of Greek or Latin? Must it be necessary then that it betray
its high destinies, and that the providential decree which founds the
European empire, exempt it from the glory which it promises to the
French name?

I have told you, *Messieurs*, in beginning this discourse, that it was
in the interest of science alone that I entered

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

this career: it is assuredly not by my poor poetic talent that I have
aspired to the honour of occupying your attention; but by a generous
instinct, which, making me ignore many of the considerations which might
have arrested me, has persuaded me that I could be useful. I have dared
to conceive the possibility of composing, in French, eumolpique verse,
which might neither be measured by musical rhythm foreign to our tongue,
nor enchained by rhyme opposed to all intellectual and rational
movement, and which however might have neither the harshness, nor the
discord of that which has been called, up to this time, blank verse.

Many French writers have tried to make verse deprived of rhyme. Some
have sought to imitate the measures of the ancients, others have
satisfied themselves with copying certain moderns who do not rhyme. Each
of them has misunderstood the essential character of his tongue. Vossius
alone appears to have foreseen the principles without developing them,
when he has said that French verse might be considered as having only
one foot. <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_222.md) This is exactly true in
examining rhythm only in itself, and giving to each hemistich the name
of time: but if one considers this one foot, whether hexameter or
pentameter, as formed of two times equal or unequal, it is perceived
that it participates, through its final, in two natures: the one strong
and forceful, that we name masculine; the other soft and languid, that
we call feminine. Therefore, French verse having hut one rhythmic foot,
differs, however, in the style of this foot and can be considered in two
relations. Let us take for example the hexameter verse. The rhythmic
foot which constitutes it is composed of two equal times distinguished
by the cæsura, the last of which is masculine or feminine: Masculine, as
in:

Rome, l’unique objet de mon ressentiment!  
Rome, à qui vient ton bras d’immoler mon amant!

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Feminine, as in:

Rome qui t’a vu naître et que ton cœur adore!  
Rome enfin que je hais parce qu’elle t’honore!

In rhymed verses, such as these I have just cited, two feet of the same
kind are obliged to follow one another on account of the rhyme which
links them; they then form but one whole and, proceeding abreast without
being separated, they injure by their forced mass the rapidity of
expression and flight of thought. If a third foot of the same kind occur
with the other two feet, rhyming together, it would have to rhyme with
them to prevent an insupportable discordance, which is not tolerated; a
fourth or a fifth foot would submit to the same law, so that, if the
poet wished to fill his piece with masculine verses alone, it would be
necessary that he should make them proceed upon a single rhyme, as the
Arabs do today and as our early troubadours did, following their
example. The French poet can vary his rhyme only by varying the style of
his verses and by mingling alternately together the masculine and
feminine finals.

As these two kinds of finals are dissimilar without being opposed, they
may be brought together without the need of rhyming; their meeting, far
from being disagreeable is, on the contrary, only pleasing; two finals
of the same kind, whether masculine or feminine, can never clash without
causing the same sound—chat is, without rhyming; but it is not thus with
the finals of different kinds, since the rhyme is impossible in this
case. So that, to make what I call eumolpique verses, it suffices to
avoid the meeting of finals of the same kind, whose impact necessitates
the rhyme, by making one kind succeed another continually, and opposing
alternately the masculine and feminine, the mingling of which is
irrelevant to eumolpœia. Here is all the mechanism of my verses: they
are fluent as to form; as to the essence which is expedient for
them—that is another thing: for it is rarely encountered.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

Those who have made blank verse in French have spoken justly of it with
the greatest contempt; these verses, miserable as to substance, without
poetic fire, written as the flattest prose, lacking movement and grace,
had, furthermore, the insupportable fault of not recognizing the genius
of the French tongue, by making finals of the same kind clash
constantly, and by not distinguishing that which is called rhyme from
that which repels it.

Now that I have made as clear as possible my motives and my means, there
remains only, *Messieurs*, for me to submit to your judgment the
translation that I have made, in eumolpique verse, of the piece of Greek
poetry which comprises the doctrine of Pythagoras in seventy-one lines
called, *par excellence*, Golden Verses. This piece, venerable by its
antiquity and by the celebrated philosopher whose name it bears,
belonging to eumolpœia, without any mixture of passion, is sufficiently
known to savants so that I need not speak about what concerns its
particular merit. This would mean, moreover, a matter of some
explanations At any rate, I believe it advisable before passing to this
final subject, to give you certain examples of the use of my verses as
applied to epopœia, so that you may judge, since they are in hands as
incapable as mine, what they might become when used by men of superior
genius and talent. I will choose, for this purpose, the exposition and
invocation of the principal epic poems of Europe, in order to have a
fixed subject for comparison. I will translate line by line, and will
imitate, as well as is possible for me, the movement and harmony of the
poet that I may have before me. This labour, which I hope will not be
without some interest for the illustrious academicians whom I am
addressing, will furnish me the occasion of showing by certain
characteristic traits the genius of the language and poetry of the
different modern peoples of Europe; and I will terminate thus the
outline that I have sketched touching the poetic conditions of the
principal nations of the earth.

Heaven, and represented them as demons of the earth. See Anquetil
Duperron, *Vendidad-Sadè*, p. 133, *Boun-Dehesh.*, p. 355. It is thus
that Christianity has changed the sense of the Greek word Δαίμων
(Demon), and rendered it synonymous with the devil; whereas it signified
in its principle, divine spirit and genius.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[83:1](ogv09.htm#fr_220.md) I will give, later on,
a strophe from *Voluspa*, a Scandinavian ode of *eumolpique* style, very
beautiful, and of which I will, perhaps, one day make an entire
translation.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[83:2](ogv09.htm#fr_221.md) It was said long ago
that a great number of rhymed verses were found in the Bible, and
Voltaire even has cited a ridiculous example in his *Dictionnaire
philosophique* (art. RIME): but it seems to me that before concerning
oneself so much as one still does, whether the Hebraic text of the
*Sepher* is in prose or in verse, whether or not one finds there rhymed
verses after the manner of the Arabs, or measured after the manner of
the Greeks, it would be well to observe whether one understands this
text. The language of Moses has been lost entirely for more than two
thousand four hundred years, and unless it be restored with an aptitude,
force, and constancy which is nowadays unusual, I doubt whether it will
be known exactly what the legislator of the Hebrews has said regarding
the principles of the Universe, the origin of the earth, and the birth
and vicissitudes of the beings who people it. These subjects are,
however, worth the pains if one would reflect upon them; I cannot
prevent myself from thinking that it would be more fitting to be
occupied with the meaning of the words, than their arrangements by long
and short syllables, by regular or alternate rhymes, which is of no
importance whatever.
