*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 14. Listen, and in thine heart engrave my words; Keep closed both eye and ear ’gainst prejudice; Of others the example fear; think for thyself.

Lysis continues, in the name of Pythagoras, to trace for the philosopher
the course that he must follow in the first part of his doctrine, which
is the Purification. After having commended to him moderation and
prudence in all things, having exhorted him to be as slow to censure as
to approve, he seeks to put him on guard against prejudices and the
routine of example, which are, in reality, the greatest obstacles that
are encountered by science and truth. This is what Bacon, the
regenerator of philosophy in modern Europe, so keenly felt, as I have
already cited with praise at the opening of this work. This excellent
observer, to whom we owe our freedom from scholastic leading-strings
whose ignorance had stifled for us the name of Aristotle, having formed
the difficult enterprise of disencumbering and, as it were, clearing the
air belonging to the human understanding, in order to put it in a
condition to receive an edifice less barbarous, remarked, that one would
never attain to establishing there the foundation of true science, if
one did not first labour to set aside prejudices. <span
id="fr_414"></span>[c](#fn_413.md) He displayed all his forces against
these formidable enemies of human perfectibility, and if he did not
overthrow them all, at least he indicated them in such a manner as to
make it easier to recognize and destroy them. The prejudices which
obsess the human understanding and which he calls idols, are, according
to him, of four kinds: these are the idols of the tribe; the idols of
the den; the idols of society;

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

and the idols of theories. The first are inherent in human nature; the
second are those of each individual; the third result from the equivocal
definitions attached to words; the fourth and the most numerous are
those that man receives from his teachers and from the doctrines which
are current. <span id="fr_415"></span>[a](#fn_414.md) The last are the most
tenacious and the most difficult to conquer. It seems even impossible
wholly to resist them. The man who aspires to the perilous glory of
improving the human mind, finds himself placed between two formidable
dangers, which, like those of [Scylla](errata.htm#4.md) and Charybdis,
threaten alternately to break his frail bark: upon one is irresistible
routine, upon the other proud innovation. There is danger alike from
both sides. He can save himself only by favour of the golden mean, so
commended by all the sages and so rarely followed even by them.

This golden mean must needs be very difficult to hold in the course of
life, since Kong-Tse himself, who has made it all his study, has lacked
it in the most important part of his doctrine, in that concerning human
perfectibility. Imbued unknowingly with the prejudices of his nation, he
has seen nothing beyond the doctrine of the ancients and has not
believed that anything might be added thereunto! <span
id="fr_416"></span>[b](#fn_415.md) Instead of pushing the mind of the
Chinese forward toward the goal where nature unceasingly tends, which is
the perfection of all things, he has, on the contrary, thrown it
backward and, inspiring it with a fanatical respect for works of the
past, has prevented it from meditating upon anything great for the
future. <span id="fr_417"></span>[c](#fn_416.md) Filial piety itself,
pushed, to excess changed to a blind imitation, has also augmented the
evil. So that the greatest people of the world, the richest in
principles of all kinds, not daring to draw from these same principles
any development, through fear of profaning them,

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

continually on their knees before a sterile antiquity, have remained
stationary, whereas all around is progression; and for nearly four
thousand years have really not advanced a step more towards the
civilization and perfection of the arts and sciences.

The side on which Bacon has departed from the *juste milieu* has been
precisely the opposite from that which prevented Kong-Tse from remaining
there. The Chinese theosophist had been led astray by his excessive
veneration for antiquity and the English philosopher, by his profound
disdain for it. Warned against the doctrine of Aristotle, Bacon has
extended his prejudice to everything that came from the ancients.
Rejecting in a moment the labour of thirty centuries and the fruit of
the meditation of the greatest geniuses, he has wished to admit nothing
beyond what experience could confirm in his eyes. <span
id="fr_418"></span>[a](#fn_417.md) Logic to him has seemed useless for the
invention of the sciences. <span id="fr_419"></span>[b](#fn_418.md) He has
abandoned the syllogism, as an instrument too gross to penetrate the
depths of nature. <span id="fr_420"></span>[c](#fn_419.md) He has thought
that it could be of no avail either in expression of words or in the
ideas which flow from it. <span id="fr_421"></span>[d](#fn_420.md) He has
believed the abstract principles deprived of all foundation; and with
the same hand with which he fights these false ideas he has fought the
results of these principles, in which he has unfortunately found much
less resistance. <span id="fr_422"></span>[e](#fn_421.md) Filled with
contempt for the philosophy of the Greeks, he has denied that it had
produced anything either useful or good <span
id="fr_423"></span>[f](#fn_422.md); so that after having banished the
natural philosophy of Aristotle, which he called a jumble of dialectic
terms, <span id="fr_424"></span>[g](#fn_423.md) he has seen in the
metaphysics of Plato only a dangerous and depraved philosophy, and in
the theosophy of Pythagoras only a gross and shocking
superstition. <span id="fr_425"></span>[h](#fn_424.md) Here indeed is

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

a case of returning again to the idea of Basil, and of exclaiming with
him, that no man is without sin. Kong-Tse has been unquestionably one of
the greatest men who has honoured the earth, and Bacon one of the most
judicious philosophers of Europe; both have, however, committed grave
mistakes whose effect is more or less felt by posterity: the former,
filling the Chinese *literati* with an exaggerated respect for
antiquity, has made of it an immobile and almost inert mass, that
Providence, in order to obtain certain necessary movements, has had to
strike many times with the terrible scourge of revolutions; the latter,
inspiring, on the contrary, a thoughtless contempt for everything that
came from the ancients, demanding the proof of their principles, the
reason for their dogmas, subjecting all to the light of experience, has
broken the scientific body, has deprived it of unity, and has
transformed the assemblage of thinkers into a tumultuous anarchy from
whose irregular movement has sprung enough violent storms. If Bacon had
been able to effect in Europe the same influence that Kong-Tse had
effected in China, he would have drawn philosophy into materialism and
absolute empiricism. Happily the remedy is born of the evil itself. The
lack of unity has taken away all force from the anarchical colossus.
Each supposing to be in the right, no one was. A hundred systems raised
one upon the other clashed and were broken in turn. Experience, invoked
by all parties, has taken all colours and its opposed judgments were
self-destructive.

If, after having called attention to the mistakes of these great men, I
dared to hazard my opinion upon the point where both of them have
failed, I would say that they have confused the principles of the
sciences with their developments; it must be so, by drawing the
principles from the past, as Kong-Tse; by allowing the developments to
act throughout the future, as Bacon. Principles hold to the Necessity of
things; they are immutable in themselves; finite, inaccessible to the
senses, they are proved by reason:

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

their developments proceed from the power of the Will; these
developments are free, indefinite; they affect the senses and are
demonstrated by experience. Never is the development of a principle
finished in the past, as Kong-Tse believed; never is a principle created
in the future, as Bacon imagined. The development of a principle
produces another principle, but always in the past; and as soon as this
new principle is laid down, it is universal and beyond the reach of
experience. Man knows that this principle exists, but he knows not how.
If he knew, he would be able to create it at his pleasure; which does
not belong to his nature.

Man develops, perfects, or depraves, but he creates nothing. The
scientific golden mean commended by Pythagoras, consists therefore, in
seizing the principles of the sciences where they are and developing
them freely without being constrained or driven by any false ideas. As
to that which concerns morals, it is forcibly enough expressed by all
that has preceded.

The man who recognizes his dignity, says Hierocles, is incapable of
being prejudiced or seduced by anything. <span
id="fr_426"></span>[a](#fn_425.md) Temperance and force are the two
incorruptible guardians of the soul: they prevent it from yielding to
the allurements of things pleasing and being frightened by the horrors
of things dreadful. Death suffered in a good cause is illustrious and
glorious.
