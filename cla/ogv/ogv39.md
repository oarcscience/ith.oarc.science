*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 28. If Heaven wills it, thou shalt know that Nature, Alike in everything, is the same in every place.

I have already said that the homogeneity of Nature was, with the unity
of God, one of the greatest secrets of the mysteries. Pythagoras founded
this homogeneity upon the unity of the spirit by which it is penetrated
and from which, according to him, all our souls draw their origin. <span
id="fr_605"></span>[b](#fn_604) This dogma which he had received from
the Chaldeans and from the priests of Egypt was admitted by all the
sages of antiquity, as is proved at great length by Stanley and the
astute Beausobre. <span id="fr_606"></span>[c](#fn_605) These sages
established a harmony, a perfect analogy between heaven and earth, the
intelligible and the sentient, the indivisible substance and the
divisible substance; in such a manner that that which took place in one
of the regions of the Universe or of the modifications of the primordial
Ternary was the exact image of that which took place in the other. This
idea is found very forcibly revealed by the ancient Thoth, called
*Hermes Trismegistus*, <span id="fr_607"></span>[d](#fn_606) by the
Greeks, in the table of Emerald which is attributed to him.

In truth, and without fiction, in truth, in truth, I say to you, that
things inferior are like unto the superior; both unite their invincible
forces to produce one sole thing, the most marvellous of all, and as all
things are emanated by the will of one unique God, thus all things
whatsoever must be engendered by this sole thing,—by a disposition of
Universal nature. <span id="fr_608"></span>[e](#fn_607)

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

I must say, however, that it is upon the homogeneity of Nature that were
founded in the principle all the so-called occult sciences of which the
principal four, relating to the human Quaternary, were Theurgy,
Astrology, Magic, and Chemistry. <span id="fr_609"></span>[a](#fn_608) I
have already spoken of the astrological science, and I have given
sufficient evidence of what I think regarding the ridiculous and petty
ideas concerning it that the moderns have conceived. I will refrain from
speaking of the other three, on account of the prolixities into which
the discussions that they would provoke might lure me. In another work I
will endeavour to show that the principles upon which they were
supported differed greatly from those which superstition and blind
credulity have given them in times of ignorance; and that the sciences
taught to the initiates in the ancient sanctuaries, under the names of
Theurgy, Magic, or Chemistry, differed much from what the vulgar have
understood in later times by the same words.

that this table must have read in Phœnician and not in Greek, quotes it
a little differently from what one reads in the ordinary versions. Voyez
