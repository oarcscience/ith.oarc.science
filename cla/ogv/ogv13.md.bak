### PREPARATION

#### 2. Render to the Immortal Gods the consecrated cult; Guard then thy faith:

Pythagoras, of whom a modern savant, otherwise most estimable, has
rather [thoughtlessly](errata.htm#1.md) reproached with being a fanatical
and superstitious man, <span id="fr_238"></span>[a](#fn_237.md) begins his
teaching, nevertheless, by laying down a principle of universal
tolerance. He commands his disciples to follow the cult established by
the laws, whatever this cult may be, and to adore the gods of their
country, what ever these gods may be; enjoining them only, to guard
afterwards their faith—that is, to remain inwardly faithful to his
doctrine, and never to divulge the mysteries. Lysis, in writing these
opening lines, adroitly conceals herein a double meaning. By the first
he commended, as I have said, tolerance and reserve for the Pythagorean,
and, following the example of the Egyptian priests, established two
doctrines, the one apparent and vulgar, conformable to the law; the
other mysterious and secret, analogous to the faith; by the second
meaning, he reassures the suspicious people of Greece, who, according to
the slanders which were in circulation might have feared that the new
sect would attack the sanctity of their gods. This tolerance on the one
hand, and this reserve on the other, were no more than what they would
be today. The Christian Religion, exclusive and severe, has changed all
our ideas in this respect: by admitting only one sole. doctrine in one
unique church, this religion has necessarily confused tolerance with
indifference or coldness, and reserve with heresy or hypocrisy; but in
the spirit of polytheism these same things take on another colour. A
Christian philosopher could not, without perjuring himself and
committing a frightful impiety, bend the knee in China before
*Kong-Tse*, nor offer incense to *Chang-Ty* nor to *Tien;* he could
neither

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

render, in India, homage to *Krishna*, nor present himself at Benares as
a worshipper of *Vishnu;* he could not even, although recognizing the
same God as the Jews and Mussulmans, take part in their ceremonies, or
what is still more, worship this God with the Arians, the Lutherans, or
Calvinists, if he were a Catholic. This belongs to the very essence of
his cult. A Pythagorean philosopher did not recognize in the least these
formidable barriers, which hem in the nations, as it were, isolate them,
and make them worse than enemies. The gods of the people were in his
eyes the same gods, and his cosmopolitan dogmas condemned no one to
eternal damnation. From one end of the earth to the other he could cause
incense to rise from the altar of the Divinity, under whatever name,
under whatever form it might be worshipped, and render to it the public
cult established by the law. And this is the reason. Polytheism was not
in their opinion what it has become in ours, an impious and gross
idolatry, a cult inspired by the infernal adversary to seduce men and to
claim for itself the honours which are due only to the Divinity; it was
a particularization of the Universal Being, a personification of its
attributes and its faculties. Before Moses, none of the theocratic
legislators had thought it well to present for the adoration of the
people, the Supreme God, unique and uncreated in His unfathomable
universality. The Indian Brahmans, who can be considered as the living
types of all the sages and of all the pontiffs of the world, never
permit themselves, even in this day when their great age has effaced the
traces of their ancient science, to utter the name of God, principle of
All. <span id="fr_239"></span>[a](#fn_238.md) They are content to meditate
upon its essence in silence and to offer sacrifices to its sublimest
emanations. The Chinese sages act the same with regard to the Primal
Cause, that must be neither named nor defined <span
id="fr_240"></span>[b](#fn_239.md); the followers of Zoroaster, who believe
that the two universal

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

principles of good and evil, Ormuzd and Ahriman, emanate from this
ineffable Cause, are content to designate it under the name of
Eternity. <span id="fr_241"></span>[a](#fn_240.md) The Egyptians, so
celebrated for their wisdom, the extent of their learning, and the
multitude of their divine symbols, honoured with silence the God,
principle and source of all things <span
id="fr_242"></span>[b](#fn_241.md); they never spoke of it, regarding it as
inaccessible to all the researches of man; and Orpheus, their disciple,
first author of the brilliant mythology of the Greeks, Orpheus, who
seemed to announce the soul of the World as creator of this same God
from which it emanated, said plainly:

"I never see this Being surrounded with a cloud." <span
id="fr_243"></span>[c](#fn_242.md)

Moses, as I have said, was the first who made a public dogma of the
unity of God, and who divulged what, up to that time had been buried in
the seclusion of the sanctuaries; for the principal tenets of the
mysteries, those upon which reposed all others, were the Unity of God
and the homogeneity of Nature. <span id="fr_244"></span>[d](#fn_243.md) It
is true that Moses, in making this disclosure, permitted no definition,
no reflection, either upon the essence or upon the nature of this unique
Being; this is very remarkable. Before him, in all the known world, and
after him (save in Judea where more than one cloud still darkened the
idea of divine Unity, until the establishment of Christianity), the
Divinity was considered by the theosophists of all nations, under two
relations: primarily as unique, secondarily as infinite; as unique,
preserved under the seal of silence to the contemplation and meditation
of the sages; as infinite, delivered to the veneration and invocation of
the people. Now the unity of God resides in His essence so that the
vulgar can never in any way either

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

conceive or understand. His infinity consists in His perfections, His
faculties, His attributes, of which the vulgar can, according to the
measure of their understanding, grasp some feeble emanations, and draw
nearer to Him by detaching them from the universality—that is, by
particularizing and personifying them. This is the particularization and
the personification which constitutes, as I have said, polytheism. The
mass of gods which result from it, is as infinite as the Divinity itself
whence it had birth. Each nation, each people, each city adopts at its
liking, those of the divine faculties which are best suited to its
character and its requirements. These faculties, represented by
simulacra, become so many particular gods whose variety of names
augments the number still further. Nothing can limit this immense
theogony, since the Primal Cause whence it emanates has not done so. The
vulgar, lured by the objects which strike the senses, can become
idolatrous, and he does ordinarily; he can even distinguish these
objects of his adoration, one from another, and believe that there
really exist as many gods as statues; but the sage, the philosopher, the
most ordinary man of letters does not fall into this error. He knows,
with Plutarch, that different places and names do not make different
gods; that the Greeks and Barbarians, the nations of the North and those
of the South, adore the same Divinity <span
id="fr_245"></span>[a](#fn_244.md); he restores easily that infinity of
attributes to the unity of the essence, and as the honoured remnants of
the ancient Sramanas, the priests of the Burmans, still do today, he
worships God, whatever may be the altar, the temple, and the place where
he finds himself! <span id="fr_246"></span>[b](#fn_245.md)

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

This is what was done by the disciples of Pythagoras, according to the
commandment of their master; they saw in the gods of the nations, the
attributes of the Ineffable Being which were forbidden them to name;
they augmented ostensibly and without the slightest reluctance, the
number of these attributes of which they recognized the Infinite Cause;
they gave homage to the cult consecrated by the law and brought them all
back secretly to the Unity which was the object of their faith.

Burmans, called *Rahans*, but whose generic name is that of *Sramana*,
whence came to them that of Sramaneras, which the ancients gave them,
carry the spirit of tolerance as far as possible. They visit with the
same devotion pagodas, mosques, and churches; never does one see them
being persecuted, nor persecuting others in the cause of religion. The
Brahmans, Mussulmans, and Christians occupy important posts among them
without their being scandalized. They regard all men as brothers.
(*Asiat. Research.*, <span id="page_132">p. 132</span> t. vi., pp.
274-279). The Brahmans are of the same mind. One reads these wonderful
words in the *Bhaghavad Gita:* "A great diversity of cults, similar as
to substance but varying in forms, are manifested by the will of the
Supreme Being. Some follow one cult, others attach themselves to
another: all of these worshippers are purified from their offences by
their particular cult. . . . God is the gift of charity, God is the
offering, God is the fire upon the altar; it is God even, who makes the
sacrifice, and God will be obtained by him who makes God the sole object
of his labours." (*Lect*. iv.)
