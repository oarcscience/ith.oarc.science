### EXAMINATIONS OF THE GOLDEN VERSES: EXPLANATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS

### 1. THE GOLDEN VERSES OF THE PYTHAGOREANS

THE ancients had the habit of comparing with gold all that they deemed
without defects and pre-eminently beautiful: thus, by the *Golden Age*
they understood, the age of virtues and of happiness; and by the *Golden
Verses*, the verses, wherein was concealed the most pure doctrine. <span
id="fr_231"></span>[a](#fn_230.md) They constantly attributed these Verses
to Pythagoras, not that they believed that this philosopher had himself
composed them, but because they knew that his disciple, whose work they
were, had revealed the exact doctrine of his master and had based them
all upon maxims issued from his mouth! <span
id="fr_232"></span>[b](#fn_231.md) This disciple, commendable through his
learning, and especially through his devotion to the precepts of
Pythagoras, was called Lysis. <span id="fr_233"></span>[c](#fn_232.md)
After the death of this philosopher and while his enemies, momentarily
triumphant, had raised at Crotona and at Metaponte that terrible
persecution which cost the lives of so great a number of Pythagoreans,
crushed beneath the *débris* of their burned school, or constrained to
die of hunger in the temple of the Muses, <span
id="fr_234"></span>[d](#fn_233.md) Lysis, happily escaped from these
disasters,

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

retired into Greece, where, wishing to spread the sect of Pythagoras, to
whose principles calumnies had been attached, he felt it necessary to
set up a sort of formulary which would contain the basis of morals and
the principal rules of conduct given by this celebrated man. It is to
this generous movement that we owe the philosophical verses that I have
essayed to translate into French. These verses, called golden for the
reason I have given, contain the sentiments of Pythagoras and are all
that remain to us, really authentic, concerning one of the greatest men
of antiquity. Hierocles, who has transmitted them to us with a long and
masterly Commentary, assures us that they do not contain, as one might
believe, the sentiment of one in particular, but the doctrine of all the
sacred corps of Pythagoreans and the voice of all the assemblies. <span
id="fr_235"></span>[a](#fn_234.md) He adds that there existed a law which
prescribed that each one, every morning upon rising and every evening
upon retiring, should read these verses as the oracles of the
Pythagorean school. One sees, in reality, by many passages from Cicero,
Horace, Seneca, and other writers worthy of belief, that this law was
still vigorously executed in their time. <span
id="fr_236"></span>[b](#fn_235.md) We know by the testimony of Galen in his
treatise on *The Understanding and the Cure of the Maladies of the
Soul*, that he himself read every day, morning and evening, the Verses
of Pythagoras; and that, after having read them, he recited them by
heart. However, I must not neglect to say that Lysis, who is the author
of them, obtained so much celebrity in Greece that he was honoured as
the master and friend of Epaminondas. <span
id="fr_237"></span>[c](#fn_236.md) If his name has not been attached to
this work, it is because at the epoch when he wrote it, the ancient
custom still existed of considering things and not individuals: it was
with the doctrine of Pythagoras that one was concerned, and not with the
talent of Lysis which

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

had made it known. The disciples of a great man had no of her name than
his. All their works were attributed to him. This is an observation
sufficiently important to make and which explains how Vyasa in India,
Hermes in Egypt, Orpheus in Greece, have been the supposed authors of
such a multitude of books that the lives of many men would not even
suffice to read them.

In my translation, I have followed the Greek text, such as is cited at
the head of the Commentary of Hierocles, commentated on by the son of
Casaubon, and interpreted into Latin by J. Curterius; London edition,
1673. This work, like all those which remain to us of the ancients, has
been the subject of a great many critical and grammatical discussions:
in the first place one must before everything else be assured of the
material part. This part is today as authentic and as correct as it is
possible to be, and although there exists still. several different
readings, they are of too little importance for me to dwell upon. It is
not my affair and besides, *chacun doit faire son métier*. That of the
grammarian has ended where it ought to end. For how can man ever expect
to advance if he never is willing to try some new thing which is
offered. I shall not therefore make any criticizing remarks concerning
the text, for I consider this text sufficiently examined; neither will I
make any notes concerning the Commentaries, properly so-called, on these
seventy-one lines, for I think it is sufficient having those of
Hierocles, of Vitus Amerbachius, Theodore Marcilius, Henri Brem, Michel
Neander, Jean Straselius, Guilhaume Diezius, Magnus-Daniel Omeis, André
Dacier, etc. As I stated, I shall make examinations rather than
commentaries, and I will give, regarding the inner meaning of the
Verses, all the explanations that I believe useful for their complete
development.
