### § IV

You recall, *Messieurs*, that wishing, with Chancellor Bacon, to
distinguish the essence and the form of Poetry, I have taken my text
from the works of Plato. It is again from this man, justly called divine
even by his rivals, from the founder of the Academy, that I have
borrowed the germ of my idea. This philosopher compares the effect which
the real poets have upon those who hear them, with the magnetic stone
which not only attracts rings of iron, but communicates to them also the
virtue of attracting other rings. <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116.md)

In order to appreciate well the force of this thought, and to follow all
the inferences, it is necessary to state a truth *de facto*: namely,
that the men destined by Providence to regenerate the world, in whatever
manner it may be, to open any sort of a career, are extremely rare.
Nature, docile to the impulse which she has received of bringing all to
perfection by means of time, elaborates slowly the elements of their
genius, places them at great distances upon the earth, and makes them
appear at epochs very far removed one from the other. It is necessary
that these events, which determine these men toward an end, should be
brought about in advance; that the physical conditions in which they are
born coincide with the inspiration which attends them; and therefore
everything prepares, everything protects, everything serves the
providential design. These men, thus scattered over the earth, come
among nations to form them, to give them laws, to enlighten and to
instruct them. They are the beacon-lights of mankind; these are those to
whom I attribute the first inspiration.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This inspiration
is immediate; it emanates from the first principle of all intelligence,
in the same manner, to use the comparison of Plato, that the magnetic
force which animates the loadstone, emanates from its cause. It is
profoundly hidden from our eyes: it is this which fires the genius of a
theosophist such as Thoth, Orpheus, and Zoroaster; the genius of a
theocrat, such as Krishna, Moses, or Mohammed; the genius of a
philosopher, such as Kong-Tse, Pythagoras, or Socrates; the genius of a
poet, such as Homer or Valmiki; and of a triumphant hero, such as Cyrus,
Alexander, or Napoleon.

Those who follow in the footprints of these primordial men, who allow
themselves to be impressed by their genius, receive what I call the
second inspiration. They can still be great men; for those who assist
them are very great; they can also communicate the inspiration, for it
acts in them with an exuberant force. Let us confine ourselves to the
poetic inspiration and listen to the voice of Plato:

The Muse inspires the poets directly, and these, communicating to others
their enthusiasm, form a chain of inspired men. It is by means of this
chain that the Divinity attracts the souls of men, and moves them at his
pleasure, causing his virtue to pass from link to link, from the first
inspired poet to the last of his readers or his rhapsodists. <span
id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md)

It is by means of this magnetic chain that one can, in another sphere of
movement, explain this truth so well known, that great kings make great
men; it is also in this manner that one can understand how a monarch,
called to found a vast empire, makes his will penetrate all hearts, take
possession of all souls, and propagating his valour more and more,
electrify his army and fill it with a multitude of heroes.

Homer received therefore a first inspiration; he was created to become
the poetic motive of Europe, the principle

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

of a magnetized chain which, appropriating unceasingly new links, was to
cover Europe with its numberless extensions. His first conquests were in
Greece. His verses, carried from city to city by actors known under the
name of rhapsodists, <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md) excited the
keenest enthusiasm; they passed soon from mouth to mouth, fixed the
attention of legislators, were the ornament of the most brilliant
*fêtes*, <span id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_119.md) and became everywhere the
basis of public instruction. <span id="fr_120"></span>[3](#fn_120.md) The
secret flame which they concealed, becoming developed in young souls,
warmed there the particular germ which they possessed, and according to
their divers specie and the fertility of the soil, brought forth many
talents. <span id="fr_121"></span>[4](#fn_121.md) The poets who were found
endowed with a genius vast enough to receive the second inspiration in
its entirety, imitated their model and raised themselves to epopœia.
Antimachus and Dicæogenes are noticeable, the one for his Thebaïs, and
the other for his cyprien verses. <span id="fr_122"></span>[5](#fn_122.md)
Those to whom nature had given passions more gentle than violent, more
touching than vehement, inclinations more rustic than bellicose, whose
souls contained more sensitiveness than elevation, were led to copy
certain isolated groups of this vast tableau, and placing them,
following their tastes, in the palace or in the thatched cottage, caused
accents of joy or of sorrow, the plaints of heroes or the sports of
shepherds to be heard, and thus created elegy, eclogue, or idyl. <span
id="fr_123"></span>[6](#fn_123.md) Others, on the contrary, whose too
vehement enthusiasm shortened the duration of it, whose keen fiery
passions had left little empire for reason, who allowed themselves to be
drawn easily toward the object of which they were momentarily captive,
created the ode, dithyramb, or song, according to the nature of their
genius and the object of their passion. These were more numerous than
all the

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

others together, and the women who were here distinguished, rivalled and
even surpassed the men; Corinna and Myrtis did not yield either to
Stesi\`chorus, <span id="fr_124"></span>[\*](#fn_124.md) or to Pindar;
Sappho and Telesilla effaced Alcæus and Anacreon. <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md)

It is said that the art with which Homer had put into action gods and
men, had opposed heaven and earth, and depicted the combats of the
passions; this art, being joined to the manner in which the rhapsodists
declaimed his poems <span id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_126.md) by alternately
relieving one another, and covering themselves with garments of
different colours adapted to the situation, had insensibly given rise to
dramatic style and to theatrical representation. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[3](#fn_127.md) This, true in a sense. has need of a
distinction: it will serve at the same time to throw light upon what I
am about to say.

One should remember that the intellectual and rational poetry, or
theosophical and philosophical, illustrated by Orpheus and which Homer
had united with the enthusiasm of the passions in order to constitute
epopœia, although

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

separated from the latter, existed none the less. Whereas the disciples
of Homer, or the Homeridæ, <span id="fr_128"></span>[\*](#fn_128.md) spread
themselves abroad and took possession of the laic or profane world, the
religious and learned world was always occupied by the disciples of
Orpheus, called Eumolpidæ. <span id="fr_129"></span>[†](#fn_129.md) The
hierophants and philosophers continued to write as formerly upon
theology and natural philosophy. There appeared from time to time
theogonies and cosmological systems, <span
id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_130.md) dionysiacs, heraclides, <span
id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131.md) oracles, treatises on nature and moral
apologues, which bore no relation to epopœia. The hymns or pæans which
had emanated from the sanctuaries in honour of the Divinity, had in no
wise resembled either the odes or the dithyrambs of the lyric
poets <span id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_132.md): as much as the former were
vehement and passionate, so much the latter affected to be calm and
majestic. There existed therefore, at this epoch, two kinds of poetry,
equally beautiful when they had attained their respective perfection:
Eumolpique Poetry and Epic Poetry: the first, intellectual and rational;
the other, intellectual and passionate.

However, the divine mysteries, hidden from the profane, manifested to
the initiates in the ceremonies and symbolic

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

fables, had not as yet issued from the sanctuaries: it had been nearly a
thousand years since they had been instituted by Orpheus <span
id="fr_133"></span>[\*](#fn_133.md) when suddenly one saw for the first
time certain of these fables and these ceremonies ridiculously
travestied, transpiring among the people and serving them for amusement.
The fêtes of Dionysus, celebrated in the times of vintage, gave place to
this sort of profanation. The grape-gatherers, besmeared with lees,
giving way in the intoxication of wine to an indiscreet enthusiasm,
began to utter aloud from their wagons the allegories that they had
learned in their rural initiations. These allegories, which neither the
actors nor the spectators had comprehended in reality, appeared,
nevertheless, piquant to both through the malicious interpretations
which they gave them. <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134.md) Such were
the feeble beginnings of dramatic art in Greece <span
id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_135.md); there was born the profanation of the
Orphic mysteries, in the same manner that one sees it reborn among us,
by the profanation of the Christian mysteries. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_136.md) But this art was already old in Asia
when it sprang up in Europe. I have already said that there was in the
secret celebration of the mysteries, veritable dramatic representations.
These mystic ceremonies, copied from those which had taken place in the
celebration of the Egyptian mysteries, had been brought into Egypt by
the Indian priests at a very remote epoch when the empire of Hindustan
had extended over this country. This communication, which was made from
one people to another, has been demonstrated to the point of evidence by
the learned researches of the academicians

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

of Calcutta, Jones, Wilford, and Wilkin, <span
id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_137.md) who have proved what Bacon had
previously said in speaking of the Greek traditions, "that it was only a
very light air which, passing by means of an ancient people into the
flutes of Greece, had been modulated by them into sounds more sweet,
more harmonious, and more conformable to the climate and to their
brilliant imagination."

A singular coincidence, *Messieurs*, which will not escape your
sagacity, is that dramatic art, whose origin is lost in India in the
night of time, has likewise had its birth in the mysteries of religion.
It is during the *Ram-Jatra*, a fête celebrated annually in honour of
Rama, the same as Dionysus of the Greeks, or Bacchus of the Latins, that
one still sees theatrical representations which have served as models
for the more regular works that have been made in the course of
time. <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_138.md) These representations, which
run through nearly all the exploits of Rama and through the victory that
this beneficent god gained over Rawhan, the principle of evil, are
mingled with chants and recitations exactly as were those of the ancient
Greeks. You understand, *Messieurs*, that the first efforts of tragedy
were to celebrate the conquests of Bacchus and his triumph, of which
that of Apollo over the serpent Python, celebrated by the Pythian games,
was the emblem. <span id="fr_139"></span>[3](#fn_139.md) Those of the
Indians who appear to have preserved the most ancient traditions, since
the sacred books were written in the Pali language, considered as
anterior to the Sanskrit by some savants, the Burmans, have from time
immemorial recorded the mysteries of Rama in scenic dramas which are
still performed in public on the fête day of this god. <span
id="fr_140"></span>[4](#fn_140.md) I do not consider it amiss to mention
here that the name of Rama, which in Sanskrit signifies

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

that which is dazzling and beautiful, that which is sublime and
protective, has had the same signification in Phœnician, <span
id="fr_141"></span>[\*](#fn_141.md) and that it is from this same name to
which is joined a demonstrative article common to Aramaic, Chaldean, and
Syriac, that the word drama <span id="fr_142"></span>[\*\*](#fn_142.md) is
formed, and which being adopted by the Greek tongue, has passed
afterwards into the Latin tongue and into ours. This word has expressed
an action, because, in truth, it depicts one in the mysteries and
besides its primitive root refers to regular movement in general.

But as my purpose is not to follow at present dramatic art in all its
ramifications and as it suffices me to have indicated clearly the
origin, I return to Greece.

The spectacle of which I have spoken, effect of a Bacchic enthusiasm,
and at first abandoned to the caprice of certain rustic grape-gatherers
whose indiscretions did not appear formidable, struck so forcibly by its
novelty and produced such a marvellous effect upon the people, that it
was not long before certain men of most cultivated minds were seen
desirous of taking part either from liking or from interest. Thespis and
Susarion appeared at the same time and each seized, according to his
character, one the noble and serious side and the other the ridiculous
and amusing side of the mythological fables; dividing thus from its
birth, dramatic

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

art and distinguishing it by two kinds, tragedy and comedy: that is, the
lofty and austere chant, and the joyous and lascivious chant. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143) <span id="fr_144"></span>[\*](#fn_144.md)

In the meantime, the governments, until then quite indifferent to these
rustic amusements, warned that certain liberties permitted by Thespis
were becoming too flagrant, began to see the profanations which had
resulted, and of which the Eumolpidæ had no doubt pointed out the
consequences. <span id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_145.md) They tried to
prevent them, and Solon even made a law regarding this subject <span
id="fr_146"></span>[3](#fn_146.md); but it was too late: the people
attracted in crowds to these representations, all informal as they were,
rendered useless the foresight of the legislator. It was necessary to
yield to the torrent and, being unable to arrest it, to strive at least
to restrain it within just limits. A clear field was left open for the
good that it was able to do, in fertilizing the new ideas, and severe
rules were opposed to check whatever dangers its invasions might have
for religion and for customs. The dramatic writers were permitted to
draw the subject of their pieces from the source of the mysteries, but
it was forbidden them, under penalty of death, to divulge the sense.
Æschylus, first of the dramatic poets, having involuntarily violated
this law, ran the risk of losing his life. <span
id="fr_147"></span>[4](#fn_147.md) Discriminating judges were established
to pronounce upon

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

the excellency of the works offered in the competition, and one was very
careful not to abandon oneself at first to the passionate acclamations
of the people, and the approbations or disapprobations of the maxims
which were therein contained. <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md)
These judges, proficient in the knowledge of music and of poetry, had to
listen in silence until the end, and maintain all in order and decency.
Plato attributes to the desuetude into which this law fell, and to the
absolute dominion which the people assumed over the theatre, the first
decadence of the art and its entire corruption.

Æschylus, whom I have just named, was the true creator of dramatic art.
Strong with the inspiration which he had received from Homer, <span
id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_149.md) he transported into tragedy the style of
epopœia, and animated it with a music grave and simple. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[3](#fn_150.md) Not content with the moral beauties with
which his genius embellished it, he wished that music, painting, and
dancing might lend their aid and contribute to the illusion of the
senses. He caused a theatre to be built where the most ingenious
devices, the most magnificent decorations displayed their magic
effects. <span id="fr_151"></span>[4](#fn_151.md) One saw in the tragedy of
Prometheus, the earth trembling, clouds of dust rising in the air; one
heard the whistling of wind, the crash of thunder; one was dazzled by
the lightnings. <span id="fr_152"></span>[5](#fn_152.md) Old Ocean appeared
upon the waves, and Mercury came from the heights of heaven to announce
the commands of Jupiter. In the tragedy of the Eumenides, these infernal
divinities appeared upon the scene to the number of fifty, clothed in
black robes; blood-stained, the head bristling with serpents, holding in
one hand a torch and in the other a lash. <span
id="fr_153"></span>[6](#fn_153.md) They replied to the shade of
Clytemnestra, who invoked them, by a choir of music so frightful, that a
general terror having struck

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

the assembly, certain of the women experienced premature pains of
confinement. <span id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154.md)

One feels, after this, that Greek tragedy had in its theatrical forms,
much in common with our modern operas; but what eminently distinguishes
it is that, having come forth complete from the depths of the
sanctuaries, it possessed a moral sense which the initiates understood.
This is what put it above anything that we might be able to conceive
today; what gave it an inestimable price. Whereas the vulgar, dazzled
only by the pomp of the spectacle, allured by the beauty of the verse
and the music, enjoyed merely a fleeting gratification, the wise tasted
a pleasure more pure and more durable, by receiving the truth in their
hearts even from the deceitful delusions of the senses. This pleasure
was as much greater as the inspiration of the poet had been more
perfect, and as he had succeeded better in making the allegorical spirit
felt, without betraying the veil which covered it.

Æschylus went further in comprehension of the subject than any of his
successors. His plans were of an extreme simplicity. He deviated little
from the mythological tradition. <span id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_155.md)
All his efforts tended only to give light to their teachings, to
penetrate into their hidden beauties. The characters of his heroes,
strongly drawn, sustained them at heights where Homer had placed them.
He caused terror to pass before them that they might be
frightened. <span id="fr_156"></span>[3](#fn_156.md) His aim was to lead
them to virtue by terror, and to inspire the soul with a force capable
of resisting alike the intoxications of prosperity and the
discouragements of poverty.

Sophocles and Euripides followed closely Æschylus and surpassed him in
certain portions of the art; the first, even triumphed over him in the
eyes of the multitude <span id="fr_157"></span>[4](#fn_157.md); but the

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

small number of sages, faithful to the true principles, regarded him
always as the father of tragedy. <span id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_158.md)
One can admit that Sophocles was more perfect in the conduct of his
plans, in the regularity of his style <span
id="fr_159"></span>[2](#fn_159.md); that Euripides was more natural and
more tender, more skilful in arousing interest, in stirring the
passions <span id="fr_160"></span>[3](#fn_160.md); but these perfections,
resulting from the form, had not been acquired without the very essence
of drama being altered; that is to say, without the allegorical genius
which had presided at the composition of the fables that the poets had
always drawn from the religious mysteries, suffering many deviations,
which rendered it often unrecognizable through the foreign adornments
with which it was burdened. Sophocles and above all Euripides, by
devoting themselves to perfecting the form, really harmed therefore the
principle of the art and hastened its corruption. If the laws which had
at first been promulgated against those who in treating of the tragic
subjects vilified the mysterious sense had been executed, Euripides
would not have been allowed to depict so many heroes degraded by
adversity, so many princesses led astray by love, so many scenes of
shame, of scandal, and of crime <span id="fr_161"></span>[4](#fn_161.md);
but the people, already degraded and bordering upon corruption, allowed
themselves to be drawn along by these dangerous tableaux and hastened
half-way to meet the poisoned cup which was offered to them.

It must candidly be admitted, that it is to the very charm of these
tableaux, to the talent with which Euripides understood how to colour
them, that the decadence of Athenian manners and the first harm done to
the purity of religion must be attributed. The theatre, having become
the school of the passions, and offering to the soul no spiritual
nourishment, opened a door through which doubt, contempt, and derision
for the mysteries, the most sacrilegious audacity,

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

and utter forgetfulness of the Divinity, insinuated themselves even unto
the sanctuaries. Æschylus had represented in his heroes, supernatural
personages <span id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_162.md); Sophocles painted
simple heroes, and Euripides, characters often less than men. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_163.md) Now these personages were, in the eyes
of the people, either children of the gods, or the gods themselves. What
idea could be formed then of their weaknesses, of their crimes, of their
odious or ridiculous conduct, particularly when these weaknesses or
these crimes were no longer represented as allegories from which it was
necessary to seek the meaning, but as historical events or frivolous
plays of the imagination? The people, according to the degree of their
intelligence, became either impious or superstitious; the savants
professed to doubt all, and the influential men, by feigning to believe
all, regarded all parties with an equal indifference. This is exactly
what happened. The mysteries became corrupt because one was accustomed
to regard them as corrupt; and the people became intolerant and
fanatical, each one cringing with fear, lest he be judged what he really
was, namely, impious.

Such was the effect of dramatic art in Greece. This effect, at first
imperceptible, became manifest to the eyes of the sages, when the people
became the dictators of the theatre and ignored the judges named to
pronounce upon the works of the poets; when the poets, jealous of
obtaining the approval of the multitude, consulted its taste rather than
truth, its versatile passions rather than reason, and sacrificed to its
caprices the laws of honesty and excellence. <span
id="fr_164"></span>[3](#fn_164.md)

As soon as tragedy, disparaging the mysteries of the fables had
transformed them into historical facts, it needed only a step to raise
historical facts to the rank of subjects of tragedy. Phrynichus was, it
is said, the first who had

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

this audacity. He produced in the theatre, the *Conquest of
Miletus*. <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_165.md) The people of Athens,
with a whimsicality which is characteristic of them, condemned the poet
to a very heavy fine, for having disobeyed the law and crowned him
because of the tears which they shed at the representation of his work.
But this was not enough, confounding thus reality and allegory; soon,
sacred and profane things were mingled by forging without any kind of
moral aim, subjects wholly false and fantastic. The poet Agathon, who
was the author of this new profanation had been the friend of
Euripides. <span id="fr_166"></span>[2](#fn_166.md) He proved thus that he
knew nothing of the essence of dramatic poetry and makes it doubtful
whether Euripides knew it any better.

Thus, in the space of less than two centuries, tragedy, borne upon the
car of Thespis, elevated by Æschylus to a nobler theatre, carried to the
highest degree of splendour by Sophocles, had already become weakened in
the hands of Euripides, had lost the memory of its celestial origin with
Agathon, and abandoned to the caprices of a populace as imperious as
ignorant, inclined toward a rapid degeneration. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[\*](#fn_167.md) Comedy less reserved did not have a
happier destiny. After having hurled its first darts upon the heroes and
demigods of Greece, having taken possession of certain very unguarded
allegories, to turn even the gods to ridicule <span
id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_168.md); after having derided Prometheus and
Triptolemus, Bacchus and the Bacchantes, after having made sport of
heaven and earth, of the golden age and the seasons <span
id="fr_169"></span>[4](#fn_169.md); it attacked

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

men in general and in particular, ridiculed their absurdities, pursued
their vices, real or imaginary, and delivered them both unsparingly,
without pity, to derision and contempt. <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md) Epicharmus, who gave certain rules to
the indecent farces of Susarion, was followed by Magnes, Cratinus,
Eupolis, and a crowd of other comic poets, until Aristophanes whose
bitter satires no longer finding sufficient influence in certain obscure
ridicules, applied themselves to disparaging science and virtue, and
twenty years beforehand, prepared and envenomed the hemlock by which
Socrates was poisoned. It is true that some time after, Menander tried
to reform this terrible abuse and gave to comedy a form less revolting;
but he was only able to do so by detaching it completely from its
origin, that is to say, by severing it from all that it had preserved,
intellectually and allegorically, and reducing it to the representation
of certain tableaux and certain events of the social life.

In going back, as I have just done, to the origin of poetic science in
order to distinguish first, its essence from its form and afterwards, to
follow its diverse developments, in genus and in kind, I have related
many things and cited a great number of subjects with which you are
familiar; but you will no doubt excuse, *Messieurs*, these numerous
reminiscences and citations, in reflecting that although but little
necessary for you, they were infinitely so for me, since presenting
myself in the lists and wishing to give an added form to this science
which belongs to you, I must prove to you that I have at least studied
it profoundly.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[46:\*](ogv07.htm#fr_124.md) It can be seen that I
have placed in the word Stesi\`chorus, an *accent grave* over the
consonant *c*, and it will be noticed that I have used it thus with
respect to many similar words. It is a habit I have contracted in
writing, so as to distinguish, in this manner, the double consonant ch,
in the foreign words, or in their derivatives, when it should take the
guttural inflexion, in place of the hissing inflexion which we
ordinarily give to it. Thus I accent the *\`c* in *Chio*, *\`chæur*,
*chorus*, *é\`cho*, *\`chlorose*, *\`chiragre*, *\`chronique*, etc.; to
indicate that these words should he pronounced *Khio*, *khœur*,
*khorus*, *ékho*, *khlorose*, *khiragre*, *khronique*, with the aspirate
sound of k, and not with that of the hissing *c*, as in *Chypre*,
*chaume*, *échope*, *chaire*, etc. This accentuation has appeared to me
necessary, especially when one is obliged to transcribe in modern
characters many foreign words which, lacking usage, one knows not, at
first, how to pronounce. It is, after all, a slight innovation in
orthography, which I leave to the decision of the grammarians. I only
say that it will be very difficult for them, without this accent, or any
other sign which might be used, to know how one should pronounce with a
different inflexion, *A\`chaïe* and Achéen; *Achille* and
*A\`chilleïde;* *Achéron* and *a\`chérontique;* *Bac\`chus* and
*bachique*, etc.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[47:\*](ogv07.htm#fr_128.md) The name of Homeridæ,
given at first to all the disciples of Homer, was afterwards usurped by
certain inhabitants of Chios who called themselves his descendants
(Strab., l. xiv.; Isocr., *Hellen. encom*.). Also I should state here
that the name of Homer, Ὅμηρος, was never of Greek origin and has not
signified, as has been said, *blind*. The initial letter Ο is not a
negation, but an article added to the Phœnician word ‏מלא‎ (*mœra*),
which signifies, properly speaking, a centre of light, and figuratively,
a master, a doctor.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[47:†](ogv07.htm#fr_129.md) The surname Eumolpidæ,
given to the hierophants, successors of Orpheus, comes from the word
Εὔμολπος, by which is designated the style of poetry of this divine man.
It signifies the *perfect voice*. It is derived from the Phœnician words
‏מלא‎ (*mola*), perfected, and ‏פאח‎ (*phoh*), mouth, voice, discourse.
The adverb ἔν, which precedes it, expresses whatever is beautiful, holy,
perfect.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[50:\*](ogv07.htm#fr_141.md) Rama is, in Sanskrit,
the name of that which is dazzling, elevated, white, sublime,
protective, beautiful, excellent. This word has exactly the same sense
in the Phœnician ‏רם‎ (*ram*). Its primitive root, which is
universalized by the hémantique letter ‏מ‎ (*m*), is ‏רא‎ (*ra*), which
has reference to the harmonic movement of good, of light, and of sight.
The name of the adversary of Rama, *Rawhan*, is formed from the root
‏רע‎ (*rawh*) which expresses, on the contrary, the disordered movement
of evil and of fire, and which, becoming united with the augmentative
syllable ‏ון‎ (*ôn*), depicts whatever ravages and ruins; this is the
signification which it has in Sanskrit.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[50:\*\*](ogv07.htm#fr_142.md) From the word ‏רמא‎
(*rama*) is formed in Phœnician the word ‏דרמא‎ (*drama*) by the
adjunction of the demonstrative article ‏ד‎ (*d'*); that is to say, a
thing which comes from Rama: an action well ordered, beautiful, sublime,
etc. Notice that the Greek verb δραεῖν, to act, whence is drawn very
inappropriately the word δρᾶμα, is always attached to the same root ‏רא‎
(*ra*) which is that of harmonic movement.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[51:\*](ogv07.htm#fr_144.md) Tragedy, in Greek
τραγῳδία, comes from the words τραχίς, austere, severe, lofty, and ὠδή
chant.

Comedy, in Greek κωμῳδία, is derived from the words κῶμος, joyful,
lascivious, and ὠδή, chant.

It is unnecessary for me to say that the etymologists who have seen in
*tragedy* a song of the goat, because τράγος signifies a goat in Greek,
have misunderstood the simplest laws of etymology. Τράγος signifies a
goat only by metaphor, because of the roughness and heights which this
animal loves to climb; as *caper*, in Latin, holds to the same root as
*caput;* and *chèvre*, in French, to the same root as *chef*, for a
similar reason.
