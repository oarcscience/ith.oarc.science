*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 8. Be sober, diligent, and chaste; avoid all wrath. In public or in secret ne’er permit thou Any evil; and above all else respect thyself.

Pythagoras considered man under three principal modifications, like the
Universe; and this is why he gave to man the name of the microcosm or
the small world. <span id="fr_355"></span>[a](#fn_354.md) Nothing was more
common among the ancient nations than to compare the Universe to a grand
man, and man, to a small Universe. <span id="fr_356"></span>[b](#fn_355.md)
The Universe, considered as a grand and animated All, composed of
intelligence, soul and body, was called Pan or Phanes. <span
id="fr_357"></span>[c](#fn_356) <span id="fr_358"></span>[d](#fn_357.md)
Man, or microcosm, was composed

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

in the same way but in an inverse manner, of body, soul, and
intelligence; and each of these three parts was, in its turn, considered
under three modifications, so that the ternary ruling in the whole ruled
equally in the least of its subdivisions. Each ternary, from that which
embraced Immensity, to that which constituted the weakest individual
was, according to Pythagoras, included in an absolute or relative Unity,
and formed thus, as I have already said, the Quaternary or Sacred Tetrad
of the Pythagoreans. This Quaternary was universal or particular.
Pythagoras was not, however, the inventor of this doctrine: it was
spread from China to the depths of Scandinavia. <span
id="fr_359"></span>[a](#fn_358.md) One finds it likewise expressed in the
oracles of Zoroaster. <span id="fr_360"></span>[b](#fn_359.md)

In the Universe a Ternary shines forth,  
And the Monad is its principle.

Thus, according to this doctrine, Man, considered as a relative unity
contained in the absolute Unity of the Grand All, presents himself as
the universal ternary, under three principal modifications, of body,
soul, and spirit or intelligence. The soul, considered as the seat of
the passions, is presented in its turn, under the three faculties of the
rational, irascible or appetent soul. Now, in the opinion of Pythagoras,
the vice of the appetent faculty of the soul is intemperance or avarice;
that of the irascible faculty is cowardice; and that of the rational
faculty is folly. The vice which reaches these three faculties is
injustice. In order to avoid these vices, the philosopher commends four
principal virtues to his disciples: temperance for the appetent faculty,
courage for the irascible faculty, prudence for the rational faculty,
and for these three faculties together,

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

justice, which he regards as the most perfect virtue of the soul. <span
id="fr_361"></span>[a](#fn_360.md) I say the soul, because the body and the
intelligence, being equally developed by means of three faculties
instinctive or spiritual, as well as the soul, were susceptible of the
vices and the virtues which were peculiar to them.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[161:d](ogv19.htm#fr_358.md) Pan, in Greek πᾶν,
signifies the All, and Phanes is derived from the Phœnician word ‏אנש‎
(*ânesh*), man, preceded by the emphatic article ‏פ‎ (*ph*). It must be
observed that these two names spring from the same root ‏אן‎ (*ân*),
which, figuratively, expresses the sphere of activity, and literally,
the limitation of the being, its body, its capacity. Hence ‏אני‎
(*âni*), me, and ‏אניה‎ (*aniha*), a vessel.
