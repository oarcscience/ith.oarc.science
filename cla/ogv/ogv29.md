*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at

### 18. Neglect not thy health . . .

I had at first the intention of making here some allusion to the manner
in which Pythagoras and the ancient sages considered medicine; and I had
wished to reveal their principles,

quite different from those of the moderns; but I have realized that an
object so important requires developments that this work would not allow
and I have left them for a time more opportune, and for a work more
suitable. Moreover the line of Lysis has no need of explanation; it is
clear. This philosopher commends each one to guard his health, to keep
it by temperance and moderation, and if it becomes impaired, to put
himself in condition of not confiding to another the care of its
re-establishment. This precept was sufficiently understood by the
ancients for it to have become a sort of proverb.

The Emperor Tiberius, who made it a rule of conduct, said that a man of
thirty years or more who called or even consulted a physician was an
ignoramus. <span id="fr_464"></span>[a](#fn_463.md) It is true that
Tiberius did not add to the precept the exercise of the temperance that
Lysis did not forget to commend in the following lines, also he lived
only seventy-eight years, notwithstanding the strength of his
constitution promised him a much longer life. Hippocrates of Cos, the
father of medicine in Greece and strongly attached to the doctrine of
Pythagoras, lived one hundred and four years; Xenophile, Apollonius,
Tyanæus, Demonax, and many other Pythagorean philosophers lived to one
hundred and six and one-hundred and ten years; and Pythagoras himself,
although violently persecuted towards the end of his life, attained to
nearly ninety-nine years according to some and even to the century mark
according to others. <span id="fr_465"></span>[b](#fn_464.md)
