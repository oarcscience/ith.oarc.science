### PERFECTION

### 22. Let not sleep e’er close thy tired eyes, Without thou ask thyself; What have I omitted, and what done?

Lysis, after having indicated the route by which Pythagoras conducted
his disciples to virtue, goes on to teach them the use that this
philosopher wished them to make of this celestial gift, once they had
mastered it. Up to this point it is confined in the purgative part of
the doctrine of his teacher; he now passes to the unitive part, that is
to say, to that which has as object the uniting of man to the Divinity,
by rendering him more and more like unto the model of all perfection and
of all wisdom, which is God. The sole instrument capable of operating
this union has been placed at his disposition by means of the good usage
that he has made of his will: it is virtue which must serve him at
present to attain truth. Now, Truth is the ultimate goal of perfection:
there is nothing beyond it and nothing this side of it but error; light
springs from it; it is the soul of God, according to Pythagoras, <span
id="fr_479"></span>[a](#fn_478.md) and God himself, according to the
legislator of the Indians. <span id="fr_480"></span>[b](#fn_479.md)

The first precept that Pythagoras gave to his disciples on entering the
course of perfection tended to turn their thoughts upon themselves, to
bring them to interrogate their actions, their thoughts, their
discourse, to question the motives, to reflect in short upon their
exterior movements and seek thus to know themselves. Knowledge of self
was the most important knowledge of al(, that which must conduct them to
all others. I will not weary my readers by adding anything to what I
have already said pertaining to the importance of this knowledge, and
the extreme value set upon it by the ancients. They know unquestionably

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

that the morals of Socrates and the philosophy of Plato were only the
development of it and that an inscription in the temple of Greece, that
of Delphi, commended it, after that of the golden mean, as the very
teaching of the God whom they worshipped there <span
id="fr_481"></span>[a](#fn_480.md): *Nothing in excess, and know Thyself*,
contained in few words the doctrine of the sages, and presented for
their meditation the principles upon which reposed virtue and wisdom
which is its consequence. Nothing further was necessary to electrify the
soul of Heraclitus and to develop the germs of genius, which until the
moment when he read these two sentences were buried in a cold inertia.

I will not pause therefore to prove the necessity of a knowledge without
which all other is but doubt and presumption. I will only examine, in a
brief digression, if this knowledge is possible. Plato, as I have said,
made the whole edifice of his doctrine rest upon it; he taught,
according to Socrates, that ignorance of one’s self involves all
ignorance, all mistakes, all vices, and all misfortunes; whereas
knowledge of one’s self, on the contrary, draws all virtue and all
goodness <span id="fr_482"></span>[b](#fn_481.md): so that it cannot be
doubted that this knowledge might be considered possible, since its
impossibility merely questioned would render its system null and void.
However, as Socrates had said that he knew nothing, in order to
distinguish himself from the sophists of his day who pretended to know
everything; as Plato had constantly used in his teachings that sort of
dialectic which, proceeding toward truth by doubt, consists in defining
things for what they are, knowing their essence, distinguishing those
which are real from those which are only illusory; and above all as the
favourite maxim of these two philosophers had been that it was necessary
to renounce all manner of prejudices, not pretending to know that of
which one is ignorant, and giving assent only to clear and evident
truths; it came to

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

pass that the disciples of these great men, having lost sight of the
real spirit of their doctrine, took the means for the end; and imagining
that the perfection of wisdom was in the doubt which leads to it,
established as fundamental maxim, that the wise man ought neither to
affirm nor deny anything; but to hold his assent suspended between the
pro and *con* of each thing. <span id="fr_483"></span>[a](#fn_482.md)
Arcesilaus, who declared himself the chief of this revolution, was a man
of vast intellect, endowed with much physical and moral means, an
imposing presence, and very eloquent, <span
id="fr_484"></span>[b](#fn_483.md) but imbued with that secret terror which
prevents concentrating upon the things that one regards as sacred and
forbidden; audacious and almost impious to all outward appearance, he
was, in reality, timid and superstitious. <span
id="fr_485"></span>[c](#fn_484.md) Impressed with the inadequacy of his
researches to discover the certainty of certain principles, his vanity
had persuaded him that this certainty was undiscoverable, since he,
Arcesilaus, did not find it; and his superstition acting in accord with
his vanity, he finally believed that the ignorance of man is an effect
of the will of God; and that, according to the meaning of a passage from
Hesiod that he cited unceasingly, the Divinity has spread an
impenetrable veil between it and the human understanding. <span
id="fr_486"></span>[d](#fn_485.md) Also he named the effect of this
ignorance, *Acatalepsy*, that is to say incomprehensibility, or
impossibility to raise the veil. <span id="fr_487"></span>[e](#fn_486.md)
His disciples in great numbers adopted this incomprehensibility and
applied it to all sorts of subjects; now denying, then affirming the
same thing; placing a principle, and overthrowing it the next moment;
becoming entangled themselves in captious arguments in order to prove
that they knew nothing, and making for themselves the calamitous glory
of ignoring

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

good and evil, and of being unable to distinguish virtue from
vice. <span id="fr_488"></span>[a](#fn_487.md) Dismal effect of an early
error! Arcesilaus became the convincing proof of what I have repeated
touching the golden mean and the similitude of extremes: once having
left the path of truth, he became through weakness and through
superstition the head of a crowd of audacious atheists, who, after
having called in question the principles upon which logic and morals
repose, placed there those of religion and overthrew them. Vainly he
essayed to arrest the movement of which he had been the cause by
establishing two doctrines: the one public, wherein he taught
skepticism; the other secret, wherein he maintained dogmatism <span
id="fr_489"></span>[b](#fn_488.md): the time was no longer favourable for
this distinction. All that he gained was to let another usurp the glory
and to give his name to the new sect of doubters. It was Pyrrho who had
this honour. This man, of a character as firm as impassive, to whom
living or dying was a matter of indifference, who preferred nothing to
something, whom a precipice opening beneath his feet would be unable to
swerve from his path, gathered under his colours all those who made a
philosophical profession of doubting everything, of recognizing nowhere
the character of truth, and he gave them a sort of doctrine wherein
wisdom was placed in the most complete uncertainty, felicity in the most
absolute inertia, and genius in the art of stifling all kinds of genius
by the accumulation of contradictory reasonings. <span
id="fr_490"></span>[c](#fn_489.md) Pyrrho had much contempt for men, as was
obvious from the doctrine which he gave them. He had constantly on his
lips this

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

line of Homer: "Even as are the generations of leaves such are those
likewise of men." <span id="fr_491"></span>[a](#fn_490.md)

I pause a moment here, in order that the reader may observe, that
although the thought of Hesiod, concerning the veil that the gods had
spread between them and men, and which gave rise to Arcesilaus
establishing his acatalepsy, had originated in India, <span
id="fr_492"></span>[b](#fn_491.md) it had never had the same results there;
and this, because the Brahmans, in teaching that this veil existed and
that it even bewildered the vulgar by a series of illusory phenomena,
have never said that it was impossible to raise it; because this might
have been an attack on the power of the will of man and its
perfectibility, to which they put no limit. We shall see further on that
such was also the idea of Pythagoras. Let us return to the Skeptics.

The writer to whom we owe a comparative history of the systems of
philosophy, written with thought and impartiality, has felt keenly that
skepticism ought to be considered under two relations: as skepticism of
criticism and reform, necessary to correct the presumption of the human
mind and to destroy its prejudices; as skepticism absolute and
determined, which confounds in a common proscription both truth and
error. <span id="fr_493"></span>[c](#fn_492.md) The first, of which
Socrates gave the example, and which Bacon and Descartes have revived,
is a sort of intellectual remedy that Providence prepares for healing
one of the most fatal maladies of the human mind, that kind of
presumptuous ignorance which makes one believe that he knows that which
he does not know: the second, which is only the excess and abuse of the
first, is this same remedy transformed into poison by an

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

aberration of the human reason which transports it beyond the
circumstances which invoke its action, and employs it to devour itself
and to exhaust in their source all the causes which coöperate in the
progress of human understanding. <span id="fr_494"></span>[a](#fn_493.md)
Arcesilaus was the first to introduce it into the Academy by
exaggerating the maxims of Socrates, and Pyrrho made a special system of
destruction in it, under the name of *Pyrrhonism*. This system, welcomed
in Greece, soon infected it with its venom, notwithstanding the vigorous
resistance of Zeno the Stoic, whom Providence had raised up to oppose
its ravages. <span id="fr_495"></span>[b](#fn_494.md) Carried to Rome by
Carneades, the head of the third academy, it alarmed with its maxims
subversive of public morals, Cato the Censor, who confounding it with
philosophy conceived for it an implacable hatred. <span
id="fr_496"></span>[c](#fn_495.md) This rigid republican, hearing Carneades
speak against justice, denying the existence of virtues, attacking the
Divine Providence, and questioning the fundamental verities of religion,
held in contempt a science which could bring forth such arguments. <span
id="fr_497"></span>[d](#fn_496.md) He urged the return of the Greek
philosophy, so that the Roman youth might not be imbued with its errors;
but the evil was done. The destructive germs that Carneades had left,
fermented secretly in the heart of the State, developed under the first
favourable conditions, increased and produced at last that formidable
colossus, which, after taking possession of the public mind, having
obscured the most enlightened ideas of good and evil, annihilated
religion, and delivered the Republic to disorder, civil wars, and
destruction; and raising itself again

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

with the Roman Empire, withering the principles of the life it had
received, necessitated the institution of a new cult and thus was
exposed to the incursion of foreign errors and the arms of the
barbarians. This colossus, victim of its own fury, after having torn and
devoured itself was buried beneath the shams that it had heaped up;
Ignorance seated upon its *débris* governed Europe, until Bacon and
Descartes came and resuscitating, as much as was possible for them the
Socratic skepticism, endeavoured by its means to turn minds toward the
research of truth. But they might not have done so well, had they not
also awakened certain remnants of Pyrrhonic skepticism, which, being
sustained with their passions and their prejudices, soon resulted in
bewildering their disciples. This new skepticism, naïve in Montaigne,
dogmatic in Hobbes, disguised in Locke, masterly in Bayle, paradoxical
but seductive in the greater number of the eighteenth-century writers,
hidden now beneath the surface of what is called Experimental
philosophy, lures the mind on toward a sort of empirical routine, and
unceasingly denying the past, discouraging the future, aims by all kinds
of means to retard the progress of the human mind. It is no more even
the character of truth; and the proof of this character that the modern
skeptics demand *ad infinitum*, <span id="fr_498"></span>[a](#fn_497.md) is
the demonstration of the very possibility of understanding this
character and of proving it: a new subtlety that they have deduced from
the unfruitful efforts that certain thinkers have made recently in
Germany, to give to the possibility of the knowledge of self, a basis
which they have not given.

I will relate in my next Examination, what has hindered these savants
from finding this basis. I must, before terminating this one, show to my
readers how I believe one can distinguish the two kinds of skepticism of
which I have

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

just spoken. A simple question put to a skeptic philosopher will
indicate whether he belongs to the school of Socrates or Pyrrho. He must
before entering into any discussion reply clearly to this demand: Do you
admit of any difference whatever between that which is and that which is
not? If the skeptic belongs to the school of Socrates, he will
necessarily admit a difference and he will explain it, which will make
him recognized at once. If on the contrary, he belongs to that of
Pyrrho, he will respond in one of three ways: either that he admits a
difference, or that he admits none, or that he does not know whether one
exists. If he admits it without explaining it, he is beaten; if he does
not admit it, he falls into absurdity; if he pretends not to distinguish
it, he becomes foolish and ridiculous.

He is beaten, if he admits a difference between that which is and that
which is not; because that difference, admitted, proves the existence of
being; the existence of being proves that of the skeptic who replies;
and that existence proved, proves all the others, whether one considers
them in him, or outside of him, which is the same thing for the moment.

He falls into absurdity, if he does not admit any difference between
that which is and that which is not, for then one can prove to him that
1 is equal to 0, and that the part is as great as the whole.

He becomes foolish and ridiculous, if he dares to say that he does not
know whether a difference really exists between that which is, and that
which is not; for then one asks him what he did at the age of six
months, at one year, two years, two weeks ago, yesterday? Whatever he
replies, he will become the object of ridicule.

Behold the Pyrrhonian beaten, that is to say, the one who professes to
doubt everything; since a single acknowledged difference bringing him
irresistibly to a certainty, and since one certainty militates against
all the others, there is no further doubt; and since, doubting no
further, it is

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

only a question then of knowing what he ought, or ought not to doubt:
this is the true character of the skeptic of the Socratic School.
