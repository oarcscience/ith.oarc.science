*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 32. For few know happiness: playthings of the passions, Hither, thither tossed by adverse waves, Upon a shoreless sea, they blinded roll, Unable to resist or to the tempest yield.

Lysis shows in these lines what are the greatest obstacles to the
happiness of man. They are the passions: not the passions in themselves,
but the evil effects that they produce by the disordered movement that
the understanding allows them to take. It is to this that the attention
must be directed so that one should not fall into the error of the
Stoics. Pythagoras, as I have said, did not command his disciples to
destroy their passions, but to moderate their ardour, and to guide them
well. "The passions," said this philosopher, "are given to be aids to
reason; it is necessary that they be its servants and not its masters."
This is a truth that the Platonists and even the Peripatetics have
recognized, by the evidence of Hierocles. <span
id="fr_630"></span>[c](#fn_629.md) Thus Pythagoras regarded the passions as
instruments of which the understanding makes use in raising the
intellectual edifice. A man utterly deprived of them would resemble a
mass inert and immovable in the course of life; it is true that he might
be able not to become depraved, but then he could not enjoy his noblest
advantage, which is perfectibility. Reason is established in the
understanding to hold sway over the passions; it must

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

command them with absolute sovereignty, and make them tend towards the
end that wisdom indicates. If it should not recognize the laws that
intelligence gives it, and if, presumptuously, it wishes, instead of
acting according to given principles, to lay down principles itself, it
falls into excess, and makes man superstitious or skeptic, fanatic or
atheist; if, on the contrary, it receives laws from the passions that it
ought to rule, and if weak it allows itself to be subjugated by them, it
falls into error and renders man stupid or mad, brutish in vice, or
audacious in crime. There are no true reasonings except those admitted
by wisdom; the false reasonings must be considered as the cries of an
insensate soul, given over to the movements of an anarchical reason
which the passions confuse and blind. <span
id="fr_631"></span>[a](#fn_630.md)

Pythagoras considered man as holding the mean between things
intellectual and sentient, the lowest of the superior beings and the
highest of the inferior, free to move either toward the heights or the
depths, by means of his passions, which bring into action the ascending
or descending movement that his will possesses with potentiality;
sometimes being united with the immortals and, through his return to
virtue, recovering the lot which is his own, and other times plunging
again into mortal kind and through transgression of the divine laws
finding himself fallen from his dignity! <span
id="fr_632"></span>[b](#fn_631.md) This opinion, which had been that of all
the sages who had preceded Pythagoras, has been that of all the sages
who have followed him, even of those among the Christian theosophists
whose religious prejudices have removed them farthest from his doctrine.
I shall not stop to give the proofs of its antiquity; they are to be
found everywhere, and would be superfluous. Thomas Burnet, having vainly
sought for the origin without being able to discover it, decided that it
was necessary that it should descend from heaven. <span
id="fr_633"></span>[c](#fn_632.md) It is

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

certain that one can only with difficulty explain how a man without
erudition, like Boehme, never having received this opinion from anyone,
has been able to explain it so clearly. "When one sees man existing,"
says this theosophist, "one can say: Here all Eternity is manifested in
one image." <span id="fr_634"></span>[a](#fn_633.md)

The abode of this being is an intermediate point between heaven and
hell, love and anger; that, of the things to which he is attached,
becomes his kind. . . . If he inclines toward the celestial nature, he
assumes a celestial form, and the human form becomes infernal if he
inclines toward hell; for as the mind is, so is the body. In whatever
way the mind projects itself, it shadows forth its body with a similar
form and a similar source. <span id="fr_635"></span>[b](#fn_634.md)

It is upon this principle, which one finds still everywhere diversely
expressed, that the dogma of the transmigration of souls is founded.
This dogma, explained in the ancient mysteries, <span
id="fr_636"></span>[c](#fn_635.md) and received by all peoples, <span
id="fr_637"></span>[d](#fn_636.md) has been to such an extent disfigured in
what the moderns have called *Metempsychosis*, that it would be
necessary to exceed considerably the limits of these Examinations in
order to give an explanation which could be understood. Later I will
endeavour to expose my sentiment upon this mystery, when I treat of
Theurgy and other occult sciences to which it is allied.
