*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 13. Even as Truth, does Error have its lovers; With prudence the Philosopher approves or blames; If Error triumph, he departs and waits.

It is sufficiently known that Pythagoras was the first who used the word
Philosopher to designate *a friend of wisdom*. <span
id="fr_399"></span>[b](#fn_398) Before him, the word *Sophos*, sage, was
used. It is therefore with intention that I have made it enter into my
translation, although it may not be literally in the text. The portrayal
that Lysis gives of the philosopher represents everything in moderation
and in that just mean, where the celebrated Kong-Tse placed also the
perfection of the sage. <span id="fr_400"></span>[c](#fn_399) He
commended to him tolerance for the opinions of others, instilling in him
that, as truth and error have likewise their followers, one must not be
flattered into thinking that one can enlighten all men, nor bring them
to accept the same sentiments and to profess the same doctrine.
Pythagoras had, following his custom, expressed these same ideas by
symbolic phrases: "Exceed not the balance," he had said, stir not the
fire with the sword," "all materials are not fitting to make a statue of
Mercury." That is to say, avoid all excess; depart not from the golden
mean which is the appanage of the philosopher; propagate not your
doctrine by violent means; use not the sword in the cause of God and the
truth; confide not science to a corrupt soul; or as Jesus forcibly said:
"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
before swine" <span id="fr_401"></span>[d](#fn_400); for all men

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

are not equally fitted to receive science, to become models of wisdom,
nor to reflect the image of God.

Pythagoras, it must be said, had not always entertained these
sentiments. While he was young and while he still burned unconsciously
with the fire of passions, he abandoned himself to a blind and vehement
zeal. An excess of enthusiasm and of divine love had thrown him into
intolerance and perhaps he would have become persecutor, if, like
Mohammed, he had had the weapons at hand. An incident opened his eyes.
As he had contracted the habit of treating his disciples very severely,
and as he generally censured men for their vices with much asperity, it
happened one day that a youth, whose mistakes he had publicly exposed
and whom he had upbraided with bitterest reproaches, conceived such
despair that he killed himself. The philosopher never thought of this
evil of which he had been the cause without violent grief; he meditated
deeply, and made from this incident reflections which served him the
remainder of his life. He realized, as he energetically expressed it,
that one must not stir the fire with the sword. One can, in this regard,
compare him with Kong-Tse and Socrates. The other theosophists have not
always shown the same moderation. Krishna, the most tolerant among them
had nevertheless said, abandoning himself to thoughtless enthusiasm:
"Wisdom consists in being wholly for Me . . . in freedom from love of
self . . . in loosening all bonds of attachment for one’s children,
wife, and home . . . in rendering to God alone a steadfast cult . . .
disdaining and fleeing from the society of men" <span
id="fr_402"></span>[a](#fn_401): words remarkable for the connection
that they have with those of Jesus: "If any man come to me and hate not
his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and
sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple." <span
id="fr_403"></span>[b](#fn_402) Zoroaster seemed to authorize
persecution, saying in an outburst of indignation: "He who does evil,
destroy him; rise up against

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

all those who are cruel. . . . Smite with strength the proud Turanian
who afflicts and torments the just." <span
id="fr_404"></span>[a](#fn_403) One knows to what pitch of wrath Moses
was kindled against the Midianites and the other peoples who resisted
him, <span id="fr_405"></span>[b](#fn_404) notwithstanding that he had
announced, in a calmer moment, the God of Israel as a God merciful and
gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth. <span
id="fr_406"></span>[c](#fn_405) Mohammed, as passionate as Moses, and
strongly resembling the legislator of the Hebrews by his ability and
firmness, has fallen into the same excess. He has often depicted, as
cruel and inexorable, this same God whom he invokes at the head of all
of his writings, as very good, very just, and very clement. <span
id="fr_407"></span>[d](#fn_406) This proves how rare a thing it is to
remain in the golden mean so commended by Kong-Tse and Pythagoras, how
difficult it is for any pupil to resist the lure of the passions to
stifle utterly their voice, in order to hear only the voice of the
divine inspiration. Reflecting upon the discrepancies of the great men
whom I have just cited, one cannot refrain from thinking with Basil,
that, in effect, there are no men on earth veritably wise and without
sin <span id="fr_408"></span>[e](#fn_407); above all when one considers
that Jesus expressed himself in the same details as Krishna, Zoroaster,
and Moses; and that he who had exhorted us in one passage to love our
enemies, to do good to those who hate us, and to pray even for those who
persecute and calumniate us, <span id="fr_409"></span>[f](#fn_408)
menaces with fire from heaven the cities that recognize him not, <span
id="fr_410"></span>[g](#fn_409) and elsewhere it is written: "Do not
think that I came to send peace upon earth: I came not to send peace,
but the sword" <span id="fr_411"></span>[h](#fn_410); "For there shall
be from henceforth five in one house divided: three against two, and two
against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son
against the father,

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the
mother." <span id="fr_412"></span>[a](#fn_411) "He that is not with me,
is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth." <span
id="fr_413"></span>[b](#fn_412)
