*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 27. Instructed by them, naught shall then deceive thee; Of diverse beings thou shalt sound the essence; And thou shalt know the principle and end of All.

That is to say, that the true disciple of Pythagoras, placed *en
rapport* with the gods through contemplation, arrived at the highest
degree of perfection, called in the mysteries, autopsy; saw fall before
him the false veil which until then had hidden Truth, and contemplated
Nature in its remotest sources. It is necessary, in order to attain to
this sublime degree, that the intelligence, penetrated by the divine ray
of inspiration, should fill the understanding

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

with a light intense enough to dissipate all the illusions of the
senses, to exalt the soul and release it wholly from things material.
Thus it was explained by Socrates and Plato. <span
id="fr_584"></span>[a](#fn_583.md) These philosophers and their numerous
disciples put no limit to the advantages of autopsy, or theophany, as
they sometimes named this highest degree of the telestic science. They
believed that the contemplation of God could be carried so far during
this same life, that the soul became not only united to this Being of
beings, but that it was mingled and blended with it. Plotinus boasted
having experienced the joy of this beatific vision four times, according
to Porphyry, who himself claimed to have been honoured with it at the
age of sixty-eight <span id="fr_585"></span>[b](#fn_584.md). The great aim
of the mysteries was to teach the initiates the possibility of this
union of man with God, and to indicate to them the means. All
initiations, all mythological doctrines, tended only to alleviate the
soul of the weight of material things, to purify it, so that, desirous
of spiritual welfare, and being projected beyond the circle of
generations, it could rise to the source of its existence. <span
id="fr_586"></span>[c](#fn_585.md) If one examines carefully the different
cults which still dominate upon earth, one will see that they have not
been animated by any other spirit. The knowledge of the Being of beings
has been offered everywhere as the aim of wisdom; its similitude, as the
crown of perfection; and its enjoyment, as the object of all desires and
the goal of all efforts. The enumeration of its infinite faculties has
varied; but when one has dared fix one’s attention upon the unity of its
essence, one has always defined it as has Pythagoras: the principle and
the end of all things.

The Spirit whence proceed the created beings \[say the Brahmans\], by
which they live after being emanated from it,

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

toward which they aspire, and in which they are finally absorbed, this
Spirit is that, to the knowledge of which thou shouldst aspire, the
Great Being. <span id="fr_587"></span>[a](#fn_586.md)—The Universe is one
of its forms. <span id="fr_588"></span>[b](#fn_587.md) —It is the Being of
beings: without form, without quality, without passion; immense,
incomprehensible, infinite, indivisible, [incorporeal](errata.htm#5.md),
irresistible: no intelligence can conceive of its operations and its
will suffices to move all intelligences. <span
id="fr_589"></span>[c](#fn_588.md)—It is the Truth and the Science which
never perish. <span id="fr_590"></span>[d](#fn_589.md)—Its wisdom, its
power, and its plan, are as an immense and limitless sea which no being
is in condition either to traverse or to fathom. There is no other God
than it. The Universe is filled with its immensity. It is the principle
of all things without having principles. <span
id="fr_591"></span>[e](#fn_590.md) God is one, <span
id="fr_592"></span>[f](#fn_591.md) eternal, like unto a perfect sphere
which has neither beginning nor end. He rules and governs all that
exists by a general providence, resultant of fixed and determined
principles. Man ought not to seek to penetrate the nature or the essence
of this Ineffable Being: such a research is vain and criminal.—

Thus do the Hindu sages express themselves in sundry places. They
commend aspiring to the knowledge of the Being of beings, making oneself
worthy to be absorbed in its bosom; and forbid, at the same time,
seeking to penetrate its nature. I have already said that such was the
doctrine of the mysteries. I am about to add an important reflection in
order to cast some light upon a doctrine which, at first glance, appears
contradictory.

Man, who aspires by the inner movement of his will, to attain to the
highest degree of human perfection, and who, by the purification of his
understanding, and the acquisition of celestial virtues, puts himself in
a state to receive the truth, must observe that the higher he rises in
the intelligible sphere, the nearer he approaches to the unfathomable
Being

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

whose contemplation must make his happiness, the less he can communicate
the knowledge of it to others; for truth, coming to him under
intelligible forms more and more universalized, can never be contained
in the rational or sentient forms that he might give it. Here is the
point where many mystic contemplators have gone astray. As they had
never adequately fathomed the triple modification of their being, and as
they had not known the intimate composition of the human Quaternary,
they were ignorant of the manner in which the transformation of ideas
was made, as much in the ascendant progression as in the descendant
progression; so that, confusing continually understanding and
intelligence, and making no difference between the products of their
will according as it acted in one or the other of its modifications,
they often showed the opposite of what they intended to show; and
instead of the seers that they might, perhaps, have been, they became
visionaries. I could give a great many examples of these aberrations;
but I will limit myself to a single one, because the man who furnishes
it for me, immeasurably great on the side of intelligence, lacked
understanding and felt keenly himself, the weakness of his reason. This
man, whose audacious gaze has penetrated as far as the divine sanctuary,
is a German shoemaker of obscure birth, called Jacob Boehme. The
rusticity of his mind, the roughness of his character, and more than all
that, the force and the number of his prejudices, render his works
almost unintelligible and therefore repel the savants. But when one has
the patience and talent necessary to separate the pure gold from its
dross and from its alloy, one can find there things which are nowhere
else. These things, which present themselves nearly always under the
oddest and most absurd forms, have taken them by passing from his
intelligence to his instinct, without his reason having had the force to
oppose itself. This is how he artlessly expresses this transformation of
ideas: ''Now that I have raised myself so high, I dare not look back for
fear that giddiness may seize me . . . for as

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

long as I ascend, I am convinced of my impulse; but it is not the same
when I turn my; head and when I wish to descend; then I am troubled, I
am bewildered, it seems to me that I shall fall." <span
id="fr_593"></span>[a](#fn_592.md) And in truth he fell so rapidly that he
did not perceive, either the terrible disparity between his ideas and
his expressions, nor the manifest contradictions into which his
prejudices had drawn him.

These grave disadvantages, which do not strike the vulgar, were
perfectly understood and appreciated by the sages. The institutors of
the mysteries were not ignorant of them and it is for this that they had
imposed the most absolute silence upon the initiates and particularly
upon the epopts, to whom they gave their highest teachings. They made
them feel readily that intelligible things can only become sentient by
being transformed, and that this transformation requires a talent and an
authority even, which cannot be the appanage of all men.

I am now at the close of my reflection. The diverse cults established
upon earth are but the transformations of ideas; that is to say,
particular forms of religion, by means of which a theocratic legislator
or theosophic sage renders sentient that which is intelligible, and puts
within reach of all men what, without these forms, would have been only
within reach of a very small number; now, these transformations can only
be effected in three ways, according to the three faculties of the human
Ternary; the fourth, which concerns its Quaternary or its relative
unity, being impossible. I beg the reader to recall what I have said,
touching the intimate composition and movement of this Quaternary, and
grant me a little attention.

The aim of all the cults being to conduct to the knowledge of the
Divinity, they differ only by the route that they travel in its
attainment, and this route depends always upon the manner in which the
Divinity has been considered by the

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

founder of the cult. If this founder has considered it in his
intelligence, he has seen the Divinity in its universal modifications,
and, therefore, triple, as the Universe; if he has considered it in his
understanding, he has seen it in its creative principles, and,
therefore, double as Nature; if he has considered it in his instinct, he
has seen it in its faculties and its attributes, and, therefore,
infinite, as Matter; if he has considered it, finally, in its proper
volitive unity, acting at once in its three modifications, he has seen
this same Divinity according to the force and movement of his thought,
either in its absolute essence or in its universal essence; that is, One
in its cause, or One in its effects. Examine closely what I have said
and see if there exists a single cult upon the face of the earth that
you may not connect with one of the kinds whose origin I have indicated.

I have said that the Divinity, considered in the human intelligence, is
shown under the emblem of the universal Ternary; hence all the cults
which are dominated by three principal gods as in India. <span
id="fr_594"></span>[a](#fn_593.md) in Greece and in Italy, <span
id="fr_595"></span>[b](#fn_594.md) three principal modifications in the
same God, as in China, <span id="fr_596"></span>[c](#fn_595.md) in Japan,
in Tibet and among the considerable followers of Fo-Hi or Buddha. <span
id="fr_597"></span>[d](#fn_596.md) This cult, which has been called that

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

of the *Tritheists*, is one of the most widespread on earth, and one
which has mingled most easily with the others. It pleases the
imagination and gives to wisdom great power to rise to intelligible
truths.

I have said that the Divinity, considered in the human understanding, is
manifest under the emblem of two natural principles: hence, all the
cults wherein two opposed beings appear, as in the cult of Zoroaster.
This cult, which is rarely encountered as pure as among the ancient
Persians, or among the followers of Manes, mingles readily with
tritheism and even polytheism: it was quite recognizable in Egypt and
among the Scandinavians, and much more involved among the Indians,
Greeks, and Latins. This cult could be considered as a natural
*Diarchy*, and those who follow it, *Diarchists*. Judgment and reason
conform very well in it; one also sees ordinarily, profound reasoners
and skeptics, inclining there *nolens volens*. <span
id="fr_598"></span>[a](#fn_597.md) Its abuse leads to atheism; but it
offers great means, when one knows how to make good use of it, to
penetrate the essence of things and succeed to the explanation of
natural phenomena.

Again I say, that the Divinity considered in the instinct is presented
under the emblem of material infinity: hence, all cults where, by a
contrary movement, the intelligible becomes sentient and the sentient
intelligible; as when the attributes and faculties of the Divinity are
particularized and personified, and as the agents of Nature, the parts
of the Universe and the individual beings themselves, are deified. This
cult, to which I have given the name of *Polytheism*, is everywhere,
under different forms and under different names,

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

the portion of the vulgar. More or less apparent it insinuates itself in
the midst of the other two, multiplies the images of the intellectual
modifications and the natural principles, and whatever attentions the
theosophists bring to forestall its invasion, end by stifling utterly
the spirit of it beneath the material covering which envelops them. This
cult, the cradle of all religions, with which the other two can never
entirely dispense, which nourishes and lives in their life, is also the
tomb. It pleases singularly that faculty of man which is developed
first, sense perception; it aids the development of instinct and can, by
the sole medium of common sense, lead to the knowledge of the natural
principles. Its abuse precipitates people into idolatry and
superstition; its good use arouses the talents and gives birth to heroic
virtues. One becomes artist or hero through the exaltation of
Polytheism; savant or philosopher through that of Diarchy; and sage or
theosophist through that of Tritheism. These three cults, whether pure
or variously mixed, are the only ones in which transformation may be
possible; that is to say, which may be clothed in ostensible forms and
enclosed in any sort of ritual. The fourth cult, which is founded upon
the absolute unity of God, is not transformable. This is the reason.

The Divinity considered in the volitive unity of man, acting at the same
time in its principal faculties, is manifested finally, in its absolute
essence, or in its universal essence; One in its cause, or One in its
effects: thence, not only all public cults, but all secret mysteries,
all doctrines mystic and contemplative; for how can that which has no
likeness to anything be represented? How render sentient that which is
beyond all intelligence? What expressions will be consistent with that
which is inexpressible, with that which is more ineffable than silence
itself? What temples will one raise to that which is incomprehensible,
inaccessible, unfathomable? The theosophists and sages have realized
these difficulties; they have seen that it was necessary to suppress all
discourse, to set aside all simulacra: to renounce

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

all enclosures, to annihilate finally all sentient objects or to be
exposed to give false ideas of the absolute essence of a Being that
neither time nor space can contain. Many have dared the undertaking. One
knows, in delving into ages long since past, that the ancient Magians of
Persia erected no temple and set up no statue. <span
id="fr_599"></span>[a](#fn_598.md) The Druids acted in the same
manner. <span id="fr_600"></span>[b](#fn_599.md) The former invoked the
Principle of all things upon the summits of mountains; the latter, in
the depths of the forests. Both deemed it unworthy of the divine Majesty
to enclose it within precincts and to represent it by a material
image. <span id="fr_601"></span>[c](#fn_600.md) It even appears that the
early Romans shared this opinion. <span id="fr_602"></span>[d](#fn_601.md)
But this cult, entirely intellectual and destitute of forms, could not
subsist long. Perceptible objects were needed by the people, on which
they might place their ideas. These objects, even in spite of the
legislator who sought to proscribe them, insinuated themselves. <span
id="fr_603"></span>[e](#fn_602.md) Images, statues, temples were multiplied
notwithstanding the laws which prohibited them. At that time if the cult
did not undergo a salutary reform, it was changed, either into a gross
anthropomorphism, or into an absolute materialism: that is to say, that
a man of the people being unable to rise to the divine Unity, drew it
down to his level; and the savant, being unable to comprehend it and
believing nevertheless to grasp it, confused it with Nature.

It was to evade this inevitable catastrophe that the sages and
theosophists had, as I have said, made a mystery of the Unity of God,
and had concealed it in the inmost recesses of the sanctuaries. It was
only after many trials, and not until the initiate was judged worthy to
be admitted to the sublime degree of autopsy, that the last veil was
lifted

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

to his gaze, and the principle and end of all things, the Being of
beings, in all its unfathomable Unity, was delivered to his
contemplation. <span id="fr_604"></span>[a](#fn_603.md)

<span id="fn_595"></span>[247:c](ogv38.htm#fr_596.md) In the *Tao-te-King*
of Lao-Tse, a work which has held a high reputation among the numerous
followers of this theosophist, one finds that the absolute, universal
Being which he declares can neither be named, nor defined, is triple.
"The first," he said, "has engendered the second; the two have produced
the third; and the three have made all things. That which the mind
perceives and the eye cannot see is named *Y*, the absolute Unity, the
central point; that which the heart understands and the ear cannot hear
is named *Hi*, the universal Existence; that which the soul feels and
the hand cannot touch is named *Ouei*, the individual Existence. Seek
not to penetrate the depths of this Trinity; its incomprehensibility
comes from its Unity." "This Unity," adds Lao-Tse, in another passage,
"is named *Tao*, the Truth; *Tao* is Life; *Tao* is to itself both rule
and model. It is so lofty that it cannot be attained; so profound that
it cannot be fathomed; so great that it contains the Universe; when one
looks on high one sees no beginning; when one follows it in its
productions, one finds in it no end."

<span id="fn_596"></span>[247:d](ogv38.htm#fr_597.md) One of the principal
dogmas of Fo-Hi is the existence of one God in <span id="page_248">p.
248</span> three persons, whose image is man. All his doctrine is
limited to leading, by meditation and repression of the passions, the
human ternary to its perfection. This ternary is composed, according to
him, of *Ki*, *Tsing*, and *Chen*, that is to say, of the material,
animistic, and spiritual principle. It is necessary that, being joined
together, this ternary should make but One. Then its duration will have
no limit and its faculties will be indestructible. *Voyez* Duhalde, t.
