### 5. Choose for thy friend, the friend of virtue; Yield to his gentle counsels, profit by his life, And for a trifling grievance never leave him;

After the duties which have their source directly in Nature, Pythagoras
commends to his disciples those which proceed from the social state;
friendship follows immediately filial piety, paternal and fraternal
love; but this philosopher makes a distinction full of meaning: he
ordains to honour one’s relations; he says to choose one’s friends. This
is why:

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

it is Nature that presides at our birth, that gives us a father, a
mother, brothers, sisters, relations of kinship, a position upon the
earth, and a place in society; all this depends not upon us: all this,
according to the vulgar, is the work of hazard; but according to the
Pythagorean philosopher these are the consequences of an anterior order,
severe and irresistible, called Fortune or Necessity. Pythagoras opposed
to this restrained nature, a free Nature, which, acting upon forced
things as upon brute matter, modifies them and draws as it wills, good
or bad results. This second nature was called Power or Will: it is this
which rules the life of man, and which directs his conduct according to
the elements furnished him by the first. Necessity and Power are,
according to Pythagoras, the two opposed motives of the sublunary world
where man is relegated. These two motives draw their force from a
superior cause that the ancients named *Nemesis*, the fundamental
decree, <span id="fr_284"></span>[a](#fn_283.md) that we name *Providence*.
Thus then, Pythagoras recognized, relative to man, things constrained
and things free, according as they depend upon Necessity or the Will: he
ranked filial piety in the first and friendship in the second. Man not
being free to give himself parents of his choice, must honour them such
as they are, and fulfil in regard to them all the duties of nature,
whatever wrong they might do towards him; but as nothing constrains him
from giving his friendship, he need give it only to the one who shows
himself worthy of it by his attachment to virtue.

Let us observe an important point. In China where filial piety is
regarded as the root of all virtues and the first source of
instruction, <span id="fr_285"></span>[b](#fn_284.md) the exercise of the
duties which it imposes admits of no exception. As the legislator
teaches

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

there that the greatest crime is to lack in filial piety, he infers that
he who has been a good son will be a good father and that thus nothing
will break the social tie <span id="fr_286"></span>[a](#fn_285.md); for he
first establishes this virtue which embraces all, from the emperor to
the lowliest of his subjects, and that it is for the peoples what the
regularity of the celestial movements is for the ethereal space: but in
Italy and in Greece where Pythagoras established his dogmas, it would
have been dangerous for him to give the same extension, since this
virtue not being that of the State, would necessarily involve abuses in
the paternal authority, already excessive among certain peoples. That is
the reason the disciples of this philosopher, in distinguishing between
forced and voluntary actions, judged wisely that it would be necessary
to apply here the distinction: therefore they urged to honour one’s
father and mother and to obey them in all that concerns the body and
mundane things, but without abandoning one’s soul to them <span
id="fr_287"></span>[b](#fn_286.md); for the divine law declares free what
has not been received from them and delivers it from their power.
Pythagoras furthermore had favoured this opinion by saying, that after
having chosen a friend from among the men most commended for their
virtues, it was necessary to learn by his actions and to be guided by
his discourse: which testified to the lofty idea that he had of
friendship. "Friends," he said, "are like companions of travel who
reciprocally assist each other to persevere in the path of the noblest
life. <span id="fr_288"></span>[c](#fn_287.md)" It is to him that we owe
that beautiful expression, so often quoted, so little felt by the
generality of men, and which a victorious king, Alexander the Great,
felt so keenly and expressed so felicitously by the following: "My
friend is another myself. <span id="fr_289"></span>[d](#fn_288.md)" It is
also from him that Aristotle had borrowed that beautiful definition:
"The real friend is one soul that lives in two

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

bodies." <span id="fr_290"></span>[a](#fn_289.md) The founder of the
Lyceum, in giving such a definition of friendship, spoke rather by
theory than by practice, he who reasoning one day upon friendship, cried
ingenuously: "Oh, my friends! there are no friends." <span
id="fr_291"></span>[b](#fn_290.md)

Yet Pythagoras did not conceive friendship as a simple individual
affection, but as an universal benevolence which should be extended to
all men in general, and to all good people. <span
id="fr_292"></span>[c](#fn_291.md) At that time he gave to this virtue the
name of philanthropy. It is the virtue which, under the name of charity,
serves as foundation for the Christian religion. Jesus offers it to his
disciples immediately after divine love, and as equal to piety. <span
id="fr_293"></span>[d](#fn_292.md) Zoroaster places it after
sincerity <span id="fr_294"></span>[e](#fn_293.md); he wished that man
might be pure in thought, speech, and action; that he might speak the
truth, and that he might do good to all men. Kong-Tse as well as
Pythagoras commended it after filial piety. <span
id="fr_295"></span>[f](#fn_294.md) "All morals," he said, "can be reduced
to the observation of three fundamental laws, of the relations between
sovereigns and subjects, between parents and children, between husbands
and wives; and to the strict practice of the five capital virtues, of
which the first is humanity, that is to say, that universal charity,
that expansion of the soul which binds man to man without distinction."
