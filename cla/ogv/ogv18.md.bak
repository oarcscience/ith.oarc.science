*The Golden Verses of Pythagoras*, by Fabre d'Olivet, \[1917\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 7. Still it is given thee to fight and overcome Thy foolish passions: learn thou to subdue them.

It seems that Lysis, foreseeing the wrong inductions that would be drawn
from what he had said, and as if he had a presentiment that one would
not fail to generalize the influence of Necessity upon the actions of
men, may have wished beforehand to oppose himself to the destructive
dogma of fatality, by establishing the empire of the Will over the
passions. This is in the doctrine of Pythagoras the real foundation of
the liberty of man: for, according to this philosopher, no one is free,
only he who knows how to master himself, <span
id="fr_314"></span>[c](#fn_313.md) and the yoke of the passions is much
heavier and more difficult to throw off than that of the most cruel
tyrants. Pythagoras, however, did not, according to Hierocles, prescribe
destroying the passions, as the Stoics taught in late times; but only to
watch over them and repress excess in them, because all excess is
vicious. <span id="fr_315"></span>[d](#fn_314.md) He regarded the passions
as useful to man, and although produced in principle by Necessity, and
given by an irresistible destiny, as nevertheless submissive in their
use to the free power of the Will. Plato had well realized this truth
and had forcibly indicated it in many passages of his works: one finds
it chiefly in the second dialogue of Hippias, where this philosopher
shows, evidently without seeming to have the design, that man good or
bad, virtuous or criminal, truthful or false, is only such by the power
of his will, and that the passion which carries him to virtue or to
vice, to truth or falsehood, is nothing in itself; so that no man is
bad, only by the faculty which he has of being good; nor good, only by
the faculty which he has of being bad.

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

But has man the faculty of being good or bad at his pleasure, and is he
not irresistibly drawn toward vice or virtue? This is a question which
has tried all the great thinkers of the earth, and which according to
circumstances has caused storms of more or less violence. It is
necessary, however, to give close attention to one thing, which is, that
before the establishment of Christianity and the admission of original
sin as fundamental dogma of religion, no founder of sect, no celebrated
philosopher had positively denied the free will, nor had taught
ostensibly that man may be necessarily determined to Evil or to Good and
predestined from all time to vice or virtue, to wickedness or eternal
happiness. It is indeed true that this cruel fatality seemed often to
follow from their principles as an inevitable consequence, and that
their adversaries reproached them with it; but. nearly all rejected it
as an insult, or a false interpretation of their system. The first who
gave place to this accusation, in ancient times, was a certain Moschus,
a Phœnician philosopher, who, according to Strabo, lived before the
epoch in which the war of Troy is said to have taken place, that is to
say, about twelve or thirteen centuries before our era. <span
id="fr_316"></span>[a](#fn_315.md) This philosopher detaching himself from
the theosophical doctrine, the only one known at that time, and having
sought the reason of things in the things themselves, can be considered
as the real founder of Natural Philosophy: he was the first who made
abstraction from the Divinity, and from the intelligence, and assumed
that the Universe existing by itself was composed of indivisible
particles, which, endowed with figures and diverse movements, produced
by their fortuitous combinations an infinite series of beings,
generating, destroying, and renewing themselves unceasingly. These
particles, which the Greeks named *atoms*, <span
id="fr_317"></span>[b](#fn_316.md) on account of their indivisibility,
constituted the

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

particular system which still bears this name. Leucippus, Democritus,
and Epicurus adopted it, adding to it their own ideas; and Lucretius
having naturalized it among the Romans, favoured its passage down to
these modern times, when the greater part of our philosophers have done
nothing but renovate it under other forms. <span
id="fr_318"></span>[a](#fn_317.md) Assuredly there is no system whence the
fatal necessity of all things issues more inevitably than from that of
atoms; also it is certain that Democritus was accused of admitting a
compulsory destiny, <span id="fr_319"></span>[b](#fn_318.md) although, like
Leibnitz, he admitted to each atom an animated and sentient
nature. <span id="fr_320"></span>[c](#fn_319.md) It is not known if he
replied to this accusation; but there are certain proofs that Epicurus,
who had less right than he to reject it, since he regarded atoms as
absolutely inanimate, <span id="fr_321"></span>[d](#fn_320.md) rejected it
nevertheless, and not wishing to admit a dogma subversive of all morals,
he declared himself against it, and taught the liberty of man. <span
id="fr_322"></span>[e](#fn_321.md)

A singular thing is, that this fatality which appears attached to the
system of atoms, whence the materialist promoters, true to their
principle, banished the influence of Divine Providence, <span
id="fr_323"></span>[f](#fn_322.md) followed still more naturally from the
opposed system, wherein the spiritualist philosophers admitted this
Providence to the full extent of its power. According to this last
system, a sole and same spiritual substance filled the Universe, and by
its diverse modifications produced there all the phenomena by which the
senses are affected. Parmenides, Melissus, and Zeno of Elea, who adopted
it, sustained it with great success: they asserted that matter was only
pure illusion, that there is nothing in things, that bodies and all
their variations are only pure

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

appearances, and that therefore nothing really exists outside of
spirit. <span id="fr_324"></span>[a](#fn_323.md) Zeno of Elea particularly,
who denied the existence of movement, brought against this existence
some objections very difficult to remove. <span
id="fr_325"></span>[b](#fn_324.md) The Stoic philosophers became more or
less strongly attached to this opinion. Chrysippus, one of the firmest
pillars of the Porch, taught that God is the soul of the world, and the
world, the universal extension of that soul. He said that by Jupiter,
should be understood, the eternal law, the fatal necessity, the
immutable truth of all future things. <span
id="fr_326"></span>[c](#fn_325.md) Now, it is evident that if, in
accordance with the energetic expression of Seneca; this unique
principle of the Universe has ordained once to obey always its own
command, <span id="fr_327"></span>[d](#fn_326.md) the Stoics were not able
to escape from the reproach that was directed toward them, of admitting
the most absolute fatality, since the soul of man being, according to
them, only a portion of the Divinity, its actions could have no other
cause than God Himself who had willed them. <span
id="fr_328"></span>[e](#fn_327.md) Nevertheless Chrysippus rejected the
reproach in the same manner as did Epicurus; he always sustained the
liberty of man, notwithstanding the irresistible force that he admitted
in the unique Cause <span id="fr_329"></span>[f](#fn_328.md); and what
seemed a manifest contradiction, he taught that the soul sins only by
the impulse of its own will, and therefore that the blame of its errors
should not be put upon destiny. <span id="fr_330"></span>[g](#fn_329.md)

But it suffices to reflect a moment upon the nature of the principles
set down by Epicurus, by Chrysippus, and

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

by all those who have preceded them or followed them in their divergent
opinions, to see that the inferences drawn by their adversaries were
just, and that they could not refute them without contradicting
themselves. <span id="fr_331"></span>[a](#fn_330.md) Every time that one
has claimed to found the Universe upon the existence of a sole material
or spiritual nature, and to make proceed from this sole nature the
explanation of all phenomena, one has become exposed and always will be,
to insurmountable difficulties. It is always in asking what the origin
of Good and Evil is, that all the systems of this sort have been
irresistibly overthrown, from Moschus, Leucippus, and Epicurus, down to
Spinoza and Leibnitz; from Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, and Chrysippus,
down to Berkeley and Kant. For, let there be no misunderstanding, the
solution of the problem concerning free will depends upon preliminary
knowledge of the origin of evil, so that one cannot reply plainly to
this question: Whence comes Evil? Neither can one reply to this one: Is
man free? And that one be not still further deceived here, the knowledge
of the origin of evil, if it has been acquired, has never been openly
divulged: it has been profoundly buried with that of the Unity of God in
the ancient mysteries and has never emerged except enveloped in a triple
veil. The initiates imposed upon themselves a rigid silence concerning
what they called the *sufferings of God* <span
id="fr_332"></span>[b](#fn_331.md): his death, his descent into the
infernal regions, and his resurrection. <span
id="fr_333"></span>[c](#fn_332.md) They knew that the serpent was, in
general, the symbol of evil, and that it was under this form that the
Python had fought with and been slain by Apollo. <span
id="fr_334"></span>[d](#fn_333.md) The theosophists have not made a public
dogma of the Unity of God, precisely on

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

account of the explanation that it would be necessary to give to the
origin of good and evil; for without this explanation, the dogma in
itself would have been incomprehensible. Moses realized it perfectly,
and in the plan which he had conceived of striking the people whose
legislator he was, with a character as extraordinary as indelible, by
founding his cult upon the publicity of a dogma hidden, until that time
in the depths of the sanctuaries and reserved for the initiates alone,
he did not hesitate to divulge what he knew pertaining to the creation
of the world and the origin of evil. It is true that the manner in which
he gave it, under a simplicity and apparent clarity, concealed a
profundity and obscurity almost unfathomable; but the form which he gave
to this formidable mystery sufficed to support, in the opinion of the
vulgar, the Unity of God and this was all that he wished to do.

Now it is the essence of theosophy to be dogmatic, and that of natural
philosophy to be skeptical; the theosophist speaks by faith, the
physicist speaks by reason; the doctrine of the one excludes the
discussion that the system of the other admits and even necessitates. Up
to that time, theosophy dominating upon the earth had taught the
influence of the will, and the tradition which was preserved in it among
all the nations of the earth during an incalculable succession of
centuries gave it the force of demonstration. Among the Indians,
Krishna; among the Persians, Zoroaster; in China, Kong-Tse; in Egypt,
Thoth; among the Greeks, Orpheus; even Odin, among the Scandinavians;
everywhere the lawgivers of the people had linked the liberty of man
with the consoling dogma of Divine Providence. <span
id="fr_335"></span>[a](#fn_334.md) The peoples

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

accustomed to worship in polytheism the Divine Infinity and not its
Unity, did not find it strange to be guided, protected, and watched over
on the one side, whereas they remained, on the other, free in their
movements; and they did not trouble themselves to find the source of
good and evil since they saw it in the objects of their cult, in these
same gods, the greater part of whom being neither essentially good nor
essentially bad were reputed to inspire in them the virtues or the vices
which, gathered freely by them, rendered them worthy of recompense or
chastisement. <span id="fr_336"></span>[a](#fn_335.md) But when Natural
Philosophy appeared, the face of things was changed. The natural
philosophers, substituting the observation of nature and experience for
mental contemplation and the inspiration of theosophists, thought that
they could make sentient what was intelligible, and promised to prove by
fact and reasoning whatever up to that time had had only proofs of
sentiment and analogy. They brought to light the great mystery of
Universal Unity, and transforming this Intellectual Unity into corporal
substance placed it in water, <span id="fr_337"></span>[b](#fn_336.md) in
infinite space, <span id="fr_338"></span>[c](#fn_337.md) in the air, <span
id="fr_339"></span>[d](#fn_338.md) in the fire, <span
id="fr_340"></span>[e](#fn_339.md) whence they draw in turn the essential
and formal existence of all things. The one, attached to the school of
Ionia, established as fundamental maxim, that there is but one principle
of all; and the other, attached to that of Elea,

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

started from this axiom that nothing is made from nothing. <span
id="fr_341"></span>[a](#fn_340.md) The former sought the *how*, and the
latter the *why* of things; and all were united in saying that there is
no effect without cause. Their different systems, based upon the
principles of reasoning which seemed incontestable, and supported by a
series of imposing conclusions, had, at first, a prodigious success; but
this *éclat* paled considerably when soon the disciples of Pythagoras,
and a little later those of Socrates and Plato, having received from
their masters the theosophical tradition, stopped these sophistical
physicists in the midst of their triumphs, and, asking them the cause of
physical and of moral evil, proved to them that they knew nothing of it;
and that, in whatever fashion they might deduce it by their system, they
could not avoid establishing an absolute fatality, destructive to the
liberty of man, which by depriving it of morality of actions, by
confounding vice and virtue, ignorance and wisdom, made of the Universe
no more than a frightful chaos. In vain these had thrust back the
reproach and claimed that the inference was false; their adversaries
pursuing them on their own ground cried out to them: If the principle
that you admit is good, whence comes it that men are wicked and
miserable? <span id="fr_342"></span>[b](#fn_341.md) If this unique
principle is bad, whence emerge goodness and virtue? <span
id="fr_343"></span>[c](#fn_342.md) If nature is the expression of this sole
principle, how is it not constant and why does its government sow
goodness and evil? <span id="fr_344"></span>[d](#fn_343.md) The
materialists had recourse vainly to a certain deviation in atoms, <span
id="fr_345"></span>[e](#fn_344.md) and the spiritualists, to a certain
adjuvant cause quite similar to efficacious grace <span
id="fr_346"></span>[f](#fn_345.md); the theosophists would never have
renounced them if they

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

had not enclosed them in a syllogistic circle, by making them admit,
sometimes that the unique and all-powerful Principle cannot think of
everything, <span id="fr_347"></span>[a](#fn_346.md) sometimes that vice is
useful and that without it there would be no virtue <span
id="fr_348"></span>[b](#fn_347.md); paradoxes of which they had no trouble
demonstrating the absurdity and the revolting inferences. <span
id="fr_349"></span>[c](#fn_348.md)

Take a survey of all the nations of the world, peruse all the books that
you please, and you will find the liberty of man, the free will of his
actions, the influence of his will over his passions, only in the
theosophical tradition. Wherever you see physical or metaphysical
systems, doctrines of whatever kind they may be, founded upon a sole
principle of the material or spiritual Universe, you can conclude boldly
that absolute fatality results from it and that their authors find
themselves in need of making two things one: or of explaining the origin
of good and evil, which is impossible; or of establishing the free will
*a priori*, which is a manifest contradiction of their reasonings. If
you care to penetrate into metaphysical depths, examine this decisive
point upon this matter. Moses founded his cult upon the Unity of God and
he explained the origin of evil; but he found himself forced by the very
nature of this formidable mystery to envelop his explanation with such a
veil, that it remained impenetrable for all those who had not received
the traditional revelation; so that the liberty of man existed in his
cult only by favour of theosophical tradition, and that it became weaker
and disappeared entirely from it with this same tradition, the two
opposed sects of the Pharisees and Sadducees which divided the cult
prove this. <span id="fr_350"></span>[d](#fn_349.md) The

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

former, attached to the tradition and allegorizing the text of the
*Sepher*, <span id="fr_351"></span>[a](#fn_350.md) admitted the free
will <span id="fr_352"></span>[b](#fn_351.md); the others, on the contrary,
rejecting it and following the literal meaning, established an
irresistible destiny to which all was subjected. The most orthodox
Hebrews, and those even who passed as seers or prophets of the nation,
had no difficulty in attributing to God the cause of Evil. <span
id="fr_353"></span>[c](#fn_352.md) They were obviously authorized by the
history of the downfall of the first man, and by the dogma of original
sin, which they took according to the meaning attached to it by the
vulgar. It also happened, after the establishment of Christianity and of
Islamism, that this dogma, received by both cults in all its extent and
in all its literal obscurity, has necessarily drawn with it
predestination, which is, in other words, only the fatality of the
ancients. Mohammed, more enthusiast than learned, and stronger in
imagination than in reasoning, has not hesitated a moment, admitting it
as an inevitable result of the Unity of God, which he announced after
Moses. <span id="fr_354"></span>[d](#fn_353.md) It is true that a few
Christian doctors, when they have

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

been capable of perceiving the inferences in it have denied this
predestination, and have wished, either by allegorizing the dogma of
original sin, as Origen, or rejecting it wholly, as Pelagius, to
establish the free will and the power of the will; but it is easy to
see, in reading the history of the church, that the most rigid
Christians, such as Saint Augustine and the ecclesiastical authority
itself, have always upheld predestination as proceeding necessarily from
the divine Prescience and from the All-Powerful, without which there is
no Unity. The length of this examination forces me to suspend the proofs
that I was going to give regarding this last assertion; but further on I
will return to it.

sect of the Sadducees is derived from the word ‏שד‎ (*shad*) which,
expressing all diffusion, <span id="page_160">p. 160</span> all
propagation, is applied to productive nature in general, and in
