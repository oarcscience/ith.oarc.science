### THE ROSE

<span class="smallcaps">If</span> it pleased the whim of Zeus in an
idle  
Hour to choose a king for the flowers, he surely  
Would have crowned the rose for its regal beauty,  
              Deeming it peerless;

By its grace is valley and hill embellished,  
Earth is made a shrine for the lover's ardor;  
Dear it is to flowers as the charm of lovely  
              Eyes are to mortals;

Joy and pride of plants, and the garden's glory,  
Beauty's blush it brings to the cheek of meadows;  
Draining fire and dew from the dawn for rarest  
              Color and odor;

Softly breathed, its scent is a plea for passion,  
When it blooms to welcome the kiss of Kypris;  
Sheathed in fragrant leaves its tremulous petals  
              Laugh in the zephyr.
