### HYMENAIOS

<span class="smallcaps">Artisans</span>, raise high the roof beam!  
Tall is the bridegroom as Ares,  
Taller by far than the tallest,  
            O Hymenæus!

Ay! towering over his fellows,  
As over men of all other  
Lands towers the Lesbian singer,  
            O Hymenæus!

Well-favored, too, is the maiden,  
Eyes that are sweeter than honey,  
Fair both in face and in figure,  
            O Hymenæus!

For there was never another  
Virgin in loveliness like her,  
By Aphrodite so honored,  
            O Hymenæus!

O happy bridegroom, the wedding  
Comes to the point of completion;  
Thou hast the maid of thy choosing,  
            O Hymenæus!

See how a paleness suffuses  
Soft o’er her exquisite features,  
Passion's benign premonition,  
            O Hymenæus!

Go to the couch unreluctant,  
Rejoicing and sweet to the bridegroom;  
He in his turn is rejoicing,  
            O Hymenæus!

May Hesperus lead thee, and Hera,  
She whom to-night that ye honor,  
Silver-throned Goddess of marriage,  
            O Hymenæus!
