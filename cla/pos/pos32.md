### THE BOAST OF ARES

<span class="smallcaps">Ares</span> said he would drag  
  Hephestus by force  
From Poseidon's palace  
  Deep down in the sea;  
  Where he had fashioned  
The cunning throne  
  With the secret chains.

He presented the throne,  
  Forsooth, as a gift  
To the queen of heaven;  
  But Hera soon found  
  For revenge on her  
Who had him cast  
  From the home of Gods.

For secure in its clasp  
  Of adamant gold  
She was held imprisoned,  
  The prey of his guile;  
  And Hephestus knew  
By him alone  
  Could the queen be freed.

But the great God of war  
  Made boast of his strength;  
He would bring the forger  
  Of metals and tricks  
  On high to release  
Hera, and end  
  Her enraged despair.

Ares said he would drag  
  Hephestus by force,  
But was made to waver  
  And flee when assailed  
  With a blazing brand  
By the dark God  
  Of the underworld.
