### TIDINGS

<span class="smallcaps">She</span> wrapped herself in linen woven
close,  
Stuffs delicate and texture-fine as those  
The dark Nile traders for our bartering  
From Egypt, Crete and far Phocea bring.

Love lent her feet the wings of winds to reach  
(Whose steps stir not the shingle of the beach)  
My marble court and, breathless, bid me know  
My lover's sails across the harbor blow.

He seemed to her, as to himself he seems,  
Like some bright God long treasured in her dreams;  
She saw him standing at his galley's prow—  
My Phaon, mine, in Mitylene now!
