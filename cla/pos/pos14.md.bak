### THE DISTAFF

<span class="smallcaps">Come</span>, ye dainty Graces and lovely
Muses,  
Rosy-armed and pure and with fairest tresses,  
Come from groves on Helicon's hill where murmur  
                Founts that are holy;

Come with dancing step and with lips harmonic,  
Gather near and view my ivory distaff,  
Gift from Cos my brother Charaxus brought me,  
                Sailing from Egypt;

Sailing back to Lesbos from far Naucratis,  
From the seven mouths of the Nile and Egypt  
Up the blue Ægean, the island-dotted  
                Ocean of Hellas;

Choicest wool alone will I spin for fabrics,  
Winding reel with threads for the cloths as fleecy,  
Soft and fine as they bring from far Phocea,  
                Sidon or Sardis;

While I weave my thought shall engird the giver,  
Whether here, or far on the sea, or resting  
Couched in shady courts with the lovely garland  
                Girls of Naucratis.
