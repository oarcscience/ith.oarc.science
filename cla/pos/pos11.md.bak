### APHRODITE'S DOVES

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> the drifting gray of the vesper
shadow  
Dimmed their upward path through the midmost azure,  
And the length of night overtook them distant  
              Far from Olympus;

Far away from splendor and joy of Paphos,  
From the voice and smile of their peerless Mistress,  
Back to whom their truant wings were in rapture  
              Speeding belated;

Chilled at heart and grieving they drooped their pinions,  
Circled slowly, dipping in flight toward Lesbos,  
Down through dusk that darkened on Mitylene's  
              Columns of marble;

Down through glory wan of the fading sunset,  
Veering ever toward the abode of Sappho,  
Toward my home, the fane of the glad devoted  
              Slave of the Goddess;

Soon they gained the tile of my roof and rested,  
Slipped their heads beneath their wings while I watched them  
Sink to sleep and dreams, in the warm and drowsy  
              Night of midsummer.
