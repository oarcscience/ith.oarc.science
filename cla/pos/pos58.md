### MNASIDICA

<span class="smallcaps">Set</span>, O Dica, garlands on thy lovely  
Glinting mass of fine and golden tresses,  
Sprays of dill with fingers soft entwining  
While I stand apart to better judge.

Those who have fair wreaths about the forehead,  
Breathing brentheian odor to the senses,  
Ever first find favor with the Graces  
Who from wreathless suppliants turn away.

Dica, Mnasidica, thou art shapely  
With the flowing curves of Aphrodite;  
Eyes the color of her azure ocean  
Washing wide on Cyprus’ languid shore.

In thy every movement grace unconscious  
Sways the rhythmic poem of thy body,  
Charming with elusive undulation  
Like a splendid lily in the wind.

As I stand apart to judge the better  
Fair effects that roses add to beauty,  
All thy rays of loveliness concentered  
Sun me till I swoon with swift desire.
