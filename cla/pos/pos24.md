### DEATH

<span class="smallcaps">Death</span> is an evil; so the Gods decree,  
So they have judged, and such must rightly be  
Our mortal view; for they who dwell on high  
Had never lived, had it been good to die.

And so the poet's house should never know  
Of tears and lamentations any show;  
Such things befit not us who deathless sing  
Of love and beauty, gladness and the spring.

No hint of grief should mar the features of  
Our dreams of endless beauty, lasting love;  
For they reflect the joy inviolate,  
Eternal calm that fronts whatever fate.

Clëis, my darling, grieve no more, I pray!  
Let wandering winds thy sorrow bear away,  
And all our care; my daughter, let thy smile  
Shine through thy tears and gladden me the while.
