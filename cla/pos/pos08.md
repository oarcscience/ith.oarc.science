### ODE TO APHRODITE

<span class="smallcaps">Aphrodite</span>, subtle of soul and
deathless,  
Daughter of God, weaver of wiles, I pray thee  
Neither with care, dread Mistress, nor with anguish,  
            Slay thou my spirit!

But in pity hasten, come now if ever  
From afar of old when my voice implored thee,  
Thou hast deigned to listen, leaving the golden  
            House of thy father

With thy chariot yoked; and with doves that drew thee,  
Fair and fleet around the dark earth from heaven,  
Dipping vibrant wings down he azure distance,  
            Through the mid-ether;

Very swift they came; and thou, gracious Vision,  
Leaned with face that smiled in immortal beauty,  
Leaned to me and asked, "What misfortune threatened?  
            Why I had called thee?"

"What my frenzied heart craved in utter yearning,  
Whom its wild desire would persuade to passion?  
What disdainful charms, madly worshipped, slight thee?  
            Who wrongs thee, Sappho?"

"She that fain would fly, she shall quickly follow,  
She that now rejects, yet with gifts shall woo thee,  
She that heeds thee not, soon shall love to madness,  
            Love thee, the loth one!"

Come to me now thus, Goddess, and release me  
From distress and pain; and all my distracted  
Heart would seek, do thou, once again fulfilling,  
            Still be my ally!
