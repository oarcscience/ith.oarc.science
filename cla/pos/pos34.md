### GNOMICS

#### I

<span class="smallcaps">My</span> ways are quiet, none may find  
My temper of malignant kind;  
For one should check the words that start  
When anger spreads within the heart.

#### II

Who from my hands what I can spare  
Of gifts accept the largest share,  
Those are the very ones who boast  
No gratitude and wrong me most.

#### III

He who in face and form is fair  
Must needs be good, the Gods declare;  
But he whose thought and act are right  
Will soon be equal fair to sight.

#### IV

Beauty of youth is but the flower  
Of spring, whose pleasure lasts an hour;  
While worth that knows no mortal doom  
Is like the amaranthine bloom.
