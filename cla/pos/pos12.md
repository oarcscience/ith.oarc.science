### ANACREON'S SONG

<span class="smallcaps">Golden-Throned</span> Muse, sing the song that
in olden  
Days was sung of love and delight in Teos,  
In the goodly land of the lovely women:  
               Strains that in other

Years the hoary bard with the youthful fancy  
Set to mirthful stir of flutes, when the dancing  
Nymphs that poured the wine for the poet's banquet  
               Mixed it with kisses;

Sing the song while I, in the arms of Atthis,  
Seal her lips to mine with a lover's fervor,  
Breathe her breath and drink her sighs to the honeyed  
               Lull of the melics.
