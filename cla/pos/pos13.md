### THE DAUGHTER OF CYPRUS

<span class="smallcaps">Dreaming</span> I spake with the Daughter of
Cyprus,  
Heard the languor soft of her voice, the blended  
Suave accord of tones interfused with laughter  
               Low and desireful;

Dreaming saw her dread ineffable beauty,  
Saw through texture fine of her clinging tunic  
Blush the fire of flesh, the rose of her body,  
               Radiant, blinding;

Saw through filmy meshes the melting lovely  
Flow of line, the exquisite curves, whence piercing  
Rapture reached with tangible touch to thrill me,  
               Almost to slay me;

Saw the gleaming foot, and the golden sandal  
Held by straps of Lydian work thrice doubled  
Over the instep's arch, and up the rounded  
               Dazzling ankle;

Saw the charms that shimmered from knee to shoulder,  
Hint of hues, than milk or the snowdrift whiter;  
Secret grace, the shrine of the soul of passion,  
               Glows that consumed me;

Saw the gathered mass of her xanthic tresses,  
Mitra-bound, escape from the clasping fillet,  
Float and shine as clouds in the sunset splendor,  
               Mists in the dawn-fire;

Saw the face immortal, and daring greatly,  
Raised my eyes to hers of unfathomed azure,  
Drank their world's desire, their limitless longing,  
               Swooned and was nothing.
