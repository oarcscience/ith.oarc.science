### APHRODITE'S PRAISE

<span class="smallcaps">O Sappho</span>, why art thou ever  
Singing with praises the blessed  
      Queen of the heaven?

Why does the heart in thy bosom  
Ever revert in its yearning  
      Throb to the Goddess?

Why are thy senses unsated  
Ever in quest of elusive  
      Love that is deathless?

Ah, gracious Daughter of Cyprus,  
Never can I as a mortal  
      Tire of thy service.

Thou art the breath of my body,  
The blood in my veins, and the glowing  
      Pulse of my bosom.

Omnipotent, burning, resistless,  
Thou art the passion that shaking  
      Masters me ever.

Thou art the crisis of rapture  
Relaxing my limbs, and the melting  
      Ebb of emotion;

Bringing the tears to my lashes,  
Sighs to my lips, in the swooning  
      Excess of passion.

O golden-crowned Aphrodite,  
Grant I shall ever be grateful,  
      Sure of thy favor;

Worthy the lot of thy priestess,  
Supreme in the song that forever  
      Rings with thy praises.
