### EUNEICA

<span class="smallcaps">Aphrodite's</span> handmaid,  
Bright as gold thou camest,  
Tender woven garlands  
Round thy tender neck;

Sweet as soft Persuasion,  
Lissome as the Graces,  
Shy Euneica, lovely  
Girl from Salamis.

Slender thou as Syrinx,  
As the waving reed-nymph,  
Once by Pan, the god of  
Summer winds, deflowered.

On thy lips whose quiver  
Seems to plead for pity,  
Mine shall rest and linger  
Like the mouth of Pan

On the mouth of Syrinx,  
When his breath that filled her  
Blew through all her body  
Music of his love.
