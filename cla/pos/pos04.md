### LOVE'S BANQUET

<span class="smallcaps">If</span> Panormus, Cyprus or Paphos hold
thee,  
Either home of Gods or the island temple,  
Hark again and come at my invocation,  
               Goddess benefic;

Come thou, foam-born Kypris, and pour in dainty  
Cups of amber gold thy delicate nectar,  
Subtly mixed with fire that will swiftly kindle  
               Love in our bosoms;

Thus the bowl ambrosial was stirred in Paphos  
For the feast, and taking the burnished ladle,  
Hermes poured the wine for the Gods who lifted  
               Reverent beakers;

High they held their goblets and made libation,  
Spilling wine as pledge to the Fates and Hades,  
Quaffing deep and binding their hearts to Eros,  
               Lauding thy servant.

So to me and my Lesbians round me gathered,  
Each made mine, an amphor of love long tasted,  
Bid us drink, who sigh for thy thrill ecstatic,  
               Passion's full goblet;

Grant me this, O Kypris, and on thy altar  
Dawn will see a goat of the breed of Naxos,  
Snowy doves from Cos and the drip of rarest  
               Lesbian vintage;

For a regal taste is mine and the glowing  
Zenith-lure and beauty of suns must brighten  
Love for me, that ever upon perfection  
               Trembles elusive.
