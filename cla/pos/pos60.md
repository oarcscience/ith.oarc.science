### GYRINNO

<span class="smallcaps">Now</span> the silver crescent  
Of the moon has vanished,  
With the golden Pleiads  
Drifting down the west.

It is after midnight  
And the time is passing,  
Hours we pledged to passion  
And I sleep alone.

Anger ill becomes thee,  
Tender-souled Gyrinno,  
Shapelier is Dica  
But less loved by me.

Art thou still relentless,  
Wilful one, annulling  
All thy protestations  
In the fervid past?

Can it, O Charites,  
Be thou hast forgotten?  
Dost thou love another,  
Even now, perchance?

Ah, my tears are falling,  
Yet in my despairing  
Mood I lie and listen  
For thy furtive step;

For the lightest rustle  
Of thy flowing garment,  
For thy sweet and panting  
Whisper at the door.

Now the moon has vanished  
With the golden Pleiads;  
It is after midnight  
And I sleep alone.
