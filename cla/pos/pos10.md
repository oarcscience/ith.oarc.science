### THE GARDEN OF THE NYMPHS

<span class="smallcaps">All</span> around through the apple boughs in
blossom  
Murmur cool the breezes of early summer,  
And from leaves that quiver above me gently  
            Slumber is shaken;

Glades of poppies swoon in the drowsy languor,  
Dreaming roses bend, and the oleanders  
Bask and nod to drone of bees in the silent  
            Fervor of noontide;

Myrtle coverts hedging the open vista,  
Dear to nightly frolic of Nymph and Satyr,  
Yield a mossy bed for the brown and weary  
            Limbs of the shepherd.

Echo ever wafts through the drooping frondage,  
Ceaseless silver murmur of water falling  
In the grotto cool of the Nymphs, the sacred  
            Haunt of Immortals;

Down the sides of rocks that are gray and lichened  
Trickle tiny rills, whose expectant tinkle  
Drips with gurgle hushed in the clear glimmering  
            Depths of the basin.

Fair on royal couches of leaves recumbent,  
Interspersed with languor of waxen lilies,  
Lotus flowers empurple the pool whose edge is  
            Cushioned with mosses;

Here recline the Nymphs at the hour of twilight,  
Back in shadows dim of the cave, their golden  
Sea-green eyes half lidded, up to their supple  
            Waists in the water.

Sheltered once by ferns I espied them binding  
Tresses long, the tint of lilac and orange;  
Just beyond the shimmer of light their bodies  
            Roseate glistened;

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

Deftly, then, they girdled their loins with garlands,  
Linked with leaves luxuriant limb and shoulder;  
On their breasts they bruised the red blood of roses  
            Fresh from the garden.

She of orange hair was the Nymph Euxanthis,  
And the lilac-tressed were Iphis and Io;  
How they laughed, relating at length their ease in  
            Evading the Satyr.
