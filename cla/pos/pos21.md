### PIERIA'S ROSE

<span class="smallcaps">Pale</span> death shall come, and thou and thine
shall be,  
Then and thereafter, to all memory  
Forgotten as the wind that yesterday  
Blew the last lingering apple buds away;

For thou hadst never that undying rose  
To grace the brow and shed immortal glows;  
Pieria's fadeless flower that few may claim  
To wreathe and save thy unremembered name.

Ay! even on the fields of Dis unknown,  
Obscure among the shadows and alone,  
Thy flitting shade shall pass uncomforted  
Of any heed from all the flitting dead.

But no one maid, I think, beneath the skies,  
At any time shall live and be as wise,  
In sooth, as I am; for the Muses Nine  
Have made me honored and their gifts are mine;

And men, I think, will never quite forget  
My songs or me; so long as stars shall set  
Or sun shall rise, or hearts feel love's desire,  
My voice shall cross their dreams, a sigh of fire.
