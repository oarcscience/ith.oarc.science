### THE CRETAN DANCE

<span class="smallcaps">As</span> the moon in all her splendor  
Slowly rose above the forest,  
Silent stood the Cretan women  
          Round the altar.

Girdled close their clinging tunics,  
Made of some transparent fabric,  
Traced the every curve and lissome  
          Of their bodies.

With revering eyes uplifted  
To the round and rising planet,  
Soon its drifting beams of silver  
          Lit their faces.

Soft and clear its sphere effulgent,  
Full defined above the treetops,  
Steeped in pale unearthly glamor  
          All the landscape.

When the argent glimmer rested  
On the altar piled with garlands,  
And its glow unveiled the marble  
          Aphrodite;

Linking hands, the Cretan women  
Moving gracefully with metric  
Steps began to dance a measure  
          To the Goddess.

All so light their feet unsandalled  
Pressed the velvet grass in treading,  
That they scarcely bruised its tender  
          Blooming verdure.

Slowly turning in a circle  
To the east, their voices chanted  
In a plaintive note the sacred  
          Ithyphallics;

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

Then they paused, their steps retracing  
Toward the west, and answered strophe  
By antistrophe with choric  
          Tones accordant;

With the aftersong epodic,  
Standing all before the altar,  
Lo! the hymn in praise of Paphos  
          Was completed.
