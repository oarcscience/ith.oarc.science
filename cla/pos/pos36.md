### LETO AND NIOBE

<span class="smallcaps">Leto</span> and Niobe were friends full dear,  
The Goddess’ heart and woman's heart were one  
In that maternal love that men revere,  
Love that endures when other loves are done.

But Niobe with all a mother's pride,  
Artless and foolish, would not be denied;  
And boasted that her children were more fair  
Than Leto's lovely children of the air.

The proud Olympians vowed revenge for this,  
Irate Apollo, angered Artemis;  
They slew her children, heedless of her moan,  
And with the last her heart was turned to stone.
