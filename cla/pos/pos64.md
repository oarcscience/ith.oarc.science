### DAMOPHYLA

<span class="smallcaps">Cold</span> of heart and strangely  
Uninclined to passion,  
Wisdom's vigil leaves thee,  
Proud Damophyla.

Sapphics thou hast written,  
Verses in my metre,  
With a skill surpassing  
In the melic art.

Love's superb enchantment  
Thou art fain to banish,  
Like the virgin Huntress  
Long by thee adored.

Molded by thy tunic,  
Every arching contour  
Of her chaste and noble  
Form I dream to see;

Even view her stepping  
From the leafy covert  
Down the dawn-white valley,  
Stately as a stag.

Long I sued but found thee  
Deaf to all entreaty,  
Till one summer twilight  
Listless in the heat;

Soothed by slumber's languor,  
And my low monodic  
Voice that hymned a pæan  
In the praise of love;

Loth to yield yet vanquished,  
As I knelt beside thee,  
All thy long resistance  
To my kiss succumbed.
