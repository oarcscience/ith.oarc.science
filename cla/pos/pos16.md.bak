### THE REPROACH

<span class="smallcaps">Kypris</span>, hear my prayer to thee and the
Nereids!  
Safely bring the ship of my brother homewards,  
Bring him back unharmed to the heart that loves him,  
                Throbbing remorseful;

Fair Immortal, banish from mind, I pray thee,  
Every discord's hint that of yore estranged us;  
Grant that never again dissension's hateful  
                Wrangle shall part us;

May he never in days to come remember  
Keen reproach of mine that had grieved him sorely;  
Words that broke my very heart when I heard them  
                Uttered by others;

Words that wounded deep and recurring often,  
Bowed his head with shame at the public banquet;  
Where my scorn, amid festal joy and laughter,  
                Sharpened the covert

Jests that stung his pride and assailed his folly,  
Slave-espoused when he, a Lesbian noble,  
Might have won the fairest in Mitylene,  
                Virgins the noblest;

Open slurs that linked his name with Doricha,  
Lovely slave that Xanthes had sold in Egypt;  
She whose wondrous charms the wealth of Charaxus  
                Ransomed from bondage.

Now that he is gone and my anger vanished,  
Keen regret and grief for the pain I gave him  
Pierce my heart, and fear of loss that is anguish  
                Darkens the daylight.
