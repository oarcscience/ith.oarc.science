### AMŒBEUM: ALCÆUS AND SAPPHO

<span class="small">ALCÆUS</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Violet</span>-weaving Sappho, pure and lovely,  
Softly-smiling Sappho, I would utter  
Something that my secret hope has cherished,  
Did no painful sense of shame deter me.

<span class="small">SAPPHO</span>

Had the impulse of thy heart been honest,  
It had urged no evil supplication;  
Shame had not abashed thy eyes before me,  
And thy words had done thee no dishonor.

<span class="small">ALCÆUS</span>

Softly-smiling Sappho, longing bids me  
Tell thee all that in my heart lies hidden.

<span class="small">SAPPHO</span>

Have no fear, Alcæus, to offend me!  
Thy emotion stirs my heart to pity.

<span class="small">ALCÆUS</span>

I desire thee, violet-weaving Sappho!  
Love thee madly, softly-smiling Sappho!

<span class="small">SAPPHO</span>

Hush, Alcæus! thou must choose a younger  
Comrade for thy couch, for I would never  
Join thy years to mine—the Gods forbid it—  
Youth and ardent fire to age and ashes.
