### BRIDAL SONG

<span class="smallcaps">Bride</span>, that goest to the bridal chamber  
In the dove-drawn car of Aphrodite,  
      By a band of dimpled  
        Loves surrounded;

Bride, of maidens all the fairest image  
Mitylene treasures of the Goddess,  
      Rosy-ankled Graces  
        Are thy playmates;

Bride, O fair and lovely, thy companions  
Are the gracious hours that onward passing  
      For thy gladsome footsteps  
        Scatter garlands.

Bride, that blushing like the sweetest apple  
On the very branch's end, so strangely  
      Overlooked, ungathered  
        By the gleaners;

Bride, that like the apple that was never  
Overlooked but out of reach so plainly,  
      Only one thy rarest  
        Fruit may gather;

Bride, that into womanhood has ripened  
For the harvest of the bridegroom only,  
      He alone shall taste thy  
        Hoarded sweetness.
