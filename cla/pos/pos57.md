### GORGO

<span class="smallcaps">Gorgo</span>, I am weary  
Of thy love's insistence,  
Thou to me appearest  
An ill-favored child.

Though I am than Gello  
Fonder still of virgins,  
Toward thee I have never  
Felt the least desire.

Yesternight I knew not  
What to do, for pity  
Moved my bosom deeply,  
Seeing thee implore.

Harassed by alternate  
Yielding and refusal,  
I was half persuaded  
Then to grant thy prayer.

At my door thy presence  
Lingers like a shadow;  
Vain wouldst thou reproach me  
With appealing eyes.

Dost thou think by constant  
Proofs of lasting passion,  
Slowly my obdurate  
Will to wear away?

Gorgo, I am weary  
Of thy love's insistence,  
And my strength exhausted  
Grants thy wish at last.
