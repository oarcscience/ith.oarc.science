### THE PRIESTESS OF ARTEMIS

<span class="smallcaps">Maidens</span>, that pass my tomb with laughter
sweet,  
A voice unresting echoes at your feet;  
Pause, and if any would my story seek,  
Dumb as I am, these graven words will speak;  
Once in the vanished years it chanced to please  
Arista, daughter of Hermocleides,  
To dedicate my life in virgin bliss  
To thee, revered of women, Artemis!  
O Goddess, deign to bless my grandsire's line,  
For Saon was a temple priest of thine;  
And grant, O Queen, in thy benefic grace,  
Unending fame and fortune to his race.
