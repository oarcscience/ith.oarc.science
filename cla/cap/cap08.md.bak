Psyche Awakened

# Part VII.

But Cupid being now healed of his wound and malady, not able to endure
the absence of Psyche, got him secretly out at a window of the chamber
where he was enclosed, and, receiving his wings, took his flight towards
his loving wife; whom when he had found he wiped away the sleep from her
face, and put it again into the box, and awaked her with the tip of one
of his arrows, saying: "O wretched caitiff, behold thou werest well-nigh
perished again with thy overmuch curiosity; well, go thou, and do thy
message to my mother, and in the mean season I will provide for all
things accordingly." Wherewithal he took his flight into the air, and
Psyche brought her present to Venus.

Cupid being more and more in love with Psyche, and fearing the
displeasure of his mother, did pierce into the heavens, and arrived
before Jupiter to declare his cause. Then Jupiter after that he had
eftsoons embraced him, gan say in this manner: "O my well-beloved son,
although thou hast not given due reverence and honour unto me as thou
oughtest to do, but hast rather soiled and wounded this my breast,
whereby the laws and order of the elements and planets be disposed, with
continual assaults of terrene luxury and against all laws, and the
discipline Julia, and the utility of the public weal, in transforming my
divine beauty into serpents, fire, savage beasts, birds and bulls.
Howbeit, remembering my modesty, and that I have nourished thee with
mine own proper hands, I will do and accomplish all thy desire, so that
thou canst beware of spiteful and envious persons. And if there be any
excellent maiden of comely beauty in the world, remember yet the benefit
which I shall show unto thee, by recompense of her love towards me
again." When he had spoken these words, he commanded Mercury to call all
the Gods to council, and if any of the celestial powers did fail of
appearance, he should be condemned in ten thousand pounds: which
sentence was such a terror unto all the Gods, that the high theatre was
replenished, and Jupiter began to speak in this sort: "O ye Gods,
registered in the books of the Muses, you all know this young man Cupid,
whom I have nourished with mine own hands, whose raging flames of his
first youth I thought best to bridle and restrain. It sufficeth in that
he is defamed in every place for his adulterous living, wherefore all
occasion ought to be taken away by mean of marriage: he hath chosen a
maiden that fancieth him well, and hath bereaved her of her virginity,
let him have her still and possess her according to his own pleasure."
Then he returned to Venus, and said: "And you, my daughter, take you no
care, neither fear the dishonour of your progeny and estate, neither
have regard in that it is a mortal marriage, for it seemeth unto me
just, lawful, and legitimate by the law civil."
