The Marriage Feast

# Part VIII

Incontinently after, Jupiter commanded Mercury to bring up Psyche, the
spouse of Cupid, into the palace of heaven. And then he took a pot of
immortality, and said: "Hold, Psyche, and drink to the end thou mayst be
immortal, and that Cupid may be thine everlasting husband."

By and by the great banquet and marriage feast was sumptuously prepared.
Cupid sat down with his dear spouse between his arms: Juno likewise with
Jupiter, and all the other Gods in order. Ganymede filled the pot of
Jupiter, and Bacchus served the rest. Their drink was nectar, the wine
of the Gods. Vulcan prepared supper, the Hours decked up the house with
roses and other sweet smells, the Graces threw about balm, the Muses
sang with sweet harmony, Apollo tuned pleasantly to the harp, Venus
danced finely, Satyr and Pan played on their pipes: and thus Psyche was
married to Cupid, and after she was delivered of a child, whom we call
Pleasure.

 

 

Here ends the Story of the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche as rendered into
the English tongue by William Adlington from the Latin of Apuleius. This
version, first published in MDLXVI, is now reissued, with illustrations
by Dorothy Mullock, by Chatto and Windus at 111 St. Martin's Lane,
London. MCMXIV.
