### DEMOSTHENES

### AN ENCOMIUM

A LITTLE before noon on the sixteenth, I was walking in the Porch--it
was on the left-hand side as you go out--, when Thersagoras appeared; I
dare say he is known to some of you--short, hook-nosed,
fair-complexioned, and virile. He drew nearer, and I spoke: 'Thersagoras
the poet. Whence, and whither?' 'From home, hither,' he replied. 'Just a
stroll?' I asked. 'Why, I do need a stroll too,' he said. 'I got up in
the small hours, impressed with the duty of making a poetic offering on
Homer's birthday.' 'Very proper,' said I; 'a good way of paying for the
education he has given you.' 'That was how I began,' he continued, 'and
time has glided by till now it is just upon noon; that was what I meant
by saying I wanted a stroll.

<span class="margnote"><span id="145:2">2</span></span>'However, I
wanted something else much more--an inter view with this gentleman' (and
he pointed to the Homer; you know the one on the right of the Ptolemies'
shrine, with the hair hanging loose); 'I came to greet him, and to pray
for a good flow of verse.' 'Ah,' I sighed, 'if prayers would do it! in
that case *I* should have given Demosthenes a worrying for assistance
against *his* birthday. If prayers availed, I would join my wishes to
yours; for the boons we desire are the same.' 'Well, I put down to
Homer,' he replied, 'my facility of this night and morning; ardours
divine and mystic have possessed me. But you shall judge. Here are my
tablets, which I have brought with designs upon any idle friend I might
light upon; and you, I rejoice to see, are idle.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="145:3">3</span></span>'Ah, you lucky
man!' I exclaimed; 'you are like the winner of the three miles, who had
washed off the dust, and could

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

amuse himself for the rest of the day. He was minded to crack a story
with the wrestler, when the wrestling was next on the programme; but the
wrestler asked him whether he had felt like cracking stories when he
toed the line just now. You have won your poetic three miles, and want
me to minister to your amusement just as I am shivering at the thought
of my hundred yards.' He laughed: 'Why, how will it make things worse
for you? '

'Ah, you probably consider Demosthenes of much less<span
class="margnote"><span id="146:4">4</span></span> account than Homer.
*You* are very proud of your eulogy on Homer; and is Demosthenes a light
matter to *me*?' 'A trumped up charge,' he exclaimed; 'I am not going to
sow dissension between these two mighty ones, though it is true my own
allegiance is rather to Homer.'

'Good,' I said, 'and you must allow me to give mine to <span
class="margnote"><span id="146:5">5</span></span> Demosthenes. But,
though you do not disqualify my subject, I am sure you think poetry the
only real treatment; you feel about mere rhetoric what the cavalryman
feels as he gallops past the infantry.' 'I hope I am not so mad as
that,' he said, 'though a considerable touch of madness is required of
him who would pass the gates of poetry.' 'If you come to that, prose
cannot do without some divine inspiration either, if it is not to be
flat and common.' He admitted that at once: 'I often delight myself with
comparing passages from Demosthenes and other prose writers with Homer
in point of vehemence, pungency, fire. "Flown with wine" I pair off
against the revellings and dancings and debauchery of Philip; "One
presage that ne’er fails <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)" finds its
counterpart in "It is for brave men, founding themselves upon brave
hopes--"; "How would old Peleus, lord of steeds, repine--" is matched by
"What a cry of lamentation would go up from the men of those days

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

who laid down their lives for glory and freedom--"; "fluent Python"
reminds me of Odysseus's "snow-flake speech"; "If ’twere our lot neither
to age nor die," I illustrate by "For every man's life must end in
death, though he shut himself up in a narrow chamber for safer keeping."
In fact the instances are numberless in which they attack their meaning
by the same road.

<span class="margnote"><span id="147:6">6</span></span>'I love too to
study his feelings and moods and transitions, the variety with which he
combats weariness, his resumptions after digression, the charm of his
opportune illustrations, and the never-failing native purity of his
style.

<span class="margnote"><span id="147:7">7</span></span>'It has often
struck me about Demosthenes--for I will tell the whole truth out--that
that looser of the bonds of speech rebukes Athenian slackness with a
dignity that is lacking in the "Greekesses" used by Homer of the Greeks;
and again he maintains the tragic intensity proper to the great Hellenic
drama more consistently than the poet who inserts speeches at the very
crisis of battle and allows energy to evaporate in words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="147:8">8</span></span>'As often as I
read Demosthenes, the balanced clauses, the rhythmic movement and
cadence, make me forget that this is not my beloved poetry; for Homer
too abounds in contrast and parallel, in figures startling or simple. It
is a provision of nature, I suppose, that each faculty should have its
proper equipment attached to it. How should I scorn your Muse? I know
her powers too well.

<span class="margnote"><span id="147:9">9</span></span>'None the less, I
consider my task of a Homeric encomium twice as difficult as your praise
of Demosthenes; not because it must be in verse, but from the nature of
the material; *I* cannot lay down a foundation of fact to build the
edifice of praise upon; there is nothing but the poems themselves.
Everything else is uncertain--his country, his family, his time. If
there had been any uncertainty about them,

Debate and strife had not divided men;

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

but as it is, they give him for a country Ios or Colophon or Cumae,
Chios, Smyrna, or Egyptian Thebes, or half a hundred other places; his
father may be Macon the Lydian, or he may be a river; his mother is now
Melanope, and now in default of satisfactory human descent a dryad; his
time is the Heroic Age, or else perhaps it is the Ionic. There is no
knowing for certain whether he was before or after Hesiod, even; and no
wonder, considering that some object to his very name, and will have him
Melesigenes instead. So too with his poverty, and his blindness.
However, all these questions are best left alone. So you see the arena
open to my panegyric is extremely limited; my theme is a poet and not a
man of action; I can infer and collect his wisdom only from his verses.

'Your work, now, can be reeled smoothly off out of hand; <span
class="margnote"><span id="148:10">10</span></span> you have your
definite known facts; the butcher's meat is there, only needing to be
garnished with the sauce of your words. History supplies you with the
greatness and distinction of Demosthenes; it is all known; his country
was Athens, the splendid, the famous, the bulwark of Hellas. Now if *I*
could have laid hands on Athens, I might have used the poet's right to
introduce the loves and judgements and sojourns there of the Gods, the
gifts they lavished on it, the tale of Eleusis. As for its laws and
courts and festivals, its Piraeus and its colonies, the memorials set up
in it of victory by land and sea, Demosthenes  himself is the authority
for saying that no words could do justice to them. My material would
have been inexhaustible; and I could not have been accused of hanging up
my true theme; the formula of panegyric includes the arraying of the man
in the splendours of his country. So too Isocrates ekes out his *Helen*
by introducing Theseus. It is true that poets have their privileges; and
perhaps *you* have to be more careful about your proportions; there must
not be *too* much sack to the proverbial halfpennyworth of bread.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="149:11">11</span></span>'Well then, let
Athens go; but your discourse at once finds another support in his
father's wealth--that "golden base" which Pindar likes--; for to be
responsible for providing a warship was to be among the richest
Athenians in those days. And though he died while Demosthenes was quite
a child, we are not to count his orphan state a disaster; it led to the
distinction that brought his splendid gifts into notice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="149:12">12</span></span>'Tradition
gives us no hint of how Homer was educated or developed his powers; the
panegyrist must plunge straight into his works, and can find nothing to
talk about in his breeding and training and pupilage; he has not even
the resource of that Hesiodic sprig of bay which could make a facile
poet out of a shepherd. But think of *your* abundance in this branch of
the subject. There is Callistratus and all the mighty roll of orators,
Alcidamas, Isocrates, Isaeus, Eubulides. Then again, at Athens even
those who were subject to paternal control had countless temptations to
indulgence, youth is the susceptible time, a neglected ward could have
lived as irregular a life as he chose, and yet the objects that
Demosthenes set up for himself were philosophy and patriotism, and the
doors they took him to not Phryne's, but those of Aristotle and
Theophrastus, Xenocrates and Plato.

<span class="margnote"><span id="149:13">13</span></span>'And so, my
dear sir, your way is open to a disquisition upon the two kinds of human
love, the one sprung of a desire that is like the sea, outrageous,
fierce, stormily rocking the soul; it is a true sea wave, which the
earthly Aphrodite sets rolling with the tempestuous passions of youth;
but the other is the steady drawing of a golden cord from heaven; it
does not scorch and pierce and leave festering wounds; it impels towards
the pure and unsullied ideal of absolute beauty, and is a sane madness
in those souls which "yet hold of Zeus and nurse the spark divine."

<span class="margnote"><span id="149:14">14</span></span>'Love will find
out the way, though that way involve a shaven

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

head, a cavern dwelling, a discouraging mirror and punitive sword, a
disciplining of the tongue, a belated apprenticeship to the actor's art,
a straining of the memory, a conquest over clamour, and a borrowing of
night hours to lengthen toilsome days <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_18.md). All this your Demosthenes endured, and
who knows not what an orator it made of him? his speech packed with
thought and terse of language, himself convincing in his knowledge of
human nature, as splendid in the elevation as mighty in the force of his
sentiments, the master and not the slave of his words and his ideas,
ever fresh with the graces of his art. He is the one orator whose speech
has, in the bold phrase of Leosthenes, at once the breath of life and
the strength of wrought iron.

Callisthenes remarked of Aeschylus that he wrote his tragedies<span
class="margnote"><span id="150:15">15</span></span> in wine, which lent
vigour and warmth to his work. With Demosthenes it was otherwise; he
composed not on wine but on water; whence the witticism of Demades, that
most men's tongues are regulated by water <span
id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_19.md), but Demosthenes's pen was subject to the
same influence. And Pytheas detected the smell of the midnight oil in
the very perfection of the speeches. Well, there is much in common
between your subject and mine, so far as this branch of them is
concerned; on Homer's *poems* I was no worse off than you are.

'But when you come to your hero's acts of humanity, his <span
class="margnote"><span id="150:16">16</span></span> pecuniary
sacrifices, his grand political achievements ' (and he was going on in
full swing to the rest of the catalogue, when I interrupted, with a
laugh: 'Must I be dowsed with the remainder of your canful, good
bath-man?' 'Most certainly,' he retorted, and went straight on), 'the
public entertainments

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

he gave, the public burdens he assumed, the ships, the wall, the trench
he contributed to, the prisoners he ransomed, the girls he portioned,
his admirable policy, the embassies he served on, the laws he got
passed, the mighty issues he was concerned in--why, then I cannot but
laugh to see your contracted brows; as if a recital of the exploits of
Demosthenes *could* lack matter!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="151:17">17</span></span>'I believe you
think, my good man,' I protested, 'that I have never had the deeds of
Demosthenes drummed into me; I should be singular among rhetoricians,
then.' 'It was on the assumption,' he said, 'implied by you, that we
want assistance. But perhaps your case is a very different one; is the
light so bright that you cannot manage to fix your eyes on the dazzling
glory of Demosthenes? Well, I was rather like that about Homer at first.
Indeed, I came very near turning mine away, thinking I could not
possibly face my subject. However, I got over it somehow or other;
became gradually inured, as it were, superior to the weakness of vision
that would have condemned me for a bastard eagle and no true son of
Homer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="151:18">18</span></span>'But now here
is another great advantage that I consider you have over me. The poetic
faculty has a single aim; from which it follows that Homer's glory must
be laid hold of at once and as a whole. You on the other hand, if you
were to attempt dealing with the whole Demosthenes all at once, would
never know what to say; you would waver and not be able to set your
thoughts to work. You would be like the *gourmand* at a Sicilian
banquet, or the aesthete who has a thousand delightful sights and sounds
presented to him at once; they do not know which way to turn for their
conflicting desires. I suspect that you too are distracted and find
concentration impossible; all round you are the varied attractions--his
magnanimity, his fire, his orderly life, his oratorical force and
practical courage, the endless opportunities of gain that he scorned,
his justice, humanity, honour,

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

spirit, sagacity, and each of all his great services to his country. It
may well be that, when you behold on this side decrees, ambassadors,
speeches, laws, on the other, fleets, Euboea, Boeotia, Chios, Rhodes,
the Hellespont, Byzantium, you are pulled to and fro among these too
numerous invitations, and cannot tell which to accept.

'Pindar once found himself in a similar difficulty with an
overabundant<span class="margnote"><span id="152:19">19</span></span>
theme:

Ismenus? Melia's distaff golden-bright?  
Cadmus? the race from dragon's teeth that came?  
Thebe's dark circlet? the all-daring might  
Of Heracles? great Bacchus' merry fame?  
White-armed Harmonia's bridal?--Ay, but which?  
My Muse, we 're poor in that we are too rich.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> You, I dare say,
are in the same quandary. Logic and life, rhetoric and philosophy,
popularity and death--ay, but which?

The maze is quite easy to escape from, though; you have <span
class="margnote"><span id="152:20">20</span></span> only to take hold of
one single clue, no matter which--his oratory, if you will, so that it
is taken by itself--, and stick to that one throughout your present
discourse. You will have ample material; his oratory is not of the
Periclean type. Pericles could lighten and thunder, and he could hit the
right nail on the head; so much tradition tells us; but we have nothing
to judge for ourselves by, no doubt because, beyond the momentary
impression produced, there was in his performances no element of
permanence, nothing that could stand the searching test of time. But
with Demosthenes's work--well, that it will be your province to deal
with, if your choice goes that way.

Or if you prefer his character, or his policy, it will be well <span
class="margnote"><span id="152:21">21</span></span> to isolate some
particular detail--if you are greedy you may pick out two or
three--which will give you quite enough to go upon; so great was he at
every point. And for such specializing we

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

have Homer's example; the compliments he pays his heroes are attached to
parts of them, their feet, their heads, their hair, even their shields
or something they have on; and the Gods seem to have had no objection to
poets' basing their praises merely on a distaff, a bow, or the aegis; a
limb or a quality must pass still more easily; and as for good actions,
it is impossible to give an exhaustive list of them. Demosthenes
accordingly will not blame you for confining your eulogy to *one* of his
merits, especially as to celebrate the whole of them worthily would be
beyond even *his* powers.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="153:22">22</span></span>When
Thersagoras had finished this harangue, I remarked: 'Your intention is
plain; I am to be convinced that you are more than a good poet; so you
have constructed your prose Demosthenes as a pendant to your verse
Homer.' 'No, no,' he said; 'what made me run on so long was the idea
that, if I could ease your mind by showing how light your task was, I
should have secured my listener.' 'Then let me tell you that *your*
object has not been furthered, and my case has only been aggravated.' 'A
fine doctor I seem to be!' he said. 'Not knowing where the difficulty
lies,' I continued, 'you are a doctor who mistakes his patient's ailment
and treats him for another.' 'How so?'

'You have been prescribing for the troubles that would attend a first
attempt; unfortunately it is years and years since I got through that
stage, and your remedies are quite out of date.' 'Why, then,' he
exclaimed, 'the cure is complete; nobody is nervous about a road of
which he knows every inch.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="153:23">23</span></span>'Ah, but then I
have set my heart upon reversing the feat that Anniceris of Cyrene
exhibited to Plato and his friends. To show what a fine driver he was,
he drove round the Academy time after time exactly in his own track,
which looked after it as if it had only been traversed once. Now my
endeavour is just the opposite, to *avoid* my old tracks; and it is by
no means

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

so easy to keep out of the ruts.' 'Pauson's is the trick for you,' he
said. 'What is that? I never heard of it.'

'Pauson the painter was commissioned to do a horse rolling. <span
class="margnote"><span id="154:24">24</span></span> He painted one
galloping in a cloud of dust. As he was at work upon it, his patron came
in, and complained that this was not what he had ordered. Pauson just
turned the picture upside down and told his man to hold it so for
inspection; there was the horse rolling on its back.' 'You dear
innocent!' I said; 'do you suppose I have kept my picture turned the
same way all these years? It has been shifted and tilted at every
conceivable angle, till I begin to have apprehensions of ending like
Proteus.' 'And how was that?' 'Oh, I mean the issue of his attempts to
evade human observation; when he had exhausted all shapes of animals and
plants and elements, finding no metamorphosis left him, he had to be
Proteus again.'

'You have more shifts than ever Proteus had,' he said, 'to <span
class="margnote"><span id="154:25">25</span></span> get off hearing my
poem.'

'Oh, do not say that,' said I; 'off goes my burden of care, <span
class="margnote"><span id="154:26">26</span></span> and I am at your
service. Perhaps when you have got over your own pains of child-birth
you will show more feeling for my delicate state.'

He liked the offer, we settled down on a convenient stone step, and I
listened to some excellent poetry. In the middle of reading he was
seized with an idea, did up his tablets, and said: 'You shall have your
hearer's fee, as well deserved as an Athenian's after a day in court or
assembly. Thank me, please.' 'I do, before I know what for. But what may
it be?' 'It was in the Macedonian royal archives that I came across the
book;

I was delighted with it at the time, and took considerable trouble to
secure it; it has just come into my head that I have it at home. It
contains, among details of Antipater's management of the household,
facts about Demosthenes that I think you will find worth your best
attention.' 'You shall have

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

payment on the spot,' I said, 'in the shape of an audience for the rest
of your verses; and moreover I shall not part with you till your promise
is fulfilled. You have given me a luscious Homer birthday dinner; and it
seems you are to be at the charges of the Demosthenes one too.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="155:27">27</span></span>He read to the
end, we stayed long enough for me to give the poem its meed of praise,
and then adjourned to his house, where after some search the book was
found. I took it away with me, and on further acquaintance was so much
impressed by it that I shall do no editing, but read it you *totidem
verbis*. Asclepius is not less honoured if his worshippers, in default
of original compositions, have the hymns of Isodemus or Sophocles
performed before him; there is a failure nowadays in the supply of new
plays for Dionysus; but those who produce the works of old masters at
the proper season have the credit all the same of honouring the God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="155:28">28</span></span>This book, then
(the part of the state records that concerns us is the conversation I
shall give you)--the book informs us that Archias's name was announced
to Antipater. In case any of my younger hearers should not know the fact
already, this Archias had been charged with the arrest of all exiles. In
particular, he was to get Demosthenes from Calauria into Antipater's
presence, but rather by persuasion than by force. Antipater was excited
about it, hoping that Demosthenes might arrive any day. So, hearing that
Archias was come from Calauria, he gave orders for his instant
admittance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="155:29">29</span></span>When he
entered--but you shall have the conversation as it stands.

*Archias. Antipater*

*Ar*. Is it well with you, Antipater?

*Ant*. It is well, if you have brought Demosthenes.

*Ar*. I have brought him as I might. I have the urn that holds his
remains

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

*Ant*. Ha? my hopes are dashed. What avail ashes and urns, if I have not
Demosthenes?

*Ar*. The soul, O King, may not be prisoned in a man's own despite.

*Ant*. Why took you him not alive?

*Ar*. We took him.

*Ant*. And he has died on the way?

*Ar*. He died where he was, in Calauria.

*Ant*. Your neglect is to blame; you took not due care of him.

*Ar*. Nay, it lies not at our door.

*Ant*. What mean you? These are riddles, Archias; you took him alive,
and you have him not?

*Ar*. Was it not your charge that we should use no force at <span
class="margnote"><span id="156:30">30</span></span> first? Yet indeed we
should have fared no better if we had; we did intend it.

*Ant*. You did not well, even in the intention; it may be your violence
killed him.

*Ar*. No, we killed him not; but if we could not persuade him, there was
nothing for it but force. But, O King, how had you been the better off,
if he had come alive? you could have done no more than kill him.

*Ant*. Peace, Archias! methinks you comprehend neither the <span
class="margnote"><span id="156:31">31</span></span> nature of
Demosthenes, nor my mind. You think there is no more in the finding of
Demosthenes than in the hunting down such scoundrels as Himeraeus or
Aristonicus or Eucrates; these are like swollen torrents--mean fellows
in themselves, to whom a passing storm gives brief importance; they make
a brave show while the disturbance lasts; but they are as sure to vanish
soon as the wind to fall at evening. The recreant Hyperides is
another--a selfish demagogue, who took no shame to curry favour with the
mob by libelling Demosthenes, and make himself its instrument for ends
that his dupes soon wished they had never attained; for the libels had
not long borne their

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

fruit before the libelled was reinstated with more honour than
Alcibiades himself. But what reeked Hyperides? he scrupled not to use
against what had once been dearest to him the tongue that he deserved,
even by that iniquity, to lose.

*Ar*. How.? was Demosthenes not our enemy of enemies? <span
class="margnote"><span id="157:32">32</span></span>

*Ant*. Not in the eyes of one who cares for an honourable nature, and
loves a sincere consistent character. The noble is noble, though it be
in an enemy; and virtue has no country. Am I meaner than Xerxes? he
could admire Bulis and Sperchis the Spartans, and release them when they
were in his power. No man that ever lived do I admire more than
Demosthenes; twice I was in his company at Athens (in hurried times, it
is true), and I have heard much from others, and there is his work to
judge by. And what moves me is not his skill in speech. You might well
suppose so; Python was nothing, matched with him, and the Attic orators
but babes in comparison with his finish and intensity, the music of his
words, the clearness of his thoughts, his chains of proof, his
cumulative blows. We found our mistake when we listened to Python and
his promises; we had gathered the Greeks to Athens to see the Athenians
confuted; it was Demosthenes who confuted us. But no words of mine can
describe the power of his eloquence.

Yet to that I give but a secondary place, as a tool the man <span
class="margnote"><span id="157:33">33</span></span> used. It was the man
himself I marvelled at, his spirit and his wisdom, and the steadiness of
soul that steered a straight course through all the tempests of fortune
with never a craven impulse. And Philip was of my mind about him; when a
speech of his before the Athenian assembly against Philip was reported,
Parmenio was angry, and made some bitter jest upon him. But Philip said:
*Ah, Parmenio, he has a right to say what he pleases; he is the only
popular orator in all Greece whose name is missing in my secret service
accounts, though I would far rather have put myself in his hands than in
those of clerks and third-rate* 

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

*actors. All the tribe of them are down for gold, timber, rents, cattle,
land, in Boeotia if not in Macedonia* <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_20.md)*; but the walls of Byzantium are not more
proof against the battering-ram than Demosthenes against gold.*

*This is the way I look at it, Parmenio. An Athenian who* <span
class="margnote"><span id="158:34">34</span></span> *speaking in Athens
prefers me to his country shall have of my money, but not of my
friendship; as for one who hates me for his country's sake, I will
assault him as I would a citadel, a wall, a dock, a trench, but I have
only admiration for his virtue, and congratulations for the State that
possesses him. The other kind I should like to crush as soon as they
have served my purpose; but him I would sooner have here with us than
the Illyrian and Triballian horse and all my mercenaries; arguments that
carry conviction, weight of intellect, I do not put below force of
arms*.

That was to Parmenio; and he said much the same to me. <span
class="margnote"><span id="158:35">35</span></span> At the time of the
Athenian expedition under Diopithes, I was very anxious, but Philip
laughed at me heartily, and said: *Are you afraid of these town-bred
generals and their men? Their fleet, their Piraeus, their docks, I snap
my fingers at them. What is to be looked for from people whose worship
is of Dionysus, whose life is in feasting and dancing? If Demosthenes,
and not a man besides, had been subtracted from Athens, we should have
had it with less trouble than Thebes or Thessaly; deceit and force,
energy and corruption, would soon have done the thing. But he is ever
awake; he misses no occasion; he makes move for move and counters every
stroke. Not a trick of ours, not an attempt begun or only thought of,
but he has intelligence of it; in a word he is the obstacle that stands
between us and the swift attainment of our ends. It was little fault of
his that we took Amphipolis, that we won Olynthus, Phocis, Thermopylae,
that we are masters of the Hellespon*t.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="159:36">36</span></span>*He rouses his
reluctant countrymen out of their opiate sleep, applies to their
indolence the knife and cautery of frank statement, and little he cares
whether they like it or not. He transfers the revenues from state
theatre to state armament, re-creates with his navy bill a fleet
disorganized to the verge of extinction, restores patriotism to the
place from which it had long been ousted by the passion for legal fees,
uplifts the eyes of a degenerate race to the deeds of their fathers and
emulation of Marathon and Salamis, and fits them for Hellenic leagues
and combinations. You cannot escape his vigilance, he is not to be
wheedled, you can no more buy him than the Persian King could buy the
great Aristides*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="159:37">37</span></span>*This is the
direction your fears should take, Antipater; never mind all the
war-ships and all the fleets. What Themistocles and Pericles were to the
Athens of old, that is Demosthenes to Athens to-day, as shrewd as
Themistocles, as high of soul as Pericles. He it was that gained them
the control of Euboea and Megara, the Hellespont and Boeotia. It is well
indeed that they give the command to such as Chores or Diopithes or
Proxenus, and keep Demosthenes to the platform at home. If they had
given into his hands their arms and ships and troops, their strategy and
their money, I doubt he would have put me on my mettle to keep
Macedonia; even now that he has no weapon but his decrees, he is with us
at every turn, his hand is upon us; the ways and means are of his
finding, the force of his gathering; it is he that sends armadas afar,
he that joins power to power, he that meets our every change of plan*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="159:38">38</span></span>This was his
tone about Demosthenes on many other occasions too; he put it down as
one of his debts to fortune that armies were never led by the man whose
mere words were so many battering-rams and catapults worked from Athens
to the shattering and confounding of his plans. As to Chaeronea, even
the victory made no difference; he continued to impress upon us how
precarious a position this one man had contrived for us.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Things went
unexpectedly well; their generals were cowards and their troops
undisciplined, and the caprice of fortune, which has so often served us
well, brought us out victorious; but he had reduced me to hazarding my
kingdom and my life on that single throw; he had brought the most
powerful cities into line, he had united Greece, he had forced Athens
and Thebes and all Boeotia, Corinth, Euboea, Megara--the might of
Greece, in short--to play the game out to its end, and had arrested me
before I reached Attic soil*.

He never ceased to speak thus about Demosthenes. If any <span
class="margnote"><span id="160:39">39</span></span> one told him the
Athenian democracy was a formidable rival, 'Demosthenes,' he would say,
'is my only rival; Athens without him is no better than Aenianes or
Thessalians.' Whenever Philip sent embassies to the various states, if
Athens had sent any one else to argue against his men, he always gained
his point with ease; but when it was Demosthenes, he would tell us the
embassy had come to naught: there was not much setting up of trophies
over speeches of Demosthenes.

Such was Philip's opinion. Now I am no Philip at the best, <span
class="margnote"><span id="160:40">40</span></span> and do you suppose,
Archias, that if I could have got a man like Demosthenes, I should have
found nothing better to do with him than sending him like an ox to the
slaughter? or should I have made him my right-hand man in the management
of Greece and of the empire? I was instinctively attracted long ago by
his public record--an attraction heightened by the witness of Aristotle.
He constantly assured both Alexander and myself that among all the vast
number of his pupils he had found none comparable to Demosthenes in
natural genius and persevering self-development, none whose intellect
was at once so weighty and so agile, none who spoke his opinions so
freely or maintained them so courageously.

*But you* (said Aristotle) *confuse him with an Eubulus, a Phrynon*,
<span class="margnote"><span id="160:41">41</span></span> *a
Philocrates, and think to convert with gifts a man who has actually* 

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

*lavished his inheritance half on needy Athenians and half on Athens;
you vainly imagine that you can intimidate one who has long ago resolved
to set his life upon his country's doubtful fortunes; if he arraigns
your proceedings, you try denunciation; why, the nearer terrors of the
Assembly find him unmoved. You do not realize that the mainspring of his
policy is patriotism, and that the only personal advantage he expects
from it is the improvement of his own nature*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="161:42">42</span></span>All this it
was, Archias, that made me long to have him with me, to hear from his
own lips what he thought about the state of things, and be able at any
time of need, abandoning the flatterers who infest us, to hear the plain
words of an independent mind and profit by sincere advice. And I might
fairly have drawn his attention to the ungrateful nature of those
Athenians for whom he had risked all when he might have had firmer and
less unconscionable friends.

*Ar*. O King, your other ends you might have gained, but that you would
have told him to no purpose; his love of Athens was a madness beyond
cure.

*Ant*. It was so indeed; ’twere vain to deny it. But how died he?

<span class="margnote"><span id="161:43">43</span></span>*Ar*. O King,
there is further wonder in store for you. We who have had the scene
before our eyes are as startled and as unbelieving yet as when we saw
it. He must long ago have determined how to die; his preparation shows
it. He was seated within the temple, and our arguments of the days
before had been spent on him in vain.

*Ant*. Ay? and what were they?

*Ar*. Long and kindly I urged him, with promises on your part, not that
I looked to see them kept (for I knew not then, and took you to be wroth
with him), but in hopes they might prevail.

*Ant*. And what hearing did he give them? Keep nothing back; I would I
were there now, hearing him with my own

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

ears; failing which, do you hide nothing from me. ’Tis worth much to
learn the bearing of a true man in the last moments of his life, whether
he gave way and played the coward, or kept his course unfaltering even
to the end.

*Ar*. Ah, in him was no bending to the storm; how far from <span
class="margnote"><span id="162:44">44</span></span> it! With a smiling
allusion to my former life, he told me I was not actor enough to make
your lies convincing.

*Ant*. Ha? he left life for want of belief in my promises?

*Ar*. Not so; hear to the end, and you will see his distrust was not all
for you. Since you bid me speak, O King, he told me there was no oath
that could bind a Macedonian; it was nothing strange that they should
use against Demosthenes the weapon that had won them Amphipolis, and
Olynthus, and Oropus. And much more of the like; I had writers there,
that his words might be preserved for you. *Archias* (he said), *the
prospect of death or torture would be enough to keep me out of
Antipater's presence. And if you tell me true, I must be on my guard
against the worse danger of receiving life itself as a present at his
hands, and deserting, to serve Macedonia, that post which I have sworn
to hold for Greece*.

*Life were a thing to be desired, Archias, were it purchased for* <span
class="margnote"><span id="162:45">45</span></span> *me by the power of
Piraeus (a war-ship, my gift, has floated there), by the wall and trench
of which I bore the cost, by the tribe Pandionis whose festival charges
I took upon me, by the spirit of Solon and Draco, by unmuzzled statesmen
and a free people, by martial levies and naval organization, by the
virtues and the victories of our fathers, by the affection of fellow
citizens who have crowned me many a time, and by the might of a Greece
whose guardian I have never ceased to be. Or again, if life is to be
owed to compassion, though it be mean enough, yet compassion I might
endure among the kindred of the captives I have ransomed, the fathers
whose daughters I have helped to portion, and the men whose debts I have
joined in paying*.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="163:46">46</span></span>*But if the
island empire and the sea may not save me, I ask my safety from the
Posidon at whose altar and under whose sanctuary I stand. And if
Posidon's power avails not to keep his temple inviolate, if he scorns
not to surrender Demosthenes to Archias, then welcome death; I will not
transfer my worship to Antipater. I might have had Macedonia more at my
devotion than Athens, might be now a partaker in your fortunes, if I
would have ranged myself with Callimedon, and Pytheas, and Demades. When
things were far gone, I might yet have made a shift, if I had not had
respect to the daughters of Erechtheus and to Codrus. Fortune might
desert, I would not follow her; for death is a haven of safety, which he
who reaches will do no baseness more. Archias, I will not be at this
late day a stain upon the name of Athens; I will not make choice of
slavery; be my winding-sheet the white one of liberty*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="163:47">47</span></span>*Sir actor, let
me recall to you a fine passage from one of your tragedies* <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_21.md):

       *But even at the point of death  
She forethought took to fall in seemly wise*.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *She was but a
girl; and shall Demosthenes choose an unseemly life before a seemly
death, and forget what Xenocrates and Plato have said of immortality?*
And then he was stirred to some bitter speech upon men puffed up by
fortune. What remains to tell? At last, as I now besought and now
threatened, mingling the stern and mild, 'Had I been Archias,' he said,
'I had yielded; but seeing that I am Demosthenes, your pardon, good sir,
if my nature recoils from baseness.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="163:48">48</span></span>Then I was
minded to hale him off by force. Which when he observed, I saw him smile
and glance at the God. *Archias* (he said) *believes that there is no
might, no refuge for the human soul, but arms and war-ships, walls and
camps. He scorns that equipment of mine which is proof against Illyrians
and Triballi* 

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

*and Macedonians, surer than that wooden wall* <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) *of old, which the God averred none should
prevail against. Secure in this I ever took a fearless course; fearless
I braved the might of Macedonia; little I cared for Euctemon or
Aristogiton, for Pytheas and Callimedon, for Philip in the old days, for
Archias to-day.*

*And then, Lay no hand upon me. Be it not mine to bring* <span
class="margnote"><span id="164:49">49</span></span> *outrage upon the
temple; I will but greet the God, and follow of my free will. And for
me, I put reliance upon this, and when he lifted his hand to his mouth,
I thought it was but to do obeisance*.

*Ant*. And it was indeed--?

*Ar*. We put his servant to the question later, and learned from her
that he had long had poison by him, to give him liberty by parting soul
from body. He had not yet passed the holy threshold, when he fixed his
eye on me and said: 'Take *this* to Antipater; Demosthenes you shall not
take, no, by------' And methought he would have added, by the men that
fell at Marathon.

And with that farewell he parted. So ends, O King, the <span
class="margnote"><span id="164:50">50</span></span> siege of
Demosthenes.

*Ant*. Archias, that was Demosthenes. Hail to that unconquerable soul!
how lofty the spirit, how republican the care, that would never be
parted from their warrant of freedom! Enough; the man has gone his way,
to live the life they tell of in the Isles of the heroic Blest, or to
walk the paths that, if tales be true, the heaven-bound spirits tread;
he shall attend, surely, on none but that Zeus who is named of Freedom.
For his body, we will send it to Athens, a nobler offering to that land
than the men that died at Marathon. H.
