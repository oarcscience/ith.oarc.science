# DIALOGUES OF THE HETAERAE

### III

*Philinna. Her Mother*

*Mother*. You must be mad, Philinna; what *was* the matter with you at
the dinner last night? Diphilus was in tears this morning when he came
and told me how he had been treated. You were tipsy, he said, and made
an exhibition of yourself, dancing when he asked you not to; then you
kissed his friend Lamprias, and when Diphilus did not like that, you
left him

and went and put your arms round Lamprias; and he choking with rage all
the time. And afterwards you would not go near him, but let him cry by
himself, and kept singing and teasing him.

Phi. Ah, mother, he never told you how *he* behaved; if you knew how
rude he was, you would not take his part. He neglected me and made up to
Thais, Lamprias's girl, before Lamprias came. I was angry, and let him
see what I thought of him, and then he took hold of Thais's ear, bent
her neck back and gave her--oh, such a kiss! I thought it would never
end. So I began to cry; but he only laughed, and kept whispering to
her--about me, of course; Thais was looking at me and smiling. However,
when they heard Lamprias coming, and had had enough of each other at
last, I did take my place by him all the same, not to give him an excuse
for a fuss afterwards. It was Thais got up and danced first, showing her
ankles ever so much, as if no one else had pretty ones. And when she
stopped, Lamprias never said a word, but Diphilus praised her to the
skies--such perfect time! such varied steps! foot and music always
right; and what a lovely ankle! and so on, and so on; it might have been
the *Sosandra* of Calamis he was complimenting, and not Thais; what she
is really like, *you* know well enough. And how she insulted me, too!
'If some one is not ashamed of her spindle-shanks,' she said, 'she will
get up and dance now.' Well, that is all, mammy; of course I did get up
and dance. What was I to do? take it quietly and make her words seem
true and let her be queen?

*Mother*. You are too touchy, my lass; you should have taken no notice.
But go on.

*Phi*. Well, the others applauded, but Diphilus lay on his back and
looked up at the ceiling, till I was tired and gave up. Mother. But what
about kissing Lamprias? is that true?

and going across and embracing him? Well, why don't you speak? Those are
things I cannot forgive.

*Phi*. I wanted to pay him out.

*Mother*. And then not sitting near him! singing while he was in tears!
Think how poor we are, girl; you forget how much we have had from him,
and what last winter would have been if Aphrodite had not sent him to
us.

*Phi*. I dare say! and I am to let him outrage my feelings just for
that?

*Mother*. Oh, be as angry as you like, but no tit for tat. You ought to
know that if a lover's feelings are outraged his love ends, and he finds
out his folly. You have always been too hard on the lad; pull too tight,
and the rope breaks, you know.

H.
