### NOTES EXPLANATORY OF ALLUSIONS TO PERSONS, &c.

These notes are collected here instead of being put at the foot of pages
in order to avoid repetition, and also that they may not be obtruded on
those who do not need them. No connected account of the persons or
things commented upon is to be looked for, the intention being merely to
give the particular facts that will make Lucian's meaning clear. When a
name is not given, it may be taken either that we are unable, or that we
have considered it unnecessary, to add to the information contained in
the text.

References in italics are to pieces in the translation, the number, if
any, indicating the section. References in capitals are to articles in
these Notes.

The Notes are intended to be used by the reader whenever he wishes for
information upon a name. Reference is not made to them at the foot of
pages in the text unless there would be a difficulty in knowing what
name to consult.

ACADEMY. A grove or garden in the suburbs of Athens, in which Plato
taught; afterwards used as a name for the school of philosophy that
acknowledged him as its founder. For Plato's characteristic doctrines,
see under PLATO. Lucian's references to the school are (1) as eristic or
argumentative. The Socratic method of eliciting truth being by
discussion, and the Academy being descended from Socrates through Plato,
it might be regarded as especially argumentative. (2) as disputing the
possibility of judgement, and urging suspension. The Academy is divided
into the Old, Middle, and New; of which the Middle Academy neglected the
positive teachings of Plato, and developed rather the destructive
analytic method of Socrates.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

human life.

CECROPS. The first king of Athens.

CELSUS. An Epicurean to whom Lucian addresses the *Alexander*. Origen,
in replying to a treatise against Christianity written by a Celsus,
accuses him of being an Epicurean; and Origen's Celsus has accordingly
been identified with Lucian's, but from Origen's own account of Celsus's
position

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

there is reason to doubt whether he could have been an Epicurean.

CHRYSIPPUS. 280-207 B.C. Regarded as the chief of the Stoic school,
which see, though Zeno was the actual founder. Chrys- = gold-. As to
Lucian's thrice-repeated allusion to his hellebore treatment, nothing
seems to be known; it was a recognized cure for madness; perhaps he took
it to cure himself of care for the ordinary human objects of pursuit.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

CINYRAS. Son of Apollo, priest of Aphrodite, and father of Adonis.

CLEANTHES. Stoic philosopher. Lucian's account of his death in The

abstain till he died.

Medea, who provided a poisoned robe, which Creusa putting on was burnt
to death.

CRITIUS and NESIOTES. Sculptors slightly earlier than Phidias. Their
group of the tyrannicides, set up 477 B.C., was famous. The passage in
*The Rhetorician's Vade-mecum* is the chief authority for their style.

CROESUS. King of Lydia, 560-546 B.C. To test Apollo's oracle, he asked
what he would be doing on a certain day. The answer was, 'boiling
tortoise and lamb,' which was correct. Thus convinced, he gave great
gifts to the oracle, including golden bricks, and, acting on another
oracle, which said that he by crossing the Halys should destroy a mighty
empire, attacked Cyrus, king of Persia, who subdued and deposed him.
Thus was verified the warning given to him by Solon, in the famous
conversation reported in the *Charon*. The story of his son Atys is
given in *Zeus Cross-examined* (12). His other son was born deaf and
dumb, but when his father was in danger from Cyrus's soldiers, was
enabled to say: Do not kill the king. His name is a commonplace for
wealth and vicissitudes.

CRONĬDES. 'Son of Cronus,' i.e. Zeus.

CRONOSOLON. Solon being known as a legislator, the name is meant to
suggest 'Cronus legislating' through his mouthpiece the priest.

CRONUS. King of Heaven in the dynasty of the Titans, which preceded that
of the Gods. Deprived his father Uranus of his virility and of his
government. Fearing dethronement from his own sons, he devoured them as
soon as born: his wife Rhea, however, concealed from him Zeus, Posidon,
and Pluto, the first of whom deposed him. The time of his reign was

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

looked back to as the Golden Age of plenty, equality, and virtue. The
Saturnalia, or feast of the Latin God Saturn, who was commonly
identified with Cronus, was a symbolic revival of that golden age.

CTESIAS. Author of (1) a long history of Persia, probably a really
valuable work, and (2) a treatise on India, the fables mixed up in which
caused him to be looked upon as an author who deserved no credit. He was
a Greek physician at the court of Artaxerxes Mnemon. Flourished about
401 B.C.

CYBELE. *See* RHEA.

CYCLŌPES. A one-eyed race of shepherds, or, according to another
account, of smiths in the service of Hephaestus, in Etna. Polyphemus,
the chief of them, was son of Posidon.

CYLLARABIS. A gymnasium in or near Argos, which would be unsuitable for
cultivation.

CYNAEGĪRUS. Brother of Aeschylus. At Marathon, pursuing the defeated
Persians, laid hold of one of their ships. His hand being cut off,
substituted the other; that cut off, gripped it with his teeth.

CYNICS. A school of philosophers, so called either because Antisthenes
the Athenian, their founder (born 444. B.C.), and a pupil of Socrates,
taught in the gymnasium called the Cynosarges, or else because their
mode of life was regarded as no better than that of a dog (cyn-).
Diogenes, Crates, Menippus, and (in his own time) Demonax, are mentioned
by Lucian as favourable specimens of the school. Their ideal may be
said, to have been plain living and high thinking; virtue is the only
good; the essence of virtue is self-control; pleasure is an evil if
sought for itself. The dialogue called *The Cynic* gives a not unfair
view of their asceticism. *The Peregrine* and *The Runaways* illustrate
the abuses to which this philosophy was liable, owing to the small
intellectual demand it made, and the pride it generated. The Cynics were
cosmopolitan, individualist, and

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

outspoken; their repulsive personal negligence, and their free use of
their philosophic staves as offensive weapons, are often alluded to.

CYNURIA *See* OTHRYADES.

CYRENAICS. Aristippus, the founder of this school, was a disciple of
Socrates, but developed only the practical side of his master's
philosophy. Since the only things of which we can be absolutely certain
are our sensations of pleasure and pain, all our actions should be
calculated with a view to securing the one and avoiding the other. The
principle is not so debased as it sounds, since there are higher and
lower pleasures, present and future gratifications. Epicureanism and
modern Utilitarianism are developments.

CYRUS. The Great. King of Persia, 559-529 B.C.

 

DAEDALUS. A famous artificer. He, with his son Icarus, fled from Minos,
king of Crete, by means of wings fastened on with wax. He himself
arrived safely in Italy; but Icarus flying too high, the wax melted, his
wings dropped off, and he fell into the sea that was afterwards called
after him.

DANAË. Daughter of Acrisius (upon whose name there is a jest in the
*Demonax*), king of Argos. Her father, anxious that she should not have
a child, confined her in a brazen tower: but, Zeus visiting her in a
shower of gold, she gave birth to Perseus. Mother and child were thrown
into the sea in a chest, but were saved.

DANAÏDS. When the fifty sons of Aegyptus followed the daughters of
Danaüs to Greece, and demanded them in marriage, Danaüs consented, but
supplied each of them with a dagger to kill her husband on the bridal
night. Their punishment was to pour water perpetually into a leaky cask.

DAPHNE. *See* APOLLO.

DAVUS. Stock name for a slave in Greek comedies.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

DELPHI. On the Gulf of Corinth, below Mount Parnassus; an oracle of

DEMOSTHENES (1). One of the most distinguished Athenian generals in the
Peloponnesian war. *See* BRASIDAS. Put to death by the Syracusans on the
failure of the Sicilian expedition.

DEMOSTHENES (2). The Athenian orator. His father was a rich manufacturer
of arms. Being defrauded by his guardians, took to oratory first for the
purpose of suing them. His self-training is famous; the allusions in the
*Demosthenes* are thus explained: he lived in a cave to study
undisturbed, shaving half his head to keep him there, studied his
gestures in a mirror

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

and corrected a shrug by hanging a naked sword over his shoulders,
improved his articulation and voice by holding pebbles in his mouth and
shouting at the waves, took lessons from Satyrus the actor, copied out
Thucydides eight times. The great object of his life was to keep Greece
and especially Athens free from subjection to Macedon.

ORITHYIA. Daughter of Erechtheus, king of Athens. Carried off by Boreas.

ORPHEUS. A Thracian musician, son of the Muse Calliope. His music
charmed wild beasts, trees, and rocks, and prevailed upon Pluto to
restore his wife Eurydice, on condition that Orpheus should not look
back to see that she was following him; this condition not being
observed, Eurydice remained in Hades. Orpheus was afterwards torn in
pieces by the Thracian women, and his head and lyre thrown into the
Hebrus, and carried to Lesbos.

OSIRIS. An Egyptian king, deified after death, as the husband of Isis.

OSROËS. Son of Vologesus I. A king of Parthia, engaged in war with the

between their king Vologesus III and Rome, 162-165 A. D., was conducted
on the Roman side by the Emperor Lucius Verus. He brought it to a
successful conclusion, more by the merits of his lieutenants, Cassius
and Statius Priscus, than his own.

PARTHONĪCE. 'Conquest of the Parthians,' quoted as an affected
poetical-sounding title.

PATROCLUS. Friend and follower of Achilles, who, when he sulked himself,
lent him his armour, in which Patroclus won great renown; but Apollo
struck him senseless, Euphorbus ran him through, and Hector gave him the
last fatal blow.

Spartan invasions in the Peloponnesian war brought the country Attics
into the town.

PELEUS. Father of Achilles.

PĔLIAS. King of Iolcus, usurper of his nephew Jason's rights. When Medea
restored Jason's father Aeson to youth by cutting him to pieces and
boiling him, she persuaded the daughters of Pelias to try the same
system with their father, which resulted in his death.

PELOPIDS. The descendants of Pelops, many of them, as Atreus and
Thyestes, Agamemnon and Menelaus, Orestes, Electra and Iphigenia, famous
in tragic story.

PENELOPE. Wife of Odysseus.

PENTHEUS. King of Thebes, resisted the introduction of Dionysus's rites;
the God caused his Bacchantes, among them Pentheus's mother Agave, to
tear him to pieces in their frenzy.

PERDICCAS. One of Alexander's generals, who, on the strength of the
dying king's having handed him his ring, claimed the succession, but was
defeated by the combination of Ptolemy, Antipater, and other generals,
and finally assassinated.

PEREGRINE. Nothing can be added to Lucian's description of him in the
*Death of Peregrine*, but that he is a historical character.

PERIANDER. Son of Cypselus, and tyrant of Corinth. A patron of
literature, and one of the Seven Sages.

PERICLES. Greatest of Athenian statesmen. A pupil of Anaxagoras. He was
nicknamed 'Olympian.' Lucian mentions his funeral speech, delivered in
435 B.C., and his intercourse with the famous Milesian courtesan
Aspasia, by whom he had a son Pericles.

PERIPATETICS. Aristotle of Stagira (385-323 B.C.), the founder of this
school of philosophers, studied for twenty years under Plato. In 335
B.C. he began teaching independently in the

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lyceum, a public
garden at Athens. The name Peripatetic refers to his habit of walking
about while lecturing. Forty-six of his works remain, though perhaps
only in the form of notes. They are remarkable for the rigidly
systematic treatment applied to all subjects alike, to Ethics and
Poetry, not less than to Zoology and Mechanics. Most notable of his
doctrines is that which refers all definable things to four Causes,
viz., Matter, the existence of which is Potentiality, and the Moving,
Final, and Formal Causes, whose operation is included under the general
term Energy; the combination of Potentiality and Energy resulting in the
perfection of the completed thing. The *summum bonum*, according to
Aristotle, is Eudaemonia (Happiness); and each virtue is the mean
between the excess and defect of some quality. The virtuous mean between
avarice and profuseness, or between luxury and asceticism, might perhaps
involve that respect for money with which Lucian reproaches the
Peripatetics. The ten Categories, or Predicaments, were an attempt to
classify all existing things; among them were Substance, Quality,
Quantity, Relation, Time, and Place.

PERSEPHONE. Daughter of Zeus and Demeter. Pluto, with the permission of
Zeus, carried her down to Hades. Demeter, discovering the truth after a
long search, left Heaven in anger, and took up her abode on earth. Zeus
now ordered Pluto to restore Persephone: as, however, she had partaken
of food in the lower world, she was compelled to return thither for
one-third of each year.

PERSEUS. His story is given under DANAE, GORGONS, and ANDROMEDA.

PHAEACIANS. A fabulous people described in the Odyssey as inhabiting

was.

PHAETHON. Son of Helius and Clymene. Being allowed on one occasion to
drive the chariot of the sun, he lost control of the horses, and almost
consumed the earth with fire. Zeus slew him with a thunderbolt, and cast
him into the river Eridanus. His sisters, changed into poplars on its
banks, wept tears of amber for his loss.

statue of Zeus at Olympia was his work.

PHILIP OF MACEDON. King, 359-336 B.C. Raised Macedon from an
insignificant State to the mistress of Greece, and made possible the
conquests of his son Alexander by his organization. Used diplomacy as
much as arms to effect his ends, and systematically bribed persons in
the states opposed to him, especially in Athens.

PHILIPPIDES. More usually called Phidippides.

PHILO. The person to whom Lucian addresses *The Way to write History* is
unknown.

PHILOCRATES. Prominent Athenian, probably in the pay of Philip, into
whose hands he constantly played.

PHILOCTĒTES. Armour-bearer of Heracles, inherited his bow. Left at
Lemnos on the way to Troy, because a wound from a snake-bite rendered
him offensive by its stench. Later, an

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

oracle declaring the bow necessary for the capture of Troy, Odysseus
went and induced him to come.

PHILOSOPHY. Lucian is fond of ridiculing the different schools of
philosophy, some for their paradoxical choice of ends, some for their
hypocrisy in practically disregarding their own precepts. The regulation
philosophic garb and appearance also comes in for satire; it consisted
of threadbare cloak, wallet, and staff, with long beard. A brief account
of the chief schools will be found under ACADEMY, CYNICS, CYRENAICS,
PERIPATETICS, STOICS, EPICUREANS, SCEPTICS, PLATO, PYTHAGORAS.

PHILOXENUS. A poet, who, for his severe criticism of a poem of Dionysius
I, was imprisoned in the Syracusan quarries. The tyrant, having pardoned
him and invited him to dinner, recited another poem he had composed.
Asked his opinion of it, Philoxenus made no direct reply, but said,
'Take me back to the quarries.

children; and *see* HARPIES.

PHLEGETHON. 'Burning,' one of the infernal rivers.

PHOCION. Athenian statesman and general, died 318 B.C.; distinguished
for virtue, moderation, and poverty.

cremated itself, another rising from its ashes.

PHOLUS. *See* HERACLES.

PHRIXUS. *See* ATHAMAS.

PHRYGIANS. Troy being in Phrygia, 'Phrygians' is often used for
'Trojans.'

PHRYNE. Famous Athenian courtesan, 328 B.C.

Demosthenes especially with Philocrates.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

who killed travellers by fastening them to the top of a pine bent down
and then allowed to spring up. He was killed by Theseus in the same way.

PLATAEA. A town in Boeotia, near which the final battle of the
Graeco-Persian war was fought, 478 B.C. The Persians were defeated.

PLATO. An Athenian philosopher (428-347 B.C.), and pupil of Socrates,
whom in his dialogues he often makes the mouthpiece of his own
doctrines. He studied in Africa, Egypt, Italy, and Sicily, and returned
to Athens in 386 B.C. to lecture in the gymnasium of the Academy. He
paid three visits to the Syracusan court of Dionysius I and II. The
Platonic theory of Ideas is an attempt to secure accuracy of definition
(which is the first step towards knowledge), by contemplation of those
abstract types or Ideas of things, of which external objects are in
every case only an imperfect manifestation, and which are perceptible to
us by reason of our familiarity with them in a previous existence; for
the soul is immortal, and what we call the acquisition of knowledge is
in fact only recollection. In his *Republic* we have a sketch of a model
state, in which philosophers are to be kings, and community of women is
recommended as a means of securing scientific breeding.

PLUTO. 'Rich' in dead, according to Lucian's derivation; also called
Hades. Drew lots with his brothers Zeus and Posidon, and received the
Lower World for his share. His wife was Persephone.

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

opened his school, which was accordingly often spoken of as 'The Porch.'

POENAE. 'Punishments.' Infernal spirits, akin to the Erinyes.

POLEMON. Athenian philosopher, head of the Academy, 315 B.C. Had been
dissolute in youth, but was converted, as related in *The Double
Indictment*, by Xenocrates.

POLIAS. *See* ATHENE.

POLLUX (1). *See* CASTOR.

POLLUX (2). *See* HERODES.

POLUS (1). A rhetorician of Agrigentum, pupil of Gorgias, with whom he
is introduced by Plato in the *Gorgias*.

POLUS (2). A celebrated tragic actor.

POLYCLITUS. 452-412 B.C. A Sicyonian sculptor, reckoned the equal of
Phidias. His 'canon' was a bronze statue in which he exemplified the
principles that he had laid down in a book to which he gave the same
name. The *Diadumenus*, or youth tying on a fillet, was one of his most
famous works.

POLYCRATES. Powerful tyrant of Samos. Frightened by his excessive
prosperity, tried to propitiate Nemesis by throwing into the sea a ring
that he prized highly; but a fisherman found it in a fish, and returned
it, a sign that his offering was rejected. He was lured to Asia by
Oroetes, satrap of Sardis, and by him crucified, 522 B.C.

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

POLYDĂMAS. Olympic victor, 408 B.C. Marvellous stories are told of his
strength.

willingly, and was slain by Neoptolemus at his father's tomb.

PORCH, THE. *See* POECILE and STOICS.

PORUS. *See* ALEXANDER (1).

POSIDON. Son of Cronus, brother of Zeus and Pluto, received the sea as
his province. Assisted Apollo in building the walls of Troy for
Laomedon.

PRAXITELES. Athenian sculptor, 364 B.C. With Scopas, headed the later
Attic school, known less for sublimity than beauty. The Cnidian
*Aphrodite* was his.

PRIĀPUS. Son of Dionysus and Aphrodite, worshipped especially at
Lampsacus.

PRŎDĬCUS. Sophist of Ceos, often at Athens, where Socrates is said to
have attended his lectures, about 430 B.C. Spoken of by Plato with more
respect than most sophists, and famous for his apologue of *The Choice
of Heracles*, between Pleasure and Virtue.

PROETUS. *See* BELLEROPHON.

PROMETHEUS. Son of Iapetus, and therefore first cousin of Zeus, who
nailed him up on the Caucasus, and instructed an eagle to devour his
liver, which grew again each night. The provocation had been threefold:
(1) Prometheus, forming clay figures, had persuaded Athene to breathe
life into them, and thus created man; (2) he had stolen fire from Heaven
for the

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

use of man; (3) by dividing a slain animal into two portions, one
consisting of bones wrapped up in fat, the other of the lean parts, and
persuading Zeus to choose the former as his share, he had secured the
more desirable portion of sacrificial animals for man. The confusion of
the sexes alluded to in the *Literary Prometheus* (7) is perhaps drawn
from Plato's account in the *Symposium* of the creation of double
beings, who possessed the characteristics of both sexes, and referred by
Lucian to Prometheus on his own responsibility; though in Phaedrus
(Fables, iv. 54) Prometheus is charged with a confusion of the sexes in
a different sense.

PROTESILAÜS. A Thessalian, son of Iphiclus, and the first Greek slain by
the Trojans. Permitted to return to life for a few hours to see his wife
Laodamia.

PROTEUS. The prophetic old man of the sea, from whom it was only
possible to obtain information by seizing him; this was difficult, as he
changed into many different shapes. Peregrine (whom see) took the name
of Proteus.

PTOLEMY (1). Son of Lagus, surnamed Soter. A general of Alexander, and
afterwards king of Egypt. Died 283 B.C.

PTOLEMY (2) Philadelphus, son of Ptolemy Soter. Married his sister
Arsinoe, 309-247 B.C.

PTOLEMY (3) Dionysus. King of Egypt, 80-51 B.C.

PUZZLES. Lucian is never tired of ridiculing the verbal quibbles in
which the philosophers of his time indulged. He attributes them
especially to the Stoics, whose insistence on pure reason, as opposed to
emotion, for the guide of life, resulted in much attention to logic,
including its paradoxical forms. Among these logical puzzles are the
following: (1) Sorites, the heap trick. Suppose a heap of corn. Is it a
heap? Yes. Take a grain away. Is it a heap? Yes. And so on, till only
one grain is left. The drawing of the line is impossible. (2) The Horns.
If you have not lost a thing, you still have it?

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Certainly. Have
you lost your horns? No. Then you are horned. (3) The Crocodile. A child
is caught by a crocodile; the father asks him to give it back. I will,
says the crocodile, on condition that you tell me correctly whether I
shall do so or not. The dilemma is obvious. (4) The Day and Night. This
appears to be a proof that there is no such thing as night, through the
ambiguity in 'Day being, Night cannot be,' which in Greek, though not in
English, is equally natural in the sense of Since it is day, it cannot
be night, and, If day exists, night cannot. (5) The Reaper. I will prove
to you that you will not reap your corn, thus. If you reap it, you will
not either-reap-or-not-reap, but reap. If you do not reap it, you will
not either-reap-or-not-reap, but not reap. So in each case you will not
either reap or not reap, that is, there will be no reaping. (6) The
Rightful Owner. Unexplained; but *see* Epictetus, ii, xix. (7) and (8)
The Electra, and The Man in the Hood, sufficiently explained in *Sale of
Creeds* (22).

PYANEPSION. An Attic month.

PYLADES. Cousin and friend of Orestes.

PYRRHUS. Stock name for a slave. Used jestingly in Sale of Creeds
instead of Pyrrho.

PYRRHO. Of Elis. About 300 B.C. Gave up painting to become a
philosopher, and was the founder of the Sceptics.

PYRRHUS. King of Epirus, 295-272 B.C. The greatest general of his time,
won several victories over the Romans.

PYTHAGORAS. Born at Samos, settled at Croton in Italy. 580-510 B.C. The
early Ionic philosophers, as Thales and Heraclitus, had found the origin
of all things in some one principle, as water, or fire. Pythagoras found
it in number and proportion; hence the name Order (κόσμος), which he
first gave to the universe; hence also the mystic importance attached to
certain numbers, e. g. the Decad, called Tetractys (which we

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

have translated 'quaternion') as made by the addition of the first four
integers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4= 10), and the Pentagram, or figure resulting
from the production of all the sides of a regular pentagon till they
intersect. Pythagoras had travelled in Egypt, and perhaps brought thence
his most famous doctrines of the immortality of the soul and
transmigration; he is said to have retained the memory of his own
previous existences, especially as Euphorbus the Trojan, whose shield he
recognized; human knowledge, for him as for Plato, would be accounted
for as recollection from earlier lives. He instituted a brotherhood of
his disciples, with elaborate training and different degrees; and the
Pythagorean 'Ipse dixit,' implying that what the master had said was not
open to argument, marks the strict subordination; a novice had to
observe silence for five years. Pythagoras left no writings, and this,
combined with the mystic character of his speculations on number and his
specially authoritative position, gave occasion to innumerable legends,
misrepresentations, and extensions. The Pythagorean prohibition of beans
as food has never been explained; *see* Mayor's note on Juv. xv. 174.
The usual account is that he thought the souls of his parents might be
in them. The story of his appearing at the Olympic games with a golden
thigh is one of the later legends illustrative of his supposed
assumption of superhuman qualities, which made him the model of
impostors or half-impostors like Apollonius of Tyana, Alexander of
Abonutichus, or Paracelsus.

PYTHEAS. An Athenian orator, of disreputable character; an enemy of
Demosthenes.

PYTHON. An eloquent Byzantine orator in the pay of Philip of Macedon.

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

RHEA, or CYBELE. Daughter of Uranus and Ge, wife of Cronus, and mother
of Zeus, Hera, Posidon, Pluto, Hestia, and Demeter. Her worship,
celebrated by the Corybantes and the Galli, was of a wild and
enthusiastic character. She is commonly represented as being drawn by
lions. *See also under* ATTIS.

SARDANAPĀLUS. Last king of the Assyrian empire of Nineveh. Lucian's
favourite type of luxury and effeminacy.

SARPĒDON. Son of Zeus and Laodamia, slain in the Trojan war by
Patroclus.

SATURNALIA. The feast of the Latin God Saturn, held in the month of
December. During the feast, all ranks devoted themselves to merriment,
presents were exchanged, and public gambling was officially recognized.
A mock king was also chosen, who could impose forfeits on his subjects.
Lucian does not speak of the Saturnalia by that name, but only of the
feast of Cronus, with whom Saturn was identified; and in some cases it
is possible that he refers to a feast of Cronus himself.

SATYRS. Beings connected with the worship of Dionysus, and represented
with snub noses, horns, and tails.

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

SELEUCUS. Surnamed Nicator. First king of Syria, 312280 B.C. For his
wife Stratonice *see* ANTIOCHUS.

SEMELE. Daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia. Beloved by Zeus. Incited by the
machinations of Hera, she prevailed upon Zeus against his will to appear
to her in all his splendour. His lightnings consumed her; but the child
Dionysus, with whom she was pregnant, was saved by Zeus, and matured
within his thigh.

SEMIRĂMIS and her husband Ninus were the founders of the Assyrian empire
of Nineveh. Her date is placed at about 2000 B.C. She built numerous
cities.

lower world by having to roll a stone up hill, which as soon as he
reached the top always fell to the bottom again

SOCRATES. Son of Sophroniscus and Phaenarete, 469-399 B.C.

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He abandoned
sculpture (his father's profession) for the study of philosophy, in
which he was remarkable for the preference that he gave to ethics over
physics, and for the method of dialectic, or logical conversation
carried on by means of question and answer, for the purpose of eliciting
accurate definition. He was frequently ridiculed on the comic stage by
Aristophanes and other poets. In 399 B.C. a charge of impiety was
brought against him by Anytus and Meletus, and he was condemned to drink
hemlock. Socrates served with credit at the battle of Delium, 424 B.C.
An oracle given to his disciple Chaerephon pronounced Socrates to be the
wisest of men: Socrates himself claimed to know one thing only--that he
knew nothing. Lucian alludes to his favourite oaths, the dog and
plane-tree. For the (Platonic) theory of Ideas, and the community of
women, *see* PLATO.

SOLI. A city on the coast of Cilicia, proverbial for the bad Greek
spoken there.

SOLON. A famous Athenian legislator, 594 B.C. Said to have visited
Croesus of Lydia.

SOPHIST. At Athens this word denoted in particular a paid teacher of
grammar, rhetoric, politics, mathematics, &c. Lucian sometimes uses it
also for 'philosopher,' and perhaps sometimes in the modern sense of a
quibbler.

SOPHRONISCUS. Father of Socrates.

SPARTANS. Among the means adopted to train the youths in fortitude were
competitive scourgings at the altar of Artemis Orthia, which must be
endured without sign of distress.

STESICHŎRUS. Lyric poet of Himera, 612 B.C. Lost his sight after
lampooning Helen, and only recovered it by composing a retractation,
'palinode.'

STHENEBOEA. Another name for Antea; *see* BELLEROPHON.

STOICS School of philosophy, so called from the Stoa Poecile, or Painted
Porch, at Athens, in which Zeno their

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

founder taught. Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus, were the first three heads,
starting 310 B.C. Stoicism was a great influence among the Romans, as
with the emperor M. Aurelius. Its aim was purely practical, to make man
independent of his surroundings. The 'wise man,' who formed his views on
pure reason, would recognize that virtue or duty was the only end, and
that pleasure and pain, wealth, power, and everything else that did not
depend on his own choice, were 'things indifferent.' He would ultimately
attain to 'apathy,' and be completely unmoved by the ordinary objects of
desire or aversion, being, in whatever external condition, the 'only
king,' the 'only happy.' They paid great attention to logic, much
reasoning being necessary to establish these paradoxes, whence their
reputation for verbal quibbles, and their elaborate technical terms for
the relations between sensation and the mental processes. Later Stoics
relaxed the severity of the 'indifference ' doctrine by dividing
*indifferentia* into *praeposita* and *rejecta*; e. g. health was to be
preferred to sickness, though virtue was consistent with either. This
would open the door to the preference of wealth, and account for
Lucian's sneer at Stoic usurers. The Stoic physics was a materialistic
pantheism.

STRATONICE. *See* ANTIOCHUS.

 

STYX. 'Loathing,' one of the infernal rivers. The oath by it was the
only one that could bind the Immortals.

of Hera. Zeus now became the father of Persephone by Demeter, of the
