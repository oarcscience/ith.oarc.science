### THERE IS A TIME FOR LYING

LEONTICHOS (*Bombastically*)

And what about the battle with the Galateans, Chenidas? Do you remember
how I rode my white charger ahead of all our horsemen and how the
Galateans, who are pretty brave fellows at that, trembled as soon as
they saw me, so that not a warrior among them dared to face me. And
then, throwing my javelin, I pierced their hipparchos and his mount. As
for those that reassembled--for after their phalanx was broken, some
Galateans reorganized as a square--I attacked them sword in hand. The
sudden burst forward of my faithful steed knocked over the first seven.
With a swing of my blade I hacked in halves the head of their chief. Our
men then came up, but the enemy was already in flight.

CHENIDAS

And do you recall Paphlagonia, Leontichos? You did grand work in that
country too. Do you remember

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

how, single-handed, you engaged the Satrap himself?

LEONTICHOS

Thanks for reminding me of the event. The Satrap, you know, had the
build of a giant. He was reputed to be an extraordinary swordsman, and
held us Greeks in contempt. Now one afternoon he rode forward between
the two armies and shouted: "Who wants to brave a fight with me?"

Fright seized our men. The lochages, the taxiarchs, and even our
hegemon, who is far from cowardly (it was Aristachmos the Aitolian who
commanded us then; he is handy with the javelin), all were rather
nervous about the challenge. At that time I wasn't even a chiliarch. But
in a spontaneous fit of recklessness, pushing away those among my
friends who tried to hold me back (for they had their doubts as to my
safety, the barbarian Hercules seemed so formidable in his gilded armor,
as he stood before our army shaking his huge plumed head and brandishing
his enormous javelin), I----- I------

CHENIDAS

I confess that I myself was among those who were worried about your
safety, Leontichos. You remember how I tried to detain you, pleading
with my beloved Leontichos not to sacrifice himself for our sake. Many

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

of our Greeks would have found life unbearable without the comradeship
of the brave Leontichos.

LEONTICHOS

But I, in a reckless burst to the fore, I advanced towards the haughty
enemy. I was as well armed as the Paphlagonian; I, too, was harnessed in
gold. Upon my appearance in view of all, a cry arose from both armies,
for I was recognized, especially by my shield, my martial ornaments and
helmet plume. Let us hear a word, Chenidas! Tell us now, whom did
everybody compare me with?

CHENIDAS

By Dzeus, whom could we have compared you with at that moment, if not to
Achilles, the son of Thetis and Peleus? How well your helmet suited you!
And the purple of your cloak shone like--my, I can't think of what! Your
shield made bolts of lightning in the air.

LEONTICHOS

And when we met--well, the barbarian was the first to draw blood. Oh! he
scratched me a bit, below the knee, you know. But I--one well aimed blow
and my reliable sarissee tore thru his heavy shield and wounded him in
the chest. He fell at my feet, more from surprise than weakness. Then I
stood on his body for a

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

while. There was only one thing to do. Drawing my sword, I cut off the
Satrap's head. Well, I gathered his collection of arms and returned to
our side with the giant's head stuck on the spike of my sarissee. Blood
from the dissevered head dripped on my own. You can imagine the applause
that greeted me upon my return.

HYMNIS (*Nauseated*)

Ah, go away, you sickening Leontichos! What disgusting stories you
tell!;: Who could look at you, least of all applaud you, after that
bloody mess? Do you believe I could force myself to sleep with you after
your tales of killing and blood? I am going away.

LEONTICHOS

Please don't go. I'll pay you doubly; but don't go away.

HYMNIS

I can not go to bed with an assassin.

LEONTICHOS

Don't be afraid of me, Hymnis. All that happened in the country of the
Paphlagonians. I am at peace right now.

HYMNIS

No, I don't want you. You are an abominable man. From the barbarian's
head stuck on your sarissee

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

blood dripped down on your own head. And you expect me to take an odious
man like you in my arms and kiss you! By the Charites, never, never will
I kiss you! A man like you is no better than an executioner.

LEONTICHOS

Ah, if you could see me in arms! I am sure you would fall in love with
Leontichos.

HYMNIS

Why, only hearing your cruel tales is enough to make me feel sick at
heart and hate you. I imagine seeing shadows about us; these must be the
phantoms of your victims. Surely the poor chief whose head you had split
in two is among them. And how I would feel if I saw the fight and the
blood and the corpses stretched in the mud! I believe I'd die. I could
never bear to see the smallest animal killed.

LEONTICHOS

What a dear little coward you are, Hymnis! I thought you would find my
story amusing.

HYMNIS

Go and tell such stories to the Lemnians or the fifty daughters of
Danais, if you find any. They will find them amusing. I will sleep in my
mother's house tonight. Follow me, Grammis. Take good care of

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

yourself this night, valiant chiliarch! And do not kill too many! (*She
leaves*.)

LEONTICHOS

Stay, O Hymnis, stay!------Oh, she is gone!

CHENIDAS

It is your own fault, Leontichos. You have scared the child with your
cock-and-bull stories. I saw her turn yellow when you started your tale
about the captain. And her eyes stood out and she shivered when you
described how you cut off the Satrap's head.

LEONTICHOS

I thought she'd like me the more. But it was you who lost me altogether
by putting in my head the idea of the duel.

CHENIDAS

I wanted to help you. But it was you, yourself, who made the story too
horrible for the girl's tastes. You could have had your dirty
Paphlagonian head without having it stuck on the end of a sarissee and
without smearing yourself with the Satrap's blood.

LEONTICHOS

It is true. My story was a bit too strong for the likes of Hymnis. The
rest, however, wasn't so badly imagined. Won't you help an old comrade
in trouble,

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Chenidas? Please
run after her. Persuade her to go to bed with me after all.

CHENIDAS

I'll tell her that you have invented those war stories in order to
appear brave in her eyes.

LEONTICHOS

That would be too shameful, Chenidas.

CHENIDAS

Otherwise, I am sure, she will not return. I am afraid, my friend, that
you must choose either to pass for a brave man and be hated, or to
confess that you have lied beautifully and sleep tonight with pretty
Hymnis. And by Aphrodite and Uranian, she is worth the shame of
confession! The girl has a body like the dream of a well-fed soldier.
Little, hard breasts like apples! Soft, resilient thighs that could
unman the most gigantic of Satraps! And those dimples! Ah, Mother of
Heaven, those dimples! The girl told you, Leontichos, before you started
on your stories, of course, that she had a third dimple that was much
more attractive. A third dimple! Ah, a third dimple! Oh, comrade, I know
you will either humble yourself this evening or pass a sleepless night.
I, myself, am to see Ampelis, who is, to all appearances, twice the age
of

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

the little Aphrodite whom my Mars has just scared away.

LEONTICHOS (*Very embarrassed*)

You are right. I must choose. But either alternative is hard on a
fellow. However, my hand is for the sword. I prefer Hymnis. Run,
therefore, Chenidas, and tell her that Leontichos has lied a little.
Yes, tell her I have lied--but not altogether.
