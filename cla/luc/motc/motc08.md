### THE TERROR OF MARRIAGE

MYRTION

You are going to marry the daughter of Pheidon, the pilot. Possibly you
have already married her. All your vows, all your tears, all your
promises, have gone the way of smoke. You have forgotten Myrtion, now
that I am in a family way--it is the eighth month. Yes, a big belly is
all that is left me from your great love. Pretty soon I shall have to
feed an infant, a fine job for a courtesan. For I will never destroy
what I shall have brought forth, especially if it is a man-child. I
shall name the child Pamphilos and keep him as my consolation. And one
day your son will face you and reproach you for having deserted his
unfortunate mother.

I know it is not a beautiful girl you have chosen as your wife. I saw
her recently at the Thesmophorion games. She was with her mother. I did
not think at that time I should lose my Pamphilos on account of such a
creature. Why don't you inspect her more

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

closely? Examine her face and her eyes. One of these days you might be
sorry to have married a woman whose eyes squint. Indeed, they are like a
fish's.

But you have seen Pheidon, your fiancée's father. Well, all one needs is
to take a good look at his face; there is no need of seeing his daughter
after that.

PAMPHILOS

But you are talking nonsense, Myrtion. How long must I hear you talk
about pilots' daughters and marriages? Do I know if the bride in
question is squint-eyed, snub-nosed or beautiful, or if Pheidon, the
Alopekethian, (for it is of him you are talking, I believe) has an ugly
daughter? He isn't even a friend of my father's. I recall they had a
lawsuit recently over some matter of navigation. I think he owed my
father one talent and refused to pay; so that my father hailed him
before the maritime court. He had a hard time making the pilot yield;
Pheidon never paid the entire sum.

If I wanted to get married, would I have refused the hand of the
daughter of Demea who was *strategus* last year (she is my first cousin
on my mother's side) in order to marry the daughter of Pheidon, the
pilot? Where have you garnered such queer news? Are these chimeras the
inventions of your jealousy?

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

MYRTION

In that case it is not true you are getting married?

PAMPHILOS

You are either crazy or drunk, Myrtion. And strange to say, we had
little to drink last night.

MYRTION (*Pointing at her slave*)

It is Doris who has worried me with such ideas. I sent her to buy some
strips of wool for my belly and to make an offering to the Lokheia in my
behalf, and she said she met Lesbia, and Lesbia-------Tell it yourself,
Doris. Tell him what you have heard and seen. You are sure you haven't
made up the story?

DORIS

May I be run over and crushed by a chariot, if I have told a lie! I
never lie. When I was near the Prytaneion I bumped into Lesbia and she
stopped me and said with a smile:

"I hear your mistress' fine lover, Pamphilos, is getting married. He is
going to marry the daughter of Pheidon."

When I refused to believe it, she advised me to run down the street,
Pamphilos's street, and I would surely see garlands and flute players
and hear people singing the hymeneal chant.

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

MYRTION

And did you go to see?

DORIS

Certainly. And I found everything Lesbia mentioned..

PAMPHILOS

Now I understand your mistake. Lesbia did not actually fool you, Doris,
and you have without doubt imparted the truth to my Myrtion. However,
both of you permitted yourselves to become excited about nothing at all.
The marriage feast you are talking about is not being celebrated in our
house. I remember now that last night, upon my return home from your
side, dear Myrtion, my mother happened to remark:

"Pamphilos, your friend Charmides, the son of our neighbor Aristainetos,
is getting married to a good girl; he has curbed his wild desires and
become respectable. Till when, son, will you continue with your shameful
courtesans?"

I paid no attention to what my mother had to say. Those old folks will
never understand. I went to bed. I left my home at sunrise this morning,
so that I noticed absolutely nothing of what Doris was to see later. If
you don't believe me, Doris, return and examine with

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

care, not only the street, but also the door. You will see which door is
decorated with garlands.

MYRTION

You have saved my life, Pamphilos. I would have strangled myself.

PAMPHILOS

It will never, never happen. I am not so foolish. I will never forget my
Myrtion, especially when she carries a child of mine in her belly. How I
would like to lie with you now! You are even more beautiful with your
belly bulging big. Oh, Myrtion, let me!

MYRTION

Have me, dear Pamphilos! But lean lightly.
