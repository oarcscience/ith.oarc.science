### TRANSLATOR'S FOREWORD

In view of the constantly changing standards for adequate translations,
the task of the translator is not an easy one. A rendition which a few
years ago might have been entirely satisfactory would now be considered
literal, stilted and uninspired. And so, in our modern requirements for
an effective version, something more is demanded than a merely accurate
translation of words or even phrases; instead, a genuine appreciation of
atmosphere, spirit and intent is insisted upon.

The *Mimes of the Courtesans* presents no exception to this perpetual
problem of the translator. In fact, the task is intensified in this case
because of the informality of the dialogues and the racy, whimsical
style in which they are written. The frequent occurrence of
colloquialisms, of intimate and subtle humor, requires an ease and
freedom in translation not permissible, perhaps, in works of scholarly
import.

The translator has endeavored to keep constantly in mind the kindly
humanism with which Lucian

wrote these tales so descriptive of one phase of Greek life. Lucian
discusses intimate sex details with the frankness of one not immoral,
but influenced by a system of morals that finds everything that is
natural both beautiful and good.

These dialogues can hardly be offensive to the intelligent modern; for,
somehow, our own civilization is changing, and as it becomes richer and
fuller, it seems to have more in common with the civilizations of
antiquity.

A. L. H.

October 1, 1928.
