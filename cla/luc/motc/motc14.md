### A POOR SAILOR'S LOVE

DORION

You have impoverished me, Myrtale, and now you won't let me in. Before,
when I brought you fine gifts from abroad, you called me your beloved,
your man, your master. I was your all in all. But now that I am
miserably flat, and you have found for yourself a rich merchant from
Bithynia, you won't let me approach you. I sit on your doorstep and shed
bitter tears while he enjoys your kisses and shares your warm bed. And
now you tell me you will have a child by the fat merchant. (*He weeps*.)

MYRTALE

Ah, you suffocate me, Dorion. You say that you have showered me with
gifts and that I have impoverished you. How many gifts have you given
me, you wet-nosed sailor? Count how many!

DORION

Very well, Myrtale, I shall count my gifts and estimate the total value
of the wealth I have handed over

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

to you, Myrtale, as proof of my love and esteem. To start with, you have
those shoes from Sikyone. That's two drachmas. You won't deny that the
shoes were worth two drachmas?

MYRTALE

But you slept with me for two nights.

DORION

And when I returned from Syria, I brought you an alabaster full of
Phœnician perfumes. By the tail of the great god Poseidon, that amounts
to another two drachmas!

MYRTALE

And what about me? Didn't I give you, before you left for the same
Syria, a little tunic reaching till the thighs for you to wear while
rowing? Do you remember? The proreus Epioros forgot it one day in my
rooms. Yes, the proreus Epioros himself slept with me. Must I remember a
poor sailor's gifts?

DORION

He took the tunic away from me, your proreus. He saw me wearing the
tunic on the shore at Samos, and he took it away from me--but only after
a long struggle!

And didn't I bring you a lot of onions from Cyprus and five saperdes and
four perches when we returned

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

from the Bosphorus? And when we returned from Patares, ten breads packed
in one bundle and an amphora of Carian figs and a pair of sandals
embroidered with gold thread? Oh, you ingrate! Dorion, the sailor, has
presented you with sandals embroidered with gold. And I remember now, a
huge Cythonian cheese.

MYRTALE (*Contemptuously*)

Altogether five drachmas. Five drachmas, and possibly less.

DORION (*Sadly*)

Ah, Myrtale, it was all a sailor could afford. But now I am in charge of
the right flank of rowers on our ship. Why do you look at me that way?
And--remember!--at the last feast of Aphrodite, I left for your account
a whole drachma at the feet of the goddess. Yes, a whole silver drachma!
And I gave your mother two drachmas for shoes. Very often would I leave
two oboles or four in the beckoning palm of the old Lyde. All that
mounts up to a fortune for a sailor.

MYRTALE

Fish and onions, Dorion.

DORION

Well, what if it is fish and onions? I can't afford more. I wouldn't
find amusement at the oar of a ship

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

if I were rich. I have never brought more than a head of garlic to my
own mother. But I'd like to know what great gifts the Bithynian has ever
presented you with.

MYRTALE

Do you see this robe? It was he who bought it for me. And do your fish
eyes perceive this heavy necklace?

DORION

That? Why you have had it for some time!

MYRTALE

The one you saw on me before was much thinner and had no emeralds. And
look at these earrings and this rug! And yesterday he gave me two
hundred drachmas, and he promised to pay the rent for us. This is not
sandals from Patares or cheese from Cythion and a lot of worthless
chatter about love, mournful sailor!

DORION

But you don't say how he is himself. You don't describe the man you
prefer to me on account of his impossible riches. He is more than fifty
years old. He is bald-headed. He is as red as a lobster. And you haven't
noticed his teeth, I suppose. Where are his teeth, Myrtale? I ask you:
Where are his teeth? And what grace is his? O Dioscores, what grace! It
is

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

most evident when he tries to sing and play the young fellow. An ass
strumming on a lyre!

You can keep your Apollo! He is quite worthy of you. May you have a son
that looks like the father! As for me, I'll find my Delphis or
Kymbalion. Don't you worry! Your neighbor, the flute player, looks
pretty good to me. Carpets, necklaces, gifts of two hundred drachmas
aren't bad. You can't have a good-looking young man like me, but you
must sleep with a sack of offal, insist on carpets, necklaces and rich
gifts. We can't have everything, you know.

MYRTALE (*Ironically*)

Oh, happy will be the woman whom you choose as your beloved! For you
will bring her Cyprian onions and cheese upon your return from Cythion.
