# THE TRUE HISTORY

### BOOK I

<span class="margnote"><span id="137:5">5</span></span>Starting on a
certain date from the Pillars of Heracles, I sailed with a fair wind
into the Atlantic. The motives of my voyage were a certain intellectual
restlessness, a passion for novelty, a curiosity about the limits of the
ocean and the peoples who might dwell beyond it. This being my design, I
provisioned and watered my ship on a generous scale. My crew amounted

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

to fifty, all men whose interests, as well as their years, corresponded
with my own. I had further provided a good supply of arms, secured the
best navigator to be had for money, and had the ship--a sloop--specially
strengthened for a long and arduous voyage.

For a day and a night we were carried quietly along by the<span
class="margnote"><span id="138:6">6</span></span> breeze, with land
still in sight. But with the next day's dawn the wind rose to a gale,
with a heavy sea and a dark sky; we found ourselves unable to take in
sail. We surrendered ourselves to the elements, let her run, and were
storm-driven for more than eleven weeks. On the eightieth day the sun
came out quite suddenly, and we found ourselves close to a lofty wooded
island, round which the waves were murmuring gently, the sea having
almost fallen by this time. We brought her to land, disembarked, and
after our long tossing lay a considerable time idle on shore; we at last
made a start, however, and leaving thirty of our number to guard the
ship I took the other twenty on a tour of inspection.

We had advanced half a mile inland through woods, when we<span
class="margnote"><span id="138:7">7</span></span> came upon a brazen
pillar, inscribed in Greek characters--which however were worn and
dim--'Heracles and Dionysus reached this point.' Not far off were two
footprints on rock; one might have been an acre in area, the other being
smaller; and I conjecture that the latter was Dionysus's, and the other
Heracles's; we did obeisance, and proceeded. Before we had gone far, we
found ourselves on a river which ran wine; it was very like Chian; the
stream full and copious, even navigable in parts. This evidence of
Dionysus's sojourn was enough to convince us that the inscription on the
pillar was authentic. Resolving to find the source, I followed the river
up, and discovered, instead of a fountain, a number of huge vines
covered with grapes; from the root of each there issued a trickle of
perfectly clear wine, the joining of which made the river. It was well

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

stocked with great fish, resembling wine both in colour and taste;
catching and eating some, we at once found ourselves intoxicated; and
indeed when opened the fish were full of wine-lees; presently it
occurred to us to mix them with ordinary water fish, thus diluting the
strength of our spirituous food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="139:8">8</span></span>We now crossed
the river by a ford, and came to some vines of a most extraordinary
kind. Out of the ground came a thick well-grown stem; but the upper part
was a woman, complete from the loins upward. They were like our
painters' representations of Daphne in the act of turning into a tree
just as Apollo overtakes her. From the finger-tips sprang vine twigs,
all loaded with grapes; the hair of their heads was tendrils, leaves,
and grape-clusters. They greeted us and welcomed our approach, talking
Lydian, Indian, and Greek, most of them the last. They went so far as to
kiss us on the mouth; and whoever was kissed staggered like a drunken
man. But they would not permit us to pluck their fruit, meeting the
attempt with cries of pain. Some of them made further amorous advances;
and two of my comrades who yielded to these solicitations found it
impossible to extricate themselves again from their embraces; the man
became one plant with the vine, striking root beside it; his fingers
turned to vine twigs, the tendrils were all round him, and embryo
grape-clusters were already visible on him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="139:9">9</span></span>We left them
there and hurried back to the ship, where we told our tale, including
our friends' experiment in viticulture. Then after taking some casks
ashore and filling them with wine and water we bivouacked near the
beach, and next morning set sail before a gentle breeze. But about
midday, when we were out of sight of the island, a waterspout suddenly
came upon us, which swept the ship round and up to a height of some
three hundred and fifty miles above the earth. She did not fall back
into the sea, but was suspended aloft, and at the same time carried
along by a wind which struck and filled the sails.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

For a whole week we pursued our airy course, and on the<span
class="margnote"><span id="140:10">10</span></span> eighth day descried
land; it was an island with air for sea, glistening, spherical, and
bathed in light. We reached it, cast anchor, and landed; inspection soon
showed that it was inhabited and cultivated. In the daytime nothing
could be discerned outside of it; but night revealed many neighbouring
islands, some larger and some smaller than ours; there was also another
land below us containing cities, rivers, seas, forests, and mountains;
and this we concluded to be our Earth.

We were intending to continue our voyage, when we were<span
class="margnote"><span id="140:11">11</span></span> discovered and
detained by the Horse-vultures, as they are called. These are men
mounted on huge vultures, which they ride like horses; the great birds
have ordinarily three heads. It will give you some idea of their size if
I state that each of their quill-feathers is longer and thicker than the
mast of a large merchantman. This corps is charged with the duty of
patrolling the land, and bringing any strangers it may find to the king;
this was what was now done with us. The king surveyed us, and, forming
his conclusions from our dress, 'Strangers,' said he, 'you are Greeks,
are you not?' we assented. 'And how did you traverse this vast space of
air?' In answer we gave a full account of ourselves, to which he at once
replied with his own history. It seemed he too was a mortal, named
Endymion, who had been conveyed up from our Earth in his sleep, and
after his arrival had become king of the country; this was, he told us,
what we knew on our Earth as the moon. He bade us be of good cheer and
entertain no apprehensions; all our needs should be supplied.

'And if I am victorious,' he added, 'in the campaign which<span
class="margnote"><span id="140:12">12</span></span> I am now commencing
against the inhabitants of the Sun, I promise you an extremely pleasant
life at my court.' We asked about the enemy, and the quarrel.
'Phaethon,' he replied, 'king of the Sun (which is inhabited, like the
Moon), has long

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

been at war with us. The occasion was this: I wished at one time to
collect the poorest of my subjects and send them as a colony to Lucifer,
which is uninhabited. Phaethon took umbrage at this, met the emigrants
half way with a troop of Horse-ants, and forbade them to proceed. On
that occasion, being in inferior force, we were worsted and had to
retreat; but I now intend to take the offensive and send my colony. I
shall be glad if you will participate; I will provide your equipment and
mount you on vultures from the royal coops; the expedition starts
to-morrow.' I expressed our readiness to do his pleasure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="141:13">13</span></span>That day we
were entertained by the king; in the morning we took our place in the
ranks as soon as we were up, our scouts having announced the approach of
the enemy. Our army numbered 100,000 (exclusive of camp-followers,
engineers, infantry, and allies), the Horse-vultures amounting to
80,000, and the remaining 20,000 being mounted on Salad-wings. These
latter are also enormous birds, fledged with various herbs, and with
quill-feathers resembling lettuce leaves. Next these were the
Millet-throwers and the Garlic-men. Endymion had also a contingent from
the North of 30,000 Flea-archers and 50,000 Wind-coursers. The former
have their name from the great fleas, each of the bulk of a dozen
elephants, which they ride. The Wind-coursers are infantry, moving
through the air without wings; they effect this by so girding their
shirts, which reach to the ankle, that they hold the wind like a sail
and propel their wearers ship-fashion. These troops are usually employed
as skirmishers. 70,000 Ostrich-slingers and 50,000 Horse-cranes were
said to be on their way from the stars over Cappadocia. But as they
failed to arrive I did not actually see them; and a description from
hearsay I am not prepared to give, as the marvels related of them put
some strain on belief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="141:14">14</span></span>Such was
Endymion's force. They were all armed alike;

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

their helmets were made of beans, which grow there of great size and
hardness; the breastplates were of overlapping lupine-husks sewn
together, these husks being as tough as horn; as to shields and swords,
they were of the Greek type.

When the time came, the array was as follows: on the right<span
class="margnote"><span id="142:15">15</span></span> were the
Horse-vultures, and the King with the *élite* of his forces, including
ourselves. The Salad-wings held the left, and in the centre were the
various allies. The infantry were in round numbers 60,000,000; they were
enabled to fall in thus: there are in the Moon great numbers of gigantic
spiders, considerably larger than an average Aegean island; these were
instructed to stretch webs across from the Moon to Lucifer; as soon as
the work was done, the King drew up his infantry on this artificial
plain, entrusting the command to Nightbat, son of Fairweather, with two
lieutenants.

On the enemy's side, Phaethon occupied the left with his<span
class="margnote"><span id="142:16">16</span></span> Horse-ants; they are
great winged animals resembling our ants except in size; but the largest
of them would measure a couple of acres. The fighting was done not only
by their riders; they used their horns also; their numbers were stated
at 50,000. On their right was about an equal force of Sky-gnats--archers
mounted on great gnats; and next them the Sky-pirouetters, light-armed
infantry only, but of some military value; they slung monstrous radishes
at long range, a wound from which was almost immediately fatal, turning
to gangrene at once; they were supposed to anoint their missiles with
mallow juice. Next came the Stalk-fungi, 10,000 heavy-armed troops for
close quarters; the explanation of their name is that their shields are
mushrooms, and their spears asparagus stalks. Their neighbours were the
Dog-acorns, Phaethon's contingent from Sirius. These were 5,000 in
number, dog-faced men fighting on winged acorns. It was reported that
Phaethon too was disappointed of the slingers whom he had summoned from
the

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Milky Way, and of
the Cloud-centaurs. These latter, however, arrived, most unfortunately
for us, after the battle was decided; the slingers failed altogether,
and are said to have felt the resentment of Phaethon, who wasted their
territory with fire. Such was the force brought by the enemy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="143:17">17</span></span>As soon as the
standards were raised and the asses on both sides (their trumpeters) had
brayed, the engagement commenced. The Sunite left at once broke without
awaiting the onset of the Horse-vultures, and we pursued, slaying them.
On the other hand, their right had the better of our left, the Sky-gnats
pressing on right up to our infantry. When these joined in, however,
they turned and fled, chiefly owing to the moral effect of our success
on the other flank. The rout became decisive, great numbers were taken
and slain, and blood flowed in great quantities on to the clouds,
staining them as red as we see them at sunset; much of it also dropped
earthwards, and suggested to me that it was possibly some ancient event
of the same kind which persuaded Homer that Zeus had rained blood at the
death of Sarpedon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="143:18">18</span></span>Relinquishing
the pursuit, we set up two trophies, one for the infantry engagement on
the spiders' webs, and one on the clouds for the air-battle. It was
while we were thus engaged that our scouts announced the approach of the
Cloud-centaurs, whom Phaethon had expected in time for the battle. They
were indeed close upon us, and a strange sight, being compounded of
winged horses and men; the human part, from the middle upwards, was as
tall as the Colossus of Rhodes, and the equine the size of a large
merchantman. Their number I cannot bring myself to write down, for fear
of exciting incredulity. They were commanded by Sagittarius. Finding
their friends defeated, they sent a messenger after Phaethon to bring
him back, and, themselves in perfect order, charged the disarrayed
Moonites, who had left their ranks and were scattered in pursuit or
pillage;

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

they routed the whole of them, chased the King home, and killed the
greater part of his birds; they tore up the trophies, and overran the
woven plain; I myself was taken, with two of my comrades. Phaethon now
arrived, and trophies were erected on the enemy's part. We were taken
off to the Sun the same day, our hands tied behind with a piece of the
cobweb.

They decided not to lay siege to the city; but after their<span
class="margnote"><span id="144:19">19</span></span> return they
constructed a wall across the intervening space, cutting off the Sun's
rays from the Moon. This wall was double, and built of clouds; the
consequence was total eclipse of the Moon, which experienced a
continuous night. This severity forced Endymion to negotiate. He
entreated that the wall might be taken down, and his kingdom released
from this life of darkness; he offered to pay tribute, conclude an
alliance, abstain from hostilities in future, and give hostages for
these engagements. The Sunites held two assemblies on the question, in
the first of which they refused all concessions; on the second day,
however, they relented, and peace was concluded on the following terms.

Articles of peace between the Sunites and their allies of the<span
class="margnote"><span id="144:20">20</span></span> one part, and the
Moonites and their allies of the other part.

1\. The Sunites shall demolish the party-wall, shall make no further
incursion into the Moon, and shall hold their captives to ransom at a
fixed rate.

2\. The Moonites shall restore to the other stars their autonomy, shall
not bear arms against the Sunites, and shall conclude with them a mutual
defensive alliance.

3\. The King of the Moonites shall pay to the King of the Sunites,
annually, a tribute of ten thousand jars of dew, and give ten thousand
hostages of his subjects.

4\. The high contracting parties shall found the colony of Lucifer in
common, and shall permit persons of any other nationality to join the
same.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

5\. These articles shall be engraved on a pillar of electrum, which
shall be set up on the border in mid-air.

Sworn to on behalf of the Sun by Firebrace, Heaton, and Flashman; and on
behalf of the Moon by Nightwell, Monday, and Shimmer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="145:21">21</span></span>Peace
concluded, the removal of the wall and restoration of captives at once
followed. As we reached the Moon, we were met and welcomed by our
comrades and King Endymion, all weeping for joy. The King wished us to
remain and take part in founding the colony, and, women not existing in
the Moon, offered me his son in marriage. I refused, asking that we
might be sent down to the sea again; and finding that he could not
prevail, he entertained us for a week, and then sent us on our way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="145:22">22</span></span>I am now to put
on record the novelties and singularities which attracted my notice
during our stay in the Moon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="145:23">23</span></span>When a man
becomes old, he does not die, but dissolves in smoke into the air. There
is one universal diet; they light a fire, and in the embers roast frogs,
great numbers of which are always flying in the air; they then sit round
as at table, snuffing up the fumes which rise and serve them for food;
their drink is air compressed in a cup till it gives off a moisture
resembling dew. Beauty with them consists in a bald head and hairless
body; a good crop of hair is an abomination. On the comets, as I was
told by some of their inhabitants who were there on a visit, this is
reversed. They have beards, however, just above the knee; no toe-nails,
and but one toe on each foot. They are all tailed, the tail being a
large cabbage of an evergreen kind, which does not break if they fall
upon it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="145:24">24</span></span>Their mucus is
a pungent honey; and after hard work or exercise they sweat milk all
over, which a drop or two of the honey curdles into cheese. The oil
which they make from onions is very rich, and as fragrant as balsam.
They have an

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

abundance of water-producing vines, the stones of which resemble
hailstones; and my own belief is that it is the shaking of these vines
by hurricanes, and the consequent bursting of the grapes, that results
in our hailstorms. They use the belly as a pouch in which to keep
necessaries, being able to open and shut it. It contains no intestines
or liver, only a soft hairy lining; their young, indeed, creep into it
for protection from cold.

The clothing of the wealthy is soft glass, and of the poor,<span
class="margnote"><span id="146:25">25</span></span> woven brass; the
land is very rich in brass, which they work like wool after steeping it
in water. It is with some hesitation that I describe their eyes, the
thing being incredible enough to bring doubt upon my veracity. But the
fact is that these organs are removable; any one can take out his eyes
and do without till he wants them; then he has merely to put them in; I
have known many cases of people losing their own and borrowing at need;
and some--the rich, naturally--keep a large stock. Their ears are
plane-leaves, except with the breed raised from acorns; theirs being of
wood.

Another marvel I saw in the palace. There is a large mirror<span
class="margnote"><span id="146:26">26</span></span> suspended over a
well of no great depth; any one going down the well can hear every word
spoken on our Earth; and if he looks at the mirror, he sees every city
and nation as plainly as though he were standing close above each. The
time I was there, I surveyed my own people and the whole of my native
country; whether they saw me also, I cannot say for certain. Any one who
doubts the truth of this statement has only to go there himself, to be
assured of my veracity.

When the time came, we took our leave of King and court,<span
class="margnote"><span id="146:27">27</span></span> got on board, and
weighed anchor. Endymion's parting gifts to me were two glass shirts,
five of brass, and a suit of lupine armour, all of which, however, I
afterwards left in the whale's belly; he also sent, as our escort for
the first fifty miles, a thousand of his Horse-vultures.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="147:28">28</span></span>We passed on
our way many countries, and actually landed on Lucifer, now in process
of settlement, to water. We then entered the Zodiac and passed the Sun
on the left, coasting close by it. My crew were very desirous of
landing, but the wind would not allow of this. We had a good view of the
country, however, and found it covered with vegetation, rich,
well-watered, and full of all good things. The Cloud-centaurs, now in
Phaethon's pay, espied us and pounced upon the ship, but left us alone
when they learned that we were parties to the treaty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="147:29">29</span></span>By this time
our escort had gone home. We now took a downward course, and twenty-four
hours' sailing brought us to Lampton. This lies between the atmospheres
of the Pleiads and the Hyads, though in point of altitude it is
considerably lower than the Zodiac. When we landed, we found no human
beings, but numberless lamps bustling about or spending their time in
the market-place and harbour; some were small, and might represent the
lower classes, while a few, the great and powerful, were exceedingly
bright and conspicuous. They all had their own homes or lodgings, and
their individual names, like us; we heard them speak, and they did us no
harm, offering us entertainment, on the contrary; but we were under some
apprehension, and none of us accepted either food or bed. There is a
Government House in the middle of the city, where the Governor sits all
night long calling the roll-call; any one not answering to his name is
capitally punished as a deserter; that is to say, he is extinguished. We
were present and witnessed the proceedings, and heard lamps defending
their conduct and advancing reasons for their lateness. I there
recognized our own house lamp, accosted him, and asked for news of my
friends, in which he satisfied me. We stayed there that night, set sail
next morning, and found ourselves sailing, now, nearly as low as the
clouds. Here we were surprised to find

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cloud-cuckoo-land;
we were prevented from landing by the direction of the wind, but learned
that the King's name was Crookbeak, son of Fitz-Ousel. I bethought me of
Aristophanes, the learned and veracious poet whose statements had met
with unmerited incredulity. Three days more, and we had a distinct view
of the Ocean, though there was no land visible except the islands
suspended in air; and these had now assumed a brilliant fiery hue. About
noon on the fourth day the wind slackened and fell, and we were
deposited upon the sea.

The joy and delight with which the touch of water affected<span
class="margnote"><span id="148:30">30</span></span> us is indescribable;
transported at our good fortune, we flung ourselves overboard and swam,
the weather being calm and the sea smooth. Alas, how often is a change
for the better no more than the beginning of disaster! We had but two
days' delightful sail, and by the rising sun of the third we beheld a
crowd of whales and marine monsters, and among them one far larger than
the rest--some two hundred miles in length. It came on open-mouthed,
agitating the sea far in front, bathed in foam, and exhibiting teeth
whose length much surpassed the height of our great phallic images, all
pointed like sharp stakes and white as elephants' tusks. We gave each
other a last greeting, took a last embrace, and so awaited our doom. The
monster was upon us; it sucked us in; it swallowed ship and crew entire.
We escaped being ground by its teeth, the ship gliding in through the
interstices.

Inside, all was darkness at first, in which we could distinguish<span
class="margnote"><span id="148:31">31</span></span> nothing; but when it
next opened its mouth, an enormous cavern was revealed, of great extent
and height; a city of ten thousand inhabitants might have had room in
it. Strewn about were small fish, the *disjecta membra* of many kinds of
animal, ships' masts and anchors, human bones, and merchandise; in the
centre was land with hillocks upon it, the alluvial deposit, I supposed,
from what the whale swallowed. This was

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

wooded with trees of all kinds, and vegetables were growing with all the
appearance of cultivation. The coast might have measured thirty miles
round. Sea-birds, such as gulls and halcyons, nested on the trees.

<span class="margnote"><span id="149:32">32</span></span>We spent some
time weeping, but at last got our men up and had the ship made fast,
while we rubbed wood to get a fire and prepared a meal out of the
plentiful materials around us; there were fragments of various fish, and
the water we had taken in at Lucifer was unexhausted. Upon getting up
next day, we caught glimpses, as often as the whale opened his mouth, of
land, of mountains, it might be of the sky alone, or often of islands;
we realized that he was dashing at a great rate to every part of the
sea. We grew accustomed to our condition in time, and I then took seven
of my comrades and entered the wood in search of information. I had
scarcely gone half a mile when I came upon a shrine, which its
inscription showed to have been raised to Posidon; a little further were
a number of graves with pillars upon them, and close by a spring of
clear water; we also heard a dog bark, saw some distant smoke, and
conjectured that there must be a habitation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="149:33">33</span></span>We accordingly
pressed on, and found ourselves in presence of an old man and a younger
one, who were working hard at a plot of ground and watering it by a
channel from the spring. We stood still, divided between fear and
delight. They were standing speechless, no doubt with much the same
feelings. At length the old man spoke:--'What are you, strangers; are
you spirits of the sea, or unfortunate mortals like ourselves? As for
us, we are men, bred on land; but now we have suffered a sea change, and
swim about in this containing monster, scarce knowing how to describe
our state; reason tells us we are dead, but instinct that we live.' This
loosed my tongue in turn. 'We too, father,' I said, 'are men, just
arrived; it is but a day or two since we were swallowed with our ship.
And now we have

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

come forth to explore the forest; for we saw that it was vast and dense.
Methinks some heavenly guide has brought us to the sight of you, to the
knowledge that we are not prisoned all alone in this monster. I pray
you, let us know your tale, who you are and how you entered.' Then he
said that, before he asked or answered questions, he must give us such
entertainment as he could; so saying, he brought us to his house--a
sufficient dwelling furnished with beds and what else he might need--,
and set before us green-stuff and nuts and fish, with wine for drink.
When we had eaten our fill, he asked for our story. I told him all as it
had passed, the storm, the island, the airy voyage, the war, and so to
our descent into the whale.

It was very strange, he said, and then gave us his history in<span
class="margnote"><span id="150:34">34</span></span> return. 'I am a
Cyprian, gentlemen. I left my native land on a trading voyage with my
son here and a number of servants. We had a fine ship, with a mixed
cargo for Italy; you may have seen the wreckage in the whale's mouth. We
had a fair voyage to Sicily, but on leaving it were caught in a gale,
and carried in three days out to the Atlantic, where we fell in with the
whale and were swallowed, ship and crew; of the latter we two alone
survived. We buried our men, built a temple to Posidon, and now live
this life, cultivating our garden, and feeding on fish and nuts. It is a
great wood, as you see, and in it are vines in plenty, from which we get
delicious wine; our spring you may have noticed; its water is of the
purest and coldest. We use leaves for bedding, keep a good fire, snare
the birds that fly in, and catch living fish by going out on the
monster's gills; it is there also that we take our bath when we are
disposed. There is moreover at no great distance a salt lake two or
three miles round, producing all sorts of fish; in this we swim and
sail, in a little boat of my building. It is now seven and twenty years
since we were swallowed.

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="151:35">35</span></span>'Our lot might
have been endurable enough, but we have bad and troublesome neighbours,
unfriendly savages all.' 'What,' said I, 'are there other inhabitants?'
'A great many,' he replied, 'inhospitable and abhorrent to the sight.
The western part of the wood (so to name the caudal region) is occupied
by the Stockfish tribe; they have eels' eyes and lobster faces, are bold
warriors, and eat their meat raw. Of the sides of the cavern, the right
belongs to the Tritonomendetes, who from the waist upwards are human,
and weazels below; their notions of justice are slightly less
rudimentary than the others'. The left is in possession of the Crabhands
and the Tunnyheads, two tribes in close alliance. The central part is
inhabited by the Crays and the Flounderfoots, the latter warlike and
extremely swift. As to this district near the mouth, the East, as it
were, it is in great part desert, owing to the frequent inundations. I
hold it of the Flounderfoots, paying an annual tribute of five hundred
oysters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="151:36">36</span></span>'Such is the
land; and now it is for you to consider how we may make head against all
these tribes, and what shall be our manner of life.' 'What may their
numbers be, all told?' I asked. 'More than a thousand.' 'And how armed?'
'They have no arms but fishbones.' 'Why then,' I said, 'let us fight
them by all means; we are armed, and they are not; and, if we win, we
shall live secure.' We agreed on this course, and returned to the ship
to make our preparations. The pretext for war was to be non-payment of
the tribute, which was on the point of falling due. Messengers, in fact,
shortly came to demand it, but the old man sent them about their
business with an insolent answer. The Flounderfoots and Crays were
enraged, and commenced operations with a tumultuous inroad upon
Scintharus--this was our old man's name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="151:37">37</span></span>Expecting this,
we were awaiting the attack in full armour. We had put five and twenty
men in ambush, with directions to

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

fall on the enemy's rear as soon as they had passed; they executed their
orders, and came on from behind cutting them down, while the rest of
us--five and twenty also, including Scintharus and his son--met them
face to face with a spirited and resolute attack. It was risky work, but
in the end we routed and chased them to their dens. They left one
hundred and seventy dead, while we lost only our navigating officer,
stabbed in the back with a mullet rib, and one other.

We held the battlefield for the rest of that day and the night<span
class="margnote"><span id="152:38">38</span></span> following, and
erected a trophy consisting of a dolphin's backbone upright. Next day
the news brought the other tribes out, with the Stockfish under a
general called Slimer on the right, the Tunnyheads on the left, and the
Crabhands in the centre; the Tritonomendetes stayed at home, preferring
neutrality. We did not wait to be attacked, but charged them near
Posidon's temple with loud shouts, which echoed as in a subterranean
cave. Their want of armour gave us the victory; we pursued them to the
wood, and were henceforth masters.

Soon after, they sent heralds to treat for recovery of their<span
class="margnote"><span id="152:39">39</span></span> dead, and for peace.
But we decided to make no terms with them, and marching out next day
exterminated the whole, with the exception of the Tritonomendetes. These
too, when they saw what was going on, made a rush for the gills, and
cast themselves into the sea. We went over the country, now clear of
enemies, and occupied it from that time in security. Our usual
employments were exercise, hunting, vine-dressing, and fruit-gathering;
we were in the position of men in a vast prison from which escape is out
of the question, but within which they have luxury and freedom of
movement. This manner of life lasted for a year and eight months.

It was on the fifth of the next month, about the second gape<span
class="margnote"><span id="152:40">40</span></span> (the whale, I should
say, gaped regularly once an hour, and we

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

reckoned time that way)--about the second gape, then, a sudden shouting
and tumult became audible; it sounded like boatswains giving the time
and oars beating. Much excited, we crept right out into our monster's
mouth, stood inside the teeth, and beheld the most extraordinary
spectacle I ever looked upon--giants of a hundred yards in height rowing
great islands as we do triremes. I am aware that what I am to relate
must sound improbable; but I cannot help it. Very long islands they
were, but of no great height; the circumference of each would be about
eleven miles; and its complement of giants was some hundred and twenty.
Of these some sat along each side of the island, rowing with big
cypresses, from which the branches and leaves were not stripped; in the
stern, so to speak, was a considerable hillock, on which stood the
helmsman with his hand on a brazen steering-oar of half a mile in
length; and on the deck forward were forty in armour, the combatants;
they resembled men except in their hair, which was flaming fire, so that
they could dispense with helmets. The work of sails was done by the
abundant forest on all the islands, which so caught and held the wind
that it drove them where the steersman wished; there was a boatswain
timing the stroke, and the islands jumped to it like great galleys.

<span class="margnote"><span id="153:41">41</span></span>We had seen
only two or three at first; but there appeared afterwards as many as six
hundred, which formed in two lines and commenced an action. Many crashed
into each other stem to stem, many were rammed and sunk, others
grappled, fought an obstinate duel, and could hardly get clear after it.
Great courage was shown by the troops on deck, who boarded and dealt
destruction, giving no quarter. Instead of grappling-irons, they used
huge captive squids, which they swung out on to the hostile island;
these grappled the wood and so held the island fast. Their missiles,
effective enough, were oysters the size of waggons, and sponges which
might cover an acre.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

Aeolocentaur and Thalassopot were the names of the rival chiefs; and the
question between them was one of plunder; Thalassopot was supposed to
have driven off several herds of dolphins, the other's property; we
could hear them vociferating the charge and calling out their Kings'
names. Aeolocentaur's fleet finally won, sinking one hundred and fifty
of the enemy's islands and capturing three with their crews; the
remainder backed away, turned and fled. The victors pursued some way,
but, as it was now evening, returned to the disabled ones, secured most
of the enemy's, and recovered their own, of which as many as eighty had
been sunk. As a trophy of victory they slung one of the enemy's islands
to a stake which they planted in our whale's head. They lay moored round
him that night, attaching cables to him or anchoring hard by; they had
vast glass anchors, very strong. Next morning they sacrificed on the
whale's back, buried their dead there, and sailed off rejoicing, with
something corresponding to our paean. So ended the battle of the
islands.
