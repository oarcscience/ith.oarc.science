# PHALARIS

### II

Men of Delphi: I stand in no public relation to the city of Agrigentum,
in no private relation to its ruler; I am bound to him neither by
gratitude for past favours, nor by the prospect of future friendship:
but I have heard the just and temperate plea advanced by his emissaries,
and I rise to advocate the claims of religion, the interests of our
community, the duties of the priesthood; I charge you, thwart not the
pious intention of a mighty prince, nor deprive the God of an offering
which in the intention of the donor is already his, and which is
destined to serve as an eternal threefold record,--of the sculptor's
art, <span class="margnote"><span id="209:2">2</span></span>of inventive
cruelty, and of righteous retribution. To me it seems that only to have
raised this question, only to have halted between acceptance and
rejection, is in itself an offence against Heaven; nay, a glaring
impiety. For what is this but a sacrilege more heinous than that of the
temple-robber, who does but plunder those sacred things to which you
would even deny <span class="margnote"><span
id="209:3">3</span></span>consecration? I implore you,--your fellow
priest, your partner in good report (if so it may be), or in evil
(should that now befall us), implores you: close not the temple-doors
upon the devout worshipper; suffer us not to be known to the world as
men who examine jealously into the offerings that are brought, and
subject the donor to the narrow scrutiny of a court, and to the hazard
of a vote. For who would not be deterred at the thought that the God
accepts no offering without the previous sanction of his priests?

<span class="margnote"><span id="209:4">4</span></span>Already Apollo
has declared his true opinion. Had he hated Phalaris, or scorned his
gift, it had been easy for him to sink the gift and the ship that bore
it in mid-ocean; instead, we learn that he vouchsafed them a calm
passage and a safe arrival at

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cirrha. Clearly
the monarch's piety is acceptable in his sight.<span
class="margnote"><span id="210:5">5</span></span> It behoves you to
confirm his decision, and to add this bull to the glories of the temple.
Strange indeed, if the sender of so magnificent a gift is to meet with
rejection at the temple-door, and his piety to be rewarded with the
judgement that his offering is unclean.

My opponent tells a harrowing tale of butchery and violence,<span
class="margnote"><span id="210:6">6</span></span> of plunder and
abduction; it is much that he does not call himself an eyewitness
thereof; we might suppose that he was but newly arrived from Agrigentum,
did we not know that his travels have never carried him on board ship.
In matters of this kind, it is not advisable to place much reliance even
on the assertions of the supposed victims; there is no knowing how far
they are speaking the truth;--as to bringing allegations ourselves, when
we know nothing of the facts, that is out of the question. Granting even
that something of the kind *did*<span class="margnote"><span
id="210:7">7</span></span> happen, it happened in Sicily: we are at
Delphi; we are not called upon to interfere. Do we propose to abandon
the temple for the law-court? Are we, whose office it is to sacrifice,
and minister to the God, and receive his offerings,--are we to sit here
debating whether certain cities on the other side of the Ionian sea are
well or ill governed? Let other men's affairs be<span
class="margnote"><span id="210:8">8</span></span> as they may, it is our
business, as I take it, to know our own: our past history, our present
situation, our best interests. We need not wait for Homer to inform us
that we inhabit a land of crags, and are tillers of a rocky soil; our
eyes tell us that; if we depended on our soil, we must go hungry all our
days. Apollo; his temple; his oracle; his worshippers; his
sacrifices;--these are the fields of the Delphians, these their
revenues, their wealth, their maintenance. I can speak the truth here.
It is as the poets say: we sow not, we plough not, yet all things grow
for our use; for a God is our husbandman, and gives us not the good
things of Greece only; all that Phrygia, all that Lydia, all that

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Persia, Assyria,
Phoenicia, Italy, and the far North can yield,--all comes to Delphi. We
live in prosperity and plenty; in the esteem of mankind we are second to
none but the God himself. So it was in the beginning: so it is now: and
so may it ever be!

<span class="margnote"><span id="211:9">9</span></span>But who has ever
heard before of our putting an offering to the vote, or hindering men
from paying sacrifice? No one; and herein, as I maintain, is the secret
of our temple's greatness, and of the abundant wealth of its offerings.
Then let us have no innovations now, no new-fangled institutions, no
inquiries into the origin and nature and nationality and pedigree of a
gift; let us take what is brought to us, and set it in the store-chamber
without more ado. In this way we shall best <span class="margnote"><span
id="211:10">10</span></span>serve both the God and his worshippers. I
think it would be well if, before you deliberate further on the question
before you, you would consider how great and how various are the issues
involved. There is the God, his temple, his sacrifices and offerings,
the ancient customs and ordinances, the reputation of the oracle; again,
our city as a whole, our common interests, and those of every individual
Delphian among us; lastly--and I know not what consideration could seem
of more vital importance to a well-judging mind--, our own credit or
discredit with the world at large.

<span class="margnote"><span id="211:11">11</span></span>I say, then, we
have to deal not with Phalaris, not with a single tyrant, not with this
bull, not with so much weight of bronze,--but with every king and prince
who frequents our temple at this day; with gold and silver and all the
precious offerings that should pour in upon the God; that God whose
<span class="margnote"><span id="211:12">12</span></span>interests claim
our first attention. Say, why should we change the old-established usage
in regard to offerings? What fault have we to find with the ancient
custom, that we should propose innovations? Never yet, from the day when
Delphi was first inhabited, and Apollo prophesied, and the tripod gave
utterance, and the priestess was inspired, never yet have the

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

bringers of gifts been subjected to scrutiny. And shall they now?
Consider how the ancient custom, which granted free access to all men,
has filled the temple with treasures; how all men have brought their
offerings, and how some have impoverished themselves to enrich the God.
My mind misgives me that, <span class="margnote"><span
id="212:13">13</span></span> when you have assumed the censorship of
offerings, you will lack employment: men may refuse to submit themselves
to your court; they may think it is enough to spend their money, without
having to undergo the risk of a rejection for their pains. Would life be
worth living, to the man who should be judged unworthy to offer
sacrifice?
