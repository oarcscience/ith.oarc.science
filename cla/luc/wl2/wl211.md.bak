# THE TRUE HISTORY

### INTRODUCTION

ATHLETES and physical trainers do not limit their attention to the
questions of perfect condition and exercise; they say there is a time
for relaxation also--which indeed they represent as the most important
element in training. I hold it equally true for literary men that after
severe study they should unbend the intellect, if it is to come
perfectly efficient to its next task.

The rest they want will best be found in a course of literature<span
class="margnote"><span id="136:2">2</span></span> which does not offer
entertainment pure and simple, depending on mere wit or felicity, but is
also capable of stirring an educated curiosity--in a way which I hope
will be exemplified in the following pages. They are intended to have an
attraction independent of any originality of subject, any happiness of
general design, any verisimilitude in the piling up of fictions. This
attraction is in the veiled reference underlying all the details of my
narrative; they parody the cock-and-bull stories of ancient poets,
historians, and philosophers; I have only refrained from adding a key
because I could rely upon you to recognize as you read.

Ctesias, son of Ctesiochus of Cnidus, in his work on India and<span

its characteristics, gives details for which he had neither the evidence
of his eyes nor of hearsay. Iambulus's *Oceanica* is full of marvels;
the whole thing is a manifest fiction, but at the same time pleasant
reading. Many other writers have adopted the same plan, professing to
relate their own travels, and describing monstrous beasts, savages, and
strange ways of life. The fount and inspiration of their humour is the
Homeric Odysseus, entertaining Alcinous's court with his prisoned winds,
his men one-eyed or wild or cannibal, his beasts with many heads, and
his metamorphosed comrades; the Phaeacians were simple folk, and he
fooled them to the top of their bent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="137:4">4</span></span>When I come
across a writer of this sort, I do not much mind his lying; the practice
is much too well established for that, even with professed philosophers;
I am only surprised at his expecting to escape detection. Now I am
myself vain enough to cherish the hope of bequeathing something to
posterity; I see no reason for resigning my right to that inventive
freedom which others enjoy; and, as I have no truth to put on record,
having lived a very humdrum life, I fall back on falsehood--but
falsehood of a more consistent variety; for I now make the only true
statement you are to expect--that I am a liar. This confession is, I
consider, a full defence against all imputations. My subject is, then,
what I have neither seen, experienced, nor been told, what neither
exists nor could conceivably do so. I humbly solicit my readers'
incredulity.
