# DIALOGUES OF THE GODS

### VI

*Hera. Zeus*

*Hera*. Zeus! What is your opinion of this man Ixion?

*Zeus*. Why, my dear, I think he is a very good sort of man; and the
best of company. Indeed, if he were unworthy of our company, he would
not be here.

*Hera*. He *is* unworthy! He is a villain! Discard him!

*Zeus*. Eh? What has he been after? I must know about this.

*Hera*. Certainly you must; though I scarce know how to tell you. The
wretch!

*Zeus*. Oh, oh; if he is a 'wretch,' you must certainly tell me all
about it. I know what 'wretch' means, on your discreet tongue. What, he
has been making love?

*Hera*. And to me! to me of all people! It has been going on for a long
time. At first, when he would keep looking at me, I had no idea--. And
then he would sigh and groan; and when I handed my cup to Ganymede after
drinking, he would insist on having it, and would stop drinking to kiss
it, and lift it up to his eyes; and then he would look at me again. And
then of course I knew. For a long time I didn't like to say anything to
you; I thought his mad fit would pass. But when he actually dared to
*speak* to me, I left him weeping and groveling about, and stopped my
ears, so that I might not hear his impertinences, and came to tell you.
It is for you to consider what steps you will take.

*Zeus*. Whew! I have a rival, I find; and with my own lawful wife. Here
is a rascal who has tippled nectar to some purpose. Well, we have no one
but ourselves to blame for it: we make too much of these mortals,
admitting them to our table like this. When they drink of our nectar,
and behold the beauties of Heaven (so different from those of Earth!),
’tis no

wonder if they fall in love, and form ambitious schemes! Yes, Love is
all-powerful; and not with mortals only: we Gods have sometimes fallen
beneath his sway.

*Hera*. He has made himself master of *you*; no doubt of that. He does
what he likes with you;--leads you by the nose. You follow him whither
he chooses, and assume every shape at his command; you are his chattel,
his toy. I know how it will be: you are going to let Ixion off, because
you have had relations with his wife; she is the mother of Pirithous.

*Zeus*. Why, what a memory you have for these little outings of
mine!--Now, my idea about Ixion is this. It would never do to punish
him, or to exclude him from our table; that would not look well. No; as
he is so fond of you, so hard hit--even to weeping point, you tell me,--

*Hera*. Zeus! What *are* you going to say?

*Zeus*. Don't be alarmed. Let us make a cloud-phantom in your likeness,
and after dinner, as he lies awake (which of course he will do, being in
love), let us take it and lay it by his side. 'Twill put him out of his
pain: he will fancy he has attained his desire.

*Hera*. Never! The presumptuous villain!

*Zeus*. Yes, I know. But what harm can it do to you, if Ixion makes a
conquest of a cloud?

*Hera*. But he will think that *I* am the cloud; he will be working his
wicked will upon *me* for all he can tell.

*Zeus*. Now you are talking nonsense. The cloud is not Hera, and Hera is
not the cloud. Ixion will be deceived; that is all.

*Hera*. Yes, but these men are all alike--they have no delicacy. I
suppose, when he goes home, he will boast to every one of how he has
enjoyed the embraces of Hera, the wife of Zeus! Why, he may tell them
that *I* am in love with *him*! And they will believe it; *they* will
know nothing about the cloud.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

*Zeus*. If he says anything of the kind he shall soon find himself in
Hades, spinning round on a wheel for all eternity. That will keep him
busy! And serve him right; not for falling in love--I see no great harm
in that--but for letting his tongue wag.
