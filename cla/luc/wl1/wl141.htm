<p align="center"><i>Iris. Posidon</i></p>  
<p><i>Ir</i>. Posidon: you know that floating island, that was torn away from Sicily, and is still drifting about under water; you are to bring it to the surface, Zeus says, and fix it well in view in the middle of the Aegean; and mind it is properly secured; he has a use for it.</p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. Very good. And when I have got it up, and anchored it, what is he going to do with it?</p>  
<p><i>Ir</i>. Leto is to lie in there; her time is near.</p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. And is there no room in Heaven? Or is Earth too small to hold her children?</p>  
<p><i>Ir</i>. Ah, you see, Hera has bound the Earth by a great oath not to give shelter to Leto in her travail. This island, however, being out of sight, has not committed itself.</p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. I see.--Island, be still! Rise once more from the depths; and this time there must be no sinking. Henceforth you are <i>terra firma</i>; it will be your happiness to receive my brother's twin children, fairest of the Gods.--Tritons, you will have to convey Leto across. Let all be calm.--As to that</p>

<p>serpent who is frightening her out of her senses, wait till these children are born; they will soon avenge their mother.--You can tell Zeus that all is ready. Delos stands firm: Leto has only to come.</p>
