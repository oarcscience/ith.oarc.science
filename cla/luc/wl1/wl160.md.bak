# DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD

### XV

*Antilochus. Achilles*

*Ant*. Achilles, what you were saying to Odysseus the other day about
death was very poor-spirited; I should have expected better things from
a pupil of Chiron and Phoenix. I was listening; you said you would
rather be a servant on earth to some poor hind 'of scanty livelihood
possessed,' than king of all the dead. Such sentiments might have been
very well in the mouth of a poor-spirited cowardly Phrygian,
dishonourably in love with life: for the son of Peleus, boldest of all
Heroes, so to vilify himself, is a disgrace; it gives the lie to all
your life; you might have had a long inglorious reign in Phthia, and
your own choice was death and glory.

*Ach*. In those days, son of Nestor, I knew not this place; ignorant
whether of those two was the better, I esteemed that flicker of fame
more than life; now I see that it is worthless, let folk up there make
what verses of it they will. ’Tis dead level among the dead, Antilochus;
strength and beauty are no more; we welter all in the same gloom, one no
better than another; the shades of Trojans fear me not, Achaeans pay me
no reverence; each may say what he will; a man is a ghost, 'or be he
churl, or be he peer.' It irks me; I would fain be a servant, and alive.

*Ant*. But what help, Achilles? ’tis Nature's decree that by all means
all die. We must abide by her law, and not fret at her commands.
Consider too how many of us are with you here; Odysseus comes ere long;
how else? Is there not comfort

in the common fate? ’tis something not to suffer alone. See Heracles,
Meleager, and many another great one; they, methinks, would not choose
return, if one would send them up to serve poor destitute men.

*Ach*. Ay, your intent is friendly; but I know not, the thought of the
past life irks me--and each of you too, if I mistake not. And if you
confess it not, the worse for you, smothering your pain.

*Ant*. Not the worse, Achilles; the better; for we see that speech is
unavailing. Be silent, bear, endure--that is our resolve, lest such
longings bring mockery on us, as on you.

H.
