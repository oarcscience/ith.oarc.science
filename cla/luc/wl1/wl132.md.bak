# DIALOGUES OF THE SEA-GODS

### I

*Doris. Galatea*.

*Dor*. A handsome lover, Galatea, this Sicilian shepherd who they say is
so mad for you!

*Gal*. Don't be sarcastic, Doris; he is Posidon's son, after all.

*Dor*. Well, and if he were Zeus's, and still such a wild shaggy
creature, with only one eye (there is nothing uglier than to have only
one eye), do you think his birth would improve his beauty?

*Gal*. Shagginess and wildness, as you call them, are not ugly in a man;
and his eye looks very well in the middle of his forehead, and sees just
as well as if it were two.

*Dor*. Why, my dear, from your raptures about him one would think it was
you that were in love, not he.

*Gal*. Oh no, I am not in love; but it is too bad, your all running him
down as you do. It is my belief you are jealous, Do you remember? we
were playing on the shore at the foot of Etna, where the long strip of
beach comes between the mountain and the sea; he was feeding his sheep,
and spied us from above; yes, but he never so much as glanced at the
rest of you; I was the pretty one; he was all eyes--eye, I mean--for me.
That is what makes you spiteful, because it showed I was better than
you, good enough to be loved, while you were taken no notice of.

*Dor*. Hoity-toity! jealous indeed! because a one-eyed shepherd thinks
you pretty! Why, what could he see in you but your white skin? and he
only cared for that because it reminded him of cheese and milk; he
thinks everything pretty that is like them. If you want to know any more
than that about your

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

looks, sit on a rock when it is calm, and lean over the water; just a
bit of white skin, that is all; and who cares for that, if it is not
picked out with some red?

*Gal*. Well, if I *am* all white, I have got a lover of some sort; there
is not a shepherd or a sailor or a boatman to care for any of you.
Besides, Polyphemus is very musical.

*Dor*. Take care, dear; we heard him singing the other day when he
serenaded you. Heavens! one would have taken him for an ass braying. And
his lyre! what a thing! A stag's skull, with its horns for the uprights;
he put a bar across, and fastened on the strings without any
tuning-pegs! then came the performance, all harsh and out of tune; he
shouted something himself, and the lyre played something else, and the
love ditty sent us into fits of laughter. Why, Echo, chatterbox that she
is, would not answer him; she was ashamed to be caught mimicking such a
rough ridiculous song. Oh, and the pet that your beau brought you in his
arms!--a bear cub nearly as shaggy as himself. Now then, Galatea, do you
still think we envy you your lover?

*Gal*. Well, Doris, only show us your own; no doubt he is much
handsomer, and sings and plays far better.

*Dor*. Oh, I have not got one; *I* do not set up to be lovely. But one
like the Cyclops--faugh, he might be one of his own goats!--he eats raw
meat, they say, and feeds on travellers--one like him, dear, you may
keep; I wish you nothing worse than to return his love.
