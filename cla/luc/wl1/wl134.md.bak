# DIALOGUES OF THE SEA-GODS

### III

*Posidon. Alpheus*

*Pos*. What is the meaning of this, Alpheus? unlike others, when you
take your plunge you do not mingle with the brine as a river should; you
do not put an end to your labours by dispersing; you hold together
through the sea, keep your current fresh, and hurry along in all your
original purity; you dive down to strange depths like a gull or a heron;
I suppose you will come to the top again and show yourself somewhere or
other.

*Al*. Do not press me, Posidon; a love affair; and many is the time you
have been in love yourself.

*Pos*. Woman, nymph, or Nereid?

*Al*. All wrong; she is a fountain.

*Pos*. A fountain? and where does she flow?

*Al*. She is an islander--in Sicily. Her name is Arethusa.

*Pos*. Ah, I commend your taste. She is pellucid, and bubbles up in
perfect purity; the water as bright over her pebbles as if it were a
mass of silver.

*Al*. You know my fountain, Posidon, and no mistake. It is to her that I
go.

*Pos*. Go, then; and may the course of love run smooth! But pray where
did you meet her? Arcadia and Syracuse, you know!

*Al*. I am in a hurry; you are detaining me, with these superfluous
questions.

*Pos*. Ah, so I am. Be off to your beloved, rise from the sea, mingle
your channels and be one water.
