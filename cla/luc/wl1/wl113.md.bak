# DIALOGUES OF THE GODS

### I

*Prometheus. Zeus*

*Prom*. Release me, Zeus; I have suffered enough.

*Zeus*. Release you? you? Why, by rights your irons should be heavier,
you should have the whole weight of Caucasus upon you, and instead of
one, a dozen vultures, not just pecking at your liver, but scratching
out your eyes. You made these abominable human creatures to vex us, you
stole our fire, you invented women. I need not remind you how you
overreached me about the meat-offerings; my portion, bones disguised in
fat: yours, all the good.

*Prom*. And have I not been punished enough--riveted to the Caucasus all
these years, feeding your bird (on which all worst curses light!) with
my liver?

*Zeus*. ’Tis not a tithe of your deserts.

*Prom*. Consider, I do not ask you to release me for nothing. I offer
you information which is invaluable.

*Zeus*. Promethean wiles!

*Prom*. Wiles? to what end? you can find the Caucasus another time; and
there are chains to be had, if you catch me cheating.

*Zeus*. Tell me first the nature of your 'invaluable' offer.

*Prom*. If I tell you your present errand right, will that convince you
that I can prophesy too?

*Zeus*. Of course it will.

*Prom*. You are bound on a little visit to Thetis.

*Zeus*. Right so far. And the sequel? I trust you now.

*Prom*. Have no dealings with her, Zeus. As sure as Nereus's daughter
conceives by you, your child shall mete you the measure you meted to--

*Zeus*. I shall lose my kingdom, you would say?

*Prom*. Avert it, Fate! I say only, that union portends this issue.

*Zeus*. Thetis, farewell! and for this Hephaestus shall set you free.
