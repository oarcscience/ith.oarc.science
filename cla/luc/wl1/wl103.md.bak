It is not to be understood that all statements here made are either
ascertained facts or universally admitted conjectures. The introduction
is intended merely to put those who are not scholars, and probably have
not books of reference at hand, in a position to approach the
translation at as little disadvantage as may be. Accordingly, we give
the account that commends itself to us, without discussion or reference
to authorities. Those who would like a more complete idea of Lucian
should read Croiset's *Essai* *sur la vie et les oeuvres de Lucien*, on
which the first two sections of this introduction are very largely
based. The only objections to the book (if they are objections) are that
it is in French, and of 400 octavo pages. It is eminently readable.

### 1. LIFE

With the exception of a very small number of statements, of which the
truth is by no means certain, all that we know of Lucian is derived from
his own writings. And any reader who prefers to have his facts at first
rather than at second hand can consequently get them by reading certain
of his pieces, and making the natural deductions from them. Those that
contain biographical matter are, in the order corresponding to

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

the periods of his life on which they throw light, *The Vision,
Demosthenes, Nigrinus, The Portrait-study* and *Defence* (in which
Lucian is *Lycinus*), *The Way to write History, The double Indictment*
(in which he is *The Syrian*), *The Fisher* (*Parrhesiades*), *Swans and
Amber, Alexander*, Hermotimus *(*Lycinus*),* Menippus and Icaromenippus
*(in which* Menippus *represents him),* A literary Prometheus,
Herodotus, Zeuxis, Harmonides, The Scythian*, The Death of Peregrine,
The Book-fancier, Demonax, The Rhetorician's Vade mecum, Dionysus,
Heracles, A Slip of the Tongue, Apology for 'The dependent Scholar.'* Of
these *The Vision* is a direct piece of autobiography; there is
intentional but veiled autobiography in several of the other pieces; in
others again conclusions can be drawn from comparison of his statements
with facts known from external sources.

Lucian lived from about 125 to about 200 A.D., under the Roman Emperors
Antoninus Pius, M. Aurelius and Lucius Verus, Commodus, and perhaps
Pertinax. He was a Syrian, born at Samosata on the Euphrates, of parents
to whom it was of importance that he should earn his living without
spending much time or money on education. His maternal uncle being a
statuary, he was apprenticed to him, having shown an aptitude for
modelling in the wax that he surreptitiously scraped from his school
writing-tablets. The apprenticeship lasted one day. It is clear that he
was impulsive all through life; and when his uncle corrected him with a
stick for breaking a piece of marble, he ran off home, disposed already
to think he had had enough of statuary. His mother took his part, and he
made up his mind by the aid of a vision that came to him the same night.

It was the age of the rhetoricians. If war was not a thing of the past,
the shadow of the *pax Romana* was over all the small states, and the
aspiring provincial's readiest road to fame was through words rather
than deeds. The arrival of a famous

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

rhetorician to lecture was one of the important events in any great
city's annals; and Lucian's works are full of references to the
impression these men produced, and the envy they enjoyed. He himself was
evidently consumed, during his youth and early manhood, with desire for
a position like theirs. To him, sleeping with memories of the stick,
appeared two women, corresponding to *Virtue* and *Pleasure* in
Prodicus's *Choice of Heracles*--the working woman *Statuary*, and the
lady *Culture*. They advanced their claims to him in turn; but before
*Culture* had completed her reply, the choice was made: he was to be a
rhetorician. From her reminding him that she was even now not all
unknown to him, we may perhaps assume that he spoke some sort of Greek,
or was being taught it; but he assures us that after leaving Syria he
was still a barbarian; we have also a casual mention of his offering a
lock of his hair to the Syrian goddess in his youth.

He was allowed to follow his bent and go to Ionia. Great Ionian cities
like Smyrna and Ephesus were full of admired sophists or teachers of
rhetoric. But it is unlikely that Lucian's means would have enabled him
to become the pupil of these. He probably acquired his skill to a great
extent by the laborious method, which he ironically deprecates in *The
Rhetorician's Vade mecum*, of studying exhaustively the old Attic
orators, poets, and historians.

He was at any rate successful. The different branches that a rhetorician
might choose between or combine were: (1) Speaking in court on behalf of
a client; (2) Writing speeches for a client to deliver; (3) Teaching
pupils; (4) Giving public displays of his skill. There is a doubtful
statement that Lucian failed in (1), and took to (2) in default. His
surviving rhetorical pieces (*The Tyrannicide, The Disinherited,
Phalaris*) are declamations on hypothetical cases which might serve
either for (3) or (4); and *The Hall, The Fly, Dipsas*, and perhaps

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Demosthenes*,
suggest (4). A common form of exhibition was for a sophist to appear
before an audience and let them propose subjects, of which he must
choose one and deliver an impromptu oration upon it.

Whatever his exact line was, he earned an income in Ionia, then in
Greece, had still greater success in Italy, and appears to have settled
for some time in Gaul, perhaps occupying a professorial chair there. The
intimate knowledge of Roman life in some aspects which appears in *The
dependent Scholar* suggests that he also lived some time in Rome. He
seems to have known some Latin, since he could converse with boatmen on
the Po; but his only clear reference (*A Slip of the Tongue*, 13)
implies an imperfect knowledge of it; and there is not a single mention
in all his works, which are crammed with literary allusions, of any
Latin author. He claims to have been during his time in Gaul one of the
rhetoricians who could command high fees; and his descriptions of
himself as resigning his place close about his lady's (i.e. Rhetoric's)
person, and as casting off his wife Rhetoric because she did not keep
herself exclusively to him, show that he regarded himself, or wished to
be regarded, as having been at the head of his profession.

This brings us to about the year 160 A.D. We may conceive Lucian now to
have had some of that yearning for home which he ascribes in the
*Patriotism* even to the successful exile. He returned home, we suppose,
a distinguished man at thirty-five, and enjoyed impressing the fact on
his fellow citizens in *The Vision*. He may then have lived at Antioch
as a rhetorician for some years, of which we have a memorial in *The
Portrait-study*. Lucius Verus, M. Aurelius's colleague, was at Antioch
in 162 or 163 A.D. on his way to the Parthian war, and *The
Portrait-study* is a panegyric on Verus's mistress Panthea, whom Lucian
saw there.

A year or two later we find him migrating to Athens, taking

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

his father with him, and at Athens he settled and remained many years.
It was on this journey that the incident occurred, which he relates with
such a curious absence of shame in the *Alexander*, of his biting that
charlatan's hand.

This change in his manner of life corresponds nearly with the change in
habit of mind and use of his powers that earned him his immortality. His
fortieth year is the date given by himself for his abandonment of
Rhetoric and, as he calls it, taking up with Dialogue, or, as we might
say, becoming a man of letters. Between Rhetoric and Dialogue there was
a feud, which had begun when Socrates five centuries before had fought
his battles with the sophists. Rhetoric appeals to the emotions and
obscures the issues (such had been Socrates's position); the way to
elicit truth is by short question and answer. The Socratic method,
illustrated by Plato, had become, if not the only, the accredited
instrument of philosophers, who, so far as they are genuine, are
truth-seekers; Rhetoric had been left to the legal persons whose object
is not truth but victory. Lucian's abandonment of Rhetoric was
accordingly in some sort his change from a lawyer to a philosopher. As
it turned out, however, philosophy was itself only a transitional stage
with him.

Already during his career as a rhetorician, which we may put at 145-164
A.D., he seems both to have had leanings to philosophy, and to have
toyed with dialogue. There is reason to suppose that the *Nigrinus*,
with its strong contrast between the noise and vulgarity of Rome and the
peace and culture of Athens, its enthusiastic picture of the charm of
philosophy for a sensitive and intelligent spirit, was written in 150
A.D., or at any rate described an incident that occurred in that year;
and the *Portrait-study* and its *Defence*, dialogues written with great
care, whatever their other merits, belong to 162 or 163 A.D. But these
had been excursions out of his own province. After settling at Athens he
seems to have adopted the writing of

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

dialogues as his regular work. The *Toxaris*, a collection of stories on
friendship, strung together by dialogue, the *Anacharsis*, a discussion
on the value of physical training, and the *Pantomime*, a description
slightly relieved by the dialogue form, may be regarded as experiments
with his new instrument. There is no trace in them of the characteristic
use that he afterwards made of dialogue, for the purposes of satire.

That was an idea that we may suppose to have occurred to him after the
composition of the *Hermotimus*. This is in form the most philosophic of
his dialogues; it might indeed be a dialogue of Plato, of the merely
destructive kind; but it is at the same time, in matter, his farewell to
philosophy, establishing that the pursuit of it is hopeless for mortal
man. From this time onward, though he always professes himself a lover
of true philosophy, he concerns himself no more with it, except to
expose its false professors. The dialogue that perhaps comes next, *The
Parasite*, is still Platonic in form, but only as a parody; its main
interest (for a modern reader is outraged, as in a few other pieces of
Lucian's, by the disproportion between subject and treatment) is in the
combination for the first time of satire with dialogue.

One more step remained to be taken. In the piece called *A literary
Prometheus*, we are told what Lucian himself regarded as his claim to
the title of an original writer. It was the fusing of Comedy and
Dialogue--the latter being the prose conversation hat had hitherto been
confined to philosophical discussion. The new literary form, then, was
conversation, frankly for purposes of entertainment, as in Comedy, but
to be read and not acted. In this kind of writing he remains, though he
has been often imitated, first in merit as clearly as in time; and
nearly all his great masterpieces took this form. They followed in rapid
succession, being all written, perhaps, between 165 and 175 A.D. And we
make here no further comment upon them, except to

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

remark that they fall roughly into three groups as he drew inspiration
successively from the writers of the New Comedy (or Comedy of ordinary
life) like Menander, from the satires of Menippus, and from writers of
the Old Comedy (or Comedy of fantastic imagination) like Aristophanes.
The best specimens of the first group are *The Liar* and the *Dialogues
of the Hetaerae;* of the second, the *Dialogues of the Dead* and *of the
Gods, Menippus* and *Icaromenippus, Zeus cross-examined;* of the third,
*Timon, Charon, A Voyage to the lower World, The Sale of Creeds, The
Fisher, Zeus Tragoedus, The Cock, The double Indictment, The Ship*.

During these ten or more years, though he lived at Athens, he is to be
imagined travelling occasionally, to read his dialogues to audiences in
various cities, or to see the Olympic Games. And these excursions gave
occasion to some works not of the dialogue kind; the *Zeuxis* and
several similar pieces are introductions to series of readings away from
Athens; The *Way to write History*, a piece of literary criticism still
very readable, if out of date for practical purposes, resulted from a
visit to Ionia, where all the literary men were producing histories of
the Parthian war, then in progress (165 A.D.). An attendance at the
Olympic Games of 169 A.D. suggested *The Death of Peregrine*, which in
its turn, through the offence given to Cynics, had to be supplemented by
the dialogue of *The Runaways. The True History*, most famous, but,
admirable as it is, far from best of his works, presumably belongs to
this period also, but cannot be definitely placed. The *Book-fancier*
and *The Rhetorician's Vade mecum* are unpleasant records of bitter
personal quarrels.

After some ten years of this intense literary activity, producing,
reading, and publishing, Lucian seems to have given up both the writing
of dialogues and the presenting of them to audiences, and to have lived
quietly for many years. The only pieces that belong here are the *Life
of Demonax*, the man

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

whom he held the best of all philosophers, and with whom he had been
long intimate at Athens, and that of Alexander, the Asiatic charlatan,
who was the prince of impostors as Demonax of philosophers. When quite
old, Lucian was appointed by the Emperor Commodus to a well-paid legal
post in Egypt. We also learn, from the new introductory lectures called
*Dionysus* and *Heracles*, that he resumed the practice of reading his
dialogues; but he wrote nothing more of importance. It is stated in
Suidas that he was torn to pieces by dogs; but, as other statements in
the article are discredited, it is supposed that this is the Christian
revenge for Lucian's imaginary hostility to Christianity. We have it
from himself that he suffered from gout in his old age. He solaced
himself characteristically by writing a play on the subject; but whether
the goddess Gout, who gave it its name, was appeased by it, or carried
him off, we cannot tell.
