# DIALOGUES OF THE GODS

### XII

*Aphrodite. Eros*

*Aph*. Child, child, you must think what you are doing. It is bad enough
on earth,--you are always inciting men to do some mischief, to
themselves or to one another;--but I am speaking of the Gods. You change
Zeus into shape after shape as the fancy takes you; you make Selene come
down from the sky; you keep Helius loitering about with Clymene, till he
sometimes forgets to drive out at all. As for the naughty tricks you
play on your own mother, you know you are safe there. But Rhea! how
could you *dare* to set her on thinking of that young fellow in Phrygia,
an old lady like her, the mother of so many Gods?

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Why, you have made
her quite mad: she harnesses those lions of hers, and drives about all
over Ida with the Corybantes, who are as mad as herself, shrieking high
and low for Attis; and there they are, slashing their arms with swords,
rushing about over the hills, like wild things, with dishevelled hair,
blowing horns, beating drums, clashing cymbals; all Ida is one mad
tumult. I am quite uneasy about it; yes, you wicked boy, your poor
mother is quite uneasy: some day when Rhea is in one of her mad fits (or
when she is in her senses, more likely), she will send the Corybantes
after you, with orders to tear you to pieces, or throw you to the lions.
You are so venturesome!

*Eros*. Be under no alarm, mother; I understand lions perfectly by this
time. I get on to their backs every now and then, and take hold of their
manes, and ride them about; and when I put my hand into their mouths,
they only lick it, and let me take it out again. Besides, how is Rhea
going to have time to attend to me? She is too busy with Attis. And I
see no harm in just pointing out beautiful things to people; they can
leave them alone;--it is nothing to do with me. And how would you like
it if Ares were not in love with you, or you with him?

*Aph*. Masterful boy! always the last word! But you will remember this
some day.
