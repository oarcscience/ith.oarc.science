# DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD

### XXIX

*Agamemnon. Ajax*

*Ag*. If you went mad and wrought your own destruction, Ajax, in default
of that you designed for us all, why put the blame on Odysseus? Why
would you not vouchsafe him a look or a word, when he came to consult
Tiresias that day? you stalked past your old comrade in arms as if he
was beneath your notice.

*Aj*. Had I not good reason? My madness lies at the door of my solitary
rival for the arms.

*Ag*. Did you expect to be unopposed, and carry it over us all without a
contest?

*Aj*. Surely, in such a matter. The armour was mine by natural right,
seeing I was Achilles's cousin. The rest of you, his undoubted
superiors, refused to compete, recognizing my claim. It was the son of
Laertes, he that I had rescued scores of times when he would have been
cut to pieces by the Phrygians, who set up for a better man and a
stronger claimant than I.

*Ag*. Blame Thetis, then, my good sir; it was she who, instead of
delivering the inheritance to the next of kin, brought the arms and left
the ownership an open question.

*Aj*. No, no; the guilt was in claiming them--alone, I mean.

*Ag*. Surely, Ajax, a mere man may be forgiven the sin of coveting
honour--that sweetest bait for which each one of us adventured; nay, and
he outdid you there, if a Trojan verdict counts.

*Aj*. Who inspired that verdict <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14)? I
know, but about the Gods we may not speak. Let that pass; but cease to
hate Odysseus? ’tis not in my power, Agamemnon, though Athene's self
should require it of me.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_14"></span>[154:1](wl174.htm#fr_14) Athene is meant. The
allusion is to Homer, *Od*. xi. 547, a passage upon the contest for the
arms of Achilles, in which Odysseus states that 'The judges were the
sons of the Trojans, and Pallas Athene.'
