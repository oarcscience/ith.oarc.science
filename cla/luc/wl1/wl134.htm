<p align="center"><i>Posidon. Alpheus</i></p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. What is the meaning of this, Alpheus? unlike others, when you take your plunge you do not mingle with the brine as a river should; you do not put an end to your labours by dispersing; you hold together through the sea, keep your current fresh, and hurry along in all your original purity; you dive down to strange depths like a gull or a heron; I suppose you will come to the top again and show yourself somewhere or other.</p>  
<p><i>Al</i>. Do not press me, Posidon; a love affair; and many is the time you have been in love yourself.</p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. Woman, nymph, or Nereid?</p>  
<p><i>Al</i>. All wrong; she is a fountain.</p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. A fountain? and where does she flow?</p>  
<p><i>Al</i>. She is an islander--in Sicily. Her name is Arethusa.</p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. Ah, I commend your taste. She is pellucid, and bubbles up in perfect purity; the water as bright over her pebbles as if it were a mass of silver.</p>  
<p><i>Al</i>. You know my fountain, Posidon, and no mistake. It is to her that I go.</p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. Go, then; and may the course of love run smooth! But pray where did you meet her? Arcadia and Syracuse, you know!</p>

<p><i>Al</i>. I am in a hurry; you are detaining me, with these superfluous questions.</p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. Ah, so I am. Be off to your beloved, rise from the sea, mingle your channels and be one water.</p>
