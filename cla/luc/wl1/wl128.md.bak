# DIALOGUES OF THE GODS

### XXI

*Ares. Hermes*

*Ar*. Did you hear Zeus's threat, Hermes? most complimentary, wasn't it,
and most practicable? 'If I choose,' says he, 'I could let down a cord
from Heaven, and all of you might hang on to it and do your very best to
pull me down; it would be waste labour; you would never move me. On the

hand, if I chose to haul up, I should have you all dangling in mid air,
with earth and sea into the bargain and so on; you heard? Well, I dare
say he *is* too much for any of us individually, but I will never
believe he outweighs the whole of us in a body, or that, even with the
makeweight of earth and sea, we should not get the better of him.

*Her*. Mind what you say, Ares; it is not safe to talk like that; we
might get paid out for chattering.

*Ar*. You don't suppose I should say this to every one; I am not afraid
of you; I know you can keep a quiet tongue. I *must* tell you what made
me laugh most while he stormed: I remember not so long ago, when Posidon
and Hera and Athene rebelled and made a plot for his capture and
imprisonment, he was frightened out of his wits; well, there were only
three of them, and if Thetis had not taken pity on him and called in the
hundred-handed Briareus to the rescue, he would actually have been put
in chains, with his thunder and his bolt beside him. When I worked out
the sum, I could not help laughing.

*Her*. Oh, do be quiet; such things are too risky for you to say or me
to listen to.
