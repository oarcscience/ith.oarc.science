<p align="center"><i>Zenophantus. Callidemides</i></p>  
<p><i>Ze</i>. Ah, Callidemides, and how did <i>you</i> come by your end? As for me, I was free of Dinias's table, and there died of a surfeit; but that is stale news; you were there, of course.</p>  
<p><i>Cal</i>. Yes, I was. Now there was an element of surprise about <i>my</i> fate. I suppose you know that old Ptoeodorus?</p>  
<p><i>Ze</i>. The rich man with no children, to whom you gave most of your company?</p>  
<p><i>Cal</i>. That is the man; he had promised to leave me his heir, and I used to show my appreciation. However, it went on such a time; Tithonus was a juvenile to him; so I found a short cut to my property. I bought a potion, and agreed with the butler that next time his master called for wine (he is a pretty stiff drinker) he should have this ready in a cup and present it; and I was pledged to reward the man with his freedom.</p>  
<p><i>Ze</i>. And what happened? this is interesting.</p>  
<p><i>Cal</i>. When we came from bath, the young fellow had two cups ready, one with the poison for Ptoeodorus, and the other for me; but by some blunder he handed me the poisoned cup,</p>

<p>and Ptoeodorus the plain; and behold, before he had done drinking, there was I sprawling on the ground, a vicarious corpse! Why are you laughing so, Zenophantus? I am your friend; such mirth is unseemly.</p>  
<p><i>Ze</i>. Well, it was such a humorous exit. And how did the old man behave?</p>  
<p><i>Cal</i>. He was dreadfully distressed for the moment; then he saw, I suppose, and laughed as much as you over the butler's trick.</p>  
<p><i>Ze</i>. Ah, short cuts are no better for you than for other people, you see; the high road would have been safer, if not quite so quick.</p>
