### 2. PROBABLE ORDER OF WRITINGS

The received order in which Lucian's works stand is admitted to be
entirely haphazard. The following arrangement in groups is roughly
chronological, though it is quite possible that they overlap each other.
It is M. Croiset's, put into tabular form. Many details in it are open
to question; but to read in this order would at least be more
satisfactory to any one who wishes to study Lucian seriously than to
take the pieces as they come. The table will also serve as a rough guide
to the first-class and the inferior pieces. The names italicized are
those of pieces rejected as spurious by M. Croiset, and therefore not
placed by him; we have inserted them where they seem to belong; as to
their genuineness, it is our opinion that the objections made (not by M.
Croiset, who does not discuss authenticity) to the *Demosthenes* and
*The Cynic* at least are, in view of the merits of these, unconvincing.

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

\(i\) About 145 to 160 A.D. Lucian a rhetorician in Ionia, Greece,
Italy, and Gaul.  
The Tyrannicide, a rhetorical exercise.  
The Disinherited.  
Phalaris I & II.  
*Demosthenes*, a panegyric.  
Patriotism, an essay.  
The Fly, an essay.  
Swans and Amber, an introductory lecture.  
Dipsas, an introductory lecture.  
The Hall, an introductory lecture.

\(ii\) About 160 to 164 A.D. After Lucian's return to Asia.  
The Portrait-study, a panegyric in dialogue, 162 A.D.  
Defence of The Portrait-study, in dialogue.  
A Trial in the Court of Vowels, a *jeu d’esprit*.

\(iii\) About 165 A.D. At Athens.  
Pantomime, art criticism in dialogue.  
Anacharsis, a dialogue on physical training.

The Way to write History, an essay in literary criticism.

The next eight groups, iv-xi, belong to the years from about 165 A.D. to
about 175 A.D., when Lucian was at his best and busiest; iv-ix are to be
regarded roughly as succeeding each other in time; x and xi being
independent in this respect. Pieces are assigned to groups mainly
according to their subjects; but some are placed in groups that do not
seem at first sight the most appropriate, owing to specialties in their
treatment; e.g. *The Ship* might seem more in place with vii than with
ix;

but M. Croiset finds in it a maturity that induces him to put it later.

In conclusion, we have to say that this arrangement of M. Croiset's,
which we have merely tabulated without intentionally departing from it
in any particular, seems to us well considered in its broad lines; there
are a few modifications which we should have been disposed to make in
it; but we thought it better to take it entire than to exercise our own
judgment in a matter where we felt very little confidence.
