# DIALOGUES OF THE SEA-GODS

### XII

*Doris. Thetis*

*Dor*. Crying, dear?

*The*. Oh, Doris, I have just seen a lovely girl thrown into a chest by
her father, and her little baby with her; and he gave the chest to some
sailors, and told them, as soon as they were far enough from the shore,
to drop it into the water; he meant them to be drowned, poor things.

*Dor*. Oh, sister, but why? What was it all about? Did you hear?

*The*. Her father, Acrisius, wanted to keep her from marrying. And, as
she was so pretty, he shut her up in an iron room. And--I don't know
whether it's true--but they say that Zeus turned himself into gold, and
came showering down through the roof, and she caught the gold in her
lap,--and it was Zeus all the time. And then her father found out about
it--he is a horrid, jealous old man--and he was furious, and thought she
had been receiving a lover; and he put her into the chest, the moment
the child was born.

*Dor*. And what did she do then?

*The*. She never said a word against her own sentence; *she* was ready
to submit: but she pleaded hard for the child's life, and cried, and
held him up for his grandfather to see; and there was the sweet babe,
that thought no harm, smiling at the waves. I am beginning again, at the
mere remembrance of it.

*Dor*. You make me cry, too. And is it all over?

*The*. No; the chest has carried them safely so far; it is by Seriphus.

*Dor*. Then why should we not save them? We can put the

chest into those fishermen's nets, look; and then of course they will be
hauled in, and come safe to shore.

*The*. The very thing. She shall not die; nor the child, sweet treasure!

F.
