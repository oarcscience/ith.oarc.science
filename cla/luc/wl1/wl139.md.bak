# DIALOGUES OF THE SEA-GODS

### VIII

*Posidon. Dolphins*

*Pos*. Well done, Dolphins!--humane as ever. Not content with your
former exploit, when Ino leapt with Melicertes from the Scironian cliff,
and you picked the boy up and conveyed him to the Isthmus, one of you
swims from Methymna to Taenarum with this musician on his back, mantle
and lyre and all. Those sailors had almost had their wicked will of him;
but you were not going to stand that.

*Dol*. You need not be surprised to find us doing a good turn to a man,
Posidon; we were men before we were fishes.

*Pos*. Yes; I think it was too bad of Dionysus to celebrate his victory
by such a transformation scene; he might have been content with adding
you to the roll of his subjects.--Well, Dolphin, tell me all about
Arion.

*Dol*. From what I can gather, Periander was very fond of him, and was
always sending for him to perform; till Arion grew quite rich at his
expense, and thought he would take a trip to Methymna, and show off his
wealth at home. He took ship accordingly; but it was with a crew of
rogues. He had made no secret of the gold and silver he had with him;
and

when they were in mid Aegean, the sailors rose against him. As I was
swimming alongside, I heard all that went on. 'Since your minds are made
up,' says Arion, 'at least let me get my mantle on, and sing my own
dirge; and then I will throw myself into the sea of my own accord.'--The
sailors agreed. He threw his minstrel's cloak about him, and sang a most
sweet melody; and then he let himself drop into the water, never
doubting but that his last moment had come. But I caught him up on my
back, and swam to shore with him at Taenarum.

*Pos*. I am glad to find you a patron of the arts. This was handsome pay
for a song.
