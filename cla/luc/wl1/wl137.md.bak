# DIALOGUES OF THE SEA-GODS

### VI

*Triton. Posidon. Amymone*

*Tri*. Posidon, there is such a pretty girl coming to Lerna for water
every day; I don't know that I ever saw a prettier.

*Pos*. What is she, a lady? or a mere water-carrier?

*Tri*. Oh no; she is one of the fifty daughters of that Egyptian king.
Her name is Amymone; I asked about that and her family. Danaus
understands discipline; he is bringing them up to do everything for
themselves; they have to fetch water, and make themselves generally
useful.

*Pos*. And does she come all that way by herself, from Argos to Lerna?

*Tri*. Yes; and Argos, you know, is a thirsty place; she is always
having to get water.

*Pos*. Triton, this is most exciting. We must go and see her.

*Tri*. Very well. It is just her time now; I reckon she will be about
half-way to Lerna.

*Pos*. Bring out the chariot, then. Or no; it takes such a time getting
it ready, and putting the horses to. Just fetch me out a good fast
dolphin; that will be quickest.

*Tri*. Here is a racer for you.

*Pos*. Good; now let us be off. You swim alongside.--Here we are at
Lerna. I'll lie in ambush hereabouts; and you keep a look-out. When you
see her coming--

*Tri*. Here she comes.

*Pos*. A charming child; the dawn of loveliness. We must carry her off.

*Am*. Villain! where are you taking me to? You are a kidnapper. I know
who sent you--my uncle Aegyptus. I shall call my father.

*Tri*. Hush, Amymone; it is Posidon.

*Am*. Posidon? What do you mean? Unhand me, villain! would you drag me
into the sea? Help, help, I shall sink and be drowned.

*Pos*. Don't be frightened; no harm shall be done to you. Come, you
shall have a fountain called after you; it shall spring up in this very
place, near the waves; I will strike the rock with my trident.--Think
how nice it will be being dead, and not having to carry water any more,
like all your sisters.

F.
