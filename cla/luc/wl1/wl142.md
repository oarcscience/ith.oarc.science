# DIALOGUES OF THE SEA-GODS

### XI

*The Xanthus. The Sea*

*Xan*. O Sea, take me to you; see how horribly I have been treated; cool
my wounds for me.

*Sea*. What is this, Xanthus? who has burned you?

*Xan*. Hephaestus. Oh, I am burned to cinders! oh, oh, oh, I boil!

*Sea*. What made him use his fire upon you?

*Xan*. Why, it was all that son of your Thetis. He was slaughtering the
Phrygians; I tried entreaties, but he went raging on, damming my stream
with their bodies; I was so sorry for the poor wretches, I poured down
to see if I could make a flood and frighten him off them. But Hephaestus
happened to be about, and he must have collected every particle of fire
he had in Etna or anywhere else; on he came at me, scorched my elms and
tamarisks, baked the poor fishes and eels, made me boil over, and very
nearly dried me up altogether. You see what a state I am in with the
burns.

*Sea*. Indeed you are thick and hot, Xanthus, and no wonder; the dead
men's blood accounts for one, and the fire for the other, according to
your story. Well, and serve you right; assaulting my grandson, indeed!
paying no more respect to the son of a Nereid than that!

*Xan*. Was I not to take compassion on the Phrygians? they are my
neighbours.

*Sea*. And was Hephaestus not to take compassion on Achilles? He is the
son of Thetis.
