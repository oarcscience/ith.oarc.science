### X

*Iris. Posidon*

*Ir*. Posidon: you know that floating island, that was torn away from
Sicily, and is still drifting about under water; you are to bring it to
the surface, Zeus says, and fix it well in view in the middle of the
Aegean; and mind it is properly secured; he has a use for it.

*Pos*. Very good. And when I have got it up, and anchored it, what is he
going to do with it?

*Ir*. Leto is to lie in there; her time is near.

*Pos*. And is there no room in Heaven? Or is Earth too small to hold her
children?

*Ir*. Ah, you see, Hera has bound the Earth by a great oath not to give
shelter to Leto in her travail. This island, however, being out of
sight, has not committed itself.

*Pos*. I see.--Island, be still! Rise once more from the depths; and
this time there must be no sinking. Henceforth you are *terra firma*; it
will be your happiness to receive my brother's twin children, fairest of
the Gods.--Tritons, you will have to convey Leto across. Let all be
calm.--As to that

serpent who is frightening her out of her senses, wait till these
children are born; they will soon avenge their mother.--You can tell
Zeus that all is ready. Delos stands firm: Leto has only to come.
