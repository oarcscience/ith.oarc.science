# APPENDIX.

### EXTRACT I.

From *Maundrell's Travels*. Page 153 (6th ed. 1749).

AN ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR'S JOURNEY TO THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES, ETC.,
IN HIS "JOURNEY FROM ALEPPO TO JERUSALEM." 1697.

*Wednesday, April* 19*th*.

WE went east and by north, and in four hours arrived at Bambych. This
place has no remnants of its ancient greatness, but its walls, which may
be traced all round, and cannot be less than three miles in compass.
Several fragments of them remain on the east side, especially at the
east gate; and another piece of eighty yards long, with towers of large
square stone extremely well built. On the north side I found a stone
with the busts of a man and woman, large as life; and under, two Eagles
carved on it. Not far from it, on the side of a large well, was fixed a
stone with three figures carved on it, in Basso Relievo. They were two
Syrens, which twining their fishy tails together, made a seat, on which
was placed sitting a naked woman, her arms and the Syrens on each side
mutually entwined.

On the west side is a deep pit of about 100 yards diameter. It was low,
and had now water in it, and seemed to have had great buildings all
round it; with the pillars and ruins of which, it is now in part filled
up; but not so much, but that there was still water in it.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Here are a
multitude of subterraneous aqueducts brought to the city; the people
attested no fewer than fifty. You can ride nowhere about the city,
without seeing them. We pitched by one about a quarter of a mile east of
the city, which yields a fine stream; and emptying itself into a valley,
waters it, and makes it extremely fruitful. Here perhaps were the
pastures of the beasts designed for sacrifices. Here are now only a few
poor inhabitants, tho’ anciently all the north side was well inhabited
by Saracens; as may be seen by the remains of a noble Mosque and a
Bagnio a little without the walls.

### EXTRACT II.

POCOCK'S DESCRIPTION OF THE EAST. Vol. II., Pt. I. (1745); pp. 166 and
167..

. . . Bambouch, commonly called by the Franks Bambych, and by the
ancients Hierapolis, which was the Greek name that was given it by
Seleucus; it was called also Bambyce, which seems to be the Syrian name
still retained; and it is very remarkable that Hierapolis in Asia Minor
has much the same name, being called Pambouk Calasi (the cotton castle).
The Tables make it twenty-four miles distant from Zeuma on the Euphrates
and from Ceciliana: They place it also seventy-two miles from Berya,
though this is not above fifty from Aleppo. One of the Syrian names of
this place was Magog; <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md) which was a
city of the Cyrrhestica, and is situated at the south end of a long
vale, which is about a quarter of a mile broad, watered

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

with a stream that is approached by the aqueducts of Bambych; and, to
preserve the water from being wasted, it passes through this vale in an
artificial channel or aqueduct which is built of stone on a level with
the ground. The form of this site was irregular; some parts of the walls
which remain entire, are nine feet thick, and above thirty feet high;
they are cased with hewn stone both inside and out, and are about two
miles in circumference; there was a walk all round on top of the walls,
to which there is an ascent by a flight of stairs, which are built on
arches; the wall is defined by towers on five sides, at the distance of
fifty paces from each other, and there is a low fosse without the walls.
The four gates of the city are about fifteen feet wide, and defended by
a semi-circular tower on each side; the water that supplied the town, as
I was informed, comes from a hill about twelve miles to the south, and
the city being on the advanced ground, the water runs in a channel,
which is near twenty feet below the surface of the earth, and in several
parts of the city there are holes down to the water about five feet
wide, and fifteen long, with two stones across, one about five feet, the
other about ten feet from the top, in order, as may be supposed, to
facilitate the descent of the water; it is probable that they had some
machines to draw up the water at these holes. In the side of one of them
I saw a stone about four feet long, and three wide, on which there was a
relief of two winged persons holding a sheet behind a woman a little
over her head; they seem to carry her on their fishy tails which join
together, and were probably designed to represent the Zephyrs, carrying
Venus to the sea.

At the west part of the town there is a dry bason, which seemed to have
been triangular; it is close to the

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

town wall; at one corner of it there is a round building which seems to
have extended into a bason, and probably was designed in order to behold
with greater conveniency some religious ceremonies or public sports.
This may be the lake where they had sacred fishes that were tame.

About two hundred paces within the east gate there is a raised ground,
on which probably stood a temple of the Syrian goddess Atargatis,
thought to be the same as Ashteroth of the Sidonians, and Cybele of the
Romans, for whose worship this place was so famous. I conjectured it to
be about two hundred feet in front. It is probable that this is the high
ground from which they threw people headlong in their religious
ceremonies, and sometimes even their own children, though they must
inevitably perish. I observed a low wall running from it to the gate, so
that probably it had such a grand avenue as the temple at Gerrhae; and
the enclosure of the city is irregular in this part, as if some ground
had been taken in after the building of the walls to make that grand
entrance; it is probable that all the space north of the temple belonged
to it. A court is mentioned to the north of the temple, and a tower
likewise before the temple, which was built on a terrace twelve feet
high. If this tower was on the high ground I mentioned, the temple must
have been west of it, of which I could see no remains; it possibly might
have been where there are now some ruins of a large building, which
seems to have been a church with a tower; to the west of which there are
some ruinous arches, which might be part of a portico. It is said that
not only Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia, contributed to the support of
this temple, but even Arabia, and the territories of Babylon: To the
west of the town there is a high ground, and some burial places; and so
there are also to the north-east, where

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I saw inscriptions
in the oriental languages, and several crosses. At a little distance
from the north-east corner of the town there is a building like a
church, but within it there is some Gothic work, such as is seen in
antient mosques; and there is a room on each side of the south end; the
whole is ruinous, but very strongly built, and they call it the house of
Phila.

### EXTRACT III.

THE EXPEDITION TO THE EUPHRATES AND TIGRIS.

By COLONEL CHESNEY. London, 1850. Vol. I., Ch. XVIII., pp. 420 and 421.

.       .       .       .       .       .       .       .

\[Nine miles below the mouth of the Sajur, the fine Saracenic structure
of Kal-at-en-Nejm commands the remains of the great Zeugma leading to
Seroug, Haran, etc., and 11 miles directly south by west from thence on
four hills, are the extensive remains of the castle and town of Kara
Bambuche, or Buyuk Munbedj, <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_149.md) which
contains some fine excavations near the river, and also a Zeugma, but in
a more dilapidated state, being without the slopes which, when passing
at Kal-at-en-Nejm, served for landing places at different heights of the
river.\]

Sixteen miles west by south of the latter, and 11½ miles south-west of
the former passage, at about 600 feet above the river Euphrates, the
ruins of the Magog of the Syrians occupy the centre of a rocky plain,
where, by its isolated position, the city must not only have been
deprived of running water, but likewise

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

of every other advantage which was likely to create and preserve a place
of importance. Yet we know that the Syrian city of Ninus Vetus  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md) flourished under the name of Bambyce
 <span id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_151.md) and subsequently of
Hierapolis, <span id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_152.md) or the Sacred City of
the Greeks, <span id="fr_153"></span>[4](#fn_153.md) and that it contained
the rich temple which was plundered by Crassus; <span
id="fr_154"></span>[5](#fn_154.md) finally it bore the name of Munbedj
 <span id="fr_155"></span>[6](#fn_155.md) or Bambuche, and had a succession
of sovereigns in the 5th century of the Hijrah <span
id="fr_156"></span>[7](#fn_156.md). The ancient city was near the eastern
extremity of Commagene, or Euphratensis, which had Samosat at the
opposite extremity. <span id="fr_157"></span>[8](#fn_157.md)

Some ruined mosques and square Saracenic towers, with the remains of its
surrounding walls and ditch, marked the limits of the Muslim city;
within which are four large cisterns, a fine sarcophagus, and, among
other ancient remains the sculptured ruins of an acropolis, and those of
two temples. Of the smaller, the enclosure and portions of seven columns
remain; but it seems to possess little interest compared with the
larger, which may have been that of the Assyrian and Phœnician
Astarte, <span id="fr_158"></span>[9](#fn_158.md) or Astroarche (queen of
stars), which afterwards

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

became the Syrian Atargatis, <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_159.md) or
Venus Decerto. <span id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_160.md) Amongst the remains
of the latter are some fragments of massive architecture, not unlike the
Egyptian, and 11 arches from one side of a square paved court, over
which are scattered the shafts of columns and capitals displaying the
lotus.

A little way westward of the walls there is an extensive necropolis,
which contains many Turkish, with some Pagan, Seljukian, and Syriac
tombs; the last having some almost illegible inscriptions in the ancient
character.
