# INTRODUCTION.

### THE SYRIAN GODDESS IN HISTORY AND ART.

THE dawn of history in all parts of Western Asia discloses the
established worship of a nature-goddess in whom the productive powers of
the earth were personified. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) She is our
Mother Earth, known otherwise as the Mother Goddess or Great Mother.
Among the Babylonians <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) and northern
Semites she was called Ishtar: she is the Ashtoreth of the Bible, and
the Astarte of Phœnicia. In Syria her name was ‘Athar, and in Cilicia it
had the form of ‘Ate (‘Atheh). At Hierapolis, with which we are
primarily concerned, it appears in later Aramaic as Atargatis, a
compound of the Syrian and Cilician forms. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) In Asia Minor, where the influence of the
Semitic language did not prevail, her various names have not survived,
though it is recorded by a later Greek writer as "Ma" at one of her
mountain shrines, and as Agdistis amongst one tribe of the
Phrygians <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) and probably at Pessinus.
These differences, however, are partly

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

questions of local tongue; for in one way and another there was still a
prevailing similarity between the essential attributes and worship of
the nature-goddess throughout Western Asia. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md)

The "origins" of this worship and its ultimate development are not
directly relevant to our present enquiry; but we must make passing
allusion to a point of special interest and wide significance. As
regards Asia Minor, at least, a theory that explains certain abnormal
tendencies in worship and in legend would attribute to the goddess, in
the primitive conception of her, the power of self-reproduction,
complete in herself, a hypothesis justified by the analogy of beliefs
current among certain states of primitive society. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) However that may be, a male companion is
none the less generally associated with her in mythology, even from the
earliest historical vision of Ishtar in Babylonia, <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) where he was known as Tammuz. While evidence
is wanting to define clearly the original position of this deity in
relation to the goddess, <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) the general
tendency of myth and legend in the lands of Syria and Asia Minor, with
which we are

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

specially concerned, reveals him as her offspring, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) the fruits of the earth. The basis of the
myth was human experience of nature, particularly the death of plant
life with the approach of winter and its revival with the spring. In one
version accordingly "Adonis" descends for the six winter months to the
underworld, until brought back to life through the divine influence of
the goddess. The idea that the youth was the favoured lover of the
goddess belongs to a different strain of thought, if indeed it was
current in these lands at all in early times. In Asia Minor at any rate
the sanctity of the goddess's traditional powers was safeguarded in
popular legend by the emasculation of "Attis," and in worship by the
actual emasculation of her priesthood, <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) perhaps the most striking feature of her
cult. The abnormal and impassioned tendencies of her developed worship

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

would be derived, according to this theory, from the efforts of her
worshippers to assist her to bring forth notwithstanding her singleness.
However that may be, the mourning for the death of the youthful god, and
rejoicing at his return, were invariable features of this worship of
nature. It is reasonable to believe that long before the curtain of
history was raised over Asia Minor the worship of this goddess and her
son had become deep-rooted.

There then appeared the Hittites. In relation with Babylonia and Egypt,
these peoples had already become known at the close of the third
millennium B.C.; <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) and, to judge from
the Biblical accounts, numbers of them had settled here and there
throughout Syria and Palestine as early as the days of the
patriarchs. <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) Nothing is known of
their constitution and organization in these days, however; it is not
until their own archives speak that we find them in the fourteenth
century B.C. an already established constitutional power, with their
capital at Boghaz-Keui. <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) Their sway
extended southward into Syria as far as the Lebanon, eastward to the
Euphrates, and at times into Mesopotamia, westward as far as Lydia, and
probably to the sea coast. <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md)

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

Their chief deity was a God omnipotent, the "Lord of Heaven," <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) with lightning in his hand, the
controller of storms ruling in the skies, and, hence identified with the
sun. At Senjerli, in the north of

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Syria, he was
represented simply with trident and hammer, <span
id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md) the emblems of the lightning and the

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

thunder. But a sculpture at Malâtia, on their eastern frontier, shows
him standing on the back of a bull, the emblem of creative powers, <span
id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) and bearing upon his shoulder a bow,
identifying him with a God of Arms,

HITTITE GOD AND GODDESS AT BOGHAZ-KEUI.](tn/fig02.jpg)

</span>

as was natural amongst warlike tribes, His enshrined image is found
carved upon a rocky peak of the Kizil Dagh, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) a ridge that rises from the southern

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

plains on the central plateau of Asia Minor. In the sanctuary near
Boghaz-Keui, clad like their other deities in the Hittite warrior garb,
he has assumed a conventional and majestic appearance, bearded, with the
lightning emblem in one hand and his sceptre in the other, <span
id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) a prototype of Zeus. The scene of which
this sculpture is a part represents the ceremonial marriage of the god
with the Great Mother, <span id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) with the
rites and festivities that accompanied the celebration, so far as mural
decoration permits of treatment of such a theme. From these sculptures
we learn that which is fundamental in the Hittite

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

religion, namely, the recognition of a chief god and goddess, and though
doubtless the outcome of the political conditions, the mating of these
two deities at the proper season would seem to have been peculiarly
natural and appropriate to the old established religion of the land. In
this union, moreover, each god preserved its dignity and individuality,
each cult maintained its proper ceremonies, yet the pair could be
worshipped in common as the divine Father and Mother, the source of all
life, human, animal, and vegetable.

With the goddess there is in these sculptures the image of the
youth <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) who, in the original
tradition, was her necessary companion, representing clearly, in this
instance, her offspring, the fruits of the earth. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) Indeed a later sculpture at Ivrîz seems
to show this god, changed in form but still recognizable, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) as the patron of agriculture, with
bunches of grapes in one hand and ears of corn in the other. Even at
Boghaz-Keui, this youthful deity is already accorded a smaller adjacent
sanctuary, <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) devoted to his cult
alone. Following the great deities are many

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

other figures, forming, as it were, two groups. Accompanying the god are
the minor gods of the Hittite States, who, for the most part, are
similar to himself in general appearance. <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) They are followed by priests and men who
are taking part in the celebration, in which it would appear revelry and
dancing

<span id="img_fig03"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG. 3.—THE
HITTITE BULL-GOD AT EYUK.](tn/fig03.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/fig03.jpg.md)  
FIG. 3.—THE HITTITE BULL-GOD AT EYUK.  
</span>

were not omitted. In the train of the goddess, who like her son stands
upon the back of a lioness, there follow two other goddesses of smaller
size, but similar to herself in appearance, grouped together on a
double-headed eagle. <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) These are
followed by a number of figures of priestesses clad like the goddess;

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

and, surveying all, the noble figure of the King-Priest clad in a
toga-like garment, and holding a curving lituus, the emblem of his
sacred office. <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md)

That which seems to us in our present enquiry the chief feature of these
sculptures is that the worship is clearly common to the god and the
goddess, who occupy the leading positions in equal prominence. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) This interpretation is supported
substantially by sculptures which decorate the main entrance of the
neighbouring Hittite city of Eyuk. The corner stone on the right
represents the goddess seated, <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md)
receiving the worship of her priests; while the corresponding corner
stone on the left shows a Bull-God on a pedestal, <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) with the High

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Priest and
Priestess ministering at his altar. The Bull we have seen to be
identified with the chief Hittite deity, which he seems here to replace.

This conclusion is of importance in our present subject, for Lucian (in
§ [31](tsg07.htm#an_31).md) describes the chief sanctuary of the great
Syrian temple at Hierapolis as containing the common shrine of "Zeus"
and "Hera." His very use of these names suggests the wedded character of
the deities. Had the shrine been that of the Great Mother alone, the god
would not have been accorded an equal prominence near the common altar;
he would have been an "Attis," not a "Zeus." The goddess herself would
have been in the Greek mind a Rhea or Aphrodite, not a Hera; and Lucian
was sufficiently familiar with his subject to be able to discriminate.
As it is, he is perplexed in his identification of the goddess by her
very comprehensive attributes, which included the many virtues and
powers to which the Greek mind assigned separate personifications, known
by different names.  Speaking generally," he says, "she is undoubtedly
Hera, but she has something of the attributes of Athene and of
Aphrodite, and of Selene and of Rhea and of Artemis and of Nemesis and
of the Fates."

To sum up this stage of our argument, the chief Hittite deity is a god
of the skies, identified with the sun; he is all powerful, and in
symbolism is identified with the Bull. In formal sculpture he resembles
Zeus. The chief Hittite goddess is of

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

comprehensive character: the emblems in her hand and her youthful
companion reveal the nature-goddess; while the mural crown, the lion,
and double axe are special symbols of the Great Mother surviving with
the Phrygian Kybele (or Rhea). <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) The
central Hittite cult is that of this mated pair, the Bull-god Zeus and
the Lion nature-goddess. The central cult-images of Hierapolis, as
described by Lucian, are exactly similar. There are the mated pair of
deities: the god is indistinguishable from Zeus, <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) and he is seated on bulls; while the
goddess, who is called for brevity "Hera," as the consort of "Zeus,"
embodies attributes of the nature-goddess or Great Mother, and she is
seated on lions.

The central cult at Hierapolis is thus apparently identical with that
which the Hittites had established in the land 1500 years before Lucian
wrote. It remains to examine such independent evidences as are available
from literary and archaeological sources, to see whether they bear out
the argument. We shall find our main conclusion remarkably
substantiated. But before passing from the evidence of the Hittite
monuments, inasmuch as Lucian's narrative is chiefly descriptive of the
developed cult of the nature-goddess (with the god submerged), it is of
special interest to notice how widespread are the evidences of her
worship in the Hittite period. We

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

have spoken of two of her shrines in the interior, at Boghaz-Keui and
Eyuk. There is a third at Fraktin, in the mountainous country south of
Cæsarea. Here the sculptures are carved on the living rock overlooking a
stream. <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) The goddess is represented
seated behind an altar on which appears her bird. She seems in this case
uniquely to wear the Hittite hat, but the carving is not carried out in
detail. Before the altar her priestess is pouring an oblation. The
counterpart to this group is a Hittite god and worshipper, while between
them is a draped altar of special character.  <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) One of the earliest of her images,
according to Pausanias, <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) is that
which may still be seen on Mount Sipylus, near to Smyrna on the western
coast a gigantic figure of the goddess seated, carved in the living
rock, and distinguished as Hittite handiwork by certain hieroglyphs
carved in the niche. <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) Further east,
in Phrygia, one of different character has been found at Yarre. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) In this sculpture, which is on a movable
stone, we have one of a series of representations in which the goddess,
seated as always, is worshipped in a ceremonial feast or communion. The
funerary character of this class of monument is attested by a similar
sculpture from Karaburshlu, <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) near
Senjerli, in the north of Syria, and other illustrations are found

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

at Marash, where the cup, mirror, and girdle are instructive details of
the scene. <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) The conception of the
Great Mother as goddess of the dead is by no means strained or
unnatural, for the resurrection and future life is a dominant theme in
the universal myth associated with her. And just as the dead year
revived in springtime through her mediation, so she may have been
entreated on behalf of the dead for their well-being or their return to
life. <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) Thus a second class of
similar monument represents the goddess enshrined, with a votary in the
act of worship or adoration. Such are the two sculptures at Eyuk, one
from Sakje-Geuzi, and three from Marash, in the north of Syria. In one
of these, from the last-named place, the goddess is distinguished by the
child upon her knee, and a mirror and bird accompany the group, which is
further remarkable for the lyre before her upon the altar. In others
from this place, a bow appears, held in one case in the hand of the
worshipper, who proffers it towards her above the altar as though
dedicating it to her service and entreating her blessing. A further
sculpture in which the goddess plays a part has been found at
Carchemish, but details of the scene are not yet available. Other
sculptures, resembling these in

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

general appearance, at Senjerli, <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md)
Malâtia, and possibly at Boghaz-Keui itself, in which the personages
taking part in this ceremonial feast are male and female, may possibly
be modifications representing the local king and queen as High Priest
and Priestess, or impersonating the god and goddess in the communion
rite.

In Glyptic art <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) two varieties of
goddess are apparent; the one is robed and seated, and for the most part
resembles the deity in her distinctively Hittite character <span
id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md); the other is naked, and she has been
supposed to have had her origin in this aspect in Syria, whence she
penetrated further east. <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) This
latter form of goddess has its counterpart in numerous small clay and
bronze images, of votive character, which may be found in many places of
Northern Syria. <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) In these the
goddess is represented as naked, with her hands proffering her breasts.
A similar deity, though winged, is represented on a sculptured but
undated monument from Carchemish. <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md)
This is not, however, the Hittite goddess as she is

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

known in Asia Minor, where she is uniformly represented as seated and
robed, and commonly wearing a veil which is thrown back from the face.
Nor is she the Dea Syria described by Lucian, <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) though commonly identified with her by
modern writers. The reason for this identification is probably to be
found in the general tendency towards the development of human passions
in connection with the Syrian cults, and emphasized in the special
characteristics of Astarte of Phœnicia as the goddess presiding over
human birth. <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md)

The Hittites came and went; their dominion over Asia Minor was subject
to repeated onslaughts on every side, from the Egyptians, the Assyrians,
the Vannic tribes, the Cimmerians, the Muski and the Phrygians. Their
empire, moreover, was held together only insecurely by a system of
confederation and alliance which was not apparently of mutual seeking,
but imposed by the Hatti during the period of their supremacy at
Boghaz-Keui; and from the 12th century B.C. it began rapidly to
disintegrate. There is little record of the subsequent events: the
Assyrian annals reveal only a series of sporadic coalitions in Syria, to
resist their oncoming,

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

and a temporary revival of the Hittite States in that region during the
10th and 9th centuries B.C. Before 700 B.C. the fall of Carchemish,
followed by the submission of the region of Taurus and Marash, brought
all semblance of Hittite power to an end. What had happened meanwhile in
Asia Minor in the struggles between the Phrygians and the Hittites can
only be imagined, but in any case by the year 550 B.C., when Crœsus of
Lydia crossed the Halys and took possession of Pteria (Boghaz-Keui), he
found it still in the hands of a Syro-Cappadocian population: thereafter
the political history of Asia Minor becomes largely that of Persia and
Macedonia, of Greece and Rome.

With the Hittites fell their chief god from his predominant place in the
religion of the interior. Whether, indeed, he did not survive elsewhere
than at Hierapolis, in various local guises or legends, noticeably at
Doliche, <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) is a problem into which it
would be irrelevant to enter. But the Great

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mother lived on,
being the goddess of the land. Her cult, modified, in some cases
profoundly, by time and changed political circumstances, was found
surviving at the dawn of Greek history in several places in the
interior. Prominent among these sites is Pessinus in Phrygia, a sacred
city, with which the legend of Kybele and Attis is chiefly associated.
Other districts developed remarkable and even abnormal tendencies in
myth and worship. At Comana, in the Taurus, where the Assyrian armies
were resisted to the last, and the ancient martial spirit still
survives, she became, like Isthar, a goddess of war, identified by the
Romans with Bellona: <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) In Syria,
again, a different temper and climate emphasized the sensuous tendency
of human passions. In all these cases, however, there survived some
uniformity of ceremonial and custom. At each shrine numerous priests,
called Galli, numbering at Comana as many as 5,000, took part in the

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

worship. Women dedicated their persons as an honourable custom, which in
some cases was not even optional, to the service of the goddess. The
great festivals were celebrated at regular seasons with revelry, music,
and dancing, as they had been of old, coupled with customs which tended
to become, in the course of time, more and more orgiastic. These are,
however, matters of common knowledge and may be studied in the classical
writings. Lucian himself adds considerably to our understanding of these
institutions; indeed his tract has been long one of the standard sources
of information, supplying details which have been applied, perhaps too
freely, to the character of the general cult. Religion in the East is a
real part of life, not tending so much as in the West to become
stereotyped or conventionalized, but changing with changes of
conditions, adapted to the circumstances and needs of the
community. <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) So, wherever the goddess
was worshipped there would be variety of detail. It is, however,
remarkable in this case, that throughout the Hittite period, though
wedded and in a sense subordinate to a dominant male deity, and
subsequently down to the age at which Lucian wrote, she maintained, none
the less, her individuality and comprehensive character. Thus, while
Lucian is concerned in his treatise with the cult of an apparently local
goddess of northern Syria, we recognize her as a localised aspect of the
Mother-goddess, whose

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

worship in remoter times had already been spread wide, and so explain at
once the points of clear resemblance in character and in worship to
other nature-goddesses of Syria and Asia Minor.

 

From this general enquiry among the most ancient monuments of the
country into the historical origins of the dual cult at Hierapolis, and
the character of the goddess, we pass in conclusion to the particular
local evidences, more nearly of Lucian's age, that serve to illustrate
and amplify his descriptions. There are two chief sources: firstly, the
local coins, <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) ranging in date from
the time of Alexander down to the 3rd century A.D.; and secondly, the
literary allusions of Macrobius, who lived and wrote about A.D. 400. The
feature of these branches of evidence that first strikes the enquirer is
their obvious reference to a cult and worship which did not change in
its essential features throughout the seven centuries of political
turmoil which they cover. This enables us to realize how the cult might
have been originally established during the remoter days of Hittite
supremacy in the land.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

The coins are not numerous, but they are profoundly instructive: in
particular, one of these, which we shall presently describe, furnishes a
direct illustration of Lucian's description of the sanctuary; while two
others, which are among the earliest, corroborate in certain details the
main point of our argument. In general also, these coins, even those of
the later dates, uniformly reveal the goddess as a lion deity; for
wherever her full form is shown, she is seated on a lion <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) or on a lion-borne throne. <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) Commonly, however, only her head or bust
is given, *e.g.*, in one case, the full face <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) with dishevelled or possibly "radiate"
hair; in another, the profile, <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md)
showing upon her head a mural crown with her veil thrown back. Her name,
Atargatis, is recognizable on these coins, though it takes several
forms. <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) On this point, therefore,
the local evidence confirms the records of Strabo, Pliny, and
Macrobius. <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) The

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

male deity has almost disappeared in the later coins, surviving chiefly
in his symbol, the bull, which in some cases occurs singly as a
counterpart to the lion or lion-goddess on the opposite side of the
coin, <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) and in other cases is shown
in the grip of the lion as though reminiscent of the ultimate triumph of
the cult of the goddess over that of the god. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) In similar fashion, the coins of the
Roman Empire show an imperial eagle triumphing above the lion <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) in several examples.

In two cases, however, the figure of the god does survive. One of these
coins of the period of Alexander, <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md)
shows upon the obverse the figure of the god seated upon a throne,
holding in his left hand a long sceptre, and in the right hand something
which is not distinct. On the reverse side of the coin, the goddess is
represented clad in long robes, with girdle, seated upon a lion; she
holds in her left hand, it would seem, the lightning trident. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md)

Instructive as this coin is, it yields in interest to

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

another of the 3rd century A.D., in which the two deities are shown
seated on their thrones, <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) on either
side of a central object, surmounted by a bird, exactly like the picture
of the sanctuary, which Lucian describes in § [32](tsg07.htm#an_32.md). The
reverse of the coin bears the legend ΘΕΩΙ CϒΡΙΑC (ΙΕΡΟΠ)ΟΛΙΤΩΝ. The
object in the centre is an ædicula, surmounted by a dove, and enclosing
apparently a Roman standard. <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) To the
right is the god, bearded, clad in a long tunic, with a tall *calathos*
on his head, a sceptre in his right hand; he is seated, as it were, upon
bulls, but actually upon a throne to which the head and forepart of
bulls form the side-piece. On the right-hand side, Atargatis, the Syrian
Goddess, is seated similarly upon a throne which two lions support; she
is clothed and girdled, and wears a broad *calathos* or crown upon her
head. In the field of the coin, below these representations, there
appears a lion. The subject of this coin, is, as we have said, an actual
illustration of Lucian's description of the sanctuary: his words are as
follows:—"In this shrine are placed the statues, one of which is Hera,
the other Zeus, though they call him by another name. Both are sitting;
Hera is supported by lions, Zeus is sitting on bulls. . . . Between the
two there stands another image of gold, no part of it resembling the
others: this possesses no special form of its own, but recalls the
characteristics of the other gods. The Syrians

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

speak of it as Semeïon \[σημήϊον\], <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md)
its summit is crowned by a golden pigeon." It is only in reference to
this central object that the description fails, though, in both cases, a
bird is perched upon the top; and doubtless therefore, the design upon
the coin is intended to illustrate something similar to that which
Lucian describes. The object upon he coin is formal, architectural, and

while Lucian tells us particularly that the object between the deities
"recalled characteristics of the other gods." We are reminded by this
reference of a feature in Hittite sculptures, notably those at Fraktin.
Here the pillars of the altars of the goddess and of the god take the
form of a human body from the waist downwards, swathed in many folds of
a fringed garment or robe; and upon the altar of the goddess appears a
bird, doubtless a pigeon

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

or dove, which was in all tradition her peculiar emblem. <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) Lucian's description is more aptly
explained by this symbolism: the object as seen upon the coin had
clearly become conventionalized in Roman times. However that may be, the
dual character of the cult, the god identified with the bull, the
goddess with the lion, is remarkably substantiated.

Further instructive details with regard to these deities are given by
Macrobius, and we may appropriately quote from him the following
significant passage <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md):—"The Syrians
give the name *Adad* to the god, which they revere as first and greatest
of all; his name signifies The One.' They honour this god as all
powerful, but they associate with him the goddess named *Adargatis*, and
assign to these two divinities supreme power over everything,
recognizing in them *the sun* and *the earth*. Without expressing by
numerous names the different aspects of their power, their predominance
is implied by the different attributes assigned to the two divinities.
For the statue of *Adad* is encircled by descending rays, which indicate
that the force of heaven resides in the rays which the sun sends down to
earth: the rays of the statue of *Adargatis* rise upwards, a sign that
the power of the ascending rays brings to life everything which the
earth produces. Below this statue are the figures of lions, emblematic
of the earth; for the same reason that the Phrygians so represent the
Mother of the gods, that is to say, the earth, borne

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

by lions." The character, then, of the god and goddess in the sanctuary
of the temple, the heart of the cult, remained still the same in the
fourth century A.D. as it had been in the beginning. The words which
Macrobius uses would be equally descriptive of the special attributes of
the Hittite Sun-God and the Hittite Earth-Goddess, which we have
described, and the reference to Cybele of Phrygia is also
significant. <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) There is indeed a
faint memory in tradition of a son to Atargatis, <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) corresponding to the youthful companion
of the Hittite goddess at Boghaz-Keui, and hence doubtless to the
"Tammuz" and "Attis" of the various legends; and in one of the effigies
at Hierapolis it is possible to see a later aspect of this deity
corresponding to the Hittite Sandan-Hercules of Ivrîz. <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md)

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

If any doubt remained as to the historical origins of the cult at
Hierapolis, it would be dispelled by another coin, one of the earliest
of the site, on the face of which is the picture and name of the
goddess, Atargatis. <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) On the reverse
of the coin is seen the priest-dynast of the age (about 332 B.C.): his
name is Abd-Hadad, the "servant of Hadad." He is represented at full
length, but owing to the wearing of the coin, some of the details are
lost. The robe

Atargatis, the Syrian Goddess.      Abd-Hadad, the Priest-King.

upon him, however, recalls that of the Hittite priest; and the hat which
he wears is unmistakably the time-honoured conical hat distinctive of
the Hittite peoples. Except in such local religious survival as is here
illustrated, this hat must have long fallen into disuse.

In short, the words of Macrobius, which corroborate and amplify Lucian's
description of the central cult

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

at Hierapolis, are strictly apposite to the chief Hittite god and
goddess. The coins of the site illustrate the same motive; and on one of
the earliest of them, features of Hittite costume are found still
surviving four hundred years after the final overthrow of the Hittite
States in Northern Syria.

The probable mention of "Astarte of the Land of the Hittites," as the
leading Hittite goddess among the witnesses to the treaty with Egypt (c.
B.C. 1271), must be assumed at present to refer <span id="page_2">p.
2</span> to Northern Syria. The allusion is none the less significant,
implying an identification of the Hittite deity with Ishtar. This
rendering of the Egyptian text is due to an emendation suggested by
Müller (*Vorderas. Ges*. VII., 5), and accepted as probable by Breasted,
*Ancient Records of Egypt*, III., 386, n. a.

*W. Asia Inscr.*, ii. pl. 59, 1, 9, Tammuz is said to have been the son
of Sirdu. In the epic of Gilgamesh (Ed. Unguad, *Das Gilgamesch-Epos*,
1911, l. 46, 47) Tammuz is described as the Beloved of \[Ishtar's\]
Youth (*cf*. King, *Babylonian Relig.*, p. r60). Cheyne, *Encyc. Bib.*,
col. 4,893, pointed out that one interpretation of this name refers to
Tammuz as a son of life—true divine child.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[3:9](tsg04.htm#fr_8.md) By some ancient writers
Attis was definitely regarded as the son of Kybele, *e.g.*, Schol. on
Lucian, *Jupiter Tragædus*, 8 (p. 60, Ed. Rabe); Hippolytus, *Refutatio
omn. Haeresium*, v. 9, cited by Frazer, *op. cit.*, p. 219, *q.v.*:
*cf*. also Farnell, *Greece and Babylon*, p. 254, and *Cults*, ii., p.
644, iii. 300, etc. The legends appear in Ovid (*Fast*. iv. 295 *ff*.),
Pausanias (vii. 17, ix. 10). Though commonly regarded as of shepherd
origin (*cf*. Diod. iii., iv., Theocr. xx. 40; Tertul. *de Nat.* i.), he
was deified and worshipped in common with Kybele in the Phrygian temples
(Paus. vii. xx. 2). It is, of course, to his character or fundamental
attributes that we allude in our narrative.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[3:10](tsg04.htm#fr_9.md) This is not, however, the
explanation suggested by Frazer (*op. cit.*, p. 224-237); or by Farnell
(*Cults*, iii., pp. 300-301; *Greece and Babylon*, p. 257, and n. 1). On

latter is the general Semitic name, for Lehmann-Haupt has shown that the
name of the Assyrian storm-god, as ideographically written, should be
read ‘Adad rather than Ramman. (*Sitz. Berl. Ak. Wis.*, 1899, p. 119.)

this is a divine marriage scene is generally accepted (Frazer, *op.
cit.*, p. 108; Farnell, *Greece and Babylon*, p. 264; *cf*. Perrot and
Chipiez, *Histoire de l’Art*, iv., p. 630), but it is the recognition
that the chief god concerned is not a Tammuz or Attis (as supposed by
Frazer, *op. cit.* p. 105; Ramsay, *Journ. Roy. A. S.*, 1885, pp.
113-120, and others), but the Hittite "Zeus," a form of Teshub or Hadad,
that is new in our interpretation and important for our present subject.
On the general question of the *Hieros Gamos*, *cf*. Daremberg, Saglio
and Pottier, *Dictionnaire des Antiquités*, 1904, p. 177; Farnell,
*Cults*, i., p. 184 *ff*; Pausanias, ix., 3; and Frazer, *The Golden
Bough* (1890), pp. 102-103. An oriental version of the rite is suggested
in the legend recorded by Ælian (*Nat. Animalium*, xii. 30) that Hera
bathed in the Chaboras, a tributary of the Euphrates, after her marriage
with Zeus. *Cf*. the marriage of Nin-gir-su and Baü in Babylonian
mythology (Thu. Dangin, *Vorderas Bibl.*, i., p. 77; *cf*. Jastrow,
*Relig. of Bab. and Assyr.*, 1898, p. 59). The details of the scene seem
to indicate that the shrine is essentially that of the goddess (*cf*.
Kybele as a goddess of caves, Farnell, *Cults*, iii., p. 299, and
Ramsay, *Relig. of Anatolia*, in Hastings' *Dict. Bibl.*, extra vol., p.
120), and that the image of the god was carried thereto for this
ceremony. (*Cf*. our note [48](tsg07.htm#fn_123.md), [p.
77](tsg07.htm#page_77), also Farnell, *Greece and Babylon*, p. 268.md). It
is of interest to recall Miss Harrison's arguments, *Classical Rev.*
(1893), p. 24, that Hera had a husband previous to Zeus; also the
association of Dodonian Zeus (Homer, *Il.*, xvi. 233; *Od*., xiv. 327,
xvi. 403; Hesiod ap. Strabo, p. 328) with the Earth-Mother in Greece
(*cf*. Farnell, *Cults*, i., p. 39).

<span id="fn_20"></span>[8:21](tsg04.htm#fr_20.md) *L. H.*, pl. lxv.
Representations of the youthful god are rare (*cf*. Farnell, *Greece and
Babylon*, p. 252); the alternative interpretation would be to see in
this image an Attis-priest, clad like the god; similarly the second of
the two female forms on the double eagle would be the priestess of the
goddess in front. This would seem to be made possible by the analogy of
a sculpture from Carchemish (Hogarth, *Liv. Annals. Arch.*, pl. xxxv.,
i.); but the symbols defining all the figures indicate equally their
divine rank. This view is accepted by Frazer, *op. cit.*, p. 106.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[8:22](tsg04.htm#fr_21.md) For the tradition of a
son to Atargatis, completing the analogy of a divine triad, see below,
n. [70](#fn_69.md).

p. 241.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[9:25](tsg04.htm#fr_24.md) The first two may be
varied aspects of the great god; the seventh is, however, identical with
the local deity of Malâtia. *L. H.* pl. xliv. (ii.).

<span id="fn_25"></span>[9:26](tsg04.htm#fr_25.md) *L. H.*, lxv. The double
eagle is found at Eyuk: we may see in this group the nature-goddess in a
local dual aspect.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[10:27](tsg04.htm#fr_26.md) *L. H.*, pl. lxviii. On
his head a cap (*cf*. Lucian, § 42). His kingly rank is denoted by the
winged disc surmounting his emblems.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[10:28](tsg04.htm#fr_27.md) That the male god was
really dominant would appear from the fact that his name takes first
place in the list of Hittite deities in the Egyptian treaty. *L. H.*, p.
348. This agrees with Macrobius' allusion to Hadad of Hierapolis (see
below, [p. 25](#page_25).md). The general prevalence of his worship among
the Hittite and kindred peoples is seen in the Hittite archives, the
Tell el Amarna tablets, and the Vannic inscriptions. The dual character
of the cult is suggested by the seals of the treaty in question, by some
of the T. A. letters (*e.g.*, Winckler, Nos. 16, 20, from which the name
of the chief goddess among the Mitanni would seem to be accepted as
Ishtar), and possibly by the Hittite-Mitanni treaty.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[10:29](tsg04.htm#fr_28.md) *L. H.*, pl. lxxiii.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[10:30](tsg04.htm#fr_29.md) See our [Fig.
3](#img_fig03.md). The bull freely replaces the god on coins of Hierapolis,
Tarsus, etc. (*B. M. Cat.*, Galatia, etc. *Cf*. also Babélon, *Les
Penses Achéménide*s, pl. li., vol. 8, pl. xxiv., pp. 20, 22). So also in
glyptic art (*cf*. Hayes Ward, *Seal Cyl. of West Asia*, ch. lii.). Both
at Eyuk and at Malâtia, in the sculpture described above, rams and goats
are seen led to the altar as for sacrifice, and the goat accompanies the
leading god at Boghaz-Keui. It is interesting to recall the term
αἰγοφάγος applied to Zeus (Farnell, *Cults*, pp. 96, 750, n. 48), and
the βουφόνια, a chief rite in the Athenian Diipoleia in the festival of
Zeus Polieus. So also in the Cult of Zeus of Attica, a god of
agriculture, eating the ox was regarded as a sacrament, the ox <span
id="page_11">p. 11</span> being regarded as of kin to the worshippers of
the god. On Dionysus as a bull and a goat, see Frazer, *The Golden
Bough*, V. (1912), ch. ix. *Cf*. also our n. [60](#fn_59.md), [p.
22](#page_22.md).

<span id="fn_31"></span>[12:32](tsg04.htm#fr_31.md) *Cf*. §
[31](tsg07.htm#an_31), [p. 70](tsg07.htm#page_70.md). "The effigy of Zeus
recalls Zeus in all its details—his head, his robes, his throne, nor
even if you wished it could you take him for another deity." The term
ZEUS-HADAD would aptly describe the Hittite deity: it is suggested by
the fact that the god of Hierapolis identified with "Zeus" by Lucian is
called "Hadad" by Macrobius. *Cf*. below, [p. 25](#page_25.md).

<span id="fn_43"></span>[15:44](tsg04.htm#fr_43.md) *Ibid*., p. 162. The
myth of Ishtar's Descent to Hades, however, reveals the goddess naked at

goddess are archaic and local.

is always represented as robed on coins of the site, see below, [p.
21](#page_21), and Figs. [5](#img_fig05) and [7](tsg07.htm#img_fig07.md),
also the [frontispiece](tsg00.htm#img_front.md). There is a small bronze
figure in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford (Aleppo, 1889, No. 794), which
possibly represents the goddess. The head-dress is debased; but the
other features—hair, necklace, dress, and facial expression—are'
characteristic and instructive. On the character and relations of the
goddess in general, *cf*. Cumont, "Dea Syria," *Real Encyc.* (Wissowa),
iv., col. 2237.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[16:48](tsg04.htm#fr_47.md) Prof. Lehmann-Haupt
reminds me that the name Mylitta or Mullitta applied to the goddess by
Herodotus (I., 131, 199) is derived from *mu’allidatu*: The Giver (or
Helper) of Birth.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[17:49](tsg04.htm#fr_48.md) Doliche is near Aintab,
not far north-west from Hierapolis. The worship of Jupiter Dolichenus
was introduced to the Roman army by Syrian soldiers (*cf*. Cumont,
*Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism*, pp. 113, 117, 147 and 263, n.
23; also in Wissowa's *Real Encyc.* iv., DEA SYRIA, col. 2243). The god
stands on a bull holding the lightning and the double axe. (See the
illustration in Roscher's *Lexikon*, DOLICHENUS, and especially the fine
sculpture at Wiesbaden, published in the *Bonner Jahrbücher*, 1901, pl.
viii., and compare with the Hittite Hadad of Malâtia, our Fig.
[1](#img_fig01).md). His consort is a lion goddess. She is described on
inscriptions (*C. I. L.*, vi. 367, 413) by the name "Hera Sancta," which
is parallel to the references to the Syrian goddess on inscriptions
found at Delos, where the cult had been established by colonists during
the second century B.C. ("Fouilles à Delos," *Bull. Corr. Hell*., 1882,
p. 487); thus (in No. 15), Ἁγνῃ Ἃφροδίτῃ Ἀταργάτι καὶ Ἀδάδου; (No. 18)
Ἀταργάτει ἁγνῇ θεῷ; (No. 19) ἁγνῆι θεῶι Ἀταργάτει. (*Cf*. Cumont, DEA

coin, <span id="page_18">p. 18</span> Hill. *Jour. Hell. Stud.*, xxxi.,
p. 62). The Anatolian character of the god is recognised by Kan, *De

Sarre's *D. Oriental. Feldzeichen*), in KLIO III. (1903), pp. 342-343.
So, too, the god and goddess of Heliopolis (Baalbek), identified with
the bull and lion respectively, resemble the Hadad and Atargatis of
Hierapolis and the original Hittite pair of divinities (*cf*. Dussaud in
*Rev. Arch.*, 1904, pt. ii., p. 246, etc.). *Cf*. also, the "Jupiter" of
the Venasii, Strabo, xii., ii. 6. The subject of the Phœnician and
Cilician analogous mated divinities is more complex, but both regions
were at one time or another within the Hittite political sphere of
influence. An instructive cubical seal from near Tarsus, now in the
Ashm. Mus., Oxford (publ. Sayce, *Jour. Arch. Inst.*, 5887, pl. xliv.,
Messerschmidt, *Corpus Inscr. Hit.*, pl. xliii., i.), shows upon its
chief face the two Hittite divinities in characteristic aspect, but the
other faces are devoted to the cult of the goddess.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[18:50](tsg04.htm#fr_49.md) An emblem of the
priesthood of Bellona was the double axe. *Cf*. Guigniant, *Nouv. Gall.
Mythol.*, p. 120; also Montelius, in *Folk Lore*, xxi. (1910), i. p. 60
*ff*.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[19:51](tsg04.htm#fr_50.md) *Cf*. the pertinent
remarks by Robertson-Smith, *Relig. Sem.*, especially p. 58, on the
change of the Mother Goddess from an unmarried to a married state.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[20:52](tsg04.htm#fr_51.md) Our chief sources in
this regard have been the coins in the Num. Dept. of the Brit. Mus. and
in the Bib. Nationale, Paris; Wroth, *Cat. of Coins of Galatia,
Cappadocia, and Syria* (1899); Waddington, in *Revue Numismatique*,
(1861). Six, in *Num. Chron.* (1878). Babélon, *Les Perses Achéménides*
(1890); Luynes, *Satrapies et Phénicie*, (1846); Neumann, (*Pop. et

Shrines" (*Jour. Hell. Stud.*, xxxi. 9, 11), and "Some Palestinian
Cults" (*Proc. Brit. Acad.*, v, 1912). To Mr. Hill we are specially
indebted for suggestions and help in this enquiry.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[21:57](tsg04.htm#fr_56.md) The familiar reading is
‏עתרעתה‎ (see [frontispiece](tsg00.htm#img_front.md), No. 2, and [Fig.
5](#img_fig05), [p. 27](#page_27).md), which is separable without
difficulty into ‏עתר‎ (‘Atar), the Aramaic form of ‏עשתרת‎ (Astarte) and
‏עתה‎ (‘Até or ‘Atheh); reading thus ‘Atar-‘ate. See note
[25](tsg07.htm#fn_100), [p. 52](tsg07.htm#page_52.md); and *cf*. Dussaud,
"Notes mythol. Syriees," in *Rev. Arch.* (1904), p. 226. The legend
‏יכונעתה‎, Yekun-‘ate (Six, *loc. cit.*, No. 3), indicates the
separability of ‘Ate (Atheh) as a distinct name. The legend on our No.
8, ‏עתהט‎, is possibly a contraction of ‏עתה‎ and (‏ובה‎)‏ט‎, *Cf*. Six,
*op. cit.*, p. 107; *cf*. also Movers, *Phœn*., i., pp. 307, 600. But
see Ed. Meyer, *Gesch. des Alth.*, i., pp. 307-308.

other sites, *e.g.*, Aradus, Byblos, Tarsus, etc., freely illustrate the
same themes. *Cf*. the epithet applied to the Lions of Kybele by
Sophocles, *Philoktetes*, i. 401 (ἰὼ μάκαιρα ταυροκτόνων λεόντων
ἔφεδρε). On this point, see Crowfoot, *J. H. S.*, 1900, p. 118, who
argues the theme to be symbolical of the death of the god, whether Attis
or Dionysus. So Ishtar, in the epic of Gilgamesh, is accused of being
the cause of the death of Tammuz, and of her lion (Ungnad, *Das
Gilgamesch Epos*, p. 31, ll. 52 f).

<span id="fn_62"></span>[22:63](tsg04.htm#fr_62.md) We have discussed the
legend of this coin in n. [57](#fn_56). M. Six (*loc. cit.*.md), following
Movers, accepts the theoretical reading "Baal-Kevan" as the name of the
god.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[23:64](tsg04.htm#fr_63.md) See our [Fig.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[23:65](tsg04.htm#fr_64.md) Six (*Num. Chron.*,
*loc. cit.*, p. 119) describes the object as a legionary eagle; but this
is somewhat misleading.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[24:66](tsg04.htm#fr_65.md) Professor Bosanquet
suggests that the Greek word was possibly used in the sense of the Latin
*Signum*.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[25:67](tsg04.htm#fr_66) See pp. [14](#page_14.md),
[15](#page_15), and n. [65](tsg07.htm#fn_140.md), pp.

Ch. xxiii.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[26:69](tsg04.htm#fr_68.md) In general aspect the
Phrygian goddess is indeed hardly distinguishable from the Hierapolitan
goddess as described by Lucian. Compare our illustration of Rhea or
Kybele, from a Roman lamp ([Fig. 8](tsg07.htm#img_fig08.md), [p.
72](tsg07.htm#page_72).md), with the representation in [Fig.
7](tsg07.htm#img_fig07), [p. 70](tsg07.htm#page_70.md). This resemblance is
further seen in a relief in the Vatican (*Vatican Kat*., i., Plates,
*Gall.-Lapidara*, *Tf*. 30, No. 152), described in *C. I. L.*, vi., No.
423: "Superne figura Rheæ cornu copiæ, timone, modio ornatæ, stans inter
duos leones"—which, however, Drexler (in Roscher's *Lexikon*, I., col.
1991) proposes to identify with Atargatis rather than Rhea.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[26:70](tsg04.htm#fr_69.md) Xanthos the Lydian
relates that "Atargatis" was taken prisoner by the Lydian Mopsus and
thrown into the lake at Ascalon (sacred to Derceto; see n.
[25](tsg07.htm#fn_100), [p. 52](tsg07.htm#page_52).md), with her son Ἰχθύς
(*Athen*. viii. 37). On the proposed identification of the son with
Simios, the lover of Atargatis (Diod. ii. 4), etc., see Dussaud, *Rev.
Arch.* (1904), ii., p. 257, who indicates the analogy of the
"Hierapolitan triad, Hadad, Atargatis and Simios," with the
Heliopolitan, Jupiter, Venus and Mercury. He believes (p. 259) the triad
of Hadad to have been of Babylonian origins, implanted at Hierapolis, to
reign there through Syria, Palestine and Phœnicia. "Il ne nous
appartient pas de rechercher ses migrations et ses influences en Asie
Mineure." There is an interesting representation of a Syrian triad in
the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (1912, 83).
