Widely hailed as the first science fiction story, A True Story, by
Lucian of Samosata is a voyage to the edges of the universe and reason.
The title is the first clue that this will be a tall tale. As much a
predecessor of [Douglas
Adams](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0517226952/internetsacredte)
as Jules Verne, Lucian's fantasy explores not only outer space (where he
brokers war and peace between the inhabitants of the sun and moon), but
also the Elysian fields, the geography of the Odyssey, and the interior
of a giant whale. We get to meet Homer, Pythagoras, Socrates, and other
immortals, as well as a host of bizarre creatures. The text is riddled
with puns, innuendo, parody and satire; however most of this humor will
escape the modern reader. Suffice it to say that this was considered
pretty funny in the second century C.E. The narrative breaks off in the
second book. Whether there were more adventures or Lucian just ran out
of ideas is unknown.

This edition includes the English translation of A.M. Harmon, published
as part of volume I of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Lucian. It
has parallel Greek text on a page by page basis. Each of the two books
is about 250 kilobytes, so they may take awhile to load on a slow
connection. If you have trouble viewing the Greek text in your browser,
you should refer to sacred-texts' [Unicode troubleshooting
page](../../../unicode).

Lucian also wrote another proto-science-fictional piece, [Icaromenippus,
an Aerial Expedition](../wl3/wl309), available at this site in the
Fowler and Fowler translation.
