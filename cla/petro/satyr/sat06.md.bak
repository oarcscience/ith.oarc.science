# CHAPTER FIVE

The third day had now arrived, the date appointed for the free banquet
at Trimalchio's; but with so many wounds as we had, we deemed it better
policy to fly than to remain where we were. So we made the best of our
way to our inn, and our hurts being only skin-deep after all, we lay in
bed and dressed them with wine and oil.

Still one of the rascals was lying on the ground disabled, and we were
afraid we might yet be discovered. Whilst we were still debating sadly
with ourselves how we might best escape the storm, a slave of
Agamemnon's broke into our trembling conclave, crying, "What! don't you
recollect whose entertainment it is this day?--Trimalchio's, a most
elegant personage; he has a time-piece in his dining-room and a
trumpeter specially provided for the purpose keeps him constantly
informed how much of his lifetime is gone." So, forgetting all our
troubles, we proceed to make a careful toilette, and bid Giton, who had
always hitherto been very ready to act as servant, to attend us at the
bath.

\[XXVII <span id="XXVII"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl027.md) \]
Meantime in our gala dresses, we began to stroll about, or rather to
amuse ourselves by approaching the different groups of ball-players.
Amongst these we all of a sudden catch sight of a bald-headed old man in
a russet tunic, playing ball amid a troupe of long-haired boys. It was
not however so much the boys, though these were well worth looking at,
that drew us to the spot, as the master himself, who wore sandals and
was playing with green balls. He never stooped for a ball that had once
touched ground, but an attendant stood by with a sackful, and supplied
the players as they required them. We noticed other novelties too. For
two eunuchs were stationed at opposite points of the circle, one holding
a silver chamber-pot, while the other counted the balls, not those that
were in play and flying from hand to hand, but such as fell on the
floor.

We were still admiring these refinements of elegance when Menelaus runs
up, saying, "See! that's the gentleman you are to dine with; why! this
is really nothing else than a prelude to the entertainment." He had not
finished speaking when Trimalchio snapped his fingers, and at the signal
the eunuch held out the chamber-pot for him, without his ever stopping
play. After easing his bladder, he called for water, and having dipped
his hands momentarily in the bowl, dried them on one of the lads' hair.

\[XXVIII <span id="XXVIII"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl028.md) \]
There was no time to notice every detail; so we entered the bath, and
after stewing in the sweating-room, passed instantly into the cold
chamber. Trimalchio, after being drenched with unguent, was being rubbed
down, not however with ordinary towels but with pieces of blanketing of
the softest and finest wool. Meanwhile three bagnio doctors were
swilling Falernian under his eyes; and seeing how the fellows were
brawling over their liquor and spilling most of it, Trimalchio declared
it was a libation they were making in his particular honor.

Presently muffled in a wrap-rascal of scarlet frieze, he was placed in a
litter, preceded by four running-footmen in tinseled liveries, and a
wheeled chair, in which his favorite rode, a little old young man,
sore-eyed and uglier even than his master. As the latter was borne
along, a musician took up his place at this head with a pair of
miniature flutes, and played softly to him, as if he were whispering
secrets in his ear. Full of wonder we follow the procession and arrive
at the same moment as Agamemnon at the outer door, on one of the pillars
of which was suspended a tablet bearing the words:

ANY SLAVE  
GOING ABROAD WITHOUT THE MASTER'S  
PERMISSION  
SHALL RECEIVE ONE HUNDRED LASHES

Just within the vestibule stood the doorkeeper, dressed in green with a
cherry-colored sash, busy picking peas in a silver dish. Over the
threshold hung a gold cage with a black and white magpie in it, which
greeted visitors on their entrance.

\[XXIX <span id="XXIX"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl029.md) \] But as I
was staring open-eyed at all these fine sights, I came near tumbling
backwards and breaking my legs. For to the left hand as you entered, and
not far from the porter's lodge, a huge chained dog was depicted on the
wall, and written above in capital letters: 'WARE DOG! 'WARE DOG! My
companions made merry at my expense; but soon regaining confidence, I
fell to examining the other paintings on the walls. One of these
represented a slave-market, the men standing up with labels round their
necks, while in another Trimalchio himself, wearing long hair, holding a
caduceus in his hand and led by Minerva, was entering Rome. Further on,
the ingenious painter had shown him learning accounts, and presently
made steward of the estate, each incident being made clear by
explanatory inscriptions. Lastly, at the extreme end of the portico,
Mercury was lifting the hero by the chin and placing him on the highest
seat of a tribunal. Fortune stood by with her cornucopia, and the three
Fates, spinning his destiny with a golden thread.

I noticed likewise in the portico a gang of running-footmen exercising
under a trainer. Moreover I saw in a corner a vast armory; and in a
shrine inside were ranged Lares of silver, and a marble statue of Venus,
and a golden casket of ample dimensions, in which they said the great
man's first beard was preserved. I now asked the hall-keeper what were
the subjects of the frescoes in the atrium itself? "The Iliad and
Odyssey," he replied, "and on your left the combat of gladiators given
under Laenas."

\[XXX <span id="XXX"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl030.md) \] We had no
opportunity of examining the numerous paintings more minutely, having by
this time reached the banquet-hall, at the outer door of which the
house-steward sat receiving accounts. But the thing that surprised me
most was to notice on the doorposts of the apartment fasces and axes
fixed up, the lower part terminating in an ornament resembling the
bronze beak of a ship, on which was inscribed:

TO GAIUS POMPEIUS TRIMALCHIO  
AUGUSTAL SEVIR,  
CINNAMUS HIS TREASURER

Underneath this inscription hung a lamp with two lights, depending from
the vaulting. Two other tablets were attached to the doorposts. One, if
my memory serves me, bore the following inscription:

ON DECEMBER THIRTIETH AND  
THIRTY-FIRST  
OUR MASTER GAIUS DINES ABROAD

The other showed the phases of the moon and the seven planets, while
lucky and unlucky days were marked by distinctive studs.

When, sated with all these fine sights, we were just making for the
entrance of the banquet-hall, one of the slaves, stationed there for the
purpose, called out, "Right foot first!" Not unnaturally there was a
moment's hesitation, for fear one of us should break the rule. But this
was not all; for just as we stepped out in line right leg foremost,
another slave, stripped of his outer garments, threw himself before our
feet, beseeching us to save him from punishment. Not indeed that his
fault was a very serious one; in point of fact the Intendant's clothes
had been stolen when in his charge at the bath,--a matter of ten
sesterces or so at the outside. So facing about, still right foot in
front, we approached the Intendant, who was counting gold in the hall,
and asked him to forgive the poor man. He looked up haughtily and said,
"It's not so much the loss that annoys me as the rascal's carelessness.
He has lost my dinner robes, which a client gave me on my
birthday,--genuine Tyrian purple, I assure you, though only once dipped.
But there! I will pardon the delinquent at your request."

\[XXXI <span id="XXXI"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl031.md) \] Deeply
grateful for so signal a favor, we now returned to the banquet-hall,
where we were met by the same slave for whom we had interceded, who to
our astonishment overwhelmed us with a perfect storm of kisses, thanking
us again and again for our humanity. "Indeed," he cried, "you shall
presently know who it is you have obliged; the master's wine is the
cup-bearer's thank-offering."

Well! at last we take our places, Alexandrian slave-boys pouring snow
water over our hands, and others succeeding them to wash our feet and
cleanse our toe-nails with extreme dexterity. Not even while engaged in
this unpleasant office were they silent, but sang away over their work.
I had a mind to try whether all the house servants were singers and
accordingly asked for a drink of wine. Instantly an attendant was at my
side, pouring out the liquor to the accompaniment of the same sort of
shrill recitative. Demand what you would, it was the same; you might
have supposed yourself among a troupe of pantomime actors rather than at
a respectable citizen's table.

Then the preliminary course was served in very elegant style. For all
were now at table except Trimalchio, for whom the first place was
reserved, by a reversal of ordinary usage. Among the other hors
d'oeuvres stood a little ass of Corinthian bronze with a packsaddle
holding olives, white olives on one side, black on the other. The animal
was flanked right and left by silver dishes, on the rim of which
Trimalchio's name was engraved and the weight. On arches built up in the
form of miniature bridges were dormice seasoned with honey and
poppy-seed. There were sausages, too, smoking hot on a silver grill, and
underneath (to imitate coals) Syrian plums and pomegranate seeds.

\[XXXII <span id="XXXII"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl032.md) \] We
were in the middle of these elegant trifles when Trimalchio himself was
carried in to the sound of music, and was bolstered up among a host of
tiny cushions, a sight that set one or two indiscreet guests laughing.
And no wonder; his bald head poked up out of a scarlet mantle, his neck
was closely muffled, and over all was laid a napkin with a broad purple
stripe or laticlave, and long fringes hanging down either side. Moreover
he wore on the little finger of his left hand a massive ring of silver
gilt, and on the last joint of the next finger a smaller ring,
apparently of solid gold, but starred superficially with little
ornaments of steel. Nay! to show this was not the whole of his
magnificence, his left arm was bare, and displayed a gold bracelet and
an ivory circlet with a sparkling clasp to put it on.

\[XXIII <span id="XXIII"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl023.md) \] After
picking his teeth with a silver toothpick, "My friends," he began, "I
was far from desirous of coming to table just yet, but that I might not
keep you waiting by my own absence, I have sadly interfered with my own
amusement. But will you permit me to finish my game?" A slave followed
him, bearing a draughtsboard of terebinth wood and crystal dice. One
special bit of refinement I noticed; instead of the ordinary black and
white men he had medals of gold and silver respectively.

Meantime, whilst he is exhausting the vocabulary of a tinker over the
game, and we are still at the hors d'oeuvres, a dish was brought in with
a basket on it, in which lay a wooden hen, her wings outspread round her
as if she were sitting. Instantly a couple of slaves came up, and to the
sound of lively music began to search the straw, and pulling out a lot
of peafowl's eggs one after the other, handed them round to the company.
Trimalchio turns his head at this, saying, "My friends, it was by my
orders the hen set on the peafowl's eggs yonder; but by God! I am very
much afraid they are half-hatched. Nevertheless we can try whether they
are eatable." For our part, we take our spoons, which weighed at least
half a pound each, and break the eggs, which were made of paste. I was
on the point of throwing mine away, for I thought I discerned a chick
inside. But when I overheard a veteran guest saying, "There should be
something good here!" I further investigated the shell, and found a very
fine fat beccafico swimming in yolk of egg flavored with pepper.

\[XXXIV <span id="XXXIV"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl034.md) \]
Trimalchio had by this time stopped his game and been helped to all the
dishes before us. He had just announced in a loud voice that any of us
who wanted a second supply of honeyed wine had only to ask for it, when
suddenly at a signal from the band, the hors d'oeuvres are whisked away
by a troupe of slaves, all singing too. But in the confusion a silver
dish happened to fall and a slave picked it up again from the floor;
this Trimalchio noticed, and boxing the fellow's ears, rated him soundly
and ordered him to throw it down again. Then a groom came in and began
to sweep up the silver along with the other refuse with his besom.

He was succeeded by two long-haired Ethiopians, carrying small leather
skins, like the fellows that water the sand in the amphitheater, who
poured wine over our hands; for no one thought of offering water.

After being duly complimented on this refinement, our host cried out,
"Fair play's a jewel!" and accordingly ordered a separate table to be
assigned to each guest. "In this way," he said, "by preventing any
crowding, the stinking servants won't make us so hot."

Simultaneously there were brought in a number of wine-jars of glass
carefully stoppered with plaster, and having labels attached to their
necks reading:

FALERNIAN; OPIMIAN VINTAGE  
ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD.

Whilst we were reading the labels, Trimalchio ejaculated, striking his
palms together, "Alackaday! to think wine is longer lived than poor
humanity! Well! bumpers then! There's life in wine. 'Tis the right
Opimian, I give you my word. I didn't bring out any so good yesterday,
and much better men than you were dining with me."

So we drank our wine and admired all this luxury in good set terms. Then
the slave brought in a silver skeleton, so artfully fitted that its
articulations and vertebrae were all movable and would turn and twist in
any direction. After he had tossed this once or twice on the table,
causing the loosely jointed limbs to take various postures, Trimalchio
moralized thus:

Alas! how less than naught are we;  
   Fragile life's thread, and brief our day!  
What this is now, we all shall be;  
   Drink and make merry while you may.
