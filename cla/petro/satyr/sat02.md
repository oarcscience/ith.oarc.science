# THE SATYRICON

## CHAPTER ONE

\[I <span id="I"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl001.md) \] Such a long
time has passed since first I promised you the story of my adventures I
am resolved to keep my word today, seeing we are happily met together to
season those matters with lively conversation and tales of a merry and
diverting sort.

Fabricius Veiento was discoursing very wisely to us just now on the
follies of superstition, exposing the various forms of priestly
charlatanry, the holy men's mania for prophecy, and the effrontery they
display in expounding mysteries they very often utterly fail to
comprehend themselves. \[I <span
id="I"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl001.md) \] Is it not much the same
type of madness that afflicts our declaimers, who shout: "These wounds I
got, defending our common liberties; this eye I lost in your behalf.
Give me a helping hand to lead me to my children, for my poor maimed
limbs refuse to bear my weight." Even such extravagances might be borne,
if they really served to guide beginners in the way of eloquence; but
all pupils gain by these high-flown themes, these empty sounding
phrases, is this, that on entering the forum they imagine themselves
transported into a new and strange world.

This is the reason, in my opinion, why young men grow up such blockheads
in the schools, because they neither see nor hear one single thing
connected with the usual circumstances of everyday life, nothing but
stuff about pirates lurking on the seashore with fetters in their hands,
tyrants issuing edicts to compel sons to cut off their own fathers'
heads, oracles in times of pestilence commanding three virgins or more
to be sacrificed to stay the plague,--honey-sweet, well-rounded
sentences, words and facts alike as it were, besprinkled with poppy and
sesame.

\[II <span id="II"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl002.md) \] Under such a
training it is no more possible to acquire good taste than it is not to
stink, if you live in a kitchen. Give me leave to tell you that you
rhetoricians are chiefly to blame for the ruin of Oratory, for with your
silly, idle phrases, meant only to tickle the ears of an audience, you
have enervated and deboshed the very substance of true eloquence.

Young men were not bound down to declamations in the days when Sophocles
and Euripides found the very words they wanted to best express their
meaning. No cloistered professor had as yet darkened men's intellects,
when Pindar and the nine Lyric bards shrank from emulating the Homeric
note. And not to cite poets exclusively,--I cannot see that either Plato
or Demosthenes ever practised this sort of mental exercise. A noble, and
so to say chaste, style is not overloaded with ornament, not turgid; its
own natural beauty gives it elevation.

Then after a while this windy, extravagant deluge of words invaded
Athens from Asia, and like a malignant star, blasting the minds of young
men aiming at lofty ideals, instantly broke up all rules of art and
struck eloquence dumb. Since that day who has reached the perfection of
Thucydides, the glory of Hyperides? Nay! not a poem has been written of
bright and wholesome complexion; but all, as if fed on the same
unhealthy diet, have lacked stamina to attain old age. Painting moreover
shared the same fate, after Egypt presumptuously invented a compendious
method for that noble Art.

\[III <span id="III"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl003.md) \] Such and
suchlike reflections I was indulging in one day before a numerous
audience, when Agamemnon came up, curious to see who it was they were
listening to so attentively. Well! he declined to allow me to declaim
longer in the Portico than he had himself sweated in the schools but:
"Young man," he cries, "seeing your words are something better than mere
popular commonplaces, and--a very rare occurrence--you are an admirer of
sound sense, I will confide to you a professional secret. In the choice
of these exercises it is not the masters that are to blame. They are
forced to be just as mad as all the rest; for if they refuse to teach
what pleases their scholars, they will be left, as Cicero says, to
lecure to empty benches. Just as false-hearted sycophants, scheming for
a seat at a rich man's table, make it their chief business to discover
what will be most agreeable hearing to their host, for indeed their only
way to gain their end is by cajolement and flattery; so a professor of
Rhetoric, unless like a fisherman he arm his hook with the bait he knows
the fish will take, may stand long enough on his rock without a chance
of success.

\[IV <span id="IV"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl004.md) \] "Whose fault
is it then? It is the parents deserve censure, who will not give their
children the advantages of a strict training. In the first place their
hopes, like everything else, are centered in ambition, and so being
impatient to see their wishes fulfilled, they hurry lads into the forum
when still raw and half taught, and indue mere babes with the mantle of
eloquence, an art they admit themselves to be equaled by none in
difficulty. If only they would let them advance step by step in their
tasks, so that serious students might be broken in by solid reading,
steady their minds with the precepts of philosophy, chasten their style
with unsparing correction, study deep and long what they propose to
imitate, and refuse to be dazzled by puerile graces, then and then only
would the grand old type of Oratory recover its former authority and
stateliness. Nowadays, boys waste their time at school; as youths, they
are jeered at in the forum, and what is worse than either, no one will
acknowledge, as an old man, the faultiness of the teaching he received
in his younger days.

"But that you may not imagine I disapprove of satirical impromptus in
the Lucilian vein, I will myself throw my notions on this matter into
verse:

\[V <span id="V"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl005.md) \] "He that would
be an orator, must strive  
To follow out the discipline of old,  
And heed the laws of stern frugality;  
Not his to haunt the Court with fawning brow,  
Nor sit a flatterer at great folks' boards;  
Not his with boon companions o'er the wine  
To overcloud his brain, nor at the play  
To sit and clap, agape at actors' tricks.  
But whether to Tritonia's famous halls  
The Muses lead his steps, or to those walls  
That Spartan exiles rear'd or where  
The Sirens' song thrill'd the enraptured air  
Of all his tasks let Poesy be first,  
And Homer's verse the fount to quench his thirst.  
Soon will be master deep Socratic lore,  
And wield the arms Demosthenes erst bore.  
Then to new modes must he in turn be led,  
And Grecian wit to Roman accents wed.  
Nor in the forum only will he find  
Meet occupation for his busy mind;  
On books he'll feast, the poet's words of fire,  
Heroic tales of War and Tully's patriot ire,  
Such be thy studies; then, whate'er the theme,  
Pour forth thine eloquence in copious stream."

\[VI <span id="VI"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl006.md) \] Listening
attentively to the speaker, I never noticed that Ascyltos had given me
the slip; and I was still walking up and down in the gardens full of the
burning words I had heard, when a great mob of students rushed into the
Portico. Apparently these had just come from hearing an impromptu
lecture of some critic or other who had been cutting up Agamemnon's
speech. So whilst the lads were making fun of his sentiments and abusing
the arrangement of the whole discourse, I seized the opportunity to
escape, and started off at a run in pursuit of Ascyltos. But I was
heedless about the road I followed, and indeed felt by no means sure of
the situation of our inn, the result being that whichever direction I
took, I presently found myself back again at my starting point. At last,
exhausted with running and dripping with sweat, I came across a little
old woman, who was selling herbs.

\[VII <span id="VII"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl007.md) \] "Prithee,
good mother," say I, "can you tell me where I live?" Charmed with the
quiet absurdity of my question, "Why certainly!" she replied; and
getting up, went on before me. I thought she must be a witch; but
presently, when we had arrived at a rather shy neighborhood, the
obliging old lady drew back the curtain of a doorway, and said, "Here is
where you ought to live."

I was just protesting I did not know the house, when I catch sight of
mysterious figures prowling between rows of name-boards, and naked
harlots. Then when too late, I saw I had been brought into a house of
ill fame. So cursing the old woman's falseness, I threw my robe over my
head and made a dash right through the brothel to the opposite door,
when lo! just on the threshold, whom should I meet but Ascyltos, fagged
out and half dead like myself? You would have thought the very same old
hag had been his conductress. I made him a mocking bow, and asked him
what he was doing in such a disreputable place?

\[VIII <span id="VIII"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl008.md) \] Wiping
the sweat from his face with both hands, he replied, "If you only knew
what happened to me!"

"Why! what has happened?" said I.

Then in a faint voice he went on, "I was wandering all over the town,
without being able to discover where I had left our inn, when a
respectable looking man accosted me, and most politely offered to show
me the way. Then after traversing some very dark and intricate alleys,
he brought me where we are, and producing his affair, began begging me
to grant him my favors. In two twos the woman had taken the fee for the
room, and the man laid hold of me; and if I had not proved the stronger,
I should have fared very ill indeed."

While Ascyltos was thus recounting his adventures, up came his
respectable friend again, accompanied by a woman of considerable
personal attractions, and addressing himself to Ascyltos, besought him
to enter, assuring him he had nothing to fear, and that as he would not
consent to play the passive, he should do the active part. The woman on
her side was very anxious I should go with her. Accordingly we followed
the pair, who led us among the name-boards, where we saw in the chambers
persons of both sexes behaving in such fashion I concluded they must
every one have been drinking satyrion. On seeing us, they endeavored to
allure us to sodomy with enticing gestures; and suddenly one fellow with
his clothes well tucked up assails Ascyltos, and throwing him down on a
bed, tries to get to work a-top of him. I spring to the sufferer's
rescue, and uniting our efforts, we make short work of the ruffian.
Ascyltos bolts out of the house, and away, leaving me to escape their
beastly advances as best I might; but discovering I was too strong for
them and in no mood for trifling, they left me alone.

\[IX <span id="IX"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl009.md) \] After
running about almost over the city, I caught sight of Giton, as it were
a fog, standing at the corner of an alley close to the door of our inn,
and hurried to join him. I asked my favorite whether he had got anything
ready for our dinner, whereupon the lad sat down on the bed and began
wiping away the tears with his thumb. Much disturbed at my favorite's
distress, I demanded what had happened. For a long time I could not drag
a word out of him, not indeed till I had added threats to prayers. Then
he reluctantly told me. "That favorite or comrade of yours came into our
lodging just now, and set to work to force me. When I screamed he drew a
sword and said, 'If you're a Lucretia, you've found a Tarquin'."

Hearing this, I exclaimed, shaking my two fists in Ascyltos' face. "What
have you to say now, you pathic prostitute, you, whose very breath is
abominable?" Ascyltos feigned extreme indignation, and immediately
repeated my gesture with greater emphasis, crying in still louder tones,
"Will you hold your tongue, you filthy gladiator, who after murdering
your host, had luck enough to escape from the criminals' cage at the
Amphitheater? Will you hold your tongue, you midnight cut-throat, who
never, when at your bravest, durst face an honest woman? Didn't I serve
you for a minion in an orchard, just as this lad does now in an inn?"

"Did you or did you not," I interrupted, "sneak off from the master's
lecture?"

\[X <span id="X"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl010.md) \] "What was I to
do, fool, when I was dying of hunger? Stop and listen to a string of
phrases no better than the tinkling of broken glass or the nonsensical
interpretations in dream books? By great Hercules, you are dead baser
than I; to compass a dinner you have condescended to flatter a Poet!"
This ended our unseemly wrangle, and we both burst into a fit of
laughter, and proceeded to discuss other matters in a more peaceable
tone.

But the recollection of his late violence coming over me afresh,
"Ascyltos," I said, "I see we cannot get on together; so let us divide
between us our bits of common funds, and each try to make head against
poverty on his own bottom. You are a scholar; so am I. I don't wish to
spoil your profits, so I'll take up another line. Else shall we find a
thousand causes of quarrel every day, and soon make ourselves the talk
of the town."

Ascyltos raised no objection, merely saying, "For today, as we have
accepted, in our quality of men of letters, an invitation to dine out,
don't let us lose our evening; but tomorrow, since you wish it, I will
look out for a new lodging and another bedfellow."

"Poor work," said I, "putting off the execution of a good plan." It was
really my naughty passions that urged me to so speedy a parting; indeed
I had been long wishing to be rid of his jealous observation, in order
to renew my old relations with my sweet Giton. Ascyltos, mortally
offended at my remark, rushed out of the room without another word. So
sudden a departure boded ill; for I knew his ungovernable temper and the
strength of his passions. So I went after him, to keep an eye on his
doings and guard against their consequences; but he slipped adroitly out
of my sight, and I wasted a long time in a fruitless search for the
rascal.

\[XI <span id="XI"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl011.md) \] After
looking through the whole city, I came back to my little room, and now
at length claiming my full tale of kisses, I clip my darling lad in the
tightest of embraces; my utmost hopes of bliss are fulfilled to the envy
of all mankind. The rites were not yet complete, when Ascyltos crept up
stealthily to the door, and violently bursting in the bolts, caught me
at play with his favorite. His laughter and applause filled the room,
and tearing off the mantle that covered us, "Why! what are you after,"
he cries, "my sainted friend? What! both tucked cozily under one
coverlet?" Nor did he stop at words, but detaching the strap from his
wallet, he fell to thrashing me with no perfunctory hand, seasoning his
blows with insulting remarks. "This is the way you divide stock with a
comrade, is it? Not so fast, my friend." So unexpected was the attack I
was obliged to put up with the blows in silence.

Accordingly I took the matter as a joke, and it was well I did so;
otherwise I should have had to fight my rival. My counterfeited
merriment calmed his anger, and he even smiled faintly. "Look you,
Encolpius," said he, "are you so buried in your pleasures, you never
reflect that our money is exhausted, and the trifles we have left are
valueless. Town is good for nothing in the summer days; there'll be
better luck in the country. Let's go visit our friends."
