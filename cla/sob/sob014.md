### IMPATIENCE

I threw myself weeping into her arms, and for long minutes she felt my
warm tears flowing over her shoulder before my anguish allowed me once
again to speak:

"Alas! I am only a child; the young men will not look at me. When shall
I have lovely young breasts like yours, to swell my gown and tempt their
kisses?

"No one glances with avid eyes when my tunic slips; no one picks up the
flower that falls from out my hair; no one tells me that he'll kill me
if my lips should know another's."

Tenderly she answered me: "Bilitis, little maid, you cry like a cat in
the moonlight and are worried without reason. The most impatient virgins
are not those the soonest chosen."
