### COUNSELS

Then Syllikmas entered, and, seeing that we were so intimate, sat down
upon the bench. Taking Glottis on one knee and Kyse on the other, she
began:

"Come here, my dear." But I remained away. Then she went on: "Are you
afraid of us? Come closer: these children truly love you. They can teach
you things you do not know about: the honey-like caresses of a girl.

"Man is violent and lazy. You doubtless know him well. Then hate him. He
has a flattened breast, rough skin, short hair and shaggy arms. But
women are entirely beautiful.

"And only women know the art of love; stay with us, Bilitis, do stay.
And if you have a truly ardent spirit, you'll see your beauty as within
a glass upon the bodies of your mistresses."
