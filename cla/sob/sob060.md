### THE NAMELESS TOMB

Mnasidika then took me by the hand, and led me through the portals of
the town to a little barren field where a marble shaft was standing. She
said to me: "This was my mother's mistress."

I felt a sudden tremor, and, clinging to her hand, leaned on her
shoulder, to read the four verses between the serpent and the broken
bowl:

"Death did not carry me away, but the Nymphs of the river. I rest here
beneath the light earth with the shorn ringlets of my Xantho. Let her
alone weep for me. I shall not say my name."

We stood there long and did not pour libation. How can one call upon an
unknown soul from out the rushing hordes of souls in Hades?
