### TO THE WOODEN GOD

Oh, Venerable Priapos! wooden god that I had fastened in the marble
border of my bath, it is not wrongly, guardian of the orchards, that you
keep watch here o'er the courtesans.

God, we did not buy you to sacrifice to you our maidenhood. Naught can
return that which no longer is, and the zealots of Pallas do not run the
streets of Amathus.

No. Formerly you watched over the tresses of the trees, the blooms
well-watered, the heavy, tasteful fruits. That is why we have chosen
you.

Preserve today our blond heads, the open poppies of our lips and the
violets of our eyes. Preserve the solid fruits of our breasts and give
us lovers who resemble you. [141](sob154.htm#xref_141.md)
