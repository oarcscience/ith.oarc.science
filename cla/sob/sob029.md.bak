### PRAYER TO PERSEPHONE

Cleansed by the ritual ablutions and clothed in violet robes, we droop
our olive branches to the earth.

"Oh, underworld Persephone, whatever be the name that thou desirest, if
this name pleases thee, oh, hear our prayer, Crowned with Shadows,
barren smile-less Queen!

"Koklis, daughter of Thrasymakos, is lying at thy door. Pray do not call
her yet; thou knowest she cannot fly from thee for ever; but take her
later, call some other day.

"Oh, bear her not away so soon, Invisible Mistress! For she bewails her
virginity, she supplicates thee through our prayers; to save her we will
give our three black sheep, unshorn."
