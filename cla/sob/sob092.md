### LAST ATTEMPT

What do you want, old girl? --To console you. --'Tis wasted effort. --I
have been told that since your quarrel, you've gone from love to love,
but have never found forgetfulness or peace. I come to suggest some one
to you.

--Speak. --She is a young slave born in Sardis. She has not her equal in
the world, for she is both man and woman, although her breast and long
hair and clear voice are most deceptive.

--Her age? --Sixteen. --Her height? --Tall. She has known no one here
excepting Psappha, who is madly in love with her and wished to buy her
from me for twenty minae. If you should hire her, then she is yours.
--What shall I do about it?

For twenty-two nights I've tried in vain to flee from memory. . . So be
it; I'll take this one more, but warn the dear that she should not be
frightened if I sob within her arms.
