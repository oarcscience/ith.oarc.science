### LITTLE PHANION

Stranger, stop, look who is signalling you: 'tis little Phanion of Kôs,
she is well worth your choice.

See, her hair is curled like parsley, her skin is soft as the down of a
woodland bird. She is small and brown. And she converses well.

If you should follow her, she would not ask you all your voyage-money;
no, just a drachma or a pair of sandals.

You'll find she has a good bed in her house, fresh figs and milk and
wine, and if it should be cold there'll be a fire.
