### DESIRE

She entered, and passionately, with half-closed eyes, she joined her
lips with mine, and our tongues knew each other. . . Never in my life
had there been a kiss like that.

She stood against me, amorous and willing. Little by little my knee rose
between her warm thighs, which spread as though receptive to a lover.

My wandering hand upon her gown sought her secret body, which
alternately swayed in undulation, or arching, stiffened with tremblings
of the skin.

With maddened eyes she looked upon the bed; but we had no right to love
before the wedding, and we separated hastily at last.
