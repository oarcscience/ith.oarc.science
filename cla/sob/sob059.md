### METAMORPHOSIS

I formerly was amorous of the beauty of young men, and the memory of
their words, one time, would keep me long awake.

I remember having carved a name in the bark of a sycamore. I remember
having left a fragment of my gown upon the road where one was wont to
pass.

I remember having loved. . . Oh! Pannychis, my child, in what hands have
I left you? How could I, unhappy one, have thus abandoned you?

Today Mnasidika alone possesses me, and will forever have me. Let her
receive as sacrifice the happiness of those whom I have left for her.
