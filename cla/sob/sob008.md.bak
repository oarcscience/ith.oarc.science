### THE OLD MAN AND THE NYMPHS

An old blind man lives on the mountain. For having looked at the nymphs
his eyes have long been dead. And from that time his happiness has been
a far-off memory.

"Yes, I saw them," he told me: "Helopsychria, Limnanthis; they were
standing near the bank, in the green pool of Physos. The water shimmered
higher than their knees.

"Their necks were bent beneath their heavy hair. Their nails were filmy,
like the wings of grasshoppers. Their breasts were deep, like the calyx
of the hyacinth.

"They trailed their fingers upon the water, and pulled long-stemmed
lilies from the unseen silt. About their separated thighs, slow circles
spread. . ."
