### MNASIDIKA'S SILENCE

All day she laughed and even mocked at me a little. She refused to obey
me, in the presence of some strangers.

When we had come home again I affected not to speak to her, and when she
threw her arms about my neck, saying: "Are you angry?" I said to her:

"Ah! you are no longer as you used to be, you are no longer like the
first day. I do not recognize you any more, Mnasidika." She did not
answer me.

But she put on all her jewels, the jewels that she had not worn for
long, and even the blue-embroidered yellow robe she had not worn since
the day of our first meeting.
