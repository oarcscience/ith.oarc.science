### SONG

"The night is so deep that it creeps between my eyelids. --You will
never find the path. You'll be lost within the wood.

--The noise of falling waters fills my ears. --You would not hear the
murmurs of your lover though he should be but twenty steps away.

--The odor of the flowers is so strong that I shall faint and fall upon
the path. --You would not feel him should he cross your road.

--Ah! though he is so far from here, across the very mountain, I see him
and I hear him and I feel him touching me."
