<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SEA OF KYPRIS</H3>
<P>I had crouched on the edge of the highest promontory. The sea was black as a field of violets. And the Milky Way was gushing from the great supernal breast.</P>
<P>About me a thousand Maenads slept in the torn-up flowers. Long grasses mingled with their flowing hair. And now the sun was born from the eastern waters.</P>
<P>These the same waves and these the self-same shores that saw one day the white body of Aphrodite rising. . . I suddenly hid my eyes in my hands.</P>
<P>For I had seen the water trembling with a thousand little lips of light: the pure sex, or it may have been the smile of Kypris Philomme&iuml;des.&nbsp;<A HREF="sob154.htm#xref_121"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A></P>
