### THE LIVING PAST

I left the bed as she had left it, unmade and rumpled, coverlets awry,
so that her body's print might rest still warm beside my own.

Until the next day I did not go to bathe, I wore no clothes and did not
dress my hair, for fear I might erase some sweet caress.

That morning I did not eat, nor yet at dusk, and put no rouge nor powder
on my lips, so that her kiss might cling a little longer.

I left the shutters closed, and did not open the door, for fear the
memory of the might before might vanish with the wind.
