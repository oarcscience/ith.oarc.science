### THE TORN DRESS

Ho! by the two goddesses, who is the brute who put his foot upon my
dress? --One who loves you. --He's a blockhead. --I was clumsy, pardon
me.

The idiot! my yellow dress is all torn up the back, and if I walk the
streets like this they'll take me for a wretched girl who serves
inverted Venus.

--Won't you stop? --I think he still is speaking to me! --Are you going
to leave me when you are so angry? . . . you will not answer? Alas! I
dare not say another word.

--I surely must go home to change my dress. --And mayn't I come with
you? --Who is your father? --He's the rich ship--owner, Nikias. --You
have lovely eyes, I pardon you.
