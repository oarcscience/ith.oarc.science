### LAST EPITAPH

Beneath the black leaves of the laurel, 'neath the amorous blooms of the
rose, 'tis here I am resting forever; I who could weave verses together,
I who could make kisses to bloom.

I grew up in the land of the Nymphs; I lived on the island of lovers; I
died on the island of Kypris. That is why my name is distinguished, and
my monument polished with oil.

Do not weep for me, you who have paused here: my funeral arrangements
were sweet; the mourners scratched their cheeks; my mirrors and
necklaces rest in my tomb.

And now, on the pale prairies of asphodel, an impalpable shadow, I walk,
and the memories of my earthly existence are the joys of my underworld
life.
