### ABSENCE

She has gone out, and she is far away, but I see her still, for all
within this room is full of her, all is hers, and I just like the rest.

This bed, still warm, where my mouth is wandering now, is rumpled to the
pattern of her body. In this soft pillow her little ringleted head has
softly slept.

This is the basin where she oft has washed; this comb has smoothed the
knots of her tangled hair. These slippers have held her little naked
feet. This gauze bandeau restrained her swelling breasts.

But I dare not touch, even with my finger, this mirror in which she sees
her burning bruises, and in which, perhaps, the image of her sweet moist
lips is still reflected.
