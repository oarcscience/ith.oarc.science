### THE MOON WITH BLUE EYES

At night the hair of women and the willow's branches merge and mingle
softly with each other. I walked upon the water's edge. Suddenly I heard
a singing voice: 'twas then I knew there were some maidens there.

I said to them: "What do you sing?" They answered me: "We sing of those
returning." One waited for her father, one her brother; but she who
waited for her lover was the most uneasy.

They had plaited crowns and garlands for themselves, cut palms from the
palm-trees and dragged the lotos from the pond. They had their arms
about each other's necks, and sang alternately.

I wandered on along the river's edge, sadly and alone, but, looking all
about me, I perceived the blue-eyed moon had risen behind the trees, to
see me home.
