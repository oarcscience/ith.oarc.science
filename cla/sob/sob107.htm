<P>Ho! by the two goddesses, who is the brute who put his foot upon my dress? --One who loves you. --He's a blockhead. --I was clumsy, pardon me.</P>
<P>The idiot! my yellow dress is all torn up the back, and if I walk the streets like this they'll take me for a wretched girl who serves inverted Venus.</P>
<P>--Won't you stop? --I think he still is speaking to me! --Are you going to leave me when you are so angry? . . . you will not answer? Alas! I dare not say another word.</P>
<P>--I surely must go home to change my dress. --And mayn't I come with you? --Who is your father? --He's the rich ship--owner, Nikias. --You have lovely eyes, I pardon you.</P>
