### PEDESTRIAN

One evening, as I sat before my door, a young man passed me by. He
looked at me, I turned away. He spoke to me, I did not answer him.

He would have come nearer. I took a scythe that leaned against the wall
and should have split his cheek had he advanced one pace.

Then, stepping back a little, he began to smile, and blew across his
hand, saying: "A kiss for you." I screamed and wept. My mother ran to
me,

Anxiously, thinking I had been stung by a scorpion. I cried, "He kissed
me." My mother kissed me too, and bore me off in her arms.
