### RAIN

Softly and in silence the fine rain has moistened everything. It is
still raining a little. I am going to stroll under the trees.
Bare-footed, not to soil my sandals.

The spring rains are delicious. Branches laden with rain-soaked blossoms
daze me with their perfume. The delicate skin of the bark shines in the
sun.

Alas! how many blooms have fallen to earth. Pity the fallen flowers.
Pray do not sweep them up, or crush them in the mud: but leave them to
the bees.

Beetles and snails promenade in the pathways between the pools of water;
I do not wish to tread upon them, nor frighten this gilded lizard which
stretches and blinks its eyes.
