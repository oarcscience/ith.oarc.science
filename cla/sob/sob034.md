### THE GOBLET

Lykas saw me coming, clad only in a short and filmy shift, so torrid was
the day; he wished to mould my breast, which was uncovered.

He took a handful of the finest clay, kneaded it in water, fresh and
light. When he spread it gently on my skin, it was so cold I thought
that I should faint.

Modeled from my breast he made a cup, rounded gently and umbilicate. He
placed it in the burning sun to bake, and painted it with gold and
purple paints, impressing flowers all about the rim.

Then we visited the spring which is sacred to the nymphs, and threw the
goblet in the stream and strewed upon it gilly-flower stems.
