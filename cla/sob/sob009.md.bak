### SONG

Torti-tortue, what are you doing there? --I am winding wool and I spin
Milesian thread. --Alas! alas! Why don't you come and dance? --I am so
sad. I am so sad.

Torti-tortue, what are you doing there? --I cut a reed to make a funeral
pipe. --Alas! alas! And tell me what has happened. --I'll never tell.
Oh, I shall never tell.

Torti-tortue, what are you doing there? --I am crushing olives to make a
funeral oil. --Alas! alas! And who has died, mayhap? --How can you ask?
Oh, say, how can you ask?

Torti-tortue, what are you doing there? --He fell into the sea. . .
--Alas! alas! and tell me how was that? --From his white horses' backs.
From his white horses' backs. [27](sob154.htm#xref_27.md)
