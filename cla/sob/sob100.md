### THE SEA OF KYPRIS

I had crouched on the edge of the highest promontory. The sea was black
as a field of violets. And the Milky Way was gushing from the great
supernal breast.

About me a thousand Maenads slept in the torn-up flowers. Long grasses
mingled with their flowing hair. And now the sun was born from the
eastern waters.

These the same waves and these the self-same shores that saw one day the
white body of Aphrodite rising. . . I suddenly hid my eyes in my hands.

For I had seen the water trembling with a thousand little lips of light:
the pure sex, or it may have been the smile of Kypris
Philommeïdes. [121](sob154.htm#xref_121.md)
