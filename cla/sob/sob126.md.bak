### THE MASQUE OF PASIPHAË [149](sob154.htm#xref_149.md)

At a debauch given by two young men and some courtesans, at my home,
where love flowed out like wine, Damalis, to celebrate her name, danced
the Masque of Pasiphaë.

She had had two masks, a cow and a bull, made at Kition, one for
herself, and one for Karmantides. She wore two terrible horns, and on
her croup a long and hairy tail.

The other women, led by me, and holding flowers and torches, turned to
each other's arms with anguished cries, and we caressed Damalis with our
trailing hair.

Her sighs, our songs and the dancing of our loins lasted even longer
than the night. The empty room is still damp and warm. I look at my
reddened knees and the Kios wine-cups with roses swimming in them.
