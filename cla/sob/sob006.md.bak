### MATERNAL COUNSEL

My mother bathes me in the dark, she dresses me in the sunlight and
coifs me in the soft glow of the lamp; but if I go out in the moonlight
she ties my girdle and makes a double knot.

She tells me: "Play with the virgins, dance with the little children; do
not look out of the window; fly the conversation of young men and fear
the widow's counsel.

"Some evening, someone, as has always been, will come to lead you over
the threshold in the midst of a great cortège of sounding drums and
amorous flutes.

"That evening, when you go out, Bilitis, you will leave me three gourds
of gall: one for the morning, one for the afternoon, and the third, the
bitterest, for the festival days."
