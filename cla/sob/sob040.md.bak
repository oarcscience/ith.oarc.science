### BILITIS

One woman drapes herself in snowy wool. Another clothes herself in silk
and gold. And still another hangs herself with flowers, green leaves and
purple grapes.

As for myself, I must live forever nude. My lover, come and take me as I
am; without a dress or jewels or little boots, behold me! Bilitis
herself and nothing more.

My hair is black from its blackness, and my lips arc red from their red.
My ringlets float about me free and loose and round as feathers.

Take me as my mother made me in a distant night of love, and if I please
you in that fashion, please do not forget to tell me so.
