<P>Alas, for me! for I have lost his letter. I had placed it 'twixt my skin and my strophion,&nbsp;<A HREF="sob154.htm#xref_61"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> beneath the shielding warmth of my breast. I ran, it must have fallen out.</P>
<P>I shall return upon my homeward path; should someone find it he would tell my mother, and I'd be whipped before my mocking sisters.</P>
<P>If a man has found it he will give it to me; or even if he cares to speak to me in secret, I know the way to ravish him of it.</P>
<P>But should a woman once have gazed upon it, oh, Guardian Zeus protect me! for I know she'd tell the tale to everyone, or else I'm sure she'd steal my lover from me.</P>
