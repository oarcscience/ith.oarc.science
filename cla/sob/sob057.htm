<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE WEDDING</H3>
<P>The wedding feast was given in the morning, in Acalanthis' house whom she had taken for a mother. Mnasidika wore a milk-white veil, and I the virile tunic.</P>
<P>Then after, in the midst of twenty women she donned her festal robes. Perfumed with bakkaris and spread with gold-dust, her cool and rippling skin attracted furtive hands.</P>
<P>In her leafy chamber she awaited me, as a bridegroom. And I led her out in a little two-wheeled cart, seated between me and the nymphagogue.&nbsp;<A HREF="sob154.htm#xref_76"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A> One of her little breasts burned in my hand.</P>
<P>They sang the nuptial song: the flutes sang madly. And carrying Mnasidika, my arms beneath her knees and round her shoulders, I passed the threshold, strewn with blushing roses.</P>
