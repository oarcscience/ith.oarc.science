### BARE FEET

I have long black hair down my back, and a little round cap. My frock is
of white wool. My sturdy legs are browning in the sun.

If I lived in town I should have golden trinkets and gold-embroidered
frocks and silver slippers. . . I look at my naked feet in their
slippers of dust.

Psophis! come here, little creature! carry me to the brook, bathe my
feet in your hands, and press some olives with some violets, to scent
them among the flowers.

Today you shall be my slave; you shall follow me and serve me, and at
the end of the day I will give you some lentils from my own garden . . .
to give your mother.
