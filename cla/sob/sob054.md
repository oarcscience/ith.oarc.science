### MEETING

I found her as a treasure, in a field, under a myrtle bush; she was
wrapped from throat to feet in a yellow peplos broidered fine with blue.

"I have no lover," she told me, "for the nearest town is forty
stadia [73](sob154.htm#xref_73.md) from here. I live alone but for my
mother, who is a widow and is always sad. If you should wish me I would
follow you.

"I'll follow to your house, though it should be upon the other sea-coast
of the isle; and I'll live with you until you send me hence. Your hand
is tender and your eyes are blue.

"Let us go. I'll carry nothing with me but the little nude Astarte which
is hanging from my necklace. We'll place it close to yours, and reward
them with red roses every night."
