<P>She sleeps in her undone hair, her hands entwined behind her neck. But does she dream? Her lips are parted and her breath is gentle.</P>
<P>With a little dab of down I dry, without awakening her, the perspiration from her arms, the fever from her cheeks. Her closed eyelids are two purple flowers.</P>
<P>I shall arise quietly; I'll go draw water, milk the cow, and beg some fire from our neighbors. I want to be coiffed and dressed completely when she opens her eyes.</P>
<P>Sleep, remain awhile between her lovely curving lashes, and spin out the happy night with a dream of happy omen.</P>
