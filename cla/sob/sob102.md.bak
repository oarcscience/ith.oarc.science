### THE MYSTERIES [124](sob154.htm#xref_124.md)

In the thrice mysterious hall where men have never entered, we have
fêted you, Astarte of the Night. Mother of the World, Well-Spring of the
life of all the Gods!

I shall reveal a portion of the rite, but no more of it than is
permissible. About a crowned Phallos, a hundred-twenty women swayed and
cried. The initiates were dressed as men, the others in the split tunic.

The fumes of perfumes and the smoke of torches floated fog-like in and
out among us all. I wept my scorching tears. All, at the feet of
Berbeia, we threw ourselves, extended on our backs.

Then, when the Religious Act was consummated, and when into the Holy
Triangle the purpled phallos had been plunged anew, the mysteries began;
but I shall say no more.
