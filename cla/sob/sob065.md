### TENDERNESS

Softly clasp your arms, like a girdle, about me. Touch, oh, touch my
skin like that again! Neither water nor the noon-time breeze is gentle
as your hand.

Today you shall fondle me, little sister; 'tis your turn. Remember the
caresses that I taught you last night, and kneel beside me who am tired,
and do not say a word.

Your lips sink from my lips. And all your unbound ringlets follow them,
as the caress follows fast upon the kiss. They fall upon my left breast;
they hide your eyes from me.

Give me your hand, it is so warm! Press mine and do not leave it. Hands
join with hands more easily than mouth with mouth, and nothing can
compare with their passion.
