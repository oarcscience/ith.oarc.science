### THE LOST LETTER

Alas, for me! for I have lost his letter. I had placed it 'twixt my skin
and my strophion, [61](sob154.htm#xref_61.md) beneath the shielding warmth
of my breast. I ran, it must have fallen out.

I shall return upon my homeward path; should someone find it he would
tell my mother, and I'd be whipped before my mocking sisters.

If a man has found it he will give it to me; or even if he cares to
speak to me in secret, I know the way to ravish him of it.

But should a woman once have gazed upon it, oh, Guardian Zeus protect
me! for I know she'd tell the tale to everyone, or else I'm sure she'd
steal my lover from me.
