### STORIES

I am beloved by little children; when they see me come they run to me
and tug upon my tunic, and grasp my legs about with tiny arms.

If they have gathered flowers, all are mine; if they have caught a
beetle, they place it in my hand; if they have nothing, they fondle me
and make me sit before them.

Then they kiss me on the cheek, they rest their little heads upon my
breasts; they supplicate me with their shining eyes. How well I know
just what they mean to say!

They mean: "Bilitis sweet, tell us again, for we are good, the story of
the hero Perseus, or else how little Helle met her
death." [39](sob154.htm#xref_39)
