### THE LITTLE CLAY ASTARTE

The little guardian Astarte which protects Mnasidika, was modeled at
Camiros by a very clever potter. She is as large as your thumb, of
fine-ground yellow clay.

Her tresses fall and circle about her narrow shoulders. Her eyes are cut
quite widely and her mouth is very small. For she is the All-Beautiful.

Her right hand indicates her delta, which is peppered with tiny holes
about her lower belly and along her groins. For she is the All-Lovable.

Her left hand supports her round and heavy breasts. Between her
spreading hips swings a large and fertile belly. For she is the
Mother-of-All.
