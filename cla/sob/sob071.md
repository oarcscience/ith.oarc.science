### THE MAD EMBRACE

Love me, not with smiles and flutes or plaited flowers, but with your
heart and tears, as I adore you with my bosom and my sobs.

When your breasts alternate with mine, when I feel your very life
touching my own, when your knees rise up behind me, my panting mouth no
longer even knows the way to yours.

Clasp me as I clasp you! See, the lamp has just gone out, we toss about
in the night; but I press your moving body and I hear your ceaseless
plaint. . .

Moan! moan! moan! oh, woman! Eros drags us now in heavy pain. You'll
suffer less upon this bed in bringing forth a child than you'll agonize
in bringing forth your love.
