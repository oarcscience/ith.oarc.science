### SONG

The first one gave me a necklace, a necklace of pearls worth a city,
with temples and palaces, treasures and slaves.

The second wrote poetry for me. He said that my tresses were black as
the night's, and my eyes were as blue as the day's.

The third one was handsome; so handsome, that his mother would blush
when she kissed him. He put his hands on my knees, and his lips he would
press to my feet.

You, you have said nothing to me. You have given me naught, being poor.
And you are not overly handsome, but you are the one that I love.
