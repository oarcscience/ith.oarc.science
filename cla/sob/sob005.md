### PASTORAL SONG

One must sing a pastoral song to invoke Pan, God of the summer wind. I
watch my flock, and Selenis watches hers, in the round shade of a
shuddering olive-tree.

Selenis is lying on the meadow. She rises and runs, or hunts
grasshoppers, picks flowers and grasses, or bathes her face in the
brooklet's cooling stream.

I pluck the wool from the bright backs of my sheep to supply my distaff,
and I spin. The hours are slow. An eagle sails the sky.

The shadow moves; let us move the basket of flowers and the crock of
milk. One must sing a pastoral song to invoke Pan, god of the summer
wind.
