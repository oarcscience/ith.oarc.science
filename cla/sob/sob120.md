### THE FLUTE PLAYER

Melixo, with tight-locked legs and body bent, your arms before you, you
slip your light and double flute between your wine-wet lips and play
above the couch where Teleas still embraces me.

Am I not unwise, I who hire so young a girl to lighten my laborious
hours; am I not unkind, I who thus display her nude to my lovers' prying
eyes?

No, Melixo, little musician, you are a stalwart friend. Yesterday you
did not hesitate to change your flute when I despaired of accomplishing
a trying love-affair. But you are safe.

For well I know what you are thinking of. You wait the end of this
excessive night, which exasperates you cruelly and in vain, and at the
ghost of dawn you'll run the streets with your only friend Psyllos, to
your little hollowed couch.
