First published in Paris in 1894, this purports to be translations of
poems by a woman named Bilitis, a contemporary and acquaintance of
Sappho. This caused a sensation, not only because finding an intact
cache of poems from a completely unknown Greek poet *circa* 600 B.C.
would be a miracle, but because of its open and sensitive exploration of
lesbian eroticism. Actually Bilitis never existed. The poems were a
clever forgery by Pierre Louÿs--the "translator"; to lend weight, he had
even included a bibliography with bogus supporting works. Louÿs actually
did have a good command of the classics, and he salted *Bilitis* with a
number of quotations from real poets, including Sappho, to make it even
more convincing.

Just because this is a fake does not detract from its literary value.
And just because it was written by a man did not prevent it from
acquiring cultural significance for Lesbians. In fact, one of the
earliest organizations of Lesbians in the United States was called the
Daughters of Bilitis (although this could have been because it was a
reference that would elude most people).

Prior to the 1960s, in the US, English translations of *Bilitis* were
considered risqué enough to warrant lavish privately printed limited
editions. This was a dodge to circumvent now-defunct censorship laws.
The version this particular etext is based on was printed in 1926, and
has sensual and very witty Art Deco illustrations by Wily Pogany.

Sappho](../sappho/saphintr.md).
