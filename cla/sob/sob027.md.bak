### OFFERING TO THE GODDESS

This garland plaited by my very hands is not for Artemis who rules at
Perga--though Artemis will shield me from the labour-pangs.

Nor for Sidonian Athene, although she be of ivory and gold, and bears in
her hand a pomegranate to tempt the birds.

No, but for Aphrodite whom I love within my breast, for she alone can
sate my hungry lips if I suspend upon her sacred tree my loops of tender
rosebuds.

But never will I say my need aloud. I'll stand on tiptoe, whispering my
wish in secret to a crevice in the bark.
