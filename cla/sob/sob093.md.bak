### RENDING MEMORY

I remember . . . (at what hour of the day is she not before my eyes!). I
remember the way She had of lifting her hair with pale and dainty
fingers.

I remember a night she passed, cheek against my breast, so sweetly that
happiness kept me long awake; and the next day she had the imprint of
the nipple on her face.

I see her holding her cup of milk, and looking at me sidewise with a
smile. I see her, powdered and with her hair new-dressed, opening her
great eyes before her mirror and touching up the rouge upon her lips.

And above all, if my despair is everlasting torture, it is because I
know, minute by minute, how she trembles in the other's arms, and what
she asks of her and what she gives, herself.
