### THE KISS

I shall kiss from end to end the long black wings spreading from your
neck, oh, gentle bird, captive dove whose heart throbs wild beneath my
hand!

I shall take your mouth into my mouth as the child takes its mother's
breast. Tremble! for the kiss sinks deep and should suffice for love.

I shall trail my light tongue along your arms and round your neck, and I
shall drag the long drawn kiss of my nails along your tender sides.

Hear roaring in your ear all the murmur of the sea. . . Mnasidika! the
expression of your eyes makes me ill. I'll clasp within my kiss your
lids which burn as warmly as your lips.
