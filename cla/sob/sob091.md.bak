### TO GYRINNO

Do not think that I have loved you. I have eaten you like a ripe fig,
and drunk you like a draught of burning water, and worn you about me
like a girdle of flesh.

I have amused myself with you, because you have short hair and pointed
breasts upon your slender body, and nipples black as little dates.

As one must have fruits and water, a woman also sates a living thirst;
but already I no longer know your name, you who have lain within my arms
like the shade of another loved one.

Between your flesh and mine a burning dream has claimed me for its own.
I pressed you on me as upon a wound, and cried: "Mnasidika! Mnasidika!
Mnasidika!"
