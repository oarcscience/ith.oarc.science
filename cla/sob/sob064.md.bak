### THE DOLL

I have given her a doll, a waxen doll with rosy cheeks. Its arms are
attached by little pins, and even its little legs can bend.

When we are together she places it between us in the bed; it is our
child. At eventide she rocks it and gives it the breast before putting
it to sleep.

She has woven it three little tunics, and on the Aphrodisian days we
give it little jewels, jewels and also flowers.

She is careful of its virtue, and will not let it out alone; especially
in the sun, for the little doll would melt and drip away in drops of
wax.
