<P>One evening, as I sat before my door, a young man passed me by. He looked at me, I turned away. He spoke to me, I did not answer him.</P>
<P>He would have come nearer. I took a scythe that leaned against the wall and should have split his cheek had he advanced one pace.</P>
<P>Then, stepping back a little, he began to smile, and blew across his hand, saying: "A kiss for you." I screamed and wept. My mother ran to me,</P>
<P>Anxiously, thinking I had been stung by a scorpion. I cried, "He kissed me." My mother kissed me too, and bore me off in her arms.</P>
