### LITTLE CHILDREN

The brook is nearly dry, the drying rushes perish in the mud; the air is
burning, and far from the steep embankments a thin clear streamlet flows
upon the sand.

There it is from morn to night that little naked children come to play.
They bathe, no higher than their calves, so sunken is the stream.

But they tramp in the current and often slip upon the rocks, and little
boys throw water upon little laughing girls.

And when a company of passing merchants leads down their great white
cattle to the sink, they cross their hands behind them, and watch the
heavy beasts.
