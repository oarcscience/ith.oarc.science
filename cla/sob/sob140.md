### STRANGER

Stranger, go no further in the town. You'll not find younger or more
expert girls at any other place besides my own. I am Sostrata, known
beyond the sea.

See this one whose eyes are green as water on the grass. You do not wish
her? Here are other eyes, black as the violet and hair three cubits
long.

I have some better still. Xantho, open your cyclas. Stranger, her
breasts are firm as quinces, touch them. And her lovely belly, you can
see, bears the three Kyprian folds.

I bought her with her sister, who is not yet quite old enough for love,
but who is her useful helper. By the two goddesses! you are of noble
blood. Phyllis and Xantho, follow the gentleman!
