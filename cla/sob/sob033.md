### TRESSES [52](sob154.htm#xref_52)

He said to me: "Tonight I dreamed a dream.-- Your hair came down and
fell about my throat. Your locks were as a yoke about my neck, a black
fan spreading on my breast.

"And I caressed them; and they were my own; and we were bound together
thus forever, by the same tresses, mouth on mouth, like two twin laurels
with a single root.

"And little by little, it seemed to me, our limbs were so entwined that
I became your body, or you entered into mine like some sweet dream
mingling with my own."

When he had finished he softly placed his hands upon my shoulders, and
looked into my eyes with such a look I lowered them and trembled. . .
