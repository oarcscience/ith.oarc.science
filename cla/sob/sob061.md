### MNASIDIKA'S THREE BEAUTIES

That Mnasidika may be protected by the gods, I sacrificed two doves and
two male hares to laughter-loving Aphrodite.

To Ares [80](sob154.htm#xref_80.md) I have given two armed cocks, and
sinister Hecate has received two dogs who howled beneath the knife.

Nor have I wrongly prayed these three immortals, for Mnasidika bears
upon her face the imprint of their trinal godhead:

Her lips are red as copper, her hair shines blue as steel and her eyes
are black as silver.
