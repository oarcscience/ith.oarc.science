### LOVE

Alas! if I think of her my throat is parched, my head is drooped, my
breasts grow hard and make me ill at case, I tremble and I weep the
while I walk.

If I see her my heart stops, my hands shake, my feet grow cold and fire
mounts in my checks, while my temples pulse sadly on and on.

If I touch her I grow mad, my arms stiffen and my knees grow weak. I
fall before her and curl up like a woman wont to die.

I am hurt by everything she says to me. Her love is like a torture, and
the passers-by can hear my constant plaint. . . Alas! how can I call her
Well-Beloved?
