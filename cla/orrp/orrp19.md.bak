# VI. PERSIA.

BIBLIOGRAPHY: We shall not attempt here to give a bibliography of the
works devoted to Mazdaism. We shall merely refer the reader to that of
Lehmann in Chantepie de la Saussaye, *Lehrbuch der Religionsgeschichte*,
II, p. 150. We should mention, in the first place, Darmesteter, *Le Zend
Avesta*, 1892 ff., with introductions and commentary.--In my *Textes et
monuments relatifs aux mystères de Mithra* (2 vols., 1894-1900), I, pp.
xx ff., I have furnished a list of the earlier works on this subject;
the conclusions of the book have been published separately without the
notes, under the title: *Les Mystères de Mithra*, (2d ed., Paris and
Brussels, 19m; English translation, Chicago, 1903). See also the article
"Mithra" in the *Dictionnaire des antiquités* of Daremberg and Saglio,
1904.--General outlines of certain phases of this religion have been
since given by Grill, *Die persische Mysterienreligion und das
Christentum*, 1903; Roeses, *Ueber Mithrasdienst*, Stralsund, 1905; G.
Wolff, *Ueber Mithrasdienst und Mithreen*, Frankfort, 1909; Reinach, *La
morale du mithraïsme* in *Cultes, mythes*, II, 1906, pp. 220 ff.; Dill,
*op. cit.*, pp. 594-626; cf. also Bigg, *op. cit.* \[p. 321\], 1905, p.
46 ff.; Harnack, *Ausbreitung des Christent.*, II, p. 270. Among the
learned researches which we cannot enumerate here, the most important is
that of Albrecht Dieterich, *Eine Mithrasliturgie*, 1903. He has
endeavored with some ingenuity to show that a mystical passage inserted
in a magic papyrus preserved at Paris is in reality a fragment of a
Mithraic liturgy, but here I share the skepticism of Reitzenstein (*Neue
Jahrb. f. das class. Altertum*, 1904, p. 192) and I have given my
reasons in *Rev. de l'Instr. publ. en Belg.*, XLVII, 1904, pp. 1 ff.
Dieterich answered briefly in *Archiv f. Religionswis.*, VIII, 1905, p.
502, but without convincing me. The author of the passage in question
may have been more or less accurate in giving his god the external
appearance of Mithra, but he certainly did not know the eschatology of
the Persian mysteries. We know, for

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

instance, through positive testimony that they taught the dogma of the
passage of the soul through the seven planetary spheres, and that Mithra
acted as a guide to his votaries in their ascension to the realm of the
blessed. Neither the former nor the latter doctrine, however, is found
in the fantastic uranography of the magician. The name of Mithra, as
elsewhere that of the magi Zoroaster and Hostanes, helped to circulate
an Egyptian forgery., cf. Wendland, *Die hellenistisch-römische Kultur*,
1907, p. 168, n. 1. See on this controversy Wünsch's notes in the 2d ed.
of the *Mithrasliturgie*, 1910, pp. 225 ff.--A considerable number of
new monuments have been published of late years (the mithreum of
Saalburg by Jacobi, etc.). The most important ones are those of the
temple of Sidon preserved in the collection of Clereq (De Ridder,
*Marbres de la collection de C.*, 1906, pp. 52 ff.) and those of
Stockstadt published by Drexel (*Der obergerm. Limes*, XXXIII,
Heidelberg, 1910). In the following notes I shall only mention the works
or texts which could not be utilized in my earlier researches.

pointed out several instances where Augustus borrowed from his distant
predecessors the custom of keeping a journal of the palace, of educating
the children of noble families at court, etc. Certain public
institutions were undoubtedly modeled on them; for instance, the
organization of the mails (Otto Hirschfeld, *Verwaltungsbeamten*, p.
190, n. 2; Rostovtzev, *Klio*, VI, p. 249 (on *angariae*); cf.
Preisigke, Die Ptolemäische Staatspost (*Klio*, VII, p. 241), that of

a communication made to the Congress of Orientalists at Copenhagen
(1909) by Father Lammens, it would appear that the façade of Mschatta is
the work of an Omaiyad kalif of Damascus, and Strzygowski's conclusions
would, therefore, have to be modified considerably; but the influence of
Sassanid art in Syria is nevertheless certain; see Dussaud, *Les Arabes

<span id="xref_6_16">6\_16</span>. In the *Studia Pontica*, p. 368, I
have described a grotto located near Trapezus and formerly dedicated to
Mithra, but now transformed into a church. We know of no other Mithreum.
A bilingual dedication to Mithra, in Greek and Aramaic, is engraved upon
a rock in a wild pass near Farasha (Rhodandos) in Cappadocia. Recently
it has been republished

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

with excellent notes by Henri Grégoire (*Comptes Rendus Acad. des
Inscr.*, 1908, pp. 434 ff.), but the commentator has mentioned no trace
of a temple. The text says that a strategus from Ariaramneia ἐμάγευσε
Μίθρῃ. Perhaps these words must be translated according to a frequent
meaning of the aorist, by "became a magus of Mithra" or "began to serve
Mithra as a magus." This would lead to the conclusion that the
inscription was made on the occasion of an initiation. The magus dignity
was originally hereditary in the sacred caste; strangers could acquire
it after the cult had assumed the form of mysteries. If the
interpretation offered by us is correct the Cappadocian inscription
would furnish interesting evidence of that transformation in the Orient.
Moreover, we know that Tiridates of Armenia initiated Nero; see *Mon.
myst. Mithra*, I, p. 239.

<span id="xref_6_19">6\_19</span>. *Mon. myst. Mithra*, I, p. 10, n. 1.
The argument undoubtedly dates back to Carneades, see Boll, *Studien

<span id="xref_6_20">6\_20</span>. Louis H. Gray (*Archiv für
Religionswiss.*, VII, 1904, p. 345) has shown how these six Amshaspands
passed from being divinities of the material world to the rank of moral
abstractions. From an important text of Plutarch it appears that they
already had this quality in Cappadocia; cf. *Mon. myst. Mithra*, II, p.
33, and Philo, *Quod omn. prob. lib.*, II (II, 456 M).--On Persian gods
worshiped in Cappadocia, see *Mon. myst. Mithra*, I, p. 132.

inscription of Farasha dates back to the first century, before or after
Christ (*loc. cit.*, p. 445).

nascitur* with .... expression ὄμου ὁ σίδηρος τίκτεται, used in
connection with the Chalybians, leads to the same conclusion, see *Revue

Jupiter Dolichnus also possess a remarkable resemblance to those of the
Babylonian god Ramman; cf. Jeremias in Roscher, *Lexikon der Myth.*, s.
v. "Ramman," IV, col. 50 ff.

<span id="xref_6_28">6\_28</span>. *Mon. myst. Mithra*, I, p. 333.--An
inscription discovered in a mithreum at Dorstadt (Sacidava in Dacia,
*CIL*, III, 774 cf. 7729), furnishes, if I rightly understand, another
proof of the relation existing between the Semitic cults and that of the
Persian gods. It speaks of a "de\[orum?\] sacerdos creatus a
Pal\[myr\]enis, do\[mo\] Macedonia, et adven\[tor\] huius templi." This
rather obscure text becomes clear when compared with Apul., *Metam.*,
XI, 26. After the hero had been initiated into the mysteries of Isis in
Greece, he was received at Rome in the great temple of the Campus
Martius, "fani quidem advena, religionis autem indigena." It appears
also that this Macedonian, who was made a priest of their national gods
(Bel, Malakbel, etc.) by a colony of Palmyrenians, was received in Dacia
by the mystics of Mithra as a member of their religion.

<span id="xref_6_29">6\_29</span>. At Venasa in Cappadocia, for
instance, the people, even during the Christian period, celebrated a
panegyric on a mountain, where the celestial Zeus, representing
Baalsamin and Ahura-Mazda, was formerly worshiped (Ramsay, *Church in
the Roman Empire*, 1894, pp. 142, 457). The identification of Bel with
Ahura-Mazda in Cappadocia results from the Aramaic inscription of Jarpuz
(Clermont-Ganneau, *Recueil*, III,

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

\[paragraph continues\] p. 59; Lidzbarski, *Ephemeris für semit.
Epigraphik*, I, pp. 59 ff.). The Zeus Stratios worshiped upon a high
summit near Amasia was in reality Ahura-Mazda, who in turn probably
supplanted some local god (*Studia Pontica*, pp. 173 ff.).Similarly the
equation Anahita = Ishtar = Ma or Cybele for the great female divinity
is accepted everywhere (*Mon. myst. Mithra*, I, p. 333), and Ma takes
the epithet ἀνίκητος like Mithra (*Athen. Mitt.*, XVIII, 1893, p. 415,
and XXIX, 1904, p. 169). A temple of this goddess was called ἱερὸν
Ἀστάρτης in a decree of Anisa (Michel, *Recueil*, No. 536, l. 32).

<span id="xref_6_30">6\_30</span>. The Mithra "mysteries" are not of
Hellenic origin (*Mon. myst. Mithra*, I, p. 239), but their resemblance
to those of Greece, which Gruppe insists upon (*Griech. Mythologie*, pp.
1596 ff.) was such that the two were bound to become confused in the
Alexandrian period.

<span id="xref_6_31">6\_31</span>. Harnack (*Ausbreitung des
Christentums*, II, p. 271) sees in this exclusion of the Hellenic world
a prime cause of the weakness of the Mithra worship in its struggle
against Christianity. The mysteries of Mithra met the Greek culture with
the culture of Persia, superior in some respects. But if it was capable
of attracting the Roman mind by its moral qualities, it was too Asiatic,
on the whole, to be accepted without repugnance by the Occidentals. The
same was true of Manicheism.

<span id="xref_6_32">6\_32</span>. *CIL*, III, 4413; cf. *Mon. myst.
Mithra*, I, p. 281.

<span id="xref_6_33">6\_33</span>. Cf. the bibliography at the head of
the notes for this chapter.

<span id="xref_6_34">6\_34</span>. As Plato grew older he believed that
he could not explain the evils of this world without admitting the
existence of an "evil soul of the world" (Zeller, *Philos. der
Griechen*., 114, p. 973, p. 981, n. 1). But this late conception,
opposed as it is to his entire system, is probably due to the influence
of Oriental dualism. It is found in the Epinomis (Zeller, *ibid.*, p.
1042, n. 4), where the influence of "Chaldean" theories is undeniable;
cf. Bidez, *Revue de Philologie*, XXIX, 1905, p. 319.

<span id="xref_6_35">6\_35</span>. Plutarch, *De Iside*, 46 ff.; cf.
Zeller, *Philos. der Griechen*, V, p. 188; Eisele, *Zur Demonologie des
Plutarch* (*Archiv für Gesch. der Philos.*, XVII), 1903, p. 283 f.--Cf.
*infra*, n.  [6\_40](orrp19.htm#xref_6_40.md).

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<span id="xref_6_36">6\_36</span>. Arnobius, who was indebted to
Cornelius Labeo for some exact information on the doctrines of the magi,
says (IV, 12, p. 150, 12, Reifferscheid): "Magi suis in accitionibus
memorant antitheos saepius obrepere pro accitis, esse autem hos quosdam
materiis ex crassioribus spiritus qui deos se fingant, nesciosque
mendaciis et simulationibus ludant." Lactantius, the pupil of Arnobius,
used the same word in speaking of Satan that a Mazdean would have used
in referring to Ahriman (*Inst. divin.*, II, 9, 13, p. 144, 13, Brandt):
"Nox quam pravo illi antitheo dicimus attributam"; he is the *aemulus
Dei*.--Heliodorus who has made use in his *Aethiopica* of data taken
from the Mazdean beliefs (see *Monuments relatifs aux mystères de
Mithra*, volume I, p. 336, n. 2) uses the Greek word in the same sense,
(IV, 7, p. 105, 27, Bekker ed.): Ἀντίθεός τις ἔοικεν ἐμποδίζειν τὴν
πρᾶξιν.--The Ps.-Iamblichus, *De myster.*, III, 31, § 15, likewise
speaks of δαιμονες πονηρὺς οὒς δὴ καὶ καλοῦσιν ἀντιθέους. Finally the
magical papyri also knew of the existence of these deceiving spirits
(Wessely, *Denksch. Akad. Wien*, XLII, p. 42, v. 702: Πέμψον μοι τὸν
ἀληθινὸν δίχα τινὸς ἀντιθέου πλανοδαίμονος).

<span id="xref_6_37">6\_37</span>. In a passage to which we shall return
in note  [6\_39](orrp19.htm#xref_6_39), Porphyry (*De Abstin.*, II, 42.md),
speaks of the demons in almost the same terms as Arnobius: Τὸ γὰρ φεῦδος
τούτοις οἰκεῖον· Βούλονται γὰρ εῖ᾽ναι θεοὶ καὶ ἡ προσετῶσα αὐτῶν δύναμις
δοκεῖν θεὸς εῖ᾽ναι ὁ μέγιοστος the *De philos. ex orac. hour.* (pp. 147
ff. Wolff), an early work in which be followed other sources than those
in *De Abstinentia*, Porphyry made Serapis (= Pluto) the chief of the
malevolent demons. There was bound to be a connection between the
Egyptian god of the underworld and the Ahriman of the Persians at an
early date.--A veiled allusion to this chief of demons may be contained
in Lucan, VI, 742 ff., and Plutarch who, in *De Iside*, 46, called
Ahriman Hades (*supra*, [p. 190](orrp11.htm#page_190.md); cf. *Mon. myst.
Mithra*, II, p. 131, No. 3), says elsewhere (*De latenter viv.*, 6, p.
1130):Τὸν δὲ τῆς ἐναντίας κύριον μοίρας, εἴτε θεὸς εἴτε δαίμων ἐστίν,
Ἄιδην ὀνομάζουσιν. Cf. Decharme, *Traditions religieuses chez les
Grecs*, 1904, p. 431, n. 1.

<span id="xref_6_38">6\_38</span>. The dedication *Diis angelis*
recently found at Viminacium

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (*Jahresh. Instituts in Wien*, 1905, Beiblatt,
p. 6), in a country where the Mithra worship had spread considerably
seems to me to refer to this. See Minuc. Felix, *Octav.*, 26: "Magorum
et eloquio et negotio primus Hostanes angelos, id est ministros et
nuntios Dei, eius venerationi novit assistere." St. Cypr., "Quod idola
dii n. s.," c. 6 (p. 24, 2, Hartel): "Ostanes et formam Dei veri negat
conspici posse et angelos veros sedi eius dicit adsistere." Cf.
Tertullian, *Apol.*, XXIII: "Magi habentes invitatorum angelorum et
daemonum adsistentem sibi potestatem;" Arnobius, II, 35 (p. 76, 15,
Reifferscheid); Aug., *Civ. Dei*, X, 9, and the texts collected by
Wolff, *Porphyrii de philos. ex orac. haurienda*, 1856, pp. 223 ff.;
Kroll, *De orac. Chaidaïcis*, 1894, pp. 53; Roscher, *Die
Hebdomadenlehre der griech. Philosophen*, Leipsic, 1906, p. 145; Abt,
*Apuleius und die Zauberei*, Giessen, 1909, p. 256.

<span id="xref_6_39">6\_39</span>. Porphyry, *De Abstin.*, IL 37-43,
expounds a theory about the demons, which, he says, he took from
"certain Platonists" (Πλατωνικοί τινες, Numenius and Cronius?). That
these authors, whoever they were, helped themselves freely to the
doctrines of the magi, seems to appear immediately from the whole of
Porphyry's exposition (one could almost give an endless commentary on it
with the help of the Mazdean books) and in particular from the mention
that is made of a power commanding the spirits of evil (see *supra*, n.
 [6\_37](orrp19.htm#xref_6_37).md). This conclusion is confirmed by a
comparison with the passage of Arnobius cited above (n.
 [6\_36](orrp19.htm#xref_6_36).md), who attributes similar theories to the
"magi," and with a chapter of the Ps.-Iamblichus (*De mysteriis*, III,
31) which develops analogous beliefs as being those of "Chaldean
prophets."--Porphyry also cites a "Chaldean" theologian in connection
with the influence of the demons, *De regressu animae* (Aug., *Civ.
Dei*, X, 9).

I conjecture that the source of all this demonology is the book
attributed to Hostanes which we find mentioned in the second century of
our era by Minucius Felix, St. Cyprian (*supra*, n.
 [6\_38](orrp19.htm#xref_6_38).md), etc.; cf. Wolff, *op. cit.*, p. 138;
*Mon. myst. Mithra*, I, p. 33. As a matter of fact it would be false
logic to try to explain the evolution of demonology, which is above
everything else religious, by the development of the philosophic
theories of the Greeks (see for instance the communications of Messrs.
Stock and Glover: *Transactions of the Congress of* 

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *History of Rel.*, Oxford, 1908, II, pp. 164
ff.). The influence of the popular Hellenic or foreign ideas has always
been preponderant here; and the Epinomis, which contains one of the
oldest accounts of the theory of demons, as proved *supra*, n.
 [6\_34](orrp19.htm#xref_6_34.md), was influenced by the Semitic notions
about genii, the ancestors of the *djinns* and the *wélys* of Islam.

If, as we believe, the text of Porphyry really sets forth the theology
of the magi, slightly modified by Platonic ideas based on popular
beliefs of the Greeks and perhaps of the barbarians, we shall be able to
draw interesting conclusions in regard to the mysteries of Mithra. For
instance, one of the principles developed is that the gods must not be
honored by the sacrifice of animated beings (ἔμψυχα), and that
immolation of victims should be reserved for the demons. The same idea
is found in Cornelius Labeo, (Aug., *Civ. Dei*, VIII, 13; see Arnobius,
VII, 24), and possibly it was the practice of the Mithra cult. Porphyry
(II, 36) speaks in this connection of rites and mysteries, but without
divulging them, and it is known that in the course of its history
Mazdaism passed from the bloody to the bloodless sacrifice (*Mon. myst.
Mithra*, I, p. 6).

<span id="xref_6_40">6\_40</span>. Cf. Plutarch, *De defectu orac.*, 10,
p. 415 A:

Ἐμοὶ δὲ δοκοῦσι πλείονας λῦσαι ἀπορίας οἱ τὸ τῶν δαιμόνων γένος ἐν μέσῳ
θέντες θεῶν καὶ ἀνθρώπων καὶ τρόπον τινὰ τὴν κοινωνίαν ἡμῶν συνάγον εἰς
ταὐτὸ καὶ σύναπτον ἐξεύροντες· εἴτε μάγων τῶν περὶ Ζωροάστρην ὁ λόγος
οῦ᾽τός ἐστι, εἴτε Θρᾴκιος . . .

<span id="xref_6_41">6\_41</span>. Cf. Minucius Felix, 26, § 11:
"Hostanes daemonas prodidit terrenos vagos humanitatis inimicos." The
pagan idea, that the air was peopled with evil spirits against whom man
had to [struggle](errata.htm#10.md) perpetually, persisted among the
Christians; cf. *Ephes.*, ii. 2, vi. 12, see also Prudentius,
*Hamartigenia*, 514 ff.

<span id="xref_6_42">6\_42</span>. Cf. Minucius Felix, *loc. cit.*:
"Magi non solum sciunt daemonas, sed quidquid miraculi ludunt, per
daemonas faciunt," etc. Cf. Aug., *Civ. Dei*, X, 9 and *infra*, ch. VII,

The eschatology of orthodox Mazdaism has been expounded recently by
Söderblom, *La vie future d'après le mazdéisme*, Paris, 1901.

<span id="xref_6_54">6\_54</span>. We have explained this theory above,
[p. 125](orrp09.htm#page_125.md). It was foreign to the religion of
Zoroaster and was introduced into the mysteries of Mithra with the
Chaldean astrology. Moreover, ancient mythological ideas were always
mixed with this learned theology. For instance, it was an old Oriental
belief that souls, being regarded as material, wore clothing (*Mon.
myst. Mithra*, I, p. 15, n. 5; Bousset, *Archiv für Religionswiss.*, IV,
1901, p. 233, n. 2; *Rev. hist. des relig.*, 1899, p. 243, and
especially Böklen, *Die Verwandtschaft der jüdisch-christlichen und der
parsischen Eschatologie*, Göttingen, 1902, pp. 61 ff. Thence arose the
notion prevalent to the end of paganism, that the soul in passing
through the planetary spheres, took on the qualities of the stars "like
successive tunics." Porphyry, *De abstin.*, 1, 31: Ἀποδυτεόν ἄρα τοὺσ
πολλοὺσ ἡμῖν χιτῶνας κ. τ. λ.; Macrobius, *Somnium Sc.*, I, II, § 12:
"In singulis sphaeris aetherea obvolutione vestitur"; I, 12, § 13:
"Luminosi corporis amicitur accessu"; Proclus, *In Tim.*, I, 113, 8,
Diehl ed.: Περιβάλλεσθαι χιτῶνας; Procl., *Opera*, Cousin ed., p. 222:
"Exuendum autem nobis et tunicas quas descendentes induti sumus"; Kroll,
*De orac. Chaidaïcis*, p. 51, n. 2: Ψυχὴ ἑσσαμένη νοῦν; Julian, *Or.*,
II, p. 123, 22, (Hertlein). Cf. Wendland, *Die hellenistisch-römische

\[paragraph continues\] Hippolytus, Philos., V, I, says of Isis
(Ishtar?) in connection with the Naasenians. She is ἑπτάστολος, because
nature also is covered with seven ethereal garments, the seven heavens
of the planets; see Ps.-Apul., *Asclepius*, 34 (p. 75, 2 Thomas):
"Mundum sensibilem et, quae in eo sunt, omnia a superiore illo mundo
quasi ex vestimento esse contecta." I have insisted upon the persistence
of this idea, because it may help us to grasp the significance
attributed to a detail of the Mithra ritual in connection with which
Porphyry relates nothing but contradictory interpretations. The persons
initiated into the seven degrees were obliged to put on different
costumes. The seven degrees of initiation successively conferred upon
the mystic were symbols of the seven planetary spheres, through which
the soul ascended after death (*Mon. myst. Mithra*, I, p. 316), the
garments assumed by the initiates were probably considered as emblems of
those "tunics" which the soul put on when descending into the lower
realms and discarded on returning to heaven.
