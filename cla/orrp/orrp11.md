# ASTROLOGY AND MAGIC.

WHEN we consider the absolute authority that astrology exercised under
the Roman empire, we find it hard to escape a feeling of surprise. It is
difficult to think that people could ever consider astrology as the most
valuable of all arts and the queen of
sciences, [7\_1](orrp20.htm#xref_7_1.md) and it is not easy for us to
imagine the moral conditions that made such a phenomenon possible,
because our state of mind to-day is very different. Little by little the
conviction has gained ground that all that can be known about the
future, at least the future of man and of human society, is conjecture,
The progress of knowledge has taught man to acquiesce in his ignorance.

In former ages it was different: forebodings and predictions found
universal credence. The ancient forms of divination, however, had fallen
somewhat into disrepute at the beginning of our era, like the rest of
the Greco-Roman religion. It was no longer thought that the eagerness or
reluctance with which the sacred hens ate their paste, or the direction
of the flight of the birds indicated coming success or disaster.
Abandoned, the Hellenic oracles were silent. Then appeared astrology,
surrounded with all the prestige of an exact science, and based upon the
experience of many centuries. It promised to ascertain the occurrences

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

of any one's life with as much precision as the date of an eclipse. The
world was drawn towards it by an irresistible attraction. Astrology did
away with, and gradually relegated to oblivion, all the ancient methods
that had been devised to solve the enigmas of the future. Haruspicy and
the augural art were abandoned, and not even the ancient fame of the
oracles could save them from falling into irretrievable desuetude. This
great chimera changed religion as well as divination, its spirit
penetrated everything. And truly, if, as some scholars still hold, the
main feature of science is the ability to
predict, [7\_2](orrp20.htm#xref_7_2.md) no branch of learning could compare
with this one, nor escape its influence.

The success of astrology was connected with that of the Oriental
religions, which lent it their support, as it in turn helped them. We
have seen how it forced itself upon Semitic paganism, how it transformed
Persian Mazdaism and even subdued the arrogance of the Egyptian
sacerdotal caste. [7\_3](orrp20.htm#xref_7_3.md) Certain mystical treatises
ascribed to the old Pharaoh Nechepso and his confidant, the priest
Petosiris, nebulous and abstruse works that became, one might say, the
Bible of the new belief in the power of the stars, were translated into
Greek, undoubtedly in Alexandria, about the year 150 before our
era. [7\_4](orrp20.htm#xref_7_4.md) About the same time the Chaldean
genethlialogy began to spread in Italy, with regard to which Berosus, a
priest of the god Baal, who came to Babylon from the island of Cos, had
previously succeeded in arousing the curiosity of the Greeks. In 139 a
praetor expelled the "Chaldaei" from Rome, together with the Jews. But
all the adherents of the Syrian goddess, of whom there was quite a
number in the Occident, were patrons and defenders of these Oriental

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

prophets, and police measures were no more successful in stopping the
diffusion of their doctrines, than in the case of the Asiatic mysteries.
In the time of Pompey, the senator Nigidius Figulus, who was an ardent
occultist, expounded the barbarian uranography in Latin. But the scholar
whose authority contributed most to the final acceptance of sidereal
divination was a Syrian philosopher of encyclopedic knowledge,
Posidonius of Apamea, the teacher of Cicero. [7\_5](orrp20.htm#xref_7_5.md)
The works of that erudite and religious writer influenced the
development of the entire Roman theology more than anything else.

Under the empire, while the Semitic Baals and Mithra were triumphing,
astrology manifested its power everywhere. During that period everybody
bowed to it. The Cæsars became its fervent devotees, frequently at the
expense of the ancient cults. Tiberius neglected the gods because he
believed only in fatalism, [7\_6](orrp20.htm#xref_7_6.md) and Otho, blindly
confiding in the Oriental seer, marched against Vitellius in spite of
the baneful presages that affrighted his official
clergy. [7\_7](orrp20.htm#xref_7_7.md) The most earnest scholars, Ptolemy
under the Antonines for instance, expounded the principles of that
pseudo-science, and the very best minds received them. In fact, scarcely
anybody made a distinction between astronomy and its illegitimate
sister. Literature took up this new and difficult subject, and, as early
as the time of Augustus or Tiberius, Manilius, inspired by the sidereal
fatalism, endeavored to make poetry of that dry "mathematics," as
Lucretius, his forerunner, had done with the Epicurean atomism. Even art
looked there for inspiration and depicted the stellar deities. At Rome
and in the provinces architects erected sumptuous *septizonia* in the
likeness of

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

the seven spheres in which the planets that rule our destinies
move. [7\_8](orrp20.htm#xref_7_8.md) This Asiatic divination was first
aristocratic [7\_9](orrp20.htm#xref_7_9.md)--because the obtaining of an
exact horoscope was a complicated matter, and consultations were
expensive--but it promptly became popular, especially in the urban
centers where Oriental slaves gathered in large numbers. The learned
genethlialogers of the observatories had unlicensed colleagues, who told
fortunes at street-crossings or in barnyards. Even common epitaphs,
which Rossi styles "the scum of inscriptions," have retained traces of
that belief. The custom arose of stating in epitaphs the exact length of
a life to the very hour, for the moment of birth determined that of
death:

*Nascentes morimur, finisque ab origine
pendet*. [7\_10](orrp20.htm#xref_7_10.md)

Soon neither important nor small matters were undertaken without
consulting the astrologer. His previsions were sought not only in regard
to great public events like the conduct of a war, the founding of a
city, or the accession of a ruler, not only in case of a marriage, a
journey, or a change of domicile; but the most trifling acts of
every-day life were gravely submitted to his sagacity. People would no
longer take a bath, go to the barber, change their clothes or manicure
their fingernails, without first awaiting the propitious
moment. [7\_11](orrp20.htm#xref_7_11.md) The collections of
"initiatives" <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) that have come to us
contain questions that make us smile: Will a son who is about to be born
have a big nose? Will a girl just coming into this world have gallant
adventures? [7\_12](orrp20.htm#xref_7_12.md) And certain precepts sound
almost like burlesques: he who gets his hair cut while

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

the moon is in her increase will become bald--evidently by
analogy. [7\_13](orrp20.htm#xref_7_13.md)

The entire existence of states and individuals, down to the slightest
incidents, was thought to depend on the stars. The absolute control they
were supposed to exercise over everybody's daily condition, even
modified the language in every-day use and left traces in almost all
idioms derived from the Latin. If we speak of a martial, or a jovial
character, or a lunatic, we are unconsciously admitting the existence,
in these heavenly bodies (Mars, Jupiter, Luna) of their ancient
qualities.

It must be acknowledged, however, that the Grecian spirit tried to
combat the folly that was taking hold of the world, and from the time of
its propagation astrology found opponents among the philosophers. The
most subtle of these adversaries was the probabilist Carneades, in the
second century before our era. The topical arguments which he advanced,
were taken up, reproduced, and developed in a thousand ways by later
polemicists. For instance, Were all the men that perish together in a
battle, born at the same moment, because they had the same fate? Or, on
the other hand, do we not observe that twins, born at the same time,
have the most unlike characters and the most different fortunes?

But dialectics are an accomplishment in which the Greeks ever excelled,
and the defenders of astrology found a reply to every objection. They
endeavored especially to establish firmly the truths of observation,
upon which rested the entire learned structure of their art: the
influence of the stars over the phenomena of nature and the characters
of individuals. Can it be

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

denied, they said, that the sun causes vegetation to appear and to
perish, and that it puts animals *en rut* or plunges them into lethargic
sleep? Does not the movement of the tide depend on the course of the
moon? Is not the rising of certain constellations accompanied every year
by storms? And are not the physical and moral qualities of the different
races manifestly determined by the climate in which they live? The
action of the sky on the earth is undeniable, and, the sidereal
influences once admitted, all previsions based on them are legitimate.
As soon as the first principle is admitted, all corollaries are
logically derived from it.

This way of reasoning was universally considered irrefutable. Before the
advent of Christianity, which especially opposed it because of its
idolatrous character, astrology had scarcely any adversaries except
those who denied the possibility of science altogether, namely, the
neo-Academicians, who held that man could not attain certainty, and such
radical sceptics as Sextus Empiricus. Upheld by the Stoics, however, who
with very few exceptions were in favor of astrology, it can be
maintained that it emerged triumphant from the first assaults directed
against it. The only result of the objections raised to it was to modify
some of its theories. Later, the general weakening of the spirit of
criticism assured astrology an almost uncontested domination. Its
adversaries did not renew their polemics; they limited themselves to the
repetition of arguments that had been opposed, if not refuted, a hundred
times, and consequently seemed worn out. At the court of the Severi any
one who should have denied the influence of the planets upon the events
of this world

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

would have been considered more preposterous than he who would admit it
to-day.

But, you will say, if the theorists did not succeed in proving the
doctrinal falsity of astrology, experience should have shown its
worthlessness. Errors must have occurred frequently and must have been
followed by cruel disillusionment. Having lost a child at the age of
four for whom a brilliant future had been predicted, the parents
stigmatized in the epitaph the "lying mathematician whose great renown
deluded them." [7\_14](orrp20.htm#xref_7_14.md) Nobody thought of denying
the possibility of such errors. Manuscripts have been preserved, wherein
the makers of horoscopes themselves candidly and learnedly explain how
they were mistaken in such and such a case, because they had not taken
into account some one of the data of the
problem. [7\_15](orrp20.htm#xref_7_15.md) Manilius, in spite of his
unlimited confidence in the power of reason, hesitated at the complexity
of an immense task that seemed to exceed the capacity of human
intelligence, [7\_16](orrp20.htm#xref_7_16.md) and in the second century,
Vettius Valens bitterly denounced the contemptible bunglers who claimed
to be prophets, without having had the long training necessary, and who
thereby cast odium and ridicule upon astrology, in the name of which
they pretended to operate. [7\_17](orrp20.htm#xref_7_17.md) It must be
remembered that astrology, like medicine, was not only a science, <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) but also an art. <span
id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md) This comparison, which sounds irreverent
to-day, was a flattering one in the eyes of the
ancients. [7\_18](orrp20.htm#xref_7_18.md) To observe the sky was as
delicate a task as to observe the human body; to cast the horoscope of a
newly born child, just as perilous as to make a diagnosis, and to
interpret the cosmic symptoms just as hard as to interpret

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

those of our organism. In both instances the elements were complex and
the chances of error infinite. All the examples of patients dying in
spite of the physician, or on account of him, will never keep a person
who is tortured by physical pain from appealing to him for help; and
similarly those whose souls were troubled with ambition or fear turned
to the astrologer for some remedy for the moral fever tormenting them.
The calculator, who claimed to determine the moment of death, and the
medical practitioner who claimed to avert it received the anxious
patronage of people worried by this formidable issue. Furthermore, just
as marvelous cures were reported, striking predictions were called to
mind or, if need were, invented. The diviner had, as a rule, only a
restricted number of possibilities to deal with, and the calculus of
probabilities shows that he must have succeeded sometimes. Mathematics,
which he invoked, was in his favor after all, and chance frequently
corrected mischance. Moreover, did not the man who had a well-frequented
consulting-office, possess a thousand means, if he was clever, of
placing all the chances on his side, in the hazardous profession he
followed, and of reading in the stars anything he thought expedient? He
observed the earth rather than the sky, and took care not to fall into a
well.

\*    \*    \*

However, what helped most to make astrology invulnerable to the blows of
reason and of common sense, was the fact that in reality, the apparent
rigor of its calculus and its theorems notwithstanding, it was not a
science but a faith. We mean not only that

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

it implied belief in postulates that could not be proved--the same thing
might be said of almost all of our poor human knowledge, and even our
systems of physics and cosmology in the last analysis are based upon
hypotheses--but that astrology was born and reared in the temples of
Chaldea and Egypt. [7\_19](orrp20.htm#xref_7_19.md) Even in the Occident it
never forgot its sacerdotal origin and never more than half freed itself
from religion, whose offspring it was. Here lies the connection between
astrology and the Oriental religions, and I wish to draw the reader's
special attention to this point.

The Greek works and treatises on astrology that have come down to us
reveal this essential feature only very imperfectly. The Byzantines
stripped this pseudo-science, always regarded suspiciously by the
church, of everything that savored of paganism. Their process of
purification can, in some instances, be traced from manuscript to
manuscript. [7\_20](orrp20.htm#xref_7_20.md) If they retained the name of
some god or hero of mythology, the only way they dared to write it was
by cryptography. They have especially preserved purely didactic
treatises, the most perfect type of which is Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos which
has been constantly quoted and commented upon; and they have reproduced
almost exclusively expurgated texts, in which the principles of various
doctrines are drily summarized. During the classic age works of a
different character were commonly read. Many "Chaldeans" interspersed
their cosmological calculations and theories with moral considerations
and mystical speculations. In the first part of a work that he names
"Vision," <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) Critodemus, in prophetic
language, represents the truths he reveals

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

as a secure harbor of refuge from the storms of this world, and he
promises his readers to raise them to the rank of
immortals. [7\_21](orrp20.htm#xref_7_21.md) Vettius Valens, a contemporary
of Marcus Aurelius, implored them in solemn terms, not to divulge to the
ignorant and impious the arcana he was about to acquaint them
with. [7\_22](orrp20.htm#xref_7_22.md) The astrologers liked to assume the
appearance of incorruptible and holy priests and to consider their
calling a sacerdotal one. [7\_23](orrp20.htm#xref_7_23.md) In fact, the two
ministries sometimes combined: A dignitary of the Mithraic clergy called
himself *studiosus astrologiae* [7\_24](orrp20.htm#xref_7_24.md) in his
epitaph, and a member of a prominent family of Phrygian prelates
celebrated in verse the science of divination which enabled him to issue
a number of infallible predictions. [7\_25](orrp20.htm#xref_7_25.md)

The sacred character of astrology revealed itself in some passages that
escaped the orthodox censure and in the tone some of its followers
assumed, but we must go further and show that astrology was religious in
its principles as well as in its conclusions, the debt it owed to
mathematics and observation notwithstanding.

The fundamental dogma of astrology, as conceived by the Greeks, was that
of universal solidarity. The world is a vast organism, all the parts of
which are connected through an unceasing exchange of molecules of
effluvia. The stars, inexhaustible generators of energy, constantly act
upon the earth and man--upon man, the epitome of all nature, a
"microcosm" whose every element corresponds to some part of the starry
sky. This was, in a few words, the theory formulated by the Stoic
disciples of the Chaldeans; [7\_26](orrp20.htm#xref_7_26.md) but if we
divest it of all the philosophic garments with which it has been
adorned, what do we find? The idea of sympathy,

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

a belief as old as human society! The savage peoples also established
mysterious relations between all bodies and all the beings that inhabit
the earth and the heavens, and which to them were animated with a life
of their own endowed with latent power, but we shall speak of this later
on, when taking up the subject of magic. Even before the propagation of
the Oriental religions, popular superstition in Italy and Greece
attributed a number of odd actions to the sun, the moon, and the
constellations as well. [7\_27](orrp20.htm#xref_7_27.md)

The Chaldaei, however, claimed a predominant power for the stars. In
fact, they were regarded as gods *par excellence* by the religion of the
ancient Chaldeans in its beginnings. The sidereal religion of Babylon
concentrated deity, one might say, in the luminous moving bodies at the
expense of other natural objects, such as stones, plants, animals, which
the primitive Semitic faith considered equally divine. The stars always
retained this character, even at Rome. They were not, as to us,
infinitely distant bodies moving in space according to the inflexible
laws of mechanics, and whose chemical composition may be determined. To
the Latins as to the Orientals, they were propitious or baleful deities,
whose ever-changing relations determined the events of this world.

The sky, whose unfathomable depth had not yet been perceived, was
peopled with heroes and monsters of contrary passions, and the struggle
above had an immediate echo upon earth. By what principle have such a
quality and so great an influence been attributed to the stars? Is it
for reasons derived from their apparent motion and known through
observation or experience? Sometimes. Saturn made people apathetic

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

and irresolute, because it moved most slowly of all the
planets. [7\_28](orrp20.htm#xref_7_28.md) But in most instances purely
mythological reasons inspired the precepts of astrology. The seven
planets were associated with certain deities, Mars, Venus, or Mercury,
whose character and history are known to all. It is sufficient simply to
pronounce their names to call to mind certain personalities that may be
expected to act according to their natures, in every instance. It was
natural for Venus to favor lovers, and for Mercury to assure the success
of business transactions and dishonest deals. The same applies to the
constellations, with which a number of legends are connected:
"catasterism" or translation into the stars, became the natural
conclusion of a great many tales. The heroes of mythology, or even those
of human society, continued to live in the sky in the form of brilliant
stars. There Perseus again met Andromeda, and the Centaur Chiron, who is
none other than Sagittarius, was on terms of good fellowship with the
Dioscuri.

These constellations, then, assumed to a certain extent the good and the
bad qualities of the mythical or historical beings that had been
transferred upon them. For instance, the serpent, which shines near the
northern pole, was the author of medical cures, because it was the
animal sacred to Æsculapius. [7\_29](orrp20.htm#xref_7_29.md)

The religious foundation of the rules of astrology, however, can not
always be recognized. Sometimes it is entirely forgotten, and in such
cases the rules assume the appearance of axioms, or of laws based upon
long observation of celestial phenomena. Here we have a simple aspect of
science. The process of

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

assimilation with the gods and catasterism were known in the Orient long
before they were practiced in Greece.

The traditional outlines that we reproduce on our celestial maps are the
fossil remains of a luxuriant mythological vegetation, and besides our
classic sphere the ancients knew another, the "barbarian" sphere,
peopled with a world of fantastic persons and animals. These sidereal
monsters, to whom powerful qualities were ascribed, were likewise the
remnants of a multitude of forgotten beliefs. Zoolatry was abandoned in
the temples, but people continued to regard as divine the lion, the
bull, the bear, and the fishes, which the Oriental imagination had seen
in the starry vault. Old totems of the Semitic tribes or of the Egyptian
divisions lived again, transformed into constellations. Heterogeneous
elements, taken from all the religions of the Orient, were combined in
the uranography of the ancients, and in the power ascribed to the
phantoms that it evoked, vibrates in the indistinct echo of ancient
devotions that are often completely unknown to
us. [7\_30](orrp20.htm#xref_7_30.md)

Astrology, then, was religious in its origin and in its principles. It
was religious also in its close relation to the Oriental religions,
especially those of the Syrian Baals and of Mithra; finally, it was
religious in the effects that it produced. I do not mean the effects
expected from a constellation in any particular instance: as for example
the power to evoke the gods that were subject to their
domination. [7\_31](orrp20.htm#xref_7_31.md) But I have in mind the general
influence those doctrines exercised upon Roman paganism.

When the Olympian gods were incorporated among the stars, when Saturn
and Jupiter became planets and

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

the celestial virgin a sign of the zodiac, they assumed a character very
different from the one they had originally possessed. It has been
shown [7\_32](orrp20.htm#xref_7_32.md) how, in Syria, the idea of an
infinite repetition of cycles of years according to which the celestial
revolutions took place, led to the conception of divine eternity, how
the theory of a fatal domination of the stars over the earth brought
about that of the omnipotence of the "lord of the heavens," and how the
introduction of a universal religion was the necessary result of the
belief that the stars exerted an influence upon the peoples of every
climate. The logic of all these consequences of the principles of
astrology was plain to the Latin as well as to the Semitic races, and
caused a rapid transformation of the ancient idolatry. As in Syria, the
sun, which the astrologers called the leader of the planetary choir,
"who is established as king and leader of the whole
world," [7\_33](orrp20.htm#xref_7_33.md) necessarily became the highest
power of the Roman pantheon.

Astrology also modified theology, by introducing into this pantheon a
great number of new gods, some of whom were singularly abstract.
Thereafter man worshiped the constellations of the firmament,
[particularly](errata.htm#3.md) the twelve signs of the zodiac, every one
of which had its mythologic legend; the sky (*Caelus*) itself, because
it was considered the first cause, and was sometimes confused with the
supreme being; the four elements, the antithesis and perpetual
transmutations of which produced all tangible phenomena, and which were
often symbolized by a group of animals ready to devour each
other; [7\_34](orrp20.htm#xref_7_34.md) finally, time and its
subdivisions. [7\_35](orrp20.htm#xref_7_35.md)

The calendars were religious before they were secular; their purpose was
not, primarily, to record fleeting

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

time, but to observe the recurrence of propitious or inauspicious dates
separated by periodic intervals. It is a matter of experience that the
return of certain moments is associated with the appearance of certain
phenomena; they have, therefore, a special efficacy, and are endowed
with a sacred character. By determining periods with mathematical
exactness, astrology continued to see in them "a divine
power," [7\_36](orrp20.htm#xref_7_36.md) to use Zeno's term. Time, that
regulates the course of the stars and the transubstantiation of the
elements, was conceived of as the master of the gods and the primordial
principle, and was likened to destiny. Each part of its infinite
duration brought with it some propitious or evil movement of the sky
that was anxiously observed, and transformed the ever modified universe.
The centuries, the years and the seasons, placed into relation with the
four winds and the four cardinal points, the [twelve](errata.htm#4.md)
months connected with the zodiac, the day and the night, the twelve
hours, all were personified and deified, as the authors of every change
in the universe. The allegorical figures contrived for these
abstractions by astrological paganism did not even perish with it. The
symbolism it had disseminated outlived it, and until the Middle Ages
these pictures of fallen gods were reproduced indefinitely in sculpture,
mosaics, and in Christian miniatures. [7\_38](orrp20.htm#xref_7_38.md)

Thus astrology entered into all religious ideas, and the doctrines of
the destiny of the world and of man harmonized with its teachings.
According to Berosus, who is the interpreter of ancient Chaldean
theories, the existence of the universe consisted of a series of "big
years," each having its summer and its winter. Their summer took place
when all the planets were in

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

conjunction at the same point of Cancer, and brought with it a general
conflagration. On the other hand, their winter came when all the planets
were joined in Capricorn, and its result was a universal flood. Each of
these cosmic cycles, the duration of which was fixed at 432,000 years
according to the most probable estimate, was an exact reproduction of
those that had preceded it. In fact, when the stars resumed exactly the
same position, they were forced to act in identically the same manner as
before. This Babylonian theory, an anticipation of that of the "eternal
return of things," which Nietzsche boasts of having discovered, enjoyed
lasting popularity during antiquity, and in various forms came down to
the Renaissance. [7\_39](orrp20.htm#xref_7_39.md) The belief that the world
would be destroyed by fire, a theory also spread abroad by the Stoics,
found a new support in these cosmic speculations.

Astrology, however, revealed the future not only of the universe, but
also of man. According to a Chaldeo-Persian doctrine, accepted by the
pagan mystics and previously pointed out by
us, [7\_40](orrp20.htm#xref_7_40.md) a bitter necessity compelled the souls
that dwell in great numbers on the celestial heights, to descend upon
this earth and to animate certain bodies that are to hold them in
captivity. In descending to the earth they travel through the spheres of
the planets and receive some quality from each of these wandering stars,
according to its positions. Contrariwise, when death releases them from
their carnal prison, they return to their first habitation, providing
they have led a pious life, and if as they pass through the doors of the
superposed heavens they divest themselves of the passions and
inclinations acquired during their first journey,

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

to ascend finally, as pure essence to the radiant abode of the gods.
There they live forever among the eternal stars, freed from the tyranny
of destiny and even from the limitations of time.

This alliance of the theorems of astronomy with their old beliefs
supplied the Chaldeans with answers to all the questions that men asked
concerning the relation of heaven and earth, the nature of God, the
existence of the world, and their own destiny. Astrology was really the
first scientific theology. Hellenistic logic arranged the Oriental
doctrines properly, combined them with the Stoic philosophy and built
them up into a system of [indisputable](errata.htm#5.md) grandeur, an ideal
reconstruction of the universe, the powerful assurance of which inspired
Manilius to sublime language when he was not exhausted by his efforts to
master an ill-adapted theme. [7\_41](orrp20.htm#xref_7_41.md) The vague and
irrational notion of "sympathy" is transformed into a deep sense of the
relationship between the human soul, an igneous substance, and the
divine stars, and this feeling is strengthened by
thought. [7\_42](orrp20.htm#xref_7_42.md) The contemplation of the sky has
become a communion. During the splendor of night the mind of man became
intoxicated with the light streaming from above; born on the wings of
enthusiasm, he ascended into the sacred choir of the stars and took part
in their harmonious movements. "He participates in their immortality,
and, before his appointed hour, converses with the
gods." [7\_43](orrp20.htm#xref_7_43.md) In spite of the subtle precision
the Greeks always maintained in their speculations, the feeling that
permeated astrology down to the end of paganism never belied its
Oriental and religious origin.

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

The most essential principle of astrology was that of fatalism. As the
poet says: [7\_44](orrp20.htm#xref_7_44.md)

"*Fata regunt orbem, certa stant omnia lege*."

The Chaldeans were the first to conceive the idea of an inflexible
necessity ruling the universe, instead of gods acting in the world
according to their passions, like men in society. They noticed that an
immutable law regulated the movements of the celestial bodies, and, in
the first enthusiasm of their discovery they extended its effects to all
moral and social phenomena. The postulates of astrology imply an
absolute determinism. Tyche, or deified fortune, became the irresistible
mistress of mortals and immortals alike, and was even worshiped
exclusively by some under the empire. Our deliberate will never plays
more than a very limited part in our happiness and success, but, among
the pronunciamentos and in the anarchy of the third century, blind
chance seemed to play with the life of every one according to its fancy,
and it can easily be understood that the ephemeral rulers of that
period, like the masses, saw in chance the sovereign disposer of their
fates. [7\_45](orrp20.htm#xref_7_45.md)

The power of this fatalist conception during antiquity may be measured
by its long persistence, at least in the Orient, where it originated.
Starting from Babylonia, [7\_46](orrp20.htm#xref_7_46.md) it spread over
the entire Hellenic world, as early as the Alexandrian period, and
towards the end of paganism a considerable part of the efforts of the
Christian apologists was directed against
it. [7\_47](orrp20.htm#xref_7_47.md) But it was destined to outlast all
attacks, and to impose itself even on
Islam. [7\_48](orrp20.htm#xref_7_48.md) In Latin Europe, in spite of the
anathemas of the church, the belief remained confusedly

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

alive all through the Middle Ages that on this earth everything happens
somewhat

"Per ovra delle rote magne,  
Che drizzan ciascun seme ad alcun fine  
Secondo che le stella son campagne." [7\_49](orrp20.htm#xref_7_49.md)

The weapons used by the ecclesiastic writers in contending against this
sidereal fatalism were taken from the arsenal of the old Greek
dialectics. In general, they were those that all defenders of free will
had used for centuries: determinism destroys responsibility; rewards and
punishments are absurd if man acts under a necessity that compels him,
if he is born a hero or a criminal. We shall not dwell on these
metaphysical discussions, [7\_50](orrp20.htm#xref_7_50.md) but there is one
argument that is more closely connected with our subject, and therefore
should be mentioned. If we live under an immutable fate, no supplication
can change its decisions; religion is unavailing, it is useless to ask
the oracles to reveal the secrets of a future which nothing can change,
and prayers, to use one of Seneca's expressions, are nothing but "the
solace of diseased minds." [7\_51](orrp20.htm#xref_7_51.md)

And, doubtless, some adepts of astrology, like the Emperor
Tiberius, [7\_52](orrp20.htm#xref_7_52.md) neglected the practice of
religion, because they were convinced that fate governed all things.
Following the example set by the Stoics, they made absolute submission
to an almighty fate and joyful acceptance of the inevitable a moral
duty, and were satisfied to worship the superior power that ruled the
universe, without demanding anything in return. They considered
themselves at the mercy of even the most capricious fate, and were like
the intelligent slave who guesses the desires of his master to satisfy
them, and

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

knows how to make the hardest servitude
tolerable. [7\_53](orrp20.htm#xref_7_53.md) The masses, however, never
reached that height of resignation. They looked at astrology far more
from a religious than from a logical
standpoint. [7\_54](orrp20.htm#xref_7_54.md) The planets and constellations
were not only cosmic forces, whose favorable or inauspicious action grew
weaker or stronger according to the turnings of a course established for
eternity; they were deities who saw and heard, who were glad or sad, who
had a voice and sex, who were prolific or sterile, gentle or savage,
obsequious or arrogant. [7\_55](orrp20.htm#xref_7_55.md) Their anger could
therefore be soothed and their favor obtained through rites and
offerings; even the adverse stars were not unrelenting and, could be
persuaded through sacrifices and supplications. The narrow and pedantic
Firmicus Maternus strongly asserts the omnipotence of fate, but at the
same time he invokes the gods and asks for their aid against the
influence of the stars. As late as the fourth century the pagans of Rome
who were about to marry, or to make a purchase, or to solicit a public
office, went to the diviner for his prognostics, at the same time
praying to Fate for prosperity in their
undertaking. [7\_56](orrp20.htm#xref_7_56.md) Thus a fundamental antinomy
manifested itself all through the development of astrology, which
pretended to be an exact science, but always remained a sacerdotal
theology.

Of course, the more the idea of fatalism imposed itself and spread, the
more the weight of this hopeless theory oppressed the consciousness. Man
felt himself dominated and crushed by blind forces that dragged him on
as irresistibly as they kept the celestial spheres in motion. His soul
tried to escape the oppression of this cosmic mechanism, and to leave
the slavery of

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

Ananke. But he no longer had confidence in the ceremonies of his old
religion. The new powers that had taken possession of heaven had to be
propitiated by new means. The Oriental religions themselves offered a
remedy against the evils they had created, and taught powerful and
mysterious processes for conjuring fate. [7\_57](orrp20.htm#xref_7_57.md)
And side by side with astrology we see magic, a more pernicious
aberration, gaining
[ground](errata.htm#6). [7\_58](orrp20.htm#xref_7_58.md)

\*    \*    \*

If, from the reading of Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos, we pass on to read a
magic papyrus, our first impression is that we have stepped from one end
of the intellectual world to the other. Here we find no trace of the
systematic order or severe method that distinguish the work of the
scholar of Alexandria. Of course, the doctrines of astrology are just as
chimerical as those of magic, but they are deduced with an amount of
logic, entirely wanting in works of sorcery, that compels reasoning
intellects to accept them. Recipes borrowed from medicine and popular
superstition, primitive practices rejected or abandoned by the
sacerdotal rituals, beliefs repudiated by a progressive moral religion,
plagiarisms and forgeries of literary or liturgic texts, incantations in
which the gods of all barbarous nations are invoked in unintelligible
gibberish, odd and disconcerting ceremonies--all these form a chaos in
which the imagination loses itself, a potpourri in which an arbitrary
syncretism seems to have attempted to create an inextricable confusion.

However, if we observe more closely how magic operates, we find that it
starts out from the same principles and acts along the same line of
reasoning

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

as astrology. Born during the same period in the primitive civilizations
of the Orient, both were based on a number of common
ideas. [7\_59](orrp20.htm#xref_7_59.md) Magic, like astrology, proceeded
from the principle of universal sympathy, yet it did not consider the
relation existing between the stars traversing the heavens, and physical
or moral phenomena, but the relation between whatever bodies there are.
It started out from the preconceived idea that an obscure but constant
relation exists between certain things, certain words, certain persons.
This connection was established without hesitation between dead material
things and living beings, because the primitive races ascribed a soul
and existence similar to those of man, to everything surrounding them.
The distinction between the three kingdoms of nature was unknown to
them; they were "animists." The life of a person might, therefore, be
linked to that of a thing, a tree, or an animal, in such a manner that
one died if the other did, and that any damage suffered by one was also
sustained by its inseparable associate. Sometimes the relation was
founded on clearly intelligible grounds, like a resemblance between the
thing and the being, as where, to kill an enemy, one pierced a waxen
figure supposed to represent him. Or a contact, even merely passing by,
was believed to have created indestructible affinities, for instance
where the garments of an absent person were operated upon. Often, also,
these imaginary relations were founded on reasons that escape us: like
the qualities attributed by astrology to the stars, they may have been
derived from old beliefs the memory of which is lost.

Like astrology, then, magic was a science in some respects. First, like
the predictions of its sister, it

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

was partly based on observation--observation frequently rudimentary,
superficial, hasty, and erroneous, but nevertheless important. It was an
experimental discipline. Among the great number of facts noted by the
curiosity of the magicians, there were many that received scientific
indorsement later on. The attraction of the magnet for iron was utilized
by the thaumaturgi before it was interpreted by the natural
philosophers. In the vast compilations that circulated under the
venerable names of Zoroaster or Hostanes, many fertile remarks were
scattered among puerile ideas and absurd teachings, just as in the Greek
treatises on alchemy that have come down to us. The idea that knowledge
of the power of certain agents enables one to stimulate the hidden
forces of the universe into action and to obtain extraordinary results,
inspires the researches of physics to-day, just as it inspired the
claims of magic. And if astrology was a perverted astronomy, magic was
physics gone astray.

Moreover, and again like astrology, magic was a science, because it
started from the fundamental conception that order and law exist in
nature, and that the same cause always produces the same effect. An
occult ceremony, performed with the same care as an experiment in the
chemical laboratory, will always have the expected result. To know the
mysterious affinities that connect all things is sufficient to set the
mechanism of the universe into motion. But the error of the magicians
consisted in establishing a connection between phenomena that do not
depend on each other at all. The act of exposing to the light for an
instant a sensitive plate in a camera, then immersing it, according to
given recipes, in appropriate liquids, and of making

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

the picture of a relative or friend appear thereon, is a magical
operation, but based on real actions and reactions, instead of on
arbitrarily assumed sympathies and antipathies. Magic, therefore, was a
science groping in the dark, and later became "a bastard sister of
science," as Frazer puts it.

But, like astrology, magic was religious in origin, and always remained
a bastard sister of religion. Both grew up together in the temples of
the barbarian Orient. Their practices were, at first, part of the
dubious knowledge of fetichists who claimed to have control over the
spirits that peopled nature and animated everything, and who claimed
that they communicated with these spirits by means of rites known to
themselves alone. Magic has been cleverly defined as "the strategy of
animism." [7\_60](orrp20.htm#xref_7_60.md) But, just as the growing power
ascribed by the Chaldeans to the sidereal deities transformed the
original astrology, so primitive sorcery assumed a different character
when the world of the gods, conceived after the image of man, separated
itself more and more from the realm of physical forces and became a
realm of its own. This gave the mystic element which always entered the
ceremonies, a new precision and development. By means of his charms,
talismans, and exorcisms, the magician now communicated with the
celestial or infernal "demons" and compelled them to obey him. But these
spirits no longer opposed him with the blind resistance of matter
animated by an uncertain kind of life; they were active and subtle
beings having intelligence and will-power. Sometimes they took revenge
for the slavery the magician attempted to impose on them and punished
the audacious operator, who feared them, although invoking

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

their aid. Thus the incantation often assumed the shape of a prayer
addressed to a power stronger than man, and magic became a religion. Its
rites developed side by side with the canonical liturgies, and
frequently encroached on them. [7\_61](orrp20.htm#xref_7_61.md) The only
barrier between them was the vague and constantly shifting borderline
that limits the neighboring domains of religion and superstition.

\*    \*    \*

This half scientific, half religious magic, with its books and its
professional adepts, is of Oriental origin. The old Grecian and Italian
sorcery appears to have been rather mild. Conjurations to avert
hail-storms, or formulas to draw rain, evil charms to render fields
barren or to kill cattle, love philters and rejuvenating salves, old
women's remedies, talismans against the evil eye,--all are based on
popular superstition and kept in existence by folk-lore and
charlatanism. Even the witches of Thessaly, whom people credited with
the power of making the moon descend from the sky, were botanists more
than anything else, acquainted with the marvelous virtues of medicinal
plants. The terror that the necromancers inspired was due, to a
considerable extent, to the use they made of the old belief in ghosts.
They exploited the superstitious belief in ghost-power and slipped metal
tablets covered with execrations into graves, to bring misfortune or
death to some enemy. But neither in Greece nor in Italy is there any
trace of a coherent system of doctrines, of an occult and learned
discipline, nor of any sacerdotal instruction.

Originally the adepts in this dubious art were despised.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

\[paragraph continues\] As late as the period of Augustus they were
generally equivocal beggar-women who plied their miserable trade in the
lowest quarters of the slums. But with the invasion of the Oriental
religions the magician began to receive more consideration, and his
condition improved. [7\_62](orrp20.htm#xref_7_62.md) He was honored, and
feared even more. During the second century scarcely anybody would have
doubted his power to call up divine apparitions, converse with the
superior spirits and even translate himself bodily into the
heavens. [7\_63](orrp20.htm#xref_7_63.md)

Here the victorious progress of the Oriental religions shows itself. The
Egyptian ritual [7\_64](orrp20.htm#xref_7_64.md) originally was nothing but
a collection of magical practices, properly speaking. The religious
community imposed its will upon the gods by means of prayers or even
threats. The gods were compelled to obey the officiating priest, if the
liturgy was correctly performed, and if the incantations and the magic
words were pronounced with the right intonation. The well-informed
priest had an almost unlimited power over all supernatural beings on
land, in the water, in the air, in heaven and in hell. Nowhere was the
gulf between things human and things divine smaller, nowhere was the
increasing differentiation that separated magic from religion less
advanced. Until the end of paganism they remained so closely associated
that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the texts of one from
those of the other.

The Chaldeans [7\_65](orrp20.htm#xref_7_65.md) also were past masters of
sorcery, well versed in the knowledge of presages and experts in
conjuring the evils which the presages foretold. In Mesopotamia, where
they were confidential advisers of the kings, the magicians belonged to
the official

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

clergy; they invoked the aid of the state gods in their incantations,
and their sacred science was as highly esteemed as haruspicy in Etruria.
The immense prestige that continued to surround it, assured its
persistence after the fall of Nineveh and Babylon. Its tradition was
still alive under the Cæsars, and a number of enchanters rightly or
wrongly claimed to possess the ancient wisdom of
Chaldea. [7\_66](orrp20.htm#xref_7_66.md)

And the thaumaturgus, who was supposed to be the heir of the archaic
priests, assumed a wholly sacerdotal appearance at Rome. Being an
inspired sage who received confidential communications from heavenly
spirits, he gave to his life and to his appearance a dignity almost
equal to that of the philosopher. The common people soon confused the
two, [7\_67](orrp20.htm#xref_7_67.md) and the Orientalizing philosophy of
the last period of paganism actually accepted and justified all the
superstitions of magic. Neo-Platonism, which concerned itself to a large
extent with demonology, leaned more and more towards theurgy, and was
finally completely absorbed by it.

But the ancients expressly distinguished, "magic," which was always
under suspicion and disapproved of, from the legitimate and honorable
art for which the name "theurgy" [7\_68](orrp20.htm#xref_7_68.md) was
invented. The term "magician," <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) which
applied to all performers of miracles, properly means the priests of
Mazdaism, and a well attested tradition makes the
Persians [7\_69](orrp20.htm#xref_7_69.md) the authors of the real magic,
that called "black magic" by the Middle Ages. If they did not invent
it--because it is as old as humanity--they were at least the first to
place it upon a doctrinal foundation and to assign to it a place

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

in a clearly formulated theological system. The Mazdean dualism gave a
new power to this pernicious knowledge by conferring upon it the
character that will distinguish it henceforth.

Under what influences did the Persian magic come into existence? When
and how did it spread? These are questions that are not well elucidated
yet. The intimate fusion of the religious doctrines of the Iranian
conquerors with those of the native clergy, which took place at Babylon,
occurred in this era of belief, [7\_70](orrp20.htm#xref_7_70.md), and the
magicians that were established in Mesopotamia combined their secret
traditions with the rites and formulas codified by the Chaldean
sorcerers. The universal curiosity of the Greeks soon took note of this
marvelous science. Naturalist philosophers like
Democritus, [7\_71](orrp20.htm#xref_7_71.md) the great traveler, seem to
have helped themselves more than once from the treasure of observations
collected by the Oriental priests. Without a doubt they drew from these
incongruous compilations, in which truth was mingled with the absurd and
reality with the fantastical, the knowledge of some properties of plants
and minerals, or of some experiments of physics. However, the limpid
Hellenic genius always turned away from the misty speculations of magic,
giving them but slight consideration. But towards the end of the
Alexandrine period the books ascribed to the half-mythical masters of
the Persian science, Zoroaster, Hostanes and Hystaspes, were translated
into Greek, and until the end of paganism those names enjoyed a
prodigious authority. At the same time the Jews, who were acquainted
with the arcana of the Irano-Chaldean doctrines and proceedings, made
some of the recipes known wherever the dispersion brought

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

them. [7\_72](orrp20.htm#xref_7_72.md) Later, a more immediate influence
was exercised upon the Roman world by the Persian colonies of Asia
Minor, [7\_73](orrp20.htm#xref_7_73.md) who retained an obstinate faith in
their ancient national beliefs.

The particular importance attributed to magic by the Mazdeans is a
necessary consequence of their dualist system, which has been treated by
us before. [7\_74](orrp20.htm#xref_7_74.md) Ormuzd, residing in the heavens
of light, is opposed by his irreconcilable adversary, Ahriman, ruler of
the underworld. The one stands for light, truth, and goodness, the other
for darkness, falsehood, and perversity. The one commands the kind
spirits which protect the pious believer, the other is master over
demons whose malice causes all the evils that afflict humanity. These
opposite principles fight for the domination of the earth, and each
creates favorable or noxious animals and plants. Everything on earth is
either heavenly or infernal. Ahriman and his demons, who surround man to
tempt or hurt him, [7\_75](orrp20.htm#xref_7_75.md) are evil gods and
entirely different from those of which Ormuzd's host consists. The
magician sacrifices to them, either to avert evils they threaten, or to
direct their ire against enemies of true belief, and the impure spirits
rejoice in bloody immolations and delight in the fumes of flesh burning
on the altars. [7\_76](orrp20.htm#xref_7_76.md) Terrible acts and words
attended all immolations. Plutarch [7\_77](orrp20.htm#xref_7_77.md)
mentions an example of the dark sacrifices of the Mazdeans. "In a
mortar," he says, "they pound a certain herb called wild garlic, at the
same time invoking Hades (Ahriman), and the powers of darkness, then
stirring this herb in the blood of a slaughtered wolf, they take it away
and drop it on a spot never reached by the rays of the sun." A
necromantic performance indeed.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

We can imagine the new strength which such a conception of the universe
must have given to magic. It was no longer an incongruous collection of
popular superstitions and scientific observations. It became a reversed
religion: its nocturnal rites were the dreadful liturgy of the infernal
powers. There was no miracle the experienced magician might not expect
to perform with the aid of the demons, providing he know how to master
them; he would invent any atrocity in his desire to gain the favor of
the evil divinities whom crime gratified and suffering pleased. Hence
the number of impious practices performed in the dark, practices the
horror of which is equaled only by their absurdity: preparing beverages
that disturbed the senses and impaired the intellect; mixing subtle
poisons extracted from demoniac plants and corpses already in a state of
putridity; [7\_78](orrp20.htm#xref_7_78.md) immolating children in order to
read the future in their quivering entrails or to conjure up ghosts. All
the satanic refinement that a perverted imagination in a state of
insanity could conceive [7\_79](orrp20.htm#xref_7_79.md) pleased the
malicious evil spirits; the more odious the monstrosity, the more
assured was its efficacy. These abominable practices were sternly
suppressed by the Roman government. Whereas, in the case of an
astrologer who had committed an open transgression, the law was
satisfied with expelling him from Rome--whither he generally soon
returned,--the magician was put in the same class with murderers and
poisoners, and was subjected to the very severest punishment. He was
nailed to the cross or thrown to the wild beasts. Not only the practice
of the profession, but even the simple fact of possessing works of
sorcery made any one subject to
prosecution. [7\_80](orrp20.htm#xref_7_80.md)

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

However, there are ways of reaching an agreement with the police, and in
this case custom was stronger than law. The intermittent rigor of
imperial edicts had no more power to destroy an inveterate superstition
than the Christian polemics had to cure it. It was a recognition of its
strength when state and church united to fight it. Neither reached the
root of the evil, for they did not deny the reality of the power wielded
by the sorcerers. As long as it was admitted that malicious spirits
constantly interfered in human affairs, and that there were secret means
enabling the operator to dominate those spirits or to share in their
power, magic was indestructible. It appealed to too many human passions
to remain unheard. If, on the one hand, the desire of penetrating the
mysteries of the future, the fear of unknown misfortunes, and hope,
always reviving, led the anxious masses to seek a chimerical certainty
in astrology, on the other hand, in the case of magic, the blinding
charm of the marvelous, the entreaties of love and ambition, the bitter
desire for revenge, the fascination of crime, and the intoxication of
bloodshed,--all the instincts that are not avowable and that are
satisfied in the dark, took turns in practising their seductions. During
the entire life of the Roman empire its existence continued, and the
very mystery that it was compelled to hide in increased its prestige and
almost gave it the authority of a revelation.

A curious occurrence that took place towards the end of the fifth
century at Beirut, in Syria, shows how deeply even the strongest
intellects of that period believed in the most atrocious practices of
magic. One night some students of the famous law-school of that

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

city attempted to kill a slave in the circus, to aid the master in
obtaining the favor of a woman who scorned him. Being reported, they had
to deliver up their hidden volumes, of which those of Zoroaster and of
Hostanes were found, together with those written by the astrologer
Manetho. The whole city was agitated, and searches proved that many
young men preferred the study of the illicit science to that of Roman
law. By order of the bishop a solemn auto-da-fé was made of all this
literature, in the presence of the city officials and the clergy, and
the most revolting passages were read in public, "in order to acquaint
everybody with the conceited and vain promises of the demons," as the
pious writer of the story says. [7\_81](orrp20.htm#xref_7_81.md)

Thus the ancient traditions of magic continued to live in the Christian
Orient after the fall of paganism. They even outlived the domination of
the church. The rigorous principles of its monotheism notwithstanding,
Islam became infected with those Persian superstitions. In the Occident
the evil art resisted persecution and anathemas with the same obstinacy
as in the Orient. It remained alive in Rome all through the fifth
century, [7\_82](orrp20.htm#xref_7_82.md) and when scientific astrology in
Europe went down with science itself, the old Mazdean dualism continued
to manifest itself, during the entire Middle Ages in the ceremonies of
the black mass and the worshiping of Satan, until the dawn of the modern
era.

\*    \*    \*

Twin sisters, born of the superstitions of the learned Orient, magic and
astrology always remained the hybrid daughters of sacerdotal culture.
Their existence

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

was governed by two contrary principles, reason and faith, and they
never ceased to fluctuate between these two poles of thought. Both were
inspired by a belief in universal sympathy, according to which occult
and powerful relations exist between human beings and dead objects, all
possessing a mysterious life. The doctrine of sidereal influences,
combined with a knowledge of the immutability of the celestial
revolutions, caused astrology to formulate the first theory of absolute
fatalism, whose decrees might be known beforehand. But, besides this
rigorous determinism, it retained its childhood faith in the divine
stars, whose favor could be secured and malignity avoided through
worship. In astrology the experimental method was reduced to the
completing of prognostics based on the supposed character of the stellar
gods.

Magic also remained half empirical and half religious. Like our physics,
it was based on observation, it proclaimed the constancy of the laws of
nature, and sought to conquer the latent energies of the material world
in order to bring them under the dominion of man's will. But at the same
time it recognized, in the powers that it claimed to conquer, spirits or
demons whose protection might be obtained, whose ill-will might be
appeased, or whose savage hostility might be unchained by means of
immolations and incantations.

All their aberrations notwithstanding, astrology and magic were not
entirely fruitless. Their counterfeit learning has been a genuine help
to the progress of human knowledge. Because they awakened chimerical
hopes and fallacious ambitions in the minds of their adepts, researches
were undertaken which undoubtedly

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

would never have been started or persisted in for the sake of a
disinterested love of truth. The observations, collected with untiring
patience by the Oriental priests, caused the first physical and
astronomical discoveries, and, as in the time of the scholastics, the
occult sciences led to the exact ones. But when these understood the
vanity of the astounding illusions on which astrology and magic had
subsisted, they broke up the foundation of the arts to which they owed
their birth.
