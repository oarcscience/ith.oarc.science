# PREFACE.

IN November, 1905, the Collège de France honored the writer by asking
him to succeed M. Naville in opening the series of lectures instituted
by the Michonis foundation. A few months later the "Hibbert Trust"
invited him to Oxford to develop certain subjects which he had touched
upon at Paris. In this volume have been collected the contents of both
series with the addition of a short bibliography and notes intended for
scholars desirous of verifying assertions made in the
text. [0\_1](orrp13.htm#xref_0_1.md) The form of the work has scarcely been
changed, but we trust that these pages, intended though they were for
oral delivery, will bear reading, and that the title of these studies
will not seem too ambitious for what they have to offer. The propagation
of the Oriental religions, with the development of neo-Platonism, is the
leading fact in the moral history of the pagan empire. May this small
volume on a great subject throw at least some light upon this truth, and
may the reader receive these essays with the same kind interest shown by
the audiences at Paris and Oxford.

The reader will please remember that the different chapters were thought
out and written as lectures. They do not claim to contain a debit and
credit account of what the Latin paganism borrowed from or loaned to the
Orient. Certain well-known facts have been deliberately

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

passed over in order to make room for others that are perhaps less
known. We have taken liberties with our subject matter that would not be
tolerated in a didactic treatise, but to which surely no one will
object.

We are more likely to be reproached for an apparently serious omission.
We have investigated only the internal development of paganism in the
Latin world, and have considered its relation to Christianity only
incidentally and by the way. The question is nevertheless important and
has been the subject of celebrated lectures as well as of learned
monographs and widely distributed manuals. [0\_2](orrp13.htm#xref_0_2.md)
We wish to slight neither the interest nor the importance of that
controversy, and it is not because it seemed negligible that we have not
entered into it.

By reason of their intellectual bent and education the theologians were
for a long time more inclined to consider the continuity of the Jewish
tradition than the causes that disturbed it; but a reaction has taken
place, and to-day they endeavor to show that the church has borrowed
considerably from the conceptions and ritualistic ceremonies of the
pagan mysteries. In spite of the prestige that surrounded Eleusis, the
word "mysteries" calls up Hellenized Asia rather than Greece proper,
because in the first place the earliest Christian communities were
founded, formed and developed in the heart of Oriental populations,
Semites, Phrygians and Egyptians. Moreover the religions of those people
were much farther advanced, much richer in ideas and sentiments, more
striking and stirring than the Greco-Latin anthropomorphism. Their
liturgy always derives its inspiration from generally accepted beliefs

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

about purification embodied in certain acts regarded as sanctifying.
These facts were almost identical in the various sects. The new faith
poured its revelation into the hallowed moulds of earlier religions
because in that form alone could the world in which it developed receive
its message.

This is approximately the point of view adopted by the latest
historians.

But, however absorbing this important problem may be, we could not think
of going into it, even briefly, in these studies on Roman paganism. In
the Latin world the question assumes much more modest proportions, and
its aspect changes completely. Here Christianity spread only after it
had outgrown the embryonic state and really became established. Moreover
like Christianity the Oriental mysteries at Rome remained for a long
time chiefly the religion of a foreign minority. Did any exchange take
place between these rival sects? The silence of the ecclesiastical
writers is not sufficient reason for denying it. We dislike to
acknowledge a debt to our adversaries, because it means that we
recognize some value in the cause they defend, but I believe that the
importance of these exchanges should not be exaggerated. Without a doubt
certain ceremonies and holidays of the church were based on pagan
models. In the fourth century Christmas was placed on the 25th of
December because on that date was celebrated the birth of the sun
(*Natalis Invicti*) who was born to a new life each year after the
solstice. [0\_3](orrp13.htm#xref_0_3.md) Certain vestiges of the religions
of Isis and Cybele besides other polytheistic practices perpetuated
themselves in the adoration of local saints. On the other hand as soon
as Christianity became a moral power in

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

the world, it imposed itself even on its enemies. The Phrygian priests
of the Great Mother openly opposed their celebration of the vernal
equinox to the Christian Easter, and attributed to the blood shed in the
taurobolium the redemptive power of the blood of the divine
Lamb. [0\_4](orrp13.htm#xref_0_4.md)

All these facts constitute a series of very delicate problems of
chronology and interrelation, and it would be rash to attempt to solve
them en bloc. Probably there is a different answer in each particular
case, and I am afraid that some cases must always remain unsolved. We
may speak of "vespers of Isis" or of a "eucharist of Mithra and his
companions," but only in the same sense as when we say "the vassal
princes of the empire" or "Diocletian's socialism." These are tricks of
style used to give prominence to a similarity and to establish a
parallel strongly and closely. A word is not a demonstration, and we
must be careful not to infer an influence from an analogy. Preconceived
notions are always the most serious obstacles to an exact knowledge of
the past. Some modem writers, like the ancient Church Fathers, are fain
to see a sacrilegious parody inspired by the spirit of lies in the
resemblance between the mysteries and the church ceremonies. Other
historians seem disposed to agree with the Oriental priests, who claimed
priority for their cults at Rome, and saw a plagiarism of their ancient
rituals in the Christian ceremonies. It would appear that both are very
much mistaken. Resemblance does not necessarily presuppose imitation,
and frequently a similarity of ideas and practices must be explained by
common origin, exclusive of any borrowing.

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

An illustration will make my thought clearer. The votaries of Mithra
likened the practice of their religion to military service. When the
neophyte joined he was compelled to take an oath (*sacramentum*) similar
to the one required of recruits in the army, and there is no doubt that
an indelible mark was likewise branded on his body with a hot iron. The
third degree of the mystical hierarchy was that of "soldier" (*miles*).
Thenceforward the initiate belonged to the sacred militia of the
invincible god and fought the powers of evil under his orders. All these
ideas and institutions are so much in accord with what we know of
Mazdean dualism, in which the entire life was conceived as a struggle
against the malevolent spirits; they are so inseparable from the history
even of Mithraism, which always was a soldiers' religion, that we cannot
doubt they belonged to it before its appearance in the Occident.

On the other hand, we find similar conceptions in Christianity. The
society of the faithful--the term is still in use--is the "Church
Militant." During the first centuries the comparison of the church with
an army was carried out even in details; [0\_5](orrp13.htm#xref_0_5.md) the
baptism of the neophyte was the oath of fidelity to the flag taken by
the recruits. Christ was the "emperor," the commander-in-chief, of his
disciples, who formed cohorts triumphing under his command over the
demons; the apostates were deserters; the sanctuaries, camps; the pious
practices, drills and sentry-duty, and so on.

If we consider that the gospel preached peace, that for a long time the
Christians felt a repugnance to military service, where their faith was
threatened, we are tempted to admit *a priori* an influence of the
belligerent cult of Mithra upon Christian thought.

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

But this is not the case. The theme of the *militia Christi* appears in
the oldest ecclesiastical authors, in the epistles of St. Clement and
even in those of St. Paul. It is impossible to admit an imitation of the
Mithraic mysteries then, because at that period they had no importance
whatever.

But if we extend our researches to the history of that notion, we shall
find that, at least under the empire, the mystics of Isis were also
regarded as forming sacred cohorts enlisted in the service of the
goddess, that previously in the Stoic philosophy human existence was
frequently likened to a campaign, and that even the astrologers called
the man who submitted to destiny and renounced all revolt a "soldier of
fate." [0\_6](orrp13.htm#xref_0_6.md)

This conception of life, especially of religious life, was therefore
very popular from the beginning of our era. It was manifestly prior both
to Christianity and to Mithraism. It developed in the military
monarchies of the Asiatic Diadochi. Here the soldier was no longer a
citizen defending his country, but in most instances a volunteer bound
by a sacred vow to the person of his king. In the martial states that
fought for the heritage of the Achemenides this personal devotion
dominated or displaced all national feeling. We know the oaths taken by
those subjects to their deified kings. [0\_7](orrp13.htm#xref_0_7.md) They
agreed to defend and uphold them even at the cost of their own lives,
and always to have the same friends and the same enemies as they; they
dedicated to them not only their actions and words, but their very
thoughts. Their duty was a complete abandonment of their personality in
favor of those monarchs who were held the equals of the gods. The sacred
militia of the mysteries was nothing but this civic

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

morality viewed from the religious standpoint. It confounded loyalty
with piety.

As we see, the researches into the doctrines or practices common to
Christianity and the Oriental mysteries lead almost always beyond the
limits of the Roman empire into the Hellenistic Orient. The religious
conceptions which imposed themselves on Latin Europe under the
Cæsars [0\_8](orrp13.htm#xref_0_8.md) were developed there, and it is there
we must look for the key to enigmas still unsolved. It is true that at
present nothing is more obscure than the history of the religions that
arose in Asia when Greek culture came in contact with barbarian
theology. It is rarely possible to formulate satisfactory conclusions
with any degree of certainty, and before further discoveries are made we
shall frequently be compelled to weigh contrasting probabilities. We
must frequently throw out the sounding line into the shifting sea of
possibility in order to find secure anchorage. But at any rate we
perceive with sufficient distinctness the direction in which the
investigations must be pursued.

It is our belief that the main point to be cleared up is the composite
religion of those Jewish or Jewish-pagan communities, the worshipers of
Hypsistos, the Sabbatists, the Sabaziasts and others in which the new
creed took root during the apostolic age. In those communities the
Mosaic law had become adapted to the sacred usages of the Gentiles even
before the beginning of our era, and monotheism had made concessions to
idolatry. Many beliefs of the ancient Orient, as for instance the ideas
of Persian dualism regarding the infernal world, arrived in Europe by
two roads, the more or less orthodox Judaism of the communities of

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

the dispersion in which the gospel was accepted immediately, and the
pagan mysteries imported from Syria or Asia Minor. Certain similarities
that surprised and shocked the apologists will cease to look strange as
soon as we reach the distant sources of the channels that reunited at
Rome.

But these delicate and complicated researches into origins and
relationships belong especially to the history of the Alexandrian
period. In considering the Roman empire, the principal fact is that the
Oriental religions propagated doctrines, previous to and later side by
side with Christianity, that acquired with it universal authority at the
decline of the ancient world. The preaching of the Asiatic priests also
unwittingly prepared for the triumph of the church which put its stamp
on the work at which they had unconsciously labored.

Through their popular propaganda they had completely disintegrated the
ancient national faith of the Romans, while at the same time the Cæsars
had gradually destroyed the political particularism. After their advent
it was no longer necessary for religion to be connected with a state in
order to become universal. Religion was no longer regarded as a public
duty, but as a personal obligation; no longer did it subordinate the
individual to the city-state, but pretended above all to assure his
welfare in this world and especially in the world to come. The Oriental
mysteries offered their votaries radiant perspectives of eternal
happiness. Thus the focus of morality was changed. The aim became to
realize the sovereign good in the life hereafter instead of in this
world, as the Greek philosophy had done. No longer did man act in view
of tangible realities,

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

but to attain ideal hopes. Existence in this life was regarded as a
preparation for a sanctified life, as a trial whose outcome was to be
either everlasting happiness or everlasting pain.

As we see, the entire system of ethical values was overturned.

The salvation of the soul, which had become the one great human care,
was especially promised in these mysteries upon the accurate performance
of the sacred ceremonies. The rites possessed a power of purification
and redemption. They made man better and freed him from the dominion of
hostile spirits. Consequently, religion was a singularly important and
absorbing matter, and the liturgy could be performed only by a clergy
devoting itself entirely to the task. The Asiatic gods exacted undivided
service; their priests were no longer magistrates, scarcely citizens.
They devoted themselves unreservedly to their ministry, and demanded of
their adherents submission to their sacred authority.

All these features that we are but sketching here, gave the Oriental
religions a resemblance to Christianity, and the reader of these studies
will find many more points in common among them. These analogies are
even more striking to us than they were in those times because we have
become acquainted in India and China with religions very different from
the Roman paganism and from Christianity as well, and because the
relationships of the two latter strike us more strongly on account of
the contrast. These theological similarities did not attract the
attention of the ancients, because they scarcely conceived of the
existence of other possibilities, while differences were what they

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

remarked especially. I am not at all forgetting how considerable these
were. The principal divergence was that Christianity, by placing God in
an ideal sphere beyond the confines of this world, endeavored to rid
itself of every attachment to a frequently abject polytheism. But even
if we oppose tradition, we cannot break with the past that has formed
us, nor separate ourselves from the present in which we live. As the
religious history of the empire is studied more closely, the triumph of
the church will, in our opinion, appear more and more as the culmination
of a long evolution of beliefs. We can understand the Christianity of
the fifth century with its greatness and weaknesses, its spiritual
exaltation and its puerile superstitions, if we know the moral
antecedents of the world in which it developed. The faith of the friends
of Symmachus was much farther removed from the religious ideal of
Augustus, although they would never have admitted it, than that of their
opponents in the senate. I hope that these studies will succeed in
showing how the pagan religions from the Orient aided the long continued
effort of Roman society, contented for many centuries with a rather
insipid idolatry, toward more elevated and more profound forms of
worship. Possibly their credulous mysticism deserves as much blame as is
laid upon the theurgy of neo-Platonism, which drew from the same sources
of inspiration, but like neo-Platonism it has strengthened man's feeling
of eminent dignity by asserting the divine nature of the soul. By making
inner purity the main object of earthly existence, they refined and
exalted the psychic life and gave it an almost supernatural intensity,
which until then was unknown in the ancient world.
