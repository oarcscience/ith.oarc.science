# PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

IN this second edition the eight lectures forming the reading matter of
this book have suffered scarcely any change, and, excepting the chapter
on Syria, the additions are insignificant. It would have been an easy
matter to expand them, but I did not want these lectures to become
erudite dissertations, nor the ideas which are the essential part of a
sketch like the present to be overwhelmed by a multiplicity of facts. In
general I have therefore limited myself to weeding out certain errors
that were overlooked, or introduced, in the proofreading.

The notes, however, have been radically revised. I have endeavored to
give expression to the suggestions or observations communicated to me by
obliging readers: to mention new publications and to utilize the results
of my own studies. The index makes it easy to find the subjects
discussed.

And here I must again thank my friend Charles Michel, who undertook the
tedious task of rereading the proofs of this book, and whose scrupulous
and sagacious care has saved me from many and many a blunder.
