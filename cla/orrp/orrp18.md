# V. SYRIA.

BIBLIOGRAPHY: The Syrian religions have been studied with especial
attention to their relation with Judaism: Baudissin, *Studien zur
semitischen Religionsgeschichte*, 2 vols., Leipsic, 1876. The same
author has published veritable monographs on certain divinities
(Astarte, Baal, Sonne, etc.) in the *Realencyclopädie für Prot. Theol.*,
of Herzog-Hauck, 3d ed.--Bäthgen, *Beiträge sur semitischen
Religionsgeschichte, Berlin, 1888.--W. Robertson Smith, The Religion of
the Semites*, 2d ed., London, 1894.--Lagrange, *Etudes sur les religions
sémitiques*, 2d ed., Paris, 1905. The results of the excavations in
Palestine, which are important in regard to the funeral customs and the
oldest idolatry, have been summarized by Father Hugues Vincent, *Canaan
d'après l'exploration récente*, 1907.--On the propagation of the Syrian
religions in the Occident, see Réville, *op. cit.*, pp. 70 et Passim;

*Recueil d'archéologie orientale*, 8 vols., 1888, and in Dussaud, *Notes
de mythologie syrienne*, Paris, 1903. We have published a series of
articles on particular divinities in the *Realencyclopädie* of
Pauly-Wissowa (Baal, Balsamem, Dea Syria, Dolichenus, Gad, etc.). Other

important a part in its formation to the clergy of Emesa (see *infra*,

Lagrange, pp. 158-216; Vincent, op. cit., pp. 102-123; 144 f.--The power
of this Semitic litholatry equaled its persistence. Philo of Byblus
defined the bethels as Λιθοι ἔμψυχοι (2, §20, FHG, III, p. 563):
Hippolytus also tells us (V, I, P. 145, Cruice), that in the Syrian
mysteries (Ἀσσυρίων τελεταί) it was taught that the stones were animated
(οἱ λίθοι εἰσὶν ἕμψυχοι· ἐχουσι γὰρ τὸ αὑξητικόν), and the same doctrine
perpetuated itself in Manicheism. (Titus of Bostra, II, 60, p. 60, 25,
de Lagarde ed.:

Οὐκ αἰσχύνεται δὲ καὶ τοὺς λιθους ἑψυχῶσαι λέγων καὶ πάντα ἕμψυχα
εἰσηγούμενος).

During the last years of paganism the neo-Platonists developed a
superstitious worship of the bethels; see Conybeare, *Transactions of
the Congress of Hist. of Rel.*, Oxford, 1908, p. 177.

2241; W. Robertson Smith, p. 175.

<span id="xref_5_36">5\_36</span>. The ancient authors frequently
alluded to this superstition of the Syrians (the texts have been
collected by Selden, *De dis Syris, II*, C. 3, pp. 268 ff., ed. of
1672). W. Robertson Smith (*loc. cit.*, p. 449), is right in connecting
it with certain ideas of savages. Like many primitive beliefs, this one
has continued to the present day. It has been pointed out to me that at
Sam-Keuï, a little west of Doliché, there is a pond fed by a spring and
well stocked with fish, which one is forbidden to take. Near the mosque
of Edessa is a large pond where catching fish is prohibited. They are
considered sacred, and the people believe that any one who would eat
them would die instantly. (Sachau, *Reise in Syrien*, 1883, pp. 196 ff.
Cf. Lord Warkworth, *Diary in Asiatic Turkey*, London, 1898, p. 242).
The same is the case at the mosque of Tripoli and elsewhere (Lammens,
*Au pays des Nosaïris* \[*Revue de l'Orient chrétien*\], 1908, p. 2).
Even in Asia Minor this superstition is found. At Tavshanli, north of
Aezani on the upper Rhyndacus, there is to-day a square cistern filled
with sacred fish which no one is allowed to take (on the authority of
Munro). Travelers in Turkey have frequently observed that the people do
not eat fish, even when there is a scarcity of food (Sachau, *loc.
cit.*, p. 196) and the general belief that their flesh is unhealthful
and can cause sickness is not entirely unfounded. Here is what Ramsay
has to say on the subject (*Impressions of Turkey*, London, 1897, p.
288): "Fish are rarely found and when found are usually bad: the natives
have a prejudice against fish, and my own experience has been
unfavorable. . . . In the clear sparkling mountain stream that flows
through the Taurus by Bozanti-Khan, a small kind of fish is caught; I
had a most violent attack of sickness in 1891 after eating some of them,
and so had all who partook." Captain Wilson, who spent a number of years
in

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Asia Minor, asserts (*Handbook of Asia-Minor*,
p. 19), that "the natives do not eat fish to any extent." The "totemic"
prohibition in this instance really seems to have a hygienic origin.
People abstained from all kinds of fish because some species were
dangerous, that is to say, inhabited by evil spirits, and the tumors
sent by the Syrian goddess were merely the edemas caused by the
poisoning.

<span id="xref_5_37">5\_37</span>. On the Ἰχθύς symbolism I will merely
refer to Usener, *Sintflutsagen*, 1899, pp. 223 ff. Cf. S. Reinach,
*Cultes, mythes*, III, 1908, pp. 43 ff. An exhaustive book on this
subject has recently appeared: Dölger, ΙΧΘΥΖ, *das Fischsymbol in
frühchristlicher Zeit*, I, Rome, 1910.

On sacred repasts where fish was eaten see Mnaseas, fragment 32 (*Fragm.
histor. graec.*, III, 115); cf. Dittenberger, *Sylloge*, 584: Ἐὰν δέ τις
τῶν ἰχθύων ἀποθάνῃ, καρπούσθω, and Diog. Laert., VIII, 34. There were
also sacred repasts in the Occident in the various Syrian cults:
*Cenatorium et triclinium* in the temples of Jupiter Dolichenus (*CIL*,
III, 4789; VI, 30931; XI, 696, cf. *Mon. myst. Mithra*, II, p. 501);
*promulsidaria et mantelium* offered to the Venus Caelestis (*CIL*, X,
1590); construction of a temple to Malachbel with a *culina* (*CIL*,
III, 7954). Mention is made of a δειπνοκρίτης, δείπνοις κρείνας πολλὰ
μετ᾽ εὐφροσύνης, in the temple of the Janiculum (Gauckler, *C. R. Acad.
Inscr.*, 1907, p. 142; *Bolletino communale*, 1907, pp. 15 ff.). Cf.
Lagrange, *Religions sémitiques*, II, p. 609, and Pauly-Wissowa,
*Realenc.*, s. v. "Gad."

<span id="xref_5_38">5\_38</span>. W. Robertson Smith, pp. 292 ff.

<span id="xref_5_39">5\_39</span>. An inscription discovered at
Kefr-Hauar (Fossey, *Bull. corr., hell.*, 1897, p. 60) is very
characteristic in this respect. A "slave" of the Syrian goddess in that
inscription offers his homage to his "mistress" (κυρία).

<span id="xref_5_40">5\_40</span>. Notably at Aphaca where they were not
suppressed until the time of Constantine (Eusebius, *Vit. Const.*, III,
55; cf. Sozom., II, 5).

<span id="xref_5_41">5\_41</span>. Much has been written about the
sacred prostitutions in paganism, and it is well known that Voltaire
ridiculed the scholars who were credulous enough to believe in the tales
of Herodotus. But this practice has been proven by irrefutable

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

testimony. Strabo, for instance, whose great-uncle was arch-priest of
Comana, mentions it in connection with that city, (XII, 3, 36, p. 559
C), and he manifests no surprise. The history of religion teaches many
stranger facts; this one, however, is disconcerting. The attempt has
been made to see in it a relic of the primitive promiscuity or
polyandry, or a persistence of "sexual hospitality," ("No custom is more
widely spread than the providing for a guest a female companion, who is
usually a wife or daughter of the host," says Wake, *Serpent Worship*,
1888, p. 158); or the substitution of union with a man for union with
the god (Gruppe, *Griech. Mythol.*, p. 915). But these hypotheses do not
explain the peculiarities of the religious custom as it is described by
more reliable authors. They insist upon the fact that the girls were
dedicated to the temple service while *virgins*, and that after having
had *strangers* for lovers, they married in their own country. Thus
Strabo (XI, 14, § 16, p. 532 C.) narrates in connection with the temple
of Anaitïs in Acilisena, that θυγαρέρας οἱ ἐπιφανέστατοι τοῦ ἕθνους
ἀνιεροῦσι παρθένους, αῖ᾽ς νόμος ἐστὶ καταπορνευθείσαις πολὺν χρόνον παρὰ
τῇ θεῷ μετὰ δίδοσθαι πρὸς γάμον, οὑκ ἀπαξιοῦντος τῇ τοιαύτῃ συνοικεῖν
οὑδενός. Herodotus (I, 93), who relates about the same thing of the
Lydian women, adds that they acquired a dowry in that manner; an
inscription at Tralles (*Bull. corr. hell.*, VII, 1885, p. 276) actually
mentions a descendant of a sacred prostitute (ἐκ προγόνων παλλαικίδων)
who had temporarily filled the same office (παλλακεύσασα κατὰ χρησμὸν
Διί). Even at Thebes in Egypt there existed a similar custom with
striking local peculiarities in the time of Strabo (XVII, 1, § 46), and
traces of it seem to have been found in Greece among the Locrians
(Vurtheim, *De Aiacis origine*, Leyden, 1907). Every Algerian traveler
knows how the girls of the Ouled-Naïl earn their dowry in the *ksours*
and the cities, before they go back to their tribes to marry, and Doutté
(*Notes sur l'Islam maghrébien, les Marabouts*, Extr. *Rev. hist. des
relig.*, XL-XLI, Paris, 1900), has connected these usages with the old
Semitic prostitution, but his thesis has been attacked and the
historical circumstances of the arrival of the Ouled-Naïl in Algeria in
the eleventh century render it very doubtful (Note by Basset).--It seems
certain (I do not know whether this explanation has ever been offered)

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

that this strange practice is a modified utilitarian form of an ancient
exogamy. Besides it had certain favorable results, since it protected
the girl against the brutality of her kindred until she was of
marriageable age, and this fact must have insured its persistence; but
the idea that inspired it at first was different. "La première union
sexuelle impliquant une effusion de sang, a été interdite, lorsque ce
sang était celui d'une fille du clan versé par le fait d'un homme du
clan" (Salomon Reinach, *Mythes, cultes*, I, 1905, p. 79. Cf. Lang, *The
Secret of the Totem*, London, 1905.) Thence rose the obligation on
virgins to yield to a stranger first. Only then were they permitted to
marry a man of their own race. Furthermore, various means were resorted
to in order to save the husband from the defilement which might result
from that act (see for inst., Reinach, *Mythes, cultes*, I, p.
118).--The opinion expressed in this note was attacked, almost
immediately after its publication, by Frazer (*Adonis, Attis, Osiris*,
1907, pp. 50 ff.) who preferred to see in the sacred prostitutions a
relic of primitive communism. But at least one of the arguments which he
uses against our views is incorrect. Not the women, but the men,
received presents in Acilisena. (Strabo, *loc. cit.*) and the
communistic theory does not seem to account for the details of the
custom prevailing in the temple of Thebes. There the horror of blood
clearly appears. On the discovery of a skull (having served at a rite of
consecration) in the temple of the Janiculum, see the article cited
above, "Dea Syria," in *Dict. des antiquités*.

<span id="xref_5_43">5\_43</span>. Even in the regions where the cities
developed, the Baal and the Baalat always remained the divinities

epitaph that is unfortunately mutilated, but which seems to be that of
an adept of the pagan mysteries; see Nöldeke, *Zeitschrift für Assyr.*,
XXI, 1907, p. 155.

<span id="xref_5_46">5\_46</span>. On the Semitic notion of purity, W.
Robertson Smith has written admirably and convincingly (pp. 446 ff. and
*passim*). The question has been taken up from a different point of view
by Lagrange, pp. 141 ff.--The development of the notion of purity in the
ancient religions has been recently expounded by Farnell, *The Evolution
of Religion*, 1905, pp. 88 ff., especially pp. 124 ff. Cf. also *supra*,
[p. 91](orrp08.htm#page_91) f. An example of the prohibitions and
purifications is found in the Occident in an inscription, unfortunately
mutilated, discovered at Rome and dedicated to Beellefarus (*CIL*, VI,
30934, 31168; cf. Lafaye, *Rev. hist. relig.*, XVII, 1888, pp. 218 ff.;
Dessau, *Inscr. sel.*, 4343). If I have understood the text correctly it
commands those who have eaten pork to purify themselves by means of
honey.--On penances in the Syrian religions see ch. II, n.
 [2\_31](orrp15.htm#xref_2_31).

<span id="xref_5_47">5\_47</span>. M. Clermont-Ganneau (*Etudes
d'archéologie orientale*, IT, 1896, p. 104) states that the epithet
ἄγιος is extremely rare in pagan Hellenism, and almost always betrays a
Semitic influence. In such cases it corresponds to קרש. which to the
Semites is the epithet *par excellence* of the divinity. Thus Eshmon is
קרש; cf. Lidzbarski, *Ephemer für semit. Epigraph.*, II, p. 155;
Clermont-Ganneau, *Recueil d'archéol. orient.*, III, p. 330; V, p.

Some time ago I copied at a dealer's, a dedication engraved upon a lamp:

<span id="xref_5_48">5\_48</span>. As curious examples of Greco-Syrian
syncretism we may mention the bas-relief of Ed-Douwaïr in the Louvre,
which has been analyzed in detail by Dussaud (*Notes*, pp. 89 ff.), and
especially that of Horns in the Brussels museum (*ibid.*, 104 ff.).

<span id="xref_5_49">5\_49</span>. Macrobius, I, 23, § II: "Ritu Assyrio
magis quam Aegyptio colitur"; cf. Lucian, *De dea Syria*, 5.--"Hermetic"
theories penetrated even to the Sabians of Osrhoene (Reitzenstein,
Poimandres, 166 ff.), although their influence seems to have been merely
superficial (Bousset, *Göttingische gelehrt. Anzeigen*, 1905, 704
ff.--The existence of κάτοχοι at Baetocécé and elsewhere appears to be
due to Egyptian influence (Jalabert, *Mélanges de la fac. orient. de
Beyrouth*, II, 1907, pp. 308 ff.). The meaning of κάτοχος which has been
interpreted in different ways, is established, I think, by the passages
collected by Kroll, *Cat. codd. astrol. graec.*, V, pars 2, p. 146; cf.
Otto, *Priester und Tempel*, I, p. 119; Bouché-Leclercq, *Hist. des
Lagides*, IV, p. 335. It refers to the poor, the sick and even the
"illumined" living within the temple enclosures and undoubtedly
supported by the clergy, as were the refugees of the Christian period
who availed themselves of the right of sanctuary in the churches (cf.
*Comptes Rendus Acad. Inscr.*, 1907, p. 454).

\[*Philothesia für Paul Kleinert*\], 1907, pp. 5 ff.--See in general
Usener, *Dreiheit* (Extr. *Rhein. Museum*, LVIII), 1903, p. 32. The
triads continued in the theology of the "Chaldaic Oracles" (Kroll, *De
orac. Chald.*, 13 ff.) and a threefold division of the world and the
soul was taught in the "Assyrian mysteries" (*Archiv für
Religionswiss.*, IX, 1906, p. 331, n. 1).

<span id="xref_5_56">5\_56</span>. Boll, *Sphaera*, p. 372.--The
introduction of astrology into Egypt seems to date back no further than
the time of the Ptolemies.

<span id="xref_5_57">5\_57</span>. The Seleucides, like the Roman
emperors later, believed in Chaldean astrology (Appian., *Syr.*, 28;
Diodorus, II, 31, 2; cf. Riess in Pauly-Wissowa, *Realenc.*, s. v.
"Astrologie," col. 1814), and the kings of Commagene, as well as of a
great number of Syrian cities, had the signs of the zodiac as emblems on
their coins. It is even certain that this pseudoscience penetrated into
those regions long before the Hellenistic period. Traces of it are found
in the Old Testament (Schiaparelli; translation by Lüdke, *Die Astron.
im; Alten Testament*, 1904, p. 46). It modified the entire Semitic
paganism. The only cult which we know in any detail, that of the
Sabians, assigned the highest importance to it; but in the myths and
doctrines of the others its influence is no less apparent
(Pauly-Wissowa, *Realencycl.*, s. v. "Dea Syria," IV, col. 2241, and s.
v. "Gad"; cf. Baudissin, *Realencycl. für prot. Theol.*, s. v., "Sonne,"
pp. 510-520). To what extent, for instance, the clergy of Emesa had been
subjected to its ascendency is shown by the novel of Heliodorus, written
by a priest of that city (Rohde, *Griech. Roman*<sup>3</sup>, p. 464
\[436\]), and by the horoscope that put Julia Domna upon the throne
(*Vita Severi*, 3, 8; cf. A. von Domaszewski, *Archiv für Religionsw.*,
XI, 1909, p. 223). The irresistible influence extended even to the
Arabian paganism (Nöldeke in Hastings, *Encyclop. of Religion*, s. v.
"Arabs," I, p. 661; compare, *Orac. Sibyll.*, XIII, 64 ff., on Bostra).
The sidereal character which has been attributed to the Syrian gods, was
borrowed, but none the less real. From very early times the Semites
worshiped the sun,

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

the moon, and the stars (see Deut. iv. 19; job xxxi. 25), especially the
planet Venus, but this cult was of secondary importance only (see W.
Robertson Smith, *op. cit.*, p. 135, n. 1), although it grew in
proportion as the Babylonian influence became stronger. The polemics of
the Fathers of the Syrian Church show how considerable its prestige was
in the Christian era (cf. Ephrem, *Opera Syriaca*, Rome, 1740, II, pp.
447 ff.; the "Assyrian" Tatian, c. 9 ff., etc.).

Bel: Clermont-Ganneau, *Recueil d'arch. orient.*, VII, p. 12, 24, 364.
Cf. *supra*, n.  [5\_54](orrp18.htm#xref_5_54). The power of Palmyra
under Zenobia, who ruled from the Tigris to the Nile, must have had as a
corollary the establishment of an official worship that was necessarily
syncretic. Hence its special importance for the history of paganism.
Although the Babylonian astrology was a powerful factor in this worship,
Judaism seems to have had just as great an influence in its formation.
There was at Palmyra a large Jewish colony, which the writers of the
Talmud considered only tolerably orthodox (Chaps, *Gli Ebrei di Palmira*
\[*Rivista Israelitica*, I\], Florence, 1904, pp. 171 ff., 238 f. Cf.
"Palmyra" in the *Jewish Encycl.*; Jewish insc. of Palmyra; Euting,
*Sitzb. Berl. Acad.*, 1885, p. 669; Landauer, *ibid.*, 1884, pp. 933
ff.). This colony seems to have made compromises with the idolaters. On
the other hand we see Zenobia herself rebuilding a synagogue in Egypt
(*Revue archéol*ogique, XXX, 1875, p. iii; *Zeitschrift für Numismatik*,
V, p. 229; Dittenberger, *Orientis inscript.*, 729). This influence of
Judaism seems to explain the development at Palmyra of the cult of Ζεὺς
ὕψιστος καὶ ἐπήκοος, "he whose name is blessed in eternity." The name of
Hypsistos has been applied everywhere to Jehovah and to the pagan Zeus
(*supra*, [62](orrp07.htm#page_62), [128](orrp09.htm#page_128)) at the
same time. The text of Zosimus (I, 61), according to which Aurelian
brought from Palmyra to Rome the statues of Ἡλίου τε καὶ Βήλου (this has
been wrongly changed to read τοῦ καὶ Βήλου), proves that the

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

astrological religion of the great desert city recognized a supreme god
residing in the highest heavens, and a solar god, his visible image and
agent, according to the Semitic theology of the last period of paganism
(*supra*, [p. 134](orrp09.htm#page_134)).

<span id="xref_5_60">5\_60</span>. I have spoken of this solar
eschatology in the memorial cited *infra*, n.
 [5\_88](orrp18.htm#xref_5_88).

<span id="xref_5_61">5\_61</span>. This opinion is that of Posidonius
(see Wendland, *Philos Schrift über die Vorsehung*, Berlin, 1892, p. 68,
n. 1; 70, n. 2). It is shared by the ancient astrologers.

<span id="xref_5_62">5\_62</span>. This old pagan and gnostic idea has
continued to the present day in Syria among the
[Nosaïris](errata.htm#9); cf. Dussaud, *Histoire et religion des
Nosaïris*, 1900, p. 125.

<span id="xref_5_63">5\_63</span>. The belief that pious souls are
guided to heaven by a psychopompus, is found not only in the mysteries
of Mithra (*Mon. myst. Mithra*, I. p. 310), but also in the Syrian cults
where that rôle was often assigned to the solar god, see Isid. Lévy,
*Cultes syriens dans le Talmud* (*Revue des études juives*, XLIII),
1901, p. 5, and Dussaud, Notes, p. 27; cf. the Le Bas-Waddington
inscription, 24,42:

"Βασιλεῦ δέσποτα (= the sun), ἵλαθι καὶ δίδου πᾶσιν ἡμῖν ὑγίην καθαράν,
πρήξις ἀγαθὰς καὶ βίου τέλος ἐσθλόν."--

The same idea is found in inscriptions in the Occident; as for instance
in the peculiar epitaph of a sailor who died at Marseilles (Kaibel,
*Inscr. gr.*, XIV, 2462 = *Epigr.*, 650):

"Ἐν δέ \[τε\] τεθνιοῖσιν ὁμηγύρι \[ές\] γε πέλουσιν  
δοιαί · τῶν ἑτέρη μὲν ἐπιχθονίη πεφόρηται,  
ἡ δ᾽ ἑτέρη τείρεσσι σὺν αἱθερίοισι χορεύει,  
ἡς στρατιῆς εῖ᾽ς εἰμί, λαχῶν θεὸν ἡγεμονῆα."

It is the same term that Julian used (*Césars*, p. 336 C) in speaking of
Mithra, the guide of souls: ἡγεμόνα θεόν. Cf. also *infra*, n.
 [5\_66](orrp18.htm#xref_5_66) and ch. VIII, n.
 [8\_24](orrp21.htm#xref_8_24).

<span id="xref_5_64">5\_64</span>. The Babylonian origin of the doctrine
that the souls returned to heaven by crossing the seven planetary
spheres, has been maintained by Anz (*Zur Frage nach dem Ursprung des
Gnostizismus*, 1897; cf. *Mon. myst. Mithra*, I. pp. 38 ff., p. 309;
Bousset, *Die Himmelsreise der Seele* \[*Archiv für Religionsw.*, IV\],
1901, pp. 160 ff.) and "Gnosis" in Pauly-Wissowa, *Realencyclopädie*,
col. 1520. It has since been denied by Reitzenstein (*Poimandres*, p.
79; cf. Kroll, *Berl. philol. Wochensch.*,

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 1906, p. 486). But although it may have been
given its precise shape and been transformed by the Greeks and even by
the Egyptians, I persist in believing that it is of Chaldean and
religious origin. I heartily agree with the conclusions recently
formulated by Bousset, (*Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen*, 1905, pp. 707
ff.). We can go farther: Whatever roots it may have had in the
speculations of ancient Greece (Aristoph., *Pax*, 832, Plato, *Tim.*,
42B, cf. Haussoullier, *Rev. de philol.*, 1909, pp. 1 ff.), whatever
traces of it may be found in other nations (Dieterich,
*Mithrasliturgie*, pp. 182 ff.; *Nekyia*, p. 24, note; Rohde, *Psyche*,
II, p. 131, n. 3), the idea itself of the soul rising to the divine
stars after death certainly developed under the influence of the
sidereal worship of the Semites to a point where it dominated all other
eschatological theories. The belief in the eternity of souls is the
corollary to the belief in the eternity of the celestial gods ([p.
129](orrp09.htm#page_129)). We cannot give the history of this
conception here, and we shall limit ourselves to brief observations. The
first account of this system ever given at Rome is found in "Scipio's
Dream" (c. 3); it probably dates back to Posidonius of Apamea (cf.
Wendland, *Die hellenistisch-römische Kultur*, p. 85, 166, n. 3, 168, n.
1), and is completely impregnated with mysticism and astrolatry. The
same idea is found a little later in the astrologer Manilius (I, 758;
IV, 404, etc.). The shape which it assumed in Josephus (*Bell. Judaic.*,
V, 1, 5, §47) is also much more religious than philosophical and is
strikingly similar to a dogma of Islam (happiness in store for those
dying in battle; a Syrian \[*ibid.*, § 54\] risks his life that his soul
may go to heaven). This recalls the inscription of Antiochus of
Commagene (Michel, *Recueil*, No. 735, l. 40):

Σῶμα πρὸς οὐρανίους Διὸς Ὠρομάσδου θρόνους θεοφιλῆ ψυχὴν προπέμψαν εἰς
τὸν ἅπειρον αἰῶνα κοιμήσεται

It must be said that this sidereal immortality was not originally common
to all men; it was reserved "omnibus qui patriam conservaverint
adiuverint, auxerint" (*Somn. Scip.* c. 3, c. 8; cf. *Manil.*, I, 758;
Lucan, *Phars.*, IX, 1 ff.; Wendland, *op. cit.*, p. 85 n. 2), and this
also is in conformity with the oldest Oriental traditions. The rites
first used to assure immortality to kings and to make them the equals of
the gods were extended little by little as a kind of privilege, to the
important

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

persons of the state, and only very much later were they applied to all
who died.

Regarding the diffusion of this belief from the beginning of the first
century of our era, see Diels, *Elementum*, 1899, p. 73, cf. 78;
Badstübner, *Beiträge zur Erklärung Senecas*, Hamburg, pp. 2 ff.--It is
expressed in many inscriptions (Friedlander, *Sitteng.*, III, pp. 749
ff.; Rohde, *Psyche*, p. 673, cf. 610; epitaph of Vezir-Keupru, *Studia
Pontica*, No. 85; *CIL*. III (Salone), 6384; *supra*, n.
 [5\_63](orrp18.htm#xref_5_63), etc.) It gained access into Judaism and
paganism simultaneously (cf. Bousset, *Die Religion des Judentums im,
neutest. Zeitalter*, 1903, p. 271, and, for Philo of Alexandria, Zeller,
*Philos. der Griechen*, V, p. 397 and p. 297).--During the third century
it was expounded by Cornelius Labeo, the source of Arnobius and Servius
(Nieggetiet, *De Cornelio Labeone* \[Diss. Munster\], 1908, pp. 77-86).
It was generally accepted towards the end of the empire; see *infra*, n.
 [5\_25](orrp18.htm#xref_5_25).--I hope soon to have the opportunity of
setting forth the development of this sidereal eschatology with greater
precision in my lectures on "Astrology and Religion in Antiquity" which
will appear in 1912 (chap. VI).

<span id="xref_5_65">5\_65</span>. According to the doctrine of the
Egyptian mysteries the Elysian Fields were in the under-world (Apul.,
*Metam.*, XI, 6).--According to the astrological theory, the Elysian
Fields were in the sphere of the fixed stars (Macrobius, *Comm. somn.
Scip.*, I, 11, § 8; cf. *infra*, chap. VIII, n.
 [8\_25](orrp21.htm#xref_8_25)). Others placed them in the moon
(Servius, Ad *Aen.*, VI, 887; cf. Norden, *Vergils Buch* VI, p. 23;
Rohde, *Psyche*, pp. 609 ff.). Iamblichus placed them between the moon
and the sun (Lydus, *De mens.*, IV, 149, p. 167, 23, Wünsch).

<span id="xref_5_66">5\_66</span>. The relation between the two ideas is
apparent in the alleged account of the Pythagorean doctrine which
Diogenes Laertius took from Alexander Polyhistor, and which is in
reality an apocryphal composition of the first century of our era. It
was said that Hermes guided the pure souls, after their separation from
the body, εἰς τὸν Ὕψιστον (Diog. Laert., VIII, §31; cf. Zeller, *Philos.
der Griechen*, V, p. 106, n. 2).--On the meaning of Hypsistos, cf.
*supra*, [p. 128](orrp09.htm#page_128). It appears very plainly in the
passage of Isaiah, xiv, 13, as rendered by the Septuagint:

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

Εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀναβήσομαι, ἐπάνω τῶν ἀστέρων θήσω τὸν θρόνον μου . . .
ἐσομαι ὅμοιος τῷ Ὑψίστῳ.

<span id="xref_5_67">5\_67</span>. Originally he was the thunder-god, in
Greek Κεραυνός. Under this name he appeared for instance on the
bas-relief preserved in the museum of Brussels (Dussaud, *Notes*, p.
105). Later, by a familiar process, the influence of a particular god
becomes the attribute of a greater divinity, and we speak of a Ζεὺς
Κεραύνιος (cf. Usener, *Keraunos*, Rhein. Museum, N. F., LX,
1901).--This Zeus Keraunios appears in many inscriptions of Syria
(*CIG*, 4501, 4520; Le Bas-Waddington, 2195, 2557 a, 2631, 2739; cf.
Roscher, *Lexikon Myth.*, s. v. "Keraunos").

He is the god to whom Seleucus sacrificed when founding Seleucia
(Malalas, p. 199), and a dedication to the same god has been found
recently in the temple of the Syrian divinities at Rome (*supra*, n.
 [5\_10](orrp18.htm#xref_5_10)).--An equivalent of the Zeus Keraunios is
the Zeus Καταιβάτης--"he who descends in the lightning"--worshiped at
Cyrrhus (Wroth, *Greek Coins in the British Museum*: "Galatia, Syria,"
p. 52 and LII; Roscher, *Lexikon*, s. v.)

<span id="xref_5_68">5\_68</span>. For instance the double ax was
carried by Jupiter Dolichenus (cf. *supra*, [p.
147](orrp10.htm#page_147)). On its significance, cf. Usener, *loc.
cit.*, p. 20.

<span id="xref_5_69">5\_69</span>. Cf. Lidzbarski, Balsamem, *Ephem.
semit. Epigr.*, I, p. 251.--Ba’al Samain is mentioned as early as the
ninth century B. C. in the inscription of Ben Hadad (Pognon, *Inscr.
sémit.*, 1907, pp. 165 ff.; cf. Dussaud, *Rev. archéol.*, 1908, I, p.
235). In Aramaic papyri preserved at Berlin, the Jews of Elephantine
call Jehovah "the god of heaven" in an address to a Persian governor,
and the same name was used in the alleged edicts of Cyrus and his
successors, which were inserted in the book of Esdras (i. I; vi. 9,
etc.)--If there were the slightest doubt as to the identity of the god
of thunder with Baalsamin, it would be dispelled by the inscription of
Et-Tayibé, where this Semitic name is translated into Greek as Ζεὺς
μέγιστος κεραύνιος; cf. Lidzbarski, *Handbuch*, p. 477, and Lagrange,
*op. cit.*, p. 508.

<span id="xref_5_72">5\_72</span>. All these qualities ascribed to the
Baals by astrological paganism (ὕψιστος, παντοκράτωρ, etc.), are also
the attributes which, according to the doctrine of Alexandrian Judaism,
characterized Jehovah (see *supra*, n.  [5\_66](orrp18.htm#xref_5_66)).
If he was originally a god of thunder, as has been maintained, the
evolution of the Jewish theology was parallel to that of the pagan
conceptions (see *supra*, n.  [5\_69](orrp18.htm#xref_5_69)).

ff.; Pauly-Wissowa, s. v. "Aeternus," and *Festschrift für Otto
Benndorf*, 1898, p. 291.--The idea of the eternity of the gods also
appeared very early in Egypt, but it does not seem that the mysteries of
Isis--in which the death of Osiris was commemorated--made it prominent,
and it certainly was spread in the Occident only by the sidereal cults.

<span id="xref_5_80">5\_80</span>. The question has been raised whether
the epithet מרא עלמא means "lord of the world" or "lord of eternity"
(cf. Lidzbarski, *Ephemeris*, I, 258; II, 297; Lagrange, p. 508), but in
our opinion the controversy is to no purpose, since in the spirit of the
Syrian priests the two ideas are inseparable and one expression in
itself embraces both, the world being conceived as eternal (*supra*, n.
 [5\_76](orrp18.htm#xref_5_76)). See for Egypt, Horapoll.,
*Hieroglyph.*, I (serpent as symbol of the αἰών, and κόσμος). At
Palmyra, too, the title "lord of all" is found, מרא כל (Lidzbarski,
*loc. cit.*); cf. Julian, *Or.*, IV, p. 203, 5 (Hertlein): Ὁ βασιλεὺσ
τῶν ὅλων, and *infra*, n.  [5\_81](orrp18.htm#xref_5_81); n.
 [5\_87](orrp18.htm#xref_5_87). Already at Babylon the title "lord of
the universe" was given to Shamash and Hadad; see Jastrow, *Religion
Babyloniens*, I, p. 254, n. 10. Nöldeke has been good enough to write me
as follows on this subject. "Daran kan kein Zweifel sein, dass עלם
zunächst (lange Zeit) Ewigkeit heisst, und dass die Bedeutung 'Welt'
secundär ist. Ich halte es daher für so gut wie gewiss dass das
palmyrenische מרא עלמא, wenn es ein alter Name ist, den 'ewigen' Herrn
bedeutet, wie ohne Zweifel אל עולם, Gen., xxi. 33. Das biblische
Hebräisch kennt die Bedeutung 'Welt' noch nicht, abgesehen wohl von der
späten Stelle, Eccl. iii. 11. Und, so viel ich sehe, ist im
Palmyrenischen sonst עלמא immer 'Ewigkeit,' z. B. in der häufigen
Redensart לברידּ שמה לעלמא. Aber das daneben vorkommende palmyr. מרא כל
führt allerdings darauf, dass die palmyrenische Inschrift auch in מלא
עלמא den 'Herrn der Welt' sah. Ja der syrische Uebersetzer sieht auch in
jenem hebräschen אל עולם 'den Gott der Welt! Das Syrische hat nämlich
einen formalen Unterschied festgestellt zwischen *‘ālăm*, dem Status
absolutus, 'Ewigkeit,' und ‘ālmā \[āl<sup>e</sup>mā\] dem Status
emphaticus 'Welt.'--Sollte übrigens die

\[paragraph continues\] Bedeutung Welt diesem Worte erst durch Einfluss
griechischer Speculation zu Teil geworden sein? In der
Zingirli-Inschrift bedeuted בעלם noch bloss 'in seiner Zeit.'"

<span id="xref_5_81">5\_81</span>. Cf. *CIL*, III, 1090 = Dessau,
*Inscr.*, 2998: "Divinarum humanarumque rerum rectori." Compare *ibid.*,
2999 and Cagnet, *Année épigr.*, 1905, No. 235: "I. O. M., id est
universitatis principi." Cf. the article of the *Archiv* cited, n. 73.
The *Asclepius* says (c. 39), using an astrological term: "Caelestes dii
catholicorum dominantur, terreni incolunt singula."

<span id="xref_5_82">5\_82</span>. Cf. W. Robertson Smith, 75 ff.,
*passim*. In the Syrian religions as in that of Mithra, the initiates
regarded each other as members of the same family, and the phrase "dear
brethren" as used by our preachers, was already in use among the
votaries of Jupiter Dolichenus (*fratres carissimos*, *CIL*, VI, 406 =
30758).

<span id="xref_5_83">5\_83</span>. Renan mentioned this fact in his
*Apotres*, p. 297 = *Journal Asiatique*, 1859, p. 259. Cf. Jalabert,
*Mél. faculté orient. Beyrout*, I, 1906, p. 146.

<span id="xref_5_84">5\_84</span>. This is the term (*virtutes*) used by
the pagans. See the inscription *Numini et virtutibus dei aeterni* as
reconstructed in *Revue de Philologie*, 1902, p. 9; *Archiv für
Religionsw.*, *loc. cit.*, p. 335, n. 1 and *infra*, ch. VIII, n.
 [8\_20](orrp21.htm#xref_8_20).

<span id="xref_5_85">5\_85</span>. *CIL*, VII, 759 = Bücheler, *Carm.
epig.*, 24.--Cf. Lucian, *De dea Syria*, 32.

<span id="xref_5_86">5\_86</span>. Macrobius, *Sat.*, I, 23, § 17:
"Nominis (Adad) interpretatio significat unus unus."

<span id="xref_5_87">5\_87</span>. Cicero, *Somnium Scip.*, c. 4: "Sol
dux et princeps et moderator luminum reliquorum, mens mundi et
temperatio." Pliny, *H. N.*, II, 6, § 12: "Sol . . . . siderum ipsorum
caelique rector. Hunc esse mundi totius animam ac planius mentem, hunc
principale naturae regimen ac numen credere decet," etc. Julian of
Laodicea, *Cat. codd. astr.*, I, p. 136, l. 1:

Ἥλιος βασιλεὺς καὶ ἡγεμὼν το̃ σύμπαντος κόσμου καθεστώς, πάντων
καθηγούμενος καὶ πάντων ὣν γενεσιάρχης.

<span id="xref_5_88">5\_88</span>. We are here recapitulating some
conclusions of a study on *La théologie solaire du paganisme romain*
published in *Mémoires des savants étrangers présentés a l'Acad. des
Inscr.*, XII, 2d part, pp. 447 ff., Paris, 1910.

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

<span id="xref_5_89">5\_89</span>. The hymns of Synesius (II, 10 ff.,
IV, 120 ff., etc.) contain peculiar examples of the combination of the
old astrological ideas with Christian theology.
