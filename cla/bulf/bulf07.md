# CHAPTER VIII.

## PYGMALION- DRYOPE- VENUS AND ADONIS- APOLLO AND

### HYACINTHUS.

PYGMALION saw so much to blame in women that he came at last to abhor
the sex, and resolved to live unmarried. He was a sculptor, and had made
with wonderful skill a statue of ivory, so beautiful that no living
woman came anywhere near it. It was indeed the perfect semblance of a
maiden that seemed to be alive, and only prevented from moving by
modesty. His art was so perfect that it concealed itself and its product
looked like the workmanship of nature. Pygmalion admired his own work,
and at last fell in love with the counterfeit creation. Oftentimes he
laid his hand upon it as if to assure himself whether it were living or
not, and could not even then believe that it was only ivory. He caressed
it, and gave it presents such as young girls love,- bright shells and
polished stones, little birds and flowers of various hues, beads and
amber. He put raiment on its limbs, and jewels on its fingers, and a
necklace about its neck. To the ears he hung earrings, and strings of
pearls upon the breast. Her dress became her, and she looked not less
charming than when unattired. He laid her on a couch spread with cloths
of Tyrian dye, and called her his wife, and put her head upon a pillow
of the softest feathers, as if she could enjoy their softness.

The festival of Venus was at hand- a festival celebrated with great pomp
at Cyprus. Victims were offered, the altars smoked, and the odour of
incense filled the air. When Pygmalion had performed his part in the
solemnities, he stood before the altar and timidly said, "Ye gods, who
can do all things, give me, I pray you, for my wife"- he dared not say
"my ivory virgin," but said instead- "one like my ivory virgin." Venus,
who was present at the festival, heard him and knew the thought he would
have uttered; and as an omen of her favour, caused the flame on the
altar to shoot up thrice in a fiery point into the air. When he returned
home, he went to see his statue, and leaning over the couch, gave a kiss
to the mouth. It seemed to be warm. He pressed its lips again, he laid
his hand upon the limbs; the ivory felt soft to his touch and yielded to
his fingers like the wax of Hymettus. While he stands astonished and
glad, though doubting, and fears he may be mistaken, again and again
with a lover's ardour he touches the object of his hopes. It was indeed
alive! The veins when pressed yielded to the finger and again resumed
their roundness. Then at last the votary of Venus found words to thank
the goddess, and pressed his lips upon lips as real as his own. The
virgin felt the kisses and blushed, and opening her timid eyes to the
light, fixed them at the same moment on her lover. Venus blessed the
nuptials she had formed, and from this union Paphos was born, from whom
the city, sacred to Venus, received its name.

Schiller, in his poem the "Ideals," applies this tale of Pygmalion to
the love of nature in a youthful heart. The following translation is
furnished by a friend:

          "As once with prayers in passion flowing,  
             Pygmalion embraced the stone,  
           Till from the frozen marble glowing,  
             The light of feeling o'er him shone,  
           So did I clasp with young devotion.  
             Bright nature to a poet's heart;  
           Till breath and warmth and vital motion  
             Seemed through the statue form to dart.  
          "And then, in all my ardour sharing,  
             The silent form expression found;  
           Returned my kiss of youth daring,  
             And understood my heart's quick sound.  
           Then lived for me the bright creation,  
             The silver rill with song was rife;  
           The trees, the roses shared sensation,  
             An echo of my boundless life."- S. G. B.  

### DRYOPE.

Dryope and Iole were sisters. The former was the wife of Andraemon,
beloved by her husband, and happy in the birth of her first child. One
day the sisters strolled to the bank of a stream that sloped gradually
down to the water's edge, while the upland was overgrown with myrtles.
They were intending to gather flowers for forming garlands for the
altars of the nymphs, and Dryope carried her child at her bosom,
precious burden, and nursed him as she walked. Near the water grew a
lotus plant, full of purple flowers. Dryope gathered some and offered
them to the baby, and Iole was about to do the same, when she perceived
blood dropping from the places where her sister had broken them off the
stem. The plant was no other than the nymph Lotis, who, running from a
base pursuer, had been changed into this form. This they learned from
the country people when it was too late.

Dryope, horror-struck when she perceived what she had done, would gladly
have hastened from the spot, but found her feet rooted to the ground.
She tried to pull them away, but moved nothing but her upper limbs. The
woodiness crept upward and by degrees invested her body. In anguish she
attempted to tear her hair, but found her hands filled with leaves. The
infant felt his mother's bosom begin to harden, and the milk cease to
flow. Iole looked on at the sad fate of her sister, and could render no
assistance. She embraced the growing trunk, as if she would hold back
the advancing wood, and would gladly have been enveloped in the same
bark. At this moment Andraemon, the husband of Dryope, with her father,
approached; and when they asked for Dryope, Iole pointed them to the
new-formed lotus. They embraced the trunk of the yet warm tree, and
showered their kisses on its leaves.

Now there was nothing left of Dryope but her face. Her tears still
flowed and fell on her leaves, and while she could she spoke. "I am not
guilty. I deserve not this fate. I have injured no one. If I speak
falsely, may my foliage perish with drought and my trunk be cut down and
burned. Take this infant and give it to a nurse. Let it often be brought
and nursed under my branches, and play in my shade; and when he is old
enough to talk, let him be taught to call me mother, and to say with
sadness, 'My mother lies hid under this bark.' But bid him be careful of
river banks, and beware how he plucks flowers, remembering that every
bush he sees may be a goddess in disguise. Farewell, dear husband, and
sister, and father. If you retain any love for me, let not the axe wound
me, nor the flocks bite and tear my branches. Since I cannot stoop to
you, climb up hither and kiss me; and while my lips continue to feel,
lift up my child that I may kiss him. I can speak no more, for already
the bark advances up my neck, and will soon shoot over me. You need not
close my eyes, the bark will close them without your aid." Then the lips
ceased to move, and life was extinct: but the branches retained for some
time longer the vital heat.

Keats, in "Endymion," alludes to Dryope thus:

          "She took a lute from which there pulsing came  
           A lively prelude, fashioning the way  
           In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay  
           More subtle-cadenced, more forest-wild  
           Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;" etc.  

### VENUS AND ADONIS

Venus, playing one day with her boy Cupid, wounded her bosom with one of
his arrows. She pushed him away, but the wound was deeper than she
thought. Before it healed she beheld Adonis, and was captivated with
him. She no longer took any interest in her favourite resorts- Paphos,
and Cnidos, and Amathos, rich in metals. She absented herself even from
heaven, for Adonis was dearer to her than heaven. Him she followed and
bore him company. She who used to love to recline in the shade, with no
care but to cultivate her charms, now rambles through the woods and over
the hills, dressed like the huntress Diana; and calls her dogs, and
chases hares and stags, or other game that it is safe to hunt, but keeps
clear of the wolves and bears, reeking with the slaughter of the herd.
She charged Adonis, too, to beware of such dangerous animals. "Be brave
towards the timid," said she; "courage against the courageous is not
safe. Beware how you expose yourself to danger and put my happiness to
risk. Attack not the beasts that Nature has armed with weapons. I do not
value your glory so high as to consent to purchase it by such exposure.
Your youth, and the beauty that charms Venus, will not touch the hearts
of lions and bristly boars. Think of their terrible claws and prodigious
strength! I hate the whole race of them. Do you ask me why?" Then she
told him the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes, who were changed into
lions for their ingratitude to her.

Having given him this warning, she mounted her chariot drawn by swans,
and drove away through the air. But Adonis was too noble to heed such
counsels. The dogs had roused a wild boar from his lair, and the youth
threw his spear and wounded the animal with sidelong stroke. The beast
drew out the weapon with his jaws, and rushed after Adonis, who turned
and ran; but the boar overtook him, and buried his tusks in his side,
and stretched him dying upon the plain.

Venus, in her swan-drawn chariot, had not yet reached Cyprus, when she
heard coming up through mid-air the groans of her beloved, and turned
her white-winged coursers back to earth. As she drew near and saw from
on high his lifeless body bathed in blood, she alighted and, bending
over it, beat her breast and tore her hair. Reproaching the Fates, she
said, "Yet theirs shall be but a partial triumph; memorials of my grief
shall endure, and the spectacle of your death, my Adonis, and of my
lamentation shall be annually renewed. Your blood shall be changed into
a flower; that consolation none can envy me." Thus speaking, she
sprinkled nectar on the blood; and as they mingled, bubbles rose as in a
pool on which raindrops fall, and in an hour's time there sprang up a
flower of bloody hue like that of the pomegranate. But it is
short-lived. It is said the wind blows the blossoms open, and afterwards
blows the petals away; so it is called Anemone, or Wind Flower, from the
cause which assists equally in its production and its decay.

Milton alludes to the story of Venus and Adonis in his "Comus":

            "Beds of hyacinth and roses  
             Where young Adonis oft reposes,  
             Waxing well of his deep wound  
             In slumber soft, and on the ground  
             Sadly sits th' Assyrian queen;" etc.  

### APOLLO AND HYACINTHUS.

Apollo was passionately fond of a youth named Hyacinthus. He.
accompanied him in his sports, carried the nets when he went fishing,
led the dogs when he went to hunt, followed him in his excursions in the
mountains, and neglected for him his lyre and his arrows. One day they
played a game of quoits together, and Apollo, heaving aloft the discus,
with strength mingled with skill, sent it high and far. Hyacinthus
watched it as it flew, and excited with the sport ran forward to seize
it, eager to make his throw, when the quoit bounded from the earth and
struck him in the forehead. He fainted and fell. The god, as pale as
himself, raised him and tried all his art to stanch the wound and retain
the flitting life, but all in vain; the hurt was past the power of
medicine. As when one has broken the stem of a lily in the garden it
hangs its head and turns its flowers to the earth, so the head of the
dying boy, as if too heavy for his neck, fell over on his shoulder.
"Thou diest, Hyacinth," so spoke Phoebus, "robbed of thy youth by me.
Thine is the suffering, mine the crime. Would that I could die for thee!
But since that may not be, thou shalt live with me in memory and in
song. My lyre shall celebrate thee, my song shall tell thy fate, and
thou shalt become a flower inscribed with my regrets." While Apollo
spoke, behold the blood which had flowed on the ground and stained the
herbage ceased to be blood; but a flower of hue more beautiful than the
Tyrian sprang up, resembling the lily, if it were not that this is
purple and that silvery white.\* And this was not enough for Phoebus;
but to confer still greater honour, he marked the petals with his
sorrow, and inscribed "Ah! ah!" upon them, as we see to this day. The
flower bears the name of Hyacinthus, and with every returning spring
revives the memory of his fate.

\* It is evidently not our modern hyacinth that is here described. It is
perhaps some species of iris, or perhaps of larkspur or pansy.

It was said that Zephyrus (the West wind), who was also fond of
Hyacinthus and jealous of his preference of Apollo, blew the quoit out
of its course to make it strike Hyacinthus. Keats alludes to this in his
"Endymion," where he describes the lookers-on at the game of quoits:

          "Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent  
             On either side, pitying the sad death  
             Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath  
           Of Zephyr slew him; Zephyr penitent,  
           Who now ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,  
             Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain."  

An allusion to Hyacinthus will also be recognized in Milton's "Lycidas":

        "Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe."
