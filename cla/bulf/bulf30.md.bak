# CHAPTER XXXI.

## ADVENTURES OF AENEAS- THE HARPIES- DIDO- PALINURIUS.

### ADVENTURES OF AENEAS.

WE have followed one of the Grecian heroes, Ulysses, in his wanderings
on his return home from Troy, and now we propose to share the fortunes
of the remnant of the conquered people, under their chief AEneas, in
their search for a new home, after the ruin of their native city. On
that fatal night when the wooden horse disgorged its contents of armed
men, and the capture and conflagration of the city were the result,
AEneas made his escape from the scene of destruction, with his father,
and his wife, and young son. The father, Anchises, was too old to walk
with the speed required, and AEneas took him upon his shoulders.\* Thus
burdened, leading his son and followed by his wife, he made the best of
his way out of the burning city; but, in the confusion, his wife was
swept away and lost.

\* See Proverbial Expressions, no. 9.

On arriving at the place of rendezvous, numerous fugitives, of both
sexes, were found, who put themselves under the guidance of AEneas. Some
months were spent in preparation, and at length they embarked. They
first landed on the neighboring shores of Thrace, and were preparing to
build a city, but AEneas was deterred by a prodigy. Preparing to offer
sacrifice, he tore some twigs from one of the bushes. To his dismay the
wounded part dropped blood. When he repeated the act a voice from the
ground cried out to him, "Spare me, AEneas; I am your kinsman, Polydore,
here murdered with many arrows, from which a bush has grown, nourished
with my blood." These words recalled to the recollection of AEneas that
Polydore was a young prince of Troy, whom his father had sent with ample
treasures to the neighbouring land of Thrace, to be there brought up, at
a distance from the horrors of war. The king to whom he was sent had
murdered him and seized his treasures. AEneas and his companions,
considering the land accursed by the stain of such a crime, hastened
away.

They next landed on the island of Delos, which was once a floating
island, till Jupiter fastened it by adamantine chains to the bottom of
the sea. Apollo and Diana were born there, and the island was sacred to
Apollo. Here AEneas consulted the oracle of Apollo, and received an
answer, ambiguous as usual,- "Seek your ancient mother; there the race
of AEneas shall dwell, and reduce all other nations to their sway." The
Trojans heard with joy and immediately began to ask one another, "Where
is the spot intended by the oracle?" Anchises remembered that there was
a tradition that their forefathers came from Crete and thither they
resolved to steer. They arrived at Crete and began to build their city,
but sickness broke out among them, and the fields that they had planted
failed to yield a crop. In this gloomy aspect of affairs AEneas was
warned in a dream to leave the country and seek a western land, called
Hesperia, whence Dardanus, the true founder of the Trojan race, had
originally migrated. To Hesperia, now called Italy, therefore, they
directed their future course, and not till after many adventures and the
lapse of time sufficient to carry a modern navigator several times round
the world, did they arrive there.

Their first landing was at the island of the Harpies. These were
disgusting birds with the heads of maidens, with long claws and faces
pale with hunger. They were sent by the gods to torment a certain
Phineus, whom Jupiter had deprived of his sight, in punishment of his
cruelty; and whenever a meal was placed before him the Harpies darted
down from the air and carried it off. They were driven away from Phineus
by the heroes of the Argonautic expedition, and took refuge in the
island where AEneas now found them.

When they entered the port the Trojans saw herds of cattle roaming over
the plain. They slew as many as they wished and prepared for a feast.
But no sooner had they seated themselves at the table than a horrible
clamour was heard in the air, and a flock of these odious harpies came
rushing down upon them, seizing in their talons the meat from the dishes
and flying away with it. AEneas and his companions drew their swords and
dealt vigorous blows among the monsters, but to no purpose, for they
were so nimble it was almost impossible to hit them, and their feathers
were like armour impenetrable to steel. One of them, perched on a
neighbouring cliff, screamed out, "Is it thus, Trojans, you treat us
innocent birds, first slaughter our cattle and then make war on
ourselves?" She then predicted dire sufferings to them in their future
course, and having vented her wrath flew away. The Trojans made haste to
leave the country, and next found themselves coasting along the shore of
Epirus. Here they landed, and to their astonishment learned that certain
Trojan exiles, who had been carried there as prisoners, had become
rulers of the country. Andromache, the widow of Hector, became the wife
of one of the victorious Grecian chiefs, to whom she bore a son. Her
husband dying, she was left regent of the country, as guardian of her
son, and had married a fellow-captive, Helenus, of the royal race of
Troy. Helenus and Andromache treated the exiles with the utmost
hospitality, and dismissed them loaded with gifts.

From hence AEneas coasted along the shore of Sicily and passed the
country of the Cyclopses. Here they were hailed from the shore by a
miserable object, whom by his garments, tattered as they were, they
perceived to be a Greek. He told them he was one of Ulysses' companions,
left behind by that chief in his hurried departure. He related the story
of Ulysses' adventure with Polyphemus, and besought them to take him off
with them as he had no means of sustaining his existence where he was
but wild berries and roots, and lived in constant fear of the Cyclopses,
While he spoke Polyphemus made his appearance; "a terrible monster,
shapeless, vast, whose only eye had been put out."\* He walked with
cautious steps, feeling his way with a staff, down to the seaside, to
wash his eye-socket in the waves. When he reached the water, he waded
out towards them, and his immense height enabled him to advance far into
the sea, so that the Trojans, in terror, took to their oars to get out
of his way. Hearing the oars, Polyphemus shouted after them, so that the
shores resounded, and at the noise the other Cyclopses came forth from
their caves and woods and lined the shore, like a row of lofty pine
trees. The Trojans plied their oars and soon left them out of sight.

\* See Proverbial Expressions, no. 10.

AEneas had been cautioned by Helenus to avoid the strait guarded by the
monsters Scylla and Charybdis. There Ulysses, the reader will remember,
had lost six of his men, seized by Scylla while the navigators were
wholly intent upon avoiding Charybdis. AEneas, following the advice of
Helenus, shunned the dangerous pass and coasted along the island of
Sicily.

Juno, seeing the Trojans speeding their way prosperously towards their
destined shore, felt her old grudge against them revive, for she could
not forget the slight that Paris had put upon her, in awarding the prize
of beauty to another. "In heavenly minds can such resentments dwell!"\*
Accordingly she hastened to AEolus, the ruler of the winds,- the same
who supplied Ulysses with favouring gales, giving him the contrary ones
tied up in a bag AEolus obeyed the goddess and sent forth his sons,
Boreas, Typhon, and the other winds, to toss the ocean. A terrible storm
ensued and the Trojan ships were driven out of their course towards the
coast of Africa. They were in imminent danger of being wrecked, and were
separated, so that AEneas thought that all were lost except his own.

\* See Proverbial Expressions no. 11.

At this crisis, Neptune, hearing the storm raging, and knowing that he
had given no orders for one. raised his head above the waves, and saw
the fleet of AEneas driving before the gale. Knowing the hostility of
Juno, he was at no loss to account for it, but his anger was not the
less at this interference in his province. He called the winds and
dismissed them with a severe reprimand. He then soothed the waves, and
brushed away the clouds from before the face of the sun. Some of the
ships which had got on the rocks he prised off with his own trident,
while Triton and a sea-nymph, putting their shoulders under others, set
them afloat again. The Trojans, when the sea became calm, sought the
nearest shore, which was the coast of Carthage, where AEneas was so
happy as to find that one by one the ships all arrived safe, though
badly shaken.

Waller, in his "Panegyric to the Lord Protector" (Cromwell), alludes to
this stilling of the storm by Neptune:

          "Above the waves, as Neptune showed his face,  
           To chide the winds and save the Trojan race,  
           So has your Highness, raised above the rest,  
           Storms of ambition tossing us repressed."  

### DIDO.

Carthage, where the exiles had now arrived, was a spot on the coast of
Africa opposite Sicily, where at that time a Tyrian colony under Dido,
their queen, were laying the foundations of a state destined in later
ages to be the rival of Rome itself. Dido was the daughter of Belus,
king of Tyre, and sister of Pygmalion, who succeeded his father on the
throne. Her husband was Sichaeus, a man of immense wealth, but
Pygmalion, who coveted his treasures, caused him to be put to death.
Dido, with a numerous body of friends and followers, both men and women,
succeeded in effecting their escape from Tyre, in several vessels,
carrying with them the treasures of Sichaeus. On arriving at the spot
which they selected as the seat of their future home, they asked of the
natives only so much land as they could enclose with a bull's hide. When
this was readily granted, she caused the hide to be cut into strips, and
with them enclosed a spot on which she built a citadel, and called it
Byrsa (a hide). Around this fort the city of Carthage rose, and soon
became a powerful and flourishing place.

Such was the state of affairs when AEneas with his Trojans arrived
there. Dido received the illustrious exiles with friendliness and
hospitality. "Not unacquainted with distress," she said, "I have learned
to succour the unfortunate."\* The queen's hospitality displayed itself
in festivities at which games of strength and skill were exhibited. The
strangers contended for the palm with her own subjects, on equal terms,
the queen declaring that whether the victor were "Trojan or Tyrian
should make no difference to her."\*(2) At the feast which followed the
games, AEneas gave at her request a recital of the closing events of the
Trojan history and his own adventures after the fall of the city. Dido
was charmed with his discourse and filled with admiration of his
exploits. She conceived an ardent passion for him, and he for his part
seemed well content to accept the fortunate chance which appeared to
offer him at once a happy termination of his wanderings, a home, a
kingdom, and a bride. Months rolled away in the enjoyment of pleasant
intercourse, and it seemed as if Italy and the empire destined to be
founded on its shores were alike forgotten. Seeing which, Jupiter
despatched Mercury with a message to AEneas recalling him to a sense of
his high destiny, and commanding him to resume his voyage.

\*(2) See Proverbial Expressions, no. 13.

AEneas parted from Dido, though she tried every allurement and
persuasion to detain him. The blow to her affection and her pride was
too much for her to endure, and when she found that he was gone, she
mounted a funeral pile which she had caused to be erected, and having
stabbed herself was consumed with the pile. The flames rising over the
city were seen by the departing Trojans, and, though the cause was
unknown, gave to AEneas some intimation of the fatal event.

The following epigram we find in "Elegant Extracts":

### FROM THE LATIN.

            "Unhappy, Dido, was thy fate  
             In first and second married state!  
             One husband caused thy flight by dying,  
             Thy death the other caused by flying."  

### PALINURUS.

After touching at the island of Sicily, where Acestes, a prince of
Trojan lineage, bore sway, who gave them a hospitable reception, the
Trojans re-embarked, and held on their course for Italy. Venus now
interceded with Neptune to allow her son at last to attain the
wished-for goal and find an end of his perils on the deep. Neptune
consented, stipulating only for one life as a ransom for the rest. The
victim was Palinurus, the pilot. As he sat watching the stars, with his
hand on the helm, Somnus sent by Neptune approached in the guise of
Phorbas and said: "Palinurus, the breeze is fair, the water smooth, and
the ship sails steadily on her course. Lie down awhile and take needful
rest. I will stand at the helm in your place." Palinurus replied, "Tell
me not of smooth seas or favouring winds,- me who have seen so much of
their treachery. Shall I trust AEneas to the chances of the weather and
the winds?" And he continued to grasp the helm and to keep his eyes
fixed on the stars. But Somnus waved over him a branch moistened with
Lethaean dew, and his eyes closed in spite of all his efforts. Then
Somnus pushed him overboard and he fell: but keeping his hold upon the
helm, it came away with him. Neptune was mindful of his promise and kept
the ship on her track without helm or pilot, till AEneas discovered his
loss, and, sorrowing deeply for his faithful steersman, took charge of
the ship himself.

There is a beautiful allusion to the story of Palinurus in Scott's
"Marmion," Introduction to Canto I., where the poet, speaking of the
recent death of William Pitt, says:

          "O, think how, to his latest day,  
           When death just hovering claimed his prey,  
           With Palinure's unaltered mood,  
           Firm at his dangerous post he stood;  
           Each call for needful rest repelled,  
           With dying hand the rudder held,  
           Till in his fall, with fateful sway,  
           The steerage of the realm gave way."  

The ships at last reached the shores of Italy, and joyfully did the
adventurers leap to land. While his people were employed in making their
encampment AEneas sought the abode of the Sibyl. It was a cave connected
with a temple and grove, sacred to Apollo and Diana. While AEneas
contemplated the scene, the Sibyl accosted him. She seemed to know his
errand, and under the influence of the deity of the place, burst forth
in a prophetic strain, giving dark intimations of labours and perils
through which he was destined to make his way to final success. She
closed with the encouraging words which have become proverbial: "Yield
not to disasters, but press onward the more bravely."\* AEneas replied
that he had prepared himself for whatever might await him. He had but
one request to make. Having been directed in a dream to seek the abode
of the dead in order to confer with his father, Anchises, to receive
from him a revelation of his future fortunes and those of his race, he
asked her assistance to enable him to accomplish the task. The Sibyl
replied, "The descent to Avernus is easy: the gate of Pluto stands open
night and day; but to retrace one's steps and return to the upper air,
that is the toil, that the difficulty."\*(2) She instructed him to seek
in the forest a tree on which grew a golden branch. This branch was to
be plucked off and borne as a gift to Proserpine, and if fate was
propitious it would yield to the hand and quit its parent trunk, but
otherwise no force could rend it away. If torn away, another would
succeed.\*(3)

AEneas followed the directions of the Sibyl. His mother, Venus, sent two
of her doves to fly before him and show him the way, and by their
assistance he found the tree, plucked the branch, and hastened back with
it to the Sibyl.
