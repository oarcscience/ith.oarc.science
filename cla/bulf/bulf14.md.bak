# CHAPTER XV.

## THE GRAEAE AND GORGONS- PERSEUS- MEDUSA- ATLAS-

### ANDROMEDA.

### THE GRAEAE AND GORGONS.

THE Graeae were three sisters who were gray-haired from their birth,
whence their name. The Gorgons were monstrous females with huge teeth
like those of swine, brazen claws, and snaky hair. None of these beings
make much figure in mythology except Medusa, the Gorgon, whose story we
shall next advert to. We mention them chiefly to introduce an ingenious
theory of some modern writers, namely, that the Gorgons and Graeae were
only personifications of the terrors of the sea, the former denoting the
strong billows of the wide open main, and the latter the white-crested
waves that dash against the rocks of the coast. Their names in Greek
signify the above epithets.

### PERSEUS AND MEDUSA.

Perseus was the son of Jupiter and Danae. His grandfather Acrisius,
alarmed by an oracle which had told him that his daughter's child would
be the instrument of his death, caused the mother and child to be shut
up in a chest and set adrift on the sea. The chest floated towards
Seriphus, where it was found by a fisherman who conveyed the mother and
infant to Polydectes, the king of the country, by whom they were treated
with kindness. When Perseus was grown up Polydectes sent him to attempt
the conquest of Medusa, a terrible monster who had laid waste the
country. She was once a beautiful maiden whose hair was her chief glory
but as she dared to vie in beauty with Minerva, the goddess deprived her
of her charms and changed her beautiful ringlets into hissing serpents.
She became a cruel monster of so frightful an aspect that no living
thing could behold her without being turned into stone. All around the
cavern where she dwelt might be seen the stony figures of men and
animals which had chanced to catch a glimpse of her and had been
petrified with the sight. Perseus, favoured by Minerva and Mercury, the
former of whom lent him her shield and the latter his winged shoes,
approached Medusa while she slept and taking care not to look directly
at her, but guided by her image reflected in the bright shield which he
bore, he cut off her head and gave it to Minerva, who fixed it in the
middle of her AEgis.

Milton, in his "Comus," thus alludes to the AEgis:

        "What thus snaky-headed Gorgon-shield  
         That wise Minerva wore, unconquered virgin,  
         Wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone,  
         But rigid looks of chaste austerity,  
         And noble grace that dashed brute violence  
         With sudden adoration and blank awe!"  

Armstrong, the poet of the "Art of Preserving Health," thus describes
the effect of frost upon the waters:

        "Now blows the surly North and chills throughout  
         The stiffening regions, while by stronger charms  
         Than Circe e'er or fell Medea brewed,  
         Each brook that wont to prattle to its banks  
         Lies all bestilled and wedged betwixt its banks,  
         Nor moves the withered reeds...  
         The surges baited by the fierce North-east,  
         Tossing with fretful spleen their angry heads,  
         E'en in the foam of all their madness struck  
         To monumental ice.  

### . . . . . . . .

                                       Such execution,  
         So stern, so sudden, wrought the grisly aspect  
         Of terrible Medusa,  
         When wandering through the woods she turned to stone  
         Their savage tenants; just as the foaming Lion  
         Sprang furious on his prey, her speedier power  
         Outran his haste,  
         And fixed in that fierce attitude he stands  
         Like Rage in marble!"- Imitations of Shakespeare.  

### PERSEUS AND ATLAS.

After the slaughter of Medusa, Perseus, bearing with him the head of the
Gorgon, flew far and wide, over land and sea. As night came on, he
reached the western limit of the earth, where the sun goes down. Here he
would gladly have rested till morning. It was the realm of King Atlas,
whose bulk surpassed that of all other men. He was rich iii flocks and
herds and had no neighbour or rival to dispute his state. But his chief
pride was in his gardens whose fruit was of gold, hanging from golden
branches, half hid with golden leaves. Perseus said to him, "I come as a
guest. If you honour illustrious descent, I claim Jupiter for my father;
if mighty deeds, I plead the conquest of the Gorgon. I seek rest and
food." But Atlas remembered that an ancient prophecy had warned him that
a son of Jove should one day rob him of His golden apples. So he
answered, "Begone! or neither your false claims of glory nor parentage
shall protect you;" and he attempted to thrust him out. Perseus, finding
the giant too strong for him, said, "Since you value my friendship so
little, deign to accept a present;" and turning his face away, he held
up the Gorgon's head. Atlas, with all his bulk, was changed into stone.
His beard and hair became forests, his arms and shoulders cliffs, his
head a summit, and his bones rocks. Each part increased in bulk till be
became a mountain, and (such was the pleasure of the gods) heaven with
all its stars rests upon his shoulders.

                     THE SEA-MONSTER.  

Perseus, continuing his flight, arrived at the country of the
AEthiopians, of which Cepheus was king. Cassiopeia his queen, proud of
her beauty, had dared to compare herself to the Sea-nymphs, which roused
their indignation to such a degree that they sent a prodigious
sea-monster to ravage the coast. To appease the deities, Cepheus was
directed by the oracle to expose his daughter Andromeda to be devoured
by the monster. As Perseus looked down from his aerial height he beheld
the virgin chained to a rock, and waiting the approach of the serpent.
She was so pale and motionless that if it had not been for her flowing
tears and her hair that moved in the breeze, he would have taken her for
a marble statue. He was so startled at the sight that he almost forgot
to wave his wings. As he hovered over her he said, "O virgin,
undeserving of those chains, but rather of such as bind fond lovers
together, tell me, I beseech you, your name, and the name of your
country, and why you are thus bound." At first she was silent from
modesty, and, if she could, would have hid her face with her hands; but
when he repeated his questions, for fear she might be thought guilty of
some fault which she dared not tell, she disclosed her name And that of
her country, and her mother's pride of beauty. Before she had done
speaking, a sound was heard off upon the water, and the sea-monster
appeared, with his head raised above the surface, cleaving the waves
with his broad breast. The virgin shrieked, the father and mother who
had now arrived at the scene, wretched both, but the mother more justly
so, stood by, not able to afford protection, but only to pour forth
lamentations and to embrace the victim. Then spoke Perseus; "There will
be time enough for tears; this hour is all we have for rescue. My rank
as the son of Jove and my renown as the slayer of the Gorgon might make
me acceptable as a suitor; but I will try to win her by services
rendered, if the gods will only be propitious. If she be rescued by my
valour, I demand that she be my reward." The parents consent (how could
they hesitate?) and promise a royal dowry with her.

And now the monster was within the range of a stone thrown by a skilful
slinger, when with a sudden bound the youth soared into the air. As an
eagle, when from his lofty flight he sees a serpent basking in the sun,
pounces upon him and seizes him by the neck to prevent him from turning
his head round and using his fangs, so the youth darted down upon the
back of the monster and plunged his sword into its shoulder. Irritated
by the wound, the monster raised himself into the air, then plunged into
the depth; then, like a wild boar surrounded by a pack of barking dogs,
turned swiftly from side to side, while the youth eluded its attacks by
means of his wings. Wherever he can find a passage for his sword between
the scales he makes a wound, piercing now the side, now the flank, as it
slopes towards the tail. The brute spouts from his nostrils water mixed
with blood. The wings of the hero are wet with it, and he dares no
longer trust to them. Alighting on a rock which rose above the waves,
and holding on by a projecting fragment, as the monster floated near he
gave him a death stroke. The people who had gathered on the shore
shouted so that the hills reechoed with the sound. The parents,
transported with joy, embraced their future son-in-law, calling him
their deliverer and the saviour of their house, and the virgin, both
cause and reward of the contest, descended from the rock.

Cassiopeia was an AEthiopian, and consequently, in spite of her boasted
beauty, black; at least so Milton seems to have thought, who alludes to
this story in his "Penseroso," where he addresses Melancholy as the

          "...goddess, sage and holy,  
           Whose saintly visage is too bright  
           To hit the sense of human sight,  
           And, therefore, to our weaker view,  
           O'erlaid with black, staid Wisdom's hue.  
           Black, but such as in esteem  
           Prince Memnon's sister might beseem.  
           Or that starred AEthiop queen that strove  
           To set her beauty's praise above  
           The sea-nymphs, and their powers offended."  

Cassiopeia is called "the starred AEthiop, queen" because after her
death she was placed among the stars, forming the constellation of that
name. Though she attained this honour, yet the Sea-Nymphs, her old
enemies, prevailed so far as to cause her to be placed in that part of
the heaven near the pole, where every night she is half the time held
with her head downward, to give her a lesson of humility.

Memnon was an AEthiopian prince, of whom we shall tell in a future
chapter.

### THE WEDDING FEAST.

The joyful parents, with Perseus and Andromeda, repaired to the palace,
where a banquet was spread for them, and all was joy and festivity. But
suddenly a noise was heard of warlike clamour, and Phineus, the
betrothed of the virgin, with a party of his adherents, burst in,
demanding the maiden as his own. It was in vain that Cepheus
remonstrated- "You should have claimed her when she lay bound to the
rock, the monster's victim. The sentence of the gods dooming her to such
a fate dissolved all engagements, as death itself would have done."
Phineus made no reply, but hurled his javelin at Perseus, but it missed
its mark and fell harmless. Perseus would have thrown his in turn, but
the cowardly assailant ran and took shelter behind the altar. But his
act was a signal for an onset by his hand upon the guests of Cepheus.
They defended themselves and a general conflict ensued, the old king
retreating from the scene after fruitless expostulations, calling the
gods to witness that he was guiltless of this outrage on the rights of
hospitality.

Perseus and his friends maintained for some time the unequal contest;
but the numbers of the assailants were too great for them, and
destruction seemed inevitable, when a sudden thought struck Perseus,- "I
will make my enemy defend me." Then with a loud voice he exclaimed, "If
I have any friend here let him turn away his eyes!" and held aloft the
Gorgon's head. "Seek not to frighten us with your jugglery," said
Thescelus, and raised his javelin in the act to throw, and became stone
in the very attitude. Ampyx was about to plunge his sword into the body
of a prostrate foe, but his arm stiffened and he could neither thrust
forward nor withdraw it. Another, in the midst of a vociferous
challenge, stopped, his mouth open, but no sound issuing. One of
Perseus's friends, Aconteus, caught sight of the Gorgon and stiffened
like the rest. Astyages struck him with his sword, but instead of
wounding, it recoiled with a ringing noise.

Phineus beheld this dreadful result of his unjust aggression, and felt
confounded. He called aloud to his friends, but got no answer; he
touched them and found them stone. Falling on his knees and stretching
out his hands to Perseus, but turning his head away, he begged for
mercy. "Take all," said he, "give me but my life." "Base coward," said
Perseus, "thus much I will grant you; no weapon shall touch you;
moreover, you shall be preserved in my house as a memorial of these
events." So saying, he held the Gorgon's head to the side where Phineus
was looking, and in the very form which he knelt, with his hands
outstretched and face averted, he became fixed immovably, a mass of
stone!

The following allusion to Perseus is from Milman's "Samor":

        "As 'mid the fabled Libyan bridal stood  
         Perseus in stern tranquillity of wrath,  
         Half stood, half floated on his ankle-plumes  
         Out-swelling, while the bright face on his shield  
         Looked into stone the raging fray; so rose,  
         But with no magic arms, wearing alone  
         Th' appalling and control of his firm look,  
         The Briton Samor; at his rising awe  
         Went abroad, and the riotous hall was mute."
