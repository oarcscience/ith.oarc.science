# CHAPTER XLI.

## THE DRUIDS- IONA.

### THE DRUIDS.

THE Druids were the priests or ministers of religion among the ancient
Celtic nations in Gaul, Britain, and Germany. Our information respecting
them is borrowed from notices in the Greek and Roman writers; compared
with the remains of Welsh and Gaelic poetry still extant.

The Druids combined the functions of the priest, the magistrate, the
scholar, and the physician. They stood to the people of the Celtic
tribes in a relation closely analogous to that in which the Brahmans of
India, the Magi of Persia, and the priests of the Egyptians stood to the
people respectively by whom they were revered.

The Druids taught the existence of one god, to whom they gave a name
"Be' al," which Celtic antiquaries tell us means "the life of
everything," or "the source of all beings," and which seems to have
affinity with the Phoenician Baal. What renders this affinity more
striking is that the Druids as well as the Phoenicians identified this,
their supreme deity, with the Sun. Fire was regarded as a symbol of the
divinity. The Latin writers assert that the Druids also worshipped
numerous inferior gods.

They used no images to represent the object of their worship, nor did
they meet in temples or buildings of any kind for the performance of
their sacred rites. A circle of stones (each stone generally of vast
size), enclosing an area of from twenty feet to thirty yards in
diameter, constituted their sacred place. The most celebrated of these
now remaining is Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain, England.

These sacred circles were generally situated near some stream, or under
the shadow of a grove or widespreading oak. In the centre of the circle
stood the Cromlech or altar, which was a large stone, placed in the
manner of a table upon other stones set up on end. The Druids had also
their high places, which were large stones or piles of stones on the
summits of hills. These were called Cairns, and were used in the worship
of the deity under the symbol of the sun.

That the Druids offered sacrifices to their deity there can be no doubt.
But there is some uncertainty as to what they offered, and of the
ceremonies connected with their religious services we know almost
nothing. The classical (Roman) writers affirm that they offered on great
occasions human sacrifices; as for success in war or for relief from
dangerous diseases. Caesar has given a detailed account of the manner in
which this was done. "They have images of immense size, the limbs of
which are framed with twisted twigs and filled with living persons.
These being set on fire, those within are encompassed by the flames."
Many attempts have been made by Celtic writers to shake the testimony of
the Roman historians to this fact, but without success.

The Druids observed two festivals in each year. The former took place in
the beginning of May, and was called Beltane or "fire of God." On this
occasion a large fire was kindled on some elevated spot, in honour of
the sun, whose returning beneficence they thus welcomed after the gloom
and desolation of winter. Of this custom a trace remains in the name
given to Whitsunday in parts of Scotland to this day. Sir Walter Scott
uses the word in the "Boat Song" in the "Lady of the Lake":

        "Ours is no sapling, chance sown by the fountain,  
         Blooming at Beltane in winter to fade;" etc.  

The other great festival of the Druids was called "Samh' in," or "fire
of peace," and was held on Hallow-eve (first of November), which still
retains this designation in the Highlands of Scotland. On this occasion
the Druids assembled in solemn conclave, in the most central part of the
district, to discharge the judicial functions of their order. All
questions, whether public or private, all crimes against person or
property, were at this time brought before them for adjudication. With
these judicial acts were combined certain superstitious usages,
especially the kindling of the sacred fire, from which all the fires in
the district, which had been beforehand scrupulously extinguished, might
be relighted. This usage of kindling fires on Hallow-eve lingered in the
British islands long after the establishment of Christianity.

Besides these two great annual festivals, the Druids were in the habit
of observing the full moon, and especially the sixth day of the moon. On
the latter they sought the Mistletoe, which grew on their favourite
oaks, and to which, as well as to the oak itself, they ascribed a
peculiar virtue and sacredness. The discovery of it was an occasion of
rejoicing and solemn worship. "They call it," says Pliny, "by a word in
their language, which means 'heal-all,' and having made solemn
preparation for feasting and sacrifice under the tree, they drive
thither two milk-white bulls, whose horns are then for the first time
bound. The priest then, robed in white, ascends the tree, and cuts off
the mistletoe with a golden sickle. It is caught in a white mantle,
after which they proceed to slay the victims, at the same time praying
that God would render his gift prosperous to those to whom he had given
it." They drink the water in which it has been infused, and think it a
remedy for all diseases. The mistletoe is a parasitic plant, and is not
always nor often found on the oak, so that when it is found it is the
more precious.

The Druids were the teachers of morality as well as of religion. Of
their ethical teaching a valuable specimen is preserved in the Triads of
the Welsh Bards, and from this we may gather that their views of moral
rectitude were on the whole just, and that they held and inculcated many
very noble and valuable principles of conduct. They were also the men of
science and learning of their age and people. Whether they were
acquainted with letters or not has been disputed, though the probability
is strong that they were, to some extent. But it is certain that they
committed nothing of their doctrine, their history, or their poetry to
writing. Their teaching was oral, and their literature (if such a word
may be used in such a case) was preserved solely by tradition. But the
Roman writers admit that "they paid much attention to the order and laws
of nature, and investigated and taught to the youth under their charge
many things concerning the stars and their motions, the size of the
world and the lands, and concerning the might and power of the immortal
gods."

Their history consisted in traditional tales, in which the heroic deeds
of their forefathers were celebrated. These were apparently in verse,
and thus constituted part of the poetry as well as the history of the
Druids. In the poems of Ossian we have, if not the actual productions of
Druidical times, what may be considered faithful representations of the
songs of the Bards.

The Bards were an essential part of the Druidical hierarchy. One author,
Pennant, says, "The Bards were supposed to be endowed with powers equal
to inspiration. They were the oral historians of all past transactions,
public and private. They were also accomplished genealogists," etc.

Pennant gives a minute account of the Eisteddfods or sessions of the
Bards and minstrels, which were held in Wales for many centuries, long
after the Druidical priesthood in its other departments became extinct.
At these meetings none but Bards of merit were suffered to rehearse
their pieces, and minstrels of skill to perform. Judges were appointed
to decide on their respective abilities, and suitable degrees were
conferred. In the earlier period the judges were appointed by the Welsh
princes, and after the conquest of Wales, by commission from the kings
of England. Yet the tradition is that Edward I, in revenge for the
influence of the Bards in animating the resistance of the people to his
sway, persecuted them with great cruelty. This tradition has furnished
the poet Gray with the subject of his celebrated ode, the "Bard."

There are still occasional meetings of the lovers of Welsh poetry and
music, held under the ancient name. Among Mrs. Hemans' poems is one
written for an Eisteddfod, or meeting of Welsh Bards, held in London,
May 22, 1822. It begins with a description of the ancient meeting, of
which the following lines are a part:

      "...midst the eternal cliffs, whose strength defied  
       The crested Roman in his hour of pride;  
       And where the Druid's ancient cromlech frowned,  
       And the oaks breathed mysterious murmurs round,  
       There thronged the inspired of yore! on plain or height,  
       In the sun's face, beneath the eye of light,  
       And baring unto heaven each noble head,  
       Stood in the circle, where none else might tread."  

The Druidical system was at its height at the time of the Roman invasion
under Julius Caesar. Against the Druids, as their chief enemies, these
conquerors of the world directed their unsparing fury. The Druids,
harassed at all points on the mainland, retreated to Anglesey and Iona,
where for a season they found shelter and continued their now
dishonoured rites.

The Druids retained their predominance in Iona and over the adjacent
islands and mainland until they were supplanted and their superstitions
overturned by the arrival of St. Columba, the apostle of the Highlands,
by whom the inhabitants of that district were first led to profess
Christianity.

### IONA.

One of the smallest of the British Isles, situated near a rugged and
barren coast, surrounded by dangerous seas, and possessing no sources of
internal wealth, Iona has obtained an imperishable place in history as
the seat of civilization and religion at a time when the darkness of
heathenism hung over almost the whole of Northern Europe. Iona or
Icolmkill is situated at the extremity of the island of Mull, from which
it is separated by a strait of half a mile in breadth, its distance from
the mainland of Scotland being thirty-six miles.

Columba was a native of Ireland, and connected by birth with the princes
of the land. Ireland was at that time a land of gospel light, while the
western and northern parts of Scotland were still immersed in the
darkness of heathenism. Columba with twelve friends landed on the island
of Iona in the year of our Lord 563, having made the passage in a wicker
boat covered with hides. The Druids who occupied the island endeavoured
to prevent his settling there, and the savage nations on the adjoining
shores incommoded him with their hostility, and on several occasions
endangered his rife by their attacks. Yet by his perseverance and zeal
he surmounted all opposition, procured from the king a gift of the
island, and established there a monastery of which he was the abbot. He
was unwearied in his labours to disseminate a knowledge of the
Scriptures throughout the Highlands and islands of Scotland, and such
was the reverence paid him that though not a bishop, but merely a
presbyter and monk, the entire province with its bishops was subject to
him and his successors. The Pictish monarch was so impressed with a
sense of his wisdom and worth that he held him in the highest honour,
and the neighbouring chiefs and princes sought his counsel and availed
themselves of his judgment in settling their disputes.

When Columba landed on Iona he was attended by twelve followers whom he
had formed into a religious body of which he was the head. To these, as
occasion required, others were from time to time added, so that the
original number was always kept up. Their institution was called a
monastery and the superior an abbot, but the system had little in common
with the monastic institutions of later times. The name by which those
who submitted to the rule were known was that of Culdees, probably from
the Latin "cultores Dei"- worshippers of God. They were a body of
religious persons associated together for the purpose of aiding each
other in the common work of preaching the gospel and teaching youth, as
well as maintaining in themselves the fervour of devotion by united
exercises of worship. On entering the order certain vows were taken by
the members, but they were not those which were usually imposed by
monastic orders, for of these, which are three- celibacy, poverty, and
obedience,- the Culdees were bound to none except the third. To poverty
they did not bind themselves; on the contrary they seem to have laboured
diligently to procure for themselves and those dependent on them the
comforts of life. Marriage also was allowed them, and most of them seem
to have entered into that state. True, their wives were not permitted to
reside with them at the institution, but they had a residence assigned
to them in an adjacent locality, Near Iona there is an island which
still bears the name of "Eilen nam ban," women's island, where their
husbands seem to have resided with them, except when duty required their
presence in the school or the sanctuary.

Campbell, in his poem of "Reullura," alludes to the married monks of
Iona:

          "...The pure Culdees  
             Were Albyn's earliest priests of God,  
           Ere yet an island of her seas  
             By foot of Saxon monk was trod,  
           Long ere her churchmen by bigotry  
           Were barred from holy wedlock's tie.  
           'Twas then that Aodh, famed afar,  
             In Iona preached the word with power,  
           And Reullura, beauty's star,  
             Was the partner of his bower."  

In one of his "Irish Melodies," Moore gives the legend of St. Senanus
and the lady who sought shelter on the island, but was repulsed:

          "O, haste and leave this sacred isle,  
           Unholy bark, ere morning smile;  
           For on thy deck, though dark it be,  
               A female form I see;  
           And I have sworn this sainted sod  
           Shall ne'er by woman's foot be trod."  

In these respects and in others the Culdees departed from the
established rules of the Romish church, and consequently were deemed
heretical. The consequence was that as the power of the latter advanced
that of the Culdees was enfeebled. It was not, however, till the
thirteenth century that the communities of the Culdees were suppressed
and the members dispersed. They still continued to labour as
individuals, and resisted the inroads of Papal usurpation as they best
might till the light of the Reformation dawned on the world.

Iona, from its position in the western seas, was exposed to the assaults
of the Norwegian and Danish rovers by whom those seas were infested, and
by them it was repeatedly pillaged, its dwellings burned, and its
peaceful inhabitants put to the sword. These unfavourable circumstances
led to its gradual decline, which was expedited by the subversion of the
Culdees throughout Scotland. Under the reign of Popery the island became
the seat of a nunnery, the ruins of which are still seen. At the
Reformation, the nuns were allowed to remain, living in community, when
the abbey was dismantled.

Iona is now chiefly resorted to by travellers on account of the numerous
ecclesiastical and sepulchral remains which are found upon it. The
principal of these are the Cathedral or Abbey Church and the Chapel of
the Nunnery. Besides these remains of ecclesiastical antiquity, there
are some of an earlier date, and pointing to the existence on the island
of forms of worship and belief different from those of Christianity.
These are the circular Cairns which are found in various parts, and
which seem to have been of Druidical origin. It is in reference to all
these remains of ancient religion that Johnson exclaims, "That man is
little to be envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the
plains of Marathon, or whose piety would not grow warmer amid the ruins
of Iona."

In the "Lord of the Isles," Scott beautifully contrasts the church on
Iona with the cave of Staffa, opposite:

          "Nature herself, it seemed, would raise  
           A minster to her Maker's praise!  
           Not for a meaner use ascend  
           Her columns, or her arches bend;  
           Nor of a theme less solemn tells  
           That mighty surge that ebbs and swells,  
           And still between each awful pause,  
           From the high vault an answer draws,  
           In varied tone, prolonged and high,  
           That mocks the organ's melody;  
           Nor doth its entrance front in vain  
           To old Iona's holy fane,  
           That Nature's voice might seem to say,  
           Well hast thou done, frail child of clay!  
           Thy humble powers that stately shrine  
           Tasked high and hard- but witness mine!"
