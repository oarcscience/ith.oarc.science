## ORIGIN OF MYTHOLOGY- STATUES OF GODS AND GODDESSES- POETS

### OF MYTHOLOGY.

### ORIGIN OF MYTHOLOGY.

HAVING reached the close of our series of stories of Pagan mythology, an
inquiry suggests itself. "Whence came these stories? Have they a
foundation in truth, or are they simply dreams of the imagination?"
Philosophers have suggested various theories of the subject; and 1. The
Scriptural theory; according to which all mythological legends are
derived from the narratives of Scriptures, though the real facts have
been disguised and altered. Thus Deucalion is only another name for
Noah, Hercules for Samson, Arion for Jonah, etc. Sir Walter Raleigh, in
his "History of the World," says, "Jubal, Tubal, and Tubal-Cain were
Mercury, Vulcan, and Apollo, inventors of Pasturage, Smithing, and
Music. The Dragon which kept the golden apples was the serpent that
beguiled Eve. Nimrod's tower was the attempt of the Giants against
Heaven." There are doubtless many curious coincidences like these, but
the theory cannot without extravagance be pushed so far as to account
for any great proportion of the stories.

2\. The Historical theory; according to which all the persons mentioned
in mythology were once real human beings, and the legends and fabulous
traditions relating to them are merely the additions and embellishments
of later times. Thus the story of AEolus, the king and god of the winds,
is supposed to have risen from the fact that AEolus was the ruler of
some islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where be reigned as a just and pious
king, and taught the natives the use of sails for or ships, and how to
tell from the signs of the atmosphere the changes of the weather and the
winds. Cadmus, who, the legend says, sowed the earth with dragon's
teeth, from which sprang a crop of armed men, was in fact an emigrant
from Phoenicia, and brought with him into Greece the knowledge of the
letters of the alphabet, which be taught to the natives. From these
rudiments of learning sprung civilization, which the poets have always
been prone to describe as a deterioration of man's first estate, the
Golden Age of innocence and simplicity.

3\. The Allegorical theory supposes that all the myths of the ancients
were allegorical and symbolical, and contained some moral, religious, or
philosophical truth or historical fact, under the form of an allegory,
but came in process of time to be understood literally. Thus Saturn, who
devours his own children, is the same power whom the Greeks called
Cronos (Time), which may truly be said to destroy whatever it has
brought into existence. The story of Io is interpreted in a similar
manner. Io is the moon, and Argus the starry sky, which, as it were,
keeps sleepless watch over her. The fabulous wanderings of lo represent
the continual revolutions of the moon, which also suggested to Milton
the same idea.

            "To behold the wandering moon  
             Riding near her highest noon,  
             Like one that had been led astray  
             In the heaven's wide, pathless way."  
                                                 Il Penseroso.  

4\. The Physical theory; according to which the elements of air, fire,
and water were originally the objects of religious adoration, and the
principal deities were personifications of the powers of nature. The
transition was easy from a personification of the elements to the notion
of supernatural beings presiding over and governing the different
objects of nature. The Greeks, whose imagination was lively, peopled all
nature with invisible beings, and supposed that every object, from the
sun and sea to the smallest fountain and rivulet, was under the care of
some particular divinity. Wordsworth, in his "Excursion," has
beautifully developed this view of Grecian mythology:

        "In that fair clime the lonely herdsman, stretched  
         On the soft grass through half a summer's day,  
         With music lulled his indolent repose;  
         And, in some fit of weariness, if he,  
         When his own breath was silent, chanced to hear  
         A distant strain far sweeter than the sounds  
         Which his poor skill could make, his fancy fetched  
         Even from the blazing chariot of the Sun  
         A beardless youth who touched a golden lute,  
         And filled the illumined groves with ravishment.  
         The mighty hunter, lifting up his eyes  
         Toward the crescent Moon, with grateful heart  
         Called on the lovely Wanderer who bestowed  
         That timely light to share his joyous sport;  
         And hence a beaming goddess with her nymphs  
         Across the lawn and through the darksome grove  
         (Not unaccompanied with tuneful notes  
         By echo multiplied from rock or cave)  
         Swept in the storm of chase, as moon and stars  
         Glance rapidly along the clouded heaven  
         When winds are blowing strong. The Traveller slaked  
         His thirst from rill or gushing fount, and thanked  
         The Naiad. Sunbeams upon distant hills  
         Gliding apace with shadows in their train,  
         Might, with small help from fancy, be transformed  
         Into fleet Oreads sporting visibly.  
         The Zephyrs, fanning, as they passed, their wings,  
         Lacked not for love fair objects whom they wooed  
         With gentle whisper. Withered boughs grotesque,  
         Stripped of their leaves and twigs by hoary age,  
         From depth of shaggy covert peeping forth  
         In the low vale, or on steep mountain side;  
         And sometimes intermixed with stirring horns  
         Of the live deer, or goat's depending beard;  
         These were the lurking Satyrs, a wild brood  
         Of gamesome deities; or Pan himself,  
         That simple shepherd's awe-inspiring god."  

All the theories which have been mentioned are true to a certain extent.
It would therefore be more correct to say that the mythology of a nation
has sprung from all these sources combined than from any one in
particular. We may add also that there are many myths which have arisen
from the desire of man to account for those natural phenomena which he
cannot understand; and not a few have had their rise from a similar
desire of giving a reason for the names of places and persons.

### STATUES OF THE GODS.

To adequately represent to the eye the ideas intended to be conveyed to
the mind under the several names of deities was a task which called into
exercise the highest powers of genius and art. Of to many attempts four
have been most celebrated the first two known to us only by the
descriptions of the ancients, the others still extant and the
acknowledged masterpieces of the sculptor's art.

### THE OLYMPIAN JUPITER.

The statue of the Olympian Jupiter by Phidias was considered the highest
achievement of this department of Grecian art. It was of colossal
dimensions, and was what the ancients called "chryselephantine"; that
is, composed of ivory and gold; the parts representing flesh being of
ivory laid on a core of wood or stone, while the drapery and other
ornaments were of gold. The height of the figure was forty feet, on a
pedestal twelve feet high. The god was represented seated on his throne.
His brows were crowned with a wreath of olive, and he held in his right
hand a sceptre, and in his left a statue of Victory. The throne was of
cedar, adorned with gold and precious stones.

The idea which the artist essayed to embody was that of the supreme
deity of the Hellenic (Grecian) nation, enthroned as a conqueror, in
perfect majesty and repose, and ruling with a nod the subject world.
Phidias avowed that he took his idea from the representation which Homer
gives in the first book of the "Iliad," in the passage thus translated
by Pope:

        "He spoke and awful bends his sable brows,  
         Shakes his ambrosial curls and gives the nod,  
         The stamp of fate and sanction of the god.  
         High heaven with reverence the dread signal took,  
         And all Olympus to the centre shook."\*  

\* Cowper's version is less elegant, but truer to the original:

        "He ceased, and under his dark brows the nod  
         Vouchsafed of confirmation. All around  
         The sovereign's everlasting head his curls  
         Ambrosial shook, and the huge mountain reeled."  

It may interest our readers to see how this passage appears in another
famous version, that which was issued under the name of Tickell,
contemporaneously with Pope's, and which, being by many attributed to
Addison, led to the quarrel which ensued between Addison and Pope:

        "This said, his kingly brow the sire inclined;  
         The large black curls fell awful from behind,  
         Thick shadowing the stern forehead of the god;  
         Olympus trembled at the almighty nod."  

### THE MINERVA OF THE PARTHENON.

This was also the work of Phidias. It stood in the Parthenon, or temple
of Minerva at Athens. The goddess was represented standing. In one hand
she held a spear, in the other a statue of Victory. Her helmet, highly
decorated, was surmounted by a Sphinx. The statue was forty feet in
height, and, like the Jupiter, composed of ivory and gold. The eyes were
of marble, and probably painted to represent the iris and pupil. The
Parthenon, in which this statue stood, was also constructed under the
direction and superintendence of Phidias. Its exterior was enriched with
sculptures, many of them from the hand of Phidias. The Elgin marbles,
now in the British Museum, are a part of them.

Both the Jupiter and Minerva of Phidias are lost, but there is good
ground to believe that we have, in several extant statues and busts, the
artist's conceptions of the countenances of both. They are characterized
by grave and dignified beauty, and freedom from any transient
expression, which in the language of art is called repose.

### THE VENUS DE' MEDICI.

The Venus of the Medici is so called from its having been in the
possession of the princes of that name in Rome when it first attracted
attention, about two hundred years ago. An inscription on the base
records it to be the work of Cleomenes, an Athenian sculptor of 200
B.C., but the authenticity of the inscription is doubtful. There is a
story that the artist was employed by public authority to make a statue
exhibiting the perfection of female beauty, and to aid him in his task
the most perfect forms the city could supply were furnished him for
models. It is this which Thomson alludes to in his "Summer":

        "So stands the statue that enchants the world;  
         So bending tries to veil the matchless boast,  
         The mingled beauties of exulting Greece."  

Byron also alludes to this statue. Speaking of the Florence Museum, he
says:

        "There, too, the goddess loves in stone, and fills  
         The air around with beauty;" etc.  

And in the next stanza,

   "Blood, pulse, and breast confirm the Dardan shepherd's prize."  

See this last allusion explained in Chapter XXVII.

### THE APOLLO BELVEDERE.

The most highly esteemed of all the remains of ancient sculpture is the
statue of Apollo, called the Belvedere, from the name of the apartment
of the Pope's palace at Rome in which it was placed. The artist is
unknown. It is supposed to be a work of Roman art, of about the first
century of our era. It is a standing figure, in marble, more than seven
feet high, naked except for the cloak which is fastened around the neck
and hangs over the extended left arm. It is supposed to represent the
god in the moment when he has shot the arrow to destroy the monster
Python. (See Chapter III.) The victorious divinity is in the act of
stepping forward. The left arm, which seems to have held the bow, is
outstretched, and the head is turned in the same direction. In attitude
and proportion the graceful majesty of the figure is unsurpassed. The
effect is completed by the countenance, where on the perfection of
youthful godlike beauty there dwells the consciousness of triumphant
power.

### THE DIANA A LA BICHE.

The Diana of the Hind, in the palace of the Louvre, may be considered
the counterpart to the Apollo Belvedere. The attitude much resembles
that of the Apollo, the sizes correspond and also the style of
execution. It is a work of the highest order, though by no means equal
to the Apollo. The attitude is that of hurried and eager motion, the
face that of a huntress in the excitement of the chase. The left hand is
extended over the forehead of the Hind, which runs by her side, the
right arm reaches backward over the shoulder to draw an arrow from the
quiver.

### THE POETS OF MYTHOLOGY.

Homer, from whose poems of the "Iliad" and "Odyssey" we have taken the
chief part of our chapters of the Trojan war and the return of the
Grecians, is almost as mythical a personage as the heroes he celebrates.
The traditionary story is that he was a wandering minstrel, blind and
old, who travelled from place to place singing his lays to the music of
his harp, in the courts of princes or the cottages of peasants, and
dependent upon the voluntary offerings of his hearers for support. Byron
calls him "The blind old man of Scio's rocky isle," and a well-known
epigram, alluding to the uncertainty of the fact of his birthplace,
says:

         "Seven wealthy towns contend for Homer dead,  
          Through which the living Homer begged his bread."  

These seven were Smyrna, Scio, Rhodes, Colophon, Salamis, Argos, and
Athens.

Modern scholars have doubted whether the Homeric poems are the work of
any single mind. This arises from the difficulty of believing that poems
of such length could have been committed to writing at so early an age
as that usually assigned to these, an age earlier than the date of any
remaining inscriptions or coins, and when no materials capable of
containing such long productions were yet introduced into use. On the
other hand it is asked how poems of such length could have been handed
down from age to age by means of the memory alone. This is answered by
the statement that there was a professional body of men, called
Rhapsodists, who recited the poems of others, and whose business it was
to commit to memory and rehearse for pay the national and patriotic
legends.

The prevailing opinion of the learned, at this time, seems to be that
the framework and much of the structure of the poems belongs to Homer,
but that there are numerous interpolations and additions by other hands.

The date assigned to Homer, on the authority of Herodotus, is 850 B.C.

### VIRGIL.

Virgil, called also by his surname, Maro, from whose poem of the
"AEneid" we have taken the story of AEneas, was one of the great poets
who made the reign of the Roman emperor Augustus so celebrated, under
the name of the Augustan age. Virgil was born in Mantua in the year 70
B.C. His great poem is ranked next to those of Homer, in the highest
class of poetical composition, the Epic. Virgil is far inferior to Homer
in originality and invention, but superior to him in correctness and
elegance. To critics of English lineage Milton alone of modern poets
seems worthy to be classed with these illustrious ancients. His poem of
"Paradise Lost," from which we have borrowed so many illustrations, is
in many respects equal, in some superior, to either of the great works
of antiquity. The following epigram of Dryden characterizes the three
poets with as much truth as it is usual to find in such pointed
criticism.

                        "ON MILTON.  
        "Three poets in three different ages born,  
         Greece, Italy, and England did adorn.  
         The first in loftiness of soul surpassed,  
         The next in majesty, in both the last.  
         The force of nature could no further go;  
         To make a third she joined the other two."  

From Cowper's "Table Talk":

        "Ages elapsed ere Homer's lamp appeared,  
         And ages ere the Mantuan swan was heard.  
         To carry nature lengths unknown before,  
         To give a Milton birth, asked ages more.  
         Thus genius rose and set at ordered times,  
         And shot a dayspring into distant climes,  
         Ennobling every region that he chose;  
         He sunk in Greece, in Italy he rose,  
         And, tedious years of Gothic darkness past,  
         Emerged all splendour in our isle at last.  
         Thus lovely Halcyons dive into the main,  
         Then show far off their shining plumes again."  

### OVID,

often alluded to in poetry by his other name of Naso, was born in the
year 43 B.C. He was educated for public life and held some offices of
considerable dignity, but poetry was his delight, and he early resolved
to devote himself to it. He accordingly sought the society of the
contemporary poets, and was acquainted with Horace and saw Virgil,
though the latter died when Ovid was yet too young and undistinguished
to have formed his acquaintance. Ovid spent an easy life at Rome in the
enjoyment of a competent income. He was intimate with the family of
Augustus, the emperor, and it is supposed that some serious offence
given to some member of that family was the cause of an event which
reversed the poet's happy circumstances and clouded all the latter
portion of his life. At the age of fifty he was banished from Rome, and
ordered to betake himself to Tomi, on the borders of the Black Sea.
Here, among the barbarous people and in a severe climate, the poet, who
had been accustomed to all the pleasures of a luxurious capital and the
society of his most distinguished contemporaries, spent the last ten
years of his life, worn out with grief and anxiety. His only consolation
in exile was to address his wife and absent friends, and his letters
were all poetical. Though these poems (the "Tristia" and "Letters from
Pontus") have no other topic than the poet's sorrow's, his exquisite
taste and fruitful invention have redeemed them from the charge of being
tedious, and they are read with pleasure and even with sympathy.

The two great works of Ovid are his "Metamorphoses" and his "Fasti."
They are both mythological poems, and from the former we have taken most
of our stories of Grecian and Roman mythology. A late writer thus
characterizes these poems:

"The rich mythology of Greece furnished Ovid, as it may still furnish
the poet, the painter, and the sculptor, with materials for his art.
With exquisite taste, simplicity, and pathos he has narrated the
fabulous traditions of early ages, and given to them that appearance of
reality which only a master-hand could impart. His pictures of nature
are striking and true; he selects with care that which is appropriate;
he rejects the superfluous; and when he has completed his work, it is
neither defective nor redundant. The 'Metamorphoses' are read with
pleasure by youth, and are re-read in more advanced age with still
greater delight. The poet ventured to predict that his poem would
survive him, and be read wherever the Roman name was known."

The prediction above alluded to is contained in the closing lines of the
"Metamorphoses," of which we give a literal translation below:

        "And now I close my work, which not the ire  
         Of Jove, nor tooth of time, nor sword, nor fire  
         Shall bring to nought. Come when it will that day  
         Which o'er the body, not the mind, has sway,  
         And snatch the remnant of my life away,  
         My better part above the stars shall soar,  
         And my renown endure for evermore.  
         Where'er the Roman arms and arts shall spread,  
         There by the people shall my book be read;  
         And, if aught true in poet's visions be,  
         My name and fame have immortality."
