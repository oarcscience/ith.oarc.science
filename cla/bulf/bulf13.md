# CHAPTER XIV.

## MINERVA- NIOBE.

### MINERVA.

MINERVA, the goddess of wisdom, was the daughter of Jupiter. She was
said to have leaped forth from his brain, mature, and in complete
armour. She presided over the useful and ornamental arts, both those of
men- such as agriculture and navigation- and those of women,- spinning,
weaving, and needlework. She was also a warlike divinity; but it was
defensive war only that she patronized, and she had no sympathy with
Mars's savage love of violence and bloodshed. Athens was her chosen
seat, her own city, awarded to her as the prize of a contest with
Neptune, who also aspired to it, The tale ran that in the reign of
Cecrops, the first king of Athens, the two deities contended for the
possession of the city. The gods decreed that it should be awarded to
that one who produced the gift most useful to mortals. Neptune gave the
horse; Minerva produced the olive. The gods gave judgment that the olive
was the more useful of the two, and awarded the city to the goddess; and
it was named after her, Athens, her name in Greek being Athene.

There was another contest, in which a mortal dared to come in
competition with Minerva. That mortal was Arachne, a maiden who had
attained such skill in the arts of weaving and embroidery that the
nymphs themselves would leave their groves and fountains to come and
gaze upon her work. It was not only beautiful when it was done, but
beautiful also in the doing. To watch her, as she took the wool in its
rude state and formed it into rolls, or separated it with her fingers
and carded it till it looked as light and soft as a cloud, or twirled
the spindle with skilful touch, or wove the web, or, after it was woven,
adorned it with her needle, one would have said that Minerva herself had
taught her. But this she denied, and could not bear to be thought a
pupil even of a goddess. "Let Minerva try her skill with mine," said
she; "if beaten I will pay the penalty." Minerva heard this and was
displeased. She assumed the form of an old woman and went and gave
Arachne some friendly advice. "I have had much experience," said she,
"and I hope you will not despise my counsel. Challenge your
fellow-mortals as you will, but do not compete with a goddess. On the
contrary, I advise you to ask her forgiveness for what you have said,
and as she is merciful perhaps she will pardon you." Arachne stopped her
spinning and looked at the old dame with anger in her countenance. "Keep
your counsel," said she, "for your daughters or handmaids; for my part I
know what I say, and I stand to it. I am not afraid of the goddess; let
her try her skill, if she dare venture." "She comes," said Minerva; and
dropping her disguise stood confessed. The nymphs bent low in homage,
and all the bystanders paid reverence. Arachne alone was unterrified.
She blushed, indeed; a sudden colour dyed her cheek, and then she grew
pale. But she stood to her resolve, and with a foolish conceit of her
own skill rushed on her fate. Minerva forbore no longer nor interposed
any further advice. They proceed to the contest. Each takes her station
and attaches the web to the beam. Then the slender shuttle is passed in
and out among the threads. The reed with its fine teeth strikes the woof
into its place and compacts the web. Both work with speed; their skilful
hands move rapidly, and the excitement of the contest makes the labour
light. Wool of Tyrian dye is contrasted with that of other colours,
shaded off into one another so adroitly that the joining deceives the
eye. Like the bow, whose long arch tinges the heavens, formed by
sunbeams reflected from the shower,\* in which, where the colours meet
they seem as one, but a little distance from the point of contact are
wholly different.

\* This correct description of the rainbow is literally translated from
Ovid.

Minerva wrought on her web the scene of her contest with Neptune. Twelve
of the heavenly powers are represented, Jupiter, with august gravity,
sitting in the midst. Neptune, the ruler of the sea, holds his trident,
and appears to have just smitten the earth, from which a horse has
leaped forth. Minerva depicted herself with helmed head, her AEgis
covering her breast. Such was the central circle; and in the four
corners were represented incidents illustrating the displeasure of the
gods at such presumptuous mortals as had dared to contend with them.
These were meant as warnings to her rival to give up the contest before
it was too late.

Arachne filled her web with subjects designedly chosen to exhibit the
failings and errors of the gods. One scene represented Leda caressing
the swan, under which form Jupiter had disguised himself; and another,
Danae, in the brazen tower in which her father had imprisoned her, but
where the god effected his entrance in the form of a golden shower.
Still another depicted Europa deceived by Jupiter under the disguise of
a bull. Encouraged by the tameness of the animal Europa ventured to
mount his back, whereupon Jupiter advanced into the sea and swam with
her to Crete, You would have thought it was a real bull, so naturally
was it wrought, and so natural the water in which it swam. She seemed to
look with longing eyes back upon the shore she was leaving, and to call
to her companions for help. She appeared to shudder with terror at the
sight of the heaving waves, and to draw back her feel, from the water.

Arachne filled her canvas with similar subjects, wonderfully well done,
but strongly marking her presumption and impiety. Minerva could not
forbear to admire, yet felt indignant at the insult. She struck the web
with her shuttle and rent it in pieces; she then touched the forehead of
Arachne and made her feel her guilt and shame. She could not endure it
and went and hanged herself. Minerva pitied her as she saw her suspended
by a rope. "Live," she said, "guilty woman! and that you may preserve
the memory of this lesson, continue to hang, both you and your
descendants, to all future times." She sprinkled her with the juices of
aconite, and immediately her hair came off, and her nose and ears
likewise. Her form shrank up, and her head grew smaller yet; her fingers
cleaved to her side and served for legs. All the rest of her is body,
out of which she spins her thread, often hanging suspended by it, in the
same attitude as when Minerva touched her and transformed her into a
spider.

Spenser tells the story of Arachne in his "Muiopotmos," adhering very
closely to his master Ovid, but improving upon him in the conclusion of
the story. The two stanzas which follow tell what was done after the
goddess had depicted her creation of the olive tree:

        "Amongst these leaves she made a Butterfly,  
         With excellent device and wondrous slight,  
         Fluttering among the olives wantonly,  
         That seemed to live, so like it was in sight;  
         The velvet nap which on his wings doth lie,  
         The silken down with which his back is dight,  
         His broad outstretched horns, his hairy thighs,  
         His glorious colours, and his glistening eyes."\*  
        "Which when Arachne saw, as overlaid  
         And mastered with workmanship so rare,  
         She stood astonied long, ne aught gainsaid;  
         And with fast-fixed eyes on her did stare,  
         And by her silence, sign of one dismayed,  
         The victory did yield her as her share:  
         Yet did she inly fret and felly burn,  
         And all her blood to poisonous rancour turn."  

\* Sir James Mackintosh says of this, "Do you think that even a Chinese
could paint the gay colours of a butterfly with more minute exactness
than the following lines: 'The velvet nap,' etc.?"- Life, Vol. II. 246.

And so the metamorphosis is caused by Arachne's own mortification and
vexation, and not by any direct act of the goddess.

The following specimen of old-fashioned gallantry is by Garrick:

                "UPON A LADY'S EMBROIDERY  
              "Arachne once, as poets tell,  
                 A goddess at her art defied,  
               And soon the daring mortal fell  
                 The hapless victim of her pride.  
              "O, then beware Arachne's fate;  
                 Be prudent, Chloe, and submit,  
               For you'll most surely meet her hate,  
                 Who rival both her art and wit."  

Tennyson, in his "Palace of Art," describing the works of art with which
the palace was adorned, thus alludes to Europa:

          "...sweet Europa's mantle blew unclasped  
             From off her shoulder, backward borne,  
           From one hand drooped a crocus, one hand grasped  
           The mild bull's golden horn."  

In his "Princess" there is this allusion to Danae:

            "Now lies the earth all Danae to the stars,  
             And all thy heart lies open unto me."  

### NIOBE.

The fate of Arachne was noised abroad through all the country, and
served as a warning to all presumptuous mortals not to compare
themselves with the divinities. But one, and she a matron too, failed to
learn the lesson of humility. It was Niobe, the queen of Thebes. She had
indeed much to be proud of; but it was not her husband's fame, nor her
own beauty, nor their great descent, nor the power of their kingdom that
elated her. It was her children; and truly the happiest of mothers would
Niobe have been if only she had not claimed to be so. It was on occasion
of the annual celebration in honour of Latona and her offspring, Apollo
and Diana,- when the people of Thebes were assembled, their brows
crowned with laurel, bearing frankincense to the altars and paying their
vows,- that Niobe appeared among the crowd. Her attire was splendid with
gold and gems, and her aspect beautiful as the face of an angry woman
can be. She stood and surveyed the people with haughty looks. "What
folly," said she, "is this!- to prefer beings whom you never saw to
those who stand before your eyes! Why should Latona be honoured with
worship, and none be paid to me? My father was Tantalus, who was
received as a guest at the table of the gods; my mother was a goddess.
My husband built and rules this city, Thebes, and Phrygia is my paternal
inheritance. Wherever I turn my eyes I survey the elements of my power;
nor is my form and presence unworthy of a goddess. To all this let me
add I have seven sons and seven daughters, and look for sons-in-law and
daughters-in-law of pretensions worthy of my alliance. Have I not cause
for pride? Will you prefer to me this Latona, the Titan's daughter, with
her two children? I have seven times as many. Fortunate indeed am I, and
fortunate I shall remain! Will any one deny this? My abundance is my
security. I feel myself too strong for Fortune to subdue. She may take
from me much; I shall still have much left. Were I to lose some of my
children, I should hardly be left as poor as Latona with her two only.
Away with you from these solemnities,- put off the laurel from your
brows,- have done with this worship!" The people obeyed, and left the
sacred services uncompleted.

The goddess was indignant. On the Cynthian mountain top where she dwelt
she thus addressed her son and daughter: "My children, I who have been
so proud of you both, and have been used to hold myself second to none
of the goddesses except Juno alone, begin now to doubt whether I am
indeed a goddess. I shall be deprived of my worship altogether unless
you protect me." She was proceeding in this strain, but Apollo
interrupted her. "Say no more," said he; "speech only delays
punishment." So said Diana also. Darting through the air, veiled in
clouds, they alighted on the towers of the city. Spread out before the
gates was a broad plain, where the youth of the city pursued their
warlike sports. The sons of Niobe were there with the rest,- some
mounted on spirited horses richly caparisoned, some driving gay
chariots, Ismenos, the first-born, as he guided his foaming steeds,
struck with an arrow from above, cried out, "Ah me!" dropped the reins,
and fell lifeless. Another, hearing the sound of the bow,- like the
boatman who sees the storm gathering and makes all sail for the port,-
gave the reins to his horses and attempted to escape. The inevitable
arrow overtook him, as he fled. Two others, younger boys, just from
their tasks, had gone to the playground to have a game of wrestling. As
they stood breast to breast, one arrow pierced them both. They uttered a
cry together, together cast a parting look around them, and together
breathed their last. Alphenor, an elder brother, seeing them fall,
hastened to the spot to render assistance, and fell stricken in the act
of brotherly duty. One only was left, Ilioneus. He raised his arms to
heaven to try whether prayer might not avail. "Spare me, ye gods!" he
cried, addressing all, in his ignorance that all needed not his
intercessions; and Apollo would have spared him, but the arrow had
already left the string, and it was too late.

The terror of the people and grief of the attendants soon made Niobe
acquainted with what had taken place. She could hardly think it
possible; she was indignant that the gods had dared, and amazed that
they had been able to do it. Her husband, Amphion, overwhelmed with the
blow, destroyed himself. Alas! how different was this Niobe from her who
had so lately driven away the people from the sacred rites, and held her
stately course through the city, the envy of her friends, now the pity
even of her foes! She knelt over the lifeless bodies, and kissed now
one, now another of her dead sons. Raising her pallid arms to heaven,
"Cruel Latona," said she, "feed full your rage with my anguish! Satiate
your hard heart, while I follow to the grave my seven sons. Yet where is
your triumph? Bereaved as I am, I am still richer than you, my
conqueror." Scarce had she spoken, when the bow sounded and struck
terror into all hearts except Niobe's alone. She was brave from excess
of grief, The sisters stood in garments of mourning over the biers of
their dead brothers. One fell, struck by an arrow, and died on the
corpse she was bewailing. Another, attempting to console her mother,
suddenly ceased to speak, and sank lifeless to the earth. A third tried
to escape by flight, a fourth by concealment, another stood trembling,
uncertain what course to take. Six were now dead, and only one remained,
whom the mother held clasped in her arms, and covered as it were with
her whole body. "Spare me one, and that the youngest! O spare me one of
so many!" she cried; and while she spoke, that one fell dead. Desolate
she sat, among sons, daughters, husband, all dead, and seemed torpid
with grief. The breeze moved not her hair, no colour was on her cheek,
her eyes glared fixed and immovable, there was no sign of life about
her. Her very tongue cleaved to the roof of her mouth, and her veins
ceased to convey the tide of life. Her neck bent not, her arms made no
gesture, her foot no step. She was changed to stone, within and without.
Yet tears continued to flow; and borne on a whirlwind to her native
mountain, she still remains, a mass of rock, from which a trickling
stream flows, the tribute of her never-ending grief.

The story of Niobe has furnished Byron with a fine illustration of the
fallen condition of modern Rome:

        "The Niobe of nations! there she stands,  
         Childless and crownless in her voiceless woe;  
         An empty urn within her withered hands,  
           Whose holy dust was scattered long ago;  
         The Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now:  
         The very sepulchres lie tenantless  
         Of their heroic dwellers; dost thou flow,  
         Old Tiber! through a marble wilderness?  
     Rise with thy yellow waves, and mantle her distress."  
                                               Childe Harold, IV. 79.  

As an illustration of this story there is a celebrated statue in the
imperial gallery of Florence. It is the principal figure of a group
supposed to have been originally arranged in the pediment of a temple.
The figure of the mother clasped by the arm of her terrified child is
one of the most admired of the ancient statues. It ranks with the
Laocoon and the Apollo among the masterpieces of art. The following is a
translation of a Greek epigram supposed to relate to this statue:

        "To stone the gods have changed her, but in vain;  
         The sculptor's art has made her breathe again."  

Tragic as is the Story of Niobe, we cannot forbear to smile at the use
Moore has made of it in "Rhymes on the Road":

          "'Twas in his carriage the sublime  
           Sir Richard Blackmore used to rhyme,  
             And, if the wits don't do him wrong,  
           'Twixt death and epics passed his time,  
             Scribbling and killing all day long;  
               Like Phoebus in his car at ease,  
             Now warbling forth a lofty song,  
               Now murdering the young Niobes."  

Sir Richard Blackmore was a physician, and at same time a very prolific
and very tasteless poet, whose works are now forgotten, unless when
recalled to mind by some wit like Moore for the sake of a joke.
