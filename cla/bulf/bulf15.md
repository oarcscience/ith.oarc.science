# CHAPTER XVI.

## MONSTERS.

### GIANTS, SPHINX, PEGASUS, AND CHIMAERA, CENTAURS, GRIFFIN,

#### AND PYGMIES.

MONSTERS, in the language of mythology, were beings of unnatural
proportions or parts, usually regarded with terror, as possessing
immense strength and ferocity, which they employed for the injury and
annoyance of men. Some of them were supposed to combine the members of
different animals; such were the Sphinx and Chimaera and to these all
the terrible qualities of wild beasts were attributed, together with
human sagacity and faculties. Others, as the giants, differed from men
chiefly in their size; and in this particular we must recognize a wide
distinction among them. The human giants, if so they may be called, such
as the Cyclops, Antaeus, Orion, and others, must be supposed not to be
altogether disproportioned to human beings, for they mingled in love and
strife with them. But the super-human giants, who warred with the gods,
were of vastly larger dimensions. Tityus, we are told, when stretched on
the plain, covered nine acres, and Enceladus required the whole of Mount
AEtna to be laid upon him to keep him down.

We have already spoken of the war which the giants waged against the
gods, and of its result. While this war lasted the giants proved a
formidable enemy. Some of them, like Briareus, had a hundred arms;
others, like Typhon, breathed out fire. At one time they put the gods to
such fear that they fled into Egypt and hid themselves under various
forms. Jupiter took the form of a ram, whence he was afterwards
worshipped in Egypt as the god Ammon, with curved horns. Apollo became a
crow, Bacchus a goat, Diana a cat, Juno a cow, Venus a fish, Mercury a
bird. At another time the giants attempted to climb up into heaven, and
for that purpose took up the mountain Ossa and piled it on Pelion.\*
They were at last subdued by thunderbolts, which Minerva invented, and
taught Vulcan and his Cyclops to make for Jupiter.

### THE SPHINX.

Laius, king of Thebes, was warned by an oracle that there was danger to
his throne and life if his new-born son should be suffered to grow up.
He therefore committed the child to the care of a herdsman with orders
to destroy him; but the herdsman, moved with pity, yet not daring
entirely to disobey, tied up the child by the feet and left him hanging
to the branch of a tree. In this condition the infant was found by a
peasant, who carried him to his master and mistress, by whom he was
adopted and called OEdipus, or Swollen-foot.

Many years afterwards Laius being on his way to Delphi, accompanied only
by one attendant, met in a narrow road a young man also driving in a
chariot. On his refusal to leave the way at their command the attendant
killed one of his horses, and the stranger, filled with rage, slew both
Laius and his attendant. The young man was OEdipus who thus unknowingly
became the slayer of his own father.

Shortly after this event the city of Thebes was afflicted with a monster
which infested the highroad. It was called the Sphinx. It had the body
of a lion and the upper part of a woman. It lay crouched on the top of a
rock, and arrested all travellers who came that way, proposing to them a
riddle, with the condition that those who could solve it should pass
safe, but those who failed should be killed. Not one had yet succeeded
in solving it, and all had been slain. OEdipus was not daunted by these
alarming accounts, but boldly advanced to the trial. The Sphinx asked
him, "What animal is that which in the morning goes on feet, at noon on
two, and in the evening upon three?" Oedipus replied, "Man, who in
childhood creeps on hands and knees, in manhood walks erect, and in old
age with the aid of a staff." The Sphinx was so mortified at the solving
of her riddle that she cast herself down from the rock and perished.

The gratitude of the people for their deliverance was so great that they
made OEdipus their king, giving him in marriage their queen Jocasta.
OEdipus, ignorant of his parentage, had already become the slayer of his
father; in marrying the queen he became the husband of his mother. These
horrors remained undiscovered, till at length Thebes was afflicted with
famine and pestilence, and the oracle being consulted, the double crime
of Oedipus came to light. Jocasta put an end to her own life, and
Oedipus, seized with madness, tore out his eyes and wandered away from
Thebes, dreaded and abandoned by all except his daughters, who
faithfully adhered to him, till after a tedious period of miserable
wandering he found the termination of his wretched life.

### PEGASUS AND THE CHIMAERA.

When Perseus cut off Medusa's head, the blood sinking into the earth
produced the winged horse Pegasus. Minerva caught and tamed him and
presented him to the Muses. The fountain Hippocrene, on the Muse's
mountain Helicon, was opened by a kick from his hoof.

The Chimaera was a fearful monster, breathing fire. The fore part of its
body was a compound of the lion and the goat, and the hind part a
dragon's. It made great havoc in Lycia, so that the king, Iobates,
sought for some hero to destroy it. At that time there arrived at his
court a gallant young warrior, whose name was Bellerophon. He brought
letters from Proetus, the son-in-law of Iobates, recommending
Bellerophon in the warmest terms as an unconquerable hero, but added at
the close a request to his father-in-law to put him to death. The reason
was that Proetus was jealous of him, suspecting that his wife Antea
looked with too much admiration on the young warrior. From this instance
of Bellerophon being unconsciously the bearer of his own death warrant,
the expression "Bellerophontic letters" arose, to describe any species
of communication which a person is made the bearer of, containing matter
prejudicial to himself.

Iobates, on perusing the letters, was puzzled what to do, not willing to
violate the claims of hospitality, yet wishing to oblige his son-in-law.
A lucky thought occurred to him, to send Bellerophon to combat with the
Chimaera. Bellerophon accepted the proposal, but before proceeding to
the combat consulted the soothsayer Polyidus, who advised him to procure
if possible the horse Pegasus for the conflict. For this purpose he
directed him to pass the night in the temple of Minerva. He did so, and
as he slept Minerva came to him and gave him a golden bridle. When he
awoke the bridle remained in his hand. Minerva also showed him Pegasus
drinking at the well of Pirene, and at sight of the bridle the winged
steed came willingly and suffered himself to be taken. Bellerophon
mounted him, rose with him into the air, soon found the Chimaera, and
gained an easy victory over the monster.

After the conquest of the Chimaera Bellerophon was exposed to further
trials and labours by his unfriendly host, but by the aid of Pegasus he
triumphed in them all, till at length Iobates, seeing that the hero was
a special favourite of the gods, gave him his daughter in marriage and
made him his successor on the throne. At last Bellerophon by his pride
and presumption drew upon himself the anger of the gods; it is said he
even attempted to fly up into heaven on his winged steed, but Jupiter
sent a gadfly which stung Pegasus and made him throw his rider, who
became lame and blind in consequence. After this Bellerophon wandered
lonely through the Aleian field, avoiding the paths of men, and died
miserably.

Milton alludes to Bellerophon in the beginning of the seventh book of
"Paradise Lost":

        "Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name  
         If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine  
         Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,  
         Above the flight of Pegasean wing.  
                                     Upled by thee,  
         Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,  
         An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air  
         (Thy tempering); with like safety guided down  
         Return me to my native element;  
         Lest, from this flying steed unreined (as once  
         Bellerophon, though from a lower clime),  
         Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,  
         Erroneous there to wander and forlorn."  

Young, in his "Night Thoughts," speaking of the sceptic, says:

          "He whose blind thought futurity denies,  
           Unconscious bears, Bellerophon, like thee  
           His own indictment; he condemns himself.  
           Who reads his bosom reads immortal life,  
           Or nature there, imposing on her sons,  
           Has written fables; man was made a lie."  
                                           Vol. II., p. 12.  

Pegasus, being the horse of the Muses, has always been at the service of
the poets. Schiller tells a pretty story of his having been sold by a
needy poet and put to the cart and the plough. He was not fit for such
service, and his clownish master could make nothing of him. But a youth
stepped forth and asked leave to try him. As soon as he was seated on
his back the horse, which had appeared at first vicious, and afterwards
spirit-broken, rose kingly, a spirit, a god, unfolded the splendour of
his wings, and soared towards heaven. Our own poet Longfellow also
records adventure of this famous steed in his "Pegasus in Pound."

Shakespeare alludes to Pegasus in "Henry IV.," where Vernon describes
Prince Henry:

        "I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,  
         His cuishes on this thighs, gallantly armed,  
         Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury,  
         And vaulted with such ease into his seat,  
         As if an angel dropped down from the clouds,  
         To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus,  
         And witch the world with noble horsemanship."  

### THE CENTAURS.

These monsters were represented as men from the head to the loins, while
the remainder of the body was that of a horse. The ancients were too
fond of a horse to consider the union of his nature with man's as
forming a very degraded compound, and accordingly the Centaur is the
only one of the fancied monsters of antiquity to which any good traits
are assigned. The Centaurs were admitted to the companionship of man,
and at the marriage of Pirithous with Hippodamia they were among the
guests. At the feast Eurytion, one of the Centaurs, becoming intoxicated
with the wine, attempted to offer violence to the bride; the other
Centaurs followed his example, and a dreadful conflict arose in which
several of them were slain. This is the celebrated battle of the
Lapithae and Centaurs, a favourite subject with the sculptors and poets
of antiquity.

But not all the Centaurs were like the rude guests of Pirithous. Chiron
was instructed by Apollo and Diana, and was renowned for his skill in
hunting, medicine, music, and the art of prophecy. The most
distinguished heroes of Grecian story were his pupils. Among the rest
the infant AEsculapius was intrusted to his charge by Apollo, his
father. When the sage returned to his home bearing the infant, his
daughter Ocyrhoe came forth to meet him, and at sight of the child burst
forth into a prophetic strain (for she was a prophetess), foretelling
the glory that he was to achieve. AEsculapius when grown up became a
renowned physician, and even in one instance succeeded in restoring the
dead to life. Pluto resented this, and Jupiter, at his request, struck
the bold physician with lightning, and killed him, but after his death
received him into the number of the gods.

Chiron was the wisest and justest of all the Centaurs, and at his death
Jupiter placed him among the stars as the constellation Sagittarius.

### THE PYGMIES

The Pygmies were a nation of dwarfs, so called from a Greek word which
means the cubit or measure of about thirteen inches, which was said to
be the height of these people. They lived near the sources of the Nile,
or according to others, in India. Homer tells us that the cranes used to
migrate every winter to the Pygmies' country, and their appearance was
the signal of bloody warfare to the puny inhabitants, who had to take up
arms to defend their cornfields against the rapacious strangers. The
Pygmies and their enemies the Cranes form the subject of several works
of art.

Later writers tell of an army of Pygmies which finding Hercules asleep,
made preparations to attack him, as if they were about to attack a city.
But the hero, awaking, laughed at the little warriors, wrapped some of
them up in his lion's skin, and carried them to Eurystheus.

Milton uses the Pygmies for a simile, "Paradise Lost," Book I.:

                           "...like that Pygmaean race  
         Beyond the Indian mount, of fairy elves  
         Whose midnight revels by a forest side,  
         Or fountain, some belated peasant sees  
         (Or dreams he sees), while overhead the moon  
         Sits arbitress, and nearer to the earth  
         Wheels her pale course; they on their mirth and dance  
         Intent, with jocund music charm his ear.  
         At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds."  

### THE GRIFFIN, OR GRYPHON.

The Griffin is a monster with the body of a lion, the head and wings of
an eagle, and back covered with feathers. Like birds it builds its nest,
and instead of an egg lays an agate therein. It has long claws and
talons of such a size that the people of that country make them into
drinking-cups. India was assigned as the native country of the Griffins.
They found gold in the mountains and built their nests of it, for which
reason their nests were very tempting to the hunters, and they were
forced to keep vigilant guard over them. Their instinct led them to know
where buried treasures lay, and they did their best to keep plunderers
at a distance. The Arimaspians, among whom the Griffins flourished, were
a one-eyed people of Scythia.

Milton borrows a simile from the Griffins, "Paradise Lose," Book II.:

        "As when a Gryphon through the wilderness  
         With winged course, o'er hill and moory dale,  
         Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth  
         Had from his wakeful custody purloined  
         The guarded gold," etc.
