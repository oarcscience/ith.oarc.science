# CHAPTER XVII.

## THE GOLDEN FLEECE- MEDEA

### THE GOLDEN FLEECE

IN very ancient times there lived in Thessaly a king and queen name
Athamas and Nephele. They had two children, a boy and a girl. After a
time Athamas grew indifferent to his wife, put her away, and took
another. Nephele suspected danger to her children from the influence of
the step-mother, and took measures to send them out of her reach.
Mercury assisted her, and gave her a ram with a golden fleece, on which
she set the two children, trusting that the ram would convey them to a
place of safety. The ram vaulted into the air with the children on his
back, taking his course to the East, till when crossing the strait that
divides Europe and Asia, the girl, whose name was Helle, fell from his
back into the sea, which from her was called the Hellespont,- now the
Dardanelles. The ram continued his career till he reached the kingdom of
Colchis, on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, where he safely landed
the boy Phryxus, who was hospitably received by AEetes, king of the
country. Phryxus sacrificed the ram to Jupiter, and gave the Golden
Fleece to AEetes, who placed it in a consecrated rove, under the care of
a sleepless dragon.

There was another kingdom in Thessaly near to that of Athamas, and ruled
over by a relative of his. The king AEson, being tired of the cares of
government, surrendered his crown to his brother Pelias on condition
that he should hold it only during the minority of Jason, the son of
AEson. When Jason was grown up and came to demand the crown from his
uncle, Pelias pretended to be willing to yield it, but at the same time
suggested to the young man the glorious adventure of going in quest of
the Golden Fleece, which it was well known was in the kingdom of
Colchis, and was, as Pelias pretended, the rightful property of their
family. Jason was pleased, with the thought and forthwith made
preparations for the expedition. At that time the only species of
navigation known to the Greeks consisted of small boats or canoes
hollowed out from trunks of trees, so that when Jason employed Argus to
build him a vessel capable of containing fifty men, it was considered a
gigantic undertaking. It was accomplished, however, and the vessel named
"Argo," from the name of the builder. Jason sent his invitation to all
the adventurous young men of Greece, and soon found himself at the head
of a band of bold youths, many of whom afterwards were renowned among
the heroes and demigods of Greece. Hercules, Theseus, Orpheus, and
Nestor were among them. They are called the Argonauts, from the name of
their vessel.

The "Argo" with her crew of heroes of Thessaly and having touched at the
Island of Lemnos, thence crossed to Mysia and thence to Thrace. Here
they found the sage Phineus, and from him received instruction as to
their future course. It seems the entrance of the Euxine Sea was impeded
by two small rocky islands, which floated on the surface, and in their
tossings and heavings occasionally came together, crushing and grinding
to atoms any object that might be caught between them. They were called
the Symplegades, or Clashing Islands. Phineus instructed the Argonauts
how to pass this dangerous strait. When they reached the islands they
let go a dove, which took her way between the rocks, and passed in
safety, only losing some feathers of her tail. Jason and his men seized
the favourable moment of the rebound, plied their oars with vigour, and
passed safe through, though the islands closed behind them, and actually
grazed their stern. They now rowed along the shore till they arrived at
the eastern end of the sea, and landed at the kingdom of Colchis.

Jason made known his message to the Colchian king, AEetes, who consented
to give tip the golden fleece if Jason would yoke to the plough two
fire-breathing bulls with brazen feet, and sow the teeth of the dragon
which Cadmus had slain, and from which it was well known that a crop of
armed men would spring up, who would turn their weapons against their
producer. Jason accepted the conditions, and a time was set for making
the experiment. Previously, however, he found means to plead his cause
to Medea, daughter of the king. He promised her marriage, and as they
stood before the altar of Hecate, called the goddess to witness his
oath. Medea yielded, and by her aid, for she was a potent sorceress, he
was furnished with a charm, by which he could encounter safely the
breath of the fire-breathing bulls and the weapons of the armed men.

At the time appointed, the people assembled at the grove of Mars, and
the king assumed his royal seat, while the multitude covered the
hill-sides. The brazen-footed bulls rushed in, breathing fire from their
nostrils that burned up the herbage as they passed. The sound was like
the roar of a furnace, and the smoke like that of water upon quick-lime.
Jason advanced boldly to meet them. His friends, the chosen heroes of
Greece, trembled to behold him. Regardless of the burning breath, he
soothed their rage with his voice, patted their necks with fearless
hand, and adroitly slipped over them the yoke, and compelled them to
drag the plough. The Colchians were amazed; the Greeks shouted for joy.
Jason next proceeded to sow the dragon's teeth and plough them in. And
soon the crop of armed men sprang up, and, wonderful to relate! no
sooner had they reached the surface than they began to brandish their
weapons and rush upon Jason. The Greeks trembled for their hero, and
even she who had provided him a way of safety and taught him how to use
it, Medea herself, grew pale with fear. Jason for a time kept his
assailants at bay with his sword and shield, till, finding their numbers
overwhelming, he resorted to the charm which Medea had taught him,
seized a stone and threw it in the midst of his foes. They immediately
turned their arms against one another, and soon there was not one of the
dragon's brood left alive. The Greeks embraced their hero, and Medea, if
she dared, would have embraced him too.

It remained to lull to sleep the dragon that guarded the fleece, and
this was done by scattering over him a few drops of a preparation which
Medea had supplied. At the smell he relaxed his rage, stood for a moment
motionless, then shut those great round eyes, that had never been known
to shut before, and turned over on his side, fast asleep. Jason seized
the fleece and with his friends and Medea accompanying, hastened to
their vessel before AEetes the king could arrest their departure, and
made the best of their way back to Thessaly, where they arrived safe,
and Jason delivered the fleece to Pelias, and dedicated the "Argo" to
Neptune. What became of the fleece afterwards we do not know, but
perhaps it was found after all, like many other golden prizes, not worth
the trouble it had cost to procure it.

This is one of those mythological tales, says a late writer, in which
there is reason to believe that a substratum of truth exists, though
overlaid by a mass of fiction. It probably was the first important
maritime expedition, and like the first attempts of the kind of all
nations, as we know from history, was probably of a half-piratical
character. If rich spoils were the result it was enough to give rise to
the idea of the golden fleece.

Another suggestion of a learned mythologist, Bryant, is that it is a
corrupt tradition of the story of Noah and the ark. The name "Argo"
seems to countenance this, and the incident of the dove is another
confirmation.

Pope, in his "Ode on St. Cecilia's Day," thus celebrates the launching
of the ship "Argo," and the power of the music of Orpheus, whom he calls
the Thracian:

          "So when the first bold vessel dared the seas,  
             High on the stern the Thracian raised his strain,  
           While Argo saw her kindred trees  
             Descend from Pelion to the main.  
           Transported demigods stood round,  
           And men grew heroes at the sound."  

In Dyer's poem of "The Fleece" there is an account of the ship "Argo"
and her crew, which gives a good picture of this primitive maritime
adventure:

          "From every region of AEgea's shore  
           The brave assembled; those illustrious twins  
           Castor and Pollux; Orpheus, tuneful bard;  
           Zetes and Calais, as the wind in speed;  
           Strong Hercules and many a chief renowned.  
           On deep Ioclos' sandy shore they thronged,  
           Gleaming in armour, ardent of exploits;  
           And soon, the laurel cord and the huge stone  
           Uplifting to the deck, unmoored the bark;  
           Whose keel of wondrous length the skilful hand  
           Of Argus fashioned for the proud attempt;  
           And in the extended keel a lofty mast  
           Upraised, and sails full swelling; to the chiefs  
           Unwonted objects. Now first, now they learned  
           Their bolder steerage over ocean wave,  
           Led by the golden stars, as Chiron's art  
           Had marked the sphere celestial," etc.  

Hercules left the expedition at Mysia, for Hylas, a youth beloved by
him, having gone for water, was laid hold of and kept by the nymphs of
the spring, who were fascinated by his beauty. Hercules went in quest of
the lad, and while he was absent the "Argo" put to sea and left him.
Moore, in one of his songs, makes a beautiful allusion to this incident:

        "When Hylas was sent with his urn to the fount,  
           Through fields of light and with heart full of play,  
         Light rambled the boy over meadow and mount,  
           And neglected his task for the flowers in the way.  
        "Thus many like me, who in youth should have tasted  
           The fountain that runs by Philosophy's shrine,  
         Their time with the flowers on the margin have wasted,  
           And left their light urns all as empty as mine."  

### MEDEA AND AESON

Amid the rejoicings for the recovery of the Golden Fleece, Jason felt
that one thing was wanting, the presence of AEson, his father, who was
prevented by his age and infirmities from taking part in them. Jason
said to Medea, "My spouse, would that your arts, whose power I have seen
so mighty for my aid, could do me one further service, take some years
from my life and add them to my father's." Medea replied, "Not at such a
cost shall it be done, but if my art avails me, his life shall be
lengthened without abridging yours." The next full moon she issued forth
alone, while all creatures slept; not a breath stirred the foliage, and
all was still, To the stars she addressed her incantations, and to the
moon; to Hecate,\* the goddess of the under-world, and to Tellus the
goddess of the earth, by whose power plants potent for enchantment are
produced. She invoked the gods of the woods and caverns, of mountains
and valleys, of lakes and rivers, of winds and vapours. While she spoke
the stars shone brighter, and presently a chariot descended through the
air, drawn by flying serpents. She ascended it, and borne aloft made her
way to distant regions, where potent plants grew which she knew how to
select for her purpose. Nine nights she employed in her search, and
during that time came not within the doors of her palace nor under any
roof, and shunned all intercourse with mortals.

\* Hecate was a mysterious divinity sometimes identified with Diana and
sometimes with Proserpine. As Diana represents the moonlight splendour
of night, so Hecate represents its darkness and terrors. She was the
goddess of sorcery and witchcraft, and was believed to wander by night
along the earth, seen only by the dogs, whose barking told her approach.

She next erected two altars, the one to Hecate, the other to Hebe, the
goddess of youth, and sacrificed a black sheep, pouring libations of
milk and wine. She implored Pluto and his stolen bride that they would
not hasten to take the old man's life. Then she directed that AEson
should be led forth, and having thrown him into a deep sleep by a charm,
had him laid on a bed of herbs, like one dead. Jason and all others were
kept away from the place, that no profane eyes might look upon her
mysteries. Then, with streaming hair, she thrice moved round the altars,
dipped flaming twigs in the blood, and laid them thereon to burn.
Meanwhile the cauldron with its contents was got ready. In it she put
magic herbs, with seeds and flowers of acrid juice, stones from the
distant east, and sand from the shore of all-surrounding ocean; hoar
frost, gathered by moonlight, a screech owl's head and wings, and the
entrails of a wolf. She added fragments of the shells of tortoises, and
the liver of stags- animals tenacious of life- and the head and beak of
a crow, that outlives nine generations of men. These with many other
things "without a name" she boiled together for her purposed work,
stirring them up with a dry olive branch; and behold! the branch when
taken out instantly became green, and before long was covered with
leaves and a plentiful growth of young olives; and as the liquor boiled
and bubbled, and sometimes ran over, the grass wherever the sprinklings
fell shot forth with a verdure like that of spring.

Seeing that all was ready, Medea cut the throat of the old man and let
out all his blood, and poured into his mouth and into his wound the
juices of her cauldron. As soon as he had completely imbibed them, his
hair and beard laid by their whiteness and assumed the blackness of
youth; his paleness and emaciation were gone; his veins were full of
blood, his limbs of vigour and robustness. AEson is amazed at himself,
and remembers that such as he now is, he was in his youthful days, forty
years before.

Medea used her arts here for a good purpose, but not so in another
instance, where she made them the instruments of revenge. Pelias, our
readers will recollect, was the usurping uncle of Jason, and had kept
him out of his kingdom. Yet he must have had some good qualities, for
his daughters loved him, and when they saw what Medea had done for
AEson, they wished her to do the same for their father. Medea pretended
to consent, and prepared her cauldron as before. At her request an old
sheep was brought and plunged into the cauldron. Very soon a bleating
was heard in the kettle, and when the cover was removed, a lamb jumped
forth and ran frisking away into the meadow. The daughters of Pelias saw
the experiment with delight, and appointed a time for their father to
undergo the same operation. But Medea prepared her cauldron for him in a
very different way. She put in only water and a few simple herbs. In the
night she with the sisters entered the bed chamber of the old king,
while he and his guards slept soundly under the influence of a spell
cast upon them by Medea. The daughters stood by the bedside with their
weapons drawn, but hesitated to strike, till Medea chid their
irresolution. Then turning away their faces, and giving random blows
they smote him with their weapons. He, starting from his sleep, cried
out, "My daughters, what are you doing? Will you kill your father?"
Their hearts failed them and their weapons fell from their hands, but
Medea struck him a fatal blow, and prevented his saying more.

Then they placed him in the cauldron, and Medea hastened to depart in
her serpent-drawn chariot before they discovered her treachery or their
vengeance would have been terrible. She escaped, however, but had little
enjoyment of the fruits of her crime. Jason, for whom she had done so
much, wishing to marry Creusa, princess of Corinth, put away Medea. She,
enraged at his ingratitude, called on the gods for vengeance, sent a
poisoned robe as a gift to the bride, and then killing her own children,
and setting fire to the palace, mounted her serpent-drawn chariot and
fled to Athens, where she married King AEgeus, the father of Theseus,
and we shall meet her again when we come to the adventures of that hero.

The incantations of Medea will remind the reader of those of the witches
in "Macbeth." The following lines are those which seem most strikingly
to recall the ancient model:

            "Round about the cauldron go;  
             In the poisoned entrails throw.  
             Fillet of a fenny snake  
             In the cauldron boil and bake;  
             Eye of newt and toe of frog,  
             Wool of bat and tongue of dog,  
             Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,  
             Lizard's leg and howlet's wing;  
             Maw of ravening salt-sea shark,  
             Root of hemlock digged in the dark," etc.  
                                      Macbeth, Act IV. Scene I.  

And again:

               Macbeth.- What is't you do?  
               Witches.- A deed without a name.  

There is another story of Medea almost too revolting for record even of
a sorceress, a class of persons to whom both ancient and modern poets
have been accustomed to attribute every degree of atrocity. In her
flight from Colchis she had taken her young brother Absyrtus with her.
Finding the pursuing vessels of AEetes gaining upon the Argonauts, she
caused the lad to be killed and his limbs to be strewn over the sea.
AEetes on reaching the place found these sorrowful traces of his
murdered son; but while he tarried to collect the scattered fragments
and bestow upon them an honourable interment, the Argonauts escaped.

In the poems of Campbell will be found a translation of one of the
choruses of the tragedy of "Medea," where the poet Euripides has taken
advantage of the occasion to pay a glowing tribute to Athens, his native
city. It begins thus:

          "O haggard queen! to Athens dost thou guide  
             Thy glowing chariot, steeped in kindred gore;  
           Or seek to hide thy damned parricide  
             Where peace and justice dwell for evermore?"
