<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">PROSERPINE- GLAUCUS AND SCYLLA.</H2>

<P>WHEN Jupiter and his brothers had defeated the Titars and banished
them to Tartarus, a new enemy rose up against the gods. They were
the giants Typhon, Briareus, Enceladus, and others. Some of them had a
hundred arms, others breathed out fire. They were finally subdued
and buried alive under Mount AEtna, where they still sometimes
struggle to get loose, and shake the whole island with earthquakes.
Their breath comes up through the mountain, and is what men call the
eruption of the volcano.
</P>
<P>The fall of these monsters shook the earth, so that Pluto was
alarmed, and feared that his kingdom would be laid open to the light
of day. Under this apprehension, he mounted his chariot, drawn by
black horses, and took a circuit of inspection to satisfy himself of
the extent of the damage. While he was thus engaged, Venus, who was
sitting on Mount Eryx playing with her boy Cupid, espied him, and
said, "My son, take your darts with which you conquer all, even Jove
himself, and send one into the breast of yonder dark monarch, who
rules the realm of Tartarus. Why should he alone escape? Seize the
opportunity to extend your empire and mine. Do you not see that even
in heaven some despise our power? Minerva the wise, and Diana the
huntress, defy us; and there is that daughter of Ceres, who
threatens to follow their example. Now do you, if you have any
regard for your own interest or mine, join these two in one." The
boy unbound his quiver, and selected his sharpest and truest arrow;
then straining the bow against his knee, he attached the string,
and, having made ready, shot the arrow with its barbed point right
into the heart of Pluto.
</P>
<P>In the vale of Enna there is a lake embowered in woods, which screen
it from the fervid rays of the sun, while the moist ground is
covered with flowers, and Spring reigns perpetual. Here Proserpine was
playing with her companions, gathering lilies and violets, and filling
her basket and her apron with them, when Pluto saw her, loved her, and
carried her off. She screamed for help to her mother and companions;
and when in her fright she dropped the corners of her apron and let
the flowers fall, childlike she felt the loss of them as an addition
to her grief. The ravisher urged on his steeds, calling them each by
name, and throwing loose over their heads and necks his
iron-coloured reins. When he reached the River Cyane, and it opposed
his passage, he struck the river-bank with his trident, and the
earth opened and gave him a passage to Tartarus.
</P>
<P>Ceres sought her daughter all the world over. Bright-haired
Aurora, when she came forth in the morning, and Hesperus when he led
out the stars in the evening, found her still busy in the search.
But it was all unavailing. At length, weary and sad, she sat down upon
a stone, and continued sitting nine days and nights, in the open
air, under the sunlight and moonlight and falling showers. It was
where now stands the city of Eleusis, then the home of an old man
named Celeus. He was out on the field, gathering acorns and
blackberries, and sticks for his fire. His little girl was driving
home their two goats, and as she passed the goddess, who appeared in
the guise of an old woman, she said to her, "Mother,"- and the name
was sweet to the ears of Ceres,- "why do you sit here alone upon the
rocks?" The old man also stopped, though his load was heavy, and
begged her to come into his cottage, such as it was. She declined, and
he urged her. "Go in peace," she replied, "and be happy in your
daughter; I have lost mine." As she spoke, tears- or something like
tears, for the gods never weep- fell down her cheeks upon her bosom.
The compassionate old man and his child wept with her. Then said he,
"Come with us, and despise not our humble roof; so may your daughter
be restored to you in safety." "Lead on," said she, "I cannot resist
that appeal!" So she rose from the stone and went with them. As they
walked he told her that his only son, a little boy, lay very sick,
feverish, and sleepless. She stooped and gathered some poppies. As
they entered the cottage, they found all in great distress, for the
boy seemed past hope of recovery. Metanira, his mother, received her
kindly, and the goddess stooped and kissed the lips of the sick child.
Instantly the paleness left his face, and healthy vigour returned to
his body. The whole family were delighted- that is, the father,
mother, and little girl, for they were all; they had no servants. They
spread the table, and put upon it curds and cream, apples, and honey
in the comb. While they ate, Ceres mingled poppy juice in the milk
of the boy. When night came and all was still, she arose, and taking
the sleeping boy, moulded his limbs with her hands, and uttered over
him three times a solemn charm, then went and laid him in the ashes.
His mother, who had been watching what her guest was doing, sprang
forward with a cry and snatched the child from the fire. Then Ceres
assumed her own form, and a divine splendour shone all around. While
they were overcome with astonishment, she said, "Mother, you have been
cruel in your fondness to your son. I would have made him immortal,
but you have frustrated my attempt. Nevertheless, he shall be great
and useful. He shall teach men the use of the plough, and the
rewards which labour can win from the cultivated soil." So saying, she
wrapped a cloud about her, and mounting her chariot rode away.
</P>
<P>Ceres continued her search for her daughter, passing from land to
land, and across seas and rivers, till at length she returned to
Sicily, whence she at first set out, and stood by the banks of the
River Cyane, where Pluto made himself a passage with his prize to
his own dominions. The river nymph would have told the goddess all she
had witnessed, but dared not, for fear of Pluto; so she only
ventured to take up the girdle which Proserpine had dropped in her
flight, and waft it to the feet of the mother. Ceres, seeing this, was
no longer in doubt of her loss, but she did not yet know the cause,
and laid the blame on the innocent land. "Ungrateful soil," said
she, "which I have endowed with fertility and clothed with herbage and
nourishing grain, no more shall you enjoy my favours." Then the cattle
died, the plough broke in the furrow, the seed failed to come up;
there was too much sun, there was too much rain; the birds stole the
seeds- thistles and brambles were the only growth. Seeing this, the
fountain Arethusa interceded for the land. "Goddess," said she, "blame
not the land; it opened unwillingly to yield a passage to your
daughter. I can tell you of her fate, for I have seen her. This is not
my native country; I came hither from Elis. I was a woodland nymph,
and delighted in the chase. They praised my beauty, but I cared
nothing for it, and rather boasted of my hunting exploits. One day I
was returning from the wood, heated with exercise, when I came to a
stream silently flowing, so clear that you might count the pebbles
on the bottom. The willows shaded it, and the grassy bank sloped
down to the water's edge. I approached, I touched the water with my
foot. I stepped in knee-deep, and not content with that, I laid my
garments on the willows and went in. While I sported in the water, I
heard an indistinct murmur coming up as out of the depths of the
stream; and made haste to escape to the nearest bank. The voice
said, 'Why do you fly, Arethusa? I am Alpheus, the god of this
stream.' I ran, he pursued; he was not more swift than I, but he was
stronger, and gained upon me, as my strength failed. At last,
exhausted, I cried for help to Diana. 'Help me, goddess! help your
votary!' The goddess heard, and wrapped me suddenly in a thick
cloud. The river god looked now this way and now that, and twice
came close to me, but could not find me. 'Arethusa! Arethusa!' he
cried. Oh, how I trembled,- like a lamb that hears the wolf growling
outside the fold. A cold sweat came over me, my hair flowed down in
streams; where my foot stood there was a pool. In short, in less
time than it takes to tell it, I became a fountain. But in this form
Alpheus knew me and attempted to mingle his stream with mine. Diana
cleft the ground, and I, endeavouring to escape him, plunged into
the cavern, and through the bowels of the earth came out here in
Sicily. While I passed through the lower parts of the earth, I saw
your Proserpine. She was sad, but no longer showing alarm in her
countenance. Her look was such as became a queen- the queen of Erebus;
the powerful bride of the monarch of the realms of the dead."
</P>
<P>When Ceres heard this, she stood for a while like one stupefied;
then turned her chariot towards heaven, and hastened to present
herself before the throne of Jove. She told the story of her
bereavement, and implored Jupiter to interfere to procure the
restitution of her daughter. Jupiter consented on one condition,
namely, that Proserpine should not during her stay in the lower
world have taken any food; otherwise, the Fates forbade her release.
Accordingly, Mercury was sent, accompanied by Spring, to demand
Proserpine of Pluto. The wily monarch consented; but, alas! the maiden
had taken a pomegranate which Pluto offered her, and had sucked the
sweet pulp from a few of the seeds. This was enough to prevent her
complete release; but a compromise was made, by which she was to
pass half the time with her mother, and the rest with her husband
Pluto.
</P>
<P>Ceres allowed herself to be pacified with this arrangement, and
restored the earth to her favour. Now she remembered Celeus and his
family, and her promise to his infant son Triptolemus. When the boy
grew up, she taught him the use of the plough, and how to sow the
seed. She took him in her chariot, drawn by winged dragons, through
all the countries of the earth, imparting to mankind valuable
grains, and the knowledge of agriculture. After his return,
Triptolemus built a magnificent temple to Ceres in Eleusis, and
established the worship of the goddess, under the name of the
Eleusinian mysteries, which, in the splendour and solemnity of their
observance, surpassed all other religious celebrations among the
Greeks.
</P>
<P>There can be little doubt of this story of Ceres and Proserpine
being an allegory. Proserpine signifies the seed-corn which when
cast into the ground lies there concealed- that is, she is carried off
by the god of the underworld. It reappears- that is, Proserpine is
restored to her mother. Spring leads her back to the light of day.

</P>
<P>Milton alludes to the story of Proserpine in "Paradise Lost," Book
IV.:

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Not that fair field<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Enna where Proserpine gathering flowers,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek her through the world,-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...might with this Paradise<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Eden strive."<BR>

<P>Hood, in his "Ode to Melancholy," uses the same allusion very
beautifully:

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forgive, if somewhile I forget,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In woe to come the present bliss;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As frighted Proserpine let fall<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her flowers at the sight of Dis."<BR>

<P>The River Alpheus does in fact disappear underground, in part of its
course, finding its way through subterranean channels till it again
appears on the surface. It was said that the Sicilian fountain
Arethusa was the same stream, which, after passing under the sea, came
up again in Sicily. Hence the story ran that a cup thrown into the
Alpheus appeared again in Arethusa. It is this fable of the
underground course of Alpheus that Coleridge alludes to in his poem of
"Kubla Khan":

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stately pleasure-dome decree,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through caverns measureless to man,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to a sunless sea."<BR>

<P>In one of Moore's juvenile poems he thus alludes to the same
story, and to the practice of throwing garlands or other light objects
on his stream to be carried downward by it, and afterwards
reproduced at its emerging:

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O my beloved, how divinely sweet<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the pure joy when kindred spirits meet!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like him the river god, whose waters flow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With love their only light, through caves below,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wafting in triumph all the flowery braids<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And festal rings, with which Olympic maids<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have decked his current, as an offering meet<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lay at Arethusa's shining feet.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think, when he meets at last his fountain bride,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What perfect love must thrill the blended tide!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each lost in each, till mingling into one,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lot the same for shadow or for sun,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A type of true love, to the deep they run."<BR>

<P>The following extract from Moore's "Rhymes on the Road" gives an
account of a celebrated picture by Albano, at Milan, called a Dance of
Loves:

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis for the theft of Enna's flower from earth<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These urchins celebrate their dance of mirth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the green tree, like fays upon a heath;-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those that are nearest Linked in order bright,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheek after cheek, like rosebuds in a wreath;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those more distant showing from beneath<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others' wings their little eyes of light.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While see! among the clouds, their eldest brother,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just flown up, tells with a smile of bliss,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prank of Pluto to his charmed mother,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who turns to greet the tidings with a kiss."<BR>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">GLAUCUS AND SCYLLA.</H3>

<P>Glaucus was a fisherman. One day he had drawn his nets to land,
and had taken a great many fishes of various kinds. So he emptied
his net, and. proceeded to sort the fishes on the grass. The place
where he stood was a beautiful island in the river, a solitary spot,
uninhabited, and not used for pasturage of cattle, not ever visited by
any but himself. On a sudden, the fishes, which had been laid on the
grass, began to revive and move their fins as if they were in the
water; and while he looked on astonished, they one and all moved off
to the water, plunged in, and swam away. He did not know what to
make of this, whether some god had done it or some secret power in the
herbage. "What herb has such a power?" he exclaimed; and gathering
some of it, he tasted it. Scarce had the juices of the plant reached
his palate when he found himself agitated with a longing desire for
the water. He could no longer restrain himself, but bidding farewell
to earth, he plunged into the stream. The gods of the water received
him graciously, and admitted him to the honour of their society.
They obtained the consent of Oceanus and Tethys, the sovereigns of the
sea, that all that was mortal in him should be washed away. A
hundred rivers poured their waters over him. Then he lost all sense of
his former nature and all consciousness. When he recovered, he found
himself changed in form and mind. His hair was sea-green, and
trailed behind him on the water; his shoulders grew broad, and what
had been thighs and legs assumed the form of a fish's tail. The
sea-gods complimented him on the change of his appearance, and he
fancied himself rather a good-looking personage.
</P>
<P>One day Glaucus saw the beautiful maiden Scylla, the favourite of
the water-nymphs, rambling on the shore, and when she had found a
sheltered nook, laving her limbs in the clear water. He fell in love
with her, and showing himself on the surface, spoke to her, saying
such things as he thought most likely to win her to stay; for she
turned to run immediately on the sight of him, and ran till she had
gained a cliff overlooking the sea. Here she stopped and turned
round to see whether it was a god or a sea animal, and observed with
wonder his shape and colour. Glaucus partly emerging from the water,
and supporting himself against a rock, said, "Maiden, I am no monster,
nor a sea animal, but a god: and neither Proteus nor Triton ranks
higher than I. Once I was a mortal, and followed the sea for a living;
but now I belong wholly to it." Then he told the story of his
metamorphosis, and how he had been promoted to his present dignity,
and added, "But what avails all this if it fails to move your
heart?" He was going on in this strain, but Scylla turned and hastened
away.
</P>
<P>Glaucus was in despair, but it occurred to him to consult the
enchantress Circe. Accordingly he repaired to her island- the same
where afterwards Ulysses landed, as we shall see in one of our later
stories. After mutual salutations, he said, "Goddess, I entreat your
pity; you alone can relieve the pain I suffer. The power of herbs I
know as well as any one, for it is to them I owe my change of form.
I love Scylla. I am ashamed to tell you how I have sued and promised
to her, and how scornfully she has treated me. I beseech you to use
your incantations, or potent herbs, if they are more prevailing, not
to cure me of my love,- for that I do not wish,- but to make her share
it and yield me a like return." To which Circe replied, for she was
not insensible to the attractions of the sea-green deity, "You had
better pursue a willing object; you are worthy to be sought, instead
of having to seek in vain. Be not diffident, know your own worth. I
protest to you that even I, goddess though I be, and learned in the
virtues of plants and spells, should not know how to refuse you. If
she scorns you scorn her; meet one who is ready to meet you half
way, and thus make a due return to both at once." To these words
Glaucus replied, "Sooner shall trees grow at the bottom of the
ocean, and sea-weed on the top of the mountains, than I will cease
to love Scylla, and her alone."
</P>
<P>The goddess was indignant, but she could not punish him, neither did
she wish to do so, for she liked him too well; so she turned all her
wrath against her rival, poor Scylla. She took plants of poisonous
powers and mixed them together, with incantations and charms. Then she
passed through the crowd of gambolling beasts, the victims of her art,
and proceeded to the coast of Sicily, where Scylla lived. There was
a little bay on the shore to which Scylla used to resort, in the
heat of the day, to breathe the air of the sea, and to bathe in its
waters. Here the goddess poured her poisonous mixture, and muttered
over it incantations of mighty power. Scylla came as usual and plunged
into the water up to her waist. What was her horror to perceive a
brood of serpents and barking monsters surrounding her! At first she
could not imagine they were a part of herself, and tried to run from
them, and to drive them away; but as she ran she carried them with
her, and when she tried to touch her limbs, she found her hands
touch only the yawning jaws of monsters. Scylla remained rooted to the
spot. Her temper grew as ugly as her form, and she took pleasure in
devouring hapless mariners who came within her grasp. Thus she
destroyed six of the companions of Ulysses, and tried to wreck the
ships of AEneas, till at last she was turned into a rock, and as
such still continues to be a terror to mariners.

</P>
<P>Keats, in his "Endymion," has given a new version of the ending of
"Glaucus and Scylla." Glaucus consents to Circe's blandishments,
till he by chance is witness to her transactions with her beasts.
Disgusted with her treachery and cruelty, he tries to escape from her,
but is taken and brought back, when with reproaches she banishes
him, sentencing him to pass a thousand years in decrepitude and
pain. He returns to the sea, and there finds the body of Scylla,
whom the goddess has not transformed but drowned. Glaucus learns
that his destiny is that, if he passes his thousand years in
collecting all the bodies of drowned lovers, a youth beloved of the
gods will appear and help him. Endymion fulfils this prophecy, and
aids in restoring Glaucus to youth, and Scylla and all the drowned
lovers to life.
</P>
<P>The following is Glaucus's account of his feelings after his
"sea-change":

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I plunged for life or death. To interknit<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might seem a work of pain; so not enough<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetful utterly of self-intent,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then like a new-fledged bird that first doth show<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried in fear the pinions of my will.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas freedom! and at once I visited<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceaseless wonders of his ocean-bed,"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc.- Keats.<BR>
