# CHAPTER XXII.

## THE RURAL DEITIES- ERISICHTHON- RHOECUS- THE

### WATER DEITIES- THE CAMENAE- THE WINDS.

### THE RURAL DEITIES.

PAN, the god of woods and fields, of flocks and shepherds, dwelt in
grottos, wandered on the mountains and in valleys, and amused himself
with the chase or in leading the dances of the nymphs. He was fond of
music, and was, as we have seen, the inventor of the syrinx, or
shepherd's pipe, which he himself played in a masterly manner. Pan, like
other gods who dwelt in forests, was dreaded by those whose occupations
caused them to pass through the woods by night, for the gloom and
loneliness of such scenes dispose the mind to superstitious fears. Hence
sudden fright without any visible cause was ascribed to Pan, and called
a Panic terror.

As the name of the god signifies all, Pan came to be considered a symbol
of the universe and personification of Nature; and later still to be
regarded as a representative of all the gods and of heathenism itself.

Sylvanus and Faunus were Latin divinities, whose characteristics are so
nearly the same as those of Pan that we may safely consider them as the
same personage under different names.

The wood-nymphs, Pan's partners in the dance, were but one class of
nymphs. There were besides them the Naiads, who presided over brooks and
fountains, the Oreads, nymphs of mountains and grottos, and the Nereids,
sea-nymphs. The three last named were immortal, but the wood-nymphs,
called Dryads or Hamadryads, were believed to perish with the trees
which had been their abode and with which they had come into existence.
It was therefore an impious act wantonly to destroy a tree, and in some
aggravated cases was severely punished, as in the instance of
Erisichthon, which we are about to record.

Milton in his glowing description of the early creation, thus alludes to
Pan as the personification of Nature:

          "...Universal Pan,  
           Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,  
           Led on the eternal spring."  

And describing Eve's abode:

          "...In shadier bower,  
           More sacred or sequestered, though but feigned,  
           Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor nymph  
           Nor Faunus haunted."  
                                      Paradise Lost, B. IV.  

It was a pleasing trait in the old Paganism that it loved to trace in
every operation of nature the agency of deity. The imagination nation of
the Greeks peopled all the regions of earth and sea with divinities, to
whose agency it attributed those phenomena which our philosophy ascribes
to the operation of the laws of nature. Sometimes in our poetical moods
we feel disposed to regret the change, and to think that the heart has
lost as much as the head has gained by the substitution. The poet
Wordsworth thus strongly expresses this sentiment:

          "...Great God, I'd rather be  
           A Pagan, suckled in a creed outworn,  
           So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,  
           Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;  
           Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea  
           And hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn."  

Schiller, in his poem "Die Gotter Griechenlands," expresses his regret
for the overthrow of the beautiful mythology of ancient times in a way
which has called forth an answer from a Christian poet, Mrs. E. Barrett
Browning, in her poem called "The Dead Pan." The two following verses
are a specimen:

              "By your beauty which confesses  
               Some chief Beauty conquering you,  
               By our grand heroic guesses  
               Through your falsehood at the True,  
               We will weep not! earth shall roll  
               Heir to each god's aureole,  
                                   And Pan is dead.  
              "Earth outgrows the mythic fancies  
               Sung beside her in her youth;  
               And those debonaire romances  
               Sound but dull beside the truth.  
               Phoebus' chariot course is run!  
               Look up, poets, to the sun!  
                                  Pan, Pan is dead."  

These lines are founded on an early Christian tradition that when the
heavenly host told the shepherds at Bethlehem of the birth of Christ, a
deep groan, heard through all the isles of Greece, told that the great
Pan was dead, and that all the royalty of Olympus was dethroned and the
several deities were sent wandering in cold and darkness. So Milton in
his "Hymn on the Nativity":

          "The lonely mountains o'er  
           And the resounding shore,  
             A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;  
           From haunted spring and dale,  
           Edged with poplar pale,  
             The parting Genius is with sighing sent:  
           With flower-enwoven tresses torn,  
           The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn."  

### ERISICHTHON.

Erisichthon was a profane person and a despiser of the gods, On one
occasion he presumed to violate with the axe a grove sacred to Ceres.
There stood in this grove a venerable oak, so large that it seemed a
wood in itself, its ancient trunk towering aloft, whereon votive
garlands were often hung and inscriptions carved expressing the
gratitude of suppliants to the nymph of the tree. Often had the Dryads
danced round it hand in hand. Its trunk measured fifteen cubits round,
and it overtopped the other trees as they overtopped the shrubbery. But
for all that, Erisichthon saw no reason why he should spare it and he
ordered his servants to cut it down. When he saw them hesitate he
snatched an axe from one, and thus impiously exclaimed: "I care not
whether it be a tree beloved of the goddess or not; were it the goddess
herself it should come down if it stood in my way." So saying, he lifted
the axe and the oak seemed to shudder and utter a groan. When the first
blow fell upon the trunk blood flowed from the wound. All the bystanders
were horror-struck, and one of them ventured to remonstrate and hold
back the fatal axe. Erisichthon, with a scornful look, said to him,
"Receive the reward of your piety;" and turned against him the weapon
which he had held aside from the tree, gashed his body with many wounds,
and cut off his head. Then from the midst of the oak came a voice, "I
who dwell in this tree am a nymph beloved of Ceres, and dying by your
hands forewarn you that punishment awaits you." He desisted not from his
crime, and at last the tree, sundered by repeated blows and drawn by
ropes, fell with a crash and prostrated a great part of the grove in its
fall.

The Dryads, in dismay at the loss of their companion and at seeing the
pride of the forest laid low, went in a body to Ceres, all clad in
garments of mourning, and invoked punishment upon Erisichthon. She
nodded her assent, and as she bowed her head the grain ripe for harvest
in the laden fields bowed also. She planned a punishment so dire that
one would pity him, if such a culprit as he could be pitied- to deliver
him over to Famine. As Ceres herself could not approach Famine, for the
Fates have ordained that these two goddesses shall never come together,
she called an Oread from her mountain and spoke to her in these words:
"There is a place in the farthest part of ice-clad Scythia, a sad and
sterile region without trees and without crops. Cold dwells there, and
Fear and Shuddering, and Famine. Go and tell the last to take possession
of the bowels of Erisichthon. Let not abundance subdue her, nor the
power of my gifts drive her away. Be not alarmed at the distance" (for
Famine dwells very far from Ceres), "but take my chariot. The dragons
are fleet and obey the rein, and will take you through the air in a
short time." So she gave her the reins, and she drove away and soon
reached Scythia. On arriving at Mount Caucasus she stopped the dragons
and found Famine in a stony field, pulling up with teeth and claws the
scanty herbage. Her hair was rough, her eyes sunk, her face pale, her
lips blanched, her jaws covered with dust, and her skin drawn tight, so
as to show all her bones. As the Oread saw her afar off (for she did not
dare to come near), she delivered the commands of Ceres; and, though she
stopped as short a time as possible, and kept her distance as well as
she could, yet she began to feel hungry, and turned the dragons' heads
and drove back to Thessaly.

Famine obeyed the commands of Ceres and sped through the air to the
dwelling of Erisichthon, entered the bedchamber of the guilty man, and
found him asleep. She enfolded him with her wings and breathed herself
into him, infusing her poison into his veins. Having discharged her
task, she hastened to leave the land of plenty and returned to her
accustomed haunts. Erisichthon still slept, and in his dreams craved
food, and moved his jaws as if eating. When he awoke, his hunger was
raging. Without a moment's delay he would have food set before him, of
whatever kind earth, sea, or air produces; and complained of hunger even
while he ate. What would have sufficed for a city or a nation, was not
enough for him. The more he ate the more he craved. His hunger was like
the sea, which receives all the rivers, yet is never filled; or like
fire, that burns all the fuel that is heaped upon it, yet is still
voracious for more.

His property rapidly diminished under the unceasing demands of his
appetite, but his hunger continued unabated. At length he had spent all
and had only his daughter left, a daughter worthy of a better parent.
Her too he sold. She scorned to be a slave of a purchaser and as she
stood by the seaside raised her hands in prayer to Neptune. He heard her
prayer, and though her new master was not far off and had his eye upon
her a moment before, Neptune changed her form and made her assume that
of a fisherman busy at his occupation. Her master, looking for her and
seeing her in her altered form, addressed her and said, "Good fisherman,
whither went the maiden whom I saw just now, with hair dishevelled and
in humble garb, standing about where you stand? Tell me truly; so may
your luck be good and not a fish nibble at your hook and get away." She
perceived that her prayer was answered and rejoiced inwardly at hearing
herself inquired of about herself. She replied, "Pardon me, stranger,
but I have been so intent upon my line that I have seen nothing else;
but I wish I may never catch another fish if I believe any woman or
other person except myself to have been hereabouts for some time." He
was deceived and went his way, thinking his slave had escaped. Then she
resumed her own form. Her father was well pleased to find her still with
him, and the money too that he got by the sale of her; so he sold her
again. But she was changed by the favour of Neptune as often as she was
sold, now into a horse, now a bird, now an ox, and now a stag- got away
from her purchasers and came home. By this base method the starving
father procured food; but not enough for his wants, and at last hunger
compelled him to devour his limbs, and he strove to nourish his body by
eating his body, till death relieved him from the vengeance of Ceres.

### RHOECUS.

The Hamadryads could appreciate services as well as punish injuries. The
story of Rhoecus proves this. Rhoecus, happening to see an oak just
ready to fall, ordered his servants to prop it up. The nymph, who had
been on the point of perishing with the tree, came and expressed her
gratitude to him for having saved her life and bade him ask what reward
he would. Rhoecus boldly asked her love and the nymph yielded to his
desire. She at the same time charged him to be constant and told him
that a bee should be her messenger and let him know when she would admit
his society. One time the bee came to Rhoecus when he was playing at
draughts and he carelessly brushed it away. This so incensed the nymph
that she deprived him of sight.

Our countryman, J. R. Lowell, has taken this story for the subject of
one of his shorter poems. He introduces it thus:

          "Hear now this fairy legend of old Greece,  
           As full of freedom, youth and beauty still,  
           As the immortal freshness of that grace  
           Carved for all ages on some Attic frieze."  

### THE WATER DEITIES.

Oceanus and Tethys were the Titans who ruled over the watery elements.
When Jove and his brothers overthrew the Titans and assumed their power,
Neptune and Amphitrite succeeded to the dominion of the waters in place
of Oceanus and Tethys.

### NEPTUNE.

Neptune was the chief of the water deities. The symbol of his power was
the trident, or spear with three points, with which he used to shatter
rocks, to call forth or subdue storms, to shake the shores and the like.
He created the horse and was the patron of horse races. His own horses
had brazen hoofs and golden manes. They drew his chariot over the sea,
which became smooth before him, while the monsters of the deep gambolled
about his path.

### AMPHITRITE.

Amphitrite was the wife of Neptune. She was the daughter of Nereus and
Doris, and the mother of Triton. Neptune, to pay his court to
Amphitrite, came riding on a dolphin. Having won her he rewarded the
dolphin by placing him among the stars.

### NEREUS AND DORIS.

Nereus and Doris were the parents of the Nereids, the most celebrated of
whom were Amphitrite, Thetis, the mother of Achilles, and Galatea, who
was loved by the Cyclops Polyphemus: Nereus was distinguished for his
knowledge and his love of truth and justice, whence he was termed an
elder; the gift of prophecy was also assigned to him.

### TRITON AND PROTEUS.

Triton was the son of Neptune and Amphitrite, and the poets made him his
father's trumpeter. Proteus was also a son of Neptune. He, like Nereus,
is styled a sea-elder for his wisdom and knowledge of future events. His
peculiar power was that of changing his shape at will.

### THETIS.

Thetis, the daughter of Nereus and Doris, was so beautiful that Jupiter
himself sought her in marriage; but having learned from Prometheus the
Titan that Thetis should bear a son who should be greater than his
father, Jupiter desisted from his suit and decreed that Thetis should be
the wife of a mortal. By the aid of Chiron the Centaur, Peleus succeeded
in winning the goddess for his bride and their son was the renowned
Achilles. In our chapter on the Trojan war it will appear that Thetis
was a faithful mother to him, aiding him in all difficulties, and
watching over his interests from the first to the last.

### LEUCOTHEA AND PALAEMON.

Ino, the daughter of Cadmus and wife of Athamas, flying from her frantic
husband with her little son Melicertes in her arms, sprang from a cliff
into the sea. The gods, out of compassion, make her a goddess of the
sea, under the name of Leucothea, and him a god, under that of Palaemon.
Both were held powerful to save from shipwreck and were invoked by
sailors. Palaemon was usually represented riding on a dolphin. The
Isthmian games were celebrated in his honour. He was called Portunus by
the Romans, and believed to have jurisdiction of the ports and shores.

Milton alludes to all these deities in the song at the conclusion of
"Comus":

              "Sabrina fair...  
               Listen and appear to us,  
               In name of great Oceanus;  
               By the earth-shaking Neptune's mace,  
               And Tethys' grave, majestic pace;  
               By hoary Nereus' wrinkled look,  
               And the Carpathian wizard's hook,\*  
               By scaly Triton's winding shell,  
               And old soothsaying Glaucus' spell,  
               By Leucothea's lovely hands,  
               And her son who rules the strands;  
               By Thetis' tinsel-slippered feet,  
               And the songs of Sirens sweet;" etc.  

\* Proteus.

Armstrong, the poet of the "Art of Preserving Health," under the
inspiration of Hygeia, the goddess of health, thus celebrates the
Naiads. Paeon is a name both of Apollo and AEsculapius.

        "Come ye Naiads! to the fountains lead!  
         Propitious maids! the task remains to sing  
         Your gifts (so Paeon, so the powers of Health  
         Command), to praise your crystal element.  
         O comfortable streams! with eager lips  
         And trembling hands the languid thirsty quaff  
         New life in you; fresh vigour fills their veins.  
         No warmer cups the rural ages knew,  
         None warmer sought the sires of humankind;  
         Happy in temperate peace their equal days  
         Felt not the alternate fits of feverish mirth  
         And sick dejection; still serene and pleased,  
         Blessed with divine immunity from ills,  
         Long centuries they lived; their only fate  
         Was ripe old age, and rather sleep than death."  

### THE CAMENAE.

By this name the Latins designated the Muses, but included under it also
some other deities, principally nymphs of fountains. Egeria was one of
them, whose fountain and grotto are still shown. It was said that Numa,
the second king of Rome, was favoured by this nymph with secret
interviews, in which she taught him those lessons of wisdom and of law
which he embodied in the institutions of his rising nation. After the
death of Numa the nymph pined away and was changed into a fountain.

Byron, in "Childe Harold," Canto IV., thus alludes to Egeria and her
grotto:

        "Here didst thou dwell, in this enchanted cover,  
         Egeria! all thy heavenly bosom beating  
         For the far footsteps of thy mortal lover;  
         The purple midnight veiled that mystic meeting  
         With her most starry canopy;" etc.  

Tennyson, also, in his "Palace of Art," gives us a glimpse of the royal
lover expecting the interview:

          "Holding one hand against his ear,  
             To list a footfall ere he saw  
           The wood-nymph, stayed the Tuscan king to hear  
             Of wisdom and of law."  

### THE WINDS.

When so many less active agencies were personified, it is not to be
supposed that the winds failed to be so. They were Boreas or Aquilo, the
north wind; Zephyrus or Favonius, the west; Notus or Auster, the south;
and Eurus, the east. The first two have been chiefly celebrated by the
poets, the former as the type of rudeness, the latter of gentleness.
Boreas loved the nymph Orithyia, and tried to play the lover's part, but
met with poor success. It was hard for him to breathe gently, and
sighing was out of the question. Weary at last of fruitless endeavours,
he acted out his true character, seized the maiden and carried her off.
Their children were Zetes and Calais, winged warriors, who accompanied
the Argonautic expedition, and did good service in an encounter with
those monstrous birds the Harpies.

Zephyrus was the lover of Flora. Milton alludes to them in "Paradise
Lost," where he describes Adam waking and contemplating Eve still
asleep.

        "...He on his side  
         Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love,  
         Hung over her enamoured, and beheld  
         Beauty which; whether waking or asleep,  
         Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice,  
         Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,  
         Her hand soft touching, whispered thus: 'Awake!  
         My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,  
         Heaven's last, best gift, my ever-new delight.'"  

Dr. Young, the poet of the "Night Thoughts," addressing the idle and
luxurious, says:

          "Ye delicate! who nothing can support  
           (Yourselves most insupportable) for whom  
           The winter rose must blow,...  
           ....and silky soft  
           Favonius breathe still softer or be chid!"
