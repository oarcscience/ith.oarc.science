# Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: Master Index

This is the master index for Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire.

Gibbon (b. 1737, d. 1794) upon visiting the ruins of the Roman forum in
1762, during his Grand Tour, was inspired to write a history of the
Roman Empire and its long fall. Volume one was published in 1776 after a
decade of labor, Volumes two and three in 1781; and the last three were
released in 1788. Gibbon was one of the leading figures of the
Enlightenment, and his unvarnished take on the early Church has led to
the book being banned sporadically. The Decline and Fall has had a
massive cultural impact, including being an inspiration for Isaac
Asimov's Foundation series.

The sheer dimensions of this book mean that it is seldom reprinted in
entirety any more. This is a transcription of the unabridged (and public
domain) 1845 edition, with notes and editing by H. H. Milman.

*Note:* The images on this page and each volume's index are previously
unreleased photographs which I took in Rome in 1968, newly scanned. They
are not public domain.--JBH.
