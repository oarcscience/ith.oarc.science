### Chapter XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To Constantine. Part I.

Note: The sixteenth chapter I cannot help considering as a very
ingenious and specious, but very disgraceful extenuation of the
cruelties perpetrated by the Roman magistrates against the Christians.
It is written in the most contemptibly factious spirit of prejudice
against the sufferers; it is unworthy of a philosopher and of humanity.
Let the narrative of Cyprian's death be examined. He had to relate the
murder of an innocent man of advanced age, and in a station deemed
venerable by a considerable body of the provincials of Africa, put to
death because he refused to sacrifice to Jupiter. Instead of pointing
the indignation of posterity against such an atrocious act of tyranny,
he dwells, with visible art, on the small circumstances of decorum and
politeness which attended this murder, and which he relates with as much
parade as if they were the most important particulars of the event.

The Conduct Of The Roman Government Towards The Christians, From The
Reign Of Nero To That Of Constantine.

Dr. Robertson has been the subject of much blame for his real or
supposed lenity towards the Spanish murderers and tyrants in America.
That the sixteenth chapter of Mr. G. did not excite the same or greater
disapprobation, is a proof of the unphilosophical and indeed fanatical
animosity against Christianity, which was so prevalent during the latter
part of the eighteenth century. - Mackintosh: see Life, i. p. 244,
245.\]

If we seriously consider the purity of the Christian religion, the
sanctity of its moral precepts, and the innocent as well as austere
lives of the greater number of those who during the first ages embraced
the faith of the gospel, we should naturally suppose, that so benevolent
a doctrine would have been received with due reverence, even by the
unbelieving world; that the learned and the polite, however they may
deride the miracles, would have esteemed the virtues, of the new sect;
and that the magistrates, instead of persecuting, would have protected
an order of men who yielded the most passive obedience to the laws,
though they declined the active cares of war and government. If, on the
other hand, we recollect the universal toleration of Polytheism, as it
was invariably maintained by the faith of the people, the incredulity of
philosophers, and the policy of the Roman senate and emperors, we are at
a loss to discover what new offence the Christians had committed, what
new provocation could exasperate the mild indifference of antiquity, and
what new motives could urge the Roman princes, who beheld without
concern a thousand forms of religion subsisting in peace under their
gentle sway, to inflict a severe punishment on any part of their
subjects, who had chosen for themselves a singular but an inoffensive
mode of faith and worship. The religious policy of the ancient world
seems to have assumed a more stern and intolerant character, to oppose
the progress of Christianity. About fourscore years after the death of
Christ, his innocent disciples were punished with death by the sentence
of a proconsul of the most amiable and philosophic character, and
according to the laws of an emperor distinguished by the wisdom and
justice of his general administration. The apologies which were
repeatedly addressed to the successors of Trajan are filled with the
most pathetic complaints, that the Christians, who obeyed the dictates,
and solicited the liberty, of conscience, were alone, among all the
subjects of the Roman empire, excluded from the common benefits of their
auspicious government. The deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been
recorded with care; and from the time that Christianity was invested
with the supreme power, the governors of the church have been no less
diligently employed in displaying the cruelty, than in imitating the
conduct, of their Pagan adversaries. To separate (if it be possible) a
few authentic as well as interesting facts from an undigested mass of
fiction and error, and to relate, in a clear and rational manner, the
causes, the extent, the duration, and the most important circumstances
of the persecutions to which the first Christians were exposed, is the
design of the present chapter.  <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*\_0001](#fn_0.md)

The sectaries of a persecuted religion, depressed by fear animated with
resentment, and perhaps heated by enthusiasm, are seldom in a proper
temper of mind calmly to investigate, or candidly to appreciate, the
motives of their enemies, which often escape the impartial and
discerning view even of those who are placed at a secure distance from
the flames of persecution. A reason has been assigned for the conduct of
the emperors towards the primitive Christians, which may appear the more
specious and probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of
Polytheism. It has already been observed, that the religious concord of
the world was principally supported by the implicit assent and reverence
which the nations of antiquity expressed for their respective traditions
and ceremonies. It might therefore be expected, that they would unite
with indignation against any sect or people which should separate itself
from the communion of mankind, and claiming the exclusive possession of
divine knowledge, should disdain every form of worship, except its own,
as impious and idolatrous. The rights of toleration were held by mutual
indulgence: they were justly forfeited by a refusal of the accustomed
tribute. As the payment of this tribute was inflexibly refused by the
Jews, and by them alone, the consideration of the treatment which they
experienced from the Roman magistrates, will serve to explain how far
these speculations are justified by facts, and will lead us to discover
the true causes of the persecution of Christianity.

Without repeating what has already been mentioned of the reverence of
the Roman princes and governors for the temple of Jerusalem, we shall
only observe, that the destruction of the temple and city was
accompanied and followed by every circumstance that could exasperate the
minds of the conquerors, and authorize religious persecution by the most
specious arguments of political justice and the public safety. From the
reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews discovered a fierce
impatience of the dominion of Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the
most furious massacres and insurrections. Humanity is shocked at the
recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of
Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous
friendship with the unsuspecting natives;  <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) and we are tempted to applaud the severe
retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a
race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render
them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but of
human kind.  <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) The enthusiasm of the
Jews was supported by the opinion, that it was unlawful for them to pay
taxes to an idolatrous master; and by the flattering promise which they
derived from their ancient oracles, that a conquering Messiah would soon
arise, destined to break their fetters, and to invest the favorites of
heaven with the empire of the earth. It was by announcing himself as
their long-expected deliverer, and by calling on all the descendants of
Abraham to assert the hope of Israel, that the famous Barchochebas
collected a formidable army, with which he resisted during two years the
power of the emperor Hadrian.  <span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md)

Notwithstanding these repeated provocations, the resentment of the Roman
princes expired after the victory; nor were their apprehensions
continued beyond the period of war and danger. By the general indulgence
of polytheism, and by the mild temper of Antoninus Pius, the Jews were
restored to their ancient privileges, and once more obtained the
permission of circumcising their children, with the easy restraint, that
they should never confer on any foreign proselyte that distinguishing
mark of the Hebrew race.  <span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#fn_4.md) The numerous
remains of that people, though they were still excluded from the
precincts of Jerusalem, were permitted to form and to maintain
considerable establishments both in Italy and in the provinces, to
acquire the freedom of Rome, to enjoy municipal honors, and to obtain at
the same time an exemption from the burdensome and expensive offices of
society. The moderation or the contempt of the Romans gave a legal
sanction to the form of ecclesiastical police which was instituted by
the vanquished sect. The patriarch, who had fixed his residence at
Tiberias, was empowered to appoint his subordinate ministers and
apostles, to exercise a domestic jurisdiction, and to receive from his
dispersed brethren an annual contribution.  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[5](#fn_5.md) New synagogues were frequently erected in
the principal cities of the empire; and the sabbaths, the fasts, and the
festivals, which were either commanded by the Mosaic law, or enjoined by
the traditions of the Rabbis, were celebrated in the most solemn and
public manner.  <span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#fn_6.md) Such gentle treatment
insensibly assuaged the stern temper of the Jews. Awakened from their
dream of prophecy and conquest, they assumed the behavior of peaceable
and industrious subjects. Their irreconcilable hatred of mankind,
instead of flaming out in acts of blood and violence, evaporated in less
dangerous gratifications. They embraced every opportunity of
overreaching the idolaters in trade; and they pronounced secret and
ambiguous imprecations against the haughty kingdom of Edom.  <span
id="fr_7"></span>[7](#fn_7.md)

Since the Jews, who rejected with abhorrence the deities adored by their
sovereign and by their fellow-subjects, enjoyed, however, the free
exercise of their unsocial religion, there must have existed some other
cause, which exposed the disciples of Christ to those severities from
which the posterity of Abraham was exempt. The difference between them
is simple and obvious; but, according to the sentiments of antiquity, it
was of the highest importance. The Jews were a nation; the Christians
were a sect: and if it was natural for every community to respect the
sacred institutions of their neighbors, it was incumbent on them to
persevere in those of their ancestors. The voice of oracles, the
precepts of philosophers, and the authority of the laws, unanimously
enforced this national obligation. By their lofty claim of superior
sanctity the Jews might provoke the Polytheists to consider them as an
odious and impure race. By disdaining the intercourse of other nations,
they might deserve their contempt. The laws of Moses might be for the
most part frivolous or absurd; yet, since they had been received during
many ages by a large society, his followers were justified by the
example of mankind; and it was universally acknowledged, that they had a
right to practise what it would have been criminal in them to neglect.
But this principle, which protected the Jewish synagogue, afforded not
any favor or security to the primitive church. By embracing the faith of
the gospel, the Christians incurred the supposed guilt of an unnatural
and unpardonable offence. They dissolved the sacred ties of custom and
education, violated the religious institutions of their country, and
presumptuously despised whatever their fathers had believed as true, or
had reverenced as sacred. Nor was this apostasy (if we may use the
expression) merely of a partial or local kind; since the pious deserter
who withdrew himself from the temples of Egypt or Syria, would equally
disdain to seek an asylum in those of Athens or Carthage. Every
Christian rejected with contempt the superstitions of his family, his
city, and his province. The whole body of Christians unanimously refused
to hold any communion with the gods of Rome, of the empire, and of
mankind. It was in vain that the oppressed believer asserted the
inalienable rights of conscience and private judgment. Though his
situation might excite the pity, his arguments could never reach the
understanding, either of the philosophic or of the believing part of the
Pagan world. To their apprehensions, it was no less a matter of
surprise, that any individuals should entertain scruples against
complying with the established mode of worship, than if they had
conceived a sudden abhorrence to the manners, the dress, or the language
of their native country.  <span id="fr_8"></span>[8](#fn_8.md)  <span
id="fr_9"></span>[\*\_0002](#fn_9.md)

The surprise of the Pagans was soon succeeded by resentment; and the
most pious of men were exposed to the unjust but dangerous imputation of
impiety. Malice and prejudice concurred in representing the Christians
as a society of atheists, who, by the most daring attack on the
religious constitution of the empire, had merited the severest
animadversion of the civil magistrate. They had separated themselves
(they gloried in the confession) from every mode of superstition which
was received in any part of the globe by the various temper of
polytheism: but it was not altogether so evident what deity, or what
form of worship, they had substituted to the gods and temples of
antiquity. The pure and sublime idea which they entertained of the
Supreme Being escaped the gross conception of the Pagan multitude, who
were at a loss to discover a spiritual and solitary God, that was
neither represented under any corporeal figure or visible symbol, nor
was adored with the accustomed pomp of libations and festivals, of
altars and sacrifices.  <span id="fr_10"></span>[9](#fn_10.md) The sages of
Greece and Rome, who had elevated their minds to the contemplation of
the existence and attributes of the First Cause, were induced by reason
or by vanity to reserve for themselves and their chosen disciples the
privilege of this philosophical devotion.  <span
id="fr_11"></span>[10](#fn_11.md) They were far from admitting the
prejudices of mankind as the standard of truth, but they considered them
as flowing from the original disposition of human nature; and they
supposed that any popular mode of faith and worship which presumed to
disclaim the assistance of the senses, would, in proportion as it
receded from superstition, find itself incapable of restraining the
wanderings of the fancy, and the visions of fanaticism. The careless
glance which men of wit and learning condescended to cast on the
Christian revelation, served only to confirm their hasty opinion, and to
persuade them that the principle, which they might have revered, of the
Divine Unity, was defaced by the wild enthusiasm, and annihilated by the
airy speculations, of the new sectaries. The author of a celebrated
dialogue, which has been attributed to Lucian, whilst he affects to
treat the mysterious subject of the Trinity in a style of ridicule and
contempt, betrays his own ignorance of the weakness of human reason, and
of the inscrutable nature of the divine perfections.  <span
id="fr_12"></span>[11](#fn_12.md)

It might appear less surprising, that the founder of Christianity should
not only be revered by his disciples as a sage and a prophet, but that
he should be adored as a God. The Polytheists were disposed to adopt
every article of faith, which seemed to offer any resemblance, however
distant or imperfect, with the popular mythology; and the legends of
Bacchus, of Hercules, and of Aesculapius, had, in some measure, prepared
their imagination for the appearance of the Son of God under a human
form.  <span id="fr_13"></span>[12](#fn_13.md) But they were astonished
that the Christians should abandon the temples of those ancient heroes,
who, in the infancy of the world, had invented arts, instituted laws,
and vanquished the tyrants or monsters who infested the earth, in order
to choose for the exclusive object of their religious worship an obscure
teacher, who, in a recent age, and among a barbarous people, had fallen
a sacrifice either to the malice of his own countrymen, or to the
jealousy of the Roman government. The Pagan multitude, reserving their
gratitude for temporal benefits alone, rejected the inestimable present
of life and immortality, which was offered to mankind by Jesus of
Nazareth. His mild constancy in the midst of cruel and voluntary
sufferings, his universal benevolence, and the sublime simplicity of his
actions and character, were insufficient, in the opinion of those carnal
men, to compensate for the want of fame, of empire, and of success; and
whilst they refused to acknowledge his stupendous triumph over the
powers of darkness and of the grave, they misrepresented, or they
insulted, the equivocal birth, wandering life, and ignominious death, of
the divine Author of Christianity.  <span id="fr_14"></span>[13](#fn_14.md)

The personal guilt which every Christian had contracted, in thus
preferring his private sentiment to the national religion, was
aggravated in a very high degree by the number and union of the
criminals. It is well known, and has been already observed, that Roman
policy viewed with the utmost jealousy and distrust any association
among its subjects; and that the privileges of private corporations,
though formed for the most harmless or beneficial purposes, were
bestowed with a very sparing hand.  <span id="fr_15"></span>[14](#fn_15.md)
The religious assemblies of the Christians who had separated themselves
from the public worship, appeared of a much less innocent nature; they
were illegal in their principle, and in their consequences might become
dangerous; nor were the emperors conscious that they violated the laws
of justice, when, for the peace of society, they prohibited those secret
and sometimes nocturnal meetings.  <span id="fr_16"></span>[15](#fn_16.md)
The pious disobedience of the Christians made their conduct, or perhaps
their designs, appear in a much more serious and criminal light; and the
Roman princes, who might perhaps have suffered themselves to be disarmed
by a ready submission, deeming their honor concerned in the execution of
their commands, sometimes attempted, by rigorous punishments, to subdue
this independent spirit, which boldly acknowledged an authority superior
to that of the magistrate. The extent and duration of this spiritual
conspiracy seemed to render it everyday more deserving of his
animadversion. We have already seen that the active and successful zeal
of the Christians had insensibly diffused them through every province
and almost every city of the empire. The new converts seemed to renounce
their family and country, that they might connect themselves in an
indissoluble band of union with a peculiar society, which every where
assumed a different character from the rest of mankind. Their gloomy and
austere aspect, their abhorrence of the common business and pleasures of
life, and their frequent predictions of impending calamities,  <span
id="fr_17"></span>[16](#fn_17.md) inspired the Pagans with the apprehension
of some danger, which would arise from the new sect, the more alarming
as it was the more obscure. "Whatever," says Pliny, "may be the
principle of their conduct, their inflexible obstinacy appeared
deserving of punishment."  <span id="fr_18"></span>[17](#fn_18.md)

The precautions with which the disciples of Christ performed the offices
of religion were at first dictated by fear and necessity; but they were
continued from choice. By imitating the awful secrecy which reigned in
the Eleusinian mysteries, the Christians had flattered themselves that
they should render their sacred institutions more respectable in the
eyes of the Pagan world.  <span id="fr_19"></span>[18](#fn_19.md) But the
event, as it often happens to the operations of subtile policy, deceived
their wishes and their expectations. It was concluded, that they only
concealed what they would have blushed to disclose. Their mistaken
prudence afforded an opportunity for malice to invent, and for
suspicious credulity to believe, the horrid tales which described the
Christians as the most wicked of human kind, who practised in their dark
recesses every abomination that a depraved fancy could suggest, and who
solicited the favor of their unknown God by the sacrifice of every moral
virtue. There were many who pretended to confess or to relate the
ceremonies of this abhorred society. It was asserted, "that a new-born
infant, entirely covered over with flour, was presented, like some
mystic symbol of initiation, to the knife of the proselyte, who
unknowingly inflicted many a secret and mortal wound on the innocent
victim of his error; that as soon as the cruel deed was perpetrated, the
sectaries drank up the blood, greedily tore asunder the quivering
members, and pledged themselves to eternal secrecy, by a mutual
consciousness of guilt. It was as confidently affirmed, that this
inhuman sacrifice was succeeded by a suitable entertainment, in which
intemperance served as a provocative to brutal lust; till, at the
appointed moment, the lights were suddenly extinguished, shame was
banished, nature was forgotten; and, as accident might direct, the
darkness of the night was polluted by the incestuous commerce of sisters
and brothers, of sons and of mothers."  <span
id="fr_20"></span>[19](#fn_20.md)

But the perusal of the ancient apologies was sufficient to remove even
the slightest suspicion from the mind of a candid adversary. The
Christians, with the intrepid security of innocence, appeal from the
voice of rumor to the equity of the magistrates. They acknowledge, that
if any proof can be produced of the crimes which calumny has imputed to
them, they are worthy of the most severe punishment. They provoke the
punishment, and they challenge the proof. At the same time they urge,
with equal truth and propriety, that the charge is not less devoid of
probability, than it is destitute of evidence; they ask, whether any one
can seriously believe that the pure and holy precepts of the gospel,
which so frequently restrain the use of the most lawful enjoyments,
should inculcate the practice of the most abominable crimes; that a
large society should resolve to dishonor itself in the eyes of its own
members; and that a great number of persons of either sex, and every age
and character, insensible to the fear of death or infamy, should consent
to violate those principles which nature and education had imprinted
most deeply in their minds.  <span id="fr_21"></span>[20](#fn_21.md)
Nothing, it should seem, could weaken the force or destroy the effect of
so unanswerable a justification, unless it were the injudicious conduct
of the apologists themselves, who betrayed the common cause of religion,
to gratify their devout hatred to the domestic enemies of the church. It
was sometimes faintly insinuated, and sometimes boldly asserted, that
the same bloody sacrifices, and the same incestuous festivals, which
were so falsely ascribed to the orthodox believers, were in reality
celebrated by the Marcionites, by the Carpocratians, and by several
other sects of the Gnostics, who, notwithstanding they might deviate
into the paths of heresy, were still actuated by the sentiments of men,
and still governed by the precepts of Christianity.  <span
id="fr_22"></span>[21](#fn_22.md) Accusations of a similar kind were
retorted upon the church by the schismatics who had departed from its
communion,  <span id="fr_23"></span>[22](#fn_23.md) and it was confessed on
all sides, that the most scandalous licentiousness of manners prevailed
among great numbers of those who affected the name of Christians. A
Pagan magistrate, who possessed neither leisure nor abilities to discern
the almost imperceptible line which divides the orthodox faith from
heretical pravity, might easily have imagined that their mutual
animosity had extorted the discovery of their common guilt. It was
fortunate for the repose, or at least for the reputation, of the first
Christians, that the magistrates sometimes proceeded with more temper
and moderation than is usually consistent with religious zeal, and that
they reported, as the impartial result of their judicial inquiry, that
the sectaries, who had deserted the established worship, appeared to
them sincere in their professions, and blameless in their manners;
however they might incur, by their absurd and excessive superstition,
the censure of the laws.  <span id="fr_24"></span>[23](#fn_24.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[\*\_0001](daf02001.htm#fr_0.md) The history of the
first age of Christianity is only found in the Acts of the Apostles, and
in order to speak of the first persecutions experienced by the
Christians, that book should naturally have been consulted; those
persecutions, then limited to individuals and to a narrow sphere,
interested only the persecuted, and have been related by them alone.
Gibbon making the persecutions ascend no higher than Nero, has entirely
omitted those which preceded this epoch, and of which St. Luke has
preserved the memory. The only way to justify this omission was, to
attack the authenticity of the Acts of the Apostles; for, if authentic,
they must necessarily be consulted and quoted. Now, antiquity has left
very few works of which the authenticity is so well established as that
of the Acts of the Apostles. (See Lardner's Cred. of Gospel Hist. part
iii.) It is therefore, without sufficient reason, that Gibbon has
maintained silence concerning the narrative of St. Luke, and this
omission is not without importance. - G.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[1](daf02001.htm#fr_1.md) In Cyrene, they massacred
220,000 Greeks; in Cyprus, 240,000; in Egypt, a very great multitude.
Many of these unhappy victims were sawn asunder, according to a
precedent to which David had given the sanction of his example. The
victorious Jews devoured the flesh, licked up the blood, and twisted the
entrails like a girdle round their bodies. See Dion Cassius, l. lxviii.
p. 1145.

Note: Some commentators, among them Reimar, in his notes on Dion Cassius
think that the hatred of the Romans against the Jews has led the
historian to exaggerate the cruelties committed by the latter. Don.
Cass. lxviii. p. 1146. - G.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[2](daf02001.htm#fr_2.md) Without repeating the
well-known narratives of Josephus, we may learn from Dion, (l. lxix. p.
1162,) that in Hadrian's war 580,000 Jews were cut off by the sword,
besides an infinite number which perished by famine, by disease, and by
fire.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[3](daf02001.htm#fr_3.md) For the sect of the
Zealots, see Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, l. i. c. 17; for the
characters of the Messiah, according to the Rabbis, l. v. c. 11, 12, 13;
for the actions of Barchochebas, l. vii. c. 12. (Hist. of Jews iii. 115,
&c.) - M.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[4](daf02001.htm#fr_4.md) It is to Modestinus, a
Roman lawyer (l. vi. regular.) that we are indebted for a distinct
knowledge of the Edict of Antoninus. See Casaubon ad Hist. August. p.
27.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[5](daf02001.htm#fr_5.md) See Basnage, Histoire des
Juifs, l. iii. c. 2, 3. The office of Patriarch was suppressed by
Theodosius the younger.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[6](daf02001.htm#fr_6.md) We need only mention the
Purim, or deliverance of the Jews from he rage of Haman, which, till the
reign of Theodosius, was celebrated with insolent triumph and riotous
intemperance. Basnage, Hist. des Juifs, l. vi. c. 17, l. viii. c. 6.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[7](daf02001.htm#fr_7.md) According to the false
Josephus, Tsepho, the grandson of Esau, conducted into Italy the army of
Eneas, king of Carthage. Another colony of Idumaeans, flying from the
sword of David, took refuge in the dominions of Romulus. For these, or
for other reasons of equal weight, the name of Edom was applied by the
Jews to the Roman empire.

Note: The false Josephus is a romancer of very modern date, though some
of these legends are probably more ancient. It may be worth considering
whether many of the stories in the Talmud are not history in a
figurative disguise, adopted from prudence. The Jews might dare to say
many things of Rome, under the significant appellation of Edom, which
they feared to utter publicly. Later and more ignorant ages took
literally, and perhaps embellished, what was intelligible among the
generation to which it was addressed. Hist. of Jews, iii. 131.

The false Josephus has the inauguration of the emperor, with the seven
electors and apparently the pope assisting at the coronation! Pref. page
xxvi. - M.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[8](daf02001.htm#fr_8.md) From the arguments of
Celsus, as they are represented and refuted by Origen, (l. v. p. 247 -
259,) we may clearly discover the distinction that was made between the
Jewish people and the Christian sect. See, in the Dialogue of Minucius
Felix, (c. 5, 6,) a fair and not inelegant description of the popular
sentiments, with regard to the desertion of the established worship.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[\*\_0002](daf02001.htm#fr_9.md) In all this there
is doubtless much truth; yet does not the more important difference lie
on the surface? The Christians made many converts the Jews but few. Had
the Jewish been equally a proselyting religion would it not have
encountered as violent persecution? - M.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[9](daf02001.htm#fr_10.md) Cur nullas aras habent?
templa nulla? nulla nota simulacra! - Unde autem, vel quis ille, aut
ubi, Deus unicus, solitarius, desti tutus? Minucius Felix, c. 10. The
Pagan interlocutor goes on to make a distinction in favor of the Jews,
who had once a temple, altars, victims, &c.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[10](daf02001.htm#fr_11.md) It is difficult (says
Plato) to attain, and dangerous to publish, the knowledge of the true
God. See the Theologie des Philosophes, in the Abbe d'Olivet's French
translation of Tully de Natura Deorum, tom. i. p. 275.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[11](daf02001.htm#fr_12.md) The author of the
Philopatris perpetually treats the Christians as a company of dreaming
enthusiasts, &c.; and in one place he manifestly alludes to the vision
in which St. Paul was transported to the third heaven. In another place,
Triephon, who personates a Christian, after deriding the gods of
Paganism, proposes a mysterious oath.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[12](daf02001.htm#fr_13.md) According to Justin
Martyr, (Apolog. Major, c. 70-85,) the daemon who had gained some
imperfect knowledge of the prophecies, purposely contrived this
resemblance, which might deter, though by different means, both the
people and the philosophers from embracing the faith of Christ.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[13](daf02001.htm#fr_14.md) In the first and second
books of Origen, Celsus treats the birth and character of our Savior
with the most impious contempt. The orator Libanius praises Porphyry and
Julian for confuting the folly of a sect., which styles a dead man of
Palestine, God, and the Son of God. Socrates, Hist. Ecclesiast. iii. 23.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[14](daf02001.htm#fr_15.md) The emperor Trajan
refused to incorporate a company of 150 firemen, for the use of the city
of Nicomedia. He disliked all associations. See Plin. Epist. x. 42, 43.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[15](daf02001.htm#fr_16.md) The proconsul Pliny had
published a general edict against unlawful meetings. The prudence of the
Christians suspended their Agapae; but it was impossible for them to
omit the exercise of public worship.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[16](daf02001.htm#fr_17.md) As the prophecies of
the Antichrist, approaching conflagration, &c., provoked those Pagans
whom they did not convert, they were mentioned with caution and reserve;
and the Montanists were censured for disclosing too freely the dangerous
secret. See Mosheim, 413.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[17](daf02001.htm#fr_18.md) Neque enim dubitabam,
quodcunque esset quod faterentur, (such are the words of Pliny,)
pervicacian certe et inflexibilem obstinationem lebere puniri.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[18](daf02001.htm#fr_19.md) See Mosheim's
Ecclesiastical History, vol. i. p. 101, and Spanheim, Remarques sur les
Caesars de Julien, p. 468, &c.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[19](daf02001.htm#fr_20.md) See Justin Martyr,
Apolog. i. 35, ii. 14. Athenagoras, in Legation, c. 27. Tertullian,
Apolog. c. 7, 8, 9. Minucius Felix, c. 9, 10, 80, 31. The last of these
writers relates the accusation in the most elegant and circumstantial
manner. The answer of Tertullian is the boldest and most vigorous.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[20](daf02001.htm#fr_21.md) In the persecution of
Lyons, some Gentile slaves were compelled, by the fear of tortures, to
accuse their Christian master. The church of Lyons, writing to their
brethren of Asia, treat the horrid charge with proper indignation and
contempt. Euseb. Hist. Eccles. v. i.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[21](daf02001.htm#fr_22.md) See Justin Martyr,
Apolog. i. 35. Irenaeus adv. Haeres. i. 24. Clemens. Alexandrin.
Stromat. l. iii. p. 438. Euseb. iv. 8. It would be tedious and
disgusting to relate all that the succeeding writers have imagined, all
that Epiphanius has received, and all that Tillemont has copied. M. de
Beausobre (Hist. du Manicheisme, l. ix. c. 8, 9) has exposed, with great
spirit, the disingenuous arts of Augustin and Pope Leo I.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[22](daf02001.htm#fr_23.md) When Tertullian became
a Montanist, he aspersed the morals of the church which he had so
resolutely defended. "Sed majoris est Agape, quia per hanc adolescentes
tui cum sororibus dormiunt, appendices scilicet gulae lascivia et
luxuria." De Jejuniis c. 17. The 85th canon of the council of Illiberis
provides against the scandals which too often polluted the vigils of the
church, and disgraced the Christian name in the eyes of unbelievers.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[23](daf02001.htm#fr_24.md) Tertullian (Apolog. c.
2) expatiates on the fair and honorable testimony of Pliny, with much
reason and some declamation.
