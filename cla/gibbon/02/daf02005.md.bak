### Chapter XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To Constantine. Part V.

The apology of Tertullian contains two very ancient, very singular, but
at the same time very suspicious, instances of Imperial clemency; the
edicts published by Tiberius, and by Marcus Antoninus, and designed not
only to protect the innocence of the Christians, but even to proclaim
those stupendous miracles which had attested the truth of their
doctrine. The first of these examples is attended with some difficulties
which might perplex a sceptical mind.  <span
id="fr_116"></span>[105](#fn_116.md) We are required to believe, that
Pontius Pilate informed the emperor of the unjust sentence of death
which he had pronounced against an innocent, and, as it appeared, a
divine, person; and that, without acquiring the merit, he exposed
himself to the danger of martyrdom; that Tiberius, who avowed his
contempt for all religion, immediately conceived the design of placing
the Jewish Messiah among the gods of Rome; that his servile senate
ventured to disobey the commands of their master; that Tiberius, instead
of resenting their refusal, contented himself with protecting the
Christians from the severity of the laws, many years before such laws
were enacted, or before the church had assumed any distinct name or
existence; and lastly, that the memory of this extraordinary transaction
was preserved in the most public and authentic records, which escaped
the knowledge of the historians of Greece and Rome, and were only
visible to the eyes of an African Christian, who composed his apology
one hundred and sixty years after the death of Tiberius. The edict of
Marcus Antoninus is supposed to have been the effect of his devotion and
gratitude for the miraculous deliverance which he had obtained in the
Marcomannic war. The distress of the legions, the seasonable tempest of
rain and hail, of thunder and of lightning, and the dismay and defeat of
the barbarians, have been celebrated by the eloquence of several Pagan
writers. If there were any Christians in that army, it was natural that
they should ascribe some merit to the fervent prayers, which, in the
moment of danger, they had offered up for their own and the public
safety. But we are still assured by monuments of brass and marble, by
the Imperial medals, and by the Antonine column, that neither the prince
nor the people entertained any sense of this signal obligation, since
they unanimously attribute their deliverance to the providence of
Jupiter, and to the interposition of Mercury. During the whole course of
his reign, Marcus despised the Christians as a philosopher, and punished
them as a sovereign.  <span id="fr_117"></span>[106](#fn_117.md)  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[\*\_0011](#fn_118.md)

By a singular fatality, the hardships which they had endured under the
government of a virtuous prince, immediately ceased on the accession of
a tyrant; and as none except themselves had experienced the injustice of
Marcus, so they alone were protected by the lenity of Commodus. The
celebrated Marcia, the most favored of his concubines, and who at length
contrived the murder of her Imperial lover, entertained a singular
affection for the oppressed church; and though it was impossible that
she could reconcile the practice of vice with the precepts of the
gospel, she might hope to atone for the frailties of her sex and
profession by declaring herself the patroness of the Christians.  <span
id="fr_119"></span>[107](#fn_119.md) Under the gracious protection of
Marcia, they passed in safety the thirteen years of a cruel tyranny; and
when the empire was established in the house of Severus, they formed a
domestic but more honorable connection with the new court. The emperor
was persuaded, that in a dangerous sickness, he had derived some
benefit, either spiritual or physical, from the holy oil, with which one
of his slaves had anointed him. He always treated with peculiar
distinction several persons of both sexes who had embraced the new
religion. The nurse as well as the preceptor of Caracalla were
Christians;  <span id="fr_120"></span>[\*\_0012](#fn_120.md) and if that
young prince ever betrayed a sentiment of humanity, it was occasioned by
an incident, which, however trifling, bore some relation to the cause of
Christianity.  <span id="fr_121"></span>[108](#fn_121.md) Under the reign
of Severus, the fury of the populace was checked; the rigor of ancient
laws was for some time suspended; and the provincial governors were
satisfied with receiving an annual present from the churches within
their jurisdiction, as the price, or as the reward, of their moderation.
 <span id="fr_122"></span>[109](#fn_122.md) The controversy concerning the
precise time of the celebration of Easter, armed the bishops of Asia and
Italy against each other, and was considered as the most important
business of this period of leisure and tranquillity.  <span
id="fr_123"></span>[110](#fn_123.md) Nor was the peace of the church
interrupted, till the increasing numbers of proselytes seem at length to
have attracted the attention, and to have alienated the mind of Severus.
With the design of restraining the progress of Christianity, he
published an edict, which, though it was designed to affect only the new
converts, could not be carried into strict execution, without exposing
to danger and punishment the most zealous of their teachers and
missionaries. In this mitigated persecution we may still discover the
indulgent spirit of Rome and of Polytheism, which so readily admitted
every excuse in favor of those who practised the religious ceremonies of
their fathers.  <span id="fr_124"></span>[111](#fn_124.md)

But the laws which Severus had enacted soon expired with the authority
of that emperor; and the Christians, after this accidental tempest,
enjoyed a calm of thirty-eight years.  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[112](#fn_125.md) Till this period they had usually held
their assemblies in private houses and sequestered places. They were now
permitted to erect and consecrate convenient edifices for the purpose of
religious worship;  <span id="fr_126"></span>[113](#fn_126.md) to purchase
lands, even at Rome itself, for the use of the community; and to conduct
the elections of their ecclesiastical ministers in so public, but at the
same time in so exemplary a manner, as to deserve the respectful
attention of the Gentiles.  <span id="fr_127"></span>[114](#fn_127.md) This
long repose of the church was accompanied with dignity. The reigns of
those princes who derived their extraction from the Asiatic provinces,
proved the most favorable to the Christians; the eminent persons of the
sect, instead of being reduced to implore the protection of a slave or
concubine, were admitted into the palace in the honorable characters of
priests and philosophers; and their mysterious doctrines, which were
already diffused among the people, insensibly attracted the curiosity of
their sovereign. When the empress Mammaea passed through Antioch, she
expressed a desire of conversing with the celebrated Origen, the fame of
whose piety and learning was spread over the East. Origen obeyed so
flattering an invitation, and though he could not expect to succeed in
the conversion of an artful and ambitious woman, she listened with
pleasure to his eloquent exhortations, and honorably dismissed him to
his retirement in Palestine.  <span id="fr_128"></span>[115](#fn_128.md)
The sentiments of Mammaea were adopted by her son Alexander, and the
philosophic devotion of that emperor was marked by a singular but
injudicious regard for the Christian religion. In his domestic chapel he
placed the statues of Abraham, of Orpheus, of Apollonius, and of Christ,
as an honor justly due to those respectable sages who had instructed
mankind in the various modes of addressing their homage to the supreme
and universal Deity.  <span id="fr_129"></span>[116](#fn_129.md) A purer
faith, as well as worship, was openly professed and practised among his
household. Bishops, perhaps for the first time, were seen at court; and,
after the death of Alexander, when the inhuman Maximin discharged his
fury on the favorites and servants of his unfortunate benefactor, a
great number of Christians of every rank and of both sexes, were
involved the promiscuous massacre, which, on their account, has
improperly received the name of Persecution.  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[117](#fn_130.md)  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[\*\_0013](#fn_131.md)

Notwithstanding the cruel disposition of Maximin, the effects of his
resentment against the Christians were of a very local and temporary
nature, and the pious Origen, who had been proscribed as a devoted
victim, was still reserved to convey the truths of the gospel to the ear
of monarchs.  <span id="fr_132"></span>[118](#fn_132.md) He addressed
several edifying letters to the emperor Philip, to his wife, and to his
mother; and as soon as that prince, who was born in the neighborhood of
Palestine, had usurped the Imperial sceptre, the Christians acquired a
friend and a protector. The public and even partial favor of Philip
towards the sectaries of the new religion, and his constant reverence
for the ministers of the church, gave some color to the suspicion, which
prevailed in his own times, that the emperor himself was become a
convert to the faith;  <span id="fr_133"></span>[119](#fn_133.md) and
afforded some grounds for a fable which was afterwards invented, that he
had been purified by confession and penance from the guilt contracted by
the murder of his innocent predecessor.  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[120](#fn_134.md) the fall of Philip introduced, with
the change of masters, a new system of government, so oppressive to the
Christians, that their former condition, ever since the time of
Domitian, was represented as a state of perfect freedom and security, if
compared with the rigorous treatment which they experienced under the
short reign of Decius.  <span id="fr_135"></span>[121](#fn_135.md) The
virtues of that prince will scarcely allow us to suspect that he was
actuated by a mean resentment against the favorites of his predecessor;
and it is more reasonable to believe, that in the prosecution of his
general design to restore the purity of Roman manners, he was desirous
of delivering the empire from what he condemned as a recent and criminal
superstition. The bishops of the most considerable cities were removed
by exile or death: the vigilance of the magistrates prevented the clergy
of Rome during sixteen months from proceeding to a new election; and it
was the opinion of the Christians, that the emperor would more patiently
endure a competitor for the purple, than a bishop in the capital.  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[122](#fn_136.md) Were it possible to suppose that the
penetration of Decius had discovered pride under the disguise of
humility, or that he could foresee the temporal dominion which might
insensibly arise from the claims of spiritual authority, we might be
less surprised, that he should consider the successors of St. Peter, as
the most formidable rivals to those of Augustus.

The administration of Valerian was distinguished by a levity and
inconstancy ill suited to the gravity of the Roman Censor. In the first
part of his reign, he surpassed in clemency those princes who had been
suspected of an attachment to the Christian faith. In the last three
years and a half, listening to the insinuations of a minister addicted
to the superstitions of Egypt, he adopted the maxims, and imitated the
severity, of his predecessor Decius.  <span
id="fr_137"></span>[123](#fn_137.md) The accession of Gallienus, which
increased the calamities of the empire, restored peace to the church;
and the Christians obtained the free exercise of their religion by an
edict addressed to the bishops, and conceived in such terms as seemed to
acknowledge their office and public character.  <span
id="fr_138"></span>[124](#fn_138.md) The ancient laws, without being
formally repealed, were suffered to sink into oblivion; and (excepting
only some hostile intentions which are attributed to the emperor
Aurelian  <span id="fr_139"></span>[125](#fn_139.md) the disciples of
Christ passed above forty years in a state of prosperity, far more
dangerous to their virtue than the severest trials of persecution.

The story of Paul of Samosata, who filled the metropolitan see of
Antioch, while the East was in the hands of Odenathus and Zenobia, may
serve to illustrate the condition and character of the times. The wealth
of that prelate was a sufficient evidence of his guilt, since it was
neither derived from the inheritance of his fathers, nor acquired by the
arts of honest industry. But Paul considered the service of the church
as a very lucrative profession.  <span id="fr_140"></span>[126](#fn_140.md)
His ecclesiastical jurisdiction was venal and rapacious; he extorted
frequent contributions from the most opulent of the faithful, and
converted to his own use a considerable part of the public revenue. By
his pride and luxury, the Christian religion was rendered odious in the
eyes of the Gentiles. His council chamber and his throne, the splendor
with which he appeared in public, the suppliant crowd who solicited his
attention, the multitude of letters and petitions to which he dictated
his answers, and the perpetual hurry of business in which he was
involved, were circumstances much better suited to the state of a civil
magistrate,  <span id="fr_141"></span>[127](#fn_141.md) than to the
humility of a primitive bishop. When he harangued his people from the
pulpit, Paul affected the figurative style and the theatrical gestures
of an Asiatic sophist, while the cathedral resounded with the loudest
and most extravagant acclamations in the praise of his divine eloquence.
Against those who resisted his power, or refused to flatter his vanity,
the prelate of Antioch was arrogant, rigid, and inexorable; but he
relaxed the discipline, and lavished the treasures of the church on his
dependent clergy, who were permitted to imitate their master in the
gratification of every sensual appetite. For Paul indulged himself very
freely in the pleasures of the table, and he had received into the
episcopal palace two young and beautiful women as the constant
companions of his leisure moments.  <span
id="fr_142"></span>[128](#fn_142.md)

Notwithstanding these scandalous vices, if Paul of Samosata had
preserved the purity of the orthodox faith, his reign over the capital
of Syria would have ended only with his life; and had a seasonable
persecution intervened, an effort of courage might perhaps have placed
him in the rank of saints and martyrs.  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[\*\_0014](#fn_143.md) Some nice and subtle errors,
which he imprudently adopted and obstinately maintained, concerning the
doctrine of the Trinity, excited the zeal and indignation of the Eastern
churches.  <span id="fr_144"></span>[129](#fn_144.md) From Egypt to the
Euxine Sea, the bishops were in arms and in motion. Several councils
were held, confutations were published, excommunications were
pronounced, ambiguous explanations were by turns accepted and refused,
treaties were concluded and violated, and at length Paul of Samosata was
degraded from his episcopal character, by the sentence of seventy or
eighty bishops, who assembled for that purpose at Antioch, and who,
without consulting the rights of the clergy or people, appointed a
successor by their own authority. The manifest irregularity of this
proceeding increased the numbers of the discontented faction; and as
Paul, who was no stranger to the arts of courts, had insinuated himself
into the favor of Zenobia, he maintained above four years the possession
of the episcopal house and office.  <span
id="fr_145"></span>[\*\*\_0014](#fn_145.md) The victory of Aurelian changed
the face of the East, and the two contending parties, who applied to
each other the epithets of schism and heresy, were either commanded or
permitted to plead their cause before the tribunal of the conqueror.
This public and very singular trial affords a convincing proof that the
existence, the property, the privileges, and the internal policy of the
Christians, were acknowledged, if not by the laws, at least by the
magistrates, of the empire. As a Pagan and as a soldier, it could
scarcely be expected that Aurelian should enter into the discussion,
whether the sentiments of Paul or those of his adversaries were most
agreeable to the true standard of the orthodox faith. His determination,
however, was founded on the general principles of equity and reason. He
considered the bishops of Italy as the most impartial and respectable
judges among the Christians, and as soon as he was informed that they
had unanimously approved the sentence of the council, he acquiesced in
their opinion, and immediately gave orders that Paul should be compelled
to relinquish the temporal possessions belonging to an office, of which,
in the judgment of his brethren, he had been regularly deprived. But
while we applaud the justice, we should not overlook the policy, of
Aurelian, who was desirous of restoring and cementing the dependence of
the provinces on the capital, by every means which could bind the
interest or prejudices of any part of his subjects.  <span
id="fr_146"></span>[130](#fn_146.md)

Amidst the frequent revolutions of the empire, the Christians still
flourished in peace and prosperity; and notwithstanding a celebrated
aera of martyrs has been deduced from the accession of Diocletian,
 <span id="fr_147"></span>[131](#fn_147.md) the new system of policy,
introduced and maintained by the wisdom of that prince, continued,
during more than eighteen years, to breathe the mildest and most liberal
spirit of religious toleration. The mind of Diocletian himself was less
adapted indeed to speculative inquiries, than to the active labors of
war and government. His prudence rendered him averse to any great
innovation, and though his temper was not very susceptible of zeal or
enthusiasm, he always maintained an habitual regard for the ancient
deities of the empire. But the leisure of the two empresses, of his wife
Prisca, and of Valeria, his daughter, permitted them to listen with more
attention and respect to the truths of Christianity, which in every age
has acknowledged its important obligations to female devotion.  <span
id="fr_148"></span>[132](#fn_148.md) The principal eunuchs, Lucian  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[133](#fn_149.md) and Dorotheus, Gorgonius and Andrew,
who attended the person, possessed the favor, and governed the household
of Diocletian, protected by their powerful influence the faith which
they had embraced. Their example was imitated by many of the most
considerable officers of the palace, who, in their respective stations,
had the care of the Imperial ornaments, of the robes, of the furniture,
of the jewels, and even of the private treasury; and, though it might
sometimes be incumbent on them to accompany the emperor when he
sacrificed in the temple,  <span id="fr_150"></span>[134](#fn_150.md) they
enjoyed, with their wives, their children, and their slaves, the free
exercise of the Christian religion. Diocletian and his colleagues
frequently conferred the most important offices on those persons who
avowed their abhorrence for the worship of the gods, but who had
displayed abilities proper for the service of the state. The bishops
held an honorable rank in their respective provinces, and were treated
with distinction and respect, not only by the people, but by the
magistrates themselves. Almost in every city, the ancient churches were
found insufficient to contain the increasing multitude of proselytes;
and in their place more stately and capacious edifices were erected for
the public worship of the faithful. The corruption of manners and
principles, so forcibly lamented by Eusebius,  <span
id="fr_151"></span>[135](#fn_151.md) may be considered, not only as a
consequence, but as a proof, of the liberty which the Christians enjoyed
and abused under the reign of Diocletian. Prosperity had relaxed the
nerves of discipline. Fraud, envy, and malice prevailed in every
congregation. The presbyters aspired to the episcopal office, which
every day became an object more worthy of their ambition. The bishops,
who contended with each other for ecclesiastical preeminence, appeared
by their conduct to claim a secular and tyrannical power in the church;
and the lively faith which still distinguished the Christians from the
Gentiles, was shown much less in their lives, than in their
controversial writings.

Notwithstanding this seeming security, an attentive observer might
discern some symptoms that threatened the church with a more violent
persecution than any which she had yet endured. The zeal and rapid
progress of the Christians awakened the Polytheists from their supine
indifference in the cause of those deities, whom custom and education
had taught them to revere. The mutual provocations of a religious war,
which had already continued above two hundred years, exasperated the
animosity of the contending parties. The Pagans were incensed at the
rashness of a recent and obscure sect, which presumed to accuse their
countrymen of error, and to devote their ancestors to eternal misery.
The habits of justifying the popular mythology against the invectives of
an implacable enemy, produced in their minds some sentiments of faith
and reverence for a system which they had been accustomed to consider
with the most careless levity. The supernatural powers assumed by the
church inspired at the same time terror and emulation. The followers of
the established religion intrenched themselves behind a similar
fortification of prodigies; invented new modes of sacrifice, of
expiation, and of initiation;  <span id="fr_152"></span>[136](#fn_152.md)
attempted to revive the credit of their expiring oracles;  <span
id="fr_153"></span>[137](#fn_153.md) and listened with eager credulity to
every impostor, who flattered their prejudices by a tale of wonders.
 <span id="fr_154"></span>[138](#fn_154.md) Both parties seemed to
acknowledge the truth of those miracles which were claimed by their
adversaries; and while they were contented with ascribing them to the
arts of magic, and to the power of daemons, they mutually concurred in
restoring and establishing the reign of superstition.  <span
id="fr_155"></span>[139](#fn_155.md) Philosophy, her most dangerous enemy,
was now converted into her most useful ally. The groves of the academy,
the gardens of Epicurus, and even the portico of the Stoics, were almost
deserted, as so many different schools of scepticism or impiety;  <span
id="fr_156"></span>[140](#fn_156.md) and many among the Romans were
desirous that the writings of Cicero should be condemned and suppressed
by the authority of the senate.  <span id="fr_157"></span>[141](#fn_157.md)
The prevailing sect of the new Platonicians judged it prudent to connect
themselves with the priests, whom perhaps they despised, against the
Christians, whom they had reason to fear. These fashionable Philosophers
prosecuted the design of extracting allegorical wisdom from the fictions
of the Greek poets; instituted mysterious rites of devotion for the use
of their chosen disciples; recommended the worship of the ancient gods
as the emblems or ministers of the Supreme Deity, and composed against
the faith of the gospel many elaborate treatises,  <span
id="fr_158"></span>[142](#fn_158.md) which have since been committed to the
flames by the prudence of orthodox emperors.  <span
id="fr_159"></span>[143](#fn_159.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_116"></span>[105](daf02005.htm#fr_116.md) The testimony given
by Pontius Pilate is first mentioned by Justin. The successive
improvements which the story acquired (as if has passed through the
hands of Tertullian, Eusebius, Epiphanius, Chrysostom, Orosius, Gregory
of Tours, and the authors of the several editions of the acts of Pilate)
are very fairly stated by Dom Calmet Dissertat. sur l'Ecriture, tom.
iii. p. 651, &c.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[\*\_0011](daf02005.htm#fr_118.md) Gibbon, with
this phrase, and that below, which admits the injustice of Marcus, has
dexterously glossed over one of the most remarkable facts in the early
Christian history, that the reign of the wisest and most humane of the
heathen emperors was the most fatal to the Christians. Most writers have
ascribed the persecutions under Marcus to the latent bigotry of his
character; Mosheim, to the influence of the philosophic party; but the
fact is admitted by all. A late writer (Mr. Waddington, Hist. of the
Church, p. 47) has not scrupled to assert, that "this prince polluted
every year of a long reign with innocent blood;" but the causes as well
as the date of the persecutions authorized or permitted by Marcus are
equally uncertain. Of the Asiatic edict recorded by Melito. the date is
unknown, nor is it quite clear that it was an Imperial edict. If it was
the act under which Polycarp suffered, his martyrdom is placed by
Ruinart in the sixth, by Mosheim in the ninth, year of the reign of
Marcus. The martyrs of Vienne and Lyons are assigned by Dodwell to the
seventh, by most writers to the seventeenth. In fact, the commencement
of the persecutions of the Christians appears to synchronize exactly
with the period of the breaking out of the Marcomannic war, which seems
to have alarmed the whole empire, and the emperor himself, into a
paroxysm of returning piety to their gods, of which the Christians were
the victims. See Jul, Capit. Script. Hist August. p. 181, edit. 1661. It
is remarkable that Tertullian (Apologet. c. v.) distinctly asserts that
Verus (M. Aurelius) issued no edicts against the Christians, and almost
positively exempts him from the charge of persecution. - M.

This remarkable synchronism, which explains the persecutions under M
Aurelius, is shown at length in Milman's History of Christianity, book
ii. v. - M. 1845.

was styled a holy and pious woman, both by the Christians and the

deserve that honorable epithet.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[116](daf02005.htm#fr_129.md) See the Augustan
History, p. 123. Mosheim (p. 465) seems to refine too much on the
domestic religion of Alexander. His design of building a public temple
to Christ, (Hist. August. p. 129,) and the objection which was suggested
either to him, or in similar circumstances to Hadrian, appear to have no
other foundation than an improbable report, invented by the Christians,
and credulously adopted by an historian of the age of Constantine.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[117](daf02005.htm#fr_130.md) Euseb. l. vi. c. 28.
It may be presumed that the success of the Christians had exasperated
the increasing bigotry of the Pagans. Dion Cassius, who composed his
history under the former reign, had most probably intended for the use
of his master those counsels of persecution, which he ascribes to a
better age, and to and to the favorite of Augustus. Concerning this
oration of Maecenas, or rather of Dion, I may refer to my own unbiased
opinion, (vol. i. c. 1, note 25,) and to the Abbe de la Bleterie
(Memoires de l'Academie, tom. xxiv. p. 303 tom xxv. p. 432.)

Note: If this be the case, Dion Cassius must have known the Christians
they must have been the subject of his particular attention, since the
author supposes that he wished his master to profit by these "counsels
of persecution." How are we to reconcile this necessary consequence with
what Gibbon has said of the ignorance of Dion Cassius even of the name
of the Christians? (c. xvi. n. 24.) \[Gibbon speaks of Dion's silence,
not of his ignorance. - M\] The supposition in this note is supported by
no proof; it is probable that Dion Cassius has often designated the
Christians by the name of Jews. See Dion Cassius, l. lxvii. c 14,
lxviii. l - G.

On this point I should adopt the view of Gibbon rather than that of M
Guizot. - M

<span id="fn_131"></span>[\*\_0013](daf02005.htm#fr_131.md) It is with good
reason that this massacre has been called a persecution, for it lasted
during the whole reign of Maximin, as may be seen in Eusebius. (l. vi.
c. 28.) Rufinus expressly confirms it: Tribus annis a Maximino
persecutione commota, in quibus finem et persecutionis fecit et vitas
Hist. l. vi. c. 19. - G.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[118](daf02005.htm#fr_132.md) Orosius, l. vii. c.
19, mentions Origen as the object of Maximin's resentment; and
Firmilianus, a Cappadocian bishop of that age, gives a just and confined
idea of this persecution, (apud Cyprian Epist. 75.)

<span id="fn_133"></span>[119](daf02005.htm#fr_133.md) The mention of those
princes who were publicly supposed to be Christians, as we find it in an
epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria, (ap. Euseb. l. vii. c. 10,)
evidently alludes to Philip and his family, and forms a contemporary
evidence, that such a report had prevailed; but the Egyptian bishop, who
lived at an humble distance from the court of Rome, expresses himself
with a becoming diffidence concerning the truth of the fact. The
epistles of Origen (which were extant in the time of Eusebius, see l.
vi. c. 36) would most probably decide this curious rather than important
question.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[120](daf02005.htm#fr_134.md) Euseb. l. vi. c. 34.
The story, as is usual, has been embellished by succeeding writers, and
is confuted, with much superfluous learning, by Frederick Spanheim,
(Opera Varia, tom. ii. p. 400, &c.)

<span id="fn_135"></span>[121](daf02005.htm#fr_135.md) Lactantius, de
Mortibus Persecutorum, c. 3, 4. After celebrating the felicity and
increase of the church, under a long succession of good princes, he
adds, "Extitit post annos plurimos, execrabile animal, Decius, qui
vexaret Ecclesiam."

<span id="fn_136"></span>[122](daf02005.htm#fr_136.md) Euseb. l. vi. c. 39.
Cyprian. Epistol. 55. The see of Rome remained vacant from the martyrdom
of Fabianus, the 20th of January, A. D. 259, till the election of
Cornelius, the 4th of June, A. D. 251 Decius had probably left Rome,
since he was killed before the end of that year.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[123](daf02005.htm#fr_137.md) Euseb. l. vii. c.
10. Mosheim (p. 548) has very clearly shown that the praefect Macrianus,
and the Egyptian Magus, are one and the same person.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[124](daf02005.htm#fr_138.md) Eusebius (l. vii. c.
13) gives us a Greek version of this Latin edict, which seems to have
been very concise. By another edict, he directed that the Coemeteria
should be restored to the Christians.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[125](daf02005.htm#fr_139.md) Euseb. l. vii. c.
30. Lactantius de M. P. c. 6. Hieronym. in Chron. p. 177. Orosius, l.
vii. c. 23. Their language is in general so ambiguous and incorrect,
that we are at a loss to determine how far Aurelian had carried his
intentions before he was assassinated. Most of the moderns (except
Dodwell, Dissertat. Cyprian. vi. 64) have seized the occasion of gaining
a few extraordinary martyrs.

Note: Dr. Lardner has detailed, with his usual impartiality, all that
has come down to us relating to the persecution of Aurelian, and
concludes by saying, "Upon more carefully examining the words of
Eusebius, and observing the accounts of other authors, learned men have
generally, and, as I think, very judiciously, determined, that Aurelian
not only intended, but did actually persecute: but his persecution was
short, he having died soon after the publication of his edicts." Heathen
Test. c. xxxvi. - Basmage positively pronounces the same opinion: Non
intentatum modo, sed executum quoque brevissimo tempore mandatum, nobis
infixum est in aniasis. Basn. Ann. 275, No. 2 and compare Pagi Ann. 272,
Nos. 4, 12, 27 - G.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[126](daf02005.htm#fr_140.md) Paul was better
pleased with the title of Ducenarius, than with that of bishop. The
Ducenarius was an Imperial procurator, so called from his salary of two
hundred Sestertia, or 1600l. a year. (See Salmatius ad Hist. August. p.
124.) Some critics suppose that the bishop of Antioch had actually
obtained such an office from Zenobia, while others consider it only as a
figurative expression of his pomp and insolence.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[127](daf02005.htm#fr_141.md) Simony was not
unknown in those times; and the clergy some times bought what they
intended to sell. It appears that the bishopric of Carthage was
purchased by a wealthy matron, named Lucilla, for her servant Majorinus.
The price was 400 Folles. (Monument. Antiq. ad calcem Optati, p. 263.)
Every Follis contained 125 pieces of silver, and the whole sum may be
computed at about 2400l.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[128](daf02005.htm#fr_142.md) If we are desirous
of extenuating the vices of Paul, we must suspect the assembled bishops
of the East of publishing the most malicious calumnies in circular
epistles addressed to all the churches of the empire, (ap. Euseb. l.
vii. c. 30.)

<span id="fn_143"></span>[\*\_0014](daf02005.htm#fr_143.md) It appears,
nevertheless, that the vices and immoralities of Paul of Samosata had
much weight in the sentence pronounced against him by the bishops. The
object of the letter, addressed by the synod to the bishops of Rome and
Alexandria, was to inform them of the change in the faith of Paul, the
altercations and discussions to which it had given rise, as well as of
his morals and the whole of his conduct. Euseb. Hist. Eccl. l. vii c.
xxx - G.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[129](daf02005.htm#fr_144.md) His heresy (like
those of Noetus and Sabellius, in the same century) tended to confound
the mysterious distinction of the divine persons. See Mosheim, p. 702,
&c.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[\*\*\_0014](daf02005.htm#fr_145.md) "Her
favorite, (Zenobia's,) Paul of Samosata, seems to have entertained some
views of attempting a union between Judaism and Christianity; both
parties rejected the unnatural alliance." Hist. of Jews, iii. 175, and
Jost. Geschichte der Israeliter, iv. 167. The protection of the severe
Zenobia is the only circumstance which may raise a doubt of the
notorious immorality of Paul. - M.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[130](daf02005.htm#fr_146.md) Euseb. Hist.
Ecclesiast. l. vii. c. 30. We are entirely indebted to him for the
curious story of Paul of Samosata.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[131](daf02005.htm#fr_147.md) The Aera of Martyrs,
which is still in use among the Copts and the Abyssinians, must be
reckoned from the 29th of August, A. D. 284; as the beginning of the
Egyptian year was nineteen days earlier than the real accession of
Diocletian. See Dissertation Preliminaire a l'Art de verifier les Dates.

Note: On the aera of martyrs see the very curious dissertations of Mons
Letronne on some recently discovered inscriptions in Egypt and Nubis, p.
102, &c. - M.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[132](daf02005.htm#fr_148.md) The expression of
Lactantius, (de M. P. c. 15,) "sacrificio pollui coegit," implies their
antecedent conversion to the faith, but does not seem to justify the
assertion of Mosheim, (p. 912,) that they had been privately baptized.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[133](daf02005.htm#fr_149.md) M. de Tillemont
(Memoires Ecclesiastiques, tom. v. part i. p. 11, 12) has quoted from
the Spicilegium of Dom Luc d'Archeri a very curious instruction which
Bishop Theonas composed for the use of Lucian.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[134](daf02005.htm#fr_150.md) Lactantius, de M. P.
c. 10.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[135](daf02005.htm#fr_151.md) Eusebius, Hist.
Ecclesiast. l. viii. c. 1. The reader who consults the original will not
accuse me of heightening the picture. Eusebius was about sixteen years
of age at the accession of the emperor Diocletian.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[136](daf02005.htm#fr_152.md) We might quote,
among a great number of instances, the mysterious worship of Mythras,
and the Taurobolia; the latter of which became fashionable in the time
of the Antonines, (see a Dissertation of M. de Boze, in the Memoires de
l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. ii. p. 443.) The romance of Apuleius
is as full of devotion as of satire.

Note: On the extraordinary progress of the Mahriac rites, in the West,
see De Guigniaud's translation of Creuzer, vol. i. p. 365, and Note 9,
tom. i. part 2, p. 738, &c. - M.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[137](daf02005.htm#fr_153.md) The impostor
Alexander very strongly recommended the oracle of Trophonius at Mallos,
and those of Apollo at Claros and Miletus, (Lucian, tom. ii. p. 236,
edit. Reitz.) The last of these, whose singular history would furnish a
very curious episode, was consulted by Diocletian before he published
his edicts of persecution, (Lactantius, de M. P. c. 11.)

<span id="fn_154"></span>[138](daf02005.htm#fr_154.md) Besides the ancient
stories of Pythagoras and Aristeas, the cures performed at the shrine of
Aesculapius, and the fables related of Apollonius of Tyana, were
frequently opposed to the miracles of Christ; though I agree with Dr.
Lardner, (see Testimonies, vol. iii. p. 253, 352,) that when
Philostratus composed the life of Apollonius, he had no such intention.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[139](daf02005.htm#fr_155.md) It is seriously to
be lamented, that the Christian fathers, by acknowledging the
supernatural, or, as they deem it, the infernal part of Paganism,
destroy with their own hands the great advantage which we might
otherwise derive from the liberal concessions of our adversaries.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[140](daf02005.htm#fr_156.md) Julian (p. 301,
edit. Spanheim) expresses a pious joy, that the providence of the gods
had extinguished the impious sects, and for the most part destroyed the
books of the Pyrrhonians and Epicuraeans, which had been very numerous,
since Epicurus himself composed no less than 300 volumes. See Diogenes
Laertius, l. x. c. 26.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[141](daf02005.htm#fr_157.md) Cumque alios audiam
mussitare indignanter, et dicere opportere statui per Senatum,
aboleantur ut haec scripta, quibus Christiana Religio comprobetur, et
vetustatis opprimatur auctoritas. Arnobius adversus Gentes, l. iii. p.
103, 104. He adds very properly, Erroris convincite Ciceronem . . . nam
intercipere scripta, et publicatam velle submergere lectionem, non est
Deum defendere sed veritatis testificationem timere.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[142](daf02005.htm#fr_158.md) Lactantius (Divin.
Institut. l. v. c. 2, 3) gives a very clear and spirited account of two
of these philosophic adversaries of the faith. The large treatise of
Porphyry against the Christians consisted of thirty books, and was
composed in Sicily about the year 270.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[143](daf02005.htm#fr_159.md) See Socrates, Hist.
Ecclesiast. l. i. c. 9, and Codex Justinian. l. i. i. l. s.
