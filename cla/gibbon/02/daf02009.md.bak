### Chapter XVII: Foundation Of Constantinople. Part I.

Foundation Of Constantinople. - Political System Constantine, And His
Successors. - Military Discipline. - The Palace. - The Finances.

The unfortunate Licinius was the last rival who opposed the greatness,
and the last captive who adorned the triumph, of Constantine. After a
tranquil and prosperous reign, the conquerer bequeathed to his family
the inheritance of the Roman empire; a new capital, a new policy, and a
new religion; and the innovations which he established have been
embraced and consecrated by succeeding generations. The age of the great
Constantine and his sons is filled with important events; but the
historian must be oppressed by their number and variety, unless he
diligently separates from each other the scenes which are connected only
by the order of time. He will describe the political institutions that
gave strength and stability to the empire, before he proceeds to relate
the wars and revolutions which hastened its decline. He will adopt the
division unknown to the ancients of civil and ecclesiastical affairs:
the victory of the Christians, and their intestine discord, will supply
copious and distinct materials both for edification and for scandal.

After the defeat and abdication of Licinius, his victorious rival
proceeded to lay the foundations of a city destined to reign in future
times, the mistress of the East, and to survive the empire and religion
of Constantine. The motives, whether of pride or of policy, which first
induced Diocletian to withdraw himself from the ancient seat of
government, had acquired additional weight by the example of his
successors, and the habits of forty years. Rome was insensibly
confounded with the dependent kingdoms which had once acknowledged her
supremacy; and the country of the Caesars was viewed with cold
indifference by a martial prince, born in the neighborhood of the
Danube, educated in the courts and armies of Asia, and invested with the
purple by the legions of Britain. The Italians, who had received
Constantine as their deliverer, submissively obeyed the edicts which he
sometimes condescended to address to the senate and people of Rome; but
they were seldom honored with the presence of their new sovereign.
During the vigor of his age, Constantine, according to the various
exigencies of peace and war, moved with slow dignity, or with active
diligence, along the frontiers of his extensive dominions; and was
always prepared to take the field either against a foreign or a domestic
enemy. But as he gradually reached the summit of prosperity and the
decline of life, he began to meditate the design of fixing in a more
permanent station the strength as well as majesty of the throne. In the
choice of an advantageous situation, he preferred the confines of Europe
and Asia; to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians who dwelt between
the Danube and the Tanais; to watch with an eye of jealousy the conduct
of the Persian monarch, who indignantly supported the yoke of an
ignominious treaty. With these views, Diocletian had selected and
embellished the residence of Nicomedia: but the memory of Diocletian was
justly abhorred by the protector of the church: and Constantine was not
insensible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the
glory of his own name. During the late operations of the war against
Licinius, he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate, both as a
soldier and as a statesman, the incomparable position of Byzantium; and
to observe how strongly it was guarded by nature against a hostile
attack, whilst it was accessible on every side to the benefits of
commercial intercourse. Many ages before Constantine, one of the most
judicious historians of antiquity  <span id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_212.md)
had described the advantages of a situation, from whence a feeble colony
of Greeks derived the command of the sea, and the honors of a
flourishing and independent republic.  <span
id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_213.md) If we survey Byzantium in the extent
which it acquired with the august name of Constantinople, the figure of
the Imperial city may be represented under that of an unequal triangle.
The obtuse point, which advances towards the east and the shores of
Asia, meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Bosphorus. The northern
side of the city is bounded by the harbor; and the southern is washed by
the Propontis, or Sea of Marmara. The basis of the triangle is opposed
to the west, and terminates the continent of Europe. But the admirable
form and division of the circumjacent land and water cannot, without a
more ample explanation, be clearly or sufficiently understood. The
winding channel through which the waters of the Euxine flow with a rapid
and incessant course towards the Mediterranean, received the appellation
of Bosphorus, a name not less celebrated in the history, than in the
fables, of antiquity.  <span id="fr_214"></span>[3](#fn_214.md) A crowd of
temples and of votive altars, profusely scattered along its steep and
woody banks, attested the unskilfulness, the terrors, and the devotion
of the Grecian navigators, who, after the example of the Argonauts,
explored the dangers of the inhospitable Euxine. On these banks
tradition long preserved the memory of the palace of Phineus, infested
by the obscene harpies;  <span id="fr_215"></span>[4](#fn_215.md) and of
the sylvan reign of Amycus, who defied the son of Leda to the combat of
the cestus.  <span id="fr_216"></span>[5](#fn_216.md) The straits of the
Bosphorus are terminated by the Cyanean rocks, which, according to the
description of the poets, had once floated on the face of the waters;
and were destined by the gods to protect the entrance of the Euxine
against the eye of profane curiosity.  <span
id="fr_217"></span>[6](#fn_217.md) From the Cyanean rocks to the point and
harbor of Byzantium, the winding length of the Bosphorus extends about
sixteen miles,  <span id="fr_218"></span>[7](#fn_218.md) and its most
ordinary breadth may be computed at about one mile and a half. The new
castles of Europe and Asia are constructed, on either continent, upon
the foundations of two celebrated temples, of Serapis and of Jupiter
Urius. The old castles, a work of the Greek emperors, command the
narrowest part of the channel in a place where the opposite banks
advance within five hundred paces of each other. These fortresses were
destroyed and strengthened by Mahomet the Second, when he meditated the
siege of Constantinople:  <span id="fr_219"></span>[8](#fn_219.md) but the
Turkish conqueror was most probably ignorant, that near two thousand
years before his reign, continents by a bridge of boats.  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[9](#fn_220.md) At a small distance from the old castles
we discover the little town of Chrysopolis, or Scutari, which may almost
be considered as the Asiatic suburb of Constantinople. The Bosphorus, as
it begins to open into the Propontis, passes between Byzantium and
Chalcedon. The latter of those cities was built by the Greeks, a few
years before the former; and the blindness of its founders, who
overlooked the superior advantages of the opposite coast, has been
stigmatized by a proverbial expression of contempt.  <span
id="fr_221"></span>[10](#fn_221.md)

The harbor of Constantinople, which may be considered as an arm of the
Bosphorus, obtained, in a very remote period, the denomination of the
Golden Horn. The curve which it describes might be compared to the horn
of a stag, or as it should seem, with more propriety, to that of an ox.
 <span id="fr_222"></span>[11](#fn_222.md) The epithet of golden was
expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant
countries into the secure and capacious port of Constantinople. The
River Lycus, formed by the conflux of two little streams, pours into the
harbor a perpetual supply of fresh water, which serves to cleanse the
bottom, and to invite the periodical shoals of fish to seek their
retreat in that convenient recess. As the vicissitudes of tides are
scarcely felt in those seas, the constant depth of the harbor allows
goods to be landed on the quays without the assistance of boats; and it
has been observed, that in many places the largest vessels may rest
their prows against the houses, while their sterns are floating in the
water.  <span id="fr_223"></span>[12](#fn_223.md) From the mouth of the
Lycus to that of the harbor, this arm of the Bosphorus is more than
seven miles in length. The entrance is about five hundred yards broad,
and a strong chain could be occasionally drawn across it, to guard the
port and city from the attack of a hostile navy.  <span
id="fr_224"></span>[13](#fn_224.md)

Between the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, the shores of Europe and Asia,
receding on either side, enclose the sea of Marmara, which was known to
the ancients by the denomination of Propontis. The navigation from the
issue of the Bosphorus to the entrance of the Hellespont is about one
hundred and twenty miles. Those who steer their westward course through
the middle of the Propontis, amt at once descry the high lands of Thrace
and Bithynia, and never lose sight of the lofty summit of Mount Olympus,
covered with eternal snows.  <span id="fr_225"></span>[14](#fn_225.md) They
leave on the left a deep gulf, at the bottom of which Nicomedia was
seated, the Imperial residence of Diocletian; and they pass the small
islands of Cyzicus and Proconnesus before they cast anchor at Gallipoli;
where the sea, which separates Asia from Europe, is again contracted
into a narrow channel.

The geographers who, with the most skilful accuracy, have surveyed the
form and extent of the Hellespont, assign about sixty miles for the
winding course, and about three miles for the ordinary breadth of those
celebrated straits.  <span id="fr_226"></span>[15](#fn_226.md) But the
narrowest part of the channel is found to the northward of the old
Turkish castles between the cities of Sestus and Abydus. It was here
that the adventurous Leander braved the passage of the flood for the
possession of his mistress.  <span id="fr_227"></span>[16](#fn_227.md) It
was here likewise, in a place where the distance between the opposite
banks cannot exceed five hundred paces, that Xerxes imposed a stupendous
bridge of boats, for the purpose of transporting into Europe a hundred
and seventy myriads of barbarians.  <span
id="fr_228"></span>[17](#fn_228.md) A sea contracted within such narrow
limits may seem but ill to deserve the singular epithet of broad, which
Homer, as well as Orpheus, has frequently bestowed on the Hellespont.
 <span id="fr_229"></span>[\*\_0023](#fn_229.md) But our ideas of greatness
are of a relative nature: the traveller, and especially the poet, who
sailed along the Hellespont, who pursued the windings of the stream, and
contemplated the rural scenery, which appeared on every side to
terminate the prospect, insensibly lost the remembrance of the sea; and
his fancy painted those celebrated straits, with all the attributes of a
mighty river flowing with a swift current, in the midst of a woody and
inland country, and at length, through a wide mouth, discharging itself
into the Aegean or Archipelago.  <span id="fr_230"></span>[18](#fn_230.md)
Ancient Troy,  <span id="fr_231"></span>[19](#fn_231.md) seated on a an
eminence at the foot of Mount Ida, overlooked the mouth of the
Hellespont, which scarcely received an accession of waters from the
tribute of those immortal rivulets the Simois and Scamander. The Grecian
camp had stretched twelve miles along the shore from the Sigaean to the
Rhaetean promontory; and the flanks of the army were guarded by the
bravest chiefs who fought under the banners of Agamemnon. The first of
those promontories was occupied by Achilles with his invincible
myrmidons, and the dauntless Ajax pitched his tents on the other. After
Ajax had fallen a sacrifice to his disappointed pride, and to the
ingratitude of the Greeks, his sepulchre was erected on the ground where
he had defended the navy against the rage of Jove and of Hector; and the
citizens of the rising town of Rhaeteum celebrated his memory with
divine honors.  <span id="fr_232"></span>[20](#fn_232.md) Before
Constantine gave a just preference to the situation of Byzantium, he had
conceived the design of erecting the seat of empire on this celebrated
spot, from whence the Romans derived their fabulous origin. The
extensive plain which lies below ancient Troy, towards the Rhaetean
promontory and the tomb of Ajax, was first chosen for his new capital;
and though the undertaking was soon relinquished the stately remains of
unfinished walls and towers attracted the notice of all who sailed
through the straits of the Hellespont.  <span
id="fr_233"></span>[21](#fn_233.md)

We are at present qualified to view the advantageous position of
Constantinople; which appears to have been formed by nature for the
centre and capital of a great monarchy. Situated in the forty-first
degree of latitude, the Imperial city commanded, from her seven hills,
 <span id="fr_234"></span>[22](#fn_234.md) the opposite shores of Europe
and Asia; the climate was healthy and temperate, the soil fertile, the
harbor secure and capacious; and the approach on the side of the
continent was of small extent and easy defence. The Bosphorus and the
Hellespont may be considered as the two gates of Constantinople; and the
prince who possessed those important passages could always shut them
against a naval enemy, and open them to the fleets of commerce. The
preservation of the eastern provinces may, in some degree, be ascribed
to the policy of Constantine, as the barbarians of the Euxine, who in
the preceding age had poured their armaments into the heart of the
Mediterranean, soon desisted from the exercise of piracy, and despaired
of forcing this insurmountable barrier. When the gates of the Hellespont
and Bosphorus were shut, the capital still enjoyed within their spacious
enclosure every production which could supply the wants, or gratify the
luxury, of its numerous inhabitants. The sea-coasts of Thrace and
Bithynia, which languish under the weight of Turkish oppression, still
exhibit a rich prospect of vineyards, of gardens, and of plentiful
harvests; and the Propontis has ever been renowned for an inexhaustible
store of the most exquisite fish, that are taken in their stated
seasons, without skill, and almost without labor.  <span
id="fr_235"></span>[23](#fn_235.md) But when the passages of the straits
were thrown open for trade, they alternately admitted the natural and
artificial riches of the north and south, of the Euxine, and of the
Mediterranean. Whatever rude commodities were collected in the forests
of Germany and Scythia, and far as the sources of the Tanais and the
Borysthenes; whatsoever was manufactured by the skill of Europe or Asia;
the corn of Egypt, and the gems and spices of the farthest India, were
brought by the varying winds into the port of Constantinople, which for
many ages attracted the commerce of the ancient world.  <span
id="fr_236"></span>[24](#fn_236.md)

\[See Basilica Of Constantinople\]

The prospect of beauty, of safety, and of wealth, united in a single
spot, was sufficient to justify the choice of Constantine. But as some
decent mixture of prodigy and fable has, in every age, been supposed to
reflect a becoming majesty on the origin of great cities,  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[25](#fn_237.md) the emperor was desirous of ascribing
his resolution, not so much to the uncertain counsels of human policy,
as to the infallible and eternal decrees of divine wisdom. In one of his
laws he has been careful to instruct posterity, that in obedience to the
commands of God, he laid the everlasting foundations of Constantinople:
 <span id="fr_238"></span>[26](#fn_238.md) and though he has not
condescended to relate in what manner the celestial inspiration was
communicated to his mind, the defect of his modest silence has been
liberally supplied by the ingenuity of succeeding writers; who describe
the nocturnal vision which appeared to the fancy of Constantine, as he
slept within the walls of Byzantium. The tutelar genius of the city, a
venerable matron sinking under the weight of years and infirmities, was
suddenly transformed into a blooming maid, whom his own hands adorned
with all the symbols of Imperial greatness.  <span
id="fr_239"></span>[27](#fn_239.md) The monarch awoke, interpreted the
auspicious omen, and obeyed, without hesitation, the will of Heaven The
day which gave birth to a city or colony was celebrated by the Romans
with such ceremonies as had been ordained by a generous superstition;
 <span id="fr_240"></span>[28](#fn_240.md) and though Constantine might
omit some rites which savored too strongly of their Pagan origin, yet he
was anxious to leave a deep impression of hope and respect on the minds
of the spectators. On foot, with a lance in his hand, the emperor
himself led the solemn procession; and directed the line, which was
traced as the boundary of the destined capital: till the growing
circumference was observed with astonishment by the assistants, who, at
length, ventured to observe, that he had already exceeded the most ample
measure of a great city. "I shall still advance," replied Constantine,
"till He, the invisible guide who marches before me, thinks proper to
stop."  <span id="fr_241"></span>[29](#fn_241.md) Without presuming to
investigate the nature or motives of this extraordinary conductor, we
shall content ourselves with the more humble task of describing the
extent and limits of Constantinople.  <span
id="fr_242"></span>[30](#fn_242.md)

In the actual state of the city, the palace and gardens of the Seraglio
occupy the eastern promontory, the first of the seven hills, and cover
about one hundred and fifty acres of our own measure. The seat of
Turkish jealousy and despotism is erected on the foundations of a
Grecian republic; but it may be supposed that the Byzantines were
tempted by the conveniency of the harbor to extend their habitations on
that side beyond the modern limits of the Seraglio. The new walls of
Constantine stretched from the port to the Propontis across the enlarged
breadth of the triangle, at the distance of fifteen stadia from the
ancient fortification; and with the city of Byzantium they enclosed five
of the seven hills, which, to the eyes of those who approach
Constantinople, appear to rise above each other in beautiful order.
 <span id="fr_243"></span>[31](#fn_243.md) About a century after the death
of the founder, the new buildings, extending on one side up the harbor,
and on the other along the Propontis, already covered the narrow ridge
of the sixth, and the broad summit of the seventh hill. The necessity of
protecting those suburbs from the incessant inroads of the barbarians
engaged the younger Theodosius to surround his capital with an adequate
and permanent enclosure of walls.  <span
id="fr_244"></span>[32](#fn_244.md) From the eastern promontory to the
golden gate, the extreme length of Constantinople was about three Roman
miles;  <span id="fr_245"></span>[33](#fn_245.md) the circumference
measured between ten and eleven; and the surface might be computed as
equal to about two thousand English acres. It is impossible to justify
the vain and credulous exaggerations of modern travellers, who have
sometimes stretched the limits of Constantinople over the adjacent
villages of the European, and even of the Asiatic coast.  <span
id="fr_246"></span>[34](#fn_246.md) But the suburbs of Pera and Galata,
though situate beyond the harbor, may deserve to be considered as a part
of the city;  <span id="fr_247"></span>[35](#fn_247.md) and this addition
may perhaps authorize the measure of a Byzantine historian, who assigns
sixteen Greek (about fourteen Roman) miles for the circumference of his
native city.  <span id="fr_248"></span>[36](#fn_248.md) Such an extent may
not seem unworthy of an Imperial residence. Yet Constantinople must
yield to Babylon and Thebes,  <span id="fr_249"></span>[37](#fn_249.md) to
ancient Rome, to London, and even to Paris.  <span
id="fr_250"></span>[38](#fn_250.md)

423, edit. Casaubon. He observes that the peace of the Byzantines was
frequently disturbed, and the extent of their territory contracted, by
the inroads of the wild Thracians.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[2](daf02009.htm#fr_213.md) The navigator Byzas,
who was styled the son of Neptune, founded the city 656 years before the
Christian aera. His followers were drawn from Argos and Megara.
Byzantium was afterwards rebuild and fortified by the Spartan general
Pausanias. See Scaliger Animadvers. ad Euseb. p. 81. Ducange,
Constantinopolis, l. i part i. cap 15, 16. With regard to the wars of
the Byzantines against Philip, the Gauls, and the kings of Bithynia, we
should trust none but the ancient writers who lived before the greatness
of the Imperial city had excited a spirit of flattery and fiction.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[3](daf02009.htm#fr_214.md) The Bosphorus has been
very minutely described by Dionysius of Byzantium, who lived in the time
of Domitian, (Hudson, Geograph Minor, tom. iii.,) and by Gilles or
Gyllius, a French traveller of the XVIth century. Tournefort (Lettre
XV.) seems to have used his own eyes, and the learning of Gyllius. \[Add

<span id="fn_215"></span>[4](daf02009.htm#fr_215.md) There are very few
conjectures so happy as that of Le Clere, (Bibliotehque Universelle,
tom. i. p. 148,) who supposes that the harpies were only locusts. The
Syriac or Phoenician name of those insects, their noisy flight, the
stench and devastation which they occasion, and the north wind which
drives them into the sea, all contribute to form the striking
resemblance.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[5](daf02009.htm#fr_216.md) The residence of
Amycus was in Asia, between the old and the new castles, at a place
called Laurus Insana. That of Phineus was in Europe, near the village of
Mauromole and the Black Sea. See Gyllius de Bosph. l. ii. c. 23.
Tournefort, Lettre XV.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[6](daf02009.htm#fr_217.md) The deception was
occasioned by several pointed rocks, alternately sovered and abandoned
by the waves. At present there are two small islands, one towards either
shore; that of Europe is distinguished by the column of Pompey.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[7](daf02009.htm#fr_218.md) The ancients computed
one hundred and twenty stadia, or fifteen Roman miles. They measured
only from the new castles, but they carried the straits as far as the
town of Chalcedon.

Greek and Assyrian letters, on two marble columns, the names of his

chain was drawn from the Acropolis near the modern Kiosk, to the tower
of Galata; and was supported at convenient distances by large wooden
piles.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[14](daf02009.htm#fr_225.md) Thevenot (Voyages au
Levant, part i. l. i. c. 14) contracts the measure to 125 small Greek
miles. Belon (Observations, l. ii. c. 1.) gives a good description of
the Propontis, but contents himself with the vague expression of one day
and one night's sail. When Sandy's (Travels, p. 21) talks of 150
furlongs in length, as well as breadth we can only suppose some mistake
of the press in the text of that judicious traveller.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[15](daf02009.htm#fr_226.md) See an admirable
dissertation of M. d'Anville upon the Hellespont or Dardanelles, in the
Memoires tom. xxviii. p. 318 - 346. Yet even that ingenious geographer
is too fond of supposing new, and perhaps imaginary measures, for the
purpose of rendering ancient writers as accurate as himself. The stadia
employed by Herodotus in the description of the Euxine, the Bosphorus,
&c., (l. iv. c. 85,) must undoubtedly be all of the same species; but it
seems impossible to reconcile them either with truth or with each other.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[16](daf02009.htm#fr_227.md) The oblique distance
between Sestus and Abydus was thirty stadia. The improbable tale of Hero
and Leander is exposed by M. Mahudel, but is defended on the authority
of poets and medals by M. de la Nauze. See the Academie des
Inscriptions, tom. vii. Hist. p. 74. elem. p. 240. Note: The practical
illustration of the possibility of Leander's feat by Lord Byron and
other English swimmers is too well known to need particularly reference
- M.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[17](daf02009.htm#fr_228.md) See the seventh book
of Herodotus, who has erected an elegant trophy to his own fame and to
that of his country. The review appears to have been made with tolerable
accuracy; but the vanity, first of the Persians, and afterwards of the
Greeks, was interested to magnify the armament and the victory. I should
much doubt whether the invaders have ever outnumbered the men of any
country which they attacked.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[\*\_0023](daf02009.htm#fr_229.md) Gibbon does not
allow greater width between the two nearest points of the shores of the
Hellespont than between those of the Bosphorus; yet all the ancient
writers speak of the Hellespontic strait as broader than the other: they
agree in giving it seven stadia in its narrowest width, (Herod. in Melp.
c. 85. Polym. c. 34. Strabo, p. 591. Plin. iv. c. 12.) which make 875
paces. It is singular that Gibbon, who in the fifteenth note of this
chapter reproaches d'Anville with being fond of supposing new and
perhaps imaginary measures, has here adopted the peculiar measurement
which d'Anville has assigned to the stadium. This great geographer
believes that the ancients had a stadium of fifty-one toises, and it is
that which he applies to the walls of Babylon. Now, seven of these
stadia are equal to about 500 paces, 7 stadia = 2142 feet: 500 paces =
2135 feet 5 inches. - G. See Rennell, Geog. of Herod. p. 121. Add Ukert,
Geographie der Griechen und Romer, v. i. p. 2, 71. - M.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[18](daf02009.htm#fr_230.md) See Wood's
Observations on Homer, p. 320. I have, with pleasure, selected this
remark from an author who in general seems to have disappointed the
expectation of the public as a critic, and still more as a traveller. He
had visited the banks of the Hellespont; and had read Strabo; he ought
to have consulted the Roman itineraries. How was it possible for him to
confound Ilium and Alexandria Troas, (Observations, p. 340, 341,) two
cities which were sixteen miles distant from each other?

Note: Compare Walpole's Memoirs on Turkey, v. i. p. 101. Dr. Clarke
adopted Mr. Walpole's interpretation of the salt Hellespont. But the old
interpretation is more graphic and Homeric. Clarke's Travels, ii. 70. -

<span id="fn_231"></span>[19](daf02009.htm#fr_231.md) Demetrius of Scepsis
wrote sixty books on thirty lines of Homer's catalogue. The XIIIth Book
of Strabo is sufficient for our curiosity.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[20](daf02009.htm#fr_232.md) Strabo, l. xiii. p.
595, \[890, edit. Casaub.\] The disposition of the ships, which were
drawn upon dry land, and the posts of Ajax and Achilles, are very
clearly described by Homer. See Iliad, ix. 220.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[21](daf02009.htm#fr_233.md) Zosim. l. ii. \[c.
30,\] p. 105. Sozomen, l. ii. c. 3. Theophanes, p. 18. Nicephorus
Callistus, l. vii. p. 48. Zonaras, tom. ii. l. xiii. p. 6. Zosimus
places the new city between Ilium and Alexandria, but this apparent
difference may be reconciled by the large extent of its circumference.
Before the foundation of Constantinople, Thessalonica is mentioned by
Cedrenus, (p. 283,) and Sardica by Zonaras, as the intended capital.
They both suppose with very little probability, that the emperor, if he
had not been prevented by a prodigy, would have repeated the mistake of
the blind Chalcedonians.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[22](daf02009.htm#fr_234.md) Pocock's Description
of the East, vol. ii. part ii. p. 127. His plan of the seven hills is
clear and accurate. That traveller is seldom unsatisfactory.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[23](daf02009.htm#fr_235.md) See Belon,
Observations, c. 72 - 76. Among a variety of different species, the
Pelamides, a sort of Thunnies, were the most celebrated. We may learn
from Polybius, Strabo, and Tacitus, that the profits of the fishery
constituted the principal revenue of Byzantium.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[24](daf02009.htm#fr_236.md) See the eloquent
description of Busbequius, epistol. i. p. 64. Est in Europa; habet in
conspectu Asiam, Egyptum. Africamque a dextra: quae tametsi contiguae
non sunt, maris tamen navigandique commoditate veluti junguntur. A
sinistra vero Pontus est Euxinus, &c.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[25](daf02009.htm#fr_237.md) Datur haec venia
antiquitati, ut miscendo humana divinis, primordia urbium augustiora
faciat. T. Liv. in prooem.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[26](daf02009.htm#fr_238.md) He says in one of his
laws, pro commoditate urbis quam aeteras nomine, jubente Deo, donavimus.
Cod. Theodos. l. xiii. tit. v. leg. 7.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[27](daf02009.htm#fr_239.md) The Greeks,
Theophanes, Cedrenus, and the author of the Alexandrian Chronicle,
confine themselves to vague and general expressions. For a more
particular account of the vision, we are obliged to have recourse to
such Latin writers as William of Malmesbury. See Ducange, C. P. l. i. p.
24, 25.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[28](daf02009.htm#fr_240.md) See Plutarch in
Romul. tom. i. p. 49, edit. Bryan. Among other ceremonies, a large hole,
which had been dug for that purpose, was filled up with handfuls of
earth, which each of the settlers brought from the place of his birth,
and thus adopted his new country.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[29](daf02009.htm#fr_241.md) Philostorgius, l. ii.
c. 9. This incident, though borrowed from a suspected writer, is
characteristic and probable.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[30](daf02009.htm#fr_242.md) See in the Memoires
de l'Academie, tom. xxxv p. 747 - 758, a dissertation of M. d'Anville on
the extent of Constantinople. He takes the plan inserted in the Imperium
Orientale of Banduri as the most complete; but, by a series of very nice
observations, he reduced the extravagant proportion of the scale, and
instead of 9500, determines the circumference of the city as consisting
of about 7800 French toises.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[31](daf02009.htm#fr_243.md) Codinus, Antiquitat.
Const. p. 12. He assigns the church of St. Anthony as the boundary on
the side of the harbor. It is mentioned in Ducange, l. iv. c. 6; but I
have tried, without success, to discover the exact place where it was
situated.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[32](daf02009.htm#fr_244.md) The new wall of
Theodosius was constructed in the year 413. In 447 it was thrown down by
an earthquake, and rebuilt in three months by the diligence of the
praefect Cyrus. The suburb of the Blanchernae was first taken into the
city in the reign of Heraclius Ducange, Const. l. i. c. 10, 11.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[33](daf02009.htm#fr_245.md) The measurement is
expressed in the Notitia by 14,075 feet. It is reasonable to suppose
that these were Greek feet, the proportion of which has been ingeniously
determined by M. d'Anville. He compares the 180 feet with 78 Hashemite
cubits, which in different writers are assigned for the heights of St.
Sophia. Each of these cubits was equal to 27 French inches.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[34](daf02009.htm#fr_246.md) The accurate Thevenot
(l. i. c. 15) walked in one hour and three quarters round two of the
sides of the triangle, from the Kiosk of the Seraglio to the seven
towers. D'Anville examines with care, and receives with confidence, this
decisive testimony, which gives a circumference of ten or twelve miles.
The extravagant computation of Tournefort (Lettre XI) of thirty-tour or
thirty miles, without including Scutari, is a strange departure from his
usual character.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[35](daf02009.htm#fr_247.md) The sycae, or
fig-trees, formed the thirteenth region, and were very much embellished
by Justinian. It has since borne the names of Pera and Galata. The
etymology of the former is obvious; that of the latter is unknown. See
Ducange, Const. l. i. c. 22, and Gyllius de Byzant. l. iv. c. 10.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[36](daf02009.htm#fr_248.md) One hundred and
eleven stadia, which may be translated into modern Greek miles each of
seven stadia, or 660, sometimes only 600 French toises. See D'Anville,
Mesures Itineraires, p. 53.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[37](daf02009.htm#fr_249.md) When the ancient
texts, which describe the size of Babylon and Thebes, are settled, the
exaggerations reduced, and the measures ascertained, we find that those
famous cities filled the great but not incredible circumference of about
twenty-five or thirty miles. Compare D'Anville, Mem. de l'Academie, tom.
xxviii. p. 235, with his Description de l'Egypte, p. 201, 202.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[38](daf02009.htm#fr_250.md) If we divide
Constantinople and Paris into equal squares of 50 French toises, the
former contains 850, and the latter 1160, of those divisions.
