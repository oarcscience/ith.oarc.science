### Chapter XIX: Constantius Sole Emperor. Part I.

Constantius Sole Emperor. - Elevation And Death Of Gallus. - Danger And
Elevation Of Julian. - Sarmatian And Persian Wars. - Victories Of Julian
In Gaul.

The divided provinces of the empire were again united by the victory of
Constantius; but as that feeble prince was destitute of personal merit,
either in peace or war; as he feared his generals, and distrusted his
ministers; the triumph of his arms served only to establish the reign of
the eunuchs over the Roman world. Those unhappy beings, the ancient
production of Oriental jealousy and despotism,  <span
id="fr_524"></span>[1](#fn_524.md) were introduced into Greece and Rome by
the contagion of Asiatic luxury.  <span id="fr_525"></span>[2](#fn_525.md)
Their progress was rapid; and the eunuchs, who, in the time of Augustus,
had been abhorred, as the monstrous retinue of an Egyptian queen,  <span
id="fr_526"></span>[3](#fn_526.md) were gradually admitted into the
families of matrons, of senators, and of the emperors themselves.  <span
id="fr_527"></span>[4](#fn_527)  <span id="fr_528"></span>[5](#fn_528.md)
Restrained by the severe edicts of Domitian and Nerva, cherished by the
pride of Diocletian, reduced to an humble station by the prudence of
Constantine,  <span id="fr_529"></span>[6](#fn_529.md) they multiplied in
the palaces of his degenerate sons, and insensibly acquired the
knowledge, and at length the direction, of the secret councils of
Constantius. The aversion and contempt which mankind had so uniformly
entertained for that imperfect species, appears to have degraded their
character, and to have rendered them almost as incapable as they were
supposed to be, of conceiving any generous sentiment, or of performing
any worthy action.  <span id="fr_530"></span>[7](#fn_530.md) But the
eunuchs were skilled in the arts of flattery and intrigue; and they
alternately governed the mind of Constantius by his fears, his
indolence, and his vanity.  <span id="fr_531"></span>[8](#fn_531.md) Whilst
he viewed in a deceitful mirror the fair appearance of public
prosperity, he supinely permitted them to intercept the complaints of
the injured provinces, to accumulate immense treasures by the sale of
justice and of honors; to disgrace the most important dignities, by the
promotion of those who had purchased at their hands the powers of
oppression,  <span id="fr_532"></span>[9](#fn_532.md) and to gratify their
resentment against the few independent spirits, who arrogantly refused
to solicit the protection of slaves. Of these slaves the most
distinguished was the chamberlain Eusebius, who ruled the monarch and
the palace with such absolute sway, that Constantius, according to the
sarcasm of an impartial historian, possessed some credit with this
haughty favorite.  <span id="fr_533"></span>[10](#fn_533.md) By his artful
suggestions, the emperor was persuaded to subscribe the condemnation of
the unfortunate Gallus, and to add a new crime to the long list of
unnatural murders which pollute the honor of the house of Constantine.

When the two nephews of Constantine, Gallus and Julian, were saved from
the fury of the soldiers, the former was about twelve, and the latter
about six, years of age; and, as the eldest was thought to be of a
sickly constitution, they obtained with the less difficulty a precarious
and dependent life, from the affected pity of Constantius, who was
sensible that the execution of these helpless orphans would have been
esteemed, by all mankind, an act of the most deliberate cruelty.  <span
id="fr_534"></span>[11](#fn_534.md)  <span
id="fr_535"></span>[\*\_0038](#fn_535.md) Different cities of Ionia and
Bithynia were assigned for the places of their exile and education; but
as soon as their growing years excited the jealousy of the emperor, he
judged it more prudent to secure those unhappy youths in the strong
castle of Macellum, near Caesarea. The treatment which they experienced
during a six years' confinement, was partly such as they could hope from
a careful guardian, and partly such as they might dread from a
suspicious tyrant.  <span id="fr_536"></span>[12](#fn_536.md) Their prison
was an ancient palace, the residence of the kings of Cappadocia; the
situation was pleasant, the buildings of stately, the enclosure
spacious. They pursued their studies, and practised their exercises,
under the tuition of the most skilful masters; and the numerous
household appointed to attend, or rather to guard, the nephews of
Constantine, was not unworthy of the dignity of their birth. But they
could not disguise to themselves that they were deprived of fortune, of
freedom, and of safety; secluded from the society of all whom they could
trust or esteem, and condemned to pass their melancholy hours in the
company of slaves devoted to the commands of a tyrant who had already
injured them beyond the hope of reconciliation. At length, however, the
emergencies of the state compelled the emperor, or rather his eunuchs,
to invest Gallus, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, with the title of
Caesar, and to cement this political connection by his marriage with the
princess Constantina. After a formal interview, in which the two princes
mutually engaged their faith never to undertake any thing to the
prejudice of each other, they repaired without delay to their respective
stations. Constantius continued his march towards the West, and Gallus
fixed his residence at Antioch; from whence, with a delegated authority,
he administered the five great dioceses of the eastern praefecture.
 <span id="fr_537"></span>[13](#fn_537.md) In this fortunate change, the
new Caesar was not unmindful of his brother Julian, who obtained the
honors of his rank, the appearances of liberty, and the restitution of
an ample patrimony.  <span id="fr_538"></span>[14](#fn_538.md)

The writers the most indulgent to the memory of Gallus, and even Julian
himself, though he wished to cast a veil over the frailties of his
brother, are obliged to confess that the Caesar was incapable of
reigning. Transported from a prison to a throne, he possessed neither
genius nor application, nor docility to compensate for the want of
knowledge and experience. A temper naturally morose and violent, instead
of being corrected, was soured by solitude and adversity; the
remembrance of what he had endured disposed him to retaliation rather
than to sympathy; and the ungoverned sallies of his rage were often
fatal to those who approached his person, or were subject to his power.
 <span id="fr_539"></span>[15](#fn_539.md) Constantina, his wife, is
described, not as a woman, but as one of the infernal furies tormented
with an insatiate thirst of human blood.  <span
id="fr_540"></span>[16](#fn_540.md) Instead of employing her influence to
insinuate the mild counsels of prudence and humanity, she exasperated
the fierce passions of her husband; and as she retained the vanity,
though she had renounced, the gentleness of her sex, a pearl necklace
was esteemed an equivalent price for the murder of an innocent and
virtuous nobleman.  <span id="fr_541"></span>[17](#fn_541.md) The cruelty
of Gallus was sometimes displayed in the undissembled violence of
popular or military executions; and was sometimes disguised by the abuse
of law, and the forms of judicial proceedings. The private houses of
Antioch, and the places of public resort, were besieged by spies and
informers; and the Caesar himself, concealed in a a plebeian habit, very
frequently condescended to assume that odious character. Every apartment
of the palace was adorned with the instruments of death and torture, and
a general consternation was diffused through the capital of Syria. The
prince of the East, as if he had been conscious how much he had to fear,
and how little he deserved to reign, selected for the objects of his
resentment the provincials accused of some imaginary treason, and his
own courtiers, whom with more reason he suspected of incensing, by their
secret correspondence, the timid and suspicious mind of Constantius. But
he forgot that he was depriving himself of his only support, the
affection of the people; whilst he furnished the malice of his enemies
with the arms of truth, and afforded the emperor the fairest pretence of
exacting the forfeit of his purple, and of his life.  <span
id="fr_542"></span>[18](#fn_542.md)

As long as the civil war suspended the fate of the Roman world,
Constantius dissembled his knowledge of the weak and cruel
administration to which his choice had subjected the East; and the
discovery of some assassins, secretly despatched to Antioch by the
tyrant of Gaul, was employed to convince the public, that the emperor
and the Caesar were united by the same interest, and pursued by the same
enemies.  <span id="fr_543"></span>[19](#fn_543.md) But when the victory
was decided in favor of Constantius, his dependent colleague became less
useful and less formidable. Every circumstance of his conduct was
severely and suspiciously examined, and it was privately resolved,
either to deprive Gallus of the purple, or at least to remove him from
the indolent luxury of Asia to the hardships and dangers of a German
war. The death of Theophilus, consular of the province of Syria, who in
a time of scarcity had been massacred by the people of Antioch, with the
connivance, and almost at the instigation, of Gallus, was justly
resented, not only as an act of wanton cruelty, but as a dangerous
insult on the supreme majesty of Constantius. Two ministers of
illustrious rank, Domitian the Oriental praefect, and Montius, quaestor
of the palace, were empowered by a special commission  <span
id="fr_544"></span>[\*\_0039](#fn_544.md) to visit and reform the state of
the East. They were instructed to behave towards Gallus with moderation
and respect, and, by the gentlest arts of persuasion, to engage him to
comply with the invitation of his brother and colleague. The rashness of
the praefect disappointed these prudent measures, and hastened his own
ruin, as well as that of his enemy. On his arrival at Antioch, Domitian
passed disdainfully before the gates of the palace, and alleging a
slight pretence of indisposition, continued several days in sullen
retirement, to prepare an inflammatory memorial, which he transmitted to
the Imperial court. Yielding at length to the pressing solicitations of
Gallus, the praefect condescended to take his seat in council; but his
first step was to signify a concise and haughty mandate, importing that
the Caesar should immediately repair to Italy, and threatening that he
himself would punish his delay or hesitation, by suspending the usual
allowance of his household. The nephew and daughter of Constantine, who
could ill brook the insolence of a subject, expressed their resentment
by instantly delivering Domitian to the custody of a guard. The quarrel
still admitted of some terms of accommodation. They were rendered
impracticable by the imprudent behavior of Montius, a statesman whose
arts and experience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his
disposition.  <span id="fr_545"></span>[20](#fn_545.md) The quaestor
reproached Gallus in a haughty language, that a prince who was scarcely
authorized to remove a municipal magistrate, should presume to imprison
a Praetorian praefect; convoked a meeting of the civil and military
officers; and required them, in the name of their sovereign, to defend
the person and dignity of his representatives. By this rash declaration
of war, the impatient temper of Gallus was provoked to embrace the most
desperate counsels. He ordered his guards to stand to their arms,
assembled the populace of Antioch, and recommended to their zeal the
care of his safety and revenge. His commands were too fatally obeyed.
They rudely seized the praefect and the quaestor, and tying their legs
together with ropes, they dragged them through the streets of the city,
inflicted a thousand insults and a thousand wounds on these unhappy
victims, and at last precipitated their mangled and lifeless bodies into
the stream of the Orontes.  <span id="fr_546"></span>[21](#fn_546.md)

After such a deed, whatever might have been the designs of Gallus, it
was only in a field of battle that he could assert his innocence with
any hope of success. But the mind of that prince was formed of an equal
mixture of violence and weakness. Instead of assuming the title of
Augustus, instead of employing in his defence the troops and treasures
of the East, he suffered himself to be deceived by the affected
tranquillity of Constantius, who, leaving him the vain pageantry of a
court, imperceptibly recalled the veteran legions from the provinces of
Asia. But as it still appeared dangerous to arrest Gallus in his
capital, the slow and safer arts of dissimulation were practised with
success. The frequent and pressing epistles of Constantius were filled
with professions of confidence and friendship; exhorting the Caesar to
discharge the duties of his high station, to relieve his colleague from
a part of the public cares, and to assist the West by his presence, his
counsels, and his arms. After so many reciprocal injuries, Gallus had
reason to fear and to distrust. But he had neglected the opportunities
of flight and of resistance; he was seduced by the flattering assurances
of the tribune Scudilo, who, under the semblance of a rough soldier,
disguised the most artful insinuation; and he depended on the credit of
his wife Constantina, till the unseasonable death of that princess
completed the ruin in which he had been involved by her impetuous
passions.  <span id="fr_547"></span>[22](#fn_547.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_524"></span>[1](daf02019.htm#fr_524.md) Ammianus (l. xiv. c.
6) imputes the first practice of castration to the cruel ingenuity of
Semiramis, who is supposed to have reigned above nineteen hundred years
before Christ. The use of eunuchs is of high antiquity, both in Asia and
Egypt. They are mentioned in the law of Moses, Deuteron. xxxiii. 1. See
Goguet, Origines des Loix, &c., Part i. l. i. c. 3.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[2](daf02019.htm#fr_525.md) Eunuchum dixti velle
te;

Quia solae utuntur his reginae - Terent. Eunuch. act i. scene 2.

This play is translated from Meander, and the original must have
appeared soon after the eastern conquests of Alexander.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[3](daf02019.htm#fr_526.md) Miles. . . .
spadonibus

Servire rugosis potest. Horat. Carm. v. 9, and Dacier ad loe.

By the word spado, the Romans very forcibly expressed their abhorrence
of this mutilated condition. The Greek appellation of eunuchs, which
insensibly prevailed, had a milder sound, and a more ambiguous sense.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[4](daf02019.htm#fr_527.md) We need only mention
Posides, a freedman and eunuch of Claudius, in whose favor the emperor
prostituted some of the most honorable rewards of military valor. See
Sueton. in Claudio, c. 28. Posides employed a great part of his wealth
in building.

Ut Spado vincebat Capitolia Nostra Posides. Juvenal. Sat. xiv.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[5](daf02019.htm#fr_528.md) Castrari mares vetuit.
Sueton. in Domitian. c. 7. See Dion Cassius, l. lxvii. p. 1107, l.
lxviii. p. 1119.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[6](daf02019.htm#fr_529.md) There is a passage in
the Augustan History, p. 137, in which Lampridius, whilst he praises
Alexander Severus and Constantine for restraining the tyranny of the
eunuchs, deplores the mischiefs which they occasioned in other reigns.
Huc accedit quod eunuchos nec in consiliis nec in ministeriis habuit;
qui soli principes perdunt, dum eos more gentium aut regum Persarum
volunt vivere; qui a populo etiam amicissimum semovent; qui internuntii
sunt, aliud quam respondetur, referentes; claudentes principem suum, et
agentes ante omnia ne quid sciat.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[7](daf02019.htm#fr_530.md) Xenophon (Cyropaedia,
l. viii. p. 540) has stated the specious reasons which engaged Cyrus to
intrust his person to the guard of eunuchs. He had observed in animals,
that although the practice of castration might tame their ungovernable
fierceness, it did not diminish their strength or spirit; and he
persuaded himself, that those who were separated from the rest of human
kind, would be more firmly attached to the person of their benefactor.
But a long experience has contradicted the judgment of Cyrus. Some
particular instances may occur of eunuchs distinguished by their
fidelity, their valor, and their abilities; but if we examine the
general history of Persia, India, and China, we shall find that the
power of the eunuchs has uniformly marked the decline and fall of every
dynasty.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[8](daf02019.htm#fr_531.md) See Ammianus
Marcellinus, l. xxi. c. 16, l. xxii. c. 4. The whole tenor of his
impartial history serves to justify the invectives of Mamertinus, of
Libanius, and of Julian himself, who have insulted the vices of the
court of Constantius.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[9](daf02019.htm#fr_532.md) Aurelius Victor
censures the negligence of his sovereign in choosing the governors of
the provinces, and the generals of the army, and concludes his history
with a very bold observation, as it is much more dangerous under a
feeble reign to attack the ministers than the master himself. "Uti verum
absolvam brevi, ut Imperatore ipso clarius ita apparitorum plerisque
magis atrox nihil."

<span id="fn_533"></span>[10](daf02019.htm#fr_533.md) Apud quem (si vere
dici debeat) multum Constantius potuit. Ammian. l. xviii. c. 4.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[11](daf02019.htm#fr_534.md) Gregory Nazianzen
(Orat. iii. p. 90) reproaches the apostate with his ingratitude towards
Mark, bishop of Arethusa, who had contributed to save his life; and we
learn, though from a less respectable authority, (Tillemont, Hist. des
Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 916,) that Julian was concealed in the sanctuary
of a church.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[\*\_0038](daf02019.htm#fr_535.md) Gallus and
Julian were not sons of the same mother. Their father, Julius
Constantius, had had Gallus by his first wife, named Galla: Julian was
the son of Basilina, whom he had espoused in a second marriage.
Tillemont. Hist. des Emp. Vie de Constantin. art. 3. - G.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[12](daf02019.htm#fr_536.md) The most authentic
account of the education and adventures of Julian is contained in the
epistle or manifesto which he himself addressed to the senate and people
of Athens. Libanius, (Orat. Parentalis,) on the side of the Pagans, and
Socrates, (l. iii. c. 1,) on that of the Christians, have preserved
several interesting circumstances.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[13](daf02019.htm#fr_537.md) For the promotion of
Gallus, see Idatius, Zosimus, and the two Victors. According to
Philostorgius, (l. iv. c. 1,) Theophilus, an Arian bishop, was the
witness, and, as it were, the guarantee of this solemn engagement. He
supported that character with generous firmness; but M. de Tillemont
(Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 1120) thinks it very improbable that a
heretic should have possessed such virtue.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[14](daf02019.htm#fr_538.md) Julian was at first
permitted to pursue his studies at Constantinople, but the reputation
which he acquired soon excited the jealousy of Constantius; and the
young prince was advised to withdraw himself to the less conspicuous
scenes of Bithynia and Ionia.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[15](daf02019.htm#fr_539.md) See Julian. ad S. P.
Q. A. p. 271. Jerom. in Chron. Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, x. 14. I
shall copy the words of Eutropius, who wrote his abridgment about
fifteen years after the death of Gallus, when there was no longer any
motive either to flatter or to depreciate his character. "Multis
incivilibus gestis Gallus Caesar . . . . vir natura ferox et ad
tyrannidem pronior, si suo jure imperare licuisset."

<span id="fn_540"></span>[16](daf02019.htm#fr_540.md) Megaera quidem
mortalis, inflammatrix saevientis assidua, humani cruoris avida, &c.
Ammian. Marcellin. l. xiv. c. 1. The sincerity of Ammianus would not
suffer him to misrepresent facts or characters, but his love of
ambitious ornaments frequently betrayed him into an unnatural vehemence
of expression.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[17](daf02019.htm#fr_541.md) His name was
Clematius of Alexandria, and his only crime was a refusal to gratify the
desires of his mother-in-law; who solicited his death, because she had
been disappointed of his love. Ammian. xiv. c. i.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[18](daf02019.htm#fr_542.md) See in Ammianus (l.
xiv. c. 1, 7) a very ample detail of the cruelties of Gallus. His
brother Julian (p. 272) insinuates, that a secret conspiracy had been
formed against him; and Zosimus names (l. ii. p. 135) the persons
engaged in it; a minister of considerable rank, and two obscure agents,
who were resolved to make their fortune.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[19](daf02019.htm#fr_543.md) Zonaras, l. xiii.
tom. ii. p. 17, 18. The assassins had seduced a great number of
legionaries; but their designs were discovered and revealed by an old
woman in whose cottage they lodged.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[\*\_0039](daf02019.htm#fr_544.md) The commission
seems to have been granted to Domitian alone. Montius interfered to
support his authority. Amm. Marc. loc. cit. - M

<span id="fn_545"></span>[20](daf02019.htm#fr_545.md) In the present text
of Ammianus, we read Asper, quidem, sed ad lenitatem propensior; which
forms a sentence of contradictory nonsense. With the aid of an old
manuscript, Valesius has rectified the first of these corruptions, and
we perceive a ray of light in the substitution of the word vafer. If we
venture to change lenitatem into lexitatem, this alteration of a single
letter will render the whole passage clear and consistent.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[21](daf02019.htm#fr_546.md) Instead of being
obliged to collect scattered and imperfect hints from various sources,
we now enter into the full stream of the history of Ammianus, and need
only refer to the seventh and ninth chapters of his fourteenth book.
Philostorgius, however, (l. iii. c. 28) though partial to Gallus, should
not be entirely overlooked.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[22](daf02019.htm#fr_547.md) She had preceded her
husband, but died of a fever on the road at a little place in Bithynia,
called Coenum Gallicanum.
