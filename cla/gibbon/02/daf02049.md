### Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The Empire. Part II.

Before Valentinian divided the provinces, he reformed the administration
of the empire. All ranks of subjects, who had been injured or oppressed
under the reign of Julian, were invited to support their public
accusations. The silence of mankind attested the spotless integrity of
the praefect Sallust;  <span id="fr_1359"></span>[29](#fn_1358.md) and his
own pressing solicitations, that he might be permitted to retire from
the business of the state, were rejected by Valentinian with the most
honorable expressions of friendship and esteem. But among the favorites
of the late emperor, there were many who had abused his credulity or
superstition; and who could no longer hope to be protected either by
favor or justice.  <span id="fr_1360"></span>[30](#fn_1359.md) The greater
part of the ministers of the palace, and the governors of the provinces,
were removed from their respective stations; yet the eminent merit of
some officers was distinguished from the obnoxious crowd; and,
notwithstanding the opposite clamors of zeal and resentment, the whole
proceedings of this delicate inquiry appear to have been conducted with
a reasonable share of wisdom and moderation.  <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[31](#fn_1360.md) The festivity of a new reign received
a short and suspicious interruption from the sudden illness of the two
princes; but as soon as their health was restored, they left
Constantinople in the beginning of the spring. In the castle, or palace,
of Mediana, only three miles from Naissus, they executed the solemn and
final division of the Roman empire.  <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[32](#fn_1361.md) Valentinian bestowed on his brother
the rich praefecture of the East, from the Lower Danube to the confines
of Persia; whilst he reserved for his immediate government the warlike
 <span id="fr_1363"></span>[\*\_0073](#fn_1362.md) praefectures of
Illyricum, Italy, and Gaul, from the extremity of Greece to the
Caledonian rampart, and from the rampart of Caledonia to the foot of
Mount Atlas. The provincial administration remained on its former basis;
but a double supply of generals and magistrates was required for two
councils, and two courts: the division was made with a just regard to
their peculiar merit and situation, and seven master-generals were soon
created, either of the cavalry or infantry. When this important business
had been amicably transacted, Valentinian and Valens embraced for the
last time. The emperor of the West established his temporary residence
at Milan; and the emperor of the East returned to Constantinople, to
assume the dominion of fifty provinces, of whose language he was totally
ignorant.  <span id="fr_1364"></span>[33](#fn_1363.md)

The tranquility of the East was soon disturbed by rebellion; and the
throne of Valens was threatened by the daring attempts of a rival whose
affinity to the emperor Julian  <span id="fr_1365"></span>[34](#fn_1364.md)
was his sole merit, and had been his only crime. Procopius had been
hastily promoted from the obscure station of a tribune, and a notary, to
the joint command of the army of Mesopotamia; the public opinion already
named him as the successor of a prince who was destitute of natural
heirs; and a vain rumor was propagated by his friends, or his enemies,
that Julian, before the altar of the Moon at Carrhae, had privately
invested Procopius with the Imperial purple.  <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[35](#fn_1365.md) He endeavored, by his dutiful and
submissive behavior, to disarm the jealousy of Jovian; resigned, without
a contest, his military command; and retired, with his wife and family,
to cultivate the ample patrimony which he possessed in the province of
Cappadocia. These useful and innocent occupations were interrupted by
the appearance of an officer with a band of soldiers, who, in the name
of his new sovereigns, Valentinian and Valens, was despatched to conduct
the unfortunate Procopius either to a perpetual prison or an ignominious
death. His presence of mind procured him a longer respite, and a more
splendid fate. Without presuming to dispute the royal mandate, he
requested the indulgence of a few moments to embrace his weeping family;
and while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful
entertainment, he dexterously escaped to the sea-coast of the Euxine,
from whence he passed over to the country of Bosphorus. In that
sequestered region he remained many months, exposed to the hardships of
exile, of solitude, and of want; his melancholy temper brooding over his
misfortunes, and his mind agitated by the just apprehension, that, if
any accident should discover his name, the faithless Barbarians would
violate, without much scruple, the laws of hospitality. In a moment of
impatience and despair, Procopius embarked in a merchant vessel, which
made sail for Constantinople; and boldly aspired to the rank of a
sovereign, because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a
subject. At first he lurked in the villages of Bithynia, continually
changing his habitation and his disguise.  <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[36](#fn_1366.md) By degrees he ventured into the
capital, trusted his life and fortune to the fidelity of two friends, a
senator and a eunuch, and conceived some hopes of success, from the
intelligence which he obtained of the actual state of public affairs.
The body of the people was infected with a spirit of discontent: they
regretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust, who had been
imprudently dismissed from the praefecture of the East. They despised
the character of Valens, which was rude without vigor, and feeble
without mildness. They dreaded the influence of his father-in- law, the
patrician Petronius, a cruel and rapacious minister, who rigorously
exacted all the arrears of tribute that might remain unpaid since the
reign of the emperor Aurelian. The circumstances were propitious to the
designs of a usurper. The hostile measures of the Persians required the
presence of Valens in Syria: from the Danube to the Euphrates the troops
were in motion; and the capital was occasionally filled with the
soldiers who passed or repassed the Thracian Bosphorus. Two cohorts of
Gaul were persuaded to listen to the secret proposals of the
conspirators; which were recommended by the promise of a liberal
donative; and, as they still revered the memory of Julian, they easily
consented to support the hereditary claim of his proscribed kinsman. At
the dawn of day they were drawn up near the baths of Anastasia; and
Procopius, clothed in a purple garment, more suitable to a player than
to a monarch, appeared, as if he rose from the dead, in the midst of
Constantinople. The soldiers, who were prepared for his reception,
saluted their trembling prince with shouts of joy and vows of fidelity.
Their numbers were soon increased by a band of sturdy peasants,
collected from the adjacent country; and Procopius, shielded by the arms
of his adherents, was successively conducted to the tribunal, the
senate, and the palace. During the first moments of his tumultuous
reign, he was astonished and terrified by the gloomy silence of the
people; who were either ignorant of the cause, or apprehensive of the
event. But his military strength was superior to any actual resistance:
the malecontents flocked to the standard of rebellion; the poor were
excited by the hopes, and the rich were intimidated by the fear, of a
general pillage; and the obstinate credulity of the multitude was once
more deceived by the promised advantages of a revolution. The
magistrates were seized; the prisons and arsenals broke open; the gates,
and the entrance of the harbor, were diligently occupied; and, in a few
hours, Procopius became the absolute, though precarious, master of the
Imperial city.  <span id="fr_1368"></span>[\*\_0074](#fn_1367.md) The
usurper improved this unexpected success with some degree of courage and
dexterity. He artfully propagated the rumors and opinions the most
favorable to his interest; while he deluded the populace by giving
audience to the frequent, but imaginary, ambassadors of distant nations.
The large bodies of troops stationed in the cities of Thrace and the
fortresses of the Lower Danube, were gradually involved in the guilt of
rebellion: and the Gothic princes consented to supply the sovereign of
Constantinople with the formidable strength of several thousand
auxiliaries. His generals passed the Bosphorus, and subdued, without an
effort, the unarmed, but wealthy provinces of Bithynia and Asia. After
an honorable defence, the city and island of Cyzicus yielded to his
power; the renowned legions of the Jovians and Herculeans embraced the
cause of the usurper, whom they were ordered to crush; and, as the
veterans were continually augmented with new levies, he soon appeared at
the head of an army, whose valor, as well as numbers, were not unequal
to the greatness of the contest. The son of Hormisdas,  <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[37](#fn_1368.md) a youth of spirit and ability,
condescended to draw his sword against the lawful emperor of the East;
and the Persian prince was immediately invested with the ancient and
extraordinary powers of a Roman Proconsul. The alliance of Faustina, the
widow of the emperor Constantius, who intrusted herself and her daughter
to the hands of the usurper, added dignity and reputation to his cause.
The princess Constantia, who was then about five years of age,
accompanied, in a litter, the march of the army. She was shown to the
multitude in the arms of her adopted father; and, as often as she passed
through the ranks, the tenderness of the soldiers was inflamed into
martial fury:  <span id="fr_1370"></span>[38](#fn_1369.md) they recollected
the glories of the house of Constantine, and they declared, with loyal
acclamation, that they would shed the last drop of their blood in the
defence of the royal infant.  <span id="fr_1371"></span>[39](#fn_1370.md)

In the mean while Valentinian was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful
intelligence of the revolt of the East.  <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[\*\_0075](#fn_1371.md) The difficulties of a German
was forced him to confine his immediate care to the safety of his own
dominions; and, as every channel of communication was stopped or
corrupted, he listened, with doubtful anxiety, to the rumors which were
industriously spread, that the defeat and death of Valens had left
Procopius sole master of the Eastern provinces. Valens was not dead: but
on the news of the rebellion, which he received at Caesarea, he basely
despaired of his life and fortune; proposed to negotiate with the
usurper, and discovered his secret inclination to abdicate the Imperial
purple. The timid monarch was saved from disgrace and ruin by the
firmness of his ministers, and their abilities soon decided in his favor
the event of the civil war. In a season of tranquillity, Sallust had
resigned without a murmur; but as soon as the public safety was
attacked, he ambitiously solicited the preeminence of toil and danger;
and the restoration of that virtuous minister to the praefecture of the
East, was the first step which indicated the repentance of Valens, and
satisfied the minds of the people. The reign of Procopius was apparently
supported by powerful armies and obedient provinces. But many of the
principal officers, military as well as civil, had been urged, either by
motives of duty or interest, to withdraw themselves from the guilty
scene; or to watch the moment of betraying, and deserting, the cause of
the usurper. Lupicinus advanced by hasty marches, to bring the legions
of Syria to the aid of Valens. Arintheus, who, in strength, beauty, and
valor, excelled all the heroes of the age, attacked with a small troop a
superior body of the rebels. When he beheld the faces of the soldiers
who had served under his banner, he commanded them, with a loud voice,
to seize and deliver up their pretended leader; and such was the
ascendant of his genius, that this extraordinary order was instantly
obeyed.  <span id="fr_1373"></span>[40](#fn_1372.md) Arbetio, a respectable
veteran of the great Constantine, who had been distinguished by the
honors of the consulship, was persuaded to leave his retirement, and
once more to conduct an army into the field. In the heat of action,
calmly taking off his helmet, he showed his gray hairs and venerable
countenance: saluted the soldiers of Procopius by the endearing names of
children and companions, and exhorted them no longer to support the
desperate cause of a contemptible tyrant; but to follow their old
commander, who had so often led them to honor and victory. In the two
engagements of Thyatira  <span id="fr_1374"></span>[41](#fn_1373.md) and
Nacolia, the unfortunate Procopius was deserted by his troops, who were
seduced by the instructions and example of their perfidious officers.
After wandering some time among the woods and mountains of Phyrgia, he
was betrayed by his desponding followers, conducted to the Imperial
camp, and immediately beheaded. He suffered the ordinary fate of an
unsuccessful usurper; but the acts of cruelty which were exercised by
the conqueror, under the forms of legal justice, excited the pity and
indignation of mankind.  <span id="fr_1375"></span>[42](#fn_1374.md)  <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[!\_0075](#fn_1375.md)

Such indeed are the common and natural fruits of despotism and
rebellion. But the inquisition into the crime of magic,  <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[!!\_0076](#fn_1376.md) which, under the reign of the
two brothers, was so rigorously prosecuted both at Rome and Antioch, was
interpreted as the fatal symptom, either of the displeasure of Heaven,
or of the depravity of mankind.  <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[43](#fn_1377.md) Let us not hesitate to indulge a
liberal pride, that, in the present age, the enlightened part of Europe
has abolished  <span id="fr_1379"></span>[44](#fn_1378.md) a cruel and
odious prejudice, which reigned in every climate of the globe, and
adhered to every system of religious opinions.  <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[45](#fn_1379.md) The nations, and the sects, of the
Roman world, admitted with equal credulity, and similar abhorrence, the
reality of that infernal art,  <span id="fr_1381"></span>[46](#fn_1380.md)
which was able to control the eternal order of the planets, and the
voluntary operations of the human mind. They dreaded the mysterious
power of spells and incantations, of potent herbs, and execrable rites;
which could extinguish or recall life, inflame the passions of the soul,
blast the works of creation, and extort from the reluctant daemons the
secrets of futurity. They believed, with the wildest inconsistency, that
this preternatural dominion of the air, of earth, and of hell, was
exercised, from the vilest motives of malice or gain, by some wrinkled
hags and itinerant sorcerers, who passed their obscure lives in penury
and contempt.  <span id="fr_1382"></span>[47](#fn_1381.md) The arts of
magic were equally condemned by the public opinion, and by the laws of
Rome; but as they tended to gratify the most imperious passions of the
heart of man, they were continually proscribed, and continually
practised.  <span id="fr_1383"></span>[48](#fn_1382.md) An imaginary cause
as capable of producing the most serious and mischievous effects. The
dark predictions of the death of an emperor, or the success of a
conspiracy, were calculated only to stimulate the hopes of ambition, and
to dissolve the ties of fidelity; and the intentional guilt of magic was
aggravated by the actual crimes of treason and sacrilege.  <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[49](#fn_1383.md) Such vain terrors disturbed the peace
of society, and the happiness of individuals; and the harmless flame
which insensibly melted a waxen image, might derive a powerful and
pernicious energy from the affrighted fancy of the person whom it was
maliciously designed to represent.  <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[50](#fn_1384.md) From the infusion of those herbs,
which were supposed to possess a supernatural influence, it was an easy
step to the use of more substantial poison; and the folly of mankind
sometimes became the instrument, and the mask, of the most atrocious
crimes. As soon as the zeal of informers was encouraged by the ministers
of Valens and Valentinian, they could not refuse to listen to another
charge, too frequently mingled in the scenes of domestic guilt; a charge
of a softer and less malignant nature, for which the pious, though
excessive, rigor of Constantine had recently decreed the punishment of
death.  <span id="fr_1386"></span>[51](#fn_1385.md) This deadly and
incoherent mixture of treason and magic, of poison and adultery,
afforded infinite gradations of guilt and innocence, of excuse and
aggravation, which in these proceedings appear to have been confounded
by the angry or corrupt passions of the judges. They easily discovered
that the degree of their industry and discernment was estimated, by the
Imperial court, according to the number of executions that were
furnished from the respective tribunals. It was not without extreme
reluctance that they pronounced a sentence of acquittal; but they
eagerly admitted such evidence as was stained with perjury, or procured
by torture, to prove the most improbable charges against the most
respectable characters. The progress of the inquiry continually opened
new subjects of criminal prosecution; the audacious informer, whose
falsehood was detected, retired with impunity; but the wretched victim,
who discovered his real or pretended accomplices, were seldom permitted
to receive the price of his infamy. From the extremity of Italy and
Asia, the young, and the aged, were dragged in chains to the tribunals
of Rome and Antioch. Senators, matrons, and philosophers, expired in
ignominious and cruel tortures. The soldiers, who were appointed to
guard the prisons, declared, with a murmur of pity and indignation, that
their numbers were insufficient to oppose the flight, or resistance, of
the multitude of captives. The wealthiest families were ruined by fines
and confiscations; the most innocent citizens trembled for their safety;
and we may form some notion of the magnitude of the evil, from the
extravagant assertion of an ancient writer, that, in the obnoxious
provinces, the prisoners, the exiles, and the fugitives, formed the
greatest part of the inhabitants.  <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[52](#fn_1386.md)

When Tacitus describes the deaths of the innocent and illustrious
Romans, who were sacrificed to the cruelty of the first Caesars, the art
of the historian, or the merit of the sufferers, excites in our breast
the most lively sensations of terror, of admiration, and of pity. The
coarse and undistinguishing pencil of Ammianus has delineated his bloody
figures with tedious and disgusting accuracy. But as our attention is no
longer engaged by the contrast of freedom and servitude, of recent
greatness and of actual misery, we should turn with horror from the
frequent executions, which disgraced, both at Rome and Antioch, the
reign of the two brothers.  <span id="fr_1388"></span>[53](#fn_1387.md)
Valens was of a timid,  <span id="fr_1389"></span>[54](#fn_1388.md) and
Valentinian of a choleric, disposition.  <span
id="fr_1390"></span>[55](#fn_1389.md) An anxious regard to his personal
safety was the ruling principle of the administration of Valens. In the
condition of a subject, he had kissed, with trembling awe, the hand of
the oppressor; and when he ascended the throne, he reasonably expected,
that the same fears, which had subdued his own mind, would secure the
patient submission of his people. The favorites of Valens obtained, by
the privilege of rapine and confiscation, the wealth which his economy
would have refused.  <span id="fr_1391"></span>[56](#fn_1390.md) They
urged, with persuasive eloquence, that, in all cases of treason,
suspicion is equivalent to proof; that the power supposes the intention,
of mischief; that the intention is not less criminal than the act; and
that a subject no longer deserves to live, if his life may threaten the
safety, or disturb the repose, of his sovereign. The judgment of
Valentinian was sometimes deceived, and his confidence abused; but he
would have silenced the informers with a contemptuous smile, had they
presumed to alarm his fortitude by the sound of danger. They praised his
inflexible love of justice; and, in the pursuit of justice, the emperor
was easily tempted to consider clemency as a weakness, and passion as a
virtue. As long as he wrestled with his equals, in the bold competition
of an active and ambitious life, Valentinian was seldom injured, and
never insulted, with impunity: if his prudence was arraigned, his spirit
was applauded; and the proudest and most powerful generals were
apprehensive of provoking the resentment of a fearless soldier. After he
became master of the world, he unfortunately forgot, that where no
resistance can be made, no courage can be exerted; and instead of
consulting the dictates of reason and magnanimity, he indulged the
furious emotions of his temper, at a time when they were disgraceful to
himself, and fatal to the defenceless objects of his displeasure. In the
government of his household, or of his empire, slight, or even
imaginary, offences - a hasty word, a casual omission, an involuntary
delay - were chastised by a sentence of immediate death. The expressions
which issued the most readily from the mouth of the emperor of the West
were, "Strike off his head;" "Burn him alive;" "Let him be beaten with
clubs till he expires;"  <span id="fr_1392"></span>[57](#fn_1391.md) and
his most favored ministers soon understood, that, by a rash attempt to
dispute, or suspend, the execution of his sanguinary commands, they
might involve themselves in the guilt and punishment of disobedience.
The repeated gratification of this savage justice hardened the mind of
Valentinian against pity and remorse; and the sallies of passion were
confirmed by the habits of cruelty.  <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[58](#fn_1392.md) He could behold with calm
satisfaction the convulsive agonies of torture and death; he reserved
his friendship for those faithful servants whose temper was the most
congenial to his own. The merit of Maximin, who had slaughtered the
noblest families of Rome, was rewarded with the royal approbation, and
the praefecture of Gaul. Two fierce and enormous bears, distinguished by
the appellations of Innocence, and Mica Aurea, could alone deserve to
share the favor of Maximin. The cages of those trusty guards were always
placed near the bed-chamber of Valentinian, who frequently amused his
eyes with the grateful spectacle of seeing them tear and devour the
bleeding limbs of the malefactors who were abandoned to their rage.
Their diet and exercises were carefully inspected by the Roman emperor;
and when Innocence had earned her discharge, by a long course of
meritorious service, the faithful animal was again restored to the
freedom of her native woods.  <span id="fr_1394"></span>[59](#fn_1393.md)

<span id="fn_1364"></span>[34](daf02049.htm#fr_1365.md) The uncertain
degree of alliance, or consanguinity, is expressed by the words,
cognatus, consobrinus, (see Valesius ad Ammian. xxiii. 3.) The mother of
Procopius might be a sister of Basilina and Count Julian, the mother and

xxvi. 6. He mentions the report with much hesitation: susurravit
obscurior fama; nemo enim dicti auctor exstitit verus. It serves,
however, to remark, that Procopius was a Pagan. Yet his religion does
not appear to have promoted, or obstructed, his pretensions.

<span id="fn_1366"></span>[36](daf02049.htm#fr_1367.md) One of his retreats
was a country-house of Eunomius, the heretic. The master was absent,
innocent, ignorant; yet he narrowly escaped a sentence of death, and was
banished into the remote parts of Mauritania, (Philostorg. l. ix. c. 5,
8, and Godefroy's Dissert. p. 369- 378.)

<span id="fn_1367"></span>[\*\_0074](daf02049.htm#fr_1368.md) It may be
suspected, from a fragment of Eunapius, that the heathen and philosophic
party espoused the cause of Procopius. Heraclius, the Cynic, a man who
had been honored by a philosophic controversy with Julian, striking the
ground with his staff, incited him to courage with the line of Homer

380) restored to the same extraordinary office of proconsul of Bithynia,
(Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 204) I am ignorant whether
the race of Sassan was propagated. I find (A. D. 514) a pope Hormisdas;
but he was a native of Frusino, in Italy, (Pagi Brev. Pontific. tom. i.
p. 247)

<span id="fn_1371"></span>[\*\_0075](daf02049.htm#fr_1372.md) Symmachus
describes his embarrassment. "The Germans are the common enemies of the
state, Procopius the private foe of the Emperor; his first care must be
victory, his second revenge." Symm. Orat. p. 11. - M.

<span id="fn_1372"></span>[40](daf02049.htm#fr_1373.md) Et dedignatus

strength and beauty of Arintheus, the new Hercules, are celebrated by
St. Basil, who supposed that God had created him as an inimitable model
of the human species. The painters and sculptors could not express his
figure: the historians appeared fabulous when they related his exploits,
(Ammian. xxvi. and Vales. ad loc.)

<span id="fn_1373"></span>[41](daf02049.htm#fr_1374.md) The same field of
battle is placed by Ammianus in Lycia, and by Zosimus at Thyatira, which
are at the distance of 150 miles from each other. But Thyatira alluitur
Lyco, (Plin. Hist. Natur. v. 31, Cellarius, Geograph. Antiq. tom. ii. p.
79;) and the transcribers might easily convert an obscure river into a
well-known province.

Note: Ammianus and Zosimus place the last battle at Nacolia in Phrygia;
Ammianus altogether omits the former battle near Thyatira. Procopius was
on his march (iter tendebat) towards Lycia. See Wagner's note, in c. -
M.

<span id="fn_1374"></span>[42](daf02049.htm#fr_1375.md) The adventures,
usurpation, and fall of Procopius, are related, in a regular series, by
Ammianus, (xxvi. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,) and Zosimus, (l. iv. p. 203-210.) They
often illustrate, and seldom contradict, each other. Themistius (Orat.
vii. p. 91, 92) adds some base panegyric; and Euna pius (p. 83, 84) some
malicious satire.

<span id="fn_1375"></span>[!\_0075](daf02049.htm#fr_1376.md) Symmachus
joins with Themistius in praising the clemency of Valens dic victoriae

<span id="fn_1376"></span>[!!\_0076](daf02049.htm#fr_1377.md) This infamous
inquisition into sorcery and witchcraft has been of greater influence on
human affairs than is commonly supposed. The persecutions against
philosophers and their libraries was carried on with so much fury, that
from this time (A. D. 374) the names of the Gentile philosophers became
almost extinct; and the Christian philosophy and religion, particularly
in the East, established their ascendency. I am surprised that Gibbon
has not made this observation. Heyne, Note on Zosimus, l. iv. 14, p.
637. Besides vast heaps of manuscripts publicly destroyed throughout the
East, men of letters burned their whole libraries, lest some fatal
volume should expose them to the malice of the informers and the extreme
penalty of the law. Amm. Marc. xxix. 11. - M.

ulciscend. Julian. nece, c. ix. p. 158, 159. The sophist deplores the
public frenzy, but he does not (after their deaths) impeach the justice
of the emperors.

<span id="fn_1378"></span>[44](daf02049.htm#fr_1379.md) The French and
English lawyers, of the present age, allow the theory, and deny the
practice, of witchcraft, (Denisart, Recueil de Decisions de
Jurisprudence, au mot Sorciers, tom. iv. p. 553. Blackstone's
Commentaries, vol. iv. p. 60.) As private reason always prevents, or
outstrips, public wisdom, the president Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, l.
xii. c. 5, 6) rejects the existence of magic.

<span id="fn_1379"></span>[45](daf02049.htm#fr_1380.md) See Oeuvres de
Bayle, tom. iii. p. 567-589. The sceptic of Rotterdam exhibits,
according to his custom, a strange medley of loose knowledge and lively
wit.

<span id="fn_1380"></span>[46](daf02049.htm#fr_1381.md) The Pagans
distinguished between good and bad magic, the Theurgic and the Goetic,
(Hist. de l'Academie, &c., tom. vii. p. 25.) But they could not have
defended this obscure distinction against the acute logic of Bayle. In
the Jewish and Christian system, all daemons are infernal spirits; and
all commerce with them is idolatry, apostasy &c., which deserves death
and damnation.

<span id="fn_1381"></span>[47](daf02049.htm#fr_1382.md) The Canidia of
Horace (Carm. l. v. Od. 5, with Dacier's and Sanadon's illustrations) is
a vulgar witch. The Erictho of Lucan (Pharsal. vi. 430-830) is tedious,
disgusting, but sometimes sublime. She chides the delay of the Furies,
and threatens, with tremendous obscurity, to pronounce their real names;
to reveal the true infernal countenance of Hecate; to invoke the secret
powers that lie below hell, &c.

<span id="fn_1382"></span>[48](daf02049.htm#fr_1383.md) Genus hominum

with Godefroy's Commentary.

<span id="fn_1383"></span>[49](daf02049.htm#fr_1384.md) The persecution of
Antioch was occasioned by a criminal consultation. The twenty-four
letters of the alphabet were arranged round a magic tripod: and a
dancing ring, which had been placed in the centre, pointed to the four
first letters in the name of the future emperor, O. E. O Triangle.
Theodorus (perhaps with many others, who owned the fatal syllables) was
executed. Theodosius succeeded. Lardner (Heathen Testimonies, vol. iv.
p. 353-372) has copiously and fairly examined this dark transaction of
the reign of Valens.

Such vain incantations could affect the mind, and increase the disease
of Germanicus. Tacit. Annal. ii. 69.

<span id="fn_1386"></span>[52](daf02049.htm#fr_1387.md) The cruel
persecution of Rome and Antioch is described, and most probably
exaggerated, by Ammianus (xxvii. 1. xxix. 1, 2) and Zosimus, (l. iv. p.
216-218.) The philosopher Maximus, with some justice, was involved in
the charge of magic, (Eunapius in Vit. Sophist. p. 88, 89;) and young
Chrysostom, who had accidentally found one of the proscribed books, gave
himself up for lost, (Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 340.)

<span id="fn_1387"></span>[53](daf02049.htm#fr_1388.md) Consult the six
last books of Ammianus, and more particularly the portraits of the two
royal brothers, (xxx. 8, 9, xxxi. 14.) Tillemont has collected (tom. v.
p. 12-18, p. 127-133) from all antiquity their virtues and vices.

<span id="fn_1388"></span>[54](daf02049.htm#fr_1389.md) The younger Victor
asserts, that he was valde timidus: yet he behaved, as almost every man
would do, with decent resolution at the head of an army. The same
historian attempts to prove that his anger was harmless. Ammianus
observes, with more candor and judgment, incidentia crimina ad
contemptam vel laesam principis amplitudinem trahens, in sanguinem
saeviebat.

<span id="fn_1389"></span>[55](daf02049.htm#fr_1390.md) Cum esset ad
acerbitatem naturae calore propensior. . . poenas perignes augebat et
gladios. Ammian. xxx. 8. See xxvii. 7

<span id="fn_1390"></span>[56](daf02049.htm#fr_1391.md) I have transferred
the reproach of avarice from Valens to his servant. Avarice more
properly belongs to ministers than to kings; in whom that passion is
commonly extinguished by absolute possession.

<span id="fn_1391"></span>[57](daf02049.htm#fr_1392.md) He sometimes
expressed a sentence of death with a tone of pleasantry: "Abi, Comes, et
muta ei caput, qui sibi mutari provinciam cupit." A boy, who had slipped
too hastily a Spartan bound; an armorer, who had made a polished cuirass
that wanted some grains of the legitimate weight, &c., were the victims
of his fury.

<span id="fn_1392"></span>[58](daf02049.htm#fr_1393.md) The innocents of
Milan were an agent and three apparitors, whom Valentinian condemned for
signifying a legal summons. Ammianus (xxvii. 7) strangely supposes, that
all who had been unjustly executed were worshipped as martyrs by the
Christians. His impartial silence does not allow us to believe, that the
great chamberlain Rhodanus was burnt alive for an act of oppression,
(Chron. Paschal. p. 392.)

Note: Ammianus does not say that they were worshipped as martyrs. Onorum
memoriam apud Mediolanum colentes nunc usque Christiani loculos ubi
sepulti sunt, ad innocentes appellant. Wagner's note in loco. Yet if the
next paragraph refers to that transaction, which is not quite clear.
Gibbon is right. - M.
