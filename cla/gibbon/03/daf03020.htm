Part IV.</h3> </p> 
<p>     Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank, who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only one senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_520"></A><A HREF="#fn_520"><FONT SIZE="1">108</FONT></A> But it was not easy to compute the multitudes, who, from an honorable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.  As the Barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A> The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market, or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose, or to alienate. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A> But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives; and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder, their useless prisoners; the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of five years, till they had discharged by their labor the price of their redemption. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">111</FONT></A> The nations who invaded the Roman empire, had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.  The calamities of Rome and Italy dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.  While the Gothic cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of Campania and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_524"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A> The ample patrimonies, which many senatorian families possessed in Africa, invited them, if they had time, and prudence, to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province. The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A> the widow of the praefect Petronius.  After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the Anician family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her three sons.  When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, Proba supported, with Christian resignation, the loss of immense riches; embarked in a small vessel, from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace, and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her granddaughter, the celebrated virgin, Demetrias, to the coast of Africa. The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits, or the price, of her estates, contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.  But even the family of Proba herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution, the noblest maidens of Rome to the lust or avarice of the Syrian merchants.  The Italian fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of Egypt and Asia, as far as Constantinople and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlem, the solitary residence of St. Jerom and his female converts, was crowded with illustrious beggars of either sex, and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A> This awful catastrophe of Rome filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.  So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin, disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.  The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of oriental prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.

       There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.  Yet, when the first emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess, that infant Rome had formerly received more essential injury from the Gauls, than she had now sustained from the Goths in her declining age. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_527"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A> The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the Barbarians, whom Alaric had led from the banks of the Danube, were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a Catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_528"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A> The Goths evacuated the city at the end of six days, but Rome remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.  The authority of Alaric preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of Bourbon had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of three independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.  In the beginning of the sixteenth century, the manners of Italy exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.  They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the Roman pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.  At the same aera, the Spaniards were the terror both of the Old and New World: but their high- spirited valor was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.  Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the Castilians, who pillaged Rome, were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico The Germans were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage, aspect of those Tramontane warriors, often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.  But they had imbibed, in the first fervor of the reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles of Luther.  It was their favorite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of Catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree, who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Anti-christ, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_529"></A><A HREF="#fn_529"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A>  
  
 </p> 
<p>
       The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated Rome on the sixth day, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_530"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A> might be the result of prudence; but it was not surely the effect of fear. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_531"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A> At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.  The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the eighth city of the empire, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_532"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A> is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A> has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_534"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A> who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.  At the age of forty, he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honor, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_535"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A> An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in one of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St. Faelix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with five large and populous churches.  The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, Paulinus never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a sixth church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures, from the history of the Old and New Testament.  Such assiduous zeal secured the favor of the saint, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_536"></A><A HREF="#fn_536"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A> or at least of the people; and, after fifteen years' retirement, the Roman consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.  During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron; yet it soon appeared by the event, that Faelix wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.  Nola was not saved from the general devastation; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_537"></A><A HREF="#fn_537"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A> and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.  Above four years elapsed from the successful invasion of Italy by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the Goths under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country, which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.  The prosperity, indeed, which Italy had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.  The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the Barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury, which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians. Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was daily collected and consumed in the Gothic camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by Lucullus and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania. Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of Roman senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of Falernian wine to the haughty victors; who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_538"></A><A HREF="#fn_538"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A> artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.  These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the Elbe and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the Italian climate. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_539"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A> </p>

<p>     Whether fame, or conquest, or riches, were the object or Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardor, which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.  No sooner had he reached the extreme land of Italy, than he was attracted by the neighboring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.  Yet even the possession of Sicily he considered only as an intermediate step to the important expedition, which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.  The Straits of Rhegium and Messina &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_540"></A><A HREF="#fn_540"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A> are twelve miles in length, and, in the narrowest passage, about one mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of Scylla, and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilful mariners.  Yet as soon as the first division of the Goths had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk, or scattered, many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.  The ferocious character of the Barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valor and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.  By the labor of a captive multitude, they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia. The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot, where the remains of Alaric had been deposited, was forever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners, who had been employed to execute the work. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_541"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>

But there is an air of rhetoric, and perhaps of falsehood, in this antithesis; and Socrates (l. vii. c. 10) affirms, perhaps by an opposite exaggeration, that many senators were put to death with various and exquisite tortures.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_525"></A><A HREF="daf03020.htm#fr_525">113</A> As the adventures of Proba and her family are connected with the life of St. Augustin, they are diligently illustrated by Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xiii. p. 620 - 635.  Some time after their arrival in Africa, Demetrias took the veil, and made a vow of virginity; an event which was considered as of the highest importance to Rome and to the world. All the Saints wrote congratulatory letters to her; that of Jerom is still extant, (tom. i. p. 62 - 73, ad Demetriad. de servand Virginitat.,) and contains a mixture of absurd reasoning, spirited declamation, and curious facts, some of which relate to the siege and sack of Rome.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_526"></A><A HREF="daf03020.htm#fr_526">114</A> See the pathetic complaint of Jerom, (tom. v. p. 400,) in his preface to the second book of his Commentaries on the Prophet Ezekiel.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_527"></A><A HREF="daf03020.htm#fr_527">115</A> Orosius, though with some theological partiality, states this comparison, l. ii. c. 19, p. 142, l. vii. c. 39, p. 575.  But, in the history of the taking of Rome by the Gauls, every thing is uncertain, and perhaps fabulous.  See Beaufort sur l'Incertitude, &c., de l'Histoire Romaine, p. 356; and Melot, in the Mem. de l'Academie des Inscript. tom. xv. p. 1 - 21.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_528"></A><A HREF="daf03020.htm#fr_528">116</A> The reader who wishes to inform himself of the circumstances of his famous event, may peruse an admirable narrative in Dr. Robertson's History of Charles V. vol. ii. p. 283; or consult the Annali d'Italia of the learned Muratori, tom. xiv. p. 230 - 244, octavo edition.  If he is desirous of examining the originals, he may have recourse to the eighteenth book of the great, but unfinished, history of Guicciardini.  But the account which most truly deserves the name of authentic and original, is a little book, entitled, Il Sacco di Roma, composed, within less than a month after the assault of the city, by the brother of the historian Guicciardini, who appears to have been an able magistrate and a dispassionate writer.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_529"></A><A HREF="daf03020.htm#fr_529">117</A> The furious spirit of Luther, the effect of temper and enthusiasm, has been forcibly attacked, (Bossuet, Hist. des Variations des Eglises Protestantes, livre i. p. 20 - 36,) and feebly defended, (Seckendorf. Comment. de Lutheranismo, especially l. i. No. 78, p. 120, and l. iii. No. 122, p. 556.)</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_534"></A><A HREF="daf03020.htm#fr_534">122</A> Tillemont (Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p. 1 - 46) has compiled, with his usual diligence, all that relates to the life and writings of Paulinus, whose retreat is celebrated by his own pen, and by the praises of St. Ambrose, St. Jerom, St. Augustin, Sulpicius Severus, &c., his Christian friends and contemporaries.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_535"></A><A HREF="daf03020.htm#fr_535">123</A> See the affectionate letters of Ausonius (epist. xix. - xxv. p. 650-698, edit. Toll.) to his colleague, his friend, and his disciple, Paulinus.  The religion of Ausonius is still a problem, (see Mem. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xv. p. 123 - 138.) I believe that it was such in his own time, and, consequently, that in his heart he was a Pagan.</P>
