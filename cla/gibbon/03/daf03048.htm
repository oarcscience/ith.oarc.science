<p>     In a century of perpetual, or at least implacable, war, much courage, and some skill, must have been exerted for the defence of Britain.  Yet if the memory of its champions is almost buried in oblivion, we need not repine; since every age, however destitute of science or virtue, sufficiently abounds with acts of blood and military renown.  The tomb of Vortimer, the son of Vortigern, was erected on the margin of the sea-shore, as a landmark formidable to the Saxons, whom he had thrice vanquished in the fields of Kent. Ambrosius Aurelian was descended from a noble family of Romans; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1345"></A><A HREF="#fn_1345"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A> his modesty was equal to his valor, and his valor, till the last fatal action, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1346"></A><A HREF="#fn_1346"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A> was crowned with splendid success.  But every British name is effaced by the illustrious name of Arthur, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1347"></A><A HREF="#fn_1347"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A> the hereditary prince of the Silures, in South Wales, and the elective king or general of the nation.  According to the most rational account, he defeated, in twelve successive battles, the Angles of the North, and the Saxons of the West; but the declining age of the hero was imbittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes.  The events of his life are less interesting than the singular revolutions of his fame. During a period of five hundred years the tradition of his exploits was preserved, and rudely embellished, by the obscure bards of Wales and Armorica, who were odious to the Saxons, and unknown to the rest of mankind.  The pride and curiosity of the Norman conquerors prompted them to inquire into the ancient history of Britain: they listened with fond credulity to the tale of Arthur, and eagerly applauded the merit of a prince who had triumphed over the Saxons, their common enemies.  His romance, transcribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of Monmouth, and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of the times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent, ornaments which were familiar to the experience, the learning, or the fancy, of the twelfth century.  The progress of a Phrygian colony, from the Tyber to the Thames, was easily ingrafted on the fable of the Aeneid; and the royal ancestors of Arthur derived their origin from Troy, and claimed their alliance with the Caesars. His trophies were decorated with captive provinces and Imperial titles; and his Danish victories avenged the recent injuries of his country.  The gallantry and superstition of the British hero, his feasts and tournaments, and the memorable institution of his Knights of the Round Table, were faithfully copied from the reigning manners of chivalry; and the fabulous exploits of Uther's son appear less incredible than the adventures which were achieved by the enterprising valor of the Normans.  Pilgrimage, and the holy wars, introduced into Europe the specious miracles of Arabian magic.  Fairies and giants, flying dragons, and enchanted palaces, were blended with the more simple fictions of the West; and the fate of Britain depended on the art, or the predictions, of Merlin.  Every nation embraced and adorned the popular romance of Arthur, and the Knights of the Round Table: their names were celebrated in Greece and Italy; and the voluminous tales of Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram were devoutly studied by the princes and nobles, who disregarded the genuine heroes and historians of antiquity.  At length the light of science and reason was rekindled; the talisman was broken; the visionary fabric melted into air; and by a natural, though unjust, reverse of the public opinion, the severity of the present age is inclined to question the existence of Arthur. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1348"></A><A HREF="#fn_1348"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A>

       Resistance, if it cannot avert, must increase the miseries of conquest; and conquest has never appeared more dreadful and destructive than in the hands of the Saxons; who hated the valor of their enemies, disdained the faith of treaties, and violated, without remorse, the most sacred objects of the Christian worship.  The fields of battle might be traced, almost in every district, by monuments of bones; the fragments of falling towers were stained with blood; the last of the Britons, without distinction of age or sex, was massacred, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1349"></A><A HREF="#fn_1349"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A> in the ruins of Anderida; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1350"></A><A HREF="#fn_1350"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A> and the repetition of such calamities was frequent and familiar under the Saxon heptarchy.  The arts and religion, the laws and language, which the Romans had so carefully planted in Britain, were extirpated by their barbarous successors.  After the destruction of the principal churches, the bishops, who had declined the crown of martyrdom, retired with the holy relics into Wales and Armorica; the remains of their flocks were left destitute of any spiritual food; the practice, and even the remembrance, of Christianity were abolished; and the British clergy might obtain some comfort from the damnation of the idolatrous strangers.  The kings of France maintained the privileges of their Roman subjects; but the ferocious Saxons trampled on the laws of Rome, and of the emperors.  The proceedings of civil and criminal jurisdiction, the titles of honor, the forms of office, the ranks of society, and even the domestic rights of marriage, testament, and inheritance, were finally suppressed; and the indiscriminate crowd of noble and plebeian slaves was governed by the traditionary customs, which had been coarsely framed for the shepherds and pirates of Germany.  The language of science, of business, and of conversation, which had been introduced by the Romans, was lost in the general desolation.  A sufficient number of Latin or Celtic words might be assumed by the Germans, to express their new wants and ideas; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1351"></A><A HREF="#fn_1351"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A> but those illiterate Pagans preserved and established the use of their national dialect. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1352"></A><A HREF="#fn_1352"><FONT SIZE="1">145</FONT></A> Almost every name, conspicuous either in the church or state, reveals its Teutonic origin; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1353"></A><A HREF="#fn_1353"><FONT SIZE="1">146</FONT></A> and the geography of England was universally inscribed with foreign characters and appellations.  The example of a revolution, so rapid and so complete, may not easily be found; but it will excite a probable suspicion, that the arts of Rome were less deeply rooted in Britain than in Gaul or Spain; and that the native rudeness of the country and its inhabitants was covered by a thin varnish of Italian manners.

       This strange alteration has persuaded historians, and even philosophers, that the provincials of Britain were totally exterminated; and that the vacant land was again peopled by the perpetual influx, and rapid increase, of the German colonies.  Three hundred thousand Saxons are said to have obeyed the summons of Hengist; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1354"></A><A HREF="#fn_1354"><FONT SIZE="1">147</FONT></A> the entire emigation of the Angles was attested, in the age of Bede, by the solitude of their native country; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1355"></A><A HREF="#fn_1355"><FONT SIZE="1">148</FONT></A> and our experience has shown the free propagation of the human race, if they are cast on a fruitful wilderness, where their steps are unconfined, and their subsistence is plentiful.  The Saxon kingdoms displayed the face of recent discovery and cultivation; the towns were small, the villages were distant; the husbandry was languid and unskilful; four sheep were equivalent to an acre of the best land; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1356"></A><A HREF="#fn_1356"><FONT SIZE="1">149</FONT></A> an ample space of wood and morass was resigned to the vague dominion of nature; and the modern bishopric of Durham, the whole territory from the Tyne to the Tees, had returned to its primitive state of a savage and solitary forest. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1357"></A><A HREF="#fn_1357"><FONT SIZE="1">150</FONT></A> Such imperfect population might have been supplied, in some generations, by the English colonies; but neither reason nor facts can justify the unnatural supposition, that the Saxons of Britain remained alone in the desert which they had subdued.  After the sanguinary Barbarians had secured their dominion, and gratified their revenge, it was their interest to preserve the peasants as well as the cattle, of the unresisting country.  In each successive revolution, the patient herd becomes the property of its new masters; and the salutary compact of food and labor is silently ratified by their mutual necessities.  Wilfrid, the apostle of Sussex, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1358"></A><A HREF="#fn_1358"><FONT SIZE="1">151</FONT></A> accepted from his royal convert the gift of the Vpeninsula of Selsey, near Chichester, with the persons and property of its inhabitants, who then amounted to eighty-seven families.  He released them at once from spiritual and temporal bondage; and two hundred and fifty slaves of both sexes were baptized by their indulgent master.  The kingdom of Sussex, which spread from the sea to the Thames, contained seven thousand families; twelve hundred were ascribed to the Isle of Wight; and, if we multiply this vague computation, it may seem probable, that England was cultivated by a million of servants, or villains, who were attached to the estates of their arbitrary landlords.  The indigent Barbarians were often tempted to sell their children, or themselves into perpetual, and even foreign, bondage; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1359"></A><A HREF="#fn_1359"><FONT SIZE="1">152</FONT></A> yet the special exemptions which were granted to national slaves, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1360"></A><A HREF="#fn_1360"><FONT SIZE="1">153</FONT></A> sufficiently declare that they were much less numerous than the strangers and captives, who had lost their liberty, or changed their masters, by the accidents of war.  When time and religion had mitigated the fierce spirit of the Anglo-Saxons, the laws encouraged the frequent practice of manumission; and their subjects, of Welsh or Cambrian extraction, assumed the respectable station of inferior freemen, possessed of lands, and entitled to the rights of civil society. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1361"></A><A HREF="#fn_1361"><FONT SIZE="1">154</FONT></A> Such gentle treatment might secure the allegiance of a fierce people, who had been recently subdued on the confines of Wales and Cornwall.  The sage Ina, the legislator of Wessex, united the two nations in the bands of domestic alliance; and four British lords of Somersetshire may be honorably distinguished in the court of a Saxon monarch. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1362"></A><A HREF="#fn_1362"><FONT SIZE="1">155</FONT></A> </p>

       The independent Britons appear to have relapsed into the state of original barbarism, from whence they had been imperfectly reclaimed. Separated by their enemies from the rest of mankind, they soon became an object of scandal and abhorrence to the Catholic world. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1363"></A><A HREF="#fn_1363"><FONT SIZE="1">156</FONT></A> Christianity was still professed in the mountains of Wales; but the rude schismatics, in the form of the clerical tonsure, and in the day of the celebration of Easter, obstinately resisted the imperious mandates of the Roman pontiffs. The use of the Latin language was insensibly abolished, and the Britons were deprived of the art and learning which Italy communicated to her Saxon proselytes.  In Wales and Armorica, the Celtic tongue, the native idiom of the West, was preserved and propagated; and the Bards, who had been the companions of the Druids, were still protected, in the sixteenth century, by the laws of Elizabeth.  Their chief, a respectable officer of the courts of Pengwern, or Aberfraw, or Caermarthen, accompanied the king's servants to war: the monarchy of the Britons, which he sung in the front of battle, excited their courage, and justified their depredations; and the songster claimed for his legitimate prize the fairest heifer of the spoil.  His subordinate ministers, the masters and disciples of vocal and instrumental music, visited, in their respective circuits, the royal, the noble, and the plebeian houses; and the public poverty, almost exhausted by the clergy, was oppressed by the importunate demands of the bards.  Their rank and merit were ascertained by solemn trials, and the strong belief of supernatural inspiration exalted the fancy of the poet, and of his audience. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1364"></A><A HREF="#fn_1364"><FONT SIZE="1">157</FONT></A> The last retreats of Celtic freedom, the extreme territories of Gaul and Britain, were less adapted to agriculture than to pasturage: the wealth of the Britons consisted in their flocks and herds; milk and flesh were their ordinary food; and bread was sometimes esteemed, or rejected, as a foreign luxury.  Liberty had peopled the mountains of Wales and the morasses of Armorica; but their populousness has been maliciously ascribed to the loose practice of polygamy; and the houses of these licentious barbarians have been supposed to contain ten wives, and perhaps fifty children. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1365"></A><A HREF="#fn_1365"><FONT SIZE="1">158</FONT></A> Their disposition was rash and choleric; they were bold in action and in speech; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1366"></A><A HREF="#fn_1366"><FONT SIZE="1">159</FONT></A> and as they were ignorant of the arts of peace, they alternately indulged their passions in foreign and domestic war.  The cavalry of Armorica, the spearmen of Gwent, and the archers of Merioneth, were equally formidable; but their poverty could seldom procure either shields or helmets; and the inconvenient weight would have retarded the speed and agility of their desultory operations.  One of the greatest of the English monarchs was requested to satisfy the curiosity of a Greek emperor concerning the state of Britain; and Henry II. could assert, from his personal experience, that Wales was inhabited by a race of naked warriors, who encountered, without fear, the defensive armor of their enemies. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1367"></A><A HREF="#fn_1367"><FONT SIZE="1">160</FONT></A> </p>

<p>     By the revolution of Britain, the limits of science, as well as of empire, were contracted.  The dark cloud, which had been cleared by the Phoenician discoveries, and finally dispelled by the arms of Caesar, again settled on the shores of the Atlantic, and a Roman province was again lost among the fabulous Islands of the Ocean.  One hundred and fifty years after the reign of Honorius, the gravest historian of the times &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1368"></A><A HREF="#fn_1368"><FONT SIZE="1">161</FONT></A> describes the wonders of a remote isle, whose eastern and western parts are divided by an antique wall, the boundary of life and death, or, more properly, of truth and fiction.  The east is a fair country, inhabited by a civilized people: the air is healthy, the waters are pure and plentiful, and the earth yields her regular and fruitful increase.  In the west, beyond the wall, the air is infectious and mortal; the ground is covered with serpents; and this dreary solitude is the region of departed spirits, who are transported from the opposite shores in substantial boats, and by living rowers.  Some families of fishermen, the subjects of the Franks, are excused from tribute, in consideration of the mysterious office which is performed by these Charons of the ocean.  Each in his turn is summoned, at the hour of midnight, to hear the voices, and even the names, of the ghosts: he is sensible of their weight, and he feels himself impelled by an unknown, but irresistible power.  After this dream of fancy, we read with astonishment, that the name of this island is Brittia; that it lies in the ocean, against the mouth of the Rhine, and less than thirty miles from the continent; that it is possessed by three nations, the Frisians, the Angles, and the Britons; and that some Angles had appeared at Constantinople, in the train of the French ambassadors.  From these ambassadors Procopius might be informed of a singular, though not improbable, adventure, which announces the spirit, rather than the delicacy, of an English heroine.  She had been betrothed to Radiger, king of the Varni, a tribe of Germans who touched the ocean and the Rhine; but the perfidious lover was tempted, by motives of policy, to prefer his father's widow, the sister of Theodebert, king of the Franks. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1369"></A><A HREF="#fn_1369"><FONT SIZE="1">162</FONT></A> The forsaken princess of the Angles, instead of bewailing, revenged her disgrace.  Her warlike subjects are said to have been ignorant of the use, and even of the form, of a horse; but she boldly sailed from Britain to the mouth of the Rhine, with a fleet of four hundred ships, and an army of one hundred thousand men.  After the loss of a battle, the captive Radiger implored the mercy of his victorious bride, who generously pardoned his offence, dismissed her rival, and compelled the king of the Varni to discharge with honor and fidelity the duties of a husband. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1370"></A><A HREF="#fn_1370"><FONT SIZE="1">163</FONT></A> This gallant exploit appears to be the last naval enterprise of the Anglo-Saxons.  The arts of navigation, by which they acquired the empire of Britain and of the sea, were soon neglected by the indolent Barbarians, who supinely renounced all the commercial advantages of their insular situation. Seven independent kingdoms were agitated by perpetual discord; and the British world was seldom connected, either in peace or war, with the nations of the Continent. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1371"></A><A HREF="#fn_1371"><FONT SIZE="1">164</FONT></A>

<p>     I have now accomplished the laborious narrative of the decline and fall of the Roman empire, from the fortunate age of Trajan and the Antonines, to its total extinction in the West, about five centuries after the Christian era.  At that unhappy period, the Saxons fiercely struggled with the natives for the possession of Britain: Gaul and Spain were divided between the powerful monarchies of the Franks and Visigoths, and the dependent kingdoms of the Suevi and Burgundians: Africa was exposed to the cruel persecution of the Vandals, and the savage insults of the Moors: Rome and Italy, as far as the banks of the Danube, were afflicted by an army of Barbarian mercenaries, whose lawless tyranny was succeeded by the reign of Theodoric the Ostrogoth.  All the subjects of the empire, who, by the use of the Latin language, more particularly deserved the name and privileges of Romans, were oppressed by the disgrace and calamities of foreign conquest; and the victorious nations of Germany established a new system of manners and government in the western countries of Europe.  The majesty of Rome was faintly represented by the princes of Constantinople, the feeble and imaginary successors of Augustus. Yet they continued to reign over the East, from the Danube to the Nile and Tigris; the Gothic and Vandal kingdoms of Italy and Africa were subverted by the arms of Justinian; and the history of the Greek emperors may still afford a long series of instructive lessons, and interesting revolutions.  </p>

The expression of Nennius (c. 44, p. 110, edit. Gale) is still more singular, "Unus de consulibus gentis Romanicae est pater meus."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1346"></A><A HREF="daf03048.htm#fr_1346">139</A> By the unanimous, though doubtful, conjecture of our antiquarians, Ambrosius is confounded with Natanleod, who (A.D. 508) lost his own life, and five thousand of his subjects, in a battle against Cerdic, the West Saxon, (Chron.

(Hist. Brit. c. 62, 63, p. 114.) Mr. Whitaker, (Hist. of Manchester, vol. ii. p. 31 - 71) had framed an interesting, and even probable, narrative of the wars of Arthur: though it is impossible to allow the reality of the round table. </p> 
<p>     Note: I presume that Gibbon means Llywarch Hen, or the Aged. - The Elegies of this Welsh prince and bard have been published by Mr. Owen; to whose works and in the Myvyrian Archaeology, slumbers much curious information on the subject of Welsh tradition and poetry.  But the Welsh antiquarians have never obtained a hearing from the public; they have had no Macpherson to compensate for his corruption of their poetic legends by forcing them into popularity. - See also Mr. Sharon Turner's Essay on the Welsh Bards. - M.</P>

I have derived much instruction from the two learned dissertations prefixed to the first volume of his History of English Poetry. </p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1351"></A><A HREF="daf03048.htm#fr_1351">144</A> Dr. Johnson affirms, that few English words are of British extraction.  Mr. Whitaker, who understands the British language, has discovered more than three thousand, and actually produces a long and various catalogue, (vol. ii. p. 235 - 329.) It is possible, indeed, that many of these words may have been imported from the Latin or Saxon into the native idiom of Britain. </p> 
<p>     Note: Dr. Prichard's very curious researches, which connect the Celtic, as well as the Teutonic languages with the Indo-European class, make it still more difficult to decide between the Celtic or Teutonic origin of English words. - See Prichard on the Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations Oxford, 1831. - M.</P>

This reproach of William of Poitiers (in the Historians of France, tom. xi. p. 88) is disclaimed by the Benedictine editors.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1366"></A><A HREF="daf03048.htm#fr_1366">159</A> Giraldus Cambrensis confines this gift of bold and ready eloquence to the Romans, the French, and the Britons.  The malicious Welshman insinuates that the English taciturnity might possibly be the effect of their servitude under the Normans.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1367"></A><A HREF="daf03048.htm#fr_1367">160</A> The picture of Welsh and Armorican manners is drawn from Giraldus, (Descript. Cambriae, c. 6 - 15, inter Script. Camden. p. 886 - 891,) and the authors quoted by the Abbe de Vertot, (Hist. Critique tom. ii. p. 259 - 266.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1368"></A><A HREF="daf03048.htm#fr_1368">161</A> See Procopius de Bell. Gothic. l. iv. c. 20, p. 620 - 625. The Greek historian is himself so confounded by the wonders which he relates, that he weakly attempts to distinguish the islands of Britia and Britain, which he has identified by so many inseparable circumstances.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1369"></A><A HREF="daf03048.htm#fr_1369">162</A> Theodebert, grandson of Clovis, and king of Austrasia, was the most powerful and warlike prince of the age; and this remarkable adventure may be placed between the years 534 and 547, the extreme terms of his reign.  His sister Theudechildis retired to Sens, where she founded monasteries, and distributed alms, (see the notes of the Benedictine editors, in tom. ii. p. 216.) If we may credit the praises of Fortunatus, (l. vi. carm. 5, in tom. ii. p. 507,) Radiger was deprived of a most valuable wife.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1370"></A><A HREF="daf03048.htm#fr_1370">163</A> Perhaps she was the sister of one of the princes or chiefs of the Angles, who landed in 527, and the following years, between the Humber and the Thames, and gradually founded the kingdoms of East Anglia and Mercia.  The English writers are ignorant of her name and existence: but Procopius may have suggested to Mr. Rowe the character and situation of Rodogune in the tragedy of the Royal Convert.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1371"></A><A HREF="daf03048.htm#fr_1371">164</A> In the copious history of Gregory of Tours, we cannot find any traces of hostile or friendly intercourse between France and England except in the marriage of the daughter of Caribert, king of Paris, quam regis cujusdam in Cantia filius matrimonio copulavit, (l. ix. c. 28, in tom. ii. p. 348.) The bishop of Tours ended his history and his life almost immediately before the conversion of Kent.</P>
