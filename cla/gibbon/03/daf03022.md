### Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians. Part VI.

The situation of Spain, separated, on all sides, from the enemies of
Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had
secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country;
and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a
period of four hundred years, Spain furnished very few materials to the
history of the Roman empire. The footsteps of the Barbarians, who, in
the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon
obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the
Christian aera, the cities of Emerita, or Merida, of Corduba, Seville,
Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the
Roman world. The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the
mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an
industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores
contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.  <span
id="fr_567"></span>[155](#fn_567.md) The arts and sciences flourished under
the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the Spaniards
was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the
Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the Rhine to the
Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardor. As long as
the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful
militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts
of the Barbarians. But no sooner had the national troops been compelled
to resign their post to the Honorian bands, in the service of
Constantine, than the gates of Spain were treacherously betrayed to the
public enemy, about ten months before the sack of Rome by the Goths.
 <span id="fr_568"></span>[156](#fn_568.md) The consciousness of guilt, and
the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the Pyrenees to
desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and
the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible
violence from the frontiers of Gaul to the sea of Africa. The
misfortunes of Spain may be described in the language of its most
eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and
perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.  <span
id="fr_569"></span>[157](#fn_569.md) "The irruption of these nations was
followed by the most dreadful calamities; as the Barbarians exercised
their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the Romans and the
Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the
flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who
multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated, by the
taste of blood, and the impatience of hunger, boldly to attack and
devour their human prey. Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable
companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away;
and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving
friends. At length the Barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and
afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced,
fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country. The ancient
Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided
between the Suevi and the Vandals; the Alani were scattered over the
provinces of Carthagena and Lusitania, from the Mediterranean to the
Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of Boetica was allotted to
the Silingi, another branch of the Vandalic nation. After regulating
this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some
reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again
cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive
people. The greatest part of the Spaniards was even disposed to prefer
this new condition of poverty and barbarism, to the severe oppressions
of the Roman government; yet there were many who still asserted their
native freedom; and who refused, more especially in the mountains of
Gallicia, to submit to the Barbarian yoke."  <span
id="fr_570"></span>[158](#fn_570.md)

The important present of the heads of Jovinus and Sebastian had approved
the friendship of Adolphus, and restored Gaul to the obedience of his
brother Honorius. Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper
of the king of the Goths. He readily accepted the proposal of turning
his victorious arms against the Barbarians of Spain; the troops of
Constantius intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and
gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:  <span
id="fr_571"></span>[159](#fn_571.md) he passed the mountains, and
surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona. The
fondness of Adolphus for his Roman bride, was not abated by time or
possession: and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious
grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him forever in the interest of
the republic. The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a
silver coffin in one of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his
parents; but the grief of the Gothic king was suspended by the labors of
the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by
domestic treason. He had imprudently received into his service one of
the followers of Sarus; a Barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a
diminutive stature; whose secret desire of revenging the death of his
beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent
master. Adolphus was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws
of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;  <span
id="fr_572"></span>[160](#fn_572.md) and a stranger to the royal race,
Singeric, the brother of Sarus himself, was seated on the Gothic throne.
The first act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the six children of
Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity,
from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.  <span
id="fr_573"></span>[161](#fn_573.md) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of
the respectful compassion, which she might have excited in the most
savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult. The daughter
of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives,
was compelled to march on foot above twelve miles, before the horse of a
Barbarian, the assassin of a husband whom Placidia loved and lamented.
 <span id="fr_574"></span>[162](#fn_574.md)

But Placidia soon obtained the pleasure of revenge, and the view of her
ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the
tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation. After
the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the Gothic
sceptre on Wallia; whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the
beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic. He marched in
arms from Barcelona to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the
ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world. But when he
reached the southern promontory of Spain,  <span
id="fr_575"></span>[163](#fn_575.md) and, from the rock now covered by the
fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighboring and fertile coast of
Africa, Wallia resumed the designs of conquest, which had been
interrupted by the death of Alaric. The winds and waves again
disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a
superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of
storms and shipwrecks. In this disposition the successor of Adolphus no
longer refused to listen to a Roman ambassador, whose proposals were
enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under
the conduct of the brave Constantius. A solemn treaty was stipulated and
observed; Placidia was honorably restored to her brother; six hundred
thousand measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;  <span
id="fr_576"></span>[164](#fn_576.md) and Wallia engaged to draw his sword
in the service of the empire. A bloody war was instantly excited among
the Barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have
addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the
throne of the Western emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil
spectator of their contest; the events of which must be favorable to the
Romans, by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.  <span
id="fr_577"></span>[165](#fn_577.md) The Spanish war was obstinately
supported, during three campaigns, with desperate valor, and various
success; and the martial achievements of Wallia diffused through the
empire the superior renown of the Gothic hero. He exterminated the
Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province
of Boetica. He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains
of those Scythian wanderers, who escaped from the field, instead of
choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the
Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded. The Vandals
themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible
Goths. The promiscuous multitude of Barbarians, whose retreat had been
intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they
still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise
their domestic and implacable hostilities. In the pride of victory,
Wallia was faithful to his engagements: he restored his Spanish
conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the Imperial
officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their
Barbarian servitude. While the event of the war was still doubtful, the
first advantages obtained by the arms of Wallia had encouraged the court
of Ravenna to decree the honors of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
He entered Rome like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the
monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate
which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and
orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom,
and the invincible courage, of the emperor Honorius.  <span
id="fr_578"></span>[166](#fn_578.md)

Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if
Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the
Spanish war. His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had
passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties,
in the possession of the second Aquitain; a maritime province between
the Garonne and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical
jurisdiction of Bourdeaux. That metropolis, advantageously situated for
the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its
numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the Gauls by their wealth,
their learning, and the politeness of their manners. The adjacent
province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is
blessed with a fruitful soil, and a temperate climate; the face of the
country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths,
after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of
Aquitain.  <span id="fr_579"></span>[167](#fn_579.md) The Gothic limits
were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighboring dioceses; and
the successors of Alaric fixed their royal residence at Thoulouse, which
included five populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit
of its walls. About the same time, in the last years of the reign of
Honorius, the Goths, the Burgundians, and the Franks, obtained a
permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul. The liberal grant
of the usurper Jovinus to his Burgundian allies, was confirmed by the
lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, Germany, were ceded to
those formidable Barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by
conquest or treaty, the two provinces which still retain, with the
titles of Duchy and County, the national appellation of Burgundy.  <span
id="fr_580"></span>[168](#fn_580.md) The Franks, the valiant and faithful
allies of the Roman republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders,
whom they had so bravely resisted. Treves, the capital of Gaul, was
pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony, which they so
long maintained in the district of Toxandia, in Brabant, insensibly
multiplied along the banks of the Meuse and Scheld, till their
independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower
Germany. These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence;
but the foundation of the French monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests,
the laws, and even the existence, of that hero, have been justly
arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.  <span
id="fr_581"></span>[169](#fn_581.md)

The ruin of the opulent provinces of Gaul may be dated from the
establishment of these Barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and
oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion,
to violate the public peace. A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on
the surviving provincials, who had escaped the calamities of war; the
fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers,
for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the
trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their
fathers. Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a
vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the Romans themselves,
not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of
civil discord. The Triumvirs proscribed eighteen of the most flourishing
colonies of Italy; and distributed their lands and houses to the
veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of
their country. Two poets of unequal fame have deplored, in similar
circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of
Augustus appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the
Barbarians who invaded Gaul under the reign of Honorius. It was not
without the utmost difficulty that Virgil escaped from the sword of the
Centurion, who had usurped his farm in the neighborhood of Mantua;
 <span id="fr_582"></span>[170](#fn_582.md) but Paulinus of Bourdeaux
received a sum of money from his Gothic purchaser, which he accepted
with pleasure and surprise; and though it was much inferior to the real
value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colors of
moderation and equity.  <span id="fr_583"></span>[171](#fn_583.md) The
odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly
appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the Barbarians of Gaul,
more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared, that they were bound to
the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of
allegiance and military service. The title of Honorius and his
successors, their laws, and their civil magistrates, were still
respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the
possession to the Barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a
supreme and independent authority over their native subjects,
ambitiously solicited the more honorable rank of master-generals of the
Imperial armies.  <span id="fr_584"></span>[172](#fn_584.md) Such was the
involuntary reverence which the Roman name still impressed on the minds
of those warriors, who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the
Capitol.

Whilst Italy was ravaged by the Goths, and a succession of feeble
tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the British island
separated itself from the body of the Roman empire. The regular forces,
which guarded that remote province, had been gradually withdrawn; and
Britain was abandoned without defence to the Saxon pirates, and the
savages of Ireland and Caledonia. The Britons, reduced to this
extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining
monarchy. They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in
the important discovery of their own strength.  <span
id="fr_585"></span>[173](#fn_585.md) Afflicted by similar calamities, and
actuated by the same spirit, the Armorican provinces (a name which
comprehended the maritime countries of Gaul between the Seine and the
Loire  <span id="fr_586"></span>[174](#fn_586.md) resolved to imitate the
example of the neighboring island. They expelled the Roman magistrates,
who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free
government was established among a people who had so long been subject
to the arbitrary will of a master. The independence of Britain and
Armorica was soon confirmed by Honorius himself, the lawful emperor of
the West; and the letters, by which he committed to the new states the
care of their own safety, might be interpreted as an absolute and
perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty. This
interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event. After the
usurpers of Gaul had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were
restored to the empire. Yet their obedience was imperfect and
precarious: the vain, inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people,
was incompatible either with freedom or servitude;  <span
id="fr_587"></span>[175](#fn_587.md) and Armorica, though it could not long
maintain the form of a republic,  <span
id="fr_588"></span>[176](#fn_588.md) was agitated by frequent and
destructive revolts. Britain was irrecoverably lost.  <span
id="fr_589"></span>[177](#fn_589.md) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced
in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not
imbittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of
allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary
offices of national friendship.  <span id="fr_590"></span>[178](#fn_590.md)

This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military
government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years,
till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the
clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.  <span
id="fr_591"></span>[179](#fn_591.md) I. Zosimus, who alone has preserved
the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes, that
the letters of Honorius were addressed to the cities of Britain.  <span
id="fr_592"></span>[180](#fn_592.md) Under the protection of the Romans,
ninety-two considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that
great province; and, among these, thirty-three cities were distinguished
above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.  <span
id="fr_593"></span>[181](#fn_593.md) Each of these cities, as in all the
other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the
purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal
government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate,
and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the
Roman constitution.  <span id="fr_594"></span>[182](#fn_594.md) The
management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal
jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were
inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their
independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts,
would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burdens,
of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of
discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed, that the restoration of
British freedom was exempt from tumult and faction. The preeminence of
birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular
citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become
the subjects of their own servants,  <span
id="fr_595"></span>[183](#fn_595.md) would sometimes regret the reign of an
arbitrary monarch. II. The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent
country, was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal
senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of
land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these
rising republics. The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the
respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary
lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighborhood
of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and
boldly exercised the rights of peace and war. The gardens and villas,
which exhibited some faint imitation of Italian elegance, would soon be
converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the
adjacent country:  <span id="fr_596"></span>[184](#fn_596.md) the produce
of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a
military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers; and
the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil
magistrate. Several of these British chiefs might be the genuine
posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this
honorable genealogy, and to vindicate their hereditary claims, which had
been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.  <span
id="fr_597"></span>[185](#fn_597.md) Their situation and their hopes would
dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their
ancestors. If the princes of Britain relapsed into barbarism, while the
cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole
island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of two
national parties; again broken into a thousand subdivisions of war and
faction, by the various provocations of interest and resentment. The
public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was
consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which
had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals, might enable
him to subdue the freedom of some neighboring cities; and to claim a
rank among the tyrants,  <span id="fr_598"></span>[186](#fn_598.md) who
infested Britain after the dissolution of the Roman government. III. The
British church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops,  <span
id="fr_599"></span>[187](#fn_599.md) with an adequate proportion of the
inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor
 <span id="fr_600"></span>[188](#fn_600.md) would compel them to deserve
the public esteem, by a decent and exemplary behavior. The interest, as
well as the temper of the clergy, was favorable to the peace and union
of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently
inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were
the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a
national assembly. In such councils, where the princes and magistrates
sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state,
as well as of the church, might be freely debated; differences
reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions
often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe,
that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was
elected by the general consent of the Britons. These pastoral cares, so
worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal
and superstition; and the British clergy incessantly labored to
eradicate the Pelagian heresy, which they abhorred, as the peculiar
disgrace of their native country.  <span
id="fr_601"></span>[189](#fn_601.md)

It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the
revolt of Britain and Armorica should have introduced an appearance of
liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul. In a solemn edict,  <span
id="fr_602"></span>[190](#fn_602.md) filled with the strongest assurances
of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom
feel, the emperor Honorius promulgated his intention of convening an
annual assembly of the seven provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated
to Aquitain and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged
their Celtic rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.  <span
id="fr_603"></span>[191](#fn_603.md) Arles, the seat of government and
commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly; which regularly
continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the
thirteenth of September, of every year. It consisted of the Praetorian
praefect of the Gauls; of seven provincial governors, one consular, and
six presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about
sixty cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most
honorable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered
as the representatives of their country. They were empowered to
interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the
grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive
or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local
or national importance, that could tend to the restoration of the peace
and prosperity of the seven provinces. If such an institution, which
gave the people an interest in their own government, had been
universally established by Trajan or the Antonines, the seeds of public
wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire
of Rome. The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of
the monarch; the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been
prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these
representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended
against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen. Under the
mild and generous influence of liberty, the Roman empire might have
remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the
instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance,
its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their
vigor and independence. But in the decline of the empire, when every
principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application
of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or
salutary effects. The emperor Honorius expresses his surprise, that he
must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they
should ardently have solicited. A fine of three, or even five, pounds of
gold, was imposed on the absent representatives; who seem to have
declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and
most cruel insult of their oppressors.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_567"></span>[155](daf03022.htm#fr_567.md) Without recurring to
the more ancient writers, I shall quote three respectable testimonies
which belong to the fourth and seventh centuries; the Expositio totius
Mundi, (p. 16, in the third volume of Hudson's Minor Geographers,)
Ausonius, (de Claris Urbibus, p. 242, edit. Toll.,) and Isidore of
Seville, (Praefat. ad. Chron. ap. Grotium, Hist. Goth. 707.) Many
particulars relative to the fertility and trade of Spain may be found in
Nonnius, Hispania Illustrata; and in Huet, Hist. du Commerce des
Anciens, c. 40. p. 228 - 234.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[156](daf03022.htm#fr_568.md) The date is
accurately fixed in the Fasti, and the Chronicle of Idatius. Orosius (l.
vii. c. 40, p. 578) imputes the loss of Spain to the treachery of the
Honorians; while Sozomen (l. ix. c. 12) accuses only their negligence.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[157](daf03022.htm#fr_569.md) Idatius wishes to
apply the prophecies of Daniel to these national calamities; and is
therefore obliged to accommodate the circumstances of the event to the
terms of the prediction.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[158](daf03022.htm#fr_570.md) Mariana de Rebus
Hispanicis, l. v. c. 1, tom. i. p. 148. Comit. 1733. He had read, in
Orosius, (l. vii. c. 41, p. 579,) that the Barbarians had turned their
swords into ploughshares; and that many of the Provincials had preferred
inter Barbaros pauperem libertatem, quam inter Romanos tributariam
solicitudinem, sustinere.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[159](daf03022.htm#fr_571.md) This mixture of
force and persuasion may be fairly inferred from comparing Orosius and
Jornandes, the Roman and the Gothic historian.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[160](daf03022.htm#fr_572.md) According to the
system of Jornandes, (c. 33, p. 659,) the true hereditary right to the
Gothic sceptre was vested in the Amali; but those princes, who were the
vassals of the Huns, commanded the tribes of the Ostrogoths in some
distant parts of Germany or Scythia.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[161](daf03022.htm#fr_573.md) The murder is
related by Olympiodorus: but the number of the children is taken from an
epitaph of suspected authority.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[162](daf03022.htm#fr_574.md) The death of
Adolphus was celebrated at Constantinople with illuminations and
Circensian games. (See Chron. Alexandrin.) It may seem doubtful whether
the Greeks were actuated, on this occasion, be their hatred of the
Barbarians, or of the Latins.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[163](daf03022.htm#fr_575.md) Quod Tartessiacis
avus hujus Vallia terris Vandalicas turmas, et juncti Martis Alanos
Stravit, et occiduam texere cadavera Calpen.

Sidon. Apollinar. in Panegyr. Anthem. 363 p. 300, edit. Sirmond.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[164](daf03022.htm#fr_576.md) This supply was very
acceptable: the Goths were insulted by the Vandals of Spain with the
epithet of Truli, because in their extreme distress, they had given a
piece of gold for a trula, or about half a pound of flour. Olympiod.
apud Phot. p. 189.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[165](daf03022.htm#fr_577.md) Orosius inserts a
copy of these pretended letters. Tu cum omnibus pacem habe, omniumque
obsides accipe; nos nobis confligimus nobis perimus, tibi vincimus;
immortalis vero quaestus erit Reipublicae tuae, si utrique pereamus. The
idea is just; but I cannot persuade myself that it was entertained or
expressed by the Barbarians.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[166](daf03022.htm#fr_578.md) Roman triumphans
ingreditur, is the formal expression of Prosper's Chronicle. The facts
which relate to the death of Adolphus, and the exploits of Wallia, are
related from Olympiodorus, (ap. Phot. p. 188,) Orosius, (l. vii. c. 43
p. 584 - 587,) Jornandes, (de Rebus p. 31, 32,) and the chronicles of
Idatius and Isidore.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[167](daf03022.htm#fr_579.md) Ausonius (de Claris
Urbibus, p. 257 - 262) celebrates Bourdeaux with the partial affection
of a native. See in Salvian (de Gubern. Dei, p. 228. Paris, 1608) a
florid description of the provinces of Aquitain and Novempopulania.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[168](daf03022.htm#fr_580.md) Orosius (l. vii. c.
32, p. 550) commends the mildness and modesty of these Burgundians, who
treated their subjects of Gaul as their Christian brethren. Mascou has
illustrated the origin of their kingdom in the four first annotations at
the end of his laborious History of the Ancient Germans, vol. ii. p. 555
- 572, of the English translation.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[169](daf03022.htm#fr_581.md) See Mascou, l. viii.
c. 43, 44, 45. Except in a short and suspicious line of the Chronicle of
Prosper, (in tom. i. p. 638,) the name of Pharamond is never mentioned
before the seventh century. The author of the Gesta Francorum (in tom.
ii. p. 543) suggests, probably enough, that the choice of Pharamond, or
at least of a king, was recommended to the Franks by his father
Marcomir, who was an exile in Tuscany. Note: The first mention of
Pharamond is in the Gesta Francorum, assigned to about the year 720. St.
Martin, iv. 469. The modern French writers in general subscribe to the
opinion of Thierry: Faramond fils de Markomir, quo que son nom soit bien
germanique, et son regne possible, ne figure pas dans les histoires les
plus dignes de foi. A. Thierry, Lettres l'Histoire de France, p. 90. -

<span id="fn_582"></span>[170](daf03022.htm#fr_582.md) O Lycida, vivi

agelli Diseret: Haec mea sunt; veteres migrate coloni. Nunc victi
tristes, &c.

See the whole of the ninth eclogue, with the useful Commentary of
Servius. Fifteen miles of the Mantuan territory were assigned to the
veterans, with a reservation, in favor of the inhabitants, of three
miles round the city. Even in this favor they were cheated by Alfenus
Varus, a famous lawyer, and one of the commissioners, who measured eight
hundred paces of water and morass.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[171](daf03022.htm#fr_583.md) See the remarkable
passage of the Eucharisticon of Paulinus, 575, apud Mascou, l. viii. c.
42.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[172](daf03022.htm#fr_584.md) This important truth
is established by the accuracy of Tillemont, (Hist. des Emp. tom. v. p.
641,) and by the ingenuity of the Abbe Dubos, (Hist. de l'Etablissement
de la Monarchie Francoise dans les Gaules, tom. i. p. 259.)

<span id="fn_585"></span>[173](daf03022.htm#fr_585.md) Zosimus (l. vi. 376,
383) relates in a few words the revolt of Britain and Armorica. Our
antiquarians, even the great Cambder himself, have been betrayed into
many gross errors, by their imperfect knowledge of the history of the
continent.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[174](daf03022.htm#fr_586.md) The limits of
Armorica are defined by two national geographers, Messieurs De Valois
and D'Anville, in their Notitias of Ancient Gaul. The word had been used
in a more extensive, and was afterwards contracted to a much narrower,
signification.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[175](daf03022.htm#fr_587.md) Gens inter geminos
notissima clauditur amnes, Armoricana prius veteri cognomine dicta.
Torva, ferox, ventosa, procax, incauta, rebellis; Inconstans, disparque
sibi novitatis amore; Prodiga verborum, sed non et prodiga facti.
Erricus, Monach. in Vit. St. Germani. l. v. apud Vales. Notit.
Galliarum, p. 43. Valesius alleges several testimonies to confirm this
character; to which I shall add the evidence of the presbyter
Constantine, (A.D. 488,) who, in the life of St. Germain, calls the
Armorican rebels mobilem et indisciplinatum populum. See the Historians
of France, tom. i. p. 643.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[176](daf03022.htm#fr_588.md) I thought it
necessary to enter my protest against this part of the system of the
Abbe Dubos, which Montesquieu has so vigorously opposed. See Esprit des
Loix, l. xxx. c. 24. Note: See Memoires de Gallet sur l'Origine des
Bretons, quoted by Daru Histoire de Bretagne, i. p. 57. According to the
opinion of these authors, the government of Armorica was monarchical
from the period of its independence on the Roman empire. - M.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[177](daf03022.htm#fr_589.md) The words of
Procopius (de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. 2, p. 181, Louvre edition) in a
very important passage, which has been too much neglected Even Bede
(Hist. Gent. Anglican. l. i. c. 12, p. 50, edit. Smith) acknowledges
that the Romans finally left Britain in the reign of Honorius. Yet our
modern historians and antiquaries extend the term of their dominion; and
there are some who allow only the interval of a few months between their
departure and the arrival of the Saxons.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[178](daf03022.htm#fr_590.md) Bede has not
forgotten the occasional aid of the legions against the Scots and Picts;
and more authentic proof will hereafter be produced, that the
independent Britons raised 12,000 men for the service of the emperor
Anthemius, in Gaul.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[179](daf03022.htm#fr_591.md) I owe it to myself,
and to historic truth, to declare, that some circumstances in this
paragraph are founded only on conjecture and analogy. The stubbornness
of our language has sometimes forced me to deviate from the conditional
into the indicative mood.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[180](daf03022.htm#fr_592.md) Zosimus, l. vi. p.
383.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[181](daf03022.htm#fr_593.md) Two cities of
Britain were municipia, nine colonies, ten Latii jure donatoe, twelve
stipendiarioe of eminent note. This detail is taken from Richard of
Cirencester, de Situ Britanniae, p. 36; and though it may not seem
probable that he wrote from the Mss. of a Roman general, he shows a
genuine knowledge of antiquity, very extraordinary for a monk of the
fourteenth century.

Sisteron, in the second Narbonnese, and named by him Theopolis.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[185](daf03022.htm#fr_597.md) The establishment of
their power would have been easy indeed, if we could adopt the
impracticable scheme of a lively and learned antiquarian; who supposes
that the British monarchs of the several tribes continued to reign,
though with subordinate jurisdiction, from the time of Claudius to that
of Honorius. See Whitaker's History of Manchester, vol. i. p. 247 - 257.

the monk of Bethlem received the earliest and most accurate

<span id="fn_600"></span>[188](daf03022.htm#fr_600.md) It is reported of
three British bishops who assisted at the council of Rimini, A.D. 359,

circumstances.

of this edict, as published by Sirmond, (Not. ad Sidon. Apollin. p.
148.) Hincmar of Rheims, who assigns a place to the bishops, had
probably seen (in the ninth century) a more perfect copy. Dubos, Hist.
Critique de la Monarchie Francoise, tom. i. p. 241 - 255

<span id="fn_603"></span>[191](daf03022.htm#fr_603.md) It is evident from
the Notitia, that the seven provinces were the Viennensis, the maritime
Alps, the first and second Narbonnese Novempopulania, and the first and
second Aquitain. In the room of the first Aquitain, the Abbe Dubos, on
the authority of Hincmar, desires to introduce the first Lugdunensis, or
Lyonnese.
