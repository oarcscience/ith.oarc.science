### Chapter XXIX: Division Of Roman Empire Between Sons Of Theodosius. Part I.

Final Division Of The Roman Empire Between The Sons Of Theodosius. -
Reign Of Arcadius And Honorius - Administration Of Rufinus And Stilicho.
- Revolt And Defeat Of Gildo In Africa. The genius of Rome expired with
Theodosius; the last of the successors of Augustus and Constantine, who
appeared in the field at the head of their armies, and whose authority
was universally acknowledged throughout the whole extent of the empire.
The memory of his virtues still continued, however, to protect the
feeble and inexperienced youth of his two sons. After the death of their
father, Arcadius and Honorius were saluted, by the unanimous consent of
mankind, as the lawful emperors of the East, and of the West; and the
oath of fidelity was eagerly taken by every order of the state; the
senates of old and new Rome, the clergy, the magistrates, the soldiers,
and the people. Arcadius, who was then about eighteen years of age, was
born in Spain, in the humble habitation of a private family. But he
received a princely education in the palace of Constantinople; and his
inglorious life was spent in that peaceful and splendid seat of royalty,
from whence he appeared to reign over the provinces of Thrace, Asia
Minor, Syria, and Egypt, from the Lower Danube to the confines of Persia
and Aethiopia. His younger brother Honorius, assumed, in the eleventh
year of his age, the nominal government of Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain,
and Britain; and the troops, which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom,
were opposed, on one side, to the Caledonians, and on the other, to the
Moors. The great and martial praefecture of Illyricum was divided
between the two princes: the defence and possession of the provinces of
Noricum, Pannonia, and Dalmatia still belonged to the Western empire;
but the two large dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia, which Gratian had
intrusted to the valor of Theodosius, were forever united to the empire
of the East. The boundary in Europe was not very different from the line
which now separates the Germans and the Turks; and the respective
advantages of territory, riches, populousness, and military strength,
were fairly balanced and compensated, in this final and permanent
division of the Roman empire. The hereditary sceptre of the sons of
Theodosius appeared to be the gift of nature, and of their father; the
generals and ministers had been accustomed to adore the majesty of the
royal infants; and the army and people were not admonished of their
rights, and of their power, by the dangerous example of a recent
election. The gradual discovery of the weakness of Arcadius and
Honorius, and the repeated calamities of their reign, were not
sufficient to obliterate the deep and early impressions of loyalty. The
subjects of Rome, who still reverenced the persons, or rather the names,
of their sovereigns, beheld, with equal abhorrence, the rebels who
opposed, and the ministers who abused, the authority of the throne.

Theodosius had tarnished the glory of his reign by the elevation of
Rufinus; an odious favorite, who, in an age of civil and religious
faction, has deserved, from every party, the imputation of every crime.
The strong impulse of ambition and avarice  <span
id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_226.md) had urged Rufinus to abandon his native
country, an obscure corner of Gaul,  <span
id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_227.md) to advance his fortune in the capital of
the East: the talent of bold and ready elocution,  <span
id="fr_228"></span>[3](#fn_228.md) qualified him to succeed in the
lucrative profession of the law; and his success in that profession was
a regular step to the most honorable and important employments of the
state. He was raised, by just degrees, to the station of master of the
offices. In the exercise of his various functions, so essentially
connected with the whole system of civil government, he acquired the
confidence of a monarch, who soon discovered his diligence and capacity
in business, and who long remained ignorant of the pride, the malice,
and the covetousness of his disposition. These vices were concealed
beneath the mask of profound dissimulation;  <span
id="fr_229"></span>[4](#fn_229.md) his passions were subservient only to
the passions of his master; yet in the horrid massacre of Thessalonica,
the cruel Rufinus inflamed the fury, without imitating the repentance,
of Theodosius. The minister, who viewed with proud indifference the rest
of mankind, never forgave the appearance of an injury; and his personal
enemies had forfeited, in his opinion, the merit of all public services.
Promotus, the master-general of the infantry, had saved the empire from
the invasion of the Ostrogoths; but he indignantly supported the
preeminence of a rival, whose character and profession he despised; and
in the midst of a public council, the impatient soldier was provoked to
chastise with a blow the indecent pride of the favorite. This act of
violence was represented to the emperor as an insult, which it was
incumbent on his dignity to resent. The disgrace and exile of Promotus
were signified by a peremptory order, to repair, without delay, to a
military station on the banks of the Danube; and the death of that
general (though he was slain in a skirmish with the Barbarians) was
imputed to the perfidious arts of Rufinus.  <span
id="fr_230"></span>[5](#fn_230.md) The sacrifice of a hero gratified his
revenge; the honors of the consulship elated his vanity; but his power
was still imperfect and precarious, as long as the important posts of
praefect of the East, and of praefect of Constantinople, were filled by
Tatian,  <span id="fr_231"></span>[6](#fn_231.md) and his son Proculus;
whose united authority balanced, for some time, the ambition and favor
of the master of the offices. The two praefects were accused of rapine
and corruption in the administration of the laws and finances. For the
trial of these illustrious offenders, the emperor constituted a special
commission: several judges were named to share the guilt and reproach of
injustice; but the right of pronouncing sentence was reserved to the
president alone, and that president was Rufinus himself. The father,
stripped of the praefecture of the East, was thrown into a dungeon; but
the son, conscious that few ministers can be found innocent, where an
enemy is their judge, had secretly escaped; and Rufinus must have been
satisfied with the least obnoxious victim, if despotism had not
condescended to employ the basest and most ungenerous artifice. The
prosecution was conducted with an appearance of equity and moderation,
which flattered Tatian with the hope of a favorable event: his
confidence was fortified by the solemn assurances, and perfidious oaths,
of the president, who presumed to interpose the sacred name of
Theodosius himself; and the unhappy father was at last persuaded to
recall, by a private letter, the fugitive Proculus. He was instantly
seized, examined, condemned, and beheaded, in one of the suburbs of
Constantinople, with a precipitation which disappointed the clemency of
the emperor. Without respecting the misfortunes of a consular senator,
the cruel judges of Tatian compelled him to behold the execution of his
son: the fatal cord was fastened round his own neck; but in the moment
when he expected. and perhaps desired, the relief of a speedy death, he
was permitted to consume the miserable remnant of his old age in poverty
and exile.  <span id="fr_232"></span>[7](#fn_232.md) The punishment of the
two praefects might, perhaps, be excused by the exceptionable parts of
their own conduct; the enmity of Rufinus might be palliated by the
jealous and unsociable nature of ambition. But he indulged a spirit of
revenge equally repugnant to prudence and to justice, when he degraded
their native country of Lycia from the rank of Roman provinces;
stigmatized a guiltless people with a mark of ignominy; and declared,
that the countrymen of Tatian and Proculus should forever remain
incapable of holding any employment of honor or advantage under the
Imperial government.  <span id="fr_233"></span>[8](#fn_233.md) The new
praefect of the East (for Rufinus instantly succeeded to the vacant
honors of his adversary) was not diverted, however, by the most criminal
pursuits, from the performance of the religious duties, which in that
age were considered as the most essential to salvation. In the suburb of
Chalcedon, surnamed the Oak, he had built a magnificent villa; to which
he devoutly added a stately church, consecrated to the apostles St.
Peter and St. Paul, and continually sanctified by the prayers and
penance of a regular society of monks. A numerous, and almost general,
synod of the bishops of the Eastern empire, was summoned to celebrate,
at the same time, the dedication of the church, and the baptism of the
founder. This double ceremony was performed with extraordinary pomp; and
when Rufinus was purified, in the holy font, from all the sins that he
had hitherto committed, a venerable hermit of Egypt rashly proposed
himself as the sponsor of a proud and ambitious statesman.  <span
id="fr_234"></span>[9](#fn_234.md)

The character of Theodosius imposed on his minister the task of
hypocrisy, which disguised, and sometimes restrained, the abuse of
power; and Rufinus was apprehensive of disturbing the indolent slumber
of a prince still capable of exerting the abilities and the virtue,
which had raised him to the throne.  <span
id="fr_235"></span>[10](#fn_235.md) But the absence, and, soon afterwards,
the death, of the emperor, confirmed the absolute authority of Rufinus
over the person and dominions of Arcadius; a feeble youth, whom the
imperious praefect considered as his pupil, rather than his sovereign.
Regardless of the public opinion, he indulged his passions without
remorse, and without resistance; and his malignant and rapacious spirit
rejected every passion that might have contributed to his own glory, or
the happiness of the people. His avarice,  <span
id="fr_236"></span>[11](#fn_236.md) which seems to have prevailed, in his
corrupt mind, over every other sentiment, attracted the wealth of the
East, by the various arts of partial and general extortion; oppressive
taxes, scandalous bribery, immoderate fines, unjust confiscations,
forced or fictitious testaments, by which the tyrant despoiled of their
lawful inheritance the children of strangers, or enemies; and the public
sale of justice, as well as of favor, which he instituted in the palace
of Constantinople. The ambitious candidate eagerly solicited, at the
expense of the fairest part of his patrimony, the honors and emoluments
of some provincial government; the lives and fortunes of the unhappy
people were abandoned to the most liberal purchaser; and the public
discontent was sometimes appeased by the sacrifice of an unpopular
criminal, whose punishment was profitable only to the praefect of the
East, his accomplice and his judge. If avarice were not the blindest of
the human passions, the motives of Rufinus might excite our curiosity;
and we might be tempted to inquire with what view he violated every
principle of humanity and justice, to accumulate those immense
treasures, which he could not spend without folly, nor possess without
danger. Perhaps he vainly imagined, that he labored for the interest of
an only daughter, on whom he intended to bestow his royal pupil, and the
august rank of Empress of the East. Perhaps he deceived himself by the
opinion, that his avarice was the instrument of his ambition. He aspired
to place his fortune on a secure and independent basis, which should no
longer depend on the caprice of the young emperor; yet he neglected to
conciliate the hearts of the soldiers and people, by the liberal
distribution of those riches, which he had acquired with so much toil,
and with so much guilt. The extreme parsimony of Rufinus left him only
the reproach and envy of ill-gotten wealth; his dependants served him
without attachment; the universal hatred of mankind was repressed only
by the influence of servile fear. The fate of Lucian proclaimed to the
East, that the praefect, whose industry was much abated in the despatch
of ordinary business, was active and indefatigable in the pursuit of
revenge. Lucian, the son of the praefect Florentius, the oppressor of
Gaul, and the enemy of Julian, had employed a considerable part of his
inheritance, the fruit of rapine and corruption, to purchase the
friendship of Rufinus, and the high office of Count of the East. But the
new magistrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court, and of
the times; disgraced his benefactor by the contrast of a virtuous and
temperate administration; and presumed to refuse an act of injustice,
which might have tended to the profit of the emperor's uncle. Arcadius
was easily persuaded to resent the supposed insult; and the praefect of
the East resolved to execute in person the cruel vengeance, which he
meditated against this ungrateful delegate of his power. He performed
with incessant speed the journey of seven or eight hundred miles, from
Constantinople to Antioch, entered the capital of Syria at the dead of
night, and spread universal consternation among a people ignorant of his
design, but not ignorant of his character. The Count of the fifteen
provinces of the East was dragged, like the vilest malefactor, before
the arbitrary tribunal of Rufinus. Notwithstanding the clearest evidence
of his integrity, which was not impeached even by the voice of an
accuser, Lucian was condemned, almost with out a trial, to suffer a
cruel and ignominious punishment. The ministers of the tyrant, by the
orders, and in the presence, of their master, beat him on the neck with
leather thongs armed at the extremities with lead; and when he fainted
under the violence of the pain, he was removed in a close litter, to
conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the indignant city. No sooner
had Rufinus perpetrated this inhuman act, the sole object of his
expedition, than he returned, amidst the deep and silent curses of a
trembling people, from Antioch to Constantinople; and his diligence was
accelerated by the hope of accomplishing, without delay, the nuptials of
his daughter with the emperor of the East.  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[12](#fn_237.md)

But Rufinus soon experienced, that a prudent minister should constantly
secure his royal captive by the strong, though invisible chain of habit;
and that the merit, and much more easily the favor, of the absent, are
obliterated in a short time from the mind of a weak and capricious
sovereign. While the praefect satiated his revenge at Antioch, a secret
conspiracy of the favorite eunuchs, directed by the great chamberlain
Eutropius, undermined his power in the palace of Constantinople. They
discovered that Arcadius was not inclined to love the daughter of
Rufinus, who had been chosen, without his consent, for his bride; and
they contrived to substitute in her place the fair Eudoxia, the daughter
of Bauto,  <span id="fr_238"></span>[13](#fn_238.md) a general of the
Franks in the service of Rome; and who was educated, since the death of
her father, in the family of the sons of Promotus. The young emperor,
whose chastity had been strictly guarded by the pious care of his tutor
Arsenius,  <span id="fr_239"></span>[14](#fn_239.md) eagerly listened to
the artful and flattering descriptions of the charms of Eudoxia: he
gazed with impatient ardor on her picture, and he understood the
necessity of concealing his amorous designs from the knowledge of a
minister who was so deeply interested to oppose the consummation of his
happiness. Soon after the return of Rufinus, the approaching ceremony of
the royal nuptials was announced to the people of Constantinople, who
prepared to celebrate, with false and hollow acclamations, the fortune
of his daughter. A splendid train of eunuchs and officers issued, in
hymeneal pomp, from the gates of the palace; bearing aloft the diadem,
the robes, and the inestimable ornaments, of the future empress. The
solemn procession passed through the streets of the city, which were
adorned with garlands, and filled with spectators; but when it reached
the house of the sons of Promotus, the principal eunuch respectfully
entered the mansion, invested the fair Eudoxia with the Imperial robes,
and conducted her in triumph to the palace and bed of Arcadius.  <span
id="fr_240"></span>[15](#fn_240.md) The secrecy and success with which this
conspiracy against Rufinus had been conducted, imprinted a mark of
indelible ridicule on the character of a minister, who had suffered
himself to be deceived, in a post where the arts of deceit and
dissimulation constitute the most distinguished merit. He considered,
with a mixture of indignation and fear, the victory of an aspiring
eunuch, who had secretly captivated the favor of his sovereign; and the
disgrace of his daughter, whose interest was inseparably connected with
his own, wounded the tenderness, or, at least, the pride of Rufinus. At
the moment when he flattered himself that he should become the father of
a line of kings, a foreign maid, who had been educated in the house of
his implacable enemies, was introduced into the Imperial bed; and
Eudoxia soon displayed a superiority of sense and spirit, to improve the
ascendant which her beauty must acquire over the mind of a fond and
youthful husband. The emperor would soon be instructed to hate, to fear,
and to destroy the powerful subject, whom he had injured; and the
consciousness of guilt deprived Rufinus of every hope, either of safety
or comfort, in the retirement of a private life. But he still possessed
the most effectual means of defending his dignity, and perhaps of
oppressing his enemies. The praefect still exercised an uncontrolled
authority over the civil and military government of the East; and his
treasures, if he could resolve to use them, might be employed to procure
proper instruments for the execution of the blackest designs, that
pride, ambition, and revenge could suggest to a desperate statesman. The
character of Rufinus seemed to justify the accusations that he conspired
against the person of his sovereign, to seat himself on the vacant
throne; and that he had secretly invited the Huns and the Goths to
invade the provinces of the empire, and to increase the public
confusion. The subtle praefect, whose life had been spent in the
intrigues of the palace, opposed, with equal arms, the artful measures
of the eunuch Eutropius; but the timid soul of Rufinus was astonished by
the hostile approach of a more formidable rival, of the great Stilicho,
the general, or rather the master, of the empire of the West.  <span
id="fr_241"></span>[16](#fn_241.md)

The celestial gift, which Achilles obtained, and Alexander envied, of a
poet worthy to celebrate the actions of heroes has been enjoyed by
Stilicho, in a much higher degree than might have been expected from the
declining state of genius, and of art. The muse of Claudian,  <span
id="fr_242"></span>[17](#fn_242.md) devoted to his service, was always
prepared to stigmatize his adversaries, Rufinus, or Eutropius, with
eternal infamy; or to paint, in the most splendid colors, the victories
and virtues of a powerful benefactor. In the review of a period
indifferently supplied with authentic materials, we cannot refuse to
illustrate the annals of Honorius, from the invectives, or the
panegyrics, of a contemporary writer; but as Claudian appears to have
indulged the most ample privilege of a poet and a courtier, some
criticism will be requisite to translate the language of fiction or
exaggeration, into the truth and simplicity of historic prose. His
silence concerning the family of Stilicho may be admitted as a proof,
that his patron was neither able, nor desirous, to boast of a long
series of illustrious progenitors; and the slight mention of his father,
an officer of Barbarian cavalry in the service of Valens, seems to
countenance the assertion, that the general, who so long commanded the
armies of Rome, was descended from the savage and perfidious race of the
Vandals.  <span id="fr_243"></span>[18](#fn_243.md) If Stilicho had not
possessed the external advantages of strength and stature, the most
flattering bard, in the presence of so many thousand spectators, would
have hesitated to affirm, that he surpassed the measure of the demi-gods
of antiquity; and that whenever he moved, with lofty steps, through the
streets of the capital, the astonished crowd made room for the stranger,
who displayed, in a private condition, the awful majesty of a hero. From
his earliest youth he embraced the profession of arms; his prudence and
valor were soon distinguished in the field; the horsemen and archers of
the East admired his superior dexterity; and in each degree of his
military promotions, the public judgment always prevented and approved
the choice of the sovereign. He was named, by Theodosius, to ratify a
solemn treaty with the monarch of Persia; he supported, during that
important embassy, the dignity of the Roman name; and after he return to
Constantinople, his merit was rewarded by an intimate and honorable
alliance with the Imperial family. Theodosius had been prompted, by a
pious motive of fraternal affection, to adopt, for his own, the daughter
of his brother Honorius; the beauty and accomplishments of Serena  <span
id="fr_244"></span>[19](#fn_244.md) were universally admired by the
obsequious court; and Stilicho obtained the preference over a crowd of
rivals, who ambitiously disputed the hand of the princess, and the favor
of her adopted father.  <span id="fr_245"></span>[20](#fn_245.md) The
assurance that the husband of Serena would be faithful to the throne,
which he was permitted to approach, engaged the emperor to exalt the
fortunes, and to employ the abilities, of the sagacious and intrepid
Stilicho. He rose, through the successive steps of master of the horse,
and count of the domestics, to the supreme rank of master-general of all
the cavalry and infantry of the Roman, or at least of the Western,
empire;  <span id="fr_246"></span>[21](#fn_246.md) and his enemies
confessed, that he invariably disdained to barter for gold the rewards
of merit, or to defraud the soldiers of the pay and gratifications which
they deserved or claimed, from the liberality of the state.  <span
id="fr_247"></span>[22](#fn_247.md) The valor and conduct which he
afterwards displayed, in the defence of Italy, against the arms of
Alaric and Radagaisus, may justify the fame of his early achievements
and in an age less attentive to the laws of honor, or of pride, the
Roman generals might yield the preeminence of rank, to the ascendant of
superior genius.  <span id="fr_248"></span>[23](#fn_248.md) He lamented,
and revenged, the murder of Promotus, his rival and his friend; and the
massacre of many thousands of the flying Bastarnae is represented by the
poet as a bloody sacrifice, which the Roman Achilles offered to the
manes of another Patroclus. The virtues and victories of Stilicho
deserved the hatred of Rufinus: and the arts of calumny might have been
successful if the tender and vigilant Serena had not protected her
husband against his domestic foes, whilst he vanquished in the field the
enemies of the empire.  <span id="fr_249"></span>[24](#fn_249.md)
Theodosius continued to support an unworthy minister, to whose diligence
he delegated the government of the palace, and of the East; but when he
marched against the tyrant Eugenius, he associated his faithful general
to the labors and glories of the civil war; and in the last moments of
his life, the dying monarch recommended to Stilicho the care of his
sons, and of the republic.  <span id="fr_250"></span>[25](#fn_250.md) The
ambition and the abilities of Stilicho were not unequal to the important
trust; and he claimed the guardianship of the two empires, during the
minority of Arcadius and Honorius.  <span
id="fr_251"></span>[26](#fn_251.md) The first measure of his
administration, or rather of his reign, displayed to the nations the
vigor and activity of a spirit worthy to command. He passed the Alps in
the depth of winter; descended the stream of the Rhine, from the
fortress of Basil to the marshes of Batavia; reviewed the state of the
garrisons; repressed the enterprises of the Germans; and, after
establishing along the banks a firm and honorable peace, returned, with
incredible speed, to the palace of Milan.  <span
id="fr_252"></span>[27](#fn_252.md) The person and court of Honorius were
subject to the master-general of the West; and the armies and provinces
of Europe obeyed, without hesitation, a regular authority, which was
exercised in the name of their young sovereign. Two rivals only remained
to dispute the claims, and to provoke the vengeance, of Stilicho. Within
the limits of Africa, Gildo, the Moor, maintained a proud and dangerous
independence; and the minister of Constantinople asserted his equal
reign over the emperor, and the empire, of the East.

(Tillemont, Hist. des Emp. tom. v. p. 770,) though De Marca is ashamed

Novempopulania, now a small village of Gassony, (D'Anville, Notice de

the fall of Tatian and his son, (l. iv. p. 273, 274,) asserts their
innocence; and even his testimony may outweigh the charges of their
enemies, (Cod. Theod. tom. iv. p. 489,) who accuse them of oppressing
the Curiae. The connection of Tatian with the Arians, while he was
praefect of Egypt, (A.D. 373,) inclines Tillemont to believe that he was
guilty of every crime, (Hist. des Emp. tom. v. p. 360. Mem. Eccles. tom

recited and repealed by Arcadius, (A.D. 296,) on the Theodosian Code, l.

Rufin. i. 234,) and Godefroy, (tom. iii. p. 279,) is perfectly clear.

The scruples of Pagi and Tillemont can arise only from their zeal for

synod, in which St. Gregory of Nyssa performed a conspicuous part.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[10](daf03009.htm#fr_235.md) Montesquieu (Esprit
des Loix, l. xii. c. 12) praises one of the laws of Theodosius addressed
to the praefect Rufinus, (l. ix. tit. iv. leg. unic.,) to discourage the
prosecution of treasonable, or sacrilegious, words. A tyrannical statute
always proves the existence of tyranny; but a laudable edict may only
contain the specious professions, or ineffectual wishes, of the prince,
or his ministers. This, I am afraid, is a just, though mortifying, canon
of criticism.

Congestae cumulantur opes; orbisque ruinas Accipit una domus.

This character (Claudian, in. Rufin. i. 184 - 220) is confirmed by
Jerom, a disinterested witness, (dedecus insatiabilis avaritiae, tom. i.
ad Heliodor. p. 26,) by Zosimus, (l. v. p. 286,) and by Suidas, who
copied the history of Eunapius.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[12](daf03009.htm#fr_237.md) - Caetera segnis; Ad
facinus velox; penitus regione remotas Impiger ire vias.

This allusion of Claudian (in Rufin. i. 241) is again explained by the
circumstantial narrative of Zosimus, (l. v. p. 288, 289.)

<span id="fn_238"></span>[13](daf03009.htm#fr_238.md) Zosimus (l. iv. p.
243) praises the valor, prudence, and integrity of Bauto the Frank. See
Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 771.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[14](daf03009.htm#fr_239.md) Arsenius escaped from
the palace of Constantinople, and passed fifty-five years in rigid
penance in the monasteries of Egypt. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom.
xiv. p. 676 - 702; and Fleury, Hist Eccles. tom. v. p. 1, &c.; but the
latter, for want of authentic materials, has given too much credit to
the legend of Metaphrastes.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[15](daf03009.htm#fr_240.md) This story (Zosimus,
l. v. p. 290) proves that the hymeneal rites of antiquity were still
practised, without idolatry, by the Christians of the East; and the
bride was forcibly conducted from the house of her parents to that of
her husband. Our form of marriage requires, with less delicacy, the
express and public consent of a virgin.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[16](daf03009.htm#fr_241.md) Zosimus, (l. v. p.
290,) Orosius, (l. vii. c. 37,) and the Chronicle of Marcellinus.
Claudian (in Rufin. ii. 7 - 100) paints, in lively colors, the distress
and guilt of the praefect.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[17](daf03009.htm#fr_242.md) Stilicho, directly or
indirectly, is the perpetual theme of Claudian. The youth and private
life of the hero are vaguely expressed in the poem on his first
consulship, 35 - 140.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[18](daf03009.htm#fr_243.md) Vandalorum, imbellis,
avarae, perfidae, et dolosae, gentis, genere editus. Orosius, l. vii. c.
38. Jerom (tom. i. ad Gerontiam, p. 93) call him a Semi-Barbarian.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[19](daf03009.htm#fr_244.md) Claudian, in an
imperfect poem, has drawn a fair, perhaps a flattering, portrait of
Serena. That favorite niece of Theodosius was born, as well as here
sister Thermantia, in Spain; from whence, in their earliest youth, they
were honorably conducted to the palace of Constantinople.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[20](daf03009.htm#fr_245.md) Some doubt may be
entertained, whether this adoption was legal or only metaphorical, (see
Ducange, Fam. Byzant. p. 75.) An old inscription gives Stilicho the
singular title of Pro-gener Divi Theodosius

<span id="fn_246"></span>[21](daf03009.htm#fr_246.md) Claudian (Laus
Serenae, 190, 193) expresses, in poetic language "the dilectus equorum,"
and the "gemino mox idem culmine duxit agmina." The inscription adds,
"count of the domestics," an important command, which Stilicho, in the
height of his grandeur, might prudently retain.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[22](daf03009.htm#fr_247.md) The beautiful lines
of Claudian (in i. Cons. Stilich. ii. 113) displays his genius; but the
integrity of Stilicho (in the military administration) is much more
firmly established by the unwilling evidence of Zosimus, (l. v. p. 345.)

<span id="fn_248"></span>[23](daf03009.htm#fr_248.md) - Si bellica moles
Ingrueret, quamvis annis et jure minori, Cedere grandaevos equitum
peditumque magistros Adspiceres. Claudian, Laus Seren. p. 196, &c. A
modern general would deem their submission either heroic patriotism or
abject servility.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[24](daf03009.htm#fr_249.md) Compare the poem on
the first consulship (i. 95 - 115) with the Laus Serenoe (227 - 237,
where it unfortunately breaks off.) We may perceive the deep, inveterate
malice of Rufinus.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[25](daf03009.htm#fr_250.md) - Quem fratribus ipse
Discedens, clypeum defensoremque dedisti. Yet the nomination (iv. Cons.
Hon. 432) was private, (iii. Cons. Hon. 142,) cunctos discedere ...
jubet; and may therefore be suspected. Zosimus and Suidas apply to
Stilicho and Rufinus the same equal title of guardians, or procurators.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[26](daf03009.htm#fr_251.md) The Roman law
distinguishes two sorts of minority, which expired at the age of
fourteen, and of twenty-five. The one was subject to the tutor, or
guardian, of the person; the other, to the curator, or trustee, of the
estate, (Heineccius, Antiquitat. Rom. ad Jurisprudent. pertinent. l. i.
tit. xxii. xxiii. p. 218 - 232.) But these legal ideas were never
accurately transferred into the constitution of an elective monarchy.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[27](daf03009.htm#fr_252.md) See Claudian, (i.
Cons. Stilich. i. 188 - 242;) but he must allow more than fifteen days
for the journey and return between Milan and Leyden.
