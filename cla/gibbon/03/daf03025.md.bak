### Chapter XXXII: Emperors Arcadius, Eutropius, Theodosius II. Part III.

Yet a reasonable doubt may be entertained, whether any stain of
hereditary guilt could be derived from Arcadius to his successor.
Eudoxia was a young and beautiful woman, who indulged her passions, and
despised her husband; Count John enjoyed, at least, the familiar
confidence of the empress; and the public named him as the real father
of Theodosius the younger.  <span id="fr_661"></span>[59](#fn_661.md) The
birth of a son was accepted, however, by the pious husband, as an event
the most fortunate and honorable to himself, to his family, and to the
Eastern world: and the royal infant, by an unprecedented favor, was
invested with the titles of Caesar and Augustus. In less than four years
afterwards, Eudoxia, in the bloom of youth, was destroyed by the
consequences of a miscarriage; and this untimely death confounded the
prophecy of a holy bishop,  <span id="fr_662"></span>[60](#fn_662.md) who,
amidst the universal joy, had ventured to foretell, that she should
behold the long and auspicious reign of her glorious son. The Catholics
applauded the justice of Heaven, which avenged the persecution of St.
Chrysostom; and perhaps the emperor was the only person who sincerely
bewailed the loss of the haughty and rapacious Eudoxia. Such a domestic
misfortune afflicted him more deeply than the public calamities of the
East;  <span id="fr_663"></span>[61](#fn_663.md) the licentious excursions,
from Pontus to Palestine, of the Isaurian robbers, whose impunity
accused the weakness of the government; and the earthquakes, the
conflagrations, the famine, and the flights of locusts,  <span
id="fr_664"></span>[62](#fn_664.md) which the popular discontent was
equally disposed to attribute to the incapacity of the monarch. At
length, in the thirty-first year of his age, after a reign (if we may
abuse that word) of thirteen years, three months, and fifteen days,
Arcadius expired in the palace of Constantinople. It is impossible to
delineate his character; since, in a period very copiously furnished
with historical materials, it has not been possible to remark one action
that properly belongs to the son of the great Theodosius.

The historian Procopius  <span id="fr_665"></span>[63](#fn_665.md) has
indeed illuminated the mind of the dying emperor with a ray of human
prudence, or celestial wisdom. Arcadius considered, with anxious
foresight, the helpless condition of his son Theodosius, who was no more
than seven years of age, the dangerous factions of a minority, and the
aspiring spirit of Jezdegerd, the Persian monarch. Instead of tempting
the allegiance of an ambitious subject, by the participation of supreme
power, he boldly appealed to the magnanimity of a king; and placed, by a
solemn testament, the sceptre of the East in the hands of Jezdegerd
himself. The royal guardian accepted and discharged this honorable trust
with unexampled fidelity; and the infancy of Theodosius was protected by
the arms and councils of Persia. Such is the singular narrative of
Procopius; and his veracity is not disputed by Agathias,  <span
id="fr_666"></span>[64](#fn_666.md) while he presumes to dissent from his
judgment, and to arraign the wisdom of a Christian emperor, who, so
rashly, though so fortunately, committed his son and his dominions to
the unknown faith of a stranger, a rival, and a heathen. At the distance
of one hundred and fifty years, this political question might be debated
in the court of Justinian; but a prudent historian will refuse to
examine the propriety, till he has ascertained the truth, of the
testament of Arcadius. As it stands without a parallel in the history of
the world, we may justly require, that it should be attested by the
positive and unanimous evidence of contemporaries. The strange novelty
of the event, which excites our distrust, must have attracted their
notice; and their universal silence annihilates the vain tradition of
the succeeding age.

The maxims of Roman jurisprudence, if they could fairly be transferred
from private property to public dominion, would have adjudged to the
emperor Honorius the guardianship of his nephew, till he had attained,
at least, the fourteenth year of his age. But the weakness of Honorius,
and the calamities of his reign, disqualified him from prosecuting this
natural claim; and such was the absolute separation of the two
monarchies, both in interest and affection, that Constantinople would
have obeyed, with less reluctance, the orders of the Persian, than those
of the Italian, court. Under a prince whose weakness is disguised by the
external signs of manhood and discretion, the most worthless favorites
may secretly dispute the empire of the palace; and dictate to submissive
provinces the commands of a master, whom they direct and despise. But
the ministers of a child, who is incapable of arming them with the
sanction of the royal name, must acquire and exercise an independent
authority. The great officers of the state and army, who had been
appointed before the death of Arcadius, formed an aristocracy, which
might have inspired them with the idea of a free republic; and the
government of the Eastern empire was fortunately assumed by the praefect
Anthemius,  <span id="fr_667"></span>[65](#fn_667.md) who obtained, by his
superior abilities, a lasting ascendant over the minds of his equals.
The safety of the young emperor proved the merit and integrity of
Anthemius; and his prudent firmness sustained the force and reputation
of an infant reign. Uldin, with a formidable host of Barbarians, was
encamped in the heart of Thrace; he proudly rejected all terms of
accommodation; and, pointing to the rising sun, declared to the Roman
ambassadors, that the course of that planet should alone terminate the
conquest of the Huns. But the desertion of his confederates, who were
privately convinced of the justice and liberality of the Imperial
ministers, obliged Uldin to repass the Danube: the tribe of the Scyrri,
which composed his rear-guard, was almost extirpated; and many thousand
captives were dispersed to cultivate, with servile labor, the fields of
Asia.  <span id="fr_668"></span>[66](#fn_668.md) In the midst of the public
triumph, Constantinople was protected by a strong enclosure of new and
more extensive walls; the same vigilant care was applied to restore the
fortifications of the Illyrian cities; and a plan was judiciously
conceived, which, in the space of seven years, would have secured the
command of the Danube, by establishing on that river a perpetual fleet
of two hundred and fifty armed vessels.  <span
id="fr_669"></span>[67](#fn_669.md)

But the Romans had so long been accustomed to the authority of a
monarch, that the first, even among the females, of the Imperial family,
who displayed any courage or capacity, was permitted to ascend the
vacant throne of Theodosius. His sister Pulcheria,  <span
id="fr_670"></span>[68](#fn_670.md) who was only two years older than
himself, received, at the age of sixteen, the title of Augusta; and
though her favor might be sometimes clouded by caprice or intrigue, she
continued to govern the Eastern empire near forty years; during the long
minority of her brother, and after his death, in her own name, and in
the name of Marcian, her nominal husband. From a motive either of
prudence or religion, she embraced a life of celibacy; and
notwithstanding some aspersions on the chastity of Pulcheria,  <span
id="fr_671"></span>[69](#fn_671.md) this resolution, which she communicated
to her sisters Arcadia and Marina, was celebrated by the Christian
world, as the sublime effort of heroic piety. In the presence of the
clergy and people, the three daughters of Arcadius  <span
id="fr_672"></span>[70](#fn_672.md) dedicated their virginity to God; and
the obligation of their solemn vow was inscribed on a tablet of gold and
gems; which they publicly offered in the great church of Constantinople.
Their palace was converted into a monastery; and all males, except the
guides of their conscience, the saints who had forgotten the distinction
of sexes, were scrupulously excluded from the holy threshold. Pulcheria,
her two sisters, and a chosen train of favorite damsels, formed a
religious community: they denounced the vanity of dress; interrupted, by
frequent fasts, their simple and frugal diet; allotted a portion of
their time to works of embroidery; and devoted several hours of the day
and night to the exercises of prayer and psalmody. The piety of a
Christian virgin was adorned by the zeal and liberality of an empress.
Ecclesiastical history describes the splendid churches, which were built
at the expense of Pulcheria, in all the provinces of the East; her
charitable foundations for the benefit of strangers and the poor; the
ample donations which she assigned for the perpetual maintenance of
monastic societies; and the active severity with which she labored to
suppress the opposite heresies of Nestorius and Eutyches. Such virtues
were supposed to deserve the peculiar favor of the Deity: and the relics
of martyrs, as well as the knowledge of future events, were communicated
in visions and revelations to the Imperial saint.  <span
id="fr_673"></span>[71](#fn_673.md) Yet the devotion of Pulcheria never
diverted her indefatigable attention from temporal affairs; and she
alone, among all the descendants of the great Theodosius, appears to
have inherited any share of his manly spirit and abilities. The elegant
and familiar use which she had acquired, both of the Greek and Latin
languages, was readily applied to the various occasions of speaking or
writing, on public business: her deliberations were maturely weighed;
her actions were prompt and decisive; and, while she moved, without
noise or ostentation, the wheel of government, she discreetly attributed
to the genius of the emperor the long tranquillity of his reign. In the
last years of his peaceful life, Europe was indeed afflicted by the arms
of war; but the more extensive provinces of Asia still continued to
enjoy a profound and permanent repose. Theodosius the younger was never
reduced to the disgraceful necessity of encountering and punishing a
rebellious subject: and since we cannot applaud the vigor, some praise
may be due to the mildness and prosperity, of the administration of
Pulcheria.

The Roman world was deeply interested in the education of its master. A
regular course of study and exercise was judiciously instituted; of the
military exercises of riding, and shooting with the bow; of the liberal
studies of grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy: the most skilful masters
of the East ambitiously solicited the attention of their royal pupil;
and several noble youths were introduced into the palace, to animate his
diligence by the emulation of friendship. Pulcheria alone discharged the
important task of instructing her brother in the arts of government; but
her precepts may countenance some suspicions of the extent of her
capacity, or of the purity of her intentions. She taught him to maintain
a grave and majestic deportment; to walk, to hold his robes, to seat
himself on his throne, in a manner worthy of a great prince; to abstain
from laughter; to listen with condescension; to return suitable answers;
to assume, by turns, a serious or a placid countenance: in a word, to
represent with grace and dignity the external figure of a Roman emperor.
But Theodosius  <span id="fr_674"></span>[72](#fn_674.md) was never excited
to support the weight and glory of an illustrious name: and, instead of
aspiring to support his ancestors, he degenerated (if we may presume to
measure the degrees of incapacity) below the weakness of his father and
his uncle. Arcadius and Honorius had been assisted by the guardian care
of a parent, whose lessons were enforced by his authority and example.
But the unfortunate prince, who is born in the purple, must remain a
stranger to the voice of truth; and the son of Arcadius was condemned to
pass his perpetual infancy encompassed only by a servile train of women
and eunuchs. The ample leisure which he acquired by neglecting the
essential duties of his high office, was filled by idle amusements and
unprofitable studies. Hunting was the only active pursuit that could
tempt him beyond the limits of the palace; but he most assiduously
labored, sometimes by the light of a midnight lamp, in the mechanic
occupations of painting and carving; and the elegance with which he
transcribed religious books entitled the Roman emperor to the singular
epithet of Calligraphes, or a fair writer. Separated from the world by
an impenetrable veil, Theodosius trusted the persons whom he loved; he
loved those who were accustomed to amuse and flatter his indolence; and
as he never perused the papers that were presented for the royal
signature, the acts of injustice the most repugnant to his character
were frequently perpetrated in his name. The emperor himself was chaste,
temperate, liberal, and merciful; but these qualities, which can only
deserve the name of virtues when they are supported by courage and
regulated by discretion, were seldom beneficial, and they sometimes
proved mischievous, to mankind. His mind, enervated by a royal
education, was oppressed and degraded by abject superstition: he fasted,
he sung psalms, he blindly accepted the miracles and doctrines with
which his faith was continually nourished. Theodosius devoutly
worshipped the dead and living saints of the Catholic church; and he
once refused to eat, till an insolent monk, who had cast an
excommunication on his sovereign, condescended to heal the spiritual
wound which he had inflicted.  <span id="fr_675"></span>[73](#fn_675.md)

The story of a fair and virtuous maiden, exalted from a private
condition to the Imperial throne, might be deemed an incredible romance,
if such a romance had not been verified in the marriage of Theodosius.
The celebrated Athenais  <span id="fr_676"></span>[74](#fn_676.md) was
educated by her father Leontius in the religion and sciences of the
Greeks; and so advantageous was the opinion which the Athenian
philosopher entertained of his contemporaries, that he divided his
patrimony between his two sons, bequeathing to his daughter a small
legacy of one hundred pieces of gold, in the lively confidence that her
beauty and merit would be a sufficient portion. The jealousy and avarice
of her brothers soon compelled Athenais to seek a refuge at
Constantinople; and, with some hopes, either of justice or favor, to
throw herself at the feet of Pulcheria. That sagacious princess listened
to her eloquent complaint; and secretly destined the daughter of the
philosopher Leontius for the future wife of the emperor of the East, who
had now attained the twentieth year of his age. She easily excited the
curiosity of her brother, by an interesting picture of the charms of
Athenais; large eyes, a well- proportioned nose, a fair complexion,
golden locks, a slender person, a graceful demeanor, an understanding
improved by study, and a virtue tried by distress. Theodosius, concealed
behind a curtain in the apartment of his sister, was permitted to behold
the Athenian virgin: the modest youth immediately declared his pure and
honorable love; and the royal nuptials were celebrated amidst the
acclamations of the capital and the provinces. Athenais, who was easily
persuaded to renounce the errors of Paganism, received at her baptism
the Christian name of Eudocia; but the cautious Pulcheria withheld the
title of Augusta, till the wife of Theodosius had approved her
fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter, who espoused, fifteen years
afterwards, the emperor of the West. The brothers of Eudocia obeyed,
with some anxiety, her Imperial summons; but as she could easily forgive
their unfortunate unkindness, she indulged the tenderness, or perhaps
the vanity, of a sister, by promoting them to the rank of consuls and
praefects. In the luxury of the palace, she still cultivated those
ingenuous arts which had contributed to her greatness; and wisely
dedicated her talents to the honor of religion, and of her husband.
Eudocia composed a poetical paraphrase of the first eight books of the
Old Testament, and of the prophecies of Daniel and Zechariah; a cento of
the verses of Homer, applied to the life and miracles of Christ, the
legend of St. Cyprian, and a panegyric on the Persian victories of
Theodosius; and her writings, which were applauded by a servile and
superstitious age, have not been disdained by the candor of impartial
criticism.  <span id="fr_677"></span>[75](#fn_677.md) The fondness of the
emperor was not abated by time and possession; and Eudocia, after the
marriage of her daughter, was permitted to discharge her grateful vows
by a solemn pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Her ostentatious progress through
the East may seem inconsistent with the spirit of Christian humility;
she pronounced, from a throne of gold and gems, an eloquent oration to
the senate of Antioch, declared her royal intention of enlarging the
walls of the city, bestowed a donative of two hundred pounds of gold to
restore the public baths, and accepted the statues, which were decreed
by the gratitude of Antioch. In the Holy Land, her alms and pious
foundations exceeded the munificence of the great Helena, and though the
public treasure might be impoverished by this excessive liberality, she
enjoyed the conscious satisfaction of returning to Constantinople with
the chains of St. Peter, the right arm of St. Stephen, and an undoubted
picture of the Virgin, painted by St. Luke.  <span
id="fr_678"></span>[76](#fn_678.md) But this pilgrimage was the fatal term
of the glories of Eudocia. Satiated with empty pomp, and unmindful,
perhaps, of her obligations to Pulcheria, she ambitiously aspired to the
government of the Eastern empire; the palace was distracted by female
discord; but the victory was at last decided, by the superior ascendant
of the sister of Theodosius. The execution of Paulinus, master of the
offices, and the disgrace of Cyrus, Praetorian praefect of the East,
convinced the public that the favor of Eudocia was insufficient to
protect her most faithful friends; and the uncommon beauty of Paulinus
encouraged the secret rumor, that his guilt was that of a successful
lover.  <span id="fr_679"></span>[77](#fn_679.md) As soon as the empress
perceived that the affection of Theodosius was irretrievably lost, she
requested the permission of retiring to the distant solitude of
Jerusalem. She obtained her request; but the jealousy of Theodosius, or
the vindictive spirit of Pulcheria, pursued her in her last retreat; and
Saturninus, count of the domestics, was directed to punish with death
two ecclesiastics, her most favored servants. Eudocia instantly revenged
them by the assassination of the count; the furious passions which she
indulged on this suspicious occasion, seemed to justify the severity of
Theodosius; and the empress, ignominiously stripped of the honors of her
rank,  <span id="fr_680"></span>[78](#fn_680.md) was disgraced, perhaps
unjustly, in the eyes of the world. The remainder of the life of
Eudocia, about sixteen years, was spent in exile and devotion; and the
approach of age, the death of Theodosius, the misfortunes of her only
daughter, who was led a captive from Rome to Carthage, and the society
of the Holy Monks of Palestine, insensibly confirmed the religious
temper of her mind. After a full experience of the vicissitudes of human
life, the daughter of the philosopher Leontius expired, at Jerusalem, in
the sixty-seventh year of her age; protesting, with her dying breath,
that she had never transgressed the bounds of innocence and friendship.
 <span id="fr_681"></span>[79](#fn_681.md)

The gentle mind of Theodosius was never inflamed by the ambition of
conquest, or military renown; and the slight alarm of a Persian war
scarcely interrupted the tranquillity of the East. The motives of this
war were just and honorable. In the last year of the reign of Jezdegerd,
the supposed guardian of Theodosius, a bishop, who aspired to the crown
of martyrdom, destroyed one of the fire-temples of Susa.  <span
id="fr_682"></span>[80](#fn_682.md) His zeal and obstinacy were revenged on
his brethren: the Magi excited a cruel persecution; and the intolerant
zeal of Jezdegerd was imitated by his son Varanes, or Bahram, who soon
afterwards ascended the throne. Some Christian fugitives, who escaped to
the Roman frontier, were sternly demanded, and generously refused; and
the refusal, aggravated by commercial disputes, soon kindled a war
between the rival monarchies. The mountains of Armenia, and the plains
of Mesopotamia, were filled with hostile armies; but the operations of
two successive campaigns were not productive of any decisive or
memorable events. Some engagements were fought, some towns were
besieged, with various and doubtful success: and if the Romans failed in
their attempt to recover the long-lost possession of Nisibis, the
Persians were repulsed from the walls of a Mesopotamian city, by the
valor of a martial bishop, who pointed his thundering engine in the name
of St. Thomas the Apostle. Yet the splendid victories which the
incredible speed of the messenger Palladius repeatedly announced to the
palace of Constantinople, were celebrated with festivals and panegyrics.
From these panegyrics the historians  <span
id="fr_683"></span>[81](#fn_683.md) of the age might borrow their
extraordinary, and, perhaps, fabulous tales; of the proud challenge of a
Persian hero, who was entangled by the net, and despatched by the sword,
of Areobindus the Goth; of the ten thousand Immortals, who were slain in
the attack of the Roman camp; and of the hundred thousand Arabs, or
Saracens, who were impelled by a panic terror to throw themselves
headlong into the Euphrates. Such events may be disbelieved or
disregarded; but the charity of a bishop, Acacius of Amida, whose name
might have dignified the saintly calendar, shall not be lost in
oblivion. Boldly declaring, that vases of gold and silver are useless to
a God who neither eats nor drinks, the generous prelate sold the plate
of the church of Amida; employed the price in the redemption of seven
thousand Persian captives; supplied their wants with affectionate
liberality; and dismissed them to their native country, to inform their
king of the true spirit of the religion which he persecuted. The
practice of benevolence in the midst of war must always tend to assuage
the animosity of contending nations; and I wish to persuade myself, that
Acacius contributed to the restoration of peace. In the conference which
was held on the limits of the two empires, the Roman ambassadors
degraded the personal character of their sovereign, by a vain attempt to
magnify the extent of his power; when they seriously advised the
Persians to prevent, by a timely accommodation, the wrath of a monarch,
who was yet ignorant of this distant war. A truce of one hundred years
was solemnly ratified; and although the revolutions of Armenia might
threaten the public tranquillity, the essential conditions of this
treaty were respected near fourscore years by the successors of
Constantine and Artaxerxes.

Since the Roman and Parthian standards first encountered on the banks of
the Euphrates, the kingdom of Armenia  <span
id="fr_684"></span>[82](#fn_684.md) was alternately oppressed by its
formidable protectors; and in the course of this History, several
events, which inclined the balance of peace and war, have been already
related. A disgraceful treaty had resigned Armenia to the ambition of
Sapor; and the scale of Persia appeared to preponderate. But the royal
race of Arsaces impatiently submitted to the house of Sassan; the
turbulent nobles asserted, or betrayed, their hereditary independence;
and the nation was still attached to the Christian princes of
Constantinople. In the beginning of the fifth century, Armenia was
divided by the progress of war and faction;  <span
id="fr_685"></span>[83](#fn_685.md) and the unnatural division precipitated
the downfall of that ancient monarchy. Chosroes, the Persian vassal,
reigned over the Eastern and most extensive portion of the country;
while the Western province acknowledged the jurisdiction of Arsaces, and
the supremacy of the emperor Arcadius.  <span
id="fr_686"></span>[\*\_0018](#fn_687.md) After the death of Arsaces, the
Romans suppressed the regal government, and imposed on their allies the
condition of subjects. The military command was delegated to the count
of the Armenian frontier; the city of Theodosiopolis  <span
id="fr_687"></span>[84](#fn_686.md) was built and fortified in a strong
situation, on a fertile and lofty ground, near the sources of the
Euphrates; and the dependent territories were ruled by five satraps,
whose dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple. The
less fortunate nobles, who lamented the loss of their king, and envied
the honors of their equals, were provoked to negotiate their peace and
pardon at the Persian court; and returning, with their followers, to the
palace of Artaxata, acknowledged Chosroes  <span
id="fr_688"></span>[!\_0018](#fn_688.md) for their lawful sovereign. About
thirty years afterwards, Artasires, the nephew and successor of
Chosroes, fell under the displeasure of the haughty and capricious
nobles of Armenia; and they unanimously desired a Persian governor in
the room of an unworthy king. The answer of the archbishop Isaac, whose
sanction they earnestly solicited, is expressive of the character of a
superstitious people. He deplored the manifest and inexcusable vices of
Artasires; and declared, that he should not hesitate to accuse him
before the tribunal of a Christian emperor, who would punish, without
destroying, the sinner. "Our king," continued Isaac, "is too much
addicted to licentious pleasures, but he has been purified in the holy
waters of baptism. He is a lover of women, but he does not adore the
fire or the elements. He may deserve the reproach of lewdness, but he is
an undoubted Catholic; and his faith is pure, though his manners are
flagitious. I will never consent to abandon my sheep to the rage of
devouring wolves; and you would soon repent your rash exchange of the
infirmities of a believer, for the specious virtues of a heathen."
 <span id="fr_689"></span>[85](#fn_689.md) Exasperated by the firmness of
Isaac, the factious nobles accused both the king and the archbishop as
the secret adherents of the emperor; and absurdly rejoiced in the
sentence of condemnation, which, after a partial hearing, was solemnly
pronounced by Bahram himself. The descendants of Arsaces were degraded
from the royal dignity,  <span id="fr_690"></span>[86](#fn_690.md) which
they had possessed above five hundred and sixty years;  <span
id="fr_691"></span>[87](#fn_691.md) and the dominions of the unfortunate
Artasires,  <span id="fr_692"></span>[\*\*\_0018](#fn_692.md) under the new
and significant appellation of Persarmenia, were reduced into the form
of a province. This usurpation excited the jealousy of the Roman
government; but the rising disputes were soon terminated by an amicable,
though unequal, partition of the ancient kingdom of Armenia:  <span
id="fr_693"></span>[\*\*\*\_0018](#fn_693.md) and a territorial
acquisition, which Augustus might have despised, reflected some lustre
on the declining empire of the younger Theodosius.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[69](daf03025.htm#fr_671.md) Suidas, (Excerpta, p.
68, in Script. Byzant.) pretends, on the credit of the Nestorians, that
Pulcheria was exasperated against their founder, because he censured her
connection with the beautiful Paulinus, and her incest with her brother
Theodosius.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[70](daf03025.htm#fr_672.md) See Ducange, Famil.
Byzantin. p. 70. Flaccilla, the eldest daughter, either died before
Arcadius, or, if she lived till the year 431, (Marcellin. Chron.,) some
defect of mind or body must have excluded her from the honors of her
rank.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[71](daf03025.htm#fr_673.md) She was admonished,
by repeated dreams, of the place where the relics of the forty martyrs
had been buried. The ground had successively belonged to the house and
garden of a woman of Constantinople, to a monastery of Macedonian monks,
and to a church of St. Thyrsus, erected by Caesarius, who was consul
A.D. 397; and the memory of the relics was almost obliterated.
Notwithstanding the charitable wishes of Dr. Jortin, (Remarks, tom. iv.
p. 234,) it is not easy to acquit Pulcheria of some share in the pious
fraud; which must have been transacted when she was more than
five-and-thirty years of age.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[72](daf03025.htm#fr_674.md) There is a remarkable
difference between the two ecclesiastical historians, who in general
bear so close a resemblance. Sozomen (l. ix. c. 1) ascribes to Pulcheria
the government of the empire, and the education of her brother, whom he
scarcely condescends to praise. Socrates, though he affectedly disclaims
all hopes of favor or fame, composes an elaborate panegyric on the
emperor, and cautiously suppresses the merits of his sister, (l. vii. c.
22, 42.) Philostorgius (l. xii. c. 7) expresses the influence of
Pulcheria in gentle and courtly language. Suidas (Excerpt. p. 53) gives
a true character of Theodosius; and I have followed the example of
Tillemont (tom. vi. p. 25) in borrowing some strokes from the modern
Greeks.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[73](daf03025.htm#fr_675.md) Theodoret, l. v. c.
37. The bishop of Cyrrhus, one of the first men of his age for his
learning and piety, applauds the obedience of Theodosius to the divine
laws.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[74](daf03025.htm#fr_676.md) Socrates (l. vii. c.
21) mentions her name, (Athenais, the daughter of Leontius, an Athenian
sophist,) her baptism, marriage, and poetical genius. The most ancient
account of her history is in John Malala (part ii. p. 20, 21, edit.
Venet. 1743) and in the Paschal Chronicle, (p. 311, 312.) Those authors
had probably seen original pictures of the empress Eudocia. The modern
Greeks, Zonaras, Cedrenus, &c., have displayed the love, rather than the
talent of fiction. From Nicephorus, indeed, I have ventured to assume
her age. The writer of a romance would not have imagined, that Athenais
was near twenty eight years old when she inflamed the heart of a young
emperor.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[75](daf03025.htm#fr_677.md) Socrates, l. vii. c.
21, Photius, p. 413 - 420. The Homeric cento is still extant, and has
been repeatedly printed: but the claim of Eudocia to that insipid
performance is disputed by the critics. See Fabricius, Biblioth. Graec.
tom. i. p. 357. The Ionia, a miscellaneous dictionary of history and
fable, was compiled by another empress of the name of Eudocia, who lived
in the eleventh century: and the work is still extant in manuscript.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[76](daf03025.htm#fr_678.md) Baronius (Annal.
Eccles. A.D. 438, 439) is copious and florid, but he is accused of
placing the lies of different ages on the same level of authenticity.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[77](daf03025.htm#fr_679.md) In this short view of
the disgrace of Eudocia, I have imitated the caution of Evagrius (l. i.
c. 21) and Count Marcellinus, (in Chron A.D. 440 and 444.) The two
authentic dates assigned by the latter, overturn a great part of the
Greek fictions; and the celebrated story of the apple, &c., is fit only
for the Arabian Nights, where something not very unlike it may be found.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[78](daf03025.htm#fr_680.md) Priscus, (in Excerpt.
Legat. p. 69,) a contemporary, and a courtier, dryly mentions her Pagan
and Christian names, without adding any title of honor or respect.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[79](daf03025.htm#fr_681.md) For the two
pilgrimages of Eudocia, and her long residence at Jerusalem, her
devotion, alms, &c., see Socrates (l. vii. c. 47) and Evagrius, (l. i.
c. 21, 22.) The Paschal Chronicle may sometimes deserve regard; and in
the domestic history of Antioch, John Malala becomes a writer of good
authority. The Abbe Guenee, in a memoir on the fertility of Palestine,
of which I have only seen an extract, calculates the gifts of Eudocia at
20,488 pounds of gold, above 800,000 pounds sterling.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[80](daf03025.htm#fr_682.md) Theodoret, l. v. c.
39 Tillemont. Mem. Eccles tom. xii. 356 - 364. Assemanni, Bibliot.
Oriental. tom. iii. p. 396, tom. iv. p. 61. Theodoret blames the
rashness of Abdas, but extols the constancy of his martyrdom. Yet I do
not clearly understand the casuistry which prohibits our repairing the
damage which we have unlawfully committed.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[81](daf03025.htm#fr_683.md) Socrates (l. vii. c.
18, 19, 20, 21) is the best author for the Persian war. We may likewise
consult the three Chronicles, the Paschal and those of Marcellinus and
Malala.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[82](daf03025.htm#fr_684.md) This account of the
ruin and division of the kingdom of Armenia is taken from the third book
of the Armenian history of Moses of Chorene. Deficient as he is in every
qualification of a good historian, his local information, his passions,
and his prejudices are strongly expressive of a native and contemporary.
Procopius (de Edificiis, l. iii. c. 1, 5) relates the same facts in a
very different manner; but I have extracted the circumstances the most
probable in themselves, and the least inconsistent with Moses of
Chorene.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[83](daf03025.htm#fr_685.md) The western Armenians
used the Greek language and characters in their religious offices; but
the use of that hostile tongue was prohibited by the Persians in the
Eastern provinces, which were obliged to use the Syriac, till the
invention of the Armenian letters by Mesrobes, in the beginning of the
fifth century, and the subsequent version of the Bible into the Armenian
language; an event which relaxed to the connection of the church and
nation with Constantinople.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[84](daf03025.htm#fr_687.md) Moses Choren. l. iii.
c. 59, p. 309, and p. 358. Procopius, de Edificiis, l. iii. c. 5.
Theodosiopolis stands, or rather stood, about thirty-five miles to the
east of Arzeroum, the modern capital of Turkish Armenia. See D'Anville,
Geographie Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 99, 100.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[\*\_0018](daf03025.htm#fr_686.md) The division of
Armenia, according to M. St. Martin, took place much earlier, A. C. 390.
The Eastern or Persian division was four times as large as the Western
or Roman. This partition took place during the reigns of Theodosius the
First, and Varanes (Bahram) the Fourth. St. Martin, Sup. to Le Beau, iv.
429. This partition was but imperfectly accomplished, as both parts were
afterwards reunited under Chosroes, who paid tribute both to the Roman
emperor and to the Persian king. v. 439. - M.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[!\_0018](daf03025.htm#fr_688.md) Chosroes,
according to Procopius (who calls him Arsaces, the common name of the
Armenian kings) and the Armenian writers, bequeathed to his two sons, to
Tigranes the Persian, to Arsaces the Roman, division of Armenia, A. C.
416. With the assistance of the discontented nobles the Persian king
placed his son Sapor on the throne of the Eastern division; the Western
at the same time was united to the Roman empire, and called the Greater
Armenia. It was then that Theodosiopolis was built. Sapor abandoned the
throne of Armenia to assert his rights to that of Persia; he perished in
the struggle, and after a period of anarchy, Bahram V., who had ascended
the throne of Persia, placed the last native prince, Ardaschir, son of
Bahram Schahpour, on the throne of the Persian division of Armenia. St.
Martin, v. 506. This Ardaschir was the Artasires of Gibbon. The
archbishop Isaac is called by the Armenians the Patriarch Schag. St.
Martin, vi. 29. - M.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[85](daf03025.htm#fr_689.md) Moses Choren, l. iii.
c. 63, p. 316. According to the institution of St. Gregory, the Apostle
of Armenia, the archbishop was always of the royal family; a
circumstance which, in some degree, corrected the influence of the
sacerdotal character, and united the mitre with the crown.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[86](daf03025.htm#fr_690.md) A branch of the royal
house of Arsaces still subsisted with the rank and possessions (as it
should seem) of Armenian satraps. See Moses Choren. l. iii. c. 65, p.
321.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[87](daf03025.htm#fr_691.md) Valarsaces was
appointed king of Armenia by his brother the Parthian monarch,
immediately after the defeat of Antiochus Sidetes, (Moses Choren. l. ii.
c. 2, p. 85,) one hundred and thirty years before Christ. Without
depending on the various and contradictory periods of the reigns of the
last kings, we may be assured, that the ruin of the Armenian kingdom
happened after the council of Chalcedon, A.D. 431, (l. iii. c. 61, p.
312;) and under Varamus, or Bahram, king of Persia, (l. iii. c. 64, p.
317,) who reigned from A.D. 420 to 440. See Assemanni, Bibliot.
Oriental. tom. iii. p. 396.

Note: Five hundred and eighty. St. Martin, ibid. He places this event A.
C 429. - M.

Note: According to M. St. Martin, vi. 32, Vagharschah, or Valarsaces,
was appointed king by his brother Mithridates the Great, king of
Parthia. - M.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[\*\*\_0018](daf03025.htm#fr_692.md) Artasires or
Ardaschir was probably sent to the castle of Oblivion. St. Martin, vi.
31. - M.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[\*\*\*\_0018](daf03025.htm#fr_693.md) The
duration of the Armenian kingdom according to M. St. Martin, was 580
years. - M
