### Chapter XXVIII: Destruction Of Paganism. Part I.

Final Destruction Of Paganism. - Introduction Of The Worship Of Saints,
And Relics, Among The Christians.

The ruin of Paganism, in the age of Theodosius, is perhaps the only
example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular
superstition; and may therefore deserve to be considered as a singular
event in the history of the human mind. The Christians, more especially
the clergy, had impatiently supported the prudent delays of Constantine,
and the equal toleration of the elder Valentinian; nor could they deem
their conquest perfect or secure, as long as their adversaries were
permitted to exist. The influence which Ambrose and his brethren had
acquired over the youth of Gratian, and the piety of Theodosius, was
employed to infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of their
Imperial proselytes. Two specious principles of religious jurisprudence
were established, from whence they deduced a direct and rigorous
conclusion, against the subjects of the empire who still adhered to the
ceremonies of their ancestors: that the magistrate is, in some measure,
guilty of the crimes which he neglects to prohibit, or to punish; and,
that the idolatrous worship of fabulous deities, and real daemons, is
the most abominable crime against the supreme majesty of the Creator.
The laws of Moses, and the examples of Jewish history,  <span
id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md) were hastily, perhaps erroneously,
applied, by the clergy, to the mild and universal reign of Christianity.
 <span id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_130.md) The zeal of the emperors was
excited to vindicate their own honor, and that of the Deity: and the
temples of the Roman world were subverted, about sixty years after the
conversion of Constantine.

From the age of Numa to the reign of Gratian, the Romans preserved the
regular succession of the several colleges of the sacerdotal order.
 <span id="fr_131"></span>[3](#fn_131.md) Fifteen Pontiffs exercised their
supreme jurisdiction over all things, and persons, that were consecrated
to the service of the gods; and the various questions which perpetually
arose in a loose and traditionary system, were submitted to the judgment
of their holy tribunal Fifteen grave and learned Augurs observed the
face of the heavens, and prescribed the actions of heroes, according to
the flight of birds. Fifteen keepers of the Sibylline books (their name
of Quindecemvirs was derived from their number) occasionally consulted
the history of future, and, as it should seem, of contingent, events.
Six Vestals devoted their virginity to the guard of the sacred fire, and
of the unknown pledges of the duration of Rome; which no mortal had been
suffered to behold with impunity.  <span id="fr_132"></span>[4](#fn_132.md)
Seven Epulos prepared the table of the gods, conducted the solemn
procession, and regulated the ceremonies of the annual festival. The
three Flamens of Jupiter, of Mars, and of Quirinus, were considered as
the peculiar ministers of the three most powerful deities, who watched
over the fate of Rome and of the universe. The King of the Sacrifices
represented the person of Numa, and of his successors, in the religious
functions, which could be performed only by royal hands. The
confraternities of the Salians, the Lupercals, &c., practised such rites
as might extort a smile of contempt from every reasonable man, with a
lively confidence of recommending themselves to the favor of the
immortal gods. The authority, which the Roman priests had formerly
obtained in the counsels of the republic, was gradually abolished by the
establishment of monarchy, and the removal of the seat of empire. But
the dignity of their sacred character was still protected by the laws,
and manners of their country; and they still continued, more especially
the college of pontiffs, to exercise in the capital, and sometimes in
the provinces, the rights of their ecclesiastical and civil
jurisdiction. Their robes of purple, chariotz of state, and sumptuous
entertainments, attracted the admiration of the people; and they
received, from the consecrated lands, and the public revenue, an ample
stipend, which liberally supported the splendor of the priesthood, and
all the expenses of the religious worship of the state. As the service
of the altar was not incompatible with the command of armies, the
Romans, after their consulships and triumphs, aspired to the place of
pontiff, or of augur; the seats of Cicero  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[5](#fn_133.md) and Pompey were filled, in the fourth
century, by the most illustrious members of the senate; and the dignity
of their birth reflected additional splendor on their sacerdotal
character. The fifteen priests, who composed the college of pontiffs,
enjoyed a more distinguished rank as the companions of their sovereign;
and the Christian emperors condescended to accept the robe and ensigns,
which were appropriated to the office of supreme pontiff. But when
Gratian ascended the throne, more scrupulous or more enlightened, he
sternly rejected those profane symbols;  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[6](#fn_134.md) applied to the service of the state, or
of the church, the revenues of the priests and vestals; abolished their
honors and immunities; and dissolved the ancient fabric of Roman
superstition, which was supported by the opinions and habits of eleven
hundred years. Paganism was still the constitutional religion of the
senate. The hall, or temple, in which they assembled, was adorned by the
statue and altar of Victory;  <span id="fr_135"></span>[7](#fn_135.md) a
majestic female standing on a globe, with flowing garments, expanded
wings, and a crown of laurel in her outstretched hand.  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[8](#fn_136.md) The senators were sworn on the altar of
the goddess to observe the laws of the emperor and of the empire: and a
solemn offering of wine and incense was the ordinary prelude of their
public deliberations. <span id="fr_137"></span>[9](#fn_137.md) The removal
of this ancient monument was the only injury which Constantius had
offered to the superstition of the Romans. The altar of Victory was
again restored by Julian, tolerated by Valentinian, and once more
banished from the senate by the zeal of Gratian.  <span
id="fr_138"></span>[10](#fn_138.md) But the emperor yet spared the statues
of the gods which were exposed to the public veneration: four hundred
and twenty-four temples, or chapels, still remained to satisfy the
devotion of the people; and in every quarter of Rome the delicacy of the
Christians was offended by the fumes of idolatrous sacrifice.  <span
id="fr_139"></span>[11](#fn_139.md)

But the Christians formed the least numerous party in the senate of
Rome:  <span id="fr_140"></span>[12](#fn_140.md) and it was only by their
absence, that they could express their dissent from the legal, though
profane, acts of a Pagan majority. In that assembly, the dying embers of
freedom were, for a moment, revived and inflamed by the breath of
fanaticism. Four respectable deputations were successively voted to the
Imperial court,  <span id="fr_141"></span>[13](#fn_141.md) to represent the
grievances of the priesthood and the senate, and to solicit the
restoration of the altar of Victory. The conduct of this important
business was intrusted to the eloquent Symmachus,  <span
id="fr_142"></span>[14](#fn_142.md) a wealthy and noble senator, who united
the sacred characters of pontiff and augur with the civil dignities of
proconsul of Africa and praefect of the city. The breast of Symmachus
was animated by the warmest zeal for the cause of expiring Paganism; and
his religious antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius, and the
inefficacy of his moral virtues.  <span id="fr_143"></span>[15](#fn_143.md)
The orator, whose petition is extant to the emperor Valentinian, was
conscious of the difficulty and danger of the office which he had
assumed. He cautiously avoids every topic which might appear to reflect
on the religion of his sovereign; humbly declares, that prayers and
entreaties are his only arms; and artfully draws his arguments from the
schools of rhetoric, rather than from those of philosophy. Symmachus
endeavors to seduce the imagination of a young prince, by displaying the
attributes of the goddess of victory; he insinuates, that the
confiscation of the revenues, which were consecrated to the service of
the gods, was a measure unworthy of his liberal and disinterested
character; and he maintains, that the Roman sacrifices would be deprived
of their force and energy, if they were no longer celebrated at the
expense, as well as in the name, of the republic. Even scepticism is
made to supply an apology for superstition. The great and
incomprehensible secret of the universe eludes the inquiry of man. Where
reason cannot instruct, custom may be permitted to guide; and every
nation seems to consult the dictates of prudence, by a faithful
attachment to those rites and opinions, which have received the sanction
of ages. If those ages have been crowned with glory and prosperity, if
the devout people have frequently obtained the blessings which they have
solicited at the altars of the gods, it must appear still more advisable
to persist in the same salutary practice; and not to risk the unknown
perils that may attend any rash innovations. The test of antiquity and
success was applied with singular advantage to the religion of Numa; and
Rome herself, the celestial genius that presided over the fates of the
city, is introduced by the orator to plead her own cause before the
tribunal of the emperors. "Most excellent princes," says the venerable
matron, "fathers of your country! pity and respect my age, which has
hitherto flowed in an uninterrupted course of piety. Since I do not
repent, permit me to continue in the practice of my ancient rites. Since
I am born free, allow me to enjoy my domestic institutions. This
religion has reduced the world under my laws. These rites have repelled
Hannibal from the city, and the Gauls from the Capitol. Were my gray
hairs reserved for such intolerable disgrace? I am ignorant of the new
system that I am required to adopt; but I am well assured, that the
correction of old age is always an ungrateful and ignominious office."
 <span id="fr_144"></span>[16](#fn_144.md) The fears of the people supplied
what the discretion of the orator had suppressed; and the calamities,
which afflicted, or threatened, the declining empire, were unanimously
imputed, by the Pagans, to the new religion of Christ and of
Constantine.

But the hopes of Symmachus were repeatedly baffled by the firm and
dexterous opposition of the archbishop of Milan, who fortified the
emperors against the fallacious eloquence of the advocate of Rome. In
this controversy, Ambrose condescends to speak the language of a
philosopher, and to ask, with some contempt, why it should be thought
necessary to introduce an imaginary and invisible power, as the cause of
those victories, which were sufficiently explained by the valor and
discipline of the legions. He justly derides the absurd reverence for
antiquity, which could only tend to discourage the improvements of art,
and to replunge the human race into their original barbarism. From
thence, gradually rising to a more lofty and theological tone, he
pronounces, that Christianity alone is the doctrine of truth and
salvation; and that every mode of Polytheism conducts its deluded
votaries, through the paths of error, to the abyss of eternal perdition.
 <span id="fr_145"></span>[17](#fn_145.md) Arguments like these, when they
were suggested by a favorite bishop, had power to prevent the
restoration of the altar of Victory; but the same arguments fell, with
much more energy and effect, from the mouth of a conqueror; and the gods
of antiquity were dragged in triumph at the chariot-wheels of
Theodosius.  <span id="fr_146"></span>[18](#fn_146.md) In a full meeting of
the senate, the emperor proposed, according to the forms of the
republic, the important question, Whether the worship of Jupiter, or
that of Christ, should be the religion of the Romans.  <span
id="fr_147"></span>[\*\_0005](#fn_147.md) The liberty of suffrages, which
he affected to allow, was destroyed by the hopes and fears that his
presence inspired; and the arbitrary exile of Symmachus was a recent
admonition, that it might be dangerous to oppose the wishes of the
monarch. On a regular division of the senate, Jupiter was condemned and
degraded by the sense of a very large majority; and it is rather
surprising, that any members should be found bold enough to declare, by
their speeches and votes, that they were still attached to the interest
of an abdicated deity.  <span id="fr_148"></span>[19](#fn_148.md) The hasty
conversion of the senate must be attributed either to supernatural or to
sordid motives; and many of these reluctant proselytes betrayed, on
every favorable occasion, their secret disposition to throw aside the
mask of odious dissimulation. But they were gradually fixed in the new
religion, as the cause of the ancient became more hopeless; they yielded
to the authority of the emperor, to the fashion of the times, and to the
entreaties of their wives and children,  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[20](#fn_149.md) who were instigated and governed by the
clergy of Rome and the monks of the East. The edifying example of the
Anician family was soon imitated by the rest of the nobility: the Bassi,
the Paullini, the Gracchi, embraced the Christian religion; and "the
luminaries of the world, the venerable assembly of Catos (such are the
high-flown expressions of Prudentius) were impatient to strip themselves
of their pontifical garment; to cast the skin of the old serpent; to
assume the snowy robes of baptismal innocence, and to humble the pride
of the consular fasces before tombs of the martyrs."  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[21](#fn_150.md) The citizens, who subsisted by their
own industry, and the populace, who were supported by the public
liberality, filled the churches of the Lateran, and Vatican, with an
incessant throng of devout proselytes. The decrees of the senate, which
proscribed the worship of idols, were ratified by the general consent of
the Romans;  <span id="fr_151"></span>[22](#fn_151.md) the splendor of the
Capitol was defaced, and the solitary temples were abandoned to ruin and
contempt.  <span id="fr_152"></span>[23](#fn_152.md) Rome submitted to the
yoke of the Gospel; and the vanquished provinces had not yet lost their
reverence for the name and authority of Rome.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_129"></span>[1](daf03006.htm#fr_129.md) St. Ambrose (tom. ii.
de Obit. Theodos. p. 1208) expressly praises and recommends the zeal of
Josiah in the destruction of idolatry The language of Julius Firmicus
Maternus on the same subject (de Errore Profan. Relig. p. 467, edit.
Gronov.) is piously inhuman. Nec filio jubet (the Mosaic Law) parci, nec
fratri, et per amatam conjugera gladium vindicem ducit, &c.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[2](daf03006.htm#fr_130.md) Bayle (tom. ii. p.
406, in his Commentaire Philosophique) justifies, and limits, these
intolerant laws by the temporal reign of Jehovah over the Jews. The
attempt is laudable.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[3](daf03006.htm#fr_131.md) See the outlines of
the Roman hierarchy in Cicero, (de Legibus, ii. 7, 8,) Livy, (i. 20,)
Dionysius Halicarnassensis, (l. ii. p. 119 - 129, edit. Hudson,)
Beaufort, (Republique Romaine, tom. i. p. 1 - 90,) and Moyle, (vol. i.
p. 10 - 55.) The last is the work of an English whig, as well as of a
Roman antiquary.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[4](daf03006.htm#fr_132.md) These mystic, and
perhaps imaginary, symbols have given birth to various fables and
conjectures. It seems probable, that the Palladium was a small statue
(three cubits and a half high) of Minerva, with a lance and distaff;
that it was usually enclosed in a seria, or barrel; and that a similar
barrel was placed by its side to disconcert curiosity, or sacrilege. See
Mezeriac (Comment. sur les Epitres d'Ovide, tom i. p. 60 - 66) and
Lipsius, (tom. iii. p. 610 de Vesta, &c. c 10.)

<span id="fn_133"></span>[5](daf03006.htm#fr_133.md) Cicero frankly (ad
Atticum, l. ii. Epist. 5) or indirectly (ad Familiar. l. xv. Epist. 4)
confesses that the Augurate is the supreme object of his wishes. Pliny
is proud to tread in the footsteps of Cicero, (l. iv. Epist. 8,) and the
chain of tradition might be continued from history and marbles.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[6](daf03006.htm#fr_134.md) Zosimus, l. iv. p.
249, 250. I have suppressed the foolish pun about Pontifex and Maximus.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[7](daf03006.htm#fr_135.md) This statue was
transported from Tarentum to Rome, placed in the Curia Julia by Caesar,
and decorated by Augustus with the spoils of Egypt.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[8](daf03006.htm#fr_136.md) Prudentius (l. ii. in
initio) has drawn a very awkward portrait of Victory; but the curious
reader will obtain more satisfaction from Montfaucon's Antiquities,
(tom. i. p. 341.)

<span id="fn_137"></span>[9](daf03006.htm#fr_137.md) See Suetonius (in
August. c. 35) and the Exordium of Pliny's Panegyric.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[10](daf03006.htm#fr_138.md) These facts are
mutually allowed by the two advocates, Symmachus and Ambrose.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[11](daf03006.htm#fr_139.md) The Notitia Urbis,
more recent than Constantine, does not find one Christian church worthy
to be named among the edifices of the city. Ambrose (tom. ii. Epist.
xvii. p. 825) deplores the public scandals of Rome, which continually
offended the eyes, the ears, and the nostrils of the faithful.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[12](daf03006.htm#fr_140.md) Ambrose repeatedly
affirms, in contradiction to common sense (Moyle's Works, vol. ii. p.
147,) that the Christians had a majority in the senate.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[13](daf03006.htm#fr_141) The first (A.D. 382.md)
to Gratian, who refused them audience; the second (A.D. 384) to
Valentinian, when the field was disputed by Symmachus and Ambrose; the
third (A.D. 388) to Theodosius; and the fourth (A.D. 392) to
Valentinian. Lardner (Heathen Testimonies, vol. iv. p. 372 - 399) fairly
represents the whole transaction.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[14](daf03006.htm#fr_142.md) Symmachus, who was
invested with all the civil and sacerdotal honors, represented the
emperor under the two characters of Pontifex Maximus, and Princeps
Senatus. See the proud inscription at the head of his works.

Note: Mr. Beugnot has made it doubtful whether Symmachus was more than
Pontifex Major. Destruction du Paganisme, vol. i. p. 459. - M.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[15](daf03006.htm#fr_143.md) As if any one, says
Prudentius (in Symmach. i. 639) should dig in the mud with an instrument
of gold and ivory. Even saints, and polemic saints, treat this adversary
with respect and civility.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[16](daf03006.htm#fr_144.md) See the fifty-fourth
Epistle of the tenth book of Symmachus. In the form and disposition of
his ten books of Epistles, he imitated the younger Pliny; whose rich and
florid style he was supposed, by his friends, to equal or excel,
(Macrob. Saturnal. l. v. c. i.) But the luxcriancy of Symmachus consists
of barren leaves, without fruits, and even without flowers. Few facts,
and few sentiments, can be extracted from his verbose correspondence.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[17](daf03006.htm#fr_145.md) See Ambrose, (tom.
ii. Epist. xvii. xviii. p. 825 - 833.) The former of these epistles is a
short caution; the latter is a formal reply of the petition or libel of
Symmachus. The same ideas are more copiously expressed in the poetry, if
it may deserve that name, of Prudentius; who composed his two books
against Symmachus (A.D. 404) while that senator was still alive. It is
whimsical enough that Montesquieu (Considerations, &c. c. xix. tom. iii.
p. 487) should overlook the two professed antagonists of Symmachus, and
amuse himself with descanting on the more remote and indirect
confutations of Orosius, St. Augustin, and Salvian.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[18](daf03006.htm#fr_146.md) See Prudentius (in
Symmach. l. i. 545, &c.) The Christian agrees with the Pagan Zosimus (l.
iv. p. 283) in placing this visit of Theodosius after the second civil
war, gemini bis victor caede Tyranni, (l. i. 410.) But the time and
circumstances are better suited to his first triumph.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[\*\_0005](daf03006.htm#fr_147.md) M. Beugnot (in
his Histoire de la Destruction du Paganisme en Occident, i. p. 483 -
488) questions, altogether, the truth of this statement. It is very
remarkable that Zosimus and Prudentius concur in asserting the fact of
the question being solemnly deliberated by the senate, though with
directly opposite results. Zosimus declares that the majority of the
assembly adhered to the ancient religion of Rome; Gibbon has adopted the
authority of Prudentius, who, as a Latin writer, though a poet, deserves
more credit than the Greek historian. Both concur in placing this scene
after the second triumph of Theodosius; but it has been almost
demonstrated (and Gibbon - see the preceding note - seems to have
acknowledged this) by Pagi and Tillemont, that Theodosius did not visit
Rome after the defeat of Eugenius. M. Beugnot urges, with much force,
the improbability that the Christian emperor would submit such a
question to the senate, whose authority was nearly obsolete, except on
one occasion, which was almost hailed as an epoch in the restoration of
her ancient privileges. The silence of Ambrose and of Jerom on an event
so striking, and redounding so much to the honor of Christianity, is of
considerable weight. M. Beugnot would ascribe the whole scene to the
poetic imagination of Prudentius; but I must observe, that, however
Prudentius is sometimes elevated by the grandeur of his subject to vivid
and eloquent language, this flight of invention would be so much bolder
and more vigorous than usual with this poet, that I cannot but suppose
there must have been some foundation for the story, though it may have
been exaggerated by the poet, or misrepresented by the historian. - M

<span id="fn_148"></span>[19](daf03006.htm#fr_148.md) Prudentius, after
proving that the sense of the senate is declared by a legal majority,
proceeds to say, (609, &c.) - Adspice quam pleno subsellia nostra Senatu
Decernant infame Jovis pulvinar, et omne Idolum longe purgata ex urbe
fugandum, Qua vocat egregii sententia Principis, illuc Libera, cum
pedibus, tum corde, frequentia transit.

Zosimus ascribes to the conscript feathers a heathenish courage, which
few of them are found to possess.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[20](daf03006.htm#fr_149.md) Jerom specifies the
pontiff Albinus, who was surrounded with such a believing family of
children and grandchildren, as would have been sufficient to convert
even Jupiter himself; an extraordinary proselyted (tom. i. ad Laetam, p.
54.)

<span id="fn_150"></span>[21](daf03006.htm#fr_150.md) Exultare Patres
videas, pulcherrima mundi Lumina; Conciliumque senum gestire Catonum
Candidiore toga niveum pietatis amictum Sumere; et exuvias deponere
pontificales.

The fancy of Prudentius is warmed and elevated by victory

<span id="fn_151"></span>[22](daf03006.htm#fr_151.md) Prudentius, after he
has described the conversion of the senate and people, asks, with some
truth and confidence, Et dubitamus adhuc Romam, tibi, Christe, dicatam
In leges transisse tuas?

<span id="fn_152"></span>[23](daf03006.htm#fr_152.md) Jerom exults in the
desolation of the Capitol, and the other temples of Rome, (tom. i. p.
54, tom. ii. p. 95.)

<span id="fn_153"></span>[\*\*\_0005](daf03006.htm#fr_153.md) M. Beugnot is
more correct in his general estimate of the measures enforced by
Theodosius for the abolition of Paganism. He seized (according to
Zosimus) the funds bestowed by the public for the expense of sacrifices.
The public sacrifices ceased, not because they were positively
prohibited, but because the public treasury would no longer bear the
expense. The public and the private sacrifices in the provinces, which
were not under the same regulations with those of the capital, continued
to take place. In Rome itself, many pagan ceremonies, which were without
sacrifice, remained in full force. The gods, therefore, were invoked,
the temples were frequented, the pontificates inscribed, according to
ancient usage, among the family titles of honor; and it cannot be
asserted that idolatry was completely destroyed by Theodosius. See
Beugnot, p. 491. - M.
