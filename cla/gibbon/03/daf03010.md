### Chapter XXIX: Division Of Roman Empire Between Sons Of Theodosius. Part II.

The impartiality which Stilicho affected, as the common guardian of the
royal brothers, engaged him to regulate the equal division of the arms,
the jewels, and the magnificent wardrobe and furniture of the deceased
emperor.  <span id="fr_253"></span>[28](#fn_253.md) But the most important
object of the inheritance consisted of the numerous legions, cohorts,
and squadrons, of Romans, or Barbarians, whom the event of the civil war
had united under the standard of Theodosius. The various multitudes of
Europe and Asia, exasperated by recent animosities, were overawed by the
authority of a single man; and the rigid discipline of Stilicho
protected the lands of the citizens from the rapine of the licentious
soldier.  <span id="fr_254"></span>[29](#fn_254.md) Anxious, however, and
impatient, to relieve Italy from the presence of this formidable host,
which could be useful only on the frontiers of the empire, he listened
to the just requisition of the minister of Arcadius, declared his
intention of reconducting in person the troops of the East, and
dexterously employed the rumor of a Gothic tumult to conceal his private
designs of ambition and revenge.  <span id="fr_255"></span>[30](#fn_255.md)
The guilty soul of Rufinus was alarmed by the approach of a warrior and
a rival, whose enmity he deserved; he computed, with increasing terror,
the narrow space of his life and greatness; and, as the last hope of
safety, he interposed the authority of the emperor Arcadius. Stilicho,
who appears to have directed his march along the sea-coast of the
Adriatic, was not far distant from the city of Thessalonica, when he
received a peremptory message, to recall the troops of the East, and to
declare, that his nearer approach would be considered, by the Byzantine
court, as an act of hostility. The prompt and unexpected obedience of
the general of the West, convinced the vulgar of his loyalty and
moderation; and, as he had already engaged the affection of the Eastern
troops, he recommended to their zeal the execution of his bloody design,
which might be accomplished in his absence, with less danger, perhaps,
and with less reproach. Stilicho left the command of the troops of the
East to Gainas, the Goth, on whose fidelity he firmly relied, with an
assurance, at least, that the hardy Barbarians would never be diverted
from his purpose by any consideration of fear or remorse. The soldiers
were easily persuaded to punish the enemy of Stilicho and of Rome; and
such was the general hatred which Rufinus had excited, that the fatal
secret, communicated to thousands, was faithfully preserved during the
long march from Thessalonica to the gates of Constantinople. As soon as
they had resolved his death, they condescended to flatter his pride; the
ambitious praefect was seduced to believe, that those powerful
auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head; and the
treasures which he distributed, with a tardy and reluctant hand, were
accepted by the indignant multitude as an insult, rather than as a gift.
At the distance of a mile from the capital, in the field of Mars, before
the palace of Hebdomon, the troops halted: and the emperor, as well as
his minister, advanced, according to ancient custom, respectfully to
salute the power which supported their throne. As Rufinus passed along
the ranks, and disguised, with studied courtesy, his innate haughtiness,
the wings insensibly wheeled from the right and left, and enclosed the
devoted victim within the circle of their arms. Before he could reflect
on the danger of his situation, Gainas gave the signal of death; a
daring and forward soldier plunged his sword into the breast of the
guilty praefect, and Rufinus fell, groaned, and expired, at the feet of
the affrighted emperor. If the agonies of a moment could expiate the
crimes of a whole life, or if the outrages inflicted on a breathless
corpse could be the object of pity, our humanity might perhaps be
affected by the horrid circumstances which accompanied the murder of
Rufinus. His mangled body was abandoned to the brutal fury of the
populace of either sex, who hastened in crowds, from every quarter of
the city, to trample on the remains of the haughty minister, at whose
frown they had so lately trembled. His right hand was cut off, and
carried through the streets of Constantinople, in cruel mockery, to
extort contributions for the avaricious tyrant, whose head was publicly
exposed, borne aloft on the point of a long lance.  <span
id="fr_256"></span>[31](#fn_256.md) According to the savage maxims of the
Greek republics, his innocent family would have shared the punishment of
his crimes. The wife and daughter of Rufinus were indebted for their
safety to the influence of religion. Her sanctuary protected them from
the raging madness of the people; and they were permitted to spend the
remainder of their lives in the exercise of Christian devotions, in the
peaceful retirement of Jerusalem.  <span
id="fr_257"></span>[32](#fn_257.md)

The servile poet of Stilicho applauds, with ferocious joy, this horrid
deed, which, in the execution, perhaps, of justice, violated every law
of nature and society, profaned the majesty of the prince, and renewed
the dangerous examples of military license. The contemplation of the
universal order and harmony had satisfied Claudian of the existence of
the Deity; but the prosperous impunity of vice appeared to contradict
his moral attributes; and the fate of Rufinus was the only event which
could dispel the religious doubts of the poet.  <span
id="fr_258"></span>[33](#fn_258.md) Such an act might vindicate the honor
of Providence, but it did not much contribute to the happiness of the
people. In less than three months they were informed of the maxims of
the new administration, by a singular edict, which established the
exclusive right of the treasury over the spoils of Rufinus; and
silenced, under heavy penalties, the presumptuous claims of the subjects
of the Eastern empire, who had been injured by his rapacious tyranny.
 <span id="fr_259"></span>[34](#fn_259.md) Even Stilicho did not derive
from the murder of his rival the fruit which he had proposed; and though
he gratified his revenge, his ambition was disappointed. Under the name
of a favorite, the weakness of Arcadius required a master, but he
naturally preferred the obsequious arts of the eunuch Eutropius, who had
obtained his domestic confidence: and the emperor contemplated, with
terror and aversion, the stern genius of a foreign warrior. Till they
were divided by the jealousy of power, the sword of Gainas, and the
charms of Eudoxia, supported the favor of the great chamberlain of the
palace: the perfidious Goth, who was appointed master-general of the
East, betrayed, without scruple, the interest of his benefactor; and the
same troops, who had so lately massacred the enemy of Stilicho, were
engaged to support, against him, the independence of the throne of
Constantinople. The favorites of Arcadius fomented a secret and
irreconcilable war against a formidable hero, who aspired to govern, and
to defend, the two empires of Rome, and the two sons of Theodosius. They
incessantly labored, by dark and treacherous machinations, to deprive
him of the esteem of the prince, the respect of the people, and the
friendship of the Barbarians. The life of Stilicho was repeatedly
attempted by the dagger of hired assassins; and a decree was obtained
from the senate of Constantinople, to declare him an enemy of the
republic, and to confiscate his ample possessions in the provinces of
the East. At a time when the only hope of delaying the ruin of the Roman
name depended on the firm union, and reciprocal aid, of all the nations
to whom it had been gradually communicated, the subjects of Arcadius and
Honorius were instructed, by their respective masters, to view each
other in a foreign, and even hostile, light; to rejoice in their mutual
calamities, and to embrace, as their faithful allies, the Barbarians,
whom they excited to invade the territories of their countrymen.  <span
id="fr_260"></span>[35](#fn_260.md) The natives of Italy affected to
despise the servile and effeminate Greeks of Byzantium, who presumed to
imitate the dress, and to usurp the dignity, of Roman senators;  <span
id="fr_261"></span>[36](#fn_261.md) and the Greeks had not yet forgot the
sentiments of hatred and contempt, which their polished ancestors had so
long entertained for the rude inhabitants of the West. The distinction
of two governments, which soon produced the separation of two nations,
will justify my design of suspending the series of the Byzantine
history, to prosecute, without interruption, the disgraceful, but
memorable, reign of Honorius.

The prudent Stilicho, instead of persisting to force the inclinations of
a prince, and people, who rejected his government, wisely abandoned
Arcadius to his unworthy favorites; and his reluctance to involve the
two empires in a civil war displayed the moderation of a minister, who
had so often signalized his military spirit and abilities. But if
Stilicho had any longer endured the revolt of Africa, he would have
betrayed the security of the capital, and the majesty of the Western
emperor, to the capricious insolence of a Moorish rebel. Gildo,  <span
id="fr_262"></span>[37](#fn_262.md) the brother of the tyrant Firmus, had
preserved and obtained, as the reward of his apparent fidelity, the
immense patrimony which was forfeited by treason: long and meritorious
service, in the armies of Rome, raised him to the dignity of a military
count; the narrow policy of the court of Theodosius had adopted the
mischievous expedient of supporting a legal government by the interest
of a powerful family; and the brother of Firmus was invested with the
command of Africa. His ambition soon usurped the administration of
justice, and of the finances, without account, and without control; and
he maintained, during a reign of twelve years, the possession of an
office, from which it was impossible to remove him, without the danger
of a civil war. During those twelve years, the provinces of Africa
groaned under the dominion of a tyrant, who seemed to unite the
unfeeling temper of a stranger with the partial resentments of domestic
faction. The forms of law were often superseded by the use of poison;
and if the trembling guests, who were invited to the table of Gildo,
presumed to express fears, the insolent suspicion served only to excite
his fury, and he loudly summoned the ministers of death. Gildo
alternately indulged the passions of avarice and lust;  <span
id="fr_263"></span>[38](#fn_263.md) and if his days were terrible to the
rich, his nights were not less dreadful to husbands and parents. The
fairest of their wives and daughters were prostituted to the embraces of
the tyrant; and afterwards abandoned to a ferocious troop of Barbarians
and assassins, the black, or swarthy, natives of the desert; whom Gildo
considered as the only of his throne. In the civil war between
Theodosius and Eugenius, the count, or rather the sovereign, of Africa,
maintained a haughty and suspicious neutrality; refused to assist either
of the contending parties with troops or vessels, expected the
declaration of fortune, and reserved for the conqueror the vain
professions of his allegiance. Such professions would not have satisfied
the master of the Roman world; but the death of Theodosius, and the
weakness and discord of his sons, confirmed the power of the Moor; who
condescended, as a proof of his moderation, to abstain from the use of
the diadem, and to supply Rome with the customary tribute, or rather
subsidy, of corn. In every division of the empire, the five provinces of
Africa were invariably assigned to the West; and Gildo had to govern
that extensive country in the name of Honorius, but his knowledge of the
character and designs of Stilicho soon engaged him to address his homage
to a more distant and feeble sovereign. The ministers of Arcadius
embraced the cause of a perfidious rebel; and the delusive hope of
adding the numerous cities of Africa to the empire of the East, tempted
them to assert a claim, which they were incapable of supporting, either
by reason or by arms.  <span id="fr_264"></span>[39](#fn_264.md)

When Stilicho had given a firm and decisive answer to the pretensions of
the Byzantine court, he solemnly accused the tyrant of Africa before the
tribunal, which had formerly judged the kings and nations of the earth;
and the image of the republic was revived, after a long interval, under
the reign of Honorius. The emperor transmitted an accurate and ample
detail of the complaints of the provincials, and the crimes of Gildo, to
the Roman senate; and the members of that venerable assembly were
required to pronounce the condemnation of the rebel. Their unanimous
suffrage declared him the enemy of the republic; and the decree of the
senate added a sacred and legitimate sanction to the Roman arms.  <span
id="fr_265"></span>[40](#fn_265.md) A people, who still remembered that
their ancestors had been the masters of the world, would have applauded,
with conscious pride, the representation of ancient freedom; if they had
not since been accustomed to prefer the solid assurance of bread to the
unsubstantial visions of liberty and greatness. The subsistence of Rome
depended on the harvests of Africa; and it was evident, that a
declaration of war would be the signal of famine. The praefect
Symmachus, who presided in the deliberations of the senate, admonished
the minister of his just apprehension, that as soon as the revengeful
Moor should prohibit the exportation of corn, the and perhaps the
safety, of the capital would be threatened by the hungry rage of a
turbulent multitude.  <span id="fr_266"></span>[41](#fn_266.md) The
prudence of Stilicho conceived and executed, without delay, the most
effectual measure for the relief of the Roman people. A large and
seasonable supply of corn, collected in the inland provinces of Gaul,
was embarked on the rapid stream of the Rhone, and transported, by an
easy navigation, from the Rhone to the Tyber. During the whole term of
the African war, the granaries of Rome were continually filled, her
dignity was vindicated from the humiliating dependence, and the minds of
an immense people were quieted by the calm confidence of peace and
plenty.  <span id="fr_267"></span>[42](#fn_267.md)

The cause of Rome, and the conduct of the African war, were intrusted by
Stilicho to a general, active and ardent to avenge his private injuries
on the head of the tyrant. The spirit of discord which prevailed in the
house of Nabal, had excited a deadly quarrel between two of his sons,
Gildo and Mascezel.  <span id="fr_268"></span>[43](#fn_268.md) The usurper
pursued, with implacable rage, the life of his younger brother, whose
courage and abilities he feared; and Mascezel, oppressed by superior
power, refuge in the court of Milan, where he soon received the cruel
intelligence that his two innocent and helpless children had been
murdered by their inhuman uncle. The affliction of the father was
suspended only by the desire of revenge. The vigilant Stilicho already
prepared to collect the naval and military force of the Western empire;
and he had resolved, if the tyrant should be able to wage an equal and
doubtful war, to march against him in person. But as Italy required his
presence, and as it might be dangerous to weaken the of the frontier, he
judged it more advisable, that Mascezel should attempt this arduous
adventure at the head of a chosen body of Gallic veterans, who had
lately served exhorted to convince the world that they could subvert, as
well as defend the throne of a usurper, consisted of the Jovian, the
Herculian, and the Augustan legions; of the Nervian auxiliaries; of the
soldiers who displayed in their banners the symbol of a lion, and of the
troops which were distinguished by the auspicious names of Fortunate,
and Invincible. Yet such was the smallness of their establishments, or
the difficulty of recruiting, that these seven bands,  <span
id="fr_269"></span>[44](#fn_269.md) of high dignity and reputation in the
service of Rome, amounted to no more than five thousand effective men.
 <span id="fr_270"></span>[45](#fn_270.md) The fleet of galleys and
transports sailed in tempestuous weather from the port of Pisa, in
Tuscany, and steered their course to the little island of Capraria;
which had borrowed that name from the wild goats, its original
inhabitants, whose place was occupied by a new colony of a strange and
savage appearance. "The whole island (says an ingenious traveller of
those times) is filled, or rather defiled, by men who fly from the
light. They call themselves Monks, or solitaries, because they choose to
live alone, without any witnesses of their actions. They fear the gifts
of fortune, from the apprehension of losing them; and, lest they should
be miserable, they embrace a life of voluntary wretchedness. How absurd
is their choice! how perverse their understanding! to dread the evils,
without being able to support the blessings, of the human condition.
Either this melancholy madness is the effect of disease, or exercise on
their own bodies the tortures which are inflicted on fugitive slaves by
the hand of justice."  <span id="fr_271"></span>[46](#fn_271.md) Such was
the contempt of a profane magistrate for the monks as the chosen
servants of God.  <span id="fr_272"></span>[47](#fn_272.md) Some of them
were persuaded, by his entreaties, to embark on board the fleet; and it
is observed, to the praise of the Roman general, that his days and
nights were employed in prayer, fasting, and the occupation of singing
psalms. The devout leader, who, with such a reenforcement, appeared
confident of victory, avoided the dangerous rocks of Corsica, coasted
along the eastern side of Sardinia, and secured his ships against the
violence of the south wind, by casting anchor in the and capacious
harbor of Cagliari, at the distance of one hundred and forty miles from
the African shores.  <span id="fr_273"></span>[48](#fn_273.md)

Gildo was prepared to resist the invasion with all the forces of Africa.
By the liberality of his gifts and promises, he endeavored to secure the
doubtful allegiance of the Roman soldiers, whilst he attracted to his
standard the distant tribes of Gaetulia and Aethiopia. He proudly
reviewed an army of seventy thousand men, and boasted, with the rash
presumption which is the forerunner of disgrace, that his numerous
cavalry would trample under their horses' feet the troops of Mascezel,
and involve, in a cloud of burning sand, the natives of the cold regions
of Gaul and Germany.  <span id="fr_274"></span>[49](#fn_274.md) But the
Moor, who commanded the legions of Honorius, was too well acquainted
with the manners of his countrymen, to entertain any serious
apprehension of a naked and disorderly host of Barbarians; whose left
arm, instead of a shield, was protected only by mantle; who were totally
disarmed as soon as they had darted their javelin from their right hand;
and whose horses had never He fixed his camp of five thousand veterans
in the face of a superior enemy, and, after the delay of three days,
gave the signal of a general engagement.  <span
id="fr_275"></span>[50](#fn_275.md) As Mascezel advanced before the front
with fair offers of peace and pardon, he encountered one of the foremost
standard-bearers of the Africans, and, on his refusal to yield, struck
him on the arm with his sword. The arm, and the standard, sunk under the
weight of the blow; and the imaginary act of submission was hastily
repeated by all the standards of the line. At this the disaffected
cohorts proclaimed the name of their lawful sovereign; the Barbarians,
astonished by the defection of their Roman allies, dispersed, according
to their custom, in tumultuary flight; and Mascezel obtained the of an
easy, and almost bloodless, victory.  <span
id="fr_276"></span>[51](#fn_276.md) The tyrant escaped from the field of
battle to the sea-shore; and threw himself into a small vessel, with the
hope of reaching in safety some friendly port of the empire of the East;
but the obstinacy of the wind drove him back into the harbor of Tabraca,
 <span id="fr_277"></span>[52](#fn_277.md) which had acknowledged, with the
rest of the province, the dominion of Honorius, and the authority of his
lieutenant. The inhabitants, as a proof of their repentance and loyalty,
seized and confined the person of Gildo in a dungeon; and his own
despair saved him from the intolerable torture of supporting the
presence of an injured and victorious brother.  <span
id="fr_278"></span>[53](#fn_278.md) The captives and the spoils of Africa
were laid at the feet of the emperor; but more sincere, in the midst of
prosperity, still affected to consult the laws of the republic; and
referred to the senate and people of Rome the judgment of the most
illustrious criminals.  <span id="fr_279"></span>[54](#fn_279.md) Their
trial was public and solemn; but the judges, in the exercise of this
obsolete and precarious jurisdiction, were impatient to punish the
African magistrates, who had intercepted the subsistence of the Roman
people. The rich and guilty province was oppressed by the Imperial
ministers, who had a visible interest to multiply the number of the
accomplices of Gildo; and if an edict of Honorius seems to check the
malicious industry of informers, a subsequent edict, at the distance of
ten years, continues and renews the prosecution of the which had been
committed in the time of the general rebellion.  <span
id="fr_280"></span>[55](#fn_280.md) The adherents of the tyrant who escaped
the first fury of the soldiers, and the judges, might derive some
consolation from the tragic fate of his brother, who could never obtain
his pardon for the extraordinary services which he had performed. After
he had finished an important war in the space of a single winter,
Mascezel was received at the court of Milan with loud applause, affected
gratitude, and secret jealousy;  <span id="fr_281"></span>[56](#fn_281.md)
and his death, which, perhaps, was the effect of passage of a bridge,
the Moorish prince, who accompanied the master-general of the West, was
suddenly thrown from his horse into the river; the officious haste of
the attendants was on the countenance of Stilicho; and while they
delayed the necessary assistance, the unfortunate Mascezel was
irrecoverably drowned.  <span id="fr_282"></span>[57](#fn_282.md)

The joy of the African triumph was happily connected with the nuptials
of the emperor Honorius, and of his cousin Maria, the daughter of
Stilicho: and this equal and honorable alliance seemed to invest the
powerful minister with the authority of a parent over his submissive
pupil. The muse of Claudian was not silent on this propitious day;
 <span id="fr_283"></span>[58](#fn_283.md) he sung, in various and lively
strains, the happiness of the royal pair; and the glory of the hero, who
confirmed their union, and supported their throne. The ancient fables of
Greece, which had almost ceased to be the object of religious faith,
were saved from oblivion by the genius of poetry. The picture of the
Cyprian grove, the seat of harmony and love; the triumphant progress of
Venus over her native seas, and the mild influence which her presence
diffused in the palace of Milan, express to every age the natural
sentiments of the heart, in the just and pleasing language of
allegorical fiction. But the amorous impatience which Claudian
attributes to the young prince,  <span id="fr_284"></span>[59](#fn_284.md)
must excite the smiles of the court; and his beauteous spouse (if she
deserved the praise of beauty) had not much to fear or to hope from the
passions of her lover. Honorius was only in the fourteenth year of his
age; Serena, the mother of his bride, deferred, by art of persuasion,
the consummation of the royal nuptials; Maria died a virgin, after she
had been ten years a wife; and the chastity of the emperor was secured
by the coldness, perhaps, the debility,of his constitution.  <span
id="fr_285"></span>[60](#fn_285.md) His subjects, who attentively studied
the character of their young sovereign, discovered that Honorius was
without passions, and consequently without talents; and that his feeble
and languid disposition was alike incapable of discharging the duties of
his rank, or of enjoying the pleasures of his age. In his early youth he
made some progress in the exercises of riding and drawing the bow: but
he soon relinquished these fatiguing occupations, and the amusement of
feeding poultry became the serious and daily care of the monarch of the
West,  <span id="fr_286"></span>[61](#fn_286.md) who resigned the reins of
empire to the firm and skilful hand of his guardian Stilicho. The
experience of history will countenance the suspicion that a prince who
was born in the purple, received a worse education than the meanest
peasant of his dominions; and that the ambitious minister suffered him
to attain the age of manhood, without attempting to excite his courage,
or to enlighten his under standing.  <span
id="fr_287"></span>[62](#fn_287.md) The predecessors of Honorius were
accustomed to animate by their example, or at least by their presence,
the valor of the legions; and the dates of their laws attest the
perpetual activity of their motions through the provinces of the Roman
world. But the son of Theodosius passed the slumber of his life, a
captive in his palace, a stranger in his country, and the patient,
almost the indifferent, spectator of the ruin of the Western empire,
which was repeatedly attacked, and finally subverted, by the arms of the
Barbarians. In the eventful history of a reign of twenty-eight years, it
will seldom be necessary to mention the name of the emperor Honorius.

between old and new Rome, between the Greeks and Latins.

exaggerated the vices of Gildo; but his Moorish extraction, his
notorious actions, and the complaints of St. Augustin, may justify the
poet's invectives. Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 398, No. 35 - 56) has
treated the African rebellion with skill and learning.

De Bello Gildonico, 165, 189.

Baronius condemns, still more severely, the licentiousness of Gildo; as
his wife, his daughter, and his sister, were examples of perfect
chastity. The adulteries of the African soldiers are checked by one of
the Imperial laws.

which are likewise mentioned by Zosimus, (l. v. p. 302.)

<span id="fn_265"></span>[40](daf03010.htm#fr_265.md) Symmachus (l. iv.
epist. 4) expresses the judicial forms of the senate; and Claudian (i.
Cons. Stilich. l. i. 325, &c.) seems to feel the spirit of a Roman.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[41](daf03010.htm#fr_266.md) Claudian finely
displays these complaints of Symmachus, in a speech of the goddess of
Rome, before the throne of Jupiter, (de Bell Gildon. 28 - 128.)

<span id="fn_267"></span>[42](daf03010.htm#fr_267.md) See Claudian (in
Eutrop. l. i 401, &c. i. Cons. Stil. l. i. 306, &c. i. Cons. Stilich.
91, &c.)

<span id="fn_268"></span>[43](daf03010.htm#fr_268.md) He was of a mature
age; since he had formerly (A.D. 373) served against his brother Firmus
(Ammian. xxix. 5.) Claudian, who understood the court of Milan, dwells
on the injuries, rather than the merits, of Mascezel, (de Bell. Gild.
389 - 414.) The Moorish war was not worthy of Honorius, or Stilicho, &c.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[44](daf03010.htm#fr_269.md) Claudian, Bell. Gild.
415 - 423. The change of discipline allowed him to use indifferently the
names of Legio Cohors, Manipulus. See Notitia Imperii, S. 38, 40.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[45](daf03010.htm#fr_270.md) Orosius (l. vii. c.
36, p. 565) qualifies this account with an expression of doubt, (ut
aiunt;) and it scarcely coincides with Zosimus, (l. v. p. 303.) Yet
Claudian, after some declamation about Cadmus, soldiers, frankly owns
that Stilicho sent a small army lest the rebels should fly, ne timeare
times, (i. Cons. Stilich. l. i. 314 &c.)

<span id="fn_271"></span>[46](daf03010.htm#fr_271.md) Claud. Rutil.
Numatian. Itinerar. i. 439 - 448. He afterwards (515 - 526) mentions a
religious madman on the Isle of Gorgona. For such profane remarks,
Rutilius and his accomplices are styled, by his commentator, Barthius,
rabiosi canes diaboli. Tillemont (Mem. Eccles com. xii. p. 471) more
calmly observes, that the unbelieving poet praises where he means to
censure.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[47](daf03010.htm#fr_272.md) Orosius, l. vii. c.
36, p. 564. Augustin commends two of these savage saints of the Isle of
Goats, (epist. lxxxi. apud Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xiii. p. 317,
and Baronius, Annal Eccles. A.D. 398 No. 51.)

<span id="fn_273"></span>[48](daf03010.htm#fr_273.md) Here the first book
of the Gildonic war is terminated. The rest of Claudian's poem has been
lost; and we are ignorant how or where the army made good their landing
in Afica.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[49](daf03010.htm#fr_274.md) Orosius must be
responsible for the account. The presumption of Gildo and his various
train of Barbarians is celebrated by Claudian, Cons. Stil. l. i. 345 -
355.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[50](daf03010.htm#fr_275.md) St. Ambrose, who had
been dead about a year, revealed, in a vision, the time and place of the
victory. Mascezel afterwards related his dream to Paulinus, the original
biographer of the saint, from whom it might easily pass to Orosius.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[51](daf03010.htm#fr_276.md) Zosimus (l. v. p.
303) supposes an obstinate combat; but the narrative of Orosius appears
to conceal a real fact, under the disguise of a miracle.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[52](daf03010.htm#fr_277.md) Tabraca lay between
the two Hippos, (Cellarius, tom. ii. p. 112; D'Anville, tom. iii. p.
84.) Orosius has distinctly named the field of battle, but our ignorance
cannot define the precise situation.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[53](daf03010.htm#fr_278.md) The death of Gildo is
expressed by Claudian (i. Cons. Stil. 357) and his best interpreters,
Zosimus and Orosius.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[54](daf03010.htm#fr_279.md) Claudian (ii. Cons.
Stilich. 99 - 119) describes their trial (tremuit quos Africa nuper,
cernunt rostra reos,) and applauds the restoration of the ancient
constitution. It is here that he introduces the famous sentence, so
familiar to the friends of despotism:

\- Nunquam libertas gratior exstat, Quam sub rege pio.

But the freedom which depends on royal piety, scarcely deserves
appellation

<span id="fn_280"></span>[55](daf03010.htm#fr_280.md) See the Theodosian
Code, l. ix. tit. xxxix. leg. 3, tit. xl. leg. 19.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[56](daf03010.htm#fr_281.md) Stilicho, who claimed
an equal share in all the victories of Theodosius and his son,
particularly asserts, that Africa was recovered by the wisdom of his
counsels, (see an inscription produced by Baronius.)

<span id="fn_282"></span>[57](daf03010.htm#fr_282.md) I have softened the
narrative of Zosimus, which, in its crude simplicity, is almost
incredible, (l. v. p. 303.) Orosius damns the victorious general (p.
538) for violating the right of sanctuary.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[58](daf03010.htm#fr_283.md) Claudian,as the poet
laureate, composed a serious and elaborate epithalamium of 340 lines;
besides some gay Fescennines, which were sung, in a more licentious
tone, on the wedding night.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[59](daf03010.htm#fr_284.md) - Calet obvius ire
Jam princeps, tardumque cupit discedere solem. Nobilis haud aliter
sonipes.

(De Nuptiis Honor. et Mariae, and more freely in the Fescennines 112 -
116) Dices, O quoties,hoc mihi dulcius Quam flavos decics vincere
Sarmatas.

......

Tum victor madido prosilias toro, Nocturni referens vulnera proelii.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[60](daf03010.htm#fr_285.md) See Zosimus, l. v. p.
333.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[61](daf03010.htm#fr_286.md) Procopius de Bell.
Gothico, l. i. c. 2. I have borrowed the general practice of Honorius,
without adopting the singular, and indeed improbable tale, which is
related by the Greek historian.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[62](daf03010.htm#fr_287.md) The lessons of
Theodosius, or rather Claudian, (iv. Cons. Honor 214 - 418,) might
compose a fine institution for the future prince of a great and free
nation. It was far above Honorius, and his degenerate subjects.
