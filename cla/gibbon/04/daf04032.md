### Chapter XLV: State Of Italy Under The Lombards. Part III.

So rapid was the influence of climate and example, that the Lombards of
the fourth generation surveyed with curiosity and affright the portraits
of their savage forefathers.  <span id="fr_906"></span>[49](#fn_906.md)
Their heads were shaven behind, but the shaggy locks hung over their
eyes and mouth, and a long beard represented the name and character of
the nation. Their dress consisted of loose linen garments, after the
fashion of the Anglo-Saxons, which were decorated, in their opinion,
with broad stripes or variegated colors. The legs and feet were clothed
in long hose, and open sandals; and even in the security of peace a
trusty sword was constantly girt to their side. Yet this strange
apparel, and horrid aspect, often concealed a gentle and generous
disposition; and as soon as the rage of battle had subsided, the
captives and subjects were sometimes surprised by the humanity of the
victor. The vices of the Lombards were the effect of passion, of
ignorance, of intoxication; their virtues are the more laudable, as they
were not affected by the hypocrisy of social manners, nor imposed by the
rigid constraint of laws and education. I should not be apprehensive of
deviating from my subject, if it were in my power to delineate the
private life of the conquerors of Italy; and I shall relate with
pleasure the adventurous gallantry of Autharis, which breathes the true
spirit of chivalry and romance.  <span id="fr_907"></span>[50](#fn_907.md)
After the loss of his promised bride, a Merovingian princess, he sought
in marriage the daughter of the king of Bavaria; and Garribald accepted
the alliance of the Italian monarch. Impatient of the slow progress of
negotiation, the ardent lover escaped from his palace, and visited the
court of Bavaria in the train of his own embassy. At the public
audience, the unknown stranger advanced to the throne, and informed
Garribald that the ambassador was indeed the minister of state, but that
he alone was the friend of Autharis, who had trusted him with the
delicate commission of making a faithful report of the charms of his
spouse. Theudelinda was summoned to undergo this important examination;
and, after a pause of silent rapture, he hailed her as the queen of
Italy, and humbly requested that, according to the custom of the nation,
she would present a cup of wine to the first of her new subjects. By the
command of her father she obeyed: Autharis received the cup in his turn,
and, in restoring it to the princess, he secretly touched her hand, and
drew his own finger over his face and lips. In the evening, Theudelinda
imparted to her nurse the indiscreet familiarity of the stranger, and
was comforted by the assurance, that such boldness could proceed only
from the king her husband, who, by his beauty and courage, appeared
worthy of her love. The ambassadors were dismissed: no sooner did they
reach the confines of Italy than Autharis, raising himself on his horse,
darted his battle-axe against a tree with incomparable strength and
dexterity. "Such," said he to the astonished Bavarians, "such are the
strokes of the king of the Lombards." On the approach of a French army,
Garribald and his daughter took refuge in the dominions of their ally;
and the marriage was consummated in the palace of Verona. At the end of
one year, it was dissolved by the death of Autharis: but the virtues of
Theudelinda  <span id="fr_908"></span>[51](#fn_908.md) had endeared her to
the nation, and she was permitted to bestow, with her hand, the sceptre
of the Italian kingdom.

From this fact, as well as from similar events,  <span
id="fr_909"></span>[52](#fn_909.md) it is certain that the Lombards
possessed freedom to elect their sovereign, and sense to decline the
frequent use of that dangerous privilege. The public revenue arose from
the produce of land and the profits of justice. When the independent
dukes agreed that Autharis should ascend the throne of his father, they
endowed the regal office with a fair moiety of their respective domains.
The proudest nobles aspired to the honors of servitude near the person
of their prince: he rewarded the fidelity of his vassals by the
precarious gift of pensions and benefices; and atoned for the injuries
of war by the rich foundation of monasteries and churches. In peace a
judge, a leader in war, he never usurped the powers of a sole and
absolute legislator. The king of Italy convened the national assemblies
in the palace, or more probably in the fields, of Pavia: his great
council was composed of the persons most eminent by their birth and
dignities; but the validity, as well as the execution, of their decrees
depended on the approbation of the faithful people, the fortunate army
of the Lombards. About fourscore years after the conquest of Italy,
their traditional customs were transcribed in Teutonic Latin,  <span
id="fr_910"></span>[53](#fn_910.md) and ratified by the consent of the
prince and people: some new regulations were introduced, more suitable
to their present condition; the example of Rotharis was imitated by the
wisest of his successors; and the laws of the Lombards have been
esteemed the least imperfect of the Barbaric codes.  <span
id="fr_911"></span>[54](#fn_911.md) Secure by their courage in the
possession of liberty, these rude and hasty legislators were incapable
of balancing the powers of the constitution, or of discussing the nice
theory of political government. Such crimes as threatened the life of
the sovereign, or the safety of the state, were adjudged worthy of
death; but their attention was principally confined to the defence of
the person and property of the subject. According to the strange
jurisprudence of the times, the guilt of blood might be redeemed by a
fine; yet the high price of nine hundred pieces of gold declares a just
sense of the value of a simple citizen. Less atrocious injuries, a
wound, a fracture, a blow, an opprobrious word, were measured with
scrupulous and almost ridiculous diligence; and the prudence of the
legislator encouraged the ignoble practice of bartering honor and
revenge for a pecuniary compensation. The ignorance of the Lombards in
the state of Paganism or Christianity gave implicit credit to the malice
and mischief of witchcraft, but the judges of the seventeenth century
might have been instructed and confounded by the wisdom of Rotharis, who
derides the absurd superstition, and protects the wretched victims of
popular or judicial cruelty.  <span id="fr_912"></span>[55](#fn_912.md) The
same spirit of a legislator, superior to his age and country, may be
ascribed to Luitprand, who condemns, while he tolerates, the impious and
inveterate abuse of duels,  <span id="fr_913"></span>[56](#fn_913.md)
observing, from his own experience, that the juster cause had often been
oppressed by successful violence. Whatever merit may be discovered in
the laws of the Lombards, they are the genuine fruit of the reason of
the Barbarians, who never admitted the bishops of Italy to a seat in
their legislative councils. But the succession of their kings is marked
with virtue and ability; the troubled series of their annals is adorned
with fair intervals of peace, order, and domestic happiness; and the
Italians enjoyed a milder and more equitable government, than any of the
other kingdoms which had been founded on the ruins of the Western
empire.  <span id="fr_914"></span>[57](#fn_914.md)

Amidst the arms of the Lombards, and under the despotism of the Greeks,
we again inquire into the fate of Rome,  <span
id="fr_915"></span>[58](#fn_915.md) which had reached, about the close of
the sixth century, the lowest period of her depression. By the removal
of the seat of empire, and the successive loss of the provinces, the
sources of public and private opulence were exhausted: the lofty tree,
under whose shade the nations of the earth had reposed, was deprived of
its leaves and branches, and the sapless trunk was left to wither on the
ground. The ministers of command, and the messengers of victory, no
longer met on the Appian or Flaminian way; and the hostile approach of
the Lombards was often felt, and continually feared. The inhabitants of
a potent and peaceful capital, who visit without an anxious thought the
garden of the adjacent country, will faintly picture in their fancy the
distress of the Romans: they shut or opened their gates with a trembling
hand, beheld from the walls the flames of their houses, and heard the
lamentations of their brethren, who were coupled together like dogs, and
dragged away into distant slavery beyond the sea and the mountains. Such
incessant alarms must annihilate the pleasures and interrupt the labors
of a rural life; and the Campagna of Rome was speedily reduced to the
state of a dreary wilderness, in which the land is barren, the waters
are impure, and the air is infectious. Curiosity and ambition no longer
attracted the nations to the capital of the world: but, if chance or
necessity directed the steps of a wandering stranger, he contemplated
with horror the vacancy and solitude of the city, and might be tempted
to ask, Where is the senate, and where are the people? In a season of
excessive rains, the Tyber swelled above its banks, and rushed with
irresistible violence into the valleys of the seven hills. A
pestilential disease arose from the stagnation of the deluge, and so
rapid was the contagion, that fourscore persons expired in an hour in
the midst of a solemn procession, which implored the mercy of Heaven.
 <span id="fr_916"></span>[59](#fn_916.md) A society in which marriage is
encouraged and industry prevails soon repairs the accidental losses of
pestilence and war: but, as the far greater part of the Romans was
condemned to hopeless indigence and celibacy, the depopulation was
constant and visible, and the gloomy enthusiasts might expect the
approaching failure of the human race.  <span
id="fr_917"></span>[60](#fn_917.md) Yet the number of citizens still
exceeded the measure of subsistence: their precarious food was supplied
from the harvests of Sicily or Egypt; and the frequent repetition of
famine betrays the inattention of the emperor to a distant province. The
edifices of Rome were exposed to the same ruin and decay: the mouldering
fabrics were easily overthrown by inundations, tempests, and
earthquakes: and the monks, who had occupied the most advantageous
stations, exulted in their base triumph over the ruins of antiquity.
 <span id="fr_918"></span>[61](#fn_918.md) It is commonly believed, that
Pope Gregory the First attacked the temples and mutilated the statues of
the city; that, by the command of the Barbarian, the Palatine library
was reduced to ashes, and that the history of Livy was the peculiar mark
of his absurd and mischievous fanaticism. The writings of Gregory
himself reveal his implacable aversion to the monuments of classic
genius; and he points his severest censure against the profane learning
of a bishop, who taught the art of grammar, studied the Latin poets, and
pronounced with the same voice the praises of Jupiter and those of
Christ. But the evidence of his destructive rage is doubtful and recent:
the Temple of Peace, or the theatre of Marcellus, have been demolished
by the slow operation of ages, and a formal proscription would have
multiplied the copies of Virgil and Livy in the countries which were not
subject to the ecclesiastical dictator.  <span
id="fr_919"></span>[62](#fn_919.md)

Like Thebes, or Babylon, or Carthage, the names of Rome might have been
erased from the earth, if the city had not been animated by a vital
principle, which again restored her to honor and dominion. A vague
tradition was embraced, that two Jewish teachers, a tent-maker and a
fisherman, had formerly been executed in the circus of Nero, and at the
end of five hundred years, their genuine or fictitious relics were
adored as the Palladium of Christian Rome. The pilgrims of the East and
West resorted to the holy threshold; but the shrines of the apostles
were guarded by miracles and invisible terrors; and it was not without
fear that the pious Catholic approached the object of his worship. It
was fatal to touch, it was dangerous to behold, the bodies of the
saints; and those who, from the purest motives, presumed to disturb the
repose of the sanctuary, were affrighted by visions, or punished with
sudden death. The unreasonable request of an empress, who wished to
deprive the Romans of their sacred treasure, the head of St. Paul, was
rejected with the deepest abhorrence; and the pope asserted, most
probably with truth, that a linen which had been sanctified in the
neighborhood of his body, or the filings of his chain, which it was
sometimes easy and sometimes impossible to obtain, possessed an equal
degree of miraculous virtue.  <span id="fr_920"></span>[63](#fn_920.md) But
the power as well as virtue of the apostles resided with living energy
in the breast of their successors; and the chair of St. Peter was filled
under the reign of Maurice by the first and greatest of the name of
Gregory.  <span id="fr_921"></span>[64](#fn_921.md) His grandfather Felix
had himself been pope, and as the bishops were already bound by the laws
of celibacy, his consecration must have been preceded by the death of
his wife. The parents of Gregory, Sylvia, and Gordian, were the noblest
of the senate, and the most pious of the church of Rome; his female
relations were numbered among the saints and virgins; and his own
figure, with those of his father and mother, were represented near three
hundred years in a family portrait,  <span
id="fr_922"></span>[65](#fn_922.md) which he offered to the monastery of
St. Andrew. The design and coloring of this picture afford an honorable
testimony that the art of painting was cultivated by the Italians of the
sixth century; but the most abject ideas must be entertained of their
taste and learning, since the epistles of Gregory, his sermons, and his
dialogues, are the work of a man who was second in erudition to none of
his contemporaries:  <span id="fr_923"></span>[66](#fn_923.md) his birth
and abilities had raised him to the office of praefect of the city, and
he enjoyed the merit of renouncing the pomps and vanities of this world.
His ample patrimony was dedicated to the foundation of seven
monasteries,  <span id="fr_924"></span>[67](#fn_924.md) one in Rome,  <span
id="fr_925"></span>[68](#fn_925.md) and six in Sicily; and it was the wish
of Gregory that he might be unknown in this life, and glorious only in
the next. Yet his devotion (and it might be sincere) pursued the path
which would have been chosen by a crafty and ambitious statesman. The
talents of Gregory, and the splendor which accompanied his retreat,
rendered him dear and useful to the church; and implicit obedience has
always been inculcated as the first duty of a monk. As soon as he had
received the character of deacon, Gregory was sent to reside at the
Byzantine court, the nuncio or minister of the apostolic see; and he
boldly assumed, in the name of St. Peter, a tone of independent dignity,
which would have been criminal and dangerous in the most illustrious
layman of the empire. He returned to Rome with a just increase of
reputation, and, after a short exercise of the monastic virtues, he was
dragged from the cloister to the papal throne, by the unanimous voice of
the clergy, the senate, and the people. He alone resisted, or seemed to
resist, his own elevation; and his humble petition, that Maurice would
be pleased to reject the choice of the Romans, could only serve to exalt
his character in the eyes of the emperor and the public. When the fatal
mandate was proclaimed, Gregory solicited the aid of some friendly
merchants to convey him in a basket beyond the gates of Rome, and
modestly concealed himself some days among the woods and mountains, till
his retreat was discovered, as it is said, by a celestial light.

The pontificate of Gregory the Great, which lasted thirteen years, six
months, and ten days, is one of the most edifying periods of the history
of the church. His virtues, and even his faults, a singular mixture of
simplicity and cunning, of pride and humility, of sense and
superstition, were happily suited to his station and to the temper of
the times. In his rival, the patriarch of Constantinople, he condemned
the anti-Christian title of universal bishop, which the successor of St.
Peter was too haughty to concede, and too feeble to assume; and the
ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Gregory was confined to the triple
character of Bishop of Rome, Primate of Italy, and Apostle of the West.
He frequently ascended the pulpit, and kindled, by his rude, though
pathetic, eloquence, the congenial passions of his audience: the
language of the Jewish prophets was interpreted and applied; and the
minds of a people, depressed by their present calamities, were directed
to the hopes and fears of the invisible world. His precepts and example
defined the model of the Roman liturgy;  <span
id="fr_926"></span>[69](#fn_926.md) the distribution of the parishes, the
calendar of the festivals, the order of processions, the service of the
priests and deacons, the variety and change of sacerdotal garments. Till
the last days of his life, he officiated in the canon of the mass, which
continued above three hours: the Gregorian chant  <span
id="fr_927"></span>[70](#fn_927.md) has preserved the vocal and
instrumental music of the theatre, and the rough voices of the
Barbarians attempted to imitate the melody of the Roman school.  <span
id="fr_928"></span>[71](#fn_928.md) Experience had shown him the efficacy
of these solemn and pompous rites, to soothe the distress, to confirm
the faith, to mitigate the fierceness, and to dispel the dark enthusiasm
of the vulgar, and he readily forgave their tendency to promote the
reign of priesthood and superstition. The bishops of Italy and the
adjacent islands acknowledged the Roman pontiff as their special
metropolitan. Even the existence, the union, or the translation of
episcopal seats was decided by his absolute discretion: and his
successful inroads into the provinces of Greece, of Spain, and of Gaul,
might countenance the more lofty pretensions of succeeding popes. He
interposed to prevent the abuses of popular elections; his jealous care
maintained the purity of faith and discipline; and the apostolic
shepherd assiduously watched over the faith and discipline of the
subordinate pastors. Under his reign, the Arians of Italy and Spain were
reconciled to the Catholic church, and the conquest of Britain reflects
less glory on the name of Caesar, than on that of Gregory the First.
Instead of six legions, forty monks were embarked for that distant
island, and the pontiff lamented the austere duties which forbade him to
partake the perils of their spiritual warfare. In less than two years,
he could announce to the archbishop of Alexandria, that they had
baptized the king of Kent with ten thousand of his Anglo-Saxons, and
that the Roman missionaries, like those of the primitive church, were
armed only with spiritual and supernatural powers. The credulity or the
prudence of Gregory was always disposed to confirm the truths of
religion by the evidence of ghosts, miracles, and resurrections;  <span
id="fr_929"></span>[72](#fn_929.md) and posterity has paid to his memory
the same tribute which he freely granted to the virtue of his own or the
preceding generation. The celestial honors have been liberally bestowed
by the authority of the popes, but Gregory is the last of their own
order whom they have presumed to inscribe in the calendar of saints.

Their temporal power insensibly arose from the calamities of the times:
and the Roman bishops, who have deluged Europe and Asia with blood, were
compelled to reign as the ministers of charity and peace. I. The church
of Rome, as it has been formerly observed, was endowed with ample
possessions in Italy, Sicily, and the more distant provinces; and her
agents, who were commonly sub-deacons, had acquired a civil, and even
criminal, jurisdiction over their tenants and husbandmen. The successor
of St. Peter administered his patrimony with the temper of a vigilant
and moderate landlord;  <span id="fr_930"></span>[73](#fn_930.md) and the
epistles of Gregory are filled with salutary instructions to abstain
from doubtful or vexatious lawsuits; to preserve the integrity of
weights and measures; to grant every reasonable delay; and to reduce the
capitation of the slaves of the glebe, who purchased the right of
marriage by the payment of an arbitrary fine.  <span
id="fr_931"></span>[74](#fn_931.md) The rent or the produce of these
estates was transported to the mouth of the Tyber, at the risk and
expense of the pope: in the use of wealth he acted like a faithful
steward of the church and the poor, and liberally applied to their wants
the inexhaustible resources of abstinence and order. The voluminous
account of his receipts and disbursements was kept above three hundred
years in the Lateran, as the model of Christian economy. On the four
great festivals, he divided their quarterly allowance to the clergy, to
his domestics, to the monasteries, the churches, the places of burial,
the almshouses, and the hospitals of Rome, and the rest of the diocese.
On the first day of every month, he distributed to the poor, according
to the season, their stated portion of corn, wine, cheese, vegetables,
oil, fish, fresh provisions, clothes, and money; and his treasurers were
continually summoned to satisfy, in his name, the extraordinary demands
of indigence and merit. The instant distress of the sick and helpless,
of strangers and pilgrims, was relieved by the bounty of each day, and
of every hour; nor would the pontiff indulge himself in a frugal repast,
till he had sent the dishes from his own table to some objects deserving
of his compassion. The misery of the times had reduced the nobles and
matrons of Rome to accept, without a blush, the benevolence of the
church: three thousand virgins received their food and raiment from the
hand of their benefactor; and many bishops of Italy escaped from the
Barbarians to the hospitable threshold of the Vatican. Gregory might
justly be styled the Father of his Country; and such was the extreme
sensibility of his conscience, that, for the death of a beggar who had
perished in the streets, he interdicted himself during several days from
the exercise of sacerdotal functions. II. The misfortunes of Rome
involved the apostolical pastor in the business of peace and war; and it
might be doubtful to himself, whether piety or ambition prompted him to
supply the place of his absent sovereign. Gregory awakened the emperor
from a long slumber; exposed the guilt or incapacity of the exarch and
his inferior ministers; complained that the veterans were withdrawn from
Rome for the defence of Spoleto; encouraged the Italians to guard their
cities and altars; and condescended, in the crisis of danger, to name
the tribunes, and to direct the operations, of the provincial troops.
But the martial spirit of the pope was checked by the scruples of
humanity and religion: the imposition of tribute, though it was employed
in the Italian war, he freely condemned as odious and oppressive; whilst
he protected, against the Imperial edicts, the pious cowardice of the
soldiers who deserted a military for a monastic life If we may credit
his own declarations, it would have been easy for Gregory to exterminate
the Lombards by their domestic factions, without leaving a king, a duke,
or a count, to save that unfortunate nation from the vengeance of their
foes As a Christian bishop, he preferred the salutary offices of peace;
his mediation appeased the tumult of arms: but he was too conscious of
the arts of the Greeks, and the passions of the Lombards, to engage his
sacred promise for the observance of the truce. Disappointed in the hope
of a general and lasting treaty, he presumed to save his country without
the consent of the emperor or the exarch. The sword of the enemy was
suspended over Rome; it was averted by the mild eloquence and seasonable
gifts of the pontiff, who commanded the respect of heretics and
Barbarians. The merits of Gregory were treated by the Byzantine court
with reproach and insult; but in the attachment of a grateful people, he
found the purest reward of a citizen, and the best right of a sovereign.

that the saint may have magnified the faults of Arians and enemies.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[58](daf04032.htm#fr_915.md) The passages of the
homilies of Gregory, which represent the miserable state of the city and

<span id="fn_917"></span>[60](daf04032.htm#fr_917.md) Gregory of Rome
(Dialog. l. ii. c. 15) relates a memorable prediction of St. Benedict.
Roma a Gentilibus non exterminabitur sed tempestatibus, coruscis
turbinibus ac terrae motu in semetipsa marces cet. Such a prophecy melts
into true history, and becomes the evidence of the fact after which it
was invented.

cum Jovis laudibus, Christi laudes non capiunt, et quam grave
nefandumque sit episcopis canere quod nec laico religioso conveniat,
ipse considera, (l. ix. ep. 4.) The writings of Gregory himself attest
his innocence of any classic taste or literature

<span id="fn_919"></span>[62](daf04032.htm#fr_919.md) Bayle, (Dictionnaire
Critique, tom. ii. 598, 569,) in a very good article of Gregoire I., has
quoted, for the buildings and statues, Platina in Gregorio I.; for the
Palatine library, John of Salisbury, (de Nugis Curialium, l. ii. c. 26;)
and for Livy, Antoninus of Florence: the oldest of the three lived in
the xiith century.

<span id="fn_920"></span>[63](daf04032.htm#fr_920.md) Gregor. l. iii.
epist. 24, edict. 12, &c. From the epistles of Gregory, and the viiith
volume of the Annals of Baronius, the pious reader may collect the
particles of holy iron which were inserted in keys or crosses of gold,
and distributed in Britain, Gaul, Spain, Africa, Constantinople, and
Egypt. The pontifical smith who handled the file must have understood
the miracles which it was in his own power to operate or withhold; a
circumstance which abates the superstition of Gregory at the expense of
his veracity.

<span id="fn_921"></span>[64](daf04032.htm#fr_921.md) Besides the epistles
of Gregory himself, which are methodized by Dupin, (Bibliotheque Eccles.
tom. v. p. 103 - 126,) we have three lives of the pope; the two first
written in the viiith and ixth centuries, (de Triplici Vita St. Greg.
Preface to the ivth volume of the Benedictine edition,) by the deacons
Paul (p. 1 - 18) and John, (p. 19 - 188,) and containing much original,
though doubtful, evidence; the third, a long and labored compilation by
the Benedictine editors, (p. 199 - 305.) The annals of Baronius are a
copious but partial history. His papal prejudices are tempered by the
good sense of Fleury, (Hist. Eccles. tom. viii.,) and his chronology has
been rectified by the criticism of Pagi and Muratori.

<span id="fn_922"></span>[65](daf04032.htm#fr_922.md) John the deacon has
described them like an eye-witness, (l. iv. c. 83, 84;) and his
description is illustrated by Angelo Rocca, a Roman antiquary, (St.
Greg. Opera, tom. iv. p. 312 - 326;) who observes that some mosaics of
the popes of the viith century are still preserved in the old churches
of Rome, (p. 321 - 323) The same walls which represented Gregory's
family are now decorated with the martyrdom of St. Andrew, the noble
contest of Dominichino and Guido.

<span id="fn_923"></span>[66](daf04032.htm#fr_923.md) Disciplinis vero
liberalibus, hoc est grammatica, rhetorica, dialectica ita apuero est
institutus, ut quamvis eo tempore florerent adhuc Romae studia
literarum, tamen nulli in urbe ipsa secundus putaretur. Paul. Diacon. in
Vit. St. Gregor. c. 2.

<span id="fn_924"></span>[67](daf04032.htm#fr_924.md) The Benedictines
(Vit. Greg. l. i. p. 205 - 208) labor to reduce the monasteries of
Gregory within the rule of their own order; but, as the question is
confessed to be doubtful, it is clear that these powerful monks are in
the wrong. See Butler's Lives of the Saints, vol. iii. p. 145; a work of
merit: the sense and learning belong to the author - his prejudices are
those of his profession.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[68](daf04032.htm#fr_925.md) Monasterium
Gregorianum in ejusdem Beati Gregorii aedibus ad clivum Scauri prope
ecclesiam SS. Johannis et Pauli in honorem St. Andreae, (John, in Vit.
Greg. l. i. c. 6. Greg. l. vii. epist. 13.) This house and monastery
were situate on the side of the Caelian hill which fronts the Palatine;
they are now occupied by the Camaldoli: San Gregorio triumphs, and St.
Andrew has retired to a small chapel Nardini, Roma Antica, l. iii. c. 6,
p. 100. Descrizzione di Roma, tom. i. p. 442 - 446.

<span id="fn_926"></span>[69](daf04032.htm#fr_926.md) The Lord's Prayer
consists of half a dozen lines; the Sacramentarius and Antiphonarius of
Gregory fill 880 folio pages, (tom. iii. p. i. p. 1 - 880;) yet these
only constitute a part of the Ordo Romanus, which Mabillon has
illustrated and Fleury has abridged, (Hist. Eccles. tom. viii. p. 139 -
152.)

<span id="fn_927"></span>[70](daf04032.htm#fr_927.md) I learn from the Abbe
Dobos, (Reflexions sur la Poesie et la Peinture, tom. iii. p. 174, 175,)
that the simplicity of the Ambrosian chant was confined to four modes,
while the more perfect harmony of the Gregorian comprised the eight
modes or fifteen chords of the ancient music. He observes (p. 332) that
the connoisseurs admire the preface and many passages of the Gregorian
office.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[71](daf04032.htm#fr_928.md) John the deacon (in
Vit. Greg. l. ii. c. 7) expresses the early contempt of the Italians for
tramontane singing. Alpina scilicet corpora vocum suarum tonitruis
altisone perstrepentia, susceptae modulationis dulcedinem proprie non
resultant: quia bibuli gutturis barbara feritas dum inflexionibus et
repercussionibus mitem nititur edere cantilenam, naturali quodam
fragore, quasi plaustra per gradus confuse sonantia, rigidas voces
jactat, &c. In the time of Charlemagne, the Franks, though with some
reluctance, admitted the justice of the reproach. Muratori, Dissert.
xxv.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[72](daf04032.htm#fr_929.md) A French critic
(Petrus Gussanvillus, Opera, tom. ii. p. 105 - 112) has vindicated the
right of Gregory to the entire nonsense of the Dialogues. Dupin (tom. v.
p. 138) does not think that any one will vouch for the truth of all
these miracles: I should like to know how many of them he believed
himself.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[73](daf04032.htm#fr_930.md) Baronius is unwilling
to expatiate on the care of the patrimonies, lest he should betray that
they consisted not of kingdoms, but farms. The French writers, the
Benedictine editors, (tom. iv. l. iii. p. 272, &c.,) and Fleury, (tom.
viii. p. 29, &c.,) are not afraid of entering into these humble, though
useful, details; and the humanity of Fleury dwells on the social virtues
of Gregory.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[74](daf04032.htm#fr_931.md) I much suspect that
this pecuniary fine on the marriages of villains produced the famous,
and often fabulous right, de cuissage, de marquette, &c. With the
consent of her husband, a handsome bride might commute the payment in
the arms of a young landlord, and the mutual favor might afford a
precedent of local rather than legal tyranny

<span id="fn_932"></span>[75](daf04032.htm#fr_932.md) The temporal reign of
Gregory I. is ably exposed by Sigonius in the first book, de Regno
Italiae. See his works, tom. ii. p. 44 - 75
