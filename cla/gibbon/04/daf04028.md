### Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence. Part VI.

1\. The goddess of faith (of human and social faith) was worshipped, not
only in her temples, but in the lives of the Romans; and if that nation
was deficient in the more amiable qualities of benevolence and
generosity, they astonished the Greeks by their sincere and simple
performance of the most burdensome engagements.  <span
id="fr_806"></span>[159](#fn_806.md) Yet among the same people, according
to the rigid maxims of the patricians and decemvirs, a naked pact, a
promise, or even an oath, did not create any civil obligation, unless it
was confirmed by the legal form of a stipulation. Whatever might be the
etymology of the Latin word, it conveyed the idea of a firm and
irrevocable contract, which was always expressed in the mode of a
question and answer. Do you promise to pay me one hundred pieces of
gold? was the solemn interrogation of Seius. I do promise, was the reply
of Sempronius. The friends of Sempronius, who answered for his ability
and inclination, might be separately sued at the option of Seius; and
the benefit of partition, or order of reciprocal actions, insensibly
deviated from the strict theory of stipulation. The most cautious and
deliberate consent was justly required to sustain the validity of a
gratuitous promise; and the citizen who might have obtained a legal
security, incurred the suspicion of fraud, and paid the forfeit of his
neglect. But the ingenuity of the civilians successfully labored to
convert simple engagements into the form of solemn stipulations. The
praetors, as the guardians of social faith, admitted every rational
evidence of a voluntary and deliberate act, which in their tribunal
produced an equitable obligation, and for which they gave an action and
a remedy.  <span id="fr_807"></span>[160](#fn_807.md)

2\. The obligations of the second class, as they were contracted by the
delivery of a thing, are marked by the civilians with the epithet of
real.  <span id="fr_808"></span>[161](#fn_808.md) A grateful return is due
to the author of a benefit; and whoever is intrusted with the property
of another, has bound himself to the sacred duty of restitution. In the
case of a friendly loan, the merit of generosity is on the side of the
lender only; in a deposit, on the side of the receiver; but in a pledge,
and the rest of the selfish commerce of ordinary life, the benefit is
compensated by an equivalent, and the obligation to restore is variously
modified by the nature of the transaction. The Latin language very
happily expresses the fundamental difference between the commodatum and
the mutuum, which our poverty is reduced to confound under the vague and
common appellation of a loan. In the former, the borrower was obliged to
restore the same individual thing with which he had been accommodated
for the temporary supply of his wants; in the latter, it was destined
for his use and consumption, and he discharged this mutual engagement,
by substituting the same specific value according to a just estimation
of number, of weight, and of measure. In the contract of sale, the
absolute dominion is transferred to the purchaser, and he repays the
benefit with an adequate sum of gold or silver, the price and universal
standard of all earthly possessions. The obligation of another contract,
that of location, is of a more complicated kind. Lands or houses, labor
or talents, may be hired for a definite term; at the expiration of the
time, the thing itself must be restored to the owner, with an additional
reward for the beneficial occupation and employment. In these lucrative
contracts, to which may be added those of partnership and commissions,
the civilians sometimes imagine the delivery of the object, and
sometimes presume the consent of the parties. The substantial pledge has
been refined into the invisible rights of a mortgage or hypotheca; and
the agreement of sale, for a certain price, imputes, from that moment,
the chances of gain or loss to the account of the purchaser. It may be
fairly supposed, that every man will obey the dictates of his interest;
and if he accepts the benefit, he is obliged to sustain the expense, of
the transaction. In this boundless subject, the historian will observe
the location of land and money, the rent of the one and the interest of
the other, as they materially affect the prosperity of agriculture and
commerce. The landlord was often obliged to advance the stock and
instruments of husbandry, and to content himself with a partition of the
fruits. If the feeble tenant was oppressed by accident, contagion, or
hostile violence, he claimed a proportionable relief from the equity of
the laws: five years were the customary term, and no solid or costly
improvements could be expected from a farmer, who, at each moment might
be ejected by the sale of the estate.  <span
id="fr_809"></span>[162](#fn_809.md) Usury,  <span
id="fr_810"></span>[163](#fn_810.md) the inveterate grievance of the city,
had been discouraged by the Twelve Tables,  <span
id="fr_811"></span>[164](#fn_811.md) and abolished by the clamors of the
people. It was revived by their wants and idleness, tolerated by the
discretion of the praetors, and finally determined by the Code of
Justinian. Persons of illustrious rank were confined to the moderate
profit of four per cent.; six was pronounced to be the ordinary and
legal standard of interest; eight was allowed for the convenience of
manufactures and merchants; twelve was granted to nautical insurance,
which the wiser ancients had not attempted to define; but, except in
this perilous adventure, the practice of exorbitant usury was severely
restrained.  <span id="fr_812"></span>[165](#fn_812.md) The most simple
interest was condemned by the clergy of the East and West;  <span
id="fr_813"></span>[166](#fn_813.md) but the sense of mutual benefit, which
had triumphed over the law of the republic, has resisted with equal
firmness the decrees of the church, and even the prejudices of mankind.
 <span id="fr_814"></span>[167](#fn_814.md)

3\. Nature and society impose the strict obligation of repairing an
injury; and the sufferer by private injustice acquires a personal right
and a legitimate action. If the property of another be intrusted to our
care, the requisite degree of care may rise and fall according to the
benefit which we derive from such temporary possession; we are seldom
made responsible for inevitable accident, but the consequences of a
voluntary fault must always be imputed to the author.  <span
id="fr_815"></span>[168](#fn_815.md) A Roman pursued and recovered his
stolen goods by a civil action of theft; they might pass through a
succession of pure and innocent hands, but nothing less than a
prescription of thirty years could extinguish his original claim. They
were restored by the sentence of the praetor, and the injury was
compensated by double, or threefold, or even quadruple damages, as the
deed had been perpetrated by secret fraud or open rapine, as the robber
had been surprised in the fact, or detected by a subsequent research.
The Aquilian law  <span id="fr_816"></span>[169](#fn_816.md) defended the
living property of a citizen, his slaves and cattle, from the stroke of
malice or negligence: the highest price was allowed that could be
ascribed to the domestic animal at any moment of the year preceding his
death; a similar latitude of thirty days was granted on the destruction
of any other valuable effects. A personal injury is blunted or sharpened
by the manners of the times and the sensibility of the individual: the
pain or the disgrace of a word or blow cannot easily be appreciated by a
pecuniary equivalent. The rude jurisprudence of the decemvirs had
confounded all hasty insults, which did not amount to the fracture of a
limb, by condemning the aggressor to the common penalty of twenty-five
asses. But the same denomination of money was reduced, in three
centuries, from a pound to the weight of half an ounce: and the
insolence of a wealthy Roman indulged himself in the cheap amusement of
breaking and satisfying the law of the twelve tables. Veratius ran
through the streets striking on the face the inoffensive passengers, and
his attendant purse-bearer immediately silenced their clamors by the
legal tender of twenty-five pieces of copper, about the value of one
shilling.  <span id="fr_817"></span>[170](#fn_817.md) The equity of the
praetors examined and estimated the distinct merits of each particular
complaint. In the adjudication of civil damages, the magistrate assumed
a right to consider the various circumstances of time and place, of age
and dignity, which may aggravate the shame and sufferings of the injured
person; but if he admitted the idea of a fine, a punishment, an example,
he invaded the province, though, perhaps, he supplied the defects, of
the criminal law.

The execution of the Alban dictator, who was dismembered by eight
horses, is represented by Livy as the first and the fast instance of
Roman cruelty in the punishment of the most atrocious crimes.  <span
id="fr_818"></span>[171](#fn_818.md) But this act of justice, or revenge,
was inflicted on a foreign enemy in the heat of victory, and at the
command of a single man. The twelve tables afford a more decisive proof
of the national spirit, since they were framed by the wisest of the
senate, and accepted by the free voices of the people; yet these laws,
like the statutes of Draco,  <span id="fr_819"></span>[172](#fn_819.md) are
written in characters of blood.  <span id="fr_820"></span>[173](#fn_820.md)
They approve the inhuman and unequal principle of retaliation; and the
forfeit of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a limb for a limb, is
rigorously exacted, unless the offender can redeem his pardon by a fine
of three hundred pounds of copper. The decemvirs distributed with much
liberality the slighter chastisements of flagellation and servitude; and
nine crimes of a very different complexion are adjudged worthy of death.

1\. Any act of treason against the state, or of correspondence with the
public enemy. The mode of execution was painful and ignominious: the
head of the degenerate Roman was shrouded in a veil, his hands were tied
behind his back, and after he had been scourged by the lictor, he was
suspended in the midst of the forum on a cross, or inauspicious tree.

2\. Nocturnal meetings in the city; whatever might be the pretence, of
pleasure, or religion, or the public good.

3\. The murder of a citizen; for which the common feelings of mankind
demand the blood of the murderer. Poison is still more odious than the
sword or dagger; and we are surprised to discover, in two flagitious
events, how early such subtle wickedness had infected the simplicity of
the republic, and the chaste virtues of the Roman matrons.  <span
id="fr_821"></span>[174](#fn_821.md) The parricide, who violated the duties
of nature and gratitude, was cast into the river or the sea, enclosed in
a sack; and a cock, a viper, a dog, and a monkey, were successively
added, as the most suitable companions.  <span
id="fr_822"></span>[175](#fn_822.md) Italy produces no monkeys; but the
want could never be felt, till the middle of the sixth century first
revealed the guilt of a parricide.  <span
id="fr_823"></span>[176](#fn_823.md)

4\. The malice of an incendiary. After the previous ceremony of
whipping, he himself was delivered to the flames; and in this example
alone our reason is tempted to applaud the justice of retaliation.

5\. Judicial perjury. The corrupt or malicious witness was thrown
headlong from the Tarpeian rock, to expiate his falsehood, which was
rendered still more fatal by the severity of the penal laws, and the
deficiency of written evidence.

6\. The corruption of a judge, who accepted bribes to pronounce an
iniquitous sentence.

7\. Libels and satires, whose rude strains sometimes disturbed the peace
of an illiterate city. The author was beaten with clubs, a worthy
chastisement, but it is not certain that he was left to expire under the
blows of the executioner.  <span id="fr_824"></span>[177](#fn_824.md)

8\. The nocturnal mischief of damaging or destroying a neighbor's corn.
The criminal was suspended as a grateful victim to Ceres. But the sylvan
deities were less implacable, and the extirpation of a more valuable
tree was compensated by the moderate fine of twenty-five pounds of
copper. 9. Magical incantations; which had power, in the opinion of the
Latin shepherds, to exhaust the strength of an enemy, to extinguish his
life, and to remove from their seats his deep-rooted plantations.

The cruelty of the twelve tables against insolvent debtors still remains
to be told; and I shall dare to prefer the literal sense of antiquity to
the specious refinements of modern criticism.  <span
id="fr_825"></span>[178](#fn_825.md)  <span
id="fr_826"></span>[\*\_0059](#fn_826.md) After the judicial proof or
confession of the debt, thirty days of grace were allowed before a Roman
was delivered into the power of his fellow- citizen. In this private
prison, twelve ounces of rice were his daily food; he might be bound
with a chain of fifteen pounds weight; and his misery was thrice exposed
in the market place, to solicit the compassion of his friends and
countrymen. At the expiration of sixty days, the debt was discharged by
the loss of liberty or life; the insolvent debtor was either put to
death, or sold in foreign slavery beyond the Tyber: but, if several
creditors were alike obstinate and unrelenting, they might legally
dismember his body, and satiate their revenge by this horrid partition.
The advocates for this savage law have insisted, that it must strongly
operate in deterring idleness and fraud from contracting debts which
they were unable to discharge; but experience would dissipate this
salutary terror, by proving that no creditor could be found to exact
this unprofitable penalty of life or limb. As the manners of Rome were
insensibly polished, the criminal code of the decemvirs was abolished by
the humanity of accusers, witnesses, and judges; and impunity became the
consequence of immoderate rigor. The Porcian and Valerian laws
prohibited the magistrates from inflicting on a free citizen any
capital, or even corporal, punishment; and the obsolete statutes of
blood were artfully, and perhaps truly, ascribed to the spirit, not of
patrician, but of regal, tyranny.

In the absence of penal laws, and the insufficiency of civil actions,
the peace and justice of the city were imperfectly maintained by the
private jurisdiction of the citizens. The malefactors who replenish our
jails are the outcasts of society, and the crimes for which they suffer
may be commonly ascribed to ignorance, poverty, and brutal appetite. For
the perpetration of similar enormities, a vile plebeian might claim and
abuse the sacred character of a member of the republic: but, on the
proof or suspicion of guilt, the slave, or the stranger, was nailed to a
cross; and this strict and summary justice might be exercised without
restraint over the greatest part of the populace of Rome. Each family
contained a domestic tribunal, which was not confined, like that of the
praetor, to the cognizance of external actions: virtuous principles and
habits were inculcated by the discipline of education; and the Roman
father was accountable to the state for the manners of his children,
since he disposed, without appeal, of their life, their liberty, and
their inheritance. In some pressing emergencies, the citizen was
authorized to avenge his private or public wrongs. The consent of the
Jewish, the Athenian, and the Roman laws approved the slaughter of the
nocturnal thief; though in open daylight a robber could not be slain
without some previous evidence of danger and complaint. Whoever
surprised an adulterer in his nuptial bed might freely exercise his
revenge;  <span id="fr_827"></span>[179](#fn_827.md) the most bloody and
wanton outrage was excused by the provocation;  <span
id="fr_828"></span>[180](#fn_828.md) nor was it before the reign of
Augustus that the husband was reduced to weigh the rank of the offender,
or that the parent was condemned to sacrifice his daughter with her
guilty seducer. After the expulsion of the kings, the ambitious Roman,
who should dare to assume their title or imitate their tyranny, was
devoted to the infernal gods: each of his fellow-citizens was armed with
the sword of justice; and the act of Brutus, however repugnant to
gratitude or prudence, had been already sanctified by the judgment of
his country.  <span id="fr_829"></span>[181](#fn_829.md) The barbarous
practice of wearing arms in the midst of peace,  <span
id="fr_830"></span>[182](#fn_830.md) and the bloody maxims of honor, were
unknown to the Romans; and, during the two purest ages, from the
establishment of equal freedom to the end of the Punic wars, the city
was never disturbed by sedition, and rarely polluted with atrocious
crimes. The failure of penal laws was more sensibly felt, when every
vice was inflamed by faction at home and dominion abroad. In the time of
Cicero, each private citizen enjoyed the privilege of anarchy; each
minister of the republic was exalted to the temptations of regal power,
and their virtues are entitled to the warmest praise, as the spontaneous
fruits of nature or philosophy. After a triennial indulgence of lust,
rapine, and cruelty, Verres, the tyrant of Sicily, could only be sued
for the pecuniary restitution of three hundred thousand pounds sterling;
and such was the temper of the laws, the judges, and perhaps the accuser
himself,  <span id="fr_831"></span>[183](#fn_831.md) that, on refunding a
thirteenth part of his plunder, Verres could retire to an easy and
luxurious exile.  <span id="fr_832"></span>[184](#fn_832.md)

The first imperfect attempt to restore the proportion of crimes and
punishments was made by the dictator Sylla, who, in the midst of his
sanguinary triumph, aspired to restrain the license, rather than to
oppress the liberty, of the Romans. He gloried in the arbitrary
proscription of four thousand seven hundred citizens.  <span
id="fr_833"></span>[185](#fn_833.md) But, in the character of a legislator,
he respected the prejudices of the times; and, instead of pronouncing a
sentence of death against the robber or assassin, the general who
betrayed an army, or the magistrate who ruined a province, Sylla was
content to aggravate the pecuniary damages by the penalty of exile, or,
in more constitutional language, by the interdiction of fire and water.
The Cornelian, and afterwards the Pompeian and Julian, laws introduced a
new system of criminal jurisprudence;  <span
id="fr_834"></span>[186](#fn_834.md) and the emperors, from Augustus to
Justinian, disguised their increasing rigor under the names of the
original authors. But the invention and frequent use of extraordinary
pains proceeded from the desire to extend and conceal the progress of
despotism. In the condemnation of illustrious Romans, the senate was
always prepared to confound, at the will of their masters, the judicial
and legislative powers. It was the duty of the governors to maintain the
peace of their province, by the arbitrary and rigid administration of
justice; the freedom of the city evaporated in the extent of empire, and
the Spanish malefactor, who claimed the privilege of a Roman, was
elevated by the command of Galba on a fairer and more lofty cross.
 <span id="fr_835"></span>[187](#fn_835.md) Occasional rescripts issued
from the throne to decide the questions which, by their novelty or
importance, appeared to surpass the authority and discernment of a
proconsul. Transportation and beheading were reserved for honorable
persons; meaner criminals were either hanged, or burnt, or buried in the
mines, or exposed to the wild beasts of the amphitheatre. Armed robbers
were pursued and extirpated as the enemies of society; the driving away
horses or cattle was made a capital offence;  <span
id="fr_836"></span>[188](#fn_836.md) but simple theft was uniformly
considered as a mere civil and private injury. The degrees of guilt, and
the modes of punishment, were too often determined by the discretion of
the rulers, and the subject was left in ignorance of the legal danger
which he might incur by every action of his life.

A sin, a vice, a crime, are the objects of theology, ethics, and
jurisprudence. Whenever their judgments agree, they corroborate each
other; but, as often as they differ, a prudent legislator appreciates
the guilt and punishment according to the measure of social injury. On
this principle, the most daring attack on the life and property of a
private citizen is judged less atrocious than the crime of treason or
rebellion, which invades the majesty of the republic: the obsequious
civilians unanimously pronounced, that the republic is contained in the
person of its chief; and the edge of the Julian law was sharpened by the
incessant diligence of the emperors. The licentious commerce of the
sexes may be tolerated as an impulse of nature, or forbidden as a source
of disorder and corruption; but the fame, the fortunes, the family of
the husband, are seriously injured by the adultery of the wife. The
wisdom of Augustus, after curbing the freedom of revenge, applied to
this domestic offence the animadversion of the laws: and the guilty
parties, after the payment of heavy forfeitures and fines, were
condemned to long or perpetual exile in two separate islands.  <span
id="fr_837"></span>[189](#fn_837.md) Religion pronounces an equal censure
against the infidelity of the husband; but, as it is not accompanied by
the same civil effects, the wife was never permitted to vindicate her
wrongs;  <span id="fr_838"></span>[190](#fn_838.md) and the distinction of
simple or double adultery, so familiar and so important in the canon
law, is unknown to the jurisprudence of the Code and the Pandects. I
touch with reluctance, and despatch with impatience, a more odious vice,
of which modesty rejects the name, and nature abominates the idea. The
primitive Romans were infected by the example of the Etruscans  <span
id="fr_839"></span>[191](#fn_839.md) and Greeks:  <span
id="fr_840"></span>[192](#fn_840.md) and in the mad abuse of prosperity and
power, every pleasure that is innocent was deemed insipid; and the
Scatinian law,  <span id="fr_841"></span>[193](#fn_841.md) which had been
extorted by an act of violence, was insensibly abolished by the lapse of
time and the multitude of criminals. By this law, the rape, perhaps the
seduction, of an ingenuous youth, was compensated, as a personal injury,
by the poor damages of ten thousand sesterces, or fourscore pounds; the
ravisher might be slain by the resistance or revenge of chastity; and I
wish to believe, that at Rome, as in Athens, the voluntary and
effeminate deserter of his sex was degraded from the honors and the
rights of a citizen.  <span id="fr_842"></span>[194](#fn_842.md) But the
practice of vice was not discouraged by the severity of opinion: the
indelible stain of manhood was confounded with the more venial
transgressions of fornication and adultery, nor was the licentious lover
exposed to the same dishonor which he impressed on the male or female
partner of his guilt. From Catullus to Juvenal,  <span
id="fr_843"></span>[195](#fn_843.md) the poets accuse and celebrate the
degeneracy of the times; and the reformation of manners was feebly
attempted by the reason and authority of the civilians till the most
virtuous of the Caesars proscribed the sin against nature as a crime
against society.  <span id="fr_844"></span>[196](#fn_844.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_806"></span>[159](daf04028.htm#fr_806.md) How much is the
cool, rational evidence of Polybius (l. vi. p. 693, l. xxxi. p. 1459,
1460) superior to vague, indiscriminate applause - omnium maxime et
praecipue fidem coluit, (A. Gellius, xx. l.)

<span id="fn_807"></span>[160](daf04028.htm#fr_807.md) The Jus Praetorium
de Pactis et Transactionibus is a separate and satisfactory treatise of
Gerard Noodt, (Opp. tom. i. p. 483 - 564.) And I will here observe, that
the universities of Holland and Brandenburg, in the beginning of the
present century, appear to have studied the civil law on the most just
and liberal principles.

Note: Simple agreements (pacta) formed as valid an obligation as a
solemn contract. Only an action, or the right to a direct judicial
prosecution, was not permitted in every case of compact. In all other
respects, the judge was bound to maintain an agreement made by pactum.
The stipulation was a form common to every kind of agreement, by which
the right of action was given to this. - W.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[161](daf04028.htm#fr_808.md) The nice and various
subject of contracts by consent is spread over four books (xvii. - xx.)
of the Pandects, and is one of the parts best deserving of the attention
of an English student.

Note: This is erroneously called "benefits." Gibbon enumerates various
kinds of contracts, of which some alone are properly called benefits. -
W.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[162](daf04028.htm#fr_809.md) The covenants of
rent are defined in the Pandects (l. xix.) and the Code, (l. iv. tit.
lxv.) The quinquennium, or term of five years, appears to have been a
custom rather than a law; but in France all leases of land were
determined in nine years. This limitation was removed only in the year
1775, (Encyclopedie Methodique, tom. i. de la Jurisprudence, p. 668,
669;) and I am sorry to observe that it yet prevails in the beauteous
and happy country where I am permitted to reside.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[163](daf04028.htm#fr_810.md) I might implicitly
acquiesce in the sense and learning of the three books of G. Noodt, de
foenore et usuris. (Opp. tom. i. p. 175 - 268.) The interpretation of
the asses or centesimoe usuroe at twelve, the unciarioe at one per
cent., is maintained by the best critics and civilians: Noodt, (l. ii.
c. 2, p. 207,) Gravina, (Opp. p. 205, &c., 210,) Heineccius,
(Antiquitat. ad Institut. l. iii. tit. xv.,) Montesquieu, (Esprit des
Loix, l. xxii. c. 22, tom. ii. p. 36. Defense de l'Esprit des Loix, tom.
iii. p. 478, &c.,) and above all, John Frederic Gronovius (de Pecunia
Veteri, l. iii. c. 13, p. 213 - 227, and his three Antexegeses, p. 455 -
655, the founder, or at least the champion, of this probable opinion;
which is, however, perplexed with some difficulties.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[164](daf04028.htm#fr_811.md) Primo xii. Tabulis
sancitum est ne quis unciario foenore amplius exerceret, (Tacit. Annal.
vi. 16.) Pour peu (says Montesquieu, Esprit des Loix, l. xxii. 22) qu'on
soit verse dans l'histoire de Rome, on verra qu'une pareille loi ne
devoit pas etre l'ouvrage des decemvirs. Was Tacitus ignorant - or
stupid? But the wiser and more virtuous patricians might sacrifice their
avarice to their ambition, and might attempt to check the odious
practice by such interest as no lender would accept, and such penalties
as no debtor would incur.

Note: The real nature of the foenus unciarium has been proved; it
amounted in a year of twelve months to ten per cent. See, in the
Magazine for Civil Law, by M. Hugo, vol. v. p. 180, 184, an article of
M. Schrader, following up the conjectures of Niebuhr, Hist. Rom. tom.
ii. p. 431. - W. Compare a very clear account of this question in the
appendix to Mr. Travers Twiss's Epitome of Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 257. -
M.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[165](daf04028.htm#fr_812.md) Justinian has not
condescended to give usury a place in his Institutes; but the necessary
rules and restrictions are inserted in the Pandects (l. xxii. tit. i.
ii.) and the Code, (l. iv. tit. xxxii. xxxiii.)

<span id="fn_813"></span>[166](daf04028.htm#fr_813.md) The Fathers are
unanimous, (Barbeyrac, Morale des Peres, p. 144. &c.:) Cyprian,
Lactantius, Basil, Chrysostom, (see his frivolous arguments in Noodt, l.
i. c. 7, p. 188,) Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, Jerom, Augustin, and a host
of councils and casuists.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[167](daf04028.htm#fr_814.md) Cato, Seneca,
Plutarch, have loudly condemned the practice or abuse of usury.
According to the etymology of foenus, the principal is supposed to
generate the interest: a breed of barren metal, exclaims Shakespeare -
and the stage is the echo of the public voice.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[168](daf04028.htm#fr_815.md) Sir William Jones
has given an ingenious and rational Essay on the law of Bailment,
(London, 1781, p. 127, in 8vo.) He is perhaps the only lawyer equally
conversant with the year-books of Westminster, the Commentaries of
Ulpian, the Attic pleadings of Isaeus, and the sentences of Arabian and
Persian cadhis.

<span id="fn_816"></span>[169](daf04028.htm#fr_816.md) Noodt (Opp. tom. i.
p. 137 - 172) has composed a separate treatise, ad Legem Aquilian,
(Pandect. l. ix. tit. ii.)

<span id="fn_817"></span>[170](daf04028.htm#fr_817.md) Aulus Gellius (Noct.
Attic. xx. i.) borrowed this story from the Commentaries of Q. Labeo on
the xii. tables.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[171](daf04028.htm#fr_818.md) The narrative of
Livy (i. 28) is weighty and solemn. At tu, Albane, maneres, is a harsh
reflection, unworthy of Virgil's humanity, (Aeneid, viii. 643.) Heyne,
with his usual good taste, observes that the subject was too horrid for
the shield of Aencas, (tom. iii. p. 229.)

<span id="fn_819"></span>[172](daf04028.htm#fr_819.md) The age of Draco
(Olympiad xxxix. l) is fixed by Sir John Marsham (Canon Chronicus, p.
593 - 596) and Corsini, (Fasti Attici, tom. iii. p. 62.) For his laws,
see the writers on the government of Athens, Sigonius, Meursius, Potter,
&c.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[173](daf04028.htm#fr_820.md) The viith, de
delictis, of the xii. tables is delineated by Gravina, (Opp. p. 292,
293, with a commentary, p. 214 - 230.) Aulus Gellius (xx. 1) and the
Collatio Legum Mosaicarum et Romanarum afford much original information.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[174](daf04028.htm#fr_821.md) Livy mentions two
remarkable and flagitious aeras, of 3000 persons accused, and of 190
noble matrons convicted, of the crime of poisoning, (xl. 43, viii. 18.)
Mr. Hume discriminates the ages of private and public virtue, (Essays,
vol. i. p. 22, 23.) I would rather say that such ebullitions of mischief
(as in France in the year 1680) are accidents and prodigies which leave
no marks on the manners of a nation.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[175](daf04028.htm#fr_822.md) The xii. tables and
Cicero (pro Roscio Amerino, c. 25, 26) are content with the sack; Seneca
(Excerpt. Controvers. v 4) adorns it with serpents; Juvenal pities the
guiltless monkey (innoxia simia - 156.) Adrian (apud Dositheum
Magistrum, l. iii. c. p. 874 - 876, with Schulting's Note,) Modestinus,
(Pandect. xlviii. tit. ix. leg. 9,) Constantine, (Cod. l. ix. tit.
xvii.,) and Justinian, (Institut. l. iv. tit. xviii.,) enumerate all the
companions of the parricide. But this fanciful execution was simplified
in practice. Hodie tamen viv exuruntur vel ad bestias dantur, (Paul.
Sentent. Recept. l. v. tit. xxiv p. 512, edit. Schulting.)

<span id="fn_823"></span>[176](daf04028.htm#fr_823.md) The first parricide
at Rome was L. Ostius, after the second Punic war, (Plutarch, in Romulo,
tom. i. p. 54.) During the Cimbric, P. Malleolus was guilty of the first
matricide, (Liv. Epitom. l. lxviii.)

<span id="fn_824"></span>[177](daf04028.htm#fr_824.md) Horace talks of the
formidine fustis, (l. ii. epist. ii. 154,) but Cicero (de Republica, l.
iv. apud Augustin. de Civitat. Dei, ix. 6, in Fragment. Philosoph. tom.
iii. p. 393, edit. Olivet) affirms that the decemvirs made libels a
capital offence: cum perpaucas res capite sanxisent - perpaucus!

<span id="fn_825"></span>[178](daf04028.htm#fr_825.md) Bynkershoek
(Observat. Juris Rom. l. i. c. 1, in Opp. tom. i. p. 9, 10, 11) labors
to prove that the creditors divided not the body, but the price, of the
insolvent debtor. Yet his interpretation is one perpetual harsh
metaphor; nor can he surmount the Roman authorities of Quintilian,
Caecilius, Favonius, and Tertullian. See Aulus Gellius, Noct. Attic.
xxi.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[\*\_0059](daf04028.htm#fr_826.md) Hugo (Histoire
du Droit Romain, tom. i. p. 234) concurs with Gibbon See Niebuhr, vol.
ii. p. 313. - M.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[179](daf04028.htm#fr_827.md) The first speech of
Lysias (Reiske, Orator. Graec. tom. v. p. 2 - 48) is in defence of a
husband who had killed the adulterer. The rights of husbands and fathers
at Rome and Athens are discussed with much learning by Dr. Taylor,
(Lectiones Lysiacae, c. xi. in Reiske, tom. vi. p. 301 - 308.)

<span id="fn_828"></span>[180](daf04028.htm#fr_828.md) See Casaubon ad
Athenaeum, l. i. c. 5, p. 19. Percurrent raphanique mugilesque, (Catull.
p. 41, 42, edit. Vossian.) Hunc mugilis intrat, (Juvenal. Satir. x.
317.) Hunc perminxere calones, (Horat l. i. Satir. ii. 44.) Familiae
stuprandum dedit . . fraudi non fuit, (Val. Maxim. l. vi. c. l, No. 13.)

<span id="fn_829"></span>[181](daf04028.htm#fr_829.md) This law is noticed
by Livy (ii. 8) and Plutarch, (in Publiccla, tom. i. p. 187,) and it
fully justifies the public opinion on the death of Caesar which
Suetonius could publish under the Imperial government. Jure caesus
existimatur, (in Julio, c. 76.) Read the letters that passed between
Cicero and Matius a few months after the ides of March (ad Fam. xi. 27,
28.)

<span id="fn_830"></span>[182](daf04028.htm#fr_830.md) Thucydid. l. i. c. 6
The historian who considers this circumstance as the test of
civilization, would disdain the barbarism of a European court

<span id="fn_831"></span>[183](daf04028.htm#fr_831.md) He first rated at
millies (800,000l.) the damages of Sicily, (Divinatio in Caecilium, c.
5,) which he afterwards reduced to quadringenties, (320,000l. - 1 Actio
in Verrem, c. 18,) and was finally content with tricies, (24,000l.)
Plutarch (in Ciceron. tom. iii. p. 1584) has not dissembled the popular
suspicion and report.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[184](daf04028.htm#fr_832.md) Verres lived near
thirty years after his trial, till the second triumvirate, when he was
proscribed by the taste of Mark Antony for the sake of his Corinthian
plate, (Plin. Hist. Natur. xxxiv. 3.)

<span id="fn_833"></span>[185](daf04028.htm#fr_833.md) Such is the number
assigned by Valer'us Maximus, (l. ix. c. 2, No. 1,) Florus (iv. 21)
distinguishes 2000 senators and knights. Appian (de Bell. Civil. l. i.
c. 95, tom. ii. p. 133, edit. Schweighauser) more accurately computes
forty victims of the senatorian rank, and 1600 of the equestrian census
or order.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[186](daf04028.htm#fr_834.md) For the penal laws
(Leges Corneliae, Pompeiae, Julae, of Sylla, Pompey, and the Caesars)
see the sentences of Paulus, (l. iv. tit. xviii. - xxx. p. 497 - 528,
edit. Schulting,) the Gregorian Code, (Fragment. l. xix. p. 705, 706, in
Schulting,) the Collatio Legum Mosaicarum et Romanarum, (tit. i. - xv.,)
the Theodosian Code, (l. ix.,) the Code of Justinian, (l. ix.,) the
Pandects, (xlviii.,) the Institutes, (l. iv. tit. xviii.,) and the Greek
version of Theophilus, (p. 917 - 926.)

<span id="fn_835"></span>[187](daf04028.htm#fr_835.md) It was a guardian
who had poisoned his ward. The crime was atrocious: yet the punishment
is reckoned by Suetonius (c. 9) among the acts in which Galba showed
himself acer, vehemens, et in delictis coercendis immodicus.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[188](daf04028.htm#fr_836.md) The abactores or
abigeatores, who drove one horse, or two mares or oxen, or five hogs, or
ten goats, were subject to capital punishment, (Paul, Sentent. Recept.
l. iv. tit. xviii. p. 497, 498.) Hadrian, (ad Concil. Baeticae,) most
severe where the offence was most frequent, condemns the criminals, ad
gladium, ludi damnationem, (Ulpian, de Officio Proconsulis, l. viii. in
Collatione Legum Mosaic. et Rom. tit. xi p. 235.)

<span id="fn_837"></span>[189](daf04028.htm#fr_837.md) Till the publication
of the Julius Paulus of Schulting, (l. ii. tit. xxvi. p. 317 - 323,) it
was affirmed and believed that the Julian laws punished adultery with
death; and the mistake arose from the fraud or error of Tribonian. Yet
Lipsius had suspected the truth from the narratives of Tacitus, (Annal.
ii. 50, iii. 24, iv. 42,) and even from the practice of Augustus, who
distinguished the treasonable frailties of his female kindred.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[190](daf04028.htm#fr_838.md) In cases of
adultery, Severus confined to the husband the right of public
accusation, (Cod. Justinian, l. ix. tit. ix. leg. 1.) Nor is this
privilege unjust - so different are the effects of male or female
infidelity.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[191](daf04028.htm#fr_839) Timon (l. i..md) and
Theopompus (l. xliii. apud Athenaeum, l. xii. p. 517) describe the
luxury and lust of the Etruscans. About the same period (A. U. C. 445)
the Roman youth studied in Etruria, (liv. ix. 36.)

<span id="fn_840"></span>[192](daf04028.htm#fr_840.md) The Persians had
been corrupted in the same school, (Herodot. l. i. c. 135.) A curious
dissertation might be formed on the introduction of paederasty after the
time of Homer, its progress among the Greeks of Asia and Europe, the
vehemence of their passions, and the thin device of virtue and
friendship which amused the philosophers of Athens. But scelera ostendi
oportet dum puniuntur, abscondi flagitia.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[193](daf04028.htm#fr_841.md) The name, the date,
and the provisions of this law are equally doubtful, (Gravina, Opp. p.
432, 433. Heineccius, Hist. Jur. Rom. No. 108. Ernesti, Clav. Ciceron.
in Indice Legum.) But I will observe that the nefanda Venus of the
honest German is styled aversa by the more polite Italian.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[194](daf04028.htm#fr_842.md) See the oration of
Aeschines against the catamite Timarchus, (in Reiske, Orator. Graec.
tom. iii. p. 21 - 184.)

<span id="fn_843"></span>[195](daf04028.htm#fr_843.md) A crowd of
disgraceful passages will force themselves on the memory of the classic
reader: I will only remind him of the cool declaration of Ovid: -

Odi concubitus qui non utrumque resolvant. Hoc est quod puerum tangar
amore minus.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[196](daf04028.htm#fr_844.md) Aelius Lampridius,
in Vit. Heliogabal. in Hist. August p. 112 Aurelius Victor, in Philippo,
Codex Theodos. l. ix. tit. vii. leg. 7, and Godefroy's Commentary, tom.
iii. p. 63. Theodosius abolished the subterraneous brothels of Rome, in
which the prostitution of both sexes was acted with impunity.
