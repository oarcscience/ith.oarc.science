### Chapter XL: Reign Of Justinian. Part V.

If we extend our view from the tropic to the mouth of the Tanais, we may
observe, on one hand, the precautions of Justinian to curb the savages
of Aethiopia,  <span id="fr_255"></span>[125](#fn_255.md) and on the other,
the long walls which he constructed in Crimaea for the protection of his
friendly Goths, a colony of three thousand shepherds and warriors.
 <span id="fr_256"></span>[126](#fn_256.md) From that peninsula to
Trebizond, the eastern curve of the Euxine was secured by forts, by
alliance, or by religion; and the possession of Lazica, the Colchos of
ancient, the Mingrelia of modern, geography, soon became the object of
an important war. Trebizond, in after- times the seat of a romantic
empire, was indebted to the liberality of Justinian for a church, an
aqueduct, and a castle, whose ditches are hewn in the solid rock. From
that maritime city, frontier line of five hundred miles may be drawn to
the fortress of Circesium, the last Roman station on the Euphrates.
 <span id="fr_257"></span>[127](#fn_257.md) Above Trebizond immediately,
and five days' journey to the south, the country rises into dark forests
and craggy mountains, as savage though not so lofty as the Alps and the
Pyrenees. In this rigorous climate,  <span
id="fr_258"></span>[128](#fn_258.md) where the snows seldom melt, the
fruits are tardy and tasteless, even honey is poisonous: the most
industrious tillage would be confined to some pleasant valleys; and the
pastoral tribes obtained a scanty sustenance from the flesh and milk of
their cattle. The Chalybians  <span id="fr_259"></span>[129](#fn_259.md)
derived their name and temper from the iron quality of the soil; and,
since the days of Cyrus, they might produce, under the various
appellations of Cha daeans and Zanians, an uninterrupted prescription of
war and rapine. Under the reign of Justinian, they acknowledged the god
and the emperor of the Romans, and seven fortresses were built in the
most accessible passages, to exclude the ambition of the Persian
monarch.  <span id="fr_260"></span>[130](#fn_260.md) The principal source
of the Euphrates descends from the Chalybian mountains, and seems to
flow towards the west and the Euxine: bending to the south-west, the
river passes under the walls of Satala and Melitene, (which were
restored by Justinian as the bulwarks of the Lesser Armenia,) and
gradually approaches the Mediterranean Sea; till at length, repelled by
Mount Taurus,  <span id="fr_261"></span>[131](#fn_261.md) the Euphrates
inclines its long and flexible course to the south-east and the Gulf of
Persia. Among the Roman cities beyond the Euphrates, we distinguish two
recent foundations, which were named from Theodosius, and the relics of
the martyrs; and two capitals, Amida and Edessa, which are celebrated in
the history of every age. Their strength was proportioned by Justinian
to the danger of their situation. A ditch and palisade might be
sufficient to resist the artless force of the cavalry of Scythia; but
more elaborate works were required to sustain a regular siege against
the arms and treasures of the great king. His skilful engineers
understood the methods of conducting deep mines, and of raising
platforms to the level of the rampart: he shook the strongest
battlements with his military engines, and sometimes advanced to the
assault with a line of movable turrets on the backs of elephants. In the
great cities of the East, the disadvantage of space, perhaps of
position, was compensated by the zeal of the people, who seconded the
garrison in the defence of their country and religion; and the fabulous
promise of the Son of God, that Edessa should never be taken, filled the
citizens with valiant confidence, and chilled the besiegers with doubt
and dismay.  <span id="fr_262"></span>[132](#fn_262.md) The subordinate
towns of Armenia and Mesopotamia were diligently strengthened, and the
posts which appeared to have any command of ground or water were
occupied by numerous forts, substantially built of stone, or more
hastily erected with the obvious materials of earth and brick. The eye
of Justinian investigated every spot; and his cruel precautions might
attract the war into some lonely vale, whose peaceful natives, connected
by trade and marriage, were ignorant of national discord and the
quarrels of princes. Westward of the Euphrates, a sandy desert extends
above six hundred miles to the Red Sea. Nature had interposed a vacant
solitude between the ambition of two rival empires; the Arabians, till
Mahomet arose, were formidable only as robbers; and in the proud
security of peace the fortifications of Syria were neglected on the most
vulnerable side.

But the national enmity, at least the effects of that enmity, had been
suspended by a truce, which continued above fourscore years. An
ambassador from the emperor Zeno accompanied the rash and unfortunate
Perozes,  <span id="fr_263"></span>[\*\_0015](#fn_263.md) in his expedition
against the Nepthalites,  <span id="fr_264"></span>[!\_0015](#fn_264.md) or
white Huns, whose conquests had been stretched from the Caspian to the
heart of India, whose throne was enriched with emeralds,  <span
id="fr_265"></span>[133](#fn_265.md) and whose cavalry was supported by a
line of two thousand elephants.  <span id="fr_266"></span>[134](#fn_266.md)
The Persians  <span id="fr_267"></span>[\*\*\_0015](#fn_267.md) were twice
circumvented, in a situation which made valor useless and flight
impossible; and the double victory of the Huns was achieved by military
stratagem. They dismissed their royal captive after he had submitted to
adore the majesty of a Barbarian; and the humiliation was poorly evaded
by the casuistical subtlety of the Magi, who instructed Perozes to
direct his attention to the rising sun.  <span
id="fr_268"></span>[!!\_0015](#fn_268.md) The indignant successor of Cyrus
forgot his danger and his gratitude; he renewed the attack with
headstrong fury, and lost both his army and his life.  <span
id="fr_269"></span>[135](#fn_269.md) The death of Perozes abandoned Persia
to her foreign and domestic enemies;  <span
id="fr_270"></span>[!!!\_0015](#fn_270.md) and twelve years of confusion
elapsed before his son Cabades, or Kobad, could embrace any designs of
ambition or revenge. The unkind parsimony of Anastasius was the motive
or pretence of a Roman war;  <span id="fr_271"></span>[136](#fn_271.md) the
Huns and Arabs marched under the Persian standard, and the
fortifications of Armenia and Mesopotamia were, at that time, in a
ruinous or imperfect condition. The emperor returned his thanks to the
governor and people of Martyropolis for the prompt surrender of a city
which could not be successfully defended, and the conflagration of
Theodosiopolis might justify the conduct of their prudent neighbors.
Amida sustained a long and destructive siege: at the end of three months
the loss of fifty thousand of the soldiers of Cabades was not balanced
by any prospect of success, and it was in vain that the Magi deduced a
flattering prediction from the indecency of the women  <span
id="fr_272"></span>[\*\*\*\_0015](#fn_272.md) on the ramparts, who had
revealed their most secret charms to the eyes of the assailants. At
length, in a silent night, they ascended the most accessible tower,
which was guarded only by some monks, oppressed, after the duties of a
festival, with sleep and wine. Scaling-ladders were applied at the dawn
of day; the presence of Cabades, his stern command, and his drawn sword,
compelled the Persians to vanquish; and before it was sheathed,
fourscore thousand of the inhabitants had expiated the blood of their
companions. After the siege of Amida, the war continued three years, and
the unhappy frontier tasted the full measure of its calamities. The gold
of Anastasius was offered too late, the number of his troops was
defeated by the number of their generals; the country was stripped of
its inhabitants, and both the living and the dead were abandoned to the
wild beasts of the desert. The resistance of Edessa, and the deficiency
of spoil, inclined the mind of Cabades to peace: he sold his conquests
for an exorbitant price; and the same line, though marked with slaughter
and devastation, still separated the two empires. To avert the
repetition of the same evils, Anastasius resolved to found a new colony,
so strong, that it should defy the power of the Persian, so far advanced
towards Assyria, that its stationary troops might defend the province by
the menace or operation of offensive war. For this purpose, the town of
Dara,  <span id="fr_273"></span>[137](#fn_273.md) fourteen miles from
Nisibis, and four days' journey from the Tigris, was peopled and
adorned; the hasty works of Anastasius were improved by the perseverance
of Justinian; and, without insisting on places less important, the
fortifications of Dara may represent the military architecture of the
age. The city was surrounded with two walls, and the interval between
them, of fifty paces, afforded a retreat to the cattle of the besieged.
The inner wall was a monument of strength and beauty: it measured sixty
feet from the ground, and the height of the towers was one hundred feet;
the loopholes, from whence an enemy might be annoyed with missile
weapons, were small, but numerous; the soldiers were planted along the
rampart, under the shelter of double galleries, and a third platform,
spacious and secure, was raised on the summit of the towers. The
exterior wall appears to have been less lofty, but more solid; and each
tower was protected by a quadrangular bulwark. A hard, rocky soil
resisted the tools of the miners, and on the south-east, where the
ground was more tractable, their approach was retarded by a new work,
which advanced in the shape of a half-moon. The double and treble
ditches were filled with a stream of water; and in the management of the
river, the most skilful labor was employed to supply the inhabitants, to
distress the besiegers, and to prevent the mischiefs of a natural or
artificial inundation. Dara continued more than sixty years to fulfil
the wishes of its founders, and to provoke the jealousy of the Persians,
who incessantly complained, that this impregnable fortress had been
constructed in manifest violation of the treaty of peace between the two
empires.  <span id="fr_274"></span>[\*\*\*\*\_0015](#fn_274.md)

Between the Euxine and the Caspian, the countries of Colchos, Iberia,
and Albania, are intersected in every direction by the branches of Mount
Caucasus; and the two principal gates, or passes, from north to south,
have been frequently confounded in the geography both of the ancients
and moderns. The name of Caspian or Albanian gates is properly applied
to Derbend,  <span id="fr_275"></span>[138](#fn_275.md) which occupies a
short declivity between the mountains and the sea: the city, if we give
credit to local tradition, had been founded by the Greeks; and this
dangerous entrance was fortified by the kings of Persia with a mole,
double walls, and doors of iron. The Iberian gates  <span
id="fr_276"></span>[139](#fn_276.md)  <span
id="fr_277"></span>[\*\_0016](#fn_277.md) are formed by a narrow passage of
six miles in Mount Caucasus, which opens from the northern side of
Iberia, or Georgia, into the plain that reaches to the Tanais and the
Volga. A fortress, designed by Alexander perhaps, or one of his
successors, to command that important pass, had descended by right of
conquest or inheritance to a prince of the Huns, who offered it for a
moderate price to the emperor; but while Anastasius paused, while he
timorously computed the cost and the distance, a more vigilant rival
interposed, and Cabades forcibly occupied the Straits of Caucasus. The
Albanian and Iberian gates excluded the horsemen of Scythia from the
shortest and most practicable roads, and the whole front of the
mountains was covered by the rampart of Gog and Magog, the long wall
which has excited the curiosity of an Arabian caliph  <span
id="fr_278"></span>[140](#fn_278.md) and a Russian conqueror.  <span
id="fr_279"></span>[141](#fn_279.md) According to a recent description,
huge stones, seven feet thick, and twenty-one feet in length or height,
are artificially joined without iron or cement, to compose a wall, which
runs above three hundred miles from the shores of Derbend, over the
hills, and through the valleys of Daghestan and Georgia. Without a
vision, such a work might be undertaken by the policy of Cabades;
without a miracle, it might be accomplished by his son, so formidable to
the Romans, under the name of Chosroes; so dear to the Orientals, under
the appellation of Nushirwan. The Persian monarch held in his hand the
keys both of peace and war; but he stipulated, in every treaty, that
Justinian should contribute to the expense of a common barrier, which
equally protected the two empires from the inroads of the Scythians.
 <span id="fr_280"></span>[142](#fn_280.md)

VII\. Justinian suppressed the schools of Athens and the consulship of
Rome, which had given so many sages and heroes to mankind. Both these
institutions had long since degenerated from their primitive glory; yet
some reproach may be justly inflicted on the avarice and jealousy of a
prince, by whose hand such venerable ruins were destroyed.

Athens, after her Persian triumphs, adopted the philosophy of Ionia and
the rhetoric of Sicily; and these studies became the patrimony of a
city, whose inhabitants, about thirty thousand males, condensed, within
the period of a single life, the genius of ages and millions. Our sense
of the dignity of human nature is exalted by the simple recollection,
that Isocrates  <span id="fr_281"></span>[143](#fn_281.md) was the
companion of Plato and Xenophon; that he assisted, perhaps with the
historian Thucydides, at the first representation of the Oedipus of
Sophocles and the Iphigenia of Euripides; and that his pupils Aeschines
and Demosthenes contended for the crown of patriotism in the presence of
Aristotle, the master of Theophrastus, who taught at Athens with the
founders of the Stoic and Epicurean sects.  <span
id="fr_282"></span>[144](#fn_282.md) The ingenuous youth of Attica enjoyed
the benefits of their domestic education, which was communicated without
envy to the rival cities. Two thousand disciples heard the lessons of
Theophrastus;  <span id="fr_283"></span>[145](#fn_283.md) the schools of
rhetoric must have been still more populous than those of philosophy;
and a rapid succession of students diffused the fame of their teachers
as far as the utmost limits of the Grecian language and name. Those
limits were enlarged by the victories of Alexander; the arts of Athens
survived her freedom and dominion; and the Greek colonies which the
Macedonians planted in Egypt, and scattered over Asia, undertook long
and frequent pilgrimages to worship the Muses in their favorite temple
on the banks of the Ilissus. The Latin conquerors respectfully listened
to the instructions of their subjects and captives; the names of Cicero
and Horace were enrolled in the schools of Athens; and after the perfect
settlement of the Roman empire, the natives of Italy, of Africa, and of
Britain, conversed in the groves of the academy with their
fellow-students of the East. The studies of philosophy and eloquence are
congenial to a popular state, which encourages the freedom of inquiry,
and submits only to the force of persuasion. In the republics of Greece
and Rome, the art of speaking was the powerful engine of patriotism or
ambition; and the schools of rhetoric poured forth a colony of statesmen
and legislators. When the liberty of public debate was suppressed, the
orator, in the honorable profession of an advocate, might plead the
cause of innocence and justice; he might abuse his talents in the more
profitable trade of panegyric; and the same precepts continued to
dictate the fanciful declamations of the sophist, and the chaster
beauties of historical composition. The systems which professed to
unfold the nature of God, of man, and of the universe, entertained the
curiosity of the philosophic student; and according to the temper of his
mind, he might doubt with the Sceptics, or decide with the Stoics,
sublimely speculate with Plato, or severely argue with Aristotle. The
pride of the adverse sects had fixed an unattainable term of moral
happiness and perfection; but the race was glorious and salutary; the
disciples of Zeno, and even those of Epicurus, were taught both to act
and to suffer; and the death of Petronius was not less effectual than
that of Seneca, to humble a tyrant by the discovery of his impotence.
The light of science could not indeed be confined within the walls of
Athens. Her incomparable writers address themselves to the human race;
the living masters emigrated to Italy and Asia; Berytus, in later times,
was devoted to the study of the law; astronomy and physic were
cultivated in the musaeum of Alexandria; but the Attic schools of
rhetoric and philosophy maintained their superior reputation from the
Peloponnesian war to the reign of Justinian. Athens, though situate in a
barren soil, possessed a pure air, a free navigation, and the monuments
of ancient art. That sacred retirement was seldom disturbed by the
business of trade or government; and the last of the Athenians were
distinguished by their lively wit, the purity of their taste and
language, their social manners, and some traces, at least in discourse,
of the magnanimity of their fathers. In the suburbs of the city, the
academy of the Platonists, the lycaeum of the Peripatetics, the portico
of the Stoics, and the garden of the Epicureans, were planted with trees
and decorated with statues; and the philosophers, instead of being
immured in a cloister, delivered their instructions in spacious and
pleasant walks, which, at different hours, were consecrated to the
exercises of the mind and body. The genius of the founders still lived
in those venerable seats; the ambition of succeeding to the masters of
human reason excited a generous emulation; and the merit of the
candidates was determined, on each vacancy, by the free voices of an
enlightened people. The Athenian professors were paid by their
disciples: according to their mutual wants and abilities, the price
appears to have varied; and Isocrates himself, who derides the avarice
of the sophists, required, in his school of rhetoric, about thirty
pounds from each of his hundred pupils. The wages of industry are just
and honorable, yet the same Isocrates shed tears at the first receipt of
a stipend: the Stoic might blush when he was hired to preach the
contempt of money; and I should be sorry to discover that Aristotle or
Plato so far degenerated from the example of Socrates, as to exchange
knowledge for gold. But some property of lands and houses was settled by
the permission of the laws, and the legacies of deceased friends, on the
philosophic chairs of Athens. Epicurus bequeathed to his disciples the
gardens which he had purchased for eighty minae or two hundred and fifty
pounds, with a fund sufficient for their frugal subsistence and monthly
festivals;  <span id="fr_284"></span>[146](#fn_284.md) and the patrimony of
Plato afforded an annual rent, which, in eight centuries, was gradually
increased from three to one thousand pieces of gold.  <span
id="fr_285"></span>[147](#fn_285.md) The schools of Athens were protected
by the wisest and most virtuous of the Roman princes. The library, which
Hadrian founded, was placed in a portico adorned with pictures, statues,
and a roof of alabaster, and supported by one hundred columns of
Phrygian marble. The public salaries were assigned by the generous
spirit of the Antonines; and each professor of politics, of rhetoric, of
the Platonic, the Peripatetic, the Stoic, and the Epicurean philosophy,
received an annual stipend of ten thousand drachmae, or more than three
hundred pounds sterling.  <span id="fr_286"></span>[148](#fn_286.md) After
the death of Marcus, these liberal donations, and the privileges
attached to the thrones of science, were abolished and revived,
diminished and enlarged; but some vestige of royal bounty may be found
under the successors of Constantine; and their arbitrary choice of an
unworthy candidate might tempt the philosophers of Athens to regret the
days of independence and poverty.  <span
id="fr_287"></span>[149](#fn_287.md) It is remarkable, that the impartial
favor of the Antonines was bestowed on the four adverse sects of
philosophy, which they considered as equally useful, or at least, as
equally innocent. Socrates had formerly been the glory and the reproach
of his country; and the first lessons of Epicurus so strangely
scandalized the pious ears of the Athenians, that by his exile, and that
of his antagonists, they silenced all vain disputes concerning the
nature of the gods. But in the ensuing year they recalled the hasty
decree, restored the liberty of the schools, and were convinced by the
experience of ages, that the moral character of philosophers is not
affected by the diversity of their theological speculations.  <span
id="fr_288"></span>[150](#fn_288.md)

The Gothic arms were less fatal to the schools of Athens than the
establishment of a new religion, whose ministers superseded the exercise
of reason, resolved every question by an article of faith, and condemned
the infidel or sceptic to eternal flames. In many a volume of laborious
controversy, they exposed the weakness of the understanding and the
corruption of the heart, insulted human nature in the sages of
antiquity, and proscribed the spirit of philosophical inquiry, so
repugnant to the doctrine, or at least to the temper, of an humble
believer. The surviving sects of the Platonists, whom Plato would have
blushed to acknowledge, extravagantly mingled a sublime theory with the
practice of superstition and magic; and as they remained alone in the
midst of a Christian world, they indulged a secret rancor against the
government of the church and state, whose severity was still suspended
over their heads. About a century after the reign of Julian,  <span
id="fr_289"></span>[151](#fn_289.md) Proclus  <span
id="fr_290"></span>[152](#fn_290.md) was permitted to teach in the
philosophic chair of the academy; and such was his industry, that he
frequently, in the same day, pronounced five lessons, and composed seven
hundred lines. His sagacious mind explored the deepest questions of
morals and metaphysics, and he ventured to urge eighteen arguments
against the Christian doctrine of the creation of the world. But in the
intervals of study, he personally conversed with Pan, Aesculapius, and
Minerva, in whose mysteries he was secretly initiated, and whose
prostrate statues he adored; in the devout persuasion that the
philosopher, who is a citizen of the universe, should be the priest of
its various deities. An eclipse of the sun announced his approaching
end; and his life, with that of his scholar Isidore,  <span
id="fr_291"></span>[153](#fn_291.md) compiled by two of their most learned
disciples, exhibits a deplorable picture of the second childhood of
human reason. Yet the golden chain, as it was fondly styled, of the
Platonic succession, continued forty-four years from the death of
Proclus to the edict of Justinian,  <span
id="fr_292"></span>[154](#fn_292.md) which imposed a perpetual silence on
the schools of Athens, and excited the grief and indignation of the few
remaining votaries of Grecian science and superstition. Seven friends
and philosophers, Diogenes and Hermias, Eulalius and Priscian,
Damascius, Isidore, and Simplicius, who dissented from the religion of
their sovereign, embraced the resolution of seeking in a foreign land
the freedom which was denied in their native country. They had heard,
and they credulously believed, that the republic of Plato was realized
in the despotic government of Persia, and that a patriot king reigned
ever the happiest and most virtuous of nations. They were soon
astonished by the natural discovery, that Persia resembled the other
countries of the globe; that Chosroes, who affected the name of a
philosopher, was vain, cruel, and ambitious; that bigotry, and a spirit
of intolerance, prevailed among the Magi; that the nobles were haughty,
the courtiers servile, and the magistrates unjust; that the guilty
sometimes escaped, and that the innocent were often oppressed. The
disappointment of the philosophers provoked them to overlook the real
virtues of the Persians; and they were scandalized, more deeply perhaps
than became their profession, with the plurality of wives and
concubines, the incestuous marriages, and the custom of exposing dead
bodies to the dogs and vultures, instead of hiding them in the earth, or
consuming them with fire. Their repentance was expressed by a
precipitate return, and they loudly declared that they had rather die on
the borders of the empire, than enjoy the wealth and favor of the
Barbarian. From this journey, however, they derived a benefit which
reflects the purest lustre on the character of Chosroes. He required,
that the seven sages who had visited the court of Persia should be
exempted from the penal laws which Justinian enacted against his Pagan
subjects; and this privilege, expressly stipulated in a treaty of peace,
was guarded by the vigilance of a powerful mediator.  <span
id="fr_293"></span>[155](#fn_293.md) Simplicius and his companions ended
their lives in peace and obscurity; and as they left no disciples, they
terminate the long list of Grecian philosophers, who may be justly
praised, notwithstanding their defects, as the wisest and most virtuous
of their contemporaries. The writings of Simplicius are now extant. His
physical and metaphysical commentaries on Aristotle have passed away
with the fashion of the times; but his moral interpretation of Epictetus
is preserved in the library of nations, as a classic book, most
excellently adapted to direct the will, to purify the heart, and to
confirm the understanding, by a just confidence in the nature both of
God and man.

About the same time that Pythagoras first invented the appellation of
philosopher, liberty and the consulship were founded at Rome by the
elder Brutus. The revolutions of the consular office, which may be
viewed in the successive lights of a substance, a shadow, and a name,
have been occasionally mentioned in the present History. The first
magistrates of the republic had been chosen by the people, to exercise,
in the senate and in the camp, the powers of peace and war, which were
afterwards translated to the emperors. But the tradition of ancient
dignity was long revered by the Romans and Barbarians. A Gothic
historian applauds the consulship of Theodoric as the height of all
temporal glory and greatness;  <span id="fr_294"></span>[156](#fn_294.md)
the king of Italy himself congratulated those annual favorites of
fortune who, without the cares, enjoyed the splendor of the throne; and
at the end of a thousand years, two consuls were created by the
sovereigns of Rome and Constantinople, for the sole purpose of giving a
date to the year, and a festival to the people. But the expenses of this
festival, in which the wealthy and the vain aspired to surpass their
predecessors, insensibly arose to the enormous sum of fourscore thousand
pounds; the wisest senators declined a useless honor, which involved the
certain ruin of their families, and to this reluctance I should impute
the frequent chasms in the last age of the consular Fasti. The
predecessors of Justinian had assisted from the public treasures the
dignity of the less opulent candidates; the avarice of that prince
preferred the cheaper and more convenient method of advice and
regulation.  <span id="fr_295"></span>[157](#fn_295.md) Seven processions
or spectacles were the number to which his edict confined the horse and
chariot races, the athletic sports, the music, and pantomimes of the
theatre, and the hunting of wild beasts; and small pieces of silver were
discreetly substituted to the gold medals, which had always excited
tumult and drunkenness, when they were scattered with a profuse hand
among the populace. Notwithstanding these precautions, and his own
example, the succession of consuls finally ceased in the thirteenth year
of Justinian, whose despotic temper might be gratified by the silent
extinction of a title which admonished the Romans of their ancient
freedom.  <span id="fr_296"></span>[158](#fn_296.md) Yet the annual
consulship still lived in the minds of the people; they fondly expected
its speedy restoration; they applauded the gracious condescension of
successive princes, by whom it was assumed in the first year of their
reign; and three centuries elapsed, after the death of Justinian, before
that obsolete dignity, which had been suppressed by custom, could be
abolished by law.  <span id="fr_297"></span>[159](#fn_297.md) The imperfect
mode of distinguishing each year by the name of a magistrate, was
usefully supplied by the date of a permanent aera: the creation of the
world, according to the Septuagint version, was adopted by the Greeks;
 <span id="fr_298"></span>[160](#fn_298.md) and the Latins, since the age
of Charlemagne, have computed their time from the birth of Christ.

finished before September. The hills of Armenia are below the fortieth
degree of latitude; but in the mountainous country which I inhabit, it
is well known that an ascent of some hours carries the traveller from
the climate of Languedoc to that of Norway; and a general theory has
been introduced, that, under the line, an elevation of 2400 toises is
equivalent to the cold of the polar circle, (Remond, Observations sur
les Voyages de Coxe dans la Suisse, tom. ii. p. 104.)

superstitious, of Herodotus. The promise was not in the primitive lie of
Eusebius, but dates at least from the year 400; and a third lie, the
Veronica, was soon raised on the two former, (Evagrius, l. iv. c. 27.)

Scythian emerald was the first, the Bactrian the second, the Aethiopian
only the third, (Hill's Theophrastus, p. 61, &c., 92.) The production,
mines, &c., of emeralds, are involved in darkness; and it is doubtful
whether we possess any of the twelve sorts known to the ancients,
(Goguet, Origine des Loix, &c., part ii. l. ii. c. 2, art. 3.) In this

world, of which Procopius relates a ridiculous fable.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[137](daf04008.htm#fr_273.md) The description of
Dara is amply and correctly given by Procopius, (Persic. l. i. c. 10, l.
ii. c. 13. De Edific. l. ii. c. 1, 2, 3, l. iii. c. 5.) See the
situation in D'Anville, (l'Euphrate et le Tigre, p. 53, 54, 55,) though
he seems to double the interval between Dara and Nisibis.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[\*\*\*\*\_0015](daf04008.htm#fr_274.md) The
situation (of Dara) does not appear to give it strength, as it must have
been commanded on three sides by the mountains, but opening on the south
towards the plains of Mesopotamia. The foundation of the walls and
towers, built of large hewn stone, may be traced across the valley, and
over a number of low rocky hills which branch out from the foot of Mount
Masius. The circumference I conceive to be nearly two miles and a half;
and a small stream, which flows through the middle of the place, has
induced several Koordish and Armenian families to fix their residence
within the ruins. Besides the walls and towers, the remains of many
other buildings attest the former grandeur of Dara; a considerable part
of the space within the walls is arched and vaulted underneath, and in
one place we perceived a large cavern, supported by four ponderous
columns, somewhat resembling the great cistern of Constantinople. In the
centre of the village are the ruins of a palace (probably that mentioned
by Procopius) or church, one hundred paces in length, and sixty in
breadth. The foundations, which are quite entire, consist of a
prodigious number of subterraneous vaulted chambers, entered by a narrow
passage forty paces in length. The gate is still standing; a
considerable part of the wall has bid defiance to time, &c. M Donald

p. 1039 - 1041,) and Corneille le Bruyn, (Voyages, tom. i. p. 146, 147:)
his view may be compared with the plan of Olearius, who judges the wall
to be of shells and gravel hardened by time.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[139](daf04008.htm#fr_276.md) Procopius, though
with some confusion, always denominates them Caspian, (Persic. l. i. c.
10.) The pass is now styled Tatar-topa, the Tartar-gates, (D'Anville,
Geographie Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 119, 120.)

<span id="fn_277"></span>[\*\_0016](daf04008.htm#fr_277.md) Malte-Brun.

Mosdok to Teflis.

2\. The Albanian, more inland than the Derbend Pass.

3\. The Derbend - the Caspian Gates.

But the narrative of Col. Monteith, in the Journal of the Geographical
Society of London. vol. iii. p. i. p. 39, clearly shows that there are
but two passes between the Black Sea and the Caspian; the central, the
Caucasian, or, as Col. Monteith calls it, the Caspian Gates, and the
pass of Derbend, though it is practicable to turn this position (of
Derbend) by a road a few miles distant through the mountains, p. 40. -

<span id="fn_278"></span>[140](daf04008.htm#fr_278.md) The imaginary
rampart of Gog and Magog, which was seriously explored and believed by a
caliph of the ninth century, appears to be derived from the gates of
Mount Caucasus, and a vague report of the wall of China, (Geograph.

219.)

When the czar Peter I. became master of Derbend in the year 1722, the
measure of the wall was found to be 3285 Russian orgyioe, or fathom,
each of seven feet English; in the whole somewhat more than four miles
in length.

been used by the Greeks, the Oriental Christians, and even by the
Russians, till the reign of Peter I The period, however arbitrary, is
clear and convenient. Of the 7296 years which are supposed to elapse
since the creation, we shall find 3000 of ignorance and darkness; 2000
either fabulous or doubtful; 1000 of ancient history, commencing with
the Persian empire, and the Republics of Rome and Athens; 1000 from the
fall of the Roman empire in the West to the discovery of America; and
the remaining 296 will almost complete three centuries of the modern
state of Europe and mankind. I regret this chronology, so far preferable
to our double and perplexed method of counting backwards and forwards
the years before and after the Christian era.

century: it was propagated in the viiith by the authority and writings
of venerable Bede; but it was not till the xth that the use became legal
