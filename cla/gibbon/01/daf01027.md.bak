### Chapter IX: State Of Germany Until The Barbarians. Part II.

There is not any where upon the globe a large tract of country, which we
have discovered destitute of inhabitants, or whose first population can
be fixed with any degree of historical certainty. And yet, as the most
philosophic minds can seldom refrain from investigating the infancy of
great nations, our curiosity consumes itself in toilsome and
disappointed efforts. When Tacitus considered the purity of the German
blood, and the forbidding aspect of the country, he was disposed to
pronounce those barbarians Indigence, or natives of the soil. We may
allow with safety, and perhaps with truth, that ancient Germany was not
originally peopled by any foreign colonies already formed into a
political society;  <span id="fr_726"></span>[12](#fn_726.md) but that the
name and nation received their existence from the gradual union of some
wandering savages of the Hercynian woods. To assert those savages to
have been the spontaneous production of the earth which they inhabited
would be a rash inference, condemned by religion, and unwarranted by
reason.

Such rational doubt is but ill suited with the genius of popular vanity.
Among the nations who have adopted the Mosaic history of the world, the
ark of Noah has been of the same use, as was formerly to the Greeks and
Romans the siege of Troy. On a narrow basis of acknowledged truth, an
immense but rude superstructure of fable has been erected; and the wild
Irishman,  <span id="fr_727"></span>[13](#fn_727.md) as well as the wild
Tartar,  <span id="fr_728"></span>[14](#fn_728.md) could point out the
individual son of Japhet, from whose loins his ancestors were lineally
descended. The last century abounded with antiquarians of profound
learning and easy faith, who, by the dim light of legends and
traditions, of conjectures and etymologies, conducted the great
grandchildren of Noah from the Tower of Babel to the extremities of the
globe. Of these judicious critics, one of the most entertaining was Oaus
Rudbeck, professor in the university of Upsal.  <span
id="fr_729"></span>[15](#fn_729.md) Whatever is celebrated either in
history or fable, this zealous patriot ascribes to his country. From
Sweden (which formed so considerable a part of ancient Germany) the
Greeks themselves derived their alphabetical characters, their
astronomy, and their religion. Of that delightful region (for such it
appeared to the eyes of a native) the Atlantis of Plato, the country of
the Hyperboreans, the gardens of the Hesperides, the Fortunate Islands,
and even the Elysian Fields, were all but faint and imperfect
transcripts. A clime so profusely favored by Nature could not long
remain desert after the flood. The learned Rudbeck allows the family of
Noah a few years to multiply from eight to about twenty thousand
persons. He then disperses them into small colonies to replenish the
earth, and to propagate the human species. The German or Swedish
detachment (which marched, if I am not mistaken, under the command of
Askenaz, the son of Gomer, the son of Japhet) distinguished itself by a
more than common diligence in the prosecution of this great work. The
northern hive cast its swarms over the greatest part of Europe, Africa,
and Asia; and (to use the author's metaphor) the blood circulated from
the extremities to the heart.

But all this well-labored system of German antiquities is annihilated by
a single fact, too well attested to admit of any doubt, and of too
decisive a nature to leave room for any reply. The Germans, in the age
of Tacitus, were unacquainted with the use of letters;  <span
id="fr_730"></span>[16](#fn_730.md) and the use of letters is the principal
circumstance that distinguishes a civilized people from a herd of
savages incapable of knowledge or reflection. Without that artificial
help, the human memory soon dissipates or corrupts the ideas intrusted
to her charge; and the nobler faculties of the mind, no longer supplied
with models or with materials, gradually forget their powers; the
judgment becomes feeble and lethargic, the imagination languid or
irregular. Fully to apprehend this important truth, let us attempt, in
an improved society, to calculate the immense distance between the man
of learning and the illiterate peasant. The former, by reading and
reflection, multiplies his own experience, and lives in distant ages and
remote countries; whilst the latter, rooted to a single spot, and
confined to a few years of existence, surpasses but very little his
fellow-laborer, the ox, in the exercise of his mental faculties. The
same, and even a greater, difference will be found between nations than
between individuals; and we may safely pronounce, that without some
species of writing, no people has ever preserved the faithful annals of
their history, ever made any considerable progress in the abstract
sciences, or ever possessed, in any tolerable degree of perfection, the
useful and agreeable arts of life.

Of these arts, the ancient Germans were wretchedly destitute. They
passed their lives in a state of ignorance and poverty, which it has
pleased some declaimers to dignify with the appellation of virtuous
simplicity. Modern Germany is said to contain about two thousand three
hundred walled towns.  <span id="fr_731"></span>[17](#fn_732.md)  <span
id="fr_732"></span>[\*\_0068](#fn_731.md) In a much wider extent of
country, the geographer Ptolemy could discover no more than ninety
places which he decorates with the name of cities;  <span
id="fr_733"></span>[18](#fn_733.md) though, according to our ideas, they
would but ill deserve that splendid title. We can only suppose them to
have been rude fortifications, constructed in the centre of the woods,
and designed to secure the women, children, and cattle, whilst the
warriors of the tribe marched out to repel a sudden invasion.  <span
id="fr_734"></span>[19](#fn_734.md) But Tacitus asserts, as a well-known
fact, that the Germans, in his time, had no cities;  <span
id="fr_735"></span>[20](#fn_735.md) and that they affected to despise the
works of Roman industry, as places of confinement rather than of
security.  <span id="fr_736"></span>[21](#fn_736.md) Their edifices were
not even contiguous, or formed into regular villas;  <span
id="fr_737"></span>[22](#fn_737.md) each barbarian fixed his independent
dwelling on the spot to which a plain, a wood, or a stream of fresh
water, had induced him to give the preference. Neither stone, nor brick,
nor tiles, were employed in these slight habitations.  <span
id="fr_738"></span>[23](#fn_738.md) They were indeed no more than low huts,
of a circular figure, built of rough timber, thatched with straw, and
pierced at the top to leave a free passage for the smoke. In the most
inclement winter, the hardy German was satisfied with a scanty garment
made of the skin of some animal. The nations who dwelt towards the North
clothed themselves in furs; and the women manufactured for their own use
a coarse kind of linen.  <span id="fr_739"></span>[24](#fn_739.md) The game
of various sorts, with which the forests of Germany were plentifully
stocked, supplied its inhabitants with food and exercise.  <span
id="fr_740"></span>[25](#fn_740.md) Their monstrous herds of cattle, less
remarkable indeed for their beauty than for their utility,  <span
id="fr_741"></span>[26](#fn_741.md) formed the principal object of their
wealth. A small quantity of corn was the only produce exacted from the
earth; the use of orchards or artificial meadows was unknown to the
Germans; nor can we expect any improvements in agriculture from a
people, whose prosperity every year experienced a general change by a
new division of the arable lands, and who, in that strange operation,
avoided disputes, by suffering a great part of their territory to lie
waste and without tillage.  <span id="fr_742"></span>[27](#fn_742.md)

Gold, silver, and iron, were extremely scarce in Germany. Its barbarous
inhabitants wanted both skill and patience to investigate those rich
veins of silver, which have so liberally rewarded the attention of the
princes of Brunswick and Saxony. Sweden, which now supplies Europe with
iron, was equally ignorant of its own riches; and the appearance of the
arms of the Germans furnished a sufficient proof how little iron they
were able to bestow on what they must have deemed the noblest use of
that metal. The various transactions of peace and war had introduced
some Roman coins (chiefly silver) among the borderers of the Rhine and
Danube; but the more distant tribes were absolutely unacquainted with
the use of money, carried on their confined traffic by the exchange of
commodities, and prized their rude earthen vessels as of equal value
with the silver vases, the presents of Rome to their princes and
ambassadors.  <span id="fr_743"></span>[28](#fn_743.md) To a mind capable
of reflection, such leading facts convey more instruction, than a
tedious detail of subordinate circumstances. The value of money has been
settled by general consent to express our wants and our property, as
letters were invented to express our ideas; and both these institutions,
by giving a more active energy to the powers and passions of human
nature, have contributed to multiply the objects they were designed to
represent. The use of gold and silver is in a great measure factitious;
but it would be impossible to enumerate the important and various
services which agriculture, and all the arts, have received from iron,
when tempered and fashioned by the operation of fire, and the dexterous
hand of man. Money, in a word, is the most universal incitement, iron
the most powerful instrument, of human industry; and it is very
difficult to conceive by what means a people, neither actuated by the
one, nor seconded by the other, could emerge from the grossest
barbarism.  <span id="fr_744"></span>[29](#fn_744.md)

If we contemplate a savage nation in any part of the globe, a supine
indolence and a carelessness of futurity will be found to constitute
their general character. In a civilized state, every faculty of man is
expanded and exercised; and the great chain of mutual dependence
connects and embraces the several members of society. The most numerous
portion of it is employed in constant and useful labor. The select few,
placed by fortune above that necessity, can, however, fill up their time
by the pursuits of interest or glory, by the improvement of their estate
or of their understanding, by the duties, the pleasures, and even the
follies of social life. The Germans were not possessed of these varied
resources. The care of the house and family, the management of the land
and cattle, were delegated to the old and the infirm, to women and
slaves. The lazy warrior, destitute of every art that might employ his
leisure hours, consumed his days and nights in the animal gratifications
of sleep and food. And yet, by a wonderful diversity of nature,
(according to the remark of a writer who had pierced into its darkest
recesses,) the same barbarians are by turns the most indolent and the
most restless of mankind. They delight in sloth, they detest
tranquility.  <span id="fr_745"></span>[30](#fn_745.md) The languid soul,
oppressed with its own weight, anxiously required some new and powerful
sensation; and war and danger were the only amusements adequate to its
fierce temper. The sound that summoned the German to arms was grateful
to his ear. It roused him from his uncomfortable lethargy, gave him an
active pursuit, and, by strong exercise of the body, and violent
emotions of the mind, restored him to a more lively sense of his
existence. In the dull intervals of peace, these barbarians were
immoderately addicted to deep gaming and excessive drinking; both of
which, by different means, the one by inflaming their passions, the
other by extinguishing their reason, alike relieved them from the pain
of thinking. They gloried in passing whole days and nights at table; and
the blood of friends and relations often stained their numerous and
drunken assemblies.  <span id="fr_746"></span>[31](#fn_746.md) Their debts
of honor (for in that light they have transmitted to us those of play)
they discharged with the most romantic fidelity. The desperate gamester,
who had staked his person and liberty on a last throw of the dice,
patiently submitted to the decision of fortune, and suffered himself to
be bound, chastised, and sold into remote slavery, by his weaker but
more lucky antagonist.  <span id="fr_747"></span>[32](#fn_747.md)

Strong beer, a liquor extracted with very little art from wheat or
barley, and corrupted (as it is strongly expressed by Tacitus) into a
certain semblance of wine, was sufficient for the gross purposes of
German debauchery. But those who had tasted the rich wines of Italy, and
afterwards of Gaul, sighed for that more delicious species of
intoxication. They attempted not, however, (as has since been executed
with so much success,) to naturalize the vine on the banks of the Rhine
and Danube; nor did they endeavor to procure by industry the materials
of an advantageous commerce. To solicit by labor what might be ravished
by arms, was esteemed unworthy of the German spirit.  <span
id="fr_748"></span>[33](#fn_748.md) The intemperate thirst of strong
liquors often urged the barbarians to invade the provinces on which art
or nature had bestowed those much envied presents. The Tuscan who
betrayed his country to the Celtic nations, attracted them into Italy by
the prospect of the rich fruits and delicious wines, the productions of
a happier climate.  <span id="fr_749"></span>[34](#fn_749.md) And in the
same manner the German auxiliaries, invited into France during the civil
wars of the sixteenth century, were allured by the promise of plenteous
quarters in the provinces of Champaigne and Burgundy.  <span
id="fr_750"></span>[35](#fn_750.md) Drunkenness, the most illiberal, but
not the most dangerous of our vices, was sometimes capable, in a less
civilized state of mankind, of occasioning a battle, a war, or a
revolution.

The climate of ancient Germany has been modified, and the soil
fertilized, by the labor of ten centuries from the time of Charlemagne.
The same extent of ground which at present maintains, in ease and
plenty, a million of husbandmen and artificers, was unable to supply a
hundred thousand lazy warriors with the simple necessaries of life.
 <span id="fr_751"></span>[36](#fn_751.md) The Germans abandoned their
immense forests to the exercise of hunting, employed in pasturage the
most considerable part of their lands, bestowed on the small remainder a
rude and careless cultivation, and then accused the scantiness and
sterility of a country that refused to maintain the multitude of its
inhabitants. When the return of famine severely admonished them of the
importance of the arts, the national distress was sometimes alleviated
by the emigration of a third, perhaps, or a fourth part of their youth.
 <span id="fr_752"></span>[37](#fn_752.md) The possession and the enjoyment
of property are the pledges which bind a civilized people to an improved
country. But the Germans, who carried with them what they most valued,
their arms, their cattle, and their women, cheerfully abandoned the vast
silence of their woods for the unbounded hopes of plunder and conquest.
The innumerable swarms that issued, or seemed to issue, from the great
storehouse of nations, were multiplied by the fears of the vanquished,
and by the credulity of succeeding ages. And from facts thus
exaggerated, an opinion was gradually established, and has been
supported by writers of distinguished reputation, that, in the age of
Caesar and Tacitus, the inhabitants of the North were far more numerous
than they are in our days.  <span id="fr_753"></span>[38](#fn_753.md) A
more serious inquiry into the causes of population seems to have
convinced modern philosophers of the falsehood, and indeed the
impossibility, of the supposition. To the names of Mariana and of
Machiavel,  <span id="fr_754"></span>[39](#fn_754.md) we can oppose the
equal names of Robertson and Hume.  <span
id="fr_755"></span>[40](#fn_755.md)

A warlike nation like the Germans, without either cities, letters, arts,
or money, found some compensation for this savage state in the enjoyment
of liberty. Their poverty secured their freedom, since our desires and
our possessions are the strongest fetters of despotism. "Among the
Suiones (says Tacitus) riches are held in honor. They are therefore
subject to an absolute monarch, who, instead of intrusting his people
with the free use of arms, as is practised in the rest of Germany,
commits them to the safe custody, not of a citizen, or even of a
freedman, but of a slave. The neighbors of the Suiones, the Sitones, are
sunk even below servitude; they obey a woman."  <span
id="fr_756"></span>[41](#fn_756.md) In the mention of these exceptions, the
great historian sufficiently acknowledges the general theory of
government. We are only at a loss to conceive by what means riches and
despotism could penetrate into a remote corner of the North, and
extinguish the generous flame that blazed with such fierceness on the
frontier of the Roman provinces, or how the ancestors of those Danes and
Norwegians, so distinguished in latter ages by their unconquered spirit,
could thus tamely resign the great character of German liberty.  <span
id="fr_757"></span>[42](#fn_757.md) Some tribes, however, on the coast of
the Baltic, acknowledged the authority of kings, though without
relinquishing the rights of men,  <span id="fr_758"></span>[43](#fn_758.md)
but in the far greater part of Germany, the form of government was a
democracy, tempered, indeed, and controlled, not so much by general and
positive laws, as by the occasional ascendant of birth or valor, of
eloquence or superstition.  <span id="fr_759"></span>[44](#fn_759.md)

Civil governments, in their first institution, are voluntary
associations for mutual defence. To obtain the desired end, it is
absolutely necessary that each individual should conceive himself
obliged to submit his private opinions and actions to the judgment of
the greater number of his associates. The German tribes were contented
with this rude but liberal outline of political society. As soon as a
youth, born of free parents, had attained the age of manhood, he was
introduced into the general council of his countrymen, solemnly invested
with a shield and spear, and adopted as an equal and worthy member of
the military commonwealth. The assembly of the warriors of the tribe was
convened at stated seasons, or on sudden emergencies. The trial of
public offences, the election of magistrates, and the great business of
peace and war, were determined by its independent voice. Sometimes
indeed, these important questions were previously considered and
prepared in a more select council of the principal chieftains.  <span
id="fr_760"></span>[45](#fn_760.md) The magistrates might deliberate and
persuade, the people only could resolve and execute; and the resolutions
of the Germans were for the most part hasty and violent. Barbarians
accustomed to place their freedom in gratifying the present passion, and
their courage in overlooking all future consequences, turned away with
indignant contempt from the remonstrances of justice and policy, and it
was the practice to signify by a hollow murmur their dislike of such
timid counsels. But whenever a more popular orator proposed to vindicate
the meanest citizen from either foreign or domestic injury, whenever he
called upon his fellow-countrymen to assert the national honor, or to
pursue some enterprise full of danger and glory, a loud clashing of
shields and spears expressed the eager applause of the assembly. For the
Germans always met in arms, and it was constantly to be dreaded, lest an
irregular multitude, inflamed with faction and strong liquors, should
use those arms to enforce, as well as to declare, their furious
resolves. We may recollect how often the diets of Poland have been
polluted with blood, and the more numerous party has been compelled to
yield to the more violent and seditious.  <span
id="fr_761"></span>[46](#fn_761.md)

A general of the tribe was elected on occasions of danger; and, if the
danger was pressing and extensive, several tribes concurred in the
choice of the same general. The bravest warrior was named to lead his
countrymen into the field, by his example rather than by his commands.
But this power, however limited, was still invidious. It expired with
the war, and in time of peace the German tribes acknowledged not any
supreme chief.  <span id="fr_762"></span>[47](#fn_762.md) Princes were,
however, appointed, in the general assembly, to administer justice, or
rather to compose differences,  <span id="fr_763"></span>[48](#fn_763.md)
in their respective districts. In the choice of these magistrates, as
much regard was shown to birth as to merit.  <span
id="fr_764"></span>[49](#fn_764.md) To each was assigned, by the public, a
guard, and a council of a hundred persons, and the first of the princes
appears to have enjoyed a preeminence of rank and honor which sometimes
tempted the Romans to compliment him with the regal title.  <span
id="fr_765"></span>[50](#fn_765.md)

The comparative view of the powers of the magistrates, in two remarkable
instances, is alone sufficient to represent the whole system of German
manners. The disposal of the landed property within their district was
absolutely vested in their hands, and they distributed it every year
according to a new division.  <span id="fr_766"></span>[51](#fn_766.md) At
the same time they were not authorized to punish with death, to
imprison, or even to strike a private citizen.  <span
id="fr_767"></span>[52](#fn_767.md) A people thus jealous of their persons,
and careless of their possessions, must have been totally destitute of
industry and the arts, but animated with a high sense of honor and
independence.

The emigration of the Gauls followed the course of the Danube, and
discharged itself on Greece and Asia. Tacitus could discover only one
inconsiderable tribe that retained any traces of a Gallic origin.

Note: The Gothini, who must not be confounded with the Gothi, a Suevian
tribe. In the time of Caesar many other tribes of Gaulish origin dwelt
along the course of the Danube, who could not long resist the attacks of
the Suevi. The Helvetians, who dwelt on the borders of the Black Forest,
between the Maine and the Danube, had been expelled long before the time
of Caesar. He mentions also the Volci Tectosagi, who came from Languedoc
and settled round the Black Forest. The Boii, who had penetrated into
that forest, and also have left traces of their name in Bohemia, were
subdued in the first century by the Marcomanni. The Boii settled in
Noricum, were mingled afterwards with the Lombards, and received the
name of Boio Arii (Bavaria) or Boiovarii: var, in some German dialects,
appearing to mean remains, descendants. Compare Malte B-m, Geography,
vol. i. p. 410, edit 1832 - M.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[13](daf01027.htm#fr_727.md) According to Dr.
Keating, (History of Ireland, p. 13, 14,) the giant Portholanus, who was
the son of Seara, the son of Esra, the son of Sru, the son of Framant,
the son of Fathaclan, the son of Magog, the son of Japhet, the son of
Noah, landed on the coast of Munster the 14th day of May, in the year of
the world one thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight. Though he
succeeded in his great enterprise, the loose behavior of his wife
rendered his domestic life very unhappy, and provoked him to such a
degree, that he killed - her favorite greyhound. This, as the learned
historian very properly observes, was the first instance of female
falsehood and infidelity ever known in Ireland.

Literarum secreta viri pariter ac foeminae ignorant. We may rest
contented with this decisive authority, without entering into the
obscure disputes concerning the antiquity of the Runic characters. The
learned Celsius, a Swede, a scholar, and a philosopher, was of opinion,
that they were nothing more than the Roman letters, with the curves
changed into straight lines for the ease of engraving. See Pelloutier,
Histoire des Celtes, l. ii. c. 11. Dictionnaire Diplomatique, tom. i. p.
223. We may add, that the oldest Runic inscriptions are supposed to be
of the third century, and the most ancient writer who mentions the Runic
characters is Venan tius Frotunatus, (Carm. vii. 18,) who lived towards
the end of the sixth century.

Barbara fraxineis pingatur Runa tabellis.

Note: The obscure subject of the Runic characters has exercised the
industry and ingenuity of the modern scholars of the north. There are
three distinct theories; one, maintained by Schlozer, (Nordische
Geschichte, p. 481, &c.,) who considers their sixteen letters to be a
corruption of the Roman alphabet, post-Christian in their date, and
Schlozer would attribute their introduction into the north to the
Alemanni. The second, that of Frederick Schlegel, (Vorlesungen uber alte
und neue Literatur,) supposes that these characters were left on the
coasts of the Mediterranean and Northern Seas by the Phoenicians,
preserved by the priestly castes, and employed for purposes of magic.
Their common origin from the Phoenician would account for heir
similarity to the Roman letters. The last, to which we incline, claims
much higher and more venerable antiquity for the Runic, and supposes
them to have been the original characters of the Indo-Teutonic tribes,
brought from the East, and preserved among the different races of that
stock. See Ueber Deutsche Runen von W. C. Grimm, 1821. A Memoir by Dr.

author of the Geschichte des Teutschen Volkes) has surpassed most
writers in his patriotic enthusiasm for the virtues and noble manners of
his ancestors. Even the cold of the climate, and the want of vines and
fruit trees, as well as the barbarism of the inhabitants, are calumnies
of the luxurious Italians. M. Guizot, on the other side, (in his
Histoire de la Civilisation, vol. i. p. 272, &c.,) has drawn a curious
parallel between the Germans of Tacitus and the North American Indians.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[32](daf01027.htm#fr_747.md) Id. 24. The Germans
might borrow the arts of play from the Romans, but the passion is
wonderfully inherent in the human species.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[36](daf01027.htm#fr_751.md) The Helvetian nation,
which issued from a country called Switzerland, contained, of every age
and sex, 368,000 persons, (Caesar de Bell. Gal. i. 29.) At present, the
number of people in the Pays de Vaud (a small district on the banks of
the Leman Lake, much more distinguished for politeness than for
industry) amounts to 112,591. See an excellent tract of M. Muret, in the
Memoires de la Societe de Born.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[37](daf01027.htm#fr_752.md) Paul Diaconus, c. 1,
2, 3. Machiavel, Davila, and the rest of Paul's followers, represent
these emigrations too much as regular and concerted measures.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[38](daf01027.htm#fr_753.md) Sir William Temple
and Montesquieu have indulged, on this subject, the usual liveliness of
their fancy.

V. Hume's Political Essays. Note: It is a wise observation of Malthus,
that these nations "were not populous in proportion to the land they
occupied, but to the food they produced. They were prolific from their
pure morals and constitutions, but their institutions were not
calculated to produce food for those whom they brought into being. - M -
1845.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[41](daf01027.htm#fr_756.md) Tacit. German. 44,
45. Freinshemius (who dedicated his supplement to Livy to Christina of
Sweden) thinks proper to be very angry with the Roman who expressed so
very little reverence for Northern queens. Note: The Suiones and the
Sitones are the ancient inhabitants of Scandinavia, their name may be
traced in that of Sweden; they did not belong to the race of the Suevi,
but that of the non-Suevi or Cimbri, whom the Suevi, in very remote
times, drove back part to the west, part to the north; they were
afterwards mingled with Suevian tribes, among others the Goths, who have
traces of their name and power in the isle of Gothland. - G

<span id="fn_757"></span>[42](daf01027.htm#fr_757.md) May we not suspect
that superstition was the parent of despotism? The descendants of Odin,
(whose race was not extinct till the year 1060) are said to have reigned
in Sweden above a thousand years. The temple of Upsal was the ancient
seat of religion and empire. In the year 1153 I find a singular law,
prohibiting the use and profession of arms to any except the king's
guards. Is it not probable that it was colored by the pretence of
reviving an old institution? See Dalin's History of Sweden in the
Bibliotheque Raisonneo tom. xl. and xlv.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[45](daf01027.htm#fr_760.md) Grotius changes an
expression of Tacitus, pertractantur into Proetractantur. The correction
is equally just and ingenious.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[46](daf01027.htm#fr_761.md) Even in our ancient
parliament, the barons often carried a question, not so much by the
number of votes, as by that of their armed followers.
