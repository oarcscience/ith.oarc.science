### Chapter X: Emperors Decius, Gallus, Aemilianus, Valerian And Gallienus. Part IV.

In the general calamities of mankind, the death of an individual,
however exalted, the ruin of an edifice, however famous, are passed over
with careless inattention. Yet we cannot forget that the temple of Diana
at Ephesus, after having risen with increasing splendor from seven
repeated misfortunes,  <span id="fr_942"></span>[128](#fn_942.md) was
finally burnt by the Goths in their third naval invasion. The arts of
Greece, and the wealth of Asia, had conspired to erect that sacred and
magnificent structure. It was supported by a hundred and twenty-seven
marble columns of the Ionic order. They were the gifts of devout
monarchs, and each was sixty feet high. The altar was adorned with the
masterly sculptures of Praxiteles, who had, perhaps, selected from the
favorite legends of the place the birth of the divine children of
Latona, the concealment of Apollo after the slaughter of the Cyclops,
and the clemency of Bacchus to the vanquished Amazons.  <span
id="fr_943"></span>[129](#fn_943.md) Yet the length of the temple of
Ephesus was only four hundred and twenty-five feet, about two thirds of
the measure of the church of St. Peter's at Rome.  <span
id="fr_944"></span>[130](#fn_944.md) In the other dimensions, it was still
more inferior to that sublime production of modern architecture. The
spreading arms of a Christian cross require a much greater breadth than
the oblong temples of the Pagans; and the boldest artists of antiquity
would have been startled at the proposal of raising in the air a dome of
the size and proportions of the Pantheon. The temple of Diana was,
however, admired as one of the wonders of the world. Successive empires,
the Persian, the Macedonian, and the Roman, had revered its sanctity and
enriched its splendor.  <span id="fr_945"></span>[131](#fn_945.md) But the
rude savages of the Baltic were destitute of a taste for the elegant
arts, and they despised the ideal terrors of a foreign superstition.
 <span id="fr_946"></span>[132](#fn_946.md)

Another circumstance is related of these invasions, which might deserve
our notice, were it not justly to be suspected as the fanciful conceit
of a recent sophist. We are told, that in the sack of Athens the Goths
had collected all the libraries, and were on the point of setting fire
to this funeral pile of Grecian learning, had not one of their chiefs,
of more refined policy than his brethren, dissuaded them from the
design; by the profound observation, that as long as the Greeks were
addicted to the study of books, they would never apply themselves to the
exercise of arms.  <span id="fr_947"></span>[133](#fn_947.md) The sagacious
counsellor (should the truth of the fact be admitted) reasoned like an
ignorant barbarian. In the most polite and powerful nations, genius of
every kind has displayed itself about the same period; and the age of
science has generally been the age of military virtue and success.

IV\. The new sovereign of Persia, Artaxerxes and his son Sapor, had
triumphed (as we have already seen) over the house of Arsaces. Of the
many princes of that ancient race. Chosroes, king of Armenia, had alone
preserved both his life and his independence. He defended himself by the
natural strength of his country; by the perpetual resort of fugitives
and malecontents; by the alliance of the Romans, and above all, by his
own courage. Invincible in arms, during a thirty years' war, he was at
length assassinated by the emissaries of Sapor, king of Persia. The
patriotic satraps of Armenia, who asserted the freedom and dignity of
the crown, implored the protection of Rome in favor of Tiridates, the
lawful heir. But the son of Chosroes was an infant, the allies were at a
distance, and the Persian monarch advanced towards the frontier at the
head of an irresistible force. Young Tiridates, the future hope of his
country, was saved by the fidelity of a servant, and Armenia continued
above twenty-seven years a reluctant province of the great monarchy of
Persia.  <span id="fr_948"></span>[134](#fn_948.md) Elated with this easy
conquest, and presuming on the distresses or the degeneracy of the
Romans, Sapor obliged the strong garrisons of Carrhae and Nisibis  <span
id="fr_949"></span>[\*\_0079](#fn_949.md) to surrender, and spread
devastation and terror on either side of the Euphrates.

The loss of an important frontier, the ruin of a faithful and natural
ally, and the rapid success of Sapor's ambition, affected Rome with a
deep sense of the insult as well as of the danger. Valerian flattered
himself, that the vigilance of his lieutenants would sufficiently
provide for the safety of the Rhine and of the Danube; but he resolved,
notwithstanding his advanced age, to march in person to the defence of
the Euphrates. During his progress through Asia Minor, the naval
enterprises of the Goths were suspended, and the afflicted province
enjoyed a transient and fallacious calm. He passed the Euphrates,
encountered the Persian monarch near the walls of Edessa, was
vanquished, and taken prisoner by Sapor. The particulars of this great
event are darkly and imperfectly represented; yet, by the glimmering
light which is afforded us, we may discover a long series of imprudence,
of error, and of deserved misfortunes on the side of the Roman emperor.
He reposed an implicit confidence in Macrianus, his Praetorian praefect.
 <span id="fr_950"></span>[135](#fn_950.md) That worthless minister
rendered his master formidable only to the oppressed subjects, and
contemptible to the enemies of Rome.  <span
id="fr_951"></span>[136](#fn_951.md) By his weak or wicked counsels, the
Imperial army was betrayed into a situation where valor and military
skill were equally unavailing.  <span id="fr_952"></span>[137](#fn_952.md)
The vigorous attempt of the Romans to cut their way through the Persian
host was repulsed with great slaughter;  <span
id="fr_953"></span>[138](#fn_953.md) and Sapor, who encompassed the camp
with superior numbers, patiently waited till the increasing rage of
famine and pestilence had insured his victory. The licentious murmurs of
the legions soon accused Valerian as the cause of their calamities;
their seditious clamors demanded an instant capitulation. An immense sum
of gold was offered to purchase the permission of a disgraceful retreat.
But the Persian, conscious of his superiority, refused the money with
disdain; and detaining the deputies, advanced in order of battle to the
foot of the Roman rampart, and insisted on a personal conference with
the emperor. Valerian was reduced to the necessity of intrusting his
life and dignity to the faith of an enemy. The interview ended as it was
natural to expect. The emperor was made a prisoner, and his astonished
troops laid down their arms.  <span id="fr_954"></span>[139](#fn_954.md) In
such a moment of triumph, the pride and policy of Sapor prompted him to
fill the vacant throne with a successor entirely dependent on his
pleasure. Cyriades, an obscure fugitive of Antioch, stained with every
vice, was chosen to dishonor the Roman purple; and the will of the
Persian victor could not fail of being ratified by the acclamations,
however reluctant, of the captive army.  <span
id="fr_955"></span>[140](#fn_955.md)

The Imperial slave was eager to secure the favor of his master by an act
of treason to his native country. He conducted Sapor over the Euphrates,
and, by the way of Chalcis, to the metropolis of the East. So rapid were
the motions of the Persian cavalry, that, if we may credit a very
judicious historian,  <span id="fr_956"></span>[141](#fn_956.md) the city
of Antioch was surprised when the idle multitude was fondly gazing on
the amusements of the theatre. The splendid buildings of Antioch,
private as well as public, were either pillaged or destroyed; and the
numerous inhabitants were put to the sword, or led away into captivity.
 <span id="fr_957"></span>[142](#fn_957.md) The tide of devastation was
stopped for a moment by the resolution of the high priest of Emesa.
Arrayed in his sacerdotal robes, he appeared at the head of a great body
of fanatic peasants, armed only with slings, and defended his god and
his property from the sacrilegious hands of the followers of Zoroaster.
 <span id="fr_958"></span>[143](#fn_958.md) But the ruin of Tarsus, and of
many other cities, furnishes a melancholy proof that, except in this
singular instance, the conquest of Syria and Cilicia scarcely
interrupted the progress of the Persian arms. The advantages of the
narrow passes of Mount Taurus were abandoned, in which an invader, whose
principal force consisted in his cavalry, would have been engaged in a
very unequal combat: and Sapor was permitted to form the siege of
Caesarea, the capital of Cappadocia; a city, though of the second rank,
which was supposed to contain four hundred thousand inhabitants.
Demosthenes commanded in the place, not so much by the commission of the
emperor, as in the voluntary defence of his country. For a long time he
deferred its fate; and when at last Caesarea was betrayed by the perfidy
of a physician, he cut his way through the Persians, who had been
ordered to exert their utmost diligence to take him alive. This heroic
chief escaped the power of a foe who might either have honored or
punished his obstinate valor; but many thousands of his fellow-citizens
were involved in a general massacre, and Sapor is accused of treating
his prisoners with wanton and unrelenting cruelty.  <span
id="fr_959"></span>[144](#fn_959.md) Much should undoubtedly be allowed for
national animosity, much for humbled pride and impotent revenge; yet,
upon the whole, it is certain, that the same prince, who, in Armenia,
had displayed the mild aspect of a legislator, showed himself to the
Romans under the stern features of a conqueror. He despaired of making
any permanent establishment in the empire, and sought only to leave
behind him a wasted desert, whilst he transported into Persia the people
and the treasures of the provinces.  <span
id="fr_960"></span>[145](#fn_960.md)

At the time when the East trembled at the name of Sapor, he received a
present not unworthy of the greatest kings; a long train of camels,
laden with the most rare and valuable merchandises. The rich offering
was accompanied with an epistle, respectful, but not servile, from
Odenathus, one of the noblest and most opulent senators of Palmyra. "Who
is this Odenathus," (said the haughty victor, and he commanded that the
present should be cast into the Euphrates,) "that he thus insolently
presumes to write to his lord? If he entertains a hope of mitigating his
punishment, let him fall prostrate before the foot of our throne, with
his hands bound behind his back. Should he hesitate, swift destruction
shall be poured on his head, on his whole race, and on his country."
 <span id="fr_961"></span>[146](#fn_961.md) The desperate extremity to
which the Palmyrenian was reduced, called into action all the latent
powers of his soul. He met Sapor; but he met him in arms. Infusing his
own spirit into a little army collected from the villages of Syria
 <span id="fr_962"></span>[147](#fn_962.md) and the tents of the desert,
 <span id="fr_963"></span>[148](#fn_963.md) he hovered round the Persian
host, harassed their retreat, carried off part of the treasure, and,
what was dearer than any treasure, several of the women of the great
king; who was at last obliged to repass the Euphrates with some marks of
haste and confusion.  <span id="fr_964"></span>[149](#fn_964.md) By this
exploit, Odenathus laid the foundations of his future fame and fortunes.
The majesty of Rome, oppressed by a Persian, was protected by a Syrian
or Arab of Palmyra.

The voice of history, which is often little more than the organ of
hatred or flattery, reproaches Sapor with a proud abuse of the rights of
conquest. We are told that Valerian, in chains, but invested with the
Imperial purple, was exposed to the multitude, a constant spectacle of
fallen greatness; and that whenever the Persian monarch mounted on
horseback, he placed his foot on the neck of a Roman emperor.
Notwithstanding all the remonstrances of his allies, who repeatedly
advised him to remember the vicissitudes of fortune, to dread the
returning power of Rome, and to make his illustrious captive the pledge
of peace, not the object of insult, Sapor still remained inflexible.
When Valerian sunk under the weight of shame and grief, his skin,
stuffed with straw, and formed into the likeness of a human figure, was
preserved for ages in the most celebrated temple of Persia; a more real
monument of triumph, than the fancied trophies of brass and marble so
often erected by Roman vanity.  <span id="fr_965"></span>[150](#fn_965.md)
The tale is moral and pathetic, but the truth  <span
id="fr_966"></span>[!\_0080](#fn_966.md) of it may very fairly be called in
question. The letters still extant from the princes of the East to Sapor
are manifest forgeries;  <span id="fr_967"></span>[151](#fn_967.md) nor is
it natural to suppose that a jealous monarch should, even in the person
of a rival, thus publicly degrade the majesty of kings. Whatever
treatment the unfortunate Valerian might experience in Persia, it is at
least certain that the only emperor of Rome who had ever fallen into the
hands of the enemy, languished away his life in hopeless captivity.

The emperor Gallienus, who had long supported with impatience the
censorial severity of his father and colleague, received the
intelligence of his misfortunes with secret pleasure and avowed
indifference. "I knew that my father was a mortal," said he; "and since
he has acted as it becomes a brave man, I am satisfied." Whilst Rome
lamented the fate of her sovereign, the savage coldness of his son was
extolled by the servile courtiers as the perfect firmness of a hero and
a stoic.  <span id="fr_968"></span>[152](#fn_968.md) It is difficult to
paint the light, the various, the inconstant character of Gallienus,
which he displayed without constraint, as soon as he became sole
possessor of the empire. In every art that he attempted, his lively
genius enabled him to succeed; and as his genius was destitute of
judgment, he attempted every art, except the important ones of war and
government. He was a master of several curious, but useless sciences, a
ready orator, an elegant poet,  <span id="fr_969"></span>[153](#fn_969.md)
a skilful gardener, an excellent cook, and most contemptible prince.
When the great emergencies of the state required his presence and
attention, he was engaged in conversation with the philosopher Plotinus,
 <span id="fr_970"></span>[154](#fn_970.md) wasting his time in trifling or
licentious pleasures, preparing his initiation to the Grecian mysteries,
or soliciting a place in the Arcopagus of Athens. His profuse
magnificence insulted the general poverty; the solemn ridicule of his
triumphs impressed a deeper sense of the public disgrace.  <span
id="fr_971"></span>[155](#fn_971.md) The repeated intelligence of
invasions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careless smile;
and singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production of
the lost province, he carelessly asked, whether Rome must be ruined,
unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt, and arras cloth from Gaul.
There were, however, a few short moments in the life of Gallienus, when,
exasperated by some recent injury, he suddenly appeared the intrepid
soldier and the cruel tyrant; till, satiated with blood, or fatigued by
resistance, he insensibly sunk into the natural mildness and indolence
of his character.  <span id="fr_972"></span>[156](#fn_972.md)

At the time when the reins of government were held with so loose a hand,
it is not surprising, that a crowd of usurpers should start up in every
province of the empire against the son of Valerian. It was probably some
ingenious fancy, of comparing the thirty tyrants of Rome with the thirty
tyrants of Athens, that induced the writers of the Augustan History to
select that celebrated number, which has been gradually received into a
popular appellation.  <span id="fr_973"></span>[157](#fn_973.md) But in
every light the parallel is idle and defective. What resemblance can we
discover between a council of thirty persons, the united oppressors of a
single city, and an uncertain list of independent rivals, who rose and
fell in irregular succession through the extent of a vast empire? Nor
can the number of thirty be completed, unless we include in the account
the women and children who were honored with the Imperial title. The
reign of Gallienus, distracted as it was, produced only nineteen
pretenders to the throne: Cyriades, Macrianus, Balista, Odenathus, and
Zenobia, in the East; in Gaul, and the western provinces, Posthumus,
Lollianus, Victorinus, and his mother Victoria, Marius, and Tetricus; in
Illyricum and the confines of the Danube, Ingenuus, Regillianus, and
Aureolus; in Pontus,  <span id="fr_974"></span>[158](#fn_974.md)
Saturninus; in Isauria, Trebellianus; Piso in Thessaly; Valens in
Achaia; Aemilianus in Egypt; and Celsus in Africa.  <span
id="fr_975"></span>[\*\_0081](#fn_975.md) To illustrate the obscure
monuments of the life and death of each individual, would prove a
laborious task, alike barren of instruction and of amusement. We may
content ourselves with investigating some general characters, that most
strongly mark the condition of the times, and the manners of the men,
their pretensions, their motives, their fate, and their destructive
consequences of their usurpation.  <span
id="fr_976"></span>[159](#fn_976.md)

It is sufficiently known, that the odious appellation of Tyrant was
often employed by the ancients to express the illegal seizure of supreme
power, without any reference to the abuse of it. Several of the
pretenders, who raised the standard of rebellion against the emperor
Gallienus, were shining models of virtue, and almost all possessed a
considerable share of vigor and ability. Their merit had recommended
them to the favor of Valerian, and gradually promoted them to the most
important commands of the empire. The generals, who assumed the title of
Augustus, were either respected by their troops for their able conduct
and severe discipline, or admired for valor and success in war, or
beloved for frankness and generosity. The field of victory was often the
scene of their election; and even the armorer Marius, the most
contemptible of all the candidates for the purple, was distinguished,
however by intrepid courage, matchless strength, and blunt honesty.
 <span id="fr_977"></span>[160](#fn_977.md) His mean and recent trade cast,
indeed, an air of ridicule on his elevation;  <span
id="fr_978"></span>[\*\_0082](#fn_978.md) but his birth could not be more
obscure than was that of the greater part of his rivals, who were born
of peasants, and enlisted in the army as private soldiers. In times of
confusion, every active genius finds the place assigned him by nature:
in a general state of war, military merit is the road to glory and to
greatness. Of the nineteen tyrants Tetricus only was a senator; Piso
alone was a noble. The blood of Numa, through twenty-eight successive
generations, ran in the veins of Calphurnius Piso,  <span
id="fr_979"></span>[161](#fn_979.md) who, by female alliances, claimed a
right of exhibiting, in his house, the images of Crassus and of the
great Pompey.  <span id="fr_980"></span>[162](#fn_980.md) His ancestors had
been repeatedly dignified with all the honors which the commonwealth
could bestow; and of all the ancient families of Rome, the Calphurnian
alone had survived the tyranny of the Caesars. The personal qualities of
Piso added new lustre to his race. The usurper Valens, by whose order he
was killed, confessed, with deep remorse, that even an enemy ought to
have respected the sanctity of Piso; and although he died in arms
against Gallienus, the senate, with the emperor's generous permission,
decreed the triumphal ornaments to the memory of so virtuous a rebel.
 <span id="fr_981"></span>[163](#fn_981.md)

The lieutenants of Valerian were grateful to the father, whom they
esteemed. They disdained to serve the luxurious indolence of his
unworthy son. The throne of the Roman world was unsupported by any
principle of loyalty; and treason against such a prince might easily be
considered as patriotism to the state. Yet if we examine with candor the
conduct of these usurpers, it will appear, that they were much oftener
driven into rebellion by their fears, than urged to it by their
ambition. They dreaded the cruel suspicions of Gallienus; they equally
dreaded the capricious violence of their troops. If the dangerous favor
of the army had imprudently declared them deserving of the purple, they
were marked for sure destruction; and even prudence would counsel them
to secure a short enjoyment of empire, and rather to try the fortune of
war than to expect the hand of an executioner. When the clamor of the
soldiers invested the reluctant victims with the ensigns of sovereign
authority, they sometimes mourned in secret their approaching fate. "You
have lost," said Saturninus, on the day of his elevation, "you have lost
a useful commander, and you have made a very wretched emperor."  <span
id="fr_982"></span>[164](#fn_982.md)

The apprehensions of Saturninus were justified by the repeated
experience of revolutions. Of the nineteen tyrants who started up under
the reign of Gallienus, there was not one who enjoyed a life of peace,
or a natural death. As soon as they were invested with the bloody
purple, they inspired their adherents with the same fears and ambition
which had occasioned their own revolt. Encompassed with domestic
conspiracy, military sedition, and civil war, they trembled on the edge
of precipices, in which, after a longer or shorter term of anxiety, they
were inevitably lost. These precarious monarchs received, however, such
honors as the flattery of their respective armies and provinces could
bestow; but their claim, founded on rebellion, could never obtain the
sanction of law or history. Italy, Rome, and the senate, constantly
adhered to the cause of Gallienus, and he alone was considered as the
sovereign of the empire. That prince condescended, indeed, to
acknowledge the victorious arms of Odenathus, who deserved the honorable
distinction, by the respectful conduct which he always maintained
towards the son of Valerian. With the general applause of the Romans,
and the consent of Gallienus, the senate conferred the title of Augustus
on the brave Palmyrenian; and seemed to intrust him with the government
of the East, which he already possessed, in so independent a manner,
that, like a private succession, he bequeathed it to his illustrious
widow, Zenobia.  <span id="fr_983"></span>[165](#fn_983.md) The rapid and
perpetual transitions from the cottage to the throne, and from the
throne to the grave, might have amused an indifferent philosopher; were
it possible for a philosopher to remain indifferent amidst the general
calamities of human kind. The election of these precarious emperors,
their power and their death, were equally destructive to their subjects
and adherents. The price of their fatal elevation was instantly
discharged to the troops by an immense donative, drawn from the bowels
of the exhausted people. However virtuous was their character, however
pure their intentions, they found themselves reduced to the hard
necessity of supporting their usurpation by frequent acts of rapine and
cruelty. When they fell, they involved armies and provinces in their
fall. There is still extant a most savage mandate from Gallienus to one
of his ministers, after the suppression of Ingenuus, who had assumed the
purple in Illyricum. "It is not enough," says that soft but inhuman
prince, "that you exterminate such as have appeared in arms; the chance
of battle might have served me as effectually. The male sex of every age
must be extirpated; provided that, in the execution of the children and
old men, you can contrive means to save our reputation. Let every one
die who has dropped an expression, who has entertained a thought against
me, against me, the son of Valerian, the father and brother of so many
princes.  <span id="fr_984"></span>[166](#fn_984.md) Remember that Ingenuus
was made emperor: tear, kill, hew in pieces. I write to you with my own
hand, and would inspire you with my own feelings."  <span
id="fr_985"></span>[167](#fn_985.md) Whilst the public forces of the state
were dissipated in private quarrels, the defenceless provinces lay
exposed to every invader. The bravest usurpers were compelled, by the
perplexity of their situation, to conclude ignominious treaties with the
common enemy, to purchase with oppressive tributes the neutrality or
services of the Barbarians, and to introduce hostile and independent
nations into the heart of the Roman monarchy.  <span
id="fr_986"></span>[168](#fn_986.md)

Such were the barbarians, and such the tyrants, who, under the reigns of
Valerian and Gallienus, dismembered the provinces, and reduced the
empire to the lowest pitch of disgrace and ruin, from whence it seemed
impossible that it should ever emerge. As far as the barrenness of
materials would permit, we have attempted to trace, with order and
perspicuity, the general events of that calamitous period. There still
remain some particular facts; I. The disorders of Sicily; II. The
tumults of Alexandria; and, III. The rebellion of the Isaurians, which
may serve to reflect a strong light on the horrid picture.

I. Whenever numerous troops of banditti, multiplied by success and
impunity, publicly defy, instead of eluding the justice of their
country, we may safely infer, that the excessive weakness of the
government is felt and abused by the lowest ranks of the community. The
situation of Sicily preserved it from the Barbarians; nor could the
disarmed province have supported a usurper. The sufferings of that once
flourishing and still fertile island were inflicted by baser hands. A
licentious crowd of slaves and peasants reigned for a while over the
plundered country, and renewed the memory of the servile wars of more
ancient times.  <span id="fr_987"></span>[169](#fn_987.md) Devastations, of
which the husbandman was either the victim or the accomplice, must have
ruined the agriculture of Sicily; and as the principal estates were the
property of the opulent senators of Rome, who often enclosed within a
farm the territory of an old republic, it is not improbable, that this
private injury might affect the capital more deeply, than all the
conquests of the Goths or the Persians. II. The foundation of Alexandria
was a noble design, at once conceived and executed by the son of Philip.
The beautiful and regular form of that great city, second only to Rome
itself, comprehended a circumference of fifteen miles;  <span
id="fr_988"></span>[170](#fn_988.md) it was peopled by three hundred
thousand free inhabitants, besides at least an equal number of slaves.
 <span id="fr_989"></span>[171](#fn_989.md) The lucrative trade of Arabia
and India flowed through the port of Alexandria, to the capital and
provinces of the empire.  <span id="fr_990"></span>[\*\_0083](#fn_990.md)
Idleness was unknown. Some were employed in blowing of glass, others in
weaving of linen, others again manufacturing the papyrus. Either sex,
and every age, was engaged in the pursuits of industry, nor did even the
blind or the lame want occupations suited to their condition.  <span
id="fr_991"></span>[172](#fn_991.md) But the people of Alexandria, a
various mixture of nations, united the vanity and inconstancy of the
Greeks with the superstition and obstinacy of the Egyptians. The most
trifling occasion, a transient scarcity of flesh or lentils, the neglect
of an accustomed salutation, a mistake of precedency in the public
baths, or even a religious dispute,  <span
id="fr_992"></span>[173](#fn_992.md) were at any time sufficient to kindle
a sedition among that vast multitude, whose resentments were furious and
implacable.  <span id="fr_993"></span>[174](#fn_993.md) After the captivity
of Valerian and the insolence of his son had relaxed the authority of
the laws, the Alexandrians abandoned themselves to the ungoverned rage
of their passions, and their unhappy country was the theatre of a civil
war, which continued (with a few short and suspicious truces) above
twelve years.  <span id="fr_994"></span>[175](#fn_994.md) All intercourse
was cut off between the several quarters of the afflicted city, every
street was polluted with blood, every building of strength converted
into a citadel; nor did the tumults subside till a considerable part of
Alexandria was irretrievably ruined. The spacious and magnificent
district of Bruchion,  <span id="fr_995"></span>[\*\*\_0083](#fn_995.md)
with its palaces and musaeum, the residence of the kings and
philosophers of Egypt, is described above a century afterwards, as
already reduced to its present state of dreary solitude.  <span
id="fr_996"></span>[176](#fn_996.md)

III\. The obscure rebellion of Trebellianus, who assumed the purple in
Isauria, a petty province of Asia Minor, was attended with strange and
memorable consequences. The pageant of royalty was soon destroyed by an
officer of Gallienus; but his followers, despairing of mercy, resolved
to shake off their allegiance, not only to the emperor, but to the
empire, and suddenly returned to the savage manners from which they had
never perfectly been reclaimed. Their craggy rocks, a branch of the
wide-extended Taurus, protected their inaccessible retreat. The tillage
of some fertile valleys  <span id="fr_997"></span>[177](#fn_997.md)
supplied them with necessaries, and a habit of rapine with the luxuries
of life. In the heart of the Roman monarchy, the Isaurians long
continued a nation of wild barbarians. Succeeding princes, unable to
reduce them to obedience, either by arms or policy, were compelled to
acknowledge their weakness, by surrounding the hostile and independent
spot with a strong chain of fortifications,  <span
id="fr_998"></span>[178](#fn_998.md) which often proved insufficient to
restrain the incursions of these domestic foes. The Isaurians, gradually
extending their territory to the sea-coast, subdued the western and
mountainous part of Cilicia, formerly the nest of those daring pirates,
against whom the republic had once been obliged to exert its utmost
force, under the conduct of the great Pompey.  <span
id="fr_999"></span>[179](#fn_999.md)

Our habits of thinking so fondly connect the order of the universe with
the fate of man, that this gloomy period of history has been decorated
with inundations, earthquakes, uncommon meteors, preternatural darkness,
and a crowd of prodigies fictitious or exaggerated.  <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[180](#fn_1000.md) But a long and general famine was a
calamity of a more serious kind. It was the inevitable consequence of
rapine and oppression, which extirpated the produce of the present, and
the hope of future harvests. Famine is almost always followed by
epidemical diseases, the effect of scanty and unwholesome food. Other
causes must, however, have contributed to the furious plague, which,
from the year two hundred and fifty to the year two hundred and
sixty-five, raged without interruption in every province, every city,
and almost every family, of the Roman empire. During some time five
thousand persons died daily in Rome; and many towns, that had escaped
the hands of the Barbarians, were entirely depopulated.  <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[181](#fn_1001.md)

We have the knowledge of a very curious circumstance, of some use
perhaps in the melancholy calculation of human calamities. An exact
register was kept at Alexandria of all the citizens entitled to receive
the distribution of corn. It was found, that the ancient number of those
comprised between the ages of forty and seventy, had been equal to the
whole sum of claimants, from fourteen to fourscore years of age, who
remained alive after the reign of Gallienus.  <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[182](#fn_1002.md) Applying this authentic fact to the
most correct tables of mortality, it evidently proves, that above half
the people of Alexandria had perished; and could we venture to extend
the analogy to the other provinces, we might suspect, that war,
pestilence, and famine, had consumed, in a few years, the moiety of the
human species.  <span id="fr_1003"></span>[183](#fn_1003.md)

of Ammianus Marcellinus, to the reign of Gallienus, xxiii. 5.

Note: Heyne, in his note on Zosimus, contests this opinion of Gibbon and
observes, that the testimony of Ammianus is in fact by no means clear,
decisive. Gallienus and Valerian reigned together. Zosimus, in a

of Valerian. - M.

himself records a speech of the emperor Galerius, which alludes to the

his pride and his vengeance on a fallen foe. - M.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[151](daf01032.htm#fr_967.md) One of these
epistles is from Artavasdes, king of Armenia; since Armenia was then a
province of Persia, the king, the kingdom, and the epistle must be
fictitious.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[153](daf01032.htm#fr_969.md) There is still
extant a very pretty Epithalamium, composed by Gallienus for the
nuptials of his nephews: -

"Ite ait, O juvenes, pariter sudate medullis Omnibus, inter vos: non
murmura vestra columbae, Brachia non hederae, non vincant oscula
conchae."

<span id="fn_970"></span>[154](daf01032.htm#fr_970.md) He was on the point
of giving Plotinus a ruined city of Campania to try the experiment of
realizing Plato's Republic. See the Life of Plotinus, by Porphyry, in
Fabricius's Biblioth. Graec. l. iv.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[155](daf01032.htm#fr_971.md) A medal which bears
the head of Gallienus has perplexed the antiquarians by its legend and
reverse; the former Gallienoe Augustoe, the latter Ubique Pax. M.
Spanheim supposes that the coin was struck by some of the enemies of
Gallienus, and was designed as a severe satire on that effeminate
prince. But as the use of irony may seem unworthy of the gravity of the
Roman mint, M. de Vallemont has deduced from a passage of Trebellius
Pollio (Hist. Aug. p. 198) an ingenious and natural solution. Galliena
was first cousin to the emperor. By delivering Africa from the usurper
Celsus, she deserved the title of Augusta. On a medal in the French
king's collection, we read a similar inscription of Faustina Augusta
round the head of Marcus Aurelius. With regard to the Ubique Pax, it is
easily explained by the vanity of Gallienus, who seized, perhaps, the
occasion of some momentary calm. See Nouvelles de la Republique des
Lettres, Janvier, 1700, p. 21 - 34.

<span id="fn_972"></span>[156](daf01032.htm#fr_972.md) This singular
character has, I believe, been fairly transmitted to us. The reign of
his immediate successor was short and busy; and the historians who wrote
before the elevation of the family of Constantine could not have the
most remote interest to misrepresent the character of Gallienus.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[157](daf01032.htm#fr_973.md) Pollio expresses the
most minute anxiety to complete the number.

Note: Compare a dissertation of Manso on the thirty tyrants at the end
of his Leben Constantius des Grossen. Breslau, 1817. - M.

<span id="fn_974"></span>[158](daf01032.htm#fr_974.md) The place of his

<span id="fn_975"></span>[\*\_0081](daf01032.htm#fr_975.md) Captain Smyth,

subjoins this list: - 1. 2. 3. Of those whose coins Those whose coins

nephews, and nieces of the emperor formed a very numerous royal family.
