### Chapter II: The Internal Prosperity In The Age Of The Antonines. Part I.

Of The Union And Internal Prosperity Of The Roman Empire, In The Age Of
The Antonines.

It is not alone by the rapidity, or extent of conquest, that we should
estimate the greatness of Rome. The sovereign of the Russian deserts
commands a larger portion of the globe. In the seventh summer after his
passage of the Hellespont, Alexander erected the Macedonian trophies on
the banks of the Hyphasis.  <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md) Within
less than a century, the irresistible Zingis, and the Mogul princes of
his race, spread their cruel devastations and transient empire from the
Sea of China, to the confines of Egypt and Germany.  <span
id="fr_101"></span>[2](#fn_101.md) But the firm edifice of Roman power was
raised and preserved by the wisdom of ages. The obedient provinces of
Trajan and the Antonines were united by laws, and adorned by arts. They
might occasionally suffer from the partial abuse of delegated authority;
but the general principle of government was wise, simple, and
beneficent. They enjoyed the religion of their ancestors, whilst in
civil honors and advantages they were exalted, by just degrees, to an
equality with their conquerors.

I. The policy of the emperors and the senate, as far as it concerned
religion, was happily seconded by the reflections of the enlightened,
and by the habits of the superstitious, part of their subjects. The
various modes of worship, which prevailed in the Roman world, were all
considered by the people, as equally true; by the philosopher, as
equally false; and by the magistrate, as equally useful. And thus
toleration produced not only mutual indulgence, but even religious
concord.

The superstition of the people was not imbittered by any mixture of
theological rancor; nor was it confined by the chains of any speculative
system. The devout polytheist, though fondly attached to his national
rites, admitted with implicit faith the different religions of the
earth.  <span id="fr_102"></span>[3](#fn_102.md) Fear, gratitude, and
curiosity, a dream or an omen, a singular disorder, or a distant
journey, perpetually disposed him to multiply the articles of his
belief, and to enlarge the list of his protectors. The thin texture of
the Pagan mythology was interwoven with various but not discordant
materials. As soon as it was allowed that sages and heroes, who had
lived or who had died for the benefit of their country, were exalted to
a state of power and immortality, it was universally confessed, that
they deserved, if not the adoration, at least the reverence, of all
mankind. The deities of a thousand groves and a thousand streams
possessed, in peace, their local and respective influence; nor could the
Romans who deprecated the wrath of the Tiber, deride the Egyptian who
presented his offering to the beneficent genius of the Nile. The visible
powers of nature, the planets, and the elements were the same throughout
the universe. The invisible governors of the moral world were inevitably
cast in a similar mould of fiction and allegory. Every virtue, and even
vice, acquired its divine representative; every art and profession its
patron, whose attributes, in the most distant ages and countries, were
uniformly derived from the character of their peculiar votaries. A
republic of gods of such opposite tempers and interests required, in
every system, the moderating hand of a supreme magistrate, who, by the
progress of knowledge and flattery, was gradually invested with the
sublime perfections of an Eternal Parent, and an Omnipotent Monarch.
 <span id="fr_103"></span>[4](#fn_103.md) Such was the mild spirit of
antiquity, that the nations were less attentive to the difference, than
to the resemblance, of their religious worship. The Greek, the Roman,
and the Barbarian, as they met before their respective altars, easily
persuaded themselves, that under various names, and with various
ceremonies, they adored the same deities.  <span
id="fr_104"></span>[5](#fn_104.md) The elegant mythology of Homer gave a
beautiful, and almost a regular form, to the polytheism of the ancient
world.

The philosophers of Greece deduced their morals from the nature of man,
rather than from that of God. They meditated, however, on the Divine
Nature, as a very curious and important speculation; and in the profound
inquiry, they displayed the strength and weakness of the human
understanding.  <span id="fr_105"></span>[6](#fn_105.md) Of the four most
celebrated schools, the Stoics and the Platonists endeavored to
reconcile the jaring interests of reason and piety. They have left us
the most sublime proofs of the existence and perfections of the first
cause; but, as it was impossible for them to conceive the creation of
matter, the workman in the Stoic philosophy was not sufficiently
distinguished from the work; whilst, on the contrary, the spiritual God
of Plato and his disciples resembled an idea, rather than a substance.
The opinions of the Academics and Epicureans were of a less religious
cast; but whilst the modest science of the former induced them to doubt,
the positive ignorance of the latter urged them to deny, the providence
of a Supreme Ruler. The spirit of inquiry, prompted by emulation, and
supported by freedom, had divided the public teachers of philosophy into
a variety of contending sects; but the ingenious youth, who, from every
part, resorted to Athens, and the other seats of learning in the Roman
empire, were alike instructed in every school to reject and to despise
the religion of the multitude. How, indeed, was it possible that a
philosopher should accept, as divine truths, the idle tales of the
poets, and the incoherent traditions of antiquity; or that he should
adore, as gods, those imperfect beings whom he must have despised, as
men? Against such unworthy adversaries, Cicero condescended to employ
the arms of reason and eloquence; but the satire of Lucian was a much
more adequate, as well as more efficacious, weapon. We may be well
assured, that a writer, conversant with the world, would never have
ventured to expose the gods of his country to public ridicule, had they
not already been the objects of secret contempt among the polished and
enlightened orders of society.  <span id="fr_106"></span>[7](#fn_106.md)

Notwithstanding the fashionable irreligion which prevailed in the age of
the Antonines, both the interest of the priests and the credulity of the
people were sufficiently respected. In their writings and conversation,
the philosophers of antiquity asserted the independent dignity of
reason; but they resigned their actions to the commands of law and of
custom. Viewing, with a smile of pity and indulgence, the various errors
of the vulgar, they diligently practised the ceremonies of their
fathers, devoutly frequented the temples of the gods; and sometimes
condescending to act a part on the theatre of superstition, they
concealed the sentiments of an atheist under the sacerdotal robes.
Reasoners of such a temper were scarcely inclined to wrangle about their
respective modes of faith, or of worship. It was indifferent to them
what shape the folly of the multitude might choose to assume; and they
approached with the same inward contempt, and the same external
reverence, the altars of the Libyan, the Olympian, or the Capitoline
Jupiter.  <span id="fr_107"></span>[8](#fn_107.md)

It is not easy to conceive from what motives a spirit of persecution
could introduce itself into the Roman councils. The magistrates could
not be actuated by a blind, though honest bigotry, since the magistrates
were themselves philosophers; and the schools of Athens had given laws
to the senate. They could not be impelled by ambition or avarice, as the
temporal and ecclesiastical powers were united in the same hands. The
pontiffs were chosen among the most illustrious of the senators; and the
office of Supreme Pontiff was constantly exercised by the emperors
themselves. They knew and valued the advantages of religion, as it is
connected with civil government. They encouraged the public festivals
which humanize the manners of the people. They managed the arts of
divination as a convenient instrument of policy; and they respected, as
the firmest bond of society, the useful persuasion, that, either in this
or in a future life, the crime of perjury is most assuredly punished by
the avenging gods.  <span id="fr_108"></span>[9](#fn_108.md) But whilst
they acknowledged the general advantages of religion, they were
convinced that the various modes of worship contributed alike to the
same salutary purposes; and that, in every country, the form of
superstition, which had received the sanction of time and experience,
was the best adapted to the climate, and to its inhabitants. Avarice and
taste very frequently despoiled the vanquished nations of the elegant
statues of their gods, and the rich ornaments of their temples;  <span
id="fr_109"></span>[10](#fn_109.md) but, in the exercise of the religion
which they derived from their ancestors, they uniformly experienced the
indulgence, and even protection, of the Roman conquerors. The province
of Gaul seems, and indeed only seems, an exception to this universal
toleration. Under the specious pretext of abolishing human sacrifices,
the emperors Tiberius and Claudius suppressed the dangerous power of the
Druids:  <span id="fr_110"></span>[11](#fn_110.md) but the priests
themselves, their gods and their altars, subsisted in peaceful obscurity
till the final destruction of Paganism.  <span
id="fr_111"></span>[12](#fn_111.md)

Rome, the capital of a great monarchy, was incessantly filled with
subjects and strangers from every part of the world,  <span
id="fr_112"></span>[13](#fn_112.md) who all introduced and enjoyed the
favorite superstitions of their native country.  <span
id="fr_113"></span>[14](#fn_113.md) Every city in the empire was justified
in maintaining the purity of its ancient ceremonies; and the Roman
senate, using the common privilege, sometimes interposed, to check this
inundation of foreign rites.  <span
id="fr_114"></span>[\*\_0007](#fn_114.md) The Egyptian superstition, of all
the most contemptible and abject, was frequently prohibited: the temples
of Serapis and Isis demolished, and their worshippers banished from Rome
and Italy.  <span id="fr_115"></span>[15](#fn_115.md) But the zeal of
fanaticism prevailed over the cold and feeble efforts of policy. The
exiles returned, the proselytes multiplied, the temples were restored
with increasing splendor, and Isis and Serapis at length assumed their
place among the Roman Deities.  <span id="fr_116"></span>[16](#fn_117.md)
Nor was this indulgence a departure from the old maxims of government.
In the purest ages of the commonwealth, Cybele and Aesculapius had been
invited by solemn embassies;  <span id="fr_117"></span>[17](#fn_118.md) and
it was customary to tempt the protectors of besieged cities, by the
promise of more distinguished honors than they possessed in their native
country.  <span id="fr_118"></span>[18](#fn_119.md) Rome gradually became
the common temple of her subjects; and the freedom of the city was
bestowed on all the gods of mankind.  <span
id="fr_119"></span>[19](#fn_120.md)

II\. The narrow policy of preserving, without any foreign mixture, the
pure blood of the ancient citizens, had checked the fortune, and
hastened the ruin, of Athens and Sparta. The aspiring genius of Rome
sacrificed vanity to ambition, and deemed it more prudent, as well as
honorable, to adopt virtue and merit for her own wheresoever they were
found, among slaves or strangers, enemies or barbarians.  <span
id="fr_121"></span>[20](#fn_121.md) During the most flourishing aera of the
Athenian commonwealth, the number of citizens gradually decreased from
about thirty  <span id="fr_122"></span>[21](#fn_122.md) to twenty-one
thousand.  <span id="fr_123"></span>[22](#fn_123.md) If, on the contrary,
we study the growth of the Roman republic, we may discover, that,
notwithstanding the incessant demands of wars and colonies, the
citizens, who, in the first census of Servius Tullius, amounted to no
more than eighty-three thousand, were multiplied, before the
commencement of the social war, to the number of four hundred and
sixty-three thousand men, able to bear arms in the service of their
country.  <span id="fr_124"></span>[23](#fn_124.md) When the allies of Rome
claimed an equal share of honors and privileges, the senate indeed
preferred the chance of arms to an ignominious concession. The Samnites
and the Lucanians paid the severe penalty of their rashness; but the
rest of the Italian states, as they successively returned to their duty,
were admitted into the bosom of the republic,  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[24](#fn_125.md) and soon contributed to the ruin of
public freedom. Under a democratical government, the citizens exercise
the powers of sovereignty; and those powers will be first abused, and
afterwards lost, if they are committed to an unwieldy multitude. But
when the popular assemblies had been suppressed by the administration of
the emperors, the conquerors were distinguished from the vanquished
nations, only as the first and most honorable order of subjects; and
their increase, however rapid, was no longer exposed to the same
dangers. Yet the wisest princes, who adopted the maxims of Augustus,
guarded with the strictest care the dignity of the Roman name, and
diffused the freedom of the city with a prudent liberality.  <span

<span id="fn_100"></span>[1](daf01007.htm#fr_100.md) They were erected
about the midway between Lahor and Delhi. The conquests of Alexander in
Hindostan were confined to the Punjab, a country watered by the five
great streams of the Indus.

Note: The Hyphasis is one of the five rivers which join the Indus or the
Sind, after having traversed the province of the Pendj-ab - a name which
in Persian, signifies five rivers. \* \* \* G. The five rivers were, 1.
The Hydaspes, now the Chelum, Behni, or Bedusta, (Sanscrit, Vitastha,
Arrow-swift.) 2. The Acesines, the Chenab, (Sanscrit, Chandrabhaga,
Moon-gift.) 3. Hydraotes, the Ravey, or Iraoty, (Sanscrit, Iravati.) 4.
Hyphasis, the Beyah, (Sanscrit, Vepasa, Fetterless.) 5. The Satadru,
(Sanscrit, the Hundred Streamed,) the Sutledj, known first to the Greeks
in the time of Ptolemy. Rennel. Vincent, Commerce of Anc. book 2.

memoir of Lieut. Burnes, Journal of London Geogr. Society, vol. iii. p.
2, with the travels of that very able writer. Compare Gibbon's own note,
c. lxv. note 25. - M substit. for G.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[2](daf01007.htm#fr_101.md) See M. de Guignes,
Histoire des Huns, l. xv. xvi. and xvii.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[3](daf01007.htm#fr_102.md) There is not any
writer who describes in so lively a manner as Herodotus the true genius
of polytheism. The best commentary may be found in Mr. Hume's Natural
History of Religion; and the best contrast in Bossuet's Universal
History. Some obscure traces of an intolerant spirit appear in the
conduct of the Egyptians, (see Juvenal, Sat. xv.;) and the Christians,
as well as Jews, who lived under the Roman empire, formed a very
important exception; so important indeed, that the discussion will
require a distinct chapter of this work.

Note: M. Constant, in his very learned and eloquent work, "Sur la
Religion," with the two additional volumes, "Du Polytheisme Romain," has
considered the whole history of polytheism in a tone of philosophy,
which, without subscribing to all his opinions, we may be permitted to
admire. "The boasted tolerance of polytheism did not rest upon the
respect due from society to the freedom of individual opinion. The
polytheistic nations, tolerant as they were towards each other, as
separate states, were not the less ignorant of the eternal principle,
the only basis of enlightened toleration, that every one has a right to
worship God in the manner which seems to him the best. Citizens, on the
contrary, were bound to conform to the religion of the state; they had
not the liberty to adopt a foreign religion, though that religion might
be legally recognized in their own city, for the strangers who were its
votaries." - Sur la Religion, v. 184. Du. Polyth. Rom. ii. 308. At this
time, the growing religious indifference, and the general administration
of the empire by Romans, who, being strangers, would do no more than
protect, not enlist themselves in the cause of the local superstitions,
had introduced great laxity. But intolerance was clearly the theory both
of the Greek and Roman law. The subject is more fully considered in
another place. - M.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[4](daf01007.htm#fr_103.md) The rights, powers,
and pretensions of the sovereign of Olympus are very clearly described
in the xvth book of the Iliad; in the Greek original, I mean; for Mr.
Pope, without perceiving it, has improved the theology of Homer.

Note: There is a curious coincidence between Gibbon's expressions and
those of the newly-recovered "De Republica" of Cicero, though the
argument is rather the converse, lib. i. c. 36. "Sive haec ad utilitatem
vitae constitute sint a principibus rerum publicarum, ut rex putaretur
unus esse in coelo, qui nutu, ut ait Homerus, totum Olympum converteret,
idemque et rex et patos haberetur omnium." - M.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[5](daf01007.htm#fr_104.md) See, for instance,
Caesar de Bell. Gall. vi. 17. Within a century or two, the Gauls
themselves applied to their gods the names of Mercury, Mars, Apollo, &c.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[6](daf01007.htm#fr_105.md) The admirable work of
Cicero de Natura Deorum is the best clew we have to guide us through the
dark and profound abyss. He represents with candor, and confutes with
subtlety, the opinions of the philosophers.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[7](daf01007.htm#fr_106.md) I do not pretend to
assert, that, in this irreligious age, the natural terrors of
superstition, dreams, omens, apparitions, &c., had lost their efficacy.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[8](daf01007.htm#fr_107.md) Socrates, Epicurus,
Cicero, and Plutarch always inculcated a decent reverence for the
religion of their own country, and of mankind. The devotion of Epicurus
was assiduous and exemplary. Diogen. Laert. x. 10.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[9](daf01007.htm#fr_108.md) Polybius, l. vi. c.
53, 54. Juvenal, Sat. xiii. laments that in his time this apprehension
had lost much of its effect.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[10](daf01007.htm#fr_109.md) See the fate of
Syracuse, Tarentum, Ambracia, Corinth, &c., the conduct of Verres, in
Cicero, (Actio ii. Orat. 4,) and the usual practice of governors, in the
viiith Satire of Juvenal.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[\*\_0007](daf01007.htm#fr_114.md) Yet the worship
of foreign gods at Rome was only guarantied to the natives of those
countries from whence they came. The Romans administered the priestly
offices only to the gods of their fathers. Gibbon, throughout the whole
preceding sketch of the opinions of the Romans and their subjects, has
shown through what causes they were free from religious hatred and its
consequences. But, on the other hand the internal state of these
religions, the infidelity and hypocrisy of the upper orders, the
indifference towards all religion, in even the better part of the common
people, during the last days of the republic, and under the Caesars, and
the corrupting principles of the philosophers, had exercised a very
pernicious influence on the manners, and even on the constitution. - W.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[15](daf01007.htm#fr_115.md) In the year of Rome
701, the temple of Isis and Serapis was demolished by the order of the
Senate, (Dion Cassius, l. xl. p. 252,) and even by the hands of the
consul, (Valerius Maximus, l. 3.)  <span
id="fr_120"></span>[!\_0008](#fn_116.md) After the death of Caesar it was
restored at the public expense, (Dion. l. xlvii. p. 501.) When Augustus
was in Egypt, he revered the majesty of Serapis, (Dion, l. li. p. 647;)
but in the Pomaerium of Rome, and a mile round it, he prohibited the
worship of the Egyptian gods, (Dion, l. liii. p. 679; l. liv. p. 735.)
They remained, however, very fashionable under his reign (Ovid. de Art.
Amand. l. i.) and that of his successor, till the justice of Tiberius
was provoked to some acts of severity. (See Tacit. Annal. ii. 85.
Joseph. Antiquit. l. xviii. c. 3.)

Note: See, in the pictures from the walls of Pompeii, the representation
of an Isiac temple and worship. Vestiges of Egyptian worship have been
traced in Gaul, and, I am informed, recently in Britain, in excavations
at York. - M.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[!\_0008](daf01007.htm#fr_120.md) Gibbon here
blends into one, two events, distant a hundred and sixty-six years from
each other. It was in the year of Rome 535, that the senate having
ordered the destruction of the temples of Isis and Serapis, the workman
would lend his hand; and the consul, L. Paulus himself (Valer. Max. 1,
3) seized the axe, to give the first blow. Gibbon attribute this
circumstance to the second demolition, which took place in the year 701
and which he considers as the first. - W.

Note: Democratic states, observes Denina, (delle Revoluz. d' Italia, l.

citizenship; monarchies or oligarchies willingly multiply the numbers of
their free subjects. The most remarkable accessions to the strength of
Rome, by the aggregation of conquered and foreign nations, took place
under the regal and patrician - we may add, the Imperial government. -

464.) He rejects the census of Servius fullius as unhistoric, (vol. ii.
p. 78, et seq.,) and he establishes the principle that the census
comprehended all the confederate cities which had the right of

Augustus.
