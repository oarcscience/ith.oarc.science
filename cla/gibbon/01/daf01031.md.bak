### Chapter X: Emperors Decius, Gallus, Aemilianus, Valerian And Gallienus. Part III.

The Romans had long experienced the daring valor of the people of Lower
Germany. The union of their strength threatened Gaul with a more
formidable invasion, and required the presence of Gallienus, the heir
and colleague of Imperial power.  <span id="fr_886"></span>[75](#fn_886.md)
Whilst that prince, and his infant son Salonius, displayed, in the court
of Treves, the majesty of the empire its armies were ably conducted by
their general, Posthumus, who, though he afterwards betrayed the family
of Valerian, was ever faithful to the great interests of the monarchy.
The treacherous language of panegyrics and medals darkly announces a
long series of victories. Trophies and titles attest (if such evidence
can attest) the fame of Posthumus, who is repeatedly styled the
Conqueror of the Germans, and the Savior of Gaul.  <span
id="fr_887"></span>[76](#fn_887.md)

But a single fact, the only one indeed of which we have any distinct
knowledge, erases, in a great measure, these monuments of vanity and
adulation. The Rhine, though dignified with the title of Safeguard of
the provinces, was an imperfect barrier against the daring spirit of
enterprise with which the Franks were actuated. Their rapid devastations
stretched from the river to the foot of the Pyrenees; nor were they
stopped by those mountains. Spain, which had never dreaded, was unable
to resist, the inroads of the Germans. During twelve years, the greatest
part of the reign of Gallie nus, that opulent country was the theatre of
unequal and destructive hostilities. Tarragona, the flourishing capital
of a peaceful province, was sacked and almost destroyed;  <span
id="fr_888"></span>[77](#fn_888.md) and so late as the days of Orosius, who
wrote in the fifth century, wretched cottages, scattered amidst the
ruins of magnificent cities, still recorded the rage of the barbarians.
 <span id="fr_889"></span>[78](#fn_889.md) When the exhausted country no
longer supplied a variety of plunder, the Franks seized on some vessels
in the ports of Spain,  <span id="fr_890"></span>[79](#fn_890.md) and
transported themselves into Mauritania. The distant province was
astonished with the fury of these barbarians, who seemed to fall from a
new world, as their name, manners, and complexion, were equally unknown
on the coast of Africa.  <span id="fr_891"></span>[80](#fn_891.md)

II\. In that part of Upper Saxony, beyond the Elbe, which is at present
called the Marquisate of Lusace, there existed, in ancient times, a
sacred wood, the awful seat of the superstition of the Suevi. None were
permitted to enter the holy precincts, without confessing, by their
servile bonds and suppliant posture, the immediate presence of the
sovereign Deity.  <span id="fr_892"></span>[81](#fn_892.md) Patriotism
contributed, as well as devotion, to consecrate the Sonnenwald, or wood
of the Semnones.  <span id="fr_893"></span>[82](#fn_893.md) It was
universally believed, that the nation had received its first existence
on that sacred spot. At stated periods, the numerous tribes who gloried
in the Suevic blood, resorted thither by their ambassadors; and the
memory of their common extraction was perpetrated by barbaric rites and
human sacrifices. The wide-extended name of Suevi filled the interior
countries of Germany, from the banks of the Oder to those of the Danube.
They were distinguished from the other Germans by their peculiar mode of
dressing their long hair, which they gathered into a rude knot on the
crown of the head; and they delighted in an ornament that showed their
ranks more lofty and terrible in the eyes of the enemy.  <span
id="fr_894"></span>[83](#fn_894.md) Jealous as the Germans were of military
renown, they all confessed the superior valor of the Suevi; and the
tribes of the Usipetes and Tencteri, who, with a vast army, encountered
the dictator Caesar, declared that they esteemed it not a disgrace to
have fled before a people to whose arms the immortal gods themselves
were unequal.  <span id="fr_895"></span>[84](#fn_895.md)

In the reign of the emperor Caracalla, an innumerable swarm of Suevi
appeared on the banks of the Mein, and in the neighborhood of the Roman
provinces, in quest either of food, of plunder, or of glory.  <span
id="fr_896"></span>[85](#fn_896.md) The hasty army of volunteers gradually
coalesced into a great and permanent nation, and as it was composed from
so many different tribes, assumed the name of Alemanni,  <span
id="fr_897"></span>[\*\_0077](#fn_897.md) or Allmen; to denote at once
their various lineage and their common bravery.  <span
id="fr_898"></span>[86](#fn_898.md) The latter was soon felt by the Romans
in many a hostile inroad. The Alemanni fought chiefly on horseback; but
their cavalry was rendered still more formidable by a mixture of light
infantry, selected from the bravest and most active of the youth, whom
frequent exercise had inured to accompany the horsemen in the longest
march, the most rapid charge, or the most precipitate retreat.  <span
id="fr_899"></span>[87](#fn_899.md)

This warlike people of Germans had been astonished by the immense
preparations of Alexander Severus; they were dismayed by the arms of his
successor, a barbarian equal in valor and fierceness to themselves. But
still hovering on the frontiers of the empire, they increased the
general disorder that ensued after the death of Decius. They inflicted
severe wounds on the rich provinces of Gaul; they were the first who
removed the veil that covered the feeble majesty of Italy. A numerous
body of the Alemanni penetrated across the Danube and through the
Rhaetian Alps into the plains of Lombardy, advanced as far as Ravenna,
and displayed the victorious banners of barbarians almost in sight of
Rome.  <span id="fr_900"></span>[88](#fn_900.md)

The insult and the danger rekindled in the senate some sparks of their
ancient virtue. Both the emperors were engaged in far distant wars,
Valerian in the East, and Gallienus on the Rhine. All the hopes and
resources of the Romans were in themselves. In this emergency, the
senators resumed he defence of the republic, drew out the Praetorian
guards, who had been left to garrison the capital, and filled up their
numbers, by enlisting into the public service the stoutest and most
willing of the Plebeians. The Alemanni, astonished with the sudden
appearance of an army more numerous than their own, retired into
Germany, laden with spoil; and their retreat was esteemed as a victory
by the unwarlike Romans.  <span id="fr_901"></span>[89](#fn_901.md)

When Gallienus received the intelligence that his capital was delivered
from the barbarians, he was much less delighted than alarmed with the
courage of the senate, since it might one day prompt them to rescue the
public from domestic tyranny as well as from foreign invasion. His timid
ingratitude was published to his subjects, in an edict which prohibited
the senators from exercising any military employment, and even from
approaching the camps of the legions. But his fears were groundless. The
rich and luxurious nobles, sinking into their natural character,
accepted, as a favor, this disgraceful exemption from military service;
and as long as they were indulged in the enjoyment of their baths, their
theatres, and their villas, they cheerfully resigned the more dangerous
cares of empire to the rough hands of peasants and soldiers.  <span
id="fr_902"></span>[90](#fn_902.md)

Another invasion of the Alemanni, of a more formidable aspect, but more
glorious event, is mentioned by a writer of the lower empire. Three
hundred thousand are said to have been vanquished, in a battle near
Milan, by Gallienus in person, at the head of only ten thousand Romans.
 <span id="fr_903"></span>[91](#fn_903.md) We may, however, with great
probability, ascribe this incredible victory either to the credulity of
the historian, or to some exaggerated exploits of one of the emperor's
lieutenants. It was by arms of a very different nature, that Gallienus
endeavored to protect Italy from the fury of the Germans. He espoused
Pipa, the daughter of a king of the Marcomanni, a Suevic tribe, which
was often confounded with the Alemanni in their wars and conquests.
 <span id="fr_904"></span>[92](#fn_904.md) To the father, as the price of
his alliance, he granted an ample settlement in Pannonia. The native
charms of unpolished beauty seem to have fixed the daughter in the
affections of the inconstant emperor, and the bands of policy were more
firmly connected by those of love. But the haughty prejudice of Rome
still refused the name of marriage to the profane mixture of a citizen
and a barbarian; and has stigmatized the German princess with the
opprobrious title of concubine of Gallienus.  <span
id="fr_905"></span>[93](#fn_905.md)

III\. We have already traced the emigration of the Goths from
Scandinavia, or at least from Prussia, to the mouth of the Borysthenes,
and have followed their victorious arms from the Borysthenes to the
Danube. Under the reigns of Valerian and Gallienus, the frontier of the
last- mentioned river was perpetually infested by the inroads of Germans
and Sarmatians; but it was defended by the Romans with more than usual
firmness and success. The provinces that were the seat of war, recruited
the armies of Rome with an inexhaustible supply of hardy soldiers; and
more than one of these Illyrian peasants attained the station, and
displayed the abilities, of a general. Though flying parties of the
barbarians, who incessantly hovered on the banks of the Danube,
penetrated sometimes to the confines of Italy and Macedonia, their
progress was commonly checked, or their return intercepted, by the
Imperial lieutenants.  <span id="fr_906"></span>[94](#fn_906.md) But the
great stream of the Gothic hostilities was diverted into a very
different channel. The Goths, in their new settlement of the Ukraine,
soon became masters of the northern coast of the Euxine: to the south of
that inland sea were situated the soft and wealthy provinces of Asia
Minor, which possessed all that could attract, and nothing that could
resist, a barbarian conqueror.

The banks of the Borysthenes are only sixty miles distant from the
narrow entrance  <span id="fr_907"></span>[95](#fn_907.md) of the peninsula
of Crim Tartary, known to the ancients under the name of Chersonesus
Taurica.  <span id="fr_908"></span>[96](#fn_908.md) On that inhospitable
shore, Euripides, embellishing with exquisite art the tales of
antiquity, has placed the scene of one of his most affecting tragedies.
 <span id="fr_909"></span>[97](#fn_909.md) The bloody sacrifices of Diana,
the arrival of Orestes and Pylades, and the triumph of virtue and
religion over savage fierceness, serve to represent an historical truth,
that the Tauri, the original inhabitants of the peninsula, were, in some
degree, reclaimed from their brutal manners by a gradual intercourse
with the Grecian colonies, which settled along the maritime coast. The
little kingdom of Bosphorus, whose capital was situated on the Straits,
through which the Maeotis communicates itself to the Euxine, was
composed of degenerate Greeks and half-civilized barbarians. It
subsisted, as an independent state, from the time of the Peloponnesian
war,  <span id="fr_910"></span>[98](#fn_910.md) was at last swallowed up by
the ambition of Mithridates,  <span id="fr_911"></span>[99](#fn_911.md)
and, with the rest of his dominions, sunk under the weight of the Roman
arms. From the reign of Augustus,  <span
id="fr_912"></span>[100](#fn_912.md) the kings of Bosphorus were the
humble, but not useless, allies of the empire. By presents, by arms, and
by a slight fortification drawn across the Isthmus, they effectually
guarded against the roving plunderers of Sarmatia, the access of a
country, which, from its peculiar situation and convenient harbors,
commanded the Euxine Sea and Asia Minor.  <span
id="fr_913"></span>[101](#fn_913.md) As long as the sceptre was possessed
by a lineal succession of kings, they acquitted themselves of their
important charge with vigilance and success. Domestic factions, and the
fears, or private interest, of obscure usurpers, who seized on the
vacant throne, admitted the Goths into the heart of Bosphorus. With the
acquisition of a superfluous waste of fertile soil, the conquerors
obtained the command of a naval force, sufficient to transport their
armies to the coast of Asia.  <span id="fr_914"></span>[102](#fn_914.md)
This ships used in the navigation of the Euxine were of a very singular
construction. They were slight flat-bottomed barks framed of timber
only, without the least mixture of iron, and occasionally covered with a
shelving roof, on the appearance of a tempest.  <span
id="fr_915"></span>[103](#fn_915.md) In these floating houses, the Goths
carelessly trusted themselves to the mercy of an unknown sea, under the
conduct of sailors pressed into the service, and whose skill and
fidelity were equally suspicious. But the hopes of plunder had banished
every idea of danger, and a natural fearlessness of temper supplied in
their minds the more rational confidence, which is the just result of
knowledge and experience. Warriors of such a daring spirit must have
often murmured against the cowardice of their guides, who required the
strongest assurances of a settled calm before they would venture to
embark; and would scarcely ever be tempted to lose sight of the land.
Such, at least, is the practice of the modern Turks;  <span
id="fr_916"></span>[104](#fn_916.md) and they are probably not inferior, in
the art of navigation, to the ancient inhabitants of Bosphorus.

The fleet of the Goths, leaving the coast of Circassia on the left hand,
first appeared before Pityus,  <span id="fr_917"></span>[105](#fn_917.md)
the utmost limits of the Roman provinces; a city provided with a
convenient port, and fortified with a strong wall. Here they met with a
resistance more obstinate than they had reason to expect from the feeble
garrison of a distant fortress. They were repulsed; and their
disappointment seemed to diminish the terror of the Gothic name. As long
as Successianus, an officer of superior rank and merit, defended that
frontier, all their efforts were ineffectual; but as soon as he was
removed by Valerian to a more honorable but less important station, they
resumed the attack of Pityus; and by the destruction of that city,
obliterated the memory of their former disgrace.  <span
id="fr_918"></span>[106](#fn_918.md)

Circling round the eastern extremity of the Euxine Sea, the navigation
from Pityus to Trebizond is about three hundred miles.  <span
id="fr_919"></span>[107](#fn_919.md) The course of the Goths carried them
in sight of the country of Colchis, so famous by the expedition of the
Argonauts; and they even attempted, though without success, to pillage a
rich temple at the mouth of the River Phasis. Trebizond, celebrated in
the retreat of the ten thousand as an ancient colony of Greeks,  <span
id="fr_920"></span>[108](#fn_920.md) derived its wealth and splendor from
the magnificence of the emperor Hadrian, who had constructed an
artificial port on a coast left destitute by nature of secure harbors.
 <span id="fr_921"></span>[109](#fn_921.md) The city was large and
populous; a double enclosure of walls seemed to defy the fury of the
Goths, and the usual garrison had been strengthened by a reenforcement
of ten thousand men. But there are not any advantages capable of
supplying the absence of discipline and vigilance. The numerous garrison
of Trebizond, dissolved in riot and luxury, disdained to guard their
impregnable fortifications. The Goths soon discovered the supine
negligence of the besieged, erected a lofty pile of fascines, ascended
the walls in the silence of the night, and entered the defenceless city
sword in hand. A general massacre of the people ensued, whilst the
affrighted soldiers escaped through the opposite gates of the town. The
most holy temples, and the most splendid edifices, were involved in a
common destruction. The booty that fell into the hands of the Goths was
immense: the wealth of the adjacent countries had been deposited in
Trebizond, as in a secure place of refuge. The number of captives was
incredible, as the victorious barbarians ranged without opposition
through the extensive province of Pontus.  <span
id="fr_922"></span>[110](#fn_922.md) The rich spoils of Trebizond filled a
great fleet of ships that had been found in the port. The robust youth
of the sea-coast were chained to the oar; and the Goths, satisfied with
the success of their first naval expedition, returned in triumph to
their new establishment in the kingdom of Bosphorus.  <span
id="fr_923"></span>[111](#fn_923.md)

The second expedition of the Goths was undertaken with greater powers of
men and ships; but they steered a different course, and, disdaining the
exhausted provinces of Pontus, followed the western coast of the Euxine,
passed before the wide mouths of the Borysthenes, the Niester, and the
Danube, and increasing their fleet by the capture of a great number of
fishing barks, they approached the narrow outlet through which the
Euxine Sea pours its waters into the Mediterranean, and divides the
continents of Europe and Asia. The garrison of Chalcedon was encamped
near the temple of Jupiter Urius, on a promontory that commanded the
entrance of the Strait; and so inconsiderable were the dreaded invasions
of the barbarians that this body of troops surpassed in number the
Gothic army. But it was in numbers alone that they surpassed it. They
deserted with precipitation their advantageous post, and abandoned the
town of Chalcedon, most plentifully stored with arms and money, to the
discretion of the conquerors. Whilst they hesitated whether they should
prefer the sea or land Europe or Asia, for the scene of their
hostilities, a perfidious fugitive pointed out Nicomedia,  <span
id="fr_924"></span>[\*\_0078](#fn_924.md) once the capital of the kings of
Bithynia, as a rich and easy conquest. He guided the march which was
only sixty miles from the camp of Chalcedon,  <span
id="fr_925"></span>[112](#fn_925.md) directed the resistless attack, and
partook of the booty; for the Goths had learned sufficient policy to
reward the traitor whom they detested. Nice, Prusa, Apamaea, Cius,
 <span id="fr_926"></span>[!\_0078](#fn_926.md) cities that had sometimes
rivalled, or imitated, the splendor of Nicomedia, were involved in the
same calamity, which, in a few weeks, raged without control through the
whole province of Bithynia. Three hundred years of peace, enjoyed by the
soft inhabitants of Asia, had abolished the exercise of arms, and
removed the apprehension of danger. The ancient walls were suffered to
moulder away, and all the revenue of the most opulent cities was
reserved for the construction of baths, temples, and theatres.  <span
id="fr_927"></span>[113](#fn_927.md)

When the city of Cyzicus withstood the utmost effort of Mithridates,
 <span id="fr_928"></span>[114](#fn_928.md) it was distinguished by wise
laws, a nava power of two hundred galleys, and three arsenals, of arms,
of military engines, and of corn.  <span
id="fr_929"></span>[115](#fn_929.md) It was still the seat of wealth and
luxury; but of its ancient strength, nothing remained except the
situation, in a little island of the Propontis, connected with the
continent of Asia only by two bridges. From the recent sack of Prusa,
the Goths advanced within eighteen miles.  <span
id="fr_930"></span>[116](#fn_930.md) of the city, which they had devoted to
destruction; but the ruin of Cyzicus was delayed by a fortunate
accident. The season was rainy, and the Lake Apolloniates, the reservoir
of all the springs of Mount Olympus, rose to an uncommon height. The
little river of Rhyndacus, which issues from the lake, swelled into a
broad and rapid stream, and stopped the progress of the Goths. Their
retreat to the maritime city of Heraclea, where the fleet had probably
been stationed, was attended by a long train of wagons, laden with the
spoils of Bithynia, and was marked by the flames of Nico and Nicomedia,
which they wantonly burnt.  <span id="fr_931"></span>[117](#fn_931.md) Some
obscure hints are mentioned of a doubtful combat that secured their
retreat.  <span id="fr_932"></span>[118](#fn_932.md) But even a complete
victory would have been of little moment, as the approach of the
autumnal equinox summoned them to hasten their return. To navigate the
Euxine before the month of May, or after that of September, is esteemed
by the modern Turks the most unquestionable instance of rashness and
folly.  <span id="fr_933"></span>[119](#fn_933.md)

When we are informed that the third fleet, equipped by the Goths in the
ports of Bosphorus, consisted of five hundred sails of ships,  <span
id="fr_934"></span>[120](#fn_934.md) our ready imagination instantly
computes and multiplies the formidable armament; but, as we are assured
by the judicious Strabo,  <span id="fr_935"></span>[121](#fn_935.md) that
the piratical vessels used by the barbarians of Pontus and the Lesser
Scythia, were not capable of containing more than twenty-five or thirty
men we may safely affirm, that fifteen thousand warriors, at the most,
embarked in this great expedition. Impatient of the limits of the
Euxine, they steered their destructive course from the Cimmerian to the
Thracian Bosphorus. When they had almost gained the middle of the
Straits, they were suddenly driven back to the entrance of them; till a
favorable wind, springing up the next day, carried them in a few hours
into the placid sea, or rather lake, of the Propontis. Their landing on
the little island of Cyzicus was attended with the ruin of that ancient
and noble city. From thence issuing again through the narrow passage of
the Hellespont, they pursued their winding navigation amidst the
numerous islands scattered over the Archipelago, or the Aegean Sea. The
assistance of captives and deserters must have been very necessary to
pilot their vessels, and to direct their various incursions, as well on
the coast of Greece as on that of Asia. At length the Gothic fleet
anchored in the port of Piraeus, five miles distant from Athens,  <span
id="fr_936"></span>[122](#fn_936.md) which had attempted to make some
preparations for a vigorous defence. Cleodamus, one of the engineers
employed by the emperor's orders to fortify the maritime cities against
the Goths, had already begun to repair the ancient walls, fallen to
decay since the time of Scylla. The efforts of his skill were
ineffectual, and the barbarians became masters of the native seat of the
muses and the arts. But while the conquerors abandoned themselves to the
license of plunder and intemperance, their fleet, that lay with a
slender guard in the harbor of Piraeus, was unexpectedly attacked by the
brave Dexippus, who, flying with the engineer Cleodamus from the sack of
Athens, collected a hasty band of volunteers, peasants as well as
soldiers, and in some measure avenged the calamities of his country.
 <span id="fr_937"></span>[123](#fn_937.md)

But this exploit, whatever lustre it might shed on the declining age of
Athens, served rather to irritate than to subdue the undaunted spirit of
the northern invaders. A general conflagration blazed out at the same
time in every district of Greece. Thebes and Argos, Corinth and Sparta,
which had formerly waged such memorable wars against each other, were
now unable to bring an army into the field, or even to defend their
ruined fortifications. The rage of war, both by land and by sea, spread
from the eastern point of Sunium to the western coast of Epirus. The
Goths had already advanced within sight of Italy, when the approach of
such imminent danger awakened the indolent Gallienus from his dream of
pleasure. The emperor appeared in arms; and his presence seems to have
checked the ardor, and to have divided the strength, of the enemy.
Naulobatus, a chief of the Heruli, accepted an honorable capitulation,
entered with a large body of his countrymen into the service of Rome,
and was invested with the ornaments of the consular dignity, which had
never before been profaned by the hands of a barbarian.  <span
id="fr_938"></span>[124](#fn_938.md) Great numbers of the Goths, disgusted
with the perils and hardships of a tedious voyage, broke into Maesia,
with a design of forcing their way over the Danube to their settlements
in the Ukraine. The wild attempt would have proved inevitable
destruction, if the discord of the Roman generals had not opened to the
barbarians the means of an escape.  <span
id="fr_939"></span>[125](#fn_939.md) The small remainder of this destroying
host returned on board their vessels; and measuring back their way
through the Hellespont and the Bosphorus, ravaged in their passage the
shores of Troy, whose fame, immortalized by Homer, will probably survive
the memory of the Gothic conquests. As soon as they found themselves in
safety within the basin of the Euxine, they landed at Anchialus in
Thrace, near the foot of Mount Haemus; and, after all their toils,
indulged themselves in the use of those pleasant and salutary hot baths.
What remained of the voyage was a short and easy navigation.  <span
id="fr_940"></span>[126](#fn_940.md) Such was the various fate of this
third and greatest of their naval enterprises. It may seem difficult to
conceive how the original body of fifteen thousand warriors could
sustain the losses and divisions of so bold an adventure. But as their
numbers were gradually wasted by the sword, by shipwrecks, and by the
influence of a warm climate, they were perpetually renewed by troops of
banditti and deserters, who flocked to the standard of plunder, and by a
crowd of fugitive slaves, often of German or Sarmatian extraction, who
eagerly seized the glorious opportunity of freedom and revenge. In these
expeditions, the Gothic nation claimed a superior share of honor and
danger; but the tribes that fought under the Gothic banners are
sometimes distinguished and sometimes confounded in the imperfect
histories of that age; and as the barbarian fleets seemed to issue from
the mouth of the Tanais, the vague but familiar appellation of Scythians
was frequently bestowed on the mixed multitude.  <span

(A. D. 357) an irruption into Rhaetia, and it was not long after that
they were reunited with the Alemanni. Still they have always been a
distinct people; at the present day, the people who inhabit the
north-west of the Black Forest call themselves Schwaben, Suabians,
Sueves, while those who inhabit near the Rhine, in Ortenau, the Brisgaw,
the Margraviate of Baden, do not consider themselves Suabians, and are
by origin Alemanni.

The Teucteri and the Usipetae, inhabitants of the interior and of the
north of Westphalia, formed, says Gatterer, the nucleus of the Alemannic
nation; they occupied the country where the name of the Alemanni first
appears, as conquered in 213, by Caracalla. They were well trained to
fight on horseback, (according to Tacitus, Germ. c. 32;) and Aurelius
Victor gives the same praise to the Alemanni: finally, they never made
part of the Frankish league. The Alemanni became subsequently a centre
round which gathered a multitude of German tribes, See Eumen. Panegyr.

The question whether the Suevi was a generic name comprehending the
clans which peopled central Germany, is rather hastily decided by M.
Guizot Mr. Greenwood, who has studied the modern German writers on their
own origin, supposes the Suevi, Alemanni, and Marcomanni, one people,
under different appellations. History of Germany, vol i. - M.
