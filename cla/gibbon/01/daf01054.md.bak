### Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion. Part VIII.

The rich provinces that extend from the Euphrates to the Ionian Sea,
were the principal theatre on which the apostle of the Gentiles
displayed his zeal and piety. The seeds of the gospel, which he had
scattered in a fertile soil, were diligently cultivated by his
disciples; and it should seem that, during the two first centuries, the
most considerable body of Christians was contained within those limits.
Among the societies which were instituted in Syria, none were more
ancient or more illustrious than those of Damascus, of Berea or Aleppo,
and of Antioch. The prophetic introduction of the Apocalypse has
described and immortalized the seven churches of Asia; Ephesus, Smyrna,
Pergamus, Thyatira,  <span id="fr_1640"></span>[154](#fn_1639.md) Sardes,
Laodicea and Philadelphia; and their colonies were soon diffused over
that populous country. In a very early period, the islands of Cyprus and
Crete, the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia, gave a favorable reception
to the new religion; and Christian republics were soon founded in the
cities of Corinth, of Sparta, and of Athens.  <span
id="fr_1641"></span>[155](#fn_1640.md) The antiquity of the Greek and
Asiatic churches allowed a sufficient space of time for their increase
and multiplication; and even the swarms of Gnostics and other heretics
serve to display the flourishing condition of the orthodox church, since
the appellation of hereties has always been applied to the less numerous
party. To these domestic testimonies we may add the confession, the
complaints, and the apprehensions of the Gentiles themselves. From the
writings of Lucian, a philosopher who had studied mankind, and who
describes their manners in the most lively colors, we may learn that,
under the reign of Commodus, his native country of Pontus was filled
with Epicureans and Christians.  <span
id="fr_1642"></span>[156](#fn_1641.md) Within fourscore years after the
death of Christ,  <span id="fr_1643"></span>[157](#fn_1642.md) the humane
Pliny laments the magnitude of the evil which he vainly attempted to
eradicate. In his very curious epistle to the emperor Trajan, he
affirms, that the temples were almost deserted, that the sacred victims
scarcely found any purchasers, and that the superstition had not only
infected the cities, but had even spread itself into the villages and
the open country of Pontus and Bithynia.  <span
id="fr_1644"></span>[158](#fn_1643.md)

Without descending into a minute scrutiny of the expressions or of the
motives of those writers who either celebrate or lament the progress of
Christianity in the East, it may in general be observed, that none of
them have left us any grounds from whence a just estimate might be
formed of the real numbers of the faithful in those provinces. One
circumstance, however, has been fortunately preserved, which seems to
cast a more distinct light on this obscure but interesting subject.
Under the reign of Theodosius, after Christianity had enjoyed, during
more than sixty years, the sunshine of Imperial favor, the ancient and
illustrious church of Antioch consisted of one hundred thousand persons,
three thousand of whom were supported out of the public oblations.
 <span id="fr_1645"></span>[159](#fn_1644.md) The splendor and dignity of
the queen of the East, the acknowledged populousness of Caesarea,
Seleucia, and Alexandria, and the destruction of two hundred and fifty
thousand souls in the earthquake which afflicted Antioch under the elder
Justin,  <span id="fr_1646"></span>[160](#fn_1645.md) are so many
convincing proofs that the whole number of its inhabitants was not less
than half a million, and that the Christians, however multiplied by zeal
and power, did not exceed a fifth part of that great city. How different
a proportion must we adopt when we compare the persecuted with the
triumphant church, the West with the East, remote villages with populous
towns, and countries recently converted to the faith with the place
where the believers first received the appellation of Christians! It
must not, however, be dissembled, that, in another passage, Chrysostom,
to whom we are indebted for this useful information, computes the
multitude of the faithful as even superior to that of the Jews and
Pagans.  <span id="fr_1647"></span>[161](#fn_1646.md) But the solution of
this apparent difficulty is easy and obvious. The eloquent preacher
draws a parallel between the civil and the ecclesiastical constitution
of Antioch; between the list of Christians who had acquired heaven by
baptism, and the list of citizens who had a right to share the public
liberality. Slaves, strangers, and infants were comprised in the former;
they were excluded from the latter.

The extensive commerce of Alexandria, and its proximity to Palestine,
gave an easy entrance to the new religion. It was at first embraced by
great numbers of the Theraputae, or Essenians, of the Lake Mareotis, a
Jewish sect which had abated much of its reverence for the Mosaic
ceremonies. The austere life of the Essenians, their fasts and
excommunications, the community of goods, the love of celibacy, their
zeal for martyrdom, and the warmth though not the purity of their faith,
already offered a very lively image of the primitive discipline.  <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[162](#fn_1647.md) It was in the school of Alexandria
that the Christian theology appears to have assumed a regular and
scientific form; and when Hadrian visited Egypt, he found a church
composed of Jews and of Greeks, sufficiently important to attract the
notice of that inquisitive prince.  <span
id="fr_1649"></span>[163](#fn_1648.md) But the progress of Christianity was
for a long time confined within the limits of a single city, which was
itself a foreign colony, and till the close of the second century the
predecessors of Demetrius were the only prelates of the Egyptian church.
Three bishops were consecrated by the hands of Demetrius, and the number
was increased to twenty by his successor Heraclas.  <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[164](#fn_1649.md) The body of the natives, a people
distinguished by a sullen inflexibility of temper,  <span
id="fr_1651"></span>[165](#fn_1650.md) entertained the new doctrine with
coldness and reluctance; and even in the time of Origen, it was rare to
meet with an Egyptian who had surmounted his early prejudices in favor
of the sacred animals of his country.  <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[166](#fn_1651.md) As soon, indeed, as Christianity
ascended the throne, the zeal of those barbarians obeyed the prevailing
impulsion; the cities of Egypt were filled with bishops, and the deserts
of Thebais swarmed with hermits.

A perpetual stream of strangers and provincials flowed into the
capacious bosom of Rome. Whatever was strange or odious, whoever was
guilty or suspected, might hope, in the obscurity of that immense
capital, to elude the vigilance of the law. In such a various conflux of
nations, every teacher, either of truth or falsehood, every founder,
whether of a virtuous or a criminal association, might easily multiply
his disciples or accomplices. The Christians of Rome, at the time of the
accidental persecution of Nero, are represented by Tacitus as already
amounting to a very great multitude,  <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[167](#fn_1652.md) and the language of that great
historian is almost similar to the style employed by Livy, when he
relates the introduction and the suppression of the rites of Bacchus.
After the Bacchanals had awakened the severity of the senate, it was
likewise apprehended that a very great multitude, as it were another
people, had been initiated into those abhorred mysteries. A more careful
inquiry soon demonstrated, that the offenders did not exceed seven
thousand; a number indeed sufficiently alarming, when considered as the
object of public justice.  <span id="fr_1654"></span>[168](#fn_1653.md) It
is with the same candid allowance that we should interpret the vague
expressions of Tacitus, and in a former instance of Pliny, when they
exaggerate the crowds of deluded fanatics who had forsaken the
established worship of the gods. The church of Rome was undoubtedly the
first and most populous of the empire; and we are possessed of an
authentic record which attests the state of religion in that city about
the middle of the third century, and after a peace of thirty-eight
years. The clergy, at that time, consisted of a bishop, forty-six
presbyters, seven deacons, as many sub-deacons, forty-two acolythes, and
fifty readers, exorcists, and porters. The number of widows, of the
infirm, and of the poor, who were maintained by the oblations of the
faithful, amounted to fifteen hundred.  <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[169](#fn_1654.md) From reason, as well as from the
analogy of Antioch, we may venture to estimate the Christians of Rome at
about fifty thousand. The populousness of that great capital cannot
perhaps be exactly ascertained; but the most modest calculation will not
surely reduce it lower than a million of inhabitants, of whom the
Christians might constitute at the most a twentieth part.  <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[170](#fn_1655.md)

The western provincials appeared to have derived the knowledge of
Christianity from the same source which had diffused among them the
language, the sentiments, and the manners of Rome. In this more
important circumstance, Africa, as well as Gaul, was gradually fashioned
to the imitation of the capital. Yet notwithstanding the many favorable
occasions which might invite the Roman missionaries to visit their Latin
provinces, it was late before they passed either the sea or the Alps;
 <span id="fr_1657"></span>[171](#fn_1656.md) nor can we discover in those
great countries any assured traces either of faith or of persecution
that ascend higher than the reign of the Antonines.  <span
id="fr_1658"></span>[172](#fn_1657.md) The slow progress of the gospel in
the cold climate of Gaul, was extremely different from the eagerness
with which it seems to have been received on the burning sands of
Africa. The African Christians soon formed one of the principal members
of the primitive church. The practice introduced into that province of
appointing bishops to the most inconsiderable towns, and very frequently
to the most obscure villages, contributed to multiply the splendor and
importance of their religious societies, which during the course of the
third century were animated by the zeal of Tertullian, directed by the
abilities of Cyprian, and adorned by the eloquence of Lactantius. But
if, on the contrary, we turn our eyes towards Gaul, we must content
ourselves with discovering, in the time of Marcus Antoninus, the feeble
and united congregations of Lyons and Vienna; and even as late as the
reign of Decius, we are assured, that in a few cities only, Arles,
Narbonne, Thoulouse, Limoges, Clermont, Tours, and Paris, some scattered
churches were supported by the devotion of a small number of Christians.
 <span id="fr_1659"></span>[173](#fn_1658.md) Silence is indeed very
consistent with devotion; but as it is seldom compatible with zeal, we
may perceive and lament the languid state of Christianity in those
provinces which had exchanged the Celtic for the Latin tongue, since
they did not, during the three first centuries, give birth to a single
ecclesiastical writer. From Gaul, which claimed a just preeminence of
learning and authority over all the countries on this side of the Alps,
the light of the gospel was more faintly reflected on the remote
provinces of Spain and Britain; and if we may credit the vehement
assertions of Tertullian, they had already received the first rays of
the faith, when he addressed his apology to the magistrates of the
emperor Severus.  <span id="fr_1660"></span>[174](#fn_1659.md) But the
obscure and imperfect origin of the western churches of Europe has been
so negligently recorded, that if we would relate the time and manner of
their foundation, we must supply the silence of antiquity by those
legends which avarice or superstition long afterwards dictated to the
monks in the lazy gloom of their convents.  <span
id="fr_1661"></span>[175](#fn_1660.md) Of these holy romances, that of the
apostle St. James can alone, by its singular extravagance, deserve to be
mentioned. From a peaceful fisherman of the Lake of Gennesareth, he was
transformed into a valorous knight, who charged at the head of the
Spanish chivalry in their battles against the Moors. The gravest
historians have celebrated his exploits; the miraculous shrine of
Compostella displayed his power; and the sword of a military order,
assisted by the terrors of the Inquisition, was sufficient to remove
every objection of profane criticism.  <span
id="fr_1662"></span>[176](#fn_1661.md)

The progress of Christianity was not confined to the Roman empire; and
according to the primitive fathers, who interpret facts by prophecy, the
new religion, within a century after the death of its divine Author, had
already visited every part of the globe. "There exists not," says Justin
Martyr, "a people, whether Greek or Barbarian, or any other race of men,
by whatsoever appellation or manners they may be distinguished, however
ignorant of arts or agriculture, whether they dwell under tents, or
wander about in covered wagons, among whom prayers are not offered up in
the name of a crucified Jesus to the Father and Creator of all things."
 <span id="fr_1663"></span>[177](#fn_1662.md) But this splendid
exaggeration, which even at present it would be extremely difficult to
reconcile with the real state of mankind, can be considered only as the
rash sally of a devout but careless writer, the measure of whose belief
was regulated by that of his wishes. But neither the belief nor the
wishes of the fathers can alter the truth of history. It will still
remain an undoubted fact, that the barbarians of Scythia and Germany,
who afterwards subverted the Roman monarchy, were involved in the
darkness of paganism; and that even the conversion of Iberia, of
Armenia, or of Aethiopia, was not attempted with any degree of success
till the sceptre was in the hands of an orthodox emperor.  <span
id="fr_1664"></span>[178](#fn_1663.md) Before that time, the various
accidents of war and commerce might indeed diffuse an imperfect
knowledge of the gospel among the tribes of Caledonia,  <span
id="fr_1665"></span>[179](#fn_1664.md) and among the borderers of the
Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates.  <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[180](#fn_1665.md) Beyond the last-mentioned river,
Edessa was distinguished by a firm and early adherence to the faith.
 <span id="fr_1667"></span>[181](#fn_1666.md) From Edessa the principles of
Christianity were easily introduced into the Greek and Syrian cities
which obeyed the successors of Artaxerxes; but they do not appear to
have made any deep impression on the minds of the Persians, whose
religious system, by the labors of a well disciplined order of priests,
had been constructed with much more art and solidity than the uncertain
mythology of Greece and Rome.  <span id="fr_1668"></span>[182](#fn_1667.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1639"></span>[154](daf01054.htm#fr_1640.md) The Alogians
(Epiphanius de Haeres. 51) disputed the genuineness of the Apocalypse,
because the church of Thyatira was not yet founded. Epiphanius, who
allows the fact, extricates himself from the difficulty by ingeniously
supposing that St. John wrote in the spirit of prophecy. See Abauzit,
Discours sur l'Apocalypse.

<span id="fn_1640"></span>[155](daf01054.htm#fr_1641.md) The epistles of
Ignatius and Dionysius (ap. Euseb. iv. 23) point out many churches in
Asia and Greece. That of Athens seems to have been one of the least
flourishing.

<span id="fn_1641"></span>[156](daf01054.htm#fr_1642.md) Lucian in
Alexandro, c. 25. Christianity however, must have been very unequally
diffused over Pontus; since, in the middle of the third century, there
was no more than seventeen believers in the extensive diocese of
Neo-Caesarea. See M. de Tillemont, Memoires Ecclesiast. tom. iv. p. 675,
from Basil and Gregory of Nyssa, who were themselves natives of
Cappadocia. Note: Gibbon forgot the conclusion of this story, that
Gregory left only seventeen heathens in his diocese. The antithesis is
suspicious, and both numbers may have been chosen to magnify the
spiritual fame of the wonder-worker. - M.

<span id="fn_1642"></span>[157](daf01054.htm#fr_1643.md) According to the
ancients, Jesus Christ suffered under the consulship of the two Gemini,
in the year 29 of our present aera. Pliny was sent into Bithynia
(according to Pagi) in the year 110.

of antioch.

i. p. 592. I am indebted for these passages, though not for my
inference, to the learned Dr. Lardner. Credibility of the Gospel of
History, vol. xii. p. 370.

Note: The statements of Chrysostom with regard to the population of
Antioch, whatever may be their accuracy, are perfectly consistent. In
one passage he reckons the population at 200,000. In a second the
Christians at 100,000. In a third he states that the Christians formed
more than half the population. Gibbon has neglected to notice the first
passage, and has drawn by estimate of the population of Antioch from
other sources. The 8000 maintained by alms were widows and virgins alone
- M.

<span id="fn_1647"></span>[162](daf01054.htm#fr_1648.md) Basnage, Histoire
des Juifs, l. 2, c. 20, 21, 22, 23, has examined with the most critical
accuracy the curious treatise of Philo, which describes the Therapeutae.
By proving that it was composed as early as the time of Augustus,
Basnage has demonstrated, in spite of Eusebius (l. ii. c. 17) and a
crowd of modern Catholics, that the Therapeutae were neither Christians
nor monks. It still remains probable that they changed their name,
preserved their manners, adopted some new articles of faith, and
gradually became the fathers of the Egyptian Ascetics.

<span id="fn_1648"></span>[163](daf01054.htm#fr_1649.md) See a letter of
Hadrian in the Augustan History, p. 245.

<span id="fn_1649"></span>[164](daf01054.htm#fr_1650.md) For the succession
of Alexandrian bishops, consult Renaudot's History, p. 24, &c. This
curious fact is preserved by the patriarch Eutychius, Annal. tom. i. p.
334, Vers. Pocock,) and its internal evidence would alone be a
sufficient answer to all the objections which Bishop Pearson has urged
in the Vindiciae Ignatianae.

senate on the discovery of the Bacchanalians, whose depravity is
described, and perhaps exaggerated, by Livy.

<span id="fn_1654"></span>[169](daf01054.htm#fr_1655.md) Eusebius, l. vi.
c. 43. The Latin translator (M. de Valois) has thought proper to reduce
the number of presbyters to forty-four.

<span id="fn_1655"></span>[170](daf01054.htm#fr_1656.md) This proportion of
the presbyters and of the poor, to the rest of the people, was
originally fixed by Burnet, (Travels into Italy, p. 168,) and is
approved by Moyle, (vol. ii. p. 151.) They were both unacquainted with
the passage of Chrysostom, which converts their conjecture almost into a
fact.

Memoires de Tillemont, tom vi. part i. p. 43, 411.

<span id="fn_1659"></span>[174](daf01054.htm#fr_1660.md) The date of
Tertullian's Apology is fixed, in a dissertation of Mosheim, to the year
198.

<span id="fn_1660"></span>[175](daf01054.htm#fr_1661.md) In the fifteenth
century, there were few who had either inclination or courage to
question, whether Joseph of Arimathea founded the monastery of
Glastonbury, and whether Dionysius the Areopagite preferred the

<span id="fn_1661"></span>[176](daf01054.htm#fr_1662.md) The stupendous
metamorphosis was performed in the ninth century. See Mariana, (Hist.

circumstances, that relate to the conversion of Iberia and Armenia, may
be found in Moses of Chorene, l. ii. c. 78 - 89. Note: Mons. St. Martin
has shown that Armenia was the first nation that embraced Christianity.
Memoires sur l'Armenie, vol. i. p. 306, and notes to Le Beae. Gibbon,
indeed had expressed his intention of withdrawing the words "of Armenia"
from the text of future editions. (Vindication, Works, iv. 577.) He was
bitterly taunted by Person for neglecting or declining to fulfil his
promise. Preface to Letters to Travis. - M.

<span id="fn_1664"></span>[179](daf01054.htm#fr_1665.md) According to
Tertullian, the Christian faith had penetrated into parts of Britain
inaccessible to the Roman arms. About a century afterwards, Ossian, the
son of Fingal, is said to have disputed, in his extreme old age, with
one of the foreign missionaries, and the dispute is still extant, in
verse, and in the Erse language. See Mr. Macpher son's Dissertation on
the Antiquity of Ossian's Poems, p. 10.

<span id="fn_1665"></span>[180](daf01054.htm#fr_1666.md) The Goths, who
ravaged Asia in the reign of Gallienus, carried away great numbers of
captives; some of whom were Christians, and became missionaries. See
Tillemont, Memoires Ecclesiast. tom. iv. p. 44.

<span id="fn_1666"></span>[181](daf01054.htm#fr_1667.md) The legends of
Abgarus, fabulous as it is, affords a decisive proof, that many years
before Eusebius wrote his history, the greatest part of the inhabitants
of Edessa had embraced Christianity. Their rivals, the citizens of
Carrhae, adhered, on the contrary, to the cause of Paganism, as late as
the sixth century.

<span id="fn_1667"></span>[182](daf01054.htm#fr_1668.md) According to
Bardesanes (ap. Euseb. Praepar. Evangel.) there were some Christians in
Persia before the end of the second century. In the time of Constantine
(see his epistle to Sapor, Vit. l. iv. c. 13) they composed a
flourishing church. Consult Beausobre, Hist. Cristique du Manicheisme,
tom. i. p. 180, and the Bibliotheca Orietalis of Assemani.
