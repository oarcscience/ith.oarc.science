### Chapter V: Sale Of The Empire To Didius Julianus. Part II.

Severus, who dreaded neither his arms nor his enchantments, guarded
himself from the only danger of secret conspiracy, by the faithful
attendance of six hundred chosen men, who never quitted his person or
their cuirasses, either by night or by day, during the whole march.
Advancing with a steady and rapid course, he passed, without difficulty,
the defiles of the Apennine, received into his party the troops and
ambassadors sent to retard his progress, and made a short halt at
Interamnia, about seventy miles from Rome. His victory was already
secure, but the despair of the Praetorians might have rendered it
bloody; and Severus had the laudable ambition of ascending the throne
without drawing the sword.  <span id="fr_398"></span>[35](#fn_398.md) His
emissaries, dispersed in the capital, assured the guards, that provided
they would abandon their worthless prince, and the perpetrators of the
murder of Pertinax, to the justice of the conqueror, he would no longer
consider that melancholy event as the act of the whole body. The
faithless Praetorians, whose resistance was supported only by sullen
obstinacy, gladly complied with the easy conditions, seized the greatest
part of the assassins, and signified to the senate, that they no longer
defended the cause of Julian. That assembly, convoked by the consul,
unanimously acknowledged Severus as lawful emperor, decreed divine
honors to Pertinax, and pronounced a sentence of deposition and death
against his unfortunate successor. Julian was conducted into a private
apartment of the baths of the palace, and beheaded as a common criminal,
after having purchased, with an immense treasure, an anxious and
precarious reign of only sixty-six days.  <span
id="fr_399"></span>[36](#fn_399.md) The almost incredible expedition of
Severus, who, in so short a space of time, conducted a numerous army
from the banks of the Danube to those of the Tyber, proves at once the
plenty of provisions produced by agriculture and commerce, the goodness
of the roads, the discipline of the legions, and the indolent, subdued
temper of the provinces.  <span id="fr_400"></span>[37](#fn_400.md)

The first cares of Severus were bestowed on two measures the one
dictated by policy, the other by decency; the revenge, and the honors,
due to the memory of Pertinax. Before the new emperor entered Rome, he
issued his commands to the Praetorian guards, directing them to wait his
arrival on a large plain near the city, without arms, but in the habits
of ceremony, in which they were accustomed to attend their sovereign. He
was obeyed by those haughty troops, whose contrition was the effect of
their just terrors. A chosen part of the Illyrian army encompassed them
with levelled spears. Incapable of flight or resistance, they expected
their fate in silent consternation. Severus mounted the tribunal,
sternly reproached them with perfidy and cowardice, dismissed them with
ignominy from the trust which they had betrayed, despoiled them of their
splendid ornaments, and banished them, on pain of death, to the distance
of a hundred miles from the capital. During the transaction, another
detachment had been sent to seize their arms, occupy their camp, and
prevent the hasty consequences of their despair.  <span
id="fr_401"></span>[38](#fn_401.md) The funeral and consecration of
Pertinax was next solemnized with every circumstance of sad
magnificence.  <span id="fr_402"></span>[39](#fn_402.md) The senate, with a
melancholy pleasure, performed the last rites to that excellent prince,
whom they had loved, and still regretted. The concern of his successor
was probably less sincere; he esteemed the virtues of Pertinax, but
those virtues would forever have confined his ambition to a private
station. Severus pronounced his funeral oration with studied eloquence,
inward satisfaction, and well-acted sorrow; and by this pious regard to
his memory, convinced the credulous multitude, that he alone was worthy
to supply his place. Sensible, however, that arms, not ceremonies, must
assert his claim to the empire, he left Rome at the end of thirty days,
and without suffering himself to be elated by this easy victory,
prepared to encounter his more formidable rivals.

The uncommon abilities and fortune of Severus have induced an elegant
historian to compare him with the first and greatest of the Caesars.
 <span id="fr_403"></span>[40](#fn_403.md) The parallel is, at least,
imperfect. Where shall we find, in the character of Severus, the
commanding superiority of soul, the generous clemency, and the various
genius, which could reconcile and unite the love of pleasure, the thirst
of knowledge, and the fire of ambition?  <span
id="fr_404"></span>[41](#fn_404.md) In one instance only, they may be
compared, with some degree of propriety, in the celerity of their
motions, and their civil victories. In less than four years,  <span
id="fr_405"></span>[42](#fn_405.md) Severus subdued the riches of the East,
and the valor of the West. He vanquished two competitors of reputation
and ability, and defeated numerous armies, provided with weapons and
discipline equal to his own. In that age, the art of fortification, and
the principles of tactics, were well understood by all the Roman
generals; and the constant superiority of Severus was that of an artist,
who uses the same instruments with more skill and industry than his
rivals. I shall not, however, enter into a minute narrative of these
military operations; but as the two civil wars against Niger and against
Albinus were almost the same in their conduct, event, and consequences,
I shall collect into one point of view the most striking circumstances,
tending to develop the character of the conqueror and the state of the
empire.

Falsehood and insincerity, unsuitable as they seem to the dignity of
public transactions, offend us with a less degrading idea of meanness,
than when they are found in the intercourse of private life. In the
latter, they discover a want of courage; in the other, only a defect of
power: and, as it is impossible for the most able statesmen to subdue
millions of followers and enemies by their own personal strength, the
world, under the name of policy, seems to have granted them a very
liberal indulgence of craft and dissimulation. Yet the arts of Severus
cannot be justified by the most ample privileges of state reason. He
promised only to betray, he flattered only to ruin; and however he might
occasionally bind himself by oaths and treaties, his conscience,
obsequious to his interest, always released him from the inconvenient
obligation.  <span id="fr_406"></span>[43](#fn_406.md)

If his two competitors, reconciled by their common danger, had advanced
upon him without delay, perhaps Severus would have sunk under their
united effort. Had they even attacked him, at the same time, with
separate views and separate armies, the contest might have been long and
doubtful. But they fell, singly and successively, an easy prey to the
arts as well as arms of their subtle enemy, lulled into security by the
moderation of his professions, and overwhelmed by the rapidity of his
action. He first marched against Niger, whose reputation and power he
the most dreaded: but he declined any hostile declarations, suppressed
the name of his antagonist, and only signified to the senate and people
his intention of regulating the eastern provinces. In private, he spoke
of Niger, his old friend and intended successor,  <span
id="fr_407"></span>[44](#fn_407.md) with the most affectionate regard, and
highly applauded his generous design of revenging the murder of
Pertinax. To punish the vile usurper of the throne, was the duty of
every Roman general. To persevere in arms, and to resist a lawful
emperor, acknowledged by the senate, would alone render him criminal.
 <span id="fr_408"></span>[45](#fn_408.md) The sons of Niger had fallen
into his hands among the children of the provincial governors, detained
at Rome as pledges for the loyalty of their parents.  <span
id="fr_409"></span>[46](#fn_409.md) As long as the power of Niger inspired
terror, or even respect, they were educated with the most tender care,
with the children of Severus himself; but they were soon involved in
their father's ruin, and removed first by exile, and afterwards by
death, from the eye of public compassion.  <span
id="fr_410"></span>[47](#fn_410.md)

Whilst Severus was engaged in his eastern war, he had reason to
apprehend that the governor of Britain might pass the sea and the Alps,
occupy the vacant seat of empire, and oppose his return with the
authority of the senate and the forces of the West. The ambiguous
conduct of Albinus, in not assuming the Imperial title, left room for
negotiation. Forgetting, at once, his professions of patriotism, and the
jealousy of sovereign power, he accepted the precarious rank of Caesar,
as a reward for his fatal neutrality. Till the first contest was
decided, Severus treated the man, whom he had doomed to destruction,
with every mark of esteem and regard. Even in the letter, in which he
announced his victory over Niger, he styles Albinus the brother of his
soul and empire, sends him the affectionate salutations of his wife
Julia, and his young family, and entreats him to preserve the armies and
the republic faithful to their common interest. The messengers charged
with this letter were instructed to accost the Caesar with respect, to
desire a private audience, and to plunge their daggers into his heart.
 <span id="fr_411"></span>[48](#fn_411.md) The conspiracy was discovered,
and the too credulous Albinus, at length, passed over to the continent,
and prepared for an unequal contest with his rival, who rushed upon him
at the head of a veteran and victorious army.

The military labors of Severus seem inadequate to the importance of his
conquests. Two engagements,  <span
id="fr_412"></span>[\*\_0036](#fn_412.md) the one near the Hellespont, the
other in the narrow defiles of Cilicia, decided the fate of his Syrian
competitor; and the troops of Europe asserted their usual ascendant over
the effeminate natives of Asia.  <span id="fr_413"></span>[49](#fn_413.md)
The battle of Lyons, where one hundred and fifty thousand Romans  <span
id="fr_414"></span>[50](#fn_414.md) were engaged, was equally fatal to
Albinus. The valor of the British army maintained, indeed, a sharp and
doubtful contest, with the hardy discipline of the Illyrian legions. The
fame and person of Severus appeared, during a few moments, irrecoverably
lost, till that warlike prince rallied his fainting troops, and led them
on to a decisive victory.  <span id="fr_415"></span>[51](#fn_415.md) The
war was finished by that memorable day.  <span
id="fr_416"></span>[\*\*\_0036](#fn_416.md)

The civil wars of modern Europe have been distinguished, not only by the
fierce animosity, but likewise by the obstinate perseverance, of the
contending factions. They have generally been justified by some
principle, or, at least, colored by some pretext, of religion, freedom,
or loyalty. The leaders were nobles of independent property and
hereditary influence. The troops fought like men interested in the
decision of the quarrel; and as military spirit and party zeal were
strongly diffused throughout the whole community, a vanquished chief was
immediately supplied with new adherents, eager to shed their blood in
the same cause. But the Romans, after the fall of the republic, combated
only for the choice of masters. Under the standard of a popular
candidate for empire, a few enlisted from affection, some from fear,
many from interest, none from principle. The legions, uninflamed by
party zeal, were allured into civil war by liberal donatives, and still
more liberal promises. A defeat, by disabling the chief from the
performance of his engagements, dissolved the mercenary allegiance of
his followers, and left them to consult their own safety by a timely
desertion of an unsuccessful cause. It was of little moment to the
provinces, under whose name they were oppressed or governed; they were
driven by the impulsion of the present power, and as soon as that power
yielded to a superior force, they hastened to implore the clemency of
the conqueror, who, as he had an immense debt to discharge, was obliged
to sacrifice the most guilty countries to the avarice of his soldiers.
In the vast extent of the Roman empire, there were few fortified cities
capable of protecting a routed army; nor was there any person, or
family, or order of men, whose natural interest, unsupported by the
powers of government, was capable of restoring the cause of a sinking
party.  <span id="fr_417"></span>[52](#fn_417.md)

Yet, in the contest between Niger and Severus, a single city deserves an
honorable exception. As Byzantium was one of the greatest passages from
Europe into Asia, it had been provided with a strong garrison, and a
fleet of five hundred vessels was anchored in the harbor.  <span
id="fr_418"></span>[53](#fn_418.md) The impetuosity of Severus disappointed
this prudent scheme of defence; he left to his generals the siege of
Byzantium, forced the less guarded passage of the Hellespont, and,
impatient of a meaner enemy, pressed forward to encounter his rival.
Byzantium, attacked by a numerous and increasing army, and afterwards by
the whole naval power of the empire, sustained a siege of three years,
and remained faithful to the name and memory of Niger. The citizens and
soldiers (we know not from what cause) were animated with equal fury;
several of the principal officers of Niger, who despaired of, or who
disdained, a pardon, had thrown themselves into this last refuge: the
fortifications were esteemed impregnable, and, in the defence of the
place, a celebrated engineer displayed all the mechanic powers known to
the ancients.  <span id="fr_419"></span>[54](#fn_419.md) Byzantium, at
length, surrendered to famine. The magistrates and soldiers were put to
the sword, the walls demolished, the privileges suppressed, and the
destined capital of the East subsisted only as an open village, subject
to the insulting jurisdiction of Perinthus. The historian Dion, who had
admired the flourishing, and lamented the desolate, state of Byzantium,
accused the revenge of Severus, for depriving the Roman people of the
strongest bulwark against the barbarians of Pontus and Asia  <span
id="fr_420"></span>[55](#fn_420.md) The truth of this observation was but
too well justified in the succeeding age, when the Gothic fleets covered
the Euxine, and passed through the undefined Bosphorus into the centre
of the Mediterranean.

Both Niger and Albinus were discovered and put to death in their flight
from the field of battle. Their fate excited neither surprise nor
compassion. They had staked their lives against the chance of empire,
and suffered what they would have inflicted; nor did Severus claim the
arrogant superiority of suffering his rivals to live in a private
station. But his unforgiving temper, stimulated by avarice, indulged a
spirit of revenge, where there was no room for apprehension. The most
considerable of the provincials, who, without any dislike to the
fortunate candidate, had obeyed the governor under whose authority they
were accidentally placed, were punished by death, exile, and especially
by the confiscation of their estates. Many cities of the East were
stripped of their ancient honors, and obliged to pay, into the treasury
of Severus, four times the amount of the sums contributed by them for
the service of Niger. <span id="fr_422"></span>[56](#fn_422.md)

Till the final decision of the war, the cruelty of Severus was, in some
measure, restrained by the uncertainty of the event, and his pretended
reverence for the senate. The head of Albinus, accompanied with a
menacing letter, announced to the Romans that he was resolved to spare
none of the adherents of his unfortunate competitors. He was irritated
by the just auspicion that he had never possessed the affections of the
senate, and he concealed his old malevolence under the recent discovery
of some treasonable correspondences. Thirty-five senators, however,
accused of having favored the party of Albinus, he freely pardoned, and,
by his subsequent behavior, endeavored to convince them, that he had
forgotten, as well as forgiven, their supposed offences. But, at the
same time, he condemned forty-one  <span
id="fr_423"></span>[57](#fn_423.md) other senators, whose names history has
recorded; their wives, children, and clients attended them in death,
 <span id="fr_424"></span>[\*\_0038](#fn_424.md) and the noblest
provincials of Spain and Gaul were involved in the same ruin.  <span
id="fr_425"></span>[!\_0038](#fn_425.md) Such rigid justice - for so he
termed it - was, in the opinion of Severus, the only conduct capable of
insuring peace to the people or stability to the prince; and he
condescended slightly to lament, that to be mild, it was necessary that
he should first be cruel.  <span id="fr_426"></span>[58](#fn_426.md)

The true interest of an absolute monarch generally coincides with that
of his people. Their numbers, their wealth, their order, and their
security, are the best and only foundations of his real greatness; and
were he totally devoid of virtue, prudence might supply its place, and
would dictate the same rule of conduct. Severus considered the Roman
empire as his property, and had no sooner secured the possession, than
he bestowed his care on the cultivation and improvement of so valuable
an acquisition. Salutary laws, executed with inflexible firmness, soon
corrected most of the abuses with which, since the death of Marcus,
every part of the government had been infected. In the administration of
justice, the judgments of the emperor were characterized by attention,
discernment, and impartiality; and whenever he deviated from the strict
line of equity, it was generally in favor of the poor and oppressed; not
so much indeed from any sense of humanity, as from the natural
propensity of a despot to humble the pride of greatness, and to sink all
his subjects to the same common level of absolute dependence. His
expensive taste for building, magnificent shows, and above all a
constant and liberal distribution of corn and provisions, were the
surest means of captivating the affection of the Roman people.  <span
id="fr_427"></span>[59](#fn_427.md) The misfortunes of civil discord were
obliterated. The clam of peace and prosperity was once more experienced
in the provinces; and many cities, restored by the munificence of
Severus, assumed the title of his colonies, and attested by public
monuments their gratitude and felicity.  <span
id="fr_428"></span>[60](#fn_428.md) The fame of the Roman arms was revived
by that warlike and successful emperor,  <span
id="fr_429"></span>[61](#fn_429.md) and he boasted, with a just pride,
that, having received the empire oppressed with foreign and domestic
wars, he left it established in profound, universal, and honorable
peace.  <span id="fr_430"></span>[62](#fn_430.md)

Although the wounds of civil war appeared completely healed, its mortal
poison still lurked in the vitals of the constitution. Severus possessed
a considerable share of vigor and ability; but the daring soul of the
first Caesar, or the deep policy of Augustus, were scarcely equal to the
task of curbing the insolence of the victorious legions. By gratitude,
by misguided policy, by seeming necessity, Severus was reduced to relax
the nerves of discipline.  <span id="fr_431"></span>[63](#fn_431.md) The
vanity of his soldiers was flattered with the honor of wearing gold
rings their ease was indulged in the permission of living with their
wives in the idleness of quarters. He increased their pay beyond the
example of former times, and taught them to expect, and soon to claim,
extraordinary donatives on every public occasion of danger or festivity.
Elated by success, enervated by luxury, and raised above the level of
subjects by their dangerous privileges,  <span
id="fr_432"></span>[64](#fn_432.md) they soon became incapable of military
fatigue, oppressive to the country, and impatient of a just
subordination. Their officers asserted the superiority of rank by a more
profuse and elegant luxury. There is still extant a letter of Severus,
lamenting the licentious stage of the army,  <span
id="fr_433"></span>[\*\_0039](#fn_433.md) and exhorting one of his generals
to begin the necessary reformation from the tribunes themselves; since,
as he justly observes, the officer who has forfeited the esteem, will
never command the obedience, of his soldiers.  <span
id="fr_434"></span>[65](#fn_434.md) Had the emperor pursued the train of
reflection, he would have discovered, that the primary cause of this
general corruption might be ascribed, not indeed to the example, but to
the pernicious indulgence, however, of the commander-in-chief.

The Praetorians, who murdered their emperor and sold the empire, had
received the just punishment of their treason; but the necessary, though
dangerous, institution of guards was soon restored on a new model by
Severus, and increased to four times the ancient number.  <span
id="fr_435"></span>[66](#fn_435.md) Formerly these troops had been
recruited in Italy; and as the adjacent provinces gradually imbibed the
softer manners of Rome, the levies were extended to Macedonia, Noricum,
and Spain. In the room of these elegant troops, better adapted to the
pomp of courts than to the uses of war, it was established by Severus,
that from all the legions of the frontiers, the soldiers most
distinguished for strength, valor, and fidelity, should be occasionally
draughted; and promoted, as an honor and reward, into the more eligible
service of the guards.  <span id="fr_436"></span>[67](#fn_436.md) By this
new institution, the Italian youth were diverted from the exercise of
arms, and the capital was terrified by the strange aspect and manners of
a multitude of barbarians. But Severus flattered himself, that the
legions would consider these chosen Praetorians as the representatives
of the whole military order; and that the present aid of fifty thousand
men, superior in arms and appointments to any force that could be
brought into the field against them, would forever crush the hopes of
rebellion, and secure the empire to himself and his posterity.

The command of these favored and formidable troops soon became the first
office of the empire. As the government degenerated into military
despotism, the Praetorian Praefect, who in his origin had been a simple
captain of the guards,  <span id="fr_437"></span>[\*\_0040](#fn_437.md) was
placed not only at the head of the army, but of the finances, and even
of the law. In every department of administration, he represented the
person, and exercised the authority, of the emperor. The first praefect
who enjoyed and abused this immense power was Plautianus, the favorite
minister of Severus. His reign lasted above then years, till the
marriage of his daughter with the eldest son of the emperor, which
seemed to assure his fortune, proved the occasion of his ruin.  <span
id="fr_438"></span>[68](#fn_438.md) The animosities of the palace, by
irritating the ambition and alarming the fears of Plautianus,  <span
id="fr_439"></span>[\*\*\_0040](#fn_439.md) threatened to produce a
revolution, and obliged the emperor, who still loved him, to consent
with reluctance to his death.  <span id="fr_440"></span>[69](#fn_440.md)
After the fall of Plautianus, an eminent lawyer, the celebrated
Papinian, was appointed to execute the motley office of Praetorian
Praefect.

Till the reign of Severus, the virtue and even the good sense of the
emperors had been distinguished by their zeal or affected reverence for
the senate, and by a tender regard to the nice frame of civil policy
instituted by Augustus. But the youth of Severus had been trained in the
implicit obedience of camps, and his riper years spent in the despotism
of military command. His haughty and inflexible spirit cou' not
discover, or would not acknowledge, the advantage of preserving an
intermediate power, however imaginary, between the emperor and the army.
He disdained to profess himself the servant of an assembly that detested
his person and trembled at his frown; he issued his commands, where his
requests would have proved as effectual; assumed the conduct and style
of a sovereign and a conqueror, and exercised, without disguise, the
whole legislative, as well as the executive power.

The victory over the senate was easy and inglorious. Every eye and every
passion were directed to the supreme magistrate, who possessed the arms
and treasure of the state; whilst the senate, neither elected by the
people, nor guarded by military force, nor animated by public spirit,
rested its declining authority on the frail and crumbling basis of
ancient opinion. The fine theory of a republic insensibly vanished, and
made way for the more natural and substantial feelings of monarchy. As
the freedom and honors of Rome were successively communicated to the
provinces, in which the old government had been either unknown, or was
remembered with abhorrence, the tradition of republican maxims was
gradually obliterated. The Greek historians of the age of the Antonines
 <span id="fr_441"></span>[70](#fn_441.md) observe, with a malicious
pleasure, that although the sovereign of Rome, in compliance with an
obsolete prejudice, abstained from the name of king, he possessed the
full measure of regal power. In the reign of Severus, the senate was
filled with polished and eloquent slaves from the eastern provinces, who
justified personal flattery by speculative principles of servitude.
These new advocates of prerogative were heard with pleasure by the
court, and with patience by the people, when they inculcated the duty of
passive obedience, and descanted on the inevitable mischiefs of freedom.
The lawyers and historians concurred in teaching, that the Imperial
authority was held, not by the delegated commission, but by the
irrevocable resignation of the senate; that the emperor was freed from
the restraint of civil laws, could command by his arbitrary will the
lives and fortunes of his subjects, and might dispose of the empire as
of his private patrimony.  <span id="fr_442"></span>[71](#fn_442.md) The
most eminent of the civil lawyers, and particularly Papinian, Paulus,
and Ulpian, flourished under the house of Severus; and the Roman
jurisprudence, having closely united itself with the system of monarchy,
was supposed to have attained its full majority and perfection.

The contemporaries of Severus in the enjoyment of the peace and glory of
his reign, forgave the cruelties by which it had been introduced.
Posterity, who experienced the fatal effects of his maxims and example,
justly considered him as the principal author of the decline of the
Roman empire.

Hist. August. p. 65, and Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iii. p.
393, note 7.) We cannot allow less than ten days after his election, to
put a numerous army in motion. Forty days remain for this rapid march;
and as we may compute about eight hundred miles from Rome to the
neighborhood of Vienna, the army of Severus marched twenty miles every
day, without halt or intermission.

most assuredly, the intention of Lucan to exalt the character of Caesar,
yet the idea he gives of that hero, in the tenth book of the Pharsalia,
where he describes him, at the same time, making love to Cleopatra,
sustaining a siege against the power of Egypt, and conversing with the
sages of the country, is, in reality, the noblest panegyric.

Note: Lord Byron wrote, no doubt, from a reminiscence of that passage -
"It is possible to be a very great man, and to be still very inferior to
Julius Caesar, the most complete character, so Lord Bacon thought, of
all antiquity. Nature seems incapable of such extraordinary combinations
as composed his versatile capacity, which was the wonder even of the
Romans themselves. The first general; the only triumphant politician;
inferior to none in point of eloquence; comparable to any in the
attainments of wisdom, in an age made up of the greatest commanders,
statesmen, orators, and philosophers, that ever appeared in the world;
an author who composed a perfect specimen of military annals in his
travelling carriage; at one time in a controversy with Cato, at another
writing a treatise on punuing, and collecting a set of good sayings;
fighting and making love at the same moment, and willing to abandon both
his empire and his mistress for a sight of the fountains of the Nile.
Such did Julius Caesar appear to his contemporaries, and to those of the
subsequent ages who were the most inclined to deplore and execrate his
fatal genius." Note 47 to Canto iv. of Childe Harold. - M.

very dangerously ill, it was industriously given out, that he intended
to appoint Niger and Albinus his successors. As he could not be sincere
with respect to both, he might not be so with regard to either. Yet
Severus carried his hypocrisy so far, as to profess that intention in
the memoirs of his own life.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[46](daf01016.htm#fr_409.md) This practice,
invented by Commodus, proved very useful to Severus. He found at Rome
the children of many of the principal adherents of his rivals; and he
employed them more than once to intimidate, or seduce, the parents.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[\*\_0036](daf01016.htm#fr_412.md) There were
three actions; one near Cyzicus, on the Hellespont, one near Nice, in
Bithynia, the third near the Issus, in Cilicia, where Alexander
conquered Darius. (Dion, lxiv. c. 6. Herodian, iii. 2, 4.) - W Herodian
represents the second battle as of less importance than Dion - M.

book of Herodian, and the seventy-fourth book of Dion Cassius.

fought in the plain of Trevoux, three or four leagues from Lyons. See
Tillemont, tom. iii. p. 406, note 18.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[\*\*\_0036](daf01016.htm#fr_416.md) According to
Herodian, it was his lieutenant Laetus who led back the troops to the
battle, and gained the day, which Severus had almost lost. Dion also
attributes to Laetus a great share in the victory. Severus afterwards
put him to death, either from fear or jealousy. - W. and G. Wenck and M.
Guizot have not given the real statement of Herodian or of Dion.
According to the former, Laetus appeared with his own army entire, which
he was suspected of having designedly kept disengaged when the battle
was still doudtful, or rather after the rout of severus. Dion says that
he did not move till Severus had won the victory. - M.

be supposed, were small open vessels; some, however, were galleys of
two, and a few of three ranks of oars.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[54](daf01016.htm#fr_419.md) The engineer's name
was Priscus. His skill saved his life, and he was taken into the service
of the conqueror. For the particular facts of the siege, consult Dion
Cassius (l. lxxv. p. 1251) and Herodian, (l. iii. p. 95;) for the theory
of it, the fanciful chevalier de Folard may be looked into. See Polybe,
tom. i. p. 76.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[55](daf01016.htm#fr_420.md) Notwithstanding the
authority of Spartianus, and some modern Greeks, we may be assured, from
Dion and Herodian, that Byzantium, many years after the death of
Severus, lay in ruins <span id="fr_421"></span>[\*\_0037](#fn_421.md)

<span id="fn_421"></span>[\*\_0037](daf01016.htm#fr_421.md) There is no
contradiction between the relation of Dion and that of Spartianus and
the modern Greeks. Dion does not say that Severus destroyed Byzantium,
but that he deprived it of its franchises and privileges, stripped the
inhabitants of their property, razed the fortifications, and subjected
the city to the jurisdiction of Perinthus. Therefore, when Spartian,
Suidas, Cedrenus, say that Severus and his son Antoninus restored to
Byzantium its rights and franchises, ordered temples to be built, &c.,
this is easily reconciled with the relation of Dion. Perhaps the latter
mentioned it in some of the fragments of his history which have been
lost. As to Herodian, his expressions are evidently exaggerated, and he
has been guilty of so many inaccuracies in the history of Severus, that
we have a right to suppose one in this passage. - G. from W Wenck and M.
Guizot have omitted to cite Zosimus, who mentions a particular portico
built by Severus, and called, apparently, by his name. Zosim. Hist. ii.
c. xxx. p. 151, 153, edit Heyne. - M.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[57](daf01016.htm#fr_423.md) Dion, (l. lxxv. p.
1264;) only twenty-nine senators are mentioned by him, but forty-one are
named in the Augustan History, p. 69, among whom were six of the name of
Pescennius. Herodian (l. iii. p. 115) speaks in general of the cruelties
of Severus.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[\*\_0038](daf01016.htm#fr_424.md) Wenck denies
that there is any authority for this massacre of the wives of the
senators. He adds, that only the children and relatives of Niger and
Albinus were put to death. This is true of the family of Albinus, whose
bodies were thrown into the Rhone; those of Niger, according to
Lampridius, were sent into exile, but afterwards put to death. Among the
partisans of Albinus who were put to death were many women of rank,
multae foeminae illustres. Lamprid. in Sever. - M.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[!\_0038](daf01016.htm#fr_425.md) A new fragment
of Dion describes the state of Rome during this contest. All pretended
to be on the side of Severus; but their secret sentiments were often
betrayed by a change of countenance on the arrival of some sudden
report. Some were detected by overacting their loyalty, Mai. Fragm.

hearts than their votes. - Ibid. - M.

extraordinary magnificence, and he left in the public granaries a
provision of corn for seven years, at the rate of 75,000 modii, or about
2500 quarters per day. I am persuaded that the granaries of Severus were
supplied for a long term, but I am not less persuaded, that policy on
one hand, and admiration on the other, magnified the hoard far beyond
its true contents.

whatsoever.

and privileges of the soldier, the 16th satire, falsely ascribed to
Juvenal, may be consulted; the style and circumstances of it would
induce me to believe, that it was composed under the reign of Severus,
or that of his son.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[\*\_0040](daf01016.htm#fr_437.md) The Praetorian
Praefect had never been a simple captain of the guards; from the first
creation of this office, under Augustus, it possessed great power. That
emperor, therefore, decreed that there should be always two Praetorian
Praefects, who could only be taken from the equestrian order Tiberius
first departed from the former clause of this edict; Alexander Severus
violated the second by naming senators praefects. It appears that it was
under Commodus that the Praetorian Praefects obtained the province of
civil jurisdiction. it extended only to Italy, with the exception of
Rome and its district, which was governed by the Praefectus urbi. As to
the control of the finances, and the levying of taxes, it was not
intrusted to them till after the great change that Constantine I. made
in the organization of the empire at least, I know no passage which
assigns it to them before that time; and Drakenborch, who has treated
this question in his Dissertation de official praefectorum praetorio,
vi., does not quote one. - W.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[68](daf01016.htm#fr_438.md) One of his most
daring and wanton acts of power, was the castration of a hundred free
Romans, some of them married men, and even fathers of families; merely
that his daughter, on her marriage with the young emperor, might be
attended by a train of eunuchs worthy of an eastern queen. Dion, l.
lxxvi. p. 1271.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[\*\*\_0040](daf01016.htm#fr_439.md) Plautianus
was compatriot, relative, and the old friend, of Severus; he had so
completely shut up all access to the emperor, that the latter was
ignorant how far he abused his powers: at length, being informed of it,
he began to limit his authority. The marriage of Plautilla with
Caracalla was unfortunate; and the prince who had been forced to consent
to it, menaced the father and the daughter with death when he should
come to the throne. It was feared, after that, that Plautianus would
avail himself of the power which he still possessed, against the
Imperial family; and Severus caused him to be assassinated in his
presence, upon the pretext of a conspiracy, which Dion considers
fictitious. - W. This note is not, perhaps, very necessary and does not
contain the whole facts. Dion considers the conspiracy the invention of
Caracalla, by whose command, almost by whose hand, Plautianus was slain
in the presence of Severus. - M.

1274. Herodian, l. iii. p. 122, 129. The grammarian of Alexander seems,
as is not unusual, much better acquainted with this mysterious
transaction, and more assured of the guilt of Plautianus than the Roman
senator ventures to be.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[71](daf01016.htm#fr_442.md) Dion Cassius seems to
have written with no other view than to form these opinions into an
historical system. The Pandea's will how how assiduously the lawyers, on
their side, laboree in the cause of prerogative.
