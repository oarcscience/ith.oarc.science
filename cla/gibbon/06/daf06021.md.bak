### Chapter LXV: Elevation Of Timour Or Tamerlane, And His Death. Part II.

The military republic of the Mamalukes still reigned in Egypt and Syria:
but the dynasty of the Turks was overthrown by that of the Circassians;
 <span id="fr_591"></span>[33](#fn_591.md) and their favorite Barkok, from
a slave and a prisoner, was raised and restored to the throne. In the
midst of rebellion and discord, he braved the menaces, corresponded with
the enemies, and detained the ambassadors, of the Mogul, who patiently
expected his decease, to revenge the crimes of the father on the feeble
reign of his son Farage. The Syrian emirs  <span
id="fr_592"></span>[34](#fn_592.md) were assembled at Aleppo to repel the
invasion: they confided in the fame and discipline of the Mamalukes, in
the temper of their swords and lances of the purest steel of Damascus,
in the strength of their walled cities, and in the populousness of sixty
thousand villages; and instead of sustaining a siege, they threw open
their gates, and arrayed their forces in the plain. But these forces
were not cemented by virtue and union; and some powerful emirs had been
seduced to desert or betray their more loyal companions. Timour's front
was covered with a line of Indian elephants, whose turrets were filled
with archers and Greek fire: the rapid evolutions of his cavalry
completed the dismay and disorder; the Syrian crowds fell back on each
other: many thousands were stifled or slaughtered in the entrance of the
great street; the Moguls entered with the fugitives; and after a short
defence, the citadel, the impregnable citadel of Aleppo, was surrendered
by cowardice or treachery. Among the suppliants and captives, Timour
distinguished the doctors of the law, whom he invited to the dangerous
honor of a personal conference.  <span id="fr_593"></span>[35](#fn_593.md)
The Mogul prince was a zealous Mussulman; but his Persian schools had
taught him to revere the memory of Ali and Hosein; and he had imbibed a
deep prejudice against the Syrians, as the enemies of the son of the
daughter of the apostle of God. To these doctors he proposed a captious
question, which the casuists of Bochara, Samarcand, and Herat, were
incapable of resolving. "Who are the true martyrs, of those who are
slain on my side, or on that of my enemies?" But he was silenced, or
satisfied, by the dexterity of one of the cadhis of Aleppo, who replied
in the words of Mahomet himself, that the motive, not the ensign,
constitutes the martyr; and that the Moslems of either party, who fight
only for the glory of God, may deserve that sacred appellation. The true
succession of the caliphs was a controversy of a still more delicate
nature; and the frankness of a doctor, too honest for his situation,
provoked the emperor to exclaim, "Ye are as false as those of Damascus:
Moawiyah was a usurper, Yezid a tyrant, and Ali alone is the lawful
successor of the prophet." A prudent explanation restored his
tranquillity; and he passed to a more familiar topic of conversation.
"What is your age?" said he to the cadhi. "Fifty years." - "It would be
the age of my eldest son: you see me here (continued Timour) a poor
lame, decrepit mortal. Yet by my arm has the Almighty been pleased to
subdue the kingdoms of Iran, Touran, and the Indies. I am not a man of
blood; and God is my witness, that in all my wars I have never been the
aggressor, and that my enemies have always been the authors of their own
calamity." During this peaceful conversation the streets of Aleppo
streamed with blood, and reechoed with the cries of mothers and
children, with the shrieks of violated virgins. The rich plunder that
was abandoned to his soldiers might stimulate their avarice; but their
cruelty was enforced by the peremptory command of producing an adequate
number of heads, which, according to his custom, were curiously piled in
columns and pyramids: the Moguls celebrated the feast of victory, while
the surviving Moslems passed the night in tears and in chains. I shall
not dwell on the march of the destroyer from Aleppo to Damascus, where
he was rudely encountered, and almost overthrown, by the armies of
Egypt. A retrograde motion was imputed to his distress and despair: one
of his nephews deserted to the enemy; and Syria rejoiced in the tale of
his defeat, when the sultan was driven by the revolt of the Mamalukes to
escape with precipitation and shame to his palace of Cairo. Abandoned by
their prince, the inhabitants of Damascus still defended their walls;
and Timour consented to raise the siege, if they would adorn his retreat
with a gift or ransom; each article of nine pieces. But no sooner had he
introduced himself into the city, under color of a truce, than he
perfidiously violated the treaty; imposed a contribution of ten millions
of gold; and animated his troops to chastise the posterity of those
Syrians who had executed, or approved, the murder of the grandson of
Mahomet. A family which had given honorable burial to the head of
Hosein, and a colony of artificers, whom he sent to labor at Samarcand,
were alone reserved in the general massacre, and after a period of seven
centuries, Damascus was reduced to ashes, because a Tartar was moved by
religious zeal to avenge the blood of an Arab. The losses and fatigues
of the campaign obliged Timour to renounce the conquest of Palestine and
Egypt; but in his return to the Euphrates he delivered Aleppo to the
flames; and justified his pious motive by the pardon and reward of two
thousand sectaries of Ali, who were desirous to visit the tomb of his
son. I have expatiated on the personal anecdotes which mark the
character of the Mogul hero; but I shall briefly mention,  <span
id="fr_594"></span>[36](#fn_594.md) that he erected on the ruins of Bagdad
a pyramid of ninety thousand heads; again visited Georgia; encamped on
the banks of Araxes; and proclaimed his resolution of marching against
the Ottoman emperor. Conscious of the importance of the war, he
collected his forces from every province: eight hundred thousand men
were enrolled on his military list;  <span
id="fr_595"></span>[37](#fn_595.md) but the splendid commands of five, and
ten, thousand horse, may be rather expressive of the rank and pension of
the chiefs, than of the genuine number of effective soldiers.  <span
id="fr_596"></span>[38](#fn_596.md) In the pillage of Syria, the Moguls had
acquired immense riches: but the delivery of their pay and arrears for
seven years more firmly attached them to the Imperial standard.

During this diversion of the Mogul arms, Bajazet had two years to
collect his forces for a more serious encounter. They consisted of four
hundred thousand horse and foot,  <span id="fr_597"></span>[39](#fn_597.md)
whose merit and fidelity were of an unequal complexion. We may
discriminate the Janizaries, who have been gradually raised to an
establishment of forty thousand men; a national cavalry, the Spahis of
modern times; twenty thousand cuirassiers of Europe, clad in black and
impenetrable armor; the troops of Anatolia, whose princes had taken
refuge in the camp of Timour, and a colony of Tartars, whom he had
driven from Kipzak, and to whom Bajazet had assigned a settlement in the
plains of Adrianople. The fearless confidence of the sultan urged him to
meet his antagonist; and, as if he had chosen that spot for revenge, he
displayed his banner near the ruins of the unfortunate Suvas. In the
mean while, Timour moved from the Araxes through the countries of
Armenia and Anatolia: his boldness was secured by the wisest
precautions; his speed was guided by order and discipline; and the
woods, the mountains, and the rivers, were diligently explored by the
flying squadrons, who marked his road and preceded his standard. Firm in
his plan of fighting in the heart of the Ottoman kingdom, he avoided
their camp; dexterously inclined to the left; occupied Caesarea;
traversed the salt desert and the River Halys; and invested Angora:
while the sultan, immovable and ignorant in his post, compared the
Tartar swiftness to the crawling of a snail;  <span
id="fr_598"></span>[40](#fn_598.md) he returned on the wings of indignation
to the relief of Angora: and as both generals were alike impatient for
action, the plains round that city were the scene of a memorable battle,
which has immortalized the glory of Timour and the shame of Bajazet. For
this signal victory the Mogul emperor was indebted to himself, to the
genius of the moment, and the discipline of thirty years. He had
improved the tactics, without violating the manners, of his nation,
 <span id="fr_599"></span>[41](#fn_599.md) whose force still consisted in
the missile weapons, and rapid evolutions, of a numerous cavalry. From a
single troop to a great army, the mode of attack was the same: a
foremost line first advanced to the charge, and was supported in a just
order by the squadrons of the great vanguard. The general's eye watched
over the field, and at his command the front and rear of the right and
left wings successively moved forwards in their several divisions, and
in a direct or oblique line: the enemy was pressed by eighteen or twenty
attacks; and each attack afforded a chance of victory. If they all
proved fruitless or unsuccessful, the occasion was worthy of the emperor
himself, who gave the signal of advancing to the standard and main body,
which he led in person.  <span id="fr_600"></span>[42](#fn_600.md) But in
the battle of Angora, the main body itself was supported, on the flanks
and in the rear, by the bravest squadrons of the reserve, commanded by
the sons and grandsons of Timour. The conqueror of Hindostan
ostentatiously showed a line of elephants, the trophies, rather than the
instruments, of victory; the use of the Greek fire was familiar to the
Moguls and Ottomans; but had they borrowed from Europe the recent
invention of gunpowder and cannon, the artificial thunder, in the hands
of either nation, must have turned the fortune of the day.  <span
id="fr_601"></span>[43](#fn_601.md) In that day Bajazet displayed the
qualities of a soldier and a chief: but his genius sunk under a stronger
ascendant; and, from various motives, the greatest part of his troops
failed him in the decisive moment. His rigor and avarice  <span
id="fr_602"></span>[\*\_0045](#fn_602.md) had provoked a mutiny among the
Turks; and even his son Soliman too hastily withdrew from the field. The
forces of Anatolia, loyal in their revolt, were drawn away to the
banners of their lawful princes. His Tartar allies had been tempted by
the letters and emissaries of Timour;  <span
id="fr_603"></span>[44](#fn_603.md) who reproached their ignoble servitude
under the slaves of their fathers; and offered to their hopes the
dominion of their new, or the liberty of their ancient, country. In the
right wing of Bajazet the cuirassiers of Europe charged, with faithful
hearts and irresistible arms: but these men of iron were soon broken by
an artful flight and headlong pursuit; and the Janizaries, alone,
without cavalry or missile weapons, were encompassed by the circle of
the Mogul hunters. Their valor was at length oppressed by heat, thirst,
and the weight of numbers; and the unfortunate sultan, afflicted with
the gout in his hands and feet, was transported from the field on the
fleetest of his horses. He was pursued and taken by the titular khan of
Zagatai; and, after his capture, and the defeat of the Ottoman powers,
the kingdom of Anatolia submitted to the conqueror, who planted his
standard at Kiotahia, and dispersed on all sides the ministers of rapine
and destruction. Mirza Mehemmed Sultan, the eldest and best beloved of
his grandsons, was despatched to Boursa, with thirty thousand horse; and
such was his youthful ardor, that he arrived with only four thousand at
the gates of the capital, after performing in five days a march of two
hundred and thirty miles. Yet fear is still more rapid in its course;
and Soliman, the son of Bajazet, had already passed over to Europe with
the royal treasure. The spoil, however, of the palace and city was
immense: the inhabitants had escaped; but the buildings, for the most
part of wood, were reduced to ashes From Boursa, the grandson of Timour
advanced to Nice, ever yet a fair and flourishing city; and the Mogul
squadrons were only stopped by the waves of the Propontis. The same
success attended the other mirzas and emirs in their excursions; and
Smyrna, defended by the zeal and courage of the Rhodian knights, alone
deserved the presence of the emperor himself. After an obstinate
defence, the place was taken by storm: all that breathed was put to the
sword; and the heads of the Christian heroes were launched from the
engines, on board of two carracks, or great ships of Europe, that rode
at anchor in the harbor. The Moslems of Asia rejoiced in their
deliverance from a dangerous and domestic foe; and a parallel was drawn
between the two rivals, by observing that Timour, in fourteen days, had
reduced a fortress which had sustained seven years the siege, or at
least the blockade, of Bajazet.  <span id="fr_604"></span>[45](#fn_604.md)

The iron cage in which Bajazet was imprisoned by Tamerlane, so long and
so often repeated as a moral lesson, is now rejected as a fable by the
modern writers, who smile at the vulgar credulity.  <span
id="fr_605"></span>[46](#fn_605.md) They appeal with confidence to the
Persian history of Sherefeddin Ali, which has been given to our
curiosity in a French version, and from which I shall collect and
abridge a more specious narrative of this memorable transaction. No
sooner was Timour informed that the captive Ottoman was at the door of
his tent, than he graciously stepped forwards to receive him, seated him
by his side, and mingled with just reproaches a soothing pity for his
rank and misfortune. "Alas!" said the emperor, "the decree of fate is
now accomplished by your own fault; it is the web which you have woven,
the thorns of the tree which yourself have planted. I wished to spare,
and even to assist, the champion of the Moslems; you braved our threats;
you despised our friendship; you forced us to enter your kingdom with
our invincible armies. Behold the event. Had you vanquished, I am not
ignorant of the fate which you reserved for myself and my troops. But I
disdain to retaliate: your life and honor are secure; and I shall
express my gratitude to God by my clemency to man." The royal captive
showed some signs of repentance, accepted the humiliation of a robe of
honor, and embraced with tears his son Mousa, who, at his request, was
sought and found among the captives of the field. The Ottoman princes
were lodged in a splendid pavilion; and the respect of the guards could
be surpassed only by their vigilance. On the arrival of the harem from
Boursa, Timour restored the queen Despina and her daughter to their
father and husband; but he piously required, that the Servian princess,
who had hitherto been indulged in the profession of Christianity, should
embrace without delay the religion of the prophet. In the feast of
victory, to which Bajazet was invited, the Mogul emperor placed a crown
on his head and a sceptre in his hand, with a solemn assurance of
restoring him with an increase of glory to the throne of his ancestors.
But the effect of his promise was disappointed by the sultan's untimely
death: amidst the care of the most skilful physicians, he expired of an
apoplexy at Akshehr, the Antioch of Pisidia, about nine months after his
defeat. The victor dropped a tear over his grave: his body, with royal
pomp, was conveyed to the mausoleum which he had erected at Boursa; and
his son Mousa, after receiving a rich present of gold and jewels, of
horses and arms, was invested by a patent in red ink with the kingdom of
Anatolia.

Such is the portrait of a generous conqueror, which has been extracted
from his own memorials, and dedicated to his son and grandson, nineteen
years after his decease;  <span id="fr_606"></span>[47](#fn_606.md) and, at
a time when the truth was remembered by thousands, a manifest falsehood
would have implied a satire on his real conduct. Weighty indeed is this
evidence, adopted by all the Persian histories;  <span
id="fr_607"></span>[48](#fn_607.md) yet flattery, more especially in the
East, is base and audacious; and the harsh and ignominious treatment of
Bajazet is attested by a chain of witnesses, some of whom shall be
produced in the order of their time and country. 1. The reader has not
forgot the garrison of French, whom the marshal Boucicault left behind
him for the defence of Constantinople. They were on the spot to receive
the earliest and most faithful intelligence of the overthrow of their
great adversary; and it is more than probable, that some of them
accompanied the Greek embassy to the camp of Tamerlane. From their
account, the hardships of the prison and death of Bajazet are affirmed
by the marshal's servant and historian, within the distance of seven
years.  <span id="fr_608"></span>[49](#fn_608.md) 2. The name of Poggius
the Italian  <span id="fr_609"></span>[50](#fn_609.md) is deservedly famous
among the revivers of learning in the fifteenth century. His elegant
dialogue on the vicissitudes of fortune  <span
id="fr_610"></span>[51](#fn_610.md) was composed in his fiftieth year,
twenty-eight years after the Turkish victory of Tamerlane;  <span
id="fr_611"></span>[52](#fn_611.md) whom he celebrates as not inferior to
the illustrious Barbarians of antiquity. Of his exploits and discipline
Poggius was informed by several ocular witnesses; nor does he forget an
example so apposite to his theme as the Ottoman monarch, whom the
Scythian confined like a wild beast in an iron cage, and exhibited a
spectacle to Asia. I might add the authority of two Italian chronicles,
perhaps of an earlier date, which would prove at least that the same
story, whether false or true, was imported into Europe with the first
tidings of the revolution.  <span id="fr_612"></span>[53](#fn_612.md) 3. At
the time when Poggius flourished at Rome, Ahmed Ebn Arabshah composed at
Damascus the florid and malevolent history of Timour, for which he had
collected materials in his journeys over Turkey and Tartary.  <span
id="fr_613"></span>[54](#fn_613.md) Without any possible correspondence
between the Latin and the Arabian writer, they agree in the fact of the
iron cage; and their agreement is a striking proof of their common
veracity. Ahmed Arabshah likewise relates another outrage, which Bajazet
endured, of a more domestic and tender nature. His indiscreet mention of
women and divorces was deeply resented by the jealous Tartar: in the
feast of victory the wine was served by female cupbearers, and the
sultan beheld his own concubines and wives confounded among the slaves,
and exposed without a veil to the eyes of intemperance. To escape a
similar indignity, it is said that his successors, except in a single
instance, have abstained from legitimate nuptials; and the Ottoman
practice and belief, at least in the sixteenth century, is asserted by
the observing Busbequius,  <span id="fr_614"></span>[55](#fn_614.md)
ambassador from the court of Vienna to the great Soliman. 4. Such is the
separation of language, that the testimony of a Greek is not less
independent than that of a Latin or an Arab. I suppress the names of
Chalcondyles and Ducas, who flourished in the latter period, and who
speak in a less positive tone; but more attention is due to George
Phranza,  <span id="fr_615"></span>[56](#fn_615.md) protovestiare of the
last emperors, and who was born a year before the battle of Angora.
Twenty-two years after that event, he was sent ambassador to Amurath the
Second; and the historian might converse with some veteran Janizaries,
who had been made prisoners with the sultan, and had themselves seen him
in his iron cage. 5. The last evidence, in every sense, is that of the
Turkish annals, which have been consulted or transcribed by Leunclavius,
Pocock, and Cantemir.  <span id="fr_616"></span>[57](#fn_616.md) They
unanimously deplore the captivity of the iron cage; and some credit may
be allowed to national historians, who cannot stigmatize the Tartar
without uncovering the shame of their king and country.

From these opposite premises, a fair and moderate conclusion may be
deduced. I am satisfied that Sherefeddin Ali has faithfully described
the first ostentatious interview, in which the conqueror, whose spirits
were harmonized by success, affected the character of generosity. But
his mind was insensibly alienated by the unseasonable arrogance of
Bajazet; the complaints of his enemies, the Anatolian princes, were just
and vehement; and Timour betrayed a design of leading his royal captive
in triumph to Samarcand. An attempt to facilitate his escape, by digging
a mine under the tent, provoked the Mogul emperor to impose a harsher
restraint; and in his perpetual marches, an iron cage on a wagon might
be invented, not as a wanton insult, but as a rigorous precaution.
Timour had read in some fabulous history a similar treatment of one of
his predecessors, a king of Persia; and Bajazet was condemned to
represent the person, and expiate the guilt, of the Roman Caesar  <span
id="fr_617"></span>[58](#fn_617.md)  <span
id="fr_618"></span>[\*\_0046](#fn_618.md) But the strength of his mind and
body fainted under the trial, and his premature death might, without
injustice, be ascribed to the severity of Timour. He warred not with the
dead: a tear and a sepulchre were all that he could bestow on a captive
who was delivered from his power; and if Mousa, the son of Bajazet, was
permitted to reign over the ruins of Boursa, the greatest part of the
province of Anatolia had been restored by the conqueror to their lawful
sovereigns.

From the Irtish and Volga to the Persian Gulf, and from the Ganges to
Damascus and the Archipelago, Asia was in the hand of Timour: his armies
were invincible, his ambition was boundless, and his zeal might aspire
to conquer and convert the Christian kingdoms of the West, which already
trembled at his name. He touched the utmost verge of the land; but an
insuperable, though narrow, sea rolled between the two continents of
Europe and Asia;  <span id="fr_619"></span>[59](#fn_619.md) and the lord of
so many tomans, or myriads, of horse, was not master of a single galley.
The two passages of the Bosphorus and Hellespont, of Constantinople and
Gallipoli, were possessed, the one by the Christians, the other by the
Turks. On this great occasion, they forgot the difference of religion,
to act with union and firmness in the common cause: the double straits
were guarded with ships and fortifications; and they separately withheld
the transports which Timour demanded of either nation, under the
pretence of attacking their enemy. At the same time, they soothed his
pride with tributary gifts and suppliant embassies, and prudently
tempted him to retreat with the honors of victory. Soliman, the son of
Bajazet, implored his clemency for his father and himself; accepted, by
a red patent, the investiture of the kingdom of Romania, which he
already held by the sword; and reiterated his ardent wish, of casting
himself in person at the feet of the king of the world. The Greek
emperor  <span id="fr_620"></span>[60](#fn_620) (either John or Manuel.md)
submitted to pay the same tribute which he had stipulated with the
Turkish sultan, and ratified the treaty by an oath of allegiance, from
which he could absolve his conscience so soon as the Mogul arms had
retired from Anatolia. But the fears and fancy of nations ascribed to
the ambitious Tamerlane a new design of vast and romantic compass; a
design of subduing Egypt and Africa, marching from the Nile to the
Atlantic Ocean, entering Europe by the Straits of Gibraltar, and, after
imposing his yoke on the kingdoms of Christendom, of returning home by
the deserts of Russia and Tartary. This remote, and perhaps imaginary,
danger was averted by the submission of the sultan of Egypt: the honors
of the prayer and the coin attested at Cairo the supremacy of Timour;
and a rare gift of a giraffe, or camelopard, and nine ostriches,
represented at Samarcand the tribute of the African world. Our
imagination is not less astonished by the portrait of a Mogul, who, in
his camp before Smyrna, meditates, and almost accomplishes, the invasion
of the Chinese empire.  <span id="fr_621"></span>[61](#fn_621.md) Timour
was urged to this enterprise by national honor and religious zeal. The
torrents which he had shed of Mussulman blood could be expiated only by
an equal destruction of the infidels; and as he now stood at the gates
of paradise, he might best secure his glorious entrance by demolishing
the idols of China, founding mosques in every city, and establishing the
profession of faith in one God, and his prophet Mahomet. The recent
expulsion of the house of Zingis was an insult on the Mogul name; and
the disorders of the empire afforded the fairest opportunity for
revenge. The illustrious Hongvou, founder of the dynasty of Ming, died
four years before the battle of Angora; and his grandson, a weak and
unfortunate youth, was burnt in his palace, after a million of Chinese
had perished in the civil war.  <span id="fr_622"></span>[62](#fn_622.md)
Before he evacuated Anatolia, Timour despatched beyond the Sihoon a
numerous army, or rather colony, of his old and new subjects, to open
the road, to subdue the Pagan Calmucks and Mungals, and to found cities
and magazines in the desert; and, by the diligence of his lieutenant, he
soon received a perfect map and description of the unknown regions, from
the source of the Irtish to the wall of China. During these
preparations, the emperor achieved the final conquest of Georgia; passed
the winter on the banks of the Araxes; appeased the troubles of Persia;
and slowly returned to his capital, after a campaign of four years and
nine months.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_591"></span>[33](daf06021.htm#fr_591.md) See the reigns of
Barkok and Pharadge, in M. De Guignes, (tom. iv. l. xxii.,) who, from
the Arabic texts of Aboulmahasen, Ebn (Schounah, and Aintabi, has added
some facts to our common stock of materials.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[34](daf06021.htm#fr_592.md) For these recent and
domestic transactions, Arabshah, though a partial, is a credible,
witness, (tom. i. c. 64 - 68, tom. ii. c. 1 - 14.) Timour must have been
odious to a Syrian; but the notoriety of facts would have obliged him,
in some measure, to respect his enemy and himself. His bitters may
correct the luscious sweets of Sherefeddin, (l. v. c. 17 - 29)

<span id="fn_593"></span>[35](daf06021.htm#fr_593.md) These interesting
conversations appear to have been copied by Arabshah (tom. i. c. 68, p.
625 - 645) from the cadhi and historian Ebn Schounah, a principal actor.
Yet how could he be alive seventy-five years afterwards? (D'Herbelot, p.
792.)

<span id="fn_594"></span>[36](daf06021.htm#fr_594.md) The marches and
occupations of Timour between the Syrian and Ottoman wars are
represented by Sherefeddin (l. v. c. 29 - 43) and Arabshah, (tom. ii. c.
15 - 18.)

<span id="fn_595"></span>[37](daf06021.htm#fr_595.md) This number of
800,000 was extracted by Arabshah, or rather by Ebn Schounah, ex
rationario Timuri, on the faith of a Carizmian officer, (tom. i. c. 68,
p. 617;) and it is remarkable enough, that a Greek historian (Phranza,
l. i. c. 29) adds no more than 20,000 men. Poggius reckons 1,000,000;
another Latin contemporary (Chron. Tarvisianum, apud Muratori, tom. xix.
p. 800) 1,100,000; and the enormous sum of 1,600,000 is attested by a
German soldier, who was present at the battle of Angora, (Leunclay. ad
Chalcondyl. l. iii. p. 82.) Timour, in his Institutions, has not deigned
to calculate his troops, his subjects, or his revenues.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[38](daf06021.htm#fr_596.md) A wide latitude of
non-effectives was allowed by the Great Mogul for his own pride and the
benefit of his officers. Bernier's patron was Penge-Hazari, commander of
5000 horse; of which he maintained no more than 500, (Voyages, tom. i.
p. 288, 289.)

<span id="fn_597"></span>[39](daf06021.htm#fr_597.md) Timour himself fixes
at 400,000 men the Ottoman army, (Institutions, p. 153,) which is
reduced to 150,000 by Phranza, (l. i. c. 29,) and swelled by the German
soldier to 1,400,000. It is evident that the Moguls were the more
numerous.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[40](daf06021.htm#fr_598.md) It may not be useless
to mark the distances between Angora and the neighboring cities, by the
journeys of the caravans, each of twenty or twenty-five miles; to Smyrna
xx., to Kiotahia x., to Boursa x., to Caesarea, viii., to Sinope x., to
Nicomed a ix., to Constantinople xii. or xiii., (see Tournefort, Voyage
au Levant, tom. ii. lettre xxi.)

<span id="fn_599"></span>[41](daf06021.htm#fr_599.md) See the Systems of
Tactics in the Institutions, which the English editors have illustrated
with elaborate plans, (p. 373 - 407.)

<span id="fn_600"></span>[42](daf06021.htm#fr_600.md) The sultan himself
(says Timour) must then put the foot of courage into the stirrup of
patience. A Tartar metaphor, which is lost in the English, but preserved
in the French, version of the Institutes, (p. 156, 157.)

<span id="fn_601"></span>[43](daf06021.htm#fr_601.md) The Greek fire, on
Timour's side, is attested by Sherefeddin, (l. v. c. 47;) but Voltaire's
strange suspicion, that some cannon, inscribed with strange characters,
must have been sent by that monarch to Delhi, is refuted by the
universal silence of contemporaries.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[\*\_0045](daf06021.htm#fr_602.md) See V. Hammer,
vol. i. p. 310, for the singular hints which were conveyed to him of the
wisdom of unlocking his hoarded treasures. - M.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[44](daf06021.htm#fr_603.md) Timour has dissembled
this secret and important negotiation with the Tartars, which is
indisputably proved by the joint evidence of the Arabian, (tom. i. c.
47, p. 391,) Turkish, (Annal. Leunclav. p. 321,) and Persian historians,
(Khondemir, apud d'Herbelot, p. 882.)

<span id="fn_604"></span>[45](daf06021.htm#fr_604.md) For the war of
Anatolia or Roum, I add some hints in the Institutions, to the copious
narratives of Sherefeddin (l. v. c. 44 - 65) and Arabshah, (tom. ii. c.
20 - 35.) On this part only of Timour's history it is lawful to quote
the Turks, (Cantemir, p. 53 - 55, Annal. Leunclav. p. 320 - 322,) and
the Greeks, (Phranza, l. i. c. 59, Ducas, c. 15 - 17, Chalcondyles, l.
iii.)

<span id="fn_605"></span>[46](daf06021.htm#fr_605.md) The scepticism of
Voltaire (Essai sur l'Histoire Generale, c. 88) is ready on this, as on
every occasion, to reject a popular tale, and to diminish the magnitude
of vice and virtue; and on most occasions his incredulity is reasonable.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[47](daf06021.htm#fr_606.md) See the History of
Sherefeddin, (l. v. c. 49, 52, 53, 59, 60.) This work was finished at
Shiraz, in the year 1424, and dedicated to Sultan Ibrahim, the son of
Sharokh, the son of Timour, who reigned in Farsistan in his father's
lifetime.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[48](daf06021.htm#fr_607.md) After the perusal of
Khondemir, Ebn Schounah, &c., the learned D'Herbelot (Bibliot.
Orientale, p. 882) may affirm, that this fable is not mentioned in the
most authentic histories; but his denial of the visible testimony of
Arabshah leaves some room to suspect his accuracy.

Memoires de Boucicault, P. i. c. 37. These Memoirs were composed while
the marshal was still governor of Genoa, from whence he was expelled in
the year 1409, by a popular insurrection, (Muratori, Annali d'Italia,
tom. xii. p. 473, 474.)

<span id="fn_609"></span>[50](daf06021.htm#fr_609.md) The reader will find
a satisfactory account of the life and writings of Poggius in the
Poggiana, an entertaining work of M. Lenfant, and in the Bibliotheca
Latina Mediae et Infimae Aetatis of Fabricius, (tom. v. p. 305 - 308.)
Poggius was born in the year 1380, and died in 1459.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[51](daf06021.htm#fr_610.md) The dialogue de
Varietate Fortunae, (of which a complete and elegant edition has been
published at Paris in 1723, in 4to.,) was composed a short time before
the death of Pope Martin V., (p. 5,) and consequently about the end of
the year 1430.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[52](daf06021.htm#fr_611.md) See a splendid and
eloquent encomium of Tamerlane, p. 36 - 39 ipse enim novi (says Poggius)
qui fuere in ejus castris . . . . Regen vivum cepit, caveaque in modum
ferae inclusum per omnem Asian circumtulit egregium admirandumque
spectaculum fortunae.

Tarvisianum, (in Muratori, Script. Rerum Italicarum tom. xix. p. 800,)
and the Annales Estenses, (tom. xviii. p. 974.) The two authors, Andrea
de Redusiis de Quero, and James de Delayto, were both contemporaries,
and both chancellors, the one of Trevigi, the other of Ferrara. The
evidence of the former is the most positive.

Legatione Turcica, epist. i. p. 52. Yet his respectable authority is
somewhat shaken by the subsequent marriages of Amurath II. with a
Servian, and of Mahomet II. with an Asiatic, princess, (Cantemir, p. 83,
93.)

<span id="fn_615"></span>[56](daf06021.htm#fr_615.md) See the testimony of
George Phranza, (l. i. c. 29,) and his life in Hanckius (de Script.
Byzant. P. i. c. 40.) Chalcondyles and Ducas speak in general terms of
Bajazet's chains.

Note: Von Hammer, p. 318, cites several authorities unknown to Gibbon -
M

<span id="fn_617"></span>[58](daf06021.htm#fr_617.md) Sapor, king of
Persia, had been made prisoner, and enclosed in the figure of a cow's
hide by Maximian or Galerius Caesar. Such is the fable related by
Eutychius, (Annal. tom. i. p. 421, vers. Pocock. The recollection of the
true history (Decline and Fall, &c., vol. ii. p 140 - 152) will teach us
to appreciate the knowledge of the Orientals of the ages which precede
the Hegira.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[\*\_0046](daf06021.htm#fr_618.md) Von Hammer's
explanation of this contested point is both simple and satisfactory. It
originates in a mistake in the meaning of the Turkish word kafe, which
means a covered litter or palanquin drawn by two horses, and is
generally used to convey the harem of an Eastern monarch. In such a
litter, with the lattice-work made of iron, Bajazet either chose or was
constrained to travel. This was either mistaken for, or transformed by,
ignorant relaters into a cage. The European Schiltberger, the two oldest
of the Turkish historians, and the most valuable of the later compilers,
Seadeddin, describe this litter. Seadeddin discusses the question with
some degree of historical criticism, and ascribes the choice of such a
vehicle to the indignant state of Bajazet's mind, which would not brook
the sight of his Tartar conquerors. Von Hammer, p. 320. - M.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[59](daf06021.htm#fr_619.md) Arabshah (tom. ii. c.
25) describes, like a curious traveller, the Straits of Gallipoli and
Constantinople. To acquire a just idea of these events, I have compared
the narratives and prejudices of the Moguls, Turks, Greeks, and
Arabians. The Spanish ambassador mentions this hostile union of the
Christians and Ottomans, (Vie de Timour, p. 96.)

<span id="fn_620"></span>[60](daf06021.htm#fr_620.md) Since the name of
Caesar had been transferred to the sultans of Roum, the Greek princes of
Constantinople (Sherefeddin, l. v. c. 54 were confounded with the
Christian lords of Gallipoli, Thessalonica, &c. under the title of
Tekkur, which is derived by corruption from the genitive, (Cantemir, p.
51.)

<span id="fn_621"></span>[61](daf06021.htm#fr_621.md) See Sherefeddin, l.
v. c. 4, who marks, in a just itinerary, the road to China, which
Arabshah (tom. ii. c. 33) paints in vague and rhetorical colors.
