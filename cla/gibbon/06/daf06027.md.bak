### Chapter LXVII: Schism Of The Greeks And Latins. Part I.

Schism Of The Greeks And Latins. - Reign And Character Of Amurath The
Second. - Crusade Of Ladislaus, King Of Hungary. - His Defeat And Death.
- John Huniades. - Scanderbeg. - Constantine Palaeologus, Last Emperor
Of The East.

The respective merits of Rome and Constantinople are compared and
celebrated by an eloquent Greek, the father of the Italian schools.
 <span id="fr_775"></span>[1](#fn_775.md) The view of the ancient capital,
the seat of his ancestors, surpassed the most sanguine expectations of
Emanuel Chrysoloras; and he no longer blamed the exclamation of an old
sophist, that Rome was the habitation, not of men, but of gods. Those
gods, and those men, had long since vanished; but to the eye of liberal
enthusiasm, the majesty of ruin restored the image of her ancient
prosperity. The monuments of the consuls and Caesars, of the martyrs and
apostles, engaged on all sides the curiosity of the philosopher and the
Christian; and he confessed that in every age the arms and the religion
of Rome were destined to reign over the earth. While Chrysoloras admired
the venerable beauties of the mother, he was not forgetful of his native
country, her fairest daughter, her Imperial colony; and the Byzantine
patriot expatiates with zeal and truth on the eternal advantages of
nature, and the more transitory glories of art and dominion, which
adorned, or had adorned, the city of Constantine. Yet the perfection of
the copy still redounds (as he modestly observes) to the honor of the
original, and parents are delighted to be renewed, and even excelled, by
the superior merit of their children. "Constantinople," says the orator,
"is situate on a commanding point, between Europe and Asia, between the
Archipelago and the Euxine. By her interposition, the two seas, and the
two continents, are united for the common benefit of nations; and the
gates of commerce may be shut or opened at her command. The harbor,
encompassed on all sides by the sea, and the continent, is the most
secure and capacious in the world. The walls and gates of Constantinople
may be compared with those of Babylon: the towers many; each tower is a
solid and lofty structure; and the second wall, the outer fortification,
would be sufficient for the defence and dignity of an ordinary capital.
A broad and rapid stream may be introduced into the ditches and the
artificial island may be encompassed, like Athens, by land or
water." <span id="fr_776"></span>[2](#fn_776.md) Two strong and natural
causes are alleged for the perfection of the model of new Rome. The
royal founder reigned over the most illustrious nations of the globe;
and in the accomplishment of his designs, the power of the Romans was
combined with the art and science of the Greeks. Other cities have been
reared to maturity by accident and time: their beauties are mingled with
disorder and deformity; and the inhabitants, unwilling to remove from
their natal spot, are incapable of correcting the errors of their
ancestors, and the original vices of situation or climate. But the free
idea of Constantinople was formed and executed by a single mind; and the
primitive model was improved by the obedient zeal of the subjects and
successors of the first monarch. The adjacent isles were stored with an
inexhaustible supply of marble; but the various materials were
transported from the most remote shores of Europe and Asia; and the
public and private buildings, the palaces, churches, aqueducts,
cisterns, porticos, columns, baths, and hippodromes, were adapted to the
greatness of the capital of the East. The superfluity of wealth was
spread along the shores of Europe and Asia; and the Byzantine territory,
as far as the Euxine, the Hellespont, and the long wall, might be
considered as a populous suburb and a perpetual garden. In this
flattering picture, the past and the present, the times of prosperity
and decay, are art fully confounded; but a sigh and a confession escape,
from the orator, that his wretched country was the shadow and sepulchre
of its former self. The works of ancient sculpture had been defaced by
Christian zeal or Barbaric violence; the fairest structures were
demolished; and the marbles of Paros or Numidia were burnt for lime, or
applied to the meanest uses. Of many a statue, the place was marked by
an empty pedestal; of many a column, the size was determined by a broken
capital; the tombs of the emperors were scattered on the ground; the
stroke of time was accelerated by storms and earthquakes; and the vacant
space was adorned, by vulgar tradition, with fabulous monuments of gold
and silver. From these wonders, which lived only in memory or belief, he
distinguishes, however, the porphyry pillar, the column and colossus of
Justinian,  <span id="fr_777"></span>[3](#fn_777.md) and the church, more
especially the dome, of St. Sophia; the best conclusion, since it could
not be described according to its merits, and after it no other object
could deserve to be mentioned. But he forgets that, a century before,
the trembling fabrics of the colossus and the church had been saved and
supported by the timely care of Andronicus the Elder. Thirty years after
the emperor had fortified St. Sophia with two new buttresses or
pyramids, the eastern hemisphere suddenly gave way: and the images, the
altars, and the sanctuary, were crushed by the falling ruin. The
mischief indeed was speedily repaired; the rubbish was cleared by the
incessant labor of every rank and age; and the poor remains of riches
and industry were consecrated by the Greeks to the most stately and
venerable temple of the East.  <span id="fr_778"></span>[4](#fn_778.md)

The last hope of the falling city and empire was placed in the harmony
of the mother and daughter, in the maternal tenderness of Rome, and the
filial obedience of Constantinople. In the synod of Florence, the Greeks
and Latins had embraced, and subscribed, and promised; but these signs
of friendship were perfidious or fruitless;  <span
id="fr_779"></span>[5](#fn_779.md) and the baseless fabric of the union
vanished like a dream.  <span id="fr_780"></span>[6](#fn_780.md) The
emperor and his prelates returned home in the Venetian galleys; but as
they touched at the Morea and the Isles of Corfu and Lesbos, the
subjects of the Latins complained that the pretended union would be an
instrument of oppression. No sooner did they land on the Byzantine
shore, than they were saluted, or rather assailed, with a general murmur
of zeal and discontent. During their absence, above two years, the
capital had been deprived of its civil and ecclesiastical rulers;
fanaticism fermented in anarchy; the most furious monks reigned over the
conscience of women and bigots; and the hatred of the Latin name was the
first principle of nature and religion. Before his departure for Italy,
the emperor had flattered the city with the assurance of a prompt relief
and a powerful succor; and the clergy, confident in their orthodoxy and
science, had promised themselves and their flocks an easy victory over
the blind shepherds of the West. The double disappointment exasperated
the Greeks; the conscience of the subscribing prelates was awakened; the
hour of temptation was past; and they had more to dread from the public
resentment, than they could hope from the favor of the emperor or the
pope. Instead of justifying their conduct, they deplored their weakness,
professed their contrition, and cast themselves on the mercy of God and
of their brethren. To the reproachful question, what had been the event
or the use of their Italian synod? they answered with sighs and tears,
"Alas! we have made a new faith; we have exchanged piety for impiety; we
have betrayed the immaculate sacrifice; and we are become Azymites."
(The Azymites were those who celebrated the communion with unleavened
bread; and I must retract or qualify the praise which I have bestowed on
the growing philosophy of the times.) "Alas! we have been seduced by
distress, by fraud, and by the hopes and fears of a transitory life. The
hand that has signed the union should be cut off; and the tongue that
has pronounced the Latin creed deserves to be torn from the root." The
best proof of their repentance was an increase of zeal for the most
trivial rites and the most incomprehensible doctrines; and an absolute
separation from all, without excepting their prince, who preserved some
regard for honor and consistency. After the decease of the patriarch
Joseph, the archbishops of Heraclea and Trebizond had courage to refuse
the vacant office; and Cardinal Bessarion preferred the warm and
comfortable shelter of the Vatican. The choice of the emperor and his
clergy was confined to Metrophanes of Cyzicus: he was consecrated in St.
Sophia, but the temple was vacant. The cross-bearers abdicated their
service; the infection spread from the city to the villages; and
Metrophanes discharged, without effect, some ecclesiastical thunders
against a nation of schismatics. The eyes of the Greeks were directed to
Mark of Ephesus, the champion of his country; and the sufferings of the
holy confessor were repaid with a tribute of admiration and applause.
His example and writings propagated the flame of religious discord; age
and infirmity soon removed him from the world; but the gospel of Mark
was not a law of forgiveness; and he requested with his dying breath,
that none of the adherents of Rome might attend his obsequies or pray
for his soul.

The schism was not confined to the narrow limits of the Byzantine
empire. Secure under the Mamaluke sceptre, the three patriarchs of
Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, assembled a numerous synod; disowned
their representatives at Ferrara and Florence; condemned the creed and
council of the Latins; and threatened the emperor of Constantinople with
the censures of the Eastern church. Of the sectaries of the Greek
communion, the Russians were the most powerful, ignorant, and
superstitious. Their primate, the cardinal Isidore, hastened from
Florence to Moscow,  <span id="fr_781"></span>[7](#fn_781.md) to reduce the
independent nation under the Roman yoke. But the Russian bishops had
been educated at Mount Athos; and the prince and people embraced the
theology of their priests. They were scandalized by the title, the pomp,
the Latin cross of the legate, the friend of those impious men who
shaved their beards, and performed the divine office with gloves on
their hands and rings on their fingers: Isidore was condemned by a
synod; his person was imprisoned in a monastery; and it was with extreme
difficulty that the cardinal could escape from the hands of a fierce and
fanatic people.  <span id="fr_782"></span>[8](#fn_782.md) The Russians
refused a passage to the missionaries of Rome who aspired to convert the
Pagans beyond the Tanais;  <span id="fr_783"></span>[9](#fn_783.md) and
their refusal was justified by the maxim, that the guilt of idolatry is
less damnable than that of schism. The errors of the Bohemians were
excused by their abhorrence for the pope; and a deputation of the Greek
clergy solicited the friendship of those sanguinary enthusiasts.  <span
id="fr_784"></span>[10](#fn_784.md) While Eugenius triumphed in the union
and orthodoxy of the Greeks, his party was contracted to the walls, or
rather to the palace of Constantinople. The zeal of Palaeologus had been
excited by interest; it was soon cooled by opposition: an attempt to
violate the national belief might endanger his life and crown; not could
the pious rebels be destitute of foreign and domestic aid. The sword of
his brother Demetrius, who in Italy had maintained a prudent and popular
silence, was half unsheathed in the cause of religion; and Amurath, the
Turkish sultan, was displeased and alarmed by the seeming friendship of
the Greeks and Latins.

"Sultan Murad, or Amurath, lived forty-nine, and reigned thirty years,
six months, and eight days. He was a just and valiant prince, of a great
soul, patient of labors, learned, merciful, religious, charitable; a
lover and encourager of the studious, and of all who excelled in any art
or science; a good emperor and a great general. No man obtained more or
greater victories than Amurath; Belgrade alone withstood his attacks.
 <span id="fr_785"></span>[\*\_0049](#fn_785.md) Under his reign, the
soldier was ever victorious, the citizen rich and secure. If he subdued
any country, his first care was to build mosques and caravansaras,
hospitals, and colleges. Every year he gave a thousand pieces of gold to
the sons of the Prophet; and sent two thousand five hundred to the
religious persons of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem."  <span
id="fr_786"></span>[11](#fn_786.md) This portrait is transcribed from the
historian of the Othman empire: but the applause of a servile and
superstitious people has been lavished on the worst of tyrants; and the
virtues of a sultan are often the vices most useful to himself, or most
agreeable to his subjects. A nation ignorant of the equal benefits of
liberty and law, must be awed by the flashes of arbitrary power: the
cruelty of a despot will assume the character of justice; his profusion,
of liberality; his obstinacy, of firmness. If the most reasonable excuse
be rejected, few acts of obedience will be found impossible; and guilt
must tremble, where innocence cannot always be secure. The tranquillity
of the people, and the discipline of the troops, were best maintained by
perpetual action in the field; war was the trade of the Janizaries; and
those who survived the peril, and divided the spoil, applauded the
generous ambition of their sovereign. To propagate the true religion,
was the duty of a faithful Mussulman: the unbelievers were his enemies,
and those of the Prophet; and, in the hands of the Turks, the scimeter
was the only instrument of conversion. Under these circumstances,
however, the justice and moderation of Amurath are attested by his
conduct, and acknowledged by the Christians themselves; who consider a
prosperous reign and a peaceful death as the reward of his singular
merits. In the vigor of his age and military power, he seldom engaged in
war till he was justified by a previous and adequate provocation: the
victorious sultan was disarmed by submission; and in the observance of
treaties, his word was inviolate and sacred.  <span
id="fr_787"></span>[12](#fn_787.md) The Hungarians were commonly the
aggressors; he was provoked by the revolt of Scanderbeg; and the
perfidious Caramanian was twice vanquished, and twice pardoned, by the
Ottoman monarch. Before he invaded the Morea, Thebes had been surprised
by the despot: in the conquest of Thessalonica, the grandson of Bajazet
might dispute the recent purchase of the Venetians; and after the first
siege of Constantinople, the sultan was never tempted, by the distress,
the absence, or the injuries of Palaeologus, to extinguish the dying
light of the Byzantine empire.

But the most striking feature in the life and character of Amurath is
the double abdication of the Turkish throne; and, were not his motives
debased by an alloy of superstition, we must praise the royal
philosopher,  <span id="fr_788"></span>[13](#fn_788.md) who at the age of
forty could discern the vanity of human greatness. Resigning the sceptre
to his son, he retired to the pleasant residence of Magnesia; but he
retired to the society of saints and hermits. It was not till the fourth
century of the Hegira, that the religion of Mahomet had been corrupted
by an institution so adverse to his genius; but in the age of the
crusades, the various orders of Dervises were multiplied by the example
of the Christian, and even the Latin, monks.  <span
id="fr_789"></span>[14](#fn_789.md) The lord of nations submitted to fast,
and pray, and turn round  <span id="fr_790"></span>[\*\_0050](#fn_790.md)
in endless rotation with the fanatics, who mistook the giddiness of the
head for the illumination of the spirit.  <span
id="fr_791"></span>[15](#fn_791.md) But he was soon awakened from his
dreams of enthusiasm by the Hungarian invasion; and his obedient son was
the foremost to urge the public danger and the wishes of the people.
Under the banner of their veteran leader, the Janizaries fought and
conquered but he withdrew from the field of Varna, again to pray, to
fast, and to turn round with his Magnesian brethren. These pious
occupations were again interrupted by the danger of the state. A
victorious army disdained the inexperience of their youthful ruler: the
city of Adrianople was abandoned to rapine and slaughter; and the
unanimous divan implored his presence to appease the tumult, and prevent
the rebellion, of the Janizaries. At the well-known voice of their
master, they trembled and obeyed; and the reluctant sultan was compelled
to support his splendid servitude, till at the end of four years, he was
relieved by the angel of death. Age or disease, misfortune or caprice,
have tempted several princes to descend from the throne; and they have
had leisure to repent of their irretrievable step. But Amurath alone, in
the full liberty of choice, after the trial of empire and solitude, has
repeated his preference of a private life.

After the departure of his Greek brethren, Eugenius had not been
unmindful of their temporal interest; and his tender regard for the
Byzantine empire was animated by a just apprehension of the Turks, who
approached, and might soon invade, the borders of Italy. But the spirit
of the crusades had expired; and the coldness of the Franks was not less
unreasonable than their headlong passion. In the eleventh century, a
fanatic monk could precipitate Europe on Asia for the recovery of the
holy sepulchre; but in the fifteenth, the most pressing motives of
religion and policy were insufficient to unite the Latins in the defence
of Christendom. Germany was an inexhaustible storehouse of men and arms:
 <span id="fr_792"></span>[16](#fn_792.md) but that complex and languid
body required the impulse of a vigorous hand; and Frederic the Third was
alike impotent in his personal character and his Imperial dignity. A
long war had impaired the strength, without satiating the animosity, of
France and England:  <span id="fr_793"></span>[17](#fn_793.md) but Philip
duke of Burgundy was a vain and magnificent prince; and he enjoyed,
without danger or expense, the adventurous piety of his subjects, who
sailed, in a gallant fleet, from the coast of Flanders to the
Hellespont. The maritime republics of Venice and Genoa were less remote
from the scene of action; and their hostile fleets were associated under
the standard of St. Peter. The kingdoms of Hungary and Poland, which
covered as it were the interior pale of the Latin church, were the most
nearly concerned to oppose the progress of the Turks. Arms were the
patrimony of the Scythians and Sarmatians; and these nations might
appear equal to the contest, could they point, against the common foe,
those swords that were so wantonly drawn in bloody and domestic
quarrels. But the same spirit was adverse to concord and obedience: a
poor country and a limited monarch are incapable of maintaining a
standing force; and the loose bodies of Polish and Hungarian horse were
not armed with the sentiments and weapons which, on some occasions, have
given irresistible weight to the French chivalry. Yet, on this side, the
designs of the Roman pontiff, and the eloquence of Cardinal Julian, his
legate, were promoted by the circumstances of the times:  <span
id="fr_794"></span>[18](#fn_794.md) by the union of the two crowns on the
head of Ladislaus,  <span id="fr_795"></span>[19](#fn_795.md) a young and
ambitious soldier; by the valor of a hero, whose name, the name of John
Huniades, was already popular among the Christians, and formidable to
the Turks. An endless treasure of pardons and indulgences was scattered
by the legate; many private warriors of France and Germany enlisted
under the holy banner; and the crusade derived some strength, or at
least some reputation, from the new allies both of Europe and Asia. A
fugitive despot of Servia exaggerated the distress and ardor of the
Christians beyond the Danube, who would unanimously rise to vindicate
their religion and liberty. The Greek emperor,  <span
id="fr_796"></span>[20](#fn_796.md) with a spirit unknown to his fathers,
engaged to guard the Bosphorus, and to sally from Constantinople at the
head of his national and mercenary troops. The sultan of Caramania
 <span id="fr_797"></span>[21](#fn_797.md) announced the retreat of
Amurath, and a powerful diversion in the heart of Anatolia; and if the
fleets of the West could occupy at the same moment the Straits of the
Hellespont, the Ottoman monarchy would be dissevered and destroyed.
Heaven and earth must rejoice in the perdition of the miscreants; and
the legate, with prudent ambiguity, instilled the opinion of the
invisible, perhaps the visible, aid of the Son of God, and his divine
mother.

Of the Polish and Hungarian diets, a religious war was the unanimous
cry; and Ladislaus, after passing the Danube, led an army of his
confederate subjects as far as Sophia, the capital of the Bulgarian
kingdom. In this expedition they obtained two signal victories, which
were justly ascribed to the valor and conduct of Huniades. In the first,
with a vanguard of ten thousand men, he surprised the Turkish camp; in
the second, he vanquished and made prisoner the most renowned of their
generals, who possessed the double advantage of ground and numbers. The
approach of winter, and the natural and artificial obstacles of Mount
Haemus, arrested the progress of the hero, who measured a narrow
interval of six days' march from the foot of the mountains to the
hostile towers of Adrianople, and the friendly capital of the Greek
empire. The retreat was undisturbed; and the entrance into Buda was at
once a military and religious triumph. An ecclesiastical procession was
followed by the king and his warriors on foot: he nicely balanced the
merits and rewards of the two nations; and the pride of conquest was
blended with the humble temper of Christianity. Thirteen bashaws, nine
standards, and four thousand captives, were unquestionable trophies; and
as all were willing to believe, and none were present to contradict, the
crusaders multiplied, with unblushing confidence, the myriads of Turks
whom they had left on the field of battle.  <span
id="fr_798"></span>[22](#fn_798.md) The most solid proof, and the most
salutary consequence, of victory, was a deputation from the divan to
solicit peace, to restore Servia, to ransom the prisoners, and to
evacuate the Hungarian frontier. By this treaty, the rational objects of
the war were obtained: the king, the despot, and Huniades himself, in
the diet of Segedin, were satisfied with public and private emolument; a
truce of ten years was concluded; and the followers of Jesus and
Mahomet, who swore on the Gospel and the Koran, attested the word of God
as the guardian of truth and the avenger of perfidy. In the place of the
Gospel, the Turkish ministers had proposed to substitute the Eucharist,
the real presence of the Catholic deity; but the Christians refused to
profane their holy mysteries; and a superstitious conscience is less
forcibly bound by the spiritual energy, than by the outward and visible
symbols of an oath.  <span id="fr_799"></span>[23](#fn_799.md)

During the whole transaction, the cardinal legate had observed a sullen
silence, unwilling to approve, and unable to oppose, the consent of the
king and people. But the diet was not dissolved before Julian was
fortified by the welcome intelligence, that Anatolia was invaded by the
Caramanian, and Thrace by the Greek emperor; that the fleets of Genoa,
Venice, and Burgundy, were masters of the Hellespont; and that the
allies, informed of the victory, and ignorant of the treaty, of
Ladislaus, impatiently waited for the return of his victorious army.
"And is it thus," exclaimed the cardinal,  <span
id="fr_800"></span>[24](#fn_800.md) "that you will desert their
expectations and your own fortune? It is to them, to your God, and your
fellow-Christians, that you have pledged your faith; and that prior
obligation annihilates a rash and sacrilegious oath to the enemies of
Christ. His vicar on earth is the Roman pontiff; without whose sanction
you can neither promise nor perform. In his name I absolve your perjury
and sanctify your arms: follow my footsteps in the paths of glory and
salvation; and if still ye have scruples, devolve on my head the
punishment and the sin." This mischievous casuistry was seconded by his
respectable character, and the levity of popular assemblies: war was
resolved, on the same spot where peace had so lately been sworn; and, in
the execution of the treaty, the Turks were assaulted by the Christians;
to whom, with some reason, they might apply the epithet of Infidels. The
falsehood of Ladislaus to his word and oath was palliated by the
religion of the times: the most perfect, or at least the most popular,
excuse would have been the success of his arms and the deliverance of
the Eastern church. But the same treaty which should have bound his
conscience had diminished his strength. On the proclamation of the
peace, the French and German volunteers departed with indignant murmurs:
the Poles were exhausted by distant warfare, and perhaps disgusted with
foreign command; and their palatines accepted the first license, and
hastily retired to their provinces and castles. Even Hungary was divided
by faction, or restrained by a laudable scruple; and the relics of the
crusade that marched in the second expedition were reduced to an
inadequate force of twenty thousand men. A Walachian chief, who joined
the royal standard with his vassals, presumed to remark that their
numbers did not exceed the hunting retinue that sometimes attended the
sultan; and the gift of two horses of matchless speed might admonish
Ladislaus of his secret foresight of the event. But the despot of
Servia, after the restoration of his country and children, was tempted
by the promise of new realms; and the inexperience of the king, the
enthusiasm of the legate, and the martial presumption of Huniades
himself, were persuaded that every obstacle must yield to the invincible
virtue of the sword and the cross. After the passage of the Danube, two
roads might lead to Constantinople and the Hellespont: the one direct,
abrupt, and difficult through the mountains of Haemus; the other more
tedious and secure, over a level country, and along the shores of the
Euxine; in which their flanks, according to the Scythian discipline,
might always be covered by a movable fortification of wagons. The latter
was judiciously preferred: the Catholics marched through the plains of
Bulgaria, burning, with wanton cruelty, the churches and villages of the
Christian natives; and their last station was at Warna, near the
sea-shore; on which the defeat and death of Ladislaus have bestowed a
memorable name.  <span id="fr_801"></span>[25](#fn_801.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_775"></span>[1](daf06027.htm#fr_775.md) The epistle of Emanuel
Chrysoloras to the emperor John Palaeologus will not offend the eye or
ear of a classical student, (ad calcem Codini de Antiquitatibus C. P. p.
107 - 126.) The superscription suggests a chronological remark, that
John Palaeologus II. was associated in the empire before the year 1414,
the date of Chrysoloras's death. A still earlier date, at least 1408, is
deduced from the age of his youngest sons, Demetrius and Thomas, who
were both Porphyrogeniti (Ducange, Fam. Byzant. p. 244, 247.)

<span id="fn_776"></span>[2](daf06027.htm#fr_776.md) Somebody observed that
the city of Athens might be circumnavigated. But what may be true in a
rhetorical sense of Constantinople, cannot be applied to the situation
of Athens, five miles from the sea, and not intersected or surrounded by
any navigable streams.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[3](daf06027.htm#fr_777.md) Nicephorus Gregoras
has described the Colossus of Justinian, (l. vii. 12:) but his measures
are false and inconsistent. The editor Boivin consulted his friend
Girardon; and the sculptor gave him the true proportions of an
equestrian statue. That of Justinian was still visible to Peter Gyllius,
not on the column, but in the outward court of the seraglio; and he was
at Constantinople when it was melted down, and cast into a brass cannon,
(de Topograph. C. P. l. ii. c. 17.)

<span id="fn_778"></span>[4](daf06027.htm#fr_778.md) See the decay and
repairs of St. Sophia, in Nicephorus Gregoras (l. vii. 12, l. xv. 2.)
The building was propped by Andronicus in 1317, the eastern hemisphere
fell in 1345. The Greeks, in their pompous rhetoric, exalt the beauty
and holiness of the church, an earthly heaven the abode of angels, and
of God himself, &c.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[5](daf06027.htm#fr_779.md) The genuine and
original narrative of Syropulus (p. 312 - 351) opens the schism from the
first office of the Greeks at Venice to the general opposition at
Constantinople, of the clergy and people.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[6](daf06027.htm#fr_780.md) On the schism of
Constantinople, see Phranza, (l. ii. c. 17,) Laonicus Chalcondyles, (l.
vi. p. 155, 156,) and Ducas, (c. 31;) the last of whom writes with truth
and freedom. Among the moderns we may distinguish the continuator of
Fleury, (tom. xxii. p. 338, &c., 401, 420, &c.,) and Spondanus, (A.D.
1440 - 50.) The sense of the latter is drowned in prejudice and passion,
as soon as Rome and religion are concerned.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[7](daf06027.htm#fr_781.md) Isidore was
metropolitan of Kiow, but the Greeks subject to Poland have removed that
see from the ruins of Kiow to Lemberg, or Leopold, (Herbestein, in
Ramusio, tom. ii. p. 127.) On the other hand, the Russians transferred
their spiritual obedience to the archbishop, who became, in 1588, the
patriarch, of Moscow, (Levesque Hist. de Russie, tom. iii. p. 188, 190,
from a Greek Ms. at Turin, Iter et labores Archiepiscopi Arsenii.)

<span id="fn_782"></span>[8](daf06027.htm#fr_782.md) The curious narrative
of Levesque (Hist. de Russie, tom. ii. p. 242 - 247) is extracted from
the patriarchal archives. The scenes of Ferrara and Florence are
described by ignorance and passion; but the Russians are credible in the
account of their own prejudices.

<span id="fn_783"></span>[9](daf06027.htm#fr_783.md) The Shamanism, the
ancient religion of the Samanaeans and Gymnosophists, has been driven by
the more popular Bramins from India into the northern deserts: the naked
philosophers were compelled to wrap themselves in fur; but they
insensibly sunk into wizards and physicians. The Mordvans and
Tcheremisses in the European Russia adhere to this religion, which is
formed on the earthly model of one king or God, his ministers or angels,
and the rebellious spirits who oppose his government. As these tribes of
the Volga have no images, they might more justly retort on the Latin
missionaries the name of idolaters, (Levesque, Hist. des Peuples soumis
a la Domination des Russes, tom. i. p. 194 - 237, 423 - 460.)

Eccles. tom ii. A.D. 1451, No. 13. The epistle of the Greeks with a
Latin version, is extant in the college library at Prague.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[\*\_0049](daf06027.htm#fr_785.md) See the siege
and massacre at Thessalonica. Von Hammer vol. i p. 433 - M.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[11](daf06027.htm#fr_786.md) See Cantemir, History
of the Othman Empire, p. 94. Muraq, or Morad, may be more correct: but I
have preferred the popular name to that obscure diligence which is
rarely successful in translating an Oriental, into the Roman, alphabet.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[12](daf06027.htm#fr_787.md) See Chalcondyles, (l.
vii. p. 186, 198,) Ducas, (c. 33,) and Marinus Barletius, (in Vit.
Scanderbeg, p. 145, 146.) In his good faith towards the garrison of
Sfetigrade, he was a lesson and example to his son Mahomet.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[13](daf06027.htm#fr_788.md) Voltaire (Essai sur
l'Histoire Generale, c. 89, p. 283, 284) admires le Philosophe Turc:
would he have bestowed the same praise on a Christian prince for
retiring to a monastery? In his way, Voltaire was a bigot, an intolerant
bigot.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[14](daf06027.htm#fr_789.md) See the articles
Dervische, Fakir, Nasser, Rohbaniat, in D'Herbelot's Bibliotheque
Orientale. Yet the subject is superficially treated from the Persian and
Arabian writers. It is among the Turks that these orders have
principally flourished.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[\*\_0050](daf06027.htm#fr_790.md) Gibbon has
fallen into a remarkable error. The unmonastic retreat of Amurath was
that of an epicurean rather than of a dervis; more like that of
Sardanapalus than of Charles the Fifth. Profane, not divine, love was
its chief occupation: the only dance, that described by Horace as
belonging to the country, motus doceri gaudet Ionicos. See Von Hammer
note, p. 652. - M

<span id="fn_791"></span>[15](daf06027.htm#fr_791.md) Ricaut (in the
Present State of the Ottoman Empire, p. 242 - 268) affords much
information, which he drew from his personal conversation with the heads
of the dervises, most of whom ascribed their origin to the time of
Orchan. He does not mention the Zichidae of Chalcondyles, (l. vii. p.
286,) among whom Amurath retired: the Seids of that author are the
descendants of Mahomet.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[16](daf06027.htm#fr_792.md) In the year 1431,
Germany raised 40,000 horse, men-at-arms, against the Hussites of
Bohemia, (Lenfant, Hist. du Concile de Basle, tom. i. p. 318.) At the
siege of Nuys, on the Rhine, in 1474, the princes, prelates, and cities,
sent their respective quotas; and the bishop of Munster (qui n'est pas
des plus grands) furnished 1400 horse, 6000 foot, all in green, with
1200 wagons. The united armies of the king of England and the duke of
Burgundy scarcely equalled one third of this German host, (Memoires de
Philippe de Comines, l. iv. c. 2.) At present, six or seven hundred
thousand men are maintained in constant pay and admirable discipline by
the powers of Germany.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[17](daf06027.htm#fr_793.md) It was not till the
year 1444, that France and England could agree on a truce of some
months. (See Rymer's Foedera, and the chronicles of both nations.)

<span id="fn_794"></span>[18](daf06027.htm#fr_794.md) In the Hungarian
crusade, Spondanus (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 1443, 1444) has been my leading
guide. He has diligently read, and critically compared, the Greek and
Turkish materials, the historians of Hungary, Poland, and the West. His
narrative is perspicuous and where he can be free from a religious bias,
the judgment of Spondanus is not contemptible.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[19](daf06027.htm#fr_795.md) I have curtailed the
harsh letter (Wladislaus) which most writers affix to his name, either
in compliance with the Polish pronunciation, or to distinguish him from
his rival the infant Ladislaus of Austria. Their competition for the
crown of Hungary is described by Callimachus, (l. i. ii. p. 447 - 486,)
Bonfinius, (Decad. iii. l. iv.,) Spondanus, and Lenfant.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[20](daf06027.htm#fr_796.md) The Greek historians,
Phranza, Chalcondyles, and Ducas, do not ascribe to their prince a very
active part in this crusade, which he seems to have promoted by his
wishes, and injured by his fears.

<span id="fn_797"></span>[21](daf06027.htm#fr_797) Cantemir (p. 88.md)
ascribes to his policy the original plan, and transcribes his animating
epistle to the king of Hungary. But the Mahometan powers are seldom it
formed of the state of Christendom and the situation and correspondence
of the knights of Rhodes must connect them with the sultan of Caramania.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[22](daf06027.htm#fr_798.md) In their letters to
the emperor Frederic III. the Hungarians slay 80,000 Turks in one
battle; but the modest Julian reduces the slaughter to 6000 or even 2000
infidels, (Aeneas Sylvius in Europ. c. 5, and epist. 44, 81, apud
Spondanum.)

<span id="fn_799"></span>[23](daf06027.htm#fr_799.md) See the origin of the
Turkish war, and the first expedition of Ladislaus, in the vth and vith
books of the iiid decad of Bonfinius, who, in his division and style,
copies Livy with tolerable success Callimachus (l. ii p. 487 - 496) is
still more pure and authentic.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[24](daf06027.htm#fr_800.md) I do not pretend to
warrant the literal accuracy of Julian's speech, which is variously
worded by Callimachus, (l. iii. p. 505 - 507,) Bonfinius, (dec. iii. l.
vi. p. 457, 458,) and other historians, who might indulge their own
eloquence, while they represent one of the orators of the age. But they
all agree in the advice and arguments for perjury, which in the field of
controversy are fiercely attacked by the Protestants, and feebly
defended by the Catholics. The latter are discouraged by the misfortune
of Warna

<span id="fn_801"></span>[25](daf06027.htm#fr_801.md) Warna, under the
Grecian name of Odessus, was a colony of the Milesians, which they
denominated from the hero Ulysses, (Cellarius, tom. i. p. 374.
D'Anville, tom. i. p. 312.) According to Arrian's Periplus of the
Euxine, (p. 24, 25, in the first volume of Hudson's Geographers,) it was
situate 1740 stadia, or furlongs, from the mouth of the Danube, 2140
from Byzantium, and 360 to the north of a ridge of promontory of Mount
Haemus, which advances into the sea.
