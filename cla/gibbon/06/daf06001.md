In a style less grave than that of history, I should perhaps compare the
emperor Alexius  <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) to the jackal, who is
said to follow the steps, and to devour the leavings, of the lion.
Whatever had been his fears and toils in the passage of the first
crusade, they were amply recompensed by the subsequent benefits which he
derived from the exploits of the Franks. His dexterity and vigilance
secured their first conquest of Nice; and from this threatening station
the Turks were compelled to evacuate the neighborhood of Constantinople.
While the crusaders, with blind valor, advanced into the midland
countries of Asia, the crafty Greek improved the favorable occasion when
the emirs of the sea-coast were recalled to the standard of the sultan.
The Turks were driven from the Isles of Rhodes and Chios: the cities of
Ephesu and Smyrna, of Sardes, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, were restored
to the empire, which Alexius enlarged from the Hellespont to the banks
of the Maeander, and the rocky shores of Pamphylia. The churches resumed
their splendor: the towns were rebuilt and fortified; and the desert
country was peopled with colonies of Christians, who were gently removed
from the more distant and dangerous frontier. In these paternal cares,
we may forgive Alexius, if he forgot the deliverance of the holy
sepulchre; but, by the Latins, he was stigmatized with the foul reproach
of treason and desertion. They had sworn fidelity and obedience to his
throne; but he had promised to assist their enterprise in person, or, at
least, with his troops and treasures: his base retreat dissolved their
obligations; and the sword, which had been the instrument of their
victory, was the pledge and title of their just independence. It does
not appear that the emperor attempted to revive his obsolete claims over
the kingdom of Jerusalem;  <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) but the
borders of Cilicia and Syria were more recent in his possession, and
more accessible to his arms. The great army of the crusaders was
annihilated or dispersed; the principality of Antioch was left without a
head, by the surprise and captivity of Bohemond; his ransom had
oppressed him with a heavy debt; and his Norman followers were
insufficient to repel the hostilities of the Greeks and Turks. In this
distress, Bohemond embraced a magnanimous resolution, of leaving the
defence of Antioch to his kinsman, the faithful Tancred; of arming the
West against the Byzantine empire; and of executing the design which he
inherited from the lessons and example of his father Guiscard. His
embarkation was clandestine: and, if we may credit a tale of the
princess Anne, he passed the hostile sea closely secreted in a coffin.
 <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) But his reception in France was
dignified by the public applause, and his marriage with the king's
daughter: his return was glorious, since the bravest spirits of the age
enlisted under his veteran command; and he repassed the Adriatic at the
head of five thousand horse and forty thousand foot, assembled from the
most remote climates of Europe.  <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) The
strength of Durazzo, and prudence of Alexius, the progress of famine and
approach of winter, eluded his ambitious hopes; and the venal
confederates were seduced from his standard. A treaty of peace  <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) suspended the fears of the Greeks; and they
were finally delivered by the death of an adversary, whom neither oaths
could bind, nor dangers could appal, nor prosperity could satiate. His
children succeeded to the principality of Antioch; but the boundaries
were strictly defined, the homage was clearly stipulated, and the cities
of Tarsus and Malmistra were restored to the Byzantine emperors. Of the
coast of Anatolia, they possessed the entire circuit from Trebizond to
the Syrian gates. The Seljukian dynasty of Roum  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) was separated on all sides from the sea and
their Mussulman brethren; the power of the sultan was shaken by the
victories and even the defeats of the Franks; and after the loss of
Nice, they removed their throne to Cogni or Iconium, an obscure and in
land town above three hundred miles from Constantinople.  <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) Instead of trembling for their capital, the
Comnenian princes waged an offensive war against the Turks, and the
first crusade prevented the fall of the declining empire.

In the twelfth century, three great emigrations marched by land from the
West for the relief of Palestine. The soldiers and pilgrims of Lombardy,
France, and Germany were excited by the example and success of the first
crusade.  <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) Forty-eight years after the
deliverance of the holy sepulchre, the emperor, and the French king,
Conrad the Third and Louis the Seventh, undertook the second crusade to
support the falling fortunes of the Latins.  <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) A grand division of the third crusade was
led by the emperor Frederic Barbarossa,  <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) who sympathized with his brothers of France
and England in the common loss of Jerusalem. These three expeditions may
be compared in their resemblance of the greatness of numbers, their
passage through the Greek empire, and the nature and event of their
Turkish warfare, and a brief parallel may save the repetition of a
tedious narrative. However splendid it may seem, a regular story of the
crusades would exhibit the perpetual return of the same causes and
effects; and the frequent attempts for the defence or recovery of the
Holy Land would appear so many faint and unsuccessful copies of the
original.

I. Of the swarms that so closely trod in the footsteps of the first
pilgrims, the chiefs were equal in rank, though unequal in fame and
merit, to Godfrey of Bouillon and his fellow-adventurers. At their head
were displayed the banners of the dukes of Burgundy, Bavaria, and
Aquitain; the first a descendant of Hugh Capet, the second, a father of
the Brunswick line: the archbishop of Milan, a temporal prince,
transported, for the benefit of the Turks, the treasures and ornaments
of his church and palace; and the veteran crusaders, Hugh the Great and
Stephen of Chartres, returned to consummate their unfinished vow. The
huge and disorderly bodies of their followers moved forward in two
columns; and if the first consisted of two hundred and sixty thousand
persons, the second might possibly amount to sixty thousand horse and
one hundred thousand foot.  <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md)  <span
id="fr_11"></span>[\*\_0001](#fn_11.md) The armies of the second crusade
might have claimed the conquest of Asia; the nobles of France and
Germany were animated by the presence of their sovereigns; and both the
rank and personal character of Conrad and Louis gave a dignity to their
cause, and a discipline to their force, which might be vainly expected
from the feudatory chiefs. The cavalry of the emperor, and that of the
king, was each composed of seventy thousand knights, and their immediate
attendants in the field;  <span id="fr_12"></span>[12](#fn_12.md) and if
the light-armed troops, the peasant infantry, the women and children,
the priests and monks, be rigorously excluded, the full account will
scarcely be satisfied with four hundred thousand souls. The West, from
Rome to Britain, was called into action; the kings of Poland and Bohemia
obeyed the summons of Conrad; and it is affirmed by the Greeks and
Latins, that, in the passage of a strait or river, the Byzantine agents,
after a tale of nine hundred thousand, desisted from the endless and
formidable computation.  <span id="fr_13"></span>[13](#fn_13.md) In the
third crusade, as the French and English preferred the navigation of the
Mediterranean, the host of Frederic Barbarossa was less numerous.
Fifteen thousand knights, and as many squires, were the flower of the
German chivalry: sixty thousand horse, and one hundred thousand foot,
were mustered by the emperor in the plains of Hungary; and after such
repetitions, we shall no longer be startled at the six hundred thousand
pilgrims, which credulity has ascribed to this last emigration.  <span
id="fr_14"></span>[14](#fn_14.md) Such extravagant reckonings prove only
the astonishment of contemporaries; but their astonishment most strongly
bears testimony to the existence of an enormous, though indefinite,
multitude. The Greeks might applaud their superior knowledge of the arts
and stratagems of war, but they confessed the strength and courage of
the French cavalry, and the infantry of the Germans;  <span
id="fr_15"></span>[15](#fn_15.md) and the strangers are described as an
iron race, of gigantic stature, who darted fire from their eyes, and
spilt blood like water on the ground. Under the banners of Conrad, a
troop of females rode in the attitude and armor of men; and the chief of
these Amazons, from her gilt spurs and buskins, obtained the epithet of
the Golden- footed Dame.

II\. The number and character of the strangers was an object of terror
to the effeminate Greeks, and the sentiment of fear is nearly allied to
that of hatred. This aversion was suspended or softened by the
apprehension of the Turkish power; and the invectives of the Latins will
not bias our more candid belief, that the emperor Alexius dissembled
their insolence, eluded their hostilities, counselled their rashness,
and opened to their ardor the road of pilgrimage and conquest. But when
the Turks had been driven from Nice and the sea-coast, when the
Byzantine princes no longer dreaded the distant sultans of Cogni, they
felt with purer indignation the free and frequent passage of the western
Barbarians, who violated the majesty, and endangered the safety, of the
empire. The second and third crusades were undertaken under the reign of
Manuel Comnenus and Isaac Angelus. Of the former, the passions were
always impetuous, and often malevolent; and the natural union of a
cowardly and a mischievous temper was exemplified in the latter, who,
without merit or mercy, could punish a tyrant, and occupy his throne. It
was secretly, and perhaps tacitly, resolved by the prince and people to
destroy, or at least to discourage, the pilgrims, by every species of
injury and oppression; and their want of prudence and discipline
continually afforded the pretence or the opportunity. The Western
monarchs had stipulated a safe passage and fair market in the country of
their Christian brethren; the treaty had been ratified by oaths and
hostages; and the poorest soldier of Frederic's army was furnished with
three marks of silver to defray his expenses on the road. But every
engagement was violated by treachery and injustice; and the complaints
of the Latins are attested by the honest confession of a Greek
historian, who has dared to prefer truth to his country.  <span
id="fr_16"></span>[16](#fn_16.md) Instead of a hospitable reception, the
gates of the cities, both in Europe and Asia, were closely barred
against the crusaders; and the scanty pittance of food was let down in
baskets from the walls. Experience or foresight might excuse this timid
jealousy; but the common duties of humanity prohibited the mixture of
chalk, or other poisonous ingredients, in the bread; and should Manuel
be acquitted of any foul connivance, he is guilty of coining base money
for the purpose of trading with the pilgrims. In every step of their
march they were stopped or misled: the governors had private orders to
fortify the passes and break down the bridges against them: the
stragglers were pillaged and murdered: the soldiers and horses were
pierced in the woods by arrows from an invisible hand; the sick were
burnt in their beds; and the dead bodies were hung on gibbets along the
highways. These injuries exasperated the champions of the cross, who
were not endowed with evangelical patience; and the Byzantine princes,
who had provoked the unequal conflict, promoted the embarkation and
march of these formidable guests. On the verge of the Turkish frontier
Barbarossa spared the guilty Philadelphia,  <span
id="fr_17"></span>[17](#fn_17.md) rewarded the hospitable Laodicea, and
deplored the hard necessity that had stained his sword with any drops of
Christian blood. In their intercourse with the monarchs of Germany and
France, the pride of the Greeks was exposed to an anxious trial. They
might boast that on the first interview the seat of Louis was a low
stool, beside the throne of Manuel;  <span
id="fr_18"></span>[18](#fn_18.md) but no sooner had the French king
transported his army beyond the Bosphorus, than he refused the offer of
a second conference, unless his brother would meet him on equal terms,
either on the sea or land. With Conrad and Frederic, the ceremonial was
still nicer and more difficult: like the successors of Constantine, they
styled themselves emperors of the Romans;  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[19](#fn_19.md) and firmly maintained the purity of their
title and dignity. The first of these representatives of Charlemagne
would only converse with Manuel on horseback in the open field; the
second, by passing the Hellespont rather than the Bosphorus, declined
the view of Constantinople and its sovereign. An emperor, who had been
crowned at Rome, was reduced in the Greek epistles to the humble
appellation of Rex, or prince, of the Alemanni; and the vain and feeble
Angelus affected to be ignorant of the name of one of the greatest men
and monarchs of the age. While they viewed with hatred and suspicion the
Latin pilgrims the Greek emperors maintained a strict, though secret,
alliance with the Turks and Saracens. Isaac Angelus complained, that by
his friendship for the great Saladin he had incurred the enmity of the
Franks; and a mosque was founded at Constantinople for the public
exercise of the religion of Mahomet.  <span
id="fr_20"></span>[20](#fn_20.md)

III\. The swarms that followed the first crusade were destroyed in
Anatolia by famine, pestilence, and the Turkish arrows; and the princes
only escaped with some squadrons of horse to accomplish their lamentable
pilgrimage. A just opinion may be formed of their knowledge and
humanity; of their knowledge, from the design of subduing Persia and
Chorasan in their way to Jerusalem;  <span
id="fr_21"></span>[\*\_0002](#fn_21.md) of their humanity, from the
massacre of the Christian people, a friendly city, who came out to meet
them with palms and crosses in their hands. The arms of Conrad and Louis
were less cruel and imprudent; but the event of the second crusade was
still more ruinous to Christendom; and the Greek Manuel is accused by
his own subjects of giving seasonable intelligence to the sultan, and
treacherous guides to the Latin princes. Instead of crushing the common
foe, by a double attack at the same time but on different sides, the
Germans were urged by emulation, and the French were retarded by
jealousy. Louis had scarcely passed the Bosphorus when he was met by the
returning emperor, who had lost the greater part of his army in
glorious, but unsuccessful, actions on the banks of the Maender. The
contrast of the pomp of his rival hastened the retreat of Conrad:  <span
id="fr_22"></span>[!\_0002](#fn_22.md) the desertion of his independent
vassals reduced him to his hereditary troops; and he borrowed some Greek
vessels to execute by sea the pilgrimage of Palestine. Without studying
the lessons of experience, or the nature of the war, the king of France
advanced through the same country to a similar fate. The vanguard, which
bore the royal banner and the oriflamme of St. Denys,  <span
id="fr_23"></span>[21](#fn_23.md) had doubled their march with rash and
inconsiderate speed; and the rear, which the king commanded in person,
no longer found their companions in the evening camp. In darkness and
disorder, they were encompassed, assaulted, and overwhelmed, by the
innumerable host of Turks, who, in the art of war, were superior to the
Christians of the twelfth century.  <span
id="fr_24"></span>[\*\*\_0002](#fn_24.md) Louis, who climbed a tree in the
general discomfiture, was saved by his own valor and the ignorance of
his adversaries; and with the dawn of day he escaped alive, but almost
alone, to the camp of the vanguard. But instead of pursuing his
expedition by land, he was rejoiced to shelter the relics of his army in
the friendly seaport of Satalia. From thence he embarked for Antioch;
but so penurious was the supply of Greek vessels, that they could only
afford room for his knights and nobles; and the plebeian crowd of
infantry was left to perish at the foot of the Pamphylian hills. The
emperor and the king embraced and wept at Jerusalem; their martial
trains, the remnant of mighty armies, were joined to the Christian
powers of Syria, and a fruitless siege of Damascus was the final effort
of the second crusade. Conrad and Louis embarked for Europe with the
personal fame of piety and courage; but the Orientals had braved these
potent monarchs of the Franks, with whose names and military forces they
had been so often threatened.  <span id="fr_25"></span>[22](#fn_25.md)
Perhaps they had still more to fear from the veteran genius of Frederic
the First, who in his youth had served in Asia under his uncle Conrad.
Forty campaigns in Germany and Italy had taught Barbarossa to command;
and his soldiers, even the princes of the empire, were accustomed under
his reign to obey. As soon as he lost sight of Philadelphia and
Laodicea, the last cities of the Greek frontier, he plunged into the
salt and barren desert, a land (says the historian) of horror and
tribulation.  <span id="fr_26"></span>[23](#fn_26.md) During twenty days,
every step of his fainting and sickly march was besieged by the
innumerable hordes of Turkmans,  <span id="fr_27"></span>[24](#fn_27.md)
whose numbers and fury seemed after each defeat to multiply and inflame.
The emperor continued to struggle and to suffer; and such was the
measure of his calamities, that when he reached the gates of Iconium, no
more than one thousand knights were able to serve on horseback. By a
sudden and resolute assault he defeated the guards, and stormed the
capital of the sultan,  <span id="fr_28"></span>[25](#fn_28.md) who humbly
sued for pardon and peace. The road was now open, and Frederic advanced
in a career of triumph, till he was unfortunately drowned in a petty
torrent of Cilicia.  <span id="fr_29"></span>[26](#fn_29.md) The remainder
of his Germans was consumed by sickness and desertion: and the emperor's
son expired with the greatest part of his Swabian vassals at the siege
of Acre. Among the Latin heroes, Godfrey of Bouillon and Frederic
Barbarossa could alone achieve the passage of the Lesser Asia; yet even
their success was a warning; and in the last and most experienced age of
the crusades, every nation preferred the sea to the toils and perils of
an inland expedition.  <span id="fr_30"></span>[27](#fn_30.md)

The enthusiasm of the first crusade is a natural and simple event, while
hope was fresh, danger untried, and enterprise congenial to the spirit
of the times. But the obstinate perseverance of Europe may indeed excite
our pity and admiration; that no instruction should have been drawn from
constant and adverse experience; that the same confidence should have
repeatedly grown from the same failures; that six succeeding generations
should have rushed headlong down the precipice that was open before
them; and that men of every condition should have staked their public
and private fortunes on the desperate adventure of possessing or
recovering a tombstone two thousand miles from their country. In a
period of two centuries after the council of Clermont, each spring and
summer produced a new emigration of pilgrim warriors for the defence of
the Holy Land; but the seven great armaments or crusades were excited by
some impending or recent calamity: the nations were moved by the
authority of their pontiffs, and the example of their kings: their zeal
was kindled, and their reason was silenced, by the voice of their holy
orators; and among these, Bernard,  <span id="fr_31"></span>[28](#fn_31.md)
the monk, or the saint, may claim the most honorable place.  <span
id="fr_32"></span>[\*\_0003](#fn_32.md) About eight years before the first
conquest of Jerusalem, he was born of a noble family in Burgundy; at the
age of three- and-twenty he buried himself in the monastery of Citeaux,
then in the primitive fervor of the institution; at the end of two years
he led forth her third colony, or daughter, to the valley of Clairvaux
 <span id="fr_33"></span>[29](#fn_33.md) in Champagne; and was content,
till the hour of his death, with the humble station of abbot of his own
community. A philosophic age has abolished, with too liberal and
indiscriminate disdain, the honors of these spiritual heroes. The
meanest among them are distinguished by some energies of the mind; they
were at least superior to their votaries and disciples; and, in the race
of superstition, they attained the prize for which such numbers
contended. In speech, in writing, in action, Bernard stood high above
his rivals and contemporaries; his compositions are not devoid of wit
and eloquence; and he seems to have preserved as much reason and
humanity as may be reconciled with the character of a saint. In a
secular life, he would have shared the seventh part of a private
inheritance; by a vow of poverty and penance, by closing his eyes
against the visible world,  <span id="fr_34"></span>[30](#fn_34.md) by the
refusal of all ecclesiastical dignities, the abbot of Clairvaux became
the oracle of Europe, and the founder of one hundred and sixty convents.
Princes and pontiffs trembled at the freedom of his apostolical
censures: France, England, and Milan, consulted and obeyed his judgment
in a schism of the church: the debt was repaid by the gratitude of
Innocent the Second; and his successor, Eugenius the Third, was the
friend and disciple of the holy Bernard. It was in the proclamation of
the second crusade that he shone as the missionary and prophet of God,
who called the nations to the defence of his holy sepulchre.  <span
id="fr_35"></span>[31](#fn_35.md) At the parliament of Vezelay he spoke
before the king; and Louis the Seventh, with his nobles, received their
crosses from his hand. The abbot of Clairvaux then marched to the less
easy conquest of the emperor Conrad:  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[\*\*\_0003](#fn_36.md) a phlegmatic people, ignorant of
his language, was transported by the pathetic vehemence of his tone and
gestures; and his progress, from Constance to Cologne, was the triumph
of eloquence and zeal. Bernard applauds his own success in the
depopulation of Europe; affirms that cities and castles were emptied of
their inhabitants; and computes, that only one man was left behind for
the consolation of seven widows.  <span id="fr_37"></span>[32](#fn_37.md)
The blind fanatics were desirous of electing him for their general; but
the example of the hermit Peter was before his eyes; and while he
assured the crusaders of the divine favor, he prudently declined a
military command, in which failure and victory would have been almost
equally disgraceful to his character.  <span
id="fr_38"></span>[33](#fn_38.md) Yet, after the calamitous event, the
abbot of Clairvaux was loudly accused as a false prophet, the author of
the public and private mourning; his enemies exulted, his friends
blushed, and his apology was slow and unsatisfactory. He justifies his
obedience to the commands of the pope; expatiates on the mysterious ways
of Providence; imputes the misfortunes of the pilgrims to their own
sins; and modestly insinuates, that his mission had been approved by
signs and wonders.  <span id="fr_39"></span>[34](#fn_39.md) Had the fact
been certain, the argument would be decisive; and his faithful
disciples, who enumerate twenty or thirty miracles in a day, appeal to
the public assemblies of France and Germany, in which they were
performed.  <span id="fr_40"></span>[35](#fn_40.md) At the present hour,
such prodigies will not obtain credit beyond the precincts of Clairvaux;
but in the preternatural cures of the blind, the lame, and the sick, who
were presented to the man of God, it is impossible for us to ascertain
the separate shares of accident, of fancy, of imposture, and of fiction.

Omnipotence itself cannot escape the murmurs of its discordant votaries;
since the same dispensation which was applauded as a deliverance in
Europe, was deplored, and perhaps arraigned, as a calamity in Asia.
After the loss of Jerusalem, the Syrian fugitives diffused their
consternation and sorrow; Bagdad mourned in the dust; the cadhi
Zeineddin of Damascus tore his beard in the caliph's presence; and the
whole divan shed tears at his melancholy tale.  <span
id="fr_41"></span>[36](#fn_41.md) But the commanders of the faithful could
only weep; they were themselves captives in the hands of the Turks: some
temporal power was restored to the last age of the Abbassides; but their
humble ambition was confined to Bagdad and the adjacent province. Their
tyrants, the Seljukian sultans, had followed the common law of the
Asiatic dynasties, the unceasing round of valor, greatness, discord,
degeneracy, and decay; their spirit and power were unequal to the
defence of religion; and, in his distant realm of Persia, the Christians
were strangers to the name and the arms of Sangiar, the last hero of his
race.  <span id="fr_42"></span>[37](#fn_42.md) While the sultans were
involved in the silken web of the harem, the pious task was undertaken
by their slaves, the Atabeks,  <span id="fr_43"></span>[38](#fn_43.md) a
Turkish name, which, like the Byzantine patricians, may be translated by
Father of the Prince. Ascansar, a valiant Turk, had been the favorite of
Malek Shaw, from whom he received the privilege of standing on the right
hand of the throne; but, in the civil wars that ensued on the monarch's
death, he lost his head and the government of Aleppo. His domestic emirs
persevered in their attachment to his son Zenghi, who proved his first
arms against the Franks in the defeat of Antioch: thirty campaigns in
the service of the caliph and sultan established his military fame; and
he was invested with the command of Mosul, as the only champion that
could avenge the cause of the prophet. The public hope was not
disappointed: after a siege of twenty-five days, he stormed the city of
Edessa, and recovered from the Franks their conquests beyond the
Euphrates:  <span id="fr_44"></span>[39](#fn_44.md) the martial tribes of
Curdistan were subdued by the independent sovereign of Mosul and Aleppo:
his soldiers were taught to behold the camp as their only country; they
trusted to his liberality for their rewards; and their absent families
were protected by the vigilance of Zenghi. At the head of these
veterans, his son Noureddin gradually united the Mahometan powers;
 <span id="fr_45"></span>[\*\_0004](#fn_45.md) added the kingdom of
Damascus to that of Aleppo, and waged a long and successful war against
the Christians of Syria; he spread his ample reign from the Tigris to
the Nile, and the Abbassides rewarded their faithful servant with all
the titles and prerogatives of royalty. The Latins themselves were
compelled to own the wisdom and courage, and even the justice and piety,
of this implacable adversary.  <span id="fr_46"></span>[40](#fn_46.md) In
his life and government the holy warrior revived the zeal and simplicity
of the first caliphs. Gold and silk were banished from his palace; the
use of wine from his dominions; the public revenue was scrupulously
applied to the public service; and the frugal household of Noureddin was
maintained from his legitimate share of the spoil which he vested in the
purchase of a private estate. His favorite sultana sighed for some
female object of expense. "Alas," replied the king, "I fear God, and am
no more than the treasurer of the Moslems. Their property I cannot
alienate; but I still possess three shops in the city of Hems: these you
may take; and these alone can I bestow." His chamber of justice was the
terror of the great and the refuge of the poor. Some years after the
sultan's death, an oppressed subject called aloud in the streets of
Damascus, "O Noureddin, Noureddin, where art thou now? Arise, arise, to
pity and protect us!" A tumult was apprehended, and a living tyrant
blushed or trembled at the name of a departed monarch.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[1](daf06001.htm#fr_0.md) Anna Comnena relates her
father's conquests in Asia Minor Alexiad, l. xi. p. 321 - 325, l. xiv.
p. 419; his Cilician war against Tancred and Bohemond, p. 328 - 324; the
war of Epirus, with tedious prolixity, l. xii. xiii. p. 345 - 406; the
death of Bohemond, l. xiv. p. 419.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[2](daf06001.htm#fr_1.md) The kings of Jerusalem
submitted, however, to a nominal dependence, and in the dates of their
inscriptions, (one is still legible in the church of Bethlem,) they
respectfully placed before their own the name of the reigning emperor,
(Ducange, Dissertations sur Joinville xxvii. p. 319.)

<span id="fn_2"></span>[3](daf06001.htm#fr_2.md) Anna Comnena adds, that,
to complete the imitation, he was shut up with a dead cock; and
condescends to wonder how the Barbarian could endure the confinement and
putrefaction. This absurd tale is unknown to the Latins. Note: The Greek
writers, in general, Zonaras, p. 2, 303, and Glycas, p. 334 agree in
this story with the princess Anne, except in the absurd addition of the
dead cock. Ducange has already quoted some instances where a similar
stratagem had been adopted by Norman princes. On this authority Wilker
inclines to believe the fact. Appendix to vol. ii. p. 14. - M.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[4](daf06001.htm#fr_3.md) In the Byzantine
geography, must mean England; yet we are more credibly informed, that
our Henry I. would not suffer him to levy any troops in his kingdom,
(Ducange, Not. ad Alexiad. p. 41.)

<span id="fn_4"></span>[5](daf06001.htm#fr_4.md) The copy of the treaty
(Alexiad. l. xiii. p. 406 - 416) is an original and curious piece, which
would require, and might afford, a good map of the principality of
Antioch.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[6](daf06001.htm#fr_5.md) See, in the learned work
of M. De Guignes, (tom. ii. part ii.,) the history of the Seljukians of
Iconium, Aleppo, and Damascus, as far as it may be collected from the
Greeks, Latins, and Arabians. The last are ignorant or regardless of the
affairs of Roum.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[7](daf06001.htm#fr_6.md) Iconium is mentioned as a
station by Xenophon, and by Strabo, with an ambiguous title, (Cellarius,
tom. ii. p. 121.) Yet St. Paul found in that place a multitude of Jews
and Gentiles. under the corrupt name of Kunijah, it is described as a
great city, with a river and garden, three leagues from the mountains,
and decorated (I know not why) with Plato's tomb, (Abulfeda, tabul.
xvii. p. 303 vers. Reiske; and the Index Geographicus of Schulrens from
Ibn Said.)

first crusade, see Anna Comnena, Alexias, l. xi. p. 331, &c., and the

Conrad III. and Louis VII., see William of Tyre, (l. xvi. c. 18 - 19,)

<span id="fn_9"></span>[10](daf06001.htm#fr_9.md) For the third crusade, of
Frederic Barbarossa, see Nicetas in Isaac Angel. l. ii. c. 3 - 8, p. 257
- 266. Struv. (Corpus. Hist. Germ. p. 414,) and two historians, who
probably were spectators, Tagino, (in Scriptor. Freher. tom. i. p. 406 -
416, edit Struv.,) and the Anonymus de Expeditione Asiatica Fred. I. (in
Canisii Antiq. Lection. tom. iii. p. ii. p. 498 - 526, edit. Basnage.)

<span id="fn_10"></span>[11](daf06001.htm#fr_10.md) Anne, who states these
later swarms at 40,000 horse and 100,000 foot, calls them Normans, and
places at their head two brothers of Flanders. The Greeks were strangely
ignorant of the names, families, and possessions of the Latin princes.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[\*\_0001](daf06001.htm#fr_11.md) It was this army
of pilgrims, the first body of which was headed by the archbishop of
Milan and Count Albert of Blandras, which set forth on the wild, yet,
with a more disciplined army, not impolitic, enterprise of striking at
the heart of the Mahometan power, by attacking the sultan in Bagdad. For
their adventures and fate, see Wilken, vol. ii. p. 120, &c., Wichaud,
book iv. - M.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[12](daf06001.htm#fr_12.md) William of Tyre, and
Matthew Paris, reckon 70,000 loricati in each of the armies.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[13](daf06001.htm#fr_13.md) The imperfect
enumeration is mentioned by Cinnamus, and confirmed by Odo de Diogilo
apud Ducange ad Cinnamum, with the more precise sum of 900,556. Why must
therefore the version and comment suppose the modest and insufficient
reckoning of 90,000? Does not Godfrey of Viterbo (Pantheon, p. xix. in
Muratori, tom. vii. p. 462) exclaim?

\- Numerum si poscere quaeras, Millia millena militis agmen erat.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[14](daf06001.htm#fr_14.md) This extravagant
account is given by Albert of Stade, (apud Struvium, p. 414;) my
calculation is borrowed from Godfrey of Viterbo, Arnold of Lubeck, apud
eundem, and Bernard Thesaur. (c. 169, p. 804.) The original writers are
silent. The Mahometans gave him 200,000, or 260,000, men, (Bohadin, in
Vit. Saladin, p. 110.)

<span id="fn_15"></span>[15](daf06001.htm#fr_15.md) I must observe, that,
in the second and third crusades, the subjects of Conrad and Frederic
are styled by the Greeks and Orientals Alamanni. The Lechi and Tzechi of
Cinnamus are the Poles and Bohemians; and it is for the French that he
reserves the ancient appellation of Germans. Note: He names both - M.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[16](daf06001.htm#fr_16.md) Nicetas was a child at
the second crusade, but in the third he commanded against the Franks the
important post of Philippopolis. Cinnamus is infected with national
prejudice and pride.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[17](daf06001.htm#fr_17.md) The conduct of the
Philadelphians is blamed by Nicetas, while the anonymous German accuses
the rudeness of his countrymen, (culpa nostra.) History would be
pleasant, if we were embarrassed only by such contradictions. It is
likewise from Nicetas, that we learn the pious and humane sorrow of
Frederic.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[18](daf06001.htm#fr_18.md) Cinnamus translates
into Latin. Ducange works very hard to save his king and country from
such ignominy, (sur Joinville, dissertat. xxvii. p. 317 - 320.) Louis
afterwards insisted on a meeting in mari ex aequo, not ex equo,
according to the laughable readings of some MSS.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[19](daf06001.htm#fr_19.md) Ego Romanorum imperator
sum, ille Romaniorum, (Anonym Canis. p. 512.)

<span id="fn_20"></span>[20](daf06001.htm#fr_20.md) In the Epistles of
Innocent III., (xiii. p. 184,) and the History of Bohadin, (p. 129,
130,) see the views of a pope and a cadhi on this singular toleration.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[\*\_0002](daf06001.htm#fr_21.md) This was the
design of the pilgrims under the archbishop of Milan. See note, p. 102.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[!\_0002](daf06001.htm#fr_22.md) Conrad had
advanced with part of his army along a central road, between that on the
coast and that which led to Iconium. He had been betrayed by the Greeks,
his army destroyed without a battle. Wilken, vol. iii. p. 165. Michaud,
vol. ii. p. 156. Conrad advanced again with Louis as far as Ephesus, and
from thence, at the invitation of Manuel, returned to Constantinople. It
was Louis who, at the passage of the Maeandes, was engaged in a
"glorious action." Wilken, vol. iii. p. 179. Michaud vol. ii. p. 160.
Gibbon followed Nicetas. - M.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[21](daf06001.htm#fr_23.md) As counts of Vexin, the
kings of France were the vassals and advocates of the monastery of St.
Denys. The saint's peculiar banner, which they received from the abbot,
was of a square form, and a red or flaming color. The oriflamme appeared
at the head of the French armies from the xiith to the xvth century,
(Ducange sur Joinville, Dissert. xviii. p. 244 - 253.)

<span id="fn_24"></span>[\*\*\_0002](daf06001.htm#fr_24.md) They descended
the heights to a beautiful valley which by beneath them. The Turks
seized the heights which separated the two divisions of the army. The
modern historians represent differently the act to which Louis owed his
safety, which Gibbon has described by the undignified phrase, "he
climbed a tree." According to Michaud, vol. ii. p. 164, the king got
upon a rock, with his back against a tree; according to Wilken, vol.
iii., he dragged himself up to the top of the rock by the roots of a
tree, and continued to defend himself till nightfall. - M.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[22](daf06001.htm#fr_25.md) The original French
histories of the second crusade are the Gesta Ludovici VII. published in
the ivth volume of Duchesne's collection. The same volume contains many
original letters of the king, of Suger his minister, &c., the best
documents of authentic history.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[25](daf06001.htm#fr_28.md) See, in the anonymous
writer in the Collection of Canisius, Tagino and Bohadin, (Vit. Saladin.
p. 119, 120,) the ambiguous conduct of Kilidge Arslan, sultan of Cogni,
who hated and feared both Saladin and Frederic.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[26](daf06001.htm#fr_29.md) The desire of comparing
two great men has tempted many writers to drown Frederic in the River
Cydnus, in which Alexander so imprudently bathed, (Q. Curt. l. iii c. 4,
5.) But, from the march of the emperor, I rather judge, that his Saleph
is the Calycadnus, a stream of less fame, but of a longer course.

Note: It is now called the Girama: its course is described in M'Donald
Kinneir's Travels. - M.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[27](daf06001.htm#fr_30.md) Marinus Sanutus, A.D.
1321, lays it down as a precept, Quod stolus ecclesiae per terram
nullatenus est ducenda. He resolves, by the divine aid, the objection,
or rather exception, of the first crusade, (Secreta Fidelium Crucis, l.
ii. pars ii. c. i. p. 37.)

<span id="fn_31"></span>[28](daf06001.htm#fr_31.md) The most authentic
information of St. Bernard must be drawn from his own writings,
published in a correct edition by Pere Mabillon, and reprinted at
Venice, 1750, in six volumes in folio. Whatever friendship could
recollect, or superstition could add, is contained in the two lives, by
his disciples, in the vith volume: whatever learning and criticism could
ascertain, may be found in the prefaces of the Benedictine editor

<span id="fn_32"></span>[\*\_0003](daf06001.htm#fr_32.md) Gibbon, whose
account of the crusades is perhaps the least accurate and satisfactory
chapter in his History, has here failed in that lucid arrangement, which
in general gives perspicuity to his most condensed and crowded
narratives. He has unaccountably, and to the great perplexity of the
reader, placed the preaching of St Bernard after the second crusade to
which i led. - M.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[29](daf06001.htm#fr_33.md) Clairvaux, surnamed the
valley of Absynth, is situate among the woods near Bar sur Aube in
Champagne. St. Bernard would blush at the pomp of the church and
monastery; he would ask for the library, and I know not whether he would
be much edified by a tun of 800 muids, (914 1-7 hogsheads,) which almost
rivals that of Heidelberg, (Melanges tires d'une Grande Bibliotheque,
tom. xlvi. p. 15 - 20.)

<span id="fn_34"></span>[30](daf06001.htm#fr_34.md) The disciples of the
saint (Vit. ima, l. iii. c. 2, p. 1232. Vit. iida, c. 16, No. 45, p.
1383) record a marvellous example of his pious apathy. Juxta lacum etiam
Lausannensem totius diei itinere pergens, penitus non attendit aut se
videre non vidit. Cum enim vespere facto de eodem lacu socii
colloquerentur, interrogabat eos ubi lacus ille esset, et mirati sunt
universi. To admire or despise St. Bernard as he ought, the reader, like
myself, should have before the windows of his library the beauties of
that incomparable landscape.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[\*\*\_0003](daf06001.htm#fr_36.md) Bernard had a
nobler object in his expedition into Germany - to arrest the fierce and
merciless persecution of the Jews, which was preparing, under the monk
Radulph, to renew the frightful scenes which had preceded the first
crusade, in the flourishing cities on the banks of the Rhine. The Jews
acknowledge the Christian intervention of St. Bernard. See the curious
extract from the History of Joseph ben Meir. Wilken, vol. iii. p. 1. and
p. 63 - M

230 - 261. Such was his valor, that he was styled the second Alexander;
and such the extravagant love of his subjects, that they prayed for the
sultan a year after his decease. Yet Sangiar might have been made
prisoner by the Franks, as well as by the Uzes. He reigned near fifty
years, (A.D. 1103 - 1152,) and was a munificent patron of Persian
poetry.

The corruption of his name into Sanguin, afforded the Latins a

<span id="fn_46"></span>[40](daf06001.htm#fr_46.md) Noradinus (says William
of Tyre, l. xx. 33) maximus nominis et fidei Christianae persecutor;
princeps tamen justus, vafer, providus' et secundum gentis suae
traditiones religiosus. To this Catholic witness we may add the primate
of the Jacobites, (Abulpharag. p. 267,) quo non alter erat inter reges
vitae ratione magis laudabili, aut quae pluribus justitiae experimentis
abundaret. The true praise of kings is after their death, and from the
mouth of their enemies.
