In the apprehension of modern times, Petrarch  <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1](#fn_1059.md) is the Italian songster of Laura and
love. In the harmony of his Tuscan rhymes, Italy applauds, or rather
adores, the father of her lyric poetry; and his verse, or at least his
name, is repeated by the enthusiasm, or affectation, of amorous
sensibility. Whatever may be the private taste of a stranger, his slight
and superficial knowledge should humbly acquiesce in the judgment of a
learned nation; yet I may hope or presume, that the Italians do not
compare the tedious uniformity of sonnets and elegies with the sublime
compositions of their epic muse, the original wildness of Dante, the
regular beauties of Tasso, and the boundless variety of the incomparable
Ariosto. The merits of the lover I am still less qualified to
appreciate: nor am I deeply interested in a metaphysical passion for a
nymph so shadowy, that her existence has been questioned;  <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[2](#fn_1060.md) for a matron so prolific,  <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[3](#fn_1061.md) that she was delivered of eleven
legitimate children,  <span id="fr_1062"></span>[4](#fn_1062.md) while her
amorous swain sighed and sung at the fountain of Vaucluse.  <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[5](#fn_1063.md) But in the eyes of Petrarch, and those
of his graver contemporaries, his love was a sin, and Italian verse a
frivolous amusement. His Latin works of philosophy, poetry, and
eloquence, established his serious reputation, which was soon diffused
from Avignon over France and Italy: his friends and disciples were
multiplied in every city; and if the ponderous volume of his writings
 <span id="fr_1064"></span>[6](#fn_1064.md) be now abandoned to a long
repose, our gratitude must applaud the man, who by precept and example
revived the spirit and study of the Augustan age. From his earliest
youth, Petrarch aspired to the poetic crown. The academical honors of
the three faculties had introduced a royal degree of master or doctor in
the art of poetry;  <span id="fr_1065"></span>[7](#fn_1065.md) and the
title of poet- laureate, which custom, rather than vanity, perpetuates
in the English court,  <span id="fr_1066"></span>[8](#fn_1066.md) was first
invented by the Caesars of Germany. In the musical games of antiquity, a
prize was bestowed on the victor:  <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[9](#fn_1067.md) the belief that Virgil and Horace had
been crowned in the Capitol inflamed the emulation of a Latin bard;
 <span id="fr_1068"></span>[10](#fn_1068.md) and the laurel  <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[11](#fn_1069.md) was endeared to the lover by a verbal
resemblance with the name of his mistress. The value of either object
was enhanced by the difficulties of the pursuit; and if the virtue or
prudence of Laura was inexorable,  <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[12](#fn_1070.md) he enjoyed, and might boast of
enjoying, the nymph of poetry. His vanity was not of the most delicate
kind, since he applauds the success of his own labors; his name was
popular; his friends were active; the open or secret opposition of envy
and prejudice was surmounted by the dexterity of patient merit. In the
thirty-sixth year of his age, he was solicited to accept the object of
his wishes; and on the same day, in the solitude of Vaucluse, he
received a similar and solemn invitation from the senate of Rome and the
university of Paris. The learning of a theological school, and the
ignorance of a lawless city, were alike unqualified to bestow the ideal
though immortal wreath which genius may obtain from the free applause of
the public and of posterity: but the candidate dismissed this
troublesome reflection; and after some moments of complacency and
suspense, preferred the summons of the metropolis of the world.

The ceremony of his coronation  <span id="fr_1071"></span>[13](#fn_1071.md)
was performed in the Capitol, by his friend and patron the supreme
magistrate of the republic. Twelve patrician youths were arrayed in
scarlet; six representatives of the most illustrious families, in green
robes, with garlands of flowers, accompanied the procession; in the
midst of the princes and nobles, the senator, count of Anguillara, a
kinsman of the Colonna, assumed his throne; and at the voice of a herald
Petrarch arose. After discoursing on a text of Virgil, and thrice
repeating his vows for the prosperity of Rome, he knelt before the
throne, and received from the senator a laurel crown, with a more
precious declaration, "This is the reward of merit." The people shouted,
"Long life to the Capitol and the poet!" A sonnet in praise of Rome was
accepted as the effusion of genius and gratitude; and after the whole
procession had visited the Vatican, the profane wreath was suspended
before the shrine of St. Peter. In the act or diploma  <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[14](#fn_1072.md) which was presented to Petrarch, the
title and prerogatives of poet-laureate are revived in the Capitol,
after the lapse of thirteen hundred years; and he receives the perpetual
privilege of wearing, at his choice, a crown of laurel, ivy, or myrtle,
of assuming the poetic habit, and of teaching, disputing, interpreting,
and composing, in all places whatsoever, and on all subjects of
literature. The grant was ratified by the authority of the senate and
people; and the character of citizen was the recompense of his affection
for the Roman name. They did him honor, but they did him justice. In the
familiar society of Cicero and Livy, he had imbibed the ideas of an
ancient patriot; and his ardent fancy kindled every idea to a sentiment,
and every sentiment to a passion. The aspect of the seven hills and
their majestic ruins confirmed these lively impressions; and he loved a
country by whose liberal spirit he had been crowned and adopted. The
poverty and debasement of Rome excited the indignation and pity of her
grateful son; he dissembled the faults of his fellow-citizens; applauded
with partial fondness the last of their heroes and matrons; and in the
remembrance of the past, in the hopes of the future, was pleased to
forget the miseries of the present time. Rome was still the lawful
mistress of the world: the pope and the emperor, the bishop and general,
had abdicated their station by an inglorious retreat to the Rhone and
the Danube; but if she could resume her virtue, the republic might again
vindicate her liberty and dominion. Amidst the indulgence of enthusiasm
and eloquence,  <span id="fr_1073"></span>[15](#fn_1073.md) Petrarch,
Italy, and Europe, were astonished by a revolution which realized for a
moment his most splendid visions. The rise and fall of the tribune
Rienzi will occupy the following pages:  <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[16](#fn_1074.md) the subject is interesting, the
materials are rich, and the glance of a patriot bard  <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[17](#fn_1075.md) will sometimes vivify the copious,
but simple, narrative of the Florentine,  <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[18](#fn_1076.md) and more especially of the Roman,
historian.  <span id="fr_1077"></span>[19](#fn_1077.md)

In a quarter of the city which was inhabited only by mechanics and Jews,
the marriage of an innkeeper and a washer woman produced the future
deliverer of Rome.  <span id="fr_1078"></span>[20](#fn_1078.md)  <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[!\_0067](#fn_1079.md) From such parents Nicholas
Rienzi Gabrini could inherit neither dignity nor fortune; and the gift
of a liberal education, which they painfully bestowed, was the cause of
his glory and untimely end. The study of history and eloquence, the
writings of Cicero, Seneca, Livy, Caesar, and Valerius Maximus, elevated
above his equals and contemporaries the genius of the young plebeian: he
perused with indefatigable diligence the manuscripts and marbles of
antiquity; loved to dispense his knowledge in familiar language; and was
often provoked to exclaim, "Where are now these Romans? their virtue,
their justice, their power? why was I not born in those happy times?"
 <span id="fr_1080"></span>[21](#fn_1080.md) When the republic addressed to
the throne of Avignon an embassy of the three orders, the spirit and
eloquence of Rienzi recommended him to a place among the thirteen
deputies of the commons. The orator had the honor of haranguing Pope
Clement the Sixth, and the satisfaction of conversing with Petrarch, a
congenial mind: but his aspiring hopes were chilled by disgrace and
poverty and the patriot was reduced to a single garment and the charity
of the hospital.  <span id="fr_1081"></span>[\*\_0067](#fn_1081.md) From
this misery he was relieved by the sense of merit or the smile of favor;
and the employment of apostolic notary afforded him a daily stipend of
five gold florins, a more honorable and extensive connection, and the
right of contrasting, both in words and actions, his own integrity with
the vices of the state. The eloquence of Rienzi was prompt and
persuasive: the multitude is always prone to envy and censure: he was
stimulated by the loss of a brother and the impunity of the assassins;
nor was it possible to excuse or exaggerate the public calamities. The
blessings of peace and justice, for which civil society has been
instituted, were banished from Rome: the jealous citizens, who might
have endured every personal or pecuniary injury, were most deeply
wounded in the dishonor of their wives and daughters:  <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[22](#fn_1082.md) they were equally oppressed by the
arrogance of the nobles and the corruption of the magistrates;  <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[!!\_0067](#fn_1083.md) and the abuse of arms or of
laws was the only circumstance that distinguished the lions from the
dogs and serpents of the Capitol. These allegorical emblems were
variously repeated in the pictures which Rienzi exhibited in the streets
and churches; and while the spectators gazed with curious wonder, the
bold and ready orator unfolded the meaning, applied the satire, inflamed
their passions, and announced a distant hope of comfort and deliverance.
The privileges of Rome, her eternal sovereignty over her princes and
provinces, was the theme of his public and private discourse; and a
monument of servitude became in his hands a title and incentive of
liberty. The decree of the senate, which granted the most ample
prerogatives to the emperor Vespasian, had been inscribed on a copper
plate still extant in the choir of the church of St. John Lateran.
 <span id="fr_1084"></span>[23](#fn_1084.md) A numerous assembly of nobles
and plebeians was invited to this political lecture, and a convenient
theatre was erected for their reception. The notary appeared in a
magnificent and mysterious habit, explained the inscription by a version
and commentary,  <span id="fr_1085"></span>[24](#fn_1085.md) and descanted
with eloquence and zeal on the ancient glories of the senate and people,
from whom all legal authority was derived. The supine ignorance of the
nobles was incapable of discerning the serious tendency of such
representations: they might sometimes chastise with words and blows the
plebeian reformer; but he was often suffered in the Colonna palace to
amuse the company with his threats and predictions; and the modern
Brutus  <span id="fr_1086"></span>[25](#fn_1086.md) was concealed under the
mask of folly and the character of a buffoon. While they indulged their
contempt, the restoration of the good estate, his favorite expression,
was entertained among the people as a desirable, a possible, and at
length as an approaching, event; and while all had the disposition to
applaud, some had the courage to assist, their promised deliverer.

A prophecy, or rather a summons, affixed on the church door of St.
George, was the first public evidence of his designs; a nocturnal
assembly of a hundred citizens on Mount Aventine, the first step to
their execution. After an oath of secrecy and aid, he represented to the
conspirators the importance and facility of their enterprise; that the
nobles, without union or resources, were strong only in the fear nobles,
of their imaginary strength; that all power, as well as right, was in
the hands of the people; that the revenues of the apostolical chamber
might relieve the public distress; and that the pope himself would
approve their victory over the common enemies of government and freedom.
After securing a faithful band to protect his first declaration, he
proclaimed through the city, by sound of trumpet, that on the evening of
the following day, all persons should assemble without arms before the
church of St. Angelo, to provide for the reestablishment of the good
estate. The whole night was employed in the celebration of thirty masses
of the Holy Ghost; and in the morning, Rienzi, bareheaded, but in
complete armor, issued from the church, encompassed by the hundred
conspirators. The pope's vicar, the simple bishop of Orvieto, who had
been persuaded to sustain a part in this singular ceremony, marched on
his right hand; and three great standards were borne aloft as the
emblems of their design. In the first, the banner of liberty, Rome was
seated on two lions, with a palm in one hand and a globe in the other;
St. Paul, with a drawn sword, was delineated in the banner of justice;
and in the third, St. Peter held the keys of concord and peace. Rienzi
was encouraged by the presence and applause of an innumerable crowd, who
understood little, and hoped much; and the procession slowly rolled
forwards from the castle of St. Angelo to the Capitol. His triumph was
disturbed by some secret emotions which he labored to suppress: he
ascended without opposition, and with seeming confidence, the citadel of
the republic; harangued the people from the balcony; and received the
most flattering confirmation of his acts and laws. The nobles, as if
destitute of arms and counsels, beheld in silent consternation this
strange revolution; and the moment had been prudently chosen, when the
most formidable, Stephen Colonna, was absent from the city. On the first
rumor, he returned to his palace, affected to despise this plebeian
tumult, and declared to the messenger of Rienzi, that at his leisure he
would cast the madman from the windows of the Capitol. The great bell
instantly rang an alarm, and so rapid was the tide, so urgent was the
danger, that Colonna escaped with precipitation to the suburb of St.
Laurence: from thence, after a moment's refreshment, he continued the
same speedy career till he reached in safety his castle of Palestrina;
lamenting his own imprudence, which had not trampled the spark of this
mighty conflagration. A general and peremptory order was issued from the
Capitol to all the nobles, that they should peaceably retire to their
estates: they obeyed; and their departure secured the tranquillity of
the free and obedient citizens of Rome.

But such voluntary obedience evaporates with the first transports of
zeal; and Rienzi felt the importance of justifying his usurpation by a
regular form and a legal title. At his own choice, the Roman people
would have displayed their attachment and authority, by lavishing on his
head the names of senator or consul, of king or emperor: he preferred
the ancient and modest appellation of tribune;  <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[\*\_0068](#fn_1087.md) the protection of the commons
was the essence of that sacred office; and they were ignorant, that it
had never been invested with any share in the legislative or executive
powers of the republic. In this character, and with the consent of the
Roman, the tribune enacted the most salutary laws for the restoration
and maintenance of the good estate. By the first he fulfils the wish of
honesty and inexperience, that no civil suit should be protracted beyond
the term of fifteen days. The danger of frequent perjury might justify
the pronouncing against a false accuser the same penalty which his
evidence would have inflicted: the disorders of the times might compel
the legislator to punish every homicide with death, and every injury
with equal retaliation. But the execution of justice was hopeless till
he had previously abolished the tyranny of the nobles. It was formally
provided, that none, except the supreme magistrate, should possess or
command the gates, bridges, or towers of the state; that no private
garrisons should be introduced into the towns or castles of the Roman
territory; that none should bear arms, or presume to fortify their
houses in the city or country; that the barons should be responsible for
the safety of the highways, and the free passage of provisions; and that
the protection of malefactors and robbers should be expiated by a fine
of a thousand marks of silver. But these regulations would have been
impotent and nugatory, had not the licentious nobles been awed by the
sword of the civil power. A sudden alarm from the bell of the Capitol
could still summon to the standard above twenty thousand volunteers: the
support of the tribune and the laws required a more regular and
permanent force. In each harbor of the coast a vessel was stationed for
the assurance of commerce; a standing militia of three hundred and sixty
horse and thirteen hundred foot was levied, clothed, and paid in the
thirteen quarters of the city: and the spirit of a commonwealth may be
traced in the grateful allowance of one hundred florins, or pounds, to
the heirs of every soldier who lost his life in the service of his
country. For the maintenance of the public defence, for the
establishment of granaries, for the relief of widows, orphans, and
indigent convents, Rienzi applied, without fear of sacrilege, the
revenues of the apostolic chamber: the three branches of hearth-money,
the salt-duty, and the customs, were each of the annual produce of one
hundred thousand florins;  <span id="fr_1088"></span>[26](#fn_1088.md) and
scandalous were the abuses, if in four or five months the amount of the
salt-duty could be trebled by his judicious economy. After thus
restoring the forces and finances of the republic, the tribune recalled
the nobles from their solitary independence; required their personal
appearance in the Capitol; and imposed an oath of allegiance to the new
government, and of submission to the laws of the good estate.
Apprehensive for their safety, but still more apprehensive of the danger
of a refusal, the princes and barons returned to their houses at Rome in
the garb of simple and peaceful citizens: the Colonna and Ursini, the
Savelli and Frangipani, were confounded before the tribunal of a
plebeian, of the vile buffoon whom they had so often derided, and their
disgrace was aggravated by the indignation which they vainly struggled
to disguise. The same oath was successively pronounced by the several
orders of society, the clergy and gentlemen, the judges and notaries,
the merchants and artisans, and the gradual descent was marked by the
increase of sincerity and zeal. They swore to live and die with the
republic and the church, whose interest was artfully united by the
nominal association of the bishop of Orvieto, the pope's vicar, to the
office of tribune. It was the boast of Rienzi, that he had delivered the
throne and patrimony of St. Peter from a rebellious aristocracy; and
Clement the Sixth, who rejoiced in its fall, affected to believe the
professions, to applaud the merits, and to confirm the title, of his
trusty servant. The speech, perhaps the mind, of the tribune, was
inspired with a lively regard for the purity of the faith: he insinuated
his claim to a supernatural mission from the Holy Ghost; enforced by a
heavy forfeiture the annual duty of confession and communion; and
strictly guarded the spiritual as well as temporal welfare of his
faithful people.  <span id="fr_1089"></span>[27](#fn_1089.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[1](daf06036.htm#fr_1059.md) The Memoires sur la
Vie de Francois Petrarque, (Amsterdam, 1764, 1767, 3 vols. in 4to.,)
form a copious, original, and entertaining work, a labor of love,
composed from the accurate study of Petrarch and his contemporaries; but
the hero is too often lost in the general history of the age, and the
author too often languishes in the affectation of politeness and
gallantry. In the preface to his first volume, he enumerates and weighs
twenty Italian biographers, who have professedly treated of the same
subject.

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[2](daf06036.htm#fr_1060.md) The allegorical
interpretation prevailed in the xvth century; but the wise commentators
were not agreed whether they should understand by Laura, religion, or
virtue, or the blessed virgin, or - see the prefaces to the first and
second volume.

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[3](daf06036.htm#fr_1061.md) Laure de Noves, born
about the year 1307, was married in January 1325, to Hugues de Sade, a
noble citizen of Avignon, whose jealousy was not the effect of love,
since he married a second wife within seven months of her death, which
happened the 6th of April, 1348, precisely one-and-twenty years after
Petrarch had seen and loved her.

<span id="fn_1062"></span>[4](daf06036.htm#fr_1062.md) Corpus crebris
partubus exhaustum: from one of these is issued, in the tenth degree,
the abbe de Sade, the fond and grateful biographer of Petrarch; and this
domestic motive most probably suggested the idea of his work, and urged
him to inquire into every circumstance that could affect the history and
character of his grandmother, (see particularly tom. i. p. 122 - 133,
notes, p. 7 - 58, tom. ii. p. 455 - 495 not. p. 76 - 82.)

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[5](daf06036.htm#fr_1063.md) Vaucluse, so
familiar to our English travellers, is described from the writings of
Petrarch, and the local knowledge of his biographer, (Memoires, tom. i.
p. 340 - 359.) It was, in truth, the retreat of a hermit; and the
moderns are much mistaken, if they place Laura and a happy lover in the
grotto.

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[6](daf06036.htm#fr_1064.md) Of 1250 pages, in a
close print, at Basil in the xvith century, but without the date of the
year. The abbe de Sade calls aloud for a new edition of Petrarch's Latin
works; but I much doubt whether it would redound to the profit of the
bookseller, or the amusement of the public.

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[7](daf06036.htm#fr_1065.md) Consult Selden's
Titles of Honor, in his works, (vol. iii. p. 457 - 466.) A hundred years
before Petrarch, St. Francis received the visit of a poet, qui ab
imperatore fuerat coronatus et exinde rex versuum dictus.

<span id="fn_1066"></span>[8](daf06036.htm#fr_1066.md) From Augustus to
Louis, the muse has too often been false and venal: but I much doubt
whether any age or court can produce a similar establishment of a
stipendiary poet, who in every reign, and at all events, is bound to
furnish twice a year a measure of praise and verse, such as may be sung
in the chapel, and, I believe, in the presence, of the sovereign. I
speak the more freely, as the best time for abolishing this ridiculous
custom is while the prince is a man of virtue and the poet a man of
genius.

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[9](daf06036.htm#fr_1067.md) Isocrates (in
Panegyrico, tom. i. p. 116, 117, edit. Battie, Cantab. 1729) claims for
his native Athens the glory of first instituting and recommending. The
example of the Panathenaea was imitated at Delphi; but the Olympic games
were ignorant of a musical crown, till it was extorted by the vain
tyranny of Nero, (Sueton. in Nerone, c. 23; Philostrat. apud Casaubon ad
locum; Dion Cassius, or Xiphilin, l. lxiii. p. 1032, 1041. Potter's
Greek Antiquities, vol. i. p. 445, 450.)

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[10](daf06036.htm#fr_1068.md) The Capitoline
games (certamen quinquenale, musicum, equestre, gymnicum) were
instituted by Domitian (Sueton. c. 4) in the year of Christ 86,
(Censorin. de Die Natali, c. 18, p. 100, edit. Havercamp.) and were not
abolished in the ivth century, (Ausonius de Professoribus Burdegal. V.)
If the crown were given to superior merit, the exclusion of Statius
(Capitolia nostrae inficiata lyrae, Sylv. l. iii. v. 31) may do honor to
the games of the Capitol; but the Latin poets who lived before Domitian
were crowned only in the public opinion.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[11](daf06036.htm#fr_1069.md) Petrarch and the
senators of Rome were ignorant that the laurel was not the Capitoline,
but the Delphic crown, (Plin. Hist. Natur p. 39. Hist. Critique de la
Republique des Lettres, tom. i. p. 150 - 220.) The victors in the
Capitol were crowned with a garland of oak eaves, (Martial, l. iv.
epigram 54.)

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[12](daf06036.htm#fr_1070.md) The pious grandson
of Laura has labored, and not without success, to vindicate her
immaculate chastity against the censures of the grave and the sneers of
the profane, (tom. ii. notes, p. 76 - 82.)

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[13](daf06036.htm#fr_1071.md) The whole process
of Petrarch's coronation is accurately described by the abbe de Sade,
(tom. i. p. 425 - 435, tom. ii. p. 1 - 6, notes, p. 1 - 13,) from his
own writings, and the Roman diary of Ludovico, Monaldeschi, without
mixing in this authentic narrative the more recent fables of Sannuccio
Delbene.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[14](daf06036.htm#fr_1072.md) The original act is
printed among the Pieces Justificatives in the Memoires sur Petrarque,
tom. iii. p. 50 - 53.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[15](daf06036.htm#fr_1073.md) To find the proofs
of his enthusiasm for Rome, I need only request that the reader would
open, by chance, either Petrarch, or his French biographer. The latter
has described the poet's first visit to Rome, (tom. i. p. 323 - 335.)
But in the place of much idle rhetoric and morality, Petrarch might have
amused the present and future age with an original account of the city
and his coronation.

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[16](daf06036.htm#fr_1074.md) It has been treated
by the pen of a Jesuit, the P. de Cerceau whose posthumous work
(Conjuration de Nicolas Gabrini, dit de Rienzi, Tyran de Rome, en 1347)
was published at Paris, 1748, in 12mo. I am indebted to him for some
facts and documents in John Hocsemius, canon of Liege, a contemporary
historian, (Fabricius Bibliot. Lat. Med. Aevi, tom. iii. p. 273, tom.
iv. p. 85.)

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[17](daf06036.htm#fr_1075.md) The abbe de Sade,
who so freely expatiates on the history of the xivth century, might
treat, as his proper subject, a revolution in which the heart of
Petrarch was so deeply engaged, (Memoires, tom. ii. p. 50, 51, 320 -
417, notes, p. 70 - 76, tom. iii. p. 221 - 243, 366 - 375.) Not an idea
or a fact in the writings of Petrarch has probably escaped him.

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[18](daf06036.htm#fr_1076.md) Giovanni Villani,
l. xii. c. 89, 104, in Muratori, Rerum Italicarum Scriptores, tom. xiii.
p. 969, 970, 981 - 983.

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[19](daf06036.htm#fr_1077.md) In his third volume
of Italian antiquities, (p. 249 - 548,) Muratori has inserted the
Fragmenta Historiae Romanae ab Anno 1327 usque ad Annum 1354, in the
original dialect of Rome or Naples in the xivth century, and a Latin
version for the benefit of strangers. It contains the most particular
and authentic life of Cola (Nicholas) di Rienzi; which had been printed
at Bracciano, 1627, in 4to., under the name of Tomaso Fortifiocca, who
is only mentioned in this work as having been punished by the tribune
for forgery. Human nature is scarcely capable of such sublime or stupid
impartiality: but whosoever in the author of these Fragments, he wrote
on the spot and at the time, and paints, without design or art, the
manners of Rome and the character of the tribune.

Note: Since the publication of my first edition of Gibbon, some new and
very remarkable documents have been brought to light in a life of
Nicolas Rienzi, - Cola di Rienzo und seine Zeit, - by Dr. Felix
Papencordt. The most important of these documents are letters from
Rienzi to Charles the Fourth, emperor and king of Bohemia, and to the
archbishop of Praque; they enter into the whole history of his
adventurous career during its first period, and throw a strong light
upon his extraordinary character. These documents were first discovered
and made use of, to a certain extent, by Pelzel, the historian of
Bohemia. The originals have disappeared, but a copy made by Pelzel for
his own use is now in the library of Count Thun at Teschen. There seems
no doubt of their authenticity. Dr. Papencordt has printed the whole in
his i:Urkunden, with the exception of one long theological paper. - M.
1845.

<span id="fn_1078"></span>[20](daf06036.htm#fr_1078.md) The first and
splendid period of Rienzi, his tribunitian government, is contained in
the xviiith chapter of the Fragments, (p. 399 - 479,) which, in the new
division, forms the iid book of the history in xxxviii. smaller chapters
or sections.

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[!\_0067](daf06036.htm#fr_1079.md) But see in Dr.
Papencordt's work, and in Rienzi's own words, his claim to be a bastard
son of the emperor Henry the Seventh, whose intrigue with his mother
Rienzi relates with a sort of proud shamelessness. Compare account by
the editor of Dr. Papencordt's work in Quarterly Review vol. lxix. - M.
1845.

<span id="fn_1080"></span>[21](daf06036.htm#fr_1080.md) The reader may be
pleased with a specimen of the original idiom: Fo da soa juventutine
nutricato di latte de eloquentia, bono gramatico, megliore rettuorico,
autorista bravo. Deh como et quanto era veloce leitore! moito usava Tito
Livio, Seneca, et Tullio, et Balerio Massimo, moito li dilettava le
magnificentie di Julio Cesare raccontare. Tutta la die se speculava
negl' intagli di marmo lequali iaccio intorno Roma. Non era altri che
esso, che sapesse lejere li antichi pataffii. Tutte scritture antiche
vulgarizzava; quesse fiure di marmo justamente interpretava. On come
spesso diceva, "Dove suono quelli buoni Romani? dove ene loro somma
justitia? poleramme trovare in tempo che quessi fiuriano!"

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[\*\_0067](daf06036.htm#fr_1081.md) Sir J.
Hobhouse published (in his Illustrations of Childe Harold) Rienzi's
joyful letter to the people of Rome on the apparently favorable
termination of this mission. - M. 1845.

<span id="fn_1082"></span>[22](daf06036.htm#fr_1082.md) Petrarch compares
the jealousy of the Romans with the easy temper of the husbands of
Avignon, (Memoires, tom. i. p. 330.)

<span id="fn_1083"></span>[!!\_0067](daf06036.htm#fr_1083.md) All this
Rienzi, writing at a later period to the archbishop of Prague,
attributed to the criminal abandonment of his flock by the supreme
pontiff. See Urkunde apud Papencordt, p. xliv. Quarterly Review, p. 255.
- M. 1845.

<span id="fn_1084"></span>[23](daf06036.htm#fr_1084.md) The fragments of
the Lex regia may be found in the Inscriptions of Gruter, tom. i. p.
242, and at the end of the Tacitus of Ernesti, with some learned notes
of the editor, tom. ii.

<span id="fn_1085"></span>[24](daf06036.htm#fr_1085.md) I cannot overlook a
stupendous and laughable blunder of Rienzi. The Lex regia empowers
Vespasian to enlarge the Pomoerium, a word familiar to every antiquary.
It was not so to the tribune; he confounds it with pomarium, an orchard,
translates lo Jardino de Roma cioene Italia, and is copied by the less
excusable ignorance of the Latin translator (p. 406) and the French
historian, (p. 33.) Even the learning of Muratori has slumbered over the
passage.

<span id="fn_1086"></span>[25](daf06036.htm#fr_1086) Priori (Bruto.md)
tamen similior, juvenis uterque, longe ingenic quam cujus simulationem
induerat, ut sub hoc obtentu liberator ille P R. aperiretur tempore suo
.... Ille regibus, hic tyrannis contemptus, (Opp (Opp. p. 536.)

Note: Fatcor attamen quod - nunc fatuum. nunc hystrionem, nunc gravem
nunc simplicem, nunc astutum, nunc fervidum, nunc timidum simulato rem,
et dissimulatorem ad hunc caritativum finem, quem dixi, constitusepius
memet ipsum. Writing to an archbishop, (of Prague,) Rienzi alleges
scriptural examples. Saltator coram archa David et insanus apparuit
coram Rege; blanda, astuta, et tecta Judith astitit Holoferni; et astate
Jacob meruit benedici, Urkunde xlix. - M. 1845.

<span id="fn_1087"></span>[\*\_0068](daf06036.htm#fr_1087.md) Et ego, Deo
semper auctore, ipsa die pristina (leg. prima) Tribunatus, quae quidem
dignitas a tempore deflorati Imperii, et per annos Vo et ultra sub
tyrannica occupatione vacavit, ipsos omnes potentes indifferenter Deum
at justitiam odientes, a mea, ymo a Dei facie fugiendo vehementi Spiritu
dissipavi, et nullo effuso cruore trementes expuli, sine ictu remanents
Romane terre facie renovata. Libellus Tribuni ad Caesarem, p. xxxiv - M.
1845.

<span id="fn_1088"></span>[26](daf06036.htm#fr_1088.md) In one MS. I read
(l. ii. c. 4, p. 409) perfumante quatro solli, in another, quatro
florini, an important variety, since the florin was worth ten Roman
solidi, (Muratori, dissert. xxviii.) The former reading would give us a
population of 25,000, the latter of 250,000 families; and I much fear,
that the former is more consistent with the decay of Rome and her
territory.

may be found in the Roman historian (whom for brevity I shall name)
