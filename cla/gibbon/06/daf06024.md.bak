### Chapter LXVI: Union Of The Greek And Latin Churches. Part II.

During the period of the crusades, the Greeks beheld with astonishment
and terror the perpetual stream of emigration that flowed, and continued
to flow, from the unknown climates of their West. The visits of their
last emperors removed the veil of separation, and they disclosed to
their eyes the powerful nations of Europe, whom they no longer presumed
to brand with the name of Barbarians. The observations of Manuel, and
his more inquisitive followers, have been preserved by a Byzantine
historian of the times:  <span id="fr_677"></span>[22](#fn_677.md) his
scattered ideas I shall collect and abridge; and it may be amusing
enough, perhaps instructive, to contemplate the rude pictures of
Germany, France, and England, whose ancient and modern state are so
familiar to our minds. I. Germany (says the Greek Chalcondyles) is of
ample latitude from Vienna to the ocean; and it stretches (a strange
geography) from Prague in Bohemia to the River Tartessus, and the
Pyrenaean Mountains.  <span id="fr_678"></span>[23](#fn_678.md) The soil,
except in figs and olives, is sufficiently fruitful; the air is
salubrious; the bodies of the natives are robust and healthy; and these
cold regions are seldom visited with the calamities of pestilence, or
earthquakes. After the Scythians or Tartars, the Germans are the most
numerous of nations: they are brave and patient; and were they united
under a single head, their force would be irresistible. By the gift of
the pope, they have acquired the privilege of choosing the Roman
emperor;  <span id="fr_679"></span>[24](#fn_679.md) nor is any people more
devoutly attached to the faith and obedience of the Latin patriarch. The
greatest part of the country is divided among the princes and prelates;
but Strasburg, Cologne, Hamburgh, and more than two hundred free cities,
are governed by sage and equal laws, according to the will, and for the
advantage, of the whole community. The use of duels, or single combats
on foot, prevails among them in peace and war: their industry excels in
all the mechanic arts; and the Germans may boast of the invention of
gunpowder and cannon, which is now diffused over the greatest part of
the world. II. The kingdom of France is spread above fifteen or twenty
days' journey from Germany to Spain, and from the Alps to the British
Ocean; containing many flourishing cities, and among these Paris, the
seat of the king, which surpasses the rest in riches and luxury. Many
princes and lords alternately wait in his palace, and acknowledge him as
their sovereign: the most powerful are the dukes of Bretagne and
Burgundy; of whom the latter possesses the wealthy province of Flanders,
whose harbors are frequented by the ships and merchants of our own, and
the more remote, seas. The French are an ancient and opulent people; and
their language and manners, though somewhat different, are not
dissimilar from those of the Italians. Vain of the Imperial dignity of
Charlemagne, of their victories over the Saracens, and of the exploits
of their heroes, Oliver and Rowland,  <span
id="fr_680"></span>[25](#fn_680.md) they esteem themselves the first of the
western nations; but this foolish arrogance has been recently humbled by
the unfortunate events of their wars against the English, the
inhabitants of the British island. III. Britain, in the ocean, and
opposite to the shores of Flanders, may be considered either as one, or
as three islands; but the whole is united by a common interest, by the
same manners, and by a similar government. The measure of its
circumference is five thousand stadia: the land is overspread with towns
and villages: though destitute of wine, and not abounding in
fruit-trees, it is fertile in wheat and barley; in honey and wool; and
much cloth is manufactured by the inhabitants. In populousness and
power, in richness and luxury, London,  <span
id="fr_681"></span>[26](#fn_681.md) the metropolis of the isle, may claim a
preeminence over all the cities of the West. It is situate on the
Thames, a broad and rapid river, which at the distance of thirty miles
falls into the Gallic Sea; and the daily flow and ebb of the tide
affords a safe entrance and departure to the vessels of commerce. The
king is head of a powerful and turbulent aristocracy: his principal
vassals hold their estates by a free and unalterable tenure; and the
laws define the limits of his authority and their obedience. The kingdom
has been often afflicted by foreign conquest and domestic sedition: but
the natives are bold and hardy, renowned in arms and victorious in war.
The form of their shields or targets is derived from the Italians, that
of their swords from the Greeks; the use of the long bow is the peculiar
and decisive advantage of the English. Their language bears no affinity
to the idioms of the Continent: in the habits of domestic life, they are
not easily distinguished from their neighbors of France: but the most
singular circumstance of their manners is their disregard of conjugal
honor and of female chastity. In their mutual visits, as the first act
of hospitality, the guest is welcomed in the embraces of their wives and
daughters: among friends they are lent and borrowed without shame; nor
are the islanders offended at this strange commerce, and its inevitable
consequences.  <span id="fr_682"></span>[27](#fn_682.md) Informed as we are
of the customs of Old England and assured of the virtue of our mothers,
we may smile at the credulity, or resent the injustice, of the Greek,
who must have confounded a modest salute  <span
id="fr_683"></span>[28](#fn_683.md) with a criminal embrace. But his
credulity and injustice may teach an important lesson; to distrust the
accounts of foreign and remote nations, and to suspend our belief of
every tale that deviates from the laws of nature and the character of
man.  <span id="fr_684"></span>[29](#fn_684.md)

After his return, and the victory of Timour, Manuel reigned many years
in prosperity and peace. As long as the sons of Bajazet solicited his
friendship and spared his dominions, he was satisfied with the national
religion; and his leisure was employed in composing twenty theological
dialogues for its defence. The appearance of the Byzantine ambassadors
at the council of Constance,  <span id="fr_685"></span>[30](#fn_685.md)
announces the restoration of the Turkish power, as well as of the Latin
church: the conquest of the sultans, Mahomet and Amurath, reconciled the
emperor to the Vatican; and the siege of Constantinople almost tempted
him to acquiesce in the double procession of the Holy Ghost. When Martin
the Fifth ascended without a rival the chair of St. Peter, a friendly
intercourse of letters and embassies was revived between the East and
West. Ambition on one side, and distress on the other, dictated the same
decent language of charity and peace: the artful Greek expressed a
desire of marrying his six sons to Italian princesses; and the Roman,
not less artful, despatched the daughter of the marquis of Montferrat,
with a company of noble virgins, to soften, by their charms, the
obstinacy of the schismatics. Yet under this mask of zeal, a discerning
eye will perceive that all was hollow and insincere in the court and
church of Constantinople. According to the vicissitudes of danger and
repose, the emperor advanced or retreated; alternately instructed and
disavowed his ministers; and escaped from the importunate pressure by
urging the duty of inquiry, the obligation of collecting the sense of
his patriarchs and bishops, and the impossibility of convening them at a
time when the Turkish arms were at the gates of his capital. From a
review of the public transactions it will appear that the Greeks
insisted on three successive measures, a succor, a council, and a final
reunion, while the Latins eluded the second, and only promised the
first, as a consequential and voluntary reward of the third. But we have
an opportunity of unfolding the most secret intentions of Manuel, as he
explained them in a private conversation without artifice or disguise.
In his declining age, the emperor had associated John Palaeologus, the
second of the name, and the eldest of his sons, on whom he devolved the
greatest part of the authority and weight of government. One day, in the
presence only of the historian Phranza,  <span
id="fr_686"></span>[31](#fn_686.md) his favorite chamberlain, he opened to
his colleague and successor the true principle of his negotiations with
the pope.  <span id="fr_687"></span>[32](#fn_687.md) "Our last resource,"
said Manuel, against the Turks, "is their fear of our union with the
Latins, of the warlike nations of the West, who may arm for our relief
and for their destruction. As often as you are threatened by the
miscreants, present this danger before their eyes. Propose a council;
consult on the means; but ever delay and avoid the convocation of an
assembly, which cannot tend either to our spiritual or temporal
emolument. The Latins are proud; the Greeks are obstinate; neither party
will recede or retract; and the attempt of a perfect union will confirm
the schism, alienate the churches, and leave us, without hope or
defence, at the mercy of the Barbarians." Impatient of this salutary
lesson, the royal youth arose from his seat, and departed in silence;
and the wise monarch (continued Phranza) casting his eyes on me, thus
resumed his discourse: "My son deems himself a great and heroic prince;
but, alas! our miserable age does not afford scope for heroism or
greatness. His daring spirit might have suited the happier times of our
ancestors; but the present state requires not an emperor, but a cautious
steward of the last relics of our fortunes. Well do I remember the lofty
expectations which he built on our alliance with Mustapha; and much do I
fear, that this rash courage will urge the ruin of our house, and that
even religion may precipitate our downfall." Yet the experience and
authority of Manuel preserved the peace, and eluded the council; till,
in the seventy-eighth year of his age, and in the habit of a monk, he
terminated his career, dividing his precious movables among his children
and the poor, his physicians and his favorite servants. Of his six sons,
 <span id="fr_688"></span>[33](#fn_688.md) Andronicus the Second was
invested with the principality of Thessalonica, and died of a leprosy
soon after the sale of that city to the Venetians and its final conquest
by the Turks. Some fortunate incidents had restored Peloponnesus, or the
Morea, to the empire; and in his more prosperous days, Manuel had
fortified the narrow isthmus of six miles  <span
id="fr_689"></span>[34](#fn_689.md) with a stone wall and one hundred and
fifty-three towers. The wall was overthrown by the first blast of the
Ottomans; the fertile peninsula might have been sufficient for the four
younger brothers, Theodore and Constantine, Demetrius and Thomas; but
they wasted in domestic contests the remains of their strength; and the
least successful of the rivals were reduced to a life of dependence in
the Byzantine palace.

The eldest of the sons of Manuel, John Palaeologus the Second, was
acknowledged, after his father's death, as the sole emperor of the
Greeks. He immediately proceeded to repudiate his wife, and to contract
a new marriage with the princess of Trebizond: beauty was in his eyes
the first qualification of an empress; and the clergy had yielded to his
firm assurance, that unless he might be indulged in a divorce, he would
retire to a cloister, and leave the throne to his brother Constantine.
The first, and in truth the only, victory of Palaeologus, was over a
Jew,  <span id="fr_690"></span>[35](#fn_690.md) whom, after a long and
learned dispute, he converted to the Christian faith; and this momentous
conquest is carefully recorded in the history of the times. But he soon
resumed the design of uniting the East and West; and, regardless of his
father's advice, listened, as it should seem with sincerity, to the
proposal of meeting the pope in a general council beyond the Adriatic.
This dangerous project was encouraged by Martin the Fifth, and coldly
entertained by his successor Eugenius, till, after a tedious
negotiation, the emperor received a summons from the Latin assembly of a
new character, the independent prelates of Basil, who styled themselves
the representatives and judges of the Catholic church. The Roman pontiff
had fought and conquered in the cause of ecclesiastical freedom; but the
victorious clergy were soon exposed to the tyranny of their deliverer;
and his sacred character was invulnerable to those arms which they found
so keen and effectual against the civil magistrate. Their great charter,
the right of election, was annihilated by appeals, evaded by trusts or
commendams, disappointed by reversionary grants, and superseded by
previous and arbitrary reservations.  <span
id="fr_691"></span>[36](#fn_691.md) A public auction was instituted in the
court of Rome: the cardinals and favorites were enriched with the spoils
of nations; and every country might complain that the most important and
valuable benefices were accumulated on the heads of aliens and
absentees. During their residence at Avignon, the ambition of the popes
subsided in the meaner passions of avarice  <span
id="fr_692"></span>[37](#fn_692.md) and luxury: they rigorously imposed on
the clergy the tributes of first-fruits and tenths; but they freely
tolerated the impunity of vice, disorder, and corruption. These manifold
scandals were aggravated by the great schism of the West, which
continued above fifty years. In the furious conflicts of Rome and
Avignon, the vices of the rivals were mutually exposed; and their
precarious situation degraded their authority, relaxed their discipline,
and multiplied their wants and exactions. To heal the wounds, and
restore the monarchy, of the church, the synods of Pisa and Constance
 <span id="fr_693"></span>[38](#fn_693.md) were successively convened; but
these great assemblies, conscious of their strength, resolved to
vindicate the privileges of the Christian aristocracy. From a personal
sentence against two pontiffs, whom they rejected, and a third, their
acknowledged sovereign, whom they deposed, the fathers of Constance
proceeded to examine the nature and limits of the Roman supremacy; nor
did they separate till they had established the authority, above the
pope, of a general council. It was enacted, that, for the government and
reformation of the church, such assemblies should be held at regular
intervals; and that each synod, before its dissolution, should appoint
the time and place of the subsequent meeting. By the influence of the
court of Rome, the next convocation at Sienna was easily eluded; but the
bold and vigorous proceedings of the council of Basil  <span
id="fr_694"></span>[39](#fn_694.md) had almost been fatal to the reigning
pontiff, Eugenius the Fourth. A just suspicion of his design prompted
the fathers to hasten the promulgation of their first decree, that the
representatives of the church-militant on earth were invested with a
divine and spiritual jurisdiction over all Christians, without excepting
the pope; and that a general council could not be dissolved, prorogued,
or transferred, unless by their free deliberation and consent. On the
notice that Eugenius had fulminated a bull for that purpose, they
ventured to summon, to admonish, to threaten, to censure the
contumacious successor of St. Peter. After many delays, to allow time
for repentance, they finally declared, that, unless he submitted within
the term of sixty days, he was suspended from the exercise of all
temporal and ecclesiastical authority. And to mark their jurisdiction
over the prince as well as the priest, they assumed the government of
Avignon, annulled the alienation of the sacred patrimony, and protected
Rome from the imposition of new taxes. Their boldness was justified, not
only by the general opinion of the clergy, but by the support and power
of the first monarchs of Christendom: the emperor Sigismond declared
himself the servant and protector of the synod; Germany and France
adhered to their cause; the duke of Milan was the enemy of Eugenius; and
he was driven from the Vatican by an insurrection of the Roman people.
Rejected at the same time by temporal and spiritual subjects, submission
was his only choice: by a most humiliating bull, the pope repealed his
own acts, and ratified those of the council; incorporated his legates
and cardinals with that venerable body; and seemed to resign himself to
the decrees of the supreme legislature. Their fame pervaded the
countries of the East: and it was in their presence that Sigismond
received the ambassadors of the Turkish sultan,  <span
id="fr_695"></span>[40](#fn_695.md) who laid at his feet twelve large
vases, filled with robes of silk and pieces of gold. The fathers of
Basil aspired to the glory of reducing the Greeks, as well as the
Bohemians, within the pale of the church; and their deputies invited the
emperor and patriarch of Constantinople to unite with an assembly which
possessed the confidence of the Western nations. Palaeologus was not
averse to the proposal; and his ambassadors were introduced with due
honors into the Catholic senate. But the choice of the place appeared to
be an insuperable obstacle, since he refused to pass the Alps, or the
sea of Sicily, and positively required that the synod should be
adjourned to some convenient city in Italy, or at least on the Danube.
The other articles of this treaty were more readily stipulated: it was
agreed to defray the travelling expenses of the emperor, with a train of
seven hundred persons,  <span id="fr_696"></span>[41](#fn_696.md) to remit
an immediate sum of eight thousand ducats  <span
id="fr_697"></span>[42](#fn_697.md) for the accommodation of the Greek
clergy; and in his absence to grant a supply of ten thousand ducats,
with three hundred archers and some galleys, for the protection of
Constantinople. The city of Avignon advanced the funds for the
preliminary expenses; and the embarkation was prepared at Marseilles
with some difficulty and delay.

In his distress, the friendship of Palaeologus was disputed by the
ecclesiastical powers of the West; but the dexterous activity of a
monarch prevailed over the slow debates and inflexible temper of a
republic. The decrees of Basil continually tended to circumscribe the
despotism of the pope, and to erect a supreme and perpetual tribunal in
the church. Eugenius was impatient of the yoke; and the union of the
Greeks might afford a decent pretence for translating a rebellious synod
from the Rhine to the Po. The independence of the fathers was lost if
they passed the Alps: Savoy or Avignon, to which they acceded with
reluctance, were described at Constantinople as situate far beyond the
pillars of Hercules;  <span id="fr_698"></span>[43](#fn_698.md) the emperor
and his clergy were apprehensive of the dangers of a long navigation;
they were offended by a haughty declaration, that after suppressing the
new heresy of the Bohemians, the council would soon eradicate the old
heresy of the Greeks.  <span id="fr_699"></span>[44](#fn_699.md) On the
side of Eugenius, all was smooth, and yielding, and respectful; and he
invited the Byzantine monarch to heal by his presence the schism of the
Latin, as well as of the Eastern, church. Ferrara, near the coast of the
Adriatic, was proposed for their amicable interview; and with some
indulgence of forgery and theft, a surreptitious decree was procured,
which transferred the synod, with its own consent, to that Italian city.
Nine galleys were equipped for the service at Venice, and in the Isle of
Candia; their diligence anticipated the slower vessels of Basil: the
Roman admiral was commissioned to burn, sink, and destroy;  <span
id="fr_700"></span>[45](#fn_700.md) and these priestly squadrons might have
encountered each other in the same seas where Athens and Sparta had
formerly contended for the preeminence of glory. Assaulted by the
importunity of the factions, who were ready to fight for the possession
of his person, Palaeologus hesitated before he left his palace and
country on a perilous experiment. His father's advice still dwelt on his
memory; and reason must suggest, that since the Latins were divided
among themselves, they could never unite in a foreign cause. Sigismond
dissuaded the unreasonable adventure; his advice was impartial, since he
adhered to the council; and it was enforced by the strange belief, that
the German Caesar would nominate a Greek his heir and successor in the
empire of the West.  <span id="fr_701"></span>[46](#fn_701.md) Even the
Turkish sultan was a counsellor whom it might be unsafe to trust, but
whom it was dangerous to offend. Amurath was unskilled in the disputes,
but he was apprehensive of the union, of the Christians. From his own
treasures, he offered to relieve the wants of the Byzantine court; yet
he declared with seeming magnanimity, that Constantinople should be
secure and inviolate, in the absence of her sovereign.  <span
id="fr_702"></span>[47](#fn_702.md) The resolution of Palaeologus was
decided by the most splendid gifts and the most specious promises: he
wished to escape for a while from a scene of danger and distress and
after dismissing with an ambiguous answer the messengers of the council,
he declared his intention of embarking in the Roman galleys. The age of
the patriarch Joseph was more susceptible of fear than of hope; he
trembled at the perils of the sea, and expressed his apprehension, that
his feeble voice, with thirty perhaps of his orthodox brethren, would be
oppressed in a foreign land by the power and numbers of a Latin synod.
He yielded to the royal mandate, to the flattering assurance, that he
would be heard as the oracle of nations, and to the secret wish of
learning from his brother of the West, to deliver the church from the
yoke of kings.  <span id="fr_703"></span>[48](#fn_703.md) The five
cross-bearers, or dignitaries, of St.Sophia, were bound to attend his
person; and one of these, the great ecclesiarch or preacher, Sylvester
Syropulus,  <span id="fr_704"></span>[49](#fn_704.md) has composed a free
and curious history  <span id="fr_705"></span>[50](#fn_705.md) of the false
union.  <span id="fr_706"></span>[51](#fn_706.md) Of the clergy that
reluctantly obeyed the summons of the emperor and the patriarch,
submission was the first duty, and patience the most useful virtue. In a
chosen list of twenty bishops, we discover the metropolitan titles of
Heracleae and Cyzicus, Nice and Nicomedia, Ephesus and Trebizond, and
the personal merit of Mark and Bessarion who, in the confidence of their
learning and eloquence, were promoted to the episcopal rank. Some monks
and philosophers were named to display the science and sanctity of the
Greek church; and the service of the choir was performed by a select
band of singers and musicians. The patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch,
and Jerusalem, appeared by their genuine or fictitious deputies; the
primate of Russia represented a national church, and the Greeks might
contend with the Latins in the extent of their spiritual empire. The
precious vases of St. Sophia were exposed to the winds and waves, that
the patriarch might officiate with becoming splendor: whatever gold the
emperor could procure, was expended in the massy ornaments of his bed
and chariot;  <span id="fr_707"></span>[52](#fn_707.md) and while they
affected to maintain the prosperity of their ancient fortune, they
quarrelled for the division of fifteen thousand ducats, the first alms
of the Roman pontiff. After the necessary preparations, John
Palaeologus, with a numerous train, accompanied by his brother
Demetrius, and the most respectable persons of the church and state,
embarked in eight vessels with sails and oars which steered through the
Turkish Straits of Gallipoli to the Archipelago, the Morea, and the
Adriatic Gulf.  <span id="fr_708"></span>[53](#fn_708.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_677"></span>[22](daf06024.htm#fr_677.md) The Greek and Turkish
history of Laonicus Chalcondyles ends with the winter of 1463; and the
abrupt conclusion seems to mark, that he laid down his pen in the same
year. We know that he was an Athenian, and that some contemporaries of
the same name contributed to the revival of the Greek language in Italy.
But in his numerous digressions, the modest historian has never
introduced himself; and his editor Leunclavius, as well as Fabricius,
(Bibliot. Graec. tom. vi. p. 474,) seems ignorant of his life and
character. For his descriptions of Germany, France, and England, see l.
ii. p. 36, 37, 44 - 50.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[23](daf06024.htm#fr_678.md) I shall not
animadvert on the geographical errors of Chalcondyles. In this instance,
he perhaps followed, and mistook, Herodotus, (l. ii. c. 33,) whose text
may be explained, (Herodote de Larcher, tom. ii. p. 219, 220,) or whose
ignorance may be excused. Had these modern Greeks never read Strabo, or
any of their lesser geographers?

<span id="fn_679"></span>[24](daf06024.htm#fr_679.md) A citizen of new
Rome, while new Rome survived, would have scorned to dignify the German
with titles: but all pride was extinct in the bosom of Chalcondyles; and
he describes the Byzantine prince, and his subject, by the proper,
though humble, names.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[25](daf06024.htm#fr_680.md) Most of the old
romances were translated in the xivth century into French prose, and
soon became the favorite amusement of the knights and ladies in the
court of Charles VI. If a Greek believed in the exploits of Rowland and
Oliver, he may surely be excused, since the monks of St. Denys, the
national historians, have inserted the fables of Archbishop Turpin in
their Chronicles of France.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[26](daf06024.htm#fr_681.md) Even since the time
of Fitzstephen, (the xiith century,) London appears to have maintained
this preeminence of wealth and magnitude; and her gradual increase has,
at least, kept pace with the general improvement of Europe.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[27](daf06024.htm#fr_682.md) If the double sense
of the verb (osculor, and in utero gero) be equivocal, the context and
pious horror of Chalcondyles can leave no doubt of his meaning and
mistake, (p. 49.)

Note: I can discover no "pious horror" in the plain manner in which
Chalcondyles relates this strange usage. Gibbon is possibly right as to
the origin of this extraordinary mistake. - M.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[28](daf06024.htm#fr_683.md) Erasmus (Epist.
Fausto Andrelino) has a pretty passage on the English fashion of kissing
strangers on their arrival and departure, from whence, however, he draws
no scandalous inferences.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[29](daf06024.htm#fr_684.md) Perhaps we may apply
this remark to the community of wives among the old Britons, as it is
supposed by Caesar and Dion, (Dion Cassius, l. lxii. tom. ii. p. 1007,)
with Reimar's judicious annotation. The Arreoy of Otaheite, so certain
at first, is become less visible and scandalous, in proportion as we
have studied the manners of that gentle and amorous people.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[30](daf06024.htm#fr_685.md) See Lenfant, Hist. du
Concile de Constance, tom. ii. p. 576; and or the ecclesiastical history
of the times, the Annals of Spondanus the Bibliotheque of Dupin, tom.
xii., and xxist and xxiid volumes of the History, or rather the
Continuation, of Fleury.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[31](daf06024.htm#fr_686.md) From his early youth,
George Phranza, or Phranzes, was employed in the service of the state
and palace; and Hanckius (de Script. Byzant. P. i. c. 40) has collected
his life from his own writings. He was no more than four-and-twenty
years of age at the death of Manuel, who recommended him in the
strongest terms to his successor: Imprimis vero hunc Phranzen tibi
commendo, qui ministravit mihi fideliter et diligenter (Phranzes, l. ii.
c. i.) Yet the emperor John was cold, and he preferred the service of
the despots of Peloponnesus.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[32](daf06024.htm#fr_687.md) See Phranzes, l. ii.
c. 13. While so many manuscripts of the Greek original are extant in the
libraries of Rome, Milan, the Escurial, &c., it is a matter of shame and
reproach, that we should be reduced to the Latin version, or abstract,
of James Pontanus, (ad calcem Theophylact, Simocattae: Ingolstadt,
1604,) so deficient in accuracy and elegance, (Fabric. Bibliot. Graec.
tom. vi. p. 615 - 620.)

Note: The Greek text of Phranzes was edited by F. C. Alter Vindobonae.
It has been re-edited by Bekker for the new edition of the Byzantines,
Bonn, 1838 - M.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[33](daf06024.htm#fr_688.md) See Ducange, Fam.
Byzant. p. 243 - 248.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[34](daf06024.htm#fr_689.md) The exact measure of
the Hexamilion, from sea to sea, was 3800 orgyiae, or toises, of six
Greek feet, (Phranzes, l. i. c. 38,) which would produce a Greek mile,
still smaller than that of 660 French toises, which is assigned by
D'Anville, as still in use in Turkey. Five miles are commonly reckoned
for the breadth of the isthmus. See the Travels of Spon, Wheeler and
Chandler.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[35](daf06024.htm#fr_690.md) The first objection
of the Jews is on the death of Christ: if it were voluntary, Christ was
a suicide; which the emperor parries with a mystery. They then dispute
on the conception of the Virgin, the sense of the prophecies, &c.,
(Phranzes, l. ii. c. 12, a whole chapter.)

<span id="fn_691"></span>[36](daf06024.htm#fr_691.md) In the treatise delle
Materie Beneficiarie of Fra Paolo, (in the ivth volume of the last, and
best, edition of his works,) the papal system is deeply studied and
freely described. Should Rome and her religion be annihilated, this
golden volume may still survive, a philosophical history, and a salutary
warning.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[37](daf06024.htm#fr_692.md) Pope John XXII. (in
1334) left behind him, at Avignon, eighteen millions of gold florins,
and the value of seven millions more in plate and jewels. See the
Chronicle of John Villani, (l. xi. c. 20, in Muratori's Collection, tom.
xiii. p. 765,) whose brother received the account from the papal
treasurers. A treasure of six or eight millions sterling in the xivth
century is enormous, and almost incredible.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[38](daf06024.htm#fr_693.md) A learned and liberal
Protestant, M. Lenfant, has given a fair history of the councils of
Pisa, Constance, and Basil, in six volumes in quarto; but the last part
is the most hasty and imperfect, except in the account of the troubles
of Bohemia.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[39](daf06024.htm#fr_694.md) The original acts or
minutes of the council of Basil are preserved in the public library, in
twelve volumes in folio. Basil was a free city, conveniently situate on
the Rhine, and guarded by the arms of the neighboring and confederate
Swiss. In 1459, the university was founded by Pope Pius II., (Aeneas
Sylvius,) who had been secretary to the council. But what is a council,
or a university, to the presses o Froben and the studies of Erasmus?

<span id="fn_695"></span>[40](daf06024.htm#fr_695.md) This Turkish embassy,
attested only by Crantzius, is related with some doubt by the annalist
Spondanus, A.D. 1433, No. 25, tom. i. p. 824

<span id="fn_696"></span>[41](daf06024.htm#fr_696.md) Syropulus, p. 19. In
this list, the Greeks appear to have exceeded the real numbers of the
clergy and laity which afterwards attended the emperor and patriarch,
but which are not clearly specified by the great ecclesiarch. The 75,000
florins which they asked in this negotiation of the pope, (p. 9,) were
more than they could hope or want.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[42](daf06024.htm#fr_697.md) I use indifferently
the words ducat and florin, which derive their names, the former from
the dukes of Milan, the latter from the republic of Florence. These gold
pieces, the first that were coined in Italy, perhaps in the Latin world,
may be compared in weight and value to one third of the English guinea.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[43](daf06024.htm#fr_698.md) At the end of the
Latin version of Phranzes, we read a long Greek epistle or declamation
of George of Trebizond, who advises the emperor to prefer Eugenius and
Italy. He treats with contempt the schismatic assembly of Basil, the
Barbarians of Gaul and Germany, who had conspired to transport the chair
of St. Peter beyond the Alps. Was Constantinople unprovided with a map?

<span id="fn_699"></span>[44](daf06024.htm#fr_699.md) Syropulus (p. 26 -
31) attests his own indignation, and that of his countrymen; and the
Basil deputies, who excused the rash declaration, could neither deny nor
alter an act of the council.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[45](daf06024.htm#fr_700.md) The naval orders of
the synod were less peremptory, and, till the hostile squadrons
appeared, both parties tried to conceal their quarrel from the Greeks.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[46](daf06024.htm#fr_701.md) Syropulus mentions
the hopes of Palaeologus, (p. 36,) and the last advice of Sigismond,(p.
57.) At Corfu, the Greek emperor was informed of his friend's death; had
he known it sooner, he would have returned home,(p. 79.)

<span id="fn_702"></span>[47](daf06024.htm#fr_702.md) Phranzes himself,
though from different motives, was of the advice of Amurath, (l. ii. c.
13.) Utinam ne synodus ista unquam fuisset, si tantes offensiones et
detrimenta paritura erat. This Turkish embassy is likewise mentioned by
Syropulus, (p. 58;) and Amurath kept his word. He might threaten, (p.
125, 219,) but he never attacked, the city.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[48](daf06024.htm#fr_703.md) The reader will smile
at the simplicity with which he imparted these hopes to his favorites
(p. 92.) Yet it would have been difficult for him to have practised the
lessons of Gregory VII.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[49](daf06024.htm#fr_704.md) The Christian name of
Sylvester is borrowed from the Latin calendar. In modern Greek, as a
diminutive, is added to the end of words: nor can any reasoning of
Creyghton, the editor, excuse his changing into Sguropulus, (Sguros,
fuscus,) the Syropulus of his own manuscript, whose name is subscribed
with his own hand in the acts of the council of Florence. Why might not
the author be of Syrian extraction?

<span id="fn_705"></span>[50](daf06024.htm#fr_705.md) From the conclusion
of the history, I should fix the date to the year 1444, four years after
the synod, when great ecclesiarch had abdicated his office, (section
xii. p. 330 - 350.) His passions were cooled by time and retirement;
and, although Syropulus is often partial, he is never intemperate.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[51](daf06024.htm#fr_706.md) Vera historia unionis
non veroe inter Graecos et Latinos, (Hagae Comitis, 1660, in folio,) was
first published with a loose and florid version, by Robert Creyghton,
chaplain to Charles II. in his exile. The zeal of the editor has
prefixed a polemic title, for the beginning of the original is wanting.
Syropulus may be ranked with the best of the Byzantine writers for the
merit of his narration, and even of his style; but he is excluded from
the orthodox collections of the councils.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[52](daf06024.htm#fr_707) Syropulus (p. 63.md)
simply expresses his intention; and the Latin of Creyghton may afford a
specimen of his florid paraphrase. Ut pompa circumductus noster
Imperator Italiae populis aliquis deauratus Jupiter crederetur, aut
Croesus ex opulenta Lydia.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[53](daf06024.htm#fr_708.md) Although I cannot
stop to quote Syropulus for every fact, I will observe that the
navigation of the Greeks from Constantinople to Venice and Ferrara is
contained in the ivth section, (p. 67 - 100,) and that the historian has
the uncommon talent of placing each scene before the reader's eye.
