### Chapter LVII: The Turks. Part III.

The greatness and unity of the Turkish empire expired in the person of
Malek Shah. His vacant throne was disputed by his brother and his four
sons;  <span id="fr_1157"></span>[!\_0054](#fn_1157.md) and, after a series
of civil wars, the treaty which reconciled the surviving candidates
confirmed a lasting separation in the Persian dynasty, the eldest and
principal branch of the house of Seljuk. The three younger dynasties
were those of Kerman, of Syria, and of Roum: the first of these
commanded an extensive, though obscure,  <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[47](#fn_1158.md) dominion on the shores of the Indian
Ocean:  <span id="fr_1159"></span>[48](#fn_1159.md) the second expelled the
Arabian princes of Aleppo and Damascus; and the third, our peculiar
care, invaded the Roman provinces of Asia Minor. The generous policy of
Malek contributed to their elevation: he allowed the princes of his
blood, even those whom he had vanquished in the field, to seek new
kingdoms worthy of their ambition; nor was he displeased that they
should draw away the more ardent spirits, who might have disturbed the
tranquillity of his reign. As the supreme head of his family and nation,
the great sultan of Persia commanded the obedience and tribute of his
royal brethren: the thrones of Kerman and Nice, of Aleppo and Damascus;
the Atabeks, and emirs of Syria and Mesopotamia, erected their standards
under the shadow of his sceptre:  <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[49](#fn_1160.md) and the hordes of Turkmans overspread
the plains of the Western Asia. After the death of Malek, the bands of
union and subordination were relaxed and finally dissolved: the
indulgence of the house of Seljuk invested their slaves with the
inheritance of kingdoms; and, in the Oriental style, a crowd of princes
arose from the dust of their feet.  <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[50](#fn_1161.md)

A prince of the royal line, Cutulmish,  <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[\*\_0055](#fn_1162.md) the son of Izrail, the son of
Seljuk, had fallen in a battle against Alp Arslan and the humane victor
had dropped a tear over his grave. His five sons, strong in arms,
ambitious of power, and eager for revenge, unsheathed their cimeters
against the son of Alp Arslan. The two armies expected the signal when
the caliph, forgetful of the majesty which secluded him from vulgar
eyes, interposed his venerable mediation. "Instead of shedding the blood
of your brethren, your brethren both in descent and faith, unite your
forces in a holy war against the Greeks, the enemies of God and his
apostle." They listened to his voice; the sultan embraced his rebellious
kinsmen; and the eldest, the valiant Soliman, accepted the royal
standard, which gave him the free conquest and hereditary command of the
provinces of the Roman empire, from Arzeroum to Constantinople, and the
unknown regions of the West.  <span id="fr_1163"></span>[51](#fn_1163.md)
Accompanied by his four brothers, he passed the Euphrates; the Turkish
camp was soon seated in the neighborhood of Kutaieh in Phrygia; and his
flying cavalry laid waste the country as far as the Hellespont and the
Black Sea. Since the decline of the empire, the peninsula of Asia Minor
had been exposed to the transient, though destructive, inroads of the
Persians and Saracens; but the fruits of a lasting conquest were
reserved for the Turkish sultan; and his arms were introduced by the
Greeks, who aspired to reign on the ruins of their country. Since the
captivity of Romanus, six years the feeble son of Eudocia had trembled
under the weight of the Imperial crown, till the provinces of the East
and West were lost in the same month by a double rebellion: of either
chief Nicephorus was the common name; but the surnames of Bryennius and
Botoniates distinguish the European and Asiatic candidates. Their
reasons, or rather their promises, were weighed in the Divan; and, after
some hesitation, Soliman declared himself in favor of Botoniates, opened
a free passage to his troops in their march from Antioch to Nice, and
joined the banner of the Crescent to that of the Cross. After his ally
had ascended the throne of Constantinople, the sultan was hospitably
entertained in the suburb of Chrysopolis or Scutari; and a body of two
thousand Turks was transported into Europe, to whose dexterity and
courage the new emperor was indebted for the defeat and captivity of his
rival, Bryennius. But the conquest of Europe was dearly purchased by the
sacrifice of Asia: Constantinople was deprived of the obedience and
revenue of the provinces beyond the Bosphorus and Hellespont; and the
regular progress of the Turks, who fortified the passes of the rivers
and mountains, left not a hope of their retreat or expulsion. Another
candidate implored the aid of the sultan: Melissenus, in his purple
robes and red buskins, attended the motions of the Turkish camp; and the
desponding cities were tempted by the summons of a Roman prince, who
immediately surrendered them into the hands of the Barbarians. These
acquisitions were confirmed by a treaty of peace with the emperor
Alexius: his fear of Robert compelled him to seek the friendship of
Soliman; and it was not till after the sultan's death that he extended
as far as Nicomedia, about sixty miles from Constantinople, the eastern
boundary of the Roman world. Trebizond alone, defended on either side by
the sea and mountains, preserved at the extremity of the Euxine the
ancient character of a Greek colony, and the future destiny of a
Christian empire.

Since the first conquests of the caliphs, the establishment of the Turks
in Anatolia or Asia Minor was the most deplorable loss which the church
and empire had sustained. By the propagation of the Moslem faith,
Soliman deserved the name of Gazi, a holy champion; and his new
kingdoms, of the Romans, or of Roum, was added to the tables of Oriental
geography. It is described as extending from the Euphrates to
Constantinople, from the Black Sea to the confines of Syria; pregnant
with mines of silver and iron, of alum and copper, fruitful in corn and
wine, and productive of cattle and excellent horses.  <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[52](#fn_1164.md) The wealth of Lydia, the arts of the
Greeks, the splendor of the Augustan age, existed only in books and
ruins, which were equally obscure in the eyes of the Scythian
conquerors. Yet, in the present decay, Anatolia still contains some
wealthy and populous cities; and, under the Byzantine empire, they were
far more flourishing in numbers, size, and opulence. By the choice of
the sultan, Nice, the metropolis of Bithynia, was preferred for his
palace and fortress: the seat of the Seljukian dynasty of Roum was
planted one hundred miles from Constantinople; and the divinity of
Christ was denied and derided in the same temple in which it had been
pronounced by the first general synod of the Catholics. The unity of
God, and the mission of Mahomet, were preached in the moschs; the
Arabian learning was taught in the schools; the Cadhis judged according
to the law of the Koran; the Turkish manners and language prevailed in
the cities; and Turkman camps were scattered over the plains and
mountains of Anatolia. On the hard conditions of tribute and servitude,
the Greek Christians might enjoy the exercise of their religion; but
their most holy churches were profaned; their priests and bishops were
insulted;  <span id="fr_1165"></span>[53](#fn_1165.md) they were compelled
to suffer the triumph of the Pagans, and the apostasy of their brethren;
many thousand children were marked by the knife of circumcision; and
many thousand captives were devoted to the service or the pleasures of
their masters.  <span id="fr_1166"></span>[54](#fn_1166.md) After the loss
of Asia, Antioch still maintained her primitive allegiance to Christ and
Caesar; but the solitary province was separated from all Roman aid, and
surrounded on all sides by the Mahometan powers. The despair of
Philaretus the governor prepared the sacrifice of his religion and
loyalty, had not his guilt been prevented by his son, who hastened to
the Nicene palace, and offered to deliver this valuable prize into the
hands of Soliman. The ambitious sultan mounted on horseback, and in
twelve nights (for he reposed in the day) performed a march of six
hundred miles. Antioch was oppressed by the speed and secrecy of his
enterprise; and the dependent cities, as far as Laodicea and the
confines of Aleppo,  <span id="fr_1167"></span>[55](#fn_1167.md) obeyed the
example of the metropolis. From Laodicea to the Thracian Bosphorus, or
arm of St. George, the conquests and reign of Soliman extended thirty
days' journey in length, and in breadth about ten or fifteen, between
the rocks of Lycia and the Black Sea.  <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[56](#fn_1168.md) The Turkish ignorance of navigation
protected, for a while, the inglorious safety of the emperor; but no
sooner had a fleet of two hundred ships been constructed by the hands of
the captive Greeks, than Alexius trembled behind the walls of his
capital. His plaintive epistles were dispersed over Europe, to excite
the compassion of the Latins, and to paint the danger, the weakness, and
the riches of the city of Constantine.  <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[57](#fn_1169.md)

But the most interesting conquest of the Seljukian Turks was that of
Jerusalem,  <span id="fr_1170"></span>[58](#fn_1170.md) which soon became
the theatre of nations. In their capitulation with Omar, the inhabitants
had stipulated the assurance of their religion and property; but the
articles were interpreted by a master against whom it was dangerous to
dispute; and in the four hundred years of the reign of the caliphs, the
political climate of Jerusalem was exposed to the vicissitudes of storm
and sunshine.  <span id="fr_1171"></span>[59](#fn_1171.md) By the increase
of proselytes and population, the Mahometans might excuse the usurpation
of three fourths of the city: but a peculiar quarter was resolved for
the patriarch with his clergy and people; a tribute of two pieces of
gold was the price of protection; and the sepulchre of Christ, with the
church of the Resurrection, was still left in the hands of his votaries.
Of these votaries, the most numerous and respectable portion were
strangers to Jerusalem: the pilgrimages to the Holy Land had been
stimulated, rather than suppressed, by the conquest of the Arabs; and
the enthusiasm which had always prompted these perilous journeys, was
nourished by the congenial passions of grief and indignation. A crowd of
pilgrims from the East and West continued to visit the holy sepulchre,
and the adjacent sanctuaries, more especially at the festival of Easter;
and the Greeks and Latins, the Nestorians and Jacobites, the Copts and
Abyssinians, the Armenians and Georgians, maintained the chapels, the
clergy, and the poor of their respective communions. The harmony of
prayer in so many various tongues, the worship of so many nations in the
common temple of their religion, might have afforded a spectacle of
edification and peace; but the zeal of the Christian sects was
imbittered by hatred and revenge; and in the kingdom of a suffering
Messiah, who had pardoned his enemies, they aspired to command and
persecute their spiritual brethren. The preeminence was asserted by the
spirit and numbers of the Franks; and the greatness of Charlemagne
 <span id="fr_1172"></span>[60](#fn_1172.md) protected both the Latin
pilgrims and the Catholics of the East. The poverty of Carthage,
Alexandria, and Jerusalem, was relieved by the alms of that pious
emperor; and many monasteries of Palestine were founded or restored by
his liberal devotion. Harun Alrashid, the greatest of the Abbassides,
esteemed in his Christian brother a similar supremacy of genius and
power: their friendship was cemented by a frequent intercourse of gifts
and embassies; and the caliph, without resigning the substantial
dominion, presented the emperor with the keys of the holy sepulchre, and
perhaps of the city of Jerusalem. In the decline of the Carlovingian
monarchy, the republic of Amalphi promoted the interest of trade and
religion in the East. Her vessels transported the Latin pilgrims to the
coasts of Egypt and Palestine, and deserved, by their useful imports,
the favor and alliance of the Fatimite caliphs:  <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[61](#fn_1173.md) an annual fair was instituted on
Mount Calvary: and the Italian merchants founded the convent and
hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, the cradle of the monastic and
military order, which has since reigned in the isles of Rhodes and of
Malta. Had the Christian pilgrims been content to revere the tomb of a
prophet, the disciples of Mahomet, instead of blaming, would have
imitated, their piety: but these rigid Unitarians were scandalized by a
worship which represents the birth, death, and resurrection, of a God;
the Catholic images were branded with the name of idols; and the Moslems
smiled with indignation  <span id="fr_1174"></span>[62](#fn_1174.md) at the
miraculous flame which was kindled on the eve of Easter in the holy
sepulchre.  <span id="fr_1175"></span>[63](#fn_1175.md) This pious fraud,
first devised in the ninth century,  <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[64](#fn_1176.md) was devoutly cherished by the Latin
crusaders, and is annually repeated by the clergy of the Greek,
Armenian, and Coptic sects,  <span id="fr_1177"></span>[65](#fn_1177.md)
who impose on the credulous spectators  <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[66](#fn_1178.md) for their own benefit, and that of
their tyrants. In every age, a principle of toleration has been
fortified by a sense of interest: and the revenue of the prince and his
emir was increased each year, by the expense and tribute of so many
thousand strangers.

The revolution which transferred the sceptre from the Abbassides to the
Fatimites was a benefit, rather than an injury, to the Holy Land. A
sovereign resident in Egypt was more sensible of the importance of
Christian trade; and the emirs of Palestine were less remote from the
justice and power of the throne. But the third of these Fatimite caliphs
was the famous Hakem,  <span id="fr_1179"></span>[67](#fn_1179.md) a
frantic youth, who was delivered by his impiety and despotism from the
fear either of God or man; and whose reign was a wild mixture of vice
and folly. Regardless of the most ancient customs of Egypt, he imposed
on the women an absolute confinement; the restraint excited the clamors
of both sexes; their clamors provoked his fury; a part of Old Cairo was
delivered to the flames and the guards and citizens were engaged many
days in a bloody conflict. At first the caliph declared himself a
zealous Mussulman, the founder or benefactor of moschs and colleges:
twelve hundred and ninety copies of the Koran were transcribed at his
expense in letters of gold; and his edict extirpated the vineyards of
the Upper Egypt. But his vanity was soon flattered by the hope of
introducing a new religion; he aspired above the fame of a prophet, and
styled himself the visible image of the Most High God, who, after nine
apparitions on earth, was at length manifest in his royal person. At the
name of Hakem, the lord of the living and the dead, every knee was bent
in religious adoration: his mysteries were performed on a mountain near
Cairo: sixteen thousand converts had signed his profession of faith; and
at the present hour, a free and warlike people, the Druses of Mount
Libanus, are persuaded of the life and divinity of a madman and tyrant.
 <span id="fr_1180"></span>[68](#fn_1180.md) In his divine character, Hakem
hated the Jews and Christians, as the servants of his rivals; while some
remains of prejudice or prudence still pleaded in favor of the law of
Mahomet. Both in Egypt and Palestine, his cruel and wanton persecution
made some martyrs and many apostles: the common rights and special
privileges of the sectaries were equally disregarded; and a general
interdict was laid on the devotion of strangers and natives. The temple
of the Christian world, the church of the Resurrection, was demolished
to its foundations; the luminous prodigy of Easter was interrupted, and
much profane labor was exhausted to destroy the cave in the rock which
properly constitutes the holy sepulchre. At the report of this
sacrilege, the nations of Europe were astonished and afflicted: but
instead of arming in the defence of the Holy Land, they contented
themselves with burning, or banishing, the Jews, as the secret advisers
of the impious Barbarian.  <span id="fr_1181"></span>[69](#fn_1181.md) Yet
the calamities of Jerusalem were in some measure alleviated by the
inconstancy or repentance of Hakem himself; and the royal mandate was
sealed for the restitution of the churches, when the tyrant was
assassinated by the emissaries of his sister. The succeeding caliphs
resumed the maxims of religion and policy: a free toleration was again
granted; with the pious aid of the emperor of Constantinople, the holy
sepulchre arose from its ruins; and, after a short abstinence, the
pilgrims returned with an increase of appetite to the spiritual feast.
 <span id="fr_1182"></span>[70](#fn_1182.md) In the sea-voyage of
Palestine, the dangers were frequent, and the opportunities rare: but
the conversion of Hungary opened a safe communication between Germany
and Greece. The charity of St. Stephen, the apostle of his kingdom,
relieved and conducted his itinerant brethren;  <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[71](#fn_1183.md) and from Belgrade to Antioch, they
traversed fifteen hundred miles of a Christian empire. Among the Franks,
the zeal of pilgrimage prevailed beyond the example of former times: and
the roads were covered with multitudes of either sex, and of every rank,
who professed their contempt of life, so soon as they should have kissed
the tomb of their Redeemer. Princes and prelates abandoned the care of
their dominions; and the numbers of these pious caravans were a prelude
to the armies which marched in the ensuing age under the banner of the
cross. About thirty years before the first crusade, the arch bishop of
Mentz, with the bishops of Utrecht, Bamberg, and Ratisbon, undertook
this laborious journey from the Rhine to the Jordan; and the multitude
of their followers amounted to seven thousand persons. At
Constantinople, they were hospitably entertained by the emperor; but the
ostentation of their wealth provoked the assault of the wild Arabs: they
drew their swords with scrupulous reluctance, and sustained siege in the
village of Capernaum, till they were rescued by the venal protection of
the Fatimite emir. After visiting the holy places, they embarked for
Italy, but only a remnant of two thousand arrived in safety in their
native land. Ingulphus, a secretary of William the Conqueror, was a
companion of this pilgrimage: he observes that they sailed from
Normandy, thirty stout and well-appointed horsemen; but that they
repassed the Alps, twenty miserable palmers, with the staff in their
hand, and the wallet at their back.  <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[72](#fn_1184.md)

After the defeat of the Romans, the tranquillity of the Fatimite caliphs
was invaded by the Turks.  <span id="fr_1185"></span>[73](#fn_1185.md) One
of the lieutenants of Malek Shah, Atsiz the Carizmian, marched into
Syria at the head of a powerful army, and reduced Damascus by famine and
the sword. Hems, and the other cities of the province, acknowledged the
caliph of Bagdad and the sultan of Persia; and the victorious emir
advanced without resistance to the banks of the Nile: the Fatimite was
preparing to fly into the heart of Africa; but the negroes of his guard
and the inhabitants of Cairo made a desperate sally, and repulsed the
Turk from the confines of Egypt. In his retreat he indulged the license
of slaughter and rapine: the judge and notaries of Jerusalem were
invited to his camp; and their execution was followed by the massacre of
three thousand citizens. The cruelty or the defeat of Atsiz was soon
punished by the sultan Toucush, the brother of Malek Shah, who, with a
higher title and more formidable powers, asserted the dominion of Syria
and Palestine. The house of Seljuk reigned about twenty years in
Jerusalem;  <span id="fr_1186"></span>[74](#fn_1186.md) but the hereditary
command of the holy city and territory was intrusted or abandoned to the
emir Ortok, the chief of a tribe of Turkmans, whose children, after
their expulsion from Palestine, formed two dynasties on the borders of
Armenia and Assyria.  <span id="fr_1187"></span>[75](#fn_1187.md) The
Oriental Christians and the Latin pilgrims deplored a revolution, which,
instead of the regular government and old alliance of the caliphs,
imposed on their necks the iron yoke of the strangers of the North.
 <span id="fr_1188"></span>[76](#fn_1188.md) In his court and camp the
great sultan had adopted in some degree the arts and manners of Persia;
but the body of the Turkish nation, and more especially the pastoral
tribes, still breathed the fierceness of the desert. From Nice to
Jerusalem, the western countries of Asia were a scene of foreign and
domestic hostility; and the shepherds of Palestine, who held a
precarious sway on a doubtful frontier, had neither leisure nor capacity
to await the slow profits of commercial and religious freedom. The
pilgrims, who, through innumerable perils, had reached the gates of
Jerusalem, were the victims of private rapine or public oppression, and
often sunk under the pressure of famine and disease, before they were
permitted to salute the holy sepulchre. A spirit of native barbarism, or
recent zeal, prompted the Turkmans to insult the clergy of every sect:
the patriarch was dragged by the hair along the pavement, and cast into
a dungeon, to extort a ransom from the sympathy of his flock; and the
divine worship in the church of the Resurrection was often disturbed by
the savage rudeness of its masters. The pathetic tale excited the
millions of the West to march under the standard of the cross to the
relief of the Holy Land; and yet how trifling is the sum of these
accumulated evils, if compared with the single act of the sacrilege of
Hakem, which had been so patiently endured by the Latin Christians! A
slighter provocation inflamed the more irascible temper of their
descendants: a new spirit had arisen of religious chivalry and papal
dominion; a nerve was touched of exquisite feeling; and the sensation
vibrated to the heart of Europe.

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[51](daf05044.htm#fr_1163.md) On the conquest of
Asia Minor, M. De Guignes has derived no assistance from the Turkish or
Arabian writers, who produce a naked list of the Seljukides of Roum. The
Greeks are unwilling to expose their shame, and we must extort some
hints from Scylitzes, (p. 860, 863,) Nicephorus Bryennius, (p. 88, 91,
92, &c., 103, 104,) and Anna Comnena (Alexias, p. 91, 92, &c., 163, &c.)

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[52](daf05044.htm#fr_1164.md) Such is the

parallel passage of the same people in the present age. "Il n'est point
d'horreur que ces Turcs n'ayent commis, et semblables aux soldats
effrenes, qui dans le sac d'une ville, non contens de disposer de tout a

these Turkish conquests.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[57](daf05044.htm#fr_1169.md) In his epistle to
the count of Flanders, Alexius seems to fall too low beneath his
character and dignity; yet it is approved by Ducange, (Not. ad Alexiad.
p. 335, &c.,) and paraphrased by the Abbot Guibert, a contemporary
historian. The Greek text no longer exists; and each translator and
scribe might say with Guibert, (p. 475,) verbis vestita meis, a
privilege of most indefinite latitude.

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[58](daf05044.htm#fr_1170.md) Our best fund for
the history of Jerusalem from Heraclius to the crusades is contained in
two large and original passages of William archbishop of Tyre, (l. i. c.
1 - 10, l. xviii. c. 5, 6,) the principal author of the Gesta Dei per
Francos. M. De Guignes has composed a very learned Memoire sur le
Commerce des Francois dans le de Levant avant les Croisades, &c. (Mem.

no means contemptible: but in his account of 490 years, from the loss to
the recovery of Jerusalem, precedes the true account by 30 years.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[61](daf05044.htm#fr_1173.md) The caliph granted
his privileges, Amalphitanis viris amicis et utilium introductoribus,
(Gesta Dei, p. 934.) The trade of Venice to Egypt and Palestine cannot
produce so old a title, unless we adopt the laughable translation of a
Frenchman, who mistook the two factions of the circus (Veneti et
Prasini) for the Venetians and Parisians.

Cantacuzene presumes to appeal to the Mahometans themselves for the
truth of this perpetual miracle.

<span id="fn_1175"></span>[63](daf05044.htm#fr_1175.md) In his
Dissertations on Ecclesiastical History, the learned Mosheim has
separately discussed this pretended miracle, (tom. ii. p. 214 - 306,) de
lumine sancti sepulchri.

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[64](daf05044.htm#fr_1176.md) William of
Malmsbury (l. iv. c. 2, p. 209) quotes the Itinerary of the monk
Bernard, an eye-witness, who visited Jerusalem A.D. 870. The miracle is
confirmed by another pilgrim some years older; and Mosheim ascribes the
invention to the Franks, soon after the decease of Charlemagne.

Sandys, (p. 134,) Thevenot, (p. 621 - 627,) Maundrell, (p. 94, 95,) &c.,
describes this extravagant farce. The Catholics are puzzled to decide
when the miracle ended and the trick began.

<span id="fn_1178"></span>[66](daf05044.htm#fr_1178.md) The Orientals
themselves confess the fraud, and plead necessity and edification,
(Memoires du Chevalier D'Arvieux, tom. ii. p. 140. Joseph Abudacni,
Hist. Copt. c. 20;) but I will not attempt, with Mosheim, to explain the
mode. Our travellers have failed with the blood of St. Januarius at
Naples.

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[68](daf05044.htm#fr_1180.md) The religion of the
Druses is concealed by their ignorance and hypocrisy. Their secret
doctrines are confined to the elect who profess a contemplative life;
and the vulgar Druses, the most indifferent of men, occasionally conform
to the worship of the Mahometans and Christians of their neighborhood.
The little that is, or deserves to be, known, may be seen in the
industrious Niebuhr, (Voyages, tom. ii. p. 354 - 357,) and the second
volume of the recent and instructive Travels of M. de Volney. Note: The
religion of the Druses has, within the present year, been fully
developed from their own writings, which have long lain neglected in the
libraries of Paris and Oxford, in the "Expose de la Religion des Druses,
by M. Silvestre de Sacy." Deux tomes, Paris, 1838. The learned author
has prefixed a life of Hakem Biamr-Allah, which enables us to correct
several errors in the account of Gibbon. These errors chiefly arose from
his want of knowledge or of attention to the chronology of Hakem's life.
Hakem succeeded to the throne of Egypt in the year of the Hegira 386. He
did not assume his divinity till 408. His life was indeed "a wild
mixture of vice and folly," to which may be added, of the most
sanguinary cruelty. During his reign, 18,000 persons were victims of his
ferocity. Yet such is the god, observes M. de Sacy, whom the Druses have
worshipped for 800 years! (See p. ccccxxix.) All his wildest and most
extravagant actions were interpreted by his followers as having a mystic
and allegoric meaning, alluding to the destruction of other religions
and the propagation of his own. It does not seem to have been the
"vanity" of Hakem which induced him to introduce a new religion. The
curious point in the new faith is that Hamza, the son of Ali, the real
founder of the Unitarian religion, (such is its boastful title,) was
content to take a secondary part. While Hakem was God, the one Supreme,
the Imam Hamza was his Intelligence. It was not in his "divine
character" that Hakem "hated the Jews and Christians," but in that of a
Mahometan bigot, which he displayed in the earlier years of his reign.
His barbarous persecution, and the burning of the church of the
Resurrection at Jerusalem, belong entirely to that period; and his
assumption of divinity was followed by an edict of toleration to Jews
and Christians. The Mahometans, whose religion he then treated with
hostility and contempt, being far the most numerous, were his most
dangerous enemies, and therefore the objects of his most inveterate
hatred. It is another singular fact, that the religion of Hakem was by
no means confined to Egypt and Syria. M. de Sacy quotes a letter
addressed to the chief of the sect in India; and there is likewise a
letter to the Byzantine emperor Constantine, son of Armanous, (Romanus,)
and the clergy of the empire. (Constantine VIII., M. de Sacy supposes,
but this is irreconcilable with chronology; it must mean Constantine
XI., Monomachus.) The assassination of Hakem is, of course, disbelieved
by his sectaries. M. de Sacy seems to consider the fact obscure and
doubtful. According to his followers he disappeared, but is hereafter to
return. At his return the resurrection is to take place; the triumph of
Unitarianism, and the final discomfiture of all other religions. The
temple of Mecca is especially devoted to destruction. It is remarkable
that one of the signs of this final consummation, and of the
reappearance of Hakem, is that Christianity shall be gaining a manifest
predominance over Mahometanism.

As for the religion of the Druses, I cannot agree with Gibbon that it
does not "deserve" to be better known; and am grateful to M. de Sacy,
notwithstanding the prolixity and occasional repetition in his two large
volumes, for the full examination of the most extraordinary religious
aberration which ever extensively affected the mind of man. The worship
of a mad tyrant is the basis of a subtle metaphysical creed, and of a
severe, and even ascetic, morality. - M.

asserts, that Jerusalem was thirty-eight years in the hands of the
Turks; and an Arabic chronicle, quoted by Pagi, (tom. iv. p. 202)
supposes that the city was reduced by a Carizmian general to the
obedience of the caliph of Bagdad, A. H. 463, A.D. 1070. These early
dates are not very compatible with the general history of Asia; and I am
sure, that as late as A.D. 1064, the regnum Babylonicum (of Cairo) still
prevailed in Palestine, (Baronius, A.D. 1064, No. 56.)
