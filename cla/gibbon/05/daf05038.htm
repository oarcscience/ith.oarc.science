<p>     The Normans of Apulia were seated on the verge of the two empires; and, according to the policy of the hour, they accepted the investiture of their lands, from the sovereigns of Germany or Constantinople.  But the firmest title of these adventurers was the right of conquest: they neither loved nor trusted; they were neither trusted nor beloved: the contempt of the princes was mixed with fear, and the fear of the natives was mingled with hatred and resentment.  Every object of desire, a horse, a woman, a garden, tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of the strangers; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_991"></A><A HREF="#fn_991"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> and the avarice of their chiefs was only colored by the more specious names of ambition and glory.  The twelve counts were sometimes joined in the league of injustice: in their domestic quarrels they disputed the spoils of the people: the virtues of William were buried in his grave; and Drogo, his brother and successor, was better qualified to lead the valor, than to restrain the violence, of his peers.  Under the reign of Constantine Monomachus, the policy, rather than benevolence, of the Byzantine court, attempted to relieve Italy from this adherent mischief, more grievous than a flight of Barbarians; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_992"></A><A HREF="#fn_992"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A> and Argyrus, the son of Melo, was invested for this purpose with the most lofty titles &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_993"></A><A HREF="#fn_993"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> and the most ample commission. The memory of his father might recommend him to the Normans; and he had already engaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt of Maniaces, and to avenge their own and the public injury.  It was the design of Constantine to transplant the warlike colony from the Italian provinces to the Persian war; and the son of Melo distributed among the chiefs the gold and manufactures of Greece, as the first-fruits of the Imperial bounty. But his arts were baffled by the sense and spirit of the conquerors of Apulia: his gifts, or at least his proposals, were rejected; and they unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their hopes for the distant prospect of Asiatic fortune.  After the means of persuasion had failed, Argyrus resolved to compel or to destroy: the Latin powers were solicited against the common enemy; and an offensive alliance was formed of the pope and the two emperors of the East and West.  The throne of St. Peter was occupied by Leo the Ninth, a simple saint, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_994"></A><A HREF="#fn_994"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A> of a temper most apt to deceive himself and the world, and whose venerable character would consecrate with the name of piety the measures least compatible with the practice of religion.  His humanity was affected by the complaints, perhaps the calumnies, of an injured people: the impious Normans had interrupted the payment of tithes; and the temporal sword might be lawfully unsheathed against the sacrilegious robbers, who were deaf to the censures of the church.  As a German of noble birth and royal kindred, Leo had free access to the court and confidence of the emperor Henry the Third; and in search of arms and allies, his ardent zeal transported him from Apulia to Saxony, from the Elbe to the Tyber.  During these hostile preparations, Argyrus indulged himself in the use of secret and guilty weapons: a crowd of Normans became the victims of public or private revenge; and the valiant Drogo was murdered in a church.  But his spirit survived in his brother Humphrey, the third count of Apulia.  The assassins were chastised; and the son of Melo, overthrown and wounded, was driven from the field, to hide his shame behind the walls of Bari, and to await the tardy succor of his allies. </p>

 </p> 
<p>     But the power of Constantine was distracted by a Turkish war; the mind of Henry was feeble and irresolute; and the pope, instead of repassing the Alps with a German army, was accompanied only by a guard of seven hundred Swabians and some volunteers of Lorraine.  In his long progress from Mantua to Beneventum, a vile and promiscuous multitude of Italians was enlisted under the holy standard: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_995"></A><A HREF="#fn_995"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A> the priest and the robber slept in the same tent; the pikes and crosses were intermingled in the front; and the martial saint repeated the lessons of his youth in the order of march, of encampment, and of combat.  The Normans of Apulia could muster in the field no more than three thousand horse, with a handful of infantry: the defection of the natives intercepted their provisions and retreat; and their spirit, incapable of fear, was chilled for a moment by superstitious awe.  On the hostile approach of Leo, they knelt without disgrace or reluctance before their spiritual father. But the pope was inexorable; his lofty Germans affected to deride the diminutive stature of their adversaries; and the Normans were informed that death or exile was their only alternative.  Flight they disdained, and, as many of them had been three days without tasting food, they embraced the assurance of a more easy and honorable death.  They climbed the hill of Civitella, descended into the plain, and charged in three divisions the army of the pope.  On the left, and in the centre, Richard count of Aversa, and Robert the famous Guiscard, attacked, broke, routed, and pursued the Italian multitudes, who fought without discipline, and fled without shame.  A harder trial was reserved for the valor of Count Humphrey, who led the cavalry of the right wing.  The Germans &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_996"></A><A HREF="#fn_996"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A> have been described as unskillful in the management of the horse and the lance, but on foot they formed a strong and impenetrable phalanx; and neither man, nor steed, nor armor, could resist the weight of their long and two-handed swords.  After a severe conflict, they were encompassed by the squadrons returning from the pursuit; and died in the ranks with the esteem of their foes, and the satisfaction of revenge.  The gates of Civitella were shut against the flying pope, and he was overtaken by the pious conquerors, who kissed his feet, to implore his blessing and the absolution of their sinful victory.  The soldiers beheld in their enemy and captive the vicar of Christ; and, though we may suppose the policy of the chiefs, it is probable that they were infected by the popular superstition. In the calm of retirement, the well-meaning pope deplored the effusion of Christian blood, which must be imputed to his account: he felt, that he had been the author of sin and scandal; and as his undertaking had failed, the indecency of his military character was universally condemned. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_997"></A><A HREF="#fn_997"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A> With these dispositions, he listened to the offers of a beneficial treaty; deserted an alliance which he had preached as the cause of God; and ratified the past and future conquests of the Normans.  By whatever hands they had been usurped, the provinces of Apulia and Calabria were a part of the donation of Constantine and the patrimony of St. Peter: the grant and the acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of the pontiff and the adventurers.  They promised to support each other with spiritual and temporal arms; a tribute or quitrent of twelve pence was afterwards stipulated for every ploughland; and since this memorable transaction, the kingdom of Naples has remained above seven hundred years a fief of the Holy See. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_998"></A><A HREF="#fn_998"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A> </p>

 </p> 
<p>     The pedigree of Robert of Guiscard &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_999"></A><A HREF="#fn_999"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> is variously deduced from the peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the pride and ignorance of a Grecian princess; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1000"></A><A HREF="#fn_1000"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A> from the dukes, by the ignorance and flattery of the Italian subjects. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1001"></A><A HREF="#fn_1001"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A> His genuine descent may be ascribed to the second or middle order of private nobility. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1002"></A><A HREF="#fn_1002"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A> He sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets, of the diocese of Coutances, in the Lower Normandy: the castle of Hauteville was their honorable seat: his father Tancred was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke; and his military service was furnished by ten soldiers or knights.  Two marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him the father of twelve sons, who were educated at home by the impartial tenderness of his second wife.  But a narrow patrimony was insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw around the neighborhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance.  Two only remained to perpetuate the race, and cherish their father's age: their ten brothers, as they successfully attained the vigor of manhood, departed from the castle, passed the Alps, and joined the Apulian camp of the Normans. The elder were prompted by native spirit; their success encouraged their younger brethren, and the three first in seniority, William, Drogo, and Humphrey, deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the new republic.  Robert was the eldest of the seven sons of the second marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman.  His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army: his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he maintained the patient vigor of health and the commanding dignity of his form. His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen color, his eyes sparkled with fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle.  In the ruder ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historians: they may observe that Robert, at once, and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of Civitella he was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valor from the warriors of the two armies. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1003"></A><A HREF="#fn_1003"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A> His boundless ambition was founded on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of greatness, he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and seldom moved by the feelings of humanity: though not insensible of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage.  The surname of Guiscard &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1004"></A><A HREF="#fn_1004"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> was applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and Robert is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the cunning of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero.  Yet these arts were disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers; and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country.  He grasped with a rapacious, that he might distribute with a liberal, hand: his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret treasure.  According to the Greeks, he departed from Normandy with only five followers on horseback and thirty on foot; yet even this allowance appears too bountiful: the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville passed the Alps as a pilgrim; and his first military band was levied among the adventurers of Italy.  His brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia; but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives, it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber.  To surprise a castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labors which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body.  The volunteers of Normandy adhered to his standard; and, under his command, the peasants of Calabria assumed the name and character of Normans.

<p>     As the genius of Robert expanded with his fortune, he awakened the jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient quarrel, his life was threatened and his liberty restrained.  After the death of Humphrey, the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command; they were reduced to a private estate, by the ambition of their guardian and uncle; and Guiscard was exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of Apulia and general of the republic. With an increase of authority and of force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.  By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal excommunication; but Nicholas the Second was easily persuaded that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice; that the Normans were the faithful champions of the Holy See; and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an aristocracy.  A synod of one hundred bishops was convened at Melphi; and the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees of the Roman pontiff. His gratitude and policy conferred on Robert and his posterity the ducal title, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1005"></A><A HREF="#fn_1005"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A> with the investiture of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in Italy and Sicily, which his sword could rescue from the schismatic Greeks and the unbelieving Saracens. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1006"></A><A HREF="#fn_1006"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A> This apostolic sanction might justify his arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be transferred without their consent; and Guiscard dissembled his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of Consenza and Reggio.  In the hour of triumph, he assembled his troops, and solicited the Normans to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ: the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke; and the counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation.  After this inauguration, Robert styled himself, "By the grace of God and St. Peter, duke of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;" and it was the labor of twenty years to deserve and realize these lofty appellations.  Such sardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the nation; but the Normans were few in number; their resources were scanty; their service was voluntary and precarious.  The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of his parliament of barons: the twelve counts of popular election conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious uncle, the sons of Humphrey demanded justice and revenge.  By his policy and vigor, Guiscard discovered their plots, suppressed their rebellions, and punished the guilty with death or exile: but in these domestic feuds, his years, and the national strength, were unprofitably consumed.  After the defeat of his foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, their broken forces retreated to the strong and populous cities of the sea-coast.  They excelled in the arts of fortification and defence; the Normans were accustomed to serve on horseback in the field, and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts of persevering courage.  The resistance of Salerno was maintained above eight months; the siege or blockade of Bari lasted near four years. In these actions the Norman duke was the foremost in every danger; in every fatigue the last and most patient.  As he pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge stone from the rampart shattered one of his military engines; and by a splinter he was wounded in the breast.  Before the gates of Bari, he lodged in a miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and thatched with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the inclemency of the winter and the spears of the enemy. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1007"></A><A HREF="#fn_1007"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A> </p>

 </p> 
<p>     The Italian conquests of Robert correspond with the limits of the present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of seven hundred years. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1008"></A><A HREF="#fn_1008"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A> The monarchy has been composed of the Greek provinces of Calabria and Apulia, of the Lombard principality of Salerno, the republic of Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of Beneventum.  Three districts only were exempted from the common law of subjection; the first forever, the two last till the middle of the succeeding century.  The city and immediate territory of Benevento had been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the German emperor to the Roman pontiff; and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the name of St. Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.  Their first colony of Aversa subdued and held the state of Capua; and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their fathers.  The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis, maintained the popular freedom, under the shadow of the Byzantine empire. Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of Salerno, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1009"></A><A HREF="#fn_1009"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A> and the trade of Amalphi, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1010"></A><A HREF="#fn_1010"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader. I.  Of the learned faculties, jurisprudence implies the previous establishment of laws and property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full light of religion and reason. But the savage and the sage must alike implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in the ruder ages of society.  The treasures of Grecian medicine had been communicated to the Arabian colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of peace and war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and the women beautiful. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1011"></A><A HREF="#fn_1011"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A> A school, the first that arose in the darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most eminent rank, and most distant climates, invited or visited the physicians of Salerno.  They were protected by the Norman conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, could discern the merit and value of a philosopher.  After a pilgrimage of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an African Christian, returned from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the Arabians; and Salerno was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna.  The school of medicine has long slept in the name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string of aphorisms, bound together in the Leonine verses, or Latin rhymes, of the twelfth century. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1012"></A><A HREF="#fn_1012"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A> II. Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and thirty to the south of Naples, the obscure town of Amalphi displayed the power and rewards of industry.  The land, however fertile, was of narrow extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants first assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the source of their opulence and freedom.  The government was popular, under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the Greek emperor.  Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, and the objects of precious luxury.  The mariners who swarmed in her port, excelled in the theory and practice of navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of the compass, which has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or good fortune.  Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, acquired the privileges of independent colonies. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1013"></A><A HREF="#fn_1013"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A> After three hundred years of prosperity, Amalphi was oppressed by the arms of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty of one thousand &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1014"></A><A HREF="#fn_1014"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0047</FONT></A> fisherman is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral, and the palaces of royal merchants. </p>

<P><A NAME="fn_991"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_991">29</A> The biographer of St. Leo IX. pours his holy venom on the Normans.  Videns indisciplinatam et alienam gentem Normannorum, crudeli et inaudita rabie, et plusquam Pagana impietate, adversus ecclesias Dei insurgere, passim Christianos trucidare, &c., (Wibert, c. 6.) The honest Apulian (l. ii. p. 259) says calmly of their accuser, Veris commiscens fallacia.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_992"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_992">30</A> The policy of the Greeks, revolt of Maniaces, &c., must be collected from Cedrenus, (tom. ii. p. 757, 758,) William Appulus, (l. i. p 257, 258, l. ii. p. 259,) and the two Chronicles of Bari, by Lupus Protospata, (Muratori, Script. Ital. tom. v. p. 42, 43, 44,) and an anonymous writer, (Antiquitat, Italiae Medii Aevi, tom. i. p 31 - 35.) This last is a fragment of some value.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_993"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_993">31</A> Argyrus received, says the anonymous Chronicle of Bari, Imperial letters, Foederatus et Patriciatus, et Catapani et Vestatus.  In his Annals, Muratori (tom. viii. p. 426) very properly reads, or interprets, Sevestatus, the title of Sebastos or Augustus.  But in his Antiquities, he was taught by Ducange to make it a palatine office, master of the wardrobe.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_994"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_994">32</A> A Life of St. Leo IX., deeply tinged with the passions and prejudices of the age, has been composed by Wibert, printed at Paris, 1615, in octavo, and since inserted in the Collections of the Bollandists, of Mabillon, and of Muratori.  The public and private history of that pope is diligently treated by M. de St. Marc.  (Abrege, tom. ii. p. 140 - 210, and p. 25 - 95, second column.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_995"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_995">33</A> See the expedition of Leo XI. against the Normans.  See William Appulus (l. ii. p. 259 - 261) and Jeffrey Malaterra (l. i. c. 13, 14, 15, p. 253.) They are impartial, as the national is counterbalanced by the clerical prejudice</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_996"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_996">34</A>  Teutonici, quia caesaries et forma decoros                Fecerat egregie proceri corporis illos                Corpora derident Normannica quae breviora                Esse videbantur. </p> 
<p>The verses of the Apulian are commonly in this strain, though he heats himself a little in the battle.  Two of his similes from hawking and sorcery are descriptive of manners.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_997"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_997">35</A> Several respectable censures or complaints are produced by M. de St. Marc, (tom. ii. p. 200 - 204.) As Peter Damianus, the oracle of the times, has denied the popes the right of making war, the hermit (lugens eremi incola) is arraigned by the cardinal, and Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 1053, No. 10 - 17) most strenuously asserts the two swords of St. Peter.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_998"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_998">36</A> The origin and nature of the papal investitures are ably discussed by Giannone, (Istoria Civile di Napoli, tom. ii. p. 37 - 49, 57 - 66,) as a lawyer and antiquarian.  Yet he vainly strives to reconcile the duties of patriot and Catholic, adopts an empty distinction of "Ecclesia Romana non dedit, sed accepit," and shrinks from an honest but dangerous confession of the truth.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_999"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_999">37</A> The birth, character, and first actions of Robert Guiscard, may be found in Jeffrey Malaterra, (l. i. c. 3, 4, 11, 16, 17, 18, 38, 39, 40,) William Appulus, (l. ii. p. 260 - 262,) William Gemeticensis, or of Jumieges, (l. xi. c. 30, p. 663, 664, edit. Camden,) and Anna Comnena, (Alexiad, l. i. p. 23 - 27, l. vi. p. 165, 166,) with the annotations of Ducange, (Not. in Alexiad, p. 230 - 232, 320,) who has swept all the French and Latin Chronicles for supplemental intelligence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1000"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1000">38</A> (a Greek corruption), and elsewhere, (l. iv. p. 84,).  Anna Comnena was born in the purple; yet her father was no more than a private though illustrious subject, who raised himself to the empire.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1001"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1001">39</A> Giannone, (tom. ii. p. 2) forgets all his original authors, and rests this princely descent on the credit of Inveges, an Augustine monk of Palermo in the last century.  They continue the succession of dukes from Rollo to William II. the Bastard or Conqueror, whom they hold (communemente si tiene) to be the father of Tancred of Hauteville; a most strange and stupendous blunder!  The sons of Tancred fought in Apulia, before William II. was three years old, (A.D. 1037.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1002"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1002">40</A> The judgment of Ducange is just and moderate: Certe humilis fuit ac tenuis Roberti familia, si ducalem et regium spectemus apicem, ad quem postea pervenit; quae honesta tamen et praeter nobilium vulgarium statum et conditionem illustris habita est, "quae nec humi reperet nec altum quid tumeret." (Wilhem. Malmsbur. de Gestis Anglorum, l. iii. p. 107. Not. ad Alexiad. p. 230.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1003"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1003">41</A> I shall quote with pleasure some of the best lines of the Apulian, (l. ii. p. 270.) </p> 
<p>     Pugnat utraque manu, nec lancea cassa, nec ensis      Cassus erat, quocunque manu deducere vellet.      Ter dejectus equo, ter viribus ipse resumptis      Major in arma redit: stimulos furor ipse ministrat.      Ut Leo cum frendens, &c.      -    -    -    -    -    -    -      Nullus in hoc bello sicuti post bella probatum est      Victor vel victus, tam magnos edidit ictus.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1004"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1004">42</A> The Norman writers and editors most conversant with their own idiom interpret Guiscard or Wiscard, by Callidus, a cunning man.  The root (wise) is familiar to our ear; and in the old word Wiseacre, I can discern something of a similar sense and termination.  It is no bad translation of the surname and character of Robert.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1005"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1005">43</A> The acquisition of the ducal title by Robert Guiscard is a nice and obscure business.  With the good advice of Giannone, Muratori, and St. Marc, I have endeavored to form a consistent and probable narrative.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1006"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1006">44</A> Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 1059, No. 69) has published the original act.  He professes to have copied it from the Liber Censuum, a Vatican Ms.  Yet a Liber Censuum of the xiith century has been printed by Muratori, (Antiquit. Medii Aevi, tom. v. p. 851 - 908;) and the names of Vatican and Cardinal awaken the suspicions of a Protestant, and even of a philosopher.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1007"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1007">45</A> Read the life of Guiscard in the second and third books of the Apulian, the first and second books of Malaterra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1008"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1008">46</A> The conquests of Robert Guiscard and Roger I., the exemption of Benevento and the xii provinces of the kingdom, are fairly exposed by Giannone in the second volume of his Istoria Civile, l. ix. x. xi and l. xvii. p. 460 - 470.  This modern division was not established before the time of Frederic II.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1009"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1009">47</A> Giannone, (tom. ii. p. 119 - 127,) Muratori, (Antiquitat. Medii Aevi, tom. iii. dissert. xliv. p. 935, 936,) and Tiraboschi, (Istoria della Letteratura Italiana,) have given an historical account of these physicians; their medical knowledge and practice must be left to our physicians.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1010"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1010">48</A> At the end of the Historia Pandectarum of Henry Brenckmann, (Trajecti ad Rhenum, 1722, in 4to.,) the indefatigable author has inserted two dissertations, de Republica Amalphitana, and de Amalphi a Pisanis direpta, which are built on the testimonies of one hundred and forty writers.  Yet he has forgotten two most important passages of the embassy of Liutprand, (A.D. 939,) which compare the trade and navigation of Amalphi with that of Venice.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1011"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1011">49</A>  Urbs Latii non est hac delitiosior urbe,                Frugibus, arboribus, vinoque redundat; et unde                Non tibi poma, nuces, non pulchra palatia desunt,                Non species muliebris abest probitasque virorum.                 Gulielmus Appulus, l. iii. p. 367</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1012"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1012">50</A> Muratori carries their antiquity above the year (1066) of the death of Edward the Confessor, the rex Anglorum to whom they are addressed. Nor is this date affected by the opinion, or rather mistake, of Pasquier (Recherches de la France, l. vii. c. 2) and Ducange, (Glossar. Latin.) The practice of rhyming, as early as the viith century, was borrowed from the languages of the North and East, (Muratori, Antiquitat. tom. iii. dissert. xl. p. 686 - 708.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1013"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1013">51</A> The description of Amalphi, by William the Apulian, (l. iii. p. 267,) contains much truth and some poetry, and the third line may be applied to the sailor's compass: - </p> 
<p>     Nulla magis locuples argento, vestibus, auro      Partibus innumeris: hac plurimus urbe moratur      Nauta maris Caelique vias aperire peritus.      Huc et Alexandri diversa feruntur ab urbe      Regis, et Antiochi.  Gens haec freta plurima transit.              His Arabes, Indi, Siculi nascuntur et Afri.      Haec gens est totum proore nobilitata per orbem,      Et mercando forens, et amans mercata referre.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1014"></A><A HREF="daf05038.htm#fr_1014">*_0047</A> Amalfi had only one thousand inhabitants at the commencement of the 18th century, when it was visited by Brenckmann, (Brenckmann de Rep. Amalph. Diss. i. c. 23.) At present it has six or eight thousand Hist. des Rep. tom. i. p. 304. - G.</P>
