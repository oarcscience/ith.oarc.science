### Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs. Part VII.

I should deceive the expectation of the reader, if I passed in silence
the fate of the Alexandrian library, as it is described by the learned
Abulpharagius. The spirit of Amrou was more curious and liberal than
that of his brethren, and in his leisure hours, the Arabian chief was
pleased with the conversation of John, the last disciple of Ammonius,
and who derived the surname of Philoponus from his laborious studies of
grammar and philosophy.  <span id="fr_520"></span>[115](#fn_520.md)
Emboldened by this familiar intercourse, Philoponus presumed to solicit
a gift, inestimable in his opinion, contemptible in that of the
Barbarians - the royal library, which alone, among the spoils of
Alexandria, had not been appropriated by the visit and the seal of the
conqueror. Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian, but
his rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest object without the
consent of the caliph; and the well-known answer of Omar was inspired by
the ignorance of a fanatic. "If these writings of the Greeks agree with
the book of God, they are useless, and need not be preserved: if they
disagree, they are pernicious, and ought to be destroyed." The sentence
was executed with blind obedience: the volumes of paper or parchment
were distributed to the four thousand baths of the city; and such was
their incredible multitude, that six months were barely sufficient for
the consumption of this precious fuel. Since the Dynasties of
Abulpharagius  <span id="fr_521"></span>[116](#fn_521.md) have been given
to the world in a Latin version, the tale has been repeatedly
transcribed; and every scholar, with pious indignation, has deplored the
irreparable shipwreck of the learning, the arts, and the genius, of
antiquity. For my own part, I am strongly tempted to deny both the fact
and the consequences.  <span id="fr_522"></span>[\*\_0035](#fn_522.md) The
fact is indeed marvellous. "Read and wonder!" says the historian
himself: and the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at the end of
six hundred years on the confines of Media, is overbalanced by the
silence of two annalist of a more early date, both Christians, both
natives of Egypt, and the most ancient of whom, the patriarch Eutychius,
has amply described the conquest of Alexandria.  <span
id="fr_523"></span>[117](#fn_523.md) The rigid sentence of Omar is
repugnant to the sound and orthodox precept of the Mahometan casuists
they expressly declare, that the religious books of the Jews and
Christians, which are acquired by the right of war, should never be
committed to the flames; and that the works of profane science,
historians or poets, physicians or philosophers, may be lawfully applied
to the use of the faithful.  <span id="fr_524"></span>[118](#fn_524.md) A
more destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first successors
of Mahomet; yet in this instance, the conflagration would have speedily
expired in the deficiency of materials. I should not recapitulate the
disasters of the Alexandrian library, the involuntary flame that was
kindled by Caesar in his own defence,  <span
id="fr_525"></span>[119](#fn_525.md) or the mischievous bigotry of the
Christians, who studied to destroy the monuments of idolatry.  <span
id="fr_526"></span>[120](#fn_526.md) But if we gradually descend from the
age of the Antonines to that of Theodosius, we shall learn from a chain
of contemporary witnesses, that the royal palace and the temple of
Serapis no longer contained the four, or the seven, hundred thousand
volumes, which had been assembled by the curiosity and magnificence of
the Ptolemies.  <span id="fr_527"></span>[121](#fn_527.md) Perhaps the
church and seat of the patriarchs might be enriched with a repository of
books; but if the ponderous mass of Arian and Monophysite controversy
were indeed consumed in the public baths,  <span
id="fr_528"></span>[122](#fn_528.md) a philosopher may allow, with a smile,
that it was ultimately devoted to the benefit of mankind. I sincerely
regret the more valuable libraries which have been involved in the ruin
of the Roman empire; but when I seriously compute the lapse of ages, the
waste of ignorance, and the calamities of war, our treasures, rather
than our losses, are the objects of my surprise. Many curious and
interesting facts are buried in oblivion: the three great historians of
Rome have been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state, and we are
deprived of many pleasing compositions of the lyric, iambic, and
dramatic poetry of the Greeks. Yet we should gratefully remember, that
the mischances of time and accident have spared the classic works to
which the suffrage of antiquity  <span id="fr_529"></span>[123](#fn_529.md)
had adjudged the first place of genius and glory: the teachers of
ancient knowledge, who are still extant, had perused and compared the
writings of their predecessors;  <span id="fr_530"></span>[124](#fn_530.md)
nor can it fairly be presumed that any important truth, any useful
discovery in art or nature, has been snatched away from the curiosity of
modern ages.

In the administration of Egypt,  <span id="fr_531"></span>[125](#fn_531.md)
Amrou balanced the demands of justice and policy; the interest of the
people of the law, who were defended by God; and of the people of the
alliance, who were protected by man. In the recent tumult of conquest
and deliverance, the tongue of the Copts and the sword of the Arabs were
most adverse to the tranquillity of the province. To the former, Amrou
declared, that faction and falsehood would be doubly chastised; by the
punishment of the accusers, whom he should detest as his personal
enemies, and by the promotion of their innocent brethren, whom their
envy had labored to injure and supplant. He excited the latter by the
motives of religion and honor to sustain the dignity of their character,
to endear themselves by a modest and temperate conduct to God and the
caliph, to spare and protect a people who had trusted to their faith,
and to content themselves with the legitimate and splendid rewards of
their victory. In the management of the revenue, he disapproved the
simple but oppressive mode of a capitation, and preferred with reason a
proportion of taxes deducted on every branch from the clear profits of
agriculture and commerce. A third part of the tribute was appropriated
to the annual repairs of the dikes and canals, so essential to the
public welfare. Under his administration, the fertility of Egypt
supplied the dearth of Arabia; and a string of camels, laden with corn
and provisions, covered almost without an interval the long road from
Memphis to Medina.  <span id="fr_532"></span>[126](#fn_532.md) But the
genius of Amrou soon renewed the maritime communication which had been
attempted or achieved by the Pharaohs the Ptolemies, or the Caesars; and
a canal, at least eighty miles in length, was opened from the Nile to
the Red Sea.  <span id="fr_533"></span>[\*\_0036](#fn_533.md) This inland
navigation, which would have joined the Mediterranean and the Indian
Ocean, was soon discontinued as useless and dangerous: the throne was
removed from Medina to Damascus, and the Grecian fleets might have
explored a passage to the holy cities of Arabia.  <span
id="fr_534"></span>[127](#fn_534.md)

Of his new conquest, the caliph Omar had an imperfect knowledge from the
voice of fame and the legends of the Koran. He requested that his
lieutenant would place before his eyes the realm of Pharaoh and the
Amalekites; and the answer of Amrou exhibits a lively and not unfaithful
picture of that singular country.  <span
id="fr_535"></span>[128](#fn_535.md) "O commander of the faithful, Egypt is
a compound of black earth and green plants, between a pulverized
mountain and a red sand. The distance from Syene to the sea is a month's
journey for a horseman. Along the valley descends a river, on which the
blessing of the Most High reposes both in the evening and morning, and
which rises and falls with the revolutions of the sun and moon. When the
annual dispensation of Providence unlocks the springs and fountains that
nourish the earth, the Nile rolls his swelling and sounding waters
through the realm of Egypt: the fields are overspread by the salutary
flood; and the villages communicate with each other in their painted
barks. The retreat of the inundation deposits a fertilizing mud for the
reception of the various seeds: the crowds of husbandmen who blacken the
land may be compared to a swarm of industrious ants; and their native
indolence is quickened by the lash of the task-master, and the promise
of the flowers and fruits of a plentiful increase. Their hope is seldom
deceived; but the riches which they extract from the wheat, the barley,
and the rice, the legumes, the fruit-trees, and the cattle, are
unequally shared between those who labor and those who possess.
According to the vicissitudes of the seasons, the face of the country is
adorned with a silver wave, a verdant emerald, and the deep yellow of a
golden harvest."  <span id="fr_536"></span>[129](#fn_536.md) Yet this
beneficial order is sometimes interrupted; and the long delay and sudden
swell of the river in the first year of the conquest might afford some
color to an edifying fable. It is said, that the annual sacrifice of a
virgin  <span id="fr_537"></span>[130](#fn_537.md) had been interdicted by
the piety of Omar; and that the Nile lay sullen and inactive in his
shallow bed, till the mandate of the caliph was cast into the obedient
stream, which rose in a single night to the height of sixteen cubits.
The admiration of the Arabs for their new conquest encouraged the
license of their romantic spirit. We may read, in the gravest authors,
that Egypt was crowded with twenty thousand cities or villages:  <span
id="fr_538"></span>[131](#fn_538.md) that, exclusive of the Greeks and
Arabs, the Copts alone were found, on the assessment, six millions of
tributary subjects,  <span id="fr_539"></span>[132](#fn_539.md) or twenty
millions of either sex, and of every age: that three hundred millions of
gold or silver were annually paid to the treasury of the caliphs.  <span
id="fr_540"></span>[133](#fn_540.md) Our reason must be startled by these
extravagant assertions; and they will become more palpable, if we assume
the compass and measure the extent of habitable ground: a valley from
the tropic to Memphis seldom broader than twelve miles, and the triangle
of the Delta, a flat surface of two thousand one hundred square leagues,
compose a twelfth part of the magnitude of France.  <span
id="fr_541"></span>[134](#fn_541.md) A more accurate research will justify
a more reasonable estimate. The three hundred millions, created by the
error of a scribe, are reduced to the decent revenue of four millions
three hundred thousand pieces of gold, of which nine hundred thousand
were consumed by the pay of the soldiers.  <span
id="fr_542"></span>[135](#fn_542.md) Two authentic lists, of the present
and of the twelfth century, are circumscribed within the respectable
number of two thousand seven hundred villages and towns.  <span
id="fr_543"></span>[136](#fn_543.md) After a long residence at Cairo, a
French consul has ventured to assign about four millions of Mahometans,
Christians, and Jews, for the ample, though not incredible, scope of the
population of Egypt.  <span id="fr_544"></span>[137](#fn_544.md)

IV\. The conquest of Africa, from the Nile to the Atlantic Ocean,  <span
id="fr_545"></span>[138](#fn_545.md) was first attempted by the arms of the
caliph Othman. The pious design was approved by the companions of
Mahomet and the chiefs of the tribes; and twenty thousand Arabs marched
from Medina, with the gifts and the blessing of the commander of the
faithful. They were joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty thousand of
their countrymen; and the conduct of the war was intrusted to Abdallah,
 <span id="fr_546"></span>[139](#fn_546.md) the son of Said and the
foster-brother of the caliph, who had lately supplanted the conqueror
and lieutenant of Egypt. Yet the favor of the prince, and the merit of
his favorite, could not obliterate the guilt of his apostasy. The early
conversion of Abdallah, and his skilful pen, had recommended him to the
important office of transcribing the sheets of the Koran: he betrayed
his trust, corrupted the text, derided the errors which he had made, and
fled to Mecca to escape the justice, and expose the ignorance, of the
apostle. After the conquest of Mecca, he fell prostrate at the feet of
Mahomet; his tears, and the entreaties of Othman, extorted a reluctant
pardon; out the prophet declared that he had so long hesitated, to allow
time for some zealous disciple to avenge his injury in the blood of the
apostate. With apparent fidelity and effective merit, he served the
religion which it was no longer his interest to desert: his birth and
talents gave him an honorable rank among the Koreish; and, in a nation
of cavalry, Abdallah was renowned as the boldest and most dexterous
horseman of Arabia. At the head of forty thousand Moslems, he advanced
from Egypt into the unknown countries of the West. The sands of Barca
might be impervious to a Roman legion but the Arabs were attended by
their faithful camels; and the natives of the desert beheld without
terror the familiar aspect of the soil and climate. After a painful
march, they pitched their tents before the walls of Tripoli,  <span
id="fr_547"></span>[140](#fn_547.md) a maritime city in which the name, the
wealth, and the inhabitants of the province had gradually centred, and
which now maintains the third rank among the states of Barbary. A
reenforcement of Greeks was surprised and cut in pieces on the
sea-shore; but the fortifications of Tripoli resisted the first
assaults; and the Saracens were tempted by the approach of the praefect
Gregory  <span id="fr_548"></span>[141](#fn_548.md) to relinquish the
labors of the siege for the perils and the hopes of a decisive action.
If his standard was followed by one hundred and twenty thousand men, the
regular bands of the empire must have been lost in the naked and
disorderly crowd of Africans and Moors, who formed the strength, or
rather the numbers, of his host. He rejected with indignation the option
of the Koran or the tribute; and during several days the two armies were
fiercely engaged from the dawn of light to the hour of noon, when their
fatigue and the excessive heat compelled them to seek shelter and
refreshment in their respective camps. The daughter of Gregory, a maid
of incomparable beauty and spirit, is said to have fought by his side:
from her earliest youth she was trained to mount on horseback, to draw
the bow, and to wield the cimeter; and the richness of her arms and
apparel were conspicuous in the foremost ranks of the battle. Her hand,
with a hundred thousand pieces of gold, was offered for the head of the
Arabian general, and the youths of Africa were excited by the prospect
of the glorious prize. At the pressing solicitation of his brethren,
Abdallah withdrew his person from the field; but the Saracens were
discouraged by the retreat of their leader, and the repetition of these
equal or unsuccessful conflicts.

A noble Arabian, who afterwards became the adversary of Ali, and the
father of a caliph, had signalized his valor in Egypt, and Zobeir  <span
id="fr_549"></span>[142](#fn_549.md) was the first who planted the
scaling-ladder against the walls of Babylon. In the African war he was
detached from the standard of Abdallah. On the news of the battle,
Zobeir, with twelve companions, cut his way through the camp of the
Greeks, and pressed forwards, without tasting either food or repose, to
partake of the dangers of his brethren. He cast his eyes round the
field: "Where," said he, "is our general?" "In his tent." "Is the tent a
station for the general of the Moslems?" Abdallah represented with a
blush the importance of his own life, and the temptation that was held
forth by the Roman praefect. "Retort," said Zobeir, "on the infidels
their ungenerous attempt. Proclaim through the ranks that the head of
Gregory shall be repaid with his captive daughter, and the equal sum of
one hundred thousand pieces of gold." To the courage and discretion of
Zobeir the lieutenant of the caliph intrusted the execution of his own
stratagem, which inclined the long-disputed balance in favor of the
Saracens. Supplying by activity and artifice the deficiency of numbers,
a part of their forces lay concealed in their tents, while the remainder
prolonged an irregular skirmish with the enemy till the sun was high in
the heavens. On both sides they retired with fainting steps: their
horses were unbridled, their armor was laid aside, and the hostile
nations prepared, or seemed to prepare, for the refreshment of the
evening, and the encounter of the ensuing day. On a sudden the charge
was sounded; the Arabian camp poured forth a swarm of fresh and intrepid
warriors; and the long line of the Greeks and Africans was surprised,
assaulted, overturned, by new squadrons of the faithful, who, to the eye
of fanaticism, might appear as a band of angels descending from the sky.
The praefect himself was slain by the hand of Zobeir: his daughter, who
sought revenge and death, was surrounded and made prisoner; and the
fugitives involved in their disaster the town of Sufetula, to which they
escaped from the sabres and lances of the Arabs. Sufetula was built one
hundred and fifty miles to the south of Carthage: a gentle declivity is
watered by a running stream, and shaded by a grove of juniper-trees;
and, in the ruins of a triumpha arch, a portico, and three temples of
the Corinthian order, curiosity may yet admire the magnificence of the
Romans.  <span id="fr_550"></span>[143](#fn_550.md) After the fall of this
opulent city, the provincials and Barbarians implored on all sides the
mercy of the conqueror. His vanity or his zeal might be flattered by
offers of tribute or professions of faith: but his losses, his fatigues,
and the progress of an epidemical disease, prevented a solid
establishment; and the Saracens, after a campaign of fifteen months,
retreated to the confines of Egypt, with the captives and the wealth of
their African expedition. The caliph's fifth was granted to a favorite,
on the nominal payment of five hundred thousand pieces of gold;  <span
id="fr_551"></span>[144](#fn_551.md) but the state was doubly injured by
this fallacious transaction, if each foot-soldier had shared one
thousand, and each horseman three thousand, pieces, in the real division
of the plunder. The author of the death of Gregory was expected to have
claimed the most precious reward of the victory: from his silence it
might be presumed that he had fallen in the battle, till the tears and
exclamations of the praefect's daughter at the sight of Zobeir revealed
the valor and modesty of that gallant soldier. The unfortunate virgin
was offered, and almost rejected as a slave, by her father's murderer,
who coolly declared that his sword was consecrated to the service of
religion; and that he labored for a recompense far above the charms of
mortal beauty, or the riches of this transitory life. A reward congenial
to his temper was the honorable commission of announcing to the caliph
Othman the success of his arms. The companions the chiefs, and the
people, were assembled in the mosch of Medina, to hear the interesting
narrative of Zobeir; and as the orator forgot nothing except the merit
of his own counsels and actions, the name of Abdallah was joined by the
Arabians with the heroic names of Caled and Amrou.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_520"></span>[115](daf05021.htm#fr_520.md) Many treatises of
this lover of labor are still extant, but for readers of the present
age, the printed and unpublished are nearly in the same predicament.
Moses and Aristotle are the chief objects of his verbose commentaries,
one of which is dated as early as May 10th, A.D. 617, (Fabric. Bibliot.
Graec. tom. ix. p. 458 - 468.) A modern, (John Le Clerc,) who sometimes
assumed the same name was equal to old Philoponus in diligence, and far
superior in good sense and real knowledge.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[116](daf05021.htm#fr_521.md) Abulpharag. Dynast.
p. 114, vers. Pocock. Audi quid factum sit et mirare. It would be
endless to enumerate the moderns who have wondered and believed, but I
may distinguish with honor the rational scepticism of Renaudot, (Hist.
Alex. Patriarch, p. 170: ) historia ... habet aliquid ut Arabibus
familiare est.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[\*\_0035](daf05021.htm#fr_522.md) Since this
period several new Mahometan authorities have been adduced to support
the authority of Abulpharagius. That of, I. Abdollatiph by Professor
White: II. Of Makrizi; I have seen a Ms. extract from this writer: III.
Of Ibn Chaledun: and after them Hadschi Chalfa. See Von Hammer,
Geschichte der Assassinen, p. 17. Reinhard, in a German Dissertation,
printed at Gottingen, 1792, and St. Croix, (Magasin Encyclop. tom. iv.
p. 433,) have examined the question. Among Oriental scholars, Professor
White, M. St. Martin, Von Hammer. and Silv. de Sacy, consider the fact
of the burning the library, by the command of Omar, beyond question.
Compare St. Martin's note. vol. xi. p. 296. A Mahometan writer brings a
similar charge against the Crusaders. The library of Tripoli is said to
have contained the incredible number of three millions of volumes. On
the capture of the city, Count Bertram of St. Giles, entering the first
room, which contained nothing but the Koran, ordered the whole to be
burnt, as the works of the false prophet of Arabia. See Wilken. Gesch
der Kreux zuge, vol. ii. p. 211. - M.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[117](daf05021.htm#fr_523.md) This curious
anecdote will be vainly sought in the annals of Eutychius, and the
Saracenic history of Elmacin. The silence of Abulfeda, Murtadi, and a
crowd of Moslems, is less conclusive from their ignorance of Christian
literature.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[118](daf05021.htm#fr_524.md) See Reland, de Jure
Militari Mohammedanorum, in his iiid volume of Dissertations, p. 37. The
reason for not burning the religious books of the Jews or Christians, is
derived from the respect that is due to the name of God.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[119](daf05021.htm#fr_525.md) Consult the
collections of Frensheim (Supplement. Livian, c. 12, 43) and Usher,
(Anal. p. 469.) Livy himself had styled the Alexandrian library,
elegantiae regum curaeque egregium opus; a liberal encomium, for which
he is pertly criticized by the narrow stoicism of Seneca, (De
Tranquillitate Animi, c. 9,) whose wisdom, on this occasion, deviates
into nonsense.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[120](daf05021.htm#fr_526.md) See this History,
vol. iii. p. 146.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[121](daf05021.htm#fr_527.md) Aulus Gellius,
(Noctes Atticae, vi. 17,) Ammianus Marcellinua, (xxii. 16,) and Orosius,
(l. vi. c. 15.) They all speak in the past tense, and the words of
Ammianus are remarkably strong: fuerunt Bibliothecae innumerabiles; et
loquitum monumentorum veterum concinens fides, &c.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[122](daf05021.htm#fr_528.md) Renaudot answers for
versions of the Bible, Hexapla, Catenoe Patrum, Commentaries, &c., (p.
170.) Our Alexandrian Ms., if it came from Egypt, and not from
Constantinople or Mount Athos, (Wetstein, Prolegom. ad N. T. p. 8, &c.,)
might possibly be among them.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[123](daf05021.htm#fr_529.md) I have often perused
with pleasure a chapter of Quintilian, (Institut. Orator. x. i.,) in
which that judicious critic enumerates and appreciates the series of
Greek and Latin classics.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[124](daf05021.htm#fr_530.md) Such as Galen,
Pliny, Aristotle, &c. On this subject Wotton (Reflections on Ancient and
Modern Learning, p. 85 - 95) argues, with solid sense, against the
lively exotic fancies of Sir William Temple. The contempt of the Greeks
for Barbaric science would scarcely admit the Indian or Aethiopic books
into the library of Alexandria; nor is it proved that philosophy has
sustained any real loss from their exclusion.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[125](daf05021.htm#fr_531.md) This curious and
authentic intelligence of Murtadi (p. 284 - 289) has not been discovered
either by Mr. Ockley, or by the self- sufficient compilers of the Modern
Universal History.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[126](daf05021.htm#fr_532.md) Eutychius, Annal.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[\*\_0036](daf05021.htm#fr_533.md) Many learned
men have doubted the existence of a communication by water between the
Red Sea and the Mediterranean by the Nile. Yet the fact is positively
asserted by the ancients. Diodorus Siculus (l. i. p. 33) speaks of it in
the most distinct manner as existing in his time. So, also, Strabo, (l.
xvii. p. 805.) Pliny (vol. vi. p. 29) says that the canal which united
the two seas was navigable, (alveus navigabilis.) The indications
furnished by Ptolemy and by the Arabic historian, Makrisi, show that
works were executed under the reign of Hadrian to repair the canal and
extend the navigation; it then received the name of the River of Trajan
Lucian, (in his Pseudomantis, p. 44,) says that he went by water from
Alexandria to Clysma, on the Red Sea. Testimonies of the 6th and of the
8th century show that the communication was not interrupted at that
time. See the French translation of Strabo, vol. v. p. 382. St. Martin
vol. xi. p. 299. - M.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[127](daf05021.htm#fr_534.md) On these obscure
canals, the reader may try to satisfy himself from D'Anville, (Mem. sur
l'Egypte, p. 108 - 110, 124, 132,) and a learned thesis, maintained and
printed at Strasburg in the year 1770, (Jungendorum marium fluviorumque
molimina, p. 39 - 47, 68 - 70.) Even the supine Turks have agitated the
old project of joining the two seas. (Memoires du Baron de Tott, tom.
iv.)

<span id="fn_535"></span>[128](daf05021.htm#fr_535.md) A small volume, des
Merveilles, &c., de l'Egypte, composed in the xiiith century by Murtadi
of Cairo, and translated from an Arabic Ms. of Cardinal Mazarin, was
published by Pierre Vatier, Paris, 1666. The antiquities of Egypt are
wild and legendary; but the writer deserves credit and esteem for his
account of the conquest and geography of his native country, (see the
correspondence of Amrou and Omar, p. 279 - 289.)

<span id="fn_536"></span>[129](daf05021.htm#fr_536.md) In a twenty years'
residence at Cairo, the consul Maillet had contemplated that varying
scene, the Nile, (lettre ii. particularly p. 70, 75;) the fertility of
the land, (lettre ix.) From a college at Cambridge, the poetic eye of
Gray had seen the same objects with a keener glance: - What wonder in
the sultry climes that spread, Where Nile, redundant o'er his summer
bed, From his broad bosom life and verdure flings, And broods o'er Egypt
with his watery wings: If with adventurous oar, and ready sail, The
dusky people drive before the gale: Or on frail floats to neighboring
cities ride. That rise and glitter o'er the ambient tide.

(Mason's Works and Memoirs of Gray, p. 199, 200.)

<span id="fn_537"></span>[130](daf05021.htm#fr_537.md) Murtadi, p. 164 -
167. The reader will not easily credit a human sacrifice under the
Christian emperors, or a miracle of the successors of Mahomet.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[131](daf05021.htm#fr_538.md) Maillet, Description
de l'Egypte, p. 22. He mentions this number as the common opinion; and
adds, that the generality of these villages contain two or three
thousand persons, and that many of them are more populous than our large
cities.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[132](daf05021.htm#fr_539.md) Eutych. Annal. tom.
ii. p. 308, 311. The twenty millions are computed from the following
data: one twelfth of mankind above sixty, one third below sixteen, the
proportion of men to women as seventeen or sixteen, (Recherches sur la
Population de la France, p. 71, 72.) The president Goguet (Origine des
Arts, &c., tom. iii. p. 26, &c.) Bestows twenty-seven millions on
ancient Egypt, because the seventeen hundred companions of Sesostris
were born on the same day.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[133](daf05021.htm#fr_540.md) Elmacin, Hist.
Saracen. p. 218; and this gross lump is swallowed without scruple by
D'Herbelot, (Bibliot. Orient. p. 1031,) Ar. buthnot, (Tables of Ancient
Coins, p. 262,) and De Guignes, (Hist. des Huns, tom. iii. p. 135.) They
might allege the not less extravagant liberality of Appian in favor of
the Ptolemies (in praefat.) of seventy four myriads, 740,000 talents, an
annual income of 185, or near 300 millions of pounds sterling, according
as we reckon by the Egyptian or the Alexandrian talent, (Bernard, de
Ponderibus Antiq. p. 186.)

<span id="fn_541"></span>[134](daf05021.htm#fr_541.md) See the measurement
of D'Anville, (Mem. sur l'Egypte, p. 23, &c.) After some peevish cavils,
M. Pauw (Recherches sur les Egyptiens, tom. i. p. 118 - 121) can only
enlarge his reckoning to 2250 square leagues.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[135](daf05021.htm#fr_542.md) Renaudot, Hist.
Patriarch. Alexand. p. 334, who calls the common reading or version of
Elmacin, error librarii. His own emendation, of 4,300,000 pieces, in the
ixth century, maintains a probable medium between the 3,000,000 which
the Arabs acquired by the conquest of Egypt, idem, p. 168.) and the
2,400,000 which the sultan of Constantinople levied in the last century,
(Pietro della Valle, tom. i. p. 352 Thevenot, part i. p. 824.) Pauw
(Recherches, tom. ii. p. 365 - 373) gradually raises the revenue of the
Pharaohs, the Ptolemies, and the Caesars, from six to fifteen millions
of German crowns.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[136](daf05021.htm#fr_543.md) The list of
Schultens (Index Geograph. ad calcem Vit. Saladin. p. 5) contains 2396
places; that of D'Anville, (Mem. sur l'Egypte, p. 29,) from the divan of
Cairo, enumerates 2696.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[137](daf05021.htm#fr_544.md) See Maillet,
(Description de l'Egypte, p. 28,) who seems to argue with candor and
judgment. I am much better satisfied with the observations than with the
reading of the French consul. He was ignorant of Greek and Latin
literature, and his fancy is too much delighted with the fictions of the
Arabs. Their best knowledge is collected by Abulfeda, (Descript. Aegypt.
Arab. et Lat. a Joh. David Michaelis, Gottingae, in 4to., 1776;) and in
two recent voyages into Egypt, we are amused by Savary, and instructed
by Volney. I wish the latter could travel over the globe.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[138](daf05021.htm#fr_545.md) My conquest of
Africa is drawn from two French interpreters of Arabic literature,
Cardonne (Hist. de l'Afrique et de l'Espagne sous la Domination des
Arabes, tom. i. p. 8 - 55) and Otter, (Hist. de l'Academie des
Inscriptions, tom. xxi. p. 111 - 125, and 136.) They derive their
principal information from Novairi, who composed, A.D. 1331 an
Encyclopaedia in more than twenty volumes. The five general parts
successively treat of, 1. Physics; 2. Man; 3. Animals; 4. Plants; and,
5. History; and the African affairs are discussed in the vith chapter of
the vth section of this last part, (Reiske, Prodidagmata ad Hagji
Chalifae Tabulas, p. 232 - 234.) Among the older historians who are
quoted by Navairi we may distinguish the original narrative of a soldier
who led the van of the Moslems.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[139](daf05021.htm#fr_546.md) See the history of
Abdallah, in Abulfeda (Vit. Mohammed. p. 108) and Gagnier, (Vie de
Mahomet, tom. iii. 45 - 48.)

<span id="fn_547"></span>[140](daf05021.htm#fr_547.md) The province and
city of Tripoli are described by Leo Africanus (in Navigatione et Viaggi
di Ramusio, tom. i. Venetia, 1550, fol. 76, verso) and Marmol,
(Description de l'Afrique, tom. ii. p. 562.) The first of these writers
was a Moor, a scholar, and a traveller, who composed or translated his
African geography in a state of captivity at Rome, where he had assumed
the name and religion of Pope Leo X. In a similar captivity among the
Moors, the Spaniard Marmol, a soldier of Charles V., compiled his
Description of Africa, translated by D'Ablancourt into French, (Paris,
1667, 3 vols. in 4to.) Marmol had read and seen, but he is destitute of
the curious and extensive observation which abounds in the original work
of Leo the African.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[141](daf05021.htm#fr_548.md) Theophanes, who
mentions the defeat, rather than the death, of Gregory. He brands the
praefect with the name: he had probably assumed the purple,
(Chronograph. p. 285.)

<span id="fn_549"></span>[142](daf05021.htm#fr_549.md) See in Ockley (Hist.
of the Saracens, vol. ii. p. 45) the death of Zobeir, which was honored
with the tears of Ali, against whom he had rebelled. His valor at the
siege of Babylon, if indeed it be the same person, is mentioned by
Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p. 308)

<span id="fn_550"></span>[143](daf05021.htm#fr_550.md) Shaw's Travels, p.
118, 119.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[144](daf05021.htm#fr_551.md) Mimica emptio, says
Abulfeda, erat haec, et mira donatio; quandoquidem Othman, ejus nomine
nummos ex aerario prius ablatos aerario praestabat, (Annal. Moslem. p.
78.) Elmacin (in his cloudy version, p. 39) seems to report the same
job. When the Arabs be sieged the palace of Othman, it stood high in
their catalogue of grievances.

Chronograph. p. 235 edit. Paris. His chronology is loose and inaccurate.
