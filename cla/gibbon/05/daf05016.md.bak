### Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs. Part II.

After the defeat of Cadesia, a country intersected by rivers and canals
might have opposed an insuperable barrier to the victorious cavalry; and
the walls of Ctesiphon or Madayn, which had resisted the battering-rams
of the Romans, would not have yielded to the darts of the Saracens. But
the flying Persians were overcome by the belief, that the last day of
their religion and empire was at hand; the strongest posts were
abandoned by treachery or cowardice; and the king, with a part of his
family and treasures, escaped to Holwan at the foot of the Median hills.
In the third month after the battle, Said, the lieutenant of Omar,
passed the Tigris without opposition; the capital was taken by assault;
and the disorderly resistance of the people gave a keener edge to the
sabres of the Moslems, who shouted with religious transport, "This is
the white palace of Chosroes; this is the promise of the apostle of
God!" The naked robbers of the desert were suddenly enriched beyond the
measure of their hope or knowledge. Each chamber revealed a new treasure
secreted with art, or ostentatiously displayed; the gold and silver, the
various wardrobes and precious furniture, surpassed (says Abulfeda) the
estimate of fancy or numbers; and another historian defines the untold
and almost infinite mass, by the fabulous computation of three thousands
of thousands of thousands of pieces of gold.  <span
id="fr_404"></span>[24](#fn_404.md) Some minute though curious facts
represent the contrast of riches and ignorance. From the remote islands
of the Indian Ocean a large provision of camphire  <span
id="fr_405"></span>[25](#fn_405.md) had been imported, which is employed
with a mixture of wax to illuminate the palaces of the East. Strangers
to the name and properties of that odoriferous gum, the Saracens,
mistaking it for salt, mingled the camphire in their bread, and were
astonished at the bitterness of the taste. One of the apartments of the
palace was decorated with a carpet of silk, sixty cubits in length, and
as many in breadth: a paradise or garden was depictured on the ground:
the flowers, fruits, and shrubs, were imitated by the figures of the
gold embroidery, and the colors of the precious stones; and the ample
square was encircled by a variegated and verdant border.  <span
id="fr_406"></span>[!\_0026](#fn_406.md) The Arabian general persuaded his
soldiers to relinquish their claim, in the reasonable hope that the eyes
of the caliph would be delighted with the splendid workmanship of nature
and industry. Regardless of the merit of art, and the pomp of royalty,
the rigid Omar divided the prize among his brethren of Medina: the
picture was destroyed; but such was the intrinsic value of the
materials, that the share of Ali alone was sold for twenty thousand
drams. A mule that carried away the tiara and cuirass, the belt and
bracelets of Chosroes, was overtaken by the pursuers; the gorgeous
trophy was presented to the commander of the faithful; and the gravest
of the companions condescended to smile when they beheld the white
beard, the hairy arms, and uncouth figure of the veteran, who was
invested with the spoils of the Great King.  <span
id="fr_407"></span>[26](#fn_407.md) The sack of Ctesiphon was followed by
its desertion and gradual decay. The Saracens disliked the air and
situation of the place, and Omar was advised by his general to remove
the seat of government to the western side of the Euphrates. In every
age, the foundation and ruin of the Assyrian cities has been easy and
rapid: the country is destitute of stone and timber; and the most solid
structures  <span id="fr_408"></span>[27](#fn_408.md) are composed of
bricks baked in the sun, and joined by a cement of the native bitumen.
The name of Cufa  <span id="fr_409"></span>[28](#fn_409.md) describes a
habitation of reeds and earth; but the importance of the new capital was
supported by the numbers, wealth, and spirit, of a colony of veterans;
and their licentiousness was indulged by the wisest caliphs, who were
apprehensive of provoking the revolt of a hundred thousand swords: "Ye
men of Cufa," said Ali, who solicited their aid, "you have been always
conspicuous by your valor. You conquered the Persian king, and scattered
his forces, till you had taken possession of his inheritance." This
mighty conquest was achieved by the battles of Jalula and Nehavend.
After the loss of the former, Yezdegerd fled from Holwan, and concealed
his shame and despair in the mountains of Farsistan, from whence Cyrus
had descended with his equal and valiant companions. The courage of the
nation survived that of the monarch: among the hills to the south of
Ecbatana or Hamadan, one hundred and fifty thousand Persians made a
third and final stand for their religion and country; and the decisive
battle of Nehavend was styled by the Arabs the victory of victories. If
it be true that the flying general of the Persians was stopped and
overtaken in a crowd of mules and camels laden with honey, the incident,
however slight and singular, will denote the luxurious impediments of an
Oriental army.  <span id="fr_410"></span>[29](#fn_410.md)

The geography of Persia is darkly delineated by the Greeks and Latins;
but the most illustrious of her cities appear to be more ancient than
the invasion of the Arabs. By the reduction of Hamadan and Ispahan, of
Caswin, Tauris, and Rei, they gradually approached the shores of the
Caspian Sea: and the orators of Mecca might applaud the success and
spirit of the faithful, who had already lost sight of the northern bear,
and had almost transcended the bounds of the habitable world.  <span
id="fr_411"></span>[30](#fn_411.md) Again, turning towards the West and the
Roman empire, they repassed the Tigris over the bridge of Mosul, and, in
the captive provinces of Armenia and Mesopotamia, embraced their
victorious brethren of the Syrian army. From the palace of Madayn their
Eastern progress was not less rapid or extensive. They advanced along
the Tigris and the Gulf; penetrated through the passes of the mountains
into the valley of Estachar or Persepolis, and profaned the last
sanctuary of the Magian empire. The grandson of Chosroes was nearly
surprised among the falling columns and mutilated figures; a sad emblem
of the past and present fortune of Persia:  <span
id="fr_412"></span>[31](#fn_412.md) he fled with accelerated haste over the
desert of Kirman, implored the aid of the warlike Segestans, and sought
an humble refuge on the verge of the Turkish and Chinese power. But a
victorious army is insensible of fatigue: the Arabs divided their forces
in the pursuit of a timorous enemy; and the caliph Othman promised the
government of Chorasan to the first general who should enter that large
and populous country, the kingdom of the ancient Bactrians. The
condition was accepted; the prize was deserved; the standard of Mahomet
was planted on the walls of Herat, Merou, and Balch; and the successful
leader neither halted nor reposed till his foaming cavalry had tasted
the waters of the Oxus. In the public anarchy, the independent governors
of the cities and castles obtained their separate capitulations: the
terms were granted or imposed by the esteem, the prudence, or the
compassion, of the victors; and a simple profession of faith established
the distinction between a brother and a slave. After a noble defence,
Harmozan, the prince or satrap of Ahwaz and Susa, was compelled to
surrender his person and his state to the discretion of the caliph; and
their interview exhibits a portrait of the Arabian manners. In the
presence, and by the command, of Omar, the gay Barbarian was despoiled
of his silken robes embroidered with gold, and of his tiara bedecked
with rubies and emeralds: "Are you now sensible," said the conqueror to
his naked captive - "are you now sensible of the judgment of God, and of
the different rewards of infidelity and obedience?" "Alas!" replied
Harmozan, "I feel them too deeply. In the days of our common ignorance,
we fought with the weapons of the flesh, and my nation was superior. God
was then neuter: since he has espoused your quarrel, you have subverted
our kingdom and religion." Oppressed by this painful dialogue, the
Persian complained of intolerable thirst, but discovered some
apprehension lest he should be killed whilst he was drinking a cup of
water. "Be of good courage," said the caliph; "your life is safe till
you have drunk this water: " the crafty satrap accepted the assurance,
and instantly dashed the vase against the ground. Omar would have
avenged the deceit, but his companions represented the sanctity of an
oath; and the speedy conversion of Harmozan entitled him not only to a
free pardon, but even to a stipend of two thousand pieces of gold. The
administration of Persia was regulated by an actual survey of the
people, the cattle, and the fruits of the earth;  <span
id="fr_413"></span>[32](#fn_413.md) and this monument, which attests the
vigilance of the caliphs, might have instructed the philosophers of
every age.  <span id="fr_414"></span>[33](#fn_414.md)

The flight of Yezdegerd had carried him beyond the Oxus, and as far as
the Jaxartes, two rivers  <span id="fr_415"></span>[34](#fn_415.md) of
ancient and modern renown, which descend from the mountains of India
towards the Caspian Sea. He was hospitably entertained by Takhan, prince
of Fargana,  <span id="fr_416"></span>[35](#fn_416.md) a fertile province
on the Jaxartes: the king of Samarcand, with the Turkish tribes of
Sogdiana and Scythia, were moved by the lamentations and promises of the
fallen monarch; and he solicited, by a suppliant embassy, the more solid
and powerful friendship of the emperor of China.  <span
id="fr_417"></span>[36](#fn_417.md) The virtuous Taitsong,  <span
id="fr_418"></span>[37](#fn_418.md) the first of the dynasty of the Tang
may be justly compared with the Antonines of Rome: his people enjoyed
the blessings of prosperity and peace; and his dominion was acknowledged
by forty-four hordes of the Barbarians of Tartary. His last garrisons of
Cashgar and Khoten maintained a frequent intercourse with their
neighbors of the Jaxartes and Oxus; a recent colony of Persians had
introduced into China the astronomy of the Magi; and Taitsong might be
alarmed by the rapid progress and dangerous vicinity of the Arabs. The
influence, and perhaps the supplies, of China revived the hopes of
Yezdegerd and the zeal of the worshippers of fire; and he returned with
an army of Turks to conquer the inheritance of his fathers. The
fortunate Moslems, without unsheathing their swords, were the spectators
of his ruin and death. The grandson of Chosroes was betrayed by his
servant, insulted by the seditious inhabitants of Merou, and oppressed,
defeated, and pursued by his Barbarian allies. He reached the banks of a
river, and offered his rings and bracelets for an instant passage in a
miller's boat. Ignorant or insensible of royal distress, the rustic
replied, that four drams of silver were the daily profit of his mill,
and that he would not suspend his work unless the loss were repaid. In
this moment of hesitation and delay, the last of the Sassanian kings was
overtaken and slaughtered by the Turkish cavalry, in the nineteenth year
of his unhappy reign.  <span id="fr_419"></span>[38](#fn_419.md)  <span
id="fr_420"></span>[\*\_0027](#fn_420.md) His son Firuz, an humble client
of the Chinese emperor, accepted the station of captain of his guards;
and the Magian worship was long preserved by a colony of loyal exiles in
the province of Bucharia.  <span id="fr_421"></span>[!\_0027](#fn_421.md)
His grandson inherited the regal name; but after a faint and fruitless
enterprise, he returned to China, and ended his days in the palace of
Sigan. The male line of the Sassanides was extinct; but the female
captives, the daughters of Persia, were given to the conquerors in
servitude, or marriage; and the race of the caliphs and imams was
ennobled by the blood of their royal mothers.  <span
id="fr_422"></span>[39](#fn_422.md)

After the fall of the Persian kingdom, the River Oxus divided the
territories of the Saracens and of the Turks. This narrow boundary was
soon overleaped by the spirit of the Arabs; the governors of Chorasan
extended their successive inroads; and one of their triumphs was adorned
with the buskin of a Turkish queen, which she dropped in her precipitate
flight beyond the hills of Bochara.  <span
id="fr_423"></span>[40](#fn_423.md) But the final conquest of Transoxiana,
 <span id="fr_424"></span>[41](#fn_424.md) as well as of Spain, was
reserved for the glorious reign of the inactive Walid; and the name of
Catibah, the camel driver, declares the origin and merit of his
successful lieutenant. While one of his colleagues displayed the first
Mahometan banner on the banks of the Indus, the spacious regions between
the Oxus, the Jaxartes, and the Caspian Sea, were reduced by the arms of
Catibah to the obedience of the prophet and of the caliph.  <span
id="fr_425"></span>[42](#fn_425.md) A tribute of two millions of pieces of
gold was imposed on the infidels; their idols were burnt or broken; the
Mussulman chief pronounced a sermon in the new mosch of Carizme; after
several battles, the Turkish hordes were driven back to the desert; and
the emperors of China solicited the friendship of the victorious Arabs.
To their industry, the prosperity of the province, the Sogdiana of the
ancients, may in a great measure be ascribed; but the advantages of the
soil and climate had been understood and cultivated since the reign of
the Macedonian kings. Before the invasion of the Saracens, Carizme,
Bochara, and Samarcand were rich and populous under the yoke of the
shepherds of the north.  <span id="fr_426"></span>[\*\_0028](#fn_426.md)
These cities were surrounded with a double wall; and the exterior
fortification, of a larger circumference, enclosed the fields and
gardens of the adjacent district. The mutual wants of India and Europe
were supplied by the diligence of the Sogdian merchants; and the
inestimable art of transforming linen into paper has been diffused from
the manufacture of Samarcand over the western world.  <span
id="fr_427"></span>[43](#fn_427.md)

II\. No sooner had Abubeker restored the unity of faith and government,
than he despatched a circular letter to the Arabian tribes. "In the name
of the most merciful God, to the rest of the true believers. Health and
happiness, and the mercy and blessing of God, be upon you. I praise the
most high God, and I pray for his prophet Mahomet. This is to acquaint
you, that I intend to send the true believers into Syria  <span
id="fr_428"></span>[44](#fn_428.md) to take it out of the hands of the
infidels. And I would have you know, that the fighting for religion is
an act of obedience to God." His messengers returned with the tidings of
pious and martial ardor which they had kindled in every province; and
the camp of Medina was successively filled with the intrepid bands of
the Saracens, who panted for action, complained of the heat of the
season and the scarcity of provisions, and accused with impatient
murmurs the delays of the caliph. As soon as their numbers were
complete, Abubeker ascended the hill, reviewed the men, the horses, and
the arms, and poured forth a fervent prayer for the success of their
undertaking. In person, and on foot, he accompanied the first day's
march; and when the blushing leaders attempted to dismount, the caliph
removed their scruples by a declaration, that those who rode, and those
who walked, in the service of religion, were equally meritorious. His
instructions  <span id="fr_429"></span>[45](#fn_429.md) to the chiefs of
the Syrian army were inspired by the warlike fanaticism which advances
to seize, and affects to despise, the objects of earthly ambition.
"Remember," said the successor of the prophet, "that you are always in
the presence of God, on the verge of death, in the assurance of
judgment, and the hope of paradise. Avoid injustice and oppression;
consult with your brethren, and study to preserve the love and
confidence of your troops. When you fight the battles of the Lord,
acquit yourselves like men, without turning your backs; but let not your
victory be stained with the blood of women or children. Destroy no
palm-trees, nor burn any fields of corn. Cut down no fruit-trees, nor do
any mischief to cattle, only such as you kill to eat. When you make any
covenant or article, stand to it, and be as good as your word. As you go
on, you will find some religious persons who live retired in
monasteries, and propose to themselves to serve God that way: let them
alone, and neither kill them nor destroy their monasteries:  <span
id="fr_430"></span>[46](#fn_430.md) And you will find another sort of
people, that belong to the synagogue of Satan, who have shaven crowns;
 <span id="fr_431"></span>[47](#fn_431.md) be sure you cleave their skulls,
and give them no quarter till they either turn Mahometans or pay
"tribute." All profane or frivolous conversation, all dangerous
recollection of ancient quarrels, was severely prohibited among the
Arabs: in the tumult of a camp, the exercises of religion were
assiduously practised; and the intervals of action were employed in
prayer, meditation, and the study of the Koran. The abuse, or even the
use, of wine was chastised by fourscore strokes on the soles of the
feet, and in the fervor of their primitive zeal, many secret sinners
revealed their fault, and solicited their punishment. After some
hesitation, the command of the Syrian army was delegated to Abu Obeidah,
one of the fugitives of Mecca, and companions of Mahomet; whose zeal and
devotion was assuaged, without being abated, by the singular mildness
and benevolence of his temper. But in all the emergencies of war, the
soldiers demanded the superior genius of Caled; and whoever might be the
choice of the prince, the Sword of God was both in fact and fame the
foremost leader of the Saracens. He obeyed without reluctance;  <span
id="fr_432"></span>[\*\_0029](#fn_432.md) he was consulted without
jealousy; and such was the spirit of the man, or rather of the times,
that Caled professed his readiness to serve under the banner of the
faith, though it were in the hands of a child or an enemy. Glory, and
riches, and dominion, were indeed promised to the victorious Mussulman;
but he was carefully instructed, that if the goods of this life were his
only incitement, they likewise would be his only reward.

manner three thousand million of ducats. See Forster's Mahometanism
Unveiled, vol. ii. p. 462; who makes this innocent doubt of Gibbon, in
which, is to the amount of the plunder, I venture to concur, a grave
charge of inaccuracy and disrespect to the memory of Erpenius.

162) is much more probable. On the demand of the few dhirems, he offered
to the miller his sword, and royal girdle, of inesturable value. This

into the stream. - M.

the Saracens, vol. ii. p. 142, 143,) His brother Salem was accompanied
by his wife, the first Arabian woman (A.D. 680) who passed the Oxus: she
borrowed, or rather stole, the crown and jewels of the princess of the
Sogdians, (p. 231, 232.)

<span id="fn_424"></span>[41](daf05016.htm#fr_424.md) A part of Abulfeda's
geography is translated by Greaves, inserted in Hudson's collection of
the minor geographers, (tom. iii.,) and entitled Descriptio Chorasmiae
et Mawaralnahroe, id est, regionum extra fluvium, Oxum, p. 80. The name
of Transoxiana, softer in sound, equivalent in sense, is aptly used by
Petit de la Croix, (Hist. de Gengiscan, &c.,) and some modern
Orientalists, but they are mistaken in ascribing it to the writers of
antiquity.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[43](daf05016.htm#fr_427.md) A curious description
of Samarcand is inserted in the Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana, tom. i. p.
208, &c. The librarian Casiri (tom. ii. 9) relates, from credible
testimony, that paper was first imported from China to Samarcand, A. H.
30, and invented, or rather introduced, at Mecca, A. H. 88. The Escurial
library contains paper Mss. as old as the ivth or vth century of the
Hegira.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[44](daf05016.htm#fr_428.md) A separate history of
the conquest of Syria has been composed by Al Wakidi, cadi of Bagdad,
who was born A.D. 748, and died A.D. 822; he likewise wrote the conquest
of Egypt, of Diarbekir, &c. Above the meagre and recent chronicles of
the Arabians, Al Wakidi has the double merit of antiquity and
copiousness. His tales and traditions afford an artless picture of the
men and the times. Yet his narrative is too often defective, trifling,
and improbable. Till something better shall be found, his learned and
spiritual interpreter (Ockley, in his History of the Saracens, vol. i.
p. 21 - 342) will not deserve the petulant animadversion of Reiske,
(Prodidagmata ad Magji Chalifae Tabulas, p. 236.) I am sorry to think
that the labors of Ockley were consummated in a jail, (see his two
prefaces to the 1st A.D. 1708, to the 2d, 1718, with the list of authors
at the end.)

Note: M. Hamaker has clearly shown that neither of these works can be
inscribed to Al Wakidi: they are not older than the end of the xith
century or later than the middle of the xivth. Praefat. in Inc. Auct.
LIb. de Expugnatione Memphidis, c. ix. x. - M.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[45](daf05016.htm#fr_429.md) The instructions,
&c., of the Syrian war are described by Al Wakidi and Ockley, tom. i. p.
22 - 27, &c. In the sequel it is necessary to contract, and needless to
quote, their circumstantial narrative. My obligations to others shall be
noticed.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[46](daf05016.htm#fr_430.md) Notwithstanding this
precept, M. Pauw (Recherches sur les Egyptiens, tom. ii. p. 192, edit.
Lausanne) represents the Bedoweens as the implacable enemies of the
Christian monks. For my own part, I am more inclined to suspect the
avarice of the Arabian robbers, and the prejudices of the German
philosopher.

Note: Several modern travellers (Mr. Fazakerley, in Walpole's Travels in
the East, vol. xi. 371) give very amusing accounts of the terms on which
the monks of Mount Sinai live with the neighboring Bedoweens. Such,
probably, was their relative state in older times, wherever the Arab
retained his Bedoween habits. - M.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[47](daf05016.htm#fr_431.md) Even in the seventh
century, the monks were generally laymen: 'hey wore their hair long and
dishevelled, and shaved their heads when they were ordained priests. The
circular tonsure was sacred and mysterious; it was the crown of thorns;
but it was likewise a royal diadem, and every priest was a king, &c.,
(Thomassin, Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. i. p. 721 - 758, especially p.
737, 738.)

<span id="fn_432"></span>[\*\_0029](daf05016.htm#fr_432.md) Compare Price,
p. 90. - M.
