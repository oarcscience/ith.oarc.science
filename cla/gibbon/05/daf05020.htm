<p>     I should deceive the expectation of the reader, if I passed in silence the fate of the Alexandrian library, as it is described by the learned Abulpharagius.  The spirit of Amrou was more curious and liberal than that of his brethren, and in his leisure hours, the Arabian chief was pleased with the conversation of John, the last disciple of Ammonius, and who derived the surname of Philoponus from his laborious studies of grammar and philosophy. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A> Emboldened by this familiar intercourse, Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift, inestimable in his opinion, contemptible in that of the Barbarians - the royal library, which alone, among the spoils of Alexandria, had not been appropriated by the visit and the seal of the conqueror.  Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian, but his rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest object without the consent of the caliph; and the well-known answer of Omar was inspired by the ignorance of a fanatic.  "If these writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God, they are useless, and need not be preserved: if they disagree, they are pernicious, and ought to be destroyed." The sentence was executed with blind obedience: the volumes of paper or parchment were distributed to the four thousand baths of the city; and such was their incredible multitude, that six months were barely sufficient for the consumption of this precious fuel.  Since the Dynasties of Abulpharagius &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A> have been given to the world in a Latin version, the tale has been repeatedly transcribed; and every scholar, with pious indignation, has deplored the irreparable shipwreck of the learning, the arts, and the genius, of antiquity.  For my own part, I am strongly tempted to deny both the fact and the consequences. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0033</FONT></A> The fact is indeed marvellous.  "Read and wonder!" says the historian himself: and the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at the end of six hundred years on the confines of Media, is overbalanced by the silence of two annalist of a more early date, both Christians, both natives of Egypt, and the most ancient of whom, the patriarch Eutychius, has amply described the conquest of Alexandria. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A> The rigid sentence of Omar is repugnant to the sound and orthodox precept of the Mahometan casuists they expressly declare, that the religious books of the Jews and Christians, which are acquired by the right of war, should never be committed to the flames; and that the works of profane science, historians or poets, physicians or philosophers, may be lawfully applied to the use of the faithful. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A> A more destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first successors of Mahomet; yet in this instance, the conflagration would have speedily expired in the deficiency of materials. I should not recapitulate the disasters of the Alexandrian library, the involuntary flame that was kindled by Caesar in his own defence, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A> or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians, who studied to destroy the monuments of idolatry. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A> But if we gradually descend from the age of the Antonines to that of Theodosius, we shall learn from a chain of contemporary witnesses, that the royal palace and the temple of Serapis no longer contained the four, or the seven, hundred thousand volumes, which had been assembled by the curiosity and magnificence of the Ptolemies. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A> Perhaps the church and seat of the patriarchs might be enriched with a repository of books; but if the ponderous mass of Arian and Monophysite controversy were indeed consumed in the public baths, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A> a philosopher may allow, with a smile, that it was ultimately devoted to the benefit of mankind.  I sincerely regret the more valuable libraries which have been involved in the ruin of the Roman empire; but when I seriously compute the lapse of ages, the waste of ignorance, and the calamities of war, our treasures, rather than our losses, are the objects of my surprise.  Many curious and interesting facts are buried in oblivion: the three great historians of Rome have been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state, and we are deprived of many pleasing compositions of the lyric, iambic, and dramatic poetry of the Greeks.  Yet we should gratefully remember, that the mischances of time and accident have spared the classic works to which the suffrage of antiquity &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A> had adjudged the first place of genius and glory: the teachers of ancient knowledge, who are still extant, had perused and compared the writings of their predecessors; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A> nor can it fairly be presumed that any important truth, any useful discovery in art or nature, has been snatched away from the curiosity of modern ages. </p>

       In the administration of Egypt, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A> Amrou balanced the demands of justice and policy; the interest of the people of the law, who were defended by God; and of the people of the alliance, who were protected by man.  In the recent tumult of conquest and deliverance, the tongue of the Copts and the sword of the Arabs were most adverse to the tranquillity of the province.  To the former, Amrou declared, that faction and falsehood would be doubly chastised; by the punishment of the accusers, whom he should detest as his personal enemies, and by the promotion of their innocent brethren, whom their envy had labored to injure and supplant.  He excited the latter by the motives of religion and honor to sustain the dignity of their character, to endear themselves by a modest and temperate conduct to God and the caliph, to spare and protect a people who had trusted to their faith, and to content themselves with the legitimate and splendid rewards of their victory.  In the management of the revenue, he disapproved the simple but oppressive mode of a capitation, and preferred with reason a proportion of taxes deducted on every branch from the clear profits of agriculture and commerce.  A third part of the tribute was appropriated to the annual repairs of the dikes and canals, so essential to the public welfare.  Under his administration, the fertility of Egypt supplied the dearth of Arabia; and a string of camels, laden with corn and provisions, covered almost without an interval the long road from Memphis to Medina. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A> But the genius of Amrou soon renewed the maritime communication which had been attempted or achieved by the Pharaohs the Ptolemies, or the Caesars; and a canal, at least eighty miles in length, was opened from the Nile to the Red Sea. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0034</FONT></A> This inland navigation, which would have joined the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, was soon discontinued as useless and dangerous: the throne was removed from Medina to Damascus, and the Grecian fleets might have explored a passage to the holy cities of Arabia. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A>

 </p> 
<p>     Of his new conquest, the caliph Omar had an imperfect knowledge from the voice of fame and the legends of the Koran.  He requested that his lieutenant would place before his eyes the realm of Pharaoh and the Amalekites; and the answer of Amrou exhibits a lively and not unfaithful picture of that singular country. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A> "O commander of the faithful, Egypt is a compound of black earth and green plants, between a pulverized mountain and a red sand.  The distance from Syene to the sea is a month's journey for a horseman.  Along the valley descends a river, on which the blessing of the Most High reposes both in the evening and morning, and which rises and falls with the revolutions of the sun and moon.  When the annual dispensation of Providence unlocks the springs and fountains that nourish the earth, the Nile rolls his swelling and sounding waters through the realm of Egypt: the fields are overspread by the salutary flood; and the villages communicate with each other in their painted barks. The retreat of the inundation deposits a fertilizing mud for the reception of the various seeds: the crowds of husbandmen who blacken the land may be compared to a swarm of industrious ants; and their native indolence is quickened by the lash of the task-master, and the promise of the flowers and fruits of a plentiful increase.  Their hope is seldom deceived; but the riches which they extract from the wheat, the barley, and the rice, the legumes, the fruit-trees, and the cattle, are unequally shared between those who labor and those who possess.  According to the vicissitudes of the seasons, the face of the country is adorned with a silver wave, a verdant emerald, and the deep yellow of a golden harvest." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A> Yet this beneficial order is sometimes interrupted; and the long delay and sudden swell of the river in the first year of the conquest might afford some color to an edifying fable.  It is said, that the annual sacrifice of a virgin &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A> had been interdicted by the piety of Omar; and that the Nile lay sullen and inactive in his shallow bed, till the mandate of the caliph was cast into the obedient stream, which rose in a single night to the height of sixteen cubits.  The admiration of the Arabs for their new conquest encouraged the license of their romantic spirit. We may read, in the gravest authors, that Egypt was crowded with twenty thousand cities or villages: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">131</FONT></A> that, exclusive of the Greeks and Arabs, the Copts alone were found, on the assessment, six millions of tributary subjects, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">132</FONT></A> or twenty millions of either sex, and of every age: that three hundred millions of gold or silver were annually paid to the treasury of the caliphs. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A> Our reason must be startled by these extravagant assertions; and they will become more palpable, if we assume the compass and measure the extent of habitable ground: a valley from the tropic to Memphis seldom broader than twelve miles, and the triangle of the Delta, a flat surface of two thousand one hundred square leagues, compose a twelfth part of the magnitude of France. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A> A more accurate research will justify a more reasonable estimate.  The three hundred millions, created by the error of a scribe, are reduced to the decent revenue of four millions three hundred thousand pieces of gold, of which nine hundred thousand were consumed by the pay of the soldiers. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">135</FONT></A> Two authentic lists, of the present and of the twelfth century, are circumscribed within the respectable number of two thousand seven hundred villages and towns. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A> After a long residence at Cairo, a French consul has ventured to assign about four millions of Mahometans, Christians, and Jews, for the ample, though not incredible, scope of the population of Egypt. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">137</FONT></A>

       IV.  The conquest of Africa, from the Nile to the Atlantic Ocean, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A> was first attempted by the arms of the caliph Othman.  The pious design was approved by the companions of Mahomet and the chiefs of the tribes; and twenty thousand Arabs marched from Medina, with the gifts and the blessing of the commander of the faithful.  They were joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty thousand of their countrymen; and the conduct of the war was intrusted to Abdallah, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A> the son of Said and the foster-brother of the caliph, who had lately supplanted the conqueror and lieutenant of Egypt. Yet the favor of the prince, and the merit of his favorite, could not obliterate the guilt of his apostasy.  The early conversion of Abdallah, and his skilful pen, had recommended him to the important office of transcribing the sheets of the Koran: he betrayed his trust, corrupted the text, derided the errors which he had made, and fled to Mecca to escape the justice, and expose the ignorance, of the apostle.  After the conquest of Mecca, he fell prostrate at the feet of Mahomet; his tears, and the entreaties of Othman, extorted a reluctant pardon; out the prophet declared that he had so long hesitated, to allow time for some zealous disciple to avenge his injury in the blood of the apostate.  With apparent fidelity and effective merit, he served the religion which it was no longer his interest to desert: his birth and talents gave him an honorable rank among the Koreish; and, in a nation of cavalry, Abdallah was renowned as the boldest and most dexterous horseman of Arabia.  At the head of forty thousand Moslems, he advanced from Egypt into the unknown countries of the West. The sands of Barca might be impervious to a Roman legion but the Arabs were attended by their faithful camels; and the natives of the desert beheld without terror the familiar aspect of the soil and climate.  After a painful march, they pitched their tents before the walls of Tripoli, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_514"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A> a maritime city in which the name, the wealth, and the inhabitants of the province had gradually centred, and which now maintains the third rank among the states of Barbary.  A reenforcement of Greeks was surprised and cut in pieces on the sea-shore; but the fortifications of Tripoli resisted the first assaults; and the Saracens were tempted by the approach of the praefect Gregory &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A> to relinquish the labors of the siege for the perils and the hopes of a decisive action.  If his standard was followed by one hundred and twenty thousand men, the regular bands of the empire must have been lost in the naked and disorderly crowd of Africans and Moors, who formed the strength, or rather the numbers, of his host.  He rejected with indignation the option of the Koran or the tribute; and during several days the two armies were fiercely engaged from the dawn of light to the hour of noon, when their fatigue and the excessive heat compelled them to seek shelter and refreshment in their respective camps. The daughter of Gregory, a maid of incomparable beauty and spirit, is said to have fought by his side: from her earliest youth she was trained to mount on horseback, to draw the bow, and to wield the cimeter; and the richness of her arms and apparel were conspicuous in the foremost ranks of the battle.  Her hand, with a hundred thousand pieces of gold, was offered for the head of the Arabian general, and the youths of Africa were excited by the prospect of the glorious prize.  At the pressing solicitation of his brethren, Abdallah withdrew his person from the field; but the Saracens were discouraged by the retreat of their leader, and the repetition of these equal or unsuccessful conflicts. </p>

 </p> 
<p>     A noble Arabian, who afterwards became the adversary of Ali, and the father of a caliph, had signalized his valor in Egypt, and Zobeir &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A> was the first who planted the scaling-ladder against the walls of Babylon.  In the African war he was detached from the standard of Abdallah.  On the news of the battle, Zobeir, with twelve companions, cut his way through the camp of the Greeks, and pressed forwards, without tasting either food or repose, to partake of the dangers of his brethren.  He cast his eyes round the field: "Where," said he, "is our general?" "In his tent." "Is the tent a station for the general of the Moslems?" Abdallah represented with a blush the importance of his own life, and the temptation that was held forth by the Roman praefect. "Retort," said Zobeir, "on the infidels their ungenerous attempt.  Proclaim through the ranks that the head of Gregory shall be repaid with his captive daughter, and the equal sum of one hundred thousand pieces of gold." To the courage and discretion of Zobeir the lieutenant of the caliph intrusted the execution of his own stratagem, which inclined the long-disputed balance in favor of the Saracens. Supplying by activity and artifice the deficiency of numbers, a part of their forces lay concealed in their tents, while the remainder prolonged an irregular skirmish with the enemy till the sun was high in the heavens.  On both sides they retired with fainting steps: their horses were unbridled, their armor was laid aside, and the hostile nations prepared, or seemed to prepare, for the refreshment of the evening, and the encounter of the ensuing day.  On a sudden the charge was sounded; the Arabian camp poured forth a swarm of fresh and intrepid warriors; and the long line of the Greeks and Africans was surprised, assaulted, overturned, by new squadrons of the faithful, who, to the eye of fanaticism, might appear as a band of angels descending from the sky.  The praefect himself was slain by the hand of Zobeir: his daughter, who sought revenge and death, was surrounded and made prisoner; and the fugitives involved in their disaster the town of Sufetula, to which they escaped from the sabres and lances of the Arabs. Sufetula was built one hundred and fifty miles to the south of Carthage: a gentle declivity is watered by a running stream, and shaded by a grove of juniper-trees; and, in the ruins of a triumpha arch, a portico, and three temples of the Corinthian order, curiosity may yet admire the magnificence of the Romans. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A> After the fall of this opulent city, the provincials and Barbarians implored on all sides the mercy of the conqueror.  His vanity or his zeal might be flattered by offers of tribute or professions of faith: but his losses, his fatigues, and the progress of an epidemical disease, prevented a solid establishment; and the Saracens, after a campaign of fifteen months, retreated to the confines of Egypt, with the captives and the wealth of their African expedition.  The caliph's fifth was granted to a favorite, on the nominal payment of five hundred thousand pieces of gold; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A> but the state was doubly injured by this fallacious transaction, if each foot-soldier had shared one thousand, and each horseman three thousand, pieces, in the real division of the plunder.  The author of the death of Gregory was expected to have claimed the most precious reward of the victory: from his silence it might be presumed that he had fallen in the battle, till the tears and exclamations of the praefect's daughter at the sight of Zobeir revealed the valor and modesty of that gallant soldier.  The unfortunate virgin was offered, and almost rejected as a slave, by her father's murderer, who coolly declared that his sword was consecrated to the service of religion; and that he labored for a recompense far above the charms of mortal beauty, or the riches of this transitory life.  A reward congenial to his temper was the honorable commission of announcing to the caliph Othman the success of his arms.  The companions the chiefs, and the people, were assembled in the mosch of Medina, to hear the interesting narrative of Zobeir; and as the orator forgot nothing except the merit of his own counsels and actions, the name of Abdallah was joined by the Arabians with the heroic names of Caled and Amrou. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_519"></A><A HREF="#fn_519"><FONT SIZE="1">145</FONT></A> </p>

A Mahometan writer brings a similar charge against the Crusaders.  The library of Tripoli is said to have contained the incredible number of three millions of volumes.  On the capture of the city, Count Bertram of St. Giles, entering the first room, which contained nothing but the Koran, ordered the whole to be burnt, as the works of the false prophet of Arabia.

Yet the fact is positively asserted by the ancients.  Diodorus Siculus (l. i. p. 33) speaks of it in the most distinct manner as existing in his time.  So, also, Strabo, (l. xvii. p. 805.) Pliny (vol. vi. p. 29) says that the canal which united the two seas was navigable, (alveus navigabilis.) The indications furnished by Ptolemy and by the Arabic historian, Makrisi, show that works were executed under the reign of Hadrian to repair the canal and extend the navigation; it then received the name of the River of Trajan Lucian, (in his Pseudomantis, p. 44,) says that he went by water from Alexandria to Clysma, on the Red Sea. Testimonies of the 6th and of the 8th century show that the communication was not interrupted at that time. See the French translation of Strabo, vol. v. p. 382.  St. Martin vol. xi. p. 299. - M.</P>

Even the supine Turks have agitated the old project of joining the two seas. (Memoires du Baron de Tott, tom. iv.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_502"></A><A HREF="daf05020.htm#fr_502">128</A> A small volume, des Merveilles, &c., de l'Egypte, composed in the xiiith century by Murtadi of Cairo, and translated from an Arabic Ms. of Cardinal Mazarin, was published by Pierre Vatier, Paris, 1666.  The antiquities of Egypt are wild and legendary; but the writer deserves credit and esteem for his account of the conquest and geography of his native country, (see the correspondence of Amrou and Omar, p. 279 - 289.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_503"></A><A HREF="daf05020.htm#fr_503">129</A> In a twenty years' residence at Cairo, the consul Maillet had contemplated that varying scene, the Nile, (lettre ii. particularly p. 70, 75;) the fertility of the land, (lettre ix.) From a college at Cambridge, the poetic eye of Gray had seen the same objects with a keener glance: -       What wonder in the sultry climes that spread,      Where Nile, redundant o'er his summer bed,      From his broad bosom life and verdure flings,      And broods o'er Egypt with his watery wings:      If with adventurous oar, and ready sail,      The dusky people drive before the gale:      Or on frail floats to neighboring cities ride.      That rise and glitter o'er the ambient tide. </p>

He mentions this number as the common opinion; and adds, that the generality of these villages contain two or three thousand persons, and that many of them are more populous than our large cities.</P>

The twenty millions are computed from the following data: one twelfth of mankind above sixty, one third below sixteen, the proportion of men to women as seventeen or sixteen, (Recherches sur la Population de la France, p. 71, 72.) The president Goguet (Origine des Arts, &c., tom. iii. p. 26, &c.) Bestows twenty-seven millions on ancient Egypt, because the seventeen hundred companions of Sesostris were born on the same day.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_507"></A><A HREF="daf05020.htm#fr_507">133</A> Elmacin, Hist. Saracen. p. 218; and this gross lump is swallowed without scruple by D'Herbelot, (Bibliot. Orient. p. 1031,) Ar. buthnot, (Tables of Ancient Coins, p. 262,) and De Guignes, (Hist. des Huns, tom. iii. p. 135.) They might allege the not less extravagant liberality of Appian in favor of the Ptolemies (in praefat.) of seventy four myriads, 740,000 talents, an annual income of 185, or near 300 millions of pounds sterling, according as we reckon by the Egyptian or the Alexandrian talent, (Bernard, de Ponderibus Antiq. p. 186.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_508"></A><A HREF="daf05020.htm#fr_508">134</A> See the measurement of D'Anville, (Mem. sur l'Egypte, p. 23, &c.) After some peevish cavils, M. Pauw (Recherches sur les Egyptiens, tom. i. p. 118 - 121) can only enlarge his reckoning to 2250 square leagues.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_509"></A><A HREF="daf05020.htm#fr_509">135</A> Renaudot, Hist. Patriarch. Alexand. p. 334, who calls the common reading or version of Elmacin, error librarii.  His own emendation, of 4,300,000 pieces, in the ixth century, maintains a probable medium between the 3,000,000 which the Arabs acquired by the conquest of Egypt, idem, p. 168.) and the 2,400,000 which the sultan of Constantinople levied in the last century, (Pietro della Valle, tom. i. p. 352 Thevenot, part i. p. 824.) Pauw (Recherches, tom. ii. p. 365 - 373) gradually raises the revenue of the Pharaohs, the Ptolemies, and the Caesars, from six to fifteen millions of German crowns.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_510"></A><A HREF="daf05020.htm#fr_510">136</A> The list of Schultens (Index Geograph. ad calcem Vit. Saladin. p. 5) contains 2396 places; that of D'Anville, (Mem. sur l'Egypte, p. 29,) from the divan of Cairo, enumerates 2696.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_511"></A><A HREF="daf05020.htm#fr_511">137</A> See Maillet, (Description de l'Egypte, p. 28,) who seems to argue with candor and judgment.  I am much better satisfied with the observations than with the reading of the French consul.  He was ignorant of Greek and Latin literature, and his fancy is too much delighted with the fictions of the Arabs.  Their best knowledge is collected by Abulfeda, (Descript. Aegypt. Arab. et Lat. a Joh. David Michaelis, Gottingae, in 4to., 1776;) and in two recent voyages into Egypt, we are amused by Savary, and instructed by Volney.  I wish the latter could travel over the globe.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_512"></A><A HREF="daf05020.htm#fr_512">138</A> My conquest of Africa is drawn from two French interpreters of Arabic literature, Cardonne (Hist. de l'Afrique et de l'Espagne sous la Domination des Arabes, tom. i. p. 8 - 55) and Otter, (Hist. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xxi. p. 111 - 125, and 136.) They derive their principal information from Novairi, who composed, A.D. 1331 an Encyclopaedia in more than twenty volumes.  The five general parts successively treat of, 1. Physics; 2. Man; 3. Animals; 4. Plants; and, 5. History; and the African affairs are discussed in the vith chapter of the vth section of this last part, (Reiske, Prodidagmata ad Hagji Chalifae Tabulas, p. 232 - 234.) Among the older historians who are quoted by Navairi we may distinguish the original narrative of a soldier who led the van of the Moslems.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_514"></A><A HREF="daf05020.htm#fr_514">140</A> The province and city of Tripoli are described by Leo Africanus (in Navigatione et Viaggi di Ramusio, tom. i. Venetia, 1550, fol. 76, verso) and Marmol, (Description de l'Afrique, tom. ii. p. 562.) The first of these writers was a Moor, a scholar, and a traveller, who composed or translated his African geography in a state of captivity at Rome, where he had assumed the name and religion of Pope Leo X.  In a similar captivity among the Moors, the Spaniard Marmol, a soldier of Charles V., compiled his Description of Africa, translated by D'Ablancourt into French, (Paris, 1667, 3 vols. in 4to.) Marmol had read and seen, but he is destitute of the curious and extensive observation which abounds in the original work of Leo the African.</P>

His valor at the siege of Babylon, if indeed it be the same person, is mentioned by Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p. 308)</P>
