### Chapter LIV: Origin And Doctrine Of The Paulicians. Part II.

About the middle of the eight century, Constantine, surnamed Copronymus
by the worshippers of images, had made an expedition into Armenia, and
found, in the cities of Melitene and Theodosiopolis, a great number of
Paulicians, his kindred heretics. As a favor, or punishment, he
transplanted them from the banks of the Euphrates to Constantinople and
Thrace; and by this emigration their doctrine was introduced and
diffused in Europe.  <span id="fr_852"></span>[21](#fn_852.md) If the
sectaries of the metropolis were soon mingled with the promiscuous mass,
those of the country struck a deep root in a foreign soil. The
Paulicians of Thrace resisted the storms of persecution, maintained a
secret correspondence with their Armenian brethren, and gave aid and
comfort to their preachers, who solicited, not without success, the
infant faith of the Bulgarians.  <span id="fr_853"></span>[22](#fn_853.md)
In the tenth century, they were restored and multiplied by a more
powerful colony, which John Zimisces  <span
id="fr_854"></span>[23](#fn_854.md) transported from the Chalybian hills to
the valleys of Mount Haemus. The Oriental clergy who would have
preferred the destruction, impatiently sighed for the absence, of the
Manichaeans: the warlike emperor had felt and esteemed their valor:
their attachment to the Saracens was pregnant with mischief; but, on the
side of the Danube, against the Barbarians of Scythia, their service
might be useful, and their loss would be desirable. Their exile in a
distant land was softened by a free toleration: the Paulicians held the
city of Philippopolis and the keys of Thrace; the Catholics were their
subjects; the Jacobite emigrants their associates: they occupied a line
of villages and castles in Macedonia and Epirus; and many native
Bulgarians were associated to the communion of arms and heresy. As long
as they were awed by power and treated with moderation, their voluntary
bands were distinguished in the armies of the empire; and the courage of
these dogs, ever greedy of war, ever thirsty of human blood, is noticed
with astonishment, and almost with reproach, by the pusillanimous
Greeks. The same spirit rendered them arrogant and contumacious: they
were easily provoked by caprice or injury; and their privileges were
often violated by the faithless bigotry of the government and clergy. In
the midst of the Norman war, two thousand five hundred Manichaeans
deserted the standard of Alexius Comnenus,  <span
id="fr_855"></span>[24](#fn_855.md) and retired to their native homes. He
dissembled till the moment of revenge; invited the chiefs to a friendly
conference; and punished the innocent and guilty by imprisonment,
confiscation, and baptism. In an interval of peace, the emperor
undertook the pious office of reconciling them to the church and state:
his winter quarters were fixed at Philippopolis; and the thirteenth
apostle, as he is styled by his pious daughter, consumed whole days and
nights in theological controversy. His arguments were fortified, their
obstinacy was melted, by the honors and rewards which he bestowed on the
most eminent proselytes; and a new city, surrounded with gardens,
enriched with immunities, and dignified with his own name, was founded
by Alexius for the residence of his vulgar converts. The important
station of Philippopolis was wrested from their hands; the contumacious
leaders were secured in a dungeon, or banished from their country; and
their lives were spared by the prudence, rather than the mercy, of an
emperor, at whose command a poor and solitary heretic was burnt alive
before the church of St. Sophia.  <span id="fr_856"></span>[25](#fn_856.md)
But the proud hope of eradicating the prejudices of a nation was
speedily overturned by the invincible zeal of the Paulicians, who ceased
to dissemble or refused to obey. After the departure and death of
Alexius, they soon resumed their civil and religious laws. In the
beginning of the thirteenth century, their pope or primate (a manifest
corruption) resided on the confines of Bulgaria, Croatia, and Dalmatia,
and governed, by his vicars, the filial congregations of Italy and
France.  <span id="fr_857"></span>[26](#fn_857.md) From that aera, a minute
scrutiny might prolong and perpetuate the chain of tradition. At the end
of the last age, the sect or colony still inhabited the valleys of Mount
Haemus, where their ignorance and poverty were more frequently tormented
by the Greek clergy than by the Turkish government. The modern
Paulicians have lost all memory of their origin; and their religion is
disgraced by the worship of the cross, and the practice of bloody
sacrifice, which some captives have imported from the wilds of Tartary.
 <span id="fr_858"></span>[27](#fn_858.md)

In the West, the first teachers of the Manichaean theology had been
repulsed by the people, or suppressed by the prince. The favor and
success of the Paulicians in the eleventh and twelfth centuries must be
imputed to the strong, though secret, discontent which armed the most
pious Christians against the church of Rome. Her avarice was oppressive,
her despotism odious; less degenerate perhaps than the Greeks in the
worship of saints and images, her innovations were more rapid and
scandalous: she had rigorously defined and imposed the doctrine of
transubstantiation: the lives of the Latin clergy were more corrupt, and
the Eastern bishops might pass for the successors of the apostles, if
they were compared with the lordly prelates, who wielded by turns the
crosier, the sceptre, and the sword. Three different roads might
introduce the Paulicians into the heart of Europe. After the conversion
of Hungary, the pilgrims who visited Jerusalem might safely follow the
course of the Danube: in their journey and return they passed through
Philippopolis; and the sectaries, disguising their name and heresy,
might accompany the French or German caravans to their respective
countries. The trade and dominion of Venice pervaded the coast of the
Adriatic, and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to foreigners of
every climate and religion. Under the Byzantine standard, the Paulicians
were often transported to the Greek provinces of Italy and Sicily: in
peace and war, they freely conversed with strangers and natives, and
their opinions were silently propagated in Rome, Milan, and the kingdoms
beyond the Alps.  <span id="fr_859"></span>[28](#fn_859.md) It was soon
discovered, that many thousand Catholics of every rank, and of either
sex, had embraced the Manichaean heresy; and the flames which consumed
twelve canons of Orleans was the first act and signal of persecution.
The Bulgarians,  <span id="fr_860"></span>[29](#fn_860.md) a name so
innocent in its origin, so odious in its application, spread their
branches over the face of Europe. United in common hatred of idolatry
and Rome, they were connected by a form of episcopal and presbyterian
government; their various sects were discriminated by some fainter or
darker shades of theology; but they generally agreed in the two
principles, the contempt of the Old Testament and the denial of the body
of Christ, either on the cross or in the eucharist. A confession of
simple worship and blameless manners is extorted from their enemies; and
so high was their standard of perfection, that the increasing
congregations were divided into two classes of disciples, of those who
practised, and of those who aspired. It was in the country of the
Albigeois,  <span id="fr_861"></span>[30](#fn_861.md) in the southern
provinces of France, that the Paulicians were most deeply implanted; and
the same vicissitudes of martyrdom and revenge which had been displayed
in the neighborhood of the Euphrates, were repeated in the thirteenth
century on the banks of the Rhone. The laws of the Eastern emperors were
revived by Frederic the Second. The insurgents of Tephrice were
represented by the barons and cities of Languedoc: Pope Innocent III.
surpassed the sanguinary fame of Theodora. It was in cruelty alone that
her soldiers could equal the heroes of the Crusades, and the cruelty of
her priests was far excelled by the founders of the Inquisition;  <span
id="fr_862"></span>[31](#fn_862.md) an office more adapted to confirm, than
to refute, the belief of an evil principle. The visible assemblies of
the Paulicians, or Albigeois, were extirpated by fire and sword; and the
bleeding remnant escaped by flight, concealment, or Catholic conformity.
But the invincible spirit which they had kindled still lived and
breathed in the Western world. In the state, in the church, and even in
the cloister, a latent succession was preserved of the disciples of St.
Paul; who protested against the tyranny of Rome, embraced the Bible as
the rule of faith, and purified their creed from all the visions of the
Gnostic theology.  <span id="fr_863"></span>[\*\_0042](#fn_863.md) The
struggles of Wickliff in England, of Huss in Bohemia, were premature and
ineffectual; but the names of Zuinglius, Luther, and Calvin, are
pronounced with gratitude as the deliverers of nations.

A philosopher, who calculates the degree of their merit and the value of
their reformation, will prudently ask from what articles of faith, above
or against our reason, they have enfranchised the Christians; for such
enfranchisement is doubtless a benefit so far as it may be compatible
with truth and piety. After a fair discussion, we shall rather be
surprised by the timidity, than scandalized by the freedom, of our first
reformers.  <span id="fr_864"></span>[32](#fn_864.md) With the Jews, they
adopted the belief and defence of all the Hebrew Scriptures, with all
their prodigies, from the garden of Eden to the visions of the prophet
Daniel; and they were bound, like the Catholics, to justify against the
Jews the abolition of a divine law. In the great mysteries of the
Trinity and Incarnation the reformers were severely orthodox: they
freely adopted the theology of the four, or the six first councils; and
with the Athanasian creed, they pronounced the eternal damnation of all
who did not believe the Catholic faith. Transubstantiation, the
invisible change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of
Christ, is a tenet that may defy the power of argument and pleasantry;
but instead of consulting the evidence of their senses, of their sight,
their feeling, and their taste, the first Protestants were entangled in
their own scruples, and awed by the words of Jesus in the institution of
the sacrament. Luther maintained a corporeal, and Calvin a real,
presence of Christ in the eucharist; and the opinion of Zuinglius, that
it is no more than a spiritual communion, a simple memorial, has slowly
prevailed in the reformed churches.  <span
id="fr_865"></span>[33](#fn_865.md) But the loss of one mystery was amply
compensated by the stupendous doctrines of original sin, redemption,
faith, grace, and predestination, which have been strained from the
epistles of St. Paul. These subtile questions had most assuredly been
prepared by the fathers and schoolmen; but the final improvement and
popular use may be attributed to the first reformers, who enforced them
as the absolute and essential terms of salvation. Hitherto the weight of
supernatural belief inclines against the Protestants; and many a sober
Christian would rather admit that a wafer is God, than that God is a
cruel and capricious tyrant.

Yet the services of Luther and his rivals are solid and important; and
the philosopher must own his obligations to these fearless enthusiasts.
 <span id="fr_866"></span>[34](#fn_866.md) I. By their hands the lofty
fabric of superstition, from the abuse of indulgences to the intercesson
of the Virgin, has been levelled with the ground. Myriads of both sexes
of the monastic profession were restored to the liberty and labors of
social life. A hierarchy of saints and angels, of imperfect and
subordinate deities, were stripped of their temporal power, and reduced
to the enjoyment of celestial happiness; their images and relics were
banished from the church; and the credulity of the people was no longer
nourished with the daily repetition of miracles and visions. The
imitation of Paganism was supplied by a pure and spiritual worship of
prayer and thanksgiving, the most worthy of man, the least unworthy of
the Deity. It only remains to observe, whether such sublime simplicity
be consistent with popular devotion; whether the vulgar, in the absence
of all visible objects, will not be inflamed by enthusiasm, or
insensibly subside in languor and indifference. II. The chain of
authority was broken, which restrains the bigot from thinking as he
pleases, and the slave from speaking as he thinks: the popes, fathers,
and councils, were no longer the supreme and infallible judges of the
world; and each Christian was taught to acknowledge no law but the
Scriptures, no interpreter but his own conscience. This freedom,
however, was the consequence, rather than the design, of the
Reformation. The patriot reformers were ambitious of succeeding the
tyrants whom they had dethroned. They imposed with equal rigor their
creeds and confessions; they asserted the right of the magistrate to
punish heretics with death. The pious or personal animosity of Calvin
proscribed in Servetus  <span id="fr_867"></span>[35](#fn_867.md) the guilt
of his own rebellion;  <span id="fr_868"></span>[36](#fn_868.md) and the
flames of Smithfield, in which he was afterwards consumed, had been
kindled for the Anabaptists by the zeal of Cranmer.  <span
id="fr_869"></span>[37](#fn_869.md) The nature of the tiger wa s the same,
but he was gradually deprived of his teeth and fangs. A spiritual and
temporal kingdom was possessed by the Roman pontiff; the Protestant
doctors were subjects of an humble rank, without revenue or
jurisdiction. His decrees were consecrated by the antiquity of the
Catholic church: their arguments and disputes were submitted to the
people; and their appeal to private judgment was accepted beyond their
wishes, by curiosity and enthusiasm. Since the days of Luther and
Calvin, a secret reformation has been silently working in the bosom of
the reformed churches; many weeds of prejudice were eradicated; and the
disciples of Erasmus  <span id="fr_870"></span>[38](#fn_870.md) diffused a
spirit of freedom and moderation. The liberty of conscience has been
claimed as a common benefit, an inalienable right:  <span
id="fr_871"></span>[39](#fn_871.md) the free governments of Holland  <span
id="fr_872"></span>[40](#fn_872.md) and England  <span
id="fr_873"></span>[41](#fn_873.md) introduced the practice of toleration;
and the narrow allowance of the laws has been enlarged by the prudence
and humanity of the times. In the exercise, the mind has understood the
limits of its powers, and the words and shadows that might amuse the
child can no longer satisfy his manly reason. The volumes of controversy
are overspread with cobwebs: the doctrine of a Protestant church is far
removed from the knowledge or belief of its private members; and the
forms of orthodoxy, the articles of faith, are subscribed with a sigh,
or a smile, by the modern clergy. Yet the friends of Christianity are
alarmed at the boundless impulse of inquiry and scepticism. The
predictions of the Catholics are accomplished: the web of mystery is
unravelled by the Arminians, Arians, and Socinians, whose number must
not be computed from their separate congregations; and the pillars of
Revelation are shaken by those men who preserve the name without the
substance of religion, who indulge the license without the temper of
philosophy.  <span id="fr_874"></span>[42](#fn_874.md)  <span

<span id="fn_852"></span>[21](daf05033.htm#fr_852.md) Copronymus
transported his heretics; and thus says Cedrenus, (p. 463,) who has
copied the annals of Theophanes.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[22](daf05033.htm#fr_853.md) Petrus Siculus, who
resided nine months at Tephrice (A.D. 870) for the ransom of captives,
(p. 764,) was informed of their intended mission, and addressed his
preservative, the Historia Manichaeorum to the new archbishop of the
Bulgarians, (p. 754.)

<span id="fn_854"></span>[23](daf05033.htm#fr_854.md) The colony of
Paulicians and Jacobites transplanted by John Zimisces (A.D. 970) from
Armenia to Thrace, is mentioned by Zonaras (tom. ii. l. xvii. p. 209)
and Anna Comnena, (Alexiad, l. xiv. p. 450, &c.)

<span id="fn_855"></span>[24](daf05033.htm#fr_855.md) The Alexiad of Anna
Comnena (l. v. p. 131, l. vi. p. 154, 155, l. xiv. p. 450 - 457, with
the Annotations of Ducange) records the transactions of her apostolic
father with the Manichaeans, whose abominable heresy she was desirous of
refuting.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[25](daf05033.htm#fr_856.md) Basil, a monk, and
the author of the Bogomiles, a sect of Gnostics, who soon vanished,
(Anna Comnena, Alexiad, l. xv. p. 486 - 494 Mosheim, Hist.
Ecclesiastica, p. 420.)

<span id="fn_857"></span>[26](daf05033.htm#fr_857.md) Matt. Paris, Hist.
Major, p. 267. This passage of our English historian is alleged by
Ducange in an excellent note on Villehardouin (No. 208,) who found the
Paulicians at Philippopolis the friends of the Bulgarians.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[27](daf05033.htm#fr_858.md) See Marsigli, Stato
Militare dell' Imperio Ottomano, p. 24.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[28](daf05033.htm#fr_859.md) The introduction of
the Paulicians into Italy and France is amply discussed by Muratori
(Antiquitat. Italiae Medii Aevi, tom. v. dissert. lx. p. 81 - 152) and
Mosheim, (p. 379 - 382, 419 - 422.) Yet both have overlooked a curious
passage of William the Apulian, who clearly describes them in a battle
between the Greeks and Normans, A.D. 1040, (in Muratori, Script. Rerum
Ital. tom. v. p. 256: )

Cum Graecis aderant quidam, quos pessimus error Fecerat amentes, et ab
ipso nomen habebant.

But he is so ignorant of their doctrine as to make them a kind of
Sabellians or Patripassians.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[29](daf05033.htm#fr_860.md) Bulgari, Boulgres,
Bougres, a national appellation, has been applied by the French as a
term of reproach to usurers and unnatural sinners. The Paterini, or
Patelini, has been made to signify a smooth and flattering hypocrite,
such as l'Avocat Patelin of that original and pleasant farce, (Ducange,
Gloss. Latinitat. Medii et Infimi Aevi.) The Manichaeans were likewise
named Cathari or the pure, by corruption. Gazari, &c.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[30](daf05033.htm#fr_861.md) Of the laws, crusade,
and persecution against the Albigeois, a just, though general, idea is
expressed by Mosheim, (p. 477 - 481.) The detail may be found in the
ecclesiastical historians, ancient and modern, Catholics and
Protestants; and amongst these Fleury is the most impartial and
moderate.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[31](daf05033.htm#fr_862.md) The Acts (Liber
Sententiarum) of the Inquisition of Tholouse (A.D. 1307 - 1323) have
been published by Limborch, (Amstelodami, 1692,) with a previous History
of the Inquisition in general. They deserved a more learned and critical
editor. As we must not calumniate even Satan, or the Holy Office, I will
observe, that of a list of criminals which fills nineteen folio pages,
only fifteen men and four women were delivered to the secular arm.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[\*\_0042](daf05033.htm#fr_863.md) The popularity
of "Milner's History of the Church" with some readers, may make it
proper to observe, that his attempt to exculpate the Paulicians from the
charge of Gnosticism or Manicheism is in direct defiance, if not in
ignorance, of all the original authorities. Gibbon himself, it appears,
was not acquainted with the work of Photius, "Contra Manicheos
Repullulantes," the first book of which was edited by Montfaucon,
Bibliotheca Coisliniana, pars ii. p. 349, 375, the whole by Wolf, in his
Anecdota Graeca. Hamburg 1722. Compare a very sensible tract. Letter to
Rev. S. R. Maitland, by J G. Dowling, M. A. London, 1835. - M.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[32](daf05033.htm#fr_864.md) The opinions and
proceedings of the reformers are exposed in the second part of the
general history of Mosheim; but the balance, which he has held with so
clear an eye, and so steady a hand, begins to incline in favor of his
Lutheran brethren.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[33](daf05033.htm#fr_865.md) Under Edward VI. our
reformation was more bold and perfect, but in the fundamental articles
of the church of England, a strong and explicit declaration against the
real presence was obliterated in the original copy, to please the people
or the Lutherans, or Queen Elizabeth, (Burnet's History of the
Reformation, vol. ii. p. 82, 128, 302.)

<span id="fn_866"></span>[34](daf05033.htm#fr_866.md) "Had it not been for
such men as Luther and myself," said the fanatic Whiston to Halley the
philosopher, "you would now be kneeling before an image of St.
Winifred."

<span id="fn_867"></span>[35](daf05033.htm#fr_867.md) The article of Servet
in the Dictionnaire Critique of Chauffepie is the best account which I
have seen of this shameful transaction. See likewise the Abbe d'Artigny,
Nouveaux Memoires d'Histoire, &c., tom. ii. p. 55 - 154.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[36](daf05033.htm#fr_868.md) I am more deeply
scandalized at the single execution of Servetus, than at the hecatombs
which have blazed in the Auto de Fes of Spain and Portugal. 1. The zeal
of Calvin seems to have been envenomed by personal malice, and perhaps
envy. He accused his adversary before their common enemies, the judges
of Vienna, and betrayed, for his destruction, the sacred trust of a
private correspondence. 2. The deed of cruelty was not varnished by the
pretence of danger to the church or state. In his passage through
Geneva, Servetus was a harmless stranger, who neither preached, nor
printed, nor made proselytes. 3. A Catholic inquisition yields the same
obedience which he requires, but Calvin violated the golden rule of
doing as he would be done by; a rule which I read in a moral treatise of
Isocrates (in Nicocle, tom. i. p. 93, edit. Battie) four hundred years
before the publication of the Gospel.

Note: Gibbon has not accurately rendered the sense of this passage,
which does not contain the maxim of charity Do unto others as you would
they should do unto you, but simply the maxim of justice, Do not to
others the which would offend you if they should do it to you. - G.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[37](daf05033.htm#fr_869.md) See Burnet, vol. ii.
p. 84 - 86. The sense and humanity of the young king were oppressed by
the authority of the primate.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[38](daf05033.htm#fr_870.md) Erasmus may be
considered as the father of rational theology. After a slumber of a
hundred years, it was revived by the Arminians of Holland, Grotius,
Limborch, and Le Clerc; in England by Chillingworth, the latitudinarians
of Cambridge, (Burnet, Hist. of Own Times, vol. i. p. 261 - 268, octavo
edition.) Tillotson, Clarke, Hoadley, &c.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[39](daf05033.htm#fr_871.md) I am sorry to
observe, that the three writers of the last age, by whom the rights of
toleration have been so nobly defended, Bayle, Leibnitz, and Locke, are
all laymen and philosophers.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[40](daf05033.htm#fr_872.md) See the excellent
chapter of Sir William Temple on the Religion of the United Provinces. I
am not satisfied with Grotius, (de Rebus Belgicis, Annal. l. i. p. 13,
14, edit. in 12mo.,) who approves the Imperial laws of persecution, and
only condemns the bloody tribunal of the inquisition.

<span id="fn_873"></span>[41](daf05033.htm#fr_873.md) Sir William
Blackstone (Commentaries, vol. iv. p. 53, 54) explains the law of
England as it was fixed at the Revolution. The exceptions of Papists,
and of those who deny the Trinity, would still have a tolerable scope
for persecution if the national spirit were not more effectual than a
hundred statutes.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[42](daf05033.htm#fr_874.md) I shall recommend to
public animadversion two passages in Dr. Priestley, which betray the
ultimate tendency of his opinions. At the first of these (Hist. of the
Corruptions of Christianity, vol. i. p. 275, 276) the priest, at the
second (vol. ii. p. 484) the magistrate, may tremble!

<span id="fn_875"></span>[\*\_0043](daf05033.htm#fr_875.md) There is
something ludicrous, if it were not offensive, in Gibbon holding up to
"public animadversion" the opinions of any believer in Christianity,
however imperfect his creed. The observations which the whole of this
passage on the effects of the reformation, in which much truth and
justice is mingled with much prejudice, would suggest, could not
possibly be compressed into a note; and would indeed embrace the whole
religious and irreligious history of the time which has elapsed since
Gibbon wrote. - M.
