------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains texts from ancient Greece and Rome, primarily
about Classical Pagan beliefs. However, any text which has survived from
this period of antiquity is, by definition, a classic. Many of these
texts were only saved from the flames of the dark ages in locations
remote from Rome and Athens, such as the legendary city of Timbuktu in
central Africa, Irish monastaries, and by Islamic scholars in centers of
learning as Baghdad.

### About the photos

I took the photographs in this section in 1971 on an Easter Week tour of
Greece with a group of High School classics students from Southern
California. Escorted by nuns (I was one of the only public school
students in the group), our tour visited Athens, Delphi, Mycenae and
Knossos. The photos were taken with a cheap Instamatic. I recently found
these photos and scanned some of them to accompany this section  
  
[\[View\]](img/sounion0.jpg.md)  The photo on this page is the Temple of
Poseidon at Sounion. Isadora Duncan danced there. I threw the last watch
I ever owned into the sea from this promontory.  
[\[View\]](img/mycenae0.jpg.md)  The photo on the works of Homer index page
is the entrance to the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae. A fabulous hoard
of gold artifacts was found in it when it was excavated, including a
gold death mask which Schliemann decided was that of Agamemnon. The
interior is shaped like a beehive and has bizarre acoustics.  
[\[View\]](img/mycenae1.jpg.md)  The photo on the Iliad index page is the
arch of the Lion Gate at Mycenae; many of the key figures of the Iliad
(if they actually existed) must have walked under this arch.  
[\[View\]](img/aegean0.jpg.md)  The photo on the Odyssey index page is a
view of the Aegean which I took from the cruise ship taking us to
Crete.  
[\[View\]](img/acrop0.jpg.md)  The photo on the Bulfinch index page is a
panorama of the Acropolis.  
[\[View\]](img/acrop1.jpg.md) The photo on the Aesop index page is yet
another view of the Acropolis.  
[\[View\]](img/acrop2.jpg.md) Yet another view of the Acropolis.

Another photo I haven't found a home for:

detail.
