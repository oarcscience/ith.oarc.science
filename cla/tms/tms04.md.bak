# CHAPTER II

## POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE MANA (TABOO)

As soon as man becomes self-conscious, he feels that anything different
from himself is potentially, if not actually, dangerous: it contains a
strange power to do him harm, and he must, if this be possible, force it
to do him good. If experience teaches him that it can only do him harm,
he must shun it, or, if this be impossible, he must rid himself of the
evil effects of the contagion. We have given the name mana to this
mysterious force, whether actually helpful or harmful or potentially so.
Mana which has been found to be harmful we call negative mana; mana
which has been found to be good is usually called simply mana; to this
we have given the name positive mana. For example, with the growth of
agriculture, rain is found necessary for the success of crops, and so a
magic process, imitating the overflowing of the heavens, is performed to
induce rain. This is rain in its positive or helpful aspect (positive
mana). But rain sometimes has the power to harm (negative mana), and so
the savage uses a magic act to avert rains which are flooding his
fields.

Negative mana has been considered a form of negative magic. Just as in
homoeopathic or in contagious magic (as we shall see in our chapter on
magic acts) <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) man performs certain
actions in accordance with the laws of similarity or contact that
certain results may ensue, so, in accordance with the same principles,
he will refrain from certain acts, or things, or persons, for fear that
evil may result. It would be better, as we have suggested, to consider
taboo as negative mana; for certainly all cases of taboo cannot be
classified as negative magic. Positive and negative mana, then, are
mysterious powers--good and evil--and magic (magic act and incantation)
is the means used to secure the good and to avoid or ward off the evil.

Whatever the origin of taboo, the feeling in the mind of the person
involved is that certain objects, actions, or persons are, for some
reason unknown to him, possessed of a mysterious power which makes them
dangerous. They should, therefore, be avoided. If, for some reason,
contact is unavoidable, purificatory rites must be performed to wipe out
the contagion--usually by the use of water. This involves magic action.
There is scarcely a person, for example, unless he be a physician or an
employee in an abattoir, who does not shrink from the sight of blood.
Again, foreigners cause feelings of fear, as does a strange food, a new
system of medicine, or a novel religious cult; but when one has eaten
the strange food and found it palatable, when one has adopted the new
system of medicine or the religious cult, the fears vanish.

The dread of danger inherent in things arises from several causes: it
may, as some think, be instinctive, or it may arise from the savage's
ignorance of the things which surround him in his struggle for
existence. This ignorance may be due, as we have already indicated, to
the fact that his brain is not developed enough physiologically for him
to make proper associations and to come to right conclusions. Coupled
with this is an unusually active imagination. From these ultimate causes
spring certain specific causes of taboo: the thing may be strange, or
new, or abnormal, and hence dangerous. One may have had unpleasant
associations with something which resembles the thing feared; the taboo
may have been deliberately made by the priest or chieftain for selfish
or even for social reasons; or the taboo may have arisen from trial and
error, until the mana has been found to be positive or negative.
However, taboo goes so far back into the dawn-twilight of the race and
contains so many complex elements that it is difficult to explain every
case satisfactorily.

### Blood

We now return to the story of Torquatus with which we introduced our
first chapter. Torquatus, it will be recalled, tore a bloody necklace
from a Gaul whom he had killed in a hand-to-hand combat, and placed it,
still reeking with blood, about his own neck. The feeling, vague and
undefined though it was to the mind of the Roman, seems to be that, by
wearing the Gaul's necklace about his own neck and by coming in contact
with his blood, Torquatus might possess, in addition to his own personal
strength, the strength of the Gaul.

A striking parallel to this incident is recorded in a much later day.
The Emperor Commodus Antoninus often appeared before the people as a
gladiator. According to the story, shortly before his death he plunged
his hand into the wound of a slain gladiator and wiped the blood on his
own forehead. He apparently had the feeling that he could thus, by
contact with the blood of the gladiator, acquire from him bravery and
skill, which he most certainly lacked, for the Roman people often
snickered at his pretense of gladiatorial prowess. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md)

The interpretations of these actions may become clearer through a
somewhat detailed study of the attitude of the Romans toward blood. But
first let us examine the statements of two modern scholars on this
subject. W. Warde Fowler writes thus about the taboo on blood among the
Romans: <span id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30.md) ". . . at Rome, so far as I
can discover, there was in historical times hardly a trace left of this
anxiety in its original form of taboo." Again, H. J. Rose says: <span
id="fr_31"></span>[4](#fn_31.md) " . . . as the late W. Warde Fowler has
repeatedly pointed out, the Romans had very little, if any,
superstitious horror of blood."

That the Romans had little superstitious horror of blood seems a natural
inference to make when we consider the fact that the Roman citizen was
primarily a soldier, hardened to the shedding of blood on the
battlefields, and that the blood of sacrifice at the altars and at the
gladiatorial combats was an everyday sight. Despite this, a considerable
body of evidence can be brought forward to show that the Romans did have
an uncanny feeling about blood. Seneca, for example, writes: <span
id="fr_32"></span>[5](#fn_32.md) "Some say that they themselves suspect
that there is actually in blood a certain force potent to avert and
repel a rain cloud." It was dangerous to have the blood of a living
person over one's head. <span id="fr_33"></span>[6](#fn_33.md) Tibullus
curses with these words a woman whom he hates: <span
id="fr_34"></span>[7](#fn_34.md) "May she eat bloody food." The skeptical
Ovid refuses to believe that mere water can wipe away bloodstains. <span
id="fr_35"></span>[8](#fn_35.md) Some Romans believed that blood was the
seat of the soul. <span id="fr_36"></span>[9](#fn_36.md) The ancient
Hebrews also believed that the life resided in the blood. <span
id="fr_37"></span>[10](#fn_37.md)

The dangerous character of blood is further suggested by the common
accounts of rains of blood. <span id="fr_38"></span>[11](#fn_38.md) There
is at least one reference to a rain of flesh. <span
id="fr_39"></span>[12](#fn_39.md) Among the prodigies recorded during the
Hannibalic War, we read that at Praeneste shields sweated blood, that
the waters of Caere were mixed with blood, that both water and blood
gushed from the springs of Hercules, and that bloody ears of wheat were
garnered at Antium. <span id="fr_40"></span>[13](#fn_40.md) Again, later in
the same war, reports reached Rome that statues sweated blood, and that
again the waters of Caere were mixed with blood. <span
id="fr_41"></span>[14](#fn_41.md) Tullia, the daughter of Servius Tullius,
drove her carriage over the dead body of her father, and she was, in
consequence, spattered with blood. Some of this blood accidentally
contaminated her Penates and those of her husband. Soothsayers who were
consulted predicted that, because of this bloodstain, the last of the
Tarquins was doomed to suffer the same fate as Servius Tullius. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[15](#fn_42.md) Once, while Flaminius was sacrificing, a
calf broke away, spattering several spectators with its blood. This was
considered terrible and ominous by the people present. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[16](#fn_43.md) In 460 B.C., during the quarrels between
the plebeians and the Senate, a large number of slaves and exiles seized
the Capitol and the Citadel. After they had been driven out, the temple
was purified, since many of them had desecrated it with their
blood. <span id="fr_44"></span>[17](#fn_44.md) On one occasion, while the
Emperor Caligula was sacrificing, he was spattered with the blood of a
flamingo. Again, toward the end of the reign, during a performance of a
broad farce, an actor, playing the part of a brigand, vomited blood. At
the conclusion of the piece, a group of actors entertained the audience
with such a vigorous burlesque of the brigand's vomiting that the stage
overflowed with blood. These prodigies, among others, were believed to
forebode the death of Caligula. <span id="fr_45"></span>[18](#fn_45.md) The
Emperor Domitian abhorred blood; and once he proposed an edict that oxen
should not be sacrificed. <span id="fr_46"></span>[19](#fn_46.md)

We recall the horror of Sallust in recounting the gruesome story that
Catiline and his followers drank human blood to seal their covenant of
crime. <span id="fr_47"></span>[20](#fn_47.md) A similar charge was made
against the early Christians. Minucius Felix, the first of the Christian
Latin writers, in his Octavius, a work written to defend his faith,
writes (IX):

"What men say about the initiation of the novices is as abominable as it
is well known. A baby, covered with spelt to deceive the unwary, is set
before the person who is to be initiated into the sacred rites. The
initiate, roused to inflict blows which, because of the covering of
spelt, seem harmless, kills the child with hidden, secret stabs.
Then--shocking to tell--they thirstily lick up the baby's blood and
eagerly distribute its limbs. Through this victim they are linked in
covenant; through complicity in the crime they are pledged to mutual
silence."

This mystic association with blood finds curious expression in a story
recorded <span id="fr_48"></span>[21](#fn_48.md) about the mutiny of the
Roman soldiers under Germanicus. Later, realizing their crime, they felt
that, by shedding the blood of the ringleaders, they might atone for
their sins of rebellion. A bloody massacre took place in the camp. When
Germanicus appeared on the scene, the soldiers repented but, still
"seeing red," they wanted to cross the Rhine into Germany, again to
atone with their blood for their murdered comrades. A Roman would vow
vengeance by the bloodstained sword of a murderer. <span
id="fr_49"></span>[22](#fn_49.md) A curious bit of military lore is
recorded in Gellius. <span id="fr_50"></span>[23](#fn_50.md) According to
the old military laws, when a soldier had committed an offense involving
dishonor, a vein was opened, and the "bad blood" was let out. Gellius
has suggested that the procedure may have been medicinal at first and
may have been applied later to all soldiers for a variety of offenses.
The reason goes deep into the past of the Romans. The blood contained
the life principle of the man; and as he had shown by his actions that
his life-blood was bad, it was drawn off to allow better life to enter
his body.

It would seem that the earliest Roman sacrifices were bloodless. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[24](#fn_51.md) Ceres was said to have been the first to
receive animal sacrifice--the pig. <span id="fr_52"></span>[25](#fn_52.md)
Only bloodless sacrifices might be made to Genius on birthdays, though
it is probable that animal sacrifices were permitted on other
days. <span id="fr_53"></span>[26](#fn_53.md) The first day of the Festival
of Minerva had to be free from blood. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[27](#fn_54.md) No animal sacrifice was made to Venus nor
to Terminus on the Capitol. <span id="fr_55"></span>[28](#fn_55.md)
Originally there was no animal sacrifice on the Festival of Pales; and
the reason, as given by Plutarch <span id="fr_56"></span>[29](#fn_56.md)
was that the festival might be free from bloodstains. Fowler remarks
 <span id="fr_57"></span>[30](#fn_57.md) the absence of the mention of
blood in sacrifices, but he fails to recognize that this very absence is
an indication that blood was taboo.

The Priest of Jupiter (Flamen Dialis) was not allowed to mention raw
meat. <span id="fr_58"></span>[31](#fn_58.md) Plutarch suggests <span
id="fr_59"></span>[32](#fn_59.md) that the repulsive appearance of meat and
its likeness to the flesh of a wound may be the reason for the taboo.
This uncanny aversion which the Romans felt for raw meat is further
shown by a story told about the Emperor Maximus (238 A.D.). It seems
that at the time of his birth an eagle dropped a large piece of beef
into the house through the opening in the roof and that no one would
touch it because of superstitious fear. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[33](#fn_60.md) The Priest of Jupiter was forbidden also
to pass under a vine which was trained on an arbor. <span
id="fr_61"></span>[34](#fn_61.md) Frazer suggests a possible explanation of
this taboo. <span id="fr_62"></span>[35](#fn_62.md) The juice of the grape
was considered blood because it was red and looked like blood; and it
was believed to contain the spirit. Moreover, wine was intoxicating, and
so the soul of the vine could be felt actually at work in the person who
drank the wine. There is another possible interpretation of the
prohibition: the intertwining tendrils of the vine would make it
dangerous to a priest. <span id="fr_63"></span>[36](#fn_63.md)

Ovid represents Numa performing sacrifice, before which he had to
refrain from the pleasures of love and from flesh, and he might wear no
ring. <span id="fr_64"></span>[37](#fn_64.md) A priest who had been
splashed with the blood of a sacrificial animal was unclean until he had
changed his dress. <span id="fr_65"></span>[38](#fn_65.md) We recall that
AEneas could not touch his home-gods until he had cleansed the
bloodstains from his hands with pure water. <span
id="fr_66"></span>[39](#fn_66.md)

Blood, too, had a magic part in religious rites. We shall describe its
use in three of these.

On October fifteenth, the Field of Mars witnessed a chariot race. The
right-hand horse of the pair which won the race was killed, and blood
from his tail was allowed to drip onto the sacred hearth. <span
id="fr_67"></span>[40](#fn_67.md) This blood, together with the blood from
his head, was mixed with sulphur and with bean straw, and with the ashes
of unborn calves which had been sacrificed at the Festival of the
Slaying of the Pregnant Cows (Fordicidia) on April fifteenth. The
mixture was dispensed by the Vestals as a fertility charm at the
Festival of Pales (Palilia) on April twenty-first. <span
id="fr_68"></span>[41](#fn_68.md) Farmers and flocks at this festival
leaped through bonfires into which some of the mixture had been thrown.
It is not my plan to attempt, at this juncture, an explanation of these
rites; for our purpose it is sufficient to note that in this rite blood
had a peculiar magic property--probably the transmission of life, by
sympathetic magic, from the prolific cow through the blood of her calves
to the people who used the mixture.

Again at the Festival of the Lupercalia on February fifteenth blood from
the sacrificial goats was smeared with a knife on the foreheads of two
youths by some of the priests called Luperci, and then was wiped off
with wool by other priests. <span id="fr_69"></span>[42](#fn_69.md) Much
has been written in attempted explanation of this element in the rite.
We shall return to the subject in a later chapter; here again we must be
satisfied with pointing out merely the fact that blood was believed to
possess some strange property.

Once more, at the Festival of Terminus, the god of boundaries, in the
county districts at least, blood from the sacrificial victim, together
with its bones and ashes, incense, and various products of the farm, was
lowered into a hole in the ground and the boundary stone was rammed into
it. <span id="fr_70"></span>[43](#fn_70.md) The worship of such stones was
doubtless fetishism at first; but let us apply the rule for
distinguishing a fetish from a god, as given by Dr. Jevons: <span
id="fr_71"></span>[44](#fn_71.md) "If the object is the private property of
some individual, it is fetish; if it is worshipped by the community as a
whole, it, or rather the spirit which manifests itself therein, is a god
of the community." The stone, in historical times, certainly was by this
definition a god, or, to be more exact, a numen, worshiped by the farm
community for the good of the farm. But it is hard to believe that the
worship of such stones and of Terminus in the Capitol had developed far
beyond the fetish stage.

The blood of foreigners, especially of enemies, was felt to be
dangerous. The spear which the war-herald (fetial) threw into the
enemy's country as a declaration of war was dipped in blood. <span
id="fr_72"></span>[45](#fn_72.md) The blood, being taboo from the point of
view of the enemy, was calculated to do harm to him. The head of the
spear might be of iron, which, as we shall presently find, had magic
force. The soldiers who followed the general's triumphal car wore
garlands of laurel, that they might enter the city with the stain of
human blood removed. <span id="fr_73"></span>[46](#fn_73.md) A priest,
known as the verbenarims, accompanied the war-heralds, carrying with him
for purificatory purposes the sacred herbs, probably the modern vervain
which is commonly believed to possess magic properties. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[47](#fn_74.md)

On March nineteenth occurred the lustration of the sacred shields of the
Leaping Priests of Mars (Salii), and probably of the whole army before
it went forth to war. There was a procession in which these priests
performed ceremonial dances, beating their shields and brandishing their
spears--originally a magic ceremony to drive away malevolent spirits.
Again, after the war season was over, the shields and, doubtless, the
whole army were again lustrated and the shields were put away for the
winter. <span id="fr_75"></span>[48](#fn_75.md) It has been suggested that
the lustration in October was to disinfect both arms and men from the
double stain of blood and of contact with foreign influences. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[49](#fn_76.md) We meet with a similar ceremony at the
conclusion of the war against Fidenae in the reign of Tullus Hostilius,
when the king performed purificatory rites to rid the army of the taint
of blood and of contact with the enemy. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[50](#fn_77.md) All people at all times have believed
that the spirits of the slain haunt their slayers. <span
id="fr_78"></span>[51](#fn_78.md) The spirits of enemies killed in battle
would naturally haunt the soldiers who slew them; hence the need of such
purificatory rites for armies.

There is a curious story recorded in Tacitus  <span
id="fr_79"></span>[52](#fn_79.md) which seems to involve the taboo on
blood. It appears that Arminius, the chief of the Cheruscans, in order
to facilitate his escape from the Germans, "disfigured himself by
smearing blood over his face." This, on the principle that "like cures
like," would drive away blood and death from himself. Perhaps he smeared
his face with blood so that the malevolent spirits of the men whom he
had killed might be unable to recognize and haunt him. The practice of
smearing the face and body with paint of clay (particularly if it is
red) is common among savages. Prospective brides in the Congo region of
Africa parade before the men who desire mates. These girls are covered
with red clay, which is washed off in the river as soon as they are
chosen as wives. <span id="fr_80"></span>[53](#fn_80.md)

Sufficient evidence has been presented thus far to show that the Romans,
despite their putative indifference to blood because of the daily
association with it on the battlefield and at the altars, did actually
have a superstitious horror of blood. It was used in magic, and in
religious rites with magic force. Blood was considered the seat of the
soul of man; it was dangerous to have the blood of a living person over
one's head; bloodstains were considered dangerous; prodigies involving
blood were held to be especially ominous; blood was believed to have a
mystic power to wipe out blood-guilt and to seal covenants of crime. If
a soldier's actions were bad, his blood was believed to be bad, and
hence it might be drawn off to allow good blood to take its place. The
earliest sacrifices of the Romans were bloodless: even in some rites in
historical times blood sacrifice was forbidden. In certain other rites,
the blood of sacrifice was thought to possess magic properties. At least
one priest was not allowed to mention flesh, much less touch it. The
blood of foreigners was dangerous, and purificatory rites had to be
performed to remove contagion. We shall presently see that the presence
of blood at the birth of a child may also possibly account for the
danger which was characteristic of that period.

How did the taboo on blood arise? According to some scholars the fear of
blood is instinctive. A horse, for example, will shy at blood. Antiquity
furnishes at least one example of this. <span
id="fr_81"></span>[54](#fn_81.md) To our thinking, the taboo in many cases
arose in some such way as this: when the savage shed his blood, suffered
and died as the result of a wound, either accidental or from the blow of
an enemy, his fellows associated the blood with the idea of pain and
death--a familiar principle of similarity--and hence thereafter avoided
blood.

### Women

We know that women, under certain conditions, are considered dangerous
by savage peoples. This may be due to the fact that they are physically
weak or to the fact that they differ physiologically from men and, on
that account, are potentially dangerous; or the taboo may be due to the
superstitious horror of blood--particularly the blood of menstruation
and of childbirth--common to all peoples.

The Laws of Moses say that a woman who had given birth to a boy was
unclean for seven days; <span id="fr_82"></span>[55](#fn_82.md) if she gave
birth to a girl, she was unclean for two weeks; <span
id="fr_83"></span>[56](#fn_83.md) and she was not allowed to touch anything
sacred or to enter the sanctuary until after that period. <span
id="fr_84"></span>[57](#fn_84.md) Furthermore, if she had an issue of
blood, she had to be put apart for seven days, and anyone who touched
her was unclean until night. <span id="fr_85"></span>[58](#fn_85.md)

According to Pliny the Elder <span id="fr_86"></span>[59](#fn_86.md) a
woman in her menstrual period will sour must, make grain barren, kill
grafts, wither vegetables, dull mirrors, and do a host of other harmful
things.

"During certain periods," writes Lafcadio Hearn <span
id="fr_87"></span>[60](#fn_87.md) of Shinto worship in Japan, "women must
not even pray before the miya, much less make offerings or touch the
sacred vessels, or kindle the lights of the Kami."

A rather amusing incident involving the feeling of danger in the
presence of women occurred recently. Sailors on board the American liner
George Washington laid the buffeting which wintry storms inflicted upon
their ship to the presence of a woman stowaway in the coal bunker. A
woman, they said, had no place where men only were allowed. Her presence
had caused all their woes during the voyage. <span
id="fr_88"></span>[61](#fn_88.md)

The taboo on women was prevalent in Rome. At the country rites of Mars
Silvanus no woman was allowed to be present or to see how the rites were
performed. <span id="fr_89"></span>[62](#fn_89.md) Women were not allowed
to swear by Hercules, and were forbidden to take part in his worship at
the Greatest Altar in the Cattle Market. The story goes that Hercules,
while driving through Italy the cattle which he had stolen in Spain from
the three-headed monster Geryon, came upon women celebrating the rites
of the Good Goddess and, being thirsty after the defeat of the
fire-monster Cacus, he asked for a drink from their sacred spring. Now
men were rigidly excluded from these rites, and so the women refused his
request, for it would have been sacrilege for a man's lips to touch the
spring. Hercules, in anger, burst open the door of the temple and
drained the spring dry. In consequence of this refusal, he ordered that
all women be excluded from his rites at the Greatest Altar which he
erected in celebration of his victory over Cacus. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[63](#fn_90.md) The tale, of course, was invented to
explain the exclusion of women. Fowler has suggested <span
id="fr_91"></span>[64](#fn_91.md) an explanation of the taboo, on the
ground that the cult of Hercules had been superimposed on an older cult
of Genius or the male principle. From this cult, quite naturally, women
would be excluded. However, the presence of the Leaping Priests of Mars
in the rites seems to suggest Mars, rather than Genius, behind the later
Hercules. We know, too, that women were excluded from the worship of
Hercules at Lanuvium. <span id="fr_92"></span>[65](#fn_92.md) Frazer
retells  <span id="fr_93"></span>[66](#fn_93.md) from Aelian a story which
so humorously indicates the antipathy of Hercules for women that we
shall introduce it at this point.

"Cocks were kept in the temple of Hercules \[he writes\] and hens in the
temple of Hebe, and they had the run of a yard, in which, however, the
plots assigned to the two sexes were strictly divided by a stream of
pure running water. No hen ever presumed to trespass on the ground
sacred to cocks and to Hercules; but whenever the cocks desired to mate
they crossed the stream and coupled with the hens, and when they
returned the running stream purified them from the pollution they had
incurred by contact with the other sex."

Festus mentions the fact that in certain rites, undefined by him, women
and girls were bidden to depart. <span id="fr_94"></span>[67](#fn_94.md)
There has survived a law, traditionally attributed to Numa, to the
effect that no kept mistress might touch the temple of Juno, and that if
she did so, she must, with flowing hair, offer up an ewe lamb to the
goddess. <span id="fr_95"></span>[68](#fn_95.md)

That the Romans early overcame their uneasiness about the presence of
women in religious rites is shown by the fact that the overseer's wife
on a farm had certain minor religious duties to perform. <span
id="fr_96"></span>[69](#fn_96.md) Again, the farmer's wife at the Festival
of the Boundary Stone brought fire from the home hearth for use on the
altar erected at the boundary of the farm. <span
id="fr_97"></span>[70](#fn_97.md) On the day of the Liberalia, old women
crowned with ivy, called priestesses of Liber (sacerdotes Liberia), made
sacrificial cakes on portable hearths, which, with honey, were bought
and offered to Liber in the interest of the buyers. <span
id="fr_98"></span>[71](#fn_98.md)

### Children

One of the most arresting studies in the religious and superstitious
life of any people is the part played in it by the child. The fairest
festival of the Christian Church centers about the birth of a Child; the
most finished art of the Church has as its subject the Mother and Child;
much of the charm of the Christian ritual is due to the presence of
altar and choir boys. So, too, in ancient Rome, children played an
important part in many rites, both in the State religion and in rites
which were performed in secret, outside the pale of religion.

It will be our purpose to study, somewhat in detail, the part played by
children in the superstitious and in the religious life of the Romans.
We shall have something to say about their place (1) in witchcraft, and
more especially in murder rites of witches; (2) in prehistoric rites of
child sacrifice; (3) in divination, both inside and outside the
recognized religion; (4) in connection with taboos and superstitions;
(5) in religious rites, (a) at birth, (b) at puberty, and (c) at death;
then (6) we shall indicate some of their functions as acolytes in the
home and in the fully developed State religion; and, finally, (7) we
shall seek to explain, somewhat more fully than has hitherto been done,
the reasons for the place of the child in witchcraft and in religion.

#### 1. THE CHILD IN WITCHCMFT

It is a well-known fact that Roman parents would consult astrologers in
order to learn the future of their children. Then, too, as we shall see,
women regularly worshiped divinities whose special province was
assistance at childbirth and prophecy concerning children. Credulous
mothers, would often consult witches about these matters.

It was probably the mother of Horace who first introduced him to
witchcraft by taking him to a local witch in order to secure
foreknowledge of her son's career. At least this is suggested in a
childhood reminiscence of his association with witches, in the
well-known passage which constitutes a part of Horace's famous
description of his encounter with the bore in the Sacred Road. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[72](#fn_99.md) Though the story is doubtless
fanciful-told to heighten the effect of the satire--it is probably based
on fact and shows that fortune-telling by witches was prevalent in the
country districts. Horace, we recall, when vainly trying to rid himself
of the bore, asks the latter if he has any relatives who are interested
in his welfare; if the bore answers "Yes," Horace will tell him that he
is on his way to visit a sick friend who has a contagious disease. The
bore, however, answers: "I have no one. I have laid them all to rest."
"Happy they!" replies Horace. "Now I remain. Finish me. For the sad fate
is pressing close upon me which a Sabellian hag, having shaken her holy
urn, once prophesied to me when I was a boy. 'Him neither dire poison
nor hostile blade will carry off, nor pleurisy, nor cough, nor crippling
gout. A garrulous fellow will sometime do him to death. If he be wise,
let him avoid the talkative when once he has grown to manhood.'"

The Romans commonly believed that witches murdered children to secure
parts of their bodies for use in their gruesome rites. Horace  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[73](#fn_100.md) gives us a picture of certain witches
murdering a boy to use his entrails in plying their art. The poem opens
with the cries of the boy, who is being spirited away from his home by
four witches. One of them, Canidia, orders wild fig trees to be uprooted
from the tombs, the eggs and down of a screech owl to be smeared with
toad's blood, and poisonous grasses and bones snatched from the maw of a
hungry bitch to be consumed in magic flames. Sagana sprinkles the house
with waters from Lake Avernus, and Veia, with her hoe, digs up the earth
to bury the boy with only his head protruding, that he may die there of
starvation in the sight of food changed again and again during the day.
Canidia, as she gnaws her long nails, prays to Night and to Diana that
the charms which she has already used may work on her aged lover, Varus.
But some other witch has worked a stronger counter-charm: so Canidia,
too, will prepare another. The poem closes with a curse from the boy who
cries that he will, as an avenging spirit, hound the witches.

Witches would steal babies for use in their rites and would leave
bundles of straw in their place. We have an illustration of this
practice in Petronius. <span id="fr_101"></span>[74](#fn_101.md) Trimalchio
relates that when he was a boy, the favorite of his master, a mere
child, died; and while the boy's mother was bemoaning his death, witches
were heard screeching outside. A husky Cappadocian, one of Trimalchio's
household, rushed out to slay them, returning, however, black and blue
from the encounter. He later died--a raving maniac. The mother, on
returning to her child, found merely a bundle of straw. The witches had
carried off the dead child for use in their nefarious business.

Witches, probably midwives in some cases, occasionally removed unborn
children by unnatural means from their mothers' wombs and placed them on
magic altars. <span id="fr_102"></span>[75](#fn_102.md) The entrails,
urine, caul, teeth, liver, marrow and other parts of boys were used in
these rites. The caul of a child, for instance, was often seized by
midwives and sold to superstitious lawyers, for it was believed to have
the power to bring them luck while pleading. <span
id="fr_103"></span>[76](#fn_103.md) It is not difficult to credit this when
we recall that Regulus, a lawyer contemporary with Pliny the Younger,
would daub paint around his right eye if he was to plead for a plaintiff
and around the left eye if for a defendant, and would transfer a white
adhesive plaster from one eyebrow to the other, depending on the nature
of the case which he was pleading. <span
id="fr_104"></span>[77](#fn_104.md)

Not only were professional witches and wizards accused of murdering
children for magic purposes, but sometimes men in public life were also
charged with these practices. Cicero, for example, in a speech attacking
Vatinius, a political adventurer and henchman of Julius Caesar, charged
him, among other things, with using the vitals of a boy in questionable
rites. <span id="fr_105"></span>[78](#fn_105.md) Justin Martyr in a much
later day accused the Romans of practicing divination from murdered
children. <span id="fr_106"></span>[79](#fn_106.md) Such heinous crimes
were in later times committed even in the emperor's palace. One of the
horrible deeds of Heliogabalus, recorded by AElius Lampridius, was that
he sacrificed beautiful children of noble birth whose parents were still
living. For this purpose he kept magicians in his household; and he
himself would torture his victims and examine their vitals. <span
id="fr_107"></span>[80](#fn_107.md)

#### 2. CHILD SACRIFICE

It may be possible that the murder of children in witchcraft was a
survival from a period when children were actually sacrificed in
accordance with the rites of accepted religion. With the growing
revulsion of feeling against taking human life, substitutes were offered
in place of the child victims in recognized religious rites, while
murder itself was relegated to the darkness of forbidden witchcraft. Be
that as it may, there is a gruesome suggestion of human sacrifice in the
tradition that boys were sacrificed to Mania, the mother of the Lares,
at the Festival of the Cross-Roads (Compitalia)--an offering calculated
to guarantee the welfare of families. At the expulsion of the Tarquins,
the custom was abolished by Brutus, who ordered that heads of garlic and
poppies be sacrificed in place of boys. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[81](#fn_108.md)

#### 3. CHILDREN IN DIVINATION

The ancients commonly used boys in rites of divination both privately in
magic and in forms sanctioned by the State. Thus, one of the charges
brought against Apuleius of Madaura in Africa, in the famous trial under
the proconsul Claudius Maximus of Sabrata, was that he used a boy in
certain magic rites. <span id="fr_109"></span>[82](#fn_109.md) According to
the charge, he spirited a boy away to a secret spot and there, in the
presence of a few witnesses, at an altar under the flickering light of a
lantern, performed magic rites, after which the boy collapsed, falling
to the ground--as his enemies declared, bewitched, but, according to
Apuleius, in a fit of epilepsy. On regaining consciousness, he was found
to be out of his mind. That boys were thus used in magic rites for
divination and prophecy Apuleius asserts on the authority of Varro who,
he says, tells how at Tralles a boy was used to determine the probable
outcome of the Mithridatic War. The boy gazed into a vessel of water at
an image of Mercury there reflected and proclaimed his prophecy in
verse. Apuleius relates also that Fabius, after losing a large sum of
money, had consulted Nigidius who, by means of incantations, so
bewitched certain boys that they were able to reveal the spot where a
part of the money was concealed. The remainder had been dissipated, and
one coin had come into the hands of Marcus Cato the Philosopher, who, on
being questioned, acknowledged possession of it. Apuleius apparently
credits such prophecies and believes that the human soul, especially
when it is young and innocent, can, by means of music and sweet
perfumes, be lulled to sleep--hypnotized--and in that state can predict
what will happen in the future. Boys who perform such functions must be
beautiful, without physical blemish, quick-witted and ready of speech.
We may compare, in this respect, the requirements for the girls who
presented themselves as priestesses of Vesta. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[83](#fn_110.md) They must, among other things, be free
from impediments in speech, must possess good hearing and must, like
animals offered in sacrifices to the gods, have no bodily defect.

An interesting instance of unconscious divination by a child is recorded
in Cicero's treatise On Divination. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[84](#fn_111.md) When Lucius AEmilius Paulus, having
been chosen to wage war against Perseus, King of Macedonia, returned
home, he noticed that his daughter was sad. On inquiry, he found that
her pet puppy Persa had died. The father--he had been an augur--took
this as a prophecy that King Perseus was doomed to death. It is not
difficult to believe that this incident actually happened; but it takes
a stretch of the imagination to credit the story recorded by Livy  <span
id="fr_112"></span>[85](#fn_112.md) that in the fifth year of the Second
Punic War a baby called out from its mother's womb, "Io Triumphe!"

The Emperor Didius Julianus, assisted by magicians, performed certain
rites in which boys, with bandages over their eyes, gazed, as it seemed,
into a mirror while charms were muttered over their heads. While in this
state one of the boys declared that he saw in the mirror the coming of
Severus as emperor and the departure of Julianus. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[86](#fn_113.md)

#### 4. SUPERSTITIONS CONCERNING CHILDREN.

##### TABOO

Many superstitions concerning children at birth have been preserved for
us in Roman writers. Thus both the new-born child and its mother are
considered uncannily dangerous. This may be due to their physical
weakness and to the presence of blood at birth. <span
id="fr_114"></span>[87](#fn_114.md) It is for fear that the weakness of the
child may bring a corresponding weakness to the father that an English
gypsy father to-day will not touch his child until it is several months
old. <span id="fr_115"></span>[88](#fn_115.md) It was for the same reason,
perhaps, that a Gallic father, in Caesar's day, would not allow his son
to come into his presence until he had grown up and could endure
military service. <span id="fr_116"></span>[89](#fn_116.md) The feeling
that mother and child were surrounded by evil forces survived among the
Romans of historical times. It was natural, then, that they should seek
means not only to shield the child from evil influences but to protect
those who came in contact with it as well.

The danger surrounding the mother and her child is well illustrated in
the superstition that they were liable to be tormented by evil spirits
from the woodland--Silvanus, as the later Romans believed--until a
curious ceremony was performed. I quote St. Augustine: <span
id="fr_117"></span>[90](#fn_117.md)

". . . After the birth of the child, three protecting divinities are
summoned lest the god Silvanus enter during the night and harass mother
and child; and to give tokens of those guardian divinities three men by
night surround the threshold of the house and first strike it with an ax
and a pestle; then they sweep it off with a broom, that, by giving these
signs of worship, the god Silvanus may be kept from entering. For trees
are not cut nor pruned without iron; nor is spelt powdered without a
pestle; nor is grain piled up without a broom. Now from these three
objects are named three divinities: Intercidona from the intercisio of
the ax; Pilumnus from the pilum; Deverra from the sweeping (verrere) of
the broom; and by the protection of these divinities new-born babies are
preserved against the violence of Silvanus."

The objects used in this rite are charms against evil influences: the
iron of the ax and the iron tip of the pestle are familiar objects for
averting evils. The ceremonial sweeping drives away evils from the
child.

The Roman child up to the age of puberty needed the protection of a
special purple-bordered dress which has been shown to have possessed
religious significance. <span id="fr_118"></span>[91](#fn_118.md) Again,
boys and girls wore about their necks amulets of gold or of skin,
usually containing a representation of the phallus, but occasionally a
green lizard or a heart and perhaps also other objects. These were
believed to ward off baleful influences, especially the evil eye. When
the child doffed his boyish dress, he hung up his amulet on the
Lares. <span id="fr_119"></span>[92](#fn_119.md)

Children were liable to be harassed by bloodsucking vampires in the form
of owls. The rites of riddance, described by Ovid  <span
id="fr_120"></span>[93](#fn_120.md) in the case of the infant Procas, are
as follows:

"Immediately she (Crane) touches the doorposts three times in succession
with a spray of arbutus; three times she marks the threshold with
arbutus spray. She sprinkles the entrance with water (and the water
contained a drug). She holds the bloody entrails of a pig, two months
old, and thus speaks: 'Birds of the night, spare the entrails of the
boy. For a small boy a small victim falls. Take heart for heart, I pray,
entrails for entrails. This life we give you in place of a better one.'"

Having killed the sow, the witch placed the vital organs in the open air
and forbade those attending the rite to look upon them. Then a whitethom
branch was set in a small window which furnished light for the house.
After that the child was safe and the color returned to his pallid face.

The principle of similarity in this magic act is evident: the vital
organs of the child which, in early Roman times, were under the care of
the goddess Carna, are to be saved by the vicarious offering of the
vitals of a sow. The pig was frequently so used. A similar substitution
is to be seen in the ceremony of treaty-making, preserved by Livy. <span
id="fr_121"></span>[94](#fn_121.md)

The child, too, was liable to be harmed by the evil eye. Persius
satirizes the old woman--an adept at averting the evil eye--who takes a
baby from its cradle and applies spittle to its forehead and lips with
the middle finger. <span id="fr_122"></span>[95](#fn_122.md) The goddess of
the cradle (Cunina) was believed, in popular superstition at least, to
have the power of averting the evil eye. <span
id="fr_123"></span>[96](#fn_123.md)

Several superstitions with regard to the luckiness or unluckiness of
children at birth are recorded by Pliny the Elder. Thus, inasmuch as it
was contrary to nature for a baby to come into the world foot-foremost,
such a birth was considered unlucky. <span
id="fr_124"></span>[97](#fn_124.md) The child who at birth had caused the
death of its mother was believed to have been born under happy
auspices. <span id="fr_125"></span>[98](#fn_125.md) For a girl to be born
with teeth was considered ominous. <span
id="fr_126"></span>[99](#fn_126.md) It would seem that the birth of
triplets caused parents no uneasiness, but that when four children were
born it was considered ill-omened. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[100](#fn_127.md) So when, in the principate of
Augustus, a certain woman of low origin gave birth to two boys and two
girls, it was believed to presage a famine which took place shortly
afterward. <span id="fr_128"></span>[101](#fn_128.md)

Savages believe that blood and anything that looks like blood has the
power to drive away evils. A survival of this superstition may account
for the custom which obtained in the family of the Emperor Albinus (196
A.D.), requiring that new-born children be wrapped in bandages of a
reddish color. <span id="fr_129"></span>[102](#fn_129.md)

The Romans, in common with many other peoples, ancient and modern, often
identified the lifetime of a particular tree with the duration of the
life of the person at whose birth it was planted. So on the country
estate of the Flavians stood an ancient oak which sent forth a branch on
each of three occasions when Vespasia gave birth to a child. <span
id="fr_130"></span>[103](#fn_130.md)

#### 5. THE CHILD IN RELIGIOUS RITES

##### a. At Birth

Tertullian  <span id="fr_131"></span>[104](#fn_131.md) acquaints us with a
whole series of divinities which looked after the interests of the child
before and after birth. Among these Fluviona cared for the child in its
mother's womb; Candelifera was the spirit of the light--equivalent
magically to the life of the child--which was placed in the room where
the baby was born; Cunina, in addition to having the power of averting
the evil eye, supplied quiet; Levana presided over the ceremonial
lifting of the child from the ground by the father. It has been
suggested  <span id="fr_132"></span>[105](#fn_132.md) that the new-born
baby was placed on the ground that it might receive a soul from Mother
Earth; for among savages even to-day the belief prevails that babies at
birth are not possessed of souls.

Ovid  <span id="fr_133"></span>[106](#fn_133.md) distinguishes two
goddesses of birth, Postverta and Porrima, the former for children born
foot-first, the abnormal posture, and the latter for the child born
normally. Other names for Porrima were Prorsa and Antevorta. In all
likelihood they were names of two carmentes. We know that the names
Porrima and Postverta were mumbled by the priests. This explains the
uncertainty of the names of the divinities and leads one to suspect that
they originated in magic. And indeed the worship of the Roman Carmenta
(Carmentis) may have originated in magic; for, in old Latin,
prophetesses were called carmentes and the scribes who copied out their
prophecies were called carmentarii. These carmentes, as W. Warde Fowler
has pointed out, <span id="fr_134"></span>[107](#fn_134.md) may well have
been wise women whom prospective mothers consulted. But it is more
likely that Carmenta was an old Italian divinity. In her rites, leather,
except perhaps for the skins of the sacrificial animals, was taboo. The
reason for this, as Ovid rightly indicates, <span
id="fr_135"></span>[108](#fn_135.md) was to prevent the contagion of the
dead animal from communicating death to the mother or to her child.

The goddesses most commonly invoked by mothers at the time of
parturition were Juno Lucina, Diana, and Mater Matuta. These divinities
seem to have displaced the carmentes in historical times. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[109](#fn_136.md)

Springs were commonly worshiped by expectant mothers. Such a spring was
that of Egeria in the sacred grove not far from the Capene Gate on the
Appian Road. <span id="fr_137"></span>[110](#fn_137.md) Certain springs at
Sinuessa were believed to possess, among other powers, that of
preventing childlessness. <span id="fr_138"></span>[111](#fn_138.md)

The Romans, as we have seen, sought, by means of magic rites, to shield
their children from evil influences. It was for this reason, doubtless,
that the child was purified and given a name in accordance with
religious forms--the boy on the ninth and the girl on the eighth day
after birth. A goddess Nundina, it would seem, presided over the rites
of purification. <span id="fr_139"></span>[112](#fn_139.md)

##### b. At Puberty

Another dangerous period in the life of the child was that of Puberty.
At that period--usually on the day of the Festival of Liber
(Liberalia)--the boy ceremonially put on the white dress of manhood
(toga virilis) and laid aside, in the presence of the Lares, his amulet
(bulla) and his magic boyhood dress. <span
id="fr_140"></span>[113](#fn_140.md) This ceremony may have descended from
a prehistoric rite of initiation of the lad into the clan. <span
id="fr_141"></span>[114](#fn_141.md) According to the unknown author of a
work De Praenominibus, the boy received a name on this day. If this be
true, the child probably discarded the name which had been given to him
on the dies lustricus. <span id="fr_142"></span>[115](#fn_142.md) I suggest
that if the name given to him in infancy had proved magically lucky, he
retained it; but if he had suffered disease, accident, or other
misfortune, the name was changed at his "coming of age" ceremony.

##### c. At Death

The Romans both buried and burned their dead; but archaeologists have
shown that the largest numbers of Roman burials were those of
children--a fact which suggests that some superstition prohibited their
cremation. <span id="fr_143"></span>[116](#fn_143.md) This archaeological
evidence corroborates a statement in Pliny the Elder that it was not the
custom to cremate children whose teeth had not yet appeared. <span
id="fr_144"></span>[117](#fn_144.md)

#### 6. THE CHILD AS ACOLYTE

Children, among all peoples, have definite roles assigned to them in
religion, often in connection with rites of purification and of
divination. For instance, according to an early Christian writer,
Barnabas, <span id="fr_145"></span>[118](#fn_145.md) it would appear that
in the popular religion of the Jews the most wicked men of their number
would slay and burn a heifer. Boys would take the ashes and place them
in vessels, and, with a stick bound with purple wool and hyssop, would
sprinkle the people severally to cleanse them of their sins. As there is
no mention of this rite in the Old Testament, it is reasonable to
suppose that it belonged to the popular religion.

The employment of children as acolytes in Roman religion originated in
the primitive home where children alone, because of their purity, were
allowed to handle the food in the storeroom. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[119](#fn_146.md) After the first course of the meal had
been removed, silence was enjoined, and an offering made on the hearth.
Then the son of the family, according to the custom, announced whether
the omens were favorable. <span id="fr_147"></span>[120](#fn_147.md) In
certain rites in the fields, too, both boys and girls acted as
assistants. At the Festival of Terminus in February each member of the
family took part: the boy carried the basket containing products of the
farm, which he threw into the fire on the altar; his sister offered
honey cakes. <span id="fr_148"></span>[121](#fn_148.md)

Hence the Romans, because of childhood associations, often grew up with
great affection for the gods of the home. Tibullus, for instance,
describes  <span id="fr_149"></span>[122](#fn_149.md) how he used to run as
a child about the feet of the Lares, protected by their kindly
influence.

Boys and girls called camilli and camillae, wearing the toga praetexta,
often took part in Roman State rites. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[123](#fn_150.md) They had to be free-born and both of
their parents must be living. Hence the names patrimi and matrimi were
also given to them. Three such boys took part in the procession which
escorted the bride to her new home. One carried the whitethorn torch in
front of the procession and the other two held the hands of the
bride. <span id="fr_151"></span>[124](#fn_151.md) Even in our day in far
separated parts of the world boys and girls take part in magic and
religious rites, and both their parents must be living. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[125](#fn_152.md)

At the request of the Emperor Augustus, Horace composed the "Secular
Hymn"  <span id="fr_153"></span>[126](#fn_153.md) which was sung on the
third day of the religious festival of 17 A.D., first at the temple of
Apollo, then at the Capitol, by a chorus of twenty-seven boys and a like
number of girls, whose parents were living. It seems that the Sibylline
oracles had commanded that the boys and girls sing a hymn to the Roman
divinities; and we suspect that the oracles were inspired by Augustus.

To summarize: We have seen that credulous Roman mothers would consult
witches to secure assistance in childbirth and to learn the future of
their children. The Romans commonly believed that witches murdered
children--especially boys--to obtain parts of their bodies for use in
their art; and that they would steal children for this purpose, leaving
bundles of straw in their place. Occasionally, witches removed unborn
children by unnatural means from their mothers' wombs. The vitals,
urine, caul, teeth, liver and other parts of boys were used in their
rites. The cauls of children were sold by mothers to superstitious
lawyers, because they were believed to bring them luck in pleading.
Persons in public life were occasionally charged with murdering children
for questionable ends.

The murder of children in witchcraft may be a survival of actual child
sacrifice in regular religious rites. In religion, substitutes were
sacrificed in place of the children in historical times, and actual
child murder was driven to cover in witchcraft.

Children were employed in divination both in the State religion and in
private rites. Sometimes boys prophesied by gazing into water or into
mirrors; sometimes under the influence of hypnosis. Such boys had to be
physically perfect, intelligent, and ready of speech. Occasionally,
accidental events involving children were believed to have the force of
divination.

The new-born baby and its mother were considered magically dangerous,
and rites had to be performed to protect them and anyone who came in
contact with them. They were, for example, liable to be harassed by evil
spirits from the woodland, and a set ceremony was prescribed to remove
these evils. Children, too, might be tormented by vampires, and rites of
riddance were performed to dispel these. Up to the age of puberty, the
child was protected by a magic dress, and by an amulet which contained
objects calculated to ward off the evil eye. These were discarded when
he came of age.

The position and condition of the child at birth had much to do with his
subsequent luckiness or unluckiness.

The Romans, like so many other peoples, believed that the life of a
person was dependent on the duration of the life of a tree which had
been planted at his birth.

Numerous divinities presided over the child from the time of conception
to puberty. There was a divinity to care for his every action.
Carmentes--originally prophesying witches--were also consulted by
mothers. Women worshiped springs which, as they believed, assisted in
parturition and prevented childlessness.

The name of the child had magic import; if it was found to be an unlucky
one, it might be changed at puberty when children, at the Festival of
Liber, doffed their magic dress and their amulets.

It seems that children who died in infancy, especially if they were
still toothless, were buried, not cremated as was the case with adults.

In regular religious rites children were employed as acolytes. This
originated in the primitive home where none but children were allowed to
touch the sacred stores. The son announced omens in the home, and both
boys and girls took part in State rites. Such children must be of
free-born parents who were both living. Boys took part in wedding
processions.

It is interesting to seek an explanation for the fact that children at
certain times were considered magically dangerous, and for their use in
religious rites. The presence of blood at birth was sufficient to make
the child dangerous at that time. Again, the helplessness of the child
made it possible for stronger forces of evil--vampires, the evil eye,
and the like--to get control of him. On the other hand, the weakness of
the child might have a dangerous influence on others, particularly on
the father. Children were used in rites of divination because there was
no possibility of their being influenced by experience. In rites where
hypnosis was employed, their greater susceptibility to suggestion made
them valuable agents. In religious rites, as we have seen, only the
children of parents who were free-born and still living were employed.
If the parents were not living, the loss in magic strength which the
child suffered would be communicated to the religious rite, to say
nothing of the evil effect of contact with death. That the child must be
physically perfect is to be explained in the same way as the requirement
that animals in sacrifice be unblemished: the defects of the child would
be communicated magically to the rites. Again, sexual intercourse tends
to weaken the effect of religious rites. Hence the effectiveness of
children, who were still innocent and naive, for the performance of
these rites.

### Death and Corpses

In all ages, corpses have been looked upon as uncanny and as needing
purificatory rites. "Primitive thought," writes Crawley, <span
id="fr_154"></span>[127](#fn_154.md) "has no definition of the nature of
death, but the usual attitude toward it, as may be inferred from
mourning customs, is a mystic terror." Thus, among the uneducated
Japanese of modern times, a corpse is felt to be dangerous, and
precautions must be taken against infection. "One must not sleep, for
example," says Lafcadio Hearn, <span id="fr_155"></span>[128](#fn_155.md)
"or even lie down to rest, with his feet turned toward it. One must not
pray before it, or even stand before it, while in a state of religious
impurity,--such as that entailed by having touched a corpse, or attended
a Buddhist funeral, or even during the period of mourning for kindred
buried according to the Buddhist rite." The same feeling of danger
arising from contact with death or corpses was common among the ancient
Hebrews. For instance, any person who had been defiled by contact with
the dead was debarred from the camp. <span
id="fr_156"></span>[129](#fn_156.md) The person who had touched a dead
body, the bones of a man, or a grave was unclean for seven days. <span
id="fr_157"></span>[130](#fn_157.md)

We turn again to Rome. We have seen that witches, to effect their secret
ends, would cut off parts of a dead body. <span
id="fr_158"></span>[131](#fn_158.md) Cemeteries, then, would be their
favorite haunt. Horace describes <span id="fr_159"></span>[132](#fn_159.md)
the magic rites of four witches, by which one of them hopes to win back
the affection of an aged lover. A boy is captured. He is buried up to
the neck in the ground, in the heart of the witch's house, and there
left to die of starvation. The object of this murder is to secure the
marrow and liver, which are to be cut out and dried for use in a love
potion. Unfortunately, there is reason to suspect that witches actually
committed such gruesome crimes in Rome. But is it so strange that
witch-murders occurred in ancient times, when to-day, in our own
country, one may read about similar murders for magic purposes? <span
id="fr_160"></span>[133](#fn_160.md)

It was believed that one's strength could be impaired by treading on a
corpse. <span id="fr_161"></span>[134](#fn_161.md) A boy who had been
performing acrobatic stunts on a ladder for the amusement of the guests
at Trimalchio's dinner slipped and fell. Uproar ensued--not, as
Petronius assures us, <span id="fr_162"></span>[135](#fn_162.md) because
the boy had fallen, but because his death, especially since he was a
slave, would have been ill-omened. Scipio Africanus the Elder was found
one morning dead in bed. No inquest was made, <span
id="fr_163"></span>[136](#fn_163.md) and we may readily believe that this
omission was due to superstitious horror of the corpse. The Romans once
refused to hazard battle because they discovered that the mound from
which their general had addressed them was a burial place. <span
id="fr_164"></span>[137](#fn_164.md) In 509 B.C., the dedication of the
temple of Jupiter on the Capitol fell by lot to one of the consuls,
Horatius. The friends of the other consul jealously tried to hinder the
dedication. They concocted a scheme which, they thought, would play on
Horatius' fear of contagion from death. When Horatius was already
holding the door-post, praying to the gods, his enemies interrupted the
rites, announcing "that his son was dead, and that he could not dedicate
a temple when his household was thus tainted with death. <span
id="fr_165"></span>[138](#fn_165.md) The consul, however, proceeded with
the ceremony.

In 459 B.C. the regular five-year expiatory sacrifice at Rome was not
held, because the Capitol had been stained with the blood of exiles and
slaves and because a consul had been slain. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[139](#fn_166.md) Germanicus, having arrived at the spot
beyond the Rhine where the Roman general Varus and his legions had been
annihilated by the Germans, helped with his own hands in the burial of
his country's soldiers of an earlier day. The Emperor Tiberius, however,
misinterpreted his actions, thinking "that a general, invested with the
office of augur and other ancient religious functions, ought not to have
assisted at the performance of funeral rites." <span
id="fr_167"></span>[140](#fn_167.md)

A day was regularly set by the Roman consul for the enrollment of raw
recruits in the army. The soldier was bound by oath to appear, unless
prevented by specified reasons: among them the necessity of his presence
at a funeral in his family, or at a rite of purification from contact
with the dead. <span id="fr_168"></span>[141](#fn_168.md) Those who
attended a Roman funeral procession, "on returning, were sprinkled with
water and walked over fire. . . ." <span
id="fr_169"></span>[142](#fn_169.md) After a dead body had been taken out
of a Roman house, a ceremonial sweeping of the house took place,
performed probably by the heir, but possibly, as Ovid intimates, <span
id="fr_170"></span>[143](#fn_170.md) by an officer, an assistant of the
Priest of Jupiter.

Frazer furnishes a parallel to this custom. He writes: <span
id="fr_171"></span>[144](#fn_171.md) " . . . in Thuringia three heaps of
salt are placed on the floor of a house in which a person has died; the
room is then swept out, and the sweepings and the broom are carried to
the churchyard or to the field; sometimes the mattress is burned in the
field. The reason assigned for all these customs is to prevent the ghost
from returning." The ceremonial sweeping in such rites is to brush the
ghost of the dead man out of the house. Salt was regularly used in
purifying rites among all peoples; and salt and spelt are also regular
offerings to the souls of the dead. <span
id="fr_172"></span>[145](#fn_172.md)

The boy who carried the whitethorn torch in the wedding procession to
the house of the bridegroom had to be the child of parents who were
still living. <span id="fr_173"></span>[146](#fn_173.md) This requirement
also applied to boys who sang in the chorus at the Secular Games. <span
id="fr_174"></span>[147](#fn_174.md) The taboo on death doubtless caused
this restriction; for if the parents were dead, the boys might have
adversely affected the rites. The Priest of Jupiter was not allowed to
set foot on a grave or touch a dead body. <span
id="fr_175"></span>[148](#fn_175.md) It was the custom of the Romans to
place a cypress before the house where a person had died, that the Chief
Priest (Pontifex Maximus) might avoid contamination by shunning
it. <span id="fr_176"></span>[149](#fn_176.md)

Not only were corpses considered dangerous, but so also were days on
which the Romans celebrated the Festival of the Dead, when temples were
closed, the altars were cold, and it was unpropitious for girls to
marry. <span id="fr_177"></span>[150](#fn_177.md) The Laws of the Twelve
Tables forbade the cremation or burial of a dead body within the city
walls. <span id="fr_178"></span>[151](#fn_178.md) A law passed in 260 B.C.
forbade burials in the city of Rome. Victorious generals and Vestals,
however, were exempt from this prohibition. <span
id="fr_179"></span>[152](#fn_179.md)

The nearest equivalent, perhaps, to the word taboo in Latin is religio;
and it seems that the Romans at times used this word in the sense of
taboo on death. <span id="fr_180"></span>[153](#fn_180.md) Varro, for
instance, uses the term religiosa, with this connotation, of certain
personal belongings of King Numa which, according to tradition, were
believed to have been placed after his death in jars at a spot near the
Cloaca Maxima in Rome. <span id="fr_181"></span>[154](#fn_181.md)

The origin of the feeling with regard to the dead seems to lie in man's
instinct for self-preservation. We may give as an additional reason one
of the principles of negative mana--that, among all peoples, things
which are strange are to be avoided. Man must certainly at a very early
time have noticed the agonies which his fellows suffered when mangled by
wild beasts or pierced by the spear of the enemy. These agonies were
accompanied by the shedding of blood, which was in itself felt to be
dangerous. Furthermore, there was an observable cessation of all the
man's normal actions. Hence early man associated pain, blood, and the
cessation of action with the strange dead body and avoided it.

Curiously enough, the Romans, who deified almost everything, had no god
of Death.

### Leather

Leather, unless it were the skin of a sacrificial animal, was often
considered dangerous by ancient peoples. Thus leather was prohibited in
the worship of Carmentis, a goddess popular with prospective mothers;
and the reason for this prohibition was, according to Ovid, <span
id="fr_182"></span>[155](#fn_182.md) the fear that it might pollute the
pure altars of the goddess. A woman would naturally fear that any part
of a dead animal might cause death to the child or to herself. The taboo
on leather seems to have applied also in other rites. <span
id="fr_183"></span>[156](#fn_183.md) The wife of the Priest of Jupiter
(Flaminica Dialis) might wear shoes or sandals made only of the skin of
the sacrificial animal, or of an animal that had not met death
naturally; for animals that had died natural deaths were considered
unlucky. <span id="fr_184"></span>[157](#fn_184.md) The Jews were forbidden
to eat a beast which had died a natural death:  <span
id="fr_185"></span>[158](#fn_185.md) "And if any beast, of which ye eat,
die; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the
even."

At the Lupercalia the youthful priests wore skins of the sacrificial
animals about their loins and used lashes made of them. They were
otherwise naked. <span id="fr_186"></span>[159](#fn_186.md) We have seen
that in the ceremony of rain-making women walked barefoot. <span
id="fr_187"></span>[160](#fn_187.md) According to the testimony of Ovid
women were also barefoot at the worship of Vesta. <span
id="fr_188"></span>[161](#fn_188.md) The taboo in these cases may be
ascribed both to the fear of knots and of things which bind and to the
fear of leather.

The taboo on leather is certainly related to the taboo on corpses and
death. A dead animal's skin would be dangerous to a sacred rite; and
this would be particularly true (to repeat) if the animal had died a
natural death. Hence the use of the skin of the sacrificial animal in
religious rites. Since sandals were made of leather and were bound with
thongs, the wearing of these would be forbidden, for the additional
reason that they would bind up the rites as they bound up the feet--a
principle which we shall note in our treatment of the taboo on knots.

### Days

The days following the Kalends, the Nones, and the Ides of every month
were called black days (dies atri) by the Romans. On these days no
battle might be fought, no sacrifice made, no business, public or
private, undertaken. <span id="fr_189"></span>[162](#fn_189.md)
Occasionally, however, the taboo on sacrifice was waived, as, for
example, after the defeat of the Romans at Lake Trasimenus when Hannibal
threatened Rome. <span id="fr_190"></span>[163](#fn_190.md)

The Romans themselves explained black days as instituted by a decree of
the pontiffs in 389 B.C., made because on these days they had suffered
severe reverses in battle--notably on the eighteenth of July when over
three hundred members of the Fabian family were defeated at Cremera (477
B.C.) by the people of Veii, and at the Trebia where Hannibal was
victorious over the Romans (217 B.C.). The generals in both cases had
taken the omens and followed them with disastrous results; hence the
prohibition of sacrifices on that day in later times.

The taboo on these days, if the historical explanation is correct--as
well it may be--was artificial and not truly primitive. However, there
is a possible explanation in another direction. <span
id="fr_191"></span>[164](#fn_191.md) The Hindoos call the days when the
moon is waning the "dark half" of the month, and when it is waxing they
call it the "bright half." Now in Latin the word quinquatrus, the fifth
day after the period when the moon is full and at its brightest--the
Ides--may possibly be a compound of quinque and ater, thus making it the
fifth of the black days when the moon is waning. By this etymology, the
Tusculan terms triatrus, sexatrus, septematrus, and the Falernian
decimatrus would be respectively the third, sixth, seventh, and tenth
black days after the Ides, when the moon was on the wane. When the
original meaning of the "black day"--that is, referring to the darkness
of the moon--had been forgotten, the popular mind interpreted ater as
meaning unlucky or tabooed.

The twenty-fourth of August, the fifth of October and the eighth of
November were termed dies religiosi. On these days the spirits of the
dead (manes) were believed to issue forth into the upper world through
the mundus--the name given to a trench or entrance to a vault in the
city of Romulus which was believed to be the gate of hell. <span
id="fr_192"></span>[165](#fn_192.md) On these days, again, no public
business might be undertaken, no battle fought, no army conscripted.
This taboo is ascribable to the taboo on death and corpses. So, too, the
taboo on death accounts for the fact that the days of the Parentalia in
February and those of the Lemuria in May were religiosi. On the days in
February known collectively as the Parentalia no temple might be open,
no fire might burn on the altars, and no marriages could be performed.
The magistrates laid aside their official dress for the day and wore
that of ordinary citizens. <span id="fr_193"></span>[166](#fn_193.md)

June seventh, when the temple of Vesta was allowed to remain open, was
religiosus. Fowler ascribes  <span id="fr_194"></span>[167](#fn_194.md) the
taboo on the day to ". . . some mystical purification or disinfection
preparatory to the ingathering of the crops." It was considered unlucky
for a Roman girl to marry on the Kalends, the Nones, or the Ides of any
month. The pontiffs had decreed them "black" because, whenever on these
days Roman generals petitioned the gods for success in battle, disasters
followed. <span id="fr_195"></span>[168](#fn_195.md)
