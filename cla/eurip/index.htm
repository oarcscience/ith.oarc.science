<span class="c_da"><!-- Euripides --></span>
<P>
Euripides was born in Salamis in 480 B.C.E. Along with
<A HREF="../aesch/index.htm">Aeschylus</A> and
<A HREF="../soph/index.htm">Sophocles</A> he was
one of the three leading ancient writers of tragic plays.
Very little is known about his personal life;
it is belived that he came from a wealthy family and was
politically active.
Euripides left Athens in 408 B.C.E. and took up residence in Macedonia
under the sponsorship of its king; he died shortly thereafter.
He did not win as many competitions as Aeschylus or Sophocles, and was
used as a running joke in Aristophanes' plays,
where he appears as a satirical character.
However his dramas became more popular than the other two 'immortals'
as time went by.
His greatest works are <CITE>Alcestis</CITE>, <CITE>Medea</CITE>,
<CITE>Electra</CITE> and <CITE>The Bacchae</CITE>.
