### CHAPTER II

#### THE SOURCES FOR A LIFE OF EURIPIDES: THE MEMORIES REMAINING IN THE FOURTH CENTURY: HIS YOUTH AND ITS SURROUNDINGS: ATHENS AFTER THE PERSIAN WAR: THE GREAT SOPHISTS

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> is in one sense impossible to write a
life of Euripides, for the simple reason that he lived too long ago. In
his time people were only just beginning to write history at all;
Herodotus, the "father of history," was his close contemporary. They had
begun to record really great events; but it had not occurred to them
that the life of any individual was worth all the trouble of tracing out
and writing down. Biography of a sort began about two generations
afterwards, when the disciples of Aristotle and Epicurus exerted
themselves to find out and record the lives of their masters. But
biography in our sense—the complete writing of a life year by year with
dates and documents—was never practised at all in antiquity. Think of
the Gospels, of the Acts, even of Tacitus’ *Life of Agricola*. They are
different one from

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

another, but they are all unlike any modern biography in their resolute
indifference to anything like completeness. Ancient "Lives" as a rule
select a few great deeds, a few great sayings or discourses; they
concentrate upon the last years of their subject and often especially
upon his death.

The dates at which various eminent men of antiquity died are well known.
The man was then famous and his death was a memorable event. But—except
in a few aristocratic states, like Cos, which records the actual
birthday of the great physician Hippocrates—no baby was eminent and not
many young men. Very few dates of birth are known; and in the case of
almost all the famous men of antiquity their early histories are
forgotten and their early works lost. So it is with Euripides.

History in later antiquity was chiefly a branch of *belles lettres* and
made no great effort after exactness. As a rule it contented itself with
the date at which a man "flourished," a very rough conception,
conventionally fixed either by the time when he did his most memorable
work or the year when he reached the age of forty. The year commonly
assigned to Euripides’ birth is a good instance of ancient method in
these things.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The system of
chronology was badly confused. In the first place there was no generally
accepted era from which to date; and even if there had been, the
numerical system, before the invention of Arabic ciphers, was as
confused as English spelling is at the present day, and made it hard to
do the simplest sums. So the ordinary educational plan was to group
events together in some scheme that might not be quite exact but was
calculated to have some symbolic interest and to stay in the memory. For
instance, the three great tragedians were grouped together round the
Battle of Salamis, the great triumph of the Persian Wars in 480 B.C.
Aeschylus fought among the heavy-armed infantry. Sophocles danced in a
choir of boys to celebrate the victory, and Euripides was born in
Salamis on the day of the battle. We do not know the origin of this
pleasant fable; but we have another date given in a very ancient
chronicle called the *Parian Marble*, which was found in the island of
Paros in the seventeenth century and was composed in the year 264 B.C.
It puts the birth of Euripides in 484 B.C., and since we cannot find any
reason why this year should be invented, and since the *Marble* is the
oldest witness now extant,

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

we shall probably do well provisionally to accept its statement.

In some of the MSS. which preserve Euripides’ plays there are "scholia"
or ancient traditional commentaries written round the margin. A few of
the oldest notes in them come from Alexandrian scholars who lived in the
second century B.C. Others date from Roman times, in the first few
centuries of the Christian era; others from the eleventh century and
even later. And among them there is a quite ancient document called
*Life and Race of Euripides*.

It is anonymous and shapeless. Sentences may have been added or omitted
by the various people who at different times have owned or copied the
MSS. But we can see that it is derived from early sources, and notably
from a "Life" which was written by one Satyrus, a writer of the
Peripatetic or Aristotelian school, towards the end of the third century
B.C. Fragments from the same source have been detected in the Latin
authors Varro and Gellius; and it has influenced the biographical notice
in the ancient Greek lexicon of Suidas (tenth century A.D.). Suidas used
also another earlier and better source, the *Attic Chronicle* of
Philochorus.

Philochorus was a careful and systematic

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

annalist of the early third century B.C., who used official documents
and verified his statements. His main work was to record all that
affected Athens—history, myths, festivals and customs, but he also wrote
various special treatises, one of which was *On Euripides*. Satyrus
wrote a series of *Lives of Famous Men*, which was very popular, and we
are now—since 1911—in a position to judge how undeserved its popularity
was. For fragments of his *Life of Euripides* have been unearthed in
Egypt by Drs. Grenfell and Hunt and published in their *Oxyrrhyncus
Papyri*, vol. ix. The life takes the form of a dialogue—apparently a
dialogue with a lady. It is a mass of quotations, anecdotes, bits of
literary criticism, all run together with an air of culture and
pleasantness, a spice of gallantry and a surprising indifference to
historical fact. Evidently anecdotes amused Satyrus and facts, as such,
did not. He cared about literary style, but he neither cared nor knew
about history. The following considerations will make this clear.

Euripides was, more than any other figure in ancient history, a constant
butt for the attacks of comedy. And we find, oddly enough, that most of
the anecdotes about Euripides in Satyrus are simply the jokes of

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

comedy treated as historical fact. For instance, in Aristophanes’ play,
*The Women at the Thesmophoria*, the women, while alone at this private
festival, agree to murder Euripides because, by his penetrating study of
female character on the stage, he has made life too difficult for them.
Euripides, hearing of the plot, persuades his elderly father-in-law to
go in disguise to the forbidden celebration and defend him—which he does
in a ruinously tactless way. Some scenes of brilliant farce are
succeeded by a solemn truce between Euripides and the women of Athens.
It shows what our tradition is worth when we find that both the "*Life
and Race*," and Gellius and Satyrus himself, give as sober fact this
story which we know—and if we did not know could surely see—to be comic
invention. There is another class of fabulous anecdote which plays an
even larger part in the Satyrus tradition. In Aristophanes’ *Frogs*
(1.1048), in a scene where Euripides is defending his plays against the
attacks of Aeschylus, there occurs the chance suggestion that Euripides
had learnt from his own experience all the varied villanies of his
wicked heroines. The idea took root, and he is represented in the
anecdotes as a deceived husband, like his own

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Theseus or
Proctus, and uttering lines suitable to the occasion out of his own
tragedies; as having two wives at once, like his own Neoptolemus—one of
them named Choirile, or "Piggy," and each of course worse than the
other; as torn to pieces by hounds, like his own Actaeon, or by wild
women, like his own Pentheus.

Something of this sort is possibly the origin of a famous joke about
Euripides’ mother, which runs through Aristophanes and is repeated as a
fact in all the Lives. We know from Philochorus that it was not true.
The joke is to connect her with chervil—a grassy vegetable which grew
wild and was only eaten in time of famine—or with wild green-stuff in
general, or simply to call her a greengrocer. It was also a joke to say
anything about beet-root. (*Acharn*. 894, *Frogs* 942.) A man begs
Euripides to bring

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"A new-born chervil from thy mother's breast." (*Acharn*. 478.)

</div>

Or we hear that

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

                          "Wild wrongs he works on women  
Wild as the greens that waved about his cradle." (*Thesm*. 455.)

</div>

When some one is about to quote Euripides his friend cries:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Don't, don't, for God's sake! Don't be-chervil me!" (*Knights* 19.)

</div>

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

Now a much-quoted line from Euripides’ tragedy *Melanippe the Wise*
runs: "It is not my word but my mother's word "; and we know that
Melanippe, and still more her mother, was an authority on potent herbs
and simples. Turn his heroine's mother into his own mother and the
potent herbs into some absurd vegetable, and the fable is made.

Setting aside this fog of misunderstanding and reckless anecdote, let us
try to make out the method on which our best authority, Philochorus, may
have put together his account of Euripides. He had almost no written
materials; he had no collection of letters and papers such as go to the
making of a modern biography. He could, however, consult the public
records of tragic performances as collected and edited by Aristotle and
his pupils and thus fix the dates of Euripides’ plays, especially his
first and last performance, his first victory, and the like. He would
also find a few public inscriptions in which the poet's name was
mentioned, for the archives of that time were mostly engraved on stone
and put up in public places. There was also a portrait bust, authentic
though slightly idealized, taken in the poet's old age, and showing the
worn and beautiful

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

face, the thin hair, and the lips somewhat fallen in. These sources
would give him a few skeleton facts; for anything more he would have to
depend on the accidental memories that survived. If he wrote about
300–290 B.C. there was no one living who could remember a man who died
in 406. But there might be men of seventy whose fathers had spoken to
Euripides and whose grandfathers had known him well. Thus he might with
luck have struck some vein of intimate and intelligent memory, which
would have helped us to understand the great man. But he did not. The
memories are all about the poet's old age, and they are all very
external. We hear that he wore a long beard and had moles on his face.
He lived very much alone, and hated visitors and parties. He had a
quantity of books and could not bear women. He lived on the island of
Salamis in a cave which had two openings and a beautiful view—a good
cave was probably more comfortable than many a Greek house, so this may
not have been a great eccentricity—and there you could see him "all day
long, thinking to himself and writing, for he simply despised anything
that was not great and high." It is like the memories of a child, rather
a puzzled

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

child, watching the great man from a distance.

Some few things come out clearly. He lived in his last years with a
small knot of intimates. Mnesilochus, his wife's father—or, perhaps,
another Mnesilochus of the same family—was a close friend. So was his
servant or secretary, Cephisophon. We do not hear of Socrates as an
intimate: the two owed a great debt to one another, and we hear that
Socrates never went to the theatre except when Euripides had a play
performing: to see a Euripides play he would even stir himself so far as
to walk all the way to the Piraeus. But it is likely enough that both
men were too vivid and original, perhaps too much accustomed to dominate
their respective circles, to be quite comfortable in the same room. And
we never find Euripides conversing with Socrates in Plato's dialogues.

Some of Euripides’ older friends were by this time driven out from
Athens. The great "Sophist," Protagoras, had read his famous book, *On
the Gods*, in Euripides’ own house. But he was now dead, drowned at sea,
and the poet's master, Anaxagoras, had died long before. Some of the
younger artists seem to have found a friend in Euripides. There was

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Timotheus, the
young Ionian composer, who—like most musicians of any originality—was
supposed to have corrupted the music of the day by his florid style and
bold inventions. His first performance in Athens was a mortifying
failure, and we are told that the passionate Ionian was on the point of
killing himself when the old poet came and encouraged him. He had only
to hold fast, and the people who now hissed would turn and applaud.

One fact is especially clear, the restless enmity of the comic writers.
Of the eleven comedies of Aristophanes which have come down to us three
are largely devoted to Euripides, and not one has managed altogether to
avoid touching him. I know of no parallel to it in all the history of
literature. Has there ever again been a tragic poet, or any poet, who so
centred upon himself year after year till he was nearly eighty the
mocking attention of all the popular wits? And how was it that the
Athenian public never tired of this incessant poet-baiting, these
incessant appeals to literary criticism in the midst of farce? The
attacks are sometimes rough and vicious, sometimes acute and searching,
often enough they hide a secret admiration. And the chief enemy,
Aristophanes, must,

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

to judge from his parodies, have known a large number of Euripides’
ninety-two plays by heart, and been at least half fascinated by the
object of his satire. However that may be, the hostility of the comic
writers had evidently a general hostility behind it. Our tradition
states this definitely and the persistency of the attacks proves it. You
cannot go on constantly deriding on the stage a person whom your
audience does not wish derided. And the unpopularity of Euripides, as we
shall see later, is not hard to understand. The Satyrus tradition puts
it down to his personal aloofness and austerity. He avoided society, and
he "made no effort to please his audience." So that at least he did not
soften by personal pleasantness the opposition they felt to his whole
view of life. It was not only that he was utterly alienated from the War
Party and the mob leaders: here he only agreed with Aristophanes. It was
that he had pierced through to a deeper stratum of thought, in which
most of the pursuits and ideals of the men about him stood condemned.
Socrates reached the same plane, and they killed Socrates.

It is somewhat harder to understand the universal assumption of our
authorities that

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Euripides was a
notorious castigator of the female sex and that the women of Athens
naturally hated him. To us he seems an aggressive champion of women;
more aggressive, and certainly far more appreciative, than Plato. Songs
and speeches from the *Medea* are recited to-day at suffragist meetings.
His tragic heroines are famous and are almost always treated with
greater interest and insight than his heroes. Yet not only the ancients,
but all critics up to the last generation or so, have described him as a
woman-hater. What does it mean? Is Aristophanes ironical, and are the
scholiasts and grammarians merely stupid? Or is there some explanation
for this extraordinary judgment?

I think the explanation is that the present age is the first, or almost
the first, that has learned to treat its heroines in fiction as real
human beings, with what are called "mixed characters." As lately as the
time of Sir Walter Scott, perhaps as lately as Dickens, common
convention demanded that a heroine, if sympathetic, should be so free
from faults as to be almost without character. Ibsen's heroines, who
were real human beings studied with sympathy but with profound
sincerity, seemed to their

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

generation shocking and even horrible. All through the ages the ideal of
womanhood in conventional fiction has mostly been of the type praised by
one great Athenian thinker: "the greatest glory for a woman is to be as
little mentioned as possible among men." If that ideal was really
predominant among the women of Athens, it is no wonder that they felt
outraged by Euripides. They had not reached, and most of their husbands
had not reached, the point of being interested in good study of
character, much less the point of demanding a freer and more strenuous
life. To the average stupid Athenian it was probably rather wicked for a
woman to have any character, wicked for her to wish to take part in
public life, wicked for her to acquire learning, or to doubt any part of
the conventional religion, just as it was wicked for her to deceive her
husband. Such women should not be spoken about; above all they should
not be treated with understanding and sympathy. The understanding made
it all infinitely worse. To people of this type the women of Euripides
must have been simply shocking and the poet himself a cruel enemy of the
sex. One only wonders that they could stand Sophocles’ heroines, such as
Antigone and Jocasta. To cleverer

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

men, like Aristophanes, the case would, no doubt, seem rather more
complicated. But Aristophanes, amid the many flashes of sympathy he
shows for "advanced" women, was not the man to go against his solid
conservative audience or to forgo such rich material for jokes.

In any case this is the kind of picture we have of Euripides in his last
years; a figure solitary, austere, with a few close intimates, wrapped
up in living for what he would call "the service of the Muses," in
music, poetry and speculation; capable still of thrilling his audiences
with an intensity of tragic emotion such as no other poet had ever
reached; but bowed with age, somewhat friendless, and like other
solitaries a little strange in his habits; uncomprehendingly admired and
hated, and moving always through a mist of half-envious, half-derisive
laughter. *Calvus et calvinista*—one is reminded, amid many differences,
of the quaint words in which William the Silent describes his own
passage from youth to age, till the brilliant Catholic prince, leader of
courts and tourneys, sate at last in his lonely council chamber "bald
and a Calvinist." Let us try to trace the path of life which led him to
this end.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

He was the son of Mnesarchus or Mnesarchides—such names often have
alternative forms—who is said to have been a merchant. His mother,
Cleito, the supposed greengrocer, was, according to Philochorus, "of
very high birth." He was born at Phlya, a village in the centre of
Attica. The neighbourhood is celebrated still for its pleasant trees and
streams in the midst of a sunburnt land. In Euripides’ time it was more
famous for its temples. It was the seat of Demeter Anesidora (Earth,
Upsender of Gifts), of Dionysus of the Blossom, and the Dread Virgins,
old-world and mysterious names, not like the prevailing gods of the
Homeric mythology. Most famous of all, it possessed the mystery temple
of Erôs, or Love. Owing to the researches of recent years, these
mysteries can now be in their general nature understood. They are
survivals of an old tribal society, in which all the boys as they
reached maturity were made to pass through certain ordeals and
initiations. They were connected both with vegetation and with re-birth
after death, because they dated from a remote age in which the
fruitfulness of the tribal fields was not differentiated from the
fruitfulness of the flocks and the human families, and the new members
born into the community were

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

normally supposed to be the old ancestors returning to their homes. By
Euripides’ day such beliefs had faded into mystical doctrines, to be
handled with speechless reverence, not to be questioned or understood,
but they had their influence upon his mind. There were other temples,
too, belonging to the more aristocratic gods of heroic mythology, as
embodied in Homer. Euripides was in his youth cup-bearer to a certain
guild of Dancers—dancing in ancient times had always religious
associations about it—who were chosen from the "first families in
Athens" and danced round the altar of the Delian Apollo. He was also
Fire-bearer to the Apollo of Cape Zôstêr; that is, it was his office to
carry a torch in the procession which on a certain night of each year
met the Delian Apollo at Cape Zôstêr, and escorted him on his mystic
path from Delos to Athens.

When the child was four years old he had to be hurried away from his
home and then from his country. The Persians were coming. The awful
words lost none of their terror from the fact that in Greek the word
"Persai," Persians, meant "to destroy." So later it added something to
the dread inspired by Rome that her name, "Roma," meant "strength." The
family must have crossed

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

the narrow seas to Salamis or further, and seen the smoke of the Persian
conflagrations rising daily from new towns and villages of Attica and at
last from the Acropolis, or Citadel, itself. Then came the enormous
desperate sea-battle; the incredible victory; the sight of the broken
oriental fleet beating sullenly away for Asia and safety, and the solemn
exclamation of the Athenian general, Themistocles, "It is not we who
have done this!" The next year the Athenians could return to Attica and
begin to build up their ruined farms. Then came the final defeat of the
Persian land army at Plataea, and the whole atmosphere lifted. Athens
felt that she had acted like a hero and was reaping a hero's reward. She
had borne the full brunt of the war; she had voluntarily put herself
under the orders of Sparta rather than risk a split in the Greek forces;
and now she had come out as the undisputed mistress of the sea, the
obvious champion round whom the eastern Greeks must rally. Sparta, not
interested in matters outside her own borders, and not capable of any
constructive policy, dropped sulkily out, and left her to carry on the
offensive war for the liberation of the Greeks in Asia. The current of
things was with her.

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

But this great result was not merely the triumph of a particular city;
it was the triumph of an ideal and a way of life. Freedom had defeated
despotism, democracy had defeated kings, hardy poverty had defeated all
the gold of the East. The men who fought of their free will for home and
country had proved more lasting fighters than the conscripts who were
kept in the lines by fear of tortures and beheadings and impalements.
Above all "virtue," as the Greeks called it, or "virtue" and "wisdom"
together, had shown their power. The words raise a smile in us; indeed,
our words do not properly correspond with the Greek, because we can not
get our ideas simple enough. "Virtue" is what makes a man, or anything
else, good; it is the quality of a good soldier, a good general, a good
citizen, a good bootmaker, a good horse or almost a good sword. And
"wisdom" is that by which a man knows how to do things—to use a spear,
or a tool, to think and speak and write, to do figures and history and
geometry, to advise and convince his fellow-citizens. All these great
forces moved, or so it seemed at the time, in the same direction; and
probably it was hardly felt as a dangerous difference when many people
preferred to say that it was "piety"

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

that had won in the war against "impiety," and that the Persians had
been destroyed because, being monotheists, they had denied the Gods. No
doubt "piety," properly understood, was a kind of "wisdom." Let us take
a few passages from the old Ionian historian, Herodotus, to illustrate
what the feeling for Athens was in Euripides’ youth.

Athens represented Hellenism (*Hdt*. I. 60). "The Greek race was
distinguished of old from the barbarian as more intelligent and more
emancipated from silly nonsense (or 'savagery') … And of all the Greeks
the Athenians were counted first in Wisdom." Athens, as the old epigram
put it, was "The Hellas of Hellas."

And this superior wisdom went with freedom and democracy. "So Athens
grew. It is clear wherever you test it, what a good thing is equality
among men. Athens under the tyrants was no better than her neighbours,
even in war; when freed from the tyrants she was far the first of all."
(V. 78.)

And what did this freedom and democracy mean? A speaker in Herodotus
tells us (III. 80): "A tyrant disturbs ancient laws, violates women,
kills men without trial. But a people ruling—first the very name of it

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

is beautiful, and secondly a people does none of these things."

And the freedom is not mere licence. When Xerxes heard the small numbers
of the Greeks who were opposed to him he asked why they did not all run
away, "especially as you say they are free and there is no one to stop
them?" And the Spartan answered: "They are free, O King, but not free to
do everything. For there is a master over them named Law, whom they fear
more than thy servants fear thee." (VII. 104. This refers specially to
the Spartans, but the same tale is told by Aeschylus of the Athenians.
It applies to any free Greeks as against the enslaved barbarian.)

The free Athenian must also have *aretê*, "virtue." He must be a better
man in all senses than the common herd. As Themistocles put it; at every
turn of life there is a choice between a higher and a lower, and they
must choose the higher always. Especially there is one sense in which
Athens must profess aretê; the sense of generosity or chivalry. When the
various Greek states were contending for the leadership before the
battle of Artemisium, the Athenians, though contributing much the
largest fleet, "thought that the great thing was that Greece should be
saved,

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

and gave up their claims." (*Hdt*. VIII. 3.) In the similar dispute for
the post of honour and danger, before the battle of Plataea, the
Athenians did plead their cause and won it. But they pleaded promising
to abide loyally by Sparta's decision if their claims were rejected, and
their arguments show what ideal they had formed of themselves. They
claim that in recent years they alone have met the Persians
single-handed on behalf of all Greece; that in old times it was they who
gave refuge to the children of Heracles when hunted through Greece by
the tyrant Eurystheus; it was they who, at the cost of war, prevented
the conquering Thebans from leaving their dead enemies to rot unburied
and thus offending against the laws of Greece and humanity.

This is the light in which Athens conceived herself; the ideal up to
which, amid much confused, hot-headed and self-deceiving patriotism, she
strove to live. She was to be the Saviour of Hellas.

 

Euripides was about eight when the ruined walls of Athens were rebuilt
and the city, no longer defenceless against her neighbours, could begin
to rebuild the "House of Athena" on the Acropolis and restore the
Temples and

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

the Festivals throughout Attica. He can hardly have been present when
the general Themistocles, then at the height of his fame, provided the
Chorus for the earliest of the great tragedians, Phrynichus, in 476 B.C.
But he must have watched the new paintings being put up by the same
Themistocles in the temples at Phlya, with scenes from the Persian War.
And through his early teens he must have watched the far more famous
series of pictures with which Polygnôtus, the first of the great Greek
painters, was adorning the Acropolis; pictures that canonized scenes
from the Siege of Troy and other legendary history. When he was ten he
may probably have seen a curious procession which brought back from the
island of Skyros the bones of Theseus, the mythical king of Athens and
the accepted symbol, king though he was, of Athenian enlightenment and
democracy. Athens was now too great and too self-conscious to allow
Theseus to lie on foreign soil. When he was twelve he may have seen
Aeschylus’ *Persae*, "the one great play dealing with an historical
event that exists in literature." When he was seventeen he pretty
certainly saw the *Seven against Thebes* and was much influenced by it;
but the Choregus this time was a new statesman, Pericles. Themistocles

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

was in banishment; and the other great heroes of the Persian time,
Aristides and Miltiades, dead.

Next year, 466 B.C., Euripides became officially an "Ephêbus," or
"Youth." He was provided with a shield and spear, and set to garrison
and police duty in the frontier forts of Attica. Full military service
was to follow in two years. Meantime the current of his thoughts must
have received a shock. For, while his shield and spear were still fresh,
news came of one of the most stunning military disasters in Athenian
history. A large colony which had been established on the river Strymon
in Thrace had been lured into dangerous country by the Thracian tribes,
then set upon by overwhelming numbers and massacred to the number of ten
thousand. No wonder that one of Euripides’ earliest plays, when he took
to writing, was the story of *Rhesus*, the Thracian, and his rushing
hordes of wild tribesmen.

But meantime Euripides had not found his work in life. We hear that he
was a good athlete; there were records of his prizewinning in Athens and
in Eleusis. Probably every ambitious boy in Greece did a good deal of
running and boxing. More serious was his attempt at painting. Polygnotus
was at work

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

in Athens, and the whole art advancing by leaps and bounds. He tried to
find his true work there, and paintings by his hand were discovered by
antiquarians of later times—or so they believed—in the town of Megara.
His writings show a certain interest in painting here and there, and it
is perhaps the painter in him that worked out in the construction of his
dramas such fine and varied effects of grouping.

But there was more in the air than painting and sculpture. The youth of
Euripides fell in an age which saw perhaps the most extraordinary
intellectual awakening known to human history. It had been preparing for
about a century in certain cities of Ionian Greece, on the coast of Asia
Minor, rich and cultivated states, subject for the most part to Lydian
or Persian governors. The revolt of these cities and its suppression by
Persia had sent numbers of Ionian "wise men," philosophers, poets,
artists, historians, men of science, to seek for refuge in Greece, and
especially in Athens. Athens was held to be the mother-city of all the
Ionian colonies, and had been their only champion in the revolt. She
became now, as one of these Ionian exiles put it, "the hearth on which
the fire of Hellas burned." It is difficult to describe this great

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

movement in a few pages, but one can, perhaps, get some idea of it by an
imaginary comparison. Imagine first the sort of life that was led in
remote parts of Yorkshire or Somerset towards the end of the eighteenth
century, a stagnant rustic life with no moving ideas, and unquestioning
in its obedience to authority, in which hardly any one could read except
the parson, and the parson's reading was not of a kind to stir a man's
pulse. And next imagine the intellectual ferment which was then in
progress in London or Paris; the philosophers, painters, historians and
men of science, the voices proclaiming that all men were equal, that the
laws of England were unjust to the poor, that slavery was a crime, and
that monarchy was a false form of government, or that no action was
morally wrong except what tended to produce human misery. Imagine then
what would occur in the mind of a clever and high-thinking boy who was
brought suddenly from the one society into the heart of the second, and
made to realise that the battles and duties and prizes of life were
tenfold more thrilling and important than he had ever dreamed. That is
the kind of awakening that must have occurred in the minds of a large
part of the Greek people in the early fifth century.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

A thoroughly backward peasant in a Greek village—even an Attic village
like Phlya—had probably as few ideas as other uneducated peasants. In
Athens some fifty years later we hear that it was impossible, with the
best will in the world, to find any one who could not read or write.
(*Ar. Knights* 188 ff.) But the difference in time and place is
cardinal. The countryman who voted for the banishment of Aristides the
Just had to ask some one else to write the name for him. Such a man did
not read nor yet think. He more or less hated the next village and
regarded its misfortunes as his own advantage. He was sunk in
superstition. His customs were rigid and not understood. He might
worship a goddess with a horse's head or a hero with a snake's tail. He
would perform for the welfare of his fields traditional sacrifices that
were often filthy and sometimes cruel. On certain holy days he would
tear small beasts to pieces or drive them into a fire; in very great
extremities he would probably think no medicine so good as human blood.
His rules of agriculture would be a mixture of rough common sense and
stupid taboos: he would not reap till the Pleiades were rising, and he
would carefully avoid sitting on a fixed stone. When

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

he sought for learning, he would get it in old traditional books like
*Hesiod*, which taught him how Ouranos had been mutilated by his son
Cronos, and Cronos bound with chains by his son Zeus; how Zeus was king
of gods and men, but had been cheated by Prometheus into accepting bones
instead of meat in a sacrifice. He would believe that Tantalus had given
the gods his son Pelops to eat, to see if they would know the
difference, and some of them had eaten bits of him. He would perhaps be
ready, with great hesitation, to tolerate certain timid attempts to
expurgate the story, like Pindar's, for instance, which results,
according to our judgment, in making it rather worse. And this man,
rooted in his customs, his superstitions, his narrow-minded cruelties,
will of course regard every departure from his own way of life as so
much pure wickedness. In every contest that goes on between Intelligence
and Stupidity, between Enlightenment and Obscurantism, the powers of the
dark have this immense advantage: they never understand their opponents,
and consequently represent them as always wrong, always wicked, whereas
the intelligent party generally makes an effort to understand the stupid
and to sympathize with anything

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

that is good or fine in their attitude. Many of our Greek Histories
still speak as if the great spiritual effort which created fifth century
Hellenism was a mass of foolish chatter and intellectual trickery and
personal self-indulgence.

It was not that, nor anything like that. Across the mind of our stupid
peasant the great national struggle against Persia brought first the
idea that perhaps really it was better to die than to be a slave; that
it was well to face death not merely for his own home but
actually—incredible as it seemed—for other people's homes, for the homes
of those wretched people in the next village. Our own special customs
and taboos, he would reflect with a shiver, do not really matter when
they are brought into conflict with a common Hellenism or a common
humanity. There are greater things about us than we knew. There are also
greater men. These men who are in everybody's mouth: Themistocles above
all, who has defeated the Persian and saved Greece: but crowds of others
besides, Aristides the Just and Miltiades, the, hero of Marathon;
Demokêdes, the learned physician, who was sought out by people in need
of help from Italy to Susa; Hecataeus, who had made a picture of the
whole earth,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

showing all the countries and cities and rivers and how far each is from
the next, and who could have saved the Ionians if they had only listened
to him; Pythagoras, who had discovered all about numbers and knew the
wickedness of the world and had founded a society, bound by strict
rules, to combat it. What is it about these men that has made them so
different from you and me and the other farmers who meet in the agora on
market-day? It is *sophia*, wisdom; it is *aretê*, virtue. They are not
a bit stronger in the arm, not bigger, not richer, or more high-born:
they are just wiser, and thus better men. Cannot we be made wise? We
know we are stupid, we are very ignorant, but we can learn.

The word Sophistes means either "one who makes wise," or, possibly, as
some scholars think, "one who deals in wisdom." The difference is
slight. In any case it was in answer to this call for sophia that the
Sophists arose. Doubtless they were of all kinds; great men and small,
honest and dishonest; teachers of real wisdom and of pretence. Our
tradition is rather bitter against them, because it dates from the
bitter time of reaction and disappointment, when the hopes of the fifth
century and the men who

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

guided it seemed to have led Athens only to her fall. Plato in
particular is against them as he is against Athens herself. In the main
the judgment of the afterworld upon them will depend on the side we take
in a never-ending battle: they fought for light and knowledge and
freedom and the development of all man's powers. If we prefer blinkers
and custom, subordination and the rod, we shall think them dangerous and
shallow creatures. But, to see what the sophists were like, let us
consider two of them who are recorded as having specially been the
teachers of Euripides.

Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, in Ionia, was about fifteen years older than
Euripides, and spent some thirty years of his life in Athens. He
discovered for the first time that the moon shines by the reflection of
the sun's light; and he explained, in the main correctly, the cause of
eclipses. The sun was not a god: it was a white-hot mass of stone or
earth, in size perfectly enormous. In describing its probable size,
language failed him; he only got as far as saying—what must have seemed
almost a mad exaggeration—that it was many times larger than the
Peloponnese. He held, if lie did not invent, a particular form of the
atomic theory

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

which has played such a great rôle in the history of modern science. He
was emphatic on the indestructibility of matter. Things could be broken
up into their elements and could grow together again, but nothing could
be created or destroyed. There was order in the world and purpose, and
this was the work of a conscious power which he called "Nous," or Mind.
"All things were together in a mass, till Mind came and put order into
them." Mind is outside things, not mixed with them, and some authorities
say that Anaxagoras called it "God." Meantime, he showed by experiment
the reality and substance of air, and disproved the common notion of
"empty space." It will be seen that these ideas, if often crudely
expressed, are essentially the same ideas which gave new life to modern
science after the sleep of the Middle Ages. Almost every one of them is
the subject of active dispute at the present day.

Apart from physical science, we learn that Anaxagoras was a close friend
and adviser of the great Athenian statesman, Pericles; and we have by
chance an account of a long discussion between the two men about the
theory of punishment—whether the object of it is to do "justice" upon a
wrong-doer

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

apart from any result that may accrue, or simply to deter others from
doing the same and thus make society better. The question is the subject
of a vigorous correspondence in the *Times* while these words are
writing. We can understand what an effect such a teacher as this would
have on the eager young man from Phlya. One great word of liberation was
already in the air and belongs to no one sophist or philosopher. This
was the distinction between Nature on the one hand and Custom or
Convention on the other. The historian Herodotus, who was no sophist but
loved a good story, tells how the Persian king, Darius, called some
Greeks and some Indian tribesmen together into his presence. He then
asked the Greeks what payment would induce them to eat the dead bodies
of their fathers. "Nothing in the world," they cried in indignation.
"They would reverently burn them." He proceeded to ask the Indians what
they would take to burn their fathers’ bodies, and they repelled the
bare thought with horror; they would do nothing but eat them with every
mark of love and respect. "Fire burns in the same way both here and in
Persia," the saying was, "but men's notions of right and wrong are not
at all the same."

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The one is Nature;
the other is man's Custom or Convention. This antithesis between
"Phusis" and "Nomos" ran vividly through the whole of Greek philosophy,
and awoke with renewed vigour in Rousseau and the radical writers of the
eighteenth century. It is an antithesis against which conformist
dialecticians have always turned their sharpest weapons. It has again
and again been dissected and refuted and shown to be philosophically
untenable: but it still lives and has still something of the old power
to shatter and to set free. All the thinkers of Greece at the time we
are treating were testing the laws and maxims of their day, and trying
to find out what really rested on Nature and what was the mere
embroidery of man. It is always a dangerous and exciting inquiry;
especially because the most irrational conventions are apt also to be
the most sacrosanct.

This whole spirit was specially incarnate in another of Euripides’
teachers. We hear of Protagoras in his old age from that enemy of the
sophists, Plato. But for this sophist even Plato's satire is kindly and
almost reverent. Protagoras worked not at physical science, but at
language and philosophy. He taught men to think and speak; he began the

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

study of grammar by dividing sentences into four kinds, Optative,
Interrogative, Indicative, Imperative. He taught rhetoric; he formulated
the first theory of democracy. But it was as a sceptic that he struck
men's imaginations most. "About the Gods, I have no means of knowing
either that they are or are not. For the hindrances to knowledge are
many, the darkness of the subject and the shortness of man's life."
Numbers of people, no doubt, went as far as this, and without suffering
for it as Protagoras did; but his scepticism cut deeper and raised
questions still debated in modern thought. "Man is the measure of
things"; there is no truth to be had beyond the impression made on a
man's mind. When this given object seems one thing to A and another
thing to B, it is to each one exactly what it seems; just as honey not
only seems sweet but is sweet to a healthy man, and not only seems
bitter but is bitter to a man with jaundice. Then you can not say, we
may ask, that one or other impression is false, and will prove false on
further inquiry? No: he answers; each impression is equally true. The
only difference is that each state of mind is not equally good. You
cannot prove to the jaundiced man that his honey is sweet, for

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

it is not: or to the drunkard that he does not desire his drink, for he
does: what you can do is to alter the men's state of mind, to cure the
jaundice or the drunkenness. Our cognition flows and changes. It is the
result of an active impact upon a passive percipient. And, resulting
from this change, there are in practice always two things to be said, a
pro and a con, about every possible proposition. There is no general
statement that cannot be contradicted.

Other teachers also are represented as having influenced Euripides;
Archelaus, who tried to conceive Anaxagoras’ "Mind" in some material
form, as air or spirit—for *spiritus*, of course, means "breath";
Prodicus, who, besides his discoveries in grammar, is the author of a
popular and edifying fable which has served in many schoolrooms for many
centuries. It tells how Heracles once came to some cross roads, one road
open, broad, and smooth and leading a little downhill, the other narrow
and uphill and rough: and on the first you gradually became a worse and
worse man, on the second a better one. There was Diogenes of Apollonia,
whose theories about air seem to have had some effect on Euripides’
writings; and of course there was, among the younger men,

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Socrates. Socrates
is too great and too enigmatic a teacher to be summed up in a few
sentences, and though a verse of ancient comedy has come down to us,
saying, "Socrates piles the faggots for Euripides’ fire," his influence
in his older friend is not very conspicuous. Euripides must have caught
something from his scepticism, his indifference to worldly standards,
his strong purpose, and something also from his resolute rejection of
all philosophy except that which was concerned with the doings and
feelings of men. "The fields and trees will not talk to me; it is only
the human beings in the city that will." That saying of Socrates might
be the motto of many a dramatist.

The greatness of these philosophers or sophists of the fifth century
does not, of course, lie in the correctness of their scientific results.
The dullest and most unilluminated text-book produced at the present day
is far more correct than Anaxagoras. Their greatness lies partly in the
pioneer quality of their work. They first struck out the roads by which
later workers could advance further. Partly in the daring and felicity
with which they hit upon great and fruitful ideas, ideas which have
brought light and

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

freedom with them whenever they have recurred to men's minds, and which,
as we have seen, are to a great extent still, after more than two
thousand years, living issues in philosophic thought. Partly it lies in
the mere freedom of spirit with which they set to work, unhampered by
fears and taboos, to seek the truth, to create beauty, and to improve
human life. The difference of atmosphere between the sophists of the
Periclean circle and the ordinary backward Attic farmer must have been
visible to every observer. If more evidence of the great gulf was
needed, it was supplied emphatically enough in the experience of
Euripides. He was himself prosecuted by Cleon, the demagogue, for
"impiety." The same charge had been levelled even against his far less
destructive predecessor, Aeschylus. Of these three special friends whom
we have mentioned, Euripides did not live to see Socrates condemned to
death and executed. But he saw Anaxagoras, in spite of the protection of
Pericles, accused of "impiety" and compelled to fly for his life. He saw
Protagoras, for the book which he had read aloud in Euripides’ own
house, prosecuted and condemned. The book was publicly burned; the
author escaped, it is said, only to be drowned at sea, a

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

signal mark in the eyes of the orthodox of how the gods regarded such
philosophy.

Thought was no doubt freer in ancient Athens than in any other city
within two thousand years of it. Those who suffered for religious
advance are exceedingly few. But it was not in human nature, especially
in such early times, for individuals to do such great service to their
fellow men and not occasionally be punished for it. They induced men for
a time to set reason and high ideals above the instincts of the herd:
and sooner or later the herd must turn and trample them.

One of the ancient lives says that it was this sense of the antagonism
between Anaxagoras and the conservative masses that turned Euripides
away from philosophy. One need scarcely believe that. The way he took
was not the way to escape from danger or unpopularity. And when a man
shows extraordinary genius for poetry one need not search for the
reasons which induced him not to write prose. He followed in the wake
not of Anaxagoras but of Aeschylus.
