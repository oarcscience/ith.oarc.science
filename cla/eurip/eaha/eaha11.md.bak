### BIBLIOGRAPHY

<span class="smallcaps">Texts</span>.—Murray, 3 vols., 3s. 6d. each
(Oxford, 1901–1913), with brief critical notes. This edition received
much help from Wilamowitz and Verrall. *Wecklein-Prinz* (Leipzig, about
1895 to 1905), edited by Dr. Wecklein from Prinz's collations of MSS.;
large critical apparatus and lists of emendations. Text much altered.

<span class="smallcaps">Fragments</span>. *Fragmenta Tragicorum
Graecorum* by Nauck (Leipzig, second edition, 1889): this fine book
still holds the field (26s.). *Supplementum Euripideum* by H. von Arnim
(Bonn, 1912). (Price 2s.) Contains the recent papyrus discoveries; a
convenient and learned little book, defaced by metrical errors.

<span class="smallcaps">Texts with Commentary</span>.—Paley, 3 vols.,
8s. each (Cambridge, second edition, 1880). Though old-fashioned and
often based on wrong information about the MSS. and other matters this
is a most sound and thoughtful work. Of the numerous modern editions
(especially school editions) of particular plays we may mention
*Euripides’ Herakles* erklärt von Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff
(first edition, Berlin, 1889); since re-edited in two volumes. This is
an epoch-making book, and together with the same author's *Analecta
Euripidea* (1875) has laid the foundation for modern criticism: also

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Verrall's Medea,
Sandys' Bacchae, Keene's Electra, Powell's Phoenissae. In French, Weil's
*Sept Tragédies d’Euripide;* in German Bruhn's editions of the Iphigenia
in Tauris and the Bacchae deserve special note.

<span class="smallcaps">Translations</span>.—There are complete
translations of the extant plays in prose by Coleridge (Bohn) and in
verse by A. Way (Macmillan). A good prose translation, which should
really bring out the full meaning of the Greek, is greatly needed. By
Murray there are at present translations of the following plays:
Hippolytus, Bacchae, Trojan Women, Electra, Medea, Iphigenia in Tauris,
Rhesus. In paper 1s. each, in cloth 2s. (George Allen).

<span class="smallcaps">Essays, etc.</span>—The best starting point is
Haigh's *Tragic Drama of the Greeks* (Oxford, 1896), pp. 804–381;
Introduction to vol. i. of Paley's Commentary (see above); Articles in
the Histories of Greek Literature by Mahaffy, Jebb (both Primer and
article in Encyclopædia Britannica), Jevons, Murray. In French, the
article in Croiset's *History of Literature;* P. Decharme, *Euripide et
l’esprit de son Théâtre* (Paris, 1893); P. Masqueray, *Euripide et ses
Idées* (Paris, 1908). In German, the "Einleitung" to Wilamowitz's
*Herakles*, vol. i. (Berlin, 1889); Dieterich's article on Euripides in
Pauly-Wissowa's *Real Encyclopädie* is excellent, though severely
compressed and ignorant of English work; articles in the Histories of
Literature by Bergk (still valuable), Christ (in Ivan Müller's
Handbuch), Bethe (in Gercke und Norden's Handbuch), Wilamowitz (in
*Kultur der Gegenwart*); the

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

account in Eduard Meyer's *Geschichte des Alterthums*, vol. iv., is
good. Also Ed. Schwartz, *Charakterköpfe aus der Antiken Literatur*
(Leipzig, 1906), second study, very good: H. Steiger, *Euripides, seine
Dichtung and seine Persönlichkeit* (Leipzig, 1918). Useful, though often
uncritical is W. Nestle Euripides, *der Dichter der Griechischen
Aufklärung* (Stuttgart, 1901); also *Die Philosophische Quellen des
Euripides* (Leipzig, 1908). The ideas of "the Enlightenment," to which
reference is often made, can be well studied in Mr. Brailsford's book in
this Library, *Shelley, Godwin, and Their Circle*.

Dr. A. W. Verrall's theory of Euripides is developed in *Euripides the
Rationalist* (Cambridge, 1905); *Euripides’ Ion* (1890); *Four Plays of
Euripides* (1905); *The Bacchantes of Euripides* (1910). See also G.
Norwood, *The Riddle of the Bacchae* (London, 1908).

Murray's previous writings include the chapter in his *Ancient Greek
Literature* (1898); introduction to vol. ii. of *The Athenian Drama*
(George Allen, 1908). (This volume is called "Euripides" and contains,
besides the translations of the Hippolytus, Bacchae and Frogs, since
republished separately, an Introduction and an Appendix on the lost
plays of Euripides). Introductions to his translations of separate
plays: see above; *Greek and English Tragedy*, an essay in English
Literature and the Classics, edited by G. S. Gordon (Oxford, 191e); and
the article on Euripides in Hastings’ *Encyclopaedia of Ethics and
Religion*. (These writings have been sometimes quoted in the present
volume.)

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

The Lives can best be read in the edition of the *Scholia* by Ed.
Schwartz (Berlin, 1887). To this must now be added the fragments of
Satyrus in *Oxyrhyncus Papyri*, vol. ix. (also contained, though without
Dr. Hunt's introduction, in Arnim's *Supplementum Euripideum;* see
above). The ancient references to the facts of Euripides’ life are
admirably collected in vol. i. of Nauck's small text of *Euripides*. See
also Wilamowitz's *Herakles*, pp. 1–40.

<span class="smallcaps">Chronology of the
Plays</span>.—Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, *Analecta Euripidea* (Berlin,
1875). Grace Macurdy, *The Chronology of the extant Plays of Euripides*
(Columbia University, 1905).

<span class="smallcaps">Lost Plays</span>.—Fragments in Nauck; see
above. No complete translation. A good many of the lost plays are
treated and fragments translated in the Appendix to Murray's
*Euripides*, *Athenian Drama*, vol. ii.; see above. The classical work
on this subject is still Welcker's *Griechische Tragoedie*, a great
book: 3 vols. (Leipzig, 1839–41.) Hartung's *Euripides Restitutus*, 2
vols. (Hamburg, 1844), is uncritical and somewhat prejudiced against
Welcher, but has much charm.

<span class="smallcaps">Antiquities, etc.</span>—The standard book is
Haigh's *Attic Theatre*, 3rd edition, by A. W. Pickard-Cambridge
(Oxford, 1907). See also *Greek Tragedy* by J. T. Sheppard (Cambridge
Manuals) and *Greek Drama* by Barnet in Dent's Series.
