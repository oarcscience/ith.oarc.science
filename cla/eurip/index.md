Euripides was born in Salamis in 480 B.C.E. Along with
[Aeschylus](../aesch/index) and [Sophocles](../soph/index) he was one of
the three leading ancient writers of tragic plays. Very little is known
about his personal life; it is belived that he came from a wealthy
family and was politically active. Euripides left Athens in 408 B.C.E.
and took up residence in Macedonia under the sponsorship of its king; he
died shortly thereafter. He did not win as many competitions as
Aeschylus or Sophocles, and was used as a running joke in Aristophanes'
plays, where he appears as a satirical character. However his dramas
became more popular than the other two 'immortals' as time went by. His
greatest works are Alcestis, Medea, Electra and The Bacchae.
