titleh1: "The Works of Plutarch"

Plutarch was born in 46 C.E. in Chaeronea, in Boeotia, Greece, and died
about 119-127. He was one of the two priests of Apollo at the Oracle of
Delphi. His skills as a writer and speaker brought him fame in the first
century Roman Empire. Often cited in other books at this site, of
interest are the extensive passages where he discusses puzzling points
about ancient Paganism. In spite of his priestly background, Plutarch
was a bit of a free thinker, and loved to speculate multiple
explanations for natural and cultural phenomena. As such, he is one of
the predecessors of modern social science.
