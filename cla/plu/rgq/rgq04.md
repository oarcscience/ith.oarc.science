------------------------------------------------------------------------

20-29.

20\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that the women, when they
adorn in their houses a shrine to the women's goddess, whom they call
Bona Dea, <span id="fr_35"></span>[a](#fn_35.md) bring in no myrtle,
although they are very eager to make use of all manner of growing and
blooming plants?

Was this goddess, as the mythologists relate, the wife of the seer
Faunus; and was she secretly addicted to wine, <span
id="fr_36"></span>[b](#fn_36.md) but did not escape detection and was
beaten by her husband with myrtle rods, and is this the reason why they
do not bring in myrtle and, when they make libations of wine to her,
call it milk?

Or is it because they remain pure from many things, particularly from
venery, when they perform this holy service? For they not only exclude
their husbands, but they also drive everything male out of the
house <span id="fr_37"></span>[c](#fn_37.md) whenever they conduct the
customary ceremonies in honour of the goddess. So, because the myrtle is
sacred to Venus, they religiously exclude it. For she whom they now call
Venus Murcia, in ancient days, it seems, they styled Myrtia.

 

21\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do the Latins revere the
woodpecker and all strictly abstain <span id="fr_38"></span>[d](#fn_38.md)
from it?

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

Is it because, as they tell the tale, Picus, <span
id="fr_39"></span>[a](#fn_39.md) transformed by his wife's magic drugs,
became a woodpecker and in that form gives oracles and prophecies to
those who consult him?

Or is this wholly incredible and monstrous, and is that other tale <span
id="fr_40"></span>[b](#fn_40.md) more credible which relates that when
Romulus and Remus were exposed, not only did a she-wolf suckle them, but
also a certain woodpecker came continually to visit them and bring them
scraps of food? For generally, even to this day, in foot-hills and
thickly wooded places where the woodpecker is found, there also is found
the wolf, as Nigidius records.

Or is it rather because they regard this bird as sacred to Mars, even as
other birds to other gods? For it is a courageous and spirited bird and
has a beak so strong that it can overturn oaks by pecking them until it
has reached the inmost part of the tree.

 

22\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they suppose Janus to have
been two-faced and so represent him in painting and sculpture?

Is it because, as they relate, he was by birth a Greek from Perrhaebia,
and, when he had crossed to Italy and had settled among the savages
there, he changed both his speech and his habits? Or is it rather
because he changed the people of Italy to another manner and form of
life by persuading a people which had formerly made use of wild plants
and lawless customs to till the soil and to live under organized
government? <span id="fr_41"></span>[c](#fn_41.md)

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

23\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they sell articles for
funerals in the precinct of Libitina, whom they identify with
Venus? <span id="fr_42"></span>[a](#fn_42.md)

Is this also one of the philosophic devices of king Numa, that they
should learn not to feel repugnance at such things nor shun them as a
pollution?

Or is it rather a reminder that whatever is born must die, since one
goddess presides over births and deaths? For in Delphi there is a little
statue of Aphrodite of the Tomb, to which they summon the departed to
come forth for the libations.

 

24\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> have they in the month three
beginnings or fixed points, and do not adopt the same interval of days
between them?

Is it, as Juba <span id="fr_43"></span>[b](#fn_43.md) and his followers
relate, that on the Kalends the officials used to call <span
id="fr_44"></span>[c](#fn_44.md) the people and announce the Nones for the
fifth day thereafter, regarding the Ides as a holy day?

Or is it rather because, since they measured time by the phases of the
moon, they observed that in each month the moon undergoes three very
important changes: first, when she is hidden by her conjunction with the
sun; second, when she has escaped the sun's rays and becomes visible for
the first time at sunset; and third, at the full moon, when her orb is
completely round? The disappearance and concealment of the moon they
call *Kalendae*, for everything

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span> <span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

concealed or secret is *clam*, and "to be concealed" is *celari*. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[a](#fn_45.md) The first appearance of the moon they call
Nones, the most accurate since it is the new moon: for their word for
"new" and "novel" is the same as ours. <span
id="fr_46"></span>[b](#fn_46.md) They name the Ides as they do either
because of the beauty and form (*eidos*) of the full-orbed moon, or by
derivation from a title of Jupiter. <span id="fr_47"></span>[c](#fn_47.md)
But we must not follow out the most exact calculation of the number of
days nor cast aspersions on approximate reckoning; since even now, when
astronomy has made so much progress, the irregularity of the moon's
movements is still beyond the skill of mathematicians, and continues to
elude their calculations. <span id="fr_48"></span>[d](#fn_48.md)

 

25\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they reckon the day that
follows the Kalends, the Nones, or the Ides as unsuitable for leaving
home or for travel?

Is it, as most authorities think and as Livy <span
id="fr_49"></span>[e](#fn_49.md) records, that on the day after the Ides of
Quintilis, which they now call July, the military tribunes led out the
army, and were vanquished in battle by the Gauls at the river Allia and
lost the City? But when the day after the Ides had come to be regarded
as ill-omened, did superstition, as is its wont, extend the custom

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

further, and involve in the same circumspection the day after the Nones
and the day after the Kalends?

Or does this contain many irrational assumptions? For it was on a
different day that they were defeated in battle, <span
id="fr_50"></span>[a](#fn_50.md) a day which they call Alliensis from the
river, and make a dread day of expiation <span
id="fr_51"></span>[b](#fn_51.md); and although they have many ill-omened
days, they do not observe them under the same names <span
id="fr_52"></span>[c](#fn_52.md) in each month, but each in the month in
which it occurs; and it is thus quite incredible that the superstition
should have attached itself simply to all the days that follow
immediately after the Nones or the Kalends.

Consider the following analogy: just as they have dedicated the first
month to the gods of Olympus, and the second, in which they perform
certain rites of purification and sacrifice to the departed, to the gods
of the lower world, so also in regard to the days of the month they have
established three as festive and holy days, as I have stated, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[d](#fn_53.md) which are, as it were, fundamental and
sovereign days; but the days which follow immediately they have
dedicated to the spirits and the dead, and have come to regard them as
ill-omened and unsuitable for business. In fact, the Greeks worship the
gods on the day of the new moon; the next day they have duly assigned to
the heroes and spirits, and the second bowl of wine is mixed in honour
of the heroes and heroines. <span id="fr_54"></span>[e](#fn_54.md) And
speaking generally, time is a sort of number; and the beginning of
number is divine, for it is the monad. But after it is the dyad,
antagonistic to the beginning number, and the first of the even numbers.
The even numbers are imperfect, incomplete,

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

and indeterminate, just as the odd numbers are determinate, completing,
and perfect. <span id="fr_55"></span>[a](#fn_55.md) Wherefore, in like
manner, the Nones succeed the Kalends at an interval of five days and
the Ides succeed the Nones at an interval of nine days. For the odd
numbers define the beginnings, but the even numbers, since they occur
after the beginnings, have no position nor power; therefore on these
days they do not begin any business or travel.

Or has also the saying of Themistocles <span
id="fr_56"></span>[b](#fn_56.md) some foundation in reason? For once upon a
time, said he, the Day-After had an altercation with the Feast-Day on
the ground that the Feast-Day had much labour and toil, whereas she
herself provided the opportunity of enjoying in leisure and quiet all
the things prepared for the festival. To this the Feast-Day replied,
"You are quite right; but if I had not been, you would not be!" This
story Themistocles related to the Athenian generals who succeeded him,
to show that they would have been nowhere, if he himself had not saved
the city.

Since, therefore, all travel and all business of importance needs
provision and preparation, and since in ancient days the Romans, at the
time of festivals, made no provision or plan for anything, save only
that they were engaged in the service of their gods and busied
themselves with this only, just as even to this day the priests cause
such a proclamation to be made in advance as they proceed on their way
to sacrifice; so it was only natural that they did not set out on a
journey immediately after their festivals, nor did they transact any
business, for they were

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

unprepared; but that day they always spent at home making their plans
and preparations.

Or is it even as men now, who have offered their prayers and oblations,
are wont to tarry and sit a while in the temples, <span
id="fr_57"></span>[a](#fn_57.md) and so they would not let busy days
succeed holy days immediately, but made some pause and breathing-space
between, since business brings with it much that is distasteful and
undesired?

 

26\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do women in mourning wear white
robes and white head-dresses?

Do they do this, as men say the Magi do, arraying themselves against
Hades and the powers of darkness, and making themselves like unto Light
and Brightness?

Or is it that, just as they clothe the body of the dead in white, they
think it proper that the relatives should also wear this colour? They
adorn the body thus since they cannot so adorn the soul; and they wish
to send forth the soul bright and pure, since it is now set free after
having fought the good fight in all its manifold forms.

Or are plainness and simplicity most becoming on these occasions? Of the
dyed garments, some reflect expense, others over-elaboration; for we may
say no less with reference to black than to purple: "These be cheating
garments, these be cheating colours." <span
id="fr_58"></span>[b](#fn_58.md) That which is naturally black is dyed not
through art, but by nature; and when it is

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

combined with a dark colour, it is overpowered. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[a](#fn_59.md) Only white, <span
id="fr_60"></span>[b](#fn_60.md) therefore, is pure, unmixed, and
uncontaminated by dye, nor can it be imitated; wherefore it is most
appropriate for the dead at burial. For he who is dead has become
something simple, unmixed, and pure, once he has been released from the
body, which is indeed to be compared with a stain made by dyeing. In
Argos, as Socrates <span id="fr_61"></span>[c](#fn_61.md) says, persons in
mourning wear white garments washed in water.

 

27\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they regard all the city wall
as inviolable and sacred, but not the gates?

Is it, as Varro has written, because the wall must be considered sacred
that men may fight and die with enthusiasm in its defence? It was under
such circumstances, it seems, that Romulus killed his brother because he
was attempting to leap across a place that was inviolable and sacred,
and to make it traversable and profane.

But it was impossible to consecrate the gates, for through them they
carry out many other objectionable things and also dead bodies. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[d](#fn_62.md) Wherefore the original founders of a city
yoke a bull and a cow, and mark out with a plough all the land on which
they intend to build <span id="fr_63"></span>[e](#fn_63.md); and when they
are engaged in tracing <span id="fr_64"></span>[f](#fn_64.md) the circuit
of the walls, as they measure off the space intended for gates, they
lift up the ploughshare and thus carry the plough across,

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

since they hold that all the land that is ploughed is to be kept sacred
and inviolable.

 

28\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they tell children, whenever
they would swear by Hercules, not to do so under a roof, and bid them go
out into the open air? <span id="fr_65"></span>[a](#fn_65.md)

Is it, as some relate, because they believe that Hercules had no
pleasure in staying in the house, but rejoiced in a life in the open air
and a bed under the stars?

Or is it rather because Hercules is not one of the native gods, but a
foreigner from afar? For neither do they swear under a roof by Bacchus,
since he also is a foreign god if he is from Nysa.

Or is this but said in jest to the children, and what is done is really
a check upon over-readiness and hastiness to swear, as Favorinus stated?
For what is done following, as it were, upon preparation produces delay
and allows deliberation. Yet one might urge against Favorinus the fact
that this custom is not common, but peculiar to Hercules, as may be seen
from the legend about him: for it is recorded that he was so circumspect
regarding an oath that he swore but once and for Phyleus, the son of
Augeas, alone. Wherefore they say that the prophetic priestess also
brought up against the Spartans all the oaths they had sworn, saying
that it would be better and much more to be desired if they would keep
them! <span id="fr_66"></span>[b](#fn_66.md)

 

29\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they not allow the bride to
cross the threshold of her home herself, but those who are escorting her
lift her over? <span id="fr_67"></span>[c](#fn_67.md)

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

Is it because they carried off by force also the first Roman brides and
bore them in in this manner, and the women did not enter of their own
accord?

Or do they wish it to appear that it is under constraint and not of
their own desire that they enter a dwelling where they are about to lose
their virginity?

Or is it a token that the woman may not go forth of her own accord and
abandon her home if she be not constrained, just as it was under
constraint that she entered it? So likewise among us in Boeotia they
burn the axle of the bridal carriage before the door, signifying that
the bride must remain, since her means of departure has been destroyed.
