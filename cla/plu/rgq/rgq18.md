30\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is the "Beach of Araenus" in
Thrace?

When the Andrians and Chalcidians sailed to Thrace to settle there, they
jointly seized the city of Sanê, which was betrayed to them; but when
they learned that the barbarians had abandoned Acanthus, they sent out
two scouts. When these were approaching the city, they perceived that
the enemy had all fled; so the Chalcidian ran forward to take possession
of the city for Chalcis, but the Andrian, since he could not cover the
distance so rapidly as

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span> <span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

his rival, hurled his spear, and when it was firmly implanted in the
city gates, he called out in a loud voice that by his spear the city had
been taken into prior possession for the children of the Andrians. As a
result of this a dispute arose, and, without going to war, they agreed
to make use of Erythraeans, Samians, and Parians as arbitrators
concerning the whole matter. But when the Erythraeans and the Samians
gave their vote in favour of the Andrians, and the Parians in favour of
the Chalcidians, the Andrians, in the neighbourhood of this place, made
a solemn vow against the Parians that they would never give a woman in
marriage to the Parians nor take one from them. And for this reason they
called the place the Beach of Araenus, <span
id="fr_310"></span>[a](#fn_308.md) although it had formerly been named the
Serpent's Beach.

 

31\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that at the Thesmophoria
the Eretrian women cook their meat, not by fire, but by the rays of the
sun; and why do they not call upon Calligeneia? <span
id="fr_311"></span>[b](#fn_309.md)

Is it because it happened that the captive women whom Agamemnon was
bringing home from Troy were celebrating the Thesmophoria at this place,
but when conditions for sailing suddenly appeared favourable, they put
out to sea leaving behind them the sacrifice uncompleted?

 

32\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> are the Perpetual Sailors among
the Milesians?

When the despots associated with Thoas and Damasenor had been
overthrown, two political parties came into control of the city, one of
which was called Plutis, the other Cheiromacha. <span
id="fr_312"></span>[c](#fn_310.md) When, accordingly, the men of influence
gained the upper hand and

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span> <span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

brought matters into the control of their party, they used to deliberate
about matters of the greatest importance by embarking in their ships and
putting out to a considerable distance from the land. But when they had
come to a final decision, they sailed back; and because of this they
acquired the appellation of Perpetual Sailors.

 

33\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do the Chalcidians call the
neighbourhood of the Beacon "the Young Men's Club"?

They relate that Nauplius, when he was being pursued by the Achaeans,
came as a suppliant to the Chalcidians; and on the one hand he defended
himself in regard to the indictment brought against him, and on the
other hand brought a counter-charge against the Achaeans. The
Chalcidians had no intention of surrendering him; but, since they were
afraid that he might be slain by treachery, they gave him a guard of
young men in the prime of their youth and stationed them in this place,
where they lived together and at the same time served as a guard for
Nauplius.

 

34\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> was the man that slew an ox
for <span id="fr_313"></span>[a](#fn_311.md) his benefactor?

Anchored off the island of Ithaca was a pirate vessel in which there
chanced to be an old man with earthenware jars containing pitch. By
chance a ferryman of Ithaca, by name Pyrrhias, put off to the ship and
rescued the old man without asking for any reward, but because he had
been persuaded by the old man and pitied him. He did, however, accept
some of the jars, for the old man bade him do so. But when the pirates
had departed and there was nothing to fear, the old man led Pyrrhias to
the jars,

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

and in them showed him much gold and silver mixed with the pitch. So
Pyrrhias, suddenly becoming rich, treated the old man well in various
ways, and also slew an ox for him. Wherefore men make use of this as a
proverbial expression: "No one but Pyrrhias has slain an ox for his
benefactor."

 

35\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> was it the custom for the
Bottiaean maidens to chant as they danced, "Let us go to Athens <span
id="fr_314"></span>[a](#fn_312.md)"?

They relate that the Cretans in accordance with a vow sent a consecrated
offering of men to Delphi; but the men who had been sent, when they saw
that there was no abundance there, set out from Delphi to found a
colony. They settled first in Iapygia, but later occupied this region of
Thrace. There were some Athenians included among them; for it appears
that Minos did not destroy the young persons whom the Athenians sent him
for tribute, but kept them by him as servants. Accordingly, some who
were descended from these Athenians and had come to be considered
Cretans were included in this company sent to Delphi. Wherefore the
daughters of the Bottiaeans, in remembrance of their lineage, were wont
to sing in their festivals, "Let us go to Athens."

 

36\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that the women of the
Eleans, when they sing hymns to Dionysus, call upon him to come to them
"with the foot of a bull" <span id="fr_315"></span>[b](#fn_313.md)? The
hymn <span id="fr_316"></span>[c](#fn_314.md) runs as follows:

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span> <span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Come, O hero Dionysus,  
To thy Elean holy  
Temple, with the Graces,  
To thy temple  
With thy bull's foot hasting.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then they chant
twice the refrain: "O worthy bull."

Is it because some address the god as "kine-born" or as "bull "? Or by
"ox-foot" do they mean "with thy mighty foot," even as the Poet used
"ox-eyed" <span id="fr_317"></span>[a](#fn_315.md) to signify "large-eyed,"
and "bully" <span id="fr_318"></span>[b](#fn_316.md) for "loudmouthed"?

Or is it rather because the foot of the bull is harmless, but the part
that bears horns is harmful, and thus they call upon the god to come in
a gentle and painless manner?

Or is it because many believe that the god was the pioneer in both
ploughing and sowing?

 

37\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do the people of Tanagra have
before their city an Achilleum, that is, a place bearing this name? For
it is related that Achilles actually had more enmity than friendship for
the city, since he carried off Stratonicê, the mother of Poemander, and
slew Acestor, the son of Ephippus. <span id="fr_319"></span>[c](#fn_317.md)

While the territory of Tanagra was still inhabited in village
communities, Poemander, the father of Ephippus, had been besieged by the
Achaeans in the place called Stephon, because of his unwillingness to
join their expedition. <span id="fr_320"></span>[d](#fn_318.md) But he
abandoned that stronghold by night and fortified Poemandria. <span
id="fr_321"></span>[e](#fn_319.md)

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span> <span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Polycrithus the
master-builder, however, who was present, spoke slightingly of the
fortifications and, in derision, leaped over the moat. Poemander was
enraged and hastened to throw at him a great stone which had been hidden
there from ancient days, set aside for use in the ritual of the
Nyctelia. <span id="fr_322"></span>[a](#fn_320.md) This stone Poemander
snatched up in his ignorance, and hurled. He missed Polycrithus, but
slew his son Leucippus. According to the law, therefore, he had to
depart from Boeotia and become a suppliant at a stranger's hearth. But
this was not easy, since the Achaeans had invaded the territory of
Tanagra. Accordingly he sent his son Ephippus to appeal to Achilles.
Ephippus, by his persuasive words, brought to his father Achilles, as
well as Tlepolemus, the son of Heracles, and Peneleös, the son of
Hippalcmas, all of them interrelated. Poemander was escorted by them to
Chalcis, and there at the house of Elephenor he was purified of the
murder. Therefore he honoured these heroes and set apart sacred
precincts for them all, and of these the precinct of Achilles has still
kept its name.

 

38\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> are the "Psoloeis" and who the
"Oleiae" among the Boeotians?

They relate that the daughters of Minyas, Leucippê and Arsinoê and
Alcathoê, becoming insane, conceived a craving for human flesh, and drew
lots for their children. <span id="fr_323"></span>[b](#fn_321.md) The lot
fell upon Leucippê to contribute her son Hippasus to be torn to pieces,
and their husbands, who put on ill-favoured garments for very grief and
sorrow, were called "Grimy" (*Psoloeis*);

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span> <span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

but the Minyads themselves were called "Oleiae," that is to say,
'Murderesses.' And even to-day the people of Orchomenus give this name
to the women descended from this family; and every year, at the festival
of Agrionia, <span id="fr_324"></span>[a](#fn_322.md) there takes place a
flight and pursuit of them by the priest of Dionysus with sword in hand.
Any one of them that he catches he may kill, and in my time the priest
Zoïlus killed one of them. But this resulted in no benefit for the
people of Orchomenus; but Zoïlus fell sick from some slight sore and,
when the wound had festered for a long time, he died. The people of
Orchomenus also found themselves involved in some suits for damages and
adverse judgements; wherefore they transferred the priesthood from
Zoïlus's family and chose the best man from all the citizens to fill the
office.

 

39\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do the Arcadians stone persons
who voluntarily enter the Lycaeon; but if such persons enter through
ignorance, they send them away to Eleutherae?

Is it because they were released and set free that this story gained
credence, and is the expression "to Free Town" (*Eleutherae*) of the
same sort as "to the land of Sans Souci" and "you will come to the Seat
of Satisfaction"?

Or is it in accordance with the legend, since Eleuther and Lebadus were
the only sons of Lycaon that had no share in the abomination prepared
for Zeus, <span id="fr_325"></span>[b](#fn_323.md) but instead they fled to
Boeotia, and there is community of citizenship between the people of
Lebadeia and the Arcadians, and do they accordingly

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

send away to Eleutherae those who involuntarily enter the inviolate
sanctuary of Zeus?

Or is it as Architimus <span id="fr_326"></span>[a](#fn_324.md) relates in
his *Arcadian History*, that certain men who entered through ignorance
were handed over by the Arcadians to the Phliasians, and by the
Phliasians to the Megarians, and, as they were being conducted from
Megara to Thebes, they were stopped near Eleutherae <span
id="fr_327"></span>[b](#fn_325.md) by rain and thunder and other signs from
heaven? Whence, in fact, some assert that the place acquired the name of
Eleutherae.

The tale, however, that no shadow is cast by a person who enters the
Lycaeon is not true, although it has acquired widespread credence. <span
id="fr_328"></span>[c](#fn_326.md) Is it because the air turns to clouds,
and lowers darkly upon those who enter? Or is it because he that enters
is condemned to death, and the followers of Pythagoras declare that the
spirits of the dead cast no shadow, <span
id="fr_329"></span>[d](#fn_327.md) neither do they blink? Or is it because
it is the sun which causes shadow, but the law deprives him that enters
of the sunlight?

This too they relate allegorically: he that enters is called a "deer."
Wherefore, when Cantharion the Arcadian deserted to the Eleans while
they were at war with the Arcadians, and with his booty crossed the
inviolate sanctuary, even though he fled to Sparta after peace had been
made, the Spartans surrendered him to the Arcadians, since the god
ordered them to give back "the deer."
