*The Roman and Greek Questions*, by Plutarch, tr. Frank Cole Babbitt,
\[1936\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

60-69.

60\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span>, when there are two altars of
Hercules, do women receive no share nor taste of the sacrifices offered
on the larger altar?

Is it because the friends of Carmenta came late for the rites, as did
also the clan of the Pinarii? Wherefore, as they were excluded from the
banquet while the rest were feasting, they acquired the name *Pinarii*
(Starvelings). <span id="fr_138"></span>[d](#fn_138.md) Or is it because of
the fable of Deianeira and the shirt? <span
id="fr_139"></span>[e](#fn_139.md)

 

61\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it forbidden to mention or to
inquire after or to call by name that deity, whether it be male or
female, whose especial province it is to preserve and watch over
Rome? <span id="fr_140"></span>[f](#fn_140.md) This prohibition they
connect with a superstition and relate that Valerius Swamis came to an
evil end because he revealed the name.

Is it because, as certain Roman writers have

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

recorded, there are certain evocations and enchantments affecting the
gods, by which the Romans also believed that certain gods had been
called forth <span id="fr_141"></span>[a](#fn_141.md) from their enemies,
and had come to dwell among themselves, and they were afraid of having
this same thing done to them by others? Accordingly, as the
Tyrians <span id="fr_142"></span>[b](#fn_142.md) are said to have put
chains upon their images, and certain other peoples are said to demand
sureties when they send forth their images for bathing or for some other
rite of purification, so the Romans believed that not to mention and not
to know the name of a god was the safest and surest way of shielding
him.

Or as Homer <span id="fr_143"></span>[c](#fn_143.md) has written,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Earth is yet common to all,</span>

</div>

so that mankind should reverence and honour all the gods, since they
possess the earth in common, even so did the Romans of early times
conceal the identity of the god who was the guardian of their safety,
since they desired that not only this god, but all the gods should be
honoured by the citizens?

 

62\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span>, among those called *Fetiales*,
or, as we should say in Greek, peace-makers or treaty-bringers, was he
who was called *pater patratus* considered the chief? The *pater
patratus* <span id="fr_144"></span>[d](#fn_144.md) is a man whose father is
still alive and who has children; even now he possesses a certain
preferment and confidence, for the praetors entrust to him any wards
whose beauty and youth require a careful and discreet guardianship.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

Is it because there attaches to these men respect for their children and
reverence for their fathers? Or does the name suggest the reason? For
*patratus* means, as it were, "completed" or "perfected," since he to
whose lot it has fallen to become a father while he still has a father
is more perfect than other men.

Or should the man who presides over oaths and treaties of peace be, in
the words of Homer, <span id="fr_145"></span>[a](#fn_145.md) one "looking
before and after"? Such a man above all others would be he that has a
son to plan for and a father to plan with.

63\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is the so-called *rex sacrorum*,
that is to say "king of the sacred rites," forbidden to hold office or
to address the people? <span id="fr_146"></span>[b](#fn_146.md)

Is it because in early times the kings performed the greater part of the
most important rites, and themselves offered the sacrifices with the
assistance of the priests? But when they did not practise moderation,
but were arrogant and oppressive, most of the Greek states took away
their authority, and left to them only the offering of sacrifice to the
gods; but the Romans expelled their kings altogether, and to offer the
sacrifices they appointed another, whom they did not allow to hold
office or to address the people, so that in their sacred rites only they
might seem to be subject to a king, and to tolerate a kingship only on
the gods’ account. <span id="fr_147"></span>[c](#fn_147.md) At any rate,
there is a sacrifice traditionally performed in the forum at the place
called Comitium, and, when the *rex* has performed this, he flees from
the forum as fast as he can. <span id="fr_148"></span>[d](#fn_148.md)

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

64\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> did they not allow the table to
be taken away empty, but insisted that something should be upon
it? <span id="fr_149"></span>[a](#fn_149.md)

Was it that they were symbolizing the necessity of ever allowing some
part of the present provision to remain over for the future, and to-day
to be mindful of to-morrow, or did they think it polite to repress and
restrain the appetite while the means of enjoyment was still at hand?
For persons who have accustomed themselves to refrain from what they
have are less likely to crave for what they have not.

Or does the custom also show a kindly feeling towards the servants? For
they are not so well satisfied with taking as with partaking, since they
believe that they thus in some manner share the table with their
masters. <span id="fr_150"></span>[b](#fn_150.md)

Or should no sacred thing be suffered to be empty, and the table is a
sacred thing?

 

65\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> does the husband approach his
bride for the first time, not with a light, but in darkness?

Is it because he has a feeling of modest respect, since he regards her
as not his own before his union with her? Or is he accustoming himself
to approach even his own wife with modesty?

Or, as Solon <span id="fr_151"></span>[c](#fn_151.md) has given directions
that the bride shall nibble a quince before entering the bridal chamber,
in order that the first greeting may not be disagreeable nor unpleasant,
even so did the Roman legislator, if there was anything abnormal or
disagreeable connected with the body, keep it concealed?

Or is this that is done a manner of casting infamy

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span> <span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

upon unlawful amours, since even lawful love has a certain opprobrium
connected with it?

 

66\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is one of the hippodromes called
Flaminian?

Is it because a certain Flaminius <span id="fr_152"></span>[a](#fn_152.md)
long ago bestowed some land upon the city and they used the revenues for
the horse-races; and, as there was money still remaining, they made a
road, and this they also called Flaminian? <span
id="fr_153"></span>[b](#fn_153.md)

 

67\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they call the rod-bearers
"lictors"? <span id="fr_154"></span>[c](#fn_154.md)

Is it because these officers used both to bind unruly persons and also
to follow in the train of Romulus with straps in their bosoms? Most
Romans use *alligare* for the verb "to bind," but purists, when they
converse, say *ligare*. <span id="fr_155"></span>[d](#fn_155.md)

Or is the *c* but a recent insertion, and were they formerly called
*litores*, that is, a class of public servants? The fact that even to
this day the word "public" is expressed by *leitos* in many of the Greek
laws has escaped the attention of hardly anyone.

 

68\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do the Luperci sacrifice a
dog? <span id="fr_156"></span>[e](#fn_156.md) The Luperci are men who race
through the city on the Lupercalia, lightly clad in loin-cloths,
striking those whom they meet with a strip of leather.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span> <span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

Is it because this performance constitutes a rite of purification of the
city? In fact they call this month February, and indeed this very day,
*februata*; and to strike with a kind of leather thong they call
*februare*, the word meaning "to purify." Nearly all the Greeks used a
dog as the sacrificial victim for ceremonies of purification; and some,
at least, make use of it even to this day. They bring forth for
Hecatê <span id="fr_157"></span>[a](#fn_157.md) puppies along with the
other materials for purification, and rub round about with puppies <span
id="fr_158"></span>[b](#fn_158.md) such persons as are in need of
cleansing, and this kind of purification they call *periskylakismos*
("puppifrication").

Or is it that *lupus* means "wolf" and the Lupercalia is the Wolf
Festival, and that the dog is hostile to the wolf, and for this reason
is sacrificed at the Wolf Festival?

Or is it that the dogs bark at the Luperci and annoy them as they race
about in the city?

Or is it that the sacrifice is made to Pan, and a dog is something dear
to Pan because of his herds of goats?

 

69\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> on the festival called
Septimontium <span id="fr_159"></span>[c](#fn_159.md) were they careful to
refrain from the use of horse-drawn vehicles; and why even to this day
are those who do not contemn ancient customs still careful about this?
The festival Septimontium they observe in commemoration of the addition
to the city of the seventh hill, by which Rome was made a city of seven
hills.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

Is it, as some of the Roman writers conceive, because the city had not
yet been completely joined together in all its parts?

Or has this "nothing to do with Dionysus" <span
id="fr_160"></span>[a](#fn_160.md)? But did they imagine, when their great
task of consolidation had been accomplished, that the city had now
ceased from further extension; and they rested themselves, and gave
respite to the pack-animals, which had helped them in their labours, and
afforded the animals an opportunity to enjoy the general festival with
no work to do?

Or did they wish that the presence of the citizens should adorn and
honour every festival always, and, above all, that one which was held in
commemoration of the consolidation of the city? Wherefore in order that
they might not leave the City, in whose honour the festival was being
held, it was not permitted to make use of vehicles on that day.
