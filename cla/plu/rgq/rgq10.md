*The Roman and Greek Questions*, by Plutarch, tr. Frank Cole Babbitt,
\[1936\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

80-89.

80\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> was it that when they gave a
public banquet for men who had celebrated a triumph, they formally
invited the consuls and then sent word to them requesting them not to
come to the dinner? <span id="fr_185"></span>[c](#fn_185.md)

Was it because it was imperative that the place of honour at table and
an escort home after dinner should be assigned to the man who had
triumphed? But these honours can be given to no one else when the
consuls are present, but only to them.

 

81\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> does not the tribune wear a
garment with the purple border, <span id="fr_186"></span>[d](#fn_186.md)
although the other magistrates wear it?

Is it because he is not a magistrate at all? For tribunes have no
lictors, nor do they transact business

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span> <span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

seated on the curule chair, nor do they enter their office at the
beginning of the year <span id="fr_187"></span>[a](#fn_187.md) as all the
other magistrates do, nor do they cease from their functions when a
dictator is chosen; but although he transfers every other office to
himself, the tribunes alone remain, as not being officials but as
holding some other position. Even as some advocates will not have it
that a demurrer is a suit, but hold that its effect is the opposite of
that of a suit; for a suit brings a case into court and obtains a
judgement, while a demurrer takes it out of court and quashes it; in the
same way they believe that the tribuneship is a check on officialdom and
a position to offer opposition to magistracy rather than a magistracy.
For its authority and power consist in blocking the power of a
magistrate and in the abrogation of excessive authority.

Or one might expound these matters and others like them, if one were to
indulge in the faculty of invention; but since the tribunate derives its
origin from the people, the popular element in it is strong; and of much
importance is the fact that the tribune does not pride himself above the
rest of the people, but conforms in appearance, dress, and manner of
life to ordinary citizens. Pomp and circumstance become the consul and
the praetor; but the tribune, as Gaius Curio used to say, must allow
himself to be trodden upon; he must not be proud of mien, nor difficult
of access nor harsh to the multitude, but indefatigable on behalf of
others and easy for the multitude to deal with. Wherefore it is the
custom that not even the door of his house shall be closed, but it
remains open both night and day as a haven of refuge for such as need
it. The more humble he is

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span> <span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

in outward appearance, the more is he increased in power. They think it
meet that he shall be available for the common need and be accessible to
all, even as an altar; and by the honour paid to him they make his
person holy, sacred, and inviolable. <span
id="fr_188"></span>[a](#fn_188.md) Wherefore if anything happen to him when
he walks abroad in public, it is even customary for him to cleanse and
purify his body as if it had been polluted.

 

82\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> are the rods of the praetors
carried in bundles with axes attached?

Is it because this is a symbolic indication that the temper of the
official should not be too quick or unrestrained? Or does the deliberate
unfastening of the rods, which creates delay and postponement of his fit
of temper, oftentimes cause him to change his mind about the punishment?
Now since some badness is curable, but other badness is past remedy, the
rods correct that which may be amended and the axes cut off the
incorrigible.

 

83\. <span class="smallcaps">When</span> the Romans learned that the
people called Bletonesii, <span id="fr_189"></span>[b](#fn_189.md) a
barbarian tribe, had sacrificed a man to the gods, why did they send for
the tribal rulers with intent to punish them, but, when it was made
plain that they had done thus in accordance with a certain custom, why
did the Romans set them at liberty, but forbid the practice for the
future? Yet they themselves, not many years before, had buried alive two
men and two women, two of them Greeks, two Gauls, in the place called
the Forum Boarium. It certainly

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

seems strange that they themselves should do this, and yet rebuke
barbarians on the ground that they were acting with impiety.

Did they think it impious to sacrifice men to the gods, but necessary to
sacrifice them to the spirits? Or did they believe that men who did this
by tradition and custom were sinning, whereas they themselves did it by
command of the Sibylline books? For the tale is told that a certain
maiden, Helvia, was struck by lightning while she was riding on
horseback, and her horse was found lying stripped of its trappings; and
she herself was naked, for her tunic had been pulled far up as if
purposely; and her shoes, her rings, and her head-dress were scattered
apart here and there, and her open mouth allowed the tongue to protrude.
The soothsayers declared that it was a terrible disgrace for the Vestal
Virgins, that it would be bruited far and wide, and that some wanton
outrage would be found touching the knights also. Thereupon a barbarian
slave of a certain knight gave information against three Vestal Virgins,
Aemilia, Licinia, and Marcia, that they had all been corrupted at about
the same time, and that they had long entertained lovers, one of whom
was Vetutius Barrus, <span id="fr_190"></span>[a](#fn_190.md) the
informer's master. The Vestals, accordingly, were convicted and
punished; but, since the deed was plainly atrocious, it was resolved
that the priests should consult the Sibylline books. They say that
oracles were found foretelling that these events would come to pass for
the bane of the Romans, and enjoining on them that, to avert the
impending disaster, they should offer as a sacrifice to certain

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span> <span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

strange and alien spirits two Greeks and two Gauls, buried alive on the
spot. <span id="fr_191"></span>[a](#fn_191.md)

 

84\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they reckon the beginning of
the day from midnight? <span id="fr_192"></span>[b](#fn_192.md)

Is it because the Roman State was based originally on a military
organization and most of the matters that are of use on campaigns are
taken up beforehand at night? Or did they make sunrise the beginning of
activity, and night the beginning of preparation? For men should be
prepared when they act, and not be making their preparations during the
action, as Myson, <span id="fr_193"></span>[c](#fn_193.md) who was
fashioning a grain-fork in wintertime, is reported to have remarked to
Chilon the Wise.

Or, just as noon is for most people the end of their transaction of
public or serious business, even so did it seem good to make midnight
the beginning? A weighty testimony to this is the fact that a Roman
official does not make treaties or agreements after midday.

Or is it impossible to reckon the beginning and end of the day by sunset
and sunrise? For if we follow the method by which most people formulate
their definitions, by their perceptions, reckoning the first peep of the
sun above the horizon as the beginning of day, and the cutting off of
its last rays as the beginning of night, we shall have no equinox; but
that night which we think is most nearly equal to the day will plainly
be less than that day by the diameter of

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

the sun. <span id="fr_194"></span>[a](#fn_194.md) But then again the remedy
which the mathematicians apply to this anomaly, decreeing that the
instant when the centre of the sun touches the horizon is the boundary
between day and night, is a negation of plain fact; for the result will
be that when there is still much light over the earth and the sun is
shining upon us, we cannot admit that it is day, but must say that it is
already night. Since, therefore, the beginning of day and night is
difficult to determine at the time of the risings and settings of the
sun because of the irrationalities which I have mentioned, there is left
the zenith or the nadir of the sun to reckon as the beginning. The
second is better; for from noon on the sun's course is away from us to
its setting, but from midnight on its course is towards us to its
rising.

 

85\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> in the early days did they not
allow their wives to grind grain or to cook? <span
id="fr_195"></span>[b](#fn_195.md)

Was it in memory of the treaty which they made with the Sabines? For
when they had carried off the Sabines’ daughters, and later, after
warring with the Sabines, had made peace, it was specified among the
other articles of agreement that no Sabine woman should grind grain for
a Roman or cook for him.

 

86\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do men not marry during the
month of May? <span id="fr_196"></span>[c](#fn_196.md)

Is it because this month comes between April and June, of which they
regard April as sacred to Venus and June as sacred to Juno, both of them
divinities of marriage; and so they put the wedding a little earlier or
wait until later?

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span> <span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

Or is it because in this month they hold their most important ceremony
of purification, in which they now throw images from the bridge into the
river, <span id="fr_197"></span>[a](#fn_197.md) but in days of old they
used to throw human beings? Wherefore it is the custom that the
Flaminica, reputed to be consecrate to Juno, shall wear a stern face,
and refrain from bathing and wearing ornaments at this time.

Or is it because many of the Latins make offerings to the departed in
this month? And it is for this reason, perhaps, that they worship
Mercury in this month and that the month derives its name from
Maia. <span id="fr_198"></span>[b](#fn_198.md)

Or is May, as some relate, named after the older (*maior*) and June
after the younger generation (*iunior*)? For youth is better fitted for
marriage, as Euripides <span id="fr_199"></span>[c](#fn_199.md) also says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Old age bids Love to take her leave for aye  
And Aphroditê wearies of the old.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They do not,
therefore, marry in May, but wait for June which comes next after May.

 

87\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they part the hair of brides
with the point of a spear? <span id="fr_200"></span>[d](#fn_200.md)

Does this symbolize the marriage of the first Roman wives <span
id="fr_201"></span>[e](#fn_201.md) by violence with attendant war, or do
the wives thus learn, now that they are mated to brave and warlike men,
to welcome an unaffected, unfeminine, and simple mode of beautification?
Even as Lycurgus, <span id="fr_202"></span>[f](#fn_202.md) by giving orders
to make the

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

doors and roofs of houses with the saw and the axe only, and to use
absolutely no other tool, banished all over-refinement and extravagance.

Or does this procedure hint at the manner of their separation, that with
steel alone can their marriage be dissolved?

Or is it that most of the marriage customs were connected with
Juno? <span id="fr_203"></span>[a](#fn_203.md) Now the spear is commonly
held to be sacred to Juno, and most of her statues represent her leaning
on a spear, and the goddess herself is surnamed *Quiritis*; for the men
of old used to call the spear *curis*; wherefore they further relate
that Enyalius is called Quirinus by the Romans. <span
id="fr_204"></span>[b](#fn_204.md)

 

88\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they call the money expended
upon public spectacles *Lucar*?

Is it because round about the city there are, consecrated to gods, many
groves which they call loci, and they used to spend the revenue from
these on the public spectacles?

 

89\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they call the Quirinalia the
Feast of Fools? <span id="fr_205"></span>[c](#fn_205.md)

Is it because, as Juba <span id="fr_206"></span>[d](#fn_206.md) states,
they apportioned that day to men who did not know their own kith and
kin? <span id="fr_207"></span>[e](#fn_207.md) Or was it granted to those
who, because of some business, or absence from Rome, or ignorance, had
not sacrificed with the rest of their tribe on the Fornacalia, that, on
this day, they might take their due enjoyment of that festival?
