40-49.

40\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> was the hero Eunostus in
Tanagra, and why may no women enter his grove?

Eunostus was the son of Elieus, who was the son of Cephisus, and Scias.
They relate that he acquired his name because he was brought up by the
nymph Eunosta. Handsome and righteous as he was, he was no less virtuous
and ascetic. They say that Ochnê, his cousin, one of the daughters of
Colonus, became enamoured of him; but when Eunostus repulsed her
advances and, after upbraiding her, departed to accuse her to her
brothers, the maiden forestalled him by doing this very thing against
him. She incited her brothers, Echemus, Leon, and Bucolus, to kill
Eunostus, saying that he had consorted with her by force. They,
accordingly, lay in ambush for the young man and slew him. Then Elieus
put them in bonds; but Ochnê repented, and was filled with trepidation
and, wishing to free herself from the torments caused by her love, and
also feeling pity for her brothers, reported the whole truth to Elieus,
and he to Colonus. And when Colonus had given judgement, Ochnê's
brothers were banished, and she threw herself from a precipice, as
Myrtis, <span id="fr_330"></span>[a](#fn_328.md) the lyric poetess of
Anthedon, has related.

But the shrine and the grove of Eunostus were so strictly guarded
against entry and approach by women that, often, when earthquakes or
droughts or other signs from heaven occurred, the people of Tanagra were
wont to search diligently and to be greatly concerned lest any woman
might have approached the place undetected; and some relate, among them
Cleidamus, a man of prominence, that Eunostus met them on his way to the
sea to bathe

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

because a woman had set foot within the sacred precinct. And
Diodes <span id="fr_331"></span>[a](#fn_329.md) also, in his treatise upon
the *Shrines of Heroes*, quotes a decree of the people of Tanagra
concerning the matters which Cleidamus reported.

 

41\. <span class="smallcaps">From</span> what cause was a river in
Boeotia in the vicinity of Eleon called Scamander?

Deïmachus, the son of Eleon and a companion of Heracles, took part in
the expedition against Troy. But since, as it appears, the war was
dragging on, he welcomed to his quarters Glaucia, the daughter of
Scamander, who had fallen in love with him, and got her with child; then
he himself fell in fighting against the Trojans. But Glaucia, fearing
detection, fled for refuge, and told Heracles of her love and of her
association with Deïmachus. And he, both through pity for the woman, and
for joy that the stock of a brave man who was his close friend should
thus survive, took Glaucia on board his fleet; and when she gave birth
to a son, he brought both the child and the mother, and delivered them
to Eleon in Boeotia. The child was named Scamander, and he became the
king of the country; and he named the Inachus river Scamander after
himself, and the stream near by he called Glaucia from his mother. The
spring Acidusa he named after his wife; and from her he had three
daughters whom even to this day they honour under the name of the
"Maidens."

 

42\. <span class="smallcaps">Whence</span> arose the proverbial saying,
"This is valid"?

When Deinon of Tarentum, a brave soldier, was

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span> <span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

general, his fellow-citizens voted to reject a certain proposal of his.
When the herald reported the prevailing majority, he held up his right
hand and said, "But this is stronger." This is Theophrastus's <span
id="fr_332"></span>[a](#fn_330.md) version of the story; but Apollodorus
has a supplementary version, that when the herald of the Tarentines
proclaimed, "These are in the majority," Deinon said, "But these are
better!" and validated the vote of the minority.

 

43\. <span class="smallcaps">For</span> what reason was the city of the
Ithacans called Alalcomenae?

Because Anticleia, while yet a virgin, was violated by Sisyphus and
conceived Odysseus. This is related by several authorities <span
id="fr_333"></span>[b](#fn_331.md); but Ister <span
id="fr_334"></span>[c](#fn_332.md) of Alexandria in his *Commentaries* has
in addition recorded that when Anticlea had been given in marriage to
Laërtes and was being conducted to his home, she gave birth to Odysseus
near the Alalcomenium in Boeotia. And for this reason, as though
referring the name to that of a mother-city, he states that the city in
Ithaca acquired its name.

 

44\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> were the "solitary eaters" in
Aegina?

Of the Aeginetans who were engaged in the war against Troy many perished
in the battles there, but even more were destroyed by the storm on the
return-voyage. So there were but few who survived, and when their
relatives had welcomed them home, and observed that the other citizens
were in mourning and sorrow, they deemed it proper neither to rejoice

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span> <span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

nor to sacrifice to the gods openly; but secretly and separately in
their own houses they received with feasting and good cheer those who
had reached home in safety. They themselves waited upon their fathers
and kinsmen, their brothers and relatives, and no one outside the family
was allowed to enter. It is, then, in imitation of this that they hold a
sacrifice to Poseidon, which is called *thiasoi*, <span
id="fr_335"></span>[a](#fn_333.md) in which they feast by themselves in
silence for sixteen days, and no slave is present. Then, when they have
celebrated the Aphrodisia, they terminate the festival. For this reason
they are called "solitary eaters."

 

45\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that the statue of the
Labrandean Zeus in Caria is fashioned holding an axe, but not a sceptre
or a thunderbolt?

Because when Heracles had slain Hippolytê, together with her other arms
he took her axe and gave it as a present to Omphalê. The Lydian kings
who succeeded Omphalê used to carry it as a part of the sacred regalia,
handing it down one to the other until it came to Candaules. He deemed
it of little worth and gave it to one of his Companions <span
id="fr_336"></span>[b](#fn_334.md) to carry. But when Gyges <span
id="fr_337"></span>[c](#fn_335.md) revolted and was at war with Candaules,
Arselis came from Mylasa with an army as an ally for Gyges and slew both
Candaules and his Companion and brought the axe to Caria together with
the other spoils. He therefore constructed a statue of Zeus and placed
the axe in its hand, and

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span> <span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

called the god Labrandeus; for the Lydians call the axe *labrys*. <span
id="fr_338"></span>[a](#fn_336.md)

 

46\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that the people of Tralles
call vetch "purifier" and make particular use of it for expiations and
purifications?

Is it because the Leleges and Minyae in days of old drove them out and
took possession of their city and their land, and because later the
Trallians returned and prevailed, and as many of the Leleges as had not
been slain nor had fled away, but had been left behind there because of
their destitution and weakness—of these they took no account either of
their life or of their death, and they established a law that any
Trallian who killed a Minyan or a Lelegian should be free from pollution
when he had measured out a bushel of vetch to the relatives of the
murdered man?

 

47\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is there a proverb among the
Eleans "to suffer more terribly than Sambicus"?

The story is told that a certain Sambicus, an Elean, at the head of a
numerous group of confederates, cut many pieces from the bronze votive
statues in Olympia and sold them, and finally he despoiled the shrine of
Artemis the Guardian. This is in Elis and is called the Aristarcheum.
Immediately, then, after this sacrilege, he was caught and tortured for
a year, being interrogated about each of his confederates in turn; and
in this manner he died and the proverb arose from his sufferings.

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

48\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> at Sparta is a shrine of
Odysseus built near the shrine of the daughters of Leucippus?

Erginus, one of the descendants of Diomedes, was persuaded by Temenus to
steal the Palladium from Argos; this he did with the knowledge and help
of Leagrus, who was one of Temenus's friends. But later Leagrus became
incensed at Temenus and removed to Sparta, taking the Palladium with
him. The Spartan kings received it eagerly, and gave it a place near the
shrine of the daughters of Leucippus, and they sent to Delphi to obtain
an oracle concerning its safety and preservation. When the god gave
oracle that one of those who had purloined the Palladium should be made
its guardian, the Spartans constructed there the shrine of Odysseus,
especially since, because of his marriage with Penelopê, <span
id="fr_339"></span>[a](#fn_337.md) they reckoned that this hero had close
relations with their city.

 

49\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it the custom for the women
of Chalcedon, whenever they encounter strange men, and especially
officials, to veil one cheek?

The Chalcedonians were involved in a war against the Bithynians, to
which they were provoked by all kinds of reasons. When Zeipoetes became
king of Bithynia, the Chalcedonians, in full force and with the addition
of Thracian allies, devastated the country with fire and sword. When
Zeipoetes attacked them near the so-called Phalion, they fought badly
through rashness and lack of discipline, and lost over eight thousand
soldiers. It was only because Zeipoetes granted an armistice to please
the Byzantines that they were not completely annihilated at that time.
Since, then, there was a great scarcity of men

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

throughout the city, most of the women were forced to consort with
freedmen and resident aliens. But those women who preferred to have no
husband at all rather than a marriage of this sort, themselves conducted
whatever business they needed to transact with the judges or the
officials, drawing aside one part of the veil that covered their faces.
And the married women, for very shame, followed the example of these,
who, they felt, were better than themselves, and also changed to a
similar custom.
