10-19.

10\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is the "sheep-escaper"?

It is one of the small plants that grow close to the

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span> <span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

ground, whose shoots the grazing animals attack, cutting off the tops
and injuring them and so spoiling the growth. But when these plants grow
up and gain some size and escape injury from the flocks which graze upon
them, then they are called "sheep-escapers." The evidence for this is
Aeschylus. <span id="fr_282"></span>[a](#fn_282.md)

 

11\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> are the "Men repulsed by
slings"?

Men from Eretria used to inhabit the island of Corcyra. But Charicrates
sailed thither from Corinth with an army and defeated them in war; so
the Eretrians embarked in their ships and sailed back home. Their
fellow-citizens, however, having learned of the matter before their
arrival, barred their return to the country and prevented them from
disembarking by showering upon them missiles from slings. Since the
exiles were unable either to persuade or to overcome their
fellow-citizens, who were numerous and inexorable, they sailed to Thrace
and occupied a territory in which, according to tradition, Methon, the
ancestor of Orpheus, had formerly lived. So the Eretrians named their
city Methonê, but they were also named by their neighbours the "Men
repulsed by slings."

 

12\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> was "Charilla" among the
Delphians?

The Delphians celebrate three festivals one after the other which occur
every eight <span id="fr_283"></span>[b](#fn_283.md) years, the first of
which they call Septerion, the second Heroïs, and the third Charilla.

Now the Septerion seems to be a representation of Apollo's fight with
the Python and the flight to Tempê and pursuit that followed the
battle. <span id="fr_284"></span>[b](#fn_283.md) Some indeed

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span> <span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

affirm that Apollo fled because he desired purification as a consequence
of the slaughter he had done, others that he was following the wounded
Python as he fled along the road which we now call the Sacred Way, and
was only a little late for the monster's death; for he overtook him when
he had just died from the effects of the wound and had been buried by
his son, whose name, as they say, was Aix. The Septerion, then, is a
representation of these matters or certain matters of a similar
nature. <span id="fr_285"></span>[a](#fn_284.md)

The greater part of the Heroïs has a secret import which the
Thyiads <span id="fr_286"></span>[b](#fn_285.md) know; but from the
portions of the rites that are performed in public one might conjecture
that it represents the evocation of Semelê.

The story of Charilla which they relate is somewhat as follows: A famine
following a drought oppressed the Delphians, and they came to the palace
of their king with their wives and children and made supplication. The
king gave portions of barley and legumes to the more notable citizens,
for there was not enough for all. But when an orphaned girl, who was
still but a small child, approached him and importuned him, he struck
her with his sandal and cast the sandal in her face. But, although the
girl was poverty-stricken and without protectors, she was not ignoble in
character; and when she had withdrawn, she took off her girdle and
hanged herself. As the famine increased and diseases also were added
thereto, the prophetic priestess gave an oracle to the king that he must
appease Charilla, the maiden who had slain herself. Accordingly, when
they had discovered with some difficulty that this was the name of the
child who had been struck, they performed a certain sacrificial rite
combined with purification,

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span> <span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

which even now they continue to perform every eight years. For the king
sits in state and gives a portion of barley-meal and legumes to
everyone, alien and citizen alike, and a doll-like image of Charilla is
brought thither. When, accordingly, all have received a portion, the
king strikes the image with his sandal. The leader of the Thyiads picks
up the image and bears it to a certain place which is full of chasms;
there they tie a rope round the neck of the image and bury it in the
place where they buried Charilla after she had hanged herself.

 

13\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is the "beggar's meat" among
the Aenianians?

There have been several migrations of the Aenianians. For first, when
they inhabited the region about the Dotian plain, they were expelled by
the Lapiths to Aethicia. <span id="fr_287"></span>[a](#fn_286.md) From
there they proceeded to take possession of the region of Molossia about
the river Auas, from which they received the name Parauaei. After this
they took possession of Cirrha. There, when they had stoned to death
Oenoclus, <span id="fr_288"></span>[a](#fn_286.md) their king, at the
command of the god, they descended to the country about the Inachus,
which was inhabited by Inachians and Achaeans. Since an oracle had
declared that if the Inachians gave away any part of their country, they
should lose it all, and that if the Aenianians received any part of the
land from willing givers, they should gain possession of it, Temon, a
notable man among the Aenianians, donned rags and wallet and came to the
Inachians in the guise of a beggar. In scorn and mockery their king gave
him a clod of earth, which Temon accepted,

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span> <span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

placed within his wallet, and was evidently satisfied with the gift; for
he straightway withdrew without asking for anything more. The Inachian
elders were astonished, but, recalling the oracle, they went to the king
and told him not to make light of the fellow nor to let him get away.
Temon, then, perceiving their intent, hastened his flight and made his
escape after vowing a hecatomb to Apollo.

After this affair the two kings engaged in single combat, and Phemius,
king of the Aenianians, observing the Inachian king, Hyperochus,
advancing to meet him accompanied by a dog, said that Hyperochus was
acting unfairly in bringing on a second combatant. But while Hyperochus
was driving off the dog and had his back turned, Phemius hit him with a
stone and killed him. The Aenianians gained possession of the country,
driving out the Inachians together with the Achaeans, and they revere
that stone as sacred, and sacrifice to it and cover it round about with
the fat of the sacrificial victim; and whenever they pay the hecatomb to
Apollo, they sacrifice a bull to Zeus; and they set aside a select
portion of the flesh for the descendants of Temon, and this they call
the "beggar's meat."

 

14\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> are the "Coliadae" among the
inhabitants of Ithaca and what is the *phagilos*?

After the slaughter of the suitors the relatives of the dead men rose up
against Odysseus; but Neoptolemus was sent for by both parties to act as
arbiter. <span id="fr_289"></span>[a](#fn_287.md) He adjudged that Odysseus
should depart from the country and be exiled for homicide from
Cephallenia, Zacynthus, and Ithaca; and that the

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

companions and the relatives of the suitors should recompense Odysseus
each year for the injuries which they had done to his estate. Odysseus
accordingly departed to Italy; but the recompense he formally
transferred to his son, and ordered the inhabitants of Ithaca to pay it
to him. The recompense consisted of barley, wine, honeycombs, olive-oil,
salt, and beasts for sacrifice that were older than *phagiloi*;
according to Aristotle's <span id="fr_290"></span>[a](#fn_288.md)
statement, a lamb is a *phagilos*. Now Telemachus bestowed freedom upon
Eumaeus and his associates, and incorporated them among the citizens;
and the clan of the Coliadae is descended from Eumaeus, and that of the
Bucolidae from Philoetius. <span id="fr_291"></span>[b](#fn_289.md)

 

15\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is "the wooden dog" among the
Locrians?

Locrus was the son of Physcius, the son of Amphictyon. The son of Locrus
and Cabyê was Opus. His father quarrelled with Opus and taking many of
the citizens with him he went to seek an oracle concerning a colony. The
god told him to found a city where he should chance to be bitten by a
wooden dog, and, as he was crossing to the other sea, he trod upon a
dog-brier. <span id="fr_292"></span>[c](#fn_290.md) Greatly troubled by the
wound, he spent several days there, during which he explored the country
and founded the cities Physcus and Oeantheia and the other cities which
the so-called Ozolian Locrians inhabited.

Some say that the Locrians are called Ozolian because of Nessus; others
say that it is because of the serpent Python, since their bodies were
washed up

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

by the sea and rotted away in the country of the Locrians. But some say
that these men wear fleeces and goatskins and for the most part spend
their time with herds of goats, and thus became evil-smelling. <span
id="fr_293"></span>[a](#fn_291.md) But some, on the contrary, assert that,
since the country has many flowers, it acquired its name from sweet
odour. Among these is also Archytas <span
id="fr_294"></span>[b](#fn_292.md) of Amphissa, for he has written thus:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Lovely Macyna, wreathed with clusters of grapes and
fragrant with perfume.</span>

</div>

 

16\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is it that the Megarians call
*aphabroma*?

When Nisus, from whom Nisaea acquired its name, was king, he took a wife
from Boeotia, Habrotê, daughter of Onchestus, the sister of Megareus, a
woman who, as it appears, was both exceptionally intelligent and
remarkably discreet. When she died, the Megarians mourned her with one
accord, and Nisus, wishing that her memory and her repute should be
established everlastingly, ordered the women of the city to wear the
garment that she used to wear; and because of her he called the garment
*aphabroma*. Even the god seems to have furthered the repute of this
woman, for often, when the Megarian women wished to make a change in
their raiment, he prevented them by an oracle.

 

17\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is the "spear-friend"?

In days of old the Megarid used to be settled in village communities
with the citizens divided into five groups. They were called Heraeïs,
Piraeïs,

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Megareis,
Cynosureis, and Tripodiscioi. Although the Corinthians brought about a
civil war among them, for the Corinthians were ever plotting to get
Megara under their control, none the less, because of their
fair-mindedness, they conducted their wars in a civilized and a
kinsmanly way. For no one did any harm at all to the men working in the
fields, and when anyone was captured, he but needed to pay a certain
specified ransom; this his captors received after they had set him free,
and did not collect it earlier; but he who took a prisoner conducted the
man to his house and, after sharing with him salt and food, sent him
home. He, accordingly, who brought his ransom, was highly regarded and
continued thenceforward to be a friend of his captor; and, as a
consequence of his capture by the spear, he was now called
"spear-friend." But anyone who failed to pay the ransom was held in
disrepute as dishonest and faithless, not only among his enemies, but
also among his fellow-citizens.

 

18\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is "return-interest"? <span
id="fr_295"></span>[a](#fn_293.md)

When the Megarians had expelled Theagenes, <span
id="fr_296"></span>[b](#fn_294.md) their despot, for a short time they were
sober and sensible in their government. But later when the popular
leaders poured a full and heady draught of freedom for them, as
Plato <span id="fr_297"></span>[c](#fn_295.md) says, they were completely
corrupted and, among their shocking acts of misconduct toward the
wealthy, the poor would enter their homes and insist upon being
entertained and banqueted sumptuously. But if they did not receive what
they demanded, they would treat all the household with violence and
insult. Finally they enacted a decree whereby they received back again
the

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

interest which they chanced to have paid to their creditors, calling the
measure "return-interest."

 

19\. <span class="smallcaps">Which</span> is the Anthedon to which the
utterance of the prophetic priestess refers:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Drink wine turbid with lees, since thou dwellest not
in Anthedon,</span>

</div>

for Anthedon in Boeotia is not rich in wine?

In days of old they used to call Calaureia by the name of Eirenê, from
the woman Eirenê who, as legend has it, was born of Poseidon and
Melantheia, the daughter of the Alpheius. But later, when the companions
of Anthus and Hypera settled there, they called the island Anthedonia
and Hypereia. According to Aristotle <span
id="fr_298"></span>[a](#fn_296.md) the oracle ran as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Drink wine turbid with lees, since thou dwellest not
in Anthedon,  
No, nor in Hypera holy; for wine without lees thou didst drink
there.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This, then, is
Aristotle's version. But Mnasigeiton says that Anthus, the brother of
Hypera, disappeared from home while he was still a child, and that
Hypera, while she was wandering about in search of him, came to Pherae
to the house of Acastus, where it chanced that Anthus was the slave
appointed to be cupbearer. While they were feasting the boy recognized
his sister, as he was bearing her cup to her, and said to her softly

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Drink wine turbid with lees, since thou dwellest not
in Anthedon.</span>
