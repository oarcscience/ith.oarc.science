# THE GREEK QUESTIONS

1-9.

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> were the "dusty-feet" and the
"directors" in Epidaurus?

There were one hundred and eighty men who directed the State. From these
they used to elect councillors whom they called "directors." But the
majority of the populace spent their life in the country. They were
called "dusty-feet" <span id="fr_271"></span>[a](#fn_271.md) since, as one
may conjecture, they were recognized by their dust-covered feet whenever
they came down to the city.

 

2\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> was the "woman that rode on a
donkey" at Cumae?

Any woman taken in adultery they used to bring into the market-place and
set her on a certain stone in plain sight of everyone. In like manner
they then proceeded to mount her upon a donkey, and when she had been
led about the circuit of the entire city, she was required again to take
her stand upon the same stone, and for the rest of her life to continue
in disgrace, bearing the name "donkey-rider." After this ceremony they
believed that the stone was unclean and they used ritually to purify it.

The citizens of Cumae had also a certain office called the Guards. The
man who held this office used to watch the prison most of the time, but
he

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span> <span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

came to the nocturnal assemblies of the council and led out the kings by
the hand and kept them out, until by secret ballot the council had
decided on their case, whether they had done wrong or no.

 

3\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> is She that Kindles the Fire
(*hypekkaustria*) <span id="fr_272"></span>[a](#fn_272.md) among the people
of Soli?

This is the name which they give to the priestess of Athena because she
performs certain sacrifices and ceremonies to avert evil.

 

4\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> were the Forgetful Ones
(*Amnemones*) at Cnidus, and who was the Dismisser <span
id="fr_273"></span>[b](#fn_273) (*Aphester*.md)?

They were wont to employ sixty men chosen from the nobles, and appointed
for life, as overseers and preliminary advisers in matters of the
greatest importance. They were called the Forgetful Ones, one might
conjecture, because they could not be held to account for their actions;
unless, indeed, it was because they were men who remembered many
things. <span id="fr_274"></span>[c](#fn_274.md) He who asked them their
opinions was the Dismisser.

 

5\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> are the "good" among the
Arcadians and the Spartans?

When the Spartans had come to terms with the Tegeans, they made a treaty
and set up in common a pillar by the Alpheius. On this, among other
matters, was inscribed: "The Messenians must be expelled from the
country; it shall not be lawful to make men good." <span
id="fr_275"></span>[d](#fn_275.md) Aristotle, <span
id="fr_276"></span>[e](#fn_276.md) then, in explaining this, states that it
means that no one shall be put

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span> <span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

to death because of assistance given to the Spartan party in Tegea.

 

6\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> is "he that selects barley"
(*krilhologos*) among the Opuntians?

For sacrifices of very ancient origin most of the Greeks used to employ
barley, which the citizens offered as first-fruits of the harvest.
Accordingly they called the officer who presided at the sacrifices and
brought these first-fruits the Barley-selector. They had two priests:
one appointed for sacrifices to the gods, the other for sacrifices to
the spirits.

 

7\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> were the "floating clouds "?

They used to call clouds "floating" which particularly threatened rain
and were in constant motion, as Theophrastus has stated in the fourth
book of his Meteorology. The passage reads thus: "Since also these
floating clouds and these compact clouds, which are immovable and very
white in colour, exhibit a certain difference of substance which is
filled neither with water nor with wind."

 

8\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> is the "near-dweller"
(*platioiketas*) among the Boeotians?

This is the name they give in the Aeolian dialect to persons who dwell
in the next house or occupy adjoining property. signifying that they
hold land near at hand. I shall add one phrase from the Edict of the
Guardians of the Law, although there are several more … <span
id="fr_277"></span>[a](#fn_277.md)

 

9\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> is the Consecrator (*hosiōtēr*)
among the Delphians and why do they call one of the months "Bysios"?

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span> <span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

They call the victim that is sacrificed Consecrator whenever an Holy
One <span id="fr_278"></span>[a](#fn_278.md) is appointed. There are five
Holy Ones, who hold office for life; they do a great many things with
the co-operation of the oracle-interpreters and with them take part in
the holy rites, since they are thought to have descended from Deucalion.

The month "Bysios," as many think, is the month of growth (*physios*);
for it begins the spring and during it many plants spring up and come
into bloom. But this is not the truth of the matter, for Delphians do
not use *b* in place of *ph* (as Macedonians do who say "Bilip" and
"balacros" and "Beronicê"), but in place of *p*; thus they naturally say
"broceed" for "proceed" and "bainful" for "painful." Accordingly
"Bysios" is "pysios," the month of oracular inquiry, in which men ask
questions and obtain responses from the god; for this is the legitimate
and traditional procedure. In this month, then, oracles used to be given
and the seventh day of this month they consider the birthday of the
god. <span id="fr_279"></span>[b](#fn_279.md) They call this day the day of
Many Utterances (*Polyphthoös*) not because they then bake cakes
(*phthoïs*), <span id="fr_280"></span>[c](#fn_280.md) but because it is a
day when many inquire of the god and receive many oracles. For only
recently have monthly oracles been given out to inquirers; formerly the
prophetic priestess was wont to give responses but once a year on this
day, as Callisthenes <span id="fr_281"></span>[d](#fn_281.md) and
Anaxandrides have recorded.
