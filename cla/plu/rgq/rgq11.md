90-99.

90\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that, when the sacrifice
to Hercules takes place, they mention by name no other god, and why is a
dog never seen within his enclosure, <span
id="fr_208"></span>[a](#fn_208.md) as Vargo has recorded?

Do they make mention of no other god because they regard Hercules as a
demigod? But, as some <span id="fr_209"></span>[b](#fn_209.md) relate, even
while he was still on earth, Evander erected an altar to him and brought
him sacrifice. And of all animals he contended most with a dog, for it
is a fact that this beast always gave him much trouble, Cerberus, for
instance. And, to crown all, when Oeonus, Licymnius's son, had been
murdered by the sons of Hippocoön <span id="fr_210"></span>[c](#fn_210.md)
because of a dog, Hercules was compelled to engage in battle with them,
and lost many of his friends and his brother Iphicles.

 

91\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> was it not permitted the
patricians to dwell about the Capitoline?

Was it because Marcus Manlius, <span id="fr_211"></span>[d](#fn_211.md)
while he was dwelling there, tried to make himself king? They say that
because of him the house of Manlius was bound by an oath that none of
them should ever bear the name of Marcus.

Or does this fear date from early times? At any rate, although
Publicola <span id="fr_212"></span>[e](#fn_212.md) was a most democratic
man, the nobles did not cease traducing him nor the commoners fearing
him, until he himself razed his house, the situation of which was
thought to be a threat to the Forum.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

92\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they give a chaplet of oak
leaves to the man who has saved the life of a citizen in time of
war? <span id="fr_213"></span>[a](#fn_213.md)

Is it because it is easy to find an abundance of oak leaves everywhere
on a campaign?

Or is it because the chaplet is sacred to Jupiter and Juno, whom they
regard as guardians of the city?

Or is the custom an ancient inheritance from the Arcadians, who have a
certain kinship with the oak? For they are thought to have been the
first men sprung from the earth, even as the oak was the first plant.

 

93\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they make most use of
vultures in augury?

Is it because twelve vultures appeared to Romulus at the time of the
founding of Rome? Or is it because this is the least frequent and
familiar of birds? For it is not easy to find a vulture's nest, but
these birds suddenly swoop down from afar; wherefore the sight of them
is portentous.

Or did they learn this also from Hercules? If Herodorus <span
id="fr_214"></span>[b](#fn_214.md) tells the truth, Hercules delighted in
the appearance of vultures beyond that of all other birds at the
beginning of any undertaking, since he believed that the vulture was the
most righteous of all flesh-eating creatures; for, in the first place,
it touches no living thing, nor does it kill any animate creature, as do
eagles and hawks and the birds that fly by night; but it lives upon that
which has been killed in some other way. Then again, even of these

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

it leaves its own kind untouched; for no one has ever seen a vulture
feeding on a bird, as eagles and hawks do, pursuing and striking their
own kind particularly. And yet, as Aeschylus <span
id="fr_215"></span>[a](#fn_215.md) says,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">How can a bird that feeds on birds be pure?</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And we may say
that it is the most harmless of birds to men, since it neither destroys
any fruit or plant nor injures any domesticated animal. But if, as the
Egyptians fable, the whole species is female, and they conceive by
receiving the breath of the East Wind, even as the trees do by receiving
the West Wind, then it is credible that the signs from them are
altogether unwavering and certain. But in the case of the other birds,
their excitements in the mating season, as well as their abductions,
retreats, and pursuits, have much that is disturbing and unsteady.

 

94\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is the shrine of
Aesculapius <span id="fr_216"></span>[b](#fn_216.md) outside the city?

Is it because they considered it more healthful to spend their time
outside the city than within its walls? In fact the Greeks, as might be
expected, have their shrines of Asclepius situated in places which are
both clean and high.

Or is it because they believe that the god came at their summons from
Epidaurus, and the Epidaurians have their shrine of Asclepius not in the
city, but at some distance?

Or is it because the serpent came out from the trireme into the
island, <span id="fr_217"></span>[c](#fn_217.md) and there disappeared, and
thus they thought that the god himself was indicating to them the site
for building?

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

95\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it the customary rule that
those who are practising holy living must abstain from legumes? <span
id="fr_218"></span>[a](#fn_218.md)

Did they, like the followers of Pythagoras, <span
id="fr_219"></span>[b](#fn_219.md) religiously abstain from beans for the
reasons which are commonly offered, <span
id="fr_220"></span>[c](#fn_220.md) and from vetch and chickpea, because
their names (*lathyros* and *erebinthos*) suggest Lethê and Erebus?

Or is it because they make particular use of legumes for funeral feasts
and invocations of the dead?

Or is it rather because one must keep the body clean and light for
purposes of holy living and lustration? Now legumes are a flatulent food
and produce surplus matter that requires much purgation.

Or is it because the windy and flatulent quality of the food stimulates
desire?

 

96\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they inflict no other
punishment on those of the Holy Maidens <span
id="fr_221"></span>[d](#fn_221.md) who have been seduced, but bury them
alive? <span id="fr_222"></span>[e](#fn_222.md)

Is it because they cremate their dead, and to use fire in the burial of
a woman who had not guarded the holy fire in purity was not right?

Or did they believe it to be against divine ordinance to annihilate a
body that had been consecrated by the greatest of lustral ceremonies, or
to lay hands upon a holy woman? Accordingly they devised that she should
die of herself; they conducted her underground into a chamber built
there, in which had been placed a lighted lamp, a loaf of bread,

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span> <span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

and some milk and water. Thereafter they covered over the top of the
chamber with earth. And yet not even by this manner of avoiding the
guilt have they escaped their superstitious fear, but even to this day
the priests proceed to this place and make offerings to the dead.

 

97\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that after the
chariot-race on the Ides of December <span
id="fr_223"></span>[a](#fn_223.md) the right-hand trace-horse of the
winning team is sacrificed to Mars, and then someone cuts off its tail,
and carries it to the place called Regia and sprinkles its blood on the
altar, while some come down from the street called the Via Sacra, and
some from the Subura, and fight for its head?

Is it, as some <span id="fr_224"></span>[b](#fn_224.md) say, that they
believe Troy to have been taken by means of a horse; and therefore they
punish it, since, forsooth, they are

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Noble scions of Trojans commingled with children of
Latins. <span id="fr_225"></span>[c](#fn_225.md)</span>

</div>

Or is it because the horse is a spirited, warlike, and martial beast,
and they sacrifice to the gods creatures that are particularly pleasing
and appropriate for them; and the winner is sacrificed because Mars is
the specific divinity of victory and prowess?

Or is it rather because the work of the god demands standing firm, and
men that hold their ground defeat those that do not hold it, but flee?
And is swiftness punished as being the coward's resource, and do they
learn symbolically that there is no safety for those who flee?

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

98\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do the censors, when they take
office, do nothing else before they contract for the food of the sacred
geese <span id="fr_226"></span>[a](#fn_226.md) and the polishing of the
statue? <span id="fr_227"></span>[b](#fn_227.md)

Is it that they begin with the most trivial things, matters that require
little expense or trouble? Or is this a commemoration of an old debt of
gratitude owed to these creatures for their services in the Gallic
wars? <span id="fr_228"></span>[c](#fn_228.md) For when in the night the
barbarians were already climbing over the rampart of the Capitol, the
geese perceived the invaders, although the dogs were asleep, and waked
the guards by their clamour.

Or is it because the censors are guardians of the most important
matters, and, since it is their duty to oversee and to busy themselves
with sacred and State affairs and with the lives, morals, and conduct of
the people, they immediately take into account the most vigilant of
creatures, and at the same time by their care of the geese they urge the
citizens not to be careless or indifferent about sacred matters?

But the polishing <span id="fr_229"></span>[d](#fn_229.md) of the statue is
absolutely necessary; for the red pigment, with which they used to tint
ancient statues, rapidly loses its freshness.

 

99\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that, if any one of the
other priests is condemned and exiled, they depose him and elect
another, but the augur, as long as he lives, even if they find him
guilty of the worst offences, they do not

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

deprive of his priesthood? <span id="fr_230"></span>[a](#fn_230.md) They
call "augurs" the men who are in charge of the omens.

Is it, as some say, because they wish no one who is not a priest to know
the secrets of the holy rites?

Or, because the augur is bound by oaths to reveal the sacred matters to
no one, are they unwilling to release him from his oath as would be the
case if he had been reduced to private status?

Or is "augur" a name denoting, not a rank or office, but knowledge and
skill? Then to prevent a soothsayer from being a soothsayer would be
like voting that a musician shall not be a musician, nor a physician a
physician; for they cannot deprive him of his ability, even if they take
away his title. They naturally appoint no successor since they keep the
original number of augurs.
