110-113.

110\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is this priest also forbidden
to touch raw flesh?

Is this custom intended to deter people completely from eating raw meat,
or do they scrupulously repudiate flesh for the same reason as flour?
For neither is it a living creature nor has it yet become a cooked food.
Now boiling or roasting, being a sort of alteration and mutation,
eliminates the previous form; but fresh raw meat does not have a clean
and unsullied appearance, but one that is repulsive, like a fresh wound.

 

111\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> did they bid the priest avoid
the dog and the goat, neither touching them nor naming them?

Did they loathe the goat's lasciviousness and foul odour, or did they
fear its susceptibility to disease? For it is thought to be subject to
epilepsy beyond all other animals, and to infect persons who eat
it <span id="fr_255"></span>[a](#fn_255.md) or touch it when it is
possessed of the disease. The reason, they say, is the narrowness of the
air passages, which are often suddenly contracted; this they deduce from
the thinness of its voice. So also in the case of men, if they chance to
speak during an epileptic fit, the sound they make is very like a bleat.

The dog has, perhaps, less of lasciviousness and foul odour. Some,
however, assert that a dog may not enter either the Athenian
acropolis <span id="fr_256"></span>[b](#fn_256.md) or the island of
Delos <span id="fr_257"></span>[c](#fn_257.md) because of its open mating,
as if cattle and swine and horses mated within the walls of a chamber

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span> <span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

and not openly and without restraint! For these persons are ignorant of
the true reason: because the dog is a belligerent creature they exclude
it from inviolable and holy shrines, thereby offering a safe place of
refuge for suppliants. Accordingly it is likely that the priest of
Jupiter also, since he is, as it were, the animate embodiment and sacred
image of the god, should be left free as a refuge for petitioners and
suppliants, with no one to hinder them or to frighten them away. For
this reason his couch was placed in the vestibule of his house, and
anyone who fell at his knees had immunity from beating or chastisement
all that day; and if any prisoner succeeded in reaching the priest, he
was set free, and his chains they threw outside, not by the doors, but
over the roof. So it would have been of no avail for him to render
himself so gentle and humane, if a dog had stood before him frightening
and keeping away those who had need of a place of refuge.

Nor, in fact, did the men of old think that this animal was wholly pure,
for it was never sacrificed to any of the Olympian gods; and when it is
sent to the cross-roads as a supper for the earth-goddess Hecatê, <span
id="fr_258"></span>[a](#fn_258.md) it has its due portion among sacrifices
that avert and expiate evil. In Sparta they immolate puppies to the
bloodiest of the gods, Enyalius; and in Boeotia the ceremony of public
purification is to pass between the parts of a dog which has been cut in
twain. The Romans themselves, in the month of purification, <span
id="fr_259"></span>[b](#fn_259.md) at the Wolf Festival, which they call
the Lupercalia, sacrifice a dog. Hence it is not out of keeping that
those who have attained to the office of serving the

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span> <span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

highest and purest god should be forbidden to make a dog their familiar
companion and housemate.

 

112\. <span class="smallcaps">For</span> what reason was it forbidden
the priest of Jupiter to touch ivy or to pass along a road overhung by a
vine growing on a tree? <span id="fr_260"></span>[a](#fn_260.md)

Is this second question like the precepts: "Do not eat seated on a
stool," "Do not sit on a peck measure," "Do not step over a broom"? For
the followers of Pythagoras <span id="fr_261"></span>[b](#fn_261.md) did
not really fear these things nor guard against them, but forbade other
things through these. Likewise the walking under a vine had reference to
wine, signifying that it is not right for the priest to get drunk; for
wine is over the heads of drunken men, and they are oppressed and
humbled thereby, when they should be above it and always master this
pleasure, not be mastered by it.

Did they regard the ivy as an unfruitful plant, useless to man, and
feeble, and because of its weakness needing other plants to support it,
but by its shade and the sight of its green fascinating to most people?
And did they therefore think that it should not be uselessly grown in
their homes nor be allowed to twine about in a futile way, contributing
nothing, since it is injurious to the plants forming its support? Or is
it because it cleaves to the ground? <span
id="fr_262"></span>[c](#fn_262.md) Wherefore it is excluded from the ritual
of the Olympian gods, nor can any ivy be seen in the temple of Hera at
Athens, or in the temple of Aphrodite at Thebes; but it has its place in
the Agrionia <span id="fr_263"></span>[d](#fn_263.md) and the
Nyctelia, <span id="fr_264"></span>[e](#fn_264.md) the rites of which are
for the most part performed at night.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

Or was this also a symbolic prohibition of Bacchic revels and orgies?
For women possessed by Bacchic frenzies rush straightway for ivy and
tear it to pieces, clutching it in their hands and biting it with their
teeth; so that not altogether without plausibility are they who assert
that ivy, possessing as it does an exciting and distracting breath of
madness, deranges persons and agitates them, and in general brings on a
wineless drunkenness and joyousness in those that are precariously
disposed towards spiritual exaltation. <span
id="fr_265"></span>[a](#fn_265.md)

 

113\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> were these priests not allowed
to hold office nor to solicit it, yet they have the service of a lictor
and the right to a curule chair as an honour and a consolation for
holding no office? <span id="fr_266"></span>[b](#fn_266.md)

Is this similar to the conditions in some parts of Greece where the
priesthood had a dignity commensurate with that of the kingship, and
they appointed as priests no ordinary men?

Or was it rather that since priests have definite duties, whereas
officials have duties which are irregular and undefined, if the
occasions for these duties happened to coincide, it was impossible for
the same man to be present at both, but oftentimes, when both duties
were pressing, he had to neglect one of them and at one time commit
impiety against the gods, and at another do hurt to his fellow-citizens?

Or did they observe that there is implicit in the government of men no
less constraint than authority, and that the ruler of the people, as
Hippocrates <span id="fr_267"></span>[c](#fn_267.md) said

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

of the physician, must see dreadful things and touch dreadful things and
reap painful emotions of his own from the ills of other men? Did they,
then, think it impious for a man to offer sacrifice to the gods, and to
take the lead in the sacred rites, if he was concerned in pronouncing
judgements and sentences of death upon citizens, and often upon kinsmen
and members of his household, such as fell to the lot of Brutus? <span
