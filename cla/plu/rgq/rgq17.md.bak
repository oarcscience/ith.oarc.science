20-29.

20\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is it that is called in Prienê
"the darkness by the Oak"?

When the Samians and the Prienians were at war with each other, on the
other occasions they suffered injuries and inflicted injuries to a
moderate degree only; but when a great battle took place, the people of
Prienê slew one thousand Samians. Six years later they engaged the
Milesians at a place called the Oak, and lost practically all the best
and the foremost of their citizens. At this time also the sage Bias was
sent on an embassy from Prienê to Samos and won high repute. For the
women of Prienê this was a cruel experience and a pitiable calamity, and
it became established as a curse and an oath in the most important
matters to swear by "the darkness by the Oak," because of the fact that
there their sons, their fathers, and their husbands had been
slaughtered. <span id="fr_299"></span>[a](#fn_297.md)

 

21\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> are they that are called
"burners" among the Cretans?

They relate that the Tyrrhenians who, at the time when they inhabited
Lemnos and Imbros, carried off the daughters and wives of the Athenians
from Brauron, later, when they had been expelled from there, came to
Sparta and consorted with the women of the country even to the begetting
of children. But again, as the result of suspicions and false
accusations, they were forced to leave the Spartan country. With their
children and wives they effected a landing in Crete with Pollis and
Delphus as their leaders. <span id="fr_300"></span>[b](#fn_298.md) There,
while they were fighting

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

the possessors of the island, they suffered many of the men who had been
slain in the battles to lie unburied, because at first they had no
leisure to bury them because of the war and the danger, and later
because they shrank from touching corpses that had been decomposed and
putrefied by the lapse of time. Accordingly Pollis devised certain
honours, privileges, and immunities, and some of these he bestowed on
the priests of the gods, others upon them that buried the dead. These
honours he put in the keeping of the spirits of the underworld in order
that they might continue for ever irrevocable. The one class received
the name of priests, and the other that of "burners."

Then Pollis made a division by lot with Delphus, and they governed
separate and independent states; and, along with other humane provisions
which they enjoyed, they had freedom from the injuries which the other
Cretans are wont to inflict upon one another through stealthy plundering
and pillaging. For to the Tyrrhenian communities they do no injury, nor
do they steal anything from them or dispossess them of anything.

 

22\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is the "Children's Tomb" among
the Chalcidians?

Cothus and Aeclus, the sons of Xuthus, came to Euboea to dwell at a time
when the Aeolians possessed the greater part of the island. It had been
prophesied to Cothus that he should have great success and get the
better of his enemies if he bought the land. When he had landed on the
island with a few men, he encountered little children playing by the
sea. So he joined in their play, and in a kindly spirit showed them many
playthings

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

from foreign lands. But when he saw that the children were desirous of
having them for their own, he refused to give them unless he too should
receive some earth from the children. So they picked up some from the
ground and gave it to Cothus, and then, taking the playthings, departed.
But the Aeolians discovered what had happened, and, when their enemies
sailed against them, they made away with the children under stress of
anger and grief. The children were buried beside the road which leads
from the city to the Euripus, and the place is called the Children's
Tomb.

 

23\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> is the "Associate-founder"
(*mixarchagetas*) at Argos, and who are the "Averters" (*elasioi*)?

They call Castor the Associate-founder, and think that he is buried in
Argive territory, but Polydeuces they reverence as one of the Olympians.
Persons who have the reputed ability to turn away attacks of epilepsy
they call Averters, and these are thought to be of the descendants of
Alexida, the daughter of Amphiaraüs.

 

24\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is that which is called an
*enknisma* (a roast) among the Argives? <span
id="fr_301"></span>[a](#fn_299.md)

It is the custom for those who have lost a relative or an intimate
friend to sacrifice to Apollo <span id="fr_302"></span>[b](#fn_300.md)
immediately after the mourning, and again thirty days later to Hermes.
For they believe that, just as the earth receives the bodies of the
dead, even so Hermes receives their souls. They give barley to the
priest of Apollo and receive some meat of the sacrificial

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span> <span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

victim; and when they have put out their fire, since they believe it to
be polluted, and have relighted it from the hearth of others, they
proceed to roast this flesh which they call *enknisma*.

 

25\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is an *alastor*, an
*aliterios*, a *palamnaeos*?

We certainly must not believe those who say that persons who, during a
famine, set a watch upon the miller and plunder him are called
*aliterioi*. <span id="fr_303"></span>[a](#fn_301.md) But he who has done
unforgettable (*alesta*) things, <span id="fr_304"></span>[b](#fn_302.md)
things that will be remembered for a long time, is called *alastor*; and
he whom it were well to avoid (*aleuasthai*) and to guard against
because of his wickedness is called *aliterios*. These things, according
to the statement of Socrates, <span id="fr_305"></span>[c](#fn_303.md) they
have written on tablets of bronze.

 

26\. <span class="smallcaps">What</span> is the intent of the custom by
which the maidens who serve as an escort for the men who lead the bull
from Aenis to Cassiopaea chant until they reach the boundary,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Never may ye return to the well-loved soil of your
homeland? <span id="fr_306"></span>[d](#fn_304.md)</span>

</div>

When the Aenianians had been driven out of their country by the
Lapiths, <span id="fr_307"></span>[e](#fn_305.md) they dwelt first of all
about Aethicia, and later about Molossia and Cassiopaea. But, since they
had no benefit from the country, and, in addition, had to deal with
ungentle peoples on their borders, they came to the Cirrhaean plain
under the leadership of Oenoclus, their king. But great droughts befell
them there, and, as it is related, in accordance with an oracle they
stoned

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span> <span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Oenoclus. <span
id="fr_308"></span>[a](#fn_306.md) Then they wandered on and came to this
country which they now possess, a goodly country, productive of all
manner of crops; wherefore it is with good reason that they pray to the
gods that they may not return again to their ancient fatherland, but may
remain here in prosperity.

 

27\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that among the Rhodians a
herald does not enter the shrine of the hero Ocridion?

Is it because Ochimus affianced his daughter Cydippê to Ocridion? But
Cercaphus, who was the brother of Ochimus, was in love with the maiden
and persuaded the herald (for it used to be the custom to use heralds to
fetch the brides), when he should receive Cydippê, to bring her to him.
When this had been accomplished, Cercaphus fled with the maiden; but
later, when Ochimus had grown old, Cercaphus returned to his home again.
But the custom became established among the Rhodians that a herald
should not approach the shrine of Ocridion because of the wrong that had
been done.

 

28\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that among the inhabitants
of Tenedos a flute-player may not enter the shrine of Tenes, nor may
anyone mention Achilles' name within the shrine?

Is it that, when Tenes’ stepmother <span id="fr_309"></span>[b](#fn_307.md)
falsely accused him of wishing to lie with her, Molpus the flute-player
bore false witness against him, and because of this it came about that
Tenes had to flee to Tenedos with his sister? But as for Achilles, it is
said that his mother Thetis straitly forbade him to kill Tenes, since

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span> <span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Tenes was honoured
by Apollo; and she commissioned one of the servants to be on guard, and
to remind Achilles lest he should unwittingly slay Tenes. But when
Achilles was overrunning Tenedos and was pursuing Tenes’ sister, who was
a beautiful maiden, Tenes met him and defended his sister; and she
escaped, though Tenes was slain. When he had fallen, Achilles recognized
him, and slew the servant because he had, although present, not reminded
him; and he buried Tenes where his shrine now stands and neither does a
flute-player enter it nor is Achilles mentioned there by name.

 

29\. <span class="smallcaps">Who</span> is the "Seller" among the
Epidamnians?

The Epidamnians were neighbours of the Illyrians and perceived that such
of their citizens as associated with the Illyrians were becoming
corrupted; and, since they feared a revolution, they used to select one
of the most reputable of their fellow-citizens each year to conduct such
commercial dealings and barters. This man visited the barbarians and
provided them with a market and an opportunity for all the citizens to
display what they had to sell: thus he was called the "Seller."
