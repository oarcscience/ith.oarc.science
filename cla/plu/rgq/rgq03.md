------------------------------------------------------------------------

10-19.

10\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that when they worship the
gods, they cover their heads, but when they meet any of their fellow-men
worthy of honour, if they happen to have the toga over the head, they
uncover? <span id="fr_17"></span>[a](#fn_17.md)

This second fact seems to intensify the difficulty of the first. If,
then, the tale told of Aeneas <span id="fr_18"></span>[b](#fn_18.md) is
true, that, when Diomedes passed by, he covered his head and completed
the sacrifice, it is reasonable and consistent with the covering of
one's head in the presence of an enemy that men who meet good

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

men and their friends should uncover. In fact, the behaviour in regard
to the gods is not properly related to this custom, but accidentally
resembles it; and its observance has persisted since the days of Aeneas.

But if there is anything else to be said, consider whether it be not
true that there is only one matter that needs investigation: why men
cover their heads when they worship the gods; and the other follows from
this. For they uncover their heads in the presence of men more
influential than they: it is not to invest these men with additional
honour, but rather to avert from them the jealousy of the gods, that
these men may not seem to demand the same honours as the gods, nor to
tolerate an attention like that bestowed on the gods, nor to rejoice
therein. But they thus worshipped the gods, either humbling themselves
by concealing the head, or rather by pulling the toga over their ears as
a precaution lest any ill-omened and baleful sound from without should
reach them while they were praying. That they were mightily vigilant in
this matter is obvious from the fact that when they went forth for
purposes of divination, they surrounded themselves with the clashing of
bronze.

Or, as Castor <span id="fr_19"></span>[a](#fn_19.md) states when he is
trying to bring Roman customs into relation with Pythagorean doctrines:
the Spirit within us entreats and supplicates the gods without, and thus
he symbolizes by the covering of the head the covering and concealment
of the soul by the body.

 

11\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they sacrifice to Saturn with
the head uncovered?

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

Is it because Aeneas instituted the custom of covering the head, and the
sacrifice to Saturn dates from long before that time?

Or is it that they cover the head before the heavenly deities, but they
consider Saturn a god whose realm is beneath the earth? Or is it that no
part of Truth is covered or overshadowed, and the Romans consider Saturn
father of Truth?

 

12\. <span class="smallcaps">And</span> why do they consider Saturn
father of Truth?

Is it that they think, as do certain philosophers, <span
id="fr_20"></span>[a](#fn_20) that Saturn (Kronos) is Time (Chronos.md),
and Time discovers the truth? Or because it is likely that the fabled
Age of Saturn, if it was an age of the greatest righteousness,
participated most largely in truth?

 

13\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they also sacrifice to the
god called "Honor" with the head uncovered? One might translate Honor as
"renown" or "honour."

Is it because renown is a brilliant thing, conspicuous, and widespread,
and for the reason that they uncover in the presence of good and
honoured men, is it for this same reason that they also worship the god
who is named for "honour"?

 

14\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do sons cover their heads when
they escort their parents to the grave, while daughters go with
uncovered heads and hair unbound?

Is it because fathers should be honoured as gods

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

by their male offspring, but mourned as dead by their daughters, that
custom has assigned to each sex its proper part and has produced a
fitting result from both?

Or is it that the unusual is proper in mourning, and it is more usual
for women to go forth in public with their heads covered and men with
their heads uncovered? So in Greece, whenever any misfortune comes, the
women cut off their hair and the men let it grow, for it is usual for
men to have their hair cut and for women to let it grow.

Or is it that it has become customary for sons to cover their heads for
the reason already given? <span id="fr_21"></span>[a](#fn_21.md) For they
turn about at the graves, as Varro relates, thus honouring the tombs of
their fathers even as they do the shrines of the gods; and when they
have cremated their parents, they declare that the dead person has
become a god at the moment when first they find a bone. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[b](#fn_22.md)

But formerly women were not allowed to cover the head at all. At least
it is recorded that Spurius Carvilius <span
id="fr_23"></span>[c](#fn_23.md) was the first man to divorce his wife and
the reason was her barrenness; the second was Sulpicius Gallus, because
he saw his wife pull her cloak over her head; and the third was Publius
Sempronius, because his wife had been present as a spectator at funeral
games. <span id="fr_24"></span>[d](#fn_24.md)

 

15\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that they were wont to
sacrifice no living creature to Terminus, <span
id="fr_25"></span>[e](#fn_25.md) in whose honour they held the Terminalia,
although they regard him as a god?

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

Is it that Romulus placed no boundary-stones for his country, so that
Romans might go forth, seize land, and regard all as theirs, as the
Spartan said, <span id="fr_26"></span>[a](#fn_26.md) which their spears
could reach; whereas Numa Pompilius, <span id="fr_27"></span>[b](#fn_27.md)
a just man and a statesman, who had become versed in philosophy, marked
out the boundaries between Rome and her neighbours, and, when on the
boundary-stones he had formally installed Terminus as overseer and
guardian of friendship and peace, he thought that Terminus should be
kept pure and undefiled from blood and gore?

 

16\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that it is forbidden to
slave-women to set foot in the shrine of Matuta, and why do the women
bring in one slave-woman only and slap her on the head and beat
her? <span id="fr_28"></span>[c](#fn_28.md)

Is the beating of this slave but a symbol of the prohibition, and do
they prevent the others from entering because of the legend? For
Ino <span id="fr_29"></span>[d](#fn_29.md) is said to have become madly
jealous of a slave-woman on her husband's account, and to have vented
her madness on her son. The Greeks relate that the slave was an Aetolian
by birth and that her name was Antiphera. Wherefore also in my native
town, Chaeroneia, the temple-guardian stands before the precinct of
Leucothea and, taking a whip in his hand, makes proclamation: "Let no
slave enter, nor any Aetolian, man or woman!"

 

17\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that in the shrine of this
goddess they do not pray for blessings on their own children, but only
on their sisters’ children? <span id="fr_30"></span>[e](#fn_30.md)

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

Is it because Ino was fond of her sister and suckled her sister's son
also, but was herself unfortunate in her own children? Or is it that,
quite apart from this reason, the custom is morally excellent and
produces much goodwill among kindred?

 

18\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> was it the custom for many of
the wealthy to give a tithe of their property to Hercules? <span
id="fr_31"></span>[a](#fn_31.md)

Is it because he also sacrificed a tithe of Geryon's cattle in Rome? Or
because he freed the Romans from paying a tithe to the Etruscans?

Or have these tales no historical foundation worthy of credence, but the
Romans were wont to sacrifice lavishly and abundantly to Hercules as to
an insatiable eater and a good trencher-man?

Or was it rather in curtailing their excessive wealth, since it was
odious to their fellow-citizens, and in doing away with some of it, as
from a lusty bodily vigour that had reached its culmination, <span
id="fr_32"></span>[b](#fn_32.md) did they think that thus Hercules would be
especially honoured and pleased by such a way of using up and reducing
overabundance, since in his own life he was frugal, self-sufficient, and
free from extravagance?

 

19\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they adopt the month of
January as the beginning of the new year? <span
id="fr_33"></span>[c](#fn_33.md)

The fact is that, in ancient days, March was counted before January, as
is clear from many different proofs, and particularly from the fact that
the fifth month from March is called Quintilis, the sixth Sextilis, and

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span> <span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

so on to the last, which they call December, since it is the tenth in
order from March. Wherefore it has also naturally occurred to some to
believe and to maintain that the ancient Romans completed their year,
not in twelve months, but in ten, by adding more days than thirty to
some of the months. Others state that December is the tenth from March,
January the eleventh, and February the twelfth; and in this month they
perform rites of purification and make offerings to the dead, since it
is the end of the year. But the order of these months was altered, so
they say, and January was put first because in this month on the day of
the new moon, which they call the Kalends of January, the first consuls
entered office after the kings had been expelled.

But more worthy of credence are they who maintain that it was because
Romulus was a warrior and a lover of battle, and was thought to be a son
of Mars, that he placed first the month which bore Mars’ name. But Numa,
in turn, who was a lover of peace, and whose ambition it was to turn the
city towards husbandry and to divert it from war, gave the precedence to
January and advanced the god Janus to great honours, since Janus <span
id="fr_34"></span>[a](#fn_34.md) was a statesman and a husbandman rather
than a warrior. But consider whether Numa may not have adopted as the
beginning of the year that which conforms to our conception of the
natural beginning. Speaking generally, to be sure, there is not
naturally either last or first in a cycle; and it is by custom that some
adopt one beginning of this period and others another. They do best,
however, who adopt the beginning

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

after the winter solstice, when the sun has ceased to advance, and turns
about and retraces his course toward us. For this beginning of the year
is in a certain way natural to mankind, since it increases the amount of
light that we receive and decreases the amount of darkness, and brings
nearer to us the lord and leader of all mobile matter.
