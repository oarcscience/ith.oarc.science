*The Roman and Greek Questions*, by Plutarch, tr. Frank Cole Babbitt,
\[1936\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

30-39.

30\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they, as they conduct the
bride to her home, bid her say, "Where you are Gaius, there am I
Gaia" <span id="fr_68"></span>[a](#fn_68.md)?

Is her entrance into the house upon fixed terms, as it were, at once to
share everything and to control jointly the household, and is the
meaning, then, "Wherever you are lord and master, there am I lady and
mistress"? These names are in common use also in other connexions, just
as jurists speak of Gaius Seius and Lucius Titius, <span
id="fr_69"></span>[b](#fn_69.md) and philosophers of Dion and Theon. <span
id="fr_70"></span>[c](#fn_70.md)

Or do they use these names because of Gaia Caecilia, <span
id="fr_71"></span>[d](#fn_71.md) consort of one of Tarquin's sons, a fair
and virtuous woman, whose statue in bronze stands in the temple of
Sanctus? <span id="fr_72"></span>[e](#fn_72.md) And both her sandals and
her spindle were, in ancient days, dedicated there as tokens of her love
of home and of her industry respectively.

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

31\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is the far-famed
"Talassio" <span id="fr_73"></span>[a](#fn_73.md) sung at the marriage
ceremony? <span id="fr_74"></span>[b](#fn_74.md)

Is it derived from *talasia* (spinning)? For they call the wool-basket
(*talaros*) *talasus*. When they lead in the bride, they spread a fleece
beneath her; she herself brings with her a distaff and her spindle, and
wreaths her husband's door with wool.

Or is the statement of the historians true? They relate that there was a
certain young man, brilliant in military achievements and valuable in
other ways, whose name was Talasius; and when the Romans were carrying
off the daughters of the Sabines who had come to see the games, a maiden
of particularly beautiful appearance was being carried off for him by
some plebeian retainers of his. To protect their enterprise and to
prevent anyone from approaching and trying to wrest the maiden from
them, they shouted continually that she was being brought as a wife for
Talasius (*Talasio*). Since, therefore, everyone honoured Talasius, they
followed along and provided escort, joining in the good wishes and
acclamations. Wherefore since Talasius's marriage was happy, they became
accustomed to invoke Talasius in other marriages also, even as the
Greeks invoke Hymen.

 

32\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that in the month of May
at the time of. the full moon they throw into the river from the Pons
Sublicius figures of men, calling the images thrown Argives? <span
id="fr_75"></span>[c](#fn_75.md)

Is it because in ancient days the barbarians who

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

lived in these parts used to destroy thus the Greeks whom they captured?
But Hercules, who was much admired by them, put an end to their murder
of strangers and taught them to throw figures into the river, in
imitation of their superstitious custom. The men of old used to call all
Greeks alike Argives; unless it be, indeed, since the Arcadians regarded
the Argives also as their enemies because of their immediate proximity,
that, when Evander and his men <span id="fr_76"></span>[a](#fn_76.md) fled
from Greece and settled here, they continued to preserve their ancient
feud and enmity.

 

33\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> in ancient days did they never
dine out without their sons, even when these were still but children?

Did Lycurgus introduce this custom also, and bring boys to the common
meals that they might become accustomed to conduct themselves toward
their pleasures, not in a brutish or disorderly way, but with
discretion, since they had their elders as supervisors and spectators,
as it were? No less important is the fact that the fathers themselves
would also be more decorous and prudent in the presence of their sons;
for "where the old are shameless," as Plato <span
id="fr_77"></span>[b](#fn_77.md) remarks, "there the young also must needs
be lost to all sense of shame."

34\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that while the other
Romans make libations and offerings to the dead in the month of
February, Decimus Brutus, as Cicero <span id="fr_78"></span>[c](#fn_78.md)
has recorded, used to do so in the month of December? This was

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

the Brutus who invaded Lusitania, and was the first to visit those
remote places, and cross the river Lethê with an army. <span
id="fr_79"></span>[a](#fn_79.md)

Since most peoples are accustomed to make offerings to the dead at the
close of the day and at the end of the month, is it not reasonable also
to honour the dead in the last month <span id="fr_80"></span>[b](#fn_80.md)
at the turn of the year? And December is the last month.

Or do these honours belong to deities beneath the earth, and is it the
proper season to honour these deities when all the crops have attained
consummation?

Or is it most fitting to remember those below when men are stirring the
earth at the beginning of seed-time?

Or is it because this month has been consecrated to Saturn by the
Romans, and they regard Saturn as an infernal, not a celestial god?

Or is it that then their greatest festival, the Saturnalia, is set; and
it is reputed to contain the most numerous social gatherings and
enjoyments, and therefore Brutus deemed it proper to bestow upon the
dead first-fruits, as it were, of this festival also?

Or is this statement, that Brutus alone sacrificed to the dead in this
month, altogether a falsehood? For it is in December that they make
offerings to Larentia and bring libations to her sepulchre.

 

35\. <span class="smallcaps">And</span> why do they thus honour Larentia
who was at one time a courtesan?

They record that there was another Larentia, Acca, <span
id="fr_81"></span>[c](#fn_81.md) the nurse of Romulus, whom they honour in

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

the month of April. But they say that the surname of the courtesan
Larentia was Fabula. She became famous for the following reason <span
id="fr_82"></span>[a](#fn_82.md): a certain keeper of the temple of
Hercules enjoyed, it seems, considerable leisure and had the habit of
spending the greater part of the day at draughts and dice; and one day,
as it chanced, there was present no one of those who were wont to play
with him and share the occupation of his leisure. So, in his boredom, he
challenged the god to throw dice with him on fixed terms, as it were: if
he should win, he was to obtain some service from the god; but if he
should lose, he was to furnish a supper for the god at his own expense
and provide a comely girl to spend the night with him. Thereupon he
brought out the dice, and threw once for himself and once for the god,
and lost. Abiding, therefore, by the terms of his challenge he prepared
a somewhat sumptuous repast for the god and fetched Larentia, who openly
practised the profession of courtesan. He feasted her, put her to bed in
the temple, and, when he departed, locked the doors. The tale is told
that the god visited her in the night, not in mortal wise, and bade her
on the morrow go into the forum, and pay particular attention to the
first man she met, and make him her friend. Larentia arose, therefore,
and, going forth, met one of the wealthy men that were unwed and past
their prime, whose name was Tarrutius. With this man she became
acquainted, and while he lived she presided over his household, and when
he died, she inherited his estate; and later, when she herself

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span> <span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

died, she left her property to the State; and for that reason she has
these honours.

 

36\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they call one of the gates
the Window, for this is what *fenestra* means; and why is the so-called
Chamber of Fortune beside it? <span id="fr_83"></span>[a](#fn_83.md)

Is it because King Servius, the luckiest of mortals, was reputed to have
converse with Fortune, who visited him through a window?

Or is this but a fable, and is the true reason that when King Tarquinius
Priscus died, his wife Tanaquil, a sensible and a queenly woman, put her
head out of a window and, addressing the citizens, persuaded them to
appoint Servius king, and thus the place came to have this name? <span
id="fr_84"></span>[b](#fn_84.md)

 

37\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that of all the things
dedicated to the gods it is the custom to allow only spoils of war to
disintegrate with the passage of time, and not to move them
beforehand <span id="fr_85"></span>[c](#fn_85.md) nor repair them?

Is it in order that men may believe that their repute deserts them at
the same time with the obliteration of their early memorials, and may
ever seek to bring in some fresh reminder of valour?

Or is it rather that, as time makes dim the memorials of their
dissension with their enemies, it would be invidious and malicious to
restore and renew them? Nor among the Greeks, either, do

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

they that first erected a trophy of stone or of bronze <span
id="fr_86"></span>[a](#fn_86.md) stand in good repute.

 

38\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> did Quintus Metellus, <span
id="fr_87"></span>[b](#fn_87.md) when he became *pontifex maximus*, with
his reputation for good sense in all other matters as well as in his
statesmanship, prevent divination from birds after the month Sextilis,
which is now called August?

Is it that, even as we attend to such matters in the middle of the day
or at dawn, or in the beginning of the month when the moon is waxing,
and avoid the declining days and hours as unsuitable for business, so
likewise did Metellus regard the period of time after the first eight
months as the evening or late afternoon, so to speak, of the year, since
then it is declining and waning?

Or is it because we should observe birds when they are in their prime
and in perfect condition? And this they are before the summer-time; but
towards autumn some are weak and sickly, others but nestlings and not
full-grown, and still others have vanished completely, migrating because
of the time of year.

 

39\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> were men who were not regularly
enlisted, but merely tarrying in the camp, not allowed to throw missiles
at the enemy or to wound them?

This fact Cato the Elder <span id="fr_88"></span>[c](#fn_88.md) has made
clear in one of his letters to his son, in which he bids the young man
to return home if he has completed his term of service and has been
discharged; or, if he should

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

stay over, to obtain permission from his general to wound or slay an
enemy.

Is it because sheer necessity alone constitutes a warrant to kill a
human being, and he who does so illegally and without the word of
command is a murderer? For this reason Cyrus also praised
Chrysantas <span id="fr_89"></span>[a](#fn_89.md) who, when he was about to
kill an enemy, and had his weapon raised to strike, heard the recall
sounded and let the man go without striking him, believing that he was
now prevented from so doing.

Or must he who grapples with the enemy and fights not be free from
accountability nor go unscathed should he play the coward? For he does
not help so much by hitting or wounding an enemy as he does harm by
fleeing or retreating. He, therefore, who has been discharged from
service is freed from military regulations; but he who asks leave to
perform the offices of a soldier renders himself again accountable to
the regulations and to his general.
