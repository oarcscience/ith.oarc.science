# THE ROMAN QUESTIONS

### INTRODUCTION

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> *Roman Questions* is an attempt to
explain one hundred and thirteen Roman customs, the majority of which
deal with religious matters. The treatise is one of three similar
compilations of which two have been preserved and one, the *Quaestiones
Barbaricae* (No. 139 in Lamprias's list), has been lost. Plutarch
possessed a great desire to know the reason why: besides the many
discussions of a similar sort contained in the *Symposiacs* (*Table
Talk*), there is extant a discussion of *Physical Causes*, and the
titles of other writings of the same sort have been preserved for us in
Lamprias's list of Plutarch's writings. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[a](#fn_0.md)

The Greek title, which means "causes", is twice mentioned by Plutarch
himself in the *Lives*, <span id="fr_1"></span>[b](#fn_1.md) and we might
call it "The Reasons Why." In nearly every case at least two and often
more reasons are given; of these presumably not more than one can be
right. Thus the other explanations will embody the results of Plutarch's
researches on the matter or his own quaint speculations. Consequently
the book, which is an important source for Roman

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

customs, especially for religious customs, has been of the greatest
service to students of early Roman religion, a field in which so little
is certain and which provides (even as it provided for Plutarch) such
glorious opportunities for speculation that it has been somewhat
overtilled in recent years. Anyone interested in such matters may
observe the trend of this scholarship if he will examine F. B. Jevons’
reprint of Holland's translation of the *Roman Questions* (London,
1892); or better, H. J. Rose, *The Roman Questions of Plutarch, a New
Translation with Introductory Essays and a Running Commentary* (Oxford,
1924). Professor Rose might, indeed, have improved his translation by
consulting some good Greek lexicon; but the essays and the commentary
are very valuable, for they contain, among other matters of interest, a
discussion of Plutarch's sources and of early Roman religion; the
commentary is fortified with abundant references to ancient writers and
to modern scholars. It is a scholarly work and the most important
contribution to the study of the *Roman Questions* since Wyttenbach.

This treatise could hardly have been written by a person ignorant of
Latin. Plutarch in his *Life of Demosthenes*, chap. ii., modestly
disavows any profound knowledge of Latin; yet he had read a considerable
amount in the language and had spent some time in Rome. Hence he was
quite able to use Latin works in compiling the *Roman Questions*. Some
Roman writers he mentions by name, especially Varro, and Verrius
Flaccus, an antiquarian of the Augustan age. Livy is specifically cited
but twice in the *Moralia*, once in the present work and once in *De
Fortuna Romanorum;* yet he is referred

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

to no less than twelve times in the Lives, most of these citations being
in the Marcellus and the Camillus. Perhaps Plutarch's more exact
acquaintance with Livy, if lie ever acquired this, dates from a time
later than the period during which he was engaged in the compilation of
the Roman Questions.

Other Roman authorities are mentioned occasionally, such as Cato the
Elder, Nigidius Figulus, Antistius Labeo, Ateius Capito, and Fenestella;
but no doubt they and others are used in accounts introduced by such
expressions as "they say," "some say," "the story is told," and the
like. Some of these references have, in fact, been traced by scholars to
their originals. It has been remarked of Cicero that any statement found
in that author's works appears, or has appeared, elsewhere. The same
affirmation might be made of Plutarch with some confidence. Unless he
specifically testifies to oral tradition or hearsay, we may be certain
that his facts, like Cicero's, are drawn from his extensive reading.

Critics lay stress on a few mistakes which Plutarch made in interpreting
Latin (these will be found noted in Rose and in Hartman), but against
them must be set the unnumbered instances in which he is right. He did
not, however, have to depend wholly on Latin writers, for he undoubtedly
had at hand the *Roman Antiquities* of Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1st
cent. <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>) and the works of Juba, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[a](#fn_2.md) the scholarly king of Mauretania, who as a
youth had been brought to Rome in 46 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>
to grace the triumph of Julius Caesar. Juba became greatly interested in
Roman

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

customs, and wrote a book in which he paralleled them with the customs
of other peoples.

Many of the matters discussed in the *Roman Questions* are to be found
treated elsewhere in Plutarch's work, particularly in the Roman *Lives*.
The Lives of *Romulus* and of *Numa* are especially rich in parallel
passages; for very many of the Roman customs were thought to go back to
the earliest period of Roman history.

The book was probably published after the death of Domitian in <span
class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 96, though this is a not quite certain
inference from the text (276 <span class="smallcaps">E</span>). The work
is No. 138 in Lamprias's catalogue of Plutarch's works. The <span
class="smallcaps">MS</span>. tradition (on which see J. B. Titchener,
*University of Illinois Studies*, ix., 1924) is good.
