*The Roman and Greek Questions*, by Plutarch, tr. Frank Cole Babbitt,
\[1936\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

70-79.

70\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they call such persons as
stand convicted of theft or of any other servile offences
*furciferi*? <span id="fr_161"></span>[b](#fn_161.md)

Is this also evidence of the carefulness of the men of old? For anyone
who had found guilty of some knavery a slave reared in his own household
used to command him to take up the forked stick, which they put under
their carts, and to proceed through the community or the neighbourhood,
observed of all observers, that they might distrust him and be on their
guard against him in the future. This stick we call a prop, and the
Romans *furca* ("fork");

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

wherefore also he who has borne it about is called *furcifer*
("fork-bearer").

 

71\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they tie hay to one horn of
vicious bulls to warn anyone who meets them to be on guard?

Is it because bulls, horses, asses, men, all wax wanton through stuffing
and gorging? So Sophocles <span id="fr_162"></span>[a](#fn_162.md) has
somewhere written,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You prance, as does a colt, from glut of food,  
For both your belly and your cheeks are full.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wherefore also the
Romans used to say that Marcus Crassus <span
id="fr_163"></span>[b](#fn_163.md) had hay on his horn: for those who
heckled the other chief men in the State were on their guard against
assailing him, since they knew that he was vindictive and hard to cope
with. Later, however, another saying was bandied about, that Caesar had
pulled the hay from Crassus; for Caesar was the first to oppose Crassus
in public policy and to treat him with contumely.

 

72\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> did they think that the priests
that take omens from birds, whom they formerly called *Auspices*, but
now *Augures*, should always keep their lanterns open and put no cover
on them?

Were they like the Pythagoreans, <span id="fr_164"></span>[c](#fn_164.md)
who made small matters symbols of great, forbidding men to sit on a peck
measure or to poke a fire with a sword; and even so did the men of old
make use of many riddles, especially with reference to priests; and is
the question of the lantern of this sort? For the

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

lantern is like the body which encompasses the soul; the soul within is
a light <span id="fr_165"></span>[a](#fn_165.md) and the part of it that
comprehends and thinks should be ever open and clear-sighted, and should
never be closed nor remain unseen.

Now when the winds are blowing the birds are unsteady, and do not afford
reliable signs because of their wandering and irregular movements.
Therefore by this custom they instruct the augurs not to go forth to
obtain these signs when the wind is blowing, but only in calm and still
weather when they can use their lanterns open.

 

73\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> was it forbidden to priests that
had any sore upon their bodies to sit and watch for birds of omen?

Is this also a symbolic indication that those who deal with matters
divine should be in no way suffering from any smart, and should not, as
it were, have any sore or affection in their souls, but should be
untroubled, unscathed, and undistracted?

Or is it only logical, if no one would use for sacrifice a victim
afflicted with a sore, or use such birds for augury, that they should be
still more on their guard against such things in their own case, and be
pure, unhurt, and sound when they advance to interpret signs from the
gods? <span id="fr_166"></span>[b](#fn_166.md) For a sore seems to be a
sort of mutilation or pollution of the body.

 

74\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> did King Servius Tullius build a
shrine of Little Fortune, which they call *Brevis*? <span
id="fr_167"></span>[c](#fn_167.md)

Is it because although, at the first, he was a man of little importance
and of humble activities and the

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

son of a captive woman, yet, owing to Fortune, he became king of Rome?
Or does this very change reveal the greatness rather than the littleness
of Fortune, and does Servius beyond all other men seem to have deified
the power of Fortune, <span id="fr_168"></span>[a](#fn_168.md) and to have
set her formally over all manner of actions? For he not only built
shrines <span id="fr_169"></span>[b](#fn_169.md) of Fortune the Giver of
Good Hope, the Averter of Evil, the Gentle, the First-Born, <span
id="fr_170"></span>[c](#fn_170.md) and the Male; but there is also a shrine
of Private Fortune, another of Attentive Fortune, and still another of
Fortune the Virgin. Yet why need anyone review her other appellations,
when there is a shrine of the Fowler's Fortune, or *Viscata*, as they
call her, signifying that we are caught by Fortune from afar and held
fast by circumstances?

Consider, however, whether it he not that Servius observed the mighty
potency of Fortune's ever slight mutation, and that by the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of some slight thing, it has often fallen to the lot of
some to succeed or to fail in the greatest enterprises, and it was for
this reason that he built the shrine of Little Fortune, teaching men to
give great heed to events, and not to despise anything that they
encountered by reason of its triviality.

 

75\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> did they not extinguish a lamp,
but suffered it to go out of itself? <span
id="fr_171"></span>[d](#fn_171.md)

Did they reverence it as akin and closely related to the
inextinguishable and undying fire, or is this also a symbolic indication
that we should not destroy

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

nor do away with any living thing, if it does us no harm, since fire is
like a living thing? For it needs sustenance, it moves of itself, and
when it is extinguished it gives out a sound as if it were being slain.

Or does this custom teach us that we should not destroy fire, water, or
any other necessity when we have enough and to spare, but should allow
those who have need of these things to use them, and should leave them
for others when we ourselves no longer have any use for them?

 

76\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they that are reputed to be
of distinguished lineage wear crescents on their shoes? <span
id="fr_172"></span>[a](#fn_172.md)

Is this, as Castor says, <span id="fr_173"></span>[b](#fn_173.md) an emblem
of the fabled residence in the moon, and an indication that after death
their souls will again have the moon beneath their feet <span
id="fr_174"></span>[c](#fn_174.md); or was this the special privilege of
the most ancient families? These were Arcadians of Evander's following,
the so-called Pre-Lunar <span id="fr_175"></span>[d](#fn_175.md) people.

Or does this also, like many another custom, remind the exalted and
proud of the mutability, for better or worse, in the affairs of men, and
that they should take the moon as an illustration <span
id="fr_176"></span>[e](#fn_176.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">When out of darkness first she comes anew  
Her face she shows increasing fair and full;  
And when she reaches once her brightest sheen,  
Again she wastes away and comes to naught?</span>

</div>

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

Or was it a lesson in obedience to authority, teaching them not to be
disaffected under the government of kings, but to be even as the moon,
who is willing to give heed to her superior and to be a second to him,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Ever gazing in awe at the rays of the
bright-gleaming Sun-god,</span>

</div>

as Parmenides <span id="fr_177"></span>[a](#fn_177.md) puts it; and were
they thus to be content with their second place, living under their
ruler, and enjoying the power and honour derived from him?

 

77\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they believe that the year
belongs to Jupiter, but the months to Juno?

Is it because Jupiter and Juno rule the invisible, conceptual deities,
but the sun and moon the visible deities? Now the sun makes the year and
the moon the months; but one must not believe that the sun and moon are
merely images of Jupiter and Juno, but that the sun is really Jupiter
himself in his material form and in the same way the moon is Juno. This
is the reason why the Romans apply the name Juno to our Hera, for the
name means "young" or "junior," so named from the moon. And they also
call her Lucina, that is "brilliant" or "light-giving"; and they believe
that she aids women in the pangs of childbirth, even as the moon <span
id="fr_178"></span>[b](#fn_178.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">On through the dark-blue vault of the stars,  
Through the moon that brings birth quickly;</span>

</div>

for women are thought to have easiest travail at the time of the full
moon.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

78\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> of birds is the one called
"left-hand" a bird of good omen?

Is this not really true, but is it the peculiarity of the language which
throws many off the track? For their word for "left" is *sinistrum*; "to
permit" is *sinere*; and they say *sine* when they urge giving
permission. Accordingly the bird which permits the augural action to be
taken, that is, the *avis sinisteria*, the vulgar are not correct in
assuming to be *sinistra* and in calling it so.

Or is it, as Dionysius <span id="fr_179"></span>[a](#fn_179.md) says, that
when Ascanius, son of Aeneas, was drawing up his army against Mezentius,
and his men were taking the auspices, a flash of lightning, which
portended victory, appeared on the left, and from that time on they
observe this practice in divination? Or is it true, as certain other
authorities affirm, that this happened to Aeneas? As a matter of fact,
the Thebans, when they had routed and overpowered their enemies on the
left wing at Leuctra, <span id="fr_180"></span>[b](#fn_180.md) continued
thereafter to assign to the left the chief command in all battles.

Or <span id="fr_181"></span>[c](#fn_181.md) is it rather, as Juba <span
id="fr_182"></span>[d](#fn_182.md) declares, that as anyone looks eastward,
the north is on the left, and some make out the north to be the right,
or upper, side of the universe?

But consider whether it be not that the left is by nature the weaker
side, and they that preside over auguries try to strengthen and prop its
deficient powers by this method of equalization.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span> <span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

Or was it that they believed earthly and mortal matters to be
antithetical to things heavenly and divine, and so thought that whatever
was on the left for us the gods were sending forth from the right?

 

79\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> was it permitted to take up a
bone of a man who had enjoyed a triumph, and had later died and been
cremated, and carry it into the city and deposit it there, as
Pyrrhon <span id="fr_183"></span>[a](#fn_183.md) of Lipara has recorded?

Was it to show honour to the dead? In fact, to other men of achievement,
as well as to generals, they granted, not only for themselves, but also
for their descendants, the right to be buried in the Forum, as they did
to Valerius <span id="fr_184"></span>[b](#fn_184.md) and to Fabricius; and
they relate that when descendants of these men die and have been
conveyed to the Forum, a lighted torch is placed beneath the body and
then immediately withdrawn; thus they enjoy the honour without exciting
envy, and merely confirm their prerogative.
