------------------------------------------------------------------------

40-49.

40\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it not allowed the priest of
Jupiter (*Flamen Dialis*) to anoint himself in the open air? <span
id="fr_90"></span>[b](#fn_90.md)

Is it because it used not to be proper or decent for sons to strip in
their father's sight, nor a son-in-law in the presence of his
father-in-law, nor in ancient days did they bathe together? <span
id="fr_91"></span>[c](#fn_91.md) Now Jupiter is our father, and whatever is
in the open air is in some way thought to be particularly in his sight.

Or, just as it is against divine ordinance to strip oneself in a shrine
or a temple, so also did they scrupulously avoid the open air and the
space beneath the

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

heavens, since it was full of gods and spirits? Wherefore also we
perform many necessary acts under a roof, hidden and concealed by our
houses from the view of Divine powers.

Or are some regulations prescribed for the priest alone, while others
are prescribed for all by the law through the priest? Wherefore also, in
my country, to wear a garland, to wear the hair long, not to have any
iron on one's person, and not to set foot within the boundaries of
Phocis, are the special functions of an archon; but not to taste fruit
before the autumnal equinox nor to prune a vine before the vernal
equinox are prohibitions disclosed to practically all alike through the
archon; for those are the proper seasons for each of these acts.

In the same way, then, it is apparently a special obligation of the
Roman priest also not to use a horse nor to be absent from the city more
than three nights <span id="fr_92"></span>[a](#fn_92.md) nor to lay aside
the cap from which he derives the name of, *flamen*. <span
id="fr_93"></span>[b](#fn_93.md) But many other regulations are revealed to
all through the priest, and one of them is the prohibition not to anoint
oneself in the open air. For the Romans used to be very suspicious of
rubbing down with oil, and even to-day they believe that nothing has
been so much to blame for the enslavement and effeminacy of the Greeks
as their gymnasia and wrestling-schools, which engender much listless
idleness and waste of time in their cities, as well as paederasty and
the ruin of the bodies of

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

the young men with regulated sleeping, walking, rhythmical movements,
and strict diet; by these practices they have unconsciously lapsed from
the practice of arms, and have become content to be termed nimble
athletes and handsome wrestlers rather than excellent men-at-arms and
horsemen. It is hard work, at any rate, when men strip in the open air,
to escape these consequences; but those who anoint themselves and care
for their bodies in their own houses commit no offence.

 

41\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> did their ancient coinage have
stamped on one side a double-faced likeness of Janus, on the other the
stern or the prow of a ship? <span id="fr_94"></span>[a](#fn_94.md)

Is it, as many affirm, in honour of Saturn who crossed over to Italy in
a ship?

Or, since this might be said of many, inasmuch as Janus, Evander, and
Aeneas all landed in Italy after a voyage by sea, one might rather
conjecture thus: some things are excellent for States, others are
necessary; and of the excellent things good government is the chief, and
of the necessary things facility of provision. Since, therefore, Janus
established for them an ordered government by civilizing their life, and
since the river, which was navigable and permitted transportation both
from the sea and from the land, provided them with an abundance of
necessities, the coinage came to have as its symbol the twofold form of
the lawgiver, as has been stated, <span id="fr_95"></span>[b](#fn_95.md)
because of the change he wrought, and the vessel as symbol of the river.

They also used another kind of coinage, stamped

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

with the figures of a bull, a ram, and a boar, <span
id="fr_96"></span>[a](#fn_96.md) because their prosperity came mostly from
their live stock, and from these they also derived their affluence.

This is the reason why many of the names of the ancient families are
such as the Suillii, Bubulci, Porcii, <span
id="fr_97"></span>[b](#fn_97.md) as Fenestella <span
id="fr_98"></span>[c](#fn_98.md) has stated.

 

42\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do they use the temple of Saturn
as the public treasury and also as a place of storage for records of
contracts? <span id="fr_99"></span>[d](#fn_99.md)

Is it because the opinion and tradition prevailed that when Saturn was
king there was no greed or injustice among men, but good faith and
justice?

Or is it because the god was the discoverer of crops and the pioneer in
husbandry? For this is what his sickle signifies and not as
Antimachus, <span id="fr_100"></span>[e](#fn_100.md) following
Hesiod, <span id="fr_101"></span>[f](#fn_101.md) has written:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Here with sickle in hand was wrought the form of
rough Cronus  
Maiming his sire at his side, who is Uranus, offspring of Acmon.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now abundant
harvests and their disposal are what give rise to a monetary system;
therefore they make the god who is the cause of their good fortune its
guardian also. Testimony to support this may be found in the fact that
the markets held every eight days and called *nundinae* <span
id="fr_102"></span>[g](#fn_102.md) are considered sacred to

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Saturn, for it was
the superabundance of the harvest that initiated buying and selling.

Or is this a matter of ancient history, and was Valerius Publicola the
first to make the temple of Saturn the treasury, when the kings had been
overthrown, because he believed that the place was well-protected, in
plain sight, and hard to attack secretly?

 

43\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> do the ambassadors to Rome, from
whatever country they come, proceed to the temple of Saturn, and
register with the prefects of the treasury?

Is it because Saturn was a foreigner, and consequently takes pleasure in
foreigners, or is the solution of this question also to be found in
history? For it seems that in early days the treasurers <span
id="fr_103"></span>[a](#fn_103.md) used to send gifts to the ambassadors,
which were called *lautia*, and they cared for the ambassadors when they
were sick, and buried them at public expense if they died; but now,
owing to the great number of embassies that come, this expensive
practice has been discontinued; yet there still remains the preliminary
meeting with the prefects of the treasury in the guise of registration.

 

44\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> may not the priest of Jupiter
(*Flamen Dialis*) take an oath? <span id="fr_104"></span>[b](#fn_104.md)

Is it because an oath is a kind of test to prove that men are free-born,
and neither the body nor the soul of the priest must be subjected to any
test?

Or is it because it is unreasonable to distrust in trivial affairs him
who is entrusted with holy matters of the greatest importance?

Or is it because every oath concludes with a curse

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span> <span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

on perjury, and a curse is an ill-omened and gloomy thing? This is the
reason why priests may not even invoke curses upon others. At any rate
the priestess at Athens who was unwilling to curse Alcibiades at the
people's bidding won general approval, for she declared that she had
been made a priestess of prayer, not of cursing. <span
id="fr_105"></span>[a](#fn_105.md)

Or is it because the danger of perjury is a public danger if an impious
and perjured man leads in prayer and sacrifice on behalf of the State?

 

45\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> on the festival of the Veneralia
do they pour out a great quantity of wine from the temple of
Venus? <span id="fr_106"></span>[b](#fn_106.md)

Is it true, as most authorities affirm, that Mezentius, general of the
Etruscans, sent to Aeneas and offered peace on condition of his
receiving the year's vintage? But when Aeneas refused, Mezentius
promised his Etruscans that when he had prevailed in battle, he would
give them the wine. Aeneas learned of his promise and consecrated the
wine to the gods, and after his victory he collected all the vintage and
poured it out in front of the temple of Venus.

Or is this also symbolic, indicating that men should be sober and not
drunken on festival days, since the gods take more pleasure in those who
spill much strong drink than in those who imbibe it?

 

46\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> did the men of old keep the
temple of Horta continually open?

Is it, as Antistius Labeo has stated, that since "to

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

urge on" is expressed by *hortari*, Horta is the goddess who urges us
on, as it were, and incites us to noble actions; and thus they thought
that, since she was ever active, she should never be procrastinating nor
shut off by herself nor unemployed?

Or rather do they call her, as at present, Hora, with the first syllable
lengthened, an attentive and very considerate goddess, who, since she
was protective and thoughtful, they felt was never indifferent nor
neglectful of human affairs?

Or is this too, like many other Latin words, a Greek word, and does it
signify the supervising and guardian goddess? Hence her temple was
continually open since she neither slumbers nor sleeps.

If, however, Labeo be right in pointing out that Hora is derived from
"*parorman*" <span id="fr_107"></span>[a](#fn_107) (to urge on.md),
consider whether we must not declare that orator is thus to be derived,
since an *orator* is a counsellor or popular leader who stimulates, as
it were, and incites; and it is not to be derived from "imprecating" or
"praying" (*orare*), as some assert.

 

47\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> did Romulus build the temple of
Vulcan outside the city?

Was it in consequence of Vulcan's fabled jealousy of Mars because of
Venus <span id="fr_108"></span>[b](#fn_108.md) that Romulus, the reputed
son of Mars, did not give Vulcan a share in his home or his city?

Or is this a foolish explanation, and was the temple originally built as
a secret place of assembly and council-chamber for himself and his
colleague Tatius,

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

that here they might convene with the senators and take counsel
concerning public affairs in quiet without being disturbed?

Or was it that since Rome, from the very beginning, has been in great
danger from conflagrations, they decided to show honour to this god, but
to place his temple outside of the city? <span
id="fr_109"></span>[a](#fn_109.md)

 

48\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> is it that at the festival of
the Consualia they place garlands on both the horses and the asses and
allow them to rest?

Is it because they celebrate this festival in honour of Poseidon, god of
horses, <span id="fr_110"></span>[b](#fn_110.md) and the ass enjoys a share
in the horse's exemption?

Or is it that since navigation and transport by sea have been
discovered, pack animals have come to enjoy a certain measure of ease
and rest?

 

49\. <span class="smallcaps">Why</span> was it the custom for those
canvassing for office to do so in the toga without the tunic, as Cato
has recorded? <span id="fr_111"></span>[c](#fn_111.md)

Was it in order that they might not carry money in the folds of their
tunic and give bribes?

Or was it rather because they used to judge candidates worthy of office,
not by their family nor their wealth nor their repute, but by their
wounds and scars? Accordingly that these might be visible to those that
encountered them, they used to go down to their canvassing without
tunics.

Or were they trying to commend themselves to popular favour by thus
humiliating themselves by their scanty attire, even as they do by
hand-shaking, personal appeals, and fawning behaviour?
