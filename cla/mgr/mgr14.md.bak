### DEMETER AND PERSEPHONE (CERES AND PROSERPINE)

The name Demeter means not Earth-Mother, but Grain-Mother. So long as
man was a hunter only, the Lady-of-the-Wild-Things and the Earth-Mother
who, unbidden, sent up flowers in the spring and fruit in autumn, these
were adequate to express his needs. But there came a time when man
settled down to plough the earth, to sow seeds and reap grain, and then
he needed a Grain-Mother, Demeter.

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

We are used to see ploughing and sowing and reaping done mainly by men,
and it may surprise us to find that the Grain-Goddess took the form of a
woman. But the first beginnings of agriculture have always lain with
women. While the man was away hunting, woman, tied at home by her baby,
had leisure to sow grain and reap fruits. Moreover, there is another and
a magical reason. In his *History of the New World* Mr. Payne tells us
that in primitive America man would have nothing to say to agriculture.
He dared not interfere, for he thought it depended magically for its
success on women, and was connected with child-bearing. "When the women
plant maize," said the Indian to Gumilla, "the stalk produces two or
three ears. Why? Because women know how to produce children. They only
know how to plant the corn so as to be sure of it germinating. Then let
them plant it, they know more than we do."

Homer seems to know nothing of the beautiful story of the Rape of
Persephone and the Mourning of Demeter, of the Kathodos or going down
into Hades, and the Anodos, the rising-up in spring. He just mentions
Demeter but as dwelling on earth, not on Olympus: he tells how she
stands with her yellow hair at the sacred threshing-floor when men are
winnowing, and how "she maketh division of grain and chaff, and the
heaps of chaff grow white." But he seems to know nothing of

                       "that fair field  
Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers,  
Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis  
Was gathered--which cost Seres all that pain  
To seek her through the world."

It is Shakespeare, not Homer, who cries:

                         "O Proserpina,  
For the flowers now, that, affrighted, thou letst fall  
From Dis's waggon."

Persephone is for Homer not Korê, not the lovely maiden form of the
Grain-Mother, but the dread Queen of the underworld, ruling in Hades.
Odysseus wishes to have speech with the dead heroes in Hades, but:

"Ere that might be, the ghosts thronged round in myriads manifold,  
 Weird was the magic din they made, a pale green fear gat hold  
 Of me, lest, for my daring, Persephone the dread  
 From Hades should send up the awful monster's grisly head."

The "awful monster" is the Gorgon, and the monster's head the
*gorgoneion*. This takes us straight to another aspect of the Mother.
Demeter herself, mild and beneficent though she was, had her darker
side. The Athenians called the Dead *Demetreioi*, Demeter's People. Not
only did she bring all things to life, but, when they died, she received
them back into her bosom. "Dust we are and unto dust we shall return";
and Æschylus says:

"Yea, summon Earth, who brings all things to life,  
 And rears and takes again into her womb."

A ghost is to primitive man always a terrifying thing, a bogey, and so
the Earth-Mother, as guardian of the Dead, becomes a gorgon. On a
Rhodian plate in the British Museum the Great Mother is figured grasping
in her hands two birds, with human body and feet, but she is winged,
and, in place of her head, she had a gorgon-mask, a *gorgoneion* with
great tusks. There is no such thing as a gorgon, so there can be no real
gorgon's head, but there are such things as ritual masks, ugly faces
made to scare men and demons. Our museums of anthropology are full of
them, and they are still in frequent use among savage tribes. The
*gorgoneion* has pendent tongue, glaring eyes, protruding tusks. It is
the

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

image of terror incarnate. The non-existent gorgon monster was created
to account for the ritual mask.

This dark side of Demeter, as guardian of ghosts, is expressed in her
name Demeter-Erinys. Erinys is simply an angry ghost, and, as ghosts are
many, the name has become pluralized as Erinyes. In the *Eumenides* of
Æschylus we have the transformation of these vindictive Erinyes, these
angry ghosts, these figures of terror and vengeance, into figures of
fertility, holy and benignant, carrying in one hand their underground
snakes, in the other, to mark their double aspect, fruit and flowers.
Such was the general trend of Greek religion, the transformation of fear
and ugliness into beauty and tranquillity.

Two gods yet remain to be considered. Homer does not recognize them,
but, by the middle of the fifth century B.C. they have worked their way
into Olympus. We find them admitted to the solemn assembly seated in the
Parthenon frieze. These two gods, Dionysos and Eros, have certain
affinities that make it desirable to treat of them in conjunction. Both
are Mystery gods. We begin with Dionysos.
