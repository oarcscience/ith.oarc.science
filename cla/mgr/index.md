This short review of the Greek pantheon (alas, there is little about
Rome), is part of a series of inexpensive adult education books
published during the 1920s. The author, Jane Harrison, was one of the
most prominent classicists of the era; so this is a bit like hiring a
French chef to cook up a big mess of *pommes frites*. Besides being a
respected academic, Harrison influenced many of the 20th century
[neo-Pagans](../../pag/index) and [Goddess](../../wmn/index.md) theorists.

Harrison is making a point here: Greek mythology was not the static
pageant that we learned in school, or read in [Bulfinch](../bulf/index.md).
It did not spring forth fully formed, but evolved out of a set of
ancient local deities. She proposes that the Greek goddesses emerged
from native Pelasgian tutelary spirits, and much of the male pantheon
was imposed by Indo-Europeans. Her analysis of the evolution of the
attributes of the god Poseidon as originating from a Minoan bull god is
speculative but intriguing. Whether Harrison was correct or not, her
reexamination of this subject which has been covered so many times is
refreshing.
