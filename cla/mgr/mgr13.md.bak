### THE MOTHER OF THE GODS

Crete has left us, not only the divine bull Poseidon, but also another
figure, even more majestic, the Mother of the Gods, the
Lady-of-the-Wild-Things.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

The Mother of the Gods never made her way into Olympus. Probably Zeus,
Father of gods and men, could not, would not, brook her rivalry, and she
was a figure far too dominant and splendid to submit to mere wifehood.
As we might expect, the Cretans made the goddess in their own image. Of
this we have certain evidence in a clay sealing or impression from a gem
found by Sir Arthur Evans at Cnossos.

The design shows a high-peaked mountain, at the apex of which the
goddess stands. She holds a sceptre in her outstretched hand, and for
guardians she has two fierce mountain-ranging lions, one to either side
in solemn heraldic fashion. We know these lions well, for they came to
the mainland to protect the great gate of the citadel of Mycenæ. Between
them, at Mycenæ, is a column which represents the goddess. But here in
the Cretan sealing she is no dead column, she has come to life,
dominant, imperious. The Mycenæan women have, indeed, made their goddess
in their own image; wild thing though she is, they have clad her in
their own grotesque skirt with its manifold flounces.

The goddess is dominant indeed, but the holy bull is not forgotten.
Behind the Mountain Mother on the gem is a shrine of "Mycenæan" pattern,
with its odd columns and horns. These last mark a cult whose divinity
was a bull-headed man, whose chief sacrifice was a bull. Before the
goddess stands a worshipper rapt in ecstasy.

On this seal impression we have the Lady-of-the-Wild-Things with her
lions. A Minoan intaglio, found quite recently at Thisbe, in Bœotia,
gives another aspect of the goddess wholly different, but not less
important. The goddess is depicted, not on her mountain, but rising out
of the ground, in which she is still sunk knee-deep. She wears the
Cretan flounced skirt and a short-sleeved bodice, from which emerge two
great breasts. She is altogether the mother. To either side of her are,
not her

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

lions, but two great blossoming plants, also rising from the ground. In
her left hand she grasps three poppy capsules. The poppy, with its
countless seeds, is always the emblem of fertility. Over her right
shoulder are seen the heads of three snakes. Her right wrist is grasped
by a male attendant, who lifts her from the ground. It is the Mother
goddess rising from the earth in the spring. The scene depicted is what
the Greeks called the *Anodos* (up-rising). This *Anodos* was known to
us on countless Greek vases, but till the Thisbe gem was discovered we
never knew that the origin of the *Anodos* was to be found in Crete. At
Delphi, at Athens, and at Megara, the Greeks had rites of summoning or
calling up the Goddess. One of these rites was called the "Bringing-up
of Semele." Semele, as we shall presently see, is only the Thracian form
of Gê or Gaia, the Earth.

It is strange and very instructive to turn from the Olympian
patriarchal, Father of gods and men, to the Great Mother. Zeus
succeeded, to a large extent, in effacing her, but, in the background,
her impressive figure always remained. The priestesses at the ancient
oracular shine of Dodona include her name in their chanted litany:

"Earth sends up fruits, so praise we Earth the Mother."

And at Delphi the priestess began her formal ritual address to the gods
thus:

"First in my prayer before all other gods,  
 I call on Earth, primeval prophetess."

Gaia was at Delphi before Poseidon, before Dionysos, before even Apollo.

Our religion teaches us to revere a male Trinity; the figure of the
Mother is absent. The Roman and Orthodox churches with a more happy and
genial humanism, include the Mother who is also the Maid. In Greece the
Mother and the Father gods are characteristic of the

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

two main theological strata, the Mother is "Pelasgian" and Minoan, the
Father Indo-European--that is, Hellenic. The Mother is accompanied
usually by a male attendant, either son or lover, but his position is
always strictly subordinate. We have seen how this relation survives in
the guardianship of Athena, Hera, Artemis over their heroes.

 

The figure half rising from the earth we are accustomed to call either
Earth or the Mother. But on one vase in the Ashmolean Museum, in Oxford,
the uprising figure is inscribed *Pandora*. Pandora is familiar to us
all from the story of Hesiod. In the *Works and Days* he thus recounts
the making of Pandora:

"He spake, and they did the will of Zeus, son of Kronos, the Lord;  
 For straightway the Halting One, the Famous, at his word  
 Took clay and moulded an image, in form of a maiden fair,  
 And Athene, the grey-eyed goddess, girt her, and decked her hair.  
 And about her the Graces divine and our Lady Persuasion set  
 Bracelets of gold on her flesh; and about her others yet,  
 The Hours, with their beautiful hair, twined wreaths of blossoms of
spring,  
 While Pallas Athene still ordered her decking in everything.  
 Then put the Argus-slayer, the marshal of souls to their place,  
 Tricks and flattering words in her bosom, and thievish ways.  
 He wrought by the will of Zeus, the Loud-thundering, giving her
voice,  
 Spokesman of gods, that he is, and for name of her this was his choice,
<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>  
 PANDORA, because in Olympos the gods joined together them,  
 And all of them gave her, a gift, a sorrow to covetous men."

"Pandora's box" has become proverbial, but the word *pithos*, used by
Hesiod, does not mean box at all, it means a huge earthenware jar. Rows
of these *pithoi* buried deep in the earth have come to light at
Cnossos. They were used for the storage of oil and wine and grain. They
were also used for purposes of burial, and occasionally gave shelter to
human beings. The famous tub of Diogenes was a *pithos*. When Pandora
opens her box it is not the light-minded woman temptress letting out
woes and ills to mortal man; it is the great Earth Mother who opens her
*pithos*, her storehouse of grain and fruit for her children. In the
"making of Pandora" the Great Mother has become the temptress maid, a
bane and not a blessing. Through all the charm and glamour of Hesiod's
verse there is an ugly glint of theological malice. He is all for the
Father, and the Father will have no Great Earth Mother in his
cloud-capped, man-made Olympus. So she who made all things has become
the slave of man, his lure, his plaything, dowered only with a slave's
bodily beauty and blandishments. The birth of the first woman is but a
huge Olympian joke to Zeus, the arch patriarchal bourgeois. "He spake,
and the Sire of men and of gods immortal laughed."

But we will not part from the Mother with a patriarchal joke. Rather let
the Homeric Hymn-writer chant her praises:

 

"Concerning Earth, the mother of all, shall I sing, firm Earth, eldest
of gods, that nourishes all things in the world; all things that fare on
the sacred land, all things in the sea, all flying things, all are fed
out of her store. Through thee, revered goddess, are men happy in their
children and fortunate in their harvest. Thine it is

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

to give or to take life from mortal men. Happy is he whom thou honourest
with favouring heart; to him all good things are present innumerable:
his fertile field is laden, his meadows are rich in cattle, his house
filled with all good things. Such men rule righteously in cities of fair
women, great wealth and riches are theirs, their children grow glorious
in fresh delights: their maidens joyfully dance and sport through the
soft meadow flowers in floral revelry. Such are those that thou
honourest, holy goddess, kindly spirit. Hail, Mother of the Gods, thou
wife of starry Ouranos, and freely in return for my ode give me
livelihood sufficient."

"Wife of Starry Ouranos," of Ouranos the firmament, who was before the
coming of Zeus. As such the mystic remembered her. On the Orphic gold
tablet buried with him to ensure his safety is inscribed the proud
confession: "I am the child of Earth and of Starry Heaven."

It would be pleasant to track the Earth-Mother to the mainland and show
her influence on each and all of the "Pelasgian" women goddesses--watch
how she gave to Aphrodite her doves, to Athene her snakes. But space
does not allow. Only a few brief words must be said of Demeter the
Mother, and her daughter Persephone.
