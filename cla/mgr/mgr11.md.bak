### HERMES (MERCURY)

If Apollo is, next after Zeus, greatest among the Olympians, Hermes is
certainly least; he is the herald, the messenger, the servant in
general. As messenger he appears in modern literature:

"New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill."

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As messenger, too,
he appears in the *Iliad*. To him is entrusted the difficult and
delicate mission of escorting Priam to the tent of Achilles, and he
acquits himself of the task with a tact really divine. Zeus, as he sends
him on his errand, says to him with affectionate condescension: "Hermes,
my son, to thee is it especially dear to companion men; go forth and so
guide Priam to the hollow ships of the Achaians that no man behold or be
aware of him."

 

"Thus spake he, and the Messenger, the slayer of Argus, was not
disobedient unto his word. Straightway beneath his feet he bound on his
fair sandals, golden, divine, that bare him over the wet sea and over
the boundless land with the breathings of the wind. And he took up his
wand wherewith he entranceth the eyes of such men as he will, and others
he likewise waketh out of sleep: this did the strong slayer of Argus
take in his hand, and flew. And quickly came he to Troy-land and the
Hellespont, and went on his way in semblance as a young man that is a
prince, with a new down on his chin, as when the youth of men is the
comeliest."

 

Again, in the *Odyssey* it is Hermes who is commissioned to go to the
nymph Calypso, and bid her despatch Odysseus to his home.

 

"And straightway Hermes bound beneath his feet his lovely golden
sandals, that wax not old, that bare him alike over the wet sea and over
the limitless land, swift as the breath of wind. And he took the wand
wherewith he lulls the eyes of whomso he will, while others again he
even wakes from out of sleep. With this rod in his hand flew the strong
slayer of Argus. Above Pisria he passed and leapt from the upper air
into the deep. Then he sped along the wave like the cormorant, that
chaseth the fishes through the perilous gulfs of the unharvested sea,
and wetteth his thick plumage in the brine. Such like did Hermes ride
upon the press of the waves."

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

Hermes is messenger from Olympus to Earth. He is also messenger from
Earth to Hades under the Earth. When Odysseus has slain the suitors, it
is Hermes who comes to conduct their souls to Hades. He is Psychopompos.

 

"Now Cyllenian Hermes called forth from the halls the souls of the
wooers, and he held in his hand his wand that is fair and golden,
wherewith he lulls the eyes of men, of whomso he will, while others
again he even wakens out of sleep. Herewith he roused and led the souls
who followed gibbering in the secret place of a wondrous cave, when one
has fallen down out of the rock from the cluster, and they cling each to
each up aloft, even so the souls gibbered as they fared together, and
Hermes, the helper, led them down the dank ways."

 

Such is Hermes as we know him to-day. Such is Hermes as Homer "composed"
him. "Touching Hermes," says Pausanias, "the poems of Homer have given
currency to the report that he is the servant of Zeus, and leads down to
hell the souls of the departed."

This goodly young messenger, with the winged sandals and the golden
wand, in what form was he actually worshipped? The answer comes as a
distinct shock. He was worshipped as a *herm*--that is, as a rude block
or post, later surmounted by a head. Pausanias, when he came to Pharæ in
Achaia, saw an image of Hermes Agoraios (He-of-the-Market).

 

"It was of square shape, surmounted by a head with a beard. It was of no
great size. In front of it was a hearth made of stone with bronze lamps
clamped to it with lead. Beside it an oracle is established. He who
would consult the oracle comes at evening, burns incense on the hearth,
lights the lamps, lays a coin of the country on the altar to the right
of the image and whispers his question into the ear of the god. Then he
stops his ears and quits the market-place, and when he is gone

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

outside a little way, he uncovers his ears and whatever word he hears
that he takes for an oracle."

 

Not only Hermes, but, it would seem, many of the other gods, began their
ritual life as hermæ. At Pharæ, close to the image of Hermes, Pausanias
goes on to tell us, "stood about thirty square stones; these the people
of Pharæ revered, giving to each stone the name of a god." "And," says
Pausanias, "in the olden time all the Greeks worshipped unwrought stones
instead of images." At Orchomenos in Bœotia, where was a very ancient
sanctuary of the Charities or Graces, their images were "stones that had
fallen from heaven." Pausanias elsewhere tells us that the square-shaped
images of Hermes were first used by the Athenians, who were a people
"zealous in all religious matters," and from Athens their usage passed
to the remainder of Greece. The sanctity of these square-shaped hermæ
was seen in the panic that ran through Athens when, just at the time of
the fatal Sicilian expedition, the sacred hermæ were sacrilegiously
mutilated.

Nothing could apparently be more unlike the winged messenger Hermes than
the rude, immovable, square herm. The anomaly struck the Greeks
themselves. Babrius, writing in the second or third century A. D., makes
the god himself wonder what on earth he was. Was he a tombstone, a
wayside post, or was he an immortal?

"A stonemason made a marble Herm for sale  
And men came up to bid. One wanted it  
For a tombstone, since his son was lately dead.  
A craftsman wanted to set it tip as a god.  
It was late, and the stonemason had not sold it yet.  
So he said, 'Come early to-morrow and look at it again.'  
He went to sleep and lo! in the gateway of dreams  
Hermes stood and said, 'My affairs now hang in the balance,  
Do make me one thing or another, dead man or god.'"

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

The answer to the god's own question might hardly have been found in
Greece, but from the old Slavonic rites of Russia comes a simple
solution. After they had held a sort of "wake" over the dead man, the
body was burned, and the ashes were placed in a small urn and set up on
a pillar or herm on the boundary line of two properties.

The dead grandfather was the object of special reverence, under the
title of *tchur*, which means in Russian either grandfather or boundary.
In the Russian of today *prashtchur* means great-great-grandfather, and
*tchur menya* means "may my grandfather preserve me." On the other hand,
the offence of removing a legal landmark is expressed by the word
*tchereztchur*, which means "beyond the limit," or "beyond my
grandfather." The grandfather looked after the patriarchal family during
his life, he safeguarded its boundaries in death. His monument was at
once tombstone and *term*.

Hermes, then, to begin with, is just a herm, a pillar or square stone to
keep the dead in memory and mark his grave; in form it is identical with
a boundary stone. The mourner hopes and believes that his kinsman,
loving; and faithful in life, will be faithful in death. So when; the
autumn comes and he sows his seed, burying it in the ground, he believes
that his father or his grandfather, if duly mourned and honoured, will
look after the seed in the underworld. The herm becomes a giver of
increase (*charidotes*).

Nor is this the end. During their lifetime a man will go to the elders
of his tribe, to his father and his grandfather, and ask for counsel in
time of need. Surely, now they are dead, they have not quite forgotten
him. So, as night falls and ghosts are about, he steals to the grave and
whispers to the herm his question. Even if the herm be dumb, the first
chance word spoken by a passerby seems miraculous. There is always magic
in the dead,

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

because they have passed into the unknown, and, when the living fail,
they may have power to help. So on the herm is painted the *rhabdos*,
which, to begin with, is not a messenger's staff at all, but a
magician's wand. And about the wand is coiled a snake, for a snake is
the symbol--nay, the incarnation--of the dead man, and creeps and coils
about his tomb.

Little by little the herm takes over the guardianship of all that man
prizes. If the worshipper is a shepherd, the herm tends his sheep and
rams, and becomes *Criophoros* (the Ram-Bearer), the prototype of
Christ, the Good Shepherd. Always the herm is guardian of children and
young men; he is *Kourotrophos* (Child-Rearer). As such Praxiteles made
his great statue of Hermes carrying the child Dionysos.

Exactly how the long leap was taken to Olympus we do not know. When the
high gods settled in Olympus, it was not unnatural that their humble
Pelasgian brother should be received as messenger and servant. He had
always been the means of communication between the upper and the lower
world. But when he became the messenger of the Olympian gods, he had to
shift his shape; his feet, once so firmly rooted in the ground, must be
loosed and fitted with golden sandals, his magician's wand with snakes
becomes a herald's staff, and he himself is no longer a bearded man, but
a youth with the down on his cheek, "the time when youth is most
goodly."

One interesting link between Hermes and his more magnificent brother,
Apollo, remains to be noted. Both are musicians. The Homeric Hymn-writer
thus addresses Apollo:

 

"Phœbus, to thee the swan sings shrill to the beating of his wings, as
he lights on the bank of the whirling pools of the river Peneus; and to
thee with his shrill

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

lyre does the sweet-voiced minstrel sing ever, both first and last."

 

He and the Muses are scarcely distinguishable.

"When Apollo comes leading his choir of Nine,"

the lyre is as much his attribute as the bow or the bay.

In the charming Homeric Hymn to Hermes we are told how Maia, the
fair-tressed nymph, bare to Zeus the babe Hermes, Lord of Cyllene and
Arcadia, rich in sheep.

 

"And the babe, when he leaped from the immortal knees of his mother, lay
not long in the sacred cradle, but sped forth to seek the cattle of
Apollo, crossing the threshold of the high-roofed cave. There found he a
tortoise and one endless delight, for lo! it was Hermes that first made
of the tortoise a minstrel. The creature met him at the outer door, as
she fed on the rich grass in front of the dwelling, waddling along, at
sight whereof the luck-bringing son of Zeus laughed, and straightway
spoke, saying:

"'Lo, a lucky omen for me, not by me to be mocked! Hail, darling and
dancer, friend of the feast, welcome art thou! Whence gatst thou the gay
garment, a speckled shell, thou, a mountain-dwelling tortoise? Nay, I
will carry thee within. Living shalt thou be a spell against all
witchery, and dead, then a right sweet music-maker.'

"So spake he, and raising in both hands the tortoise went back within
the dwelling, bearing the glad treasure. Then he choked the creature,
and with a gouge of grey iron he scooped out the marrow of the
hill-tortoise. He cut to measure stalks of reed and fixed them in
through holes bored in the stony shell of the tortoise, and he fitted
the bridge, and stretched seven harmonious cords of sheep-gut. Then took
he his treasure and touched the strings with the plektron, and
wondrously it sounded under his hand, and fair sang the god to its
notes."

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

Here we have the invention of an instrument in principle different from
the lyre. The lyre is purely a stringed instrument like the harp; the
instrument made by Hermes out of the *chelys*, or tortoise-shell, has a
sounding-board. It is the rudimentary form of the modern violin. The
*chelys* of Hermes was characteristic of the south, the lyre of Apollo
of the north.
