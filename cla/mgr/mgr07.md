### APHRODITE (VENUS)

In marked contrast to Athena stands the next of our local Korês
translated to Olympus, Aphrodite. Aphrodite is manifestly in Olympus an
outsider. She belongs, as her titles tell, to the southern and eastern
islands of the Greek archipelago: she is Cythereia, she of Cythêra; and
Cypria, she of Cyprus, where at Paphos she had her great sanctuary.
Living in islands her way was ever on the sea. As the Hymn in her honour
says:

"The west wind breathed to Cyprus and lifted her tenderly  
And bore her down the billow and the stream of the sounding sea  
In a cup of delicate foam. And the Hours in wreaths of gold  
Uprose in joy as she came, and laid on her fold on fold  
Fragrant raiment immortal, and a crown on the deathless head."

When, in the *Lay of Demodocus*, Aphrodite is released from the
disgraceful bonds in which she and Ares were imprisoned, she rose up

                     "And fast away fled she,  
Aphrodite, lover of laughter, to Cyprus over the sea,  
To the pleasant shores of Paphos, and the incensed altar-stone,  
Where the Graces washed her body, and shed sweet balm thereon,  
Ambrosial balm that shineth on the gods that wax not old,  
And wrapped her in lovely raiment, a wonder to behold."

Aphrodite, we see, is constantly attended by the Horæ, the seasons, and
she, like Hera, is herself a seasonal goddess. She is not, in our sense,
virginal, but a korê, a maiden, she assuredly is in her eternal youth
and radiance. Perhaps the best title for her is *Nymphê*, Bride. The
ancients, in their wisdom, saw that virginity was not a virtue to be
lost once for all, but a grace to be perennially renewed. Aphrodite is a
bride of the old order, she is never wife, she can never tolerate
permanent patriarchal wedlock. Her will is always turned toward love
rather than marriage. When she is admitted to the patriarchal Olympus,
an attempt, foolish and futile, is made to fit her out with a husband,
the craftsman, Hephaistos. The figure of Hephaistos in Homer is always
contemptible, but it serves to show that the Achaians had reached in
their conquest the volcanic island of Lemnos, whose craftsman god they
affiliated. As bride of Hephaistos, Aphrodite is also called Charis,
Grace. She is the Charis of physical charm and beauty incarnate. But in
the cold, austere North, where Artemis loved to dwell, she is never
really at home. She has about her too much of the physical joy of life
ever to find an abiding home far from the sunshine.

Another note of her late affiliation as an Olympian barely tolerated,
always glad to escape, is that in the *Iliad* she is a departmental
goddess, her sphere is that of one human passion. In the Homeric Hymn
she is of far wider import. The poet tells how, when she was seeking the
shepherd Anchises, "To many fountained Ida she came, mother of wild
beasts, and made straight for the steading through the mountain, while
behind her came fawning the beasts, grey wolves and lions fiery-eyed and
bears and swift pards, insatiate pursuers of the roe-deer. Glad was she
at the sight of them and sent desire into their breasts, and they went
coupling two by two in the shadowy dells." She is here the impulse of
life to all

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

things on the wide earth, a veritable Lady-of-the-Wild-Things. Yes, and
she is Lady, too, of the upper air as well as of sea and land. On a
vase-painting in the British Museum, a design of marvellous beauty, we
see her seated sedately on a great swan sailing through the upper air.

We are very near here to the august image of Venus Genetrix, fashioned
by the Roman poet and philosopher, Lucretius. His words are stiff and
majestic as became a Roman, but his thoughts are all Greek:

"Of Rome the Mother, of men and gods the pleasure,  
Fostering Venus, under heaven's gliding signs;  
Thou the ship-bearing sea, fruit-bearing land  
Still hauntest, since by thee each living thing  
Takes life and birth, and sees the light of the sun.

Thee, goddess, the winds fly from, thee the clouds  
And thine approach; for thee the dædal earth  
Sends up sweet flowers, the ocean levels smile,  
And heaven shines with floods of light appeased.

Thou, since alone thou rulest all the world,  
Nor without thee can any living thing  
Win to the shores of light and joy and love,  
Goddess, bid thou throughout the seas and land  
The works of furious war quieted cease."

In this image, Venus Genetrix, we have all the old radiance of
Aphrodite, but sobered, somehow, grave with the hauntings of earlier
goddesses.

 

We have examined the figures of three of the local Pelasgian Korai, or
Maidens, who became goddesses in Olympus; Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite.
It may help to their better understanding if we look for a moment at a
myth in which they all appear together. There is, perhaps, no Greek
story more familiar, more widely popular, than the Judgment of Paris.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

"Goddesses three to Ida came,  
  Immortal strife to settle there,  
Which was the fairest of the three,  
  And which the prize of beauty should wear.  
Evoê--wonderful ways have these goddesses now and then,  
Evoê--wonderful ways for beguiling the hearts of men."

The story, as usually understood, is vulgar enough. It tells of a
*kallisteion*, a beauty contest. At the wedding of Peleus the gods and
goddesses are assembled, and Eris, goddess of Strife, throws among them
a golden apple inscribed: "Let the fair one take it." The three august
goddesses, Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, snatch at the apple in hot
rivalry, and straightway betake themselves to Paris, Priam's son, the
young shepherd-prince for judgment.

I had been collecting instances of the Judgment of Paris in the museums
of Europe for many weeks when a singular fact struck me. In, at least,
three-fourths of the vases on which the "Judgment" was depicted, there
was no judge, no Paris. Moreover, in no single instance did the golden
apple appear. Clearly in the fifth and sixth centuries B.C., to which
these vases belong, the apple was unknown, and the figure of Paris
non-essential. The ordinary way of representing the myth was to depict
the three goddesses walking in solemn procession behind Hermes.
Moreover, the three rivals are, in the earlier vases, barely
differentiated; indeed, on one vase they have dispassionately attired
themselves in one huge cloak! Only in one instance can we find any hint
of preparation for a beauty contest. This instance is on a vase in the
Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, and, though late in style, is so
charming that it may be briefly described. The young Phrygian shepherd
occupies the centre, and round him are grouped the goddesses engaged in

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

their toilette for the judgment. Hera is putting her veil in order
before a mirror, and looks well content with her own image. Aphrodite
stretches out her white arm, and upon it a love-god is fastening a
bracelet. Athena, attended by a large, serious dog, clean-hearted
goddess as she is tucks her gown about her and is about to have a good
wash! Our hearts go out to Onone when she cries:

                    "'Oh, Paris,  
Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not.  
Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me."

What does this all mean, this absence of Paris, this adoption by the
vase-painter of the simple processional form, the undifferentiated
goddesses, led by Hermes? It means that, originally, the story was not a
beauty contest at all--a contest vulgar in itself, and doubly vulgar
when complicated by bribery. The vase-painter knows that the goddesses
are not three rival beauties, but three *gift-givers in rivalry;* he
takes an art type lying ready to hand, Hermes leading the three Graces
or Charities, the Gift-Givers. The Judgment of Paris is not a *decision*
between others, but a *choice* for himself. And the choice that was set
before Paris was a choice that might come to be made by any and every
young man and maiden. Early mythology scarcely differentiates between
the goddesses as gift-givers and the gifts they bring. These gifts,
dominion, wisdom, love, are what the Greeks called the *sêmeia*, the
tokens of the goddesses who bring them, and Hermes had led the goddesses
long since in varying forms before the eyes of each and all of mankind.
They might be conceived of as undifferentiated, as were givers of
blessing in general, but it needed only a little reflection to see that
Charis might be at war with Charis, Grace with Grace, and that if one be
chosen the others must needs be rejected.
