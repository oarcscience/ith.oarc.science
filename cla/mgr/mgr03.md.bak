### THE GODS OF HOMER'S OLYMPUS

WE have already said that Homer was not the starting-point for Greek
religion, yet we begin with Homer. This for a double reason. First, the
gods of Homer are fairly familiar to all, and it is well to begin with
what is known; second, mythology is our main concern, and though he is
certainly not the starting-point for religion, yet Homer undoubtedly is
the starting-point for mythology.

For this statement we have the best authority, that of Herodotus.
Happily for us, under the stimulus of foreign travel, and especially of
a visit paid to Egypt, the great historian came to reflect on the
origins of his own religion. He has left us the following significant
statement, a statement which should always stand at the head of any and
every discussion of Greek mythology. In Book II. of his History, he
writes:

 

"But as to the origin of each particular god, whether they all existed
from the beginning, what were their individual forms, the knowledge of
these things is, so to speak, but of to-day and yesterday. For Hesiod
and Homer are my seniors, I think, by some four hundred years, and not
more. And it is they who have composed for the Greeks the generations of
the gods, and have given to the gods their titles and distinguished
their several provinces and special powers, and marked their forms."

 

According, then, to Herodotus, the mythology of the Greeks, or if we
prefer so to call it, their theology, what they believed as to the gods,
their origin, character, habits, appearance, attributes, was not in the
main the simple

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

outcome of popular faith, still less was it a compilation due to a
priesthood; it was the work of the poets. Theology was a thing
"composed" advisedly, "put together" by a number of epic singers, and
this process was, according to the historian, "a thing of to-day and
yesterday," fairly complete some nine centuries before Christ. We have
noted the traditional tendency to study Greek mythology apart from
ritual and as ancillary to literature. Now, we see how this came about.
Greek mythology is, on the showing of Herodotus, largely the outcome of
literature. But if the religion of Greece, and especially its theology,
is mainly made by Homer, what was the material out of which he made it?
No one supposes that Homer created the gods, he only "composed their
generations and marked their forms." What, then, were the gods before
Homer?

It is Herodotus again who informs us. He knows of a people dwelling in
Greece before Homer's days, and their theology, as described by him, is
in marked contrast to that of Homer. "*Formerly*," he writes, "*the
Pelasgians on all occasions of sacrifice, called upon* theoi (*gods*),
*as I know from what I heard at Dodona; but they gave no title nor yet
any name to any of them*." There was, then, a time in Greece, if we may
trust Herodotus, when a people lived there called Pelasgians, and when
his people worshipped gods who were not individualized, not called by
proper names, such as Zeus and Athene, nor even by vaguer titles such as
"the Grey-Eyed One" or "the Loud Thunderer," when, in a word, the gods
were things, not persons. Can we believe Herodotus? Broadly speaking, we
can, because, in the main, he is confirmed by philology, comparative
religion, and prehistoric archæology. Among the Olympians, with whom we
must now make acquaintance, we shall find gods who are obviously in part
"Pelasgian."

The Olympians dwell on Olympus, a mountain on

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thessaly, from
which they take their name. They are Northerners. The Hellenes, who
worshipped them, were an immigrant people, who came down from the valley
of the Danube and conquered the indigenous Pelasgians. Homer's Achaians
are but one offshoot of those tribes of northern warriors who later, as
Dorians and as Gauls, again and again invaded the south, conquered and
blended with the smaller, darker, indigenous peoples, and, by blending
with them, saved them from being submerged in the great ocean of the
East. Homer's Achaians closely resemble the large-statured, fair-haired,
blue-eyed population of the north, whose blood is in our own veins. The
indigenous "Pelasgians," Herodotus tells us, "had never emigrated, but
the Hellenes 'had often changed their seat.'" Their first settlement in
Greece was in Thessaly. "Hellen and his sons," says Thucydides, "grew
strong in Pthiotis." It was these Northerners, these Hellenes, these
Achaians, who led the expedition against Troy. The Trojan War was the
first collective enterprise, according to Thucydides, that gave unity to
Greece.

Once awake to this northern element in Homer we are no longer surprised
to find his Olympus a certain forecast, as it were, of the atmosphere of
the Eddas. The gods of Homer, it has often been noted, are magnified
men; but why are they so very big and so very boisterous? Simply because
they are, in part, Northerners. Vastness, formlessness, fantastic excess
are not "Greek" in the classical sense. Very northern are the almost
Berserker rages of Zeus himself and the roughness of his divine
vengeance. To wave his ambrosial locks and shake Olympus by the nodding
of his brows, may be both Greek and godlike, but how about such manners
as "pushing the other gods from their seats," "tossing them about the
hall"; hurling his son by the foot over the battlements of Olympus;
beating his wife and hanging

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

her up with anvils to her feet, suggesting that she "would like to eat
Priam raw"? There is such magic in the words of Homer that we are apt to
forget that these are not the ways of Greek gods,
[however](errata.htm#0.md) primitive, but the rude pranks of irresponsible
giants. The old *theoi* have been, indeed, considerably "tossed about"
and are none the better for the process.

This northern element comes out in striking fashion in the figure of
Poseidon. When the Earth-Shaker goes down to battle he shouts mightily
"loud as nine thousand or ten thousand men cry in battle," and his shout
"puts great strength into the hearts of the Achaians." We remember how
Tacitus noted with amazement "the harsh note and confused roar" of the
battle-cry of the Germans with which they used to rouse their courage.
"It was not," he says, "so much an articulate sound as a general cry of
valour." Poseidon takes but three strides to pass from Samothrace to
Ægæ; surely the gait of a northern giant rather than of a Greek god.

It has often been noted that in their human aspect, Homer does not take
his gods very seriously. "There is no god so *good*," Mr. Gladstone
observes, "as the swineherd Eumæus." Zeus, on his atmospheric side, is
as magnificent as his own thunder; as husband and father he is lower
than the mortals over whom he rules. The nearer the gods are to the
Nature gods which they in part were, the more reverent they remain.
Poseidon, who is half sea and half river, "moves in a kind of rolling
splendour." Hephaistos, as the divine smith, is lame, and, therefore, to
the blunt taste of the Olympians, ridiculous; but as the fire-god, who
fights with the river-god Zanthus, he is a blazing glory. This lack of
seriousness is, in part, accounted for, if we suppose that the gods are
a blend of indigenous and immigrant elements. Homer is singing of
divinities, who are, in part at least, "other men's gods."

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

So far, then, we have found in Homer's Olympus two elements; first and
earliest, the primitive Pelasgian element; next, in marked contrast, the
immigrant Northern element. A third element, which we shall call Minoan,
must later be added, but the consideration of this is best carried over
till we come to Poseidon. In the figures of Zeus and Hera, his wife, we
shall see clearly mirrored the fusion of North and South, of Hellene and
Pelasgian. We begin, as is fitting, with Zeus.
