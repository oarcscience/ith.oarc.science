This short review of the Greek pantheon (alas, there is little about Rome),
is part of a series of inexpensive adult education
books published during the 1920s.
The author, Jane Harrison, was one of the most prominent classicists of
the era; so this is a bit like hiring a French chef to cook up a big
mess of <I>pommes frites</I>.
Besides being a respected academic,
Harrison influenced many of the 20th century
<A HREF="../../pag/index.htm">neo-Pagans</A>
and <A HREF="../../wmn/index.htm">Goddess</A> theorists.

<P>
Harrison is making a point here:
Greek mythology was not the static pageant that we learned in school,
or read in <A HREF="../bulf/index.htm">Bulfinch</A>.
It did not spring forth fully formed, but evolved out of a set of ancient
local deities.
She proposes that the Greek goddesses emerged from native Pelasgian
tutelary spirits, and much of the male pantheon was imposed by Indo-Europeans.
Her analysis of the evolution of the attributes of the god Poseidon as
originating from a Minoan bull god is speculative but intriguing.
Whether Harrison was correct or not, her reexamination of this subject
which has been covered so many times is refreshing.
