# The Dionysian Artificers

## by Hippolyto Joseph da Costa

#### \[1820\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This essay, published in 1820, was an attempt to prove that modern
Freemasonry derived from ancient Greek philosophical and religious
ideas. Hippolyto da Costa (1774-1823), was a Brazilian journalist,
author, Freemason and world traveller. He was imprisoned for being a
Freemason by the Inquisition in Portugal in 1802; he escaped in 1805. He
settled in London and wrote a two volume book about his experiences,
Narrativa da Perseguição, in 1811. He went on to start the first
Brazilian periodical, the Correio Braziliense or Armazém Literário,
(1808-23), for which he is known today as "the founder of the Brazilian
Press".

The original is extremely rare and was scanned from a reprint by the
Philosophical Research Society Press dated 1936, which notes that it was
"made possible through the courtesy of the Masonic Grand Lodge Library
at Cedar Rapids, Iowa".
