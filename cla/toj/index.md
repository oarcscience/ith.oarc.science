This translation of two works on pagan theology with a Platonic theme by
the Roman Emperor Julian is extremely rare. It was originally published
in 1793, and reprinted in 1932 in an edition of 500 copies, one of which
we used as the basis for this etext. (The 1932 edition had no copyright
notice).

The short-lived Emperor Julian (331-363 CE) suceeded Constantius in 361
CE. He shocked the empire by renouncing Christianity, which earned him
the title 'the Apostate' by Church historians. He issued an edict of
religious freedom, rebuilt the Pagan temples, ended banishment of
religious exiles, and eliminated special privileges for Christian
officials. He founded the Neo-platonic school of philosophy. Julian
spurned the decadant Byzantine palace; he dressed simply, studied
philosophy, promulgated tax reform, and fostered study of the humanities
and arts. However, his reign lasted only twenty months; he died in June
of 363 in battle with the Persians, possibly at the hand of a Christian.

This book is as notable for its author as for its translator. Thomas
Taylor (1758-1835) was a prolific classicist and one of the first modern
neo-Platonists. Although he was deprecated while alive, he had a huge
influence on H.P. Blatavsky and other theosophists.
