# The Preface of the Author To His Sonne, Faustinus And unto the Readers of this Book

          THAT I to thee some joyous jests  
            may show in gentle gloze,  
          And frankly feed thy bended eares  
            with passing pleasant prose:  
          So that thou daine in seemly sort  
            this wanton booke to view,  
          That is set out and garnisht fine,  
            with written phrases new.  
          I will declare how one by hap  
            his humane figure lost,  
          And how in brutish formed shape,  
            his loathed life he tost.  
          And how he was in course of time  
            from such a state unfold,  
          Who eftsoone turn'd to pristine shape  
            his lot unlucky told.

What and who he was attend a while, and you shall understand that it was
even I, the writer of mine own Metamorphosie and strange alteration of
figure. Hymettus, Athens, Isthmia, Ephire Tenaros, and Sparta, being fat
and fertile soiles (as I pray you give credit to the bookes of more
everlasting fame) be places where myne antient progeny and linage did
sometime flourish: there I say, in Athens, when I was yong, I went first
to schoole. Soone after (as a stranger) I arrived at Rome, whereas by
great industry, and without instruction of any schoolmaster, I attained
to the full perfection of the Latine tongue. Behold, I first crave and
beg your pardon, lest I should happen to displease or offend any of you
by the rude and rusticke utterance of this strange and forrein language.
And verily this new alteration of speech doth correspond to the
enterprised matter whereof I purpose to entreat, I will set forth unto
you a pleasant Grecian jeast. Whereunto gentle Reader if thou wilt give
attendant eare, it will minister unto thee such delectable matter as
thou shalt be contented withall.
