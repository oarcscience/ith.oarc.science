# THE THIRTY-THIRD CHAPTER

How Apuleius was lead away by the Horsekeeper: and what danger he was
in.

By and by the Horsekeeper, to whom the charge of me was committed,
brought forth all his substance, and laded me and other Horses withall,
and so departed thence: we bare women, children, pullets, sparrowes,
kiddes, whelpes, and other things which were not able to keepe pace with
us, and that which I bare upon my backe, although it was a mighty
burthen, yet seemed it very light because I was driven away from him
that most terribly had appointed to kill me. When we had passed over a
great mountaine full of trees, and were come againe into the open
fields, behold we approached nigh to a faire and rich Castell, where it
was told unto us that we were not able to passe in our journey that
night, by reason of the great number of terrible Wolves which were in
the Country about, so fierce and cruell that they put every man in
feare, in such sort that they would invade and set upon such which
passed by like theeves, and devoure both them and their beasts.
Moreover, we were advertised that there lay in the way where we should
passe, many dead bodies eaten and torne with wolves. Wherefore we were
willed to stay there all night, and on the next morning, to goe close
and round together, whereby we might passe and escape all dangers. But
(notwithstanding this good counsell) our caitife drivers were so
covetous to goe forward, and so fearefull of pursuite, that they never
stayed till the morning: But being welnigh midnight, they made us trudge
in our way apace. Then I fearing the great danger which might happen,
ran amongst the middle of the other Horses, to the end I might defend
and save my poore buttocks from the Wolves, whereat every man much
marvelled to see, that I scowred away swifter then the other Horses. But
such was my agility, not to get me any prayse, but rather for feare: at
that time I remembered with my selfe, that the valiant Horse Pegasus did
fly in the ayre more to avoyd the danger of dreadful Chimera, then for
any thing else. The shepheards which drave us before them were well
armed like warriours: one had a speare, another had a sheepehooke, some
had darts, some clubbes, some gathered up great stones, some held up
their sharp Javelings, and some feared away the Woolves with light
firebrands. Finally wee lacked nothing to make up an Army, but onely
Drummes and Trumpets. But when we had passed these dangers, not without
small feare, wee fortuned to fall into worse, for the Woolves came not
upon us, either because of the great multitude of our company, or else
because \[of\] our firebrands, or peradventure they were gone to some
other place, for wee could see none, but the Inhabitants of the next
villages (supposing that wee were Theeves by reason of the great
multitude) for the defence of their owne substance, and for the feare
that they were in, set great and mighty masties upon us, which they had
kept and nourished for the safety of their houses, who compassing us
round about leaped on every side, tearing us with their teeth, in such
sort that they pulled many of us to the ground: verily it was a
pittifull sight to see so many Dogs, some following such as flyed, some
invading such as stood still, some tearing those which lay prostrate,
but generally there were none which escaped cleare: Behold upon this
another danger ensued, the Inhabitants of the Towne stood in their
garrets and windowes, throwing great stones upon our heads, that wee
could not tell whether it were best for us to avoyd the gaping mouthes
of the Dogges at hand or the perill of the stones afarre, amongst whome
there was one that hurled a great flint upon a woman, which sate upon my
backe, who cryed out pitiously, desiring her husband to helpe her. Then
he (comming to succour and ayd his wife) beganne to speake in this sort:
Alas masters, what mean you to trouble us poore labouring men so
cruelly? What meane you to revenge your selves upon us, that doe you no
harme? What thinke you to gaine by us? You dwell not in Caves or Dennes:
you are no people barbarous, that you should delight in effusion of
humane blood. At these words the tempest of stones did cease, and the
storme of the Dogges vanished away. Then one (standing on the toppe of a
great Cypresse tree) spake unto us saying: Thinke you not masters that
we doe this to the intent to rifle or take away any of your goods, but
for the safeguard of our selves and family: now a Gods name you may
depart away. So we went forward, some wounded with stones, some bitten
with Dogs, but generally there was none which escaped free.
