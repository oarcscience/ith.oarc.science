<p>YOU wonderful little hair-dresser, who only ought to have goddesses' hair   to tend, Cypassis, whom in a stolen moment of delight I found by no means   unexpert, you who suit your mistress so well, and me better still, tell me   who has given our secret away? How did Corinna get wind of our clandestine   delights? Did I turn red? Did I let fall a single word that could have   betrayed our hidden pleasures a' Nay, didn't I swear that for a man to hanker   after a servant-girl he couldn't have all his wits about him.</p>   
<p>And yet the Thessalian hero burned with desire for the lovely Briseis, and   she was but a slave. No more than a slave was she, the priestess that cast   her lures about the King of Mycen&aelig;. Am I then greater than Achilles,   greater than the son of Tantalus? Shall I blush at what was deemed a fitting   portion for a king?</p>   
<p>Nevertheless, when she turned that angry look upon you, I saw you blush   red all over. I was not anything like so flustered. I, if you remember, swore   by great Venus herself that I was innocent. But you, my goddess, ordain that   this beneficent lie may be swept by the warm South over the Carpathian deep.</p>   
<p>In payment for these my services, my dusky Cypassis, grant me the sweet   pleasure of lying with you to-day. Why do you say no? Why, ungrateful girl,   why pretend you are afraid? It will be enough to have deserved well of one of   your masters. If you are silly enough to refuse, I shall confess all we have   done, I shall become my own accuser, and I shall tell your mistress-yes, I   shall, Cypassis--where and how often we have met, what we did, in how many   ways, And what they were.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
