This is Julian May's translation of Ovid's 'erotic' works: The Amores
(the Loves), Ars Amatoria (the Art of Love), Remedia Amoris (The Cure
for Love) and the fragmentary Medicamina Faciei Feminae (Women's Facial
Cosmetics). This version was published in 1930 in a 'limited' edition
with sensual art deco illustrations by Jean de Bosschere.

In the Amores, published about 18 BCE, Ovid portrays the evolution of an
affair with a married woman named Corinna. It is unclear as to whether
this is fictional or autobiographical, but it is obviously based on the
experiences of a sophisticated lover. The Ars Amatoria, published about
1 BCE, is a guidebook for seduction; it includes many tips and tricks
which would not be out of place in a modern dating manual, while giving
intimate vignettes of daily life in Ancient Rome. The first two books
are written from a male point of view; the last book, which was probably
written at a later date, is addressed to women. It is believed that this
work, which celebrates extramarital sex, was one of the reasons that
Ovid was banished by the Emperor Augustus, who was attempting to promote
a more austere morality.

This edition has parallel Latin text (which was not included in the
original book).
