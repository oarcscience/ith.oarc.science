### DENIALS AND AFFIRMATIONS

(For Prosperity)

God is my unfailing supply, and large sums of money come to me quickly,
under grace, in perfect ways.

(For Right Conditions)

Every plan my Father in heaven has not planned, shall be dissolved and
dissipated, and the Divine Idea now comes to pass.

(For Right Conditions)

Only that which is true of God is true of me, for I and the Father are
ONE.

(For Faith)

As I am one with God, I am one with my good, for God is both the *Giver*
and the *Gift*. I cannot separate the *Giver* from the gift.

(For Right Conditions)

Divine Love now dissolves and dissipates every wrong condition in my
mind, body and affairs. Divine Love is the most powerful chemical in the
universe, and *dissolves everything* which is not of itself!

(For Health)

Divine Love floods my consciousness with health, and every cell in my
body is filled with light.

(For the Eyesight)

My eyes are God's eyes, I see with the eyes of spirit. I see clearly the
open way; there are no obstacles on my pathway. I see clearly the
perfect plan.

(For Guidance)

I am divinely sensitive to my intuitive leads, and give instant
obedience to Thy will.

(For the Hearing)

My ears are God's ears, I hear with the ears of spirit. I am
nonresistant and am willing to be led. I hear glad tidings of great joy.

(For Right Work)

*I have a perfect work  
In a perfect way;  
I give a perfect service  
For perfect pay*.

(For Freedom from all Bondage)

*I cast this burden on the Christ within, and I go free! *
