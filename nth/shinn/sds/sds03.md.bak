| "And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them"—Math. 25:2:3. |

</div>

 

My subject is the parable of the Wise and the Foolish Virgins. "And five
of them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish took
their lamps, and took no oil with them. But the wise took oil in their
vessels with their lamps." The parable teaches that true prayer means
preparation.

Jesus Christ said, "And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,
*believing*, ye shall receive" (Math. 21:22). "Therefore I say unto you,
what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive
them, and ye shall have them" (Mark 11:24). In this parable he shows
that only those who have prepared for their good (thereby showing active
faith) will bring the manifestation to pass.

We might paraphrase the scriptures and say: When ye pray believe ye have
it. When ye pray ACT as if you have already received.

*Armchair faith or rocking chair faith, will never move mountains*. In
the armchair, in the silence, or meditation, you are filled with the
wonder of this Truth, and feel that your faith will never waver. You
know that The Lord is your Shepherd, you shall never want.

You feel that your God of Plenty will wipe out all burdens of debt or
limitations. Then you leave your armchair and step out into the arena of
Life. It is only what you do in the arena that counts.

I will give you an illustration showing how the law works; for faith
without action is dead.

A man, one of my students, had a great desire to go abroad. He took the
statement: *I give thanks for my divinely designed trip, divinely
financed, under grace, in a perfect way*. He had very little money, but
knowing the law of preparation, he bought a trunk. It was a very gay and
happy trunk with a big red band around its waist. Whenever he looked at
it it gave him a realization of a trip. One day he seemed to feel his
room moving. He felt the motion of a ship. He went to the window to
breathe the fresh air, and it smelt like the aroma of the docks. With
his inner ear he heard the shriek of a sea-gull and the creaking of the
gangplank. The trunk had commenced to work. It had put him in the
vibration of his trip. Soon after that, a large sum of money came to him
and he took the trip. He said afterwards that it was perfect in every
detail.

In the arena of Life we must keep ourselves tuned-up to concert pitch.

Are we acting from motives of fear or faith? *Watch your motives with
all diligence, for out of them are the issues of life*.

If your problem is a financial one (and it usually is), you must know
how to wind yourself up financially, and keep wound up by always acting
your faith. The material attitude towards money is to trust in your
salary, your income and investments, which can shrink over night.

The spiritual attitude toward money is to trust in God for your supply.
To keep your possessions, always realize that they are God in
manifestation. "What Allah has given cannot be diminished," then if one
door shuts another door, immediately, opens.

Never voice lack or limitation for "by your words you are condemned."
You combine with what you notice, and if you are always noticing failure
and hard times, you will combine with failure and hard times.

You must form the habit of living in the fourth dimension, "The World of
the Wondrous." It is the world where you do not judge by appearances.

*You have trained your inner eye to see through failure into success, to
see through sickness into health to see through limitation into plenty*.
I will give you the land which your inner eye sees. "I will give to you
the land which thou seeth."

The man who achieves success has the *fixed idea of success*. If it is
founded on a rock of truth and rightness it will stand. If not, it is
built upon sand and washed into the sea, returning to its native
nothingness.

Only divine ideas can endure. Evil destroys itself, for it is a cross
current against universal order, and the way of the transgressor is
hard.

"They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them. But
the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps."

The lamp symbolizes man's consciousness. The oil is what brings Light or
understanding.

"While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at
midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out
to meet him. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. And
the foolish said unto the wise, Give us your oil; for our lamps are gone
out."

The foolish virgins were without wisdom or understanding, which is oil
for the consciousness, and when they were confronted with a serious
situation, they had no way of handling it.

And when they said to the wise "give us of your oil," the wise answered
saying, "Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye
rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves."

That means that the foolish virgins could *not receive more than was in
their consciousness*, or what they were vibrating to.

The man received the trip because it was in his consciousness, as a
reality. He believed that he had already received. As he prepared for
the trip he was taking oil for his lamps. With *realization comes
manifestation*.

The law of preparation works both ways. If you prepare for what you fear
or don't want, you begin to attract it. David said, "The thing I feared
has come upon me." We hear people say, "I must put away money in case of
illness." They are deliberately preparing to be ill. Or, "I'm saving for
a rainy day." The rainy day is sure to come, at a most inconvenient
time.

The divine idea for every man is plenty. Your barns *should be* full,
and your cup *should* flow over, but we must learn to ask aright.

For example take this statement: *I call on the law of accumulation. My
supply comes from God, and now pours in and piles up, under grace*.

This statement does not give any picture of stint or saving or sickness.
It gives a fourth dimensional feeling of abundance, leaving the channels
to Infinite Intelligence.

Every day you must make a choice, will you be wise or foolish? Will you
prepare for your good? Will you *take the giant swing into faith?* Or
serve doubt and fear and bring no oil for your lamps?

"And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were
ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. Afterward
came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he
answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not."

You may feel that the foolish virgins paid very dearly for neglecting to
bring oil for their lamps, but we are dealing with the law of Karma (or
the law of come back). It has been called the "judgement day," which
people usually associate with the end of the world.

Your judgement day comes, they say, in sevens—seven hours, seven days,
seven weeks, seven months, or seven years. It might even come in seven
minutes. Then you pay some Karmic debt; the price for having violated
spiritual law. *You failed to trust God, you took no oil for your
lamps*.

Every day examine your consciousness and see just what you are preparing
for. You are fearful of lack and hang on to every cent, thereby
attracting more lack. Use what you have with wisdom and it opens the way
for more to come to you.

In my book, "Your Word Is Your Wand," I tell about the Magic Purse. In
the Arabian Nights they tell the story of a man who had a Magic Purse.
As money went out, immediately money appeared in it again.

So I made the statement: *My supply comes from God—I have the magic
purse of the spirit. It can never be depleted. As money goes out,
immediately money comes in. It is always crammed, jammed with abundance,
under grace, in perfect ways*.

This brings a vivid picture to mind: You are drawing on the bank of the
imagination.

A woman who did not have much money was afraid to pay any bills and see
her bank account dwindle. It came to her with great conviction: "I have
the magic purse of the spirit. It can never be depleted. As money goes
out, immediately, money comes in." She fearlessly paid her bills, and
several large cheques came to her that she did not expect.

"Watch and pray lest ye enter into the temptation" of preparing for
something destructive instead of something constructive.

I knew a woman who told me she always kept a long crepe veil handy in
case of funerals. I said to her, "You are a menace to your relatives,
and are preparing to hurry them all off, so that you can wear the veil."
She destroyed it.

Another woman who had no money decided to send her two daughters to
college. Her husband scorned the idea and said, "Who will pay their
tuition? I have no money for it." She replied, "I know some *unforeseen
good will come to us*." She kept on preparing her daughters for college.
Her husband laughed heartily and told all their friends that his wife
was sending the girls to college on "some unforeseen good." A rich
relative suddenly sent her a large sum of money. "Some unforeseen good"
*did* arrive, for she had shown active faith. I asked what she had said
to her husband when the cheque arrived. She replied, "Oh, I never
antagonize George by telling him I am in the right."

So prepare for your "unforeseen good." Let every thought and every act
express your unwavering faith. Every event in your life is a
crystallized idea. Something you have invited through either fear or
faith. *Something you have prepared for*.

So let us be wise and bring oil for our lamps—and when we least expect
it, we shall reap the fruits of our faith.

 

*My lamps are now filled with the oil of faith and fulfillment*.
