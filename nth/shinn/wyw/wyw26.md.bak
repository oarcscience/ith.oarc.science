Intangible Textual Heritage

### THE ELEMENTS

Man is made in God's likeness and image (Imagination) and is given power
and dominion over all created things.

He has power to "rebuke the winds and the waves," check floods or bring
rain when it is needed.

There is a tribe of American Indians who live in the desert country and
depend on the power of prayer only, to bring rain to water their crops.

They have a rain dance, which is a form of prayer, but no chief is
allowed to take part who has any fear.

They give exhibitions of courage before they are admitted to the
ceremonies.

A woman, who was an eye-witness, told me that out of a blue sky came *a
deluge of rain; the sun still shining*.

### FIRE

#### AFFIRMATION

Fire is man's friend and is always in its right place doing its right
work.

### DROUGHT

#### AFFIRMATION

There is no drought in Divine Mind. I give thanks for the right amount
of rain to nourish these crops or garden.

I see clearly this gentle downpour and the manifestation is *now*.

———

### STORMS

#### AFFIRMATION

The Christ within now rebukes the winds and the waves and there comes a
great calm.

I see clearly peace established on land and sea.
