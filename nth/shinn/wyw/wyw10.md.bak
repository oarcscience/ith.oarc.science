### LOSS

If man loses anything it shows there is a belief of loss in his
subconscious mind. As he erases this false belief, the article, or its
equivalent will appear on the external.

For example: A woman lost a silver pencil in a theatre. She made every
effort to find it but it was not returned.

She denied loss, taking the affirmation: "I deny loss, there is no loss
in Divine Mind, therefore I cannot lose that pencil. I will receive it
or its equivalent."

Several weeks elapsed. One day she was with a friend who wore about her
neck on a cord, a beautiful gold pencil, who turned to her and said: "Do
you want this pencil? I paid fifty dollars for it at Tiffany's."

The woman was aghast, and replied (almost forgetting to thank her
friend) "Oh! God aren't you wonderful! The silver pencil wasn't good
enough for me!"

Man can only lose what doesn't belong to him by Divine Right, or isn't
good enough for him.

#### AFFIRMATIONS

There is no loss in Divine Mind, therefore, I cannot lose anything that
is rightfully mine.

Infinite Intelligence is never too late! Infinite Intelligence knows the
way of recovery.

———

There is no loss in Divine Mind, therefore, I cannot lose anything which
belongs to me.

It will be restored or I receive its equivalent.
