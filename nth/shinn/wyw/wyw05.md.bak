### LOVE

With love usually comes terrific fear. Nearly every woman comes into the
world with a mythical woman in the back of her mind who is to rob her of
her love.

She has been called "the other woman." Of course it comes from woman's
belief in duality. So long as she visualizes interference, it will come.

It is usually very difficult for a woman to see herself loved by the man
she loves, so these affirmations are to impress the truth of the
situation upon her subconscious mind, for in reality there is *only
oneness*.

(See *The Game of Life and How to Play It*.)

#### AFFIRMATIONS

As I am one with God, the Undivided One, I am one with my undivided love
and undivided happiness.

———

The Light of the Christ within now wipes out all fear, doubt, anger and
resentment. God's love pours through me, an irresistible magnetic
current. I see only perfection and draw to me my own.

———

Divine Love, through me, now dissolves all seeming obstacles and makes
clear, easy and successful my way.

———

I love everyone and everyone loves me. My apparent enemy becomes my
friend, a golden link in the chain of my good.

———

I am at peace with myself and with the whole world. I love everyone and
everyone loves me.

*The flood gates of my good now open*.
