### HEALTH

When man is harmonious and happy he is healthy! All sickness comes from
sin or violation of Spiritual Law.

Jesus Christ said: "Be thou healed, your sins are forgiven."

Resentment, ill-will, hate, fear, etc., etc., tear down the cells of the
body and poison the blood. (See *The Game of Life and How to Play It*.)

Accidents, old age and death itself, come from holding wrong mental
pictures.

When man sees himself as God sees him, he will become a radiant being,
timeless, birthless and deathless, for "God made man in His likeness and
in His image."

#### AFFIRMATIONS

I deny fatigue, for there is nothing to tire me. I live in the Kingdom
of eternal joy and absorbing interests.

My body is "the body electric," timeless and tireless, birthless and
deathless.

Time and space are obliterated!

———

I live in the wonderful now, birthless and deathless!

I am one with *The One!* 

———

Thou in me art:

Eternal joy.  
Eternal youth.  
Eternal wealth.  
Eternal health.  
Eternal love.  
Eternal life.

———

I am a Spiritual Being—my body is perfect, made in His likeness and
image.

The Light of the Christ now streams through every cell. I give thanks
for my radiant health.
