### WORDS OF WISDOM

———

#### AFFIRMATIONS

"Faith without nerve is dead."

———

There is never a slip ’twixt the right cup and the right lip.

———

Never look or you'd never leap.

———

God works in unexpected places, through unexpected people, at unexpected
times, His wonders to perform.

———

Power moves but is never moved.

———

Loving your neighbor means not to limit your neighbor in word, thought
or deed.

———

"Never argue with a hunch."

———

Christopher Columbus followed a hunch.

———

The Kingdom of Heaven is the realm of perfect ideas.

———

It is dark before the dawn but the dawn never fails. Trust in the dawn.

———

When in doubt play trumps, *do the fearless thing*.

———

It is the fearless things that count.

———

Never do today what intuition says to do tomorrow.

———

It's a great life if you don't reason.

———

Regard your neighbor as yourself.

———

Never hinder another's hunch.

———

Selfishness binds and blocks. Every loving and unselfish thought has in
it the germ of success.

———

Be not weary of make-believing. When you least expect it you shall reap.

———

Faith is elastic. Stretch it to the end of your demonstration.

———

Before you call you are answered, for the supply precedes the demand.

———

What you do for others you are doing for yourself.

———

Every act committed while angry or resentful brings unhappy reaction.

———

Sorrow and disappointment follow in the wake of deceit and subterfuge.
The way of the transgressor is hard. "No good thing will be withheld
from him who *walks uprightly*."

———

There is no power in evil. It is nothing; therefore can only come to
nothing.

———

Fear and impatience demagnetize. Poise magnetizes.

———

Drown the reasoning mind with your affirmation. Jehoshaphat clapped his
cymbals so that he wouldn't hear himself think.

———

All bondage is an illusion of the race consciousness. There is always a
way out of every situation, under grace. Every man is free to do the
will of God.

———

Sure-ism is stronger than Optimism.

———

"Divine ideas never conflict."

———

It is dangerous to stop in the middle of a *hunch*.

*Infinite Spirit* is never too late.
