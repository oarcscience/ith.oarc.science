<p></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE ELEMENTS</h3>  
<p>Man is made in God's likeness and image (Imagination) and is given power and dominion over all created things.</p>  
<p>He has power to "rebuke the winds and the waves," check floods or bring rain when it is needed.</p>  
<p>There is a tribe of American Indians who live in the desert country and depend on the power of prayer only, to bring rain to water their crops.</p>  
<p>They have a rain dance, which is a form of prayer, but no chief is allowed to take part who has any fear.</p>  
<p>They give exhibitions of courage before they are admitted to the ceremonies.</p>  
<p align="justify'">A woman, who was an eye-witness, told me that out of a blue sky came <i>a deluge of rain; the sun still shining</i>.</p>  
<p></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">FIRE</h3>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATION</h4>  
<p>Fire is man's friend and is always in its right place doing its right work.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">DROUGHT</h3>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATION</h4>  
<p>There is no drought in Divine Mind. I give thanks for the right amount of rain to nourish these crops or garden.</p>  
<p>I see clearly this gentle downpour and the manifestation is <i>now</i>.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">STORMS</h3>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATION</h4>  
<p>The Christ within now rebukes the winds and the waves and there comes a great calm.</p>  
<p>I see clearly peace established on land and sea.</p>
