*Your Word is Your Wand*, by Florence Scovel Shinn, \[1928\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing is too good  
to be true

Nothing is too wonderful  
to happen

Nothing is too good  
to last

### CONCLUSION

Choose the affirmation which appeals to you the most and *wave it over
the situation which confronts you*.

It is your *magic wand*, for your *word* is God in *action*.

"It shall not return unto me void but shall accomplish that whereunto it
is sent." (Isaiah 55-11.)

"But I say, have they not heard? Yes, verily, their sound went into all
the earth and *their words unto the end of the world*." (Romans 10-18.)
