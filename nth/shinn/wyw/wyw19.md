### EYES

(*Imperfect vision. Correspondences—Fear, suspicion, seeing obstacles.
Watching for unhappy events to come to pass—living in the past or
future—not living in the NOW*.)

———

#### AFFIRMATIONS

The Light of the Christ now floods my eyeballs. I have the crystal clear
vision of the Spirit. I see clearly and distinctly there are no
obstacles on my pathway. I see clearly the fulfillment of my heart's
desire.

———

I have the X-ray eye of the Spirit. I see through apparent obstacles. I
see clearly the miracle come to pass.

———

I have the crystal clear vision of the Spirit, I see clearly the open
road. There are no obstacles on my pathway. I now see miracles and
wonders come to pass.

———

I give thanks for my perfect sight. I see God in every face, I see good
in every situation.

———

I have the crystal clear vision of the Spirit. I look up and down and
all around, for my good comes from North, South, East and West.

———

My eyes are God's eyes, perfect and flawless. The Light of the Christ
floods my eyeballs and streams on my pathway. I see clearly there are no
lions on my way, only angels and endless blessings.
