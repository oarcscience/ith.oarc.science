### DEBT

If a man is in debt or people owe him money, it shows that a belief of
debt is in his subconscious mind.

This belief must be neutralized in order to change conditions.

For example: A woman came to me saying a man had owed her a thousand
dollars for years which she could not compel him to pay.

I said: "You must work on yourself, not the man," and gave her this
statement: "I deny debt, there is no debt in Divine Mind, no man owes me
anything, all is squared. I send that man love and forgiveness."

In a few weeks she received a letter from him saying he intended sending
the money and in about a month came the thousand dollars.

If the student owes money, change the statement: "There is no debt in
Divine Mind, therefore, I owe no man anything, all is *squared*.

All my obligations are now wiped out, under grace in a perfect way."

#### AFFIRMATIONS

I deny debt, there is no debt in Divine Mind, therefore, I owe no man
anything.

All obligations are now wiped out under grace in a miraculous way.

———

I deny debt, there is no debt in Divine Mind, no man owes me anything,
all is squared. I send forth love and forgiveness.
