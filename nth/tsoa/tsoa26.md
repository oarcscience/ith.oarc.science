### The Master of Your Fate

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">

"A craven hung along the battle's edge,  
 And thought, 'Had I a sword of keener steel  
 That blue blade that the king's son bears,—but this blunt thing—!'  
 And lowering crept away and left the field.  
 Then came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead  
 And weaponless, and saw the broken sword,  
 And ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout  
 Lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down,  
 And saved a great cause that heroic day."

Sill</span>. <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7)

<span class="smallcaps">Where</span> will you be at 65? Five men in six
at the age of 65 are living on charity. Just one in twenty is able to
live without working at 65.

That is what the American Bankers Association found when it took one
hundred

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

healthy men at 25 and traced them to 65.

These hundred were healthy to start with. They all had the same chance
for success. The difference lay in the way they used their MINDS.
Ninety-five out of one hundred just do the tasks that are set them. They
have no faith in themselves—no initiative—none of the courage that
starts things. They are always directed or controlled by someone else.

At 65, where will *you* be? Dependent or independent? Struggling for a
living—accepting charity from someone else—or at the top of the heap?

*“I am the Master of my fate.”*

Until you have learned that, you will never attain life's full success.
Your fate is in your own hands. You have the making of it. What you are
going to be

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

six months or a year from now depends upon what you think today.

So make your choice now:

Are you going to bow down to matter as the only power? Are you going to
look upon your environment as something that has been wished upon you
and for which you are in no way responsible? Or are you going to try to
realize in your daily life that matter is merely an aggregation of
protons and electrons subject entirely to the control of Mind, that your
environment, your success, your happiness, are all of your own making,
and that if you are not satisfied with conditions as they are, you have
but to visualize them as you would have them be in order to change them?

The former is the easier way right now—the easy way that leads to the
hell of poverty and fear and old age.

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

But the latter is the way that brings you to your Heart's Desire.

And merely because this Power of Universal Mind is invisible, is that
any reason to doubt it? The greatest powers of Nature are invisible.
Love is invisible, but what greater power is there in life? Joy is
invisible, happiness, peace, contentment. The radio is invisibles yet
you hear it. It is a product of the law governing sound waves. Law is
invisible, yet you see the manifestation of different laws every day. To
run a locomotive, you study the law of applying power, and you apply
that law when you make the locomotive go.

These things are not the result of invention. The law has existed from
the beginning. It merely waited for man to learn how to apply it. If man
had known how to call upon Universal Mind

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

to the right extent, he could have applied the law of sound waves, the
law of steam, ages ago. Invention is merely a revelation and an
unfoldment of Universal Wisdom.

That same Universal Wisdom knows millions of other laws of which man has
not even a glimmering. You can call upon It. You can use that Wisdom as
your own. By thinking of things as they might be instead of as they are,
you will eventually find some great Need. And to find a need is the
first step towards finding the supply to satisfy that need. You've got
to know what you are after, before you can send the Genie-of-your-Mind
a-seeking of it in Universal Mind.

*The Acre of Diamonds*

You remember the story of the poor Boer farmer who struggled for years
to

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

glean a livelihood out of his rocky soil, only to give it up in despair
and go off to seek his fortune elsewhere. Years later, coming back to
his old farm, he found it swarming with machinery and life—more wealth
being dug out of it every day than he had ever dreamed existed. It was
the great Kimberley Diamond Mine!

Most of us are like that poor Boer farmer. We struggle along under our
surface power, never dreaming of the giant power that could be ours if
we would but dig a little deeper—rouse that great Inner Self who can
give us more even than any acre of diamonds.

As Orison Swett Marden put it:

“The majority of failures in life are simply the victims of their mental
defeats. Their conviction that they cannot succeed as others do robs
them of that vigor

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

and determination which self-confidence imparts, and they don't even
half try to succeed.

“There is no philosophy by which a man can do a thing when he thinks he
can't. The reason why millions of men are plodding along in mediocrity
today, many of them barely making a living, when they have the ability
to do something infinitely bigger, is because they lack confidence in
themselves. They don't believe they can do the bigger thing that would
lift them out of their rut of mediocrity and poverty; they are not
winners mentally.

“The way always opens for the determined soul, the man of faith and
courage.

“It is the victorious mental attitude, the consciousness of power, the
sense of mastership, that does the big things in

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

this world. If you haven't this attitude, if you lack self-confidence,
begin now to cultivate it.

“A highly magnetized piece of steel will attract and lift a piece of
unmagnetized steel ten times its own weight. Demagnetize that same piece
of steel and it will be powerless to attract or lift even a feather's
weight.

“Now, my friends, there is the same difference between the man who is
highly magnetized by a sublime faith in himself, and the man who is
de-magnetized by his lack of faith, his doubts, his fears, that there is
between the magnetized and the de-magnetized pieces of steel. If two men
of equal ability, one *magnetized by a divine self-confidence*, the
other demagnetized by fear and doubt, are given similar tasks, one will
succeed and the other will fail. The self-confidence of

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

the one *multiplies his powers a hundred-fold;* the lack of it subtracts
a hundred-fold from the power of the other."

Have you ever thought how much of your time is spent in choosing what
you shall do, which task you will try, which way you shall go? Every day
is a day of decision. We are constantly at crossroads, in our business
dealings, our social relations, in our homes, there is always the
necessity of a choice. How important then that we have faith in
ourselves and in that Infinite intelligence within. "Commit thy works
unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established." "In all thy ways
acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."

In this ever-changing material age, with seemingly complex forces all
about us, we sometimes cry out that we are driven by force of
circumstances. Yet

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

the fact remains that we do those things which we choose to do. For even
though we may not wish to go a certain way, we allow ourselves to pursue
it because it offers the least resistance.

"To every man there openeth  
 A way, and ways, and a way.  
 And the high soul climbs the high way,  
 And the low soul gropes the low:  
 And in between, on the misty flats,  
 The rest drift to and fro.  
 But to every man there openeth  
 A high way and a low, And every man decideth  
 The way his soul shall go."  
                      —<span class="smallcaps">John Oxenham</span>.

Now, how about you? Are you taking active control of your own thought?
Are you imaging upon your [subconscious](errata.htm#10) mind only such
things as you want to see realized? Are you thinking healthy thoughts,
happy thoughts, successful thoughts?

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

The difference between the successful man and the unsuccessful one is
not so much a matter of training or equipment. It is not a question of
opportunity or luck. It is just in the way they each of them look at
things.

The successful man sees an opportunity, seizes upon it, and moves upward
another rung on the ladder of success. It never occurs to him that he
may fail. He sees only the opportunity, he visions what he can do with
it, and all the forces within and without him combine to help him win.

The unsuccessful man sees the same opportunity, he wishes that he could
take advantage of it, but he is fearful that his ability or his money or
his credit may not be equal to the task. He is like a timid bather,
putting in one foot and then drawing it swiftly back again—and

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

while he hesitates some bolder spirit dashes in and beats him to the
goal.

Nearly every man can look back—and not so far back either with must of
us—and say, "If I had taken that chance, I would be much better off
now."

You will never need to say it again, once you realize that the future is
entirely within your own control. It is not subject to the whims of
fortune or the capriciousness of luck. There is but one Universal Mind
and that mind contains naught but good. In it are no images of Evil.
From it comes no lack of supply. Its ideas are as numberless as the
grains of sand on the seashore. And those ideas comprise all wealth, all
power, all happiness.

You have only to image vividly enough on your subconscious mind the
thing you wish, to draw from Universal

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mind the necessary
ideas to bring it into being. You have only to keep in mind the
experiences you wish to meet, in order to control your own future.

When Frank A. Vanderlip, former President of the National City Bank, was
a struggling youngster, he asked a successful friend what one thing he
would urge a young man to do who was anxious to make his way in the
world. "Look as though you have already succeeded," his friend told him.
Shakespeare expresses the same thought in another way—"Assume a virtue
if you have it not." Look the part. Dress the part. Act the part. Be
successful in your own thought first. It won't be long before you will
be successful before the world as well.

David V. Bush, in his book "Applied Psychology and Scientific Living,"
says:

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

“Man is like the wireless operator. Man is subject to miscellaneous
wrong thought currents if his mind is not in tune with the Infinite, or
if he is not keyed up to higher vibrations than those of negation.

“A man who thinks courageous thoughts sends these courageous thought
waves through the universal ether until they lodge in the consciousness
of someone who is tuned to the same courageous key. Think a strong
thought, a courageous thought, a prosperity thought, and these thoughts
will be received by someone who is strong, courageous and prosperous.

“It is just as easy to think in terms of abundance as to think in terms
of poverty. If we think poverty thoughts we become the sending and
receiving stations for poverty thoughts. We send out

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

a 'poverty' mental wireless and it reaches the consciousness of some
poverty-stricken 'receiver.' We get what we think.

“It is just as easy to think in terms of abundance, opulence and
prosperity as it is to think in terms of lack. limitation and poverty.

“If a man will raise his rate of vibration by faith currents or hope
currents, these vibrations go through the Universal Mind and lodge in
the consciousness of people who are keyed to the same tune. Whatever you
think is sometime, somewhere, received by a person who is tuned to your
thought key.

“If a man is out of work and he thinks thoughts of success, prosperity,
harmony, position and growth, just as surely as his thoughts are
things—as Shakespeare says—someone will receive

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

his vibrations of success, prosperity, harmony, position and growth.

“If we are going to be timid, selfish, penurious and picayunish in our
thinking, these thought waves which we have started in the universal
ether will go forth until they come to a mental receiving station of the
same caliber. 'Birds of a feather flock together,' and minds of like
thinking are attracted one to the other.

“If you need money, all you have to do is to send up your vibrations to
a strong, courageous receiving station, and someone who can meet your
needs will be attracted to you or you to him.”

When you learn that you are entitled to win—in any right undertaking in
which you may be engaged—*you will win*. When you learn that you have a
right to a legitimate dominion over your

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

own affairs, *you will have dominion over them*. The promise is that we
can do all things through the Mind that was in Christ.

Universal Mind plays no favorites. No one human being has any more power
than any other. It is simply that few of us use the power that is in our
hands. The great men of the world are in no wise SUPER Beings. They are
ordinary creatures like you and me, who have stumbled upon the way of
drawing upon their subconscious mind—-and. through it upon the Universal
Mind. Speaking of Henry Ford's phenomenal success, his friend Thomas A.
Edison said of him—"He draws upon his subconscious mind."

The secret of being what you have it n you to be is simply this: Decide
now what it is you want of life, exactly what

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

you wish your future to be. Plan it out in detail. Vision it from start
to finish. See yourself as you are now, Being those things you have
always wanted to do. Make them REAL in your mind's eye—feel them, live
them, believe them, especially at the moment of going to sleep, when it
is easiest to reach your subconscious mind—and you will soon be seeing
them in real life.

It matters not whether you are young or old, rich or poor. The time to
begin is NOW. It is never too late. Remember those lines of
Appleton's: <span id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8)

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">

<div style="font-size: 90%;">

"I knew his face the moment that he passed  
 Triumphant in the thoughtless, cruel throng—  
 I gently touched his arm—he smiled at me—  
 He was the Man that Once I Meant to Be!

"Where I had failed, he'd won from life, Success;  
Where I had stumbled, with sure feet he stood; <span id="page_417">p.
417</span>  
 Alike—yet unalike—we faced the world,  
 And through the stress he found that life was good.  
 And I? The bitter wormwood in the glass,  
 The shadowed way along which failures pass!  
 Yet as I saw him thus, joy came to me—  
 He was the Man that Once I Meant to Be!

"We did not speak. But in his sapient eyes  
 I saw the spirit that had urged him on,  
 The courage that had held him through the fight  
 Had once been mine. I thought, 'Can it be gone?'  
 He felt that unasked question—felt it so  
 His pale lips formed the one-word answer, 'No!'  
       .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .  
 "Too late to win? No! Not too late for me—  
 He is the Man that Still I Mean to Be!"
