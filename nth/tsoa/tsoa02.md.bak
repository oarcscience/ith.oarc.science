<span class="smallcaps">If</span> you had more money than time, more
millions than you knew how to spend, what would be your pet
philanthropy? Libraries? Hospitals? Churches? Homes for the Blind,
Crippled or Aged?

Mine would be "Homes"—but not for the aged or infirm. *For young married
couples!*

I have often thought that, if ever I got into the "Philanthropic
Billionaire" class, I'd like to start an Endowment Fund for helping
young married couples over the rough spots in those first and second
years of married life—especially the second year, when the real troubles
come.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

Take a boy and a girl and a cozy little nest—add a cunning, healthy
baby—and there's nothing happier on God's green footstool.

But instead of a healthy babe, fill in a fretful, sickly baby—a wan,
tired, worn-out little mother—a worried, dejected, heart-sick father—and
there's nothing more pitiful.

A nurse for a month, a few weeks at the shore or mountains, a "lift" on
that heavy Doctor's bill—any one of these things would spell H-E-A-V-E-N
to that tiny family. But do they get it? Not often! And the reason?
Because they are not poor enough for charity. They are not rich enough
to afford it themselves. They belong to that great "Middle Class" which
has to bear the burdens of both the poor and the rich—and take what is
left for itself.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

It is to them that I should like to dedicate this book. If I cannot
endow Libraries or Colleges for them, perhaps I can point the way to get
all good gifts for themselves.

For men and women like them do not need "charity"—nor even sympathy.
What they do need is Inspiration—and Opportunity—the kind of Inspiration
that makes a man go out and create his own Opportunity.

And that, after all, is the greatest good one can do anyone. Few people
appreciate free gifts. They are like the man whom an admiring townsfolk
presented with a watch. He looked it over critically for a minute.
Then—"Where's the chain?" he asked.

But a way to win *for themselves* the full measure of success they've
dreamed of but almost stopped hoping for—*that* 

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

is something every young couple would welcome with open arms. And it is
something that, if I can do it justice, will make the "Eternal Triangle"
as rare as it is today common, for it will enable husband and wife to
work *together*—not merely for domestic happiness, but for business
success as well.
