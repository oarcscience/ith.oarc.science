### XII

### The Three Requisites

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">

                                   "Waste no tears  
 Upon the blotted record of lost years,  
 But turn the leaf, and smile, oh smile, to see  
 The fair white pages that remain for thee.

"Prate not of thy repentance. But believe  
 The spark divine dwells in thee: let it grow.  
 That which the upreaching spirit can achieve  
 The grand and all creative forces know;  
 They will assist and strengthen as the light  
 Lifts up the acorn to the oak-tree's height.  
 Thou hast but to resolve, and lo! God's whole  
 Great universe shall fortify thy soul."

<span class="smallcaps">Sometime</span> today or tomorrow or next month,
in practically every commercial office and manufacturing plant in the
United States, an important executive will sit back in his chair and
study a list of

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

names on a sheet of white paper before him.

Your name may be on it.

A position of responsibility is open and he is face to face with the
old, old problem—"Where can I find the man?"

The faces, the words, the work, the impressions of various men will pass
through his mind in quick review. What is the first question he will ask
concerning each?

"Which man is strongest on initiative, which one can best assume
responsibility?"

Other things being equal, THAT is the man who will get the job. For the
first requisite in business as in social life is confidence in
yourself—*knowledge of your power*. Given that, the second is
easy—initiative or *the courage to start things*. Lots of men have
ideas, but few

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

have the confidence in themselves or the courage to Start anything.

With belief and initiative, the third requisite follows almost as a
matter of course—*the faith to go ahead* and do things in the face of
all obstacles.

"Oh, God," said Leonardo da Vinci, "you sell us everything for the price
of an effort."

Certainly no one had a better chance to know than he. An illegitimate
son, brought up in the family of his father, the misfortune of his birth
made him the source of constant derision. He had to do something to lift
himself far above the crowd. And he did. "For the price of an effort" he
became the greatest artist in Italy—probably the greatest in the
world—in a day when Italy was famous for her artists. Kings and princes
felt honored at being associated

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

with this illegitimate boy. He made the name he had no right to famous
for his work alone.

"Work out your own salvation," said Paul. And the first requisite in
working it out is a knowledge of your power. "Every man of us has all
the centuries in him."—Morley. All the ages behind you have bequeathed
you stores of abilities which you are allowing to lie latent. Those
abilities are stored up in your subconscious mind. Call upon them. Use
them. As Whittier put it—

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">

<div style="font-size: 90%;">

"All the good the past has had  
 Remains to make our own time glad."

</div>

</div>

Are you an artist? The cunning of a da Vinci, the skill of a Rembrandt,
the vision of a Reynolds, is behind those fingers of yours. Use the
Genie-of-your-mind to call upon them.

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

Are you a surgeon, a lawyer, a minister, an engineer, a business man?
Keep before your mind's eye the biggest men who have ever done the
things you now are doing. Use them as your model. And not as your model
simply, but as your inspiration. Start in where they left off. Call upon
the innermost recesses of your subconscious mind, for their skill, their
judgment, their initiative. Realize that you have it in you to be as
great as they. Realize that all that they did, all that they learned,
all the skill they acquired is stored safely away in Universal Mind and
that through your subconscious mind you *have ready access to it*.

The mind in you is the same mind that animated all the great
[conquerors](errata.htm#8.md) of the past, all the great inventors, all the
great artists, statesmen, leaders, business men.

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> What they have
done is but a tithe of what still remains to do—of what men in your day
and your children's day will do. You can have a part in it. Stored away
within you is every power that any man or woman ever possessed. It
awaits only your call.

In "Thoughts on Business," we read: "It is a great day in a man's life
when he truly begins to discover himself. The latent capacities of every
man are greater than he realizes, and he may find them if he diligently
seeks for them. A man may own a tract of land for many years without
knowing its value. He may think of it as merely a pasture. But one day
he discovers evidences of coal and finds a rich vein beneath his land.
While mining and prospecting for coal he discovers deposits of granite.
In boring for water he strikes oil. Later he discovers a vein

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

of copper ore, and after that silver and gold. These things were there
all the time—even when he thought of his land merely as a pasture. But
they have a value only when they are discovered and utilized.

"Not every pasture contains deposits of silver and gold, neither oil nor
granite, nor even coal. But beneath the surface of every man there must
be, in the nature of things, a latent capacity greater than has yet been
discovered. And one discovery must lead to another until the man finds
the deep wealth of his own possibilities. History is full of the acts of
men who discovered somewhat of their own capacity; but history has yet
to record the man who fully discovered all that he might have been."

Everything that has been done, thought, gained, or been is in Universal
Mind.

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And you are a part
of Universal Mind. You have access to it. You can call upon it for all
you need in the same way you can go to your files or to a library for
information. If you can realize this fact, you will find in it the key
to the control of every circumstance, the solution of every problem, the
satisfaction of every right desire.

But to use that key, you've got to bear in mind the three requisites of
faith in your powers, initiative, and courage to start. "Who would stand
before a blackboard," says "Science and Health," "and pray the principle
of mathematics to solve the problem? The rule is already established,
and it is our task to work out the solution." In the same way, all
knowledge you can need is in Universal Mind, but it is up to you to tap
that mind.

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

And without the three requisites you will never do it.

Never let discouragement hold you back. Discouragement is the most
dangerous feeling there is, because it is the most insidious. Generally
it is looked upon as harmless, and for that very reason it is the more
sinister. For failure and success are oftentimes separated by only the
distance of that one word—Discouragement.

There is an old-time fable that the devil once held a sale and offered
all the tools of his trade to anyone who would pay their price. They
were spread out on the table, each one labeled—hatred, and malice, and
envy, and despair, and sickness, and sensuality—all the weapons that
everyone knows so well.

But off on one side, apart from the rest, lay a harmless looking,
wedge-shaped

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

instrument marked "Discouragement." It was old and worn looking, but it
was priced far above all the rest. When asked the reason why, the devil
replied:

"Because I can use this one so much more easily than the others. No one
knows that it belongs to me, so with it I can open doors that are tight
bolted against the others. Once I get inside I can use any tool that
suits me best."

No one ever knows how small is the margin between failure and success.
Frequently the two are separated only by the width of that one
word—*discouragement*. Ask Ford, ask Edison, ask any successful man and
he will tell you how narrow is the chasm that separates failure from
success, how surely it can be bridged by perseverance and faith.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

Cultivate confidence in yourself. Cultivate the feeling that you ARE
succeeding. Know that you have unlimited power to do every right thing.
Know that with Universal Mind to draw upon, no position is too
difficult, and no problem too hard. "He that believeth on me, the works
that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do."
When you put limitations upon yourself, when you doubt your ability to
meet any situation, you are placing a limit upon Universal Mind, for
"The Father that is within me, He doeth the works."

With that knowledge of your power, with that confidence in the unlimited
resources of Universal Mind, it is easy enough to show initiative, it is
easy enough to find the courage to start things.

You have a right to dominion over all

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

things—over your body, your environment, your business, your health.
Develop these three requisites and you will gain that dominion.

Remember that you are a part of Universal Mind, and that the part shares
every property of the whole. Remember that, as the spark of electricity
is to the thunderbolt, so is your mind to Universal Mind. Whatever of
good you may desire of life, whatever qualification, whatever position,
you have only to work for it whole heartedly, confidently, with
singleness of purpose—*and you can get it*.
