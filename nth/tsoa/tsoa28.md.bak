#### The Secret of Power

"The great were once as you.  
 They whom men magnify today  
 Once groped and blundered on life's way  
 Were fearful of themselves, and thought  
 By magic was men's greatness wrought.  
 They feared to try what they could do;  
 Yet Fame hath crowned with her success  
 The selfsame gifts that you possess."

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> is a woman in one of the big
Eastern cities whose husband died a year or two ago and left her nearly
$100,000,000. She has unlimited power in her hands—yet she uses none of
it. She has unlimited wealth—yet she gets no more from it

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

than if it were in the thousands instead of millions. She knows nothing
of her power, of her wealth. She is insane.

You have just as great power in your hands—without this poor woman's
excuse for not using it.

You have access to unlimited ideas, unlimited energy, unlimited wealth.
The "Open, Sesame!" is through your subconscious mind.

So long as you limit yourself to superficial conditions, so long as you
are a mere "hewer of wood or carrier of water" for those around you who
*do* use their minds, you are in no better position than the beasts of
burden.

The secret of power is in understanding the infinite resources of your
own mind. When you begin to realize that the power to do anything, to be
anything, to have anything, is within

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

yourself, then *and then only* will you take your proper place in the
world.

As Bruce Barton has it in "The Man Whom Nobody Knows"—

"Somewhere, at some [unforgettable](errata.htm#11.md) hour, the daring
filled His (Jesus) heart. He knew that He was bigger than Nazareth."

Again in speaking of Abraham Lincoln, Barton says—"Inside himself he
felt his power, but where and when would opportunity come?" And later in
the book—

"But to every man of vision the clear voice speaks. Nothing splendid has
ever been achieved except by those who dared believe that *something
inside them was superior to circumstance*."

No doubt Jesus’ friends and neighbors all ridiculed the idea of any such
power within Him. Just as most people

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

today laugh at the thought of a power such as that within themselves.

So they go on with their daily grind, with the gaunt spectres of
sickness and need ever by their side, until death comes as a welcome
relief. Are you going to be one of those? Or will you listen to that
inner consciousness of power and find .the "Kingdom of Heaven that is
within you." For whatever you become conscious of, will be quickly
brought forth into tangible form.

Don't judge your ability by what you have done in the past. Your work
heretofore has been done with the help of your conscious mind alone. Add
to that the infinite knowledge at the disposal of your subconscious
mind, and what you have done is as nothing to what you will do in the
future.

For knowledge does not apply itself.

<span id="page_431">p. 431</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is merely so
much static energy. You must convert it into dynamic energy by the power
of your thought. The difference between the $25-a-week clerk and the
$25,000-a-year executive is solely one of thought. The clerk may have
more brains than the executive—frequently has in actual weight of gray
matter. He may even have a far better education. But he doesn't know how
to apply his thought to get the greatest good from it.

If you have brains, *use* them. If you have skill, *apply* it. The world
must profit by it, and therefore you.

We all have inspired moments when we see clearly how we may do great
things, how we may accomplish wonderful undertakings. But we do not
believe in them enough to make them come true. An imagination which
begins

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

and ends in day-dreaming is weakening to character.

Make the day-dreams come true. Make them so clear and distinct that they
impress themselves upon your subconscious mind. There's nothing wrong
with day-dreaming, except that most of us stop there. We don't try to
make the dreams come true. The great inventor, Tesla, "dreams" every new
machine complete and perfect in every particular before ever he begins
his model for it. Mozart "dreamed" each of his wonderful symphonies
complete before ever he put a note on paper. But they didn't stop with
the dreaming. They visualized those dreams, *and then brought them into
actuality*.

We lose our capacity to have visions if we do not take steps to realize
them.

Power implies service, so concentrate

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

all your thought on making your visions of great deeds come true.
Thinking is the current that runs the dynamo of power. To connect up
this current so that you can draw upon universal supply through your
subconscious mind, is to become a Super-man. Do this, and you will have
found the key to the solution of every problem of life.
