<span class="smallcaps">You've</span> heard the story of the old man who
called his children to his bedside to give them a few parting words of
advice. And this was the burden of it.

"My children," he said, "I have had a great deal of trouble in my life—a
great deal of trouble—*but most of it never happened*."

We are all of us like that old man. Our troubles weigh us down—in
prospect—but we usually find that when the

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

actual need arrives, Providence has devised some way of meeting it.

Dr. Jacques Loeb, a member of the Rockefeller Institute, conducted a
series of tests with parasites found on plants, which show that even the
lowest order of creatures have the power to call upon Universal Supply
for the resources to meet any unusual need.

“In order to obtain the material," reads the report of the tests,
"potted rose bushes are brought into a room and placed in front of a
closed window. If the plants are allowed to dry out, the aphides
(parasites), previously wingless, change to winged insects. After the
metamorphosis, the animals leave the plants, fly to the window and then
creep upward on the glass.

“It is evident that these tiny insects found that the plants on which
they had

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

been thriving were dead, and that they could therefore secure nothing
more to eat and drink from this source. The only method by which they
could save themselves from starvation was to grow temporary wings and
fly, which they did.”

In short, when their source of sustenance was shut off and they had to
find the means of migrating or perish, Universal Supply furnished the
means for migration.

If Universal Mind can thus provide for the meanest of its creatures, is
it not logical to suppose that It will do even more for us—the highest
product of creation—if we will but call upon It, if we will but have a
little faith? Viewed in the light of Mind's response to the need of
those tiny parasites, does it seem so unbelievable that a sea should
roll back

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

while a people marched across it dry-shod? That a pillar of fire should
lead them through the wilderness by night? That manna should fall from
heaven, or water gush forth from a rock?

In moments of great peril, in times of extremity, when the brave soul
has staked its all—those are the times when miracles are wrought, if we
will but have faith.

That doesn't mean that you should rest supinely at your Base and let the
Lord provide. When you have done all that is in you to do—when you have
given of your best—don't worry or fret as to the outcome. Know that if
more is needed, your need will be met. You can sit back with the
confident assurance that having done your part, you can depend upon the
Genie-of-your-Mind to do the rest.

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

When the little state of Palestine was in danger of being overrun by
Egypt on the one hand, or gobbled up by Assyria on the other, its people
were frantically trying to decide which horn of the dilemma to embrace,
with which enemy they should ally themselves to stave off the other.
"With neither," the Prophet Isaiah told them, "in calmly resting your
safety lieth; in quiet trust shall be your strength."

So it is with most of the great calamities that afflict us. If we would
only "calmly rest, quietly trust," how much better off we should be. But
no—we must fret and worry, and nine times out of ten do the wrong thing.
And the more we worry and fret, the more likely we are to go wrong.

All of Universal Mind that is necessary to solve any given problem, to
meet

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

any need, is wherever that need may be. Supply is always *where* you are
and *what* you need. It matters not whether it be sickness or trouble,
poverty or danger, the remedy is there, waiting for your call. Go at
your difficulty boldly, knowing that you have infinite resources behind
you, and you will find these forces closing around you and coming to
your aid.

It's like an author writing a book. For a long time he works in a kind
of mental fog, but let him persevere, and there flashes suddenly a light
that clarifies his ideas and shows him the way to shape them logically.
At the moment of despair, you Peel a source of unknown energy arising in
your soul.

That doesn't mean that you will never have difficulties. Difficulties
are good for you. They are the exercise of your

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

mind. You are the stronger for having overcome them. But look upon them
as mere exercise. As "stunts" that are given you in order that you may
the better learn how to use your mind, how to draw upon Universal
Supply. Like Jacob wrestling with the Angel, don't let them go until
they have blessed you—until, in other words, you have learned something
from having encountered them.

Remember this: No matter how great a catastrophe may befall mankind, no
matter how general the loss, you and yours can be free from it. There is
always a way of safety. There is always an "ark" by which the
understanding few can be saved from the flood. The name of that ark is
Understanding—understanding of your inner powers.

When the children of Israel were being

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

led into the promised land, and Joshua had given them their directions,
they answered him: "All that thou commandest us we will do, and
whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.…Only the Lord thy God be with
thee, as He was with Moses."

They came to the river Jordan, and it seemed an insurmountable barrier
in their path, but Joshua commanded them to take the Ark of the
Covenant, representing God's understanding with them, before them into
the Jordan. They did it, and "the waters which came down from above
stood and rose up upon an heap.…And the priests that bare the Ark of the
Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan,
and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people
were passed clean over Jordan."

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

*The Ark of the Covenant*

All through the Old Testament, when war and pestilence, fire and flood,
were the common lot of mankind, there is constant assurance of safety
for those who have this understanding, this "Covenant" with the Lord.
"Because thou hast made the Lord which is my refuge—even the Most
High—thy habitation, there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any
plague come nigh thy dwelling. For He shall give His angels charge over
thee to keep thee in all thy ways."

That is His agreement with us—an agreement which gives us the
superiority to circumstances which men have sought from time immemorial.
All that is necessary on our side of the agreement is for us to remember
the infinite powers that reside within us, to remember that

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

our mind is part of Universal Mind and as such it can foresee, it can
guard against and it can protect us from harm of any kind. We need not
run away from trials or try to become stoical towards them. All we need
is to bring our understanding to bear upon them—to know that no
situation has ever yet arisen with which Universal Mind—and through it
our own mind—was not fully competent to deal. To know that the right
solution of every problem is in Universal Mind. That we have but to seek
that solution and our trial is overcome.

"But where shall Wisdom be found? And where is the place of
understanding? Acquaint now thyself with God, and be at peace."

If evil threatens us, if failure, sickness or accident seems imminent,
we have

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

only to decide that these evils do not come from Universal Mind,
therefore they are unreal and have no power over us. They are, simply
the absence of the right condition which Universal Mind knows. Refuse,
therefore, to see them, to acknowledge them—and seek through Mind for
the right condition which shall nullify them.

If you will do this, you will find that you can appropriate from Mind
whatever you require for your needs, when you require it. The greater
your need, the more surely it will be met, if you can but realize this
truth. "Fear not, little flock," said Jesus, "for it is your Father's
good pleasure to give you the Kingdom."

Remember that your thought is all-powerful. That it is creative. That
there is no limitation upon it of time or space. And that it is
ever-available.

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

Forget your worries. Forget your fears. In place of them, visualize the
conditions you would like to see. Realize their availability. Declare to
yourself that you already *have* all these things that you desire, that
your needs *have* been met. Say to yourself: "How thankful I am that
Mind has made all these good things available to me. I have everything
that heart could desire to be grateful for."

Every time you do this, you are impressing the thought upon your
subconscious mind. And the moment you can convince your subconscious
mind of the truth of it—*that moment* your mind will proceed to *make*
it true. This is the way to put into practice the Master's
advice—"Believe that ye RECEIVE it, and ye SHALL HAVE it."

There is no condition so hopeless, no

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

cause so far gone, that this truth will not save it. Time and again
patients given over by their doctors as doomed have made miraculous
recoveries through the faith of some loved one.

"I hope that everyone who reads this Book may gain as much from their
first reading as I did," writes a happy subscriber from New York City.
"I got such a clear understanding from that one reading that I was able
to break the mental chain holding a friend to a hospital bed, and she
left the hospital in three days, to the very great astonishment of the
doctors handling the case."

In the same way, there are innumerable instances where threatened
calamity has been warded off and good come instead. The great trouble
with most of us is, we do not *believe*. We insist upon looking for
trouble. We

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

feel that the "rainy day" is bound to come, and we do our utmost to make
it a surety by keeping it in our thoughts, preparing for it, fearing it.
"Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of
death but once." We cross our bridges a dozen times before we come to
them. We doubt ourselves, we doubt our ability, we doubt everyone and
everything around us. And our doubts sap our energy; kill our
enthusiasm; rob us of success. We are like the old lady who "enjoys poor
health." We always place that little word "but" after our wishes and
desires, feeling deep down that there are some things too good to be
true. We think there is a power apart from Good which can withhold
blessings that should be ours. We doubt, because we cannot see the way
by which our desires can be fulfilled. We put a

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

limit upon the good that can come to us.

"Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts," cried the Prophet
Malachi, "if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out
a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it… And all
nations shall call you blessed, for ye shall be a delightsome land."

*Your* mind is part of Universal Mind. And Universal Mind has all
supply. You are entitled to, and you can have, just as much of that
supply as you are able to appropriate. To expect less is to get less,
for it dwarfs your power of receiving.

It doesn't matter what your longings may be, provided they are right
longings. If your little son has his heart set on a train and you feel
perfectly able to

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

get him a train, you are not going to hand him a picture book instead.
It may be that the picture book would have greater educational value,
but the love you have for your son is going to make you try to satisfy
his longings as long as those longings are not harmful ones.

In the same way, Universal Mind will satisfy *your* longings, no matter
how trivial they may seem, as long as they are not harmful ones.
"Delight thyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of
thine heart."

If we would only try to realize that God is not some far-off Deity, not
some stern Judge, but the beneficent force that we recognize as
Nature—the life Principle that makes the flowers bud, and the plants
grow, that spreads abundance about us with lavish hand. If we could
realize that He is the Universal Mind

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

that holds all supply, that will give us the toy of our childhood or the
needs of maturity, that all we need to obtain from Him our Heart's
Desire is a right understanding of His availability—then we would lose
all our fears, all our worries, all our sense of limitation.

For Universal Mind is an infinite, unlimited source of good. Not only
the source of general good, but the specific good things you desire of
life. To It there is no big or little problem. The removal of mountains
is no more difficult than the feeding of a sparrow.

And to one—like the Master—with a perfect understanding, the "miracle"
of raising Lazarus from the dead required no more effort than the
turning of the water into wine. He knew that Universal Mind is all
power—and there can-not be more than ALL. He knew that

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "To know God
aright is life eternal." And Jesus knew God aright, so was able to
demonstrate this knowledge of life eternal in overcoming sin, disease
and death. For it is one and the same law that heals sin, sickness,
poverty, heartaches, or death itself. That law is the right
understanding of Divine Principle.

But what does this ability to perform "miracles" consist of? What is the
power or force by which we can prove this ability? Perhaps the simplest
way is to begin with the realization that Universal Mind is man's
working power.

*The Science of Thought*

Can you stretch your mind a bit and try to comprehend this wonderful
fact—that the ALL POWERFUL, ALL-KNOWING, EVERLASTING CREATOR and
Governor of the infinite universe,

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out
heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a
measure, and weighed the mountains, in scales, and the hills in a
balance," is your working power? In proportion as we understand this
fact, and make use of it, in that same proportion are we able to
per-form our miracles.

Your work is inspired to the extent that you realize the presence of
Universal Mind in your work. When you rely entirely on your own
conscious mind, your work suffers accordingly. "I can of mine own self
do nothing; for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the
same works that I do bear witness of me." The miracles of Jesus bear
witness of the complete recognition of God the Father as his working
power.

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

And mind you, this inspiration, this working of Universal Mind with you,
is available for all of your undertakings. Mind could not show Itself in
one part of your life and withhold Itself from another, since It is all
in all. Every rightly directed task, no matter how insignificant or
menial it may appear to you, carries with it the inspiration of
Universal Mind, since by the very nature of omnipotence, Its love and
bestowals must be universal and impartial, "and whatsoever ye do, do it
heartily as to the Lord."

Too many of us are like the maiden in the old Eastern legend. A
[Genie](errata.htm#9.md) sent her into a field of grain, promising her a
rare gift if she would pick for him the largest and ripest ear she could
find. His gift to be in proportion to the size and perfection of the
ear.

But he made this condition—she must

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

pluck but one ear, and she must walk straight through the field without
stopping, going back or wandering hither and thither.

Joyously she started. As she walked through the grain, she saw many
large ears, many perfect ones. She passed them by in scorn, thinking to
find an extra-large, super-perfect one farther along. Presently,
however, the soil became less fertile, the ears small and sparse. She
couldn't pick one of these! Would now that she had been content with an
ordinary-sized ear farther back. But it was too late for that. Surely
they would grow better again farther on!

She walked on—and on—and always they became worse—‘till presently she
found herself at the end of the field—*empty handed as when she set
out!*

So it is with life. Every day has its

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

worth-while rewards for work well done. Every day offers its chance for
happiness. But those rewards seem so small, those chances so petty,
compared with the big things we see ahead. So we pass them by, never
recognizing that the great position we look forward to, the shining
prize we see in the distance, is just the sum of all the little tasks,
the heaped up result of all the little prizes that we must win as we go
along.

You are not commanded to pick out certain occupations as being more
entitled to the Lord's consideration than others, but "Whatsoever ye
do." Whether it be in the exalted and idealistic realms of poetry, music
and art, whether in the cause of religion or philanthropy, whether in
government, in business, in science, or simply in household cares,
"whatsoever ye do" you are entitled to, and have

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

all of inspiration at your beck and call. If you seem to have less than
all, it is because you do not utilize your gift.

"Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one; and every man shall
receive his own reward according to his own labour. For we are labourers
together with God." "All things are yours; and ye are Christ's and
Christ's is God's."

How shall you take advantage of this Universal Supply? When next any
need confronts you, when next you are in difficulties, close your eyes
for a moment and realize that Universal Mind knows how that need can
best be met, knows the solution of your difficulties. And that your
sub-conscious mind, being part of the Universal Mind, can know this,
too. So put your problem up to your subconscious mind with the sublime
confidence

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

that it will find the solution. Then forget it for a while. When the
time comes, the need will be met.

Dr. Winbigler corroborates the working out of this idea in the
following:

"Suggestions lodged in the mind can effect a complete change, morally
and physically. If mankind would become in spirit 'as a little child,'
trusting in God implicitly, the greatest power would utilized in the
establishment of health and equilibrium, and the results would be untold
in comfort, sanity, and blessing. For instance, here is one who is
suffering from worry, fear, and the vexations of life. How can he get
rid of these things and relieve this suffering? Let him go to a quiet
room or place, twice a day, lie down and relax every muscle, assume
complete indifference to those things which worry him and the functions
of

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

the body, and quietly accept what God, through this law of demand and
supply, can give. In a few days he will find a great change in his
feelings, and the sufferings will pass away and life will look bright
and promising. Infinite wisdom has established that law; and its
utilization by those who are worried and fearful will secure amazing
results in a short time.

"The real reason for the change is found in the possibility of recovery
by using the laws that God has placed within our reach, and thus
securing the coveted health and power for all that we want and ought to
do. The subliminal life is the connecting link between man and God, and
by obeying His laws, one's life is put in contact with infinite
resources and all that God is able and willing to give. Here is the
secret of all

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

the cures of disease, and the foundation for the possibility of a joyful
existence, happiness and eternal life. Suggestion is the method of
securing what God gives, and the mind is the agent through which these
gifts are received. This is not a matter of theory, but a fact. If any
one who is sick or who desires to be kept well will have stated periods
of relaxation, openmindedness, and faith, he can prove the beneficial
and unvarying result of this method."
