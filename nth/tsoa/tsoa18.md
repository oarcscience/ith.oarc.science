### IX

### The Formula of Success

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">

"One ship drives east, and another drives west,  
   With the self-same winds that blow.  
 ’Tis the set of the sails, and not the gales  
   Which tells us the way they go.

"Like the waves of the sea are the ways of fate  
   As we voyage along thru life.  
 ’Tis the set of the soul which decides its goal  
   And not the calm or the strife."

<span class="smallcaps">What</span> is the eternal question which stands
up and looks you and every sincere man squarely in the eye every
morning?

"How can I better my condition?" That is the real life question which
con-fronts you, and will haunt you every day till you solve it.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

Read this chapter carefully and I think you will find the answer to this
important life question which you and every man must solve if he expects
ever to have more each Monday morning, after pay day, than he had the
week before.

To begin with, all wealth depends upon a clear understanding of the fact
that mind—thought—is the only creator. The great business of life is
thinking. Control your thoughts and you control circumstance.

Just as the first law of gain is desire, so the formula of success is
BELIEF. Believe that you have it—see it as an existent fact—and anything
you can rightly wish for is yours. Belief is "the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."

You have seen men, inwardly no more capable than yourself, accomplish
the

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

seemingly impossible. You. have seen others, after years of hopeless
struggle, suddenly win their most cherished dreams. And you've often
wondered, "What is the power that gives new life to their dying
ambitions, that supplies new impetus to their jaded desires, that gives
them a new Start on the road to success?"

That power is belief—faith. Someone, something, gave them a new belief
in themselves and a new faith in their power to win—and they leaped
ahead and wrested success from seemingly certain defeat.

Do you remember the picture Harold Lloyd was in two or three years ago,
showing a country boy who was afraid of his shadow? Every boy in the
countryside bedeviled him. Until one day his grandmother gave him a
talisman

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

that she assured him his grandfather had carried through the Civil War
and which, so she said, had the property of making its owner invincible.
Nothing could hurt him, she told him, while he wore this talisman.
Nothing could stand up against him. He believed her. And the next time
the bully of the town started to cuff him around, he wiped up the earth
with him. And that was only the start. Before the year was out he had
made a reputation as the most daring soul in the community.

Then, when his grandmother felt that he was thoroughly cured, she told
him the truth—that the "talisman" was merely a piece of old junk she'd
picked up by the roadside—that she knew all he needed was *faith in
himself*, belief that he could do these things.

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

*The Talisman of Napoleon*

Stories like that are common. It is such a well-established truth that
you can do only what you think you can, that the theme is a favorite one
with authors. I remember reading a story years ago of an artist—a
mediocre sort of artist—who was visiting the field of Waterloo and
happened upon a curious lump of metal half buried in the dirt, which so
attracted him that he picked it up and put it in his pocket. Soon
thereafter he noticed a sudden increase in confidence, an absolute faith
in himself, not only as to his own Chosen line of work, but in his
ability to handle any situation that might present itself. He painted a
great picture—just to show that he could do it. Not content with that,
he visioned an empire with Mexico as its basis, actually

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

led a revolt that carried all before it—until one day he lost his
talisman. *And immediately his bubble burst*.

I instance this just to illustrate the point that it is *your own belief
in yourself* that counts. It is the consciousness of dominant power
within you that makes all things attainable. *You can do anything you
think you can*. This knowledge is literally the gift of the gods, for
through it you can solve every human problem. It should make of you an
incurable optimist. It is the open door to welfare. *Keep it open*—by
expecting to gain everything that is right.

You are entitled to every good thing. Therefore expect nothing but good.
Defeat does not *need* to follow victory. You don't have to "knock wood"
every time you congratulate yourself that things have been going well
with you.

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Victory should
follow victory—and it will if you "let this mind be in you which was
also in Christ Jesus." It is the mind that means health and life and
boundless opportunity and recompense. No limitation rests upon you. So
don't let any enter your life. Remember that Mind will do every good
thing for you. It will remove mountains for you.

"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, and prove me now herewith,
saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven,
and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to
receive it."

Bring all your thoughts, your desires, your aims, your talents, into the
Storehouse—the Consciousness of Good, the Law of Infinite supply—and
prove these blessings. There is every reason to know that you are
entitled to adequate provision.

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Everything that is
involved in supply is a thing of thought. *Now reach out, stretch your
mind, try to comprehend unlimited thought, unlimited supply*.

Do not think that supply must come through one or two channels. It is
not for you to dictate to Universal Mind the means through which It
shall send Its gifts to you. There are millions of channels through
which It can reach you. Your part is to impress upon Mind your need,
your earnest desire, your boundless belief in the resources and the
willingness of Universal Mind to help you. Plant the seed of desire.
Nourish it with a clear visualization of the ripened fruit. Water it
with sincere faith. But leave the means to Universal Mind.

Open up your mind. Clear out the channels of thought. Keep yourself in

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

a state of receptivity. Gain a mental attitude in which you are
constantly *expecting good*. You have the fundamental right to all good,
you know. "According to your faith, be it unto you."

The trouble with most of us is that we are mentally lazy. It is so much
easier to go along with the crowd than to break trail for ourselves. But
the great discoverers, the great inventors, the great geniuses in all
lines have been men who dared to break with tradition, who defied
precedent, who believed that there is no limit to what Mind can do—and
who stuck to that belief until their goal was won, in spite. of all the
sneers and ridicule of the wiseacres and the "It-can't-be-done’rs."

Not only that, but they were never satisfied with achieving just one
success. They knew that the first success is like

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

the first olive out of the bottle. All the others come out the more
easily for it. They realized that they were a part of the Creative
Intelligence of the Universe, and that the part shares all the
properties of the whole. And that realization gave them the faith to
strive for any right thing, the knowledge that the only limit upon their
capabilities was the limit of their desires. Knowing that, they couldn't
be satisfied with any ordinary success. They had to keep on and on and
on.

Edison didn't sit down and fold his hands when he gave us the talking
machine. Or the electric light. These great achievements merely opened
the way to new fields of accomplishment.

Open up the channels between your mind and Universal Mind, and there is
no limit to the riches that will come

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

pouring in. Concentrate your thoughts on the particular thing you are
most interested in, and ideas in abundance will come flooding down,
opening up a dozen ways of winning the goal you are striving for.

But don't let one success—no matter how great—satisfy you. The Law of
Creation, you know, is the Law of Growth. You can't stand still. You
must go forward—or be passed by. Complacency—self-satisfaction—is the
greatest enemy of achievement. You must keep looking forward. Like
Alexander, you must be constantly seeking new worlds to conquer. Depend
upon it, the power will come to meet the need. There is no such thing as
failing powers, if we look to Mind for our source of supply. The only
failure of mind comes from worry and fear—or from disuse.

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

William James, the famous psychologist, taught that "The more mind does,
the more it can do." For ideas release energy. You can *do* more and
better work than you have ever done. You can *know* more than you know
now. You know from your own experience that under proper mental
conditions of joy or enthusiasm, you can do three or four times the work
without fatigue that you can ordinarily. Tiredness is more boredom than
actual physical fatigue. You can work almost indefinitely when the work
is a pleasure.

You've seen sickly persons, frail persons, who couldn't do an hour's
light work without exhaustion, suddenly buckle down when heavy
responsibilities were thrown upon them, and grow strong and rugged under
the load. Crises not only draw upon the reserve

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

power you have, but they help to create new power:

*“It Couldn't Be Done”*

It may be that you have been deluded by the thought of incompetence. It
may be that you have been told so often that you cannot do certain
things that you've come to believe you can't. Remember that success or
failure is merely a state of mind. Believe you cannot do a thing—and you
can't. Know that you *can* do it—and you *will*. You must *see yourself
doing it*.

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">

<div style="font-size: 90%;">

"If you think you are beaten, you are;  
   If you think you dare not, you don't;  
 If you'd like to win, but you think you can't,  
   It's almost a cinch you won't;  
 If you think you'll lose, you've lost,  
   For out in the world you'll find  
 Success begins with a fellow's will—  
   It's all in the state of mind.

</div>

</div>

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">

<div style="font-size: 90%;">

"Full many a race is lost  
   Ere even a race is run,  
 And many a coward fails  
   Ere even his work's begun.  
 Think big, and your deeds will grow,  
   Think small and you fall behind,  
 Think that you can, and you will;  
   It's all in the state of mind.

 "If you think you are outclassed, you are;  
   You've got to think high to rise;  
 You've got to be sure of yourself before  
   You can ever win a prize.  
 Life's battle doesn't always go  
   To the stronger or faster man;  
 But sooner or later, the man who wins  
   Is the fellow who thinks he can."

</div>

There's a vast difference between a proper understanding of one's own
ability and a determination to make the best of it—and offensive
egotism. It is absolutely necessary for every man to believe in himself,
before he can make the most of himself. All of us have something

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

to sell. It may be our goods, it may be our abilities, it may be our
services. You've got to believe in yourself to make your buyer take
stock in you at par and accrued interest. You've got to feel the same
personal solicitude over a customer lost, as a revivalist over a
backslider, and hold special services to bring him back into the fold.
You've got to get up every morning with determination, if you're going
to go to bed that night with satisfaction.

There's mighty sound sense in the saying that all the world loves a
booster. The one and only thing you have to win success with is MIND.
For your mind to function at its highest capacity, you've got to be
charged with good cheer and optimism. No one ever did a good piece of
work while in a negative frame of mind. Your best work is always done

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

when you are feeling happy and optimistic.

And a happy disposition is the *result*—not the *cause*—of happy, cheery
thinking. Health and prosperity are the *results* primarily of
optimistic thoughts. *You* make the pattern. If the impress you have
left on the world about you seems faint and weak, don't blame fate—blame
your pattern! You will never cultivate a brave, courageous demeanor by
thinking cowardly thoughts. You cannot gather figs from thistles. You
will never make your dreams come true by choking them with doubts and
fears. You've got to put foundations under your air castles, foundations
of UNDERSTANDING and BELIEF. Your chances of success in any undertaking
can always be measured by your BELIEF in yourself.

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

Are your surroundings discouraging? Do you feel that if you were in
[another's](errata.htm#7.md) place success would be easier? Just bear in
mind that your real environment is within you. All the factors of
success or failure are in your inner world. *You* make that own inner
world—and through it your outer world. You can choose the material from
which to build it. If you've not Chosen wisely in the past, you can
choose again now the material you want to rebuild it. The richness of
life is within you. No one has failed so long as he can begin again.

Start right in and *do* all those things you feel you have it in you to
do. Ask permission of no man. Concentrating your thought upon any proper
undertaking will make its achievement possible. Your belief that you
*can* do the thing gives your thought forces their

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

power. Fortune waits upon you. Seize her boldly, hold her—and she is
yours. She belongs rightfully to you. But if you cringe to her, if you
go up to her doubtfully, timidly, she will pass you by in scorn. For she
is a fickle jade who must be mastered, who loves boldness, who admires
confidence.

A Roman boasted that it was sufficient for him to strike the ground with
his foot and legions would spring up. And his very boldness cowed his
opponents. It is the same with your mind. Take the first step, and your
mind will mobilize all its forces to your aid. But the first essential
is that you *begin*. Once the battle is started, all that is within and
without you will come to your assistance, if you attack in earnest and
meet each obstacle with resolution. But you have got to start things.

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

"The Lord helps them that help themselves" is a truth as old as man. It
is, in fact, plain common sense. Your subconscious mind has all power,
but your conscious mind is the watchman at the gate. *It* has got to
open the door. *It* has got to press the spring that releases the
infinite energy. No failure is possible in the accomplishment of any
right object you may have in life, if you but understand your power and
will perseveringly try to use it in the proper way.

The men who have made their mark in this world all had one trait in
common—*they believed in themselves!* "But," you may say, "how can I
believe in myself when I have never yet done anything worth while, when
everything I put my hand to seems to fail?" You can't, of course. That
is, you couldn't

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

if you had to depend upon your conscious mind alone. But just remember
what one far greater than you said—"I can of mine own self do nothing.
The Father that is within me—He doeth the works."

That same "Father" is within you. And it is by knowing that He *is* in
you, and that through Him you can do anything that is right, that you
can acquire that belief in yourself which is so necessary. Certainly the
Mind that imaged the heavens and the earth and all that they contain has
all wisdom, all power, all abundance. With this Mind to call upon, you
know there is no problem too difficult for you to undertake. The
*knowing* of this is the first step. *Faith*. But St. James tells
us—"Faith without works is dead." So go on to the next step. Decide on
the one thing you want

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

most from life. No matter what it may be. There is no limit, you know,
to Mind. Visualize this thing that you want. See it, feel it, BELIEVE in
it. Make your mental blue-print, and *begin to build!*

Suppose some people DO laugh at your idea. Suppose Reason does say—"It
can't be done!" People laughed at Galileo. They laughed at Henry Ford.
Reason contended for countless ages that the earth was flat. Reason
said—or so numerous automotive engineers argued—that the Ford motor
wouldn't run. But the earth *is* round—and the twelfth or fifteenth
million Ford *is* on the road.

Let us start right now putting into practice some of these truths that
you have learned. What do you want most of life right now? Take that one
desire,

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

concentrate on it, impress it upon your subconscious mind.

Psychologists have discovered that the best time to make suggestions to
your subconscious mind is just before going to sleep, when the senses
are quiet and the attention is lax. So let us take your desire and
suggest it to your subconscious mind tonight. The two prerequisites are
the earnest DESIRE, and an intelligent, understanding BELIEF. Someone
has said, you know, that education is three-fourths encouragement, and
the encouragement is the suggestion that the thing can be done.

You know that you can have what you want, if you want it badly enough
and can believe in it earnestly enough. So tonight, just before you drop
off to sleep, concentrate your thought on this thing that you most
desire from life.

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> BELIEVE that you
have it. SEE YOURSELF possessing it. FEEL yourself using it.

Do that every night until you ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE that you have the
thing you want. When you reach that point, *YOU WILL HAVE IT!*
