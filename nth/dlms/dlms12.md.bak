THE WORSHIP OF ISHI.

In Hosea ii. 16 we find this remarkable statement:—"And it shall be at
that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call Me Ishi, and shalt no
more call Me Baali"; and with this we may couple the statement in Isaiah
lxii. 4:—"Thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah; for the
Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married."

In both these passages we find a change of name; and since a name stands
for something which corresponds to it, and in truth only amounts to a
succinct description, the fact indicated in these texts is a change of
condition answering to the change of name.

Now the change from Baali to Ishi indicates an important alteration in
the relation between the Divine Being and the worshipper; but since the
Divine Being cannot change, the altered relation must result from a
change in the stand-point of the worshipper: and this can only come from
a new mode of looking at the Divine, that is, from a new order of
thought regarding it. Baali means Lord, and Ishi means husband, and so
the change in relation is that of a female slave who is liberated and
married to her former master. We could not have a more perfect analogy.
Relatively to the Universal Spirit the individual soul is esoterically
feminine, as I have pointed out in "Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning,"
because its function is that of the receptive and formative. This is
necessarily inherent in the nature of the creative process. But the
individual's development as the specializing medium of the Universal
Spirit will depend entirely upon his own conception of his relation to
it. So long as he only regards it as an arbitrary power, a sort of slave
owner, he will find himself in the position of a slave driven by an
inscrutable force, he knows not whither or for what purpose. He may
worship such a God, but his worship is only the worship of fear and
ignorance, and there is no personal interest in the matter except to
escape some dreaded punishment. Such a worshipper would gladly escape
from his divinity, and his worship, when analyzed, will be found to be
little else than disguised hatred. This is the natural result of a
worship based upon UNEXPLAINED traditions instead of intelligible
principles, and is the very opposite of that worship in Spirit and in
truth which Jesus speaks of as the true worship.

But when the light begins to break in upon us, all this becomes changed.
We see that a system of terrorism cannot give expression to the Divine
Spirit, and we realize the truth of St. Paul's words, "He hath not given
us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."
As the true nature of the relation between the individual mind and the
Universal Mind becomes clearer, we find it to be one of mutual action
and re-action, a perfect reciprocity which cannot be better symbolized
than by the relation between an affectionate husband and wife.
Everything is done from love and nothing from compulsion, there is
perfect confidence on both sides, and both are equally indispensable to
each other. It is simply the carrying out of the fundamental maxim that
the Universal cannot act on the plane of the Particular except through
the Particular; only this philosophical axiom develops into a warm
living intercourse.

Now this is the position of the soul which is indicated by the name
Hephzibah. In common with all other words derived from the Semitic root
"hafz" it implies the idea of guarding, just as in the East a hasfiz is
one who guards the letter of the Koran by having the whole book by
heart, and in many similar expressions. Hephzibah may therefore be
translated as "a guarded one," thus recalling the New Testament
description of those who are "guarded into salvation." It is precisely
this conception of being guarded by a superior power that distinguishes
the worship of Ishi from that of Baali. A special relation has been
established between the Divine Spirit and the individual soul, one of
absolute confidence and personal intercourse. This does not require any
departure from the general law of the universe, but is due to that
specializing of the law through the presentation of special conditions
personal to the individual, of which I have spoken before. But all the
time there has been no change in the Universal Spirit, the only change
has been in the mental attitude of the individual—he has come into a new
thought, a clearer perception of God. He has faced the questions, What
is God? Where is God? How does God work? and he has found the answer in
the apostolic statement that God is "over all, through all, and in all,"
and he realises that "God" is the root of his (the individual's) own
being, ever present IN him, ever working THROUGH him, and universally
present around him.

This realization of the true relation between the Originating Spirit and
the individual mind is what is esoterically spoken of as the Mystical
Marriage in which the two have ceased to be separate and have become
one. As a matter of fact they always were one, but since we can
apprehend things only from the stand-point of our own consciousness, it
is our recognition of the fact that makes it a practical reality for
ourselves. But an intelligent recognition will never make a confusion of
the two parts of which the whole consists, and will never lead the
individual to suppose that he is handling a blind force or that a blind
force is handling him. He will neither dethrone God, nor lose himself by
absorption in deity, but he will recognize the reciprocity of the Divine
and the human as the natural and logical outcome of the essential
conditions of the creative process.

And what is the Whole which is thus created? It is our conscious
PERSONALITY; and therefore whatever we draw from the Universal Spirit
acquires in us the quality of personality. It is that process of
differentiation of the universal into the particular of which I have so
often spoken, which, by a rude analogy, we may compare to the
differentiation of the universal electric fluid into specific sorts of
power by its passage through suitable apparatus. It is for this reason
that relatively to ourselves the Universal Spirit must necessarily
assume a personal aspect, and that the aspect which it will assume will
be in exact correspondence with our own conception of it. This is in
accordance with mental and spiritual laws inherent in our own being, and
it is on this account that the Bible seeks to build up our conception of
God on such lines as will set us free from all fear of evil, and thus
leave us at liberty to use the creative power of our thought
affirmatively from the stand-point of a calm and untroubled mind. This
stand-point can only be reached by passing beyond the range of the
happenings of the moment, and this can only be done by the discovery of
our immediate relation to the undifferentiated source of all good. I lay
stress on these words "immediate" and "undifferentiated" because in them
is contained the secret of the whole position. If we could not draw
immediately from the Universal Spirit our receiving would be subject to
the limitations of the channel through which it reached us; and if the
force which we receive were not undifferentiated in itself it could not
take appropriate form in our own minds and become to each of us just
what we require it to be. It is this power of the human soul to
differentiate limitlessly from the Infinite that we are apt to overlook,
but as we come to realize that the soul is itself a reflection and image
of the Infinite Spirit—and a clear recognition of the cosmic creative
process shows that it cannot be anything else—we find that it must
possess this power, and that-in fact it is our possession of this power
which is the whole raison d'etre of the creative process: if the human
soul did not possess an unlimited power of differentiation from the
Infinite, then the Infinite would not be reflected in it, and
consequently the Infinite Spirit would find no outlet for its CONSCIOUS
recognition of itself as the Life, Love, and Beauty which it is. We can
never too deeply ponder the old esoteric definition of Spirit as "the
Power which knows itself": the secret of all things, past, present, and
future is contained in these few words. The self -recognition or
self-contemplation of Spirit is the primary movement out of which all
creation proceeds, and the attainment in the individual of a fresh
centre for self-recognition is what the Spirit GAINS in the process—this
GAIN accruing to the Spirit is what is referred to in the parables where
the lord is represented as receiving increase from his servants.

When the individual perceives this relation between himself and Infinite
Spirit, he finds that he has been raised from a position of slavery to
one of reciprocity. The Spirit cannot do without him any more than he
can do without the Spirit: the two are as necessary to each other as the
two poles of an electric battery. The Spirit is the unlimited essence of
Love, Wisdom, and Power, all three in one undifferentiated and waiting
to be differentiated by APPROPRIATION, that is, by the individual
CLAIMING to be the channel of their differentiation. It only requires
the claim to be made with the recognition that by the Law of Being it is
bound to be answered, and the right feeling, the right seeing, and the
right working for the particular matter we have in hand will flow in
quite naturally. Our old enemies, doubt and fear, may seek to bring us
back under bondage to Baali, but our new stand-point for the recognition
of the All-originating Spirit as being absolutely unified with ourselves
must always be kept resolutely in mind; for, short of this, we are not
working on the creative level—we are creating, indeed, for we can never
divest ourselves of our creative power, but we are creating in the image
of the old limiting and destructive conditions, and this is merely
perpetuating the cosmic Law of Averages, which is just what the
individual has to rise superior to. The creative level is where new laws
begin to manifest themselves in a new order of conditions, something
transcending our past experiences and thus bringing about a real
advance; for it is no advance only to go on in the same old round even
if we kept at it for centuries: it is the steady go-ahead nature of the
Spirit that has made the world of to-day an improvement upon the world
of the pterodactyl and the icthiosaurus, and we must look for the same
forward movement of the Spirit from its new starting-point in ourselves.

Now it is this special, personal, and individual relation of the Spirit
to ourselves which is typified by the names Ishi and Hephzibah. From
this stand-point we may say that as the individual wakes up to the
oneness with the Spirit, the Spirit wakes up to the same thing. It
becomes conscious of itself through the consciousness of the individual,
and thus is solved the paradox of individual self-recognition by the
Universal Spirit, without which no new-creative power could be exercised
and all things would continue to proceed in the old merely cosmic order.
It is of course true that in the merely generic order the Spirit must be
present in every form of Life, as the Master pointed out when He said
that not a sparrow falls to the ground without "the Father." But as the
sparrows He alluded to had been shot and were on sale at a price which
shows that this was the fate of a good many of them, we see here
precisely that stage of manifestation where the Spirit has not woke up
to individual self-recognition, and remains at the lower level of
self-recognition, that of the generic or race-spirit. The Master's
comment, "Ye are of more value than many sparrows" points out this
difference: in us the generic creation has reached the level which
affords the conditions for the waking up of the Spirit to
self-recognition in the Individual.

And we must bear in mind that all this is perfectly natural. There is no
posing or straining after effect about it. If YOU have to pump up the
Life, who is going to put the Life into you to pump it? Therefore it is
spontaneous or nothing. That is why the Bible speaks of it as the free
gift of God. It cannot be anything else. You cannot originate the
originating force; it must originate you: but what you can do is to
distribute it. Therefore immediately you experience any sense of
friction be sure there is something wrong somewhere; and since God can
never change, you may be sure that the friction is being caused by some
error in your own thinking—you are limiting the Spirit in some way: set
to work to find out what it is. It is always LIMITING the Spirit that
does this. You are tying it down to conditions somewhere, saying it is
bound by reason of some existing forms. The remedy is to go back to the
original starting point of the Cosmic Creation and ask, Where were the
pre-existing forms that dictated to the Spirit then? Then because the
Spirit never changes it is STILL THE SAME, and is just as independent of
existing conditions now as it was in the beginning; and so we must pass
over all existing conditions, however apparently adverse, and go
straight to the Spirit as the originator of new forms and new
conditions. This is real New Thought, for it does not trouble about the
old things, but is going straight ahead from where we are now. When we
do this, just trusting the Spirit, and not laying down the particular
details of its action—just telling it what we want without dictating HOW
we are to get it—we shall find that things will open out more and more
clearly day by day both on the inner and the outer plane. Remember that
the Spirit is alive and working here and now, for if ever the Spirit is
to get from the past into the future it must be by passing through the
present; therefore what you have to do is to acquire the habit of living
direct -from the Spirit here and now. You will soon find that this is a
matter of personal intercourse, perfectly natural and not requiring any
abnormal conditions for its production. You just treat the Spirit as you
would any other kind-hearted sensible person, remembering that it is
always there—"closer than hands and feet," as Tennyson says—and you will
gradually begin to appreciate its reciprocity as a very practical fact
indeed.

This is the relation of Hephzibah to Ishi, and is that worship in Spirit
and in truth which needs neither the temple in Jerusalem nor yet in
Samaria for its acceptance, for the whole world is the temple of the
Spirit and you yourself its sanctuary. Bear this in mind, and remember
that nothing is too great or too small, too interior or too external,
for the Spirit's recognition and operation, for the Spirit is itself
both the Life and the Substance of all things and it is also
Self-recognition from the stand-point of your own individuality; and
therefore, because the Self-recognition of Spirit is the Life of the
creative process, you will, by simply trusting the Spirit to work
according to its own nature, pass more and more completely into that New
Order which proceeds from the thought of Him who says, "Behold I make
all things new."
