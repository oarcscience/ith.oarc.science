THE CREATIVE POWER OF THOUGHT.

One of the great axioms in the new order of ideas, of which I have
spoken, is that our Thought possesses creative power, and since the
whole superstructure depends on this foundation, it is well to examine
it carefully. Now the starting point is to see that Thought, or purely
mental action, is the only possible source from which the existing
creation could ever have come into manifestation at all, and it is on
this account that in the preceding addresses I have laid stress on the
origin of the cosmos. It is therefore not necessary to go over this
ground again, and we will start this morning's enquiry on the assumption
that every manifestation is in essence the expression of a Divine
Thought. This being so, our own mind is the expression of a Divine
Thought. The Divine Thought has produced something which itself is
capable of thinking; but the question is whether its thinking has the
same creative quality as that of the Parent Mind.

Now by the very hypothesis of the case the whole Creative Process
consists in the continual pressing so forward of the Universal Spirit
for expression through the individual and particular, and Spirit in its
different modes is therefore the Life and Substance of the universe.
Hence it follows that if there is to be an expression of thinking power
it can only be by expressing the same thinking power which subsists
latent in the Originating Spirit. If it were less than this it would
only be some sort of mechanism and would not be thinking power, so that
to be thinking power at all it must be identical in kind with that of
the Originating Spirit. It is for this reason that man is said to be
created in the image and likeness of God; and if we realize that it is
impossible for him to be otherwise, we shall find a firm foundation from
which to draw many important deductions.

But if our thought possesses this creative power, why are we hampered by
adverse conditions? The answer is, because hitherto we have used our
power invertedly. We have taken the starting point of our thought from
external facts and consequently created a repetition of facts of a
similar nature, and so long as we do this we must needs go on
perpetuating the old circle of limitation. And, owing to the
sensitiveness of the subconscious mind to suggestion—(See Edinburgh
Lectures, chapter V.)—we are subject to a very powerful negative
influence from those who are unacquainted with affirmative principles,
and thus race-beliefs and the thought-currents of our more immediate
environment tend to consolidate our own inverted thinking. It is
therefore not surprising that the creative power of our thought, thus
used in a wrong direction, has produced the limitations of which we
complain. The remedy, then, is by reversing our method of thinking, and
instead of taking external facts as our starting point, taking the
inherent nature of mental power as our starting point. We have already
gained two great steps in this direction, first by seeing that the whole
manifested cosmos could have had its origin nowhere but in mental power,
and secondly by realizing that our own mental power must be the same in
kind with that of the Originating Mind.

Now we can go a step further and see how this power in ourselves can be
perpetuated and intensified. By the nature of the creative process your
mind is itself a thought of the Parent Mind; so, as long as this thought
of the Universal Mind subsists, you will subsist, for you are it. But so
long as you think this thought it continues to subsist, and necessarily
remains present in the Divine Mind, thus fulfilling the logical
conditions required for the perpetuation of the individual life. A poor
analogy of the process may be found in a self-influencing dynamo where
the magnetism generates the current and the current intensifies the
magnetism with the result of producing a still stronger current until
the limit of saturation is reached; only in the substantive infinitude
of the Universal Mind and the potential infinitude of the Individual
Mind there is no limit of saturation. Or we may compare the interaction
of the two minds to two mirrors, a great and a small one, opposite each
other, with the word "Life" engraved on the large one. Then, by the law
of reflection, the word "Life" will also appear on the image of the
smaller mirror reflected in the greater. Of course these are only very
imperfect analogies; but if you car once grasp the idea of your own
individuality as a thought in the Divine Mind which is able to
perpetuate itself by thinking of itself as the thought which it is, you
have got at the root of the whole matter, and by the same process you
will not only perpetuate your life but will also expand it.

When we realize this on the one hand, and on the other that all external
conditions, including the body, are produced by thought, we find
ourselves standing between two infinites, the infinite of Mind and the
infinite of Substance—from both of which we can draw what we will, and
mould specific conditions out of the Universal Substance by the Creative
Power which we draw in from the Universal Mind. But we must recollect
that this is not by the force of personal will upon the substance, which
is an error that will land us in all sorts of inversion, but by
realizing our mind as a channel through which the Universal Mind
operates upon substances in a particular way, according to the mode of
thought which we are seeking to embody. If, then, our thought is
habitually concentrated upon principles rather than on particular
things, realizing that principles are nothing else than the Divine Mind
in operation, we shall find that they will necessarily germinate to
produce their own expression in corresponding facts, thus verifying the
words of the Great Teacher, "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His
righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you."

But we must never lose sight of the reason for the creative power of our
thought, that it is because our mind is itself a thought of the Divine
Mind, and that consequently our increase in livingness and creative
power must be in exact proportion to our perception of our relation to
the Parent Mind. In such considerations as these is to be found the
philosophical basis of the Bible doctrine of "Sonship," with its
culmination in the conception of the Christ. These are not mere fancies
but the expression of strictly scientific principles, in their
application to the deepest problems of the individual life; and their
basis is that each one's world, whether in or out of the flesh, must
necessarily be created by his own consciousness, and, in its turn, his
mode of consciousness will necessarily take its colour front his
conception of his relation to the Divine Mind—to the exclusion of light
and colour, if he realizes no Divine Mind, and to their building up into
forms of beauty in proportion as he realizes his identity of being with
that All-Originating Spirit which is Light, Love, and Beauty in itself.
Thus the great creative work of Thought in each of us is to make us
consciously "sons and daughters of the Almighty," realizing that by our
divine origin we can never be really separated from the Parent Mind
which is continually seeking expression through us, and that any
apparent separation is due to our own misconception of the true nature
of the inherent relation between the Universal and the Individual. This
is the lesson which the Great Teacher has so luminously out before us in
the parable of the Prodigal Son.
