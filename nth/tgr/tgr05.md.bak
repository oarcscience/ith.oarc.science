### AUTHOR'S PREFACE

IN EVERY chapter of this book, mention has been made of the money-making
secret which has made fortunes for more than five hundred exceedingly
wealthy men whom I have carefully analyzed over a long period of years.

The secret was brought to my attention by Andrew Carnegie, more than a
quarter of a century ago. The canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly
tossed it into my mind, when I was but a boy. Then he sat back in his
chair, with a merry twinkle in his eyes, and watched carefully to see if
I had brains enough to understand the full significance of what he had
said to me.

When he saw that I had grasped the idea, he asked if I would be willing
to spend twenty years or more, preparing myself to take it to the world,
to men and women who, without the secret, might go through life as
failures. I said I would, and with Mr. Carnegie's cooperation, I have
kept my promise.

This book contains the secret, after having been put to a practical test
by thousands of people, in almost every walk of life. It was Mr.
Carnegie's idea that the magic formula, which gave him a stupendous
fortune, ought to be placed within reach of people who do not have time
to investigate how men make money, and it was his hope that I might test
and demonstrate the soundness of the formula through the experience of
men and women in every calling. He believed the formula should be taught
in all public schools and colleges, and expressed the

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

opinion that if it were properly taught it would so revolutionize the
entire educational system that the time spent in school could be reduced
to less than half.

His experience with Charles M. Schwab, and other young men of Mr.
Schwab's type, convinced Mr. Carnegie that much of that which is taught
in the schools is of no value whatsoever in connection with the business
of earning a living or accumulating riches. He had arrived at this
decision, because he had taken into his business one young man after
another, many of them with but little schooling, and by coaching them in
the use of this formula, developed in them rare leadership. Moreover,
*his coaching made fortunes for everyone of them who followed his
instructions*.

In the chapter on Faith, you will read the astounding story of the
organization of the giant United States Steel Corporation, as it was
conceived and carried out by one of the young men through whom Mr.
Carnegie proved that his formula will work *for all who are ready for
it*. This single application of the secret, by that young man--Charles
M. Schwab--made him a huge fortune in both money and OPPORTUNITY.
Roughly speaking, this particular application of the formula was worth
*six hundred million dollars*.

These facts--and they are facts well known to almost everyone who knew
Mr. Carnegie--give you a fair idea of what the reading of this book may
bring to you, provided you *KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT*.

Even before it had undergone twenty years of

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

practical testing, the secret was passed on to more than one hundred
thousand men and women who have used it for their personal benefit, as
Mr. Carnegie planned that they should. Some have made fortunes with it.
Others have used it successfully in creating harmony in their homes. A
clergyman used it so effectively that it brought him an income of
upwards of $75,000.00 a year.

Arthur Nash, a Cincinnati tailor, used his near-bankrupt business as a
"guinea pig" on which to test the formula. The business came to life and
made a fortune for its owners. It is still thriving, although Mr. Nash
has gone. The experiment was so unique that newspapers and magazines,
gave it more than a million dollars' worth of laudatory publicity.

The secret was passed on to Stuart Austin Wier, of Dallas, Texas. He was
ready for it--so ready that he gave up his profession and studied law.
Did he succeed? That story is told too.

I gave the secret to Jennings Randolph, the day he graduated from
College, and he has used it so successfully that he is now serving his
third term as a Member of Congress, with an excellent opportunity to
keep on using it until it carries him to the White House.

While serving as Advertising Manager of the LaSalle Extension
University, when it was little more than a name, I had the privilege of
seeing J. G. Chapline, President of the University, use the formula so
effectively that he has since made the LaSalle one of the great
extension schools of the country.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

The secret to which I refer has been mentioned no fewer than a hundred
times, throughout this book. It has not been directly named, for it
seems to work more successfully when it is merely uncovered and left in
sight, where THOSE WHO ARE READY, and SEARCHING FOR IT, may pick it up.
That is why Mr. Carnegie tossed it to me so quietly, without giving me
its specific name.

If you are READY to put it to use, you will recognize this secret at
least once in every chapter. I wish I might feel privileged to tell you
how you will know if you are ready, but that would deprive you of much
of the benefit you will receive when you make the discovery in your own
way.

While this book was being written, my own son, who was then finishing
the last year of his college work, picked up the manuscript of chapter
two, read it, and discovered the secret for himself. He used the
information so effectively that he went directly into a responsible
position at a beginning salary greater than the average man ever earns.
His story has been briefly described in chapter two. When you read it,
perhaps you will dismiss any feeling you may have had, at the beginning
of the book, that it promised too much. And, too, if you have ever been
discouraged, if you have had difficulties to surmount which took the
very soul out of you, if you have tried and failed, if you were ever
handicapped by illness or physical affliction, this story of my son's
discovery and use of the Carnegie formula may prove to be the oasis in
the Desert of Lost Hope, for which you have been searching.

This secret was extensively used by President

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Woodrow Wilson,
during the World War. It was passed on to every soldier who fought in
the war, carefully wrapped in the training received before going to the
front. President Wilson told me it was a strong factor in raising the
funds needed for the war.

More than twenty years ago, Hon. Manuel L. Quezon (then Resident
Commissioner of the Philippine Islands), was inspired by the secret to
gain freedom for his people. He has gained freedom for the Philippines,
and is the first President of the free state.

A peculiar thing about this secret is that those who once acquire it and
use it, find themselves literally swept on to success, with but little
effort, and they never again submit to failure! If you doubt this, study
the names of those who have used it, wherever they have been mentioned,
check their records for yourself, and be convinced.

There is no such thing as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING!

The secret to which I refer cannot be had without a price, although the
price is far less than its value. It cannot be had at any price by those
who are not intentionally searching for it. It cannot be given away, it
cannot be purchased for money, for the reason that it comes in two
parts. One part is already in possession of those who are ready for it.

The secret serves equally well, all who are ready for it. Education has
nothing to do with it. Long before I was born, the secret had found its
way into the possession of Thomas A. Edison, and he used it so
intelligently that he became the world's leading

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

inventor, although he had but three months of schooling.

The secret was passed on to a business associate of Mr. Edison. He used
it so effectively that, although he was then making only $12,000 a year,
he accumulated a great fortune, and retired from active business while
still a young man. You will find his story at the beginning of the first
chapter. It should convince you that riches are not beyond your reach,
that you can still be what you wish to be, that money, fame, recognition
and happiness can be had by all who are ready and determined to have
these blessings.

How do I know these things? You should have the answer before you finish
this book. You may find it in the very first chapter, or on the last
page.

While I was performing the twenty year task of research, which I had
undertaken at Mr. Carnegie's request, I analyzed hundreds of well known
men, many of whom admitted that they had accumulated their vast fortunes
through the aid of the Carnegie secret; among these men were:--

These names represent but a small fraction of the hundreds of well known
Americans whose achievements, financially and otherwise, prove that
those who understand and apply the Carnegie secret, reach high stations
in life. I have never known anyone who was inspired to use the secret,
who did not achieve noteworthy success in his chosen calling. I have
never known any person to distinguish himself, or to accumulate riches
of any consequence, without possession of the secret. From these two

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

facts I draw the conclusion that the secret is more important, as a part
of the knowledge essential for self-determination, than any which one
receives through what is popularly known as "education." What is
EDUCATION, anyway? This has been answered in full detail.

As far as schooling is concerned, many of these men had very little.
John Wanamaker once told me that what little schooling he had, he
acquired in very much the same manner as a modern locomotive takes on
water, by "scooping it up as it runs." Henry Ford never reached high
school, let alone college. I am not attempting to minimize the value of
schooling, but I am trying to express my earnest belief that those who
master and apply the secret will reach high stations, accumulate riches,
and bargain with life on their own terms, even if their schooling has
been meager.

Somewhere, as you read, the secret to which I refer will jump from the
page and stand boldly before you, IF YOU ARE READY FOR IT! When it
appears, you will recognize it. Whether you receive the sign in the
first or the last chapter, stop for a moment when it presents itself,
and turn down a glass, for that occasion will mark the most important
turning-point of your life.

We pass now, to Chapter One, and to the story of my very dear friend,
who has generously acknowledged having seen the mystic sign, and whose
business achievements are evidence enough that he turned down a glass.
As you read his story, and the others, remember that they deal with the
important problems of life, such as all men experience.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The problems
arising from one's endeavor to earn a living, to find hope, courage,
contentment and peace of mind; to accumulate riches and to enjoy freedom
of body and spirit.

Remember, too, as you go through the book, that it deals with facts and
not with fiction, its purpose being to convey a great universal truth
through which all who are READY may learn, not only *WHAT* TO DO, BUT
ALSO HOW TO DO IT! and receive, as well, THE NEEDED STIMULUS TO MAKE A
START.

As a final word of preparation, before you begin the first chapter, may
I offer one brief suggestion which may provide a clue by which the
Carnegie secret may be recognized? It is this--*ALL ACHIEVEMENT, ALL
EARNED RICHES, HAVE THEIR BEGINNING IN AN IDEA!* If you are ready for
the secret, you already possess one half of it, therefore, you will
readily recognize the other half the moment it reaches your mind.
