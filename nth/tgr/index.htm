<P>
This is one of the best-selling self-help books of all time.
Written during the Great Depression, against a backdrop
of millions of people out of work and a looming world
war, Napoleon Hill's <I>magnum opus</I>
held out hope that life could get better.
While not considered part of the New Thought movement, Hill drew on
many of their concepts and techniques.
He prefigured the 'Prosperity Consciousness'
of present-day New Age thinkers.
And a host of motivational writers and speakers 
have followed in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
A good part of Hill's book is simply the gospel of 20th century
American Capitalism:
work hard, have a firm handshake, get ahead by doing quality work,
treat your customers with respect,
anybody can become rich and/or powerful if they overcome their personal
weaknesses.
Some may find the core 'secret' of this book elusive; Hill never
gives us a succinct formula to acquiring wealth, although he
hints that it exists.
However, the title of the book is '<I>Think</I> and Grow Rich,'
<I>not</I> 'Get Rich Quick': Hill insists that we take
a very detailed personal inventory, and grow spiritually,
in order to draw wealth our way.
This involves a developing a high level of self-discipline and obeying
the Delphic injunction to 'Know Thyself'.
He also incorporates a lot of good, practical business advice:
find new opportunities created by technological innovations,
make a written plan and keep to it, don't be afraid to fail repeatedly.
The secret is here, it is just simply the sum of parts rather than
an explicit roadmap.
</P>
<P>
Towards the end of the book he steps off a precipice and
ventures into some very
esoteric territory. 
He discusses harnessing Kundalini energy,
manifesting psychic powers such as telepathy,
tapping into higher consciousness,
and getting in touch with the great minds of history,
although, again, he is not too specific about how to accomplish these feats.
</P>
<P>
<CITE>Think and Grow Rich</CITE> is one of those books
which makes a lasting impression.
No matter what you may think of Hill's philosophy and his
folksy writing style,
you are bound to come away from this book feeling energized,
more optimistic about life, and (possibly) a bit richer
for the experience.
