PERSISTENCE is an essential factor in the procedure of transmuting
DESIRE into its monetary equivalent. The basis of persistence is the
POWER OF WILL.

Will-power and desire, when properly combined, make an irresistible
pair. Men who accumulate great fortunes are generally known as
cold-blooded, and sometimes ruthless. Often they are misunderstood. What
they have is will-power, which they mix with persistence, and place back
of their desires to insure the attainment of their objectives.

Henry Ford has been generally misunderstood to be ruthless and
cold-blooded. This misconception grew out of Ford's habit of following
through in all of his plans with PERSISTENCE.

The majority of people are ready to throw their aims and purposes
overboard, and give up at the first sign of opposition or misfortune. A
few carry on DESPITE all opposition, until they attain their goal. These
few are the Fords, Carnegies, Rockefellers, and Edisons.

There may be no heroic connotation to the word "persistence," but the
quality is to the character of man what carbon is to steel.

The building of a fortune, generally, involves the application of the
entire thirteen factors of this

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

philosophy. These principles must be understood, they must be applied
with PERSISTENCE by all who accumulate money.

If you are following this book with the intention of applying the
knowledge it conveys, your first test as to your PERSISTENCE will come
when you begin to follow the six steps described in the second chapter.
Unless you are one of the two out of every hundred who already have a
DEFINITE GOAL at which you are aiming, and a DEFINITE PLAN for its
attainment, you may read the instructions, and then pass on with your
daily routine, and never comply with those instructions.

The author is checking you up at this point, because lack of persistence
is one of the major causes of failure. Moreover, experience with
thousands of people has proved that lack of persistence is a weakness
common to the majority of men. It is a weakness which may be overcome by
effort. The ease with which lack of persistence may be conquered will
depend *entirely* upon the INTENSITY OF ONE'S DESIRE.

The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in
mind. Weak desires bring weak results, just as a small amount of fire
makes a small amount of heat. If you find yourself lacking in
persistence, this weakness may be remedied by building a stronger fire
under your desires.

Continue to read through to the end, then go back to Chapter two, and
start *immediately* to carry out the instructions given in connection
with the six steps. The eagerness with which you follow these
instructions will indicate clearly, how much,

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

or how little you really DESIRE to accumulate money. If you find that
you are indifferent, you may be sure that you have not yet acquired the
"money consciousness" which you must possess, before you can be sure of
accumulating a fortune.

Fortunes gravitate to men whose minds have been prepared to "attract"
them, just as surely as water gravitates to the ocean. In this book may
be found all the stimuli necessary to "attune" any normal mind to the
vibrations which will attract the object of one's desires.

If you find you are weak in PERSISTENCE, center your attention upon the
instructions contained in the chapter on "Power"; surround yourself with
a "MASTER MIND" group, and through the cooperative efforts of the
members of this group, you can develop persistence. You will find
additional instructions for the development of persistence in the
chapters on auto-suggestion, and the subconscious mind. Follow the
instructions outlined in these chapters until your habit nature hands
over to your subconscious mind, a clear picture of the object of your
DESIRE. From that point on, you will not be handicapped by lack of
persistence.

Your subconscious mind works continuously, while you are awake, and
while you are asleep.

Spasmodic, or occasional effort to apply the rules will be of no value
to you. To get RESULTS, you must apply all of the rules until their
application becomes a fixed habit with you. In no other way can you
develop the necessary "money consciousness."

POVERTY is attracted to the one whose mind is

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

favorable to it, as money is attracted to him whose mind has been
deliberately prepared to attract it, and through the same laws. POVERTY
CONSCIOUSNESS WILL VOLUNTARILY SEIZE THE MIND WHICH IS NOT OCCUPIED WITH
THE MONEY CONSCIOUSNESS. A poverty consciousness develops without
*conscious* application of habits favorable to it. The money
consciousness must be created to order, unless one is born with such a
consciousness.

Catch the full significance of the statements in the preceding
paragraph, and you will understand the importance of PERSISTENCE in the
accumulation of a fortune. Without PERSISTENCE, you will be defeated,
even before you start. With PERSISTENCE you will win.

If you have ever experienced a nightmare, you will realize the value of
persistence. You are lying in bed, half awake, with a feeling that you
are about to smother. You are unable to turn over, or to move a muscle.
You realize that you MUST BEGIN to regain control over your muscles.
Through persistent effort of will-power, you finally manage to move the
fingers of one hand. By continuing to move your fingers, you extend your
control to the muscles of one arm, until you can lift it. Then you gain
control of the other arm in the same manner. You finally gain control
over the muscles of one leg, and then extend it to the other leg.
THEN--WITH ONE SUPREME EFFORT OF WILL--you regain complete control over
your muscular system, and "snap" out of your nightmare. The trick has
been turned step by step.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

You may find it necessary to "snap" out of your mental inertia, through
a similar procedure, moving slowly at first, then increasing your speed,
until you gain complete control over your will. Be PERSISTENT no matter
how slowly you may, at first, have to move. WITH PERSISTENCE WILL COME
SUCCESS.

If you select your "Master Mind" group with care, you will have in it,
at least one person who will aid you in the development of PERSISTENCE.
Some men who have accumulated great fortunes, did so because of
NECESSITY. They developed the habit of PERSISTENCE, because they were so
closely driven by circumstances, that they *had to become persistent*.

THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PERSISTENCE! It cannot be supplanted by any
other quality! Remember this, and it will hearten you, in the beginning,
when the going may seem difficult and slow.

Those who have cultivated the HABIT of persistence seem to enjoy
insurance against failure. No matter how many times they are defeated,
they finally arrive up toward the top of the ladder. Sometimes it
appears that there is a hidden Guide whose duty is to test men through
all sorts of discouraging experiences. Those who pick themselves up
after defeat and keep on trying, arrive; and the world cries, "Bravo! I
knew you could do it!" The hidden Guide lets no one enjoy great
achievement without passing the PERSISTENCE TEST. Those who can't take
it, simply do not make the grade.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

Those who can "take it" are bountifully rewarded for their PERSISTENCE.
They receive, as their compensation, whatever goal they are pursuing.
That is not all! They receive something infinitely more important than
material compensation--the knowledge that "EVERY FAILURE BRINGS WITH IT
THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT ADVANTAGE."

There are exceptions to this rule; a few people know from experience the
soundness of persistence. They are the ones who have not accepted defeat
as being anything more than temporary. They are the ones whose DESIRES
are so PERSISTENTLY APPLIED that defeat is finally changed into victory.
We who stand on the side-lines of Life see the overwhelmingly large
number who go down in defeat, never to rise again. We see the few who
take the punishment of defeat *as an urge to greater effort*. These,
fortunately, never learn to accept Life's reverse gear. But what we DO
NOT SEE, what most of us never suspect of existing, is the silent but
irresistible POWER which comes to the rescue of those who fight on in
the face of discouragement. If we speak of this power at all we call it
PERSISTENCE, and let it go at that. One thing we all know, if one does
not possess PERSISTENCE, one does not achieve noteworthy success in any
calling.

As these lines are being written, I look up from my work, and see before
me, less than a block away, the great mysterious "Broadway," the
"Graveyard of Dead Hopes," and the "Front Porch of Opportunity." From
all over the world people have come

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

to Broadway, seeking fame, fortune, power, love, or whatever it is that
human beings call success. Once in a great while someone steps out from
the long procession of seekers, and the world hears that another person
has mastered Broadway. But Broadway is not easily nor quickly conquered.
She acknowledges talent, recognizes genius, pays off in money, only
*after* one has refused to QUIT.

Then we know he has discovered the secret of how to conquer Broadway.
The secret is always inseparably attached to one word, PERSISTENCE!

The secret is told in the struggle of Fannie Hurst, whose PERSISTENCE
conquered the Great White Way. She came to New York in 1915, to convert
writing into riches. The conversion did not come quickly, BUT IT CAME.
For four years Miss Hurst learned about "The Sidewalks of New York" from
first hand experience. She spent her days laboring, and her nights
HOPING. When hope grew dim, she did not say, "Alright Broadway, you
win!" She said, "Very well, Broadway, you may whip some, but not me. I'm
going to force you to give up."

One publisher (The Saturday Evening Post) sent her *thirty six*
rejection slips, before she "broke the ice" and got a story across. The
average writer, like the "average" in other walks of life, would have
given up the job when the first rejection slip came. She pounded the
pavements for four years to the tune of the publisher's "NO," because
she was determined to win.

Then came the "payoff." The spell had been broken, the unseen Guide had
tested Fannie Hurst,

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

and she could take it. From that time on publishers made a beaten path
to her door. Money came so fast she hardly had time to count it. Then
the moving picture men discovered her, and money came not in small
change, but in floods. The moving picture rights to her latest novel,
"Great Laughter," brought $100,000.00, said to be the highest price ever
paid for a story before publication. Her royalties from the sale of the
book probably will run much more.

Briefly, you have a description of what PERSISTENCE is capable of
achieving. Fannie Hurst is no exception. Wherever men and women
accumulate great riches, you may be sure they first acquired
PERSISTENCE. Broadway will give any beggar a cup of coffee and a
sandwich, but it demands PERSISTENCE of those who go after the big
stakes.

Kate Smith will say "amen" when she reads this. For years she sang,
without money, and without price, before any microphone she could reach.
Broadway said to her, "Come and get it, if you can take it." She did
take it until one happy day Broadway got tired and said, "Aw, what's the
use? You don't know when you're whipped, so name your price, and go to
work in earnest." Miss Smith named her price! It was plenty. Away up in
figures so high that one week's salary is far more than most people make
in a whole year.

Verily it pays to be PERSISTENT!

And here is an encouraging statement which carries with it a suggestion
of great significance--THOUSANDS OF SINGERS WHO EXCEL

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> KATE SMITH ARE
WALKING UP AND DOWN BROADWAY LOOKING FOR A "BREAK"--WITHOUT SUCCESS.
Countless others have come and gone, many of them sang well enough, but
they failed to make the grade because they lacked the courage to keep on
keeping on, until Broadway became tired of turning them away.

Persistence is a state of mind, therefore it can be cultivated. Like all
states of mind, persistence is based upon definite causes, among them
these:

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| a\. | DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Knowing what one wants is the first and, perhaps, the most important step toward the development of persistence. A strong motive forces one to surmount many difficulties.                                                                                             |
| b\. | DESIRE. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| c\. | SELF-RELIANCE. Belief in one's ability to carry out a plan encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. (Self-reliance can be developed through the principle described in the chapter on auto-suggestion).                                                                      |
| d\. | DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage persistence.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| e\. | ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE. Knowing that one's plans are sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages persistence; "guessing" instead of "knowing" destroys persistence.                                                                                                                     |
|     | <span id="page_234">p. 234</span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| f\. | CO-OPERATION. Sympathy, understanding, and harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| g\. | WILL-POWER. The habit of concentrating one's thoughts upon the building of plans for the attainment of a definite purpose, leads to persistence.                                                                                                                                                |
| h\. | HABIT. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by *forced repetition of acts of courage*. Everyone who has seen active service in war knows this. |

Before leaving the subject of PERSISTENCE, take inventory of yourself,
and determine in what particular, if any, you are lacking in this
essential quality. Measure yourself courageously, point by point, and
see how many of the eight factors of persistence you lack. The analysis
may lead to discoveries that will give you a new grip on yourself.

SYMPTOMS OF LACK OF PERSISTENCE

Here you will find the real enemies which stand between you and
noteworthy achievement. Here you will find not only the "symptoms"
indicating weakness of PERSISTENCE, but also the deeply seated
subconscious causes of this weakness. Study the list carefully, and face
yourself squarely IF YOU REALLY WISH TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE, AND WHAT YOU
ARE CAPABLE OF DOING. These are the weaknesses which must be mastered by
all who accumulate riches.

|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\.  | Failure to recognize and to clearly define exactly what one wants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2\.  | Procrastination, with or without cause. (Usually backed up with a formidable array of alibis and excuses).                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3\.  | Lack of interest in acquiring specialized knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4\.  | Indecision, the habit of "passing the buck" on all occasions, instead of facing issues squarely. (Also backed by alibis).                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5\.  | The habit of relying upon alibis instead of creating definite plans for the solution of problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6\.  | Self-satisfaction. There is but little remedy for this affliction, and no hope for those who suffer from it.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 16\. | FEAR OF CRITICISM, failure to create plans and to put them into action, because of what other people will think, do, or say. This enemy belongs at the head of the list, because it generally exists in one's subconscious mind, where its presence is not recognized. (See the Six Basic Fears in a later chapter). |

Let us examine some of the symptoms of the Fear of Criticism. The
majority of people permit relatives, friends, and the public at large to
so influence them that they cannot live their own lives, because they
fear criticism.

Huge numbers of people make mistakes in marriage, stand by the bargain,
and go through life miserable and unhappy, because they fear criticism
which may follow if they correct the mistake. (Anyone who has submitted
to this form of fear knows the irreparable damage it does, by destroying
ambition, self-reliance, and the desire to achieve).

Millions of people neglect to acquire belated educations, after having
left school, because they fear criticism.

Countless numbers of men and women, both young and old, permit relatives
to wreck their lives

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

in the name of DUTY, because they fear criticism. (Duty does not require
any person to submit to the destruction of his personal ambitions and
the right to live his own life in his own way).

People refuse to take chances in business, because they fear the
criticism which may follow if they fail. *The fear of criticism, in such
cases is stronger than the DESIRE for success*.

Too many people refuse to set high goals for themselves, or even neglect
selecting a career, because they fear the criticism of relatives and
"friends" who may say "Don't aim so high, people will think you are
crazy."

When Andrew Carnegie suggested that I devote twenty years to the
organization of a philosophy of individual achievement my first impulse
of thought was fear of what people might say. The suggestion set up a
goal for me, far out of proportion to any I had ever conceived. As quick
as a flash, my mind began to create alibis and excuses, all of them
traceable to the inherent FEAR OF CRITICISM. Something inside of me
said, "You can't do it--the job is too big, and requires too much
time--what will your relatives think of you?--how will you earn a
living?--no one has ever organized a philosophy of success, what right
have you to believe you can do it?--who are you, anyway, to aim so
high?--remember your humble birth--what do you know about
philosophy--people will think you are crazy--(and they did)--why hasn't
some other person done this before now?"

These, and many other questions flashed into my mind, and demanded
attention. It seemed as if the

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

whole world had suddenly turned its attention to me with the purpose of
ridiculing me into giving up all desire to carry out Mr. Carnegie's
suggestion.

I had a fine opportunity, then and there, to kill off ambition before it
gained control of me. Later in life, after having analyzed thousands of
people, I discovered that MOST IDEAS ARE STILLBORN, AND NEED THE BREATH
OF LIFE INJECTED INTO THEM THROUGH DEFINITE PLANS OF IMMEDIATE ACTION.
The time to nurse an idea is at the time of its birth. Every minute it
lives, gives it a better chance of surviving. The FEAR OF CRITICISM is
at the bottom of the destruction of most ideas which never reach the
PLANNING and ACTION stage.

Many people believe that material success is the result of favorable
"breaks." There is an element of ground for the belief, but those
depending entirely upon luck, are nearly always disappointed, because
they overlook another important factor which must be present before one
can be sure of success. It is the knowledge with which favorable
"breaks" can be made to order.

During the depression, W. C. Fields, the comedian, lost all his money,
and found himself without income, without a job, and his means of
earning a living (vaudeville) no longer existed. Moreover, he was past
sixty, when many men consider themselves "old." He was so eager to stage
a comeback that he offered to work without pay, in a new field (movies).
In addition to his other troubles, he fell and injured his neck. To many
that would have been the place to give up and QUIT. But Fields

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

was PERSISTENT. He knew that if he carried on he would get the "breaks"
sooner or later, and he did get them, but not by chance.

Marie Dressler found herself down and out, with her money gone, with no
job, when she was about sixty. She, too, went after the "breaks," and
got them. Her PERSISTENCE brought an astounding triumph late in life,
long beyond the age when most men and women are done with ambition to
achieve.

Eddie Cantor lost his money in the 1929 stock crash, but he still had
his PERSISTENCE and his courage. With these, plus two prominent eyes, he
exploited himself back into an income of $10,000 a week! Verily, if one
has PERSISTENCE, one can get along very well without many other
qualities.

The only "break" anyone can afford to rely upon is a self-made "break."
These come through the application of PERSISTENCE. The starting point is
DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE.

Examine the first hundred people you meet, ask them what they want most
in life, and ninety eight of them will not be able to tell you. If you
press them for an answer, some will say--SECURITY, many will say--MONEY,
a few will say--HAPPINESS, others will say--FAME AND POWER, and still
others will say--SOCIAL RECOGNITION, EASE IN LIVING, ABILITY TO SING,
DANCE, or WRITE, but none of them will be able to define these terms, or
give the slightest indication of a PLAN by which they hope to attain
these vaguely expressed wishes. Riches do not respond to wishes. They
respond only to definite plans, backed by definite desires, through
constant PERSISTENCE.

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

How TO DEVELOP PERSISTENCE

There are four simple steps which lead to the habit of PERSISTENCE. They
call for no great amount of intelligence, no particular amount of
education, and but little time or effort. The necessary steps are:--

|     |                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. | A DEFINITE PURPOSE BACKED BY BURNING DESIRE FOR ITS FULFILLMENT.                                                                                |
| 2\. | A DEFINITE PLAN, EXPRESSED IN CONTINUOUS ACTION.                                                                                                |
| 3\. | A MIND CLOSED TIGHTLY AGAINST ALL NEGATIVE AND DISCOURAGING INFLUENCES, including negative suggestions of relatives, friends and acquaintances. |
| 4\. | A FRIENDLY ALLIANCE WITH ONE OR MORE PERSONS WHO WILL ENCOURAGE ONE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH BOTH PLAN AND PURPOSE.                               |

These four steps are essential for success in all walks of life. The
.entire purpose of the thirteen principles of this philosophy is to
enable one to take these four steps as a matter of *habit*.

These are the steps by which one may control one's economic destiny.

They are the steps that lead to freedom and independence of thought.

They are the steps that lead to riches, in small or great quantities.

They lead the way to power, fame, and worldly recognition.

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

They are the four steps which guarantee favorable "breaks."

They are the steps that convert dreams into physical realities.

They lead, also, to the mastery of FEAR, DISCOURAGEMENT, INDIFFERENCE.

There is a magnificent reward for all who learn to take these four
steps. It is the privilege of writing one's own ticket, and of making
Life yield whatever price is asked.

I have no way of knowing the facts, but I venture to conjecture that
Mrs. Wallis Simpson's great love for a man was not accidental, nor the
result of favorable "breaks" alone. There was a burning desire, and
careful searching at every step of the way. Her first duty was to love.
What is the greatest thing on earth? The Master called it love--not man
made rules, criticism, bitterness, slander, or political "marriages,"
but love.

She knew what she wanted, not after she met the Prince of Wales, but
long before that. Twice when she had failed to find it, she had the
courage to continue her search. "To thine own self be true, and it must
follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man."

Her rise from obscurity was of the slow, progressive, PERSISTENT order,
but it was SURE! She triumphed over unbelievably long odds; and, no
matter who you are, or what you may think of Wallis Simpson, or the king
who gave up his Crown for her love, she is an astounding example of
applied PERSISTENCE, an instructor on the rules of self-determination,

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

from whom the entire world might profitably take lessons.

When you think of Wallis Simpson, think of one who knew what she wanted,
and shook the greatest empire on earth to get it. Women who complain
that this is a man's world, that women do not have an equal chance to
win, owe it to themselves to study carefully the life of this unusual
woman, who, at an age which most women consider "old," captured the
affections of the most desirable bachelor in the entire world.

And what of King Edward? What lesson may we learn from his part in the
world's greatest drama of recent times? Did he pay too high a price for
the affections of the woman of his choice?

Surely no one but he can give the correct answer.

The rest of us can only conjecture. This much we know, the king came
into the world without his own consent. He was born to great riches,
without requesting them. He was persistently sought in marriage;
politicians and statesmen throughout Europe tossed dowagers and
princesses at his feet. Because he was the first born of his parents, he
inherited a crown, which he did not seek, and perhaps did not desire.
For more than forty years he was not a free agent, could not live his
life in his own way, had but little privacy, and finally assumed duties
inflicted upon him when he ascended the throne.

Some will say, "With all these blessings, King Edward should have found
peace of mind, contentment, and joy of living."

The truth is that back of all the privileges of a crown, all the money,
the fame, and the power inherited

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

by King Edward, there was an emptiness which could be filled only by
love.

His greatest DESIRE was for love. Long before he met Wallis Simpson, he
doubtless felt this great universal emotion tugging at the strings of
his heart, beating upon the door of his soul, and crying out for
expression.

And when he met a kindred spirit, crying out for this same Holy
privilege of expression, he recognized it, and without fear or apology,
opened his heart and bade it enter. All the scandal-mongers in the world
cannot destroy the beauty of this international drama, through which two
people found love, and had the courage to face open criticism, renounce
ALL ELSE to give it *holy* expression.

King Edward's DECISION to give up the crown of the world's most powerful
empire, for the privilege of going the remainder of the way through life
with the woman of his choice, was a decision that required courage. The
decision also had a price, but who has the right to say the price was
too great? Surely not He who said, "He among you who is without sin, let
him cast the first stone."

As a suggestion to any evil-minded person who chooses to find fault with
the Duke of Windsor, because his DESIRE was for LOVE, and for openly
declaring his love for Wallis Simpson, and giving up his throne for her,
let it be remembered that the OPEN DECLARATION was not essential. He
could have followed the custom of clandestine liaison which has
prevailed in Europe for centuries, without giving up either his throne,
or the woman of his choice, and there would have been NO COMPLAINT

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> FROM EITHER CHURCH
OR LAITY. But this unusual man was built of sterner stuff. His love was
clean. It was deep and sincere. It represented the one thing which,
above ALL ELSE he truly DESIRED, therefore, he took what he wanted, and
paid the price demanded.

If Europe had been blessed with more rulers with the human heart and the
traits of honesty of ex-king Edward, for the past century, that
unfortunate hemisphere now seething with greed, hate, lust, political
connivance, and threats of war, would have a DIFFERENT AND A BETTER
STORY TO TELL. A story in which Love and not Hate would rule.

In the words of Stuart Austin Wier we raise our cup and drink this toast
to ex-king Edward and Wallis Simpson:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Blessed is the man who has come to know that our muted thoughts are our
sweetest thoughts.  
"Blessed is the man who, from the blackest depths, can see the luminous
figure of LOVE, and seeing, sing; and singing, say: 'Sweeter far than
uttered lays are the thoughts I have of you.'"

</div>

In these words would we pay tribute to the two people who, more than all
others of modern times, have been the victims of criticism and the
recipients of abuse, because they found Life's greatest treasure, and
claimed it. <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md)

Most of the world will applaud the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson,
because of their PERSISTENCE in searching until they found life's
greatest reward. ALL OF US CAN PROFIT by

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

following their example in our own search for that which we demand of
life.

What mystical power gives to men of PERSISTENCE the capacity to master
difficulties? Does the quality of PERSISTENCE set up in one's mind some
form of spiritual, mental or chemical activity which gives one access to
supernatural forces? Does Infinite Intelligence throw itself on the side
of the person who still fights on, after the battle has been lost, with
the whole world on the opposing side?

These and many other similar questions have arisen in my mind as I have
observed men like Henry Ford, who started at scratch, and built an
Industrial Empire of huge proportions, with little else in the way of a
beginning but PERSISTENCE. Or, Thomas A. Edison, who, with less than
three months of schooling, became the world's leading inventor and
converted PERSISTENCE into the talking machine, the moving picture
machine, and the incandescent light, to say nothing of half a hundred
other useful inventions.

I had the happy privilege of analyzing both Mr. Edison and Mr. Ford,
year by year, over a long period of years, and therefore, the
opportunity to study them at close range, so I speak from actual
knowledge when I say that I found no quality save PERSISTENCE, in either
of them, that even remotely suggested the major source of their
stupendous achievements.

As one makes an impartial study of the prophets, philosophers, "miracle"
men, and religious leaders of the past, one is drawn to the inevitable
conclusion that PERSISTENCE, concentration of effort,

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

and DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE, were the major sources of their
achievements.

Consider, for example, the strange and fascinating story of Mohammed;
analyze his life, compare him with men of achievement in this modern age
of industry and finance, and observe how they have one outstanding trait
in common, PERSISTENCE!

If you are keenly interested in studying the strange power which gives
potency to PERSISTENCE, read a biography of Mohammed, especially the one
by Essad Bey. This brief review of that book, by Thomas Sugrue, in the
Herald-Tribune, will provide a preview of the rare treat in store for
those who take the time to read the entire story of one of the most
astounding examples of the power of PERSISTENCE known to civilization.

THE LAST GREAT PROPHET

Reviewed by Thomas Sugrue

.     .     .     .     .

"Mohammed was a prophet, but he never performed a miracle. He was not a
mystic; he had no formal schooling; he did not begin his mission until
he was forty. When he announced that he was the Messenger of God,
bringing word of the true religion, he was ridiculed and labeled a
lunatic. Children tripped him and women threw filth upon him. He was
banished from his native city, Mecca, and his followers were stripped of
their worldly goods and sent into the desert after him. When he had been
preaching ten years he had nothing to show for it but banishment,
poverty and ridicule. Yet before another ten years had passed, he was
dictator

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

of all Arabia, ruler of Mecca, and the head of a New World religion
which was to sweep to the Danube and the Pyrenees before exhausting the
impetus he gave it. That impetus was three-fold: the power of words, the
efficacy of prayer and man's kinship with God.

"His career never made sense. Mohammed was born to impoverished members
of a leading family of Mecca. Because Mecca, the crossroads of the
world, home of the magic stone called the Caaba, great city of trade and
the center of trade routes, was unsanitary, its children were sent to be
raised in the desert by Bedouins. Mohammed was thus nurtured, drawing
strength and health from the milk of nomad, vicarious mothers. He tended
sheep and soon hired out to a rich widow as leader of her caravans. He
traveled to all parts of the Eastern World, talked with many men of
diverse beliefs and observed the decline of Christianity into warring
sects. When he was twenty-eight, Khadija, the widow, looked upon him
with favor, and married him. Her father would have objected to such a
marriage, so she got him drunk and held him up while he gave the
paternal blessing. For the next twelve years Mohammed lived as a rich
and respected and very shrewd trader. Then he took to wandering in the
desert, and one day he returned with the first verse of the Koran and
told Khadija that the archangel Gabriel had appeared to him and said
that he was to be the Messenger of God.

"The Koran, the revealed word of God, was the closest thing to a miracle
in Mohammed's life. He had not been a poet; he had no gift of words. Yet

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

the verses of the Koran, as he received them and recited them to the
faithful, were better than any verses which the professional poets of
the tribes could produce. This, to the Arabs, was a miracle. To them the
gift of words was the greatest gift, the poet was all-powerful. In
addition the Koran said that all men were equal before God, that the
world should be a democratic state Islam. It was this political heresy,
plus Mohammed's desire to destroy all the 360 idols in the courtyard of
the Caaba, which brought about his banishment. The idols brought the
desert tribes to Mecca, and that meant trade. So the business men of
Mecca, the capitalists, of which he had been one, set upon Mohammed.
Then he retreated to the desert and demanded sovereignty over the world.

"The rise of Islam began. Out of the desert came a flame which would not
be extinguished--a democratic army fighting as a unit and prepared to
die without wincing. Mohammed had invited the Jews and Christians to
join him; for he was not building a new religion. He was calling all who
believed in one God to join in a single faith. If the Jews and
Christians had accepted his invitation Islam would have conquered the
world. They didn't. They would not even accept Mohammed's innovation of
humane warfare. When the armies of the prophet entered Jerusalem not a
single person was killed because of his faith. When the crusaders
entered the city, centuries later, not a Moslem man, woman, or child was
spared. But the Christians did accept one Moslem idea--the place of
learning, the university."
