This is one of the best-selling self-help books of all time. Written
during the Great Depression, against a backdrop of millions of people
out of work and a looming world war, Napoleon Hill's *magnum opus* held
out hope that life could get better. While not considered part of the
New Thought movement, Hill drew on many of their concepts and
techniques. He prefigured the 'Prosperity Consciousness' of present-day
New Age thinkers. And a host of motivational writers and speakers have
followed in his footsteps.

A good part of Hill's book is simply the gospel of 20th century American
Capitalism: work hard, have a firm handshake, get ahead by doing quality
work, treat your customers with respect, anybody can become rich and/or
powerful if they overcome their personal weaknesses. Some may find the
core 'secret' of this book elusive; Hill never gives us a succinct
formula to acquiring wealth, although he hints that it exists. However,
the title of the book is '*Think* and Grow Rich,' *not* 'Get Rich
Quick': Hill insists that we take a very detailed personal inventory,
and grow spiritually, in order to draw wealth our way. This involves a
developing a high level of self-discipline and obeying the Delphic
injunction to 'Know Thyself'. He also incorporates a lot of good,
practical business advice: find new opportunities created by
technological innovations, make a written plan and keep to it, don't be
afraid to fail repeatedly. The secret is here, it is just simply the sum
of parts rather than an explicit roadmap.

Towards the end of the book he steps off a precipice and ventures into
some very esoteric territory. He discusses harnessing Kundalini energy,
manifesting psychic powers such as telepathy, tapping into higher
consciousness, and getting in touch with the great minds of history,
although, again, he is not too specific about how to accomplish these
feats.

Think and Grow Rich is one of those books which makes a lasting
impression. No matter what you may think of Hill's philosophy and his
folksy writing style, you are bound to come away from this book feeling
energized, more optimistic about life, and (possibly) a bit richer for
the experience. *--J. B. Hare, 7/20/2006*
