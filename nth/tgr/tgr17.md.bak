THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND consists of a field of consciousness, in which
every impulse of thought that reaches the objective mind through any of
the five senses, is classified and recorded, and from which thoughts may
be recalled or withdrawn as letters may be taken from a filing cabinet.

It receives, and files, sense impressions or thoughts, regardless of
their nature. You may VOLUNTARILY plant in your subconscious mind any
plan, thought, or purpose which you desire to translate into its
physical or monetary equivalent. The subconscious acts first on the
dominating desires which have been mixed with emotional feeling, such as
faith.

Consider this in connection with the instructions given in the chapter
on DESIRE, for taking the six steps there outlined, and the instructions
given in the chapter on the building and execution of plans, and you
will understand the importance of the thought conveyed.

THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND WORKS DAY AND NIGHT. Through a method of
procedure, unknown to man, the subconscious mind draws upon the forces
of Infinite Intelligence for the power with which it voluntarily
transmutes one's desires into their physical equivalent, making use,

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

always of the most practical media by which this end may be
accomplished.

You cannot *entirely* control your subconscious mind, but you can
voluntarily hand over to it any plan, desire, or purpose which you wish
transformed into concrete form. Read, again, instructions for using the
subconscious mind, in the chapter on autosuggestion.

There is plenty of evidence to support the belief that the subconscious
mind is the connecting link between the finite mind of man and Infinite
Intelligence. It is the intermediary through which one may draw upon the
forces of Infinite Intelligence at will. It, alone, contains the secret
process by which mental impulses are modified and changed into their
spiritual equivalent. It, alone, is the medium through which prayer may
be transmitted to the source capable of answering prayer.

The possibilities of creative effort connected with the subconscious
mind are stupendous and imponderable. They inspire one with awe.

I never approach the discussion of the subconscious mind without a
feeling of littleness and inferiority due, perhaps, to the fact that
man's entire stock of knowledge on this subject is so pitifully limited.
The very fact that the subconscious mind is the medium of communication
between the thinking mind of man and Infinite Intelligence is, of
itself, a thought which almost paralyzes one's reason.

After you have accepted, as a reality, the existence of the subconscious
mind, and understand its possibilities, as a medium for transmuting your

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> DESIRES into their
physical or monetary equivalent, you will comprehend the full
significance of the instructions given in the chapter on DESIRE. You
will also understand why you have been repeatedly admonished to MAKE
YOUR DESIRES CLEAR, AND TO REDUCE THEM TO WRITING. You will also
understand the necessity of PERSISTENCE in carrying out instructions.

The thirteen principles are the stimuli with which you acquire the
ability to reach, and to influence your subconscious mind. Do not become
discouraged, if you cannot do this upon the first attempt. Remember that
the subconscious mind may be voluntarily directed *only through habit*,
under the directions given in the chapter on FAITH. You have not yet had
time to master faith. Be patient. Be persistent.

A good many statements in the chapters on faith and auto-suggestion will
be repeated here, for the benefit of YOUR subconscious mind. Remember,
your subconscious mind functions voluntarily, *whether you make any
effort to influence it or not.* This, naturally, suggests to you that
thoughts of fear and poverty, and all negative thoughts serve as stimuli
to your subconscious mind, unless, you master these impulses and give it
more desirable food upon which it may feed.

The subconscious mind will not remain idle! If you fail to plant DESIRES
in your subconscious mind, it will feed upon the thoughts which reach it
as the *result of your neglect*. We have already explained that thought
impulses, both negative and positive are reaching the subconscious mind
continuously,

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

from the four sources which were mentioned in the chapter on Sex
Transmutation.

For the present, it is sufficient if you remember that you are living
*daily*, in the midst of all manner of thought impulses which are
reaching your subconscious mind, without your knowledge. Some of these
impulses are negative, some are positive. You are now engaged in trying
to help shut off the flow of negative impulses, and to aid in
voluntarily influencing your subconscious mind, through positive
impulses of DESIRE.

When you achieve this, you will possess the key which unlocks the door
to your subconscious mind. Moreover, you will control that door so
completely, that no undesirable thought may influence your subconscious
mind.

Everything which man creates, BEGINS in the form of a thought impulse.
Man can create nothing which he does not first conceive in THOUGHT.
Through the aid of the imagination, thought impulses may be assembled
into plans. The imagination, when under control, may be used for the
creation of plans or purposes that lead to success in one's chosen
occupation.

All thought impulses, intended for transmutation into their physical
equivalent, voluntarily planted in the subconscious mind, must pass
through the imagination, and be mixed with faith. The "mixing" of faith
with a plan, or purpose, intended for submission to the subconscious
mind, may be done ONLY through the imagination.

From these statements, you will readily observe that voluntary use of
the subconscious mind calls

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

for coordination and application of all the principles.

Ella Wheeler Wilcox gave evidence of her understanding of the power of
the subconscious mind when she wrote:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"You never can tell what a thought will do  
  In bringing you hate or love--  
For thoughts are things, and their airy wings  
  Are swifter than carrier doves.  
They follow the law of the universe--  
  Each thing creates its kind,  
And they speed O’er the track to bring you back  
  Whatever went out from your mind."

</div>

Mrs. Wilcox understood the truth, that thoughts which go out from one's
mind, also imbed themselves deeply in one's subconscious mind, where
they serve as a magnet, pattern, or blueprint by which the subconscious
mind is influenced while translating them into their physical
equivalent. Thoughts are truly things, for the reason that every
material thing begins in the form of thought-energy.

The subconscious mind is more susceptible to influence by impulses of
thought mixed with "feeling" or emotion, than by those originating
solely in the reasoning portion of the mind. In fact, there is much
evidence to support the theory, that ONLY emotionalized thoughts have
any ACTION influence upon the subconscious mind. It is a well known fact
that emotion or feeling, rules the majority of people. If it is true
that the subconscious mind responds more quickly to, and is influenced

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

more readily by thought impulses which are well mixed with emotion, it
is essential to become familiar with the more important of the emotions.
There are seven major positive emotions, and seven major negative
emotions. The negatives voluntarily inject themselves into the thought
impulses, which insure passage into the subconscious mind. The positives
must be injected, through the principle of auto-suggestion, into the
thought impulses which an individual wishes to pass on to his
subconscious mind. (Instructions have been given in the chapter on
auto-suggestion.)

These emotions, or feeling impulses, may be likened to yeast in a loaf
of bread, because they constitute the ACTION element, which transforms
thought impulses from the passive to the active state. Thus may one
understand why thought impulses, which have been well mixed with
emotion, are acted upon more readily than thought impulses originating
in "cold reason."

You are preparing yourself to influence and control the "inner audience"
of your subconscious mind, in order to hand over to it the DESIRE for
money, which you wish transmuted into its monetary equivalent. It is
essential, therefore, that you understand the method of approach to this
"inner audience." You must speak its language, or it will not heed your
call. It understands best the language of emotion or feeling. Let us,
therefore describe here the seven major positive emotions, and the seven
major negative emotions, so that you may draw upon the positives, and
avoid the negatives, when giving instructions to your subconscious mind.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

THE SEVEN MAJOR POSITIVE EMOTIONS

There are other positive emotions, but these are the seven most
powerful, and the ones most commonly used in creative effort. Master
these seven emotions (they can be mastered only by USE), and the other
positive emotions will be at your command when you need them. Remember,
in this connection, that you are studying a book which is intended to
help you develop a "money consciousness" by *filling your mind with
positive emotions*. One does not become money conscious by filling one's
mind with negative emotions.

THE SEVEN MAJOR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS  
(To be avoided)

*Positive and negative emotions cannot occupy the mind at the same
time*. One or the other must dominate. It is your responsibility to make
sure

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

that positive emotions constitute the dominating influence of your mind.
Here the law of HABIT will come to your aid. *Form the habit of applying
and using the positive emotions!* Eventually, they will dominate your
mind so completely, that the negatives *cannot enter it*.

Only by following these instructions literally, and continuously, can
you gain control over your subconscious mind. The presence of a single
negative in your conscious mind is sufficient to *destroy* all chances
of constructive aid from your subconscious mind.

If you are an observing person, you must have noticed that most people
resort to prayer ONLY after everything else has FAILED! Or else they
pray by a ritual of meaningless words. And, because it is a fact that
most people who pray, do so ONLY AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE HAS FAILED, they
go to prayer with their minds filled with FEAR and DOUBT, *which are the
emotions the subconscious mind acts upon*, and passes on to Infinite
Intelligence. Likewise, that is the emotion which Infinite Intelligence
receives, and ACTS UPON.

If you pray for a thing, but have fear as you pray, that you may not
receive it, or that your prayer will not be acted upon by Infinite
Intelligence, your prayer *will have been in vain*.

Prayer does, sometimes, result in the realization of that for which one
prays. If you have ever had the experience of receiving that for which
you prayed, go back in your memory, and recall your actual STATE OF
MIND, while you were praying,

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

and you will know, for sure, that the theory here described is more than
a theory.

The time will come when the schools and educational institutions of the
country will teach the "science of prayer." Moreover, then prayer may
be, and will be reduced to a science. When that time comes, (it will
come as soon as mankind is ready for it, and demands it), no one will
approach the Universal Mind in a state of fear, for the very good reason
that there will be no such emotion as fear. Ignorance, superstition, and
false teaching will have disappeared, and man will have attained his
true status as a child of Infinite Intelligence. A few have already
attained this blessing.

If you believe this prophesy is far-fetched, take a look at the human
race in retrospect. Less than a hundred years ago, men believed the
lightning to be evidence of the wrath of God, and feared it. Now, thanks
to the power of FAITH, men have harnessed the lightning and made it turn
the wheels of industry. Much less than a hundred years ago, men believed
the space between the planets to be nothing but a great void, a stretch
of dead nothingness. Now, thanks to this same power of FAITH, men know
that far from being either dead or a void, the space between the planets
is very much alive, that it is the highest form of vibration known,
excepting, perhaps, the vibration of THOUGHT. Moreover, men know that
this living, pulsating, vibratory energy which permeates every atom of
matter, and fills every niche of space, connects every human brain with
every other human brain.

What reason have men to believe that this same

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

energy does not connect every human brain with Infinite Intelligence?

There are no toll-gates between the finite mind of man and Infinite
Intelligence. The communication costs nothing except Patience, Faith,
Persistence, Understanding, and a SINCERE DESIRE to communicate.
Moreover, the approach can be made only by the individual himself. Paid
prayers are worthless. Infinite Intelligence does no business by proxy.
You either go direct, or you do not communicate.

You may buy prayer books and repeat them until the day of your doom,
without avail. Thoughts which you wish to communicate to Infinite
Intelligence, must undergo transformation, such as can be given only
through your own subconscious mind.

The method by which you may communicate with Infinite Intelligence is
very similar to that through which the vibration of sound is
communicated by radio. If you understand the working principle of radio,
you of course, know that sound cannot be communicated through the ether
until it has been "stepped up," or changed into a rate of vibration
which the human ear cannot detect. The radio sending station picks up
the sound of the human voice, and "scrambles," or modifies it by
stepping up the vibration millions of times. Only in this way, can the
vibration of sound be communicated through the ether. After this
transformation has taken place, the ether "picks up" the energy (which
originally was in the form of vibrations of sound), carries that energy
to radio receiving stations, and these receiving sets "step" that energy
back down

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

to its original rate of vibration so it is recognized as sound.

The subconscious mind is the intermediary, which translates one's
prayers into terms which Infinite Intelligence can recognize, presents
the message, and brings back the answer in the form of a definite plan
or idea for procuring the object of the prayer. Understand this
principle, and you will know why mere words read from a prayer book
cannot, and will never serve as an agency of communication between the
mind of man and Infinite Intelligence.

Before your prayer will reach Infinite Intelligence (a statement of the
author's theory only), it probably is transformed from its original
thought vibration into terms of spiritual vibration. Faith is the only
known agency which will give your thoughts a spiritual nature. FAITH and
FEAR make poor bedfellows. *Where one is found, the other cannot exist*.
