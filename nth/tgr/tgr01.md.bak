### WHAT DO YOU WANT MOST?

*Is It Money, Fame, Power, Contentment, Personality, Peace of Mind,
Happiness?*

The Thirteen Steps to Riches described in this book offer the shortest
dependable philosophy of individual achievement ever presented for the
benefit of the man or woman who is searching for a definite goal in
life.

Before beginning the book you will profit greatly if you recognize the
fact that the book was not written to entertain. You cannot digest the
contents properly in a week or a month.

After reading the book thoroughly, Dr. Miller Reese Hutchison,
nationally known Consulting Engineer and long-time associate of Thomas
A. Edison, said--

"This is not a novel. It is a textbook on individual achievement that
came directly from the experiences of hundreds of America's most
successful men. It should be *studied*, *digested*, and meditated upon.
No more than one chapter should be read in a single night. The reader
should underline the sentences which impress him most. Later, he should
go back to these marked lines and read them again. *A real student will
not merely read this book*, he will absorb its contents and make them
his own. This book should be adopted by all high schools and no boy or
girl should be permitted to graduate without having satisfactorily
passed an examination on it. This philosophy will not take the place of
the subjects taught in schools, but it will enable one to *organize and
apply* the knowledge acquired, and convert it into useful service and
adequate compensation without waste of time."

Dr. John R. Turner, Dean of the College of The City of New York, after
having read the book, said--

"The very best example of the soundness of this philosophy is your own
son, Blair, whose dramatic story you have outlined in the chapter on
Desire."

Dr. Turner had reference to the author's son, who, born without normal
hearing capacity, not only avoided becoming a deaf mute, but actually
converted his handicap into a priceless asset by applying the philosophy
here described. After

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

reading the story (starting on page [52](tgr07.htm#page_52).md), you will
realize that you are about to come into possession of a philosophy which
can be transmuted into material wealth, or serve as readily to bring you
peace of mind, understanding, spiritual harmony, and in some instances,
as in the case of the author's son, it can help you master physical
affliction.

The author discovered, through personally analyzing hundreds of
successful men, that *all* of them followed the habit of exchanging
ideas, through what is commonly called *conferences*. When they had
problems to be solved they sat down together and talked freely until
they discovered, from their joint contribution of ideas, a plan that
would serve their purpose.

You, who read this book, will get most out of it by putting into
practice the Master Mind principle described in the book. This you can
do (as others are doing so successfully) by forming a study club,
consisting of any desired number of people who are friendly and
harmonious. The club should have a meeting at regular periods, as often
as once each week. The procedure should consist of reading one chapter
of the book at each meeting, after which the contents of the chapter
should be freely discussed by all members. Each member should make
notes, putting down *ALL IDEAS OF HIS OWN* inspired by the discussion.
Each member should carefully read and analyze each chapter several days
prior to its open reading and joint discussion in the club. The reading
at the club should be done by someone who reads well and understands how
to put color and feeling into the lines.

By following this plan every reader will get from its pages, not only
the sum total of the best knowledge organized from the experiences of
hundreds of successful men, but more important by far, *he will tap new
sources of knowledge in his own mind as well as acquire knowledge of
priceless value FROM EVERY OTHER PERSON PRESENT*.

If you follow this plan persistently you will be almost certain to
uncover and appropriate the secret formula by which Andrew Carnegie
acquired his huge fortune, as referred to in the author's introduction.
