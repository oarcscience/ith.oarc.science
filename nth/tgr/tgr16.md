THE meaning of the word "transmute" is, in simple language, "the
changing, or transferring of one element, or form of energy, into
another."

The emotion of sex brings into being a state of mind.

Because of ignorance on the subject, this state of mind is generally
associated with the physical, and because of improper influences, to
which most people have been subjected, in acquiring knowledge of sex,
things essentially physical have highly biased the mind.

The emotion of sex has back of it the possibility of three constructive
potentialities, they are:--

|     |                                                                        |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. | The perpetuation of mankind.                                           |
| 2\. | The maintenance of health, (as a therapeutic agency, it has no equal). |
| 3\. | The transformation of mediocrity into genius through transmutation.    |

Sex transmutation is simple and easily explained. It means the switching
of the mind from thoughts of physical expression, to thoughts of some
other nature.

Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires.

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When driven by
this desire, men develop keenness of imagination, courage, will-power,
persistence, and creative ability unknown to them at other times. So
strong and impelling is the desire for sexual contact that men freely
run the risk of life and reputation to indulge it. When harnessed, and
redirected along other lines, this motivating force maintains all of its
attributes of keenness of imagination, courage, etc., which may be used
as powerful creative forces in literature, art, or in any other
profession or calling, including, of course, the accumulation of riches.

The transmutation of sex energy calls for the exercise of will-power, to
be sure, but the reward is worth the effort. The desire for sexual
expression is inborn and natural. The desire cannot, and should not be
submerged or eliminated. But it should be given an outlet through forms
of expression which enrich the body, mind, and spirit of man. If not
given this form of outlet, through transmutation, it will seek outlets
through purely physical channels.

A river may be dammed, and its water controlled for a time, but
eventually, it will force an outlet. The same is true of the emotion of
sex. It may be submerged and controlled for a time, but its very nature
causes it to be ever seeking means of expression. If it is not
transmuted into some creative effort it will find a less worthy outlet.

Fortunate, indeed, is the person who has discovered how to give sex
emotion an outlet through some form of creative effort, for he has, by
that discovery, lifted himself to the status of a genius.

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

Scientific research has disclosed these significant facts:

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. | The men of greatest achievement are men with highly developed sex natures; men who have learned the art of sex transmutation.                                                                 |
| 2\. | The men who have accumulated great fortunes and achieved outstanding recognition in literature, art, industry, architecture, and the professions, were motivated by the influence of a woman. |

The research from which these astounding discoveries were made, went
back through the pages of biography and history for more than two
thousand years. Wherever there was evidence available in connection with
the lives of men and women of great achievement, it indicated most
convincingly that they possessed highly developed sex natures.

The emotion of sex is an "irresistible force," against which there can
be no such opposition as an "immovable body." When driven by this
emotion, men become gifted with a super power for action. Understand
this truth, and you will catch the significance of the statement that
sex transmutation will lift one to the status of a genius.

The emotion of sex contains the secret of creative ability.

Destroy the sex glands, whether in man or beast, and you have removed
the major source of action. For proof of this, observe what happens to
any animal after it has been castrated. A bull becomes as docile as a
cow after it has been altered sexually. Sex alteration takes out of the
male, whether man

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

or beast, all the FIGHT that was in him. Sex alteration of the female
has the same effect.

THE TEN MIND STIMULI

The human mind responds to stimuli, through which it may be "keyed up"
to high rates of vibration, known as enthusiasm, creative imagination,
intense desire, etc. The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely
are:--

|      |                                                                                                                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\.  | The desire for sex expression                                                                                                  |
| 2\.  | Love                                                                                                                           |
| 3\.  | A burning desire for fame, power, or financial gain, MONEY                                                                     |
| 4\.  | Music                                                                                                                          |
| 5\.  | Friendship between either those of the same sex, or those of the opposite sex.                                                 |
| 6\.  | A Master Mind alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement. |
| 7\.  | Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are persecuted.                                                       |
| 8\.  | Auto-suggestion                                                                                                                |
| 9\.  | Fear                                                                                                                           |
| 10\. | Narcotics and alcohol.                                                                                                         |

The desire for sex expression comes at the head of the list of stimuli,
which most effectively "step-up" the vibrations of the mind and start
the "wheels" of physical action. Eight of these stimuli are natural and
constructive. Two are destructive. The list is here presented for the
purpose of enabling

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

you to make a comparative study of the major sources of mind
stimulation. From this study, it will be readily seen that the emotion
of sex is, by great odds, the most intense and powerful of all mind
stimuli.

This comparison is necessary as a foundation for proof of the statement
that transmutation of sex energy may lift one to the status of a genius.
Let us find out what constitutes a genius.

Some wiseacre has said that a genius is a man who "wears long hair, eats
queer food, lives alone, and serves as a target for the joke makers." A
better definition of a genius is, "a man who has discovered how to
increase the vibrations of thought to the point where he can freely
communicate with sources of knowledge not available through the ordinary
rate of vibration of thought."

The person who thinks will want to ask some questions concerning this
definition of genius. The first question will be, "How may one
communicate with sources of knowledge which are not available through
the ORDINARY rate of vibration of thought?"

The next question will be, "Are there known sources of knowledge which
are available only to genii, and if so, WHAT ARE THESE SOURCES, and
exactly how may they be reached?"

We shall offer proof of the soundness of some of the more important
statements made in this book--or at least we shall offer evidence
through which you may secure your own proof through experimentation, and
in doing so, we shall answer both of these questions.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

"GENIUS" IS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE SIXTH SENSE

The reality of a "sixth sense" has been fairly well established. This
sixth sense is "Creative Imagination." The faculty of creative
imagination is one which the majority of people never use during an
entire lifetime, and if used at all, it usually happens by mere
accident. A relatively small number of people use, WITH DELIBERATION AND
PURPOSE AFORETHOUGHT, the faculty of creative imagination. Those who use
this faculty voluntarily, and with understanding of its functions, are
GENII.

The faculty of creative imagination is the direct link between the
finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence. All so-called revelations,
referred to in the realm of religion, and all discoveries of basic or
new principles in the field of invention, take place through the faculty
of creative imagination.

When ideas or concepts flash into one's mind, through what is popularly
called a "hunch," they come from one or more of the following sources:--

|     |                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. | Infinite Intelligence                                                                                                                             |
| 2\. | One's subconscious mind, wherein is stored every sense impression and thought impulse which ever reached the brain through any of the five senses |
| 3\. | From the mind of some other person who has just released the thought, or picture of the idea or concept, through conscious thought, or            |
| 4\. | From the other person's subconscious storehouse.                                                                                                  |

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

There are no other KNOWN sources from which "inspired" ideas or
"hunches" may be received.

The creative imagination functions best when the mind is vibrating (due
to some form of mind stimulation) at an exceedingly high rate. That is,
when the mind is functioning at a rate of vibration higher than that of
ordinary, normal thought.

When brain action has been stimulated, through one or more of the ten
mind stimulants, it has the effect of lifting the individual far above
the horizon of ordinary thought, and permits him to envision distance,
scope, and quality of THOUGHTS not available on the lower plane, such as
that occupied while one is engaged in the solution of the problems of
business and professional routine.

When lifted to this higher level of thought, through any form of mind
stimulation, an individual occupies, relatively, the same position as
one who has ascended in an airplane to a height from which he may see
over and beyond the horizon line which limits his vision, while on the
ground. Moreover, while on this higher level of thought, the individual
is not hampered or bound by any of the stimuli which circumscribe and
limit his vision while wrestling with the problems of gaining the three
basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. He is in a world of
thought in which the ORDINARY, work-a-day thoughts have been as
effectively removed as are the hills and valleys and other limitations
of physical vision, when he rises in an airplane.

While on this exalted plane of THOUGHT, the creative faculty of the mind
is given freedom for

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

action. The way has been cleared for the sixth sense to function, it
becomes receptive to ideas which could not reach the individual under
any other circumstances. The "sixth sense" is the faculty which marks
the difference between a genius and an ordinary individual.

The creative faculty becomes more alert and receptive to vibrations,
originating outside the individual's subconscious mind, the more this
faculty is used, and the more the individual relies upon it, and makes
demands upon it for thought impulses. This faculty can be cultivated and
developed only through use.

That which is known as one's "conscience" operates entirely through the
faculty of the sixth sense.

The great artists, writers, musicians, and poets become great, because
they acquire the habit of relying upon the "still small voice" which
speaks from within, through the faculty of creative imagination. It is a
fact well known to people who have "keen" imaginations that their best
ideas come through so-called "hunches."

There is a great orator who does not attain to greatness, until he
closes his eyes and begins to rely entirely upon the faculty of Creative
Imagination. When asked why he closed his eyes just before the climaxes
of his oratory, he replied, "I do it, because, then I speak through
ideas which come to me from within."

One of America's most successful and best known financiers followed the
habit of closing his eyes for two or three minutes before making a
decision.

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When asked why he
did this, he replied, "With my eyes closed, I am able to draw upon a
source of superior intelligence."

The late Dr. Elmer R. Gates, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, created more than
200 useful patents, many of them basic, through the process of
cultivating and using the creative faculty. His method is both
significant and interesting to one interested in attaining to the status
of genius, in which category Dr. Gates, unquestionably belonged. Dr.
Gates was one of the really great, though less publicized scientists of
the world.

In his laboratory, he had what he called his "personal communication
room." It was practically sound proof, and so arranged that all light
could be shut out. It was equipped with a small table, on which he kept
a pad of writing paper. In front of the table, on the wall, was an
electric pushbutton, which controlled the lights. When Dr. Gates desired
to draw upon the forces available to him through his Creative
Imagination, he would go into this room, seat himself at the table, shut
off the lights, and CONCENTRATE upon the KNOWN factors of the invention
on which he was working, remaining in that position until ideas began to
"flash" into his mind in connection with the UNKNOWN factors of the
invention.

On one occasion, ideas came through so fast that he was forced to write
for almost three hours. When the thoughts stopped flowing, and he
examined his notes, he found they contained a minute description of
principles which had not a parallel among the known data of the
scientific world.

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Moreover, the
answer to his problem was intelligently presented in those notes. In
this manner Dr. Gates completed over 200 patents, which had been begun,
but not completed, by "half-baked" brains. Evidence of the truth of this
statement is in the United States Patent Office.

Dr. Gates earned his living by "sitting for ideas" for individuals and
corporations. Some of the largest corporations in America paid him
substantial fees, by the hour, for "sitting for ideas."

The reasoning faculty is often faulty, because it is largely guided by
one's accumulated experience. Not all knowledge, which one accumulates
through "experience," is accurate. Ideas received through the creative
faculty are much more reliable, for the reason that they come from
sources more reliable than any which are available to the reasoning
faculty of the mind.

The major difference between the genius and the ordinary "crank"
inventor, may be found in the fact that the genius works through his
faculty of creative imagination, while the "crank" knows nothing of this
faculty. The scientific inventor (such as Mr. Edison, and Dr. Gates),
makes use of both the synthetic and the creative faculties of
imagination.

For example, the scientific inventor, or "genius," begins an invention
by organizing and combining the known ideas, or principles accumulated
through experience, through the synthetic faculty (the reasoning
faculty). If he finds this accumulated knowledge to be insufficient for
the completion of his invention, he then draws upon the sources of

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

knowledge available to him through his creative faculty. The method by
which he does this varies with the individual, but this is the sum and
substance of his procedure:

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. | HE STIMULATES HIS MIND SO THAT IT VIBRATES ON A HIGHER-THAN-AVERAGE PLANE, using one or more of the ten mind stimulants or some other stimulant of his choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2\. | HE CONCENTRATES upon the known factors (the finished part) of his invention, and creates in his mind a perfect picture of unknown factors (the unfinished part), of his invention. He holds this picture in mind until it has been taken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of ALL thought, and waits for his answer to "flash" into his mind. |

Sometimes the results are both definite and immediate. At other times,
the results are negative, depending upon the state of development of the
"sixth sense," or creative faculty.

Mr. Edison tried out more than 10,000 different combinations of ideas
through the synthetic faculty of his imagination before he "tuned in"
through the creative faculty, and got the answer which perfected the
incandescent light. His experience was similar when he produced the
talking machine.

There is plenty of reliable evidence that the faculty of creative
imagination exists. This evidence is available through accurate analysis
of men who have become leaders in their respective callings, without
having had extensive educations. Lincoln was a notable example of a
great leader

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

who achieved greatness, through the discovery, and use of his faculty of
creative imagination. He discovered, and began to use this faculty as
the result of the stimulation of love which he experienced after he met
Anne Rutledge, a statement of the highest significance, in connection
with the study of the source of genius.

The pages of history are filled with the records of great leaders whose
achievements may be traced directly to the influence of women who
aroused the creative faculties of their minds, through the stimulation
of sex desire. Napoleon Bonaparte was one of these. When inspired by his
first wife, Josephine, he was irresistible and invincible. When his
"better judgment" or reasoning faculty prompted him to put Josephine
aside, he began to decline. His defeat and St. Helena were not far
distant.

If good taste would permit, we might easily mention scores of men, well
known to the American people, who climbed to great heights of
achievement under the stimulating influence of their wives, only to drop
back to destruction AFTER money and power went to their heads, and they
put aside the old wife for a new one. Napoleon was not the only man to
discover that sex influence, *from the right source*, is more powerful
than any substitute of expediency, which may be created by mere reason.

The human mind responds to stimulation!

Among the greatest, and most powerful of these stimuli is the urge of
sex. When harnessed and transmuted, this driving force is capable of
lifting men into that higher sphere of thought which enables

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

them to master the sources of worry and petty annoyance which beset
their pathway on the lower plane.

Unfortunately, only the genii have made the discovery. Others have
accepted the experience of sex urge, without discovering one of its
major potentialities--a fact which accounts for the great number of
"others" as compared to the limited number of genii.

For the purpose of refreshing the memory, in connection with the facts
available from the biographies of certain men, we here present the names
of a few men of outstanding achievement, each of whom was known to have
been of a highly sexed nature. The genius which was their's, undoubtedly
found its source of power in transmuted sex energy:

Your own knowledge of biography will enable you to add to this list.
Find, if you can, a single man, in all history of civilization, who
achieved outstanding success in any calling, who was not driven by a
well developed sex nature.

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

If you do not wish to rely upon biographies of men not now living, take
inventory of those whom you know to be men of great achievement, and see
if you can find one among them who is not highly sexed.

Sex energy is the creative energy of all genii. *There never has been,
and never will be a great leader, builder, or artist lacking in this
driving force of sex*.

Surely no one will misunderstand these statements to mean that ALL who
are highly sexed are genii! Man attains to the status of a genius ONLY
when, and IF, he stimulates his mind so that it draws upon the forces
available, through the creative faculty of the imagination. Chief among
the stimuli with which this "stepping up" of the vibrations may be
produced is sex energy. The mere *possession* of this energy is not
sufficient to produce a genius. The energy must be *transmuted* from
desire for physical contact, into some *other* form of desire and
action, before it will lift one to the status of a genius.

Far from becoming genii, because of great sex desires, the majority of
men *lower* themselves, through misunderstanding and misuse of this
great force, to the status of the lower animals.

WHY MEN SELDOM SUCCEED BEFORE FORTY

I discovered, from the analysis of over 25,000 people, that men who
succeed in an outstanding way, seldom do so before the age of forty, and
more often they do not strike their real pace until they are well beyond
the age of fifty. This fact was so

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

astounding that it prompted me to go into the study of its cause most
carefully, carrying the investigation over a period of more than twelve
years.

This study disclosed the fact that the major reason why the majority of
men who succeed do not begin to do so before the age of forty to fifty,
is their tendency to DISSIPATE their energies through over indulgence in
physical expression of the emotion of sex. The majority of men *never*
learn that the urge of sex has other possibilities, which far transcend
in importance, that of mere physical expression. The majority of those
who make this discovery, do so *after having wasted many years* at a
period when the sex energy is at its height, prior to the age of
forty-five to fifty. This usually is followed by noteworthy achievement.

The lives of many men up to, and sometimes well past the age of forty,
reflect a continued dissipation of energies, which could have been more
profitably turned into better channels. Their finer and more powerful
emotions are sown wildly to the four winds. Out of this habit of the
male, grew the term, "sowing his wild oats."

The desire for sexual expression is by far the strongest and most
impelling of all the human emotions, and for this very reason this
desire, when *harnessed and transmuted* into action, other than that of
physical expression, may raise one to the status of a genius.

One of America's most able business men frankly admitted that his
attractive secretary was responsible for most of the plans he created.
He admitted that her presence lifted him to heights of creative

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

imagination, such as he could experience under no other stimulus.

One of the most successful men in America owes most of his success to
the influence of a very charming young woman, who has served as his
source of inspiration for more than twelve years. Everyone knows the man
to whom this reference is made, but not everyone knows the REAL SOURCE
of his achievements.

History is not lacking in examples of men who attained to the status of
genii, as the result of the use of artificial mind stimulants in the
form of alcohol and narcotics. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the "Raven" while
under the influence of liquor, "dreaming dreams that mortal never dared
to dream before." James Whitcomb Riley did his best writing while under
the influence of alcohol. Perhaps it was thus he saw "the ordered
intermingling of the real and the dream, the mill above the river, and
the mist above the stream." Robert Burns wrote best when intoxicated,
"For Auld Lang Syne, my dear, we'll take a cup of kindness yet, for Auld
Lang Syne."

But let it be remembered that many such men have destroyed themselves in
the end. Nature has prepared her own potions with which men may safely
stimulate their minds so they vibrate on a plane that enables them to
tune in to fine and rare thoughts which come from--no man knows where!
No satisfactory substitute for Nature's stimulants has ever been found.

It is a fact well known to psychologists that there is a very close
relationship between sex desires and

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

spiritual urges--a fact which accounts for the peculiar behavior of
people who participate in the orgies known as religious "revivals,"
common among the primitive types.

The world is ruled, and the destiny of civilization is established, by
the human emotions. People are influenced in their actions, not by
reason so much as by "feelings." The creative faculty of the mind is set
into action entirely by emotions, and *not by cold reason*. The most
powerful of all human emotions is that of sex. There are other mind
stimulants, some of which have been listed, but no one of them, nor all
of them combined, can equal the driving power of sex.

A mind stimulant is any influence which will either temporarily, or
permanently, increase the vibrations of thought. The ten major
stimulants, described, are those most commonly resorted to. Through
these sources one may commune with Infinite Intelligence, or enter, at
will, the storehouse of the subconscious mind, either one's own, or that
of another person, a procedure *which is all there is of genius*.

A teacher, who has trained and directed the efforts of more than 30,000
sales people, made the astounding discovery that highly sexed men are
the most efficient salesmen. The explanation is, that the factor of
personality known as "personal magnetism" is nothing more nor less than
sex energy. Highly sexed people always have a plentiful supply of
magnetism. Through cultivation and understanding, this vital force may
be drawn upon and used to great advantage in the relationships between

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

people. This energy may be communicated to others through the following
media:

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. | The hand-shake. The touch of the hand indicates, instantly, the presence of magnetism, or the lack of it.                                                                                               |
| 2\. | The tone of voice. Magnetism, or sex energy, is the factor with which the voice may be colored, or made musical and charming.                                                                           |
| 3\. | Posture and carriage of the body. Highly sexed people move briskly, and with grace and ease.                                                                                                            |
| 4\. | The vibrations of thought. Highly sexed people mix the emotion of sex with their thoughts, or may do so at will, and in that way, may influence those around them.                                      |
| 5\. | Body adornment. People who are highly sexed are usually very careful about their personal appearance. They usually select clothing of a style becoming to their personality, physique, complexion, etc. |

When employing salesmen, the more capable sales manager looks for the
quality of personal magnetism as the *first requirement* of a salesman.
People who lack sex energy will never become enthusiastic nor inspire
others with enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is one of the most important
requisites in salesmanship, no matter what one is selling.

The public speaker, orator, preacher, lawyer, or salesman who is lacking
in sex energy is a "flop," as far as being able to influence others is
concerned. Couple with this the fact, that most people can be influenced
only through an appeal to their emotions,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

and you will understand the importance of sex energy as a part of the
salesman's native ability. Master salesmen attain the status of mastery
in selling, because they, either consciously, or unconsciously,
*transmute* the energy of sex into SALES ENTHUSIASM! In this statement
may be found a very practical suggestion as to the actual meaning of sex
transmutation.

The salesman who knows how to take his mind off the subject of sex, and
direct it in sales effort with as much enthusiasm and determination as
he would apply to its original purpose, has acquired the art of sex
transmutation, whether he knows it or not. The majority of salesmen who
transmute their sex energy do so without being in the least aware of
what they are doing, or how they are doing it.

Transmutation of sex energy calls for more will power than the average
person cares to use for this purpose. Those who find it difficult to
summon will-power sufficient for transmutation, may gradually acquire
this ability. Though this requires will-power, the reward for the
practice is more than worth the effort.

The entire subject of sex is one with which the majority of people
appear to be unpardonably ignorant. The urge of sex has been grossly
misunderstood, slandered, and burlesqued by the ignorant and the evil
minded, for so long that the very word sex is seldom used in polite
society. Men and women who are known to be blessed--yes, BLESSED--with
highly sexed natures, are usually looked upon as being people who will
bear watching.

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Instead of being
called blessed, they are usually called cursed.

Millions of people, even in this age of enlightenment, have inferiority
complexes which they developed because of this false belief that a
highly sexed nature is a curse. These statements, of the virtue of sex
energy, should not be construed as justification for the libertine. The
emotion of sex is a virtue ONLY when used intelligently, and with
discrimination. It may be misused, and often is, to such an extent that
it debases, instead of enriches, both body and mind. The better use of
this power is the burden of this chapter.

It seemed quite significant to the author, when he made the discovery
that practically every great leader, whom he had the privilege of
analyzing, was a man whose achievements were largely inspired by a
woman. In many instances, the "woman in the case" was a modest,
self-denying wife, of whom the public had heard but little or nothing.
In a few instances, the source of inspiration has been traced to the
"other woman." Perhaps such cases may not be entirely unknown to you.

Intemperance in sex habits is just as detrimental as intemperance in
habits of drinking and eating. In this age in which we live, an age
which began with the world war, intemperance in habits of sex is common.
This orgy of indulgence may account for the shortage of great leaders.
No man can avail himself of the forces of his creative imagination,
while dissipating them. Man is the only creature on earth which violates
Nature's purpose in this connection. Every other animal indulges its sex

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

nature in moderation, and with purpose which harmonizes with the laws of
nature. Every other animal responds to the call of sex only in "season."
Man's inclination is to declare "open season."

Every intelligent person knows that stimulation in excess, through
alcoholic drink and narcotics, is a form of intemperance which destroys
the vital organs of the body, including the brain. Not every person
knows, however, that over indulgence in sex expression may become a
habit as destructive and as detrimental to creative effort as narcotics
or liquor.

A sex-mad man is not essentially different than a dope-mad man! Both
have lost control over their faculties of reason and will-power. Sexual
overindulgence may not only destroy reason and willpower, but it may
also lead to either temporary, or permanent insanity. Many cases of
hypochondria (imaginary illness) grow out of habits developed in
ignorance of the true function of sex.

From these brief references to the subject, it may be readily seen that
ignorance on the subject of sex transmutation, forces stupendous
penalties upon the ignorant on the one hand, and withholds from them
equally stupendous benefits, on the other.

Widespread ignorance on the subject of sex is due to the fact that the
subject has been surrounded with mystery and beclouded by dark silence.
The conspiracy of mystery and silence has had the same effect upon the
minds of young people that the psychology of prohibition had. The result
has been increased curiosity, and desire to acquire more

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

knowledge on this "verboten" subject; and to the shame of all lawmakers,
and most physicians--by training best qualified to educate youth on that
subject--information has not been easily available.

Seldom does an individual enter upon highly creative effort in any field
of endeavor before the age of forty. The average man reaches the period
of his greatest capacity to create between forty and sixty. These
statements are based upon analysis of thousands of men and women who
have been carefully observed. They should be encouraging to those who
fail to arrive before the age of forty, and to those who become
frightened at the approach of "old age," around the forty-year mark. The
years between forty and fifty are, as a rule, the most fruitful. Man
should approach this age, not with fear and trembling, but with hope and
eager anticipation.

If you want evidence that most men do not begin to do their best work
before the age of forty, study the records of the most successful men
known to the American people, and you will find it. Henry Ford had not
"hit his pace" of achievement until he had passed the age of forty.
Andrew Carnegie was well past forty before he began to reap the reward
of his efforts. James J. Hill was still running a telegraph key at the
age of forty. His stupendous achievements took place after that age.
Biographies of American industrialists and financiers are filled with
evidence that the period from forty to sixty is the most productive age
of man.

Between the ages of thirty and forty, man begins to learn (if he ever
learns), the art of sex transmutation.

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This discovery is
generally accidental, and more often than otherwise, the man who makes
it is totally unconscious of his discovery. He may observe that his
powers of achievement have increased around the age of thirty-five to
forty, but in most cases, he is not familiar with the cause of this
change; that Nature begins to harmonize the emotions of love and sex in
the individual, between the ages of thirty and forty, so that he may
draw upon these great forces, and apply them jointly as stimuli to
action.

Sex, alone, is a mighty urge to action, but its forces are like a
cyclone--they are often uncontrollable. When the emotion of love begins
to mix itself with the emotion of sex, the result is calmness of
purpose, poise, accuracy of judgment, and balance. What person, who has
attained to the age of forty, is so unfortunate as to be unable to
analyze these statements, and to corroborate them by his own experience?

When driven by his desire to please a woman, based solely upon the
emotion of sex, a man may be, and usually is, capable of great
achievement, but his actions may be disorganized, distorted, and totally
destructive. When driven by his desire to please a woman, based upon the
motive of sex alone, a man may steal, cheat, and even commit murder. But
when the emotion of LOVE is mixed with the emotion of sex, that same man
will guide his actions with more sanity, balance, and reason.

Criminologists have discovered that the most hardened criminals can be
reformed through the influence of a woman's love. There is no record of

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

a criminal having been reformed solely through the sex influence. These
facts are well known, but their cause is not. Reformation comes, if at
all, through the *heart*, or the emotional side of man, not through his
head, or reasoning side. Reformation means, "a change of heart." It does
not mean a "change of head." A man may, because of reason, make certain
changes in his personal conduct to avoid the consequences of undesirable
effects, but GENUINE REFORMATION comes only through a change of
heart--through a DESIRE to change.

Love, Romance, and Sex are all emotions capable of driving men to
heights of super achievement. Love is the emotion which serves as a
safety valve, and insures balance, poise, and constructive effort. When
combined, these three emotions may lift one to an altitude of a genius.
There are genii, however, who know but little of the emotion of love.
Most of them may be found engaged in some form of action which is
destructive, or at least, not based upon justice and fairness toward
others. If good taste would permit, a dozen genii could be named in the
field of industry and finance, who ride ruthlessly over the rights of
their fellow men. They seem totally lacking in conscience. The reader
can easily supply his own list of such men.

The emotions are states of mind. Nature has provided man with a
"chemistry of the mind" which operates in a manner similar to the
principles of chemistry of matter. It is a well known fact that, through
the aid of chemistry of matter, a chemist may create a deadly poison by
mixing certain elements, none of which are--in themselves--

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

harmful in the right proportions. The emotions may, likewise, be
combined so as to create a deadly poison. The emotions of sex and
jealousy, when mixed, may turn a person into an insane beast.

The presence of any one or more of the destructive emotions in the human
mind, through the chemistry of the mind, sets up a poison which may
destroy one's sense of justice and fairness. In extreme cases, the
presence of any combination of these emotions in the mind may destroy
one's reason.

The road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex,
love, and romance. Briefly, the process may be stated as follows:

Encourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in
one's mind, and discourage the presence of all the destructive emotions.
The mind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the *dominating*
thoughts fed it. Through the faculty of will-power, one may discourage
the presence of any emotion, and encourage the presence of any other.
Control of the mind, through the power of will, is not difficult.
Control comes from persistence, and habit. The secret of control lies in
understanding the process of transmutation. When any negative emotion
presents itself in one's mind, it can be transmuted into a positive, or
constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one's
thoughts.

THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD TO GENIUS THAN THROUGH VOLUNTARY SELF EFFORT! A
man may attain to great heights of financial or business achievement,
solely by the

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

driving force of sex energy, but history is filled with evidence that he
may, and usually does, carry with him certain traits of character which
rob him of the ability to either hold, or enjoy his fortune. This is
worthy of analysis, thought, and meditation, for it states a truth, the
knowledge of which may be helpful to women as well as men. Ignorance of
this has cost thousands of people their privilege of HAPPINESS, even
though they possessed riches.

The emotions of love and sex leave their unmistakable marks upon the
features. Moreover, these signs are so visible, that all who wish may
read them. The man who is driven by the storm of passion, based upon sex
desires alone, plainly advertises that fact to the entire world, by the
expression of his eyes, and the lines of his face. The emotion of love,
when mixed with the emotion of sex, softens, modifies, and beautifies
the facial expression. No character analyst is needed to tell you
this--you may observe it for yourself.

The emotion of love brings out, and develops, the artistic and the
aesthetic nature of man. It leaves its impress upon one's very soul,
even after the fire has been subdued by time and circumstance.

Memories of love never pass. They linger, guide, and influence long
after the source of stimulation has faded. There is nothing new in this.
Every person, who has been moved by GENUINE LOVE, knows that it leaves
enduring traces upon the human heart. The effect of love endures,
because love is spiritual in nature. The man who cannot be stimulated to
great heights of achievement by love,

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

is hopeless--he is dead, though he may seem to live.

Even the memories of love are sufficient to lift one to a higher plane
of creative effort. The major force of love may spend itself and pass
away, like a fire which has burned itself out, but it leaves behind
indelible marks as evidence that it passed that way. Its departure often
prepares the human heart for a still greater love.

Go back into your yesterdays, at times, and bathe your mind in the
beautiful memories of past love. It will soften the influence of the
present worries and annoyances. It will give you a source of escape from
the unpleasant realities of life, and maybe--who knows?--your mind will
yield to you, during this temporary retreat into the world of fantasy,
ideas, or plans which may change the entire financial or spiritual
status of your life.

If you believe yourself unfortunate, because you have "loved and lost,"
perish the thought. One who has loved truly, can never lose entirely.
Love is whimsical and temperamental. Its nature is ephemeral, and
transitory. It comes when it pleases, and goes away without warning.
Accept and enjoy it while it remains, but spend no time worrying about
its departure. Worry will never bring it back.

Dismiss, also, the thought that love never comes but once. Love may come
and go, times without number, but there are no two love experiences
which affect one in just the same way. There may be, and there usually
is, one love experience which leaves a deeper imprint on the heart than
all the others, but all love experiences are beneficial, except

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

to the person who becomes resentful and cynical when love makes its
departure.

There should be no disappointment over love, and there would be none if
people understood the difference between the emotions of love and sex.
The major difference is that love is spiritual, while sex is biological.
No experience, which touches the human heart with a spiritual force, can
possibly be harmful, except through ignorance, or jealousy.

Love is, without question, life's greatest experience. It brings one
into communion with Infinite Intelligence. When mixed with the emotions
of romance and sex, it may lead one far up the ladder of creative
effort. The emotions of love, sex, and romance, are sides of the eternal
triangle of achievement-building genius. Nature creates genii through no
other force.

Love is an emotion with many sides, shades, and colors. The love which
one feels for parents, or children is quite different from that which
one feels for one's sweetheart. The one is mixed with the emotion of
sex, while the other is not.

The love which one feels in true friendship is not the same as that felt
for one's sweetheart, parents, or children, but it, too, is a form of
love.

Then, there is the emotion of love for things inanimate, such as the
love of Nature's handiwork. But the most intense and burning of all
these various kinds of love, is that experienced in the blending of the
emotions of love and sex. Marriages, not blessed with the eternal
affinity of love, properly balanced and proportioned, with sex, cannot
be happy ones--and seldom endure. Love, alone, will

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

not bring happiness in marriage, nor will sex alone. When these two
beautiful emotions are blended, marriage may bring about a state of
mind, closest to the spiritual that one may ever know on this earthly
plane.

When the emotion of romance is added to those of love and sex, the
obstructions between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence
are removed. Then a genius has been born!

What a different story is this, than those usually associated with the
emotion of sex. Here is an interpretation of the emotion which lifts it
out of the commonplace, and makes of it potter's clay in the hands of
God, from which He fashions all that is beautiful and inspiring. It is
an interpretation which would, when properly understood, bring harmony
out of the chaos which exists in too many marriages. The disharmonies
often expressed in the form of nagging, may usually be traced to lack of
knowledge on the subject of sex. Where love, romance and the proper
understanding of the emotion and function of sex abide, there is no
disharmony between married people.

Fortunate is the husband whose wife understands the true relationship
between the emotions of love, sex, and romance. When motivated by this
holy triumvirate, no form of labor is burdensome, because even the most
lowly form of effort takes on the nature of a labor of love.

It is a very old saying that "a man's wife may either make him or break
him," but the reason is not always understood. The "making" and
"breaking" is the result of the wife's understanding, or

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

lack of understanding of the emotions of love, sex, and romance.

Despite the fact that men are polygamous, by the very nature of their
biological inheritance, it is true that no woman has as great an
influence on a man as his wife, unless he is married to a woman totally
unsuited to his nature. If a woman permits her husband to lose interest
in her, and become more interested in other women, it is usually because
of her ignorance, or indifference toward the subjects of sex, love, and
romance. This statement presupposes, of course, that genuine love once
existed between a man and his wife. The facts are equally applicable to
a man who permits his wife's interest in him to die.

Married people often bicker over a multitude of trivialities. If these
are analyzed accurately, the real cause of the trouble will often be
found to be indifference, or ignorance on these subjects.

*Man's greatest motivating force is his desire to please woman!* The
hunter who excelled during prehistoric days, before the dawn of
civilization, did so, because of his desire to appear great in the eyes
of woman. Man's nature has not changed in this respect. The "hunter" of
today brings home no skins of wild animals, but he indicates his desire
for her favor by supplying fine clothes, motor cars, and wealth. Man has
the same desire to please woman that he had before the dawn of
civilization. The only thing that has changed, is his method of
pleasing. Men who accumulate large fortunes, and attain to great heights
of power and fame, do so, mainly, to satisfy their *desire to please
women.*

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Take women out of
their lives, and great wealth would be useless to most men. *It is this
inherent desire of man to please woman, which gives woman the power to
make or break a man*.

The woman who understands man's nature and tactfully caters to it, need
have no fear of competition from other women. Men may be "giants" with
indomitable will-power when dealing with other men, but they are easily
managed by the women of their choice.

Most men will not admit that they are easily influenced by the women
they prefer, because it is in the nature of the male to want to be
recognized as the stronger of the species. Moreover, the intelligent
woman recognizes this "manly trait" and very wisely makes no issue of
it.

Some men know that they are being influenced by the women of their
choice--their wives, sweethearts, mothers or sisters--but they tactfully
refrain from rebelling against the influence because they are
intelligent enough to know that NO MAN IS HAPPY OR COMPLETE WITHOUT THE
MODIFYING INFLUENCE OF THE RIGHT WOMAN. The man who does not recognize
this important truth deprives himself of the power which has done more
to help men achieve success than all other forces combined.
