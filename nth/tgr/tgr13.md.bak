ACCURATE analysis of over 25,000 men and women who had experienced
failure, disclosed the fact that LACK OF DECISION was near the head of
the list of the 30 major causes of FAILURE. This is no mere statement of
a theory--*it is a fact*.

PROCRASTINATION, the opposite of DECISION, is a common enemy which
practically every man must conquer.

You will have an opportunity to test your capacity to reach *quick* and
*definite* DECISIONS when you finish reading this book, and are ready to
begin putting into ACTION the principles which it describes.

Analysis of several hundred people who had accumulated fortunes well
beyond the million dollar mark, disclosed the fact that every one of
them had the habit of REACHING DECISIONS PROMPTLY, and of changing these
decisions SLOWLY, if, and when they were changed. People who fail to
accumulate money, *without exception*, have the habit of reaching
decisions, IF AT ALL, very *slowly*, and of *changing these decisions
quickly and often*.

One of Henry Ford's most outstanding qualities is his *habit* of
reaching decisions quickly and definitely, and changing them slowly.
This quality

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

is so pronounced in Mr. Ford, that it has given him the reputation of
being obstinate. It was this quality which prompted Mr. Ford to continue
to manufacture his famous Model "T" (the world's ugliest car), when all
of his advisors, and many of the purchasers of the car, were urging him
to change it.

Perhaps, Mr. Ford delayed too long in making the change, but the other
side of the story is, that Mr. Ford's firmness of decision yielded a
huge fortune, before the change in model became *necessary*. There is
but little doubt that Mr. Ford's habit of definiteness of decision
assumes the proportion of obstinacy, but this quality is preferable to
slowness in reaching decisions and quickness in changing them.

The majority of people who fail to accumulate money sufficient for their
needs, are, generally, easily influenced by the "opinions" of others.
They permit the newspapers and the "gossiping" neighbors to do their
"thinking" for them. "Opinions" are the cheapest commodities on earth.
Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will
accept them. If you are influenced by "opinions" when you reach
DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking, much less in that of
transmuting YOUR OWN DESIRE into money.

If you are influenced by the opinions of others, you will have no DESIRE
of your own.

Keep your own counsel, when you begin to put into practice the
principles described here, by *reaching your own decisions* and
following them. Take no one into your confidence, EXCEPT the members

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

of your "Master Mind" group, and be very sure in your selection of this
group, that you choose ONLY those who will be in COMPLETE SYMPATHY AND
HARMONY WITH YOUR PURPOSE.

Close friends and relatives, while not meaning to do so, often handicap
one through "opinions" and sometimes through ridicule, which is meant to
be humorous. Thousands of men and women carry inferiority complexes with
them all through life, because some well-meaning, but ignorant person
destroyed their confidence through "opinions" or ridicule.

You have a brain and mind of your own. USE IT, and reach your own
decisions. If you need facts or information from other people, to enable
you to reach decisions, as you probably will in many instances; acquire
these facts or secure the information you need quietly, without
disclosing your purpose.

It is characteristic of people who have but a smattering or a veneer of
knowledge to try to give the impression that they have much knowledge.
Such people generally do TOO MUCH talking, and TOO LITTLE listening.
Keep your eyes and ears wide open--and your mouth CLOSED, if you wish to
acquire the habit of prompt DECISION. Those who talk too much do little
else. If you talk more than you listen, you not only deprive yourself of
many opportunities to accumulate useful knowledge, but you also disclose
your PLANS and PURPOSES to people who will take great delight in
defeating you, because they envy you.

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

Remember, also, that every time you open your mouth in the presence of a
person who has an abundance of knowledge, you display to that person,
your exact stock of knowledge, or your LACK of it! Genuine wisdom is
usually conspicuous through *modesty and silence*.

Keep in mind the fact that every person with whom you associate is, like
yourself, seeking the opportunity to accumulate money. If you talk about
your plans too freely, you may be surprised when you learn that some
other person has beaten you to your goal by PUTTING INTO ACTION AHEAD OF
YOU, the plans of which you talked unwisely.

Let one of your first decisions be to KEEP A CLOSED MOUTH AND OPEN EARS
AND EYES.

As a reminder to yourself to follow this advice, it will be helpful if
you copy the following epigram in large letters and place it where you
will see it daily.

"TELL THE WORLD WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO, BUT FIRST SHOW IT."

This is the equivalent of saying that "deeds, and not words, are what
count most."

FREEDOM OR DEATH ON A DECISION

The value of decisions depends upon the courage required to render them.
The great decisions, which served as the foundation of civilization,
were reached by assuming great risks, which often meant the possibility
of death.

Lincoln's decision to issue his famous Proclamation

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

of Emancipation, which gave freedom to the colored people of America,
was rendered with full understanding that his act would turn thousands
of friends and political supporters against him. He knew, too, that the
carrying out of that proclamation would mean death to thousands of men
on the battlefield. In the end, it cost Lincoln his life. That required
courage.

Socrates' decision to drink the cup of poison, rather than compromise in
his personal belief, was a decision of courage. It turned Time ahead a
thousand years, and gave to people then unborn, the right to freedom of
thought and of speech.

The decision of Gen. Robert E. Lee, when he came to the parting of the
way with the Union, and took up the cause of the South, was a decision
of courage, for he well knew that it might cost him his own life, that
it would surely cost the lives of others.

But, the greatest decision of all time, as far as any American citizen
is concerned, was reached in Philadelphia, July 4, 1776, when fifty-six
men signed their names to a document, which they well knew would bring
freedom to all Americans, or *leave every one of the fifty-six hanging
from a gallows!*

You have heard of this famous document, but you may not have drawn from
it the great lesson in personal achievement it so plainly taught.

We all remember the date of this momentous decision, but few of us
realize what courage that decision required. We remember our history, as
it was taught; we remember dates, and the names

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

of the men who fought; we remember Valley Forge, and Yorktown; we
remember George Washington, and Lord Cornwallis. But we know little of
the real forces back of these names, dates, and places. We know still
less of that intangible POWER, which insured us freedom *long before
Washington's armies reached Yorktown*.

We read the history of the Revolution, and falsely imagine that George
Washington was the Father of our Country, that it was he who won our
freedom, while the truth is--Washington was only an accessory after the
fact, because victory for his armies had been insured long before Lord
Cornwallis surrendered. This is not intended to rob Washington of any of
the glory he so richly merited. Its purpose, rather, is to give greater
attention to the astounding POWER that was the real cause of his
victory.

It is nothing short of tragedy that the writers of history have missed,
entirely, even the slightest reference to the irresistible POWER, which
gave birth and freedom to the nation destined to set up new standards of
independence for all the peoples of the earth. I say it is a tragedy,
because it is the selfsame POWER which must be used by every individual
who surmounts the difficulties of Life, and forces Life to pay the price
asked.

Let us briefly review the events which gave birth to this POWER. The
story begins with an incident in Boston, March 5, 1770. British soldiers
were patroling the streets, by their presence, openly threatening the
citizens. The colonists resented armed men marching in their midst. They
began

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

to express their resentment openly, hurling stones as well as epithets,
at the marching soldiers, until the commanding officer gave orders, "Fix
bayonets. . . . Charge!"

The battle was on. It resulted in the death and injury of many. The
incident aroused such resentment that the Provincial Assembly, (made up
of prominent colonists), called a meeting for the purpose of taking
definite action. Two of the members of that Assembly were, John Hancock,
and Samuel Adams--LONG LIVE THEIR NAMES! They spoke up courageously, and
declared that a move must be made to eject all British soldiers from
Boston.

Remember this--a DECISION, in the minds of two men, might properly be
called the beginning of the freedom which we, of the United States now
enjoy. Remember, too, that the DECISION of these two men called for
FAITH, and COURAGE, because it was dangerous.

Before the Assembly adjourned, Samuel Adams was appointed to call on the
Governor of the Province, Hutchinson, and demand the withdrawal of the
British troops.

The request was granted, the troops were removed from Boston, but the
incident was not closed. It had caused a situation destined to change
the entire trend of civilization. Strange, is it not, how the great
changes, such as the American Revolution, and the World War, often have
their beginnings in circumstances which seem unimportant? It is
interesting, also, to observe that these important changes usually begin
in the form of a

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> DEFINITE DECISION
in the minds of a relatively small number of people. Few of us know the
history of our country well enough to realize that John Hancock, Samuel
Adams, and Richard Henry Lee (of the Province of Virginia) were the real
Fathers of our Country.

Richard Henry Lee became an important factor in this story by reason of
the fact that he and Samuel Adams communicated frequently (by
correspondence), sharing freely their fears and their hopes concerning
the welfare of the people of their Provinces. From this practice, Adams
conceived the idea that a mutual exchange of letters between the
thirteen Colonies might help to bring about the coordination of effort
so badly needed in connection with the solution of their problems. Two
years after the clash with the soldiers in Boston (March ’72), Adams
presented this idea to the Assembly, in the form of a motion that a
Correspondence Committee be established among the Colonies, with
definitely appointed correspondents in each Colony, "for the purpose of
friendly cooperation for the betterment of the Colonies of British
America."

Mark well this incident! It was the beginning of the organization of the
far-flung POWER destined to give freedom to you, and to me. The Master
Mind had already been organized. It consisted of Adams, Lee, and
Hancock. "I tell you further, that if two of you agree upon the earth
concerning anything for which you ask, it will come to you from My
Father, who is in Heaven."

The Committee of Correspondence was organized. Observe that this move
provided the way for

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

increasing the power of the Master Mind by adding to it men from all the
Colonies. Take notice that this procedure constituted the first
ORGANIZED PLANNING of the disgruntled Colonists.

In union there is strength! The citizens of the Colonies had been waging
disorganized warfare against the British soldiers, through incidents
similar to the Boston riot, but nothing of benefit had been
accomplished. Their individual grievances had not been consolidated
under one Master Mind. No group of individuals had put their hearts,
minds, souls, and bodies together in one definite DECISION to settle
their difficulty with the British once and for all, until Adams,
Hancock, and Lee got together.

Meanwhile, the British were not idle. They, too, were doing some
PLANNING and "Master-Minding" on their own account, with the advantage
of having back of them money, and organized soldiery.

The Crown appointed Gage to supplant Hutchinson as the Governor of
Massachusetts. One of the new Governor's first acts was to send a
messenger to call on Samuel Adams, for the purpose of endeavoring to
stop his opposition--by FEAR.

We can best understand the spirit of what happened by quoting the
conversation between Col. Fenton, (the messenger sent by Gage), and
Adams.

Col. Fenton: "I have been authorized by Governor Gage, to assure you,
Mr. Adams, that the Governor has been empowered to confer upon you such
benefits as would be satisfactory, \[endeavor to win Adams by promise of
bribes\], upon the condition

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

that you engage to cease in your opposition to the measures of the
government. It is the Governor's advice to you, Sir, not to incur the
further displeasure of his majesty. Your conduct has been such as makes
you liable to penalties of an Act of Henry VIII, by which persons can be
sent to England for trial for treason, or misprision of treason, at the
discretion of a governor of a province. But, BY CHANGING YOUR POLITICAL
COURSE, you will not only receive great personal advantages, but you
will make your peace with the King."

Samuel Adams had the choice of two DECISIONS. He could cease his
opposition, and receive personal bribes, or he could CONTINUE, AND RUN
THE RISK OF BEING HANGED!

Clearly, the time had come when Adams was *forced* to reach *instantly*,
a DECISION which could have cost his life. The majority of men would
have found it difficult to reach such a decision. The majority would
have sent back an evasive reply, but not Adams! He insisted upon Col.
Fenton's word of honor, that the Colonel would deliver to the Governor
the answer exactly as Adams would give it to him.

Adams' answer, "Then you may tell Governor Gage that I trust I have long
since made my peace with the King of Kings. No personal consideration
shall induce me to abandon the righteous cause of my Country. And, TELL
GOVERNOR GAGE IT IS THE ADVICE OF SAMUEL ADAMS TO HIM, no longer to
insult the feelings of an exasperated people."

Comment as to the character of this man seem

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

unnecessary. It must be obvious to all who read this astounding message
that its sender possessed loyalty of the highest order. *This is
important*. (Racketeers and dishonest politicians have prostituted the
honor for which such men as Adams died) .

When Governor Gage received Adams' caustic reply, he flew into a rage,
and issued a proclamation which read, "I do, hereby, in his majesty's
name, offer and promise his most gracious pardon to all persons who
shall forthwith lay down their arms, and return to the duties of
peaceable subjects, excepting only from the benefit of such pardon,
SAMUEL ADAMS AND JOHN HANCOCK, whose offences are of too flagitious a
nature to admit of any other consideration but that of condign
punishment."

As one might say, in modern slang, Adams and Hancock were "on the spot!"
The threat of the irate Governor forced the two men to reach another
DECISION, equally as dangerous. They hurriedly called a secret meeting
of their staunchest followers. (Here the Master Mind began to take on
momentum). After the meeting had been called to order, Adams locked the
door, placed the key in his pocket, and informed all present that it was
imperative that a Congress of the Colonists be organized, and that NO
MAN SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM UNTIL THE DECISION FOR SUCH A CONGRESS HAD
BEEN REACHED.

Great excitement followed. Some weighed the possible consequences of
such radicalism. (Old Man Fear). Some expressed grave doubt as to the

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

wisdom of so *definite a decision* in defiance of the Crown. Locked in
that room were TWO MEN immune to Fear, blind to the possibility of
Failure. Hancock and Adams. Through the influence of their minds, the
others were induced to agree that, through the Correspondence Committee,
arrangements should be made for a meeting of the First Continental
Congress, to be held in Philadelphia, September 5, 1774.

Remember this date. It is more important than July 4, 1776. If there had
been no DECISION to hold a Continental Congress, there could have been
no signing of the Declaration of Independence.

Before the first meeting of the new Congress, another leader, in a
different section of the country was deep in the throes of publishing a
"Summary View of the Rights of British America." He was Thomas
Jefferson, of the Province of Virginia, whose relationship to Lord
Dunmore, (representative of the Crown in Virginia), was as strained as
that of Hancock and Adams with their Governor.

Shortly after his famous Summary of Rights was published, Jefferson was
informed that he was subject to prosecution for high treason against his
majesty's government. Inspired by the threat, one of Jefferson's
colleagues, Patrick Henry, boldly spoke his mind, concluding his remarks
with a sentence which shall remain forever a classic, "*If this be
treason, then make the most of it*."

It was such men as these who, without power, without authority, without
military strength, without money, sat in solemn consideration of the
destiny of the colonies, beginning at the opening of

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

the First Continental Congress, and continuing at intervals for two
years--until on June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee arose, addressed the
Chair, and to the startled Assembly made this motion:

"Gentlemen, I make the motion that these United Colonies are, and of
right ought to be free and independent states, that they be absolved
from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political
connection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to
be totally dissolved."

Lee's astounding motion was discussed fervently, and at such length that
he began to lose patience. Finally, after days of argument, he again
took the floor, and declared, in a clear, firm voice, "Mr. President, we
have discussed this issue for days. It is the only course for us to
follow. Why, then Sir, do we longer delay? Why still deliberate? Let
this happy day give birth to an American Republic. Let her arise, not to
devastate and to conquer, but to reestablish the reign of peace, and of
law. The eyes of Europe are fixed upon us. She demands of us a living
example of freedom, that may exhibit a contrast, in the felicity of the
citizen, to the ever increasing tyranny."

Before his motion was finally voted upon, Lee was called back to
Virginia, because of serious family illness, but before leaving, he
placed his cause in the hands of his friend, Thomas Jefferson, who
promised to fight until favorable action was taken. Shortly thereafter
the President of the Congress (Hancock), appointed Jefferson as Chairman
of a Committee to draw up a Declaration of Independence.

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

Long and hard the Committee labored, on a document which would mean,
when accepted by the Congress, that EVERY MAN WHO SIGNED IT, WOULD BE
SIGNING HIS OWN DEATH WARRANT, should the Colonies lose in the fight
with Great Britain, which was sure to follow.

The document was drawn, and on June 28, the original draft was read
before the Congress. For several days it was discussed, altered, and
made ready. On July 4, 1776, Thomas Jefferson stood before the Assembly,
and fearlessly read the most [momentous](errata.htm#0.md) DECISION ever
placed upon paper.

"When in the course of human events it is necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and
to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station
to which the laws of Nature, and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the
causes which impel them to the separation. . . ."

When Jefferson finished, the document was voted upon, accepted, and
signed by the fifty-six men, every one staking his own life upon his
DECISION to write his name. By that DECISION came into existence a
nation destined to bring to mankind forever, the privilege of making
DECISIONS.

By decisions made in a similar spirit of Faith, and only by such
decisions, can men solve their personal problems, and win for themselves
high estates of material and spiritual wealth. Let us not forget this!

Analyze the events which led to the Declaration

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

of Independence, and be convinced that this nation, which now holds a
position of commanding respect and power among all nations of the world,
was born of a DECISION created by a Master Mind, consisting of fifty-six
men. Note well, the fact that it was their DECISION which insured the
success of Washington's armies, because the *spirit* of that decision
was in the heart of every soldier who fought with him, and served as a
spiritual power which recognizes no such thing as FAILURE.

Note, also, (with great personal benefit), that the POWER which gave
this nation its freedom, is the self-same power that must be used by
every individual who becomes self-determining. This POWER is made up of
the principles described in this book. It will not be difficult to
detect, in the story of the Declaration of Independence, at least six of
these principles; DESIRE, DECISION, FAITH, PERSISTENCE, THE MASTER MIND,
and ORGANIZED PLANNING.

Throughout this philosophy will be found the suggestion that thought,
backed by strong DESIRE, has a tendency to transmute itself into its
physical equivalent. Before passing on, I wish to leave with you the
suggestion that one may find in this story, and in the story of the
organization of the United States Steel Corporation, a perfect
description of the method by which thought makes this astounding
transformation.

In your search for the secret of the method, do not look for a miracle,
because you will not find it. You will find only the eternal laws of
Nature. These laws are available to every person who has

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

the FAITH and the COURAGE to use them. They may be used to bring freedom
to a nation, or to accumulate riches. There is no charge save the time
necessary to understand and appropriate them.

Those who reach DECISIONS promptly and definitely, know what they want,
and generally get it. The leaders in every walk of life DECIDE quickly,
and firmly. That is the major reason why they are leaders. The world has
the habit of making room for the man whose words and actions show that
he knows where he is going.

INDECISION is a habit which usually begins in youth. The habit takes on
permanency as the youth goes through graded school, high school, and
even through college, without DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. The major
weakness of all educational systems is that they neither teach nor
encourage the habit of DEFINITE DECISION.

It would be beneficial if no college would permit the enrollment of any
student, unless and until the student declared his major purpose in
matriculating. It would be of still greater benefit, if every student
who enters the graded schools were compelled to accept training in the
HABIT OF DECISION, and forced to pass a satisfactory examination on this
subject before being permitted to advance in the grades.

The habit of INDECISION acquired because of the deficiencies of our
school systems, goes with the student into the occupation he chooses . .
. IF . . . in fact, he chooses his occupation. Generally, the youth just
out of school seeks any job that can be found. He takes the first place
he finds, because he

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

has fallen into the habit of INDECISION. Ninety-eight out of every
hundred people working for wages today, are in the positions they hold,
because they lacked the DEFINITENESS OF DECISION to PLAN A DEFINITE
POSITION, and the knowledge of how to choose an employer.

DEFINITENESS OF DECISION always requires courage, sometimes very great
courage. The fifty-six men who signed the Declaration of Independence
staked their lives on the DECISION to affix their signatures to that
document. The person who reaches a DEFINITE DECISION to procure the
particular job, and make life pay the price he asks, does not stake his
life on that decision; he stakes his ECONOMIC FREEDOM. Financial
independence, riches, desirable business and professional positions are
not within reach of the person who neglects or refuses to EXPECT, PLAN,
and DEMAND these things. The person who desires riches in the same
spirit that Samuel Adams desired freedom for the Colonies, is sure to
accumulate wealth.

In the chapter on Organized Planning, you will find complete
instructions for marketing every type of personal services. You will
find also detailed information on how to choose the employer you prefer,
and the particular job you desire. These instructions will be of no
value to you UNLESS YOU DEFINITELY DECIDE to organize them into a plan
of action.
