AUTO-SUGGESTION is a term which applies to all suggestions and all
self-administered stimuli which reach one's mind through the five
senses. Stated in another way, auto-suggestion is self-suggestion. It is
the agency of communication between that part of the mind where
conscious thought takes place, and that which serves as the seat of
action for the subconscious mind.

Through the dominating thoughts which one *permits* to remain in the
conscious mind, (whether these thoughts be negative or positive, is
immaterial), the principle of auto-suggestion voluntarily reaches the
subconscious mind and influences it with these thoughts.

NO THOUGHT, whether it be negative or positive, CAN ENTER THE
SUBCONSCIOUS MIND WITHOUT THE AID OF THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTO-SUGGESTION,
with the exception of thoughts picked up from the ether. Stated
differently, all sense impressions which are perceived through the five
senses, are stopped by the CONSCIOUS thinking mind, and may be either
passed on to the subconscious mind, or rejected, at will. The conscious
faculty serves, therefore, as an outer-guard to the approach of the
subconscious.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

Nature has so built man that he has ABSOLUTE CONTROL over the material
which reaches his subconscious mind, through his five senses, although
this is not meant to be construed as a statement that man always
EXERCISES this control. In the great majority of instances, he does NOT
exercise it, which explains why so many people go through life in
poverty.

Recall what has been said about the subconscious mind resembling a
fertile garden spot, in which weeds will grow in abundance, if the seeds
of more desirable crops are not sown therein. AUTOSUGGESTION is the
agency of control through which an individual may voluntarily feed his
subconscious mind on thoughts of a creative nature, or, by neglect,
permit thoughts of a destructive nature to find their way into this rich
garden of the mind.

You were instructed, in the last of the six steps described in the
chapter on Desire, to read ALOUD twice daily the WRITTEN statement of
your DESIRE FOR MONEY, and to SEE AND FEEL yourself ALREADY in
possession of the money! By following these instructions, you
communicate the object of your DESIRE directly to your SUBCONSCIOUS mind
in a spirit of absolute FAITH. Through repetition of this procedure, you
voluntarily create thought habits which are favorable to your efforts to
transmute desire into its monetary equivalent.

Go back to these six steps described in chapter two, and read them
again, very carefully, before you proceed further. Then (when you come
to it), read very carefully the four instructions for the organization

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

of your "Master Mind" group, described in the chapter on Organized
Planning. By comparing these two sets of instructions with that which
has been stated on auto-suggestion, you, of course, will see that the
instructions involve the application of the principle of
auto-suggestion.

Remember, therefore, when reading aloud the statement of your desire
(through which you are endeavoring to develop a "money consciousness"),
that the mere reading of the words is of NO CONSEQUENCE--UNLESS you mix
emotion, or feeling with your words. If you repeat a million times the
famous Emil Coué formula, "Day by day, in every way, I am getting better
and better," without mixing emotion and FAITH with your words, you will
experience no desirable results. Your subconscious mind recognizes and
acts upon ONLY thoughts which have been well-mixed with emotion or
feeling.

This is a fact of such importance as to warrant repetition in
practically every chapter, because the lack of understanding of this is
the main reason the majority of people who try to apply the principle of
auto-suggestion get no desirable results.

Plain, unemotional words do not influence the subconscious mind. You
will get no appreciable results until you learn to reach your
subconscious mind with thoughts, or spoken words which have been well
emotionalized with BELIEF.

Do not become discouraged, if you cannot control and direct your
emotions the first time you try to do so. Remember, there is no such
possibility as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. Ability to reach,

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

and influence your subconscious mind has its price, and you MUST PAY
THAT PRICE. You cannot cheat, even if you desire to do so. The price of
ability to influence your subconscious mind is everlasting PERSISTENCE
in applying the principles described here. You cannot develop the
desired ability for a lower price. You, and YOU ALONE, must decide
whether or not the reward for which you are striving (the "money
consciousness"), is worth the price you must pay for it in effort.

Wisdom and "cleverness" alone, will not attract and retain money except
in a few very rare instances, where the law of averages favors the
attraction of money through these sources. The method of attracting
money described here, does not depend upon the law of averages.
Moreover, the method plays no favorites. It will work for one person as
effectively as it will for another. Where failure is experienced, it is
the individual, *not the method*, which has failed. If you try and fail,
make another effort, and still another, until you succeed.

Your ability to use the principle of auto-suggestion will depend, very
largely, upon your capacity to CONCENTRATE upon a given DESIRE until
that desire becomes a BURNING OBSESSION.

When you begin to carry out the instructions in connection with the six
steps described in the second chapter, it will be necessary for you to
make use of the principle of CONCENTRATION.

Let us here offer suggestions for the effective use of concentration.
When you begin to carry out the first of the six steps, which instructs
you to "fix in

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

your own mind the EXACT amount of money you desire," hold your thoughts
on that amount of money by CONCENTRATION, or fixation of attention, with
your eyes closed, until you can ACTUALLY SEE the physical appearance of
the money. Do this at least once each day. As you go through these
exercises, follow the instructions given in the chapter on FAITH, and
see yourself actually IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY!

Here is a most significant fact--the subconscious mind takes any orders
given it in a spirit of absolute FAITH, and acts upon those orders,
although the orders often have to be presented over and over again,
through repetition, before they are interpreted by the subconscious
mind. Following the preceding statement, consider the possibility of
playing a perfectly legitimate "trick" on your subconscious mind, by
making it believe, *because you believe it*, that you must have the
amount of money you are visualizing, that this money is already awaiting
your claim, that the subconscious mind MUST hand over to you practical
plans for acquiring the money which is yours.

Hand over the thought suggested in the preceding paragraph to your
IMAGINATION, and see what your imagination can, or will do, to create
practical plans for the accumulation of money through transmutation of
your desire.

DO NOT WAIT for a definite plan, through which you intend to exchange
services or merchandise in return for the money you are visualizing, but
begin at once to see yourself in possession of the money, DEMANDING and
EXPECTING meanwhile,

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan, or plans you need.
Be on the alert for these plans, and when they appear, put them into
ACTION IMMEDIATELY. When the plans appear, they will probably "flash"
into your mind through the sixth sense, in the form of an "inspiration."
This inspiration may be considered a direct "telegram," or message from
Infinite Intelligence. Treat it with respect, and act upon it as soon as
you receive it. Failure to do this will be FATAL to your success.

In the fourth of the six steps, you were instructed to "Create a
definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once to put
this plan into action." You should follow this instruction in the manner
described in the preceding paragraph. Do not trust to your "reason" when
creating your plan for accumulating money through the transmutation of
desire. Your reason is faulty. Moreover, your reasoning faculty may be
lazy, and, if you depend entirely upon it to serve you, it may
disappoint you.

When visualizing the money you intend to accumulate, (with closed eyes),
*see yourself rendering the service, or delivering the merchandise you
intend to give in return for this money. This is important!*

SUMMARY OF INSTRUCTIONS

The fact that you are reading this book is an indication that you
earnestly seek knowledge. It is also an indication that you are a
student of this subject. If you are only a student, there is a chance
that you may learn much that you did not know, but you will learn only
by assuming an attitude of humility.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> If you choose to
follow some of the instructions but neglect, or refuse to follow
others--*you will fail!* To get satisfactory results, you must follow
ALL instructions in a spirit of FAITH.

The instructions given in connection with the six steps in the second
chapter will now be summarized, and blended with the principles covered
by this chapter, as follows:

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top"><p>First.</p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>Go into some quiet spot (preferably in bed at night) where you will not be disturbed or interrupted, close your eyes, and repeat aloud, (so you may hear your own words) the written statement of the amount of money you intend to accumulate, the time limit for its accumulation, and a description of the service or merchandise you intend to give in return for the money. As you carry out these instructions, SEE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.</p>
<p>For example:--Suppose that you intend to accumulate $50,000 by the first of January, five years hence, that you intend to give personal services in return for the money, in the capacity of a salesman. Your written statement of your purpose should be similar to the following:</p>
<p>"By the first day of January, 19.., I will have in my possession $50,000, which will come to me in various amounts from time to time during the interim.</p>
<p>"In return for this money I will give the most efficient service of which I am capable, rendering</p>
<p><span id="page_102">p. 102</span></p>
<p>the fullest possible quantity, and the best possible quality of service in the capacity of salesman of . . . . . . . . . . . (describe the service or merchandise you intend to sell).</p>
<p>"I believe that I will have this money in my possession. My faith is so strong that I can now see this money before my eyes. I can touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the time, and in the proportion that I deliver the service I intend to render in return for it. I am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate this money, and I will follow that plan, when it is received."</p></td>

<td data-valign="top"><p>Third.</p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>Place a written copy of your statement where you can see it night and morning, and read it just before retiring, and upon arising until it has been memorized.</p></td>

Remember, as you carry out these instructions, that you are applying the
principle of auto-suggestion, for the purpose of giving orders to your
subconscious mind. Remember, also, that your subconscious mind will act
ONLY upon instructions which are emotionalized, and handed over to it
with "feeling." FAITH is the strongest, and most productive of the
emotions. Follow the instructions given in the chapter on FAITH.

These instructions may, at first, seem abstract.

Do not let this disturb you. Follow the instructions,

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

no matter how abstract or impractical they may, at first, appear to be.
The time will soon come, if you do as you have been instructed, *in
spirit as well as in act*, when a whole new universe of power will
unfold to you.

Scepticism, in connection with ALL new ideas, is characteristic of all
human beings. But if you follow the instructions outlined, your
scepticism will soon be replaced by belief, and this, in turn, will soon
become crystallized into ABSOLUTE FAITH. Then you will have arrived at
the point where you may truly say, "I am the master of my fate, I am the
captain of my soul!"

Many philosophers have made the statement, that man is the master of his
own *earthly* destiny, but most of them have failed to say *why* he is
the master. The reason that man may be the master of his own earthly
status, and especially his financial status, is thoroughly explained in
this chapter. Man may become the master of himself, and of his
environment, because he has the POWER TO INFLUENCE HIS OWN SUBCONSCIOUS
MIND, and through it, gain the cooperation of Infinite Intelligence.

You are now reading the chapter which represents the keystone to the
arch of this philosophy. The instructions contained in this chapter must
be understood and APPLIED WITH PERSISTENCE, if you succeed in
transmuting desire into money.

The actual performance of transmuting DESIRE into money, involves the
use of auto-suggestion as an agency by which one may reach, and
influence, the subconscious mind. The other principles are

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

simply tools with which to apply auto-suggestion. Keep this thought in
mind, and you will, at all times, be conscious of the important part the
principle of auto-suggestion is to play in your efforts to accumulate
money through the methods described in this book.

Carry out these instructions as though you were a small child. Inject
into your efforts something of the FAITH of a child. The author has been
most careful, to see that no impractical instructions were included,
because of his sincere desire to be helpful.

After you have read the entire book, come back to this chapter, and
follow in spirit, and in action, this instruction:

READ THE ENTIRE CHAPTER ALOUD ONCE EVERY NIGHT, UNTIL YOU BECOME
THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTO-SUGGESTION IS SOUND,
THAT IT WILL ACCOMPLISH FOR YOU ALL THAT HAS BEEN CLAIMED FOR IT. AS YOU
READ, *UNDERSCORE WITH A PENCIL* EVERY SENTENCE WHICH IMPRESSES YOU
FAVORABLY.

Follow the foregoing instruction to the letter, and it will open the way
for a complete understanding, and mastery of the principles of success.
