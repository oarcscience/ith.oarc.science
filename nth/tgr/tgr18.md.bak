MORE than twenty years ago, the author, working in conjunction with the
late Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, and Dr. Elmer R. Gates, observed that
every human brain is both a broadcasting and receiving station for the
vibration of thought.

Through the medium of the ether, in a fashion similar to that employed
by the radio broadcasting principle, every human brain is capable of
picking up vibrations of thought which are being released by other
brains.

In connection with the statement in the preceding paragraph, compare,
and consider the description of the Creative Imagination, as outlined in
the chapter on Imagination. The Creative Imagination is the "receiving
set" of the brain, which receives thoughts, released by the brains of
others. It is the agency of communication between one's conscious, or
reasoning mind, and the four sources from which one may receive thought
stimuli.

When stimulated, or "stepped up" to a high rate of vibration, the mind
becomes more receptive to the vibration of thought which reaches it
through the ether from outside sources. This "stepping up" process takes
place through the positive emotions, or the negative emotions. Through
the emotions, the vibrations of thought may be increased.

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

Vibrations of an exceedingly high rate are the only vibrations picked up
and carried, by the ether, from one brain to another. Thought is energy
travelling at an exceedingly high rate of vibration. Thought, which has
been modified or "stepped up" by any of the major emotions, vibrates at
a much higher rate than ordinary thought, and it is this type of thought
which passes from one brain to another, through the broadcasting
machinery of the human brain.

The emotion of sex stands at the head of the list of human emotions, as
far as intensity and driving force are concerned. The brain which has
been stimulated by the emotion of sex, vibrates at a much more rapid
rate than it does when that emotion is quiescent or absent.

The result of sex transmutation, is the increase of the rate of
vibration of thoughts to such a pitch that the Creative Imagination
becomes highly receptive to ideas, which it picks up from the ether. On
the other hand, when the brain is vibrating at a rapid rate, it not only
attracts thoughts and ideas released by other brains through the medium
of the ether, but it gives to one's own thoughts that "feeling" which is
essential before those thoughts will be picked up and acted upon by
one's subconscious mind.

Thus, you will see that the broadcasting principle is the factor through
which you mix feeling, or emotion with your thoughts and pass them on to
your subconscious mind.

The subconscious mind is the "sending station" of the brain, through
which vibrations of thought are

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

broadcast. The Creative Imagination is the "receiving set," through
which the vibrations of thought are picked up from the ether.

Along with the important factors of the subconscious mind, and the
faculty of the Creative Imagination, which constitute the sending and
receiving sets of your mental broadcasting machinery, consider now the
principle of auto-suggestion, which is the medium by which you may put
into operation your "broadcasting" station.

Through the instructions described in the chapter on auto-suggestion,
you were definitely informed of the method by which DESIRE may be
transmuted into its monetary equivalent.

Operation of your mental "broadcasting" station is a comparatively
simple procedure. You have but three principles to bear in mind, and to
apply, when you wish to use your broadcasting station--the SUBCONSCIOUS
MIND, CREATIVE IMAGINATION, and AUTO-SUGGESTION. The stimuli through
which you put these three principles into action have been
described--the procedure begins with DESIRE.

THE GREATEST FORCES ARE "INTANGIBLE"

The depression brought the world to the very border-line of
understanding of the forces which are intangible and unseen. Through the
ages which have passed, man has depended too much upon his physical
senses, and has limited his knowledge to physical things, which he could
see, touch, weigh, and measure.

We are now entering the most marvelous of all

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

ages--an age which will teach us something of the intangible forces of
the world about us. Perhaps we shall learn, as we pass through this age,
that the 'other self" is more powerful than the physical self we see
when we look into a mirror.

Sometimes men speak lightly of the intangibles--the things which they
cannot perceive through any of their five senses, and when we hear them,
it should remind us that *all of us are controlled by forces which are
unseen and intangible*.

The whole of mankind has not the power to cope with, nor to control the
intangible force wrapped up in the rolling waves of the oceans. Man has
not the capacity to understand the intangible force of gravity, which
keeps this little earth suspended in mid-air, and keeps man from falling
from it, much less the power to control that force. Man is entirely
subservient to the intangible force which comes with a thunder storm,
and he is just as helpless in the presence of the intangible force of
electricity--nay, he does not even know what electricity is, where it
comes from, or what is its purpose!

Nor is this by any means the end of man's ignorance in connection with
things unseen and intangible. He does not understand the intangible
force (and intelligence) wrapped up in the soil of the earth--*the force
which provides him with every morsel of food he eats, every article of
clothing he wears, every dollar he carries in his pockets*.

THE DRAMATIC STORY OF THE BRAIN

Last, but not least, man, with all of his boasted culture and education,
understands little or nothing

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

of the intangible force (the greatest of all the intangibles) of
*thought*. He knows but little concerning the physical brain, and its
vast network of intricate machinery through which the power of thought
is translated into its material equivalent, but he is now entering an
age which shall yield enlightenment on the subject. Already men of
science have begun to turn their attention to the study of this
stupendous thing called a brain, and, while they are still in the
kindergarten stage of their studies, they have uncovered enough
knowledge to know that the central switchboard of the human brain, the
number of lines which connect the brain cells one with another, equal
the figure one, followed by fifteen million ciphers.

"The figure is so stupendous," said Dr. C. Judson Herrick, of the
University of Chicago, "that astronomical figures dealing with hundreds
of millions of light years, become insignificant by comparison. . . . It
has been determined that there are from 10,000,000,000 to 14,000,000,000
nerve cells in the human cerebral cortex, and we know that these are
arranged in definite patterns. These arrangements are not haphazard.
They are orderly. Recently developed methods of electro-physiology draw
off action currents from very precisely located cells, or fibers with
micro-electrodes, amplify them with radio tubes, and record potential
differences to a millionth of a volt."

It is inconceivable that such a network of intricate machinery should be
in existence for the sole purpose of carrying on the physical functions
incidental to growth and maintenance of the physical

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

body. Is it not likely that the same system, which gives billions of
brain cells the media for communication one with another, provides, also
the means of communication with other intangible forces?

After this book had been written, just before the manuscript went to the
publisher, there appeared in the New York Times, an editorial showing
that at least one great University, and one intelligent investigator in
the field of mental phenomena, are carrying on an organized research
through which conclusions have been reached that parallel many of those
described in this and the following chapter. The editorial briefly
analyzed the work carried on by Dr. Rhine, and his associates at Duke
University, viz:--

"What is 'Telepathy'?

"A month ago we cited on this page some of the remarkable results
achieved by Professor Rhine and his associates in Duke University from
more than a hundred thousand tests to determine the existence of
'telepathy' and 'clairvoyance.' These results were summarized in the
first two articles in Harpers Magazine. In the second which has now
appeared, the author, E. H. Wright, attempts to summarize what has been
learned, or what it seems reasonable to infer, regarding the exact
nature of these 'extrasensory' modes of perception.

"The actual existence of telepathy and clairvoyance now seems to some
scientists enormously probable as the result of Rhine's experiments.
Various percipients were asked to name as many cards in a special pack
as they could without looking

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

at them and without other sensory access to them. About a score of men
and women were discovered who could regularly name so many of the cards
correctly that 'there was not one chance in many a million million of
their having done their feats by luck or accident.'

"But how did they do them? These powers, assuming that they exist, do
not seem to be sensory. There is no known organ for them. The
experiments worked just as well at distances of several hundred miles as
they did in the same room. These facts also dispose, in Mr. Wright's
opinion, of the attempt to explain telepathy or clairvoyance through any
physical theory of radiation. All known forms of radiant energy decline
inversely as the square of the distance traversed. Telepathy and
clairvoyance do not. But they do vary through physical causes as our
other mental powers do. Contrary to widespread opinion, they do not
improve when the percipient is asleep or half-asleep, but, on the
contrary, when he is most wide-awake and alert. Rhine discovered that a
narcotic will invariably lower a percipient's score, while a stimulant
will always send it higher. The most reliable performer apparently
cannot make a good score unless he tries to do his best.

"One conclusion that Wright draws with some confidence is that telepathy
and clairvoyance are really one and the same gift. That is, the faculty
that 'sees' a card face down on a table seems to be exactly the same one
that 'reads' a thought residing only in another mind. There are several
grounds for believing this. So far, for example, the two

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

gifts have been found in every person who enjoys either of them. In
every one so far the two have been of equal vigor, almost exactly.
Screens, walls, distances, have no effect at all on either. Wright
advances from this conclusion to express what he puts forward as no more
than the mere 'hunch' that other extra-sensory experiences, prophetic
dreams, premonitions of disaster, and the like, may also prove to be
part of the same faculty. The reader is not asked to accept any of these
conclusions unless he finds it necessary, but the evidence that Rhine
has piled up must remain impressive."

In view of Dr. Rhine's announcement in connection with the conditions
under which the mind responds to what he terms "extra-sensory" modes of
perception, I now feel privileged to add to his testimony by stating
that my associates and I have discovered what we believe to be the ideal
conditions under which the mind can be stimulated so that the sixth
sense described in the next chapter, can be made to function in a
practical way.

The conditions to which I refer consist of a close working alliance
between myself and two members of my staff. Through experimentation and
practice, we have discovered how to stimulate our minds (by applying the
principle used in connection with the "Invisible Counselors" described
in the next chapter) so that we can, by a process of blending our three
minds into one, find the solution to a great variety of personal
problems which are submitted by my clients.

The procedure is very simple. We sit down at a conference table, clearly
state the nature of the

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

problem we have under consideration, then begin discussing it. Each
contributes whatever thoughts that may occur. The strange thing about
this method of mind stimulation is that it places each participant in
communication with unknown sources of knowledge definitely outside his
own experience.

If you understand the principle described in the chapter on the Master
Mind, you of course recognize the round-table procedure here described
as being a practical application of the Master Mind.

This method of mind stimulation, through harmonious discussion of
definite subjects, between three people, illustrates the simplest and
most practical use of the Master Mind.

*By adopting and following a similar plan any student of this philosophy
may come into possession of the famous Carnegie formula briefly
described in the introduction*. If it means nothing to you at this time,
mark this page and read it again after you have finished the last
chapter.
