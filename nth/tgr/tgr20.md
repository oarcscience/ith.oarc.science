BEFORE you can put any portion of this philosophy into successful use,
your mind must be prepared to receive it. The preparation is not
difficult. It begins with study, analysis, and understanding of three
enemies which you shall have to clear out. These are INDECISION, DOUBT,
and FEAR!

The Sixth Sense will never function while these three negatives, or any
of them remain in your mind. The members of this unholy trio are closely
related; where one is found, the other two are close at hand.

INDECISION is the seedling of FEAR! Remember this, as you read.
Indecision crystalizes into DOUBT, the two blend and become FEAR! The
"blending" process often is slow. This is one reason why these three
enemies are so dangerous. They germinate and grow *without their
presence being observed*.

The remainder of this chapter describes an end which must be attained
before the philosophy, as a whole, can be put into practical use. It
also analyzes a condition which has, but lately, reduced huge numbers of
people to poverty, and it states a

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

truth which must be understood by all who accumulate riches, whether
measured in terms of money or a state of mind of far greater value than
money.

The purpose of this chapter is to turn the spotlight of attention upon
the cause and the cure of the six basic fears. Before we can master an
enemy, we must know its name, its habits, and its place of abode. As you
read, analyze yourself carefully, and determine which, if any, of the
six common fears have attached themselves to you.

Do not be deceived by the habits of these subtle enemies. Sometimes they
remain hidden in the subconscious mind, where they are difficult to
locate, and still more difficult to eliminate.

THE SIX BASIC FEARS

There are six basic fears, with some combination of which every human
suffers at one time or another. Most people are fortunate if they do not
suffer from the entire six. Named in the order of their most common
appearance, they are:--

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

All other fears are of minor importance, they can be grouped under these
six headings.

The prevalence of these fears, as a curse to the world, runs in cycles.
For almost six years, while the depression was on, we floundered in the
cycle

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

of FEAR OF POVERTY. During the world-war, we were in the cycle of FEAR
OF DEATH. Just following the war, we were in the cycle of FEAR OF ILL
HEALTH, as evidenced by the epidemic of disease which spread itself all
over the world.

*Fears are nothing more than states of mind*. One's state of mind is
subject to control and direction. Physicians, as everyone knows, are
less subject to attack by disease than ordinary laymen, for the reason
that physicians DO NOT FEAR DISEASE. Physicians, without fear or
hesitation, have been known to physically contact hundreds of people,
daily, who were suffering from such contagious diseases as small-pox,
without becoming infected. Their immunity against the disease consisted,
largely, if not solely, in their absolute lack of FEAR.

Man can create nothing which he does not first conceive in the form of
an impulse of thought. Following this statement, comes another of still
greater importance, namely, MAN'S THOUGHT IMPULSES BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO
TRANSLATE THEMSELVES INTO THEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT, WHETHER THOSE
THOUGHTS ARE VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY. Thought impulses which are picked
up through the ether, by mere chance (thoughts which have been released
by other minds) may determine one's financial, business, professional,
or social destiny just as surely as do the thought impulses which one
creates by intent and design.

We are here laying the foundation for the presentation of a fact of
great importance to the person

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

who does not understand why some people appear to be "lucky" while
others of equal or greater ability, training, experience, and brain
capacity, seem destined to ride with misfortune. This fact may be
explained by the statement that *every human being has the ability to
completely control his own mind*, and with this control, obviously,
every person may open his mind to the tramp thought impulses which are
being released by other brains, or close the doors tightly and admit
only thought impulses of his own choice.

Nature has endowed man with absolute control over but one thing, and
that is THOUGHT. This fact, coupled with the additional fact that
everything which man creates, begins in the form of a thought, leads one
very near to the principle by which FEAR may be mastered.

If it is true that ALL THOUGHT HAS A TENDENCY TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN ITS
PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT (and this is true, beyond any reasonable room for
doubt), it is equally true that thought impulses of fear and poverty
cannot be translated into terms of courage and financial gain.

The people of America began to think of poverty, following the Wall
Street crash of 1929. Slowly, but surely that mass thought was
crystalized into its physical equivalent, which was known as a
"depression." This had to happen, it is in conformity with the laws of
Nature.

THE FEAR OF POVERTY

There can be no compromise between POVERTY

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

and RICHES! The two roads that lead to poverty and riches travel in
opposite directions. If you want riches, you must refuse to accept any
circumstance that leads toward poverty. (The word "riches" is here used
in its broadest sense, meaning financial, spiritual, mental and material
estates). The starting point of the path that leads to riches is DESIRE.
In chapter one, you received full instructions for the proper use of
DESIRE. In this chapter, on FEAR, you have complete instructions for
preparing your mind to make practical use of DESIRE.

Here, then, is the place to give yourself a challenge which will
definitely determine how much of this philosophy you have absorbed. Here
is the point at which you can turn prophet and foretell, accurately,
what the future holds in store for you. If, after reading this chapter,
you are willing to accept poverty, you may as well make up your mind to
receive poverty. This is one decision you cannot avoid.

If you demand riches, determine what form, and how much will be required
to satisfy you. You know the road that leads to riches. You have been
given a road map which, if followed, will keep you on that road. If you
neglect to make the start, or stop before you arrive, no one will be to
blame, but YOU. This responsibility is yours. No alibi will save you
from accepting the responsibility if you now fail or refuse to demand
riches of Life, because the acceptance calls for but one
thing--incidentally, the only thing you can control--and that is a STATE
OF MIND. A state of mind is something

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

that one assumes. It cannot be purchased, it must be created.

Fear of poverty is a state of mind, nothing else! But it is sufficient
to destroy one's chances of achievement in any undertaking, a truth
which became painfully evident during the depression.

This fear paralyzes the faculty of reason, destroys the faculty of
imagination, kills off self-reliance, undermines enthusiasm, discourages
initiative, leads to uncertainty of purpose, encourages procrastination,
wipes out enthusiasm and makes self-control an impossibility. It takes
the charm from one's personality, destroys the possibility of accurate
thinking, diverts concentration of effort, it masters persistence, turns
the will-power into nothingness, destroys ambition, beclouds the memory
and invites failure in every conceivable form; it kills love and
assassinates the finer emotions of the heart, discourages friendship and
invites disaster in a hundred forms, leads to sleeplessness, misery and
unhappiness--and all this despite the obvious truth that we live in a
world of over-abundance of everything the heart could desire, with
nothing standing between us and our desires, excepting lack of a
definite purpose.

The Fear of Poverty is, without doubt, the most destructive of the six
basic fears. It has been placed at the head of the list, because it is
the most difficult to master. Considerable courage is required to state
the truth about the origin of this fear, and still greater courage to
accept the truth after it has been stated. The fear of poverty grew out
of man's inherited tendency to PREY UPON HIS FELLOW-MAN

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> ECONOMICALLY.
Nearly all animals lower than man are motivated by instinct, but their
capacity to "think" is limited, therefore, they prey upon one another
physically. Man, with his superior sense of intuition, with the capacity
to think and to reason, does not eat his fellowman bodily, he gets more
satisfaction out of "eating" him FINANCIALLY. Man is so avaricious that
every conceivable law has been passed to safeguard him from his
fellowman.

Of all the ages of the world, of which we know anything, the age in
which we live seems to be one that is outstanding because of man's
money-madness. A man is considered less than the dust of the earth,
unless he can display a fat bank account; but if he has money--NEVER
MIND HOW HE ACQUIRED IT--he is a "king" or a "big shot"; he is above the
law, he rules in politics, he dominates in business, and the whole world
about him bows in respect when he passes.

Nothing brings man so much suffering and humility as POVERTY! Only those
who have experienced poverty understand the full meaning of this.

It is no wonder that man *fears* poverty. Through a long line of
inherited experiences man has learned, for sure, that some men cannot be
trusted, where matters of money and earthly possessions are concerned.
This is a rather stinging indictment, the worst part of it being that it
is TRUE.

The majority of marriages are motivated by the wealth possessed by one,
or both of the contracting parties. It is no wonder, therefore, that the
divorce courts are busy.

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

So eager is man to possess wealth that he will acquire it in whatever
manner he can--through legal methods if possible--through other methods
if necessary or expedient.

Self-analysis may disclose weaknesses which one does not like to
acknowledge. This form of examination is essential to all who demand of
Life more than mediocrity and poverty. Remember, as you check yourself
point by point, that you are both the court and the jury, the
prosecuting attorney and the attorney for the defense, and that you are
the plaintiff and the defendant, also, that you are on trial. Face the
facts squarely. Ask yourself definite questions and demand direct
replies. When the examination is over, you will know more about
yourself. If you do not feel that you can be an impartial judge in this
self-examination, call upon someone who knows you well to serve as judge
while you cross-examine yourself. You are after the truth. *Get it, no
matter at what cost even, though it may temporarily embarrass you!*

The majority of people, if asked what they fear most, would reply, "I
fear nothing." The reply would be inaccurate, because few people realize
that they are bound, handicapped, whipped spiritually and physically
through some form of fear. So subtle and deeply seated is the emotion of
fear that one may go through life burdened with it, never recognizing
its presence. Only a courageous analysis will disclose the presence of
this universal enemy. When you begin such an analysis, search deeply
into your character. Here is a list of the symptoms for which you should
look:

| INDIFFERENCE.    | Commonly expressed through lack of ambition; willingness to tolerate poverty; acceptance of whatever compensation life may offer without protest; mental and physical laziness; lack of initiative, imagination, enthusiasm and self-control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| INDECISION.      | The habit of permitting others to do one's thinking. Staying "on the fence."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| DOUBT.           | Generally expressed through alibis and excuses designed to cover up, explain away, or apologize for one's failures, sometimes expressed in the form of envy of those who are successful, or by criticising them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| WORRY.           | Usually expressed by finding fault with others, a tendency to spend beyond one's income, neglect of personal appearance, scowling and frowning; intemperance in the use of alcoholic drink, sometimes through the use of narcotics; nervousness, lack of poise, self-consciousness and lack of self-reliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| OVER-CAUTION.    | The habit of looking for the negative side of every circumstance, thinking and talking of possible failure instead of concentrating upon the means of succeeding. Knowing all the roads to disaster, but never searching for the plans to avoid failure. Waiting for "the right time" to begin putting ideas and plans into action, until the waiting becomes a permanent habit. Remembering those who have failed, and forgetting those who have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

MONEY TALKS!

Some will ask, "why did you write a book about money? Why measure riches
in dollars, alone?" Some will believe, and rightly so, that there are

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

other forms of riches more desirable than money. Yes, there are riches
which cannot be measured in terms of dollars, but there are millions of
people who will say, "Give me all the money I need, and I will find
everything else I want."

The major reason why I wrote this book on how to get money is the fact
that the world has but lately passed through an experience that left
millions of men and women paralyzed with the FEAR OF POVERTY. What this
sort of fear does to one was well described by Westbrook Pegler, in the
New York World-Telegram, viz:

"Money is only clam shells or metal discs or scraps of paper, and there
are treasures of the heart and soul which money cannot buy, but most
people, being broke, are unable to keep this in mind and sustain their
spirits. When a man is down and out and on the street, unable to get any
job at all, something happens to his spirit which can be observed in the
droop of his shoulders, the set of his hat, his walk and his gaze. He
cannot escape a feeling of inferiority among people with regular
employment, even though he knows they are definitely not his equals in
character, intelligence or ability.

"These people--even his friends--feel, on the other hand, a sense of
superiority and regard him, perhaps unconsciously, as a casualty. He may
borrow for a time, but not enough to carry on in his accustomed way, and
he cannot continue to borrow very long. But borrowing in itself, when a
man is borrowing merely to live, is a depressing experience, and the
money lacks the power of earned money to revive his spirits. Of course,
none of this applies

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

to bums or habitual ne’er-do-wells, but only to men of normal ambitions
and self-respect.

"WOMEN CONCEAL DESPAIR.

"Women in the same predicament must be different. We somehow do not
think of women at all in considering the down-and-outers. They are
scarce in the breadlines, they rarely are seen begging on the streets,
and they are not recognizable in crowds by the same plain signs which
identify busted men. Of course, I do not mean the shuffling hags of the
city streets who are the opposite number of the confirmed male bums. I
mean reasonably young, decent and intelligent women. There must be many
of them, but their despair is not apparent. Maybe they kill themselves.

"When a man is down and out he has time on his hands for brooding. He
may travel miles to see a man about a job and discover that the job is
filled or that it is one of those jobs with no base pay but only a
commission on the sale of some useless knickknack which nobody would
buy, except out of pity. Turning that down, he finds himself back on the
street with nowhere to go but just anywhere. So he walks and walks. He
gazes into store windows at luxuries which are not for him, and feels
inferior and gives way to people who stop to look with an active
interest. He wanders into the railroad station or puts himself down in
the library to ease his legs and soak up a little heat, but that isn't
looking for a job, so he gets going again. He may not know it, but his
aimlessness would give him away even if the very lines of his figure did
not. He may be well dressed in the clothes left over from the days

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

when he had a steady job, but the clothes cannot disguise the droop.

"MONEY MAKES DIFFERENCE.

"He sees thousands of other people, bookkeepers or clerks or chemists or
wagon hands, busy at their work and envies them from the bottom of his
soul. They have their independence, their self-respect and manhood, and
he simply cannot convince himself that he is a good man, too, though he
argue it out and arrive at a favorable verdict hour after hour.

"It is just money which makes this difference in him. With a little
money he would be himself again.

"Some employers take the most shocking advantage of people who are down
and out. The agencies hang out little colored cards offering miserable
wages to busted men--$12 a week, $15 a week. An $18 a week job is a
plum, and anyone with $25 a week to offer does not hang the job in front
of an agency on a colored card. I have a want ad clipped from a local
paper demanding a clerk, a good, clean penman, to take telephone orders
for a sandwich shop from 11 A.M. to 2 P.M. for $8 a month--not $8 a week
but $8 a month. The ad says also, 'State religion.' Can you imagine the
brutal effrontery of anyone who demands a good, clean penman for 11
cents an hour inquiring into the victim's religion? But that is what
busted people are offered."

THE FEAR OF CRITICISM

Just how man originally came by this fear, no

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

one can state definitely, but one thing is certain--he has it in a
highly developed form. Some believe that this fear made its appearance
about the time that politics became a "profession." Others believe it
can be traced to the age when women first began to concern themselves
with "styles" in wearing apparel.

This author, being neither a humorist nor a prophet, is inclined to
attribute the basic fear of criticism to that part of man's inherited
nature which prompts him not only to take away his fellowman's goods and
wares, but to justify his action by CRITICISM of his fellowman's
character. It is a well known fact that a thief will criticise the man
from whom he steals--that politicians seek office, not by displaying
their own virtues and qualifications, but by attempting to besmirch
their opponents.

The fear of criticism takes on many forms, the majority of which are
petty and trivial. Baldheaded men, for example, are bald for no other
reason than their fear of criticism. Heads become bald because of the
tight fitting bands of hats which cut off the circulation from the roots
of the hair. Men wear hats, not because they actually need them, but
mainly because "everyone is doing it." The individual falls into line
and does likewise, lest some other individual CRITICISE him. Women
seldom have bald heads, or even thin hair, because they wear hats which
fit their heads loosely, the only purpose of the hats being adornment.

But, it must not be supposed that women are free from the fear of
criticism. If any woman

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

claims to be superior to man with reference to this fear, ask her to
walk down the street wearing a hat of the vintage of 1890.

The astute manufacturers of clothing have not been slow to capitalize
this basic fear of criticism, with which all mankind has been cursed.
Every season the styles in many articles of wearing apparel change. Who
establishes the styles? Certainly not the purchaser of clothing, but the
manufacturer. Why does he change the styles so often? The answer is
obvious. He changes the styles so he can sell more clothes.

For the same reason the manufacturers of automobiles (with a few rare
and very sensible exceptions) change styles of models every season. No
man wants to drive an automobile which is not of the latest style,
although the older model may actually be the better car.

We have been describing the manner in which people behave under the
influence of fear of criticism as applied to the small and petty things
of life. Let us now examine human behavior when this fear affects people
in connection with the more important events of human relationship. Take
for example practically any person who has reached the age of "mental
maturity" (from 35 to 40 years of age, as a general average), and if you
could read the secret thoughts of his mind, you would find a very
decided disbelief in most of the fables taught by the majority of the
dogmatists and theologians a few decades back.

Not often, however, will you find a person who has the courage to openly
state his belief on this

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

subject. Most people will, if pressed far enough, tell a lie rather than
admit that they do not believe the stories associated with that form of
religion which held people in bondage prior to the age of scientific
discovery and education.

Why does the average person, even in this day of enlightenment, shy away
from denying his belief in the fables which were the basis of most of
the religions a few decades ago? The answer is, "because of the fear of
criticism." Men and women have been burned at the stake for daring to
express disbelief in ghosts. It is no wonder we have inherited a
consciousness which makes us fear criticism. The time was, and not so
far in the past, when criticism carried severe punishments--it still
does in some countries.

The fear of criticism robs man of his initiative, destroys his power of
imagination, limits his individuality, takes away his self-reliance, and
does him damage in a hundred other ways. Parents often do their children
irreparable injury by criticising them. The mother of one of my boyhood
chums used to punish him with a switch almost daily, always completing
the job with the statement, "You'll land in the penitentiary before you
are twenty." He was sent to a Reformatory at the age of seventeen.

Criticism is the one form of service, of which everyone has too much.
Everyone has a stock of it which is handed out, gratis, whether called
for or not. One's nearest relatives often are the worst offenders. It
should be recognized as a crime (in reality it is a crime of the worst
nature), for any

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

parent to build inferiority complexes in the mind of a child, through
unnecessary criticism. Employers who understand human nature, get the
best there is in men, not by criticism, but by constructive suggestion.
Parents may accomplish the same results with their children. Criticism
will plant FEAR in the human heart, or resentment, but it will not build
love or affection.

SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF CRITICISM

This fear is almost as universal as the fear of poverty, and its effects
are just as fatal to personal achievement, mainly because this fear
destroys initiative, and discourages the use of imagination. The major
symptoms of the fear are:

THE FEAR OF ILL HEALTH

This fear may be traced to both physical and social heredity. It is
closely associated, as to its origin, with the causes of fear of Old Age
and the fear of Death, because it leads one closely to the border of
"terrible worlds" of which man knows not,

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

but concerning which he has been taught some discomforting stories. The
opinion is somewhat general, also, that certain unethical people engaged
in the business of "selling health" have had not a little to do with
keeping alive the fear of ill health.

In the main, man fears ill health because of the terrible pictures which
have been planted in his mind of what may happen if death should
overtake him. He also fears it because of the economic toll which it may
claim.

A reputable physician estimated that 75% of all people who visit
physicians for professional service are suffering with hypochondria
(imaginary illness). It has been shown most convincingly that the fear
of disease, even where there is not the slightest cause for fear, often
produces the physical symptoms of the disease feared.

Powerful and mighty is the human mind! It builds or it destroys.

Playing upon this common weakness of fear of ill health, dispensers of
patent medicines have reaped fortunes. This form of imposition upon
credulous humanity became so prevalent some twenty years ago that
Colliers' Weekly Magazine conducted a bitter campaign against some of
the worst offenders in the patent medicine business.

During the "flu" epidemic which broke out during the world war, the
mayor of New York City took drastic steps to check the damage which
people were doing themselves through their inherent fear of ill health.
He called in the newspaper men and said to them, "Gentlemen, I feel it
necessary to ask you not to publish any *scare headlines* concerning

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

the 'flu' epidemic. Unless you cooperate with me, we will have a
situation which we cannot control." The newspapers quit publishing
stories about the "flu," and within one month the epidemic had been
successfully checked.

Through a series of experiments conducted some years ago, it was proved
that people may be made ill by suggestion. We conducted this experiment
by causing three acquaintances to visit the "victims," each of whom
asked the question, "What ails you? You look terribly ill." The first
questioner usually provoked a grin, and a nonchalant "Oh, nothing, I'm
alright," from the victim. The second questioner usually was answered
with the statement, "I don't know exactly, but I do feel badly." The
third questioner was usually met with the frank admission that the
victim was actually feeling ill.

Try this on an acquaintance if you doubt that it will make him
uncomfortable, but do not carry the experiment too far. There is a
certain religious sect whose members take vengeance upon their enemies
by the "hexing" method. They call it "placing a spell" on the victim.

There is overwhelming evidence that disease sometimes begins in the form
of negative thought impulse. Such an impulse may be passed from one mind
to another, by suggestion, or created by an individual in his own mind.

A man who was blessed with more wisdom than this incident might
indicate, once said "When anyone asks me how I feel, I always want to
answer by knocking him down."

Doctors send patients into new climates for their

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

health, because a change of "mental attitude" is necessary. The seed of
fear of ill health lives in every human mind. Worry, fear,
discouragement, disappointment in love and business affairs, cause this
seed to germinate and grow. The recent business depression kept the
doctors on the run, because every form of negative thinking may cause
ill health.

Disappointments in business and in love stand at the head of the list of
causes of fear of ill health. A young man suffered a disappointment in
love which sent him to a hospital. For months he hovered between life
and death. A specialist in suggestive therapeutics was called in. The
specialist changed nurses, placing him in charge of a very *charming
young woman* who began (by pre-arrangement with the doctor) to make love
to him the first day of her arrival on the job. Within three weeks the
patient was discharged from the hospital, still suffering, but with an
entirely different malady. HE WAS IN LOVE AGAIN. The remedy was a hoax,
but the patient and the nurse were later married. Both are in good
health at the time of this writing.

| HYPOCHONDRIA.    | The habit of talking of illness, concentrating the mind upon disease, and expecting its appearance until a nervous break occurs. Nothing that comes in bottles can cure this condition. It is brought on by negative thinking and nothing but positive thought can affect a cure. Hypochondria, (a medical term for imaginary disease) is said to do as much damage on occasion, as the disease one fears might do. Most so-called cases of "nerves" come from imaginary illness. |
| EXERCISE.        | Fear of ill health often interferes with proper physical exercise, and results in over-weight, by causing one to avoid outdoor life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| SUSCEPTIBILITY.  | Fear of ill health breaks down Nature's body resistance, and creates a favorable condition for any form of disease one may contact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|                  | The fear of ill health often is related to the fear of Poverty, especially in the case of the hypochondriac, who constantly worries about the possibility of having to pay doctor's bills, hospital bills, etc. This type of person spends much time preparing for sickness, talking about death, saving money for cemetery lots, and burial expenses, etc.                                                                                                                       |

THE FEAR OF LOSS OF LOVE

The original source of this inherent fear needs but little description,
because it obviously grew out of man's polygamous habit of stealing his
fellowman's mate, and his habit of taking liberties with her whenever he
could.

Jealousy, and other similar forms of dementia praecox grow out of man's
inherited fear of the loss of love of someone. This fear is the most
painful of all the six basic fears. It probably plays more havoc with
the body and mind than any of the other basic fears, as it often leads
to permanent insanity.

The fear of the loss of love probably dates back to the stone age, when
men stole women by brute force. They continue to steal females, but
their technique has changed. Instead of force, they now use persuasion,
the promise of pretty clothes, motor

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

ears, and other "bait" much more effective than physical force. Man's
habits are the same as they were at the dawn of civilization, but he
expresses them differently.

Careful analysis has shown that women are more susceptible to this fear
than men. This fact is easily explained. Women have learned, from
experience, that men are polygamous by nature, that they are not to be
trusted in the hands of rivals.

THE FEAR OF OLD AGE

In the main, this fear grows out of two sources. First, the thought that
old age may bring with it POVERTY. Secondly, and by far the most common
source of origin, from false and cruel teachings of the past which have
been too well mixed with "fire and brimstone," and other bogies
cunningly designed to enslave man through fear.

In the basic fear of old age, man has two very sound reasons for his
apprehension–one growing out of his distrust of his fellowman, who may
seize whatever worldly goods he may possess, and the other arising from
the terrible pictures of the world beyond, which were planted in his
mind, through social heredity before he came into full possession of his
mind.

The possibility of ill health, which is more common as people grow
older, is also a contributing cause of this common fear of old age.
Eroticism also enters into the cause of the fear of old age, as no man
cherishes the thought of diminishing sex attraction.

The most common cause of fear of old age is associated with the
possibility of poverty. "Poorhouse" is not a pretty word. It throws a
chill into the mind of every person who faces the possibility of having
to spend his declining years on a poor farm.

Another contributing cause of the fear of old age, is the possibility of
loss of freedom and independence,

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

as old age may bring with it the loss of both physical and economic
freedom.

SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF OLD AGE

The commonest symptoms of this fear are:

|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        | The tendency to slow down and develop an inferiority complex at the age of mental maturity, around the age of forty, falsely believing one's self to be "slipping" because of age. (The truth is that man's most useful years, mentally and spiritually, are those between forty and sixty) .                                        |
|        | The habit of speaking apologetically of one's self as "being old" merely because one has reached the age of forty, or fifty, instead of reversing the rule and expressing gratitude for having reached the age of wisdom and understanding.                                                                                          |

|        | The habit of killing off initiative, imagination, and self-reliance by falsely believing one's self too old to exercise these qualities. The habit of the man or woman of forty dressing with the aim of trying to appear much younger, and affecting mannerisms of youth; thereby inspiring ridicule by both friends and strangers. |

THE FEAR OF DEATH

To some this is the cruelest of all the basic fears. The reason is
obvious. The terrible pangs of fear associated with the thought of
death, in the majority

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

of cases, may be charged directly to religious fanaticism. So-called
"heathen" are less afraid of death than the more "civilized." For
hundreds of millions of years man has been asking the still unanswered
questions, "whence" and "whither." Where did I come from, and where am I
going?

During the darker ages of the past, the more cunning and crafty were not
slow to offer the answer to these questions, FOR A PRICE. Witness, now,
the major source of origin of the FEAR OF DEATH.

"Come into my tent, embrace my faith, accept my dogmas, and I will give
you a ticket that will admit you straightaway into heaven when you die,"
cries a leader of sectarianism. "Remain out of my tent," says the same
leader, "and may the devil take you and burn you throughout eternity."

ETERNITY is a long time. FIRE is a terrible thing. The thought of
eternal punishment, with fire, not only causes man to fear death, it
often causes him to lose his reason. It destroys interest in life and
makes happiness impossible.

During my research, I reviewed a book entitled "A Catalogue of the
Gods," in which were listed the *30,000* gods which man has worshiped.
Think of it! Thirty thousand of them, represented by everything from a
crawfish to a man. It is little wonder that men have become frightened
at the approach of death.

While the religious leader may not be able to provide safe conduct into
heaven, nor, by lack of such provision, allow the unfortunate to descend
into hell, the possibility of the latter seems so terrible

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

that the very thought of it lays hold of the imagination in such a
realistic way that it paralyzes reason, and sets up the fear of death.

In truth, NO MAN KNOWS, and no man has ever known, what heaven or hell
is like, nor does any man know if either place actually exists. This
very lack of positive knowledge opens the door of the human mind to the
charlatan so he may enter and control that mind with his stock of
legerdemain and various brands of pious fraud and trickery.

The fear of DEATH is not as common now as it was during the age when
there were no great colleges and universities. Men of science have
turned the spotlight of truth upon the world, and this truth is rapidly
freeing men and women from this terrible fear of DEATH. The young men
and young women who attend the colleges and universities are not easily
impressed by "fire" and "brimstone." Through the aid of biology,
astronomy, geology, and other related sciences, the fears of the dark
ages which gripped the minds of men and destroyed their reason have been
dispelled.

Insane asylums are filled with men and women who have gone mad, because
of the FEAR OF DEATH.

This fear is useless. Death will come, no matter what anyone may think
about it. Accept it as a necessity, and pass the thought out of your
mind. It must be a necessity, or it would not come to all. Perhaps it is
not as bad as it has been pictured.

The entire world is made up of only two things, ENERGY and MATTER. In
elementary physics we learn that neither matter nor energy (the only

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

two realities known to man) can be created nor destroyed. Both matter
and energy can be transformed, but neither can be destroyed.

Life is energy, if it is anything. If neither energy nor matter can be
destroyed, of course life cannot be destroyed. Life, like other forms of
energy, may be passed through various processes of transition, or
change, but it cannot be destroyed. Death is mere transition.

If death is not mere change, or transition, then nothing comes after
death except a long, eternal, peaceful sleep, and sleep is nothing to be
feared. Thus you may wipe out, forever, the fear of Death.

SYMPTOMS OF THE FEAR OF DEATH

The general symptoms of this fear are:

|        | The habit of THINKING about dying instead of making the most of LIFE, due, generally, to lack of purpose, or lack of a suitable occupation. This fear is more prevalent among the aged, but sometimes the more youthful are victims of it. The greatest of all remedies for the fear of death is a BURNING DESIRE FOR ACHIEVEMENT, backed by useful service to others. A busy person seldom has time to think about dying. He finds life too thrilling to worry about death. Sometimes the fear of death is closely associated with the Fear of Poverty, where one's death would leave loved ones poverty-stricken. In other cases, the fear of death is caused by illness and the consequent breaking down of physical body resistance. The commonest causes of the fear |

OLD MAN WORRY

Worry is a state of mind based upon fear. It works slowly, but
persistently. It is [insidious](errata.htm#3.md) and subtle. Step by step
it "digs itself in" until it paralyzes one's reasoning faculty, destroys
self-confidence and initiative. Worry is a form of sustained fear caused
by indecision therefore it is a state of mind which can be controlled.

An unsettled mind is helpless. Indecision makes an unsettled mind. Most
individuals lack the willpower to reach decisions promptly, and to stand
by them after they have been made, even during normal business
conditions. During periods of economic unrest (such as the world
recently experienced), the individual is handicapped, not alone by his
inherent nature to be slow at reaching decisions, but he is influenced
by the indecision of others around him who have created a state of "mass
indecision."

During the depression the whole atmosphere, all over the world, was
filled with "Fearenza" and "Worryitis," the two mental disease germs
which began to spread themselves after the Wall Street frenzy in 1929.
There is only one known antidote for these germs; it is the habit of
prompt and firm DECISION. Moreover, it is an antidote which every
individual must apply for himself.

We do not worry over conditions, once we have reached a decision to
follow a definite line of action.

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I once interviewed
a man who was to be electrocuted two hours later. The condemned man was
the calmest of some eight men who were in the death-cell with him. His
calmness prompted me to ask him how it felt to know that he was going
into eternity in a short while. With a smile of confidence on his face,
he said, "It feels fine. Just think, brother, my troubles will soon be
over. I have had nothing but trouble all my life. It has been a hardship
to get food and clothing. Soon I will not need these things. I have felt
fine ever since I learned FOR CERTAIN that I must die. I made up my mind
then, to accept my fate in good spirit."

As he spoke he devoured a dinner of proportions sufficient for three
men, eating every mouthful of the food brought to him, and apparently
enjoying it as much as if no disaster awaited him. DECISION gave this
man resignation to his fate! Decision can also prevent one's acceptance
of undesired circumstances.

The six basic fears become translated into a state of worry, through
indecision. Relieve yourself, forever of the fear of death, by reaching
a decision to accept death as an inescapable event. Whip the fear of
poverty by reaching a decision to get along with whatever wealth you can
accumulate WITHOUT WORRY. Put your foot upon the neck of the fear of
criticism by reaching a decision NOT TO WORRY about what other people
think, do, or say. Eliminate the fear of old age by reaching a decision
to accept it, not as a handicap, but as a great blessing which carries
with it wisdom, self-control, and understanding not known to youth.

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Acquit yourself of
the fear of ill health by the decision to forget symptoms. Master the
fear of loss of love by reaching a decision to get along without love,
if that is necessary.

Kill the habit of worry, in all its forms, by reaching a general,
blanket decision that nothing which life has to offer is worth the price
of worry. With this decision will come poise, peace of mind, and
calmness of thought which will bring happiness.

A man whose mind is filled with fear not only destroys his own chances
of intelligent action, but, he transmits these destructive vibrations to
the minds of all who come into contact with him, and destroys, also
their chances.

Even a dog or a horse knows when its master lacks courage; moreover, a
dog or a horse will pick up the vibrations of fear thrown off by its
master, and behave accordingly. Lower down the line of intelligence in
the animal kingdom, one finds this same capacity to pick up the
vibrations of fear. A honey-bee immediately senses fear in the mind of a
person--for reasons unknown, a bee will sting the person whose mind is
releasing vibrations of fear, much more readily than it will molest the
person whose mind registers no fear.

The vibrations of fear pass from one mind to another just as quickly and
as surely as the sound of the human voice passes from the broadcasting
station to the receiving set of a radio--and BY THE SELF-SAME MEDIUM.

*Mental telepathy is a reality*. Thoughts pass from one mind to another,
voluntarily, whether or not this fact is recognized by either the person
re-

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

leasing the thoughts, or the persons who pick up those thoughts.

The person who gives expression, by word of mouth, to negative or
destructive thoughts is practically certain to experience the results of
those words in the form of a destructive "kick-back." The release of
destructive thought impulses, alone, without the aid of words, produces
also a "kickback" in more ways than one. First of all, and perhaps most
important to be remembered, the person who releases thoughts of a
destructive nature, must suffer damage through the breaking down of the
faculty of creative imagination. Secondly, the presence in the mind of
any destructive emotion develops a negative personality which repels
people, and often converts them into antagonists. The third source of
damage to the person who entertains or releases negative thoughts, lies
in this significant fact--these thought-impulses are not only damaging
to others, but they IMBED THEMSELVES IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND OF THE
PERSON RELEASING THEM, and there become a part of his character.

One is never through with a thought, merely by releasing it. When a
thought is released, it spreads in every direction, through the medium
of the ether, but it also plants itself *permanently* in the
subconscious mind of *the person releasing it*.

Your business in life is, presumably to achieve success. To be
successful, you must find peace of mind, acquire the material needs of
life, and above all, attain HAPPINESS. All of these evidences of success
begin in the form of thought impulses.

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

You may control your own mind, you have the power to feed it whatever
thought impulses you choose. With this privilege goes also the
responsibility of using it constructively. You are the master of your
own earthly destiny just as surely as you have the power to control your
own thoughts. You may influence, direct, and eventually control your own
environment, making your life what you want it to be--or, you may
neglect to exercise the privilege which is yours, to make your life to
order, thus casting yourself upon the broad sea of "Circumstance" where
you will be tossed hither and yon, like a chip on the waves of the
ocean.

THE DEVIL'S WORKSHOP

THE SEVENTH BASIC EVIL

In addition to the Six Basic Fears, there is another evil by which
people suffer. It constitutes a rich soil in which the seeds of failure
grow abundantly. It is so subtle that its presence often is not
detected. This affliction cannot properly be classed as a fear. IT IS
MORE DEEPLY SEATED AND MORE OFTEN FATAL THAN ALL OF THE SIX FEARS. For
want of a better name, let us call this evil SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEGATIVE
INFLUENCES.

Men who accumulate great riches always protect themselves against this
evil! The poverty stricken never do! Those who succeed in any calling
must prepare their minds to resist the evil. If you are reading this
philosophy for the purpose of accumulating riches, you should examine
yourself very

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

carefully, to determine whether you are susceptible to negative
influences. If you neglect this self-analysis, you will forfeit your
right to attain the object of your desires.

Make the analysis searching. After you read the questions prepared for
this self-analysis, hold yourself to a strict accounting in your
answers. Go at the task as carefully as you would search for any other
enemy you knew to be awaiting you in ambush and deal with your own
faults as you would with a more tangible enemy.

You can easily protect yourself against highway robbers, because the law
provides organized cooperation for your benefit, but the "seventh basic
evil" is more difficult to master, because it strikes when you are not
aware of its presence, when you are asleep, and while you are awake.
Moreover, its weapon is intangible, because it consists of merely--a
STATE OF MIND. This evil is also dangerous because it strikes in as many
different forms as there are human experiences. Sometimes it enters the
mind through the well-meant words of one's own relatives. At other
times, it bores from within, through one's own mental attitude. Always
it is as deadly as poison, even though it may not kill as quickly.

HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST NEGATIVE INFLUENCES

To protect yourself against negative influences, whether of your own
making, or the result of the activities of negative people around you,
recognize that you have a WILL-POWER, and put it into

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

constant use, until it builds a wall of immunity against negative
influences in your own mind.

Recognize the fact that you, and every other human being, are, by
nature, lazy, indifferent, and susceptible to all suggestions which
harmonize with your weaknesses.

Recognize that you are, by nature, susceptible to all the six basic
fears, and set up. habits for the purpose of counteracting all these
fears.

Recognize that negative influences often work on you through your
subconscious mind, therefore they are difficult to detect, and keep your
mind closed against all people who depress or discourage you in any way.

Clean out your medicine chest, throw away all pill bottles, and stop
pandering to colds, aches, pains and imaginary illness.

Deliberately seek the company of people who influence you to THINK AND
ACT FOR YOURSELF.

Do not EXPECT troubles as they have a tendency not to disappoint.

*Without doubt, the most common weakness of all human beings is the
habit of leaving their minds open to the negative influence of other
people*. This weakness is all the more damaging, because most people do
not recognize that they are cursed by it, and many who acknowledge it,
neglect or refuse to correct the evil until it becomes an uncontrollable
part of their daily habits.

To aid those who wish to see themselves as they really are, the
following list of questions has been prepared. Read the questions and
state your answers

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

aloud, so you can hear your own voice. This will make it easier for you
to be truthful with yourself.

What is your greatest worry? Why do you tolerate it?

When others offer you free, unsolicited advice, do you accept it without
question, or analyze their motive?

What, above all else, do you most DESIRE? Do you intend to acquire it?
Are you willing to

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

How much time have you devoted to studying and answering these
questions? (At least one day is necessary for the analysis and the
answering of the entire list.)

 

If you have answered all these questions truthfully, you know more about
yourself than the majority of people. Study the questions carefully,
come back to them once each week for several months, and be astounded at
the amount of additional knowledge of great value to yourself, you will
have gained by the simple method of answering the questions truthfully.
If you are not certain concerning the answers to some of the questions,
seek the counsel of those who know you well, especially those who have
no motive in flattering you, and see yourself through their eyes. The
experience will be astonishing.

You have ABSOLUTE CONTROL over but one

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

thing, and that is your thoughts. This is the most significant and
inspiring of all facts known to man! It reflects man's Divine nature.
This Divine prerogative is the sole means by which you may control your
own destiny. If you fail to control your own mind, you may be sure you
will control nothing else.

If you must be careless with your possessions, let it be in connection
with material things. *Your mind is your spiritual estate!* Protect and
use it with the care to which Divine Royalty is entitled. You were given
a WILL-POWER for this purpose.

Unfortunately, there is no legal protection against those who, either by
design or ignorance, poison the minds of others by negative suggestion.
This form of destruction should be punishable by heavy legal penalties,
because it may and often does destroy one's chances of acquiring
material things which are protected by law.

Men with negative minds tried to convince Thomas A. Edison that he could
not build a machine that would record and reproduce the human voice,
"because" they said, "no one else had ever produced such a machine."
Edison did not believe them. He knew that the mind could produce
ANYTHING THE MIND COULD CONCEIVE AND BELIEVE, and that knowledge was the
thing that lifted the great Edison above the common herd.

Men with negative minds told F. W. Woolworth, he would go "broke" trying
to run a store on five and ten cent sales. He did not believe them. He
knew that he could do anything, within reason, if he backed his plans
with faith. Exercising his right to keep other men's negative
suggestions out of his

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

mind, he piled up a fortune of more than a hundred million dollars.

Men with negative minds told George Washington he could not hope to win
against the vastly superior forces of the British, but he exercised his
Divine right to BELIEVE, therefore this book was published under the
protection of the Stars and Stripes, while the name of Lord Cornwallis
has been all but forgotten.

Doubting Thomases scoffed scornfully when Henry Ford tried out his first
crudely built automobile on the streets of Detroit. Some said the thing
never would become practical. Others said no one would pay money for
such a contraption. FORD SAID, "I'LL BELT THE EARTH WITH DEPENDABLE
MOTOR CARS," AND HE DID! His decision to trust his own judgment has
already piled up a fortune far greater than the next five generations of
his descendents can squander. For the benefit of those seeking vast
riches, let it be remembered that practically the sole difference
between Henry Ford and a majority of the more than one hundred thousand
men who work for him, is this--FORD HAS A MIND AND CONTROLS IT, THE
OTHERS HAVE MINDS WHICH THEY DO NOT TRY TO CONTROL.

Henry Ford has been repeatedly mentioned, because he is an astounding
example of what a man with a mind of his own, and a will to control it,
can accomplish. His record knocks the foundation from under that
time-worn alibi, "I never had a chance." Ford never had a chance,
either, but he CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY AND BACKED IT WITH

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> PERSISTENCE UNTIL
IT MADE HIM RICHER THAN CROESUS.

Mind control is the result of self-discipline and habit. You either
control your mind or it controls you. There is no half-way compromise.
The most practical of all methods for controlling the mind is the habit
of keeping it busy with a definite purpose, backed by a definite plan.
Study the record of any man who achieves noteworthy success, and you
will observe that he has control over his own mind, moreover, that he
exercises that control and directs it toward the attainment of definite
objectives. Without this control, success is not possible.

"FIFTY-SEVEN" FAMOUS ALIBIS

By Old Man IF

People who do not succeed have one distinguishing trait in common. They
know *all the reasons for failure*, and have what they believe to be
air-tight alibis to explain away their own lack of achievement.

Some of these alibis are clever, and a few of them are justifiable by
the facts. But alibis cannot be used for money. The world wants to know
only one thing--HAVE YOU ACHIEVED SUCCESS?

A character analyst compiled a list of the most commonly used alibis. As
you read the list, examine yourself carefully, and determine how many of
these alibis, if any, are your own property. Remember, too, the
philosophy presented in this book makes every one of these alibis
obsolete.

Building alibis with which to explain away failure is a national
pastime. The habit is as old as the

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

human race, and is *fatal to success!* Why do people cling to their pet
alibis? The answer is obvious. They defend their alibis because THEY
CREATE them! A man's alibi is the child of his own imagination. It is
human nature to defend one's own brain-child.

Building alibis is a deeply rooted habit. Habits are difficult to break,
especially when they provide justification for something we do. Plato
had this truth in mind when he said, "The first and best victory is to
conquer self. To be conquered by self is, of all things, the most
shameful and vile."

Another philosopher had the same thought in mind when he said, "It was a
great surprise to me when I discovered that most of the ugliness I saw
in others, was but a reflection of my own nature."

"It has always been a mystery to me," said Elbert Hubbard, "why people
spend so much time deliberately fooling themselves by creating alibis to
cover their weaknesses. If used differently, this same time would be
sufficient to cure the weakness, then no alibis would be needed."

In parting, I would remind you that "Life is a checkerboard, and the
player opposite you is TIME. If you hesitate before moving, or neglect
to move promptly, your men will be wiped off the board by TIME. You are
playing against a partner who will not tolerate INDECISION!"

Previously you may have had a logical excuse for not having forced Life
to come through with whatever you asked, but that alibi is now obsolete,
because you are in possession of the Master Key that unlocks the door to
Life's bountiful riches.

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

The Master Key is intangible, but it is powerful! It is the privilege of
creating, *in your own mind*, a BURNING DESIRE for a definite form of
riches. There is no penalty for the use of the Key, but there is a price
you must pay if you do not use it. The price is FAILURE. There is a
reward of stupendous proportions if you put the Key to use. It is the
satisfaction that comes to all who *conquer self and force Life to pay
whatever is asked*.

The reward is worthy of your effort. Will you make the start and be
convinced?

"If we are related," said the immortal Emerson, "we shall meet." In
closing, may I borrow his thought, and say, "If we are related, we have,
through these pages, met."

THE END
