### WHERE DEMONSTRATION TAKES PLACE.

DOES demonstration take place in the patient, the practitioner or in the
mind of God? Let us see; We are in the mind of God and so it must take
place there. But the patient is also in the mind of God or there would
be two minds, and so it must take place in the mind of the patient,
also. But that is the mind of God, so what does it matter where it takes
place? We do not have to project our thought, because Mind is right at
hand and never leaves us at any time. All that we have to do is to know
within ourselves, and, when we are absolutely convinced, we will have
made the demonstration.

As far as the practitioner is concerned, all that he has to do is to
convince himself. Here his work begins and ends. There is a power that
will look after the rest. Is this not the supreme attitude of faith in
higher power? Of course it is, and the more of that faith that we have,
the easier it will be for us and the quicker we will receive an answer
to our prayer. If you have a simple, childlike faith it will produce;
but it should give us a greater faith when we know something of the way
that the law operates. It follows, then, that we should, by
understanding, have so great a faith that we shall never fail to get the
affirmative answer to all of our thoughts. Each victory will strengthen
us until the time will come when we will no longer have to say *I hope*
or *believe*, but *I know*.
