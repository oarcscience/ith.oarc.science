### VISUALIZING.

SOME people visualize everything that they think of and many think that
it is impossible to make a demonstration unless they possess the power
to visualize. This is not the case. While a certain amount of vision is
necessary, on the other hand it must be remembered that we are dealing
with a power that is like the soil of the ground, which will produce the
plant when we plant seed. It does not matter if we have never before
seen a plant like the one that is to be made for us. Our thought is the
seed and mind is the soil. We are always planting and harvesting. All
that we need to do is to plant only that which we want to harvest. This
is not difficult to understand. We cannot think poverty and at the same
time demonstrate plenty. If a person wants to visualize let him do so,
and if he sees himself in full possession of his desire and knows that
he is receiving, he will make his demonstration. If, on the other hand,
he does not visualize, then let him simply state what he wants and
absolutely believe that he has it and the result will always be the
same.

Remember that you are always dealing with law and that this is the only
way that anything could come into existence. Don't argue over it. That
means that you have not as yet become convinced of the truth or you
would not argue. Be convinced and rest in peace.
