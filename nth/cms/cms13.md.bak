### THE CONTROL OF THOUGHT.

THE man who can control his thought can have and do what he wishes to
have and to do; everything is his for the asking. He must remember that
whatever he gets is his to use but not his to hold. Creation is always
flowing by and we have as much of it as we can take and use; more would
cause stagnation.

We are relieved of all thought of clinging to anybody or anything.
Cannot the Great Principle' of Life create for us faster than we can
spend or use? The universe is inexhaustible; it is limitless; it knows
no bounds and has no confines. We are not depending on a reed shaken by
the wind, but on the *principle of life itself*, for all that we want,
have or ever shall have. It is not *some* power, or *a great* power, we
affirm again; it is ALL POWER. All that we have to do is to believe this
and act as though it were so, never wavering, not even once, no matter
what happens. As we do this we shall find that things are steadily
coming our way, and that they are coming without that awful effort that
destroys the peace of the majority of the race. We know that there can
be no failure in the Divine Mind, and this Mind is the Power on which we
are depending.

Now just because we are depending upon Divine Mind we must not think
that we do not have to do our share. God will work through us if we will
let Him, but we must act in the outer as though we were sure of
ourselves. Our part is to believe, and then to act in faith.

Jesus went to the tomb of Lazarus believing and knowing that God was
working through Him. Often we may have to go somewhere or do something
and we must know with deep conviction that there will be a power going
with us that none can gainsay. When we feel this secure place in our
thought, all that we will have to do is to act. There is no doubt but
that the *creative power of the universe will answer; it always does*.
And so we need not take the worry upon ourselves, but rather we will
"Make known our requests with thanksgiving."

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

When Jesus said, "All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe
that ye receive them and ye shall have them," he was uttering one of
those many deep truths that were so clear to Him and that we are just
beginning to see. He knew that everything is made out of mind and that
without that positive acceptance on the part of the individual there is
no mold into which mind can pour itself forth into form. In the mind of
God there is the correct mold, the true knowing, but in the mind of man
there is not always this true knowing. Since God can do *for* us only by
doing *through* us, nothing can be done for us unless we are positively
receptive, but when we realize the law and how it works, then we will
provide that complete inner acceptance. By so doing we permit the Spirit
to do the work, to make the gift.

The reason we can make our requests known with thanksgiving is because
we know from the beginning that we are to receive and therefore we
cannot help being thankful. This grateful attitude to the Spirit puts us
in very close touch with power and adds much to the reality of the thing
that we are dealing with. Without it we can do but little. So let us
cultivate all the gratitude that we can. In gratitude we will send our
thoughts out into the world, and as it comes back it will come laden
with the fruits of the Spirit.
