### USING THE IMAGINATION.

JUST imagine yourself surrounded by mind, so plastic, so receptive, that
it receives the slightest impression of your thought. Whatever you think
it takes up and executes for you. Every thought is received and acted
upon. Not some but all thoughts. Whatever the pattern we provide, that
will be our demonstration. If we cannot get over thinking that we are
poor then we will still remain poor. As soon as we become rich in our
thought then we

will be rich in our expression. These are not mere words, but the
deepest truth that has ever come to the human race. Hundreds of
thousands of the most intelligent thinkers and the most spiritual people
of our day are proving this truth. We are not dealing with illusions but
with realities; pay no more attention to the one who ridicules these
ideas than you would to the blowing of the wind.

In the center of your own soul choose what you want to become, to
accomplish; keep it to yourself. Every clay in the silence of absolute
conviction know that it is now done. It is just as much done, as far as
you are concerned, as it will be when you experience it in the outer.
Imagine yourself to be what you want to be. See only that which you
desire, refuse even to think of the other. Stick to it, never doubt. Say
many times a day, "I am that thing," realize what this means. It means
that the great Universal power of Mind is that, and it cannot fail.
