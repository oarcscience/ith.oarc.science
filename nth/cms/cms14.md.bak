### CREATING ATMOSPHERE.

TO the student who has realized that all is mind and that everything is
governed by law, there comes another thought: it is that he can create,
or have created for him, from his own thinking. He can create such a
strong mental atmosphere of success that its power of attraction will be
irresistible. He can send his thought throughout the world and have it
bring back to him whatever he wants. He can so fill his place of
business with the power of success that it will draw from far and near.
Thought will always bring back to us what we send out. First we must
clear our thought of all unbelief. This book is written for those who
believe; and to those who do believe it will come true in their lives.

Without mental clearness on the part of the thinker there can be no real
creative work done. As water will reach only its own level, so mind will
return to us only what we first believe. We arc always getting what we
believe but not always what we want. Our thought has the power to reach,
in the outer form of conditions, an exact correspondence to our inner
convictions.

By thinking, you set in motion a power that creates. It will be exactly
as you think. You throw out into mind an idea, and mind creates it for
you and sets it on the path of your life. Think of it, then, as your
greatest friend. It is always with you wherever you may be. It never
deserts you. You are never alone. There is no doubt, no fear, no
wondering; you *know*. You are going to use the only power that there is
in the universe. You are going

to use it for a definite purpose. You have already fixed this purpose in
your thought; now you are going to speak it forth.

You are speaking it for your own good. You desire only the good and you
know that only the good can come to you. You have made your unity with
life, and now life is going to help you in your affairs.

You are going to establish in your rooms such an atmosphere of success
that it will become an irresistible power; it will sweep everything
before it as it realizes the greatness and the All-Mightiness of the
One. You are so sure, that you will not even look to see if it is going
to happen; you KNOW.

And now your word, which is one with the Infinite Life, is to be spoken
in calm, perfect trust. It is to be taken up, and at once it is to be
operated on. Perfect is the pattern and perfect will be the result. You
see yourself surrounded by the thing that you desire. More than this,
you *are* the thing that you desire. Your word is now establishing it
forever; see this, feel it, know it. You are now encompassed by perfect
life, by infinite activity, by all power, by all guidance. The power of
the Spirit is drawing to you all people; it is supplying you with all
good; it is filling you with all life, truth and love.

Wait in perfect silence while that inner power takes it up. And then you
know that it is done unto you. There goes forth from this word the power
of the Infinite. "The words which I speak, they are spirit and they are
life."
