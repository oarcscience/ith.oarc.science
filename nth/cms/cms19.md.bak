### MAN'S RIGHT OF CHOICE.

MAN is created an individual and as such he has the power of choice.
Many people seem to think that man should not choose, that since he has
asked the Spirit to lead him, he need no longer act, or choose. This is
taught by many teachers but is not consistent with our individuality.
Unless we had this privilege, this power of choice, we would not be
individuals. What we do need to learn is that the Spirit can choose
through us. But when this happens it is an act on our part. Even though
we say, "I will not choose," we are still choosing; because we are
choosing not to choose.

We cannot escape the fact that we are made in such a way that at every
step life is a constant choice. What we do need to do is to select what
we feel to be right and know that the universe will never deny us
anything. We choose and Mind creates. We should endeavor to choose that
which will express always a greater life and we must remember that the
Spirit is always seeking to express love and beauty through us. If we
are attuned to these, and are working in harmony with the great creative
power, we need have no doubt about its willingness to work for us.

We must know exactly what it is that we wish and get the perfect mental
picture of it. We must believe absolutely that we now have it and never
do or say anything that denies it.
