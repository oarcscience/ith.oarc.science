### ONE LAW AND MANY MANIFESTATIONS.

PEOPLE often ask if the Law will not bring harm as well as good. This
question would never be asked if people understood what Universal Law
really means. Of course it will bring us what we think. All law will do
the same thing. The law of electricity will either light our house or
burn it down. We decide what we are to do with the Law. Law is always
impersonal. There is no likelihood of using the Law for harmful purposes
if we always use it for the more complete expression of life.

We must not use it for any purpose that we would not like to experience
ourselves. This should answer all questions of that nature. Do I really
want the thing I ask for? Am I willing to take for myself what I ask for
other people? How can we use the Law for evil if we desire only the
good? We cannot and we should not bother about it. We want only the good
for ourselves and for the whole world; when we have started causation,
at once the Law will set to work carrying out our plans. Never distrust
the Law and become afraid lest you misuse it. That is a great mistake,
all Law is impersonal and cares not who uses it. It will bring to all
just what is already in their thought. No person can long use it in a
destructive way, for it will destroy himself if he persists in doing
wrong. We have no responsibility for any one except ourselves. Get over
all idea that you must save the world; we have all tried and have all
failed. We may, by demonstrating in our own lives, prove that the Law
really exists as the great power behind all things. This is all that we
can do. Every one

must do the same thing for himself. Let the dead bury their dead, and
see that you live. In this you are not selfish but are simply proving
that law governs your life. All can do the same when they come to
believe, and none until they believe.
