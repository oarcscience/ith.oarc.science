Although similar in title, theme and structure to his book [Creative
Mind](../../eso/cm/index.md), this is a completely different book. Creative
Mind has more of a focus on "Mental Healing." This book is principally
about what is today called in New Age circles "Prosperity
Consciousness". Holmes discusses how to focus one's thoughts to create
monetary wealth, as well as increase one's personal charisma to garner
circles of friends. This little classic of New Thought is very similar
to its successor, [Think and Grow Rich](../tgr/index.md), optimistic,
self-empowering, and confident in its outlook.
