### THE BEGINNING OF UNDERSTANDING.

MAN is beginning to realize that he has life within himself as the great
gift of God to him. If he really has life, if it is the same nature as
the life of God, if he is an individual and has the right of self-choice
which constitutes individuality; then it follows that he can do with his
life what the wants to do: he can make out of Himself that which he
wishes. Freedom is his, but this freedom is within law and never outside
it. Man must obey law. If he disobeys it, it has to act as law, and so
acting has to punish him. This he cannot change but must submit to.
Freedom comes to the individual from understanding the laws of his own
life, and conforming to them, thereby subjecting them to his use, to the
end of health, happiness and success.

Law obtains throughout all nature, governing all things, both the seen
and the unseen. Law is not physical or material but mental and
spiritual. Law is God's method of operation. We should think of God as
the great Spirit

whose sole impulse is love, freely giving of Himself to all who ask and
ref using none. God is our Father in every sense of the term, watching
over, caring for and loving all alike. While all is love, yet, in order
that things may not be chaotic, all is governed by law. And as far as
you and I are concerned, *this law is always mental*.
