### OUR CONDITIONS GOVERNED BY OUR THINKING.

IT is easy for the average person to see how it is that mind can
control, and to a certain extent govern, the functions of the body. Some
can go even further than this and see that the body is governed entirely
by consciousness. This they can see without much difficulty, but it is
not so easy for them to see how it is that thought governs their
conditions and decides whether they are to be successes or failures.

Here we will stop to ask the question: If our conditions are not
controlled by thought, by what, then, are they controlled? Some will say
that conditions are controlled by circumstances. But what are
circumstances? Are they cause or are they effect? Of course they are
always effect; everything that we see is an effect. An effect is
something that follows a cause, and we are dealing with causation only;
effects do not make themselves, but they are held in place by mind, or
causation.

If this does not answer your thought, begin over again and realize that
behind everything that is seen is the silent cause. In your life you are
that cause. There is nothing but mind, and nothing moves except as mind
moves it. We have agreed that, while God is love, yet your life is

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

governed absolutely by mind, or law. In our lives of conditions we are
the cause, and nothing moves except as our mind moves it.

The activity of our mind is thought., We are always acting because we
are always thinking. At all times we are either drawing things to us or
we are pushing them away from us. In the ordinary individual this
process goes on without his ever knowing it consciously, but ignorance
of the law will excuse no one from its effects.

"What," someone will say, "do you think that I thought failure or wanted
to fail?" Of course not. You would be foolish to think that; but
according to the law which we cannot deny, you must have thought things
that would produce failure. Perhaps you thought that failure *might*
come, or in some other way you gave it entrance to your mind.

Thinking back over the reason for things, you will find that you are
surrounded by a mind, or law, that casts back at the thinker,
manifested, everything that he thinks. If this were not true, man would
not be an individual. Individuality can mean only the ability to think
what we *want* to think. If that thought is to have power in our lives
then there has to be something that will manifest it. Some are limited
and bound by law through ignorance. This law is sometimes called
"Karma," it is the law that binds the ignorant and gives freedom to the
wise.

We live in mind; and it can return to us only what we think into it. No
matter what we may do, law will always obtain. If we are thinking of
ourselves as poor and needy, then mind has no choice but to return what
we have thought into it. At first this may be hard to realize, but the
truth

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

will reveal to the seeker that law could act in no other way. Whatever
we think is the pattern, and mind is the builder. Jesus, realizing this
law, said, "It is done unto you even as you have believed." Shall we
doubt but that this great Way Shower knew what he was talking about? Did
He not say, "It is done unto you"? What a wonderful thought. "It is done
unto you." Nothing to worry about. "It is done unto you." With a
tremendous grasp of the power of true spiritual thought, Jesus even
called forth bread from the ethers of life, and at no time did He ever
fail to demonstrate that when one knows the truth he is freed by that
knowledge.
