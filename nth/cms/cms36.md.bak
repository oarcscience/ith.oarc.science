### HOW TO KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO.

OFTEN we find ourselves confronted by the problem of how to begin. We
are not sure what we want to do; we see no way to begin anything; see
nothing to begin on; when we find ourselves in this position, humanly
speaking, not knowing where to turn, then of all times we must be quiet
and listen; then of all times we must trust that the same power that
*started all things* will also *start us* in the right road, for without
some superior power we shall surely fail.

How often do people in the business world find themselves in this
position. They realize that something must be done, but what? How get
the idea to work out?

Here we must wait and know that the same power that first thought a
universe into being can also think our world and work into being. It
knows all things; it knows how to begin and it cannot fail; we wish in
some way to connect with this power that will never fail us, so

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

that we may draw from it some idea to begin with.

We must realize that there is something that wants to respond, to make
manifest and in this realization wait for the idea; it may not come at
first, but we must be patient, never doubting, and waiting thus in
faith, it *will* come.

I once knew a business man who was connected with a firm that had always
been very successful, but at that time something had occurred that was
causing them to lose out. This had gone on for a year and things were
going from bad to worse. Failure seemed inevitable. He became interested
in New Thought. He was told he could draw an idea from the Infinite and
work it out on the plane of the visible. He told his partners that he
wished to go home for a few days and that when he came back he would
have worked out an idea which would put the business on a successful
basis. They laughed at him, as people generally laugh at something they
do not understand, but having no other plan they gave their consent. He
went home and for three days sat in deep thought, claiming Supreme
guidance and absolute leading of the Spirit. During this time a complete
plan formulated in his mind as to the exact method to pursue in the
business. He returned and told his plan to his partners. Again they
laughed, saying it could not be done in business; could not be done any
way; it would not work. But again they consented, knowing it was this or
failure.

He then went to work carrying out all the details of his thought,
following each leading that had come to him during those three days, and
within a year he brought the failing business to a standard that
transcended anything they had ever before experienced, He proved the law
and

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

became such an expert, that he gave up his business and devoted his
entire time to helping other people do the same for themselves as he had
done.

What this man did any one can do if he will follow the same course and
refuse to become discouraged. There is a power that simply awaits our
recognition of it, to spring into our thought as an unfailing leading,
an unerring guidance. To those who lean on the ever outstretched arm of
the Infinite, life is big with limitless possibilities.

We must wait and listen, then go about our outer business with an inner
conviction that we are being led [into](errata.htm#2.md) a more perfect
expression of life. All can do this.
