### MORE ABOUT THE POWER OF ATTRACTION.

ALWAYS remember that Spirit makes things out of itself; it manifests in
the visible world by becoming the thing that it wills to become. In the
world of the individual the same process takes place. It is given to man
to use creative power, but with the using of this power comes the
necessity of using it as it is made to be used. If God makes things out
of His thought before they come into manifestation, then we must use the
same method.

You can attract only that which you first mentally become and feel
yourself to be in reality, without any doubting. A steady stream of
consciousness going out into creative mind will attract a steady
manifestation of conditions; a fluctuating stream of consciousness will
attract the corresponding manifestation or condition in your life. We
Host be consistent in our attitude of mind, never wavering. lames says,
"Ask in faith, nothing doubting, for he that doubteth is like a surge of
the sea driven by the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that
he shall receive anything of the Lord."

We are all immersed in an aura of our own thinking. This aura is the
direct result of all that we have ever said, thought or done; it decides
what is to take place in our life; it attracts what is like itself and
repels what is unlike itself. We are drawn towards those things that we
mentally embody. Most of the inner processes of thought have been
unconscious; but when we understand the law all that we have to do is to
embody consciously what we wish, and think of that only, and then we
shall be drawn silently toward it.

We have this law in our hands to do with as we will. We can draw what we
want only as we let go of the old order and take up the new; and this we
must do to the exclusion of all else. This is no weak man's job but an
undertaking for a strong, self-reliant soul; and the end is worth the
effort. The person who can hold his thought one-pointed is the one who
will obtain the best results.

But this does not imply the necessity of strain or anything of a
strenuous nature; on the contrary, strain is just what we must avoid.
When we know that there is but one power we shall not struggle, we shall
know, and in calmness we shall see only what we know must be the Truth.
This means a persistent, firm determination to think what we want to
think, regardless of all outer evidence to the contrary. We look not to
the seen but to the unseen. The king of Israel understood this when,
looking upon the advancing host of the enemy, he said, "We have no might
against this great company, but our eyes are upon Thee"--upon the One
Power.
