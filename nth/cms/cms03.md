### WHAT LIFE IS.

IN the first place, what do we mean by life? We mean that which we see,
feel, hear, touch or taste, and the reason for it. We must have come
into contact with all we know of life. We have already found what life
is or we could not have had any of these experiences. "In the beginning
was God" or life. Out of this life which is, everything which is is
made. So life must flow through

all things. There is no such thing as dead matter. Moreover, life is
one, and it cannot be changed except into itself. All forms are forms of
this unity and must come and go through some inner activity. This inner
activity of life or nature must be some form of self-consciousness or
self-knowing. In our human understanding we would call this inner
knowing, or consciousness, "thought." The Spirit, or Life, or God, must
make things out of Himself through self-recognition, or self-knowing or,
as we would call it thinking. Since God is all, there is nothing to
hinder Him from doing what He wishes, and the question, "How do things
come into being?" is answered: God makes them out of Himself. God
thinks, or knows, and that thing which He thinks or knows appears from
Himself, and is made out of Himself. There is no other possible
explanation for what we see. Unless people are willing to begin here,
they will never understand how it is that things are not material but
spiritual.
