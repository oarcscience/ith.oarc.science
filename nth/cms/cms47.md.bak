### PRESENCE OF ACTIVITY.

SUPPOSE that your place of business does not seem to manifest any
activity; that is, suppose that customers do not come. To the person in
the business world the presence of customers generally means activity.
Suppose that you have come to believe that the principle will work in
the smallest as well as in the greatest things. What you want now is a
greater activity. How are you going to see activity when there is none?

Here is a great question in Truth. Must we overlook that which we see,
and that which we have experienced? Yes, absolutely; there is no other
way. If we keep on seeing the thing as it appears we will never be able
to change its appearance. What we must do, then, in spite of the seeming
inactivity, is still to know and mentally to see and declare that we are
in the midst of activity. Feel this to be true; mentally see the place
crowded; know that it is packed full of customers all the time; declare
that your word draws them in; have no sense of strain about it whatever;
simply know that you are dealing with the only power that there is; it
will work; it must work. Realize when you have spoken the word that a
greater power has taken it up and that it is being established unto you.
Have no idea of limitation; speak forth into mind with perfect trust. If
you have the ability mentally to see the place full, combine this with
the word, and daily

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

visualize it as being filled. Always combine faith in the higher power
with all that you do; feel that you are being especially looked after.
This is true. When a soul turns to the Universe of unmanifest life, at
the same time It turns toward him. Jesus told this in the story of the
Prodigal Son; the Father saw him afar off. Always there is that inward
turning to us of the Parent Mind when we turn to It and place ourselves
in closer contact with Life.

We must keep our mind clear so that when the Spirit brings the gift we
will be open to receive it. Even God cannot force things upon us. We
must receive even before we see.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Always, when we
believe, we will have that belief honored of the Spirit of Life.
Mentally seeing just what we want; still seeing even though the heavens
fall, we shall succeed in proving that the law of life is a law of
liberty. God made man to have all that the Universe contained and then
left him alone to discover his own nature.

Stop all striving and all struggle and within your own soul know the
truth and trust absolutely in it. Daily declare that you are being
guided and protected and that the power of the Spirit is bringing all to
pass, and wait in perfect peace and confidence. Such an attitude of mind
will overcome anything and will prove that spiritual thought force is
the only real power in the Universe.
