### FOLLOWING UP A THOUGHT.

WHEN we feel that we do have the right leading; when that something
inside us tells us that we are led; then, no matter what it appears
like, we must follow it up. Something beyond our intelligence is doing
the thing through us and we must do nothing to contradict it.

Perhaps it will cause us to do something that seems to go contrary to
the experience of the race. This makes no difference. All advance in
invention and all advance along any line has always gone ahead of what
the experience of the race thinks is possible.

Great men are the ones who get a vision and then go to work to make it
come true, never looking to one side but with one-pointedness and calm
determination, stick to the thing until it is accomplished.

It may take much patience and a great deal of faith, but the end is as
sure as is the reality of a Supreme Being itself.

Never hesitate to trust in that inner leading, never fear but it will be
right. We are all in the midst of Supreme Intelligence; It presses
against the doors of our thought, waiting to be known. We must be open
to It at all times, ready to receive direction and to be guided into
greater truths.
