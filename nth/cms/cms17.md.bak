### WHERE SO MANY FAIL.

THE ordinary individual, sitting down to give a treatment to his
business, unconsciously does just the thing that he should have avoided;
and then he wonders why he did not get the desired results. Most people
simply sit and wish for, or long for, something. They may even have a
great desire or hope. They may even go so far as to believe that their
desire is going to happen. All this is good as far as it goes, but it
does not go far enough. What we must do is to provide that
already-having-received attitude. This may seem hard at first but we can
easily see that it is necessary; and as it is the only way that mind
works, this is what we must do.

Power is, and mind is, and life is; but they have to flow through us in
order to express in our lives. We are dealing with law; and nature must
be obeyed before it will work for us. Just realize that this law is as
natural a law as any other of God's laws, and use it with the same
intelligence that you would use the law of electricity; then you will
get the desired results. We provide the thought form around which the
divine energies play and to which they attract the conditions necessary
for the fulfillment of the though.

When we give a treatment this is all that we have to

do, but before we can do even this we have to clear our minds of all
fear, of every sense of separation from the Divine Mind. Law is; but we
must enforce it, or use it, in our own lives. Nothing can happen to us
that is not first an accepted belief in our own consciousness. We may
not always be aware of what is going on within, but practice will enable
us to control our thought more and more so that we shall be able to
think what we want to think, regardless of what may seem to be the case.

Each person has within himself the capacity of knowing and making use of
the law but it must be consciously developed. This is done by practice,
and by willingness to learn and to utilize whatever we know so far as we
have gone.

The individual who has the most power is the one who has the greatest
realization of the Divine Presence, and to whom this means the most as
an active principle of his life.

We all need more backbone and less wishbone. There is something which
waits only our recognition to spring into being, bringing with it all
the power in the universe.
