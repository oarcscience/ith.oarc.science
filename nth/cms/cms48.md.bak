### DRAWING YOUR OWN TO YOU.

SUPPOSE that you wish to draw friends and companions to you; that you
wish to enlarge your circle of friendships. This, too, can all be worked
out by law, for everything can be worked out by the same law, the reason
being that all is One and that the One becomes the many in expression.
There are too many people in the world who are lonesome because they
have a sense of separation from people. The thing to do is not to try to
unify with people, but *with the Principle of Life* behind all people
and things. This is working from the center and not the circumference;
in this One Mind are the minds of all people. When you unite your
thought with the whole you will be united with the parts of the whole.
The first thing to do, then, is to realize that Life is your friend and
companion; feel the divine companionship; feel that you are one with all
life; declare that, as this thought awakens within your mind, so does it
awaken within the mind of the whole race; feel that the world is being
drawn to you; love the world and everyone who is in it; include all, if
you would be included in all. The world seeks strength; be strong. The
world loves love; embody it; see the good in all people; let go of all
else. People will feel your love and will be drawn into it. Love is the
greatest power in the Universe; it is at the base of all else; it is the
cause of all that is. Feel your love to be like a great light lighting
the pathway of the whole world; it will come back to you bringing so
many friends that there will not be time enough to enjoy them all.
Become a real friend and you will have many friends.

Be sufficient unto yourself and at the same time include all else, and
people will feel your strength and will have a desire to come into the
radiance of it. Never become unhappy or morbid; always be cheerful and
radiate good nature and happiness; never look depressed or down in the
mouth; the world is attracted to the strongest center of cheer and good
fellowship. Never allow your feelings to be hurt. No one wants to hurt
you, and none could, even though they did want to; you are above all
that. Wherever you go know that the Spirit of Truth goes before and
prepares the way, bringing to you every friend and influence that will
be necessary to your comfort and well being. This is not selfishness but
good sense and will surely bring to you a harvest of friends and
companions.

Declare unto Mind that you are now linked with all people and that all
people are linked with you: see yourself surrounded with hosts of
friends; mentally feel their presence and rejoice that all good is yours
now. Do this no matter what seems to happen, and it will not be long
before you will meet wonderful friends and will be brought into touch
with the great of the world.
