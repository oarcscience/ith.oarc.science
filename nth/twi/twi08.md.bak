### THE SECRET, POWER, AND EFFECTS OF LOVE.

This is the Spirit of Infinite Love. The moment we recognize ourselves
as one with it we become so filled with love that we see only the good
in all. And when we realize that we are all one with this Infinite
Spirit, then we realize that in a sense we are all one with each other.
When we come into a recognition of this fact, we can then do no harm to
any one, to any thing. We find that we are all members of the one great
body, and that no portion of the body can be harmed without all the
other portions suffering thereby.

When we fully realize the great fact of the oneness of all life,—that
all are partakers from this one Infinite Source, and so that the same
life is the life in each individual, then prejudices go and hatreds
cease. Love grows and reigns supreme. Then, wherever we go, whenever we
come in contact with the fellowman, we are able to recognize the God
within. We thus look only for the good, and we find it. It always pays.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

There is a deep scientific fact underlying the great truth, "He that
takes the sword shall perish by the sword." The moment we come into a
realization of the subtle powers of the thought forces, we can quickly
see that the moment we entertain any thoughts of hatred toward another,
he gets the effects of these diabolical forces that go out from us, and
has the same thoughts of hatred aroused in him, which in turn return to
the sender. Then when we understand the effects of the passion, hatred
or anger, even upon the physical body, we can see how detrimental, how
expensive this is. The same is true in regard to all kindred thoughts or
passions, envy, criticism, jealousy, scorn. In the ultimate we shall
find that in entertaining feelings of this nature toward another, we
always suffer far more than the one toward whom we entertain them.

And then when we fully realize the fact that selfishness is at the root
of all error, sin, and crime, and that ignorance is the basis of all
selfishness, with what charity we come to look upon the acts of all. It
is the ignorant man who seeks his own ends at the expense of the greater
whole. It is the ignorant man, therefore, who is the selfish man. The
truly wise man is never selfish. He is a seer, and recognizes the fact
that he, a single member of the

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

one great body, is benefited in just the degree that the entire body is
benefited, and so he seeks nothing for himself that he would not equally
seek for all mankind.

If selfishness is at the bottom of all error, sin, and crime, and
ignorance is the basis of all selfishness, then when we see a
manifestation of either of these qualities, if we are true to the
highest within us, we will look for and will seek to call forth the good
in each individual with whom we come in contact. When God speaks to God,
then God responds, and shows forth as God. But when devil speaks to
devil, then devil responds, and the devil is always to pay.

I sometimes hear a person say, "I don't see any good in him." No? Then
you are no seer. Look deeper and you will find the very God in every
human soul. But remember it takes a God to recognize a God. Christ
always spoke to the highest, the truest, and the best in men. He knew
and he recognized the God in each because he had first realized it in
himself. He ate with publicans and sinners. Abominable, the Scribes and
Pharisees said. They were so wrapped up in their own conceits, their own
self-centredness, hence their own ignorance, that they had never found
the God in themselves, and so they never dreamed that it was the real
life of even publicans and sinners.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

In the degree that we hold a person in the thought of evil or of error,
do we suggest evil and error to him. In the degree that he is
sensitively organized, or not well individualized, and so, subject to
the suggestions of the thought forces from others, will he be
influenced; and so in this way we may be sharers in the very evildoing
in which we hold another in thought. In the same way when we hold a
person in the thought of the right, the good, and the true,
righteousness, goodness, and truth are suggested to him, and thus we
have a most beneficent influence on his life and conduct. If our hearts
go out in love to all with whom we come in contact, we inspire love, and
the same ennobling and warming influences of love always return to us
from those in whom we inspire them. There is a deep scientific principle
underlying the precept—If you would have all the world love you, you
must first love all the world.

In the degree that we love will we be loved. Thoughts are forces. Each
creates of its kind. Each comes back laden with the effect that
corresponds to itself and of which it is the cause.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Then let your secret thoughts be fair—  
 They have a vital part, and share  
 In shaping words and moulding fate;  
 God's system is so intricate."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

I know of no better practice than that of a friend who continually holds
himself in an attitude of mind that he continually sends out his love in
the form of the thought,—"Dear everybody, I love you." And when we
realize the fact that a thought invariably produces its effect before it
returns, or before it ceases, we can see how he is continually breathing
out a blessing not only upon all with whom he comes in contact, but upon
all the world. These same thoughts of love, moreover, tokened in various
ways, are continually coming to him from all quarters.

Even animals feel the effects of these forces. Some animals are much
more sensitively organized than many people are, and consequently they
get the effects of our thoughts, our mental states, and emotions much
more readily than many people do. Therefore whenever we meet an animal
we can do it good by sending out to it these thoughts of love. It will
feel the effects whether we simply entertain or whether we voice them.
And it is often interesting to note how quickly it responds, and how
readily it gives evidence of its appreciation of this love and
consideration on our part.

What a privilege and how enjoyable it would be to live and walk in a
world where we meet

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

only Gods. In such a world you can live. In such a world I can live. For
in the degree that we come into this higher realization do we see only
the God in each human soul; and when we are thus able to see Him in
every one we meet, we then live in such a world.

And when we thus recognize the God in every one, we by this recognition
help to call it forth ever more and more. What a privilege,—this
privilege of yours, this privilege of mine! That hypocritical judging of
another is something then with which we can have nothing to do; for we
have the power of looking beyond the evolving, changing, error-making
self, and seeing the real, the changeless, the eternal self which by and
by will show forth in the full beauty of holiness. We are then large
enough also to realize the fact that when we condemn another, by that
very act we condemn ourselves.

This realization so fills us with love that we continually overflow it,
and all with whom we come in contact feel its warming and life-giving
power. These in turn send back the same feelings of love to us, and so
we continually attract love from all quarters. Tell me how much one
loves and I will tell you how much he has seen of God. Tell me how much
he loves and I will tell you how much he lives with God. Tell me

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

how much he loves and I will tell you how far into the Kingdom of
Heaven,—the kingdom of harmony, he has entered, for "love is the
fulfilling of the law."

And in a sense love is everything. It is the key to life, and its
influences are those that move the world. Live only in the thought of
love for all and you will draw love to you from all. Live in the thought
of malice or hatred, and malice and hatred will come back to you.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For evil poisons; malice shafts  
  Like boomerangs return,  
 Inflicting wounds that will not heal  
  While rage and anger burn."</span>

</div>

Every thought you entertain is a force that goes out, and every thought
comes back laden with its kind. This is an immutable law. Every thought
you entertain has moreover a direct effect upon your body. Love and its
kindred emotions are the normal and the natural, those in accordance
with the eternal order of the universe, for "God is love." These have a
life-giving, health-engendering influence upon your body, besides
beautifying your countenance, enriching your voice, and making you ever
more attractive in every way. And as it is true that in the degree that
you hold thoughts of love for

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

all, you call the same from them in return, and as these have a direct
effect upon your mind, and through your mind upon your body, it is as so
much life force added to your own from without. You are then continually
building this into both your mental and your physical life, and so your
life is enriched by its influence.

Hatred and all its kindred emotions are the unnatural, the abnormal, the
perversions, and so, out of harmony with the eternal order of the
universe. For if love is the fulfilling of the law, then these, its
opposites, are direct violations of law, and there can never be a
violation of law without its attendant pain and suffering in one form or
another. There is no escape from this. And what is the result of this
particular form of violation? When you allow thoughts of anger, hatred,
malice, jealousy, envy, criticism, or scorn to exercise sway, they have
a corroding and poisoning effect upon the organism; they pull it down,
and if allowed to continue will eventually tear it to pieces by
externalizing themselves in the particular forms of disease they give
rise to. And then in addition to the destructive influences from your
own mind you are continually calling the same influences from other
minds, and these come as destructive forces augmenting your own, thus
aiding in the tearing down process.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

And so love inspires love; hatred breeds hatred. Love and good will
stimulate and build up the body; hatred and malice corrode and tear it
down. Love is a savor of life unto life; hatred is a savor of death unto
death.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"There are loyal hearts, there are spirits brave,  
  There are souls that are pure and true;  
 Then give to the world the best you have,  
  And the best will come back to you.

"Give love, and love to *your* heart will flow,  
  A strength in your utmost need;  
 Have faith, and a score of hearts will show  
  Their faith in *your* word and deed."

</div>

I hear it said,—How in regard to one who bears me hatred, towards whom I
have entertained no such thoughts and feelings, and so have not been the
cause of his becoming my enemy? This may be true, but the chances are
that you will have but few enemies if there is nothing of an
antagonistic nature in your own mind and heart. Be sure there is nothing
of this nature. But if hatred should come from another without apparent
cause on your part, then meet it from first to last with thoughts of
love and good-will. In this way you can, so to speak, so neutralize its
effects that it cannot reach you and so cannot harm you. Love is

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

positive, and stronger than hatred. Hatred can always be conquered by
love.

On the other hand, if you meet hatred with hatred, you simply intensify
it. You add fuel to the flame already kindled, upon which it will feed
and grow, and so you increase and intensify the evil conditions. Nothing
is to be gained by it, everything is to be lost. By sending love for
hatred you will be able so to neutralize it that it will not only have
no effect upon you, but will not be able even to reach you. But more
than this, you will by this course sooner or later be able literally to
transmute the enemy into the friend. Meet hatred with hatred and you
degrade yourself. Meet hatred with love and you elevate not only
yourself but also the one who bears you hatred.

The Persian sage has said, "Always meet petulance with gentleness, and
perverseness with kindness. A gentle hand can lead even an elephant by a
hair. Reply to thine enemy with gentleness. Opposition to peace is sin."
The Buddhist says, "If a man foolishly does me wrong I will return him
the protection of my ungrudging love. The more evil comes from him, the
more good shall go from me." "The wise man avenges injuries by
benefits," says the

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Chinese. "Return
good for evil, overcome anger by love; hatred never ceases by hatred,
but by love," says the Hindu.

The truly wise man or woman will recognize no one as an enemy.
Occasionally we hear the expression, "Never mind; I'll get even with
him." Will you? And how will you do it? You can do it in one of two
ways. You can, as you have in mind, deal with him as he deals, or
apparently deals, with you,—pay him, as we say, in his own coin. If you
do this you will get even with him by sinking yourself to his level, and
both of you will suffer by it. Or, you can show yourself the larger, you
can send him love for hatred, kindness for ill-treatment, and so get
even with him by raising him to the higher level. But remember that you
can never help another without by that very act helping yourself; and if
forgetful of self, then in most all cases the value to you is greater
than the service you render another. If you are ready to treat him as he
treats you, then you show clearly that there is in you that which draws
the hatred and ill-treatment to you; you deserve what you are getting
and should not complain, nor would you complain if you were wise. By
following the other course you most effectually accomplish your
purpose,—you gain a

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

victory for yourself, and at the same time you do a great service for
him, for which it is evident he stands greatly in need.

Thus you may become his saviour. He in turn may become the saviour of
other error-making, and consequently care-encumbered men and women. Many
times the struggles are greater than we can ever know. We need more
gentleness and sympathy and compassion in our common human life. Then we
will neither blame nor condemn. Instead of blaming or condemning we will
sympathize, and all the more we will

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    "Comfort one another,  
For the way is often dreary,  
And the feet are often weary,  
 And the heart is very sad.  
There is a heavy burden bearing,  
When it seems that none are caring,  
 And we half forget that ever we were glad.

    "Comfort one another  
With the hand-clasp close and tender,  
With the sweetness love can render,  
 And the looks of friendly eyes.  
Do not wait with grace unspoken,  
While life's daily bread is broken  
 Gentle speech is oft like manna from the skies."

</div>

When we come fully to realize the great fact that all evil and error and
sin with all their consequent

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

sufferings come through ignorance, then wherever we see a manifestation
of these in whatever form, if our hearts are right, we will have
compassion, sympathy and compassion for the one in whom we see them.
Compassion will then change itself into love, and love will manifest
itself in kindly service. Such is the divine method. And so instead of
aiding in trampling and keeping a weaker one down, we will hold him up
until he can stand alone and become the master. But all life-growth is
from within out, and one becomes a true master in the degree that the
knowledge of the divinity of his own nature dawns upon his inner
consciousness and so brings him to a knowledge of the higher laws; and
in no way can we so effectually hasten this dawning in the inner
consciousness of another, as by showing forth the divinity within
ourselves simply by the way we live.

By example and not by precept. By living, not by preaching. By doing,
not by professing. By living the life, not by dogmatizing as to how it
should be lived. There is no contagion equal to the contagion of life.
Whatever we sow, that shall we also reap, and each thing sown produces
of its kind. We can kill not only by doing another bodily injury
directly, but we can and we do kill by every antagonistic thought

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Not only do we
thus kill, but while we kill we suicide. Many a man has been made sick
by having the ill thoughts of a number of people centred upon him; some
have been actually killed. Put hatred into the world and we make it a
literal hell. Put love into the world and heaven with all its beauties
and glories becomes a reality.

Not to love is not to live, or it is to live a living death. The life
that goes out in love to all is the life that is full, and rich, and
continually expanding in beauty and in power. Such is the life that
becomes ever more inclusive, and hence larger in its scope and
influence. The larger the man and the woman, the more inclusive they are
in their love and their friendships. The smaller the man and the woman,
the more dwarfed and dwindling their natures, the more they pride
themselves upon their "exclusiveness." Any one—a fool or an idiot—can be
exclusive. It comes easy. It takes and it signifies a large nature to be
universal, to be inclusive. Only the man or the woman of a small,
personal, self-centred, self-seeking nature is exclusive. The man or the
woman of a large, royal, unself-centred nature never is. The small
nature is the one that continually strives for effect. The larger nature
never does. The

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

one goes here and there in order to gain recognition, in order to attach
himself to the world. The other stays at home and draws the world *to
him*. The one loves merely himself. The other loves all the world; but
in his larger love for all the world he finds himself included.

Verily, then, the more one loves the nearer he approaches to God, for
God is the spirit of infinite love. And when we come into the
realization of our oneness with this Infinite Spirit, then divine love
so fills us that, enriching and enrapturing our own lives, from them it
flows out to enrich the life of all the world.

In coming into the realization of our oneness with the Infinite Life, we
are brought at once into right relations with our fellowmen. We are
brought into harmony with the great law, that we find our own lives in
losing them in the service of others. We are brought to a knowledge of
the fact that all life is one, and so that we are all parts of the one
great whole. We then realize that we can't do for another without at the
same time doing for ourselves. We also realize that we cannot do harm to
another without by that very act doing harm to ourselves. We realize
that the man who lives to himself alone lives a little, dwarfed, and
stunted life, because he has no part in this larger life of

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

humanity. But the one who in service loses his own life in this larger
life, has his own life increased and enriched a thousand or a million
fold, and every joy, every happiness, everything of value coming to each
member of this greater whole comes as such to him, for he has a part in
the life of each and all.

And here let a word be said in regard to true service. Peter and John
were one day going up to the temple, and as they were entering the gate
they were met by a poor cripple who asked them for alms. Instead of
giving him something to supply the day's needs and then leaving him in
the same dependent condition for the morrow and the morrow, Peter did
him a real service, and a real service for all mankind by saying, Silver
and gold have I none, but such as I have I give unto thee. *And then he
made him whole*. He thus brought him into the condition where he could
help himself. In other words, the greatest service we can do for another
is to help him to help himself. To help him directly might be weakening,
though not necessarily. It depends entirely upon circumstances. But to
help one to help himself is never weakening, but always encouraging and
strengthening, because it leads him to a larger and stronger life.

There is no better way to help one to help

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

himself than to bring him to a knowledge of himself. There is no better
way to bring one to a knowledge of himself than to lead him to a
knowledge of the powers that are lying dormant within his own soul.
There is nothing that will enable him to come more readily or more
completely into an awakened knowledge of the powers that are lying
dormant within his own soul, than to bring him into the conscious, vital
realization of his oneness with the Infinite Life and Power, so that he
may open himself to it in order that it may work and manifest through
him.

We will find that these same great truths lie at the very bottom of the
solution of our social situation; and we will also find that we will
never have a full and permanent solution of it until they are fully
recognized and built upon.
