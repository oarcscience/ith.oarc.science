# FULLNESS OF

# PEACE, POWER, AND PLENTY.

### PRELUDE.

The optimist is right. The pessimist is right. The one differs from the
other as the light from the dark. Yet both are right. Each is right from
his own particular point of view, and this point of view is the
determining factor in the life of each. It determines as to whether it
is a life of power or of impotence, of peace or of pain, of success or
of failure.

The optimist has the power of seeing things in their entirety and in
their right relations. The pessimist looks from a limited and a
one-sided point of view. The one has his understanding illumined by
wisdom, the understanding of the other is darkened by ignorance. Each is
building his world from within, and the result of the building is
determined by the point of view of each. The optimist, by his superior
wisdom and insight, is making his own heaven, and in the degree that he
makes his own heaven is he helping

to make one for all the world beside. The pessimist, by virtue of his
limitations, is making his own hell, and in the degree that he makes his
own hell is he helping to make one for all mankind.

You and I have the predominating characteristics of an optimist or the
predominating characteristics of a pessimist. We then are making, hour
by hour, our own heaven or our own hell; and in the degree that we are
making the one or the other for ourselves are we helping make it for all
the world beside.

The word heaven means harmony. The word *hell* is from the old English
hell, meaning to build a wall around, to separate; to be *helled* was to
be shut off from. Now if there is such a thing as harmony there must be
that something one can be in right relations with; for to be in right
relations with anything is to be in harmony with it. Again, if there is
such a thing as being *helled*, shut off, separated from, there must be
that something from which one is held, shut off, or separated.
