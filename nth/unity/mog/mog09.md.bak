###  Chapter VII The Fruits of Faith Genesis 19, 20, 21, and 22 

IN THE PRECEDING chapter we read that when Jehovah appeared to Abraham
the patriarch was sitting in the door of his tent. There is a remarkable
parallel here, for Jehovah appeared to Lot as he sat in the gate of
Sodom.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 19:1-11. And the two angels came to Sodom at
even; and  
Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up  
to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the  
earth; and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I  
pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night,  
and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on  
your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the  
street all night. And he urged them greatly; and they  
turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made  
them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did  
eat. But before they lay down, the men of the city, even  
the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and  
old, all the people from every quarter; and they called  
unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in  
to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may  
know them. And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut  
the door after him. And he said, I pray you, my brethren,  
do not so wickedly. Behold now, I have two daughters that  
have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto  
you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto  
these men do nothing, forasmuch as  
</span>

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

they are come under the shadow of my roof. And they said,  
Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to  
sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal  
worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon  
the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door. But the  
men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to  
them, and shut to the door. And they smote the men that  
were at the door of the house with blindness, both small  
and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.  

</div>

As Abraham represents the positive side of faith and Lot the negative
side, it can also be said that Abraham represents the spiritual
consciousness and that Lot is the natural consciousness, which however
is turned toward the light. Jehovah appeared to Abraham as three.
Spiritual consciousness understands the trinity of being that is spirit,
soul, and body. Lot saw Jehovah as two angels, which shows that the
natural mind leaves Spirit out of consideration.

When Abraham invited the three into his tent they accepted his
hospitality without comment. But when Lot asked the two to spend the
night under his roof, wash their feet, and partake of his food, they
refused. It took persistent urging on the part of Lot to persuade them
to abide with him.

When the unfolding nature (Lot) begins to entertain higher spiritual
thoughts (angels), all the evil and degenerate thoughts (men of Sodom)
come at once and "compass the house." They demand that the higher
thoughts be put out, or that they be admitted (into mind) to throw them
out. When the demand is refused they become violent. Man's way is to
compromise with evil thoughts by giving to them

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

his love and emotion, even if he does not allow them free expression in
his mind. Lot offered his daughters to the men of Sodom. When carnal
thoughts become strong and numerous enough (compass the house) they
assert complete mastery over the individual and tell him: "Stand back .
. . This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge."

The angels (high spiritual thoughts) whom Lot induced to enter his
house, came to his rescue. They struck the men of Sodom (carnal
thoughts) with blindness so that they were thrown into confusion and
their destructive efforts rendered futile, at least for the time being:
blind passions that stop at nothing to gain their ends must be
annihilated.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 19:12-23. And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou
here  
any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters,  
and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the  
place: for we will destroy this place, because the cry of  
them is waxed great before Jehovah; and Jehovah hath sent  
us to destroy it. And Lot went out, and spake unto his  
sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Up, get  
you out of this place; for Jehovah will destroy the city.  
But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that mocked. And  
when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,  
saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that  
are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the  
city. But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand,  
and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two  
daughters, Jehovah being merciful unto him: and they  
brought him forth, and set him without the city. And it  
came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that  
he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither  
stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest  
thou be consumed.  
</span>

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord: behold now,  
thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast  
magnified thy lovingkindness, which thou hast showed unto  
me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain,  
lest evil overtake me, and I die: behold now, this city is  
near to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape  
thither (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live.  
And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning  
this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of  
which thou hast spoken. Haste thee, escape thither; for I  
cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the  
name of the city was called Zoar. The sun was risen upon  
the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.  

</div>

Jehovah's promise to Abraham was that He would save the righteous. Here
Jehovah's angels invited Lot to take with him those of his household
(thought people) who were ready to advance spiritually. Only Lot, his
wife, and his two virgin daughters were prepared to take the step.
However after the Lord had delivered them outside the walls of the city
Lot (negative faith) was afraid to attempt flight to the mountain (high
state of consciousness). He knew he was not fully prepared for such a
step. The angels consented to let him escape to the little city of Zoar,
the name of which means "reduced," "made small," "lessened." Thus Lot
was given opportunity to open his mind to the light to such a degree
that seeming negation was minimized in consciousness, and he was blessed
with a new understanding of Truth. ("The sun was risen upon the earth
when Lot came unto Zoar.")

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 19:24-26. Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and
upon  
Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven; and  
he overthrew those  
</span>

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the  
cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife  
looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of  
salt.  

</div>

Eventually all error must be wiped out of consciousness. In our efforts
to overcome the sins of the flesh we pass through strange experiences,
and wonderful revelations come to those of us who conform to divine law.
The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire represents a mighty
purifying process that makes man ready for a great realization of divine
life.

Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt. Salt is a preservative,
corresponding to memory. When we remember the pleasures of the senses
and long for their return, we preserve the sense desire. This desire
will manifest itself sometime, somewhere, unless the memory is dissolved
through renunciation.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 19:27-29. And Abraham got up early in the
morning to  
the place where he had stood before Jehovah: and he looked  
toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the  
Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up  
as the smoke of a furnace.  
And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the  
Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the  
midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in  
which Lot dwelt.  
</span>

</div>

The above Scripture means that after a degree of cleansing or
destruction of sense we mentally review our experiences and recognize
that nothing is really destroyed but rather transmuted (Abraham beheld
the result). Through faith we take stock of the progress we have made
and find that we are getting a consciousness of radiant substance
(smoke) and of a

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

higher life (heat). Nothing is lost. When sense consciousness is raised
to a higher plane all that belongs to it is saved with it. This is
represented by Jehovah's saving Lot's life.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 19:30-38. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and
dwelt in  
the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared  
to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two  
daughters. And the first-born said unto the younger, Our  
father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come  
in unto us after the manner of all the earth: come, let us  
make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that  
we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their  
father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in,  
and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down,  
nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that  
the first-born said unto the younger, Behold, I lay  
yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this  
night also, and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may  
preserve seed of our father. And they made their father  
drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay  
with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she  
arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by  
their father. And the first-born bare a son and called his  
name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this  
day. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his  
name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of  
Ammon unto this day.  
</span>

</div>

When the soul reaches a certain stage of unfoldment the natural
progressive quality of faith shows a tendency toward spiritual growth.
Lot here represents natural faith in a state of evolution, yet his
living in a cave in the mountain denotes that this faith is still in the
clutches of materiality. The feminine forces of

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

faith (daughters of Lot) reflect the parent desire for continued
perpetuation of their line. There was no other masculine principle on
the plane of consciousness on which these feminine forces were
functioning ("there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after
the manner of all the earth"). Through stimulating life (wine) the seed
idea was implanted by the father principle (Lot) in receptive soil and
brought forth fruit.

Moab, son of Lot's eldest daughter, represents the thought that
perpetuates body consciousness. It is found in the idea of organized
substance ("flowing from the father") but it is impregnated with the
lusts of the flesh. Referring to the Moabites, Jeremiah says, "Cursed be
he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently." So Moab represents one
phase of the lusts of carnal mind for expression through the flesh.
While Moab pertains to the body and the most external conditions of
life, there is something good in him, or at least a possibility of good.

Ben-ammi, the name of the son of Lot's youngest daughter and father of
the Ammonites, means "son of my people," "son of my kindred," "son of my
tribe," which points to segregation and personal selfishness. This
thought is the source of the clan, then the nation. When this egotism is
exalted the nation looks on itself as being superior to all other
nations and proceeds to compel them to acknowledge this superiority by
force of arms. The Ammonites waged constant war against the Israelites
but were eventually defeated.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 20:1. And Abraham journeyed from thence toward
the  
land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and  
he sojourned in Gerar.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

The name Shur means "going round about," "wall," "fortification," "ox."
Shur represents the never-ceasing progress, unfoldment, and development
of man. In his evolution man has apparently always moved in cycles; but
each time he comes again to his starting place he seems to be a little
in advance of his former state. When he begins to awaken spiritually his
progress is more rapid. There is also a thought of strength and might
("wall," "ox").

The name Kadesh means "pure," "bright," "holy," "sacred." Kadesh
represents the inherently pure, sinless, perfect, ideal state in the
depths of the consciousness of every individual.

Abraham "dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar."
Gerar symbolizes subjective substance and life. Abraham had on one hand
Kadesh --the inherently pure, sinless, ideal state--and on the other
hand Shut (unceasing progress) while he had his existence in Gerar
(substance and life). Thus does faith (typified by Abraham) develop in
the spiritually awakening individual.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 20:2-13. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife,
She is my  
sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.  
But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said  
to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the  
woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. Now  
Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt  
thou slay even a righteous nation? Said he not himself unto  
me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is  
my brother: in the integrity of my heart and the innocency  
of my hands have I done this. And God said unto him in the  
dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou  
hast  
</span>

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against  
me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. Now  
therefore restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and  
he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou  
restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die,  
thou, and all that are thine.  
And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his  
servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the  
men were sore afraid. Then Abimelech called Abraham, and  
said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and wherein  
have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me  
and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me  
that ought not to be done. And Abimelech said unto Abraham,  
What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? And  
Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is  
not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's  
sake. And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of  
my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she  
became my wife: and it came to pass, when God caused me to  
wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This  
is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me: at every  
place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.  

</div>

If spiritual faith through the affectional side of one's nature (Sarah)
makes union with the controlling unregenerate will in the subconscious
(Abimelech) there is a reversal of the progressive law and bodily ills
(the plagues of Egypt) are brought forth, as we noted with reference to
a previous experience of Abraham. (See interpretation of Gen. 12:10-20.)
However in an instance like this, when faith, lacking understanding,
would have repeated the error, the soul has progressed until the
subconsciousness has come under the guidance of Spirit, and the plagues
that came as a result

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

of a former mistake are not repeated on this occasion.

Abimelech (unregenerate will) was quickened to the point where he could
receive instruction through dreams. Spirit revealed to Abimelech the
true relationship between Abraham and Sarah, and thus he was saved from
making an unlawful union.

When Abimelech (will) faced Abraham (pioneering faith) with the fact,
Abraham admitted that he had lost sight of the possibilities of the
divine omnipresence and was not aware that the all-knowing Spirit could
penetrate into every consciousness. "Because I thought, Surely the fear
of God is not in this place." Abraham and Sarah were of the same blood
and therefore he said truly, "She is my sister."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 20:14-18. And Abimelech took sheep and oxen,
and  
men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto  
Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. And Abimelech  
said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it  
pleaseth thee. And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given  
thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, it is for  
thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee; and  
in respect of all thou art righted. And Abraham prayed unto  
God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his  
maid-servants; and they bare children. For Jehovah had fast  
closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because  
of Sarah, Abraham's wife.  
</span>

</div>

This is a situation where there is apt to be contention between the soul
and the body consciousness unless adjustment is made. Pioneering faith
(Abraham) in union with the spiritual soul (Sarah) issues in a high
realization of both soul and body. It is only the highest emanation of
body consciousness that is ready for

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

transmutation, consequently there needs to be an equalizing and
adjusting power to establish peace and safety in the body consciousness
in order to avoid some form of plague. To teach this truth Abimelech
(the ruling power that controls the substance side of man's being), his
wife, and maidservants are represented as being unproductive for a
season, but as being healed through faith (Abraham interceded with God).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 21:1-7. And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had
said, and  
Jehovah did unto Sarah as he had spoken. And Sarah  
conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the  
set time of which God had spoken to him. And Abraham called  
the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare  
to him, Isaac. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when  
he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. And  
Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was  
born unto him. And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh;  
every one that heareth will laugh with me. And she said,  
Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give  
children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.  
</span>

</div>

Isaac was born after Abraham and Sarah were both past the age of
bringing forth. So we when born of the Spirit through faith are born not
"of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." The
natural man has no power to bring forth the "new man" in Christ Jesus.
The natural man brings forth Hagar's son, who is not the chosen heir.
The new man is a "new creature," begotten not of the flesh but of the
divine word. This begetting represents the forming of a new state of
consciousness, the consciousness referred to by

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

Paul when he expressed the hope to the Galatians that "Christ be formed"
in them.

As one gains a certain inner satisfaction from doing a good deed, so in
repeatedly following the promptings of Spirit one accumulates a fund of
satisfaction that finally breaks forth in laughter. Isaac was not born
until Abraham and Sarah had reached old age--had accumulated a "faith
consciousness." Note the different kinds of laughter in this allegory.
Abraham laughed questioningly, hopefully, when it was announced that
Sarah would bear a son. Sarah laughed incredulously when the promise was
announced to her. Both Abraham and Sarah, with their friends, laughed
joyfully and thankfully when Isaac was born.

Religion is not the dolorous thing that many have pictured it, much to
its loss and to ours as well. On the contrary religion should make man
joyful. God is not to be served in the spirit of bondage to a taskmaster
but in the spirit of happiness. In Deuteronomy we read: "Because thou
servedst not Jehovah thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of
heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; therefore shalt thou
serve thine enemies . . . in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
and in want of all things." If one's prayers are not answered or one
fails to demonstrate the reason may perhaps be found here.

Those who persistently exercise faith in God find there is generated in
their mind a condition that gradually grows into a conviction of the
permanent presence of divine substance within, and this gives rise to
the most exquisite joy. Inward ecstasy is what gives the countenance of
peace to the saint and of illumination and purity to the sister of
mercy. It is experienced by

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

all who pass into the second degree of faith (Isaac, son of Abraham).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 21:8-21. And the child grew, and was weaned:
and  
Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was  
weaned. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom  
she had borne unto Abraham, mocking. Wherefore she said  
unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son: for the  
son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even  
with Isaac. And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's  
sight on account of his son. And God said unto Abraham, Let  
it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and  
because of thy handmaid; in all that Sarah saith unto thee,  
hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be  
called. And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a  
nation, because he is thy seed. And Abraham rose up early  
in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and  
gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and gave  
her the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and  
wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. And the water in  
the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of  
the shrubs. And she went, and sat her down over against him  
a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me  
not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over  
against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. And God  
heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to  
Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee,  
Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad  
where he is. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy  
hand; for I will make him a great nation. And God opened  
her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and  
filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. And  
God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the  
wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer. And he  
dwelt in the wilderness  
</span>

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of  
Egypt.  

</div>

When Isaac was weaned (symbolizing his readiness to take a forward step
in soul responsibility) Ishmael, Hagar's son, mocked him. Such mockery
is the experience of everyone in the new birth. The thoughts that are
the fruit of the mind of flesh rise up within him and mock the new man.
Here the overcomer has a definite work to do. The animal soul (Hagar,
the bondmaid) and the natural desires (her son) must be cast out. As
Abraham grieved when Hagar was banished, so we sometimes grieve at
giving up the fruits of material thinking brought forth by the natural
man.

In the development of spiritual faculties, of which faith (Abraham) is
one, there is an ascending movement of the consciousness that is felt
and understood by the individual having the experience but that is
difficult to explain to one who has not yet entered upon that plane of
development. The faculty of faith grows stronger with each trial, and
when it is obedient to the Lord as its divine guide, it finds an added
pleasure in the exercise of both mind and body at every upward step.
Each function of man's organism is spiritual at its foundation, and when
he exercises it as intended by Divine Mind his every breath and every
heartbeat is a song of joy. Even the most earthly functions may be
spiritualized and become sources of unending pleasure, while when they
are under the control of the animal mind of man they become demoralizers
of the body. Under divine guidance the retrogression produced by mere
animalism may be harmonized and purified through the descent of the
fires of Spirit. This is what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah, which
represent

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

the desires and activities pertaining to generation.

When we have faith in God and the ways of Spirit, we are willing to give
up all our material pleasures if such be the instruction of the inner
guide. This giving up is symbolized by the sacrifices so often referred
to in the history of the Children of Israel. The body and its vital
forces are in perpetual action, which is progressive under the divine
law. When the law is disregarded there is a waning of the higher forces
that brings a sense of discomfort. It is frequently through pain that we
are brought to see the error of our ways. Then we should hasten to find
the law of being that will give real satisfaction without inharmony.

The action of Abraham is an example of this practice. After giving up
animal gratification and purifying the mind of sense thoughts (banishing
Hagar and Ishmael), he experienced a greater pleasure from a more
interior or spiritual action of the same function. Isaac was the
fulfillment of Abraham's greatest desire. But the use of the natural
functions must also be raised to a higher plane. On each of the
ascending stages in bodily transmutation there is a residuum of the last
preceding stage remaining in consciousness. This too must be purified so
that the whole man may be a fit temple for the Holy Spirit.

The seemingly inhuman treatment of Hagar and Ishmael by Abraham and
Sarah is symbolical of the activity of forces at work in the soul of
man. The natural soul (Hagar), lacking real understanding of the newly
awakened spiritual soul (Sarah), looks on it with a jealous and
antagonistic eye. The product of the thoughts of the natural man at work
in the flesh (Ishmael) reflects the natural soul's attitude and

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

scoffs at the possibility of joy brought about through mere pleasure in
spiritual life. Such an attitude brings about a separation between the
spiritual state of consciousness and the natural state that depletes the
supply on the natural plane.

The wilderness of Beer-sheba represents in individual consciousness the
multitude of undisciplined and uncultivated thoughts. Even in this state
of mind a person can hear the voice of God. God spoke to Hagar, which
opened her eyes to the truth that the well of living water was close by
and that she and her son would be amply sustained and prospered.

This tells us that even the outermost part of man (the body) is to be
saved and to be given the chance to unfold and become efficient in all
its activities.

Ishmael became an archer, which indicates that he was an expert at
hitting the mark. Later he left Beer-sheba and "dwelt in the wilderness
of Paran." The name Paran means "region of caverns," "region of
searching," "place of much digging." Paran represents the multitude of
seemingly confused and undisciplined thoughts of the subconscious mind;
also a place or period of much earnest searching after Truth. That "his
mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt" means that Ishmael
(fruits of the flesh) through Hagar (the natural soul) unites with the
feminine force of materiality.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 21:22-34. And it came to pass at that time,
that  
Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto  
Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:  
now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not  
deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's  
son: but according  
</span>

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do  
unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. And  
Abraham said, I will swear. And Abraham reproved Abimelech  
because of the well of water, which Abimelech's servants  
had violently taken away. And Abimelech said, I know not  
who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me,  
neither yet heard I of it, but today. And Abraham took  
sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two  
made a covenant. And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the  
flock by themselves. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What  
mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by  
themselves? And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou  
take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I  
have digged this well. Wherefore he called that place  
Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them. So they  
made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and  
Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the  
land of the Philistines. And Abraham planted a tamarisk  
tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of  
Jehovah, the Everlasting God. And Abraham sojourned in the  
land of the Philistines many days.  

</div>

The name Phicol means "spokesman for all," "all-commanding," "every
tongue." Phicol was the captain of the host of Abimelech and represents
the seeming all-sufficiency of sense consciousness in man at a certain
stage of his evolution. He was a Philistine, a Philistine denoting sense
consciousness.

The name Beer-sheba means "well of the oath," "well of fulfillment,"
"well of the seven." Abraham represents the first activity of the faith
faculty in man's consciousness. Abimelech represents the will, which
though unregenerate at this stage of man's unfoldment, recognizes faith
and its attainments (Abraham

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

and his possessions). Abimelech fears that he and his kingdom will be
overrun by Abraham and his everincreasing family and household. On the
other hand, Abimelech's servants take by force the well that Abraham had
dug. This latter means that the life forces, which have been discovered
and laid hold of by faith's activity, have been utilized and corrupted
by the fleshly man instead of being retained for the use of the mental
and spiritual. The covenant between Abraham and Abimelech denotes the
establishing of a right relation in consciousness between the spiritual
and so-called material. Beer-sheba represents the establishing of this
agreement ("well of the oath") between the inner and the outer, wherein
faith and its adherents (higher thoughts) are given ample room in the
organism and are allowed to retain possession of the well (reservoir of
life) that they have been instrumental in bringing to light. On the
other hand, the higher thoughts of faith realize that they must not harm
or destroy the outer man (Abimelech and his kingdom).

To swear by the seven is to covenant that the thing promised will be
fulfilled, the number seven representing fulfillment of the natural law.

<span class="small">Gen. 22:1-18. And it came to pass after these
things, that  
God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham; and he  
said, Here am I. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only  
son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the  
land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering  
upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. And  
Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and  
took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and  
he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and  
went unto the  
</span>

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

place of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham  
lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. And Abraham  
said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I  
and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come  
again to you. And Abraham took the wood of the  
burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took  
in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of  
them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and  
said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he  
said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb  
for a burnt-offering? And Abraham said, God will provide  
himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son: so they went  
both of them together.  
And they came to the place which God had told them of; and  
Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order,  
and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon  
the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took  
the knife to slay his son. And the angel of Jehovah called  
unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he  
said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the  
lad, neither do thou anything unto him; for now I know that  
thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son,  
thine only son, from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes,  
and looked, and, behold, behind him a ram caught in the  
thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram,  
and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his  
son. And Abraham called the name of that place  
Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of  
Jehovah it shall be provided. And the angel of Jehovah  
called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven, and said,  
By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast  
done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only  
son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying  
I will multiply  

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which  
is upon the sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate  
of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of  
the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.  

</div>

The story of the near sacrifice of Isaac illustrates the truth that we
must be willing to give up the pleasures of sense without question if we
are to have the consciousness of the greater satisfactions of Spirit.
Being willing and obedient in submitting our sensations to the law of
Spirit, we then find that we do not at all sacrifice the real inner joy
but only its coarser expression in physical generation (which is
represented by the ram).

It seemed to Abraham that the law of Spiritual growth demanded the
slaying of Isaac, the whole consciousness of joy. At various stages of
unfoldment there are trials as well as triumphs, and those who have but
a transient faith in the wisdom and power of Spirit are apt to give up
and turn back before the process is complete. (Abraham did not turn
back.) Moriah, the name of the land where Abraham was sent to make his
sacrifice, signifies the "bitterness of Jehovah." So we find that the
changes that take place in consciousness sometimes are bitter
experiences, and it takes a strong faith to believe that good will come
out of them. Yet it always does come when there is steadfast obedience
to God and faith in His goodness. The successful meeting of such trials
gives great power to the body and brings a sure reward. Abraham became
the father of a multitude as numerous "as the stars of the heavens, and
as the sand which is upon the sea-shore."

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

The child was not sacrificed although Abraham took every step in
preparation. After he had successfully passed this test, the angel of
the Lord repeated the promise of the covenant: "By myself have I sworn,
saith Jehovah . . . and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth
be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice."

In the regeneration man must be willing to sacrifice his greatest
pleasure in life (Isaac). But when he has given up willingly, made the
spiritual surrender, he finds that it is not the joy of life that he
sacrifices but only the sensuous aspect of joy.

Faith in God (Abraham) and obedience to the divine law brings forth a
serene peace and joy. Christians well know that the development of faith
and obedience does cause one to become inwardly happy and outwardly
serene. Jesus had this inward happiness, and He tried to pass it on to
His disciples: "These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be
in you, and that your joy may be made full."

The name Jehovah-jireh means "Jehovah will see," "Jehovah will behold,"
"Jehovah will provide." It signifies "I am the provider." If we expect
to demonstrate prosperity from without, we find it a slow process; but
if we know that the I AM is the provider, we have the key to the
inexhaustible resource.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 22:19. So Abraham returned unto his young men,
and  
they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham  
dwelt at Beer-sheba.  
</span>

</div>

The two young men represent masculine forces that have been trained for
service under the supervision of pioneering faith.

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

Beer-sheba represents the establishing of a right relationship in
consciousness between the spiritual and the seemingly material. Faith
(Abraham) and the young masculine thoughts dwell in the state of
consciousness represented by Beer-sheba, and it is in the light of this
fact that the following incidents are to be understood.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 22:20-24. And it came to pass after these
things, that  
it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath  
borne children unto thy brother Nahor: Uz his first-born,  
and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, and  
Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.  
And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight did Milcah bear to  
Nahor, Abraham's brother. And his concubine, whose name was  
Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and  
Maacah.  
</span>

</div>

Milcah represents the soul in its function of expressing dominion,
wisdom, and good judgment. The soul of man on its feminine side is
intuitional and often perceives or senses things that, while they are
not perceived by the outer or more active and positive part of the
individual consciousness, should be heeded by it.

Nahor symbolizes a piercing and breaking up of the individual sense
consciousness hitherto unpenetrated by Truth so that a new line of
thought may be brought forth.

Nahor and Milcah united to produce eight children (states of
consciousness), whose names are interpreted here.

(For Uz see interpretation of Gen. 10.)

The name Buz means "despicable," "contempt," "despised." Buz represents
a scornful, scoffing state of thought, which is despicable in the light
of Truth.

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

The name Kemuel means "God stands," "God's righteousness." Kemuel
symbolizes the righteousness and judgment of God in the process of
becoming ascendant in individual consciousness, of growing and taking a
firmer hold; also of bringing about a closer union of the true, higher,
spiritual thoughts of the mind in order to establish the adjustment that
is needed for the further progress of the individual.

The name Chesed means "an astrologer," "a magus," "wisdom." Chesed
represents a certain type of wisdom, a wisdom that is psychical in its
nature rather than spiritual.

The name Hazo means "vision," "revelation," "agreement." The arousing of
a higher desire in man (Nahor) through the activity of faith (Abraham)
causing the piercing of the darkness of material belief and opens the
way for a new and clearer insight into Truth. This new insight is
symbolized by Hazo.

The name Pildash means "flame of fire." Pildash represents zeal, ardor,
the result of a quickening that has taken place in consciousness.

The name Jidlaph means "dropping," "distilling," "tearful." Jidlaph
represents a very negative type of thought in man.

The name Bethuel means "dweller in God," "abode of God." Bethuel
represents unity with God; a conscious abiding in Him.

Rebekah (the name of Bethuel's daughter) means "tying firmly," "snare,"
"beauty that ensnares." Rebekah represents the soul's natural delight in
beauty.

Reumah (the name of Nahor's concubine means "lofty," "sublime," "pearl."
Reumah symbolizes the soul or feminine principle in man elevated to a
place

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

of appreciation, of high esteem, in consciousness.

By Reumah, Nahor had four children, whose names are given here.

The name Tebah means "slaughter," "slaying," "life guard." Tebah
represents an active thought of or strong belief in self-defense ("life
guard") that is very destructive ("slaughter," i. e., of animals or
persons).

The name Gaham means "flaming," "burning," "charring." Gaham symbolizes
the heat of sense consciousness brought to a climax, a focus, and
burning itself out. This is caused by the higher desires (Nahor and
Reumah) that have been aroused by the awakening of faith (Abraham) in
the individual. Thus a reaction sets in, the whole consciousness revolts
against sense beliefs, and a measure of purification is accomplished.

The name Tahash means "burrowing," "diving," "ram." Tahash symbolizes an
increase of life activity in the organism but an activity more of the
animal than the spiritual kind.

The name Maacah means "squeezed," "compressed." Maacah represents an
oppressively aggressive character. He is of the outer sense man.

(For Aram see interpretation of Gen. 10:27-32.)
