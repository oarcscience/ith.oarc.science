###  Chapter IV The Reaction to Sense Living Genesis 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 

THE RESULT of sense living is the resistance that is a part of man's
consciousness. The mind of man is constantly at work, and this work
results in the production of thought forms. These thought forms assume
individual definiteness; they take on personality. They are aggregated
into a composite mind, which works out into the body. Whenever a new
idea is introduced into the mind, the personality is disturbed. It
resists; but the spiritual idea is always more powerful than the
personal, and with this resistance comes more or less commotion in the
consciousness.

Those who have entered into this process of spiritual evolution, or what
Jesus called the regeneration, are prepared for the reception of these
divine new ideas, and instead of resisting they say with Jesus, "Not my
will, but thine, be done." This attitude opens the way for the easy
advent into their consciousness of God ideas and leads to an inspiration
or steady flow of ideas into it. In this way the sense consciousness is
being transformed or lifted up, and the new man appears while the old
man is sloughed off. This is crucifixion. The assimilation of the new
ideas leads to resurrection and finally to ascension.

There have been many floods upon the earth, and nearly every people has
traditions of a time when to

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

them "the whole earth" was engulfed in a great deluge. Geologists are
agreed that there have been many deluges in the history of the earth.
But these do not necessarily refer to the Flood of Genesis, nor do they
corroborate it as history.

As history the story of the great rain in Genesis is very uncertain, and
from a historical standpoint we should gain but little of value from its
study. But as a symbolic description of certain habits of thought both
in the individual and in the race and of the result of those habits of
thought in consciousness, we can profit much from the story's study.

When we observe cloud formations over the earth we can be sure that rain
is indicated. The wind may blow the clouds away from the immediate
vicinity, but some other part of the earth will get the rain. "Clouds"
formed by ignorant or erroneous thinking also indicate a coming storm.
The effect of untrue thoughts may become manifest in any part of the
body.

The trials and reverses in the life of an individual can be traced to a
definite cause in his thinking. In it there has been some error of
belief or some confusion of thought, which in its natural course under
the law has worked itself into outer expression as in apparent loss, an
accident, a disappointment, or a disease. We deplore the condition, yet
see in it two possibilities of good. First the manifestation has
fulfilled the law and provided an avenue of escape for the pent-up error
within, and secondly, it has taught a valuable lesson. There is small
comfort in the thought that an earthquake has relieved a strained and
abnormal condition in the earth's crust. Yet when we look a little
deeper we see that a strained and abnormal condition in the

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

race thought that had to become manifest has been relieved and the race
consciousness is the better for it.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 6:1-7. And it came to pass, when men began to
multiply  
on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto  
them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that  
they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they  
chose. And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not strive with  
man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days  
be a hundred and twenty years. The Nephilim were in the  
earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of  
God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare  
children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of  
old, the men of renown.  
And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the  
earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his  
heart was only evil continually. And it repented Jehovah  
that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at  
his heart. And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have  
created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast,  
and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it  
repenteth me that I have made them.  
</span>

</div>

When we lower our ideals to a material basis, "the sons of God" are
taking unto themselves wives of "the daughters of men." "Jehovah saw
that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every
imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
When we join spiritual faculties like faith, will, and imagination to
material surroundings and personalities and sensual desires, we are
falling short of the law of Being, which is that these higher faculties
shall draw from the formless and be joined to that realm. The Nephilim
represent spiritual ideas (sons of God) uniting with psychical forces to

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

bring forth unregenerated physical forces. To unite spiritual ideas with
sensual images is in direct opposition to divine law and in the
Scripture is termed "wickedness."

When the wrong use of the spiritual faculties reaches a certain limit,
the law (Lord) of our being begins to regulate the consciousness.
Outraged nature reacts; a destruction of the false, man-made condition
sets in. This it is which is symbolized in the Book of Genesis by the
"flood" of Noah.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 6:8-17. But Noah found favor in the eyes of
Jehovah.  
These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous  
man, and perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God.  
And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And the  
earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with  
violence. And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was  
corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the  
earth.  
And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before  
me; for the earth is filled with violence through them;  
and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee  
an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark,  
and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And this  
is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three  
hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the  
height of it thirty cubits. A light shalt thou make to the  
ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the  
door of the ark shall thou set in the side thereof; with  
lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. And I,  
behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to  
destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from  
under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die.  
</span>

</div>

Lamech, the name of Noah's father, is a name

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

signifying "a strong young man," and the name Noah means "rest." In the
days of our youth we idealize the material world and devote our
spiritual faculties to the things of sense. This devotion becomes so
complete that we no longer use our spiritual faculties for their proper
functions on the spiritual plane. This results in abnormal conditions,
and the balance must be restored. A reaction sets in and there is a
flood of seemingly adverse experiences. But Noah (rest) finds "favor in
the eyes of Jehovah."

One who has indulged the strength of youth (Lamech) in pursuing the
things of sense until under the law of spiritual equilibrium he begins
to require rest (Noah) may have bodily ills. The cross-currents of
thought have brought about a precipitation of negation in the body
consciousness, caused by wicked or error thoughts clashing with the
spiritually positive ideas. This is followed by the "flood," which
drowns out the material thoughts and cleanses the "earth."

Science teaches that man's body contains all the elements that are found
in the earth. This gives rise to the thought of "ashes to ashes, dust to
dust." Religion however goes a step farther and says that man is the
epitome of Being, that he is like his Maker in spirit, soul, and body,
the image and likeness of God. If man's body is of the same character as
the earth, it is in some of its aspects like its prototype. The earth's
surface is three fourths water and the body is about eighty per cent
water. This is a major negative condition that needs but little
augmenting to cause an overflow or a "flood." Only our positive
spiritual thoughts hold back a deluge, and once there is an overbalance

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

the negative is let loose and there is great destruction. There is no
stopping this flood by any material means, and one who is spiritually
wise will not fear it but rather rejoice in the body cleansing it brings
about.

Just as the earth's waters evaporate and surround it with clouds of
mist, so the mists and clouds of life surround man's body. As the
physical forces move on these mists and clouds of earth, so do the
mental forces move on and cause the invisible ethers to condense and
flood the body with its own negative thoughts. The poetic words "A flood
of thoughts came o'er me" is no metaphor but a physiological fact. When
mind and body reach a certain tenseness or strained condition, the law
forces a conjunction, and a flood is certain to follow. This is
exemplified by what is called a "nervous breakdown." Someone has said
that America is fast becoming a nation of neurotics. We certainly need
this lesson of Noah (rest) to learn to let go of physical tenseness and
material things. This rest can be attained only when we realize that our
faculties are spiritual and must seek spiritual expression.

Man is an epitome of all that exists in Being, even as regards the
Spirit of God, which is inspired in him. But man is a free agent. He can
open his mind to the divine intelligence and know the creative law or he
can work out his unfoldment through blind experimentation. Our race is
in the experimental stage. In our ignorance we transgress the law to the
very limit, and then, a great reaction sets in; a general condition that
is negative to the point of dissolution. Then that in us which always
looks obediently to God in an extremity

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

is awakened and we seek the divine law. This obedient disposition is
represented by Noah, through whom the seed of a new state of
consciousness is saved.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 6:18-22. But I will establish my covenant with
thee;  
and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and  
thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. And of every  
living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou  
bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they  
shall be male and female. Of the birds after their kind,  
and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing  
of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come  
unto thee, to keep them alive. And take thou unto thee of  
all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall  
be food for thee, and for them. Thus did Noah; according to  
all that God commanded him, so did he.  
</span>

</div>

The only refuge from this "flood" is the ark of Jehovah. The ark
represents a positive, saving state of consciousness, which agrees with
or forms a covenant with the principle of Being, with subconscious
inspiration, with Christ. This ark is the product of "rest," "abiding"
(Noah), in the spiritual part of us, right in the midst of the flood of
error. Noah heeded not the jeers of the people about him but rested on
the promise of God.

Your ark must be built on a scientific understanding of the truth as
regards the presence, power, and wisdom of God. This is suggested by the
mathematical dimensions prescribed for the ark. Your ark is built on
affirmations of what you are in Spirit. You take with you into the ark
your wife, your sons and their wives (spiritual principles inhering in
the soul),

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

and "of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort" (male and
female or positive and negative activities of life in the organism).

The idea of divine Truth must be fed with true affirmations as you are
being lifted up and above the flood of error thoughts that surge about
you. In due time the waters of negation will subside and enable you to
walk forth and to people the "earth" of your body with new and better
ideas.

In case the error thoughts destroy the body of flesh, the ark represents
the new body that the mind spiritually projects and that forms the basis
of the organism in the new incarnation.

The story of Noah and the Flood portrays in wonderful symbolism the
manner in which one of the faculties of being operates in unfolding the
perfect man. The faculty of renunciation is twofold in action: it
eliminates the error, and it expands the good. The name Noah connotes
the sweet rest and quiet comfort that come after the soul has worked out
some of its problems in consciousness and has perceived that there is an
original spark of divinity in man that is most sacred and holy and that
man's spiritual development consists in the expansion of this original
divine spark. Jehovah, the image-and-likeness man created by Elohim God,
recognizes only the good and instructs His Adam man to open his
consciousness to good thoughts and to cleanse his consciousness from all
evil by the flood waters of denial.

Man is making his body temple an eternal dwelling place for the soul.
His goal is to bring into expression the kingdom of the heavens and to
establish it within himself. To do this he needs to realize that the old
is

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

constantly passing away and the new constantly coming in according to
the outworking of the law. He should not resist this change but rather
assist in bringing it about. We are born daily and we die daily in some
phase of consciousness. Some errors may stick in our mind for a while,
but when new light is born in consciousness, old thoughts are carried
away by Noah's Flood.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 7:1-24. And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou
and all  
thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous  
before me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou  
shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his  
female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male  
and his female; of the birds also of the heavens, seven and  
seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of  
all the earth. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to  
rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every  
living thing that I have made will I destroy them off the  
face of the ground. And Noah did according unto all that  
Jehovah commanded him.  
And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters  
was upon the earth. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his  
wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because  
of the waters of the flood. Of clean beasts, and of beasts  
that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that  
creepeth upon the ground, there went in two and two unto  
Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah.  
And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters  
of the flood were upon the earth. In the six hundredth year  
of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day  
of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the  
great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were  
opened. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and  
forty nights.  
</span>

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and  
Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three  
wives of his sons with them, into the ark; they, and every  
beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind,  
and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after  
its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of  
every sort. And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two  
and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. And  
they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as  
God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in. And the flood  
was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased,  
and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.  
And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the  
earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. And  
the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all  
the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were  
covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and  
the mountains were covered. And all flesh died that moved  
upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and  
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and  
every man: all in whose nostrils was the breath of the  
spirit of life, of all that was on dry land, died. And  
every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of  
the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and  
birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the  
earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him  
in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon the earth a  
hundred and fifty days.  

</div>

"The rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights." The number 40
is made up of the number 4, representing unlimited freedom of action,
and the cipher, 0, representing unlimited capacity of action. This
number is used where a definite time cannot be

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

given. "Day" and "night" represent periods of understanding and lack of
understanding, succeeding each other during the "forty" period. The
number of Noah's age, 600, represents an established degree of spiritual
unfoldment. The number 7 represents the evolution and fulfillment of the
spiritual law of man on the natural plane.

(For further interpretation of this material see comments on Gen.
6:8-22.)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 8:1-3. And God remembered Noah, and all the
beasts,  
and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God  
made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters  
assuaged; the fountains also of the deep and the windows of  
heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was  
restrained; and the waters returned from off the earth  
continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days  
the waters decreased.  
</span>

</div>

This Scripture describes symbolically a change in consciousness from the
negative to the positive state. A certain set of negative thoughts run
their course and the restorative thought forces are in evidence.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 8:4-6. And the ark rested in the seventh month,
on the  
seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountain of Ararat.  
And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month:  
in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the  
tops of the mountains seen.  
And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah  
opened the window of the ark which he had made:  
</span>

</div>

Ararat symbolizes resting in a state of consciousness high above the
physical plane, where one gets a wide perspective of material things. It
is the place of rest

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

(Noah) that one arrives at through understanding and that follows
turbulence, tribulation, and a flood of negative conditions.

The number 7 represents fullness in the world of phenomena. It always
refers to the divine law of perfection for the divine-natural man. As
man lays hold of the indwelling Christ, the Saviour, he is raised out of
the Adam consciousness. He then enters the seventh stage of his
unfoldment, where he finds rest and peace. It is the seventh or perfect
stage of man's natural development.

The ark reaches the seventh stage of unfoldment in a high consciousness,
which brings a certain measure of peace and rest.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 8:7-14. And he sent forth a raven, and it went
forth  
to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the  
earth. And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the  
waters were abated from off the face of the ground; but the  
dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she  
returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the  
face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and  
took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark. And he  
stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the  
dove out of the ark; and the dove came in to him at  
eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off:  
so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the  
earth. And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth  
the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more.  
And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in  
the first month, the first day of the month, the waters  
were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the  
covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of  
the ground was dried. And in the second month, on the seven  
and twentieth  
</span>

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

day of the month, was the earth dry.  

</div>

When we begin to realize that we have attained a new and high state of
consciousness we are more or less in doubt as to its stability. This
uncertainty is symbolized by the raven. The seven days' wait means that
we test the principles of the sevenfold law.

Then we send forth the dove, which represents peace of mind and
confidence in the divine law. The dove is nonresistant: we rest in the
Spirit. The dove brings back a green olive leaf (which represents the
beginning of a new growth). We start on a new cycle of unfoldment.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 8:15-22. And God spake unto Noah, saying, Go
forth  
from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy  
sons' wives with thee. Bring forth with thee every living  
thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and  
cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the  
earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be  
fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. And Noah went forth,  
and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:  
every beast, every creeping things, and every bird,  
whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families,  
went forth out of the ark.  
And Noah builded an alter unto Jehovah, and took of every  
clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered  
burnt-offerings on the altar. And Jehovah smelled the sweet  
savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again  
curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the  
imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither  
will I again smite any more everything living, as I have  
done. While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and  
cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night  
shall not cease.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

The altar in this case represents an abiding resolution of the
spiritual-minded one (Noah) who makes a covenant with the Lord to
continue to "sacrifice" his sensations or transmute them on the
spiritual plane. The spiritual-minded person should have his daily
meditations and prayers, during which he lifts up all his states of
consciousness, both masculine and feminine, seeking to know the reality
back of appearances and to restore them to the Lord. This is symbolized
by the daily sacrifice of the animals that came out of the ark. Thus the
body is secured against the results of another universal judgment of
error thoughts.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 9:1-7. And God blessed Noah and his sons, and
said  
unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the  
earth. And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be  
upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the  
heavens; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the  
fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered. Every  
moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the  
green herb have I given you all. But flesh with the life  
thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And  
surely your blood, the blood of your lives, will I require;  
at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the  
hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, will  
I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by  
man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made  
He man. And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth  
abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.  
</span>

</div>

Noah (the consciousness), with his sons (states of mind), after the
Flood (his purification) is very closely related to God.

The "flood" cleanses man of certain cloudy states of mind, and he begins
to see that he lives on three

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

planes of consciousness, represented by Noah's three sons: Ham, whose
name means "hot," typifying body mind; Shem, whose name means
"renowned," typifying Spirit-mind, and Japheth, whose name means
"extended and wide," typifying the intellect. He also sees that his body
mind organizes a fourth plane, that of the visible flesh, Canaan.

The matter of food is also to be solved. "Every moving thing that liveth
shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all." The
wording implies that green herbs are to be the food of both man and
animal. But the next command is "But flesh with the life thereof, which
is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat." The importance of the living
element in blood is its soul (Hebrew nephesh), which becomes part of
man's soul when he eats the blood of animals. This is forbidden, hence
to this day orthodox Hebrews drain the blood from the animal flesh
before it is offered for food. It is also significant that green herbs
are now recommended for food for both animals and man. When we eat of
the flesh of animals as popularly prepared we appropriate the soul of
the animal as well as the body, and our soul is mentally impregnated
with animal tendencies. As Byron said, "the eating of meat makes me
savage."

God covenants or agrees to bless the purified consciousness and its
realm of ideas (seed). Every idea (living creature) that is illumined of
Spirit--even an idea relating to the body consciousness (earth)--is
blessed when man knows the creative law and operates in accord with it.

Once the consciousness has been cleansed and man has awakened to his
spiritual nature, he is saved

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

through obedience to divine law and is no longer subject to dissolution
through negative means. This "covenant," which is eternal, is with those
who give up mind and body to the keeping of divine law. The "bow"
signifies the orderly arrangement of ideas in Divine Mind and their
perfect manifestation. One who is poised in Truth rests in the
consciousness of God's presence even in the midst of error (the cloud).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 9:8-19. And God spake unto Noah, and to his
sons with  
him, saying, And I, behold, I establish my covenant with  
you, and with your seed after you; and with every living  
creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every  
beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark,  
even every beast of the earth. And I will establish my  
covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any  
more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any  
more be a flood to destroy the earth. And God said, This is  
the token of the covenant which I make between me and you  
and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual  
generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be  
for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it  
shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,  
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud, and I will  
remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every  
living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more  
become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be  
in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember  
the everlasting covenant between God and every living  
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said  
unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have  
established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.  
And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were  
Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of  
Canaan. These three were the sons  
</span>

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

of Noah: and of these was the whole earth over-spread.  

</div>

God made a covenant with Noah that the earth should not again be
flooded, and the rainbow was given as a sign of this covenant. The
rainbow as a token of the covenant between God and the earth involves
the law of obedience. It is also symbolic of the human race and of the
law of unity. The rainbow is formed of many drops of water, each of
which acts as a prism, receiving light from the sun and transmitting it
by refraction. Each drop represents a human being and the whole race.
Only as the drops refract the sun's rays do they become visible and only
as man "refracts" God does he make his demonstration.

The seven colors of the solar spectrum are produced by different rates
of vibration of a universal energy that in its myriad activities makes
the visible universe.

When man is like Noah, obedient to the guidance of God, he is never
flooded by negative conditions. When the whole race enters into this
obedience, the perfect principles of unity and God refraction and
reflection will be forever established. The rainbow is the sign of this
state in which we shall all form with our obedient mind a circle of
natural perfection. As the rainbow connects the heavens and the earth,
so the state of perfect obedience and unity in Spirit brings the earth
and the kingdom of the heavens together as one.

<span class="small">Gen. 9:20-29. And Noah began to be a husbandman,
and  
planted a vineyard: and he drank of the wine, and was  
drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the  
father of Canaan,  
</span>

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren  
without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it  
upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered  
the nakedness of their father; and their faces were  
backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And  
Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son  
had done unto him. And he said,  
Cursed be Canaan;  
A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.  
And he said,  
Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem;  
And let Canaan be his servant.  
God enlarge Japheth,  
And let him dwell in the tents of Shem;  
And let Canaan be his servant.  
And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty  
years. And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty  
years: and he died.  

</div>

Noah had planted a vineyard, and he drank of the wine: took into his
physical nature the juice of the grape. This is symbolical of the new
spiritual life that is still contaminated by the sense consciousness.
Noah had given his attention to the cultivation of the vineyard (earth
consciousness) rather than the cultivation of the spiritual
consciousness. More thoroughly to explain what the drunkenness of Noah
signifies we must resolve the allegory into its spiritual elements.

Noah became "uncovered" or naked (lost his garment of Truth) because he
mixed sense (artificial) stimulants with the new wine of life, Spirit.
His cultivation of the life force in this physical manner is like the
work of some of our physical scientists. Athletes cultivate the physical
in an effort to increase the flow of life force and imagine that the
physical side is

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

the whole thing. Instead of illuminating Noah or giving him life the
wine put him to sleep. He was intoxicated with error thought, and this
opened his consciousness to negation. The higher man saw at once that he
was not expressing spiritual Truth.

Although the sons of Noah were supposed to be on a higher plane than he,
yet they were also in sense consciousness in a measure, and this is
especially true of Ham. Now there is a higher and lower physical
consciousness, and the name of Canaan, Ham's son, is introduced to
symbolize the lower physical thought, the organized body. Ham saw the
ignorance and the nakedness that sense thinking had produced in his
father but did nothing to remedy it, nor did he try to extenuate the
uncovering in any way. To Ham the thing was more or less a joke, and he
told his brothers about it, evidently in a scandalous way. This reveals
that man cannot get spiritual life out of material thought.

Shem, representing the Spirit in man, and Japheth, representing the
intellectual nature, have pity on their father (man) because of his
exposure of his nakedness and sensuality and try to cover it up without
seeing it as a reality. They put a garment over their shoulders and walk
backward and spread it over their father's nakedness. They do not view
the occurrence as a reality.

When Noah awoke from his wine--that is, returned to his spiritual
consciousness--his first words were "Cursed be Canaan." Canaan means
"lowland" and represents the body consciousness. "A servant of servants
shall he be unto his brethren," he said, thus placing the stamp of
materiality upon the body consciousness

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

and showing that it cannot give spiritual life.

But Noah said to the God of Shem, "Let Canaan be his servant"; that is,
let the flesh come under the dominion of the spiritual man. Of Japheth
Noah said, "Let him dwell in the tents of Shem"; that is, let the
intellectual man dwell under the protection of the spiritual man, not as
a servant but as a younger brother. Thus the physical mind (Ham) and the
body (Canaan) come under the dominion of both the intellectual man and
the spiritual man, the I AM itself.

The sons of Noah represent the positive, permanent thoughts that rise
above the negative, wicked conditions, even the catastrophe of death
(the Flood), and come down to earth again. In other words, they are
carried over and reincarnated when the soul again takes on a body of
flesh.

In order to get the most from physical man we must seek to develop him
along spiritual lines. When the spiritual man (Noah) begins a new cycle,
a new evolution in physical consciousness (after the cleansing of the
"flood") he must give attention to the impact of the ideas put into the
body consciousness, select carefully his food and drink, and refuse to
give himself to the sense consciousness in any way.

We find the 10th chapter of Genesis to be devoted to genealogy. It gives
an account of the descendents of Noah and his three sons, Shem, Ham, and
Japheth.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 10:1-32. Now these are the generations of the
sons of  
Noah, namely, of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were  
sons born after the flood. The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and  
Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech,  
</span>

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

and Tiras. And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath,  
and Togarmah. And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish,  
and Kittim, and Dodanim. Of these were the isles of the  
nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue,  
after their families, in their nations.  
And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and  
Canaan. And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and  
Sabtah, and Raamah, Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba,  
and Dedan. And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty  
one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah:  
wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before  
Jehovah. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and  
Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Out of  
that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh,  
and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, and Resen, between Nineveh and  
Calah (the same is the great city). And Mizraim begat  
Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, and  
Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the  
Philistines), and Caphtorim.  
And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth, and the  
Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite, and the  
Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, and the Arvadite,  
and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the  
families of the Canaanite spread abroad. And the border of  
the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar,  
unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and  
Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. These are the sons of Ham,  
after their families, after their tongues, in their lands,  
in their nations.  
And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the  
elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.  
The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and  
Lud, and Aram. And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and  
Gether, and Mash. And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah  

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

begat Eber. And unto Eber was born two sons: the name of  
the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided;  
and his brother's name was Joktan. And Joktan begat  
Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, and  
Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, and Obal, and Abimael, and  
Sheba, and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were  
the sons of Joktan. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as  
thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. These  
are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their  
tongues, in their lands, after their nations.  
These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their  
generations, in their nations: and of these were the  
nations divided in the earth after the flood.  

</div>

The name Shem means "upright," "renowned," "splendor," "name."
Metaphysically Shem represents the spiritual in man.

The name Ham means "oblique," "curved," "inferior," "hot," "blackened."
Metaphysically Ham represents the physical in man, given over to
sensuality.

The name Japheth means "extended and wide," "increase," "expansion,"
"unfoldment," "extends without limitation." Metaphysically Japheth
represents the intellect or reason, the mental realm. To "extend without
limitation" this realm would have to extend into the spiritual.

Noah's three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, represent the spiritual, the
physical, and the mental in man.

The names of the "sons of Japheth" follow:

The name Gomer means "organic accumulation," "finished or perfected,"
"ended." Gomer represents human reason in its greatest perfection and
completion; but by reasoning alone man cannot reach spiritual wisdom

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

and Truth or come in conscious touch with God, Spirit.

The name Magog means "region of God," "from the upper, i.e., north,"
"extreme extension." Symbolically Magog represents the satanic or
selfish thought force in human consciousness warring against the true
thought force that springs from the ideas that Jesus taught and
demonstrated.

The name Madai means "sufficiency," "indefinite capacity," "middle
portion." Madai represents the phase of being in man that lies between
the outer or conscious thinking mind and the superconscious mind or
Spirit; the psychic realm.

The name Javan means "the East," "the dove," "warmth," "fertility,"
"mire," "deception." Javan symbolizes the human or personal intellect in
man and one of its governing characteristics, the deceptive, error
belief that understanding is gained through the impressions of the
senses in contact with the outer world and through books, teachers, and
experience rather than through the Spirit of God within the soul of man.
In the broadest sense Javan also represents the spiritual phase of
intelligence or illumined and inspired intellect, hence the idea of the
East, of fertility and productiveness.

The name Tubal signifies "diffusive motion," "welling," "triumphal
song." Tubal represents the expanding possibilities of the consciousness
of man, with the joy and the good that result from increased
understanding.

The name Meshech means "perceptibility," "drawing out," "deducing."
Meshech stands for perception through the senses, judgment according to
appearances,

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

and the work of the mind in conceiving ideas and in drawing conclusions.

The name Tiras means "determination of forms," "thought," "imagination,"
"desire." Metaphysically Tiras represents the imagination or formative
faculty of man made active in the mind of the individual by the inner
longing of the soul (desire), whichever leads to unfoldment Godward. As
the seventh son of Japheth, Tiras represents a certain fullness or
completeness of that which Japheth symbolizes, the mental phase of man's
being. The power to think, to image in the mind, is the formative power
in man.

The names of "the sons of Gomer," with their meaning, follow:

The name Ashkenaz means "fire that spreads," "latent fire," "hidden
fire." Ashkenaz represents the life thought formed in Spirit, the "fire
that spreads" to assist in doing away with the confused state of mind
represented by Babylon. When the life thought is taken up consciously by
man it extends quickly to the whole consciousness, overthrowing sense
confusion and its inharmonies. Fire stands for cleansing and
purification and is generally used in the Bible as a symbol of the
destruction of evil and error.

The name Riphath signifies "centrifugal force," "spoken word," "pardon,"
"healing." Riphath symbolizes the power actively expressing itself
through the will and the word. This power, though more mental than
spiritual, is refining and healing.

The name Togarmah means "centralizing energy," "gravitation," "hard,"
"strong." Togarmah represents strength and a drawing, centralizing force
or energy; a force or energy of the intellect rather than of the inner

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

spiritual understanding and therefore characterized by very great
hardness and selfishness.

The names of "the sons of Javan" are given here:

The name Elishah means "God firmly establishes," "uprightness of God,"
"God saves." Even the human reason acknowledges that God is the saving
power of His people. The intellectual powers of man are human and they
are deceptive. Yet they are productive on their own plane; and Elishah
represents the power back of the intellect that knows God to be the one
true helping, sustaining, saving power in man.

The name Tarshish means "precipitating force," "hard," "severity."
Tarshish symbolizes the hard, unyielding, argumentative tendency that is
characteristic of the purely intellectual and reasoning nature in man
when unmixed with divine love and the softening influence of spiritual
wisdom.

The name Kittim signifies "the cut off," "the rejected," "outsiders."
Kittim represents a phase of the outer, sense-reasoning mind in man, as
opposed to the inner, true spiritual understanding. This phase of
thought must be cut off, rejected, by the individual who would progress
spiritually, since it is an "outsider," uncivilized and reprobate as far
as Truth is concerned.

The name Dodanim means "confederates," "the elect," "lovable,"
"pleasing." Dodanim represents unifying thoughts of a very excellent
character belonging to the intellect in man.

These are the names of "the sons of Ham":

The name Cush means "burned," "blackened," "firelike." Cush represents
the darkened thought in which man has held his body and its activities,
the seemingly mortal, physical part of himself. But this

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

all changes as he perceives the Truth and holds in mind the perfect-body
idea.

The name Mizraim means "limitation," "bondage," "tribulation." Mizraim
is symbolical of the sense belief that the life as well as the organism
of man is bound in materiality and that man is subject to sorrows and to
all forms of error that hinder him from receiving good.

The name Put signifies "state of being stifled," "asphyxiation or
suffocation." Put represents the darkened, sorrowful, and very material
dying state of mind and body that results from a lack of spiritual
inspiration, of the inbreathing and understanding of Spirit.

The name Canaan means "material existence," "realized nothingness,"
"lowland," "inferior." Canaan thus represents the body consciousness;
the fleshly organism and tendencies of man; the physical rather than the
spiritual. We also think of Canaan as denoting the subconsciousness.

Here are the names of "the sons of Cush," with their meaning:

The name Seba signifies "radical mixture," "vital fluid," "intoxicated."
Seba represents intemperate desire expressing itself in the body
consciousness. The Seba thought or state of thought is not poised,
moderate, or well balanced as regards anything; it goes to extremes,
especially in the indulgence of the appetites and desires of the flesh.

The name Havilah means "struggle of elementary life," "virtue born of
trial." Havilah symbolizes the effort, the travail, the trials that are
necessary to bring into manifestation the inner spiritual possibilities
that lie back of and are wrapped up in the seemingly material organism.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

The name Sabtah means "determining motion," "a trun," "orbit." Sabtah
represents the general cyclical trend of the activity of the sensual in
man. Led away by outer seeming, man has through the exercise of his
personal will set up a course of action in sense consciousness that
falls short of the divine ideal and is contentious and destructive.

The name Raamah signifies "moved with agitation," "trembling,"
"quaking." Raamah represents the result or fruit of the ignorant thought
of the sense man regarding his body. This result takes the shape of the
nameless fears, inner trembling, and un-Godlike emotions that the sense
man experiences.

The significance of the name Sabteca is the same as that of Sabtah but
greatly intensified.

The following are the names of "the sons of Raamah":

The name Sheba means "rest or repose," "stability," "restoration." Sheba
represents a thought of wholeness or fullness on some plane of
existence. Whether this thought belongs to the inner man or the outer
man depends on who the person in the Bible name Sheba is and on his
descent, history, or activities. If the activities are constructive or
if he owns descent from Shem he represents higher and more spiritual
thoughts than if the activities are not constructive and he is descended
from Ham.

The name Dedan means "mutual attraction," "selective affinity,"
"physical love." Dedan refers to a phase of physical or animal
attraction and affection.

The names of the children of Cush, with their meaning, are given here:

The name Nimrod means "self-ruling will," "rebellion."

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

Nimrod denotes the rule of the personal will in the animal forces of the
organism; also a material belief in courage and might.

The name Babel signifies "court of Baal," "confusion," "chaos,"
"vanity." When man thinks that he can comprehend and contract the divine
in outer or purely mental or psychic ways the result is always
confusion.

The name Erech means "long," "extended," "slack"; in a good sense,
"prolonged," "lasting." Erech represents a state of consciousness in
which, because of long and extended material thinking the natural,
inherent wholeness and goodness of man is conceived by him entirely in
terms of the material, bringing about the disastrous results of error in
body and affairs.

The name Accad signifies "castle," "fortress," "highland." Accad
represents a fixed state of belief that protection, great strength,
exalted position, and superiority are to be attained through the
intellectual and the physical alone.

The name Calneh signifies "complete concentration," "centralized
ambition." Calneh represents selfishness, a centering in self; also
confidence in material conditions rather than trust in God.

The name Shinar signifies "two rivers," "divided stream," "divided
mind." Shinar represents a belief in two powers, an evil as well as a
good one, and the error results.

Assyria represents the reasonings, philosophical as well as physical,
that do not recognize a spiritual head of the universe but are based on
sense observation.

The name Nineveh means "exterior growth," "coordination,"

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

"education of youth." Nineveh represents the seat of the natural animal
forces in man's body consciousness. The people of Nineveh were not
willfully wicked; they were only awaiting spiritual instruction that
would turn their attention away from the outer and material to God.

Rehoboth-Ir ("broad places," "enlargements," "forums") symbolizes
thoughts of a broadening, increasing nature, principally on the
intellectual or mental plane in the individual.

The name Calah signifies "completed," "integrity," "an ancient." Calah
represents a state of consciousness built about the belief that age (in
terms of years) and experience bring balanced judgment and fullness or
perfection.

The name Resen means "executive power," "control from above,"
"restraint." Resen indicates recognition by the natural man that there
is a higher guiding, ruling, judging, restraining power in his life than
that of the purely human and material.

The name Ludim signifies "travails," "conception," "nativity or physical
birth." Ludim represents man's material beliefs regarding the origin and
continuation of the race; also the expression of these beliefs.

The name Anamim means "statues," "rockmen," "fountains." Anamim
represents hard, material thoughts about life ("fountains"). Such
thoughts aid in building a corruptible body, a mere statue in so far as
its being truly alive through union with the divine source of all life
is concerned.

The name Lehabim means "inflamed uprisings," "passionate." Lehabim
represents the life of the seemingly material and physical organism
activated wholly

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

by the tendencies and desires of the outer animal man.

Naphtuhim ("the opened," "the hollow," "the empty ones") represent empty
thoughts of lack, thoughts that the physical man is wholly material.

The name Pathrusim signifies "region of the south," "broken into
fragments," "dust." The Pathrusim represent thoughts belonging to a
state of mind that, though there is good in it, is still in darkness so
far as the individual is consciously or subconsciously concerned.

The name Casluhim signifies "tried for atonement," "forgiveness of
sins," "hopes of life." The thought represented by Casluhim is that
man's outer consciousness evolves, unfolds, Godward by means of trials,
testings, and experience.

The name Philistines signifies "transitory," "migrating," "wandering."
The Philistines represent forces foreign to Spirit. The five great
cities of the Philistines ruled by "lords" denote the five senses under
the dominion of thoughts foreign to Spirit (strangers, foreigners).

The name Caphtorim means "converts," "converters." Caphtorim represents
changing, growing, unfolding thoughts that belong to the seemingly
physical in man.

The name Sidon signifies "catching of fish," "providing," "hunter."
Sidon symbolizes a great increase of ideas on the animal plane of
thought or being in the individual.

The name Heth means "sundered," "broken," "terrified." Heth represents a
very active thought of fear, the result of thinking apart from Spirit.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

Jebusite represents the spiritual or peace center in consciousness
(Jerusalem) in subjection to purely sense and carnal thoughts, beliefs,
and desires.

The name Amorites signifies "mountaineers," "highlanders." The Amorites
represent the race thought of the generation of the flesh. Sex and
procreation are very strongly rooted in man's consciousness and have
been elevated by man in personal thought to the very heights.

The name Girgashite signifies "belonging to that which is dense,"
"marshy ground." A Girgashite represents the material state of thought
that unawakened man holds concerning himself and especially concerning
his material organism.

"wickedness." A Hivite represents the thoughts belonging to the carnal
consciousness in man.

The name Arkite means "fugitive," "blind passions." An Arkite represents
thoughts pertaining to the carnal consciousness in man.

The name Sinite means "clayey," "muddy," "hateful passions." A Sinite
represents thoughts missing the mark, falling short of the divine law.

The name Arvadite means "avarice," "plunder," "pirate's den." An
Arvadite represents a retreat or refuge or unstable, erring, destructive
thoughts in a mixed, confused, ever-changing consciousness of man.

The name Zemarite signifies "hunger for dominion or thirst for power,"
"despot." A Zemarite represents rebellious, tyrannical, despotic
thoughts and desires belonging to the "mind of the flesh" consciousness
in unredeemed man, the outer seeking dominion.

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

The name Hamathite means "inclosed," "held together," "fortress." A
Hamathite represents confidence in material conditions rather than trust
in God.

The name Gerar signifies "a sojourn," "a lodging place," "an
encampment." Gerar symbolizes subjective substance and life. In the
beginning of man's journey Spiritward this substance and life are in
possession of the sense nature (Philistines), and the ruling ego of the
sense nature lives in the region of this place.

The name Gaza means "strength," "power," "stronghold," Gaza represents
strength on a purely physical or sense plane.

The name Sodom signifies "consumed with fire," "hidden wiles," "covered
conspiracies." Sodom represents an obscure or concealed thought or habit
in man.

The name Gomorrah means "overbearing," "tyranny," "oppression." Gomorrah
represents a state of mind in man that is submerged in sense and is very
tyrannical in its nature.

The name Admah means "silent," "unrelenting," "a tomb," "a fortress."
Admah represents the seeming strength and merciless sureness of the
death thought and condition that enters into man's experience as the
result of his carnal, material, adverse thoughts and activities.

The name Zeboiim signifies "wars," "plunderings," "rendings with the
teeth." Zeboiim refers to ravenous appetites, sensual passions, the
wild-beast nature holding sway deep in the subconsciousness of many.

The name Lasha signifies "bursting forth," "fountains," "for looking
upon." The cities that are mentioned in the text with Lasha as being on
the southern border of Canaan are representative of the subconscious

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

substance and life in man ruled over and actuated by various phases of
the subjective carnal, sense mind. Lasha symbolizes the bursting forth
of this inner substance and life into greater activity in consciousness.
Lasha also refers to the penetration by higher ideals, truer
understanding, of a seemingly mortal and material state of the
subjective substance and life in unawakened man.

The names of the children of Shem, with their meaning, are listed here:

The name Eber signifies "passed over," "overcome," "a shoot." Eber
represents the germination in man's consciousness of the spiritual phase
of his being.

The name Elam signifies "eternal or everlasting," "fully developed."
Elam symbolizes thoughts of the abidingness, resourcefulness, and
creative power of Truth, of that which is of God, Spirit.

The name Asshur signifies "a step," "level ongoing," "observance of
laws," "harmonious." Asshur typifies mental recognition that the entire
man, spirit, soul, and body, is free, is of spiritual origin, and is not
bound by any limitation of matter.

The name Arpachshad signifies "providential regeneration," "realm of
astrology." Arpachshad represents the belief in man that his good
depends wholly on something outside of himself--his ruling star, fate,
providence--instead of depending on the power of his own thoughts to
establish within himself and his world what he wills.

The name Lud signifies "desire to bring forth," "conception,"
"creation." Lud represents man's earliest conception of the truth that
he is the offspring of God.

The name Aram means "highland," "high or exalted."

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

Aram symbolizes the intellect, which has its foundation in Spirit; but
in unawakened man it is linked up entirely with the outer or material
realm so that it reasons from the basis of the senses instead of
acknowledging Divine Mind as the source of all intelligence.

The names of "the sons of Aram," with their meaning, follow:

The name Uz means "growing might," "formative power," "plan." Uz denotes
the process of thought by which man arrives at a conclusion (be it true
or erroneous) and establishes it in consciousness.

The name Hul means "circle," "ecstasy," "travail," "fear." Hul stands
for that in the intellect of man which seeks to conform to both the
spiritual and outer-sense ideas of wisdom and understanding.

The name Gether means "abundance," "pressed out," "vale of trial."
Gether represents man's belief that much physical effort is needed to
make a living and to acquire abundance; thus he experiences hard labor
and many inharmonies.

The name Mash signifies "pressing out by contractile force," "harvest of
fruits." In Mash we see the intellect in the role of obtaining
knowledge. The intellect is not naturally receptive to spiritual
understanding. It is aggressive in its nature and it works very hard in
the outer seeking to obtain by force, by personal determination, and by
much persistent study and research the knowledge that it desires. The
very pressure of its outer seeking does open to it something of the
inner light and intelligence of Spirit, though in its ignorance it
usually takes to itself the honor of having worked out the ideas that
come to it from Spirit.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

However fruit is realized in increased knowledge.

The name Shelah means "security," "peace," "demand," "prayer." Shelah
represents a sense of peace, harmony, and security that has come about
by prayer, affirmation, and desire centered in that which is good and
true.

The names of the children of Eber, with their meaning, are given here:

The name Peleg means "separation through grace," "cleaving," "dividing."
Peleg represents man's first realization of the difference and seeming
separation between his apparently material organism and his inner
spiritual ideals. Thus was the "earth divided," and the individual began
to recognize his higher nature.

The name Joktan signifies "that which is diminished," "lessened," "of
little concern." Joktan represents the lessening to the vanishing point
of error in the consciousness and life of the unfolding individual.

The following are the names, with their meaning, of the children of
Joktan:

The name Almodad signifies "measure of God," "the agitator." Almodad
represents a certain discernment of the boundless possibilities that are
open to man if he makes practical application of Truth. This
understanding however proves to be a disturbing element ("agitator") in
consciousness because it is not definite enough to bring about the real
change of mind that is needed to establish peace and order and to bring
forth spiritual fruit.

The name Sheleph means "reaction," "refraction," "drawing out." Sheleph
represents a working out from

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

within of the spiritual in man; or at least a striving of Spirit within
man for greater expression in and through the individual.

The name Hazarmaveth means "village of death," "court of death."
Hazarmaveth symbolizes a central thought or group of thoughts belonging
to the sense mind of man and having as its ruling idea a strong belief
in death. Its conception of justice ("court") is always active on the
negative, condemnatory, and destructive side.

The name Jerah signifies "he will breathe," "he will become inspired,"
"moon." Jerah represents the light (understanding) of the inspired
intellect, or to the capacity of the intellect of man for being
illumined by Spirit and for radiating the light of Spirit, divine
understanding.

The name Hadoram signifies "powerful," "pompous," "majestic." Hadoram
represents the lifting up of the outer, sense mind of man, and the
attributing of power and might to it as though it were man's highest
source of light and good.

The name Uzal signifies "continual going forth," "divine spark." Uzal
represents the continual unfoldment that takes place in the
progressively inclined individual because of his natural tendency to
conform to the divine ideal or divine spark within him, which is ever
urging him on to higher light, new understanding, purer thoughts and
ways.

The name Diklah means "palm tree," "palm grove," "ethereal lightness."
Diklah denotes the inherent belief of man's inner, spiritual, or true
self that complete victory over all error and complete triumph in
understanding and life are his heritage.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

The name Obal signifies "extreme attenuation of matter," "stripped,"
"barren." Obal denotes the barrenness, nakedness, and nothingness of all
that is not founded in Truth.

The name Abimael means "a father from God," "father of abundance."
Abimael stands for the thought of man as being descended from God; also
for the thought of abundance as coming from God. At a certain stage of
man's unfoldment however the thought represented by Abimael is not
established in consciousness with enough positiveness to produce
spiritual results.

The name Ophir signifies "a final state," "purity," "ashes." Ophir
symbolizes that which remains after the deeper purification by fire has
taken place. Through purification by the Christ Spirit, by the baptism
of fire, all that is true is refined, purified, and elevated to its
rightful place in the kingdom, while the dross or error of the carnal,
adverse mind is reduced to dust and ashes.

The name Jobab signifies "fullness of joy," "trumpet call of victory,"
"desert," "wail of tribulation." Here Jobab represents a certain
fulfillment of the seeming mortal and an entrance into that which the
positive, spiritual meanings of the name denotes: a realization of
dominion over error and a rejoicing in Truth.

The name Mesha means "harvest of spiritual fruits," "heaped-up fullness
of being," "refuge," "freedom." Mesha symbolizes a place in
consciousness wherein the inner life forces of the organism are freed
from the dominion of carnal thought, thus raising them to higher and
more spiritual expression.

The name Sephar means "remembering," "engraving,"

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

"book." The east always represents the within, and a mountain denotes a
high plane of thought. In the consciousness of the individual, Sephar
represents that high place within the spiritual realm of his being where
a record is kept of all the thoughts, ideals, tendencies, desires, and
activities to which he has given attention, even to those that belong to
the seemingly changeable and unestablished phase of his consciousness
(the Arabian tribes that were descended from Joktan).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 11:1-9. And the whole earth was of one language
and of  
one speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed east,  
that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they  
dwelt there. And they said one to another, Come, let us  
make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick  
for stone, and slime had they for mortar. And they said,  
Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may  
reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be  
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And  
Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the  
children of men builded. And Jehovah said, Behold, they are  
one people, and they have all one language; and this is  
what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden  
from them, which they purpose to do. Come, let us go down,  
and there confound their language, that they may not  
understand one another's speech. So Jehovah scattered them  
abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they  
left off building the city. Therefore was the name of it  
called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the  
language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah  
scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

</div>

Here is related the building by the descendents of Noah of a city and a
tower that was to reach to heaven.

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

"And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech," which
indicates that there was unity in the interchange of intelligence and
purpose but that it was based on materiality: "And they had brick for
stone, and slime had they for mortar." They built the city and the
tower; but Jehovah confounded their language and they were scattered
abroad "upon the face of all the earth."

According to Ferrar Fenton's translation of the Bible in modern English,
the word Jehovah should be translated "chief." The chief was the priest
or ruling religious power. So it was not Jehovah who confused the
tongues of the people but their religious leaders. This is true today.

Interpreted in individual consciousness, it is not Spirit that leads man
astray but man's interpretation of the message of Spirit as molded by
man's mentality. In other words, it was the Adversary or personal ego of
the people that asserted its disintegrating nature and destroyed the
work of their hands.

The name Babel means "confusion." Babel represents the mental chaos that
is the result of thinking from a wholly material standpoint.

Whether the story of the building of Babel and the scattering of its
people be history or allegory matters little; it illustrates the
ephemeral character of man's work exemplified times beyond number in the
buried cities of the past. Not only cities but great nations have
occupied large areas of this earth, only to be swept away.

This universal scattering of the nations that bravely set out to build
cities and civilizations planned to reach to heaven and endure forever,
should make thinking

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

persons pause and inquire the cause of such stupendous failure. The fact
is that the foundations of their cities were material instead of
spiritual; there was an excess of "stone, and slime."

However every great nation has claimed God as its originator and often
its temporal heads as ruling by divine right. As long as these nations
had faith in this divine source they prospered, but when the personal
element began to assert itself, decline set in, the nation collapsed,
and its people scattered.

This is not only the history of cities and nations but also of numerous
colonies of Utopian pattern for the betterment of men. Their plans are
perfect and appear to be based on laws that will work toward universal
happiness and prosperity. But they fail because their leader is some
human being, and there is often some other human being in the colony who
is ambitious to rule. Politics and party strife then enter and break
down the unity that is so necessary to the success of any enterprise.

History shows that often just preceding a great national collapse
dictators or "chiefs" assume the power personally to make and enforce
the laws for the people. This condition repeats itself in world affairs
and presages a breakdown of man-made civilization. The towers of Babel
totter and philosophic onlookers foretell a lapse of the human family
into primitive savagery.

That the principles on which the governments of the world are based are
inadequate to meet the needs of a world nation is patent to anyone who
studies the economic and moral status of various countries. God created
all men of one blood, according to the Scriptures, and that universal
bond of humanity is asserting

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

itself in the tremendous increase in facilities for intercourse among
men of every country. The struggle for separate national existence must
be broken down, and a new and larger understanding of race solidarity
established.

We see that history is repeating itself on a larger scale than ever
before and is again ready to scatter the inhabitants of Babel who have
attempted to build to heaven without God. After the breaking up of the
present materially founded governments, the spiritually wise will get
together and form a federation based on the principles laid down by
Jesus Christ, and we shall then enter into that universal peace and
security called the millennium. "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be
preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations; and
then shall the end come." The prophecies of Jesus, as set forth
symbolically in Matthew 24, undoubtedly point to their fulfillment at
this time, and the "tribulations" there recited are upon us. But we need
not be fearful or troubled if we are depending on God to take care of
us. "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong," "but
he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved."

<span class="small">Gen. 11:10-32. These are the generations of Shem.
Shem was

<span class="small">And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: and
Peleg  
lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and

Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram,  
Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. And Haran died  
before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur  
of the Chaldees. And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the  
name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's  
wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah,  
and the father of Iscah. And Sarai was barren; she had no  
child. And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of  
Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his  
son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of  
the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came  
unto Haran, and dwelt there. And the days of Terah were two  
hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.

The name Reu means "leading to pasture," "shepherd," "friend." Reu
represents the co-operative feeling, the feeling of friendship, evolving
in the individual consciousness into a sense of loving, active,
responsibility for the welfare of others.

The name Serug means "interwoven," "tendril," "strength." Serug
represents the budding, sprouting, and development of spiritual "seed"
or Truth ideas deep down in the subconsciousness by way of preparation
for the saving work in the body. In the Serug phase of man's unfoldment
the work is done mostly in secret, with now and then just a ray of light
breaking through to consciousness.

The name Nahor signifies "angry," "passionate," "piercing," "slaying."
Nahor denotes the piercing and breaking up of the sense consciousness
hitherto unpenetrated by Truth so that the way may be opened for a new
line of thought activity (Abram). This activity may be more of the
subconscious than of the conscious mind. Much turmoil often accompanies
this inner first breaking up of lesser ideals because of the efforts of
the outer, limited, emotional self ("angry," "passionate").

The name Haran means "strong," "mountaineer," "exalted." Haran
symbolizes an exalted state of mind, wherein Truth is lifted up in
consciousness and the individual is strengthened in his determination to
go on toward fuller spiritual enlightenment and upliftment.

(For Abram, Sarai, Terah, and Lot see interpretation of Gen. 12. For
Canaan see the interpretation of Gen. 10.)

The name Ur (of the Chaldees) signifies "light."

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

"Orient," "brightness or brilliance," "fire or blaze." Ur therefore
symbolizes the activity of the understanding or intelligence in man; the
inner spiritual part of man's being, whence true light shines forth into
the entire consciousness.

The name Milcah means "queen," "rule," "counsel." Milcah symbolizes the
soul in the act of expressing dominion, wisdom, good judgment.

The name Iscah signifies "who looks upon," "scans abroad," "discerns."
Iscah represents the soul in the act of being attentive to the things of
Spirit.
