###  Chapter X The Spiritual Gains Precedence of the Mental Genesis 32, 33, 34, 35, and 36 

MAN DEVELOPS his faculties in an orderly manner when he looks to Divine
Mind as the one and only guide. But he does not always seek this inner
wisdom, and the result is a disorderly development. Jacob represents the
mind in man that directs the physical body (Esau) in all its acts. In
divine order Jacob should be born first--we should think before we
act--but we find that as a rule people do not reflect and then act, and
especially is this true among people who are in the first stages of
their race journey.

The natural man in his immature consciousness is moved by desire and not
by rational thinking. He seeks to satisfy appetite regardless of higher
law and sells his birthright for a mess of pottage. When understanding
(Jacob) takes the ascendancy, there is an entire change. Jacob went
toward Haran ("enlightened," "mountainous"). The significance of this
sentence is that when we let our meditations and blessings fall on the
"knowing" part of ourselves (Jacob instead of Esau) we go into a higher
mental state or an exalted condition of mind, wherein we receive a
higher and clearer conception of things spiritual.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 32:1, 2. And Jacob went on his way, and  
</span>

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

the angels of God met him. And Jacob said when he saw them,  
This is God's host: and he called the name of the place  
Mahanaim.  

</div>

The name Mahanaim means "two camps," "two hosts," "companies." In the
individual consciousness Mahanaim represents spiritual ideas and the
physical realm ("two hosts"). This idea is brought out very clearly in
the naming of the place by Jacob. The "two hosts" are the angels of God
(messengers of God: spiritual ideas) on the one hand, and Jacob and his
company, his wives, children, and possessions (manifestations of ideas)
on the other.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 32:3-28. And Jacob sent messengers before him
to Esau  
his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom. And  
he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord  
Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with  
Laban, and stayed until now: and I have oxen, and asses,  
and flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have  
sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.  
And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to  
thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and  
four hundred men with him. Then Jacob was greatly afraid  
and was distressed: and he divided the people that were  
with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels,  
into two companies; and he said, If Esau come to the one  
company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall  
escape. And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God  
of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return  
unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee  
good: I am not worthy of the least of all the  
lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast  
shown unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over  
this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.  
</span>

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from  
the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite  
me, the mother with the children. And thou saidst, I will  
surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the  
sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.  
And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he  
had with him a present for Esau his brother: two hundred  
she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty  
rams, thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and  
ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals. And he delivered  
them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself,  
and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a  
space betwixt drove and drove. And he commanded the  
foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and  
asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goeth  
thou? and whose are these before thee? then thou shalt say,  
They are thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my  
lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us. And he  
commanded also the second, and the third, and all that  
followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak  
unto Esau, when ye find him; and ye shall say, Moreover,  
behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will  
appease him with the present that goeth before me, and  
afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept  
me. So the present passed over before him: and he himself  
lodged that night in the company.  
And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his  
two hand-maids, and his eleven children, and passed over  
the ford of the Jabbok. And he took them, and sent them  
over the stream, and sent over that which he had. And Jacob  
was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the  
breaking of the day. And when he saw that he prevailed not  
against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the  
hollow of Jacob's thigh was  

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

strained, as he wrestled with him. And he said, Let me go,  
for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go,  
except thou bless me. And he said unto him, What is thy  
name? And he said, Jacob. And he said, Thy name shall be  
called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven  
with God and with men, and hast prevailed.  

</div>

Edom was the name of the country where Esau's descendants lived. It
represents the outer man, the body, or the carnal, physical phase of
man's consciousness and organism. The significance of Seir is virtually
the same as that of Edom. Seir apparently designates especially the
emotional and stormy yet deep-seated carnal tendencies in the physical.

The Jordan ("flowing of judgment") may be said to represent that place
in consciousness where we are willing to meet the results of our
thoughts face to face and understandingly and courageously to pass
judgment on all thoughts.

In the soul's unfoldment the higher faculties forge ahead, establish
states of consciousness, and gather possessions of substance that must
afterward be distributed to the lower faculties. Jacob represents the
soul that has become rich in ideas. A time comes when an equalizing
process begins and the body (Esau) must be given some of the riches of
the soul.

Until love has done its perfect work man is fearful. Jacob feared to
meet Esau. We find it hard to face the full claims of the body (Esau)
after we have cheated it of its birthright, unity of soul and body in
spiritual thought. Divine courage must supplant this fear before we are
equal to facing the consequences of our self-centered thoughts and to
taking up the task of harmonizing

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

all our forces. But the vital power of Spirit animates the body, and it
responds readily to our true thought when we give it of our substance.

The soul does not like to enter into struggles to overcome material
habits, but it is necessary that it do so. The name of the ford where
Jacob wrestled with the angel means "wrestling," and the inference is
that it was hard for Jacob to put aside the things that he loved and to
enter alone into the invisible to wrestle with the forces of the
subconsciousness or sense consciousness in darkness. This struggle with
the physical is illustrated in the overcoming by Jesus in the garden of
Gethsemane. The error is "pressed out" and the rich oil of reality
saved.

The life in the subconsciousness has several planes of action. In the
deep recesses of the nerves it sends its energy to and fro, coming to
the surface here and there in flesh-and-blood sensation. There is a
strong man down there about whom the average person knows little. He
lives so far below the plane of common consciousness that the great
majority of men go through their whole life without making his
acquaintance. This man is pure nature, the foundation of the body.
Without him man could not take form, and it is his tenacity that keeps
our organism intact. He belongs to nature and is universal; hence when
the individual attempts to control him and to lift him up, there is
resistance, and a severe struggle with him is inevitable. "The flesh
lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh."

The mind controls the body through the thoughts acting on the nerves.
The sciatic nerve runs down the leg through the hollow of the thigh, and
the will

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

acts directly through this nerve. When the intellect (Jacob) exercises
its power in the effort to control the natural man within, there follows
a letting go of human will--Jacob's thigh is out of joint. A great light
of understanding breaks in on the struggling soul, of which the
intellect is a part, when it discovers that there is a divine-natural
body, and it clings to that inner life and strength until it brings to
the surface the blessing of perpetual physical vigor. Jacob (intellect)
said, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless me." The blessing
carried with it a new name, Israel; one who has striven with God and
with men and has prevailed. "Israel" is one who is a prince and has
power as regards both God and man, the spiritual and the material.

We can appreciate why Jacob (the intellect) after this experience was
willing to make amends to Esau (the body), whom he had cheated and
neglected all these years. When the intellect or conscious mind realizes
and exercises its superior ability there is an intuitive feeling of
injustice and a fear of the results. An awareness of having disregarded
divine law coupled with inability to recall the cause of this fear
results in much mental concern. Persons who let the ambitious intellect
override the demands and rights of the body (Esau) eventually find
themselves afraid and anxious to make restitution to the body.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 32:29-32. And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell
me, I  
pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou  
dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. And Jacob  
called the name of the place Peniel: for, said he, I have  
seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. And the  
sun rose  
</span>

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his  
thigh. Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew  
of the hip which is upon the hallow of the thigh, unto this  
day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the  
sinew of the hip.  

</div>

Instead of Jacob being weaker, as his limp would indicate, he was
stronger, because he had made a spiritual adjustment between the higher
and the lower in his body consciousness. One can change one's attitude
toward the body and thus change the body itself by following the advise
of Paul: "Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind." Do not judge
by the appearance, do not call your body temple evil or corruptible
flesh; do not fall into the error of mortal mind. See in the body what
Jacob saw, the face of God; for it is ever the temple of the living God.

The name Peniel means "turned toward God," "face of God," "within the
presence of God." Peniel symbolizes the inner realization of the divine
presence, the realization of having met God face to face and of having
succeeded through prayer in attaining the divine favor and blessing that
have been sought.

(Penuel is the same name as Peniel and carries the same meaning and
symbology.)

The "children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the
hollow of the thigh, unto this day," as a reminder of a spiritual truth
that they may not understand now but will eventually.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 33:1-11. And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and
looked,  
and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred  
men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto  
Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. And he put the  
handmaids and their children  
</span>

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and  
Joseph hindermost. And he himself passed over before them,  
and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came  
near to his brother. And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced  
him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.  
And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the  
children; and said, Whose are these with thee? And he said,  
The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.  
Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and  
they bowed themselves. And Leah also and her children came  
near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and  
Rachel, and they bowed themselves, And he said, What  
meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said,  
To find favor in the sight of my lord. And Esau said, I  
have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.  
And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor  
in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch  
as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and  
thou wast pleased with me. Take, I pray thee, my gift that  
is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with  
me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he  
took it.  

</div>

Jacob, now become Israel, was reunited with Esau after he crossed the
ford Jabbok ("wrestling"). The universal law of the unity of all things
was fulfilled. The way in which the mind (Israel) projects its thoughts
toward the body (Esau) is symbolized by the way in which Rachel and her
children, Leah and her children, and the handmaids with their children
were presented to Esau. The handmaids were presented first because they
represent physical thoughts. Leah and her children, presented next,
represent intellectual thoughts. Rachel (most beloved) and her son
Joseph

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

were presented last because they represent the more spiritual thoughts.
Then Jacob himself "passed over before them, and bowed himself to the
ground seven times, until he came near to his brother." This means that
the intellect recognizes the body as its equal and the body's well-being
as necessary to harmonious existence. In his spiritual self man must
give his body place as a divine creation and co-operate with it in his
evolution.

The body always obeys the conscious or subconscious behests of the mind.
"Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and
kissed him: and they wept." He rufused at first to accept the proffered
gifts of Jacob. The body at first feels its own completeness and resists
the rich ideas that the mind has developed in its unfoldment. Jacob
(illumined intellect) said, "Receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as
I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God."

Job says, "In my flesh shall I see God." (A.V.) Jesus said, "He that
hath seen me hath seen the Father." The mind must ideate the body as God
substance. This will raise the body to the higher consciousness of its
innate divinity. The I AM does not make spiritual union with the body
until it sees it as the pure and holy temple of God.

The gifts that Jacob gave to Esau represent the innate abilities that
are wrapped up in the body and that can be expressed only through union
with the mind. Persons who are skilled in exercises of agility and
strength must have the will to win a contest before they are victorious,
and trainers are giving more and more attention and assigning ever
greater importance to the mental state of their athletes.

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 33:12-16. And he said, Let us take our journey,
and  
let us go, and I will go before thee. And he said unto him,  
My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the  
flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they  
overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die. Let my  
lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will  
lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that  
are before me and according to the pace of the children,  
until I come unto my lord unto Seir. And Esau said, Let me  
now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And  
he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of  
my lord. So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.  
</span>

</div>

Here is a lesson in co-operation between mind and body. This unity is
essential not only to the development of the mental and the physical but
to the unfoldment of the spirit. The body is lifted up and the mind
strengthened when they work in unison. The children of the mind are the
new ideas ushering in the untried capacities of both mind and body. They
were now penetrating into the body consciousness (Seir) or the home of
the physical (Esau), where the mind will lay hold of the essential
physical elements and lift them up to a higher plane.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 33:17. And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and
built him a  
house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name  
of the place is called Succoth.  
</span>

</div>

The name Succoth means "interwoven," "booths," "tents." Booths or tents
represent temporary abiding places as compared with permanent houses.
Succoth represents the seeming temporary, carnal, material organism of
man, which is the fruit or manifestation of the belief that the
spiritually unawakened man holds

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

concerning his physical body. The abiding, spiritual body will come into
manifestation when man learns that he is wholly spiritual and that no
part of him, not even his body, is material and subject to corruption.
Spiritual, true thinking will transform the present material seeming and
will bring forth immortality, eternal life, throughout the whole man's
being.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 33:18-20. And Jacob came in peace to the city
of  
Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from  
Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city. And he bought  
the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the  
hand of the children of Hamor, Schechem's father, for a  
hundred pieces of money. And he erected there an altar, and  
called it El-Elohe-Israel.  
</span>

</div>

Jacob again entered the land of Canaan, as the Lord had promised he
should, and encamped there. His fears gone--he came in peace to
Shechem--he was free to pitch his tent wherever he pleased. So we,
studying his example, may overcome the self through the transforming
power of love. We may have a vision of the power of God indwelling, and
in the patience that this vision teaches us we may cease striving with
the personal self and henceforth strive only for the possession of the
eternal ideal. Thus we make a new name for ourselves, supplanting the
former natural self with the divine self. We find our new name written
on the white stone that no one else knows, for it is "I."

When love has preformed its work in his consciousness man ceases to
struggle against the seeming evils in the world without and turns his
attention to overcoming the inharmonies of the world within himself.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

"Ye have heard that it is said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth: but I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil . . . Ye have
heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine
enemy: but I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that
persecute you."

All through the Bible life is compared to a battle but not to war: "the
battle is Jehovah's." The Lord does not fight ignorance and evil; the
foundation of all existence being good, the law is constantly at work
reducing error to its exact stature. As man develops in consciousness,
both the soul and the body constantly become more refined under the law
of Spirit. This causes a seeming struggle sometimes with adverse
conditions, materiality, ignorance, and evil.

The city of Shechem in the land of Canaan is in the locality where Hamor
and his son Shechem dwelt. This is the consciousness into which Jacob
(illumined intellect) came. The children of Hamor ("stubborn," "dark,"
"ignorant") represent the earthly, carnal, state of mind. Shechem
represents a burden-bearing attitude of mind ("bending down," "a
burden"). The name El-Elohe-lsrael means "Elohe \[Elohim\], God of
Israel," "mighty God of Israel," "Elohim He of Israel." The altar
symbolizes the giving up of the "mind of the flesh" in individual
consciousness to make way for the spiritual so that the spiritual may
prevail throughout and God alone may be recognized. Thus Israel (the
true, spiritual thoughts, beliefs, and faculties) may indeed become a
prince, prevailing and ruling with God, having power with both God and
man; that is, having power for good in every phase of the consciousness,
from the very highest to the most material plane.

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 34:1-3. And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom
she bare  
unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. And  
Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the  
land, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and  
humbled her. And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of  
Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the  
damsel.  
</span>

</div>

The name Dinah means "justified," "avenged." Dinah represents the soul
side of or the feminine element in the judgment faculty in man, which
may be called intuition, the intuition of the natural man. The thought
of vengeance that is suggested in the name always comes to the natural
man in the process of judging; he is more likely to discern the error
side of a proposition than the true side. Dinah, representing this
feminine element, went out and mingled with the daughters of the land,
who were Hivites. The Hivites were descended from Canaan, son of Ham,
and represent the physical and carnal qualities in the individual. Any
unlawful relationship of thoughts or elements results in a heavy,
burdensome, attitude of mind (Shechem). Hamor represents a central or
ruling thought (he was a Hivite prince) in the carnal consciousness of
man.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 34:4-7. And Shechem spake unto his father
Hamor,  
saying, Get me this damsel to wife. Now Jacob heard that he  
had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his  
cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they  
came. And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob  
to commune with him. And the sons of Jacob came in from the  
field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and  
they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in  
Israel in lying with  
</span>

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.  

</div>

Shechem (burden-bearing thoughts), representing a belief in the reality
of the material and physical, sought to make his relationship with Dinah
(feminine, intuitional element) permanent. When Jacob's sons (the
offspring of the illumined intellect) discovered the unholy state of
affairs they were naturally grieved and angered.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 34:8-31. And Hamor communed with them, saying,
The  
soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray  
you, give her unto him to wife. And make ye marriages with  
us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters  
unto you. And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be  
before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you  
possessions therein. And Shechem said unto her father and  
unto her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what  
ye shall say unto me I will give. Ask me never so much  
dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say  
unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. And the sons of  
Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and  
spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, and said  
unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to  
one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto  
us. Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye  
will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;  
then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take  
your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we  
will become one people. But if ye will not hearken unto us,  
to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we  
will be gone.  
And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. And  
the young man deferred not to  
</span>

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter:  
and he was honored above all the house of his father. And  
Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,  
and communed with the men of their city, saying, These men  
are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the  
land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large  
enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for  
wives, and let us give them our daughters. Only on this  
condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to  
become one people, if every male among us be circumcised,  
as they are circumcised. Shall not their cattle and their  
substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent  
unto them, and they will dwell with us. And unto Hamor and  
unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the  
gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that  
went out of the gate of his city. And it came to pass on  
the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of  
Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his  
sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the  
males. And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the  
edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house,  
and went forth. The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and  
plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.  
They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and  
that which was in the city, and that which was in the  
field; and all their wealth, and all their little ones and  
their wives, took they captive and made a prey, even all  
that was in the house. And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi,  
Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants  
of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and,  
I bring few in number, they will gather themselves together  
against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my  
house. And they said, Should he deal with our sister as  
with a harlot?  

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

</div>

The whole purpose of Jacob (illumined intellect) in penetrating down
into the city of Shechem (materiality) in the land of Canaan (the
physical and carnal) was to lay hold of new vigor, vitality and
substance. Dinah represents the intuitive natural judgment that
determines virtue and law in the physical. When this intuitive natural
judgment is united with sense it loses its protective integrity, which
is resented by the related faculties on that plane of consciousness
(Dinah's brothers). A strict law of chastity is often observed even
among primitive people. They may be cannibals or head-hunters yet be
concerned for the preservation of the purity of their women. "And they
slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took
Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth."

The thought of judgment and punishment that is suggested in the name
Dinah is carried out in the action of Simeon and Levi in taking
vengeance for Dinah's disgrace on Shechem and his people. As man becomes
more spiritual in his ideas of judgment, thoughts of revenge,
punishment, and evil are eliminated from his mind and he sees the love,
mercy, and goodness of God instead.

(On the subject of circumcision see interpretation of Gen. 17:9-14.)

The Canaanites represent the elemental life forces in the
subconsciousness.

The Perizzites were inhabitants of Canaan and, like the Canaanites,
represent the fundamental life element in the organism, only elevated to
a more exalted plane by the outer, personal man and more strongly
entrenched in the sense consciousness of the individual.

Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God,  
who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of  
Esau thy brother. Then Jacob said unto his household, and  
to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that  
are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your  
garments: and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I  
will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the  
day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I  
went. And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which  
were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears;  
and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. And  
they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities  
that were round about them, and they did not pursue after  
the sons of Jacob. So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the  
land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people  
that were with him. And he built there an altar, and called  
the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed unto  
him, when he fled from the face of his brother.  
</span>

</div>

God commanded Jacob to arise (lift up his thoughts) and go unto Beth-el
("house of God"). After a progressive soul has passed through such an
experience as the one recorded in the preceding chapter, this soul feels
the need of and affirms the cleansing, purifying, and uplifting power of
the word and resolves to keep its face turned more steadfastly toward
the light. The foreign gods here referred to supposedly are little
images (made of a material substance such as clay or iron) representing
ideas. The rings symbolize ornaments in which a vain and frivolous soul
delights.

All these relics of the country they were leaving were now to be cast
out of the conscious mind. The change of garments represents a change of
thoughts.

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

The name Luz means "turning away," "departing," "a shrub bearing nuts."
Luz indicates separation. It also carries with it the idea of substance
and strength ("a shrub bearing nuts") of a more or less material
character. When Jacob realized the omnipresence of God he changed the
name of Luz to Beth-el ("house of God"). (See interpretation of Gen.
28:18-22.)

On the occasion of this, Jacob's second journey to Luz, he set up an
altar and called the place El-beth-el, which means "toward Beth-el;
strength of the house of God." It symbolizes the revelation from within
that the true origin of man is spiritual, that God dwells in man and
reveals Himself when man comes to the place in consciousness where he is
willing to give up the lower for the higher (builds an altar to
Jehovah). Man is the house (temple) of God, and he is greatly
strengthened when he perceives this truth.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 35:8. And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she
was  
buried below Beth-el under the oak; and the name of it was  
called Allon-bacuth.  
</span>

</div>

Rebekah represents the soul's natural delight in the beautiful. The name
of Deborah means "a bee." The name Allon-bacuth means "oak of weeping."
Weeping is an expression of emotion, a negative condition, a letting go
throughout the organism. Rebekah's nurse Deborah represents the quality
of the soul by virtue of which it serves instinctively and is guided by
discrimination and judgment. In mixed states of consciousness, where
error seems strongest, Spirit can lead by following the guidance of
instinct. Deborah was buried below Bethel ("house of God") under the oak
(the protection of Spirit).

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

Allon-bacuth ("oak of weeping") represents the inner strengthening of
the true man that comes when, in trying to serve, he lets go of the
outer personal activities and goes within to the source of all strength
and true energy (the oak) and rests there in God.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 35:9-15. And God appeared unto Jacob again,
when he  
came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. And God said unto  
him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any  
more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his  
name Israel. And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be  
fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations  
shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;  
and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I  
will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the  
land. And God went up from him in the place where he spake  
with him. And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he  
spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a  
drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon. And Jacob  
called the name of the place where God spake with him,  
Beth-el.  
</span>

</div>

The foregoing incident left an idelible impression on Jacob's mind, and
he counted it as a great spiritual experience and set up a stone as a
pillar in commemoration of it.

The name Aram means "high," "exalted," and Aram denotes the intellect.
The name Paddan means "field," "tableland." Paddan-aram represents
substance lifted to a broad, level place in the intellectual thought of
the individual. This incident in the life of Jacob has much in common
with an earlier one. (See interpretation of Gen. 28:18-22).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 35:16-21. And they journeyed from Beth-el; and
there  
was still some distance to come to  
</span>

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor. And  
it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the  
midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have  
another son. And it came to pass, as her soul was departing  
(for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his  
father called him Benjamin. And Rachel died, and was buried  
in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem). And Jacob  
set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of  
Rachel's grave unto this day. And Israel journeyed, and  
spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.  

</div>

Ephrath is the original name of the town of Bethlehem. Ephrath
represents a realization of abundant substance, this increase of
substance ideas in consciousness bringing about a corresponding
fruitfulness, abundance, throughout one's life and affairs.

The last of the sons of Jacob was born after his return to Canaan. The
death of Rachel and birth of Benjamin represent the transition of a
potential soul quality from the subjective to the objective plane of
consciousness. Rachel ("ewe," "lamb") represents the pure, innocent,
potentially spiritual soul that is a composite of faith, love, power,
and the like. It is through Jacob (the intellect) that these qualities
are made objective, and when this comes to pass there is temporary
sorrow ("son of my sorrow"), followed by rejoicing at the realization of
the birth of the new power that has come through the transition ("son of
my right hand"). "A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because
her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she
remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the
world."

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

The name Eder means "troop," "flock." The tower called Eder, beyond
which Israel (Jacob) journeyed and spread his tent, symbolizes the
gathering of thoughts of dominion and rulership (Israel means "rulership
with God") and the raising of them to a higher degree of understanding;
lifting them to a spiritual level by realizing that power and dominion
come from God.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 35:22. And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt
in that  
land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's  
concubine: and Israel heard of it.  
</span>

</div>

All these illustrations show that the divine law must be observed in
developing the faculties. Reuben's laying with Bilhah evidently
symbolizes an abortive attempt of man's perception of Truth (Reuben) to
develop them through an illegitimate union with a negative element
(Bilhah: "bashfulness," "timidity"). That there is no record of any
progeny from this union indicates that it was not in divine order.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 35:23-26. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
the sons  
of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi,  
and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun; the sons of Rachel:  
Joseph and Benjamin; and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's  
handmaid: Dan and Naphtali; and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's  
handmaind: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that  
were born to him in Paddan-aram.  
</span>

</div>

Leah ("weary," "exhausted") represents the human soul. She became the
mother of six sons:

Reuben, whose name means "behold a son," "vision of the son," represents
faith in its aspect of discernment, of sight in the outer. Reuben like
Simeon bespeaks understanding.

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

Simeon, whose name means "hearkening," "obeying," represents the
bringing forth of hearing; receptivity.

Levi, whose name signifies "joining," "clinging," represents the love
faculty in human consciousness.

The name Judah means "praise Jehovah." Judah symbolizes the prayer and
praise faculty in consciousness.

The name Issachar means "he will bring reward," "who brings recompense."
Issachar represents active zeal.

The name Zebulun means "habitation," "dwelling." Zebulun represents the
order faculty.

Rachel ("ewe," "lamb") symbolizes the spiritual soul. She became the
mother of Joseph and Benjamin.

The name Joseph means "Jehovah shall increase." Joseph represents the
imagination.

The name Benjamin means "son of good fortune." Benjamin represents an
active, accomplishing faith.

Bilhah ("bashfulness," "timidity") represents a tendency toward
self-abasement. She bore Jacob two sons, Dan and Naphtali:

Dan ("a judge") symbolizes the faculty of judgment.

Naphtali ("my wrestling") represents the power of elimination.

Zilpah ("distilling," "dropping," "leaking") represents the unfolding
soul of man in the phase of its awakening to spiritual thought, marked
by hesitation and lack of perseverance; too much of the human is
expressed and much of the good is dissipated (leaking). Zipah's two sons
were Gad and Asher.

Gad ("fortunate," "good fortune") represents the

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

faculty of power, but still mostly on the personal plane.

Asher ("straightforward") symbolizes the faculty of understanding.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 35:27, 28. And Jacob came unto Isaac his father
to  
Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham

</span>

</div>

And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years. And Isaac gave
of the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full
of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.

Kiriath-arba ("city of Arba") represents the tendency of the sense mind
to attribute strength, power, knowledge, and greatness to the outer
formed world rather than to Spirit. Kiriath-arba was the old name of
Hebron, which represents an association of ideas.

Mamre signifies a consciousness of substance and riches.

The death of Isaac represents the passing or giving up of that phase of
the individual consciousness which has to do with the pleasures of the
natural man; or its sinking back into the subconsciousness (giving up of
the ghost).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 36:1-5. Now these are the generations of Esau
(the  
same is Edom). Esau took his wives of the daughters of  
Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and  
Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the  
Hivite, and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of  
Nebaioth. And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare  
Reuel; and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah:  
these are the sons of Esau, that were born unto him in the  
land of Canaan.  
</span>

</div>

Metaphysically Esau symbolizes the body or physical vigor. He took wives
from among the daughters of

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

Canaan ("lowland"), which represents the body consciousness.

His first wife was Adah ("beauty," "comeliness," "adornment,"
"ornament," "pleasure"), who represents a phase of the human soul or
love nature. Love, even in its limited expression in personal
consciousness, adorns a person with a certain beauty of character and a
grace and comeliness not found in those lacking in love.

Another of Esau's wives was Oholibamah, whose name means "tent of the
high place," "my tabernacle is exalted." Oholibamah was the
granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite.

The name Zibeon means "wild robber," and the Hivites represent thoughts
belonging to the carnal consciousness in man. Oholibamah signifies the
lifting up and exalting of materiality by the carnal phase of the soul.

Another of his wives was Basemath, whose name means "fragrant," "sweet,"
"pleasant." Basemath represents the soul or feminine element in man in
the fineness of its ability to perceive or receive intuitively.

Adah bore to Esau a son, Eliphaz, whose name means "God is
purification," "God is dispenser," "God of strength."

Basemath bore Reuel, whose name signifies "led of God," "shepherded of
God," "companion of God." Reuel denotes a thought of divine guidance and
care; also a sense of mutual understanding, comradeship, fellowship
existing between God and man.

Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam and Korah.

The name Jeush means "he will bring together." Jeush represents strong,
unifying, attracting, accumulating

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

thoughts in consciousness; also the final lifting up and unifying of the
entire man in spiritual life and wholeness. The name Jalam means "whom
God hides."

The name Korah means "ice," "bald." Korah denotes the coldness, the
crystallization ("ice"), and the barrenness (baldness) of consciousness
that result from dominance of the "mind of the flesh" (Esau) in the
individual.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 36:6-12. And Esau took his wives, and his sons,
and  
his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his  
cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which  
he had gathered in the land of Canaan; and went into a land  
away from his brother Jacob. For their substance was too  
great for them to dwell together; and the land of their  
sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle.  
And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.  
And these are the generations of Esau the father of the  
Edomites in mount Seir: these are the names of Esau's sons:  
Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of  
Basemath the wife of Esau. And the sons of Eliphaz were  
Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. And Timna was  
concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz  
Amalek: these are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife.  
</span>

</div>

The original separation between mind (Jacob) and body (Esau) was caused
by the cunning mind taking advantage of the stupid body; also the lusts
and weaknesses of the body appetite played their part. Here is
illustrated a further separation because of the physical possessions of
Esau. Those who cultivate the physical grow physically and require so
much room that the mental is crowded out, and they exalt the things of
the flesh. Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. The name Seir means "shaggy,"
"rough," "tempestuous," "hairy," pointing

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

to the deep-seated emotions in carnal consciousness. Eventually the two
states of consciousness represented by Jacob and Esau must be merged.

(For Eliphaz and Basemath see the interpretation of Gen. 36:3, 4.)

The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.

The name Teman means "prosperity," "abundance," "good faith." Teman
denotes the realm of the subconsciousness, with its inherently rich
stores of substance and good. Here this realm is under the influence of
the Esau-Edom state of mind in the individual; in other words, under the
influence of material thought. Omar represents the ability of the outer
man to receive the higher Truth ideals ("mountaineer," "summit") and to
express them ("bringing forth," "bearing into the light"). The name
Zepho (Zephi) means "outlook," "watchtower." Zepho represents an
expectant state of mind that seemingly belongs to the outer or physical
man but whose desire is toward Spirit.

The name Gatam means "puny," "exhausted," and the like. (Eliphaz, father
of Gatam, represents an active thought of strength.) Strength is from
God, while that represented by Eliphaz is of the physical consciousness
and does not lay hold of the truth about strength. The meanings
attributed to Gatam's name --"puny," "greatest fatigue," "burned
field"--clearly indicate the results of believing in material strength.
Until man realizes that his strength is spiritual it cannot become
abiding, unfailing, and enduring.

The name Kenaz means "spear thrower," "lancer," "archer," "hunter." A
"hunter," in the sense of a

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

Kenaz, denotes a thought that is connected with the animal forces of the
organism. Kenaz symbolizes the thought of man engrossed in the animal
phase of his nature, in animal strength and activity ("spear thrower,"
"lancer," "archer").

Timna was Eliphaz's concubine. Timna represents a restricting, curbing
influence ("withheld," "restrained," "forbidden") that is ever at work
in the soul of man and in his body consciousness. If there were no
restraint on the carnal mind in man and its activities, man would
destroy himself utterly.

Timna bore Amalek, whose name means "warlike," "dweller in the vale,"
"that licks up or consumes." Amalek symbolizes lust, the base desire
that, once established in the animal forces of the subconscious mind of
man, is the begetter of destructive, rebellious, perverted appetites and
passions. Amalek's father was Eliphaz, whose name means "God of
strength," "God is purification." Thus desire at its origin is good and
is of God; but when it is misinterpreted by the carnal man it becomes
lust (Amalek).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 36:13. And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath,
and  
Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of  
Basemath, Esau's wife.  
</span>

</div>

(For Reuel see interpretation of Gen. 36:4.)

Reuel's first son was Nahath, who represents one of the prevailing
beliefs of the outer man at a certain period of his unfoldment: restful,
lulling, contentment ("resting," "quieting") in his seemingly material
type of expression ("lowness"). However higher thoughts must be
introduced into even the outer consciousness of man if he is to be
aroused out of the false lethargy

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

of the carnal and to be quickened throughout his whole spirit, soul, and
body to the Truth of his being.

The name of another son, Zerah, means "sunrise," "germination of a
seed." "splendor." Zerah denotes the rise of new light or understanding
in the consciousness; the first conscious awakening to the presence of
this new inner light or understanding. (The sun rises in the east; and
the east signifies the within.)

Shammah, a third son, represents a destructive, fearful tendency in
consciousness that leads to inharmonies of mind and body. The outer man,
apart from the dominion of Spirit, is very likely to swing from one
extreme to the other, from the height of noble thinking and feeling
("fame," "renown") to the depths of fear, desolation, emptiness, and
error. By consciously laying hold of the Christ Truth and making it
practical in his life, this outer man must come into a better balance,
greater stability and poise.

Mizzah, the fourth son, represents a steady tearing down and wearing
away of the consciousness and organism ("flowing down,"
"disintegration," "exhaustion") as the result of fear, fear being one of
the most subtle and destructive errors that the carnal mind in man
contains. The destructive element is redeemed through divine love, which
knows only the good.

</div>

The Horites were very closely connected with the Edomites, the
descendants of Esau. They were inhabitants of the land of Mount Seir
before they were overcome by Esau. After that they lived in the land
with the Edomites.

Metaphysically the Horites, like the Edomites, represent forces having
their seat of action in the physical organism. The Horites denote more
especially the deep-seated, subconscious errors (cave dwellers) and
fleshly tendencies and activities of the physical in man, while the
Edomites designate forces in the outer or body consciousness.

The name of Lotan, the son of Seir the Horite, means "covered,"
"secret," "dark." Metaphysically Lotan represents a secret, hidden,
ignorant ruling thought in the realm in man symbolized by the Horites.

Shobal, the name of another son, means "way," "traveling." Each
individual is "traveling" the pathway of life. To a great extent the
race has been and still is "wandering" about in ignorance and darkness
as to the true source of man's being. The "way" that each takes in his
thoughts, beliefs, and expressions determines whether that which he
brings forth shall be the fruit of the "mind of the flesh" or the fruit
of the Spirit ("growing," "producing ears," "rain").

The name Zibeon means "immersed," "ravenous

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

preyer," "wild robber," "dyed." Metaphysically Zibeon symbolizes a wild,
lawless sense thought that has the capacity of adapting itself to the
varying ideas and moods of the individual, and that thus remains in his
consciousness (until it is cast forth by Truth), robbing his body of its
energy and substance.

The name Anah means "answering." Metaphysically Anah denotes error
tendencies or strongly influencing thoughts deep within the subjective
life forces in the individual consciousness that cause these life forces
to respond to the desires of the flesh or sense man ("answering")
instead of listening to Spirit. (The Hivites and the Horites were
descendants of Canaan, son of Ham; they were hostile to the Israelites
in the Promised Land, and they had to be destroyed.)

The name Dishon means "fatness," "opulence," "fertile," "ashes."
Metaphysically Dishon symbolizes richness and seeming fertility on the
physical plane.

The name Ezer means "envelop," "help," "unite," "treasure."
Metaphysically Ezer symbolizes man's innate belief in a substance, a
wisdom ("treasure"), an established oneness with All-Good (unity), and a
power to aid and to protect ("envelop," "help") that comes from
something higher, stronger, and more real and lasting than sense
consciousness can give.

The name Dishan means virtually the same thing as Dishon. Metaphysically
Dishan represents a very active, rich, or fertile controlling thought
belonging to the Horite consciousness in the individual.

The children of Lotan were Hori and Heman.

The name Hori means "cave dweller," "imprisoned," "black."
Metaphysically Hori denotes thoughts belonging to the depths of the
subconsciousness ("cave

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

dweller"), or a person wholly given over to the error beliefs signified
by the Horites.

The name Heman means "lasting," "faithful," "trustworthy." Heman
represents thoughts full of faith and trust in God. Great wisdom and
harmony are the result of these thoughts.

The children of Shobal were Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and
Onam.

The name Alvan means "tall," "sublime." Metaphysically Alvan denotes a
lofty concept on the part of man in regard to the sensual or physical
phase of his organism, whereby he glimpses the truth that even the outer
man has his origin in Spirit.

The name Manahath means "resting," "restoring," "forsaking."
Metaphysically Manahath designates a peaceful, restful thought and place
in consciousness; a ceasing from outer activity, wherein both soul and
body are nenewed, and wherein something of error is forsaken and a
degree of Truth is realized.

The name Ebal means "stripped of all," "bare," "barren," "stone."
Metaphysically Ebal represents the adverse activity of the law in those
who think and act out of harmony with divine principle; that in us which
takes cognizance of the working out of error resulting from ignorance
and disobedience. This phase of the activity of the law always seems
hard ("stone") to the sense consciousness upon which it falls, and it
surely exposes ("bares") the nothingness of all that does not measure up
to the spiritual.

The name Shepho means "nakedness," "barren," "wasted away,"
"unconcerned." Metaphysically Shepho denotes a mental activity in the
body consciousness that is wholly "unconcerned" with the things of
Spirit,

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

hence is unfruitful and "naked" in so far as real life, strength,
wholeness, substance, and good are concerned ("nakedness," "barren"
"wasted away").

The name Onam means "vigorous," "powerful," "wealthy," "substantial."
Metaphysically Onam denotes thoughts pertaining to strength and vigor;
also to understanding and substance. He represents a belief in purely
physical strength and power, outer possessions, and the carnal thought
of understanding.

The children of Zibeon were Aiah and Anah.

The name Aiah means "a cry," "a clamor," "a vulture." Metaphysically
Aiah denotes destructive, devouring thoughts pertaining to the animal
consciousness and to what should be the higher thought realm in the
individual ("a cry," "a clamor," and so on).

The name Anah means "answering." (For further comment see interpretation
of Gen. 36:20).

The children of Anah were Dishon and Oholibamah. (For Dishon see
interpretation of Gen. 36:21; for Oholibamah, Gen. 36:2.)

The children of Dishon were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, Cheran.

The name Hemdan means "desirable," "pleasant," "precious."
Metaphysically Hemdan represents the seemingly "desirable" and
"pleasant" sense beliefs and activities of one who is not awakened
spiritually. These beliefs and activities however are but transitory and
soon turn to dust and ashes, to vanity and vexation of spirit.

The name Eshban means "man of wisdom," "man of understanding," "son of
fire." Metaphysically Eshban represents the belief held by the outer man
that wisdom and understanding come through the perceptions

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

of the senses, and through reasoning.

The name Ithran means "abundant," "excellent," "plenty," Metaphysically
Ithran represents ideas of great "excellence" and of great value;
thoughts that are superior to their fellows, being active both in the
deep-seated sense consciousness (Horites) in the individual and on the
more spiritual level of his mind (the Israelites). These are ideas that
have taken on abundant substance, they involve belief in bountiful
supply, and they lead to "plenty."

The name Cheran means "lyre," "united," "a joyous shout." Metaphysically
Cheran denotes a harmonious, unifying thought that is active in the
depths of the physical being of man ("united," "lyre"). Since this
thought is not consciously united with Spirit, though its origin and
tendency are good, it cannot bring about the perfect union of man with
God and the true spiritual harmony implied by the meaning of the name.

The children of Ezer were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.

The name Bilhan means "confused," "weak," "tender." Metaphysically
Bilhan represents a "confused" state of mind and a lack of
self-assertion ("weak") that are the result of a giving way to the
fulfillment of the thoughts and desires of the unredeemed
subconsciousness.

The name Zaavan means "disquieted," "trembling," "terrified."
Metaphysically Zaavan denotes a confused, fearful, unstable thought
tendency in the outer or body consciousness of the individual.

The name Akan means "warped," "keen of vision." Metaphysically Akan
represents a ruling thought, or

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

at least a very strong influential thought, in the sense consciousness.
This thought aids in diverting the individual from Truth and causes much
trouble in the flesh. It is quick to perceive ("keen") on the sense
plane but is blind ("warped") to the real truth of man's being.

The children of Dishan were Uz and Aran.

The name Uz means "substantiation," "formative power," "purpose,"
"fertility." Metaphysically Uz denotes the process of thought by which
man arrives at a conclusion (be it Truth or error) and establishes it in
consciousness ("substantiation," and so forth).

The name Aran means "active," "a wild goat," "firmness." Metaphysically
Aran represents aggressiveness and a firmness or obstinacy of thought
that is untrained and undisciplined and is guided not by understanding
but by outer desires ("a wild goat," "firmness"). This makes a place of
refuge for many of the sense ideas of man that should be overcome.

(For the names of the chiefs that came of the Horites--Lotan, Shobal,
Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan--see interpretation of Gen.
36:20, 21.)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 36:31-39. And these are the kings that reigned
in the  
land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the  
children of Israel. And Bela the son of Beor reigned in  
Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah. And Bela died,  
and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.  
And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temanites reigned  
in his stead. And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad,  
who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his  
stead: and the name of his city was Avith. And Hadad died,  
and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. And Samlah  
died,  
</span>

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead.  
And Shaul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in  
his stead. And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar  
reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and  
his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the  
daughter of Me-zahab.  

</div>

The name Bela means "destroy," "utterly consume." Metaphysically Bela
represents destructive tendencies in consciousness.

The name Dinhabah means "robbers' den," "place of plundering."
Metphysically Dinhabah signifies an aggregation of thoughts belonging to
man's outer, carnal consciousness. These thoughts are error; they build
up and sustain destructive sense tendencies that rob the real inner man
of the substance that is rightly his. The name Jobab means "howling of
wild beasts," "wail of tribulation." Metaphysically Jobab denotes the
noisy, contentious tumultuousness of the outer personal man while under
the dominion of the "mind of the flesh."

The name Husham means "hasting," "vehement," "passionate."
Metaphysically Husham represents the hurried attitude of mind as related
to satisfying physical desire. This attitude belongs to the outer
consciousness and tends to confusion and disorder.

The name Hadad means "quick," "might," "majesty." Metaphysically Hadad
represents the setting up as all-powerful of the intellect in its
spiritually unawakened state.

The name Samlah means "outer garment," "mantle," "clothed."
Metaphysically Samlah represents the general ruling characteristics of
the outer, mortal phase of consciousness in man represented also by
Edom.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

The name Shaul means "desired," "demanded," "inquiring," "excavating."
Shaul is a form of the name Saul, and its meaning is the same. Shaul
symbolizes the will in individual consciousness, the presonal will.

The name Baalhanan means "Baal is gracious," "possessor of compassion,"
"lord of mercy." Metaphysically Baalhanan represents grace, mercy, and
kindliness as belonging to and being expressed by the outer man ("Baal
is gracious," and so forth). All these God qualities are expressed in a
measure by the outer physical and mental man even before their true
origin is understood to be spiritual. Until man learns the Truth, he
usually takes to himself all the honor and glory resulting from any good
that he does, instead of ascribing all honor and glory to God, Divine
Mind.

The name Hadar, a form of the name Hadad, means "where one returns for
rest," "concealed inner chamber," "hidden principle." While Hadad
represents the setting up as all-powerful of the intellect in its
spiritually unawakened state, Hadar, in addition to that, represents the
"hidden principle" of all light, all wisdom, all knowledge (God, Spirit)
that exists back of the intellect, back of every expression of
intelligence or understanding.

Matred ("a short spear") and Mehetabel ("God benefits"), women of Edom,
represent activities in the soul's progress toward spiritual perfection.
Even the phase of the soul represented by Edom, the outer physical man,
has impulses that are uplifting and that are ever moving toward the more
perfect understanding and expression of Being.

Me-zahab, the name of Matred's father, means "water of gold,"
"emanations of the shining one." Me-zahab

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

represents a wisdom that is of the one light or sun, Spirit, though it
may be somewhat negative, as suggested by "water," "water of gold."
Matred represents a pushing or urging forward of the soul ("thrusting
forward"), by means of the wisdom symbolized by Me-zahab, to still
higher and clearer light and dominion ("a scepter"). Mehetabel, the
daughter of Matred ("to whom God does good," "God is the greatest good")
represents the further awakening of the human soul to the goodness of
God.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 36:40-43. And these are the names of the chiefs
that  
came to Esau, according to their families, after their  
places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief  
Jetheth, chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon, chief  
Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar, chief Magdiel, chief  
Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their  
habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau,  
the father of the Edomites.  
</span>

</div>

(For Timna see the interpretation of Gen. 36:12.)

The name Alvah means "sublimation (of evil)," "sublimity," "wicked."
Metaphysically Alvah represents the animal nature exalting
itself--"sublimation (of evil)." This is evil in the sight of Truth,
since true sublimity and exaltation come only from the unifying of the
entire being with the spiritual or Christ consciousness.

The name Jetheth means "securing," "stability," "subjection,"
Metaphysically Jetheth represents in the outer, material consciousness
of man a ruling belief in the use of force to compel, drive, suppress in
order to keep the individual steadfast. This of course is error and
leads to bondage instead of true freedom.

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

The name Elah means "terebinth," "oak," a name implying strength,
hardiness, and size. Metaphysically Elah represents the consciousness of
strength and protection that is based on material beliefs; hence a
limited consciousness, one likely to fail at the very time when most
needed.

The name Pinon means "darkness," "perplexity," "hopelessness."
Metaphysically Pinon represents the great anxiety, confusion, and
hopelessness that often come over the purely mortal, darkened
consciousness of man in times of error reaping.

The name Kenaz means "possessor," "lancer," "hunter," "flank." The name
Teman means "abundance," "good faith," "firm." (For further comment see
interpretation of Gen. 36:11.)

The name Mibzar means "inaccessible," "lofty," "impervious."
Metaphysically Mibzar represents ruling belief of the carnal mind in man
that the things of Spirit, of God, are hard to understand, that they are
so far removed from the apparently finite mind of man that they are
unattainable.

The name Magdiel means "most precious fruits of God," "praise of God,"
"God is renowned." Metaphysically Magdiel represents the truth about the
outer and seemingly material phase of man's being Esau and Edom). This
truth is that even man's physical body is the precious fruit of God. It
has its origin in Spirit and is innately spiritual. It must eventually
express and manifest God, Spirit, thus giving all praise, honor, and
glory to the Father-Mind, through which it came into existence ("God is
renowned").
