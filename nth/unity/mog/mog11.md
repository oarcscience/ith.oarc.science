###  Chapter IX Lesson Nine Man Develops Spiritual Faculties Genesis 29, 30, and 31 

AN ALLEGORY is a description of one thing under the image of another. It
suggests but does not specifically state a meaning. A key to its
interpretation is necessary, and this is usually given in the proper
names that are used. By the employment of such symbols the Bible
describes man in his wholeness, spirit, soul, and body. The names of
men, places, tents, temples in every case have a meaning relative to the
character of man. Mental states are thus described, and it is important
that the individual who seeks spiritual wisdom for his regeneration
shall be able to understand the allegory by use of the key hidden in the
names.

An example of this is the name Jacob, which means "supplanter," one who
gradually supplants and takes the place of the natural man in the
consciousness of the individual and of the race. To accomplish this
great work it is necessary that the individualized I AM shall have
certain experiences and develop certain faculties essential to the
higher-type man that is to follow.

Mystics tell us that man passes through twelve stages in his spiritual
development. Each of these is a particular state of consciousness
developed by a presiding ego or faculty. The last and highest state of
consciousness is that complete, twelve-sided spiritual character
attained by Jesus. This final attainment of the

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

twelvefold man reveals the spiritual man, the image and likeness created
in the beginning. These states may all be active in the individual
consciousness at the same time, but the dominant one will indicate the
point the person has reached in his development.

Jacob was overdeveloped intellectually and robbed his body (Esau) of its
rightful heritage of life. This wrong was atoned for when he divided his
accumulated wealth with Esau. In the meantime he had developed the
spiritual side of his life and had brought forth a number of faculties
(sons).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 29:1-15. Then Jacob went on his journey; and
came to  
the land of the children of the east. And he looked, and,  
behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep  
lying there by it; for out of that well they watered the  
flocks: and the stone upon the well's mouth was great. And  
thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the  
stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put  
the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place. And  
Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they  
said, Of Haran are we. And he said unto them, Know ye Laban  
the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. And he said  
unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well:  
and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. And  
he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that  
the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,  
and go and feed them. And they said, We cannot, until all  
the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone  
from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep. While he  
was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's  
sheep; for she kept them. And it came to pass, when Jacob  
saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and  
the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went  
near, and rolled the stone from the  
</span>

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's  
brother. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice,  
and wept. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's  
brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and  
told her father.  
And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob  
his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced  
him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he  
told Laban all these things. And Laban said to him, Surely  
thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the  
space of a month. And Laban said unto Jacob, because thou  
art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for  
nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?  

</div>

Metaphysically interpreted, Jacob's journeying toward the east is a way
of saying that the illumined intellect is penetrating deeper into the
inner spiritual consciousness. The well of water symbolizes an innate
spiritual life capacity in the body consciousness. The three flocks of
sheep represent three states of physical existence, each on its own
plane expressing the innocent, obedient activity of life. The people
Jacob visits are living in Haran, the name of which means "strong,"
"exalted," "mountaineer"; the people being not necessarily spiritual but
having high ideals. Their concepts are limited in expression ("they put
the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place"). Laban represents
the unsophisticated natural man whose pure high ideals are expressed by
Rachel and Leah (they shepherd his sheep or thoughts). Jacob (related
through his mother to this divine-natural plane of consciousness) now
makes a closer contact that brings about prosperity for all concerned.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 29:16-30. And Laban had two daughters: the name
of the  
elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. And  
Leah's eyes were tender; but Rachel was beautiful and  
well-favored. And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will  
serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. And  
Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that  
I should give her to another man: abide with me. And Jacob  
served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but  
a few days, for the love he had to her.  
And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are  
fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. And Laban gathered  
together all the men of the place, and made a feast. And it  
came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his  
daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.  
And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah  
for a handmaid. And it came to pass in the morning that,  
behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this  
thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for  
Rachel? wherefore then has thou beguiled me? And Laban  
said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger  
before the first-born. Fulfil the week of this one, and we  
will give thee the other also for the service which thou  
shalt serve with me yet seven other years. And Jacob did  
so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his  
daughter to wife. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter  
Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid. And he went in also  
unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and  
served with him yet seven other years.  
</span>

</div>

When unselfish love touches the heart, self drops out of the mind. Love
in the heart lifts us out of the time limitations of sense consciousness
into the joy of the eternal present. When we forget ourselves in the
service of love, the selflessness of God takes possession

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

of our being. Yet the selfless man is ever the self-possessed man, such
is the paradox of spiritual law. The higher self in man loves the pure
natural soul (Rachel) and works joyously to possess it. The higher self
also loves the human part of the soul (Leah) with an objective love and
feeds it with the enduring substance of true thought. Jacob was true to
Leah. We can sustain the whole consciousness in health and unfailing
strength by recognizing it as the essence of invisible substance.

The love story of Jacob and Rachel is one of the most beautiful in all
literature. Jacob served her father seven years for her hand and was
then disappointed because he had to marry her elder sister Leah. He then
served seven more years for Rachel, which because of his great love for
her seemed but a few days.

The name Bilhah means "bashfulness," "timidity," "tenderness." Bilhah
represents a tendency of the soul toward self-abasement.

The name Zilpah means "distilling," "leaking." Zilpah symbolizes the
unfolding soul of man in which as yet too much of the human is in
evidence.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 29:31-35. And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated,
and he  
opened her womb: but Rachel was barren. And Leah conceived,  
and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she  
said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction; for  
now my husband will love me. And she conceived again, and  
bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I am  
hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she  
called his name Simeon. And he conceived again, and bare a  
son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto  
me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his  
name called  
</span>

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

Levi. And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she  
said, This time will I praise Jehovah: therefore she called  
his name Judah; and she left off bearing.  

</div>

The first child born to Leah was Reuben. At his birth she cried,
"Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction." The emphasis is on the word
looked, and we find that the name Reuben means "a son seen," "vision of
the son." Thus the mother revealed the character of the faculty
represented by the child, and this is likewise true in the case of each
of the sons.

The first faculty brought forth in man's spiritual development is
vision, the ability to discern the reality of Spirit that lies back of
every form or symbol in the material world. Like Jacob all Truth seekers
are anxious to develop faith (Benjamin) to remove mountains and
imagination (Joseph) to mold substance to their desires, but also like
Jacob they must bring forth the faculties of seeing, hearing, feeling,
praise, judgment, strength, power, understanding, zeal, and order on the
spiritual plane.

Simeon, the second son of Leah, represents hearing or, in a broader
sense, receptivity. When man is receptive to the inflow of Spirit
nothing can keep his good from him, and he is in a position to make
rapid strides in his development.

When Levi, the third son, was born, Leah exclaimed, "Now this time will
my husband be joined unto me." The emphasis is on the word joined. Levi
means "uniting," which in the body is feeling, in the soul compassion,
and in the spirit love. The faculty of love is the unifying principle in
consciousness. It connects our forces with that on which we

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

center our attention. When our attention is focused on Spirit, these
faculties become spiritualized. When we elevate love (Levi) to the plane
of Spirit (John), it draws to us all that the soul requires. When it is
kept on the lower plane as feeling or emotion it often leads to
selfishness, to indulgence, even to violence.

The fourth son of Jacob and Leah was Judah. In the Hebrew this name
means "praise Jehovah." In Spirit this is prayer and the faculty of
accumulating spiritual substance. In sense consciousness this faculty
becomes acquisitiveness, the desire to accumulate material things, and
if the self is dominant the faculty "hath a devil" (Judas).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 30:1-8. And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob
no  
children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto  
Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. And Jacob's anger  
was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's  
stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?  
And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that  
she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain children  
by her. And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and  
Jacob went in unto her. And Bilhah conceived, and bare  
Jacob a son. And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath  
also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore  
called she his name Dan. And Bilhah Rachel's handmaid  
conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. And Rachel  
said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my  
sister, and have prevailed: and she called his name  
Naphtali.  
</span>

</div>

Rachel and Bilhah represent soul attitudes. The name Rachel means
"journeying," "migrating," which indicates a transitory state. In this
instance Rachel was finding fault with Jacob (I AM). Such an attitude

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

thwarts the inflow of Spirit. This is why Rachel had not conceived.

Bilhah was modest and teachable, consequently receptive to Spirit. This
receptivity opens the door to spiritual inspiration, whose fruit is good
judgment (Dan) and strength of character (Naphtali). That there is a
close relation between the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of
strength is shown by the fact that the back becomes tired when thoughts
of the burdens of materiality are held. The realization that all
strength is primarily spiritual relieves this condition, and strength is
restored. ("Lo now, his strength is in his loins," says Job.) Man
retards his spiritual growth by his material thinking and his mental
clinging to the things of the world. The faculties of judgment and
strength find expression in the physical or more outer consciousness of
man, but their true origin is Spirit, and their spiritual nature and
spiritual activity are in due time established. The higher expression of
this faculty is symbolized by Jesus' apostle Andrew.

Jacob and his sons lived several hundred years before the time of Jesus,
hence represent the eariler stages of man's development. They were
natural men living by sense and emotion, yet possessing great spiritual
possibilities. In the same way our faculties in the first stages of
their unfoldment express themselves on the lower planes of sense. Like
everything else with which we have to deal, they have a physical, a
mental, and a spiritual side to bring into manifestation.

The faculties evolve on three planes. Jacob being a type of the
illumined mental, his sons especially portray ideals. By developing our
ideals we may attain to a high degree of human perfection. But before we
can

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

become anything more than human or mortal our faculties must be
spiritualized and put to work on the heavenly plane. Just as the sense
man has reached his present stage by the development of the senses, so
the divine man must evolve by the development of his spiritual powers.
The faculties involved are essentially the same, differing only as
regards the plane on which they are expressed, since body, soul, and
spirit are really one, and are separated only in consciousness.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 30:9-13. When Leah saw that she had left off
bearing,  
she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to  
wife. And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a son. And Leah  
said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad. And Zilpah  
Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a second son. And Leah said,  
Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she  
called his name Asher.  
</span>

</div>

Leah's maid Zilpah (whose name means "distilling," "extracting an
essence") was the mother of the next two sons, Gad and Asher. Gad
symbolizes power, which at this stage of development is on the personal
plane. Divine Mind gives man power over his thoughts and ideas and the
forces of the soul. In the higher consciousness this power is exercised
over the self and inner conditions rather than over other persons and
the world without. The higher expression is shown by the apostle Philip.

Asher symbolizes understanding, which corresponds to wisdom in the realm
of Spirit (Thomas). Through his knowing faculty man acquires a body of
knowledge by study and observation of the world without. Through the
same faculty he acquires wisdom by being

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

receptive to the Spirit within. Tennyson brings out this difference
clearly when he says, "Knowledge is earthly, of the mind; but wisdom is
heavenly, of the soul."

Jacob now had eight sons, four by Leah, two by Bilhah, and two by
Zilpah.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 30:14-21. And Reuben went in the days of
wheat  
harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them  
unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I  
pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. And she said unto her,  
Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband?  
and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And  
Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for  
thy son's mandrakes. And Jacob came from the field in the  
evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must  
come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son's  
mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. And God  
hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a  
fifth son. And Leah said, God hath given me my hire,  
because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called  
his name Issachar. And Leah conceived again, and bare a  
sixth son to Jacob. And Leah said, God hath endowed me with  
a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I  
have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.  
And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name  
Dinah.  
</span>

</div>

There is an interesting story in connection with the birth of the next
son. In the Oriental household where there were several wives there were
sure to be petty jealousies and naive intrigues. Jacob spent most of his
time with Rachel since she was his favorite. To get his attention Leah
bargained with Rachel to keep out of the way for a while, and as a
reward gave her some mandrakes or "love apples" that her son Reuben had

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

brought in to her. Leah had great zeal and was never discouraged by her
failure of her attempts to win Jacob's favor. When the child was born
she called him Issachar, a name meaning "there is reward."
Metaphysically he represents the faculty of zeal, active in substance
and in the body consciousness.

Zeal is a strong force, the urge behind all things and the impulse to
every achievement. It sets in motion all the machinery of the universe
to attain the object of its desire. It should be tempered with
understanding and love, else it becomes a destructive force. Even a
criminal may be zealous in his work.

The spiritual side of the zeal faculty is represented by the apostle
Simon the Canaanite.

It is worthy of note that Leah--metaphysically the human soul as
distinguished from the more advanced soul (Rachel)--was the mother of
six or one half of Jacob's sons. The last one she brought forth was
Bebulun (whose name means "habitation," "neighbor") and who symbolizes
the faculty of order. Order is the first law of the universe. Indeed
there could be no universe unless its various parts were kept in perfect
harmony. In the sense mind there is disorder, manifest in confusion of
thought and action, while in Divine Mind everything is perfect order.
Therefore it is most important, if we are to survive at all, that our
thoughts be put in order and kept in harmony with divine intelligence.

Even in the small details of life, such as dress, conversation, eating,
sleeping, and working, system and order enables one to live a richer and
fuller life. But only in divine order can be found the life abundant and
eternal. This order is established in our body and

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

affairs when we live up to the higher convictions of our being under the
guidance of spiritual understanding. No man-made law can be strong,
true, or exact enough to insure perfect order. Only when man becomes
conscious of who and what he is can he exercise his God-given dominion
and bring his life into line with the principle of divine order, which
is mind, idea, and manifestation. The apostle James, son of Alphaeus,
symbolizes order on the spiritual plane.

The name Dinah, the daughter of Leah and Jacob, means "judged,"
"justified," "acquitted," "avenged." Dinah represents the soul side or
feminine aspect of the judgment faculty in man; it might be called
intuition, the intuition of the natural man.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 30:22-25. And God remembered Rachel, and God
hearkened  
to her, and opened her womb. And she conceived, and bare a  
son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach: and she  
called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another  
Son.  
And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that  
Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine  
own place, and to my country.  
</span>

</div>

During all this time Jacob had been serving his father-in-law Laban in
the country of Haran. This was a high or mountainous place and
metaphysically denotes the high state of consciousness in which the
individual is strengthened and given the determination to go forward to
spiritual enlightenment and full development. Eleven of Jacob's sons
were born in Haran, the last of whom was Joseph, the child of Rachel,
the beloved. In the high state of spiritual consciousness man develops
the faculties from the simple one of seeing

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

to that of imagination, the faculty represented by Joseph.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 30:26-43. Give me my wives and my children for
whom I  
have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my  
service wherewith I have served thee. And Laban said unto  
him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I  
have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake. And  
he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it. And he  
said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how  
thy cattle have fared with me. For it was little which thou  
hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a  
multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I  
turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house  
also? And he said, What shall I give thee? and Jacob said,  
Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing  
for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it. I will  
pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence  
every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among  
the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:  
and of such shall be my hire. So shall my righteousness  
answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my  
hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled  
and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep,  
that, if found with me, shall be counted stolen. And Laban  
said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.  
And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked  
and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and  
spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black  
ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his  
sons; and he set three days' journey betwixt himself and  
Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.  
And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, ??? of the almond  
and of the plane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them,  
and made the white appear  
</span>

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

which was in the rods. And he set the rods which he had  
peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the  
watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they  
conceived when they came to drink. And the flocks conceived  
before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked,  
speckled, and spotted. And Jacob separated the lambs, and  
set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all  
the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves  
apart, and put them not unto Laban's flock. And it came to  
pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive,  
that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in  
the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods; but  
when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the  
feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. And the man  
increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and  
maidservants and men-servants, and camels and asses.  

</div>

This Scripture is quite symbolical of conditions within ourselves.

One of the forces operative in the illumined intellect (Jacob) is the
image-making faculty of the mind. In this Scripture the activity of this
faculty is freely exemplified. The imagination has the ability and power
to throw onto the screen of visibility in substance and life any idea
that the mind conceives. This accounts for the rapid increase in Jacob's
possessions.

Jacob served Laban seven years thinking he would get Rachel (the
spiritual soul) to wife only to find that Leah (the human soul) had been
substituted. This would indicate that Laban in one aspect of his nature
was something of a trickster. Jacob then had to work another seven years
to pay for Rachel. However, there is only one presence, one power, one
intelligence, and

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

one's own must come to him. When the soul looks steadily to
Omnipresence, it finds that the law of equilibrium adjusts all
conditions. For his hire Jacob was to take from Laban's flock all the
ring-streaked and speckled and spotted cattle, all the black sheep, and
all the speckled and spotted goats; which he removed some little
distance. In addition to this he was to receive from the increase of
Laban's flocks, which were free from these markings, all those animals
which bore the same markings as Jacob's flocks.

When the strong, healthy herds were ready to conceive, Jacob placed in
the gutters around the watering troughs where they came to drink rods of
fresh poplar, and of almond, and of the plane tree, in which he had
peeled white streaks; the flocks conceived before these rods, and they
brought forth young that were ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted. When
the weak flocks were ready to conceive and came to drink, he took away
the rods in which he had peeled the white streaks. In the end Jacob had
large, strong, healthy herds and Laban had small and weak herds.

Taking it all in all, the illumined intellect (Jacob) receives all that
it deserves.

These passages in Genesis show the urge toward higher things on the part
of those who received the quickening of the Spirit. Jacob, Laban, and
Laban's family were of the same stock, but Jacob was more spiritually
awakened, and because of his superior understanding all those with whom
he was associated enjoyed increase of understanding and substance. Laban
said to Jacob, "I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy
sake." Separating the animals owned jointly by Laban and Jacob implies
that the vital forces have

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

expanded to the point where finer types are possible. These types are
represented as "ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted," and they fell to
Jacob. Jacob also discovered that he could increase his "flocks" by
using his image-making faculty, focusing the mind on a certain image
when he was in creative consciousness. The sculptor makes a mental image
of the thing he is carving and it appears under the impact of his hand.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 31:1-16. And he heard the words of Laban's
sons,  
saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's;  
and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this  
glory. And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and,  
behold, it was not toward him as beforetime. And Jehovah  
said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and  
to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.  
And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto  
his flock, and said unto them, I see your father's  
countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but  
the God of my father hath been with me. And ye know that  
with all my power I have served your father. And your  
father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;  
but God suffered him not to hurt me. If he said thus, The  
speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare  
speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be  
thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked. Thus God  
hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them  
to me. And it came to pass at the time that the flock  
conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream,  
and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were  
ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled. And the angel of God  
said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.  
And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see: all the  
he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked,  
speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban  
</span>

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

doeth unto thee. I am the God of Beth-el, where thou  
anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now  
arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the  
land of thy nativity. And Rachel and Leah answered and said  
unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in  
our father's house? Are we not accounted by him as  
foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite  
devoured our money. For all the riches which God hath taken  
away from our father, that is ours and our children's: now  
then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.

Laban and his family represent the pure natural in man, to which Jacob
(spiritual illumination) brings expansion. Laban acknowledged that Jacob
had brought him prosperity. But the spiritually illumined intellect
(Jacob) reaps a share of the increase, and to this the natural man
objects when his sons or "afterthoughts" call his attention to it.

In his dream Jehovah showed Jacob (illumined intellect) that he had
finished his work in Haran (a high exalted state of consciousness on the
natural plane) and now must function in a more fertile, productive soil.
He must return with his possessions to the land of his nativity.

The wives for whom Jacob had labored also had their substance share and
inherited part of the increase. When the mind is spiritually quickened
all the faculties respond, especially the imagination, as indicated by
the "ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled" progeny.

<span class="small">Gen. 31:17, 18. Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons
and  
his wives upon the camels; and he carried away all his  
cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the  
cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in  
Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of  
Canaan.

Jacob was moving from Haran all the possessions he had acquired in
Paddan-aram (the place of substance in the organism) to Canaan (the
state of consciousness that to the individual is the kingdom of heaven).
He took away with him a great wealth of substance, including camels,
cattle, sheep, gold, and silver, and even the teraphim (highest
thoughts) of that land.

"I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou
vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and
return unto the land of thy nativity."

We recall that Bethel, "the house of God," symbolizes the consciousness
in which Jacob dwelt when he beheld the ladder reaching to heaven and
exclaimed, "Surely Jehovah is in this place; and I knew it not."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 31:19-21. Now Laban was gone to shear his
sheep: and  
Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's. And Jacob  
stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told  
him not that he fled. So he fled with all that he had; and  
he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face  
toward the mountain of Gilead.  
</span>

</div>

Gilead represents a high state of consciousness, where Spirit reveals
its discerning, judging power. In this state of consciousness man
refuses to allow his high ideals to become subject to error reasonings.
Thus his spiritual discernment is not clouded by mortal thinking.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 31:22-32. And it was told Laban on the third
day that  
Jacob was fled. And he took his brethren with him, and  
pursued after him seven days' journey; and he overtook him  
in the mountain of Gilead. And God came to Laban the Syrian  
in a  
</span>

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself  
that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. And Laban  
came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the  
mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the  
mountain of Gilead. And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou  
done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and  
carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?  
Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me,  
and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away  
with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp; and  
didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now  
hast thou done foolishly. It is in the power of my hand to  
do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me  
yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak  
not to Jacob either good or bad. And now, though thou  
wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after  
thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?  
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:  
for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me  
by force. With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall  
not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine  
with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that  
Rachel had stolen them.

The teraphim were household gods of the Eastern peoples. They were
images, apparently human in form, that were used for purposes of worship
in the homes of the people. They were supposed to bring prosperity and
health and general domestic good. Even the Israelites used these images
much of the time, though the practice was of heathen origin.

Metaphysically the teraphim represent thoughts tending to the outer only
for supply, protection, and all good (givers of prosperity, guardians of
comforts,

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

nourishers, domestic idols); thoughts that imply trust in the many outer
channels through which one's good comes to one instead of faith in God
as one's sustenance and power of development; also the many thoughts and
desires that man entertains and gives expression to in outer ways and
that should first of all be centered in the one Presence within him.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 31:33-53. And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and
into  
Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants;  
but he found them not. And he went out of Leah's tent, and  
entered into Rachel's tent. Now Rachel had taken the  
teraphim, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon  
them. And Laban felt all about the tent, but found them  
not. And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry  
that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women  
is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.  
And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob  
answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my  
sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me? Whereas thou  
hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all  
thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy  
brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two. These twenty  
years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats  
have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have  
I not eaten. That which was torn of beasts I brought not  
unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou  
require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. Thus  
I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by  
night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes. These twenty years  
have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for  
thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou  
hast changed my wages ten times. Except the God of my  
father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear

of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me  
away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of  
my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.  
And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are  
my daughters, and the children are my children, and the  
flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and  
what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto  
their children whom they have borne? And now come, let us  
make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness  
between me and thee. And Jacob took a stone, and set it up  
for a pillar. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather  
stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did  
eat there by the heap. And Laban called it Jegar-saha  
dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. And Laban said, This  
heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was  
the name of it called Galeed: and Mispah, for he said,  
Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one  
from another. If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if  
thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with  
us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. And Laban said  
to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I  
have set betwixt me and thee. This heap be witness, and the  
pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to  
thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this  
pillar unto me, for harm. The God of Abraham, and the God  
of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And  
Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.

Man should remember always that he does not live by bread alone, by
outer ways and means, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth
of God: by the inner creative, sustaining, energizing life, love, power,
strength, and intelligence of Spirit.

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

Laban symbolizes that which is pure and gentle. He was told in a dream
what had happened, but God also revealed to him that he was not to speak
good or bad to Jacob. However, he searched the tents for the teraphim
without discovering them, as Rachel had placed them on the camel's back
under the saddle on which she was riding. A covenant was made between
Jacob and Laban. They gathered stones in a heap and they ate there.
Laban called the heap Jegar-sahadutha, the Aramaic name for Galeed.
Galeed means "massive witness," "heap of witnesses," "rock of time,"
"great endurance." It was the heap of stones that Jacob and Laban
gathered for a witness between them when Jacob with his wives, children,
and possessions left Laban to return to Esau and to Jacob's own country.
It was also called Mizpah, "watchtower," and thus signifies the
watchtower of prayer, while Galeed signifies the witness that Spirit
with man bears to Truth. By following the true Jehovah Spirit in
ourselves we shall always deal justly with every phase of our
consciousness and of our entire organism, as well as with persons. "This
heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over
this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this
pillar unto me, for harm."

<span class="small">Gen. 31:54, 55. And Jacob offered a sacrifice in
the  
mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they  
did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain. And  
early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and  
his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and  
returned unto his place.  
</span>

</div>

Jacob offered a sacrifice, and he and his brethren ate bread together.
The sacrifice consisted of an animal

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

slaughtered as an offering to the deity in man, symbolizing the
surrender to Spirit of the animal forces that they may be transmuted
into higher states of consciousness. Eating bread means joining in
communion, partaking of spiritual substance. Early in the morning Laban
arose and kissed his sons and his daughters in token of affection. Then
he invoked divine favor upon them and returned to his place.
