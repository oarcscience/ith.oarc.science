###  Chapter II Manifest Man Genesis 2 

THE BOOK OF GENESIS gives two accounts of the creation of man, the first
that of the creation by Elohim and the second that of the creation by
Jehovah. A right understanding of the processes the mind uses in
bringing forth its children (ideas) enables us to perfect harmony
between these apparently conflicting accounts. The first act of mind is
the formation of the idea, and the second is the expression of that
idea. Elohim or God-Mind creates a spiritual man, in whom are conceived
to be present all the attributes of his source. Next this spiritual man,
Jehovah God, God-Mind indentified as I AM, forms man in spiritual
substance, in the "dust of the ground."

The unfolding man is God's man, or the divine idea of man in process of
construction. The various ideas are being "clothed upon," that is, made
manifest. The manifest man is an idea until the Elohim mind in its I AM
or Jehovah form begins its process of expression. Then Jehovah God
begins to form or clothe the idea man in substance, which process,
described symbolically in these Scriptures, has been going on all down
the ages.

The manifest man is the man we see, the man we behold with our senses.
Manifest man evolves or makes manifest the ideas that exist eternally in
Being. The spiritual man is the man we behold in our ideals.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

"Ye are a temple of God." Eventually the manifest man and the ideal man
merge into one, as Jesus said: "I in them, and thou in me, that they may
be perfected into one."

Many have caught sight of the fact that the true body of Christ is a
state of consciousness in man, but few have gone so far as to realize
that this body is a temple in which the Christ holds religious services
at all times. "Know ye not that ye are a temple of God and that the
Spirit of God dwelleth in you." Under the direction of the Christ, a new
body is constructed by the thinking faculty in man; the materials
entering into this superior structure are spiritual substances, and the
new creation is the temple or body of Spirit. It breathes an atmosphere
and is thrilled with a life energy more real than that of the manifest
man. When a person has come into the realization of his true Christ
body, he feels the stirring within him of this body of the indwelling
Spirit or Christ. He knows what Paul meant when he said: "There is a
natural body, there is also a spiritual body." "If any man is in Christ,
he is a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are
become new."

Jehovah I AM breathes the breath of life into Adam, who names the
animals (the elemental life forms in which he exists) and becomes
cocreator with Jehovah God in bringing forth his own perfection.

The image-and-likeness man is God's idea of man, a man spirtually
conceived, in whom are implanted the dominion and power necessary to
bring forth the perfection of his Father, God-Mind. "Ye therefore shall
be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect," said Jesus.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 2:1-3. And the heavens and the earth were
finished,  
and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God  
finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the  
seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God  
blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in  
it he rested from all his work which God had created and  
made.  
</span>

</div>

The plans of Divine Mind were finished although there was as yet no
outward manifestation. All is finished first in consciousness and mind
then rests, in faith, from further mental activity. This "rest" precedes
manifestation. The seventh day refers to the mind's realization of
fulfillment, its resting in the assurance that all that has been imaged
in it will come forth in expression.

To hallow the seventh day is to rest in the stillness, quiet, and peace
of the silence of Mind. "Be still, and know that I am God." To hallow
means to keep holy. Holiness is resting in the conviction that there is
no lack in the absolute law that is the law of God. One creates first in
mind by idealizing the desired object and then resting in the assurance
that the law of manifestation is being fulfilled. God has finished
creating His universe, including man, and is resting in His perfect
idea. God rested on the seventh day.

Our Sunday is a symbol of the true Sabbath, a time when men turn away
from business and the pleasures of the senses to seek a day of quiet and
holy rest. The great Sabbath, the rest of God, is for all who will enter
it.

It is the state of mind in which we rest from outer work, cease daily
occupation, and give ourselves up to meditation or the study of things
spiritual. The Sabbath

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

also symbolizes an attitude of mind in which we relax the outer
consciousness, let go of all thought about material things, about the
affairs of daily life, and enter into the stillness of the consciousness
and begin to think of God and His law. This Sabbath is kept any time we
enter into spiritual consciousness and rest from thoughts about temporal
things. Then we let go of the external observance of days, because every
day is a Sabbath on which we retire into Spirit and worship God.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 2:4-8. These are the generations of the heavens
and of  
the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah  
God made earth and heaven. And no plant of the field was  
yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung  
up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the  
earth: and there was not a man to till the ground; but  
there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole  
face of the ground. And Jehovah God formed man of the dust  
of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of  
life; and man became a living soul. And Jehovah God planted  
a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom  
he had formed.  
</span>

</div>

Jehovah (I AM) in the Hebrew is written Yahweh. Yah is the masculine and
weh the feminine. The word is made up of masculine and feminine elements
and represents the joining together of wisdom and love as a procreating
nucleus. This is the Jehovah God who made the visible man, the man of
self-consciousness. God manifest in substance is the Jesus Christ man.
Elohim, universal Mind, creates, but Jehovah God forms. Being is without
beginning or ending. Universal Mind imaged itself in all that it
created, and all its ideas

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

are contained in the divine-idea man, which is Jehovah or the Christ.
Jesus Christ is that perfection made manifest in man. Spiritual creating
is ideation in Truth. The ideas of Divine Mind are contained potentially
in substance, but until these ideas are consciously recognized by
Jehovah God, the divine-idea man, they are not wholly manifest. All
things exist as ideas, but these ideas are manifested only as spiritual
man, becomes conscious of them. The "rain" represents the descent of
potential ideas into substance. Spiritual man, in whom all the ideas of
Divine Mind are imaged, is not yet manifest in substance. "There was not
a man to till the ground."

The "face" represents the outward aspect, while "ground" stands for
formed substance, the product of related ideas. When man begins to focus
his mind on a purpose, there appears at first to be a "mist" or lack of
clear understanding between the earth consciousness and the spiritual
mind. But this "mist" has its place in the divine economy, for it
"waters" or softens the divine radiance.

"Dust" represents the radiant earth or substance. When spiritual man (I
AM) enters into this "dust of the ground" (substance) and makes use of
the God ideas inherent in him, he brings forth the ideal body in its
elemental perfection. The real body of man is not material but is of the
nature of the universal-dust body, which is the divine-substance body.
Therefore the perfect image-and-likeness man is perfect in body as well
as in mind. We should remember that the first Adam was perfect as an
idea in his elemental soul and body. "Howbeit that is not first which is
spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual."

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

Spiritually, "nostrils" represents openness to the inspirations of mind.
The "breath" is the inner life flow that pulsates through the soul. The
breathing of the manifest man corresponds to the inspiration of the
spiritual man. When any man is inspired with high ideas, he breathes
"into his nostrils the breath of life." Spiritual inspiration quickens
man to the awareness that he is a "living soul." The soul is the sum
total of consciousness and its great goal is a consciousness of eternal
life. Through his I AM or Jehovah God man enters into his soul realm and
rebreathes into it the true ideas of Being until these ideas quicken his
consciousness to a response that harmonizes it with the underlying
Christ principles. Man, spiritually identified, is Jehovah God,
co-operating with Elohim God, divine principle, developing a spiritual
being, the Christ man, to the consciousness of his divinity. "I speak
not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works."

The Garden of Eden represents a region of being in which are provided
all primal ideas for the production of the beautiful. As described in
Genesis it represents allegorically the elemental life and intelligence
placed at the disposal of man, through which he is to evolve a soul and
body.

The Garden of Eden also represents allegorically the elemental forces
named by scientists as composing the invisible, etheric universe that
Jesus referred to as the "kingdom of the heavens" and "Paradise." It
also comprehends the activity of those forces in man's soul and body
that, when quickened and regenerated, make him a master of all creation.
"The kingdom of God is within you." "East" represents the within as

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

"west" represents the without. Jesus also said, "Ye who have followed
me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of
his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel." In our analysis of the Garden of Eden we consider it
as a concentration, in man, of all the ideas of God concerned in the
process of unfolding man's soul and body. When man is expressing the
ideas of Divine Mind, bringing forth the qualities of Being in divine
order, he dwells in Eden, a state of bliss, in a harmonious, productive
consciousness containing all possibilities of growth.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 2:9. And out of the ground made Jehovah God to
grow  
every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for  
food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and  
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  
</span>

</div>

"Ground" represents formed substance: ideas of Truth of which man is
conscious. The "tree" is the substance that connects mind and body,
earth and heaven, represented physically by the nerves. The "tree that
is pleasant to the sight" represents the pleasure derived from ascending
and descending currents of life over the nerves. The substance of
spiritual thought is the "food" that is good. The "tree of life also in
the midst of the garden" represents the absolute-life principle
established in man's consciousness by Divine Mind, the very center of
his being. The roots of the "tree of life" are centered in the
solar-plexus region, and they are symbolized in the physical organism by
the nerves of that plexus.

The "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" represents the sympathetic
nervous system whose fruit is

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

sensation. When man controls his feelings and emotions his sensations
are harmonized and all his functions are supplied with nerve energy. But
when man gives way to the pleasure sensation he consumes or "eats" of
that energy and robs his body of its essential nerve food. Thus
excessive sense pleasure and the pain that follows are designated as
"good and evil."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 2:10-14. And a river went out of Eden to water
the  
garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four  
heads. The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which  
compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;  
and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and  
the onyx stone. And the name of the second river is Gihon:  
the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush. And  
the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which  
goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the  
Euphrates.  
</span>

</div>

"River" symbolizes the activity of life in the trees or the current of
life in the organism (garden). The "head" of the river represents its
directive power.

The name Pishon is variously defined as "fully diffused," "real
existence," "perfect substantiality," "being, carried to its highest
degree." Spiritually interpreted, this definition is descriptive of
Spirit at work in man's consciousness, Spirit diffusing its ideas of
intelligence and light into man's soul. However this work of Spirit is
not confined to man's body or to the earth but is everywhere present. It
is the activity of divine ideas in their fullness.

The river Pishon is described as encompassing "the whole land of
Havilah." Havilah represents the struggle of elemental life, virtue born
of trial, travail, or

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

suffering. There is gold in this land and also precious stones, which
means that it is the realm of reality. In other words, we have locked up
in our elemental body all the treasures of Spirit. All the precious
things of life for which we have been looking are in our body, and it is
through the inflow of this mighty spiritual Pishon that these precious
ideas are released. But there is a struggle or, as Jesus said,
"tribulation" between the spiritual and the natural.

The name Gihon means variously "formative movement," "a bursting forth,"
"whirlpool," "rapid stream." This river represents the deific breath of
God inspiring man and at the same time purifying his blood in the lungs.
Job said that "there is a spirit in man" and that "the breath of the
Almighty giveth them understanding." The river Gihon "compasseth the
whole land of Cush." The name Cush means "firelike," "darkness,"
"impurity"; and the passage refers to the blood-purifying process of the
breath. God is breathing His breath through man's being, cleansing the
blood stream, and filling his whole being with spiritual inspiration.

The name Hiddekel means "universal generative fluid," "rapid stream,"
"rapid spiritual influx." The river Hiddekel symbolizes the spiritual
nerve fluid that God is propelling throughout man's whole being
continually, as the electromagnetic center of every physically expressed
atom and cell, the very elixir of life. This wonderful stream of nerve
fluid finds its way over all the many nerves in man's body, giving him
the invigorating, steadying power of the Holy Spirit.

Assyria represents the psychic realm or the soul. The nerve fluid, the
most attenuated and volatile fluid of the body, breaks into flares at
the ends of the

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

nerves, giving rise to various kinds of psychical and mental action,
forming character or soul. The mind uses the nerve flares to express its
ideas.

The name of the fourth river, Euphrates, means "fructifying" or "that
which is the fructifying cause." Metaphysically it represents the blood
stream. The circulatory system receives and distributes the nutrients
contained in the food we eat. The blood stream is charged with the food
substance for bone, muscle, brain, teeth, and hair. Every part of the
organism is supplied with substance through this wonderful river
Euphrates.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 2:15-17. And Jehovah God took the man, and put
him  
into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And  
Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the  
garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the  
knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for  
in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.  
</span>

</div>

The Garden of Eden symbolizes the omnipresent, unseen realm out of which
comes the visible universe. Modern science has named it the cosmic
ether. It cannot be described in human language, because it transcends
all the comparisons of earth. Jesus said that the "mysteries" of the
kingdom were revealed to those who were spiritually awake but to others
must be told in parables.

The human body with its psychical and spiritual attributes comprises a
miniature Garden of Eden, and when man develops spiritual insight and in
thought, word, and act voluntarily operates in accord with the divine
law, then rulership, authority, and dominion become his in both mind and
body. "The kingdom of God is within you."

Jehovah God, the active representative of Divine

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

Mind in man, places man in the Garden of Eden to "dress it and to keep
it." Man dresses and keeps this garden by developing, in his
consciousness, the original, pure ideas imparted by Divine Mind. As man
establishes ideas of Truth he calls into manifestation his spiritual
body imaged in substance by Divine Mind.

"Tree" represents the connecting link between the formed substance
(earth) and the formless (heaven). To "eat" is to appropriate the
substance of ideas through thinking about them. "Evil" represents error
thought combinations; that part of consciousness which has lost sight of
true principles and through sensation becomes enamored of the thing
formed. Form has its place in creation, but it is subject to the
creative idea that begets it. The activity of an idea in man's mind
produces sensation. To become involved in the sensation of an idea to
the exclusion of control is to eat of the "tree of the knowledge of good
and evil" and die to all consciousness of the original idea.

Materiality as the obverse of spirituality was set up when man became
involved in thoughts of the external, in sensation, and lost sight of
the true creative idea. Because of this, man gradually became separated
from the realm of divine ideas; in other words, from God. Death is the
result of this separation from God. Jesus restored the broken life
current between God and man and so became the "Saviour" for those who
follow Him.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 2:18-25. And Jehovah God said, It is not good
that the  
man should be alone; I will make him a help mate for him.  
And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the  
field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto  
the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the  
man  
</span>

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

called every living creature, that was the name thereof.  
And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of  
the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man  
there was not found a help meet for him. And Jehovah God  
caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and  
he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead  
thereof: and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the  
man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And the  
man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my  
flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out  
of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his  
mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be  
one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife,  
and were not ashamed.  

</div>

Man must have avenues through which to express himself. These avenues
are the "help meet" designed by Jehovah God. Man represents wisdom. It
is not good for wisdom to act alone; it must be joined with love if
harmony is to be brought forth. Both the soul and the body are helpmeets
to man (spirit), avenues through which he expresses the ideas of Mind.

It is on the soul or substance side of consciousness that ideas are
"identified," that is, "named." Whatever we recognize a thing to be,
that it becomes to us because of the naming power vested in man
(wisdom). "Every beast of the field" and the "cattle" represent ideas of
strength, power, vitality, and life. These ideas must be recognized by
the I AM before they can be formed. "The birds of the heavens" represent
free thoughts and the interchange between the subconscious and the
conscious activities of mind. Man has power to name all ideas that are
presented to his conscious mind, whether they come from within or
without.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

Wisdom, the masculine phase of man, needs a helpmeet or balance. Love in
the soul (woman) has not yet been developed and established in
substance.

A limited concept of Jehovah God caused a deep sleep (mesmeric state) to
fall on the man (Adam). Nowhere in Scripture is there any record to show
that Adam was ever fully awakened; and he (man) is still partly in this
dreamlike state of consciousness. In this state he creates a world of
his own and peoples it with ideas corresponding to his own
sleep-benumbed consciousness.

Paul said, "As in Adam all die \[fall asleep, lose spiritual
consciousness\], so also in Christ shall all be made alive \[awaken from
coma or lethargy into the awareness of Spirit life\]."

Awakening cannot be associated with dying. The idea that man awakens to
spiritual or any kind of consciousness immediately after "death,"
whether in heaven, hell, purgatory, or elsewhere, is opposed to Truth.
His awakening must take place here, during the time of "life," at least
while he is partially awake and before he sinks into that deeper sleep
or coma that we call death.

The Scripture admonishes us: "Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from
the dead \[the mortal dream of life\], and Christ \[Truth\] shall shine
upon thee." David, sensing this, said, "I shall be satisfied, when I
awake, with beholding thy form."

The soul is here coming into the positive development of divine love
(the woman). Love is the passive quality of mind and must become active
through man's volition, before it can be brought forth; and man must
enter into the passive side of Being and

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

cease from outer mental activity. This state is symbolized by "deep
sleep"; the outer consciousness is quiet, allowing the spiritual to
express itself fully.

Man evolves, attains consciousness in mind and body, as he becomes aware
of the divine ideas implanted in his being. In this chapter Adam
"names"--calls to consciousness in life's activities--the beasts of the
field and the birds of the heavens (animal and intellectual realms).
Then in moments of meditation, when the outer mind is still, he makes
contact with the subconscious.

The Hebrew word from which "rib" is translated means "curved surface,"
not specifically one of Adam's ribs; rather, the curves of beauty innate
in Adam. The development of Eve is a refining process that helps man to
bring forth his divine feminine nature. The rib or bone that became
woman is symbolical of the very substantial character of the love that
she represents.

Adam is the objective and Eve the subjective in primal man, both in the
same body. As man evolves Eve becomes objective. "This is now bone of my
bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was
taken out of Man."

If the ego or will that is man has adhered to the guiding light of
Spiritual faithfully and has carried out in its work the plans that are
ideated in wisdom, it has created a harmonious consciousness. The
original Adam in Eden is symbolical of such a consciousness.

The "deep sleep" into which the intellect is plunged when true love is
experienced still prevails in human relations. Love is the great mystery
of life. The spiritually wise see love as the force that enfolds with
mathematical precision the galaxies in space as well as the tiniest
atom. Science names it gravity.
