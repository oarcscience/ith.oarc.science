###  Understanding 

REFERENCE to the dictionary shows the words wisdom, understanding,
knowledge, and intelligence to be so closely related that their
definitions overlap in a most confusing way. The words differ in
meaning, but various writers on the mind and its faculties have given
definitions of these words in terms that directly oppose the definitions
of other writers. There are two schools of writers on metaphysical
subjects, and their definitions are likely to confuse a student unless
he knows to which class the writer belongs. First are those who handle
the mind and its faculties from an intellectual standpoint, among whom
may be mentioned Kant, Hegel, Mill, Schopenhauer, and Sir William
Hamilton. The other school includes all the great company of religious
authors who have discerned that Spirit and soul are the causing factors
of the mind. Compilers of dictionaries have consulted the former class
for their definitions, and we have in consequence an inadequate set of
terms to express the deep things of the mind. Even Christian
metaphysicians who belong in the second classification have no clear
understanding of the two great realms of mind; first, that in which pure
ideas and pure logic rule; and second, the realm in which the

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

thoughts and the actions of the mind are concerned with reason and the
relation of ideas in the outer world. It is only in the last half
century that large numbers of Christians have discerned that Jesus
taught a metaphysical science.

Poets are natural mystics and metaphysicians, and in their writings we
find the safest definitions of the names used to represent the actions
of the mind. Poets nearly always make the proper distinction between
wisdom and understanding. Tennyson says, "Knowledge comes, but wisdom
lingers." Spiritual discernment always places wisdom above the other
faculties of mind and reveals that knowledge and intelligence are
auxiliary to understanding. Intellectual understanding comes first in
the soul's development, then a deeper understanding of principles
follows, until the whole man ripens into wisdom.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,  
And coming events cast their shadows before.  
</span>

</div>

The writings of the Hebrew prophets are good examples of original
inspiration, which is wisdom. Solomon was famous for his wisdom. Jehovah
appeared to him in a dream and said: "Ask what I shall give thee."
Solomon replied: "Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to
judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil." Pleased
because Solomon had asked for wisdom instead of riches and honor, the
Lord said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Behold, I have done according to thy word; lo I have
given  
thee a wise and an understanding heart . . . And I  
</span>

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both  
riches and honor . . . And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it  
was a dream.  

</div>

It was after this occurrence that two women appealed to Solomon to
decide which of them really was the mother of the child that they both
claimed.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">And the king said, Fetch me a sword. . . . And the
king  
said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the  
one, and half to the other. Then spake the woman whose the  
living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned over  
her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living  
child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall  
be neither mine nor thine; divide it. Then the king  
answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no  
wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. And all Israel  
heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they  
feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in  
him, to do justice.  
</span>

</div>

The foregoing is a fine example of intuitive knowing. Instead of
indulging in the usual taking of testimony and the various methods of
proving the case by witnesses, Solomon appealed directly to the heart
and got the truth quickly. No amount of exoteric testimony would have
accomplished what the appeal to love brought forth at once.

Although it is sometimes difficult to determine between pure knowing and
the quick perception of the intellect, the decision can always be made
truly, based on the presence of the affectional nature.

Great philosophers in every age have testified to the activity of a
supermind quality, which they have

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

variously named. Socrates had it. He called it his daemon. Plato named
it pure reason. Jesus called it the kingdom of the heavens.

In an article by M. K. Wisehart, printed in the American Magazine for
June, 1930, entitled "A Close Look at the World's Greatest Thinker,"
Professor Albert Einstein is quoted as saying:

"'Every man knows that in his work he does best and accomplishes most
when he has attained a proficiency that enables him to work intuitively.
That is, there are things which we come to know so well that we do not
know how we know them. So it seems to me in matters of principle.
Perhaps we live best and do things best when we are not too conscious of
how and why we do them.'

"He spoke of the great extent to which intuition figures in his work,
and gave me to understand that the ability to work by intuition is one
that can be acquired in any walk of life. It comes as the result of
prolonged effort and reflection and application and failures and trying
again. Then, in the end, one knows things without knowing how one knows
them! And I gathered that the Professor meant to say that no man knows
anything until he knows it in this thorough, instinctive way.

"People frequently ask Professor Einstein whether, as a scientist, he
believes in God. Usually he answers: 'I do not believe in a God who
maliciously or arbitrarily interferes in the personal affairs of
mankind. My religion consists of an humble admiration for the vast power
which manifests itself in

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

that small part of the universe which our poor, weak minds can grasp!'

"In a discussion, when the Professor is impressed by the correctness of
his own views or those of another, he will suddenly exclaim: 'Yes! So it
is! It is just! It must be so! I am quite sure that God could not have
made it different!' For him, God is as valid as a scientific argument.

"At one time, after prolonged concentration upon a single problem (it
lasted for nearly four years), the Professor suffered a complete
physical collapse. With it came severe stomach trouble. A celebrated
specialist said: 'You must not get out of bed! You cannot stand on your
feet for a long time to come.'

"'Is this the will of God?' queried the Professor instantly. 'I think
not! The voice of God is from within us. Something within me tells me
that every day I must get up at least once. I must go to the piano and
play! The rest of the day I will spend in bed! This I am prepared to
accept as the will of God!'

"And with the will of God, as set forth by Einstein, the specialist had
to be content. Every day the Professor got up, put his bathrobe over his
night-shirt, and went to the piano to play.

"I asked many questions to elicit the lessons of his experience that
might be of most use to the rest of us. I learned that he reads little.
'Much reading after a certain age,' he says, 'diverts the mind from its
creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too
little falls into lazy

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

habits of thinking, just as the man who spends too much time in the
theaters is apt to be content with living vicariously instead of living
his own life.

"'I have only two rules which I regard as principles of conduct. The
first is: Have no rules. The second is: Be independent of the opinion of
others.'"

So we find that there is in man a knowing capacity transcending
intellectual knowledge. Nearly everyone has at some time touched this
hidden wisdom and has been more or less astonished at its revelations.
It certainly is a most startling experience to find ourselves giving
forth logical thoughts and words without preparation or forethought,
because we nearly always arrive at our conclusions through a process of
reasoning. However, the reasoning process is often so swift that we are
likely to think that it is true inspiration, especially when we have
received either the reflected uplift of other wise ones or the baptism
of the Holy Spirit. This quickening of the intellect is the
John-the-Baptist or intellectual illumination that precedes the
awakening of the ideal, the Christ understanding. Some Truth students
become so enamored of the revelations that they receive through the head
that they fail to go on to the unfoldment of the One who baptizes in
"Holy Spirit and in fire." The Old Testament writers had a certain
understanding of the first and the second opening of the mind to
spiritual Truth; Isaiah said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The voice of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the
wilderness  
the way of Jehovah; make level in the desert a high way for  
our God.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

Elijah had intellectual illumination, and the Israelites were taught
that he would come again as a forerunner of the Messiah, Jesus said that
Elijah had come again in the personality of John the Baptist:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I say unto you, that Elijah is come already, and
they knew  
him not . . . Then understood the disciples that he spake  
unto them of John the Baptist.  
</span>

</div>

The history of the Israelites is a sort of moving picture of man's soul
and body development. When we understand the psychology of the different
scenes, we know what we have passed through or will pass through in our
journey from sense to Spirit.

Intellectual understanding of Truth, as given in the first baptism, is a
tremendous step in advance of sense consciousness, and its possession
brings a temptation to use for selfish ends the wisdom and the power
thereby revealed. When Jesus received this baptism He was "led up of the
Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil" (personal ego)
before he could take the next degree in Son-of-God consciousness.

But Jesus knew that the illumination of the personal is not the
fulfillment of the law, and He rejected every temptation to use His
understanding for selfish ends.

Unless the disciple is very meek he will find the mortal ego strongly
asserting its arguments for the application of the power of Spirit to
personal needs. The god of mammon is bidding high for men that have
received the baptism of Spirit, and many

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

sell out, but their end is dust and ashes. No man can serve two masters;
one cannot serve both God and Mammon.

When we discover in ourselves a flow of thought that seems to have been
evolved independently of the reasoning process, we are often puzzled
about its origin and its safety as a guide. In its beginnings this
seemingly strange source of knowledge is often turned aside as a
daydream; again it seems a distant voice, an echo of something that we
have heard and forgotten. One should give attention to this unusual and
usually faint whispering of Spirit in man. It is not of the intellect
and it does not originate in the skull. It is the development, in man,
of a greater capacity to know himself and to understand the purpose of
creation. The Bible gives many examples of the awakening of this brain
of the heart, in seers, in lawgivers, and in prophets. It is accredited
as coming from the heart. The nature of the process is not explained;
one who is in the devotional stage of unfoldment need not know all the
complex movements of the mind in order to get the message of the Lord.
It is enough to know that the understanding is opened in both head and
heart when man gives himself wholly to the Lord.

This relation of head and heart is illustrated in the lives of John the
Baptist and Jesus. They were cousins; the understanding of the head
bears a close relation to the wisdom of the heart. They both received
the baptism of Spirit, John preceding Jesus and baptizing Him. Here the
natural order of spiritual

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

illumination is illustrated. Man receives first an intellectual
understanding of Truth which he transmits to his heart, where love is
awakened. The Lord reveals to him that the faculty of love is the
greatest of all the powers of man and that head knowledge must decrease
as heart understanding increases.

However, we should remember that none of the faculties is eliminated in
the regeneration. Among the apostles of Jesus, Thomas typifies the head,
representing reason and intellectual perception. Jesus did not ignore
Thomas's demand for physical evidence of His identity, but respected it.
He convinced Thomas by corporal evidence that there had been a body
resurrection; that He was living, not in a physical or ghost body, but
in the same body that had been crucified.

Jesus plainly taught that He had attained control of the life in the
body and could take it up or lay it down. We may construe the death and
the resurrection of Jesus in various ways, many of them fanciful and
allegorically far removed from practical life, but the fact remains that
there is good historical evidence of the physical reality of the
Resurrection in its minutest detail.

Spiritual understanding shows us that the resurrection of the body from
death is not to be confined to Jesus, but is for all men who comprehend
Truth and apply it as Jesus applied it. He had the consciousness of the
new flood of life that comes to all who open their minds and their
bodies to the living

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

Word of God, and He knew that it would raise the atomic vibration of His
organism above the disintegrating thought currents of the earth and thus
would save His flesh from corruption.

When Jesus told the Jews what He discerned, they said that He was crazy
("hath a demon"). One who teaches and practices the higher understanding
and reality of man's relation to the creative law is not sane--from the
viewpoint of mortal man.

When the higher understanding in Jesus proclaimed, "Verily, verily, I
say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death," they
took up stones to cast at Him. This startling claim of the power of the
word of Truth to save one from death is beyond all human reason, and it
is resented by the material thoughts, which are as hard as rocks.

Jesus did not let the limited race thought about man keep Him from doing
the works of Spirit. He knew that the light of Truth had arisen in His
consciousness and He was not afraid to affirm it. He went right ahead
healing the sick and teaching the Truth as He saw it, regardless of the
traditions of the Hebrew fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He kept the
light shining in His consciousness by being loyal to it and by making
for Himself the highest statements of Truth that He could conceive. The
Christ Mind speaking in Him said: "I am the light of the world."

Spiritual understanding is developed in a multitude of ways; no two
persons have exactly the same experience. One may be a Saul, to whom the
light

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

comes in a blinding flash, while to another the light may come gently
and harmoniously. The sudden breaking forth of the light indicates the
existence of stored-up reservoirs of spiritual experience, gained from
previous lives. Jesus saw that Saul had a spiritual capacity that,
turned into right channels, would do great good; so He took some pains
to awaken in Saul the true light and thereby restrain the destructive
zeal that possessed him. "He is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name
before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel."

The spiritual nature develops in man as the other attributes of his
character develop. "As he thinketh within himself, so is he" is a
statement of the law that has no exception. Man develops the capacity to
do that which he sets out to do. If one makes no start one never goes.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">In idle wishes fools supinely stay;  
Be there a will, then wisdom finds a way.  
</span>

</div>

No one ever attained spiritual consciousness without striving for it.
The first step is to ask. "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." Prayer is one form
of asking, seeking, and knocking. Then make your mind receptive to the
higher understanding, through silent meditations and affirmations of
Truth. The earnest desire to understand spiritual things will open the
way and revelation within and without will follow. In Daniel 10:12 it is
written:

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou
didst  
set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before  
thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words'  
sake.  
</span>

</div>

Daniel humbled himself in the presence of the universal Mind, and
thereby opened his understanding and made himself receptive to the
cosmic consciousness. Daniel and his companions were superior in wisdom
and understanding to all the native magicians and seers in the whole
Babylonian realm. The Scriptures say that God gave Daniel knowledge and
skill in all learning and wisdom, and "Daniel had understanding in all
visions and dreams." Cultivate purity of mind and body, and you will
open the way for the higher thoughts, as did Daniel. He "purposed in his
heart that he would not defile himself with the king's dainties, nor
with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of
the eunuchs that he might not defile himself."

Spiritual understanding is developed in the feminine realm of the soul.
This development is pictured in Acts 16:14: "And a certain woman named
Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped
God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened."

Thyatira means "burning incense"; it represents the intense desire of
man for the higher expressions of life. When this inner urge comes forth
with power (seller of purple), the Lord opens the heart and we receive
the heavenly message, like the disciples who said one to another: "Was
not

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he
opened to us the scriptures?"

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Wisdom consisteth not in knowing many things, nor
even in  
knowing them thoroughly; but in choosing and in following  
what conduces the most certainly to our lasting happiness  
and true glory.--Landor

Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,  
And the man that getteth understanding.  
For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver,  
And the profit thereof than fine gold.  
She is more precious than rubies:  
And none of the things thou canst desire art to be compared  
unto her.  
Length of days is in her right hand;  
In her left hand are riches and honor.  
Her ways are ways of pleasantness,  
And all her paths are peace.  
She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her:  
And happy is every one that retaineth her.  
Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth;  
By understanding he established the heavens.
