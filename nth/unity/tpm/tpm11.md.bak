###  Chapter IX The Will Is the Man 

OUR CAPTION is quoted from an ancient metaphysical teaching, the origin
of which is lost in antiquity. The idea is that the development of the
will is possible only through the development of the mind as a whole,
and as man is mind, "the will is the man." This conclusion is reached
because the will moves to action all the other faculties of the mind and
seems to be the whole process.

However, a careful analysis of the various factors entering into an
action reveals other equally important attributes of man, and we cannot
wholly admit that "the will is the man." The will is undoubtedly the
focal point around which all action centers, when there is harmony of
mind; but the rule has been accepted by schools of philosophy from most
ancient times down to the present that the will and the understanding
are very closely related--the understanding comprehending all our
speculative, the will all our active, powers. This close relationship is
symbolically taught in the Bible, and it appeals to man's reason and is
confirmed by his observation.

Jacob, representing the I AM (I will be what I will to be), had twelve
sons, one of whom was Joseph, "the dreamer." Joseph represents the
imagination,

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

by which all forms and shapes are brought into manifestation. In the
development of the mind, certain faculties are given prominence. After
they run their race, other faculties that have been held in reserve come
forward. When the period of rest comes, the Scriptures recite that a
certain one "died, old and full of days." As man goes forward in his
unfoldment, there is sometimes a tendency toward the surface of
consciousness, or the phenomenal, and a gradual loss of interest in the
original sources of action. The phenomenal phase of creation is so
interesting that man sometimes becomes bewildered in its study or its
pleasure, and the originating cause may be ignored to the point of
forgetfulness. This cessation of creative activity by the imagination
(Joseph) is described in these words: "So Joseph died, being a hundred
and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in
Egypt." This means metaphysically that when the imagination in a life
span has fulfilled its mission as a creative power it falls asleep, but
it is preserved in the realms of darkness (Egypt).

Joseph's number is eleven. He was the eleventh son, and his age when he
stopped active work and fell asleep (110) represents the completeness of
the dispensation of that faculty's activity; the cipher indicates an
endless capacity for expression. The figure given as the age of a
Biblical character usually represents the subject's place in his
evolution. Joseph completed his evolution to the eleventh degree plus.
The cipher means that he has more to demonstrate.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

Jesus' number is twelve. He was wise at the age of twelve.

Adam was third in the Godhead (God, Christ, man). He lived 930 years,
according to scriptural chronology. This number tells us that he is
third in the trinity, has the capacity of the twelvefold man, but has
unfolded only three of the twelve faculties. The order of the numbers
indicates the harmony of his unfoldment. In this instance it was
orderly--the naught denotes future progress uninterrupted.

Seth, the son whom Adam begat "in his own likeness, after his image,"
represents the awakening of spiritual consciousness. "Then began men to
call upon the name of Jehovah." Seth's years were 912. Here the trinity
and the twelvefold man are eptiomized, and we see that Seth was the
birth, in Adam, of Adam's own original character, even the image and
likeness of Elohim. In the figure nine the trinity is repeated three
times, once for each of its identities, God, Christ, man; then the
twelve powers of man are added. Again the total of the digits is twelve,
the number of divine man demonstrated.

We have called attention to the metaphysical meaning of the chronology
of these Biblical characters in order to illustrate more fully the
manner in which the faculties are developed. It will be seen that in man
is implanted the likeness of God, which man develops in a long series of
personalities. The process of forming a soul may be compared to the
development, in a photographic negative, of the image that has been
imprinted upon the sensitive

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

plate but cannot be seen until it has been put through a regular
developing process. When Adam had a spiritual awakening he perceived the
truth of his identity in God, and thereby begat Seth, the original image
and likeness of spiritual man, imprinted upon him by the Word of
creative Mind. Then the worship of Jehovah was restored in man's whole
consciousness, for a time at least.

Coming down the chronological stream, we find that Joseph's place was
taken by two sons. "And Joseph called the name of the first-born
Manasseh: For, said he, God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my
father's house. And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God
hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction." The mother of these
sons was Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, Egyptian priest of On. Asenath
means "peril." She represents the feminine or love side of the natural
man. From this intricate symbology we discern that two faculties of the
mind were given birth. The eldest son, Manasseh, had power to forget, to
erase by denial, through an understanding of Truth, all the accumulated
burden of thoughts, even to that of heredity, "all my father's house."
The other son, Ephraim, could add to by affirmation and make fruitful
the land that seemed to be a place of affliction. These two sons of
Joseph inherited his allotment in the Promised Land, which symbolizes
the perfected body. The front brain is the field of operation for these
closely related faculties--imagination, understanding, and will. When
man's will is working

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

strongly he corrugates his brow, and his quick understanding causes his
eyes to flash.

When the imagination is subjective and spiritual and the will and the
understanding are objective and alert, we have the creative artist. Then
the understanding develops its greatest freedom and originality. It is
no longer bound by the traditions of the past in literature, art, music,
drama, science, or religion, but launches out into the deep and brings
up the "pearl of great price," original creative genius and life. Then
the energetic will makes fruitful by its activity all the inspirations
of the awakened man.

These two closely related forces of the mind are dominant in the race
because their practicality is necessary in man's free development. If
the imagination were wholly in command, it would eventually run into a
riot of daydreams or fanciful schemes that could not be worked out
successfully in a world where natural law is inexorable. It is this
"peril" (Asenath) that the mind considers, and brings forth, in
sequence, will and understanding. "The highest and most excellent thing
in man," says Goethe, "is formless, and we must guard against giving it
shape in anything save noble deeds."

Man is a free agent in the possession and the use of the faculty of
will. Freedom of will has been variously regarded and defined. It is the
subject of volumes of theological literature and also the rock on which
religionists have split. The theory of predestination relieves man of
all responsibility. If

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

God has fixed every act of man's existence, then there can be no mental
or moral freedom. If man cannot determine the character of his acts, he
has neither understanding nor will--he is a puppet.

The understanding and the will should be especially active in one who
would master the sensations of the body. Potiphar's wife represents the
sense consciousness that tempts us to meet its desires, and, when we
deny it, has us imprisoned. This means that when a certain habit in the
sense consciousness is refused expression, it reacts and for a time
seems to prevent our expressing even the good. But let us patiently bide
our time; the higher will yet show its God-given power.

The several visits of Joseph's brothers to Egypt for corn, and the final
reconciliation, are symbolical representations of the manner in which we
make connection with the obscured vitality within the organism and
finally bring all our faculties into conjunction with it.

Volumes might be written with Joseph as a text. In his history, as given
in Genesis, some of the most interesting processes of regeneration are
symbolized. This hidden realm within the subconsciousness is in an
Egyptian, or obscured, state to most of us. Yet it is a great kingdom,
and its king is Pharaoh, ruler of the sun, or the "brain" and nerve
center, which physiology names the solar plexus. This is the brain of
the physical man, and it directs the circulation, digestion,
assimilation, and so forth. Students of mind have discovered that the
solar plexus is the

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

organ through which a ruling thought in the head is carried into the
body. He of the "hard heart," who would not let the people go, is human
will, acting through the solar plexus, or city of the sun.

The spiritual life in the subconsciousness (Children of Israel in Egypt)
is often prevented from expressing itself by the opposition of the will.
If the understanding decides that what it conceives to be the natural
law shall be the limit of expression, there is further bondage and there
are harder tasks. Any hard, dictatorial, or willful state of mind will
harden the heart. This state of mind acts through the solar plexus (the
distributing station for building forces of the body), and thereby
brings its limitations upon the whole system. Hardened arteries are the
result of hard thoughts, this hardness originates in the will. Jehovah
represents the law of the I AM in action.

The ambiguity in the term "motive" has caused much of the controversy
that has raged over free will. The champions of free will commonly
suppose that before performing an act a man is affected by various
motives, none of which necessarily determines his act. Their opponents,
on the other hand, argue that there is no such thing as this unmotivated
choice. Some hold that free will proper consists of choice only as
between higher and lower good. Some regard it as consisting in the power
to do as one pleases or chooses. Others define it as the power to do or
to choose as one should.

According to some academic metaphysicians, the freedom of the will
includes the power to act contrary

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

to all of one's own motives or inclinations or tendencies, this power
being inherent in the will. It is readily seen that this thing called
"motive" is another name for understanding, and that it is a necessary
adjunct to that faculty. But not all people use understanding as the
headlight for both motive and will. The undisciplined mind feels the
impulse that lies behind motive, and acts without considering either
cause or effect. This is partaking of the knowledge of good and evil
without heeding the voice of wisdom--the sin of Adam, undeveloped man.
Understanding may be illumined by the Christ Mind, and thus receive the
light that "lighteth every man, coming into the world." Without this
light man breaks the law in nearly every act. The divorcement of
understanding from will has led to endless controversies between those
who have written and debated about the necessity for man's having free
will, and those who, because of the evils that have come upon man
through ignorant willing, have advocated the utter effacement of the
will.

We do not need less will; we need more understanding. Jesus (spiritual
light) showed Thomas (intellectual understanding) the wounds that
ignorance had inflicted upon the innocent body. Jesus' apostles
represented His own faculties of mind. When He called them they were
ignorant and undisciplined children of the natural world. But the image
and likeness of the creative Mind was on them, to discipline them in the
wisdom of the Christ (spiritual I AM).

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

As the executive power of the mind, human will is the negative pole of
spiritual decision. Right here is where those who study man from a
personal viewpoint fail in their estimate of his power and his
accountability. As mortal, living in a material world, he seems
circumscribed and limited in capacity and destiny. Philosophers have
studied man in this cage of the mind, and their conclusions have been
that he is little better than a reasoning animal.

But there is a higher and truer estimate of man, and that estimate is
made from what the academic school of philosophy would call the purely
speculative side of existence. Failing to discern his spiritual origin,
they fail in estimating his real character. As a product of the natural
man, will is often a destructive force. Nearly all our systems of
training children have been based on breaking the will in order to gain
authority over the child and obedience from him. We should remember that
the right to exercise freedom of will was given to man in the beginning,
according to Genesis, and that will should always be given its original
power and liberty.

It is possible, however, for man so to identify his consciousness with
Divine Mind that he is moved in every thought and act by that Mind.
Jesus attained this unity; when He realized that He was willing not in
the personal but in the divine, He said: "Not my will, but thine, be
done."

Many sincere Christians have tried to follow in the way of Jesus, and
they have negatively submitted their will to God. But they have not
attained

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

the power or the authority of Jesus by so doing. The reason is that they
have not raised their will to the positive spiritual degree. Jesus was
not negative in any of His faculties, and He did not teach a doctrine of
submission. He gave, to those who went forth preaching the Gospel, the
power and authority of the Holy Spirit. In Mark 16:16-18 it is recorded
that Jesus says: "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but
he that disbelieveth shall be condemned. And these signs shall accompany
them that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall
speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents, and if they drink
any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on
the sick, and they shall recover." We must believe in the higher powers
and be immersed in the omnipresent water of life. If we fail to exercise
faith in things spiritual, we are condemned to the prison of
materiality.

Some Christians believe that God's will toward men varies, that His will
changes, that He chastises the disobedient and punishes the wicked. This
view of God's character is gained from the Old Testament. Jehovah was
the tribal God of the Israelites as Baal was of the Philistines. Men's
concepts of God are measured by their spiritual understanding. The
Jehovah, of Moses, is quite different from the Father, of Jesus, yet
they are spiritually one and the same. "It is not the will of your
Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish,"
is the teaching of Jesus. He bore witness that

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

the will of God is that men should not suffer--that through Him they
should have complete escape from sin, sickness, and even death. "God so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life." The sin,
sickness, suffering, and death that men experience are not punishment
willed by God; they are results of broken law. The law is good; men have
joy, satisfaction, and life in everlasting harmony, when they keep the
law. Creation would not be possible without rules governing the created.

It is error for anyone to submit his will to the control of any
personality. The personal exercise of will by personal understanding is
short-sighted and selfish; hence it is never safe to allow oneself to be
led by the direction or advice of another. Practice the presence of God
until you open your consciousness to the inflow of the omnipresent,
all-knowing mind, then affirm your unity with that mind until you know
and fully realize, through the many avenues of wisdom, just what you
should do. This acquirement of a knowledge of the divine will is not the
work of an instant; it results from patient and persistent spiritual
study, prayer, and meditation. Even Jesus, with His exalted
understanding, found it necessary to pray all night. All who have found
the peace and the power of God have testified to the necessity of using
prayer in the soul's victory.

One should not intellectually will to bring about results for oneself or
for another. The difference

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

between the personal will and the universal will can be known by one who
practices thought control in the silence.

Affirmations made in the head alone are followed by a feeling of
tension, as if bands were drawn across the forehead. When this state of
mind sinks back into the subconsciousness, the nerves become tense; if
the practice is continued, nervous prostration follows.

Stubborn, willful, resistant states of mind congest the life flow; they
are followed by cramps and congestion. The will often compels the use of
the various organs of the body beyond their normal capacity, and the
results are found in strained nerves and strained muscles and in
impaired sight and impaired hearing. Disobedient children have earache,
showing the direct result that self-will has on the nerves of the ear.
Deaf persons should be treated for freedom from willfulness and
obstinacy. In the present state of race consciousness, all people use
the intellectual will to excess. The remedy is daily relaxation,
meditation, prayer.

Will, as exercised by man, is the negative pole of the great executive
force of the universe. The recognition of this in silent meditation
opens the will to the inflow of this mighty, moving principle, and the
power that moves to action the members of the body reaches into the
invisible realm of ideas and controls the elements. It was comprehension
of the will universal that enabled Jesus to say to the wind and the
waves, "Peace, be still."

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are the inalienable rights
of man, and they should never be interferred with. Hypnotism, mesmerism,
and mediumship are based on the submission of one will to another. The
one who desires control demands another's submission in mind and body to
his own willed thoughts and words of directive power. The effect on the
one who submits is always weakening, and, if continued, results in a
mental negation that makes him the victim of evil influences too
numerous to mention.

"Not my will, but thine, be done" is one of the most far-reaching
affirmations of Jesus, and those who follow Him and keep His sayings are
finding great peace and relaxation of mind and body.

Jesus, the mighty helper, is always present with those who are earnestly
seeking to be Christians and to keep the divine law.
