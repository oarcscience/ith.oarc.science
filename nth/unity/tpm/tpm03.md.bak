###  The Twelve Powers of Man 

THE SUBCONSCIOUS realm in man has twelve great centers of action, with
twelve presiding egos or identities. When Jesus had attained a certain
soul development, He called His twelve apostles to Him. This means that
when man is developing out of mere personal consciousness into spiritual
consciousness, he begins to train deeper and larger powers; he sends his
thought down into the inner centers of his organism, and through his
word quickens them to life. Where before his powers have worked in the
personal, now they begin to expand and work in the universal. This is
the first and the second coming of Christ, spoken of in the Scriptures.
The first coming is the receiving of Truth into the conscious mind, and
the Second Coming is the awakening and the regeneration of the
subconscious mind through the superconscious or Christ Mind.

Man expands and grows under divine evolution as an industrial plant
grows. As the business expands, it is found that system is necessary.
Instead of one man's being able to do the work with the assistance of a
few helpers, he requires many helpers. Instead of a few helpers, he
needs hundreds; and in order to promote efficiency he must have heads

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

for the various departments of the work. Scripture symbology calls the
heads of departments in man's consciousness the twelve apostles.

Each of these twelve department heads has control of a certain function
in soul or body. Each of these heads works through an aggregation of
cells that physiology calls a "ganglionic center." Jesus, the I AM or
central entity, has His throne in the top head, where phrenology locates
spirituality. This is the mountain where He so often went to pray. The
following outline gives a list of the Twelve, the faculties that they
represent, and the nerve centers at which they preside:

Faith--Peter--center of brain.

Strength--Andrew--loins.

Discrimination or Judgment--James, son of Zebedee--pit of stomach.

Love--John--back of heart.

Power--Philip--root of tongue.

Imagination--Bartholomew--between the eyes.

Understanding--Thomas--front brain.

Will--Matthew--center front brain.

Order--James, son of Alphaeus--navel.

Zeal--Simon the Cananaean--back head, medulla.

Renunciation or Elimination--Thaddaeus--abdominal region.

Life Conserver--Judas--generative function.

The physiological designations of these faculties are not arbitrary--the
names can be expanded or changed to suit a broader understanding of
their full nature. For example, Philip, at the root of the

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

tongue, governs taste; he also controls the action of the larynx, as
well as all vibrations of power throughout the organism. So the term
"power" expresses but a small part of his official capacity.

The first apostle that Jesus called was Peter. Peter represents faith in
things spiritual, faith in God. We begin our religious experience, our
unity with Divine Mind, by having faith in that mind as omnipresent,
all-wise, all-loving, all-powerful Spirit.

Faith in the spiritual man quickens spiritual understanding. Peter
believed that Jesus was the Messiah; his faith opened his spiritual
discernment, and he saw the living Christ back of the personal mask worn
by Jesus. When asked, "Who do men say that the Son of man is?" the
apostles, looking upon personality as the real, said: "Some say John the
Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
Then Jesus appealed to their own inner spiritual understanding and He
said: "But who say ye that I am?" Only Simon Peter answered: "Thou art
the Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered, "Thou art
Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades
\[the grave\] shall not prevail against it. I will give unto thee the
keys of the kingdom of heaven."

Spiritual discernment of the reality of man's origin and being is the
only enduring foundation of character. It was to this faith in the
understanding of the real being of man that Jesus gave power in earth
and heaven. It was not to the personal Peter that Jesus gave the keys to
His kingdom, but to all

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

who through faith apply the binding (affirming) and loosing (denying)
power of Spirit in the earth (substance consciousness). Right here and
now the great work of character-building is to be done, and whoever
neglects present opportunities, looking forward to a future heaven for
better conditions, is pulling right away from the kingdom of heaven
within himself.

People who live wholly in the intellect deny that man can know anything
about God, because they do not have quickened faith. The way to bring
forth the God presence, to make oneself conscious of God, is to say: I
have faith in God; I have faith in Spirit; I have faith in things
invisible. Such affirmations of faith, such praise to the invisible God,
the unknown God, will make God visible to the mind and will strengthen
the faith faculty. Thus faith (Peter) is called and instructed
spiritually.

When a center loses its power it should be baptized by the word of
Spirit. We are told in the Scriptures that Philip went down to Gaza
("the same is desert"), and there baptized a eunuch. Gaza means a
"citadel of strength." It refers to the nerve center in the loins, where
Andrew (strength) reigns. "Lo now, his strength is in his loins." Gaza
is the physical throne of strength, as Jerusalem is the throne of love.

The back grows weak under the burden of material thought. If you are
given to pains in your back, if you become exhausted easily, you may
know at once that you need treatment for freedom from

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

material burdens. Eliminate from your mind all thought of the burdens of
the world, the burdens of your life, and all seeming labors. Take your
burdens to Christ. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest."

We are pressed upon by ideas of materiality. Thoughts make things, and
the material ideas that are pressing upon us are just as substantial in
the realm of mind as material things are substantial in the realm of
matter. Everything has origin in thought, and material thoughts will
bring forth material things. So you should baptize and cleanse with your
spiritual word every center, as Philip baptized the eunuch of Gaza.
Baptism is cleansing. It always represents the erasing power of the
mind.

When the baptizing power of the word is poured upon a center, it
cleanses all material thought; impotence is vitalized with new life, and
the whole subconsciousness is awakened and quickened. The word of the
Lord is there sown in the body, and once the word of the Lord is sown in
any of these centers--the cells of which are like blank phonograph
records--they take the thought that is given them, and send it through
the whole organism. The baptism of strength goes to the uttermost parts
of the body, and every one of the twelve powers, under the divine law,
feels the new strength.

James, the son of Zebedee, represents discrimination and good judgment
in dealing with substantial things. James is the faculty in man that
wisely chooses and determines. It may be in the matter of

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

food; it may be in the matter of judgment about the relation of external
forces; it may be in the choosing of a wife or a husband--in a thousand
different ways this faculty is developed in man. The spiritual side of
the James faculty is intuition, quick knowing.

James and John are brothers, and Jesus called them "sons of thunder."
These brothers preside over the great body brain called the solar
plexus, or sun center. James has his throne at the pit of the stomach;
and John, just back of the heart. They are unified by bundles of nerves
and are metaphysically closely related. Whatever affects the stomach
will sympathetically affect the heart. People with weak stomachs nearly
always think they have heart trouble.

Jesus called those two apostles "sons of thunder." Tremendous vibrations
or emotions that go forth from the solar plexus. When your sympathies
are aroused, you will find that you begin to breathe deeply and
strongly, and if you are very sympathetic you can feel the vibrations as
they go out to the person or thing to which you are directing your
thoughts. All fervor, all the high energy that comes from soul, passes
through these centers.

Bartholomew represents the imagination. The imagination has its center
of action directly between the eyes. This is the point of expression for
a set of tissues that extend back into the brain and connect with an
imaging or picture-making function near the root of the optic nerve.
Through this faculty you can project an image of things that are
without, or

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

ideas that are within. For instance, you can project the image of
jealousy to any part of your body and, by the chemistry of thought
combined with function, make your complexion yellow, or you can image
and project beauty by thinking goodness and perfection for everybody.
Bartholomew is connected directly with the soul, and has great power in
the pictures of the mind. Jesus saw him under a fig tree, a long way
off, before he was visible to the natural eye. Do not imagine anything
but good, because under the law of thought combined with substance it
will sooner or later come into expression, unless you head it off,
eliminate it by denial.

Man has faculties of elimination, as well as of appropriation. If you
know how to handle them you can expel error from your thought body. The
denial apostle is Thaddaeus, presiding in the abdominal region, the
great renunciator of the mind and the body. All the faculties are
necessary to the perfect expression of the man. None is despised or
unclean. Some have been misunderstood; through ignorance man has called
them mean, until they act in that way and cause him pain and sorrow. The
elimination, by Thaddaeus, of the waste of the system through the bowels
is a very necessary function.

Thomas represents the understanding power of man. He is called the
doubter because he wants to know about everything. Thomas is in the
front brain, and his collaborator, Matthew, the will, occupies the same
brain area. These two faculties are jointly in occupation of this part
of the "promised land." Like

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, their inheritance in undivided.

James, the son of Alphaeus, represents divine order. His center is at
the navel.

Simon, the Cananaean, represents zeal; his center is at the medulla, at
the base of the brain. When you burn with zeal and are anxious to
accomplish great things, you generate heat at the base of your brain. If
this condition is not balanced by the co-operation of the supplying
faculties, you will burn up the cells and impede the growth of the soul.
"For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up."

Judas, who betrayed Jesus, has his throne in the generative center.
Judas governs the life consciousness in the body, and without his wise
co-operation the organism loses its essential substance, and dies. Judas
is selfish; greed is his "devil." Judas governs the most subtle of the
"beasts of the field"--sensation; but Judas can be redeemed. The Judas
function generates the life of the body. We need life, but life must be
guided in divine ways. There must be a righteous expression of life.
Judas, the betrayer of Jesus, must in the end be cleansed of the devil,
selfishness; having been cleansed, he will allow the life force to flow
to every part of the organism. Instead of being a thief (drawing to the
sex center the vital forces necessary to the substance of the whole man)
Judas will become a supplier; he will give his life to every faculty. In
the prevailing race consciousness Judas drains the whole man, and the
body dies as a result of his selfish thievery.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

It is through Judas (the desire to appropriate and to experience the
pleasure of sensation) that the soul (Eve) is led into sin. Through the
sins of the sex life (casting away of the precious substance), the body
is robbed of its essential fluids and eventually disintegrates. The
result is called death, which is the great and last enemy to be overcome
by man. Immortality in the body is possible to man only when he has
overcome the weaknesses of sensation, and conserves his life substance.
When we awaken to the realization that all indulgence for pleasure alone
is followed by pain, then we shall know the meaning of eating of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil, or pleasure and pain.

If you would build up your faculties under the divine law, redeem Judas.
First have faith in the power of Spirit, and then speak to Judas the
word of purity. Speak to him the word of unselfishness; baptize him with
the whole Spirit--Holy Spirit. If there is in you a selfish desire to
exercise sensation, to experience the pleasures of sense in any of its
avenues, give that desire to the Lord; in no other way can you come into
eternal life.

These twelve powers are all expressed and developed under the guidance
of Divine Mind. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith
Jehovah of hosts." You must keep the equipoise; you must, in all the
bringing forth of the twelve powers of man, realize that they come from
God: that they are directed by the Word of God, and that man (Jesus) is
their head.
