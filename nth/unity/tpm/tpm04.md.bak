###  The Development of Faith 

FAITH has an abiding place in man's consciousness. This place of abiding
is described in the Scriptures as the "house of Simon and Andrew." A
house is a structure that some person has built for a home. A man's
house is his castle. Perhaps generation after generation is born and
reared in the same house. The house where a great genius was born is
preserved with care, and it is visited year after year by those who are
devotees of the one who expressed some great thought, art, or discovery.
If the barn cave at Bethlehem, where Jesus was born, were found, it
would become the most famous shrine in the world. The importance that we
give to the places where great men and women were born is founded on the
centralizing power of thought. All structures are thought
concentrations. Constructive thinking ultimates in the construction of
places of abode. Savages do not build houses or cities, because they do
not think constructively.

In the time of David the Children of Israel were nomads. The
consciousness of indwelling Spirit had not been born in their minds, and
could not, in consequence, be formed in their bodies. That the time was
ripe for a more constructive state of mind is set forth in these words
of Jehovah, in II Samuel 7:5, 6:

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in? for
I have  
not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the  
children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have  
walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.  
</span>

</div>

After receiving this message, David, the drawing power of love, began
gathering material for Solomon's Temple. Jehovah told David that he
could not build the Temple because he was a man of war. The temple of
God is man's body ("Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit"), but if
man has not complied with the law of permanent body building, he is like
the nomadic Children of Israel; he goes from body to body and from
tabernacle to tabernacle.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Except Jehovah build the house,  
They labor in vain that build it.  
</span>

</div>

The tents and the tabernacles that the Children of Israel built for
Jehovah represent the transitory bodies of flesh. The Lord has merely
"walked" in these flimsy temples; they have not afforded an abiding
place for Spirit, because of their unsubstantial character. The
underlying weakness of the tent body was its lack of faith in the
inhabiting soul. A new consciousness of the indwelling spiritual
substance and life was necessary, and a man was chosen to bring it
forth. This man, named Abraham, represents obedience and faith. His
original name was Abram, which means "exalted father." The name is
identified with the highest cosmic principle, the all-pervading,
self-existent spiritual substance, which is the primary source of the
universe.

Abraham was tested again and again, to the end

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

that he might be strong in faith. His great test of faith was his
willingness to sacrifice his beloved son Isaac in the mountain of the
Lord. "And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is
said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided."

This incident is intended to show the necessity of a man's giving up
that which he considers his dearest possession before he can realize the
divine providence. The incident takes place in the mount of the Lord;
that is, in a high spiritual understanding.

The law of giving and receiving pertains to the realm of ideas; one must
give up personal attachments before one can receive the universal. If a
parent idealizes a child, loves it so dearly that its pleasure is first
in his consciousness, the spiritual development of the parent is
impeded. Then, before the love of God (which is the supreme thing) can
fill the heart, there must be a sacrifice of human love. If like Abraham
one is faithful and obedient and willing to give to the Lord his most
precious possession, there is always a receiving or providing
equivalent.

When Abraham was willing to sacrifice his beloved Isaac, the Lord stayed
his hand; his attention was directed to a ram in a thicket nearby, and
he was directed to sacrifice the animal upon the altar, in place of the
child. Here is illustrated an often misunderstood law of sacrifice or
renunciation. We do not have to give up our cherished things, if they
are

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

real, but the error that prevents their full expression must be
destroyed. The ram (which represents the resistance and opposition of
personality to the complete expression of Truth) must be sacrificed.

"Give, and it shall be given unto you" is the statement of a law that
operates in every thought and act of man. This law is the foundation of
all barter and financial exchange. Men scheme to get something for
nothing; but the law, in one of its many forms, overtakes them in the
end. Even metaphysicians, who above all people should understand the
law, often act as if they expected God to provide abundantly for them
before they have earned abundance. It is an error to think that God
gives anybody anything that has not been earned. The Holy Spirit comes
upon those who pray in the "upper room." The "upper room" corresponds to
the "mount of Jehovah." It is the high place in consciousness where man
realizes the presence of Divine Mind. The greatest work that one can do
is to strive to know God and to keep His law. God pays liberally for
this service and the reward is sure. Faith is built up in consciousness
under this law.

"Faith is assurance of things hoped for." When there has been an
aspiration and a reaching out for the spiritual life, the faith faculty
becomes active in consciousness. The prayer of supplication is
impotent--the prayer of affirmation is immediately effective.

Intellectual faith admits doubt, and hope of fulfillment in the future;
spiritual faith includes unfailing

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

assurance and immediate response. These two attitudes of faith are often
observed acting and reacting upon each other. Peter started to walk on
the water in spiritual faith, but when he saw the effects of the wind he
was afraid, and began to sink. Then the I AM (Jesus) gave its hand of
spiritual power, the wind ceased, and there was no longer any doubt of
faith's ability to rise above the negative consciousness.

The first and greatest disciple of Jesus was Peter, who has been
universally accepted by the followers of Jesus the Christ as a type
representing faith. Before he met Jesus, Peter was called Simon. Simon
means "hearing," which represents receptivity. We understand from this
that listening to Truth in a receptive state of mind opens the way for
receiving the next degree in the divine order, which is faith. Jesus
gave Peter his new name and also its meaning: "Thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build my church."

Faith in the reality of the invisible builds a real, abiding substance
in mind and in body. All kinds of ideas grow quickly when planted in
this rich substance of the mind. Jesus also called this substance of
faith the "earth," and He said to Peter, "Whatsoever thou shalt bind
\[affirm\] on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt
loose \[deny\] on earth shall be loosed in heaven." In all His teaching
Jesus emphasized that the ruling forces of both heaven and earth are in
man. "The kingdom of God is within you." "All authority hath been given
unto me in heaven and on earth." "Is it not

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?" When we understand the
omnipresence of Spirit (God) we quickly see how simple and true this
beautiful doctrine of Jesus is.

There is but one real faith; the avenue of expression determines the
character and power of faith. Trust is a cheaper brand of faith, but
trust is better than mistrust. As a rule, people who merely trust in the
Lord do not understand all the law. If they had understanding they would
affirm the presence and power of God until the very substance of Spirit
would appear in consciousness--and this is faith established on a rock.

Faith words should be expressed both silently and audibly. The power of
the spoken word is but slightly understood, because the law of the Word
is not rightly observed. The Word is the creative idea in Divine Mind,
which may be expressed by man when he has fulfilled the law of
expression. All words are formative but not all words are creative. The
creative word lays hold of Spirit substance and power. Physical science
hints at this inner substance and energy, in its description of the
almost inconceivable power inherent in the universal ether. We are told
that the manifest forces, such as heat, light, and electricity, are but
faint manifestations of an omnipresent element which is thousands of
times greater than these weak expressions.

Radio is opening up a new field of activity in the use of the spoken
word. A newspaper article on the wireless telephone says:

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Do you happen to know that a single word spoken in
Lower  
Broadway, New York, among the skyscrapers, could break  
every pane of glass in adjacent buildings and create a  
disturbance that would be felt for a mile in every  
direction?  
The human voice, transformed into electrical energy for  
wireless transmission, develops 270 horse power. The power  
of ten men is equal to one horse power. The human voice  
electrified for wireless purposes is equivalent to the  
power of 2,700 men. In the various processes that step up a  
voice for radio transmission across the Atlantic ocean, it  
becomes 135,000 times more powerful than when uttered by  
the person sending the message.  
Thus, starting with an initial energy of 1/1,000 of an  
electric watt, the voice is boosted by a powerful station  
until it is intensified 100 million times.  
</span>

</div>

If the spoken word can be mechanically intensified a hundred million
times, how much greater will be its power when energized by Spirit! When
Jesus said with a loud voice to Lazarus, "Come forth," He must have made
contact with the creative word referred to in the 1st chapter of John,
because the results showed its life-giving character. When He healed the
centurion's servant by His word sent forth on invisible currents, He
said that the work was done through faith. So faith must boost the
spoken word even more than a hundred million times, as evidenced by its
marvelous results. That the word of faith has an inner force, and that
this force rushes forth and produces remarkable transformations in the
phenomenal world, is the testimony of thousands who have witnessed its
results.

Jesus said: "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and
it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you." He knew
about the great spiritual machinery that the word of faith sets into
action. He illustrated how man spiritually developed could by faith
control the elements, quell storms, walk on water, retard or increase
the growth of life and substance in grains, trees, animals, and men.

The ponderous dynamos that generate electricity to light a city are set
going by a touch on a button. There is a button in the mind of man that
connects him, through faith, with almighty energy. When the word of
faith is spoken to large tumors and they melt away, is not the
transformation equal to the removal of mountains? When a paralyzed limb,
or a lifeless organ, is quickened and restored to natural functioning,
is not that quickening a raising of the dead?

It is not necessary that the one who touches the button of faith shall
understand all the intricate machinery with which he makes contact; he
knows, like one who turns the electric switch, that the light or power
will spring forth. The faith center, the pineal gland, opens the mind of
man to spiritual faith. Merely affirming the activity of this superpower
will quicken it in consciousness. Jesus said, "I speak not from myself:
but the Father \[faith\] abiding in me doeth his works."

The transformers of electricity are paralleled by the transforming power
of mind. That if a man

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

sanely believes he can do a thing he will eventually find a way to do it
is an accepted axiom of psychology. The mind generates an energy that
contacts the universal energy, and causes circumstances and events to
fall into line for the attainment of the latent ideal. John came crying
in the wilderness of mortal thought, "Repent ye"; that is, change your
mind. Paul discerned a like necessity, hence his call: "Be ye
transformed by the renewing of your mind."

When people see the possibilities that follow a right change of mind,
they will crowd the halls of metaphysical teachers as they now crowd
moving-picture shows. When it is clearly understood that doubt, fear,
poverty, disease, and death--every thought, good or bad, that men have
expressed--have existence through mind we shall see a shifting of
consciousness and a radical change in thought and word by everybody of
sane mind. Then we shall ask for the true source and find it, as did
Paul, who said: "Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus."
It was not Jesus but the mind in Jesus that did the great works. He was
the center of faith that transformed the mighty creative forces of Being
(which are active in the universe through the mind and brain of man)
into a form of force usable in His environment. Tap this inner reservoir
of faith, and you can do what Jesus did. That was His promise; its
fulfillment is the test of a true follower.

"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death . . . By
faith Noah . . . prepared an

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

ark to the saving of his house . . . By faith Abraham, being tried,
offered up Isaac . . . By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three
months by his parents . . . By faith the walls of Jericho fell down . .
. And what shall I more say? for the time will fail me if I tell of
Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and Samuel and the prophets:
who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained
promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire,
escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed
mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens. Women received their
dead by a resurrection."
