###  The Work of the Imagination in Regeneration 

WHEN THE faculties of the mind are understood in their threefold
relation--spirit, soul, body--it will be found that every form and shape
originated in the imagination. It is through the imagination that the
formless takes form. It is well known that the artist sees in mind every
picture that he puts on canvas. Man and the universe are a series of
pictures in the Mind of Being. God made man in His image and likeness.
Man, in his turn, is continually making and sending forth into his mind,
his body, and the world about him living thought forms embodied and
indued with his whole character. These images are formed in the front
brain, and clothed with substance and life drawn from subcenters in the
body.

Very intellectual people, concentrating the intensity of their thought
in the head, fail to connect with the substance, life, and love centers
in the body, and their work, although it may be very brilliant, lacks
what we term "soul." The thought creations of this type seldom live
long. Where the thought form and its substance are evenly balanced, the
projected idea endures indefinitely. Jesus was a

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

man thoroughly conversant with this law, and every idea that He clothed
has lived and grown in wisdom and power in the minds of those who make
union with Him in faith and spiritual understanding. He said: "Heaven
and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."

Among the apostles, Bartholomew represents the imagination. He is called
Nathanael in the 1st chapter of John, where it is recorded that Jesus
saw him under the fig tree--the inference being that Jesus discerned
Nathanael's presence before the latter came into visibility. This would
indicate that images of people and things are projected into the imaging
chamber of the mind and that by giving them attention one can understand
their relation to outer things. Mind readers, clairvoyants, and dreamers
have developed this capacity to varying degree. Where consciousness is
primary in soul unfoldment there is confusion, because of lack of
understanding of the fundamental law of mind action. Forms are always
manifestations of ideas. One who understands this can interpret the
symbols shown to him in dreams and visions, but lack of understanding of
this law makes one a psychic without power. Joseph was an interpreter
because he sought the one creative Mind for guidance. "And Joseph
answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an
answer of peace." When Pharaoh told him the dream about the fat kine and
the lean kine, Joseph at once gave the real meaning of the dream; he
understood the metaphysical law. The

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

early Christians had understanding of this law. The same law is in
existence today and can be used more effectually by us, the reincarnated
followers of Jesus, because mind and its modes of action are now better
understood.

The Spirit of truth projects into the chamber of imagery pictures that,
rightly understood, will be a sure guide for all people who believe in
the omnipresence of mind. Everybody dreams, but the great majority do
not attempt to interpret the handwriting on the wall of the mind, or
they take their dreams literally and, because the dreams do not come
true, consider them foolish. Through ignorance of the law with which
imagination works, man has made imagination a byword. We look upon
imaginary things as trivial, yet we know that through the imagination we
can produce wonderful changes in the body. Studying this law, we find
that the character of both soul and body is determined by the
imagination and its associated faculties. Paul referred to this power of
the imagination when he wrote:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a
mirror the  
glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from  
glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.  
</span>

</div>

There has been much speculation about the method that Jesus used to
impart spiritual understanding to His apostles and other early
Christians, who were wonderfully illumined. It is true that the Twelve
apostles had His personal instruction, but it was apparently preparatory
only; the thorough training

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

was to follow. Jesus promised that the Spirit of truth would, in His
name, come as teacher, guide, and instructor. He did not say how Spirit
would guide and teach those who believed in Him; we gain this conclusion
from their experiences in the new school of life to which He introduced
them.

It is possible to impart Truth through direct inspiration, but this
requires a student with a development of mind superior to the average,
and Jesus sought converts in every walk of life. So we find that the
simple and universally intelligible avenue of visions and dreams, the
work of the imagination, was adopted as an important means by which the
believers were instructed and called together. In fact, a large part of
the work of the early church was carried forward by this means.

Saul was converted by a vision. Jesus appeared to him in person and
rebuked him for his persecution of the Christians, told him that He had
a work for him to do, and gave him directions as to his future
movements.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">And as he \[Saul\] journeyed, it came to pass that
he drew  
nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about  
him a light out of heaven: and he fell upon the earth, and  
heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest  
thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am  
Jesus whom thou persecutest; but rise, and enter into the  
city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. And the  
men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the  
voice, but beholding no man. And Saul arose from the earth;  
and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led  
him by the hand, and brought  
</span>

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

him into Damascus. And he was three days without sight, and  
did neither eat nor drink.  

</div>

Those who look to the Holy Spirit for guidance find that its instruction
is given to all who believe in Christ, and they are often drawn together
by direction of the inner voice, or by a dream, or by a vision. Saul,
after beholding the blinding light of the spiritual realms, needed to
have his sight restored. The brightness, or high potency, of Jesus'
glorified presence had confused his intellectual consciousness, and this
had brought about blindness. He needed the harmonious, peace-giving
power of one who understood the inner life, and this was found in a
certain disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to Ananias in a vision:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Arise, and go to the street which is called
Straight, and  
inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of  
Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth; and he hath seen a man  
named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that  
he might receive his sight. But Ananias answered, Lord, I  
have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to  
thy saints at Jerusalem: and here he hath authority from  
the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name. But  
the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen  
vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and  
kings, and the children of Israel: for I will show him how  
many things he must suffer for my name's sake. And Ananias  
departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands  
on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who  
appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent  
me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with  
the Holy Spirit. And straightway there  
</span>

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his  
sight; and he arose and was baptized; and he took food and  
was strengthened.  

</div>

The Lord's appearing to Saul, with the conversion of the latter, is
considered one of the great miracles of the Bible, but the experience of
Ananias is seldom mentioned. Yet we are told in this text that the Lord
appeared to Ananias and talked to him, just as He had appeared and
talked to Saul, and there was apparently no difference in the real
character of the incidents, except such be found in the mental attitude
of the participants. Saul was antagonistic and full of fight. Ananias
was receptive and obedient; he doubtless had received this sort of
guidance many times. From the text we readily discern his spiritual
harmony. He knew the reputation of Saul and protested against meeting
him, but the Lord explained the situation and Ananias obeyed.

Today disciples of Jesus who are obedient and receptive and believe in
the presence and the power of the Master and the Holy Spirit, are
everywhere receiving visions and dreams. They are being drawn together
and are helping one another to recover from the discords and inharmonies
of life. Never before in the history of the race has there been so great
a need for spiritual instruction as there is now, and this need is being
met by Jesus and His aids in a renaissance of early Christianity and of
its methods of instruction.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

Spirit imparts its ideas through a universal language. Instead of being
explained by words and phrases as used in ordinary language, the idea is
formed and projected in its original character. This system of
transferring intelligence is called symbolism. It is the only universal
and correct means of communicating ideas. For example, if one wished to
tell about a procession that he had seen, and could mentally picture it
so that others could see it, how much more complete the communication
than descriptive words! The mind formulates into thought images every
idea that arises in it, and then tries to express it in language, which
is nearly always inadequate. The French say: "Words are employed to
conceal ideas." As the early disciples of Jesus had to learn that the
symbol represents the idea rather than the thing, so modern disciples,
following the same line of instruction, should not allow the intellect
to materialize their dreams and visions; although they may be puzzled,
like Peter, subsequent events will bring to them a clearer understanding
of the lesson.

In the 10th chapter of Acts, we read:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the
sixth  
hour: and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while  
they made ready, he fell into a trance; and he beholdeth  
the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it  
were a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the  
earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and  
creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven. And  
there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter;  
</span>

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

kill and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have  
never eaten anything that is common and unclean. And a  
voice came unto him again a second time, What God hath  
cleansed, make not thou common. And this was done thrice:  
and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven.  
Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the  
vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that  
were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's  
house, stood before the gate, and called and asked whether  
Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodging there. And  
while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto  
him, Behold, three men seek thee.  

</div>

Peter was still bound by the Jewish teaching that there was no salvation
for any except those of his faith, and this vision was to break the
bondage of such narrowness and show him that the gospel of Jesus Christ
is for all people. In a vision the Lord had already instructed
Cornelius, the Roman soldier, that he should send certain of his
servants to Joppa and fetch Peter to Caesarea.

Some advocates of flesh eating make the mistake of giving a literal
interpretation to Peter's vision, holding that the Lord commanded him to
kill and eat "all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the
earth and birds of the heaven," and that God has cleansed them and thus
prepared them for food for man. If this view of the vision should be
carried out literally, we should eat all fourfooted animals, including
skunks, all the creeping things, and all birds of the air, including
vultures. We know, however, that the vision is to be taken

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

in its symbolizing meaning. Peter was to appropriate and harmonize in
his inner consciousness all thoughts of separation, all uncleanliness
and impurity, narrowness, selfishness--the thoughts that bring diversity
and separation.

We have within us, bound in the cage of the subconsciousness, all the
propensities and the savagery of the animals. In the regeneration these
are brought forth and a great reconciliation takes place. We find that
there is really nothing unclean, except to human consciousness. In the
original creative idealism of Divine Mind, everything was made perfect
and sanctified and pronounced "very good." But God did not tell man to
eat everything because it was good in its place.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb
yielding  
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every  
tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you  
it shall be for food.  
</span>

</div>

When man has regenerated and lifted up the beasts of the field, he will
carry out the injunction given to the original Adam and name them
"good."

Man's body represents the sum total of the animal world, because in its
evolution it has had experience in nearly every type of elemental form.
These memories are part of the soul, and in the unregenerate they come
to the surface sporadically. Sometimes whole nations seem to revert from
culture to savagery without apparent cause, but there is always a cause.
These reversions are the result of

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

some violent wrenching of the soul, or of concentration, to the
exclusion of everything else, on a line of thought out of harmony with
divine law. When the soul is ready for its next step in the upward way,
a great change takes place, known as regeneration. Jesus referred to
this when He said to Nicodemus: "Ye must be born anew." In one of its
phases the new birth is a resurrection. All that man has passed through
has left its image in the subconsciousness, wrought in mind and matter.
These images are set free in the regeneration, and man sees them as part
of himself. In his "Journal," George Fox, the spiritual-minded Quaker,
says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I was under great temptations sometimes, and my
inward  
sufferings were heavy; but I could find none to open my  
condition to but the Lord alone, unto whom I cried night  
and day. I went back into Nottinghamshire, where the Lord  
shewed me that the natures of those things which were  
hurtful without, were within the hearts and minds of wicked  
men. The natures of dogs, swine, vipers, of Sodom and  
Egypt, Pharaoh, Cain, Ishmael, Esau, etc. The natures of  
these I saw within, though people had been looking without.  
I cried to the Lord saying, "Why should I be thus, seeing I  
was never addicted to commit those evils?" And the Lord  
answered, "It was needful I should have a sense of all  
conditions, how else should I speak of all conditions?" In  
this I saw the infinite love of God. I saw also, that there  
was an ocean of darkness and death; but an infinite ocean  
of light and love, which flowed over the ocean of darkness.  
In that also I saw the infinite love of God, and I had  
great openings. As I was walking by the steeple-house side  
in the town of Mansfield, the Lord said unto me, "That  
which people trample upon must be  
</span>

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

thy food." And as the Lord spake he opened to me that  
people and professors trampled upon the life, even the life  
of Christ was trampled upon; they fed upon words, and fed  
one another with words; but trampled under foot the blood  
of the son of God, which blood was my life: and they lived  
in their airy notions talking of him. It seemed strange to  
me at the first, that I should feed on that which the high  
professors trampled upon; but the Lord opened it clearly to  
me by his eternal Spirit and power.  

</div>

In the regeneration man finds that he has, in the part of his soul
called the natural man, animal propensities corresponding to the animals
in the outer world. In the pictures of the mind, these take form as
lions, horses, oxen, dogs, cats, snakes, and the birds of the air. The
visions of Joseph, Daniel, John, and other Bible seers were of this
character. When man understands that these animals represent thoughts,
working in the subconsciousness, he has a key to the many causes of
bodily conditions. It is clear to him that the prophets of old were
using symbols to express ideas, and he sees that to interpret these
symbols he must learn what each represents, in order to get the original
meaning.

According to Genesis, the original creation was ideal, and through man
the ideal was given character and form. Adam gave character to all the
beasts of the field: "and whatever the man called every living creature,
that was the name thereof." To the spiritually wise it is revealed that,
when man is fully redeemed, he redeems and purifies and uplifts the
animals in himself. The animal world will go

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

through a complete transformation when the race is redeemed. As Isaiah
says, "the wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat
straw like the ox." Some even go farther than this, and say that in the
millennium there will be no necessity for animals; that they are, in
reality, the dissipated forces of the human family and that when those
forces are finally gathered into the original fount in the subjective,
there will be no more animals in the objective; that in this way man
will be immensely strengthened and a certain connection will be made
between the so-called material and the spiritual.
