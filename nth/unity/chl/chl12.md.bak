###  Lesson Ten Will and Understanding 

1\. "If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching."
Man manifests that which exists eternally in Being. We talk about the
faculties of man's mind as if they belonged to the individual and had
origin in him. Man exists in the one invisible Mind. He may assume to
have a mind of his own, but his origin and destiny are in God-Mind.

2\. Primal causes are complete, finished, absolute. All that man
manifests has its origin in a cause that we name Divine Mind, Spirit,
God. This being true in logic and intuition, it is not a difficult
matter to arrive at the conclusion that the manifestation proves the
character of the cause. In dealing with the faculties of man, the
relation between them and the one Mind should not be lost sight of.
There is but one Mind, and that Mind cannot be separated or divided,
because, like the principle of mathematics, it is indivisible. All that
we can say of the one Mind is that it is absolute and that all its
manifestations are in essence like itself. This brings us to the true
estimate of man, and when we speak of spiritual man, or Christ man, or
the son of God, we refer to this original expression of Divine Mind.

3\. In analyzing these faculties and in establishing their relation in
the individual consciousness, we should clearly understand that they are
never separated from their Principle, the Divine Mind. In the

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

text quoted above, Jesus refers to two of the powers of man and brings
out a certain phase of their relation. Will and know designate the
faculties of mind that we term will and understanding. Through
appropriation, through expansion and growth in consciousness, will and
understanding would seem to have their source in individual man. But,
however adapted by man, they can never be divorced from the mind of
Being, in which they exist as essential members of its wholeness.

4\. Individual consciousness is like an eddy in the ocean--all the
elements that are found in the ocean are also found in the eddy, and
every eddy may, in due course, receive and give forth all that is in the
ocean. As the will of God, man represents I AM identity. This is
individual consciousness, freedom to act without dictation of any kind,
selfhood without consciousness of cause, the power to make or break
without limitation, constructive and destructive ability with a universe
of workable potentialities. The will is the man. Without absolute
freedom of will, man would be an automaton. If his will were restricted
in the least degree on any side, he would not be perfectly free. We know
that God is the Great Unlimited, and man, His "image" and "likeness,"
must be of the same character; consequently man has the same freedom
that God has to act in the fulfillment of desire. God does not dictate
man's acts, although He may instruct and draw him through love away from
error. The idea that God makes man

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

do certain things cannot be true in a single instance, because, if it
were, man would not be a free agent. If God interfered with man's will
in some things, it would follow that He could interfere in any and all
things. Logic and observation clearly reveal the freedom of man in
everything.

5\. Creative thought uses the will to build up individual consciousness.
The Lord God, or Jehovah, of Genesis, is the original "I WILL BE THAT I
WILL BE." In mind, both Jehovah and Jesus mean I AM. I AM is man's
self-identity. I AM is the center around which man's system revolves.
When the I AM is established in a certain understanding of its
Principle, it is divinely guided in its acts, and they are in harmony
with divine law. This is the union of will and understanding. In the
Scripture these two are designated as Ephraim and Manasseh, sons of
Joseph. Their allotments in the Promised Land were joined, indicating
that these faculties work in the body from a single brain center. The
center is in the forehead.

6\. The will should never be retarded in its development, but should be
strengthened along all lines. The idea of breaking the will of children
is wholly erroneous. The perfect man is produced by rounding out the
will and joining it to the understanding. The idea of giving up the will
to God's will should not include the thought of weakening it, or causing
it to become in any way less; it properly means that the will is being
instructed how to act for the best. Do not act until you know how to
act.

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

"Look before you leap." This does not imply that one should be inactive
and indefinite, waiting for understanding, as do many persons who are
afraid to act because they may possibly do the wrong thing; it means
that understanding will be quickened and the will strengthened by the
confidence that comes as a result of knowledge.

7\. To strengthen the will, and at the same time to discipline it along
right lines, requires an understanding nothing less than divine. But man
can balance his will and his understanding; when he does this he will
always do the right thing at the right time. Nearly every mistake is the
result of will's acting without the cooperation of its brother,
understanding. When the will is permitted to act on its own account, man
becomes emotional and willful. These states of consciousness lead to all
kinds of bodily discord. Willfullness makes tenseness, and a tense mind
ties knots in the nerves, muscles, and tendons of the whole organism.
The metaphysician, observing these conditions, treats for relaxation of
will and for a general letting go of the whole system. The universal
treatment for this condition given by Jesus is, "Not my will, but thine,
be done." This surrender causes personal will to "let go," and a
unification of man's will with God's will takes place. When this is
accomplished, all goes well.

8\. Willful persons often complain of a feeling like that produced by a
tight band around the head. This feeling results from the pressure of
thought

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

substance, which the will has laid hold of and is clinging to with
centripetal force. In all such cases, and, in fact, in every sense of
pressure, treat against personal willfullness and affirm the divine
freedom.

9\. Every organ of the body is affected by the action of the will, and
when this faculty becomes fixed in a certain attitude, it holds the
whole body to its central affirmation. The determination to have one's
own way, regardless of the rights of others, tends to stop the free
action of the heart; the stomach is then sympathetically affected.
Persons affected in these ways seldom realize that they have a set
determination as to how things shall be done in their lives, and they
are sometimes slow in accepting the higher understanding that is
necessary to the untangling of mistakes made by the ignorant will.
Contrariness is another name for perverted will. An exaggerated idea of
self and its needs takes possession of the mind, and the will is used to
carry out this shortsighted policy. The result is a belittling of the
whole man. Persons who are contentious for their personal rights place
themselves in bondage to material conditions and stop spiritual growth.

10\. How shall we bring the divine will to bear? By understanding; by
appropriating universal wisdom; by affirming: Not my will, but thine, be
done. God is potential, unformed will; man is manifest God will, or
goodwill. When man links his will with the principle of divine force he
has superior executive capacity. He swiftly brings forth

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

faculties that, under the slow action of human personality, would take
ages to develop.

11\. There is a knowing quality in Divine Mind. God is supreme knowing.
That in man which comprehends is understanding; it knows and compares in
wisdom. Its comparisons are not made in the realm of form, but in the
realm of ideas. It knows how to accomplish things. We may know without
experience. The human family has learned by hard knocks that experience
is a severe schoolmaster. In the allegory of Adam and Eve, we see a
picture of man's falling under the sway of sensation (serpent) and
having to learn by experience. One of the esoteric meanings of serpent
is "experience." All the bitter lessons that come through blundering
ignorance can be evaded when men declare their divine understanding and
in it follow the divine guidance.

12\. For all willfullness, the healing treatment should be affirmations
of spiritual understanding. The will is not to be broken, but
disciplined. The absolute freedom of the individual must be maintained
at all hazards. God is the one principle; we are all as free to use God
as we are free to use the principles of mathematics or of music. The
principle never interferes, but if it is to be rightly applied we must
develop understanding. Freedom leads to many errors, but, since it is a
part of Being, man must learn to use it properly; he must learn that the
freedom of the law means control and conservation, not lust and license.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

13\. We should be careful not to enter into any healing system that
interferes with freedom. Hypnotism is not real healing. Any system that
suppresses the will is radically wrong. It is the work of the true
healer to instruct the patient, to show cause and remedy from the
viewpoint of spiritual understanding. All other methods are temporary.
The old states of mind will come again into action unless the causing
thought is uncovered and removed. A man may have a paralyzed arm through
selfish desire for money, and though he may find temporary relief in
mere mental suggestions of health, or hypnotism, he will never get
permanent healing until he understands the divine law governing
possessions, and conforms thereto.

14\. There are people who claim that they are being spiritually
developed through mediumship. This is error. If you believe that you are
under the control of another's will, if you give up to another will,
your own will is gradually weakened. If you continue to submit to the
domination of another, you will finally lose control of your own life.
The will must be strengthened by being constantly used in divine
understanding. Mesmerism weakens the will. Spiritual understanding
quickens and makes alive. God never puts anyone to sleep. "Awake, thou
that sleepest . . . and Christ shall shine upon thee."

15\. Never say, "I don't know," "I don't understand." Claim your Christ
understanding at all times, and declare: I am not under any spell of
human

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

ignorance. I am one with infinite understanding. The accumulation of
ignorance gathered through association with ignorant minds can be
dissolved by using the word. You may know by simply holding the thought
that you know. This is not egotism, but spiritual knowing. When you
declare divine understanding, you sometimes meet your old line of
thought and are disappointed. Right then continue to hold to your
declaration for knowing. Judge not by appearances. Do not act until you
get the assurance; if you keep close to Spirit by affirmation, the
assurance will come. Will it come by voice? No! You will know through
the faculty of intuition. Divine knowing is direct fusion of mind of God
with mind of man. Sometimes we are taught by symbols, visions, and the
like, but this is only one of the ways that Divine Mind has of
expressing itself. When the mind deals with God ideals it asks for no
symbols, visible or invisible, but rests on pure knowing. It was in this
consciousness that Jesus said: "Father, I thank thee that thou heardest
me. And I knew that thou hearest me always."

16\. A very practical application of the truth about the will can be
made in the matter of self-control. Those who try to get control through
suppressing the personal will fall short. We should be free to express
all that we are. If you are afraid of any force within you, your fear
leads to suppression. In the true self-control, the will and the
understanding both play a part. The feelings and appetites and

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

passions must be disciplined. They are not merely to be held in check by
the will, but they are to be lifted up and developed through the Christ
Mind.

17\. The problem of self-control is never settled until all that man is
comes into touch with the divine will and understanding. You must
understand all your forces before you can establish them in harmony.
This overcoming is easy if you go about it in the right way. But if you
try to take dominion through will, force, and suppression, you will find
it hard and will never accomplish any permanent results. Get your I AM
centered in God, and from that place of Truth speak true words. In this
way you will gain real spiritual mastery and raise your will
consciousness from the human to the divine.

18\. The will plays the leading part in all systems of thought
concentration. The simple statement, I will to be well, gathers the
forces of mind and body about the central idea of wholeness, and the
will holds the center just so long as the I AM continues its
affirmation. No one ever died until he let go his will to live, and
thousands live on and on through the force of a determined will.

19\. The "devil" that we are to overcome is the adverse will, which
seeks to master man in the without. This "adversary" troubles us because
we strive to maintain personal freedom instead of submitting to divine
guidance. Self-confidence is a virtue when founded on the Truth of
Being, but when it arises from the personal consciousness it keeps man
from

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

his dominion. Are you trying just from yourself to be free from the
traditions of the outer world, or are you resting in the understanding
and assurance that you are a son of God? To know yourself as a son of
God is to overcome the "devil"--the personal self. The "devil" makes you
believe that you are the son of the flesh. To overcome, say: I put Satan
behind me by the realization that God is my Father. I am centered in
Him, and all things are under His dominion. I live in the infinite Power
that produces all self-control. I have no necessity for controlling
people. Events and people are controlled by divine law. There is an
eternal law of justice. I am one with that law and I rest in it.

20\. Among the apostles of Jesus, Matthew represents the will, and
Thomas the understanding. Matthew was the taxgatherer who sat at the
gate, representing the executive part of the government; so the will is
the executive faculty of the mind and carries out the edicts of the I
AM. All thoughts that go into or out of man's consciousness pass the
gate at which sits the will, and if the will understands its office, the
character and the value of every thought are inquired into and a certain
tribute is exacted for the benefit of the whole man.

21\. Thomas, the understanding, is represented as under discipline; that
is, not yet in the light of Spirit. The understanding, in its first
steps in Truth, wants its lessons and accompanying demonstrations to be
couched in terms like those used in the outer

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

world. When Jesus showed Himself to Thomas, the latter said that he
would not believe unless he could see the prints of the nails and feel
the wound in the side of the Lord. This double proof was given him, and
Jesus said: "Be not faithless, but believing." Thomas was then
spiritually awakened and he made the acknowledgment: "My Lord and my
God."

22\. The people who are being educated in Truth through the written and
the spoken word will finally arrive at that place where the true light
from Spirit will dawn upon them, and they will, like Thomas, see with
spiritual understanding and have proof of the reality of the Christ
Mind.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

The Establishment Of Will And Understanding

(To be used in connection with Lesson Ten)

1\. My understanding is established in Divine Mind.

2\. "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."

3\. The will of God is ever uppermost in my consciousness.

4\. "Not my will, but thine, be done."

5\. I firmly believe the guiding Intelligence that directs all my
thoughts.

6\. "There is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth
them understanding."

7\. The willfullness and stubborness of the flesh have no power in me. I
am obedient to Spirit and receptive to all its secret thoughts.

8\. "Not . . . of the will of flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God."

9\. I am willing to change my mind.

10\. "Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind."

11\. The Christ of God is born in my consciousness, and I am glorified
in my understanding.
