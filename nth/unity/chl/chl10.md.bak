###  Lesson Eight Faith 

1\. Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things
not seen. . . . By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed
by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of
things which appear.

2\. In the 11th chapter of Hebrews, we find the achievements of faith
piled mountain high:

By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death. . . . By
Faith Noah . . . prepared an ark to the saving of his house. . . . By
faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac. . . . By faith Moses, when
he was born, was hid three months by his parents. . . . By faith the
walls of Jericho fell down. . . . And what shall I more say? for the
time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David
and Samuel and the prophets: who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought
righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched
the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were
made strong, waxed mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens.
Women received their dead by a resurrection.

3\. The idea that faith is something that has to do only with one's
religious experience is incorrect. Faith is a faculty of the mind that
finds its most perfect expression in the spiritual nature, but in order
to bring out one's whole character it should be developed in all its
phases. That it is a power is self-evident. People who have faith in
themselves achieve

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

far more than those who do not believe in their own ability. We call
this self-faith innate confidence, but confidence is only a form of
faith. Belief is another of the expressions of faith. Jesus apparently
made no distinction between faith and belief. He said, "Believe ye that
I am able to do this?" and "Whosoever . . . shall not doubt in his
heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall
have it." In an analysis of the constituent parts of man's
consciousness, we locate belief in the intellect, working in the thought
realm without contact with the more interior substance of Spirit, upon
which true faith is founded.

4\. In Spirit, faith is related to omnipresent substance or assurance.
Jesus used the same illustration when He referred to Peter, a type of
faith, as a rock upon which He would found His church. Here is proof
that faith is closely allied to the enduring, firm, unyielding forms of
earth substance. But free faith has power to do, and power to bring
about results in the affairs of those who cultivate it.

5\. Like the other faculties, faith has a center through which it
expresses outwardly its spiritual powers. Physiologists call this center
the pineal gland, and they locate it in the upper brain. By meditation
man lights up the inner mind, and he receives more than he can put into
words. Only those who have strengthened their interior faculties can
appreciate the wonderful undeveloped possibilities in man. The
physiologist sees the faculties as brain cells,

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

the psychologist views them as thought combinations, but the
spiritual-minded beholds them as pure ideas, unrelated, free,
all-potential.

6\. Faith can be extended in consciousness in every direction. It will
accomplish wonderful things if quickened and allowed free expression in
its native realm. When Jesus said, "If ye have faith as a grain of
mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder
place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you,"
He referred to faith's working in spiritual substance. Such results are
possible only to the faith that co-operates with creative law. Where
faith is centered in outer things, the results are not worthy of
mention. Men have named them luck, accident, chance, and the like. Such
charms seem to work for a little while, then suddenly change, so it is
evident that they are not under any enduring law.

7\. When faith is exercised in the intellectual realm, the results are
usually profitable to the man of brains. If he has faith in his art, or
his science, or his philosophy, it answers his purpose, for a time at
least, but it never gets beyond the traditions and experiences of
precedent. Intellectual people do no miracles through faith, because
they always limit its scope to what the intellect says is law. It is
when faith is exercised deep in spiritual consciousness that it finds
its right place, and under divine law, without variation or
disappointment, it brings results that are seemingly miraculous.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

8\. Faith has always played a very large part in the experiences of
religious people because they have given it free scope, expecting great
things through it from the Lord. But nearly all faith demonstrations
have been the result of a sort of blind confidence that God would carry
out whatever was asked of Him. Sometimes a petitioner has been
disappointed, and a series of disappointments has usually led to doubt
and to the conclusion that God has in some way changed His law. The
early Christians were taught by Jesus and His disciples to have faith in
God, and they did wonderful, so-called miraculous, works. As time went
on and their attention was more and more drawn to worldly things, the
Christians of a later day became separated from the spiritual forces
within them, and their faith lost its energy. Then they began teaching
that miracles were no longer necessary; that God had given them to the
early Christians because they did not have the Bible or an organized
church. They also taught that the miracles had been given to prove that
Jesus was the Son of God.

9\. Now we have a fuller understanding of the law of God, and know that
whatever has been done once can be done again under like conditions. If
Jesus and His disciples and the early Christians did marvelous things
through the prayer of faith, we can do likewise. All that is required is
perseverance in our use of faith until we make connection with the
higher realms of consciousness, where, as Jesus said, though our faith
be as small as the smallest of

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

seeds, it will spring forth and demonstrate its power to carry out every
desire into which we infuse it. "Nothing shall be impossible unto you,"
if your faith is in Spirit, and if your work is in harmony with Divine
Mind.

10\. The Christian religion has been a great factor in the development
of faith in the inner realms of man's being. "Blessed are they that have
not seen, and yet have believed." The power to see in Spirit is peculiar
to faith. In its outer expression this power is sight; interiorly it is
that which perceives the reality of the substance of Spirit. Mental
seeing is knowing; when we perceive the truth of a proposition, we say,
"I see, I see," meaning that we mentally discern.

11\. Faith in the reality of things spiritual develops the faith center
in the brain, called the pineal gland. When this mental eye is
illuminated with spiritual faith, it sheds a radiance that hovers like a
halo around the head and extends in lessening degree throughout the
whole body. "When thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of
light." The halo that the early artists painted around the heads of
saints was not imaginary, but real. This illuminating power of faith
covers the whole constitution of man, making him master of all the
forces centering about spiritual consciousness. Faith and prayer go hand
in hand.

12\. "The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy
is he that judgeth not himself

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

in that which he approveth." Have faith in what you do, and after it is
done do not condemn yourself. We all are seeking happiness, contentment,
and we know by experience that we are happy when we are in tune with our
environment. There is a great variety of ideas that cause us inharmony.
We think that if we have money and friends we can be happy; but things
do not make happiness. It is our mental attitude toward things that
fixes our relation to them, and the better we understand the innate
substance of the world about us, the more do we appreciate it.

13\. Faith is ever active, and it should be made the truth substance of
every idea. We should have faith in our own power, capacity, and
ability; if we are to have this faith our thoughts must be centered in
the great universal Mind. Success lies in God. Whatsoever is not of
faith is sin; then whatsoever is of faith is not sin. This is the new
standard of righteousness for the man who would "put on Christ." It is
his breastplate, his protection, while he is coming up into knowledge of
the absolute good. Sin is a missing of the mark, and we miss the mark by
not having faith.

14\. Faith in the reality, power, and willingness of the mental and
spiritual forces is absolutely essential to success in demonstrating the
higher law. Jesus was the herald of a set of laws that will
revolutionize the civilization of this world and will produce a new and
higher type of man. He spoke of a new condition for the uplift of the
race; He called it the

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

"kingdom of heaven," and He said that it must be built upon the
foundation typified by Peter (a rock), which is faith. The development
of the faith faculty in the mind is as necessary to the worker in
spiritual principles as is the development of the mathematical faculty
in the worker in mathematics. Neither of these faculties comes at a
bound fully formed into consciousness, but both grow by cultivation.
"Increase our faith," said the apostles, and Jesus answered: "Have faith
in God."

15\. Nearly all readers of Scripture recognize Peter as a type of faith.
By studying his experiences we may get suggestions on the development of
that faculty in ourselves. The fluctuating allegiance of Peter to Jesus
illustrates the growth of faith in one who has had no development of
that faculty. Faith and doubt contended for supremacy in Peter, and we
wonder why Jesus chose as His chief disciple this vacillating, weak, and
cowardly fisherman. But we observe that Peter was enthusiastic, bold at
times, receptive and patient under reproof. He had never walked on the
water, but when Jesus said, "Come," he boldly went out to meet Him.
Doubt entered his mind, and he sank; but the helping hand was extended
to him and he was made stronger by the experience. This and many other
illustrations in the history of Peter show how faith grows in the mind,
and we should not be discouraged if our first efforts fall short of the
desired end.

16\. A very little faith often produces surprising

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

results. The forces invisible are much closer than we think, and when we
turn our attention in their direction the response is usually so
pronounced and so swift that we cannot but feel that a miracle has been
performed. A more intimate acquaintance with the divine law convinces us
that under it all things are possible if we only believe, and if we at
the same time conform our thoughts to its principle.

17\. Peter (faith), James (judgment), and John (love) were the three
apostles who were very close to Jesus, and they are more prominent in
His history than any of the others. This indicates that these three
faculties are developed in advance of the others, also that they are
closely associated. Understanding reveals to us that God is a
mind-principle whose foundation is ideas. When this character of the
creative principle dawns upon us, we see how easy it is to commune with
God. Through this communion we almost unconsciously strengthen faith,
and we find that one faculty helps another to grow. But there must be
room in which to grow, and room is made by love. Selfishness is
limitation; it binds man in a little prison called personality. The only
way to enlarge one's character and give play to all the faculties is
through love. Love enlarges the field of consciousness by leveling the
thoughts of enmity and opposition. Make friends with all your
adversaries quickly, whether they be persons, thoughts, or things.

18\. We are constantly making conditions

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

through our thoughts. Some people declare that everything is against
them. If they miss a car, they say, "It is always that way," and they
build up a state of mind in which everything seems contrary to them.

19\. In all our experience we should condemn nothing that comes to us
and nothing that we do. We know the law; let us keep it, and not set up
any adverse conditions by our thoughts of condemnation. Whatever you are
doing, be happy in it. If you are getting wrong results, do not believe
in an angry God. You are getting the results of your acts, according to
your faith. Be wise; pronounce nothing evil, and only good will come.
Shall we call everything good? Yes. If the savage knew this law he could
lift himself to a higher consciousness by it. We get out of savagery by
idealizing the good.

20\. Have faith in the innate goodness of all men and all conditions. Do
not condemn, no matter how great the provocation. What you think, you
create in your own consciousness. Enlarge your range of vision, and you
may see good in what now seems evil. God is good and God is all, hence
there can be no real condition but the good. Why should we waste our
time fighting evil? If we build our character upon faith, understanding,
and love, with the great I AM as the focal center, we shall become
pillars in the temple of God.
