*Christian Healing: the science of being*, by Charles Fillmore,

###  

These are not simply lectures; they are, rather, lessons. They are not
merely to be read; they are to be studied and applied as one studies and
applies mathematical rules.

When the text suggests that the reader "hold a thought," or affirm or
deny a certain proposition, the student should stop reading, and both
audibly and mentally do as bidden. This will set up new thought currents
in mind and body, and will make way for the spiritual illumination that
will follow in all who are faithful to these instructions.

The statements following each lesson should be used for mental
discipline. Write these statements down and apply them daily while
studying the lesson to which they correspond. Anyone can do spiritual
healing who will use the simple rules of denial and affirmation here set
forth. If you wish to heal another, hold him in mind and mentally repeat
the denials and affirmations; this will raise your consciousness to
spiritual reality, where all healing power originates. If you wish to
heal yourself, talk to your mind and body as you would talk to a
patient.
