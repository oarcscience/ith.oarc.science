###  Lesson Six The Word 

1\. In pure metaphysics there is but one word, the Word of God. This is
the original creative Word, or thought, of Being. It is the "God said"
of Genesis. It is referred to in the 1st chapter of John as the Logos.
It cannot be adequately translated into English. In the original it
includes wisdom, judgment, power, and, in fact, all the inherent
potentialities of Being. This divine Logos was and always is in God; in
fact, it is God as creative power. The Divine Mind creates under law;
that is, mental law. Man may get a comprehension of the creative process
of Being by analyzing the action of his own mind. First is mind, then
the idea in mind of what the act shall be, then the act itself. In
Divine Mind the idea is referred to as the Word.

2\. According to Genesis and all other mystical writings bearing upon
creation, Divine Mind expresses its Word, and through the activity of
that Word the universe is brought forth. Man is the consummation of the
Word, and his spirit has within it the concentration of all that is
contained within the Word. Jesus is called the Word of God. "The Word
became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of
the only begotten from the Father)." God being perfect, His idea,
thought, Word, must be perfect. The perfect Word of God is spiritual
man. It is through spiritual man, or the

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

Word of God, that all things are made, are brought into manifestation."
"And without him was not anything made that hath been made." The Word is
the "only begotten" of God, because there is but one idea of man in
Divine Mind, and that idea is the perfect pattern of man's character.

3\. In the 1st chapter of John it is implied that there are things made
that are not after divine ideals, consequently not real. The creations
of the Word of God are permanent and incorruptible. As an imitator of
Divine Mind, man has power to form and make manifest whatsoever he
idealizes; but unless his thought is unified with Divine Mind and guided
in its operations by infinite wisdom, his thought forms are perishable.

4\. Mental processes enter into all creations. Physical science has
discovered that every atom has substance, force, and intelligence; these
are the three constituent parts of mind. Mind is the one and only
creative power, and all attempts to account for creation from any other
standpoint are futile. The creative processes of mind are continuously
operative; creation is going on all the time, but the original plan, the
design in Divine Mind, is finished.

5\. Man cannot know how the thought, or Word, works except through his
own consciousness; consequently he must understand, control, and put in
order his own word, for through it he comprehends the Word of God. Our
most important study, then, is our own consciousness. The old Greeks
recognized

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

this and wrote over the door of one of their temples: "Man, know
thyself." The self of man is spiritual, and when it is in direct
conscious unity with the Father-Mind it has permanent formative power.
Even in his ignorant use of thought, man's mind is forming conditions,
even to the changing of the face of nature itself. Every thought that
goes forth from the brain sends vibrations into the surrounding
atmosphere and moves the realm of things to action. The effect is in
proportion to the ability of the thinker to concentrate his mental
forces. The average thought vibration produces but temporary results,
but under intense mind activity conditions more or less permanent are
impressed upon the sensitive plate of the universal ether, and through
this activity they are brought into physical manifestation.

6\. Every idea originating in Divine Mind is expressed in the mind of
man; through the thought of man the Divine Mind idea is brought to the
outer plane of consciousness. In the organism of man are centers that
respond to the divine ideas, as a musical instrument sympathetically
responds to musical vibrations. Then through another movement on what is
termed the conscious, or most outer, plane of action, the thought takes
expression as the spoken word. There is in the formed conscious man, or
body, a point of concentration for this word; and through this point the
word is expressed in invisible vibrations. For example, at the root of
the tongue is a brain center, and through it the mind controls the

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

larynx, the tongue, and all the other organs used in forming words.
Following the creative law in its operation from the formless to the
formed, we can see how an idea fundamental in Divine Mind is grasped by
the man ego, how it takes form in his thought, and how it is later
expressed through his spoken word. If in each step of this process he
conformed to the divine creative law, man's word would make things
instantly, as Jesus made the increase of the loaves and fishes. But
since he has lost, in a measure, knowledge of the steps in this creative
process from the within to the without, there are many breaks and
abnormal conditions, with more failures than successes in the products.

7\. However, every word has its effect, though unseen and unrecognized.
Jesus said that a man would be held accountable for "every idle word,"
and a close observation of the power of mind in the affairs of the
individual proves this to be true. What we think, we usually express in
words; and our words bring about in our life and affairs whatever we put
into them. A weak thought is followed by words of weakness. Through the
law of expression and form, words of weakness change to weakness the
character of everything that receives them.

8\. The nerves are the wires that transmit the mind's messages to all
parts of the body, and these parts, being thought formations, carry out,
in their turn, the word that has been spoken into them. Talking about
nervousness and weakness will produce

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

corresponding conditions in the body; on the other hand, sending forth
the word of strength and affirming poise will bring about the desired
strength and poise. Your talking about a weak stomach will make your
stomach weak. Your talking about your bad liver will fix that idea in
your liver. The usual conversation among people creates ill health
instead of good health, because of wrong words. If the words speak of
disease as a reality, disintegrating forces are set in action, and
these, in the end, shatter the strongest organism, if not counteracted
by constructive forces.

9\. As an example of the vibratory power of the spoken word, a vocalist
can shatter a wineglass by concentrating upon it certain tones. Every
time we speak we cause the atoms of the body to tremble and change their
places. Not only do we cause the atoms of our own body to change their
position, but we raise or lower the rate of vibration and otherwise
affect the bodies of others with whom we come in contact. By telling the
little child that he looks sick and tired, the mother produces these
conditions in the child's mind and body. If the mother addresses words
of health, life, and strength to the child, these will set his bodily
functions into activity and they will express the harmony of the
dominant thought.

10\. Thus every word brings forth after its kind. The "seed" is the
creative idea inherent in the word, the nature that it inherits from its
parent source--God. The enthusiast in floral culture, who hovers

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

over and talks in loving tones to his flowers, always has success with
them, while his neighbor, who is cold and indifferent, fails. The mental
emanation and the creative word are the forces that stimulate the
receptive intelligence of nature, and although the enthusiast may know
nothing of the law of mind, he is using it in its most effective mode,
the creative word. In like manner the spiritual healer mentally and
audibly speaks to the same all-pervading receptacle, and it responds by
building up wasted tissues and weakened functions.

11\. Mind is everywhere and its avenues of expression, like the ether
waves of radio, run in every direction. The wonderful discovery that
messages can be sent around the earth without wires should forever
silence those who have been incredulous when thought transference
through a like ether is claimed. But there is a means by which ideas may
be transmitted even more rapidly than by mental vibrations, and that is
unity with supreme Mind. This Mind exists as the absolute, the
unlimited. In its consciousness there is no apartness, no separation,
and whoever puts himself into its consciousness can accomplish things
instantly.

12\. When the centurion said to Jesus, "Only say the word, and my
servant shall be healed," the Master said that He had not found so great
faith in all Israel, and His healing word was: "As thou hast believed,
so be it done unto thee." We must have a certain amount of faith in the
substance of

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

the invisible and in its ability to do our will. When Peter recognized
in Jesus that inner principle called Christ, the Son of God, the
response was: "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my
Father who is in heaven." The Father must have been present to Peter as
He was to Jesus, and the "heaven" in which Jesus said that the Father
was must also have been there. The fact is, Being is always present.
Mortal ignorance and lack of faith prevent our realization of this
truth. The more we believe in the wisdom, power, substance, love, and
life of the one Mind, the greater is its activity in us and our affairs.
Not only should we have faith in the All-Presence, but we should also
develop our understanding to the end that we may know why the
All-Presence manifests through us. Physical science is today in advance
of religion in its recognition of a universal life substance and
intelligence. Religion is looking for this mighty Creator away off in
some distant heaven, right in the face of the distinct teaching of Jesus
that God is Spirit and that His kingdom is within man.

13\. But physical science falls short in that it fails to recognize the
unity between omnipresent Intelligence and the knowing principle in man.
Science is seeking to know intellectually, or from the plane of forms
and shapes, that which is of the mind. Physical science has recognized
the presence of the creative forces, but it does not know the power that
moves them. Divine metaphysics has discovered the moving

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

power to be the thought and word of man, and is proving the truth of
this principle through results in a multitude of directions.

14\. The spoken word carries vibrations through the universal ether, and
also moves the intelligence inherent in every form, animate or
inanimate. It has been discovered that even rocks and all minerals have
life. This is proof of the omnipresence of the one animating substance.
Man, being the highest emanation of Divine Mind, has great directive
power and is really co-operator with God in forming the universe. We
should be speaking words of truth to everything, not only to mankind but
to the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms. The fine discernment of
the poet reveals that "the very stones cry out" where a tragedy has
occurred. The all-penetrating ether receives our thoughts and words,
like the wax cylinder of the phonograph, only a thousand times more
accurately; it preserves them and echoes them back to us in continuous
vibrations. There are no secrets and no concealments. Jesus said that
what you think and speak in the inner chamber is proclaimed from the
housetops, and now we know why this is true. The very walls of your
room, aye, even the substance of the atmosphere in that room, are
proclaiming over and over the words that you have spoken there, whether
you are present or not. For example, a woman rented a room in a certain
city. Several nights in succession, just as she fell asleep, she heard a
man talking incoherently about the grain

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

market. This continued for some time, and she mentioned it to the
landlady who informed her that the room had been last occupied by a
dealer on the board of trade.

15\. The power of the word is given man to use. The better he
understands the character of God and his own relation to humanity, the
more unselfishly will he exercise this power. Some are using it in
selfish ways, but this should not deter others who have a better
understanding of the law from using it in righteous ways. "If ye shall
ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name," is a
promise that none should ignore. If we need things and if they are
necessary to our happiness, it is not sacrilegious to set into action
this higher law in attaining them.

16\. The curses of the witch and the blessings of the priest have always
been believed in by so-called ignorant and credulous people. In the
light of modern revelation, the charge of ignorance should be shifted to
the unbelieving. The word of one in authority carries weight and
produces far-reaching effects. The fiat of the physician that a certain
disease must result disastrously to the patient will, when believed,
counteract all the healing forces of nature. A pin scratch has resulted
in blood poison, because there was no proper denial that such a result
might follow.

17\. Man has the power to deny and dissolve all disintegrating,
discordant, and disease-forming words. Knowledge of this fact is the
greatest discovery

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

of all ages. No other revelation from God to man is to be compared with
it. You can make yourself a new creature, and you can build the world
about you to your highest ideals. Do not fear, but speak to the law
supreme the desires of your heart. If your word is selfish, that which
will come to you through its use will be unsatisfactory, but you will
profit by the experience and thus learn to speak words of righteousness
only. But it is your duty as expresser of the divine law to speak forth
the Logos, the very Word of God, and cause the Garden of Eden, the
everywhere-present Mind-Substance, to manifest for you and in you in its
innate perfection.

The Power Of Words

(To be used in connection with Lesson Six)

1\. "Death and life are in the power of the tongue."

2\. "The tongue of the wise is health."

3\. "He that guardeth his mouth keepeth his life."

4\. "Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
troubles."

5\. "A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of
his soul."

6\. "Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? There is more hope of
a fool than of him."

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

7\. "Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to
the bones."

8\. "The lips of the wise shall preserve them."

9\. "Put away from thee a wayward mouth, and perverse lips put far from
thee."

10\. "Shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in
ungodliness, and their word will eat as doth a gangrene."

tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile."

12\. "To him that ordereth his way aright will I show the salvation of
God."

13\. "I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will
keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me."

14\. "What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he
may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking
guile."

15\. "Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account
thereof in the day of judgment."
