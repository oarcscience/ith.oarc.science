###  Chapter III Realization Precedes Manifestation 

GOD'S MAN is hale, whole, hearty. This is Truth. A spiritual realization
is a realization of Truth. A spiritual realization of health is the
result of holding in consciousness a statement of health until the logic
of the mind is satisfied and man receives the assurance that the
fulfillment in the physical must follow. In other words, by realizing a
healing prayer man lays hold of the principle of health itself and the
whole consciousness is illumined; he perceives principle working out his
health problems for him.

However when man lays hold of the principle of wholeness, he finds that
he is automatically working with God and that much new power is added.
He realizes: "My Father worketh even until now, and I work." After man
has applied his mind diligently for a season, he exhausts his resources
or powers of realization for the time being and rests from all his work;
but his accumulated thought energy is completed or fulfilled in a higher
realm, and he has a double assurance that health must become manifest.

Jesus understood and demonstrated this law perfectly. He was so much at
one with the principle of health that He needed only to say, "Thy faith
hath made thee whole" or "Lazarus, come forth,"

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

in order to bring into evidence the perfect demonstration.

Realization means at-one-ment, completion, perfection, wholeness,
repose, resting in God. A realization of health brings to the
consciousness an inner knowing that the divine law has been fulfilled in
thought and act. Then as man lays hold of the in-dwelling Christ he is
raised out of the Adam or dark consciousness into the Christ
consciousness. This at-one-ment with God brings a lasting joy that
cannot be taken away.

God-Mind rests in a perpetual realization of health, and that which
seems to be sickness does not exist in Truth. When man becomes so much
at one with God-Mind that he abides in the consciousness of health he
enters the eternal peace in which he knows that "it is finished."

In order to understand God-Mind we need to study our own mind. The more
we analyze the processes of the mind the more plainly the mind with its
mental "compounds" appears as the source of health and of all other
things. In the realms of dense matter intelligence may be so faint as to
have lost all contact with Mind. Yet the poet sings about there being
"sermons in stones." Again science announces that life is present in and
is disintegrating the solid rocks and the whole earth groans and creaks
in her struggle with inertia. So if we want to know the secrets of
health and how right thinking forms the perfect body, we must go to the
mind and trace step by step the movements that transform

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

ideas of health into light, electrons, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues,
and finally into the perfect physical organism.

Although there is almost universal skepticism with reference to the
mind's ability to know consciously how relative substance is formed,
there are those who have made contact with the thought processes and can
apply them in transforming the cells and tissues of their own body. The
almost insurmountable obstacle to explaining to others how this is
accomplished is the paucity of language. The mind functions in ways that
are so strange and unbelievable that the pioneers on this frontier of
metaphysics choose as a rule to remain silent.

Jesus is the outstanding pioneer in this realm where the
health-producing processes of cells are released and imbued with
supermind vitality.

He spent years in becoming acquainted with His body and freeing its
cells from the material bondage to which the race thought had bound
them.

Yet He gave no scientific explanation of the purifying through which He
put His body to transform it before Peter, James, and John, as stated in
Luke 9:29: "And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was
altered, and his raiment became white and dazzling." Modern
metaphysicians do not excuse their ignorance by claiming that this and
many other instances in which Jesus showed mastery over His body were
miracles. Scientific Christians regard as mortal superstition the
prevalent view that miracles are the abrogation by God of His laws

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

and are performed as a sort of legerdemain to attract and astonish the
people. The marvelous things that Jesus did we can do when we understand
the law. "The works that I do shall he do also; and greater" still holds
good.

Much that is attributed to the subconscious, strictly speaking, springs
from the all-knowing or spiritual Mind. When we cannot intellectually
account for our knowledge we assume the subconscious to be its source.
Yet we should know that the subconscious is the storehouse of past
knowledge and past experiences. So it knows only what has filtered
through the conscious mind. It cannot therefore be the source of
knowledge except through reflection or memory. This memory of what man
has passed through in the aeons of his experience is often called
intuition; it is the instinct of the animal soul.

The world today looks up to science; that is, it does not accept or
believe anything unless it can be demonstrated by well-known universal
laws. There are no known laws governing religion that can be
scientifically explained; hence it is not acceptable to the scientific
mind. But there is a technique for molding thought stuff by means of the
mind, and metaphysicians follow it in their scientific thinking and in
healing. The metaphysician handles omnipresent Spirit life and substance
very much as the electrician handles electricity. Energy is locked up in
all this life and substance and its release enables the metaphysician to
utilize it in demonstrating health and in achieving success.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

All the chemical elements adhere to their particular form and endeavor
to retain it. Electricity is supposed to be a universal invisible energy
whose unity can be broken up by the whirl of a dynamo. The electronic
units exert all the force of their nature in a pull to regain their
original status. Thus the power generated by a dynamo is gained from the
force exerted by the electrical units in their rush to establish their
primal equipoise.

Only a certain percentage of this energy is utilized because of the pull
of the electrical units to get back home to their mother principle. The
dissipation of energy is one of the great problems of the engineer. The
loss of electricity in transmission is so great that only a small part
of the original current reaches its destination.

We exist right in the midst of forces that would yield us power to do
all our work if we knew how to conserve and properly utilize their
energies. This is not only true of our use of the many elements in the
natural world all about us but especially of our utilization of the
energy generated by our minds. If we could utilize this dissipated
energy constructively it would restore the body, illumine the mind, and
establish us in a lasting consciousness of dominion and mastery.

With every thought there is a radiation of energy. If a person is
untrained in thinking and lets his mind express all kinds of thoughts
without control, he not only uses up his thought stuff but fails also to
accomplish any helpful result.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

Conservation of thought stuff is essential to right thinking. Right
thinking is using the mind to bring about right ends idealized by the
thinker. All the elements necessary to the restoration of health exist
in the higher dimensions of the mind. Through concentration and
conservation of thought force man regains the consciousness of health in
his mind, and health then becomes manifest in his body.

Laws fixed by infinite Mind automatically accomplish whatever man
desires when he becomes obedient to the inner guide. Concentration,
one-pointed attention, forms a mental magnet in the mind to which
thought substance rushes like iron filings to a loadstone. Then follows
confidence or faith in one's ability to accomplish the desired end.
According to the Scriptures this is the law by which the universe was
brought into manifestation. In the 11th chapter of Hebrews it is
written: "By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the
word of God."

Modern science by its most daring proponents is launching out into the
deeps of the invisible and describing in detail the electrical processes
that ultimate in the atom and its aggregations in visible things. In
substance they tell us that when points of light gather about a certain
nucleus an atom is created, and from this a cell, and cell aggregations
make tissues and these merge into the realm of things.

Here we have the scientific explanation and the Christian
metaphysician's formula for making the

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

invisible visible. The greatest of all physicists cannot tell what
electricity is. Even Edison said he was ignorant of its real nature.
Some find it sometimes acting very much like mind and have so stated.
The head of the General Electric research department was asked by a
reporter to give him a definition of electricity. The professor replied
that to his mind electricity was like what the Christians describe as
faith.

The scientific metaphysician fixes his attention powerfully on the
consummation of a certain idea until he has a realization, which means
that the idea has nucleated a certain amount of thought substance. When
this realization is had the metaphysician rests "from all his work."
Through faith and work he has fulfilled the law of mind and he rests in
the conviction that his ideal of health will appear in manifestation in
due season.

To a metaphysician realization is the conviction that a person gets when
he has persistently concentrated his attention on an ideal until he
feels assured of the fulfillment of that ideal. Elohim God pronounced
His spiritual creation "very good"; then rested from all His work. There
was as yet no manifestation, "no herb of the field had yet sprung up,"
and "there was not a man to till the ground"; yet the planning Mind had
the realization that the spiritual law had been fulfilled and that it
should rest from all its works.

That all things visible are held in place by a force invisible is the
conviction of the majority of logical thinkers. In other words,
everything is ensouled.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

When we understand that the soul has consciousness, that it thinks, we
have the explanation of many mysterious phenomena. Some 150 years ago
Franz Mesmer announced in Germany that under certain conditions he could
induce a magnetic sleep in persons and control their minds. His
demonstrations attracted the attention of doctors and mental scientists
the world over. In this day the system is practiced under the name of
hypnotism. It is full of pitfalls for both operator and patient because
its tendency is to weaken the positive control that the mind should
always exercise over its own brain structure. However it is one of the
many proofs that the mind can produce conditions in the mental world
that ultimate in the material world. A great physical scientist stated
recently that it may be that the gods that determine our fates are our
own minds working on our brain cells and through them on the world about
us. This is very close to the Truth.

Every Christian metaphysician knows that back of the personal mind there
is a great creative Mind that also recreates. This creative Mind has
been named and described by men all down the ages. God-Mind not only can
restore and heal but can establish us in the consciousness of permanent
health. Do not allow your conception of God to be handicapped by what
men have said about Him.

"There is a spirit in man,

And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding."

Let the Spirit of God in you reveal to you His true

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

character. God was never sick a day; He is the source of life and health
and joy. God wills that we express His "image" and "likeness," in which
we were created.

The prayer for realization attains its consummation when with
concentrated spiritual attention one has affirmed that God Spirit is
present, that with all His power He is bringing to pass the perfect
health desired, and that all is well. When your thoughts radiate with
the speed of spiritual light, they blend with creative Mind (called by
Jesus "heaven"), and the thing you have asked for will be done. Jesus
told Peter that whatever he bound (affirmed) in earth would be bound in
heaven and whatever he loosed (denied) in earth would be loosed in
heaven. Peter had unbounded faith in Jesus (who represents spiritual
man). When any man has unbounded faith in spiritual power his words,
uttered in the limitations of matter, are flashed to heaven (creative
Mind) and they accomplish whatever he puts into them. The fulfillment of
this spoken word in the world of activities may take moments, hours,
days, years, centuries; Jesus said that the Father only knew when these
things would come to pass. Do not think because you do not get an
instant response to your prayers that they are not answered. Every
sincere desire and every effectual prayer for health that has ascended
to heaven (creative Mind) is fulfilled, and will be made manifest
whenever material limitations permit. Shakespeare had an inkling of this
law of the relation

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

of thoughts and words when he wrote,

"My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:

Words without thoughts never to heaven go."

The kingdom of heaven (the heavens) so often referred to by Jesus and
described by Him as very near to us is far more accessible and is more
often contacted by us than we imagine. Not only those who pray but those
who persistently concentrate their thoughts on mathematics, music, or
philosophies based in principle, are often rewarded with the marvelous
intuitions of genius. These persons apparently break into a realm where
no effort is required to gain the answer to their questions. The
mathematical genius is called a prodigy. He solves instantly the most
complex mathematical problem, yet cannot explain how he does it. He
simply knows the answer, often before the statement of the problem has
been completed.

Henri Poincare in his book "Science and Method" says that his
discoveries in mathematics came to him in flashes after he had spent
long periods of study and concentration on the subject. Concentrated
attention of the mind on an idea of any kind is equal to prayer and will
make available the spiritual principle that is its source in proportion
to the intensity and continuity of the mental effort. Anyone can attain
spiritual understanding and become conscious of the light who will
persistently pray for it. "He that cometh to God must believe that he
is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." The
emphasis here is on the word "diligently."

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

The mind is the seat of perfection, not only of health but also of
talents like music, art, writing, and the like. The idea of health and
the idea of music are interblended, for instance. Music is a great aid
to the healing force. Musical and health ideas interblend, and their
establishment in order produces this kingdom of the heavens.

Our spiritual realizations produce that silent shuttle of thought which,
working in and through cell and nerve, weaves into one harmonious whole
mind and body and is expressed as health and wealth and genius.

The musical genius says he hears the music in a flash and is often at
his wit's end to transcribe it fast enough. Many an immortal poem and
prose work as well has been flashed from the mind of the author without
any apparent effort on his part. But if all the prayers and mind efforts
of literary geniuses were inquired into, it would be found that there
had been heroic mental effort somewhere at some time. So it is with
healing. The realization of perfection takes root in the soul and may
come forth in a flash as perfect health. We should not confine ourselves
to the present life of the individual but go into previous incarnations
in which the work was done that made the genius in this incarnation.

Professor Einstein was considered the greatest mathematical genius of
our time. The scientific world does not connect his insight into
scientific principles with his religious life, but he freely stated that
he worshiped God. He said: "The voice of God

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

is from within. Something within me tells me what I must do every day."
For him God is as valid as a scientific argument. On the subject of
spiritual realization he once said:

"Every man knows that in his work he does best and accomplishes most
when he has attained a proficiency that enables him to work intuitively.
That is, there are things that we come to know so well that we do not
know how we know them. Perhaps we live best and do things best when we
are not too conscious of how and why we do them."

The supreme realization of man is his unity with God. Jesus had this
realization and proclaimed it before there was any manifestation. When
He told His followers, "I and the Father are one" and "He that hath seen
me hath seen the Father," they demanded that He show them the Father.
They could not then understand that He had spiritually united with
creative Mind. Men in our day are having this realization in a more
universal way than ever before in the history of the race, and they are
affirming it in the face of ridicule and condemnation. When this inner
consciousness is attained by any man the foundation has been laid of the
Peter church or temple that is man's immortal body, which will never
pass away.

Metaphysically realization is expectancy objectified. The mind conceives
a proposition and then marshals all its forces to make that conception a
reality in the objective world. All things material are first thought
pictures, carved by the imagination

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

from omnipresent thought substance. Shakespeare in "Much Ado about
Nothing" brings out the idea as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The idea of her life shall sweetly creep  
Into his study of imagination,  
And every lovely organ of her life,  
Shall come appareled in more precious habit,  
More moving-delicate and full of life  
Into the eye and prospect of his soul.  
</span>

</div>

This realm of realization is so real to the mind that it requires a
trained metaphysician to detect the difference between its creations and
the manifest realm of things. We all have a body in the ether that is
the counterpart of the physical. It is through this psychic body that we
have sensation in the physical. It is possible to think of the psychic
body and cultivate its sensations until it appears as real as the
physical. Many persons have done this until they have formed a psychic
world consciousness and they are often unable to separate it from the
physical. They search materially for the treasures they see psychically.
To them the realm of thought forms is the finality of creation instead
of the mental pictures of that which is about to appear.

The trained metaphysician is no stranger to this picture gallery of the
mind and he is not deceived into believing that it is any more than a
mental reflection. One who enters the realm of spiritual ideas does not
allow his consciousness to become confused with the mind pictures that
flash into psychic sight. They are part of the process of making ideas
manifest. When a Christian healer realizes that his

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

treatment has firmly formed the picture of health, he relaxes his
decrees and statements of Truth and trusts the divine law to make health
manifest.

Paul urges in many of his writings that we have the Mind of Christ: that
we let Christ be formed in us. This has usually been taken to mean that
we are to imitate Christ. This is good as far as it goes, but it does
not go far enough. To follow Jesus Christ in the regeneration or new
birth we must fulfill the law of body building, which is a
reconstruction of the corrupt cells: "This corruptible must put on
in-corruption." To accomplish this and make the body conform to His
perfect body we must see Him as He is in His perfect body. This perfect
body exists as an ideal body in us all. By mentally concentrating on
this perfect body and focusing all our powers on it as the vital life of
the physical a transformation will begin that will finally raise the
physical to divine stature. Paul points the way in II Corinthians:

"But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of
the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even
as from the Lord the Spirit."
