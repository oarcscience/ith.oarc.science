###  Chapter IX Healing through Praise and Thanksgiving 

I PRAISE and give thanks that the strength and power of Thy Spirit now
restores me to harmony and health.

"Always praise the cooking of the cook" is the instruction of the
veteran hobo to the novice. Experience has taught the gentlemen of the
road that praise and thanks melt the hardest heart and often open the
door to amazing hospitality. Tradespeople have found that "Thank you"
has commercial value.

Metaphysicians have discovered that words which express thanks,
gratitude, and praise release mind energy of mind and Soul; and their
use is usually followed by effects so pronounced that they are quickly
identified with the words that provoke them.

Let your words of praise and thanksgiving be to Spirit, and the increase
will be even greater than when they are addressed to man. The resources
of Spirit are beyond our highest flight of imagination. You can praise a
weak body into strength, a fearful heart into peace and trust, shattered
nerves into poise and power.

I give thanks for the Christ life now apparent in my mind and body.

It is an easy matter to give thanks for what we

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

have already received, but it is not so easy to give thanks for what we
hope to receive. However giving thanks in advance brings to pass a
present expectation. Remember what Jesus said about one's mental
attitude in demonstrating spirituality: "All things, whatsoever ye shall
ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive." This may be rephrased in
this wise: Pray believing that you have received, and you shall receive.

Christians who have discovered the hidden laws of the mind make it a
practice to give thanks for health, for peace of mind, for all things
that they desire, believing that God has given in Spirit that which is
to appear in the visible.

I daily praise and thank the Spirit of life and health for constantly
restoring me to perfection of body.

Praising and giving thanks liberate the finer essence of soul and body
when we center our attention upon Spirit. Spirit is the dynamic force
that releases the pent-up energies within man. The energies have been
imprisoned in the cells, and when released are again restored to action
in the body by the chemistry of creative Mind. The perfection of this
restoration is in proportion to the understanding and industry of the
individual.

Every thought we loose in our mind carries with it a certain substance,
life, and intelligence. So we might call our thoughts our "thought
people." Whenever praise is bestowed on these thought people, who are
intelligent, it is carried to every part

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

of the body and through the ether to a large area of our soul aura, and
our whole consciousness and everything about us is tinctured with
praise. Thus we prove what Jesus proclaimed, that when we seek His
kingdom and His righteousness all things are added to us.

The prophets of old knew the power of increase inherent in thanksgiving.
"Praise ye Jehovah" is repeated again and again in the Psalms, because
the Psalmist knew that praise and thanksgiving divinely directed tap the
mighty reservoirs of infinite Mind.

Jehovah-shalom gives me peace of mind, and I am harmonized and healed.

The Bible contains more high mysticism than all other books. But it
requires study of certain fundamental spiritual principles to discern
it. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. Unless you call on your
own innate spiritual light you cannot appreciate spiritual insight of
those who wrote the books of the Bible.

The idea that all the Bible writers were equally inspired is fallacious.
They were from every walk of life, and their inspirations were modified
by their own mental bias as well as their surroundings. Moreover some of
the most important revelations of fundamental principles are undoubtedly
the result of borrowing. Although Moses was a trained mystic and
inspirational writer, he did not originate all the allegories found in
the books that bear his name. It is obvious from the testimony of
religious records antedating the Hebrew Scriptures by thousands of

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

years that Moses complied and edited for the benefit of the Israelites.

This discovery does not detract from the truth or importance of the
writings but greatly enhances them. The very fact that these sacred
writings have been preserved for untold ages points to them as
possessing unusual value and as conservers of worthwhile knowledge.

Studying the Bible in the light of the discoveries of modern science, we
are amazed at the scientific accuracy of the statements in the early
chapters of Genesis. Have men in past ages been wiser than those of the
present or were they inspired beyond their understanding? For example,
in the 3d verse of the 1st chapter of Genesis, God created the light on
the first day, yet the sun, the supposed source of light, was not
created until the fourth day. This supposed error in the orderly
creative process often has been cited as evidence of crudity by Bible
critics. But the very modern scientific discovery that the sun is not
the source of light, that the sun merely radiates the light that
originates in universal etheric waves proves that Moses was right. So
what we call light is not the real light, but a luminous effect produced
in our earthly atmosphere. So also all life originates in the ether, and
not in the earth, where scientists have vainly sought it. When science
admits, as it eventually will, that the ether is moved by omnipresent
Mind, we shall have in the Bible a complete spiritual cosmogony.

The Bible is a perpetual revelation to Truth seekers

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

on account of its allegorical character. This is especially outstanding
in Genesis, which veils in names and ordinary incidents some of the
great truths of creation. The names of the Divinity are not all the same
in the Hebrew. Elohim God represents the original Mind in creative
action. El means the strong and ever-sustaining one, and alah, to swear
or formulate by the power of the word. Here also is implied plurality of
attributes in addition to masculine and feminine qualities. Elohim thus
represents the universal principle of Being designing all of creation.
In the 2d chapter another name for God is
used--Jehovah--God--metaphysically representing the executive power
Elohim. This name is also rich in occult significance. Yahweh is the
original form, and its meaning is "the self-existent one" at work or
becoming known or revealing Himself to His creation and through His
creation. Yahweh revealed Himself to Moses as "I AM THAT I AM." He
reveals Himself to every one of us according to our needs when we call
upon Him. He revealed Himself to Jesus as the Father within.

The Hebrew teachers gave compound names to Jehovah to meet every
situation. That is, they invoked His I AM presence as a creative factor
in producing the thing needed. When they needed supply, they invoked
Jehovah-jireh, "Jehovah will provide." Jehovah-rapha is "the Lord that
healeth thee." Jehovah--shalom is "Jehovah is peace" or "the Lord send
peace." The whole world needs peace today as never before, and peace
will not be ushered in until

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

men call on the name of Jehovah.

It may sound foolish in the sight of men for a small group of people to
call on Jehovah-shalom to make peace in the midst of war, but great
miracles have resulted from such action. Jehovah-shalom will save us
from personal worry and fear of future ills. It was the Jehovah-shalom
in Jesus that proclaimed, "My peace I give unto you: not as the world
giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it
be fearful."

I am a tower of strength and stability in the realization that God is my
health."

It is the conclusion of the followers of Jesus that a new and original
interpretation of His teaching has sprung up in the last half century.
The adherents of this new religion, for such it seems to be, claim that
they have a revelation of Christianity that far transcends the old in
spiritual understanding and power. The new religion makes Jesus a
demonstrator of scientific mind laws that any industrious student can
understand and apply as Jesus applied them. In addition to this the new
Christianity elevates man to a realm in which seeming miracles of
healing become possible to those who train their mind to think
spiritually, carrying out the admonition of Paul "Be ye transformed by
the renewing of your mind."

As all the physical science books have to be re-written since the
discovery that electricity is the mother of matter, so all books of
religion that ignore psychology will have to be rewritten.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

The new Christianity claims that Jesus Christ understood the real
character of space and ether as taught by science and that it is the
home of a great and mighty life and intelligence that brought man and
the universe into manifestation.

Instead of fighting modern science the new Christianity welcomes its
discoveries as proofs of the veritable existence of the kingdom of the
heavens that Jesus taught so persistently.

Instead of a heaven after death the new Christianity teaches a kingdom
of the heavens existing now as a righteous state of mind. It teaches
that man makes his heaven here and now by the formative power of his
thought.

It is by way of this emphatic and constant emphasis on the formative
power of thought that the new Christianity launches out into the deep.
Instead of God's creating man with a mighty word fiat and arbitrarily
following it up with vengeance and punishments, God is discerned to be a
mind principle that requires the co-operation of its creations, because
they are formed of it and in it and are so like it that there is virtual
action and reaction between Creator and creation. This places the
responsibility for conditions on both God and man. When we think and
work in unity with the Father the results are universally good. When we
work without reference to the inspiring Mind within our work is usually
unsatisfactory. "My Father worketh even until now, and I work," said
Jesus.

Then the carping critic cries, "Your religion is

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

psychology instead of Christianity." Our answer is that the new
Christianity includes an understanding of psychology but does not stop
with an analysis of the mind. It goes on to the highest phase of mind's
possibilities, unity with Spirit.

When it dawns upon man that he has within him the primal spiritual spark
of God, the living Word or Logos, and that through the Word he is
identified with the original Mind, he has the key to infinite soul
unfoldment.

Even though a person does not at first have this higher revelation of
his sonship and unity with creative Mind, the assumption helps him to
bring it to realization. Jesus developed in faith and power as He used
His word. According to the text, He did not know that He could do absent
healing by the power of His word before the centurion suggested it.

Never dampen your faith or the faith of another in you. Jesus exalted
faith to first place in His healing work. "Be of good cheer; thy faith
hath made thee whole." "When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There
is lifting up," said Eliphaz to Job. If there is appearance of sickness
or weakness, affirm with all your faith the healing thought.

Through the Spirit of truth I now partake of Christ substance and Christ
life in holy communion, and I am made whole.

At the Last Supper Jesus taught that the bread and wine that He
consecrated were His body and His blood, and He told His followers to
partake of them in remembrance of Him. He did not say

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

that these elements were symbols of His blood and body but that they
were essentially the same substance and life as His body. This also has
been the teaching of the church, as interpreted by the Council of Trent:
"Under each species and under each particle of each species Christ is
contained whole and entire." This is the doctrine of transubstantiation,
that the consecration by the minister of bread and wine changes the
material elements to Christ elements, without affecting their
appearance.

This doctrine has been attacked both within and without the church, the
majority of ministers and laymen accepting it on faith as in some way
related to the miraculous. But the discoveries of the elemental
character of matter by modern science are revealing the universal unity
of substance and the possibility of its transformation from one thing to
another by changing the number and arrangement of the electrons in the
atom.

According to modern science this whole universe of forms can be
dissolved into energy, from which it may again be formed. Science does
not say that the directive and formative power is man, but the Bible so
teaches and especially Jesus. Jesus said that all power was given unto
Him in heaven and in earth. He manifested His power in a small way by
multiplying a few loaves and fishes to feed more than five thousand
persons. In various other instances He demonstrated that He had an
understanding of the transmutation of substance. He raised His flesh
body to an energy level far higher in

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

potential life and substance than any reached before.

As a race we have for ages been deprived in our consciousness of union
with our creative source, and the result has been a gradual decrease in
vitality until the body has lost the ability to hold its atoms together
and consequently has disintegrated. Thus death has come to be accepted
as in some mysterious way a part of the divine plan. Here again certain
biological experiments with cells prove them to be possessed of an
ability to reproduce themselves, which at least hints at physical
immortality.

There are in the world today men and women who have followed the
teaching of Jesus and have developed in their bodies a superenergy or
life that not only permeates the physical structure but envelops it in a
luminous aura that can be and is felt by both themselves and others.
Spirit reveals that spiritual thinking breaks open the physical cells
and atoms and releases their imprisoned life, which originally came from
Divine Mind. Jesus carried this process so far that His whole body was
transformed and became a conscious part of the Father life and
intelligence.

In this way the substance and life of Jesus' body became a connecting
link between our bodies and the body of God. Jesus merged His
consciousness with the race consciousness and made Himself subject to
our shortcomings in order to lift us up to spiritual life. This is the
secret of His great sacrifice and sin offering.

When we understand that man has the power to

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

release the divine life imprisoned in the cells of his body and project
it as spiritual energy, we have the key that unlocks many mysteries of
personal influence. The vast difference between mediocre and great
speakers and singers is not in voice and words but in invisible soul
energies. We feel the presence before a word is uttered. For example, a
music critic says of Toscanini, the great orchestra leader: "He brings a
charge of electricity into the hall that cannot and does not enter in at
any other time. If only certain persons felt this galvanization of the
atmosphere one might be accused of romanticism or hero worship for
mentioning it. But everybody feels it."

Thousands of great and near-great religious leaders have developed this
"soul body," for that is what it is, but none has reached the high
development of Jesus, who made it possible for us all to take advantage
of His achievement and through Him attain eternal life.

All things and all conditions of body and affairs have their origin in
mind, and it is in our minds that we make contact with the Christ Mind.
The mind of Jesus Christ penetrates and permeates our race consciousness
like the etheric waves from a mighty broadcasting station, and we can
tune in at any time by simply concentrating mentally on the Christ life
and Christ substance.

God and man, heaven and earth, and all the healing powers that be now
unite in healing me.

Socrates, the wise man of Athens, once prayed that "Jove and all the
gods that be" hear his prayer.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

His idea was to invoke all the higher forces, counting them all worth
while. All great men recognize the breadth, height, and depth of Being,
that it is not comprehended in one name, but may be expressed in many.
Paul preaching to the Athenians on Mars' Hill did not disdain their many
shrines, said to be two thousand in number, but complimented them on
their piety, at the same time proclaiming that he came as the
representative of the "UNKNOWN GOD" to whom they had erected an altar.

So we recognize that there is but one source of Being but that He is
expressed in His Son Christ and manifest in His personal representative,
Holy Spirit. The ancient Israelites had several outstanding names for
Jehovah, each representing some special agency, as supplier, peace
giver, guide, and the like. Some sects in our day pray to saints to
execute the will of God in their behalf.

These all point to the fact that God is made manifest in a universe of
executive powers, upon whom man can call as principle or as some form of
personal agency.

This healing statement is recommended particularly to those who have
depended upon temporal remedies or persons for their healing. It will
amplify and energize the healing idea to the point of omnipotence,
because it recognizes all the healing potencies that faith has made
substantial in the past and brings them all to a focal center in
wholeness.

It is universally recognized that the whole human family has broken
loose from the usual stabilized

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

thoughts, that we are afloat in an atmosphere of doubt, that we are
walking question marks asking one another at every turn: What next? What
will be the outcome?

The world of materiality is ending. Science says that what we thought
was a material atom was really the shadow of an amazing aggregation of
protons and electrons pulsating with potential life, energy, and power.
We have been perpetuating the world of materiality by our material
thoughts. Now our dominant thinkers are letting go, and they are telling
us that matter is merely the smoke screen of a universe of energy. As an
eminent scientist says, "We live in a universe of waves, and nothing but
waves."

Christian metaphysicians see the truth that our minds have been jarred
loose from their material concepts and that they have not yet laid hold
of the true concepts. We are mentally afloat in the cosmic ether,
waiting for someone to show us how to lay hold of real, stable ideas.
When men's minds lose their stability, chaos reigns in their affairs.
Emerson said that when a man of ideas is born into the world kings
totter on their thrones.

Jesus said that He came to fulfill the Law and the Prophets; that is, to
demonstrate that natural and spiritual law are one. He foresaw this very
period when the "powers of the heavens shall be shaken" --that is, the
mental realms be broken up--and He attributed this phenomenon to the
coming of the Christ as "lightning."

The 24th chapter of Matthew describes in symbols

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

what is taking place in this century. Christ Mind is quickening the
cosmic light, which science is interpreting as natural law. Those who
see spiritually announce that the next great revelation will be that of
the "prophets," those who discern spiritually that the cosmic ether and
the Christ Mind are one and that the character and the manner of the
coming of the Christ--as a mighty, all-infolding, spiritually quickening
mind--is referred to in the very modern metaphor of lightning: "For as
the lightning cometh forth from the east, and is seen even unto the
west; so shall be the coming of the Son of man."

Jesus answers the flood of queries as to what we shall do when we are
caught in a whirlpool of thought: "Seek ye first his kingdom, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."

The present panceas for the ills of the world are all lacking in
principle and will eventually be discarded, to be followed by the Christ
plan, which will make all the products of the earth directly available
to all the people of the earth. Before this Christ plan can be
established governments must petition God for His intervention in their
affairs; then the divine plan will be revealed.

I press forward with courage and boldness in the power of God, and I am
healed.

In the 6th chapter of Revelation it is written: "And I saw when the Lamb
opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living
creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, Come. And I saw,

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon had a bow; and there
was given unto him a crown: and he came forth conquering, and to
conquer."

The "four living creatures" represent the four dominant factors in
manifest life, which has its original source in the Lamb, which
represents the pure, nonresistant life of Being.

The four horses and their riders are, first, "a white horse,"
representing the power of the Christ; secondly, "a red horse \[war\]:
and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth";
thirdly, "a black horse" (commercialism): "a measure of wheat for a
shilling, and three measures of barely for a shilling"; and fourthly, "a
pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was Death."

At no time in the history of the world has there ever been such activity
in the riders of the three dark horses as right now. The prodigious
preparations for war by nations, incited by the greed for gain will soon
lead them to "let slip the dogs of war" unless the rider of the white
horse comes forth "conquering, and to conquer."

Although all Truth students are praying for harmony in the settlement of
earth's tribulations, they cannot help seeing the effect of thoughts of
selfishness. The last section of this chapter in Revelation gives a
symbolic description of the chaos to come among those who are not
seeking to conquer under the banner of the rider of the white horse,
Christ.

We hold that those who have had revealed to them the peace-giving power
of the Christ mind

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

should be unusually energetic in declaring it to be the dominant quality
in the minds of men everywhere. Do not argue or contend with error but
silently (and aloud if the occasion seems propitious) declare the
presence and power of the Christ.

In the 7th chapter of Revelation is a symbolical description of four
angels protecting the earth until the servants of God are sealed on
their foreheads.

The forehead is the center of consciousness, which the understanding of
Truth seals; that is, it secretly unites the consciousness with Christ.
The number sealed is twelve thousand out of the twelve tribes. This is
all symbolical and should not be taken literally. Man has twelve
faculties, represented by the twelve tribes of Israel. When the
consciousness in the forehead is illumined by Spirit, all twelve centers
in the body automatically respond. "These are they that come out of the
great tribulation, and they washed their robes, and made them white in
the blood of the Lamb."

The "blood of the Lamb" represents the primal life of Being, which Jesus
made accessible to all those who believe in Him as the revealer of the
pure life of God the Father. This consciousness of spiritual life is
mentioned in the 22d chapter: "And he showed me a river of water of
life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the
Lamb."

The concluding verses of the 7th chapter of Revelation reveal the joys
of the faithful. Every member of Unity should study chapters 6 and 7.

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

It will require more than mortal fortitude and courage to cope
successfully with the conditions that are imminent in human affairs, and
we shall all need the help of a higher power. This higher power we shall
find in the Christ Mind.

Cast out fear as far as the tribulations of the world are concerned.
Affirm:

"I press forward with courage and boldness in the power of God, and I am
healed."
