###  Lesson Six Wealth of Mind Expresses Itself in Riches 

PROSPERITY, according to Webster, is an advance or gain in anything good
or desirable, successful progress toward, or attainment of a desired
object. Prosperity does not mean the same thing to any two persons. To
the wage earner an increase of a few dollars in the weekly income may
seem like wonderful prosperity, for it means an increase in the comfort
and welfare of his family. The man who engages in vast enterprises
reckons prosperity in larger terms, and does not consider himself
prosperous unless things are coming to him in a big way. Between these
extremes are many ideas of prosperity, which shows quite plainly that
prosperity is not in the possession of things but in the recognition of
supply and in the knowledge of free and open access to an inexhaustible
storehouse of all that is good or desirable.

In the great Mind of God there is no thought of lack, and such a thought
has no rightful place in your mind. It is your birthright to be
prosperous, regardless of who you are or where you may be.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

Jesus said to all men, "Seek ye first his kingdom, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." This does
not mean that if you belong to a certain church you will be prospered,
for "righteousness" is not conforming to some particular religious
belief but to the law of right thinking, regardless of creed, dogma, or
religious form. Get into the prosperity thought and you will demonstrate
prosperity. Cultivate the habit of thinking about abundance everywhere
present, not only in the forms of imagination but in forms without.
Jesus did not make a separation between the two as though they were at
enmity. He said, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are
Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." Put things in their
right relation, the spiritual first and the material following, each
where it belongs, and render to each its own.

Realize first of all that prosperity is not wholly a matter of capital
or environment but a condition brought about by certain ideas that have
been allowed to rule in the consciousness. When these ideas are changed
the conditions are changed in spite of environment and all appearances,
which must also change to conform to the new ideas. People who come into
riches suddenly without building up a consciousness of prosperity soon
part from their money. Those who are born and bred to riches usually
have plenty all their life even though they never make the effort to
earn a dollar for themselves. This is because the ideas of plenty are so
interwoven

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

into their thought atmosphere that they are a very part of themselves.
They have the prosperity consciousness, in which there is no idea of any
condition under which the necessities of life could be lacking.

We are sometimes asked whether we advocate the accumulation of riches.
No. The accumulation of riches, as has been explained, is futile unless
it is the outgrowth of a rich consciousness. We advocate the
accumulation rather of rich ideas, ideas that are useful, constructive,
and of service to the well-being of all mankind. The outer manifestation
of riches may follow or it may not, but the supply for every need will
be forthcoming because the man of rich ideas has confidence in an
all-providing power that never fails. He may not have an extra dollar,
but his ideas have merit and he has confidence, a combination that
cannot fail to attract the money to carry him forward. This is true
riches, not an accumulation of money, but access to an inexhaustible
resource that can be drawn on at any time to meet any righteous demand.
When a person has this rich consciousness there is no necessity for
laying up gold or accumulating stocks and bonds or other property to
ensure future supply. Such a one may be most generous with his wealth
without fear of depletion, because his rich ideas will keep him in
constant touch with abundance. Those who have the thought of
accumulating material wealth, a thought that is dominant in the world
today, are unbalanced. They have a fear of the loss of riches

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

that makes their tenure insecure. Their prosperity is based on a wrong
idea of the source of riches and eventually means disaster. The sin of
riches is not in the possession but in the love of money, a material
selfishness that leads to soul starvation.

It is not a crime to be rich nor a virtue to be poor, as certain
reformers would have us think. The sin lies in hoarding wealth and
keeping it from circulating freely to all who need it. Those who put
wealth into useful work that contributes to the welfare of the masses
are the salvation of the country. Fortunately, there are many in this
country who have the prosperity consciousness. If we were all in a
poverty consciousness, famines would be as common here as they are in
India or China. Millions in those lands are held in the perpetual
thought of poverty and they suffer want in all its forms from the cradle
to the grave. The burden of the poverty thought reacts on the earth so
that year after year it withholds its products and many people starve.

Universal Mind controls all nature and is in possession of all its
products. "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof" is a great
Truth. Puny, personal man uses all his craft to get control of the
products of nature but is always defeated in the end. Only the universal
man of Spirit is in indisputed possession, and to him the Father says,
"All that is mine is thine." Jesus did not have title to a foot of land
and evidently had no money, for the apostles carried whatever funds the
company had.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

He did not even burden Himself with a tub, as did Diogenes, and "had not
where to lay his head." Yet He was always provided with entertainment of
the best. He took it for granted that whatever He needed was His. The
fish carried His pocketbook, and the invisible ethers furnished the
sideboard from which He handed out food for thousands. He was rich in
every way for He had the prosperity consciousness and proved that the
earth with all its fullness does belong to the Lord, whose righteous
sons are heirs to and in possession of all things.

The anxious thought must be eliminated and the perfect abandon of the
child of nature assumed, and when to this attitude you add the
realization of unlimited resources, you have fulfilled the divine law of
prosperity.

The imagination is a wonderful creative power. It builds all things out
of the one substance. When you associate it with faith, you make things
just as real as those that God makes, for man is a co-creator with God.
Whatever you form in the mind and have faith in will become substantial.
Then you should be on guard as regards what you put your faith in. If it
is material forms, shadows that cease to be as soon as your supporting
thought is withdrawn from them, you are building temporary substance
that will pass away and leave you nothing. Put your faith in the real
or, as Jesus told His disciples, "have faith in God."

The real search of all people is for God. They may think they are
looking for other things, but

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

they must eventually admit that it is God they seek. Having once felt
His presence within them, they are keenly conscious that only God can
satisfy. The place where we meet God should be made so sure and so pure
that we can never mistake His voice or be hidden from His face. This
place we know as the mind, the inmost recess of the soul, the kingdom of
the heavens within us.

It is not sufficient however to sit down and hold thoughts of abundance
without further effort. That is limiting the law to thought alone, and
we want it to be fulfilled in manifestation as well. Cultivating ideas
of abundance is the first step in the process. The ideas that come must
be used. Be alert in doing whatever comes to you to do, cheerful and
competent in the doing, sure of the results, for it is the second step
in the fulfilling of the law.

You can do anything with the thoughts of your mind. They are yours and
under your control. You can direct them, coerce them, hush them, or
crush them. You can dissolve one thought and put another in its stead.
There is no other place in the universe where you are the absolute
master. The dominion given you as your divine right is over your own
thoughts only. When you fully apprehend this and begin to exercise your
God-given dominion, you begin to find the way to God, the only door to
God, the door of mind and thought.

If you are fearful that you will not be provided with the necessities of
life for tomorrow, next week, or next year, or for your old age, or that
your children

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

will be left in want, deny the thought. Do not allow yourself for a
moment to think of something that must be outside the realm of
all-careful, all-providing good. You know even from your outer
experience that the universe is self-sustaining and that its equilibrium
is established by law. The same law that sustains all sustains you as a
part. Claim your identity under that law, your oneness with the all, and
rest in the everlasting arms of Cause, which knows nothing of lack. If
you are in a condition of poverty, this attitude of mind will attract to
you opportunities to better your condition. Insulate your mind from the
destructive thoughts of all those who labor under the belief in hard
times. If your associates talk about the financial stringency, affirm
all the more persistently your dependence on the abundance of God.

By doing this you place yourself under a divine law of demand and supply
that is never influenced by the fluctuations of the market or the
opinions of men. Every time you send out a thought of wholehearted faith
in the I AM part of yourself, you set in motion a chain of causes that
must bring the results you seek. Ask whatsoever you will in the name of
the Christ, the I AM, the divine within, and your demands will be
fulfilled; both heaven and earth will hasten to do your bidding. But
when you have asked for something, be on the alert to receive it when it
comes. People complain that their prayers are not answered when, if we
knew the truth, they are not awake to receive the answer when it comes.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

If you ask for money, do not look for an angel from the skies to bring
it on a golden platter, but keep your eyes open for some fresh
opportunity to make money, an opportunity that will come as sure as you
live.

These are some tangible steps along the way to the larger manifestation
you desire. No one is ever given the keys to the Father's storehouse of
wealth until he has proved his faith and his reliability. Then he may go
in and pass out the goods freely. If the men of the world, with their
selfish ideas of "mine and thine," were given the power, without a
thorough mental cleansing, of instantly producing whatever they desire,
they would undoubtedly practice still greater oppressions on their
fellows, and existing conditions would not be improved.

A stonecutter sees a block of marble as so many hours work, while
Michelangelo sees it as an angel that it is his privilege to bring
forth. This is the difference between those who see the material world
as so much matter and those who look on it with the eyes of mind and the
imagination that works toward perfection. One who paints a picture or
makes a piece of sculpture first sees it in his mind. He first imagines
or images it. If he wants a strong picture he makes force one of the
elements of his image. If he wants beauty and character, he puts love
into it. He may not see the perfect picture until all these elements are
combined, then it requires but little effort to transfer it from his
mind to the canvas or to the marble.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

On the sixth day of creation, we are told, God "imaged" His man, made
him in His image and likeness. This does not mean that God looks like
man, a personal being with manlike form. We make a thing in our own
image, the image we have in mind for the thing, and our creation does
not resemble us in any way. God is without form, for He is Spirit. God
is an idea that man has tried to objectify in various forms. He is the
universal substance, the life that animates the substance, and the love
that binds it together. Man just naturally gives some form to every idea
he has, even the idea of God, for the formative faculty of the mind is
always at work whether we are awake or asleep. We get material for
forming mental pictures from without and from within.

This imaging or formative power of the mind could not make anything
unless it had the substance out of which to form it. One could not make
a loaf of bread without the flour and other ingredients. Yet with all
the ingredients at hand one could not make a loaf unless one had the
power of imaging the loaf in one's mind. This seems simple, but the fact
is that the power to form the loaf is less common than the available
material for the loaf. Flour and water are abundant, but only certain
people can use them in the right way to form a palatable loaf of bread.
So with this subject of prosperity. Substance is everywhere, filling all
the universe. There is no lack. If we have not been successful in
forming it into the things we have needed and

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

wished for, it is not because of lack of substance but of lack of
understanding how to use our imaging power.

The world goes through periods of seeming lack because the people have
refused to build their prosperity on the inner, omnipresent, enduring
substance, and on the contrary have tried to base it on the substance
that they see in the outer. This outer substance, formed by the imaging
power of men in past ages, seems to be limited, and men struggle for it,
forgetting their own divine power to form their own substance from the
limitless supply within. The lesson for all of us should be to build our
prosperity on the inner substance.

Those who do demonstrate prosperity through the law of men have nothing
permanent. All their possessions may be swept away in a moment. They
have not built on the orderly law of God, and without the rich thoughts
of God's bounteousness no one can have an enduring consciousness of
supply.

No disease, poverty, or any other negative condition can enter into our
domain unless we invite it. Nor can it remain with us unless we
entertain it. Conscious power over all such conditions is one of our
greatest delights and a part of our divine inheritance, but we must
learn the law and apply the power in the right way.

Men have a consciousness of lack because they let Satan, the serpent of
sense, tempt them. The Garden of Eden is within us here and now, and the

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

subtle temptation to eat of the tree of sensation is also still with us.
We have been given dominion over the animal forces of the body, the
"beasts of the field," and must tame them, making them servants instead
of masters of the body. Instead of feeding them we must make them feed
us. When we overcome the animals within, it will be easy to train them
in the without. This truth of overcoming is taught all through the
Scriptures, and we can demonstrate it in our life, for God has endowed
us with the power to overcome. We must lay hold of that inherent power
and begin to use it constructively.

The whole human family seems to be sensation mad. All our economic and
social troubles can be traced right back to the selfishness of the sense
man. We can never overcome these conditions in the outer until we
overcome their causes in the inner soul of ourselves. There is sure to
be repetition of war and peace, plenty and famine, good times and
depressions until we take the control of mind substance away from the
sense man and give it to the spiritual man. We know that there is a
spiritual man and we look forward in some ideal way to his coming, but
he will never come until we bring him. We hope and pray for the coming
of better things; but as Mark Twain said about the weather, "no one does
anything about it." We can do something about the matter of self-control
and each of us must if we are ever to improve our condition physically
and financially as well as morally and spiritually.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

We must lift up this serpent of sense, as Moses lifted up the serpent in
the wilderness, and control it in the name of Christ.

Eliminate all negative thoughts that come into your mind. Yet do not
spend all your time in denials but give much of it to the clear
realization of the everywhere present and waiting substance and life.
Some of us have in a measure inherited "hard times" by entertaining the
race thought so prevalent around us. Do not allow yourself to do this.
Remember your identity, that you are a son of God and that your
inheritance is from Him. You are the heir to all that the Father has.
Let the I AM save you from every negative thought. The arrows that fly
by day and the pestilence that threatens are these negative race
thoughts in the mental atmosphere. The I AM consciousness, your Saviour,
will lead you out of the desert of negation and into the Promised Land
of plenty that flows with milk and honey.

Deny that you can lose anything. Let go of negative thoughts of
financial loss or any other kind of loss and realize that nothing is
ever lost in all the universe. There are opportunities everywhere, just
as there have always been, to produce all that you need financially, or
otherwise. God wants you to be a producer of new ideas. New ideas come
to you from within. Do not think for a moment that you are limited to
the ideas that come from without. Many of those ideas are outgrown
anyway and have outlived their usefulness. That is why we go through
periods of change; so that old outworn ideas

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

can be discarded and replaced with new and better ones. There have been
more inventions since the beginning of the so-called depression than in
any previous similar period of American history. This shows that new
ideas are within man, just waiting to be called out and put into
expression. We can find new ways of living and new methods of work; we
are not confined to the ways and methods of the past. When we commune
with the Spirit within and ask for new ideas, they are always
forthcoming. When these ideas from within us are recognized, they go to
work and come to the surface. Then all the thoughts we have ever had, as
well as the thoughts of other people, are added to them and new things
are quickly produced. Let us quit slavishly depending on someone else
for everything and become producers, for only in that direction lies
happiness and success. Let us begin to concentrate on this inner man,
this powerful man who produces things, who gets his ideas from a
higher-dimensional realm, who brings ideas from a new territory, the
land of Canaan.

What kind of character are you giving to this inner substance by your
thoughts? Change your thought and increase your substance in the mind,
as Elisha increased the oil for the widow. Get larger receptacles and
plenty of them. Even a very small idea of substance may be added to and
increased. The widow had a very small amount of oil, but as the prophet
blessed it it increased until it filled every vessel she could borrow
from the neighbors. We should form the habit of blessing

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

everything that we have. It may seem foolish to some persons that we
bless our nickels, dimes, and dollars, but we know that we are setting
the law of increase into operation. All substance is one and connected,
whether in the visible or the invisible. The mind likes something that
is already formed and tangible for a suggestion to take hold of. With
this image the mind sets to work to draw like substance from the
invisible realm and thus increase what we have in hand. Jesus used the
small quantity of loaves and fishes to produce a great quantity
of--loaves and fishes. Elisha used a small amount of oil to produce a
great amount of--oil. So when we bless our money or other goods, we are
complying with a divine law of increase that has been demonstrated many
times.

Another step in the demonstration of prosperity is the preparation of
the consciousness to receive the increase. If we pray for rain, we
should be sure that we have our umbrellas with us. You read in the 3d
chapter of II Kings how Elisha caused the water to come from the
invisible and fill trenches in the desert. But first the trenches had to
be dug in the dry ground. That required faith, but the kings had it, and
they dug trenches all over a large valley, just as Elisha had commanded.
It was through the understanding of Elisha, who knew the truth about the
invisible substance, that this seeming miracle was accomplished. Yet the
trenches had to be prepared, and you must prepare your consciousness for
the inflow of the universal substance.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

It obeys the law of nature, just as does water or any other visible
thing, and flows into the place prepared for it. It fills everything you
hold in your mind, whether vessels, trenches, or your purse.

It is not advisable to hold for too specific a demand. You might
visualize a hundred dollars and get it when a thousand was coming your
way. Do not limit the substance, to what you think you need or want;
rather broaden your consciousness and give infinite Mind freedom to
work, and every good and needful thing will be provided you. Make your
statements broad and comprehensive so that your mind may expand to the
Infinite rather than trying to cram the Infinite into your mind.

Statements To Broaden The Mind And Fill It With The Richness Of
Substance

Infinite wisdom guides me, divine love prospers me, and I am successful
in everything I undertake.

In quietness and confidence I affirm the drawing power of divine love as
my magnet of constantly increasing supply.

I have unbounded faith in the omnipresent substance increasing and
multiplying at my word of plenty, plenty, plenty.

Father, I thank Thee for unlimited increase in mind, money, and affairs.
