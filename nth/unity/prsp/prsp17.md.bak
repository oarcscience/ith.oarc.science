###  

Charles Fillmore was an innovative thinker, a pioneer in metaphysical
thought at a time when most religious thought in America was entirely
orthodox. He was a lifelong advocate of the open, inquiring mind, and he
took pride in keeping abreast of the latest scientific and educational
discoveries and theories. Many years ago he wrote, "What you think today
may not be the measure for your thought tomorrow"; and it seems likely
that were he to compile this book today, he might use different
metaphors, different scientific references, and so on.

Truth is changeless. Those who knew Charles Fillmore best believe that
he would like to be able to rephrase some of his observations for
today's readers, thus giving them the added effectiveness of
contemporary thought. But the ideas themselves--the core of Charles
Fillmore's writings--are as timeless now (and will be tomorrow) as when
they were first published.

Charles Fillmore was born on an Indian reservation just outside the town
of St. Cloud, Minnesota, on August 22, 1854. He made his transition on
July 5, 1948, at Unity Village, Missouri, at the age of 93. To get a
sense of history, when Charles was eleven, Abraham Lincoln was
assassinated; when Charles died, Harry Truman was President.

With his wife Myrtle, Charles Fillmore founded the Unity movement and
Silent Unity, the international prayer ministry that publishes Daily
Word Charles and Myrtle built the worldwide organization that continues
their work today, Unity School of Christianity. Through Unity School's
ministries of prayer, education, and publishing,

millions of people around the world are finding the teachings of Truth
discovered and practiced by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore.

Charles Fillmore was a spiritual pioneer whose impact has yet to be
assessed. No lesser leaders than Dr. Norman Vincent Peale and Dr. Emmet
Fox were profoundly influenced by him. Dr. Peale borrowed his
catchphrase of positive thinking from Charles Fillmore. Emmet Fox was so
affected by Fillmore's ideas that he changed his profession. From an
engineer, he became the well-known writer and speaker.

Charles Fillmore--author, teacher, metaphysician, practical mystic,
husband, father, spiritual leader, visionary--has left a legacy that
continues to impact the lives of millions of people. By his fruits, he
is continuously known.
